Not just put us back together in our old condition, but put us back together in his likeness. Conditioned to carry his spirit. That's a real vessel. That's what I'm looking at this morning. real vessels that God has touched. Amen. Brother Kyle Morton, would you come this morning, Brother Kyle, and open the service in a word of prayer? We're gonna have brother Andrew so graciously is going to take our offer to sing that song again this morning. So, if he's gets ready just after we pray and take up the offering, we'll have brother Andrew sing and then we're going to turn the service as quickly as I as we can to our pastor this morning. Trust that you've come expecting. I know I have just trusting that the Lord would minister to us once again through his servant. We want to read a quick uh continued prayer request but a testimony on behalf of Sister Eleanor Drake for all of your prayers for brother John Drake. Please continue to pray for brother John that a complete healing take place. God is working on John's behalf and may his perfect will be accomplished in this situation. And so we want to continue to remember brother John Drake and the family there. If you have a need upon your heart, why don't you lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer this morning? Brother Kyle. [Music] Lord Jesus, we love you. We're so thankful to be here again this day, Lord. To come from Victoria, Seattle locally, Lord Jesus. Maybe some guests in our midst, too, Lord. And we're thankful to be here, Lord Jesus. Help us make use of the opportunity, Lord, to once more come and to sit at your feet, Lord. Father, we can sit at your feet when we're at home and when we're at work, but when we come together with brothers and sisters, there's such something extra special about it, Lord. So, may you help our hearts and help our minds just come, Lord, and increase our expectation and our faith even now, Lord. Do a supernatural work in our hearts, Lord. We don't want to muster up our own spirituality. We want you to come and take control, Lord. Take charge, God. There's needs and there's burdens, Lord. And there's circumstances that we all face. But you're more than able, Lord. &gt;&gt; Help us not sherk and and shrink, Lord, from things that seem tough, knowing nothing's too hard for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing in our lives, nothing in our bodies is too hard for you, Lord. Let the faith begin to multiply and grow. Even now, Lord, where all those things look so small, Lord Jesus, as we worship you and as the word comes forth, Lord, let those troubles and problems and trials just begin smaller and smaller. Lord, you're so good. Lord Jesus, we love you. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; oh God, we want you to be glorified this day, Lord Jesus. We're excited. May you take control of Brother Ed, Brother Tom, Lord, and the deacons, and the different uh ones who'll be participating for the communion service this evening, Lord. Oh, Father, we're so thankful that you allowed us again to come here. And Lord, I was just thinking as I was walking up here, Lord, even when we're not faithful, you're still faithful, Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord. Just take control. We pray. We're excited. Lord, oh Jesus, bless your holy name. We love you, Father. There's none like you, Lord. Continue to move in our families, Lord Jesus. Surprise us, God. Oh, Father, let your spirit ripple out through the neighborhood, Lord. Touch our wayward loved ones. We pray, Father. Oh, God. You can do anything, Lord. We love you, Lord. Even as we pray, Lord, things happen, Lord Jesus. Even when we go to open up our mouth, Lord, things come out we didn't expect, God. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, there's none like you, Father. You stand alone, Lord. You haven't diminished in glory. Your power. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, have your way. We pray. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, have your way today, Lord. We're committed to you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. As you have your seats and the deacons receive the tithes and offerings this morning, we can sing together. Hold to God's unchanging hand. Just as musicians are getting ready for the special, we'll sing this. And we certainly want to greet those that are on the telephone hookup and the internet this morning. Say, "God bless you to you." Amen. It's a good day. Amen. Looking forward to the communion service this evening. We're going to start at 4:00 sharp, Lord willing. Just looking forward to a real wonderful time.

[Applause] [Music] Holy God. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you and Father Andrew. [Music] Lock me up in a prison [Music] and throw away the key. [Music] Take away the vision from these eyes that now can see. Deprive me of the food I eat. and even bind my hands and feet. But as long as I I know Jesus, then I can still go free. He said that I could still go free. Tell me what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me. For me. I'm so unworthy to live and offer to kill. But the man on the cross, he put my name in his will and he said that I I could still go free. [Music] I never could quite understand why a king would leave his throne. [Music] Put on the robe of an earthly man. Feel pain of flesh of flesh and bone. [Music] The delayer tr down that lonely path that led to Calary. Where those blood red stains broke all of my chains and I could still go free. Oh, he said that I could still go free. Tell me what kind of man would reach down his hand and do this for me. For you and me. So unworthy to live but not fit to kill. But the man on the cross, he put my name in his will and he said that I I could still go free. Oh, he said that I could still go free because the man on the cross. He put my name in his will and he said that I I could still go free. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I trust that's a reality to you this morning. The King of glory would come down and suffer the pain of flesh that we feel. It's nothing new under the sun and he came down and did it just for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning as we stand together. Brother Andrew, I really appreciate you singing that song and Sister Linda for playing again this morning. As our pastor comes this morning, why don't we sing together? Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. This is our story, friends. This is this is the sum of it all. That Jesus Christ lives in me, lives in you. Let's sing the the chorus together if we could. This is my story. Yes, this is my song. I'm praising my S all day long. This is my soul. This is my song. [Music] Praising my savior all day long. His birthday salation perfect [Music] on my side. Angels we sing. &gt;&gt; Oh what you granted this morning. Lord your echo of mercy. Oh whisper to us this morning. For this is my story. This is my soul.

Praising my savior all day long. This is my soul. This is my song. Oh, praising my Savior all the day long. Let's just bow a word of prayer. Gracious and loving heavenly father, we are gathered here to hear words from you. We want to hear heavenly things. Uh we pray that you will send a divine uncction upon the people upon the speaker. We pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that you will elevate us in revelation into heavenly places in Christ Jesus the believer's position. We all have an individual position. We have a place and we pray that you'll move us into that place. I pray that you will so quieten the people that there will not be distractions or movement. I pray, Father, that you will take charge of the service for your glory. May it glorify you. This is the only thing we desire. And Lord, we know that there has been prayer already made. And I'm praying for Sister Heidi Neighbor, oh God, that you will strengthen her. I pray, oh God, you will remove the pain and suffering and that you'll give her a speedy recovery in the name of Jesus Christ. We just ask your blessings now upon this day, upon the uh communion this evening. Pray, Father, you'll prepare our hearts in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. going to be a little different service this morning and uh I want to ask you to uh not look upon it as another preaching service as such but I want you to be able to absorb things that I personally have absorbed and has been a great blessing more than blessing has been a strength has been a guiding light I would think in my own life and in the lives of others. And these are things that are uh that are have been laid out for us in the word of God. And you know the message the prophet of God said one place that the Bible have become a new book. And uh I pray that it'll become a new book to us. &gt;&gt; Uh in spite of what you've seen in the past, may it become greater and greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe you can do that? And I particularly want to try to convey uh without losing you, I want to look at the aspect of God's uh the being of God and and how incapable we are to understand or grasp him because of some things that the prophet has said very clearly. Said he's he's so great he'd be too mysterious. So when I get on that side, don't don't just become quiet, but absorb those absorb the phrases. Uh I'll I'll uh I'll read a scripture in Ephesians uh first chapter 9, 10, and 11. And then I'll let you sit down. But keep your Bibles handy, please. You'll need your Bibles. And then right after this scripture, we'll have those first slides. I'll be ready with that, please. Verse 9, Ephesians 1. having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. And I would I'm going to stress some phrases as we go along, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, but it's according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; As God has purposed these things and I want to speak to you on the purpose of God will stand &gt;&gt; not because of anything we do but it will stand. God the creator of heavens and earth and all things that are therein. The creator of the universes, the galaxies, the God that fills all time and space. And we've gone way beyond anything we can grasp by now. But that God is who we're dealing with. And that's the God I want to speak about. Next verse. That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. Notice he'll gather all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. You may be seated. Now I I feel that uh in in in some of the quote and some of the things that we're going to read, I personally would like to convey to you this that I feel that there are certain keys. You know, you can't get into a room if if it's locked and you don't have the right key. I believe that the prophet has given us some keys and in in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed. There's much in there that it's not a book. It's not just some words. It's not just some phrases, but it is something that God is seeking to convey to us. And I I trust that I will be able to convey at least some things. And you as individuals will pick up whatever God will make real to you. Uh, and now I I'm reading some of the things which brother Brandham said prior to actually speaking this message. And now be as patient as you can for I feel that in this here if God will help me will reveal and bring into your mind all these other things that I have talked on all through the days of the tabernacle. All through the days of the tabernacle. why I have said what I have said and why I have done what I have done. This is why that kind of sets the stage, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; And he goes immediately to the scripture and I'll just read two of them. He goes to the scripture and you can read it when you return home if you would. It is Colossians 1:15 I think to 29 to the end of the chapter. And I'm just going to read the first two verses because this is why. Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature? So now we have already introduced an invisible God. That's difficult perhaps for us humans. We depend upon our v visible world. But he is the image of the invisible god, the firstborn of every creature. We are some creatures. So he's the firstborn of every creature. Not born just as we were born, but for eternal life. For by him were all things created. I'm sorry. For by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created by him and for him. &gt;&gt; The key, one of the keys that we will be covering in the in the service, the key to better understand God and the scope of his plan and purpose. We all have an individual life to live and we all have questions about you know what am I doing where am I going what is this all about and uh so this will help us I trust a better understanding of God a better understanding of God by acknowledging that he is and I quote too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious. &gt;&gt; So now here's a we talk about a prophet he and and people trying to maybe I identify what he said and place it and all the rest of it. This is a God that can't be understood. &gt;&gt; The human mind cannot grasp him. And it's and the and the sooner we acknowledge that God is too great for this little teaspoon of ashes, the better off we'll be. And yet that God has certain desires and we'll be coming to that. So this service I feel is very very important. Very important. God as the creator possesses innumerable attributes attributes to be God for there was a time he wasn't God because God is an object to be worshiped I'll be coming over the repeating some of these things as we go he had these attributes in him to be God he had attributes to be God and to to be worshiped. He had attributes to be a father. Nothing had he hadn't given he hadn't been a father but he had attribute to be a father and to be a son to be a savior but there was nothing lost to be a healer but there was no one sick. He had all those attributes in him. Here's this great being that fills all time and space. Never had a beginning, never had an end. So, we're not trying to pinpoint at c certain junction in time. He he he's timeless. &gt;&gt; So, this great uh being that can't be grasped, can't be understood, but can be believed. &gt;&gt; He can be believed. And so uh he and he is a creator and he possesses he he just possesses a majestic magnitude of of attributes that's in him. But he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant. This is speaking of Jesus Christ. And was made in the likeness of men. Philippians 2:7. The first thing was, and this is now I'm going to much of this is out of Christ, the mystery of God revealed. The first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people before there was any people. There was no people. I added that there was no people before the foundation of the world. Before there was, brother Bram says before there was a molecule, before there was an atom, before there was anything, there was God. And uh he but he wanted the first thing he wanted to re that's one of his attributes. He wanted to reveal himself &gt;&gt; to people but there was no people. He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah. He couldn't do it as the as a great Jehovah God who covered all space, time, and eternity. These are prophet's words. He could not. But what he wanted to do But what he wanted to do, and here's the phrase that I have never been able to fully absorb, and this is the first time I really am trying to bring it to you. What he wanted to do, he loved fatherhood. And these two phrases I think to me are a key to the message, the entire message. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; And the only way I've underlined only and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man. &gt;&gt; Now that will open up the whole message. That's the only way he here's this great being. Uh just try to turn your imagination loose. God, no beginning, no end. That's why I understand I understand when people call it a force, but he's more than a force. He's a being. &gt;&gt; He's a person. &gt;&gt; Prophet says he lives in a house, not a house like we have. He lives in the and he covers all time and space. The space between you and I are vibrating with the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; He's ready to forgive the sinner. He's ready to heal the sick. He's ready to do anything. His attributes are available and they can never diminish. He has mercy for the worst sinner. &gt;&gt; He's got deliverance for the worst the worst person, the person that's most bound. The person that's mentally imbalanced, he can balance that. &gt;&gt; That's God. &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to put him a 100 million light years away. He's present. &gt;&gt; That's another one of his his characteristics. God, he's present. &gt;&gt; But he loved I want you to go back to this and I'll be repeating it. He loved fatherhood. Oh, he just loved fatherhood to be a father in the great mind of God because he said his thoughts were attributes. So obviously God thought oh to be a father and then the prophet says the only way he could be a father is to become a son of man. That's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man. See, there didn't they didn't know what he was talking about. Many of them. He says, "But now you get it. The people of this message are different. Different. We're not people of 2,000 years ago. Now you get it." So, I'll leave you with those and then we want to continue on. according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ. Notice now every time we say Christ, we're speaking of Christ. God loved fatherhood and the only way he could be a father was to become a son of man. That the son, a son of man had to be birthed, be born. And the the scripture says that he purposed it. He hath purposed it. And purpose purpose in the scripture is to set something forth. Setting it forth. Placing it in view. &gt;&gt; So it wasn't just to become a son of man, but had to be in view. Had to expose it &gt;&gt; to the people. &gt;&gt; I trust that today you will get a better picture of things. And uh in the Old Testament they even used the they had the showbread in the Old Testament and it was set in in in rows the loaves of bread but it was it was represented the tribes of Israel and they and but it was set forth and to to view it. So they use that they call that the purpose but the scripture referring to us is the we are set forth. &gt;&gt; God set his messenger forth. God set Jesus forth. It was not it was nothing done in a corner. He said this is not done in a corner. This is done on the plain view. That's the way God has always done things. So the children of Israel uh were those that God had chosen for his purpose in the earth and uh purposes as I said a moment ago to set forth or to place before to be looked at or to expose to view. So the purpose of God, the setting forth of what God hath held in his mind before there were creatures on the earth, God had purposed not only did he have this to be a father, but he wanted it to be in view. &gt;&gt; He wanted to express it. &gt;&gt; And that incidentally, that happens to be the struggle between evil and good, &gt;&gt; between Satan and God is Satan wants to express himself. And if you go out on the streets, you'll see plenty of expression of it. &gt;&gt; Now, if you like to take your Bibles, I want to read from Romans the 8th chapter and we start at the 16th verse, please. You can take that slide off now if you don't mind. Starting with verse 16. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. Now we've gone further and I will come back to this. We are we are the children of God. Well, how did that happen? We we we've come from a great span back where God loved fatherhood &gt;&gt; and he wanted to be a father. And the only way he could be a father is to through a son of man. That that was the only way there had to be a son of man. The son of man. And that Jesus referred to him. Now we've got children. And so we're going to fill up some of these spaces. I please don't don't let me lose you. Uh and if children if we're children if children then hes of God and joint hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him then we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that should be revealed in us. And incidentally, you might say, well, why are we reading that? Well, you know, perhaps some of the people that are here are suffering. We suffer different things. We have pressures. We have decisions. We have difficulties. We have poverty. We have all kinds of we have sorrow. Uh I just walked into the office today to find out one of the sisters very very close to us in the eastern United States that has given to the missions for perhaps 30 or 35 years that I you know brother Michael just walked in. Did you know that sister passed away? I said, "No, I haven't heard. I know her niece real real well and I've known her and her sisters all these years and she's she's suddenly gone and uh she gave an offering last month and she's gone. We haven't even had a chance to send a letter to her. Life is somebody's sorrowing. Good believers are sorrowing but not as others without hope. But that's why we're speaking this scripture. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly. We weren't made to v subject to vanity willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Children of God weren't made to die. Children of God were made to live. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to the redemption of our body. So God has not intended that these bodies will will uh uh you know just vanish into nothing. And we know that all things work together for good, for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. you know, brother Brandham, uh, just to have your attention for a few moments, brother Brandham several times, and this is the first time I've ever looked at it, he just asked the question, who is God? And he preaches a message on who is God? And I think that you know uh let me say that people all over the earth all over the earth doesn't makes no difference of what part of the world they're in. They will worship something and they have some concept of God. The Jews have it, the Muslims have it. Uh the Asians have it. Uh the Sikhs have it. The Hindus have it. The Buddhists have it. They all have a concept and everybody's got their idea of what God and what they should be doing and some sing and some pray and some pray this way and some do it another way and and it's a must with it would be absolutely anathema to change that &gt;&gt; and we hear it but we become almost numb to it &gt;&gt; and those hundreds and hundreds of people got trampled a few days ago in in in at in Mecca uh uh you know going uh going in a in a great formation of worship and and and uh and we will pray and cast out devils. And these people are sincere by the millions and they're throwing stones at a wall to cast out devils. That is their idea. And it be absolutely I mean you'd be worthy of death to to counter that. They live by that. They die by that. &gt;&gt; That's their And I think of now this God &gt;&gt; who fills all time and space. He must look upon us humans and think &gt;&gt; if he has a head to shake, what are they doing? You know, they're all troubled about this little thing and that little thing. &gt;&gt; Blessed are Blessed are ye when you can believe. Yes. &gt;&gt; Blessed are you when you can identify &gt;&gt; and and and God sends a prophet in the land and he and hears all these people and they sing certain choruses and worship and wave their hand and clap their hands and do all kinds of things and motions and so on and so forth and and people are sitting there and said, "Well, I don't really care for that and I I'm not that way." And so this is God. He looks on the all these little trinkets that people do the religiosity and so on. Listen friends, we're not in a religion. &gt;&gt; It either has to be pure religion or this either has to be truth or and the prophet said if it's God then let him come and declare himself. And that's the kind of God. &gt;&gt; And who is this Melzdc? He says, "If this is God, let God if if if this is God, let that God come forth. &gt;&gt; Let him come forth now." That's why I'm standing here. If he didn't come forth, I I would have very little confidence in this message. But he come forth. &gt;&gt; And one place the prophet said, and I'll be reading some of these, but I don't want to bewilder you. And yet on the other hand it can be overwhelming. But sometimes we need to have our conscience &gt;&gt; pricricked &gt;&gt; and we need to really take take stock of what it is that we believe and why do we do it? Why do we come to church? &gt;&gt; Is well this is where we come to church. I said to my wife driving here I said how many times have we driven this road to come to church? say, "What do we come here for? &gt;&gt; Is this is this, you know, to meet one another?" Surely not. &gt;&gt; Is it just to sing certain kind of songs or we're going to come here this evening and have the Lord's table? Not because we did it before. We're not going to wash feet because well, this is what the prophet said and is what we do. That's part of it. But that's not all of it. Has to be something that is within an individual and s conviction and a reality. So he said he said who is God and I say most humans have some concept of God in the palmer locust cankerorm caterpillar message he said the fatherhood when God dwelt alone he's describing God the fatherhood when God dwelt alone He said, "And who do you say this is?" He was in the beginning by himself, God dwelt alone with his thoughts. In who is this Melzdc? He said, "In the beginning, God dwelt alone with his attributes." This is your God. &gt;&gt; This is who a prophet said he was. He dwelt alone with his attributes. I need to start there. In the spoken words, the original seed, he said, "And and if it is the word of God, God is absolutely honorbound, the God of who is the fountain of all honor, who is the beginning of all honor, who is the source of all honor, who is the source of all truth, has got to stand by what he said." &gt;&gt; Amen. Right? &gt;&gt; If he's the fountain of all of these things and is if this isn't God's word, then who is God? Where is God? Or is there a God? A prophet said that. I'm not just saying that. He he he he bewildered the people &gt;&gt; by asking those kind of questions. Then who is God and where is God? And is there a God? Then in this is who is this mech or this day the scriptures fulfilled if you preach anything and this is where he spoke to brother Mitchell who you've seen the interview I trust I interviewed him at a television station in Rowan Oak West Virginia if you preach anything and it's the gospel truth this is just before he called brother Mitchell out of the audience who had never seen him and he had never been in a meeting. And he had a tumor the size of a man's fist in his lung. And the mining companies had sent him to three hospitals because they didn't know what his what uh what responsibility they would have if he should perish and die. He worked in a coal mine. And he says, and this is what brother Brandham says just prior to it, and if you preach anything and it's the gospel truth, then God is obligated to vindicate that. Is that true? He said, so we want to say yes. Now, if that be so, let the God that wrote the word, &gt;&gt; let the God that made the prophecy, let God, who is God of the word, come forth and prove that he is still God. &gt;&gt; I can assure you the Pope has never said that. &gt;&gt; I can assure you that the prespitators and bishops and so on have never said that. But here's someone with a seventh grade education because it has nothing to do with his education. Let the God who is God, let God, if he be God, let him come and prove that he is God. And he did exactly that. And I'm here to testify he did exactly that. &gt;&gt; And when he, you can listen to it on tape yourself. And he says what he calls out brother Mitchell, he says, and he he actually stresses it. He said, "You have been a mine worker." Do you know why he said that? He never went back to being a mind worker. &gt;&gt; I challenge you. You need to listen to it. You need to hear it on tape. &gt;&gt; You have been a mind worker. Do you know what he became? A pastor of a church. &gt;&gt; Three things. Since there has been man, there has been a hunger in man's heart to find out all of you where you came from and what's his reason of being here. Why are you here? So, I'm here because I have a family. I'm here because I'm married. I'm here because I'm a young person. Why are you here? What is this all about? They said, 'Well, I I'm here. I'm living my billions are living their time out and they're dropped like flies. Just go to the earth. Graveyards are full. You say, "Oh, Brother Bisc, we didn't come to hear that." Well, you better. That's what you're going to hear. If we don't have hope beyond six feet in the ground, we're very, very destitute people. We don't want to be povertystricken of faith. &gt;&gt; We want to be rich in faith. &gt;&gt; But we want to have something to believe. He says, "So these three things, where he came from and what's his reason of being here and where he's going, these are the things that man I have quite a number of people of the seek religion not far from me and I've read some of their material, not their official material, but their they go to worship in the seek temples. and they have the final revelation. I thought, isn't that amazing? I'm sitting up here on the hill and I think I have it and they're down there in the blueberry fields and they have it and I'm quite convinced and they're quite convinced. Is there anything wrong with that? You know, and you're quite convinced. We want to be certain, don't we? And there's only one who can answer that, and that's the one who brought him here. &gt;&gt; The only one who can answer that. You say, "Well, my mother and father brought me here." I'm sorry. That's not the coming I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; What brought you here? &gt;&gt; What brought you to have the hunger to sit here? Who do you say this is? That's the way he was. He was in the beginning by himself and God dwelt alone with his thoughts. He'll never do that again. &gt;&gt; Because his thoughts are being made manifest. &gt;&gt; In other words, manifest. They're being made uh they're coming into view. And that's why we are right here this day. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's good enough to say, "Well, Brother Brandham said that." &gt;&gt; I say he's speaking about a group of people and that's why we're here &gt;&gt; because God had thoughts and they were going to be manifest and that's why we're here. He's making a declaration. That's why I I want to say that friends, if if we're if I'm just here to preach, that's a huge mistake. But that's why I'm here because God had a thought one day. &gt;&gt; And in that thought, he thought of a certain person, a certain individual, and I include myself in that group of people. I must do so because he is the one who who allowed me to hear his voice &gt;&gt; and to make this book. we call the Bible a living a living thing. &gt;&gt; It's a living book. &gt;&gt; And I even asked myself while I was studying this message, it's hard for me to get it out in a hour or two. I've been at least two weeks in this message, agonizing how how to bring it to you because I even asked myself uh all these questions first. Ask myself all of these questions. You know what am I here for? What are we what are we doing? What's our purpose? And the prophet says one can answer that. And that's the one who brought him here. I made that very personal. That's the one the one who brought me here. He's the only one who can answer that. And man has always wanted to see God. And that's the way he was. He was in the beginning by himself. And he dwelt alone with his thoughts. And he'll never do that again because his thoughts are being made manifest. And that's why we are here this day is God fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest. &gt;&gt; The prophet said uh God had a purpose and a hidden Now I'm going to start if you don't mind I'm going to start preaching. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. Many attributes. For those of you the lovers of the message, I want you to be alert now. Many attributes of God were sealed up in this great eternal mysterious God. They were sealed. One that fills all time and space is so far beyond human understanding. In the message identified Christ of all ages, but in this great God Elohim, his attributes there were there was attributes in there to be God. &gt;&gt; That's what I said earlier. There was attributes to be God. I I want you to envision this great being and I must stress it because I want you to go and ponder this. I want you to pray and ask God to make it known. Who can understand God? How can I understand you God unless you come and visit me in a personal way and make me to understand is I even ask God to uh expand my thoughts, &gt;&gt; expand my mind. Let me grasp things. I don't want to be so earthly bound that I can't grasp eternal things. &gt;&gt; There was attributes to be father that was in him. Attributes to be son. attributes to be savior, attributes to be healer. All of these attributes was in God. And if you've ever got eternal life, you were in God's attributes &gt;&gt; because you got eternal life. If you've ever had eternal life, you were in God's attributes then. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why a prophet could say, "That's why we're here." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we're having fellowship not just with one another. We're having fellowship with this eternal God, this mysterious God that no one perhaps can understand. I'm having fellowship with him. How do I know it? It's a reality to me. Well, say, "Well, all kinds of people have realities, but I can tell you one thing. Let me just nail this down. And I want you to hear it real good. There are very few people on the earth, very, very few that have a prophet that have been vindicated that could say, "Let the God who is God come forth." Now, &gt;&gt; unless you find someone else saying that, you better hang on to this till that comes &gt;&gt; because I can I can declare to you, you're not going to hear it &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; You're not going to hear it from a whole bunch of quarters. You're not going to hear it from a whole bunch of churches. You won't hear it. I can't say it, but I can say I believe what God has sent. Like the disciples said, I believe what Jesus was and Jesus is. &gt;&gt; And now he says, all we are today, all we are today is the display of his attributes. That's all we are, brethren. &gt;&gt; That's all you are. &gt;&gt; You might say, I'm this is my father. this is my heritage and this is my roots and all just I just forget it. It's just trinkets. &gt;&gt; It's just something that happened down here. &gt;&gt; You were birthed into a family and you spoke a certain language and you had certain characteristics and and those things those things are important for time but not as far as eternity is concerned. We don't care where you come from. We don't care what color your skin is. We don't care anything about your character or traditions. What we care is that God called you. &gt;&gt; And God declared, "I had you in my thinking. &gt;&gt; I thought of you." &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I have all kinds of frailty and weaknesses, but God is saying, I thought of you, and I know everything about you, and I know your suffering, and I know all the pain, and I know all the pressures you go through. I understand everything. I'm God. Remember, I'm God. &gt;&gt; And today we're the display of his attributes. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be repetitious, but he goes on to say how because of the English word that means an object of worship and so on. It says, "And in him was attributes. It was attributes to be God. Then his attributes to be a father, attributes to be a son, attributes to be a savior." You may think I'm repeating myself. I'm not. These are different different quotes. And often the prophet of God says something slightly different. Attributes to be a healer. All these attributes was in him. These things that has unfolded since then are just his attributes being made manifest. So he says anything that's unfolded since then is just his attributes being made manifest. I want slide one now please. The first thing that he made, prophet God says that he made angels. Now this is uh please go down to slide six if you don't mind. It's this is my fault, not the brothers up there. First thing he made angels and then they worshiped him and that made him go and he started from there. They're looking for it and I'm looking for it. There we are. We're on the same track. He made angels and then they worshiped him and that made him go and he started from there. That's why I made it separate. Is what the messenger has said when angels began to worship him. That was before there was even a molecule in the earth. There was nothing. It was all darkness. There wasn't no sun. nor no moon, no stars, no nothing. Then he was God. As he asked Job, "Where was you when I laid the foundation of the world? See, when the morning stars sang together, the sons of God shouted for joy." Now, where were you? That was back before the earth. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, it's not enough for us to be here in a church in Cloverdale Bible way. I'm pointing you. You were back there. &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life now, you were back there. Then &gt;&gt; you were in God. You're in his attributes. And when he desired to be a father, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He had more in mind than just Jesus as the son of man. He had in mind, I want a family. &gt;&gt; That's why he said to Isaiah, where's my house? &gt;&gt; Where's my household? Where's my people? &gt;&gt; Where's my family? &gt;&gt; That's why we started out in our scripture reading. Now we're the children of God. &gt;&gt; If you just point to your father and mother on earth, how wonderful that is. How wonderful that we have godly parents or whatever more that brought us here. But friends, that is not even in the picture. It is those are instruments that God used to bring you here so that one day you will hear the voice of God in the inner being in the inner self. And you and and I'm here now to declare to you on the basis that God sent a prophet to say you were in his attribute. You were part of that back then. Before there was a sun, before there was a moon, before there was any molecule, any atom, before there was even structure on the earth to bring forth your body, you were in God. If you weren't, you'll never be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, God had a purpose. had a purpose. And if he had a purpose, that means he's going to bring something to view. &gt;&gt; You're not just here to be a housewife or a plumber or a carpenter or businessman or whatever it is you are. You're not here for that. You're you're here because God in his purpose wanted to bring you into view. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to see it. Somebody's going to see it. If you lived your entire life and someone saw God once in you, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; you've been successful. &gt;&gt; You've been successful. You've been faithful. &gt;&gt; And I saw once &gt;&gt; the God, eternal God in you. And God laid a record down in someone's pathway. This is what I'm like. This is the kind of life I give. This is what it's all about. &gt;&gt; Then you've had a purpose in life &gt;&gt; and you've been successful. &gt;&gt; And so now God had a purpose and a hidden a hidden sealed mystery. And that's what I want. He said, I that's what I want to speak to the church this morning. the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living. Oh, isn't this marvelous? He didn't have to have a crowd of people to unfold it down. It has unfolded itself down. &gt;&gt; If you're a believer, the word of God is actually active in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God that has transforming power. You're not transforming in it. You're not act you're not the active force of transforming. I I got to change myself. Give yourself over to God. Let him transform you. &gt;&gt; It has unfolded itself down. It's not dependent upon the efforts of man to the present hour that we're living in. Then you will understand clearly. You see on I believe what is going to be done. The first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people. He couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space, time, and eternity. He could not. He's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious. How could that great being that never did begin? And then after you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into the eternity in a great preacher that was all that and still is. Does this sound like someone who had seven great education in Kentucky? I declare not. This is someone who's connected with all wisdom and the fairy fountain. [Music] This is someone speaking on behalf of the creator &gt;&gt; so that we humans could have some kind of understanding &gt;&gt; so that even if we lose our mind lose our thoughts so we can't grasp it all we can uh we can come to the conclusion it is so glorious I believe it &gt;&gt; there's something within me that responds to that &gt;&gt; then you're hearing his voice &gt;&gt; and you have a capacity to grasp his voice. &gt;&gt; And that even was in his mind. I'll speak, I'll declare things they don't understand. I'll speak it, but they'll believe it because it comes from the word of God. It comes from a vindicated messenger. And they've identified that that messenger does the same things that Jesus did. &gt;&gt; I think so marvelous. It was a woman at the well. How he he could do such a simple thing as tell her her life, tell her a few details of her life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The one you're with is not your husband, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You've had five. &gt;&gt; He he didn't go into the details, but just think about having five partners in life, five husbands. Didn't work out. Think about the agony that that think about what she went through. He didn't detail all that and say, "My, you've gone through such a hard time and I I feel so sorry for you and I I I'm I'm got the truth and I got compassion. I can show you a better way." No, he just said, "You've had five and the one you're with is not your husband." She flashed. She had something that connected with that. She did. She couldn't understand how that was coming to her. How did he find that out? She didn't have that kind of uh understanding, but she said, "You're the Messiah. You're a prophet of God." She said, "I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things. I that speak to thee am he." A man standing there asking for a drink of water &gt;&gt; and said that he would give her to drink and hasn't even got a bucket. I hasn't got a rope to lay it down to get some water. Are you greater than Jacob? No, she forgot all of that now. &gt;&gt; And the prophet makes such a statement. She didn't when she was heart was revealed and at this sign of Messiah, she did not say Belub. &gt;&gt; That's what the world said. That's what so many said. Theologians said bells above. &gt;&gt; Religious people said bells above. &gt;&gt; But when this pro woman who is a failure in life, a failure in marriages, when she heard it, oh, there was something in her. And he was not prepared. The attribute of God wasn't saying you're a failure, you're a mess. the attribute of God. When she said, he said, "I that speak to thee am he." She dropped her water bucket, ran into the city, come see a man that told me all that ever I did. He never told her all that ever she did. He told her just what she needed to hear. That's right. &gt;&gt; And then in this day, I I'm reading a message. I didn't know uh it had a message here. The mighty God unveiled before us. It was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1964. I was supposed to be in that meeting. And the president of the full gospel businessman of Toronto asked me to go and be with him. And even he did invite me to be his vice president in Toronto, the Christian businessman. I knew him quite well. I knew him very well, in fact. So, I'm reading it I'm reading it different. I'm reading it as though, yeah, I I I could have been there. And when he came back, he was heartsick. He said they had their testimonies of all their successes and money making and they had all of these things and they squeeze it right on to the end and give brother about 10 minutes. And I went to the back of the book. He doesn't even call any. They don't even see the sign. 1964 just using to gather a crowd of people using his name. But here you are. You're we're not here because of that. &gt;&gt; And he gone beyond the cycle of trillions and trillions of light space. Scientific words actually scientific verbiage. These are the these are the words scientists use. But what he wanted to do now I'm back to where I was earlier and as I said I have Have we got a little time? &gt;&gt; He loved Don't ever forget this phrase. That's why you're here. He loved fatherhood &gt;&gt; for he was a father. Says and a prophet saying he was a father but he hadn't been a father yet. And the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man. And in this day that you're living, he took a redeemed son of man to reveal the son of man &gt;&gt; that God was speaking about. &gt;&gt; That's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man. He wanted to express himself. That was his one of his great three-fold purposes was to express himself to identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ because that was the son that was going to everything had to flow from him. And that's why it says by him were all things made that was made and without him was nothing made that was made. Are you all right &gt;&gt; for another few moments? &gt;&gt; Okay. A father is one. There's nobody here. But what had a father? Maybe you didn't know who your father is, but everybody's had a father. Hello. &gt;&gt; You actually came by someone's seed. But this messenger said this and he said it right at the end of his ministry and he begins to talk about the genes. And you hear so much about the genes today. Brother Brandham, I've said this before, I want to say it again in this atmosphere. Brother Brandham referred to the gene about 20 times that I can find in his entire ministry. once in 1964, 20 times in 1965, and 18 of those times in the last four services. And he's saying, and you want to go and read that 18 times because he's saying, "As you were in a genie, your father, as you were in a genie, your father, your grandfather, so were you in the loins of God." &gt;&gt; Is that poetic license or is that a reality? &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, that eternal life was in the loins of God at that time. And God has brought you here. Your mother and father were they they were the instruments that give you human birth, human life. But God is the instrument. God is the one who has ordained eternal life. &gt;&gt; And that's why a messenger says if you ever had eternal life, you always had it. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't believe in pre-existence. You always had it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou if thou canst believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now he was the only begotten son of almighty God. We are sons by adoption through him. &gt;&gt; That's why everything is through Christ in Christ. But he is the only begotten son of God. Adam was a son. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to listen very close. &gt;&gt; Adam was a son. He was He was God's creative son. But this was his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; God's begotten son in power to transform. He says Adam was his first created son. &gt;&gt; Jesus was his only begotten son. See, he was begotten by a woman. &gt;&gt; But Adam was right straight from the hand of God in creation. &gt;&gt; Now listen real close. This is a great blessing to me. Jesus was his begotten son, but it wasn't so from the beginning. His begotten son. And God was in Jesus reconciling the world to himself because he said, "It's not me that doeth the works. It's my father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works." &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God quoted that very, very scripture because it had exactly the same reference. It's not me that doeth the works. It's my father that dwelleth in me that doeth the works. &gt;&gt; Now, you have to deal with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how close God came to us. &gt;&gt; And then that was to convey that God is in his people. Jesus was saying, "The Father will be in me and I will be in you." &gt;&gt; Listen friends, that's what we've got to get. We've got to we've got to understand that if I asked you, was that deity God? Was that deity in Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; You'd readily say yes. And now what happens to that deity? Does it kind of get lost in the transition from Christ to you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're afraid to say hallelujah, I'll say hallelujah for you. &gt;&gt; When God's attribute of fatherhood, now I spent a long time. Stay with me real close now. When God's attribute, he loved fatherhood. When that finally came to fruition and Jesus was begotten, son of God, born of a woman because sin came that way. If you dispense with the serpent seed, you've dispenseed with the whole meaning of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Sin came that way. And Jesus the remedy came that way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he was issued into the world, the Bible says, "And suddenly, &gt;&gt; there was a multitude of heavenly host of heavenly hosts praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest. &gt;&gt; On earth, peace and good will to men." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The world at large hasn't got it. But there's a group of people &gt;&gt; that this was speaking for. Angels spoke on behalf of us that would believe. &gt;&gt; If you can believe it, blessed art thou. &gt;&gt; Try hard to believe it. &gt;&gt; Don't just have a flash in the pan. Say, "Oh, that was a wonderful service." That isn't what I want. I want you to believe what he has spoken, &gt;&gt; what God has said. &gt;&gt; When this son, when Adam was birthed, right directly from the hand of God, there was no host of angels, &gt;&gt; no one was praising God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when this babe &gt;&gt; born in blood &gt;&gt; from a mother's womb, &gt;&gt; a little girl that believes that even be it unto me according to your word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet comes in this times and says the the words of the prophets, the words of the prophets, the virgin shall conceived hooked and lodged into her womb when she believed it. &gt;&gt; If the words of the prophets would hook into her womb, wouldn't the words of this prophet hook into your heart? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't be too dull now. be on the edge of your seat and say, "Oh, speak it, preacher. Speak it. Speak it. I want to believe it. I want to hear it. I need to hear it." &gt;&gt; You've spent a long time. You've put a lot of You've put a lot of emphasis on this foundation. Now say it. &gt;&gt; Let it hook into my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it anchor in my soul. Let this transforming power, let this attribute of the Almighty &gt;&gt; come down &gt;&gt; manifest itself here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't look at this little fella behind the pulpit. It has nothing to do with it. It's the one that's beside you. It's a God Almighty. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, he either sent a prophet or he didn't send a prophet. This prophet's either vindicated or he's not vindicated. If he is vindicated, where is God? Who is God? &gt;&gt; What's saying when God had completed his creation of Adam, there was no angelic host singing glory to God in the highest. But now he had a begotten son &gt;&gt; by which he would bring many sons to glory in Hebrews 2:10. For it became him became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things which is Jesus Christ in bringing many sons to glory. &gt;&gt; No wonder the angels cried out. No wonder heaven couldn't contain itself. No wonder all the angels that have worshiped him now burst forth. They perhaps they never saw it, but they realized they couldn't contain themselves. Glory to God in the highest on earth peace and good will towards men. Now a begotten son was born. Sin's question was answered. The devil was unveiled and uncovered. The devil, he was completely uh uh made powerless. And now sons of God and daughters of God would be gathered to the father. [Applause] the answer to the attribute &gt;&gt; in bringing many sons under glory to make the captain of their faith, captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. And then Jesus quoted the scripture and again in Hebrews 12:13 I mean 23 and 14. And again I will put my trust in him. And again behold I in the children which God hath given me. &gt;&gt; For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood. Hello. &gt;&gt; As much as &gt;&gt; exactly as the children are partakers of flesh and blood &gt;&gt; and you have it. That's the way you were born. &gt;&gt; You've got that circulatory system of blood in you. And it says, "For as much as the children are partakers in of flesh and blood, he also himself &gt;&gt; took part of the same." &gt;&gt; He had to become flesh and blood. And now he had now the father, the answer to the attribute of the eternal God. Now he had an answer to it. And the angels burst forth. And it says he had to partake of the same that through death &gt;&gt; he might destroy him that had the power of death. That is the devil. &gt;&gt; No wonder the angel sang there was war in heaven one day. &gt;&gt; And a third of the population of heaven uh was taken out down and cast to the earth. And here they are. &gt;&gt; You feel their presence every day. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Every day, this demon and all of his angels are hounding you and trying to get you to doubt and disbelieve. I say he came in the flesh, the begotten son of God, and destroyed the works of the devil. &gt;&gt; And I believe that. You have a right to the mind of God. &gt;&gt; You have a right to the word of God. &gt;&gt; You have a right to the attributes of God. They belong to you. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I am a son of God. I am a daughter of the living God. I came from eternity and I will go back to eternity. I possess eternal life." &gt;&gt; Will you say that? I possess eternal life. &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. I possess eternal life. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He took part of the same that he might destroy the works of the devil. who being the brightness of his glory and the express image I'm coming to that now the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power &gt;&gt; when he had himself purged our sins hello &gt;&gt; purged your sins &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high and the express image I'm coming home the express image is used of Christ but it's used of this is this what it means the express image is the engraving tool sharp engraving or carving it's the mark stamped on or an impression &gt;&gt; pressed the exact expression or image of a person or a thing. Precise reproduction &gt;&gt; in every respect. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? &gt;&gt; The stamped image. Is that easy? No, it's not all. He through sufferings. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. Not that he had to learn to be obedient, but by the things he suffered, he proved he was obedient. &gt;&gt; Nothing could deter him. In the church age book, the prophet said, "I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed &gt;&gt; with the word in our midst. &gt;&gt; It's not that the word isn't here. It is not that the stamp isn't here. Are we allowing the pressure &gt;&gt; of the press of the stamp? Say, "Oh, this is so hard." Say, "Pour it on, Lord. &gt;&gt; Pour it on. Nothing can deter me. Nothing can take me down." The God of eternity, the God of the universe, the God that fills all time and space. You think that these little things that we have are going to deter him or change his mind about his will whom he has will and he has purposed already purposed it. &gt;&gt; The express image it comes from another word called graph. The first word is character. [Applause] This book here happens to be a big selection of characters. Is that English? That's English, isn't it? English characters. Some may have it in Arabic, some may have it in Hindu, some may have it in Chuba, some may have it in Chinese. That's why we're busy making it. And then a person, many person, and this is what it says. The letter killth. &gt;&gt; The letter can actually kill or destroy. But the spirit who wrote this, the author, if you have the author &gt;&gt; and then you read a certain thing and it starts to a sharp tool starts to engrave. Oh. Oh. and through he became obedient to the things that he suffered. It's not easy always to be a Christian. It's not always easy to be a believer and people say and they turn aside and walk away from you but it's a sharp tool the very word it's a character and grapho it is it is what is written it is the graphics it's the characters in the graphics and and and this is the this is the Bible but I can tell you and I say without hesitation without apology the message which reveals this the message which makes this alive. &gt;&gt; And when I when I read it, I'm so glad that someone put it into language that I understand. &gt;&gt; And I've looked into the faces of people in other countries, particularly when I was in Africa, Brother Daniel, and years ago, and and they looked at my face and they said, "Oh, you have it on tapes and you have it on books." Oh, I I wish we had it. That's why I have such a passion. &gt;&gt; It has never left me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether a man wants to cast it down, whether he wants to put it in a waste basket, or we drive into a gas station in Cape Town, South Africa, and and and a a a man who's serving uh a black man is serving fuel. He's sitting on a little stool reading a message book. I said, "Good. That's good book." He said, "Yes." I said, "Where'd you get it?" He said, "In the Someone threw it out of their car into a waste bucket." And so I picked it out of the waste bucket and I'm reading it. I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; However God wants to get it, &gt;&gt; but there's characters, &gt;&gt; sharp characters. Sometime we read it and say, "Oh, I'm a woman." That's just s that's so hard to take. And next man says, "I'm a man and I'm a I'm a young person." And oh, that is so hard to take. Let that sharp instrument character. And that is exactly what the scripture is saying. He was a perfect image, the express image of the son of God. He didn't come that way by accident. &gt;&gt; He didn't come that way just by going the easy route. &gt;&gt; And that was why when God spoke to him through a prophecy uh in in a French language said because you have chosen the harder way. &gt;&gt; You think it was easy? No, it wasn't easy. Everybody chose a harder way. &gt;&gt; I'll just I want to finish in a few minutes. I would just say dear friends, don't go out of this service and ever look on the message the same. Don't ever look on the word of God the same. Look for the that part that character that will develop character by the sharp tool. And I might say, you know what, it doesn't just have to come across the pulpit. No, it doesn't have to. The seed in you has a compelling force. And that compelling force is such that you cannot give it up. &gt;&gt; You've tried to walk away from it. You've said, "I this is too hard. I'll turn aside." You just can't turn aside. There's something within you that maintains the heat, the pressure. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And today, brother Brandham speaks of I want to speak of the son of man. 17 Luke 17:30. He said he had to fulfill the rest of it. Oh, hello dear friends beloved believers. Here we are. We're no different. You're no different at all than the believers that the Bible is written about. You're no different at all than the believers that are in the book of Acts. You're no different at all than the believers that suffered and died in the persecution. And we still may have that. I have a I have an email here which I can't read for you. And brother Tim is wondering what how much we can say. See this here? That is the testimony of the Catholic priest that came out of Uganda. I received it yesterday. You might like to have read it, but I can't let you read it. But I can tell you that he's in hiding just now, and we would like to get him to Kenya if possible just to have him removed. He was poisoned by the church and they had to call doctors doctors and when the doctor left he left his cell phone and that's how he was able to use the cell phone and get the pastor. I can't give you any details. really. I was born in a Catholic home. My relatives are still Catholics. My father was a alter boy at the at the Catholic church. And he would stand and look at the Bible on the shelf, but they were not the people were not allowed to read it. And he yearned so much to read that book. And one day behind the horses when they were turning over the furrow of a plow, something he said just came and just struck him in his chest and he fell to his knees in the fresh dirt, threw his hands to the air, and he said, "Oh God, if there is a God, alder boy, if there is a God, if you'll ever let me know that I can be forgiven and have my guilt, be forgiven my guilt, I'll I'll accept deputy. That very day, a few years later, he was invited into a home. I'm making this very brief. And he had seen two girls walking on the street, walking across the street in front of our little clapboard house in northern Saskatchewan. And those girls, you girls that may be young girls, young fellows, you never know this. And he saw these two girls and he looked on them. He said, "They look like angels if I could only have what they have." And a lady contacted him and said, "I understand do some carpenter work. I need some shelves built in my kitchen." He went over to the house, a little wee town of about 150 people. He went over to the house. When he walked in, there was the two girls. &gt;&gt; And she told him what kind of shelf she'd like to have built. And uh after after a few minutes, he was ready to go. And she said, "Mr. Biscll, have you ever been saved? &gt;&gt; He said, I don't know what that means. She said, that means your your sins can be forgiven. Oh, he said, if I could only know that my sins would be forgiven. &gt;&gt; And she said, we having church in a little in a house here. It was the early early flames of Pentecost was reaching northern British northern Saskatchewan. And he said, if you come, we have a service there Sunday. He said he related what happened as he plowed behind the horses and he told her. He said, "I promised God the day I would hear it, I would be I would accept him that very day." And I guess they slid out a couple of kitchen chairs. All I can tell you, I was about four years old and my father got up a transformed man. Totally transformed. Everything left him. The drink left him. The cigarettes left him if he smoked. I never saw him smoke, but he did they did make their own home brew and everything left him. He was a good dancer. He never ever had any struggle with anything. It was gone. &gt;&gt; That's a transforming power. My mother, staunch, staunch Catholic woman. And divorce or separation was unheard of. And my father went up to the attic in our little woodhouse and prayed for five weeks. And my mother was gloriously saved. &gt;&gt; And according to my father, she was poisoned. She died at 32. Town nurse who was her friend from the Catholic community administered the medication. The pharmacist said that he would send the town nurse over. I've never related this to you. Just you know, we don't have to talk about history. We don't have to talk about 68 million. I lost my mother at 32 years old and a few years later because my father spent his entire herit inheritance and send tracks of converted nuns and converted priests. And this this this that I have we received yesterday involves some of the same things and converted Catholic priests and converted nuns and how they got converted and how the gospel came to them. Hallelujah. And I was working at a store at a Dawson home furnishings owned by two rigid rigid uh Lutheran men and we would talk about spiritual things often. They knew me. I knew them very very well and I was working for them. I came to store I came to the store one morning to work and they said one of one of the Catholic priests in the city visited us last night because my father had scattered these to every household and every farm. He spent his entire inheritance and the country went up like an atomic bomb. A woman called my stepmother. She breathing on the phone. She said, "I'd like to speak to Fred Biscll." My mother was very stepmother was very, very quiet. She said, "He's not in just now." She said, "I'd like to burn that pig." We're not going back in history, folks. &gt;&gt; You're looking at Ed Biscll. It cost me my mom. And my mom turned a little had nausea on her stomach and I stood in the doorway of the of the bedroom and a doctor was looking in her eyes and he said, "I'll just I'll prescribe some medication for her to hold food on her stomach and I believe she'll be fine." And my father went to the pharmacist who is also Catholic. And while he's mixing, they mix the medications in those days many times. And he's mixing the medication. And he said to my father, I I'll have the town nurse come over this evening and administer the medication. And my father said, "Oh, uh, he was just a simple man from the farm. He said, uh, the doctor didn't say anything about the town nurse having to come." No, he said, "I'll have to send the town nurse over and I'll send her this evening." And she came over. That town nurse happened to be my mother's dearest friend back from the farming community. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Both staunch Catholics and she came over that night and administered the medication. My mother never woke up. She was unconscious in the morning and they raced her by ambulance to the hospital, Catholic hospital and she was dead the next morning. That's brother Bis story. Do I believe this man's story? I guess I do. Somehow they can have all of their robes &gt;&gt; and all of their tradition and all of their wonderful things and all of their wealth and all of their power, but in the heart, &gt;&gt; what kind of book do they read &gt;&gt; to produce that kind of a thing? &gt;&gt; And they persecuted the church. And the prophet of God says it's the archeneemy &gt;&gt; of the believers of the saints of God. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to know I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I was raised without a mother. I don't want your sympathy. I want you to believe the truth. And this message has the capacity to attract a lot of persecution. And you think, I lost my friends. Oh, forget it. I think I'm having a hard time. I say, forget it. &gt;&gt; We don't know what persecution is. And I didn't tell you when the priest had visited my employers and said, "Until Mr. Biscll is gone, there's 2,000 Catholics in this city and not no one will patronize Dawson Home Furnishings until he's gone." And the next morning, they told me they'd been visited. What had been said? We would like you to put an ad, a quarter page ad in the paper. We will pay for it and disassociate yourself from what your father's distributing. I said, I may not use the same method that he's used using, but I cannot deny the things that are in the packages. &gt;&gt; And I said, I won't put you under the pressure of laying me off or firing me. I will leave. I left and I came down to the native Indians. That's my story. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. You were made. You were made for these words. &gt;&gt; Not what I'm preaching. You were made for this message. &gt;&gt; You were actually made for it in God's mind. He had you formed. &gt;&gt; He had you with certain associates. He had you living beside somebody. He had you working beside somebody. He had you going to church beside somebody. He gave you an invitation. God gave you an invitation. God in that person gave you an invitation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You read a book, you read the scripture, something and then it quickened you. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the prophet of God never tried to convince me about the message ever. &gt;&gt; He read Malachi. He he quoted Malachi 4. And I just said, "Of course." &gt;&gt; He quoted four scriptures on false anointed ones. I said, "Of course. Why in the world couldn't I see that? He quoted scripture, &gt;&gt; but the scripture in his mouth became a different book. &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to say to you tonight. That's not a figment of my imagination. That's absolutely the truth. When you hear the words out of the mouth of Jesus Christ or one of his servants, it will sound different than if you just read it yourself. Or you may read it yourself if the Holy Spirit quickens it to you. And then I want to conclude simply by saying this and I'm going to be done. I'm sorry to hold you. I have a scripture I want to read. My my I shortened up I shortened up what I have to say. But there's a scripture my my my there's a scripture in Revelation and the scripture tells us and I heard is it where are you listening &gt;&gt; just when I close and as I heard is it where a voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah &gt;&gt; for the Lord God omnipotent reignth that's what I'm talking about &gt;&gt; let us be glad &gt;&gt; let us rejoice &gt;&gt; and give honor to him &gt;&gt; for the marriage of the lamb has come &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; there was no such thing when Eve was brought to Adam and the same God came down and took her out from Adam and brought the woman to the man. Nobody sang. Nobody rejoiced. No multitude rejoiced. But when this multitude, when this group of people, and you will hear it for yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Roy, when we come to the marriage supper, there's going to be singing. &gt;&gt; It won't depend on you. There's going to be shouting. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord God omnipotent reignth. &gt;&gt; His attributes, &gt;&gt; his attributes are coming. &gt;&gt; The begotten son and his wife are being united. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have I gone over the end? Well, I tell you what, friends. To me, it's just so wonderful. It's just so wonderful. The purpose of God. What are we doing here? It's part of the purpose of God. I don't know the fullness of it. I don't know what's going to happen the next five minutes. Maybe we'll all be out of here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And just so that you'll know, he was made the perfect image, but this might surprise you. And Jesus said unto him, speaking to Satan, do you know that Satan tried to take the word? He tried to take it and use it. He tried to take the carving tool &gt;&gt; and use it on the word himself. He tried to improve Jesus Christ. He said, "Fall down. It's written." That's what he said. It is written. And Jesus answered him, said to him, "It is written again, thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." And then Jesus said, "Get hence, Satan, for it is written, "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve." You You might think that that's just back there. No, sir. It's right now today. He'll use every kind of economic tactic to get us to bow down to our our profession or bow down to whatever and and and rob us and steal from us. &gt;&gt; You might think I better get away from that. No, I'm going to pour it on. &gt;&gt; You must remain the master of your economics, &gt;&gt; the master of your education, &gt;&gt; the master of your worship. Can you say amen to it? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And there may be a time where you have to say, Satan, it is written, &gt;&gt; get hence. [Music] &gt;&gt; For this is he whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger, &gt;&gt; and said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer. The son of man goeth as it is written of him and woe unto the man by whom the son of man is betrayed. &gt;&gt; And he said, "For it is written, I will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered." Do you think the shepherd enjoyed the smiting? No. But it was written &gt;&gt; and the sharp tool was there and he said, "Here I am. I will not run from my responsibility &gt;&gt; of being the shepherd of the flock." Oh, glory to our great shepherd. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer." And we say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; At is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone, and the seals came." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it was written, &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be. &gt;&gt; Are you tired of it? But as written, eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard. &gt;&gt; Neither hath it entered into the heart of man. Hello man, &gt;&gt; raise your hands. &gt;&gt; It's not entered into our hearts the things that God has prepared prepared for them that love him. &gt;&gt; Then said I, lo, I come in the volume of the book. It is written of me. And we want to say, "Lo, I come in the volume of this word of God for this hour. Hallelujah. I will shy away from none of it. For it is written of me, I'm a believer. And it is written. I'm closing now. It is written. I will put my laws into their mind. &gt;&gt; I will write them on their hearts &gt;&gt; and I will be their God &gt;&gt; and they shall be my people. And I say, "It is written, &gt;&gt; and thus it shall be." &gt;&gt; Will you stand to your feet, please? Wonder if we could have the musicians. Not going to keep you because we our service is at 4:00. the saints, you that have come from Seattle, how I appreciate you coming from the Seattle Tacoma Reon area. I want to thank you for your prayers that have prayed for me during this week and I have certainly given my best to this message and I trust that you will go away from this place thinking about how great is my God. &gt;&gt; How great is his name? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we love you. &gt;&gt; I say that we love you because I include myself with this body of people, with those that are perhaps streaming. And I pray and ask that there will be such a divine presence that you will so present yourself with your children that they may indeed have that comfort of your nearness that they may know God that you understand. and for those that are going through a difficult time, for those that may be at a time in sorrow. And I pray for our beloved brother in Uganda. Oh God, make a way where there is no way. I pray that you'll come on his behalf. Father, let him know that you are the protector of the sheep. &gt;&gt; You will not allow anything undo and unwarranted to come to him. And yet you do not protect us from every hardship. We we that are going through hardships. I pray that you'll give grace. Grace more abundantly that we may be joyful and happy &gt;&gt; in the hardship. Oh God, whatever it is, we're not here to escape hardship. We're here to face it and confront it and say with the songwriter, I'm going through Jesus. I'm going through. Oh, we bless your holy name. Thank you for this time we've had together. Thank you for your word. Thank you for the truth of your message, oh God, and how you've confirmed it to us. Jesus, be glorified, I pray in your holy name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing. How great is our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] the the chorus, please. [Music] How great is this man forever [Music] and all of my [Music] you put your trust in How great are his word? He is one that was he [Music] anointed ministry. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to sing also I want to do thy will oh God a different tempo and if you just would like to consecrate yourself as I did as I I was singing this at home I want to do thy will oh Lord thy will [Music] I want you. I will alone. Take me. Take me. Oh me and make me. I want to do. I will. [Music] I'd like to before we sing it once again. I'd like you to look at the words on the on the screen, please. And will you read them with me? I want to do thy will, oh Lord. I want to do thy will, oh Lord. Take me, break me, mold me, and make me. I want to do thy will. Is that your desire? Take me. That's why I sing it now. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take me, break me, mold me, and make me. I want to do thy will, oh God. Just once more and then we're going to be dismissed. I want to do thy will, oh Lord. I want to do. I will [Music] take me. Break me [Music] and make me. I want to do my understanding. Some of you may be asking and wondering within your own heart things that brother Brand Brother Biscll said today I've never heard before why did he hold that back so long. Well, I tell you what, friend. There just a lot of things, a lot of things that you just hold back. Then there may come a right moment and today was the right moment for the testimony I gave that little segment of my life. Friends, we're not we're not preaching sermons. These are realities. &gt;&gt; This message is a reality and it has the answer. &gt;&gt; It has the answer for our lives. We'll pray. Heavenly Father, I thank you for this kind audience, respectful, listening, hearing, absorbing, taking it and internalizing your word. Lord Jesus, I pray for every brother and sister in this building as we're preparing for Lord's table. I pray that you will dismiss us now with your grace. Lord Jesus, as you walked with the disciples, you ended your message. You ended your parable, whatever it was, then the people went and pondered. I'm asking that the Holy Spirit which we have received cause us to think about these things to ponder them and our pondering will cause us to open our hearts to you and say, "Oh Lord, I want to do thy will. Oh God, take me, Lord, break me, mold me, and make me. I want to do thy will. Bless the people I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." Amen. Amen. I want to just say you're dismissed and thank you for being patient with me. It took a little time to lay the foundation. Shake hands with one another and bid them God's speed and we'll see you at 4:00. Lord, God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
