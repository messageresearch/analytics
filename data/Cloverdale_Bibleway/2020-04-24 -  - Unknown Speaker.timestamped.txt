[1:12] I was in my home in Victoria British
[1:20] Columbia when I received a phone call
[1:24] from brother Branham and he was saying
[1:27] that I believe we're going to have a
[1:29] good hunt a brother Eddie we're gonna
[1:32] have a good hunt I had a dream or vision
[1:35] and he began to tell me a little bit
[1:38] about it and said that he would give me
[1:41] the full details when we met so when we
[1:45] met in Dawson Creek he said I had this
[1:47] dream or vision he said if it was a
[1:50] vision
[1:50] it'll happen exactly like that and in
[1:54] the vision he said there were two or
[1:56] three small fellows on the hunt I had
[2:01] arranged the hunt and there was only
[2:03] three of us including brother Branham
[2:07] brother bud silhouette brother branham
[2:10] and myself we were the three brothers
[2:13] Southwest Sun Blaine was not able to go
[2:17] on the hunt because he was in the far
[2:19] north in the Arctic on a survey crew and
[2:23] would not be able to be back for the
[2:26] hunt well so I thought well maybe it was
[2:32] just a dream I don't know but he brother
[2:35] Branham said we saw I saw this large
[2:38] animal and its horns trying to went back
[2:41] on its head and I said oh that may be a
[2:44] caribou he said well I don't know I
[2:47] haven't seen a caribou before but he
[2:49] said this was a dark chocolate brown
[2:51] animal
[2:53] I said no I said that caribou are like
[2:57] battleship gray and he said well no this
[3:01] was chocolate brown and he wouldn't he
[3:04] wouldn't stray from that description at
[3:07] all it was a dark chocolate brown animal
[3:10] so then he said there was in this in
[3:16] this vision or dream I saw one of the
[3:20] young men his hands were like this he
[3:23] said and they were spread out he said
[3:26] there was no hair on the arms on hands
[3:30] he said I would say and he kind of
[3:32] stopped like that looked up he said
[3:34] probably about eighteen eighteen years
[3:38] old now I would like to encourage the
[3:41] viewers to be real attentive to the
[3:45] details because this vision was six
[3:50] hours in the fulfillment and he said one
[3:54] of my one of my buddies was in a green
[3:59] checkered shirt well I had had a green
[4:03] checkered shirt and I had told my wife
[4:06] to before the hunt I said just throw
[4:09] that away because it had been tore and
[4:12] so on several times around here on the
[4:14] pocket my husband was going hunting
[4:17] he had this pretty good shirt green
[4:22] checkered shirt but it was torn around
[4:26] the pocket and I had mended it several
[4:30] times and he said go and get me another
[4:35] shirt it was a nice shirt doe skin soft
[4:40] nice hunting shirt and I said okay but I
[4:45] just didn't have time I didn't have a
[4:47] car I had the little girls you have to
[4:50] take a bus into town so I mended it
[4:55] again the best I could and I put it into
[4:59] his duffel bag and a way you went we got
[5:03] up to Dawson Creek I asked
[5:06] brother branham if he would tell the
[5:08] vision to my father so he related the
[5:12] whole vision that this dark chocolate
[5:15] brown animal and he had gotten that
[5:17] animal and had gotten another a grizzly
[5:22] bear at the same time and for me that
[5:25] was a shock I thought I'd lived in the
[5:29] north I had never gotten a grizzly bear
[5:31] myself and I thought that was
[5:34] outstanding
[5:35] and then we journeyed on the way up the
[5:37] Alaskan Highway to brother bud south
[5:39] which place and when we drove into the
[5:43] yard here all the children came out and
[5:47] including Blaine his son who was
[5:49] supposed to be in the Arctic and I said
[5:51] well your Blaine I thought you were away
[5:54] up and you wouldn't be able to go on
[5:56] this hunt well he said he just came back
[5:59] a couple of days ago and I asked brother
[6:02] self-weight we'll Blaine be able to come
[6:05] on the hunt well yeah he thought he
[6:07] better come on the hunt with us so
[6:11] suddenly now I saw that we were two or
[6:15] three little fellows on the trip and
[6:21] Blaine was fixing a little harness on
[6:24] the side of one of the buildings and I
[6:27] was standing there with him just the two
[6:29] of us and I asked him I said Blaine how
[6:31] old are you he said 18 why I said well I
[6:36] was just curious to know now we had a
[6:38] young fellow and he was 18 years old and
[6:41] myself and when brother branham was
[6:45] giving the vision I asked him to tell by
[6:48] the Southwick and his family at the
[6:50] supper table tell him about the vision
[6:53] so he got to the dark chocolate brown
[6:56] animal I said brother bud I always
[7:00] thought that caribou was a dark
[7:04] battleship gray well he said you know
[7:07] that is strange he said all every
[7:10] terrible that I've seen on the north
[7:13] side of the highway
[7:14] the Alaskan Highway has been a kind of a
[7:19] battleship gray and he used the same
[7:21] words he said and they are a bush
[7:25] caribou and all the terrible on the
[7:27] south side and west of the highway has
[7:32] been mountain caribou and they're kind
[7:35] of a dark chocolate brown color and I
[7:39] said well where are we going he said
[7:41] well we're going on the south side of
[7:43] the highway so things were coming
[7:46] together and I there was more weight to
[7:50] it being a vision and our being a dream
[7:52] and I the only thing was a young land
[7:58] with the chocolate or with a checkered
[8:01] shirt and when we got up to make our
[8:06] camp we made our camp and way down the
[8:11] valley it would be to my right
[8:16] we saw the on the skyline there were a
[8:20] few caribou and some mountain shape and
[8:24] so brother Southwick said well tomorrow
[8:28] I think that we should probably go up
[8:31] there it was probably two or three miles
[8:32] and so the next day we made our way up
[8:39] there and we got up on the ridge and ran
[8:44] into a few caribou and they scattered
[8:47] and one ran down this way and so I went
[8:52] on my we all split up and Blaine went
[8:56] one direction and brother branham and
[8:58] bud went another direction and I went
[9:01] one direction and I found a young
[9:04] terrible right I was needing meat and I
[9:08] shot that caribou and it was just dark
[9:11] chocolate brown and so Blaine came by
[9:14] and we dressed that caribou out and then
[9:18] we went back and met together and then
[9:21] we climbed up on a mountain ridge and
[9:24] brother branham said on this
[9:27] this vision there was a great panoramic
[9:30] and he moved his arm this way and he
[9:34] said unless great panoramic and then he
[9:37] says my friend in that checkered shirt
[9:39] was way down this way towards camp and
[9:43] camp was two three miles this direction
[9:46] and he said he was waiting there and on
[9:50] the way there I he said I got this large
[9:55] caribou dark chocolate brown and he said
[9:59] on the way then we saw a grizzly bear on
[10:02] the mountain and God gave me that animal
[10:06] in one shot and I was just kind of
[10:11] speechless and then while the vision was
[10:18] being fulfilled we sat on this Ridge and
[10:22] I just looked at this beautiful
[10:24] panoramic I can say that I wasn't really
[10:28] conscious of every detail of the vision
[10:31] but it was just we were caught up in and
[10:35] the beauty of the moment and the great
[10:37] mountain peaks on this side on the left
[10:40] side and spurring off onto our ridges
[10:44] and we were eight or lunch on this one
[10:46] Ridge and brother branham said what is
[10:50] that over there her brother bud and they
[10:54] took his binoculars there was two great
[10:59] caribou animals Bulls laying on our
[11:02] mountain glacier I think laying on a
[11:06] glacier because there's less bugs and
[11:09] there it's very nice and cool and they
[11:13] were laying there kind of sleeping I
[11:16] think
[11:16] and so brother bud laid out a plan he
[11:19] said well Blaine he said why don't you
[11:23] take brother Eddie and take the horses
[11:26] and go and get his meat and then journey
[11:31] down this way to this dry creek bed and
[11:34] wait for us and we'll come down and meet
[11:38] you so I suggested that
[11:41] we wait till we see if they got this
[11:44] animal which in about another half hour
[11:46] they did and came up over the ridge and
[11:50] got this large caribou bull animal and
[11:55] so then we went and got my meat and we
[11:59] journeyed down here to this dry creek
[12:01] bed towards camp what was strange that
[12:06] morning when we had just left the tent I
[12:12] fell into a creek and I thought my
[12:16] clothes wet and I said to the brothers
[12:19] just wait here and I will run home I'll
[12:22] run back to the tent which was a short
[12:24] very short distance and I and I opened
[12:29] up my duffel bag and there was this
[12:31] green checkered shirt and when you got
[12:33] up hunting and had that little mishap in
[12:37] the water and had to go back to the tent
[12:40] and open up his bag and there was the
[12:44] green checkered shirt and he said I told
[12:47] Ruth to get me a new shirt and she
[12:51] didn't do it but I didn't know that it
[12:55] was all a part of the vision you just do
[12:58] things without even thinking that
[13:01] there's anything spiritual tied to it I
[13:05] put it on and that's the shirt I had I
[13:08] had a green check Richard the vision and
[13:11] all of the details just it was not in my
[13:15] mind whatsoever I was cold and wet and I
[13:19] changed and and then I ran up to catch
[13:22] up with the other brothers and away we
[13:25] went
[13:25] so when we went down to this dry creek
[13:29] bed I had on that checkered shirt
[13:33] we waited Blaine and I we waited for
[13:36] about half an hour to an hour and Blaine
[13:41] said if they're not here in about
[13:44] another half hour he said I'm gonna go
[13:46] and find them and in the vision I was
[13:49] alone waiting for them another half hour
[13:56] they still weren't there he said so I'm
[13:59] gonna go and see if I can meet up with
[14:01] them because we didn't know what had
[14:03] happened we didn't know whether we
[14:06] missed them somehow or whatever so he
[14:10] leaves and now I'm waiting alone and I
[14:13] was waiting about another half hour and
[14:16] then I heard some voices and I just took
[14:19] a few steps to the trail and here came
[14:23] brother bud carrying this big terrible
[14:26] on his head on his shoulders rather we
[14:30] come all the way down that Creek but I'm
[14:32] packing that Tara bookkeeping hid and he
[14:38] kept watching for this this grizzly well
[14:43] you know it was like looking on the side
[14:45] of that hill up there only one button
[14:47] bush up on it you know just that short
[14:49] your ass it was just no bear there
[14:53] that's all you know all at once well
[14:57] we're getting funnier - where you guys
[14:59] was and I give give it up really a scene
[15:04] grizzly finally we were sitting down
[15:09] resting again and he pointed up there on
[15:12] the side to him he said what's that up
[15:15] there he did since as I glimpse it up
[15:22] there I knew it little bear so I said
[15:26] you know it was a silver tip about the
[15:29] same colors I know Rome milk cow it I
[15:31] had and I said we went when he said he
[15:41] you would shoot it you know to me it
[15:44] would like him shooting from here up to
[15:46] the top of that cliff up there better
[15:49] better or not I had no idea he would
[15:54] shoot that far and I uh I wouldn't
[15:57] letting anybody else shoot that far
[15:59] anyway you know they coulda crippled
[16:00] something there in old wood we had no
[16:04] time to to go around and come up from
[16:06] the back of that mountain it took us a
[16:08] day and so I said to him I said we'll
[16:13] have to let me at Bear golden night and
[16:15] come back after him tomorrow
[16:18] we can't get any closer this way he's
[16:23] looking right down at us oh he said I
[16:28] can tell him anything I doubted that
[16:34] really good I didn't seen you shoot that
[16:36] much that terrible right on top of that
[16:39] when he shot that boy when he shot that
[16:45] old Marius was coming he he pulled that
[16:51] young up and that's not my hair straight
[16:57] up yeah
[17:02] there and come on he fell probably that
[17:07] big big poplar over there from us like a
[17:11] night even with us like that
[17:13] he fell in that short train thing you'll
[17:16] there no I said you watching mine I'll
[17:23] go over and see oh did he is so he did
[17:27] but he was dead as could be film and
[17:32] another thing he said he said that gonna
[17:36] be too late and we wouldn't skin that
[17:39] bear out that night well I never dreamt
[17:41] up you know leaving a trophy over there
[17:46] a bear could have come home tore that
[17:47] all the pieces but that's the first
[17:49] thing we thought about you know leave it
[17:52] leave it till tomorrow every every word
[17:55] that he said come just as true through
[17:58] could be a path you know when you never
[17:59] even thought about it at the time but
[18:01] you thinking of it afterward I ran up to
[18:03] brother branham brother Brendan was
[18:05] standing there I said I put my hand out
[18:08] to shake his hand I said congratulations
[18:10] brother Brown and that's that's a lovely
[18:12] animal he said I got a bear - and I just
[18:19] tapped him on the shoulder I said oh you
[18:22] didn't get a bear the same day he said
[18:24] yeah I did and I felt strange I said
[18:28] well where is it
[18:30] and bud said well we're not able to
[18:33] carry and he said the hide would
[18:35] probably worth three weigh 300 pounds
[18:38] and I said well and I felt real strange
[18:41] and bud walked over to his saddle horse
[18:45] which was right there and went into the
[18:48] saddle bag and brought out a little
[18:52] round tape with a push button on the
[18:56] side and I was kind of amused I had
[18:59] lived in the wilderness all my life and
[19:01] had hunted and never saw anybody carry a
[19:05] tape
[19:06] and then I thought while he's a guide
[19:08] now probably is interested in you know
[19:11] the size of the horns etc and he brought
[19:14] out this little steel tape and he put it
[19:17] right down at the base of the horns it's
[19:21] a little Ridge there and he hooked the
[19:23] tape there and then the tape went into
[19:26] this curve and then around and every
[19:30] time he started to go around the bottom
[19:33] flicked out and then it so he started it
[19:36] again and followed it around trying to
[19:40] measure correctly and it flicked out
[19:42] about the third time he says to his son
[19:46] Blaine hold that tape in there and so
[19:50] Blaine knelt down on one day and spread
[19:53] his hands out 18-year old boy and then I
[19:57] began to feel real strange held his
[20:00] hands out and brother bud pulled up tape
[20:03] around brother branham said in the
[20:05] vision he just heard a voice saying it's
[20:08] 42 inches and that was it and I I put my
[20:15] head
[20:17] Blaine looked up while he was holding
[20:20] the tape brother but he held his two
[20:23] head over the tape to make sure where
[20:27] the black line and the black line of 42
[20:30] inches fell at the last point of the
[20:33] horn and he said it's 42 inches and I I
[20:39] just felt overwhelmed and brother
[20:42] branham he did not look he just stood
[20:45] there erect and I was right because on
[20:48] his shoulder and he just said she said
[20:51] there it is
[20:53] it was all over and they grizzly laying
[20:57] up on the mountain
[20:59] there the horn was and the vision was
[21:02] over that took about six hours in total
[21:07] for the whole vision dark chocolate
[21:11] brown animal and I'm standing there in a
[21:15] green checkered shirt and the vision was
[21:19] completely fulfilled and I can say to
[21:24] all who hear this is a true report
[21:29] everything is true absolutely true
[21:33] [Music]
