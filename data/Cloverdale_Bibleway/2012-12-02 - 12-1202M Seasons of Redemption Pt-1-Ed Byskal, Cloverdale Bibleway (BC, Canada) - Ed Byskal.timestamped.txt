[9:09] &gt;&gt; the service in a word of prayer. Our
[9:11] brother Ricardo, would you come open the
[9:13] service for us? We [music] do have a
[9:15] couple prayer requests.
[9:17] Request from our brother Sam Waldner.
[9:19] Please pray for Sister Renie for
[9:20] strength in her body that [music] the
[9:22] Lord would destroy whatever causes the
[9:24] weakness in her for she wants to be able
[9:26] to come to church. We'll be careful to
[9:28] give the Lord all the glory for he is
[9:29] well able to perform [music]
[9:31] that we ask. We want to thank him ahead
[9:34] of time. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[9:36] Let's just remember our sister Renie
[9:37] this morning. Also want to remember her
[9:40] coworker, Sister Margaret Karm. She has
[9:43] a special need that she would like us to
[9:44] pray for. [music] Amen. If there's
[9:46] something in your heart that you just
[9:47] like to lift before the Lord as our
[9:49] brother Ricardo comes. Amen. [music] And
[9:50] as we sing this song again, there is a
[9:52] fountain open. Amen. Come now and
[9:55] receive. Amen.
[9:57] There [singing] is [music]
[9:59] a fountain
[10:02] open
[10:04] in [music and singing]
[10:05] the house
[10:07] of David.
[10:11] [music]
[10:19] Oh, [music] and there [singing] are
[10:21] sweets
[10:24] of grace [music] slowing down
[10:29] from
[10:34] now and [music]
[10:41] [music]
[10:44] saints. Let's um
[10:49] let's go to him.
[10:52] Every single person here has a need.
[10:53] [music]
[10:55] There's people who are in the hospital.
[10:57] There's people who've been diagnosed
[10:58] with different things. [music]
[11:00] Everyone has a need.
[11:02] Let's pull one for another. No matter
[11:04] what the situation,
[11:07] let's [music] bow our heads.
[11:09] Heavenly Father,
[11:12] we're here.
[11:15] We're loving you. [music]
[11:17] We're praising you.
[11:19] And even when this flesh fights against
[11:21] it, [music]
[11:22] we ask you, Lord God, to forgive us.
[11:26] We get slothful. We forget. [music]
[11:30] We forget about one another.
[11:32] But I've just been reading, Lord God.
[11:36] [music] We can't leave one behind.
[11:38] We're holding for one another, no matter
[11:40] if we understand the situation or not.
[11:43] and nothing's too big for you.
[11:46] You've done something for every single
[11:47] one of us in all of our lives. Lord, you
[11:50] healed me. You healed my brother. You
[11:51] healed my sister. We're all going
[11:53] through different things, Lord. But
[11:56] we're asking you to come, Lord God. That
[11:58] you not just be the guest of honor, but
[12:00] that you put the brother who's going to
[12:01] be speaking to the side and speak
[12:02] directly from your heart to our heart.
[12:06] Lord Jesus, we have need of you. We are
[12:09] failures in ourselves, but we are more
[12:12] than conquerors in you, Lord Jesus. So,
[12:14] we're asking you that whatever demon
[12:16] tries to hinder us, whatever demon tries
[12:18] to hinder the minister, Lord God, break
[12:20] the ways open. Give them liberty, Lord
[12:23] God, to speak what you have to speak to
[12:25] us, our young people, Lord God, from our
[12:27] youngest to our oldest, not holding
[12:29] anybody out. Father, speak directly to
[12:32] our hearts. Change our lives, Lord God.
[12:34] We're going forward. We're going on. We
[12:37] love you, Jesus. And we can't say it
[12:38] enough. We ask you to be with every
[12:41] prayer request, Lord God. [music]
[12:44] With every need, Lord God, regardless of
[12:46] the situation, [music] whether they
[12:48] pinned it down or not, there's somebody
[12:50] here, Lord God, who's saying, "Remember
[12:52] me. Remember me. Remember my son,
[12:55] remember my daughter, remember my uncle,
[12:57] remember my grandfather, remember my
[12:59] grandmother." We're putting every single
[13:01] one of them, Lord God, before you,
[13:02] asking you to hit the situation, Lord
[13:04] God, right on the head exactly where it
[13:06] is.
[13:07] We love you, Jesus. And we're just
[13:09] asking, Lord God, not for theatrics,
[13:11] Lord, but we're asking from the depths
[13:13] of our heart. Continue [music] to deal
[13:15] with us, Lord God, to don't leave us,
[13:16] Lord. We need you. We love you, Father
[13:19] God. We commit every single thing before
[13:21] you, Lord God. Take full control of this
[13:24] service. And your blessed name of the
[13:26] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[13:28] [music]
[13:33] [music]
[13:35] And God bless you. You may have your
[13:36] seats.
[13:39] Amen. It is so sweet to trust in Jesus.
[13:41] Brother David, want to greet each and
[13:43] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[13:44] Jesus Christ. We're happy to have you
[13:46] here this morning. Looking forward to a
[13:48] wonderful day. And I trust you've put
[13:50] your order in. We're here to give 100%.
[13:52] We know that God never disappoints.
[13:55] Amen. So, let's just take a few moments,
[13:57] prepare our hearts for the ministering
[13:59] of the word as our pastor is going to
[14:00] come. [music] Amen. It is so sweet to
[14:03] trust in Jesus. Have you found it so?
[14:05] Praise the Lord. Oh, it is so sweet to
[14:10] trust [music] in Jesus,
[14:13] just to take him at [music]
[14:17] his word and just to rest upon his
[14:24] promise. [music]
[14:26] Just [singing] to know the simple.

[15:09] in sinful [music]
[15:11] way to bless me

[15:39] Oh, grace to [music] trust [singing] in
[15:43] Lord and yes
[15:47] to trust [music] in Jesus.
[15:51] Just from sin [music and singing]

[15:57] [music and singing] from Jesus
[15:59] simply say
[16:02] life [music and singing]
[16:05] and joy and peace. Oh [music] Jesus,
[16:10] Jesus, [singing] I trust [music] him and
[16:14] now I prove him all and [music]
[16:20] Jesus. Jesus Christ
[16:25] [music]
[16:27] for grace.
[16:29] I'm so glad I learned to trust my soul.
[16:31] [music]
[16:32] And I'm so glad [singing]
[16:35] I learned to trust. [music]
[16:38] Precious [singing]
[16:39] Jesus,
[16:41] Savior, [music]
[16:43] and I know
[16:47] thou art with me [music]
[16:50] will be with me till the end. Oh [music]
[16:56] Jesus.
[16:57] Jesus, [singing]

[17:14] [music]
[17:19] Amen. We're going to sing that fourth
[17:21] verse again. I'm gonna ask our sister
[17:22] Lois, does she come? [music] Get ready
[17:24] to sing for us. I'm so glad I learned to
[17:26] trust thee. [music]
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] and I'm so glad I learned
[17:33] to trust.
[17:35] Precious [music and singing]
[17:36] Jesus,
[17:38] Savior,
[17:39] and
[17:41] [music and singing] I know that thou art
[17:47] will be
[17:50] till the [music and singing] end.
[17:53] Jesus, Jesus,
[17:56] how I trust thee, how I [music]
[18:02] all
[18:05] Jesus, [music]
[18:06] Jesus,
[18:08] rest,
[18:11] all [music] the way to trust in glorious
[18:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[18:42] &gt;&gt; The streets were dark and empty in
[18:46] Jerusalem [music]
[18:47] that night as silently the Old man made
[18:51] [music] his way. [singing]
[18:54] He'd heard a lot of rumors, so to put
[18:58] [music] his mind at rest, he'd see just
[19:01] what the master had to say.
[19:04] [music and singing]
[19:06] Some heard him say that you're a [music]
[19:09] man come from God. And I've been
[19:13] searching for some peace of [singing]
[19:15] mind.
[19:18] I've looked into [music] philosophy, my
[19:21] custom and my creed. But peace of mind
[19:25] is something I can find.
[19:29] Surely I say unto you, you must be born
[19:33] [music] again.
[19:35] A new birth of the spirit is the key.
[19:41] There's no other [music] way by which a
[19:44] man can enter in. You are the way
[19:47] [music] the kingdom he can see.
[19:52] So I beg forgiveness, but I just don't
[19:56] [music] understand
[19:58] how it is that man is born [music]
[20:00] again. [singing]
[20:03] Can it be that he must die and then to
[20:07] live again [music]
[20:09] or go a second time into the world?
[20:14] Surely [music]
[20:15] I say unto you, you must be born again.
[20:20] A new birth of the spirit is the king.
[20:24] [music]
[20:26] There's no other way by which a man can
[20:29] enter in. [music]
[20:31] No other way the kingdom he can see.
[20:37] I am but mortal [music] flesh, yet my
[20:40] spirit it can live. [singing]
[20:42] Such a thing I've never heard before.
[20:47] [music]
[20:48] Oh, the marvelous mystery that I should
[20:52] have that key and with it [music] I can
[20:55] open heaven's door.
[20:59] Surely I say unto you, [music] you must
[21:02] be born again. I knew by the spirit is
[21:07] the key.
[21:10] [music] There's no other way by which a
[21:13] man can enter.
[21:15] No [music] other way [singing] that
[21:17] kingdom you can see.
[21:21] [music] Surely I say unto you, you must
[21:24] be born again. A new birth of the spirit
[21:29] is [music] the key.
[21:32] There's no other way by [music] which a
[21:35] man can enter in. No other way the
[21:39] kingdom he can see. [music]
[21:43] No other way the kingdom he can see.
[21:50] [music and singing]
[21:59] Hallelujah. Thank you, Sister Lois.
[22:02] Amen. We're going to take the offering.
[22:03] I want to sing blessed be as I prepare
[22:05] to take the offering this morning.
[22:07] [music]
[22:08] Amen. Blessed be your name. Oh,
[22:11] [singing] blessed [music]
[22:13] be.

[23:20] [music and singing] tower
[23:22] for an ever present help
[23:27] in my [music] darkest hour.
[23:30] You're my hiding place
[23:36] [music] of pain. You are the rock
[23:38] [singing]
[23:39] on which I'm standing.
[23:42] You are worthy of [singing] my praise.
[23:45] [music]
[23:46] Oh, blessed
[23:48] me.
[23:50] Oh, blessed [music]
[23:51] me.

[24:17] bless the offer. Ask the blessing on the
[24:19] offering this morning. [music]
[24:23] Amen. Let's pray.
[24:26] Heavenly [music] Father, Lord, what an
[24:29] honor to lift up this giving as a
[24:32] sacrifice unto you, oh God. Lord, that
[24:35] we might worship you through the [music]

[24:55] you use it to your glory Lord. We're
[24:58] giving it to you Lord and we're asking
[24:59] Lord that you would be pleased with it.
[25:01] And Father we know that you'll bless the
[25:04] giver. We know Lord that you shall
[25:06] provide for each one of our needs. And
[25:08] so Lord [music] we commit this time of
[25:10] worship through giving into your hands
[25:13] for the glory of the kingdom of God in
[25:16] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [music]

[28:11] [music]
[28:13] Blessed be
[28:17] blessed.
[28:19] [music]
[28:21] Blessed be
[28:23] your name.
[28:26] Hallelujah. [music] Amen. As we invite
[28:29] our pastor to come, why don't we sing?
[28:31] In everything, give him thanks. In the
[28:34] [music] good times, we'll praise his
[28:36] name. In the bad times, we're still
[28:38] going to praise his name. Amen. In
[28:40] everything,
[28:42] [music]
[28:47] everything [music]
[28:50] we give him [singing] thanks.
[28:55] Give him thanks [music]
[28:58] in everything. [singing]
[29:02] [music]
[29:02] Everything.
[29:06] Give [singing] him praise.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Give us a good time.
[29:18] Praise [music] his name
[29:21] and in [singing] the best time
[29:25] we'll [music] do the same.
[29:29] In everything
[29:32] we give [music] the king of kings
[29:37] all
[29:40] [music]
[29:44] [music]
[29:48] everything.
[29:51] Give him [music]
[29:52] thanks.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[29:57] [music]
[29:59] &gt;&gt; for you.
[30:02] Every [music]
[30:05] just
[30:12] [music]
[30:17] praise his name
[30:20] and [music] the night.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:28] &gt;&gt; in everything
[30:32] the king [music and singing] of kings
[30:35] all
[30:37] [music]
[30:39] the good time
[30:43] [music]
[30:49] and that time [music] we will do
[30:57] and everything.
[31:01] Give [music and singing]
[31:02] the king of kings
[31:05] all the way. [music]
[31:12] [music]
[31:16] Isn't it wonderful?
[31:18] Hallelujah. I was just thinking while we
[31:22] were singing, I don't know if there is
[31:24] any bad times for the believer.
[31:27] God turns them into
[31:29] uh productive times and positive times.
[31:32] And sometimes we have to go through a
[31:36] little while and then we look back and
[31:39] uh I think it was Tom that preached a
[31:42] subject that I doubt any of us really
[31:45] forgot. Who said it's bad?
[31:48] you remember that it's been repeated
[31:51] many many times. Well, God bless you all
[31:54] for being here this morning.
[31:58] Uh I just feel different about the
[32:00] service, feel different about the word.
[32:04] Sometimes we just experience a little
[32:06] something that causes us to look
[32:09] differently on things. And I I trust
[32:11] that will be your experience also
[32:14] uh this morning. Amen. And perhaps
[32:18] something can be said that from today
[32:20] forward
[32:21] &gt;&gt; you we can look at things differently.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the message differently.
[32:26] Look at the word of God differently.
[32:30] Uh this last week as many of you already
[32:32] know our brother Jonathan Wman passed
[32:35] into the presence of the Lord. Brother
[32:38] Jonathan had had a a a stroke as a
[32:40] result of a quite a massive bleed in the
[32:43] in his brain. But uh
[32:48] there was good reason to believe that he
[32:49] was uh somewhat conscious of what the
[32:53] people around him and what was being
[32:56] said and so on. Uh he passed into the
[33:00] presence of the Lord yesterday at about
[33:03] 3:00, a little bit after 3:00 in the
[33:06] afternoon, and the entire family was
[33:09] around his bedside at the time. And and
[33:13] they simply said, "All was peace."
[33:16] &gt;&gt; And we're happy for that.
[33:18] Uh we don't have uh full details of a
[33:22] memorial services as yet, but we're
[33:25] anticipating Tuesday,
[33:28] this coming Tuesday.
[33:30] Uh we'll we hope we can make the
[33:33] announcement tonight. Uh but we're not
[33:37] we're not absolutely certain, but we
[33:40] will attempt to make it tonight. And if
[33:43] we are unable to give the exact time and
[33:45] place, then you'll have to phone the
[33:48] office. And I'd like to make a special
[33:49] request because we haven't got a meeting
[33:52] between this evening and Wednesday
[33:54] evening that uh if if we're able to
[33:58] notify you or you're able to determine
[34:00] exactly the time and the place, please
[34:03] take it upon yourself to phone as many
[34:06] others as you can also and let them
[34:08] know. But we hope that we will be able
[34:11] to let you know this evening
[34:14] uh after the service. Uh and I'm sure
[34:17] also many of you know brother uh brother
[34:20] Jonathan was not able to uh work just
[34:25] part-time and different jobs um in this
[34:28] last few months. So we're going to take
[34:32] an offering after the service this
[34:34] morning. We're just going to I'm asking
[34:36] the deacons to have some baskets out in
[34:39] the foyer and if you'd like to just be
[34:42] able to give to Sister Clara and help
[34:45] her at this time, it would be very very
[34:48] much appreciated. And I'm sure we all
[34:50] can uh sacrifice a little and remember
[34:53] our sister Clara uh at this time as you
[34:56] leave this morning. Also, our brother
[35:00] Lonnie Jenkins is uh in the hospital. He
[35:04] had been in the hospital and then uh was
[35:07] taken home. The doctors said they
[35:09] weren't able to do any more for him. Uh
[35:14] cancer had uh taken uh a large cancer
[35:18] area and they said that they weren't
[35:21] able to do anything more for him.
[35:23] However,
[35:26] uh while he was uh while he was home and
[35:28] just fully alert and coherent and so on
[35:32] this last week, I felt I just felt uh
[35:35] very very impressed one day to uh write
[35:38] him. Of course, I knew that the any
[35:40] communication was going through brother
[35:42] Jeff and uh so I sent it to brother Jeff
[35:46] and asked him please take this and read
[35:49] these words to your father. I just began
[35:53] to relive and feel uh the times that we
[35:56] were together. Um we traveled much of
[35:59] the world together and ministered
[36:03] uh oh I don't know how many times
[36:05] probably eight or 10 times the
[36:07] conventions in Norway where the people
[36:11] from Sweden, Finland and Denmark would
[36:14] gather for the convention in Norway and
[36:19] uh we ministered there ministered in
[36:22] Sweden in Finland in u Malawi uh I
[36:27] remembered So well uh he and I driving
[36:31] and having a brother drive us in the
[36:34] jungles of Malawi with elephant grass
[36:37] that must have been 12 or 15t high. The
[36:41] path we were on was a was a path that
[36:44] people walked on. So, anything beyond
[36:47] the path, we just mowed down with a car
[36:51] uh this grass and looking for uh a
[36:54] village and village as you can scarcely
[36:57] see with that tall grass and so on and
[37:01] and our driver got out and and he was
[37:05] looking, you know, trying to see where
[37:08] where we're supposed to be going and it
[37:10] was a all I know it was above 80° and
[37:14] our windows had to be rolled up because
[37:17] if they didn't, the grass just came back
[37:20] on and all the uh seeds and bugs and
[37:24] whatever more might be in the grass was
[37:26] coming in the car. So, we had the car
[37:29] sealed up and I was melting. I just
[37:32] didn't know if there would be anything
[37:33] left of me when we got to wherever we're
[37:36] going. So, I said to our driver, I said,
[37:41] "You know, where are we going?" Well, he
[37:43] thinks it's out this way. Anyway, long
[37:46] story short, we uh came to a village,
[37:50] just a tiny village, and they were
[37:52] waiting waiting for us to speak to them
[37:55] about this message, a man and his wife
[37:58] and family. And it was just quite an
[38:01] experience. And I just wanted to
[38:04] say once again, it's not only to pray
[38:06] for the family, you know, and pray for
[38:08] brother Lonie's family, but uh something
[38:12] more than that. I think we ought to give
[38:14] glory to God that he allows a life like
[38:19] this, a real soldier. You don't have to
[38:22] look far, friends. They are around us.
[38:25] Real soldiers. I mean, Brother Lonnie's
[38:28] been a prisoner of Jesus Christ. He's
[38:31] been a prisoner to this word. And of all
[38:34] the years that I was with him and they
[38:36] were here, brother Lonnie and brother
[38:38] Jeff were part of this congregation for
[38:39] perhaps two and a half or three years.
[38:42] And uh I can say that you talk about an
[38:46] even
[38:48] uh just an even character. I never saw
[38:51] him ruffled. I never saw him
[38:54] uh and when you're traveling it it it
[38:56] can get pretty trying sometimes. So,
[38:58] we're thankful that God has sent these
[39:01] kind of people along and we're we're
[39:02] thanking God for the life.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, we just pray that God will
[39:07] bless the family that are together. Uh,
[39:10] brother brother John Andy's and brother
[39:13] Kyle Morton, they are in Lima today. So,
[39:17] I don't know if they'll be able to make
[39:18] any contact or whatever, but they're
[39:20] having meetings with brother uh Craig
[39:23] Boore, who was our camp speaker this
[39:26] last year. And I have been also speaking
[39:28] with brother Craig in the last few days.
[39:31] So, uh, we we have lots to be thankful
[39:35] for
[39:36] &gt;&gt; and we have lots to pray about.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:41] Praise the Lord.
[39:43] Well, you feeling good?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:47] We'll give the glory to Jesus
[39:50] &gt;&gt; and tell of his love.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Did you just come to church today or are
[39:55] you expecting? Amen.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you expecting?
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz anything that I have to say depends
[40:02] on you.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; If this is a flop, I'm going to blame
[40:07] you.
[40:09] Hallelujah. Why don't we stand?
[40:13] Why don't we sing? We'll give the glory
[40:15] to Jesus. I just feel like giving him
[40:18] praise. Hallelujah.
[40:20] Uh, I can tell you that Jonathan Walman,
[40:24] though he was a man of few words,
[40:26] [music]
[40:27] right now I believe he's saying some
[40:30] words. I believe he's thanking God.
[40:32] [music] Hallelujah. Maybe looking over
[40:34] the banister. I don't know. We're
[40:36] rejoicing. [music]
[40:38] &gt;&gt; It said, "Rejoice with them that
[40:40] rejoice." And we perhaps sorrow with
[40:42] them that sorrow. But anyone who sorrows
[40:45] on this side, [music]
[40:47] there's no sorrow over there. You
[40:49] believe that? You're believers, aren't
[40:51] you? [music] Amen. All right, let's just
[40:53] sing it. We'll give the glory to Jesus
[40:57] [music]
[41:03] [music] and tell his love, his wonderful
[41:08] [music]
[41:09] love. We'll give our glory to Jesus
[41:17] [music]
[41:17] and tell his [singing] wonderful
[41:21] love [music]
[41:24] to give the glory to Jesus
[41:30] [music]
[41:31] and
[41:33] his love. His wonderful
[41:37] song will give his [music and singing]
[41:40] glory to Jesus
[41:44] [music] and tell his wonderful love.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Before we turn to the scripture, let's
[41:54] bow in a moment of prayer. [music]
[41:56] Almighty God, creator of heavens and
[41:59] earth, [music] giver of every good gift,
[42:04] the author of life. We thank you for the
[42:07] lives of your children, the redeemed.
[42:10] For none can be redeemed outside of the
[42:13] blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice
[42:15] [music]
[42:16] for sinners
[42:18] came into the world, oh God, to redeem
[42:20] the world. [music]
[42:22] We pray, Father, today you'll make
[42:24] things so abundantly clear. I pray that
[42:27] there will be a spirit, the Holy Spirit
[42:30] of God, the spirit of adoption that will
[42:34] come upon the people. [music]
[42:35] And may their understanding, oh God, be
[42:39] more than just an understanding. May it
[42:41] be a revelation, something that's
[42:44] revealed to the inner man. Lord, I pray
[42:47] you'll give us uh not only understanding
[42:51] and clarity of thought, [music] but may
[42:54] we be illuminated by a divine light and
[42:58] power in the name of Jesus Christ.
[43:01] [music] For you'll anoint both speaker
[43:03] and hearers in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:08] I'll invite you to uh turn with me to
[43:12] book of Romans
[43:14] the 8th chapter.
[43:21] We were in Seattle last Sunday evening
[43:24] and had a nice time. And for those of
[43:26] you that were there, and there was a
[43:28] number that came down with us, uh, I'm
[43:31] going to be saying some things that we
[43:34] spoke there and also spoke here. I want
[43:38] to put some things together. I have been
[43:41] and I I I trust you just feel at home
[43:44] this morning. I feel very much at home
[43:46] and don't be too time conscious but I
[43:48] want to I want to say some things and I
[43:51] would ask that those that are uh
[43:54] students you know what study is I want
[43:57] you to really put your thinking cap on
[43:59] this morning and because I want to uh
[44:03] declare some things of my own
[44:05] convictions and why we believe and I
[44:08] believe we should be able to say why we
[44:10] believe certain things should we not
[44:13] &gt;&gt; every man should be ready to give an
[44:14] answer.
[44:16] We'll be reading uh starting at the 18th
[44:19] verse.
[44:21] For I reckon
[44:24] that the suffering of this present time
[44:26] are not worthy
[44:29] uh to be compared with the glory which
[44:31] shall be revealed in us. For the earnest
[44:33] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[44:36] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[44:39] For the creature was made subject to
[44:42] vanity, not willing, but by reason of
[44:44] him who hath subjected the same in hope.
[44:48] Because the creature itself also shall
[44:51] be delivered from the bondage of
[44:53] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[44:56] the children of God. For we know that
[44:59] the whole creation groanth and travaleth
[45:01] in pain together until now. And not only
[45:05] they, but ourselves also, which have the
[45:09] first fruits of the spirit, even we
[45:12] ourselves grown within ourselves,
[45:15] waiting for the adoption to the
[45:18] redemption of our body. And I'm calling
[45:21] that the final act of redemption.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; The redemption when everybody's
[45:28] acquainted with death, but we're not all
[45:31] acquainted with resurrection.
[45:33] But when there will be a resurrection of
[45:36] those that have died in Christ in the
[45:40] faith and those whose bodies, as the
[45:44] scripture has declared, we shall not all
[45:47] sleep, but we shall all be changed.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And friends, that is something that is
[45:53] so incredibly important. We ought to
[45:56] make that the object of our lives,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; the resurrection. and to participate and
[46:03] to be that.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Friends, I do not want to be in a hole
[46:07] in the ground
[46:08] &gt;&gt; when a resurrection takes place.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; When there's a resurrection that's
[46:12] promised, I think that ought to be a
[46:14] fervent uh that ought to be the fervent
[46:16] objective of every person regardless of
[46:19] what age we are.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[46:26] A scripture that we used also in the
[46:29] previous uh services uh was out of
[46:32] Ephesians and just one line the we're uh
[46:36] instructed by apostle Paul there also
[46:39] redeeming the time because the days are
[46:42] evil so we don't know we don't need
[46:44] anyone to tell us the days are evil but
[46:47] redeeming the time which is uh simply
[46:52] from the dagot the original securing the
[46:55] season for yourselves and that has
[46:57] inspired me very much. Securing the
[47:01] season for yourselves
[47:04] and I've called this seasons of
[47:06] redemption.
[47:11] I thought before I would even speak, I
[47:14] want to
[47:16] make a a comment to your personal
[47:18] declaration.
[47:20] Uh why do I believe this message?
[47:26] Because I believe that I could prove to
[47:29] you if we had time
[47:32] and we have over the years I could prove
[47:34] to you that the one who spoke through
[47:37] God's prophet in this generation
[47:40] was exactly the same one who spoke
[47:42] through Isaiah the prophets of the Old
[47:45] Testament. And the reason I say that is
[47:48] because God came in behind and confirmed
[47:51] that the intelligence that was causing
[47:54] him to speak and utter words was not
[47:57] man's intelligence.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And that is there's been great leaders
[48:03] and great men and great women I suppose
[48:05] in the past and and men that were gifted
[48:09] and this is not a gifted man merely.
[48:12] That's not a gift. people who want to
[48:15] say and that's where the denominations
[48:17] went completely all sideways and wrong.
[48:20] They thought well it's a gift. uh
[48:22] there's all kinds of gifted people. But
[48:25] when a person
[48:27] uh can can stand in front of the
[48:30] multitudes of people year after year
[48:33] after year from the beginning to the end
[48:36] and to any intelligent person, I'm
[48:39] talking about a person with normal
[48:40] intelligence. Look at that and hear what
[48:43] is being said and assimilated in your
[48:46] mind. And you have to come up with the
[48:49] conclusion that this is not a man
[48:52] speaking.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; And that's where I'm coming from. And
[48:56] where the scripture I've I've mentioned
[48:58] this many times. I'm taking my time in
[49:01] incidentally. I'll just go as far as I
[49:03] can this morning then stop and we'll
[49:05] take pick it up later.
[49:08] But the reason I say that is because as
[49:11] brother Brandham has said, a prophet is
[49:14] a reflector of God.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; He's made so that he cannot speak his
[49:21] own words.
[49:22] It has to be God's words that he speaks.
[49:25] He's just a reflector and he's God's
[49:28] mouthpiece.
[49:31] And so therefore he said a prophet said
[49:36] now you know that you've heard these
[49:38] things many times but now I want you to
[49:40] take them because this is going to be a
[49:42] lesson and I'm going to move uh from one
[49:45] thought to another. You need to link
[49:47] them together.
[49:49] So the prophet Isaiah said
[49:54] that a virgin shall conceive.
[49:57] Brother Brandham said he probably didn't
[49:59] understand that. Now, brother Brandham
[50:01] could say that from experience
[50:04] is speak things that he didn't
[50:06] understand. The prophet spoke things
[50:08] they didn't understand. Sometimes we do
[50:10] also, but he said he couldn't understand
[50:15] it, but God had spoke it through him.
[50:19] And finally,
[50:22] listen class, finally those words
[50:28] anchored
[50:30] in the womb of a virgin,
[50:34] and she conceived and brought forth
[50:36] Emmanuel.
[50:38] It was not some thunderous voice from
[50:41] heaven
[50:42] or some strange spectacular phenomena.
[50:47] God's words that he spoke through human
[50:50] lips
[50:52] &gt;&gt; that had prophesied a virgin shall
[50:55] conceived. Those words
[50:58] lodged
[50:59] &gt;&gt; in the womb of a virgin and she
[51:01] conceived and brought forth
[51:04] &gt;&gt; the man son of God Jesus Christ.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; That's why he's called the son of God
[51:10] because God spoke it hundreds of years
[51:12] before said a virgin shall conceive.
[51:14] Once God said it, it must come to pass.
[51:18] He's the creator. The man isn't the
[51:20] creator. Isaiah is not the creator.
[51:22] William Brandon's not a creator. They
[51:25] are vessels through whom God has chosen
[51:27] said, "I'm going to speak through you."
[51:32] &gt;&gt; And then when men receive it or when men
[51:34] hear it, they can take all kinds of
[51:36] positions on it and say, "Well, um, I
[51:39] don't understand it." That's fine, but I
[51:42] respect it. Uh, others might say, "I
[51:44] believe it. I believe it because
[51:46] something within me witnesses." And you
[51:48] don't know, but it's the very spirit of
[51:50] God in you that's witnessing. That's the
[51:52] truth.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it. How can you explain
[51:56] the phenomenal things? How can you
[51:58] explain supernatural things with a
[52:01] natural tongue? You cannot.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; See?
[52:05] So then then the scripture says
[52:08] concerning the birth of Jesus Christ,
[52:10] we're just coming up to Christmas
[52:11] season. We know that this isn't the
[52:13] season of his birth, but nevertheless,
[52:16] here's the here's the scripture now. And
[52:18] it just details everything concerning
[52:22] the the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[52:24] this wise. This is how it happened. And
[52:27] there are several verses in Matthew
[52:29] starting in the first about starting
[52:31] about chapter uh chapter 1 verse 22. But
[52:35] don't look to it now. I'm just that's
[52:37] what I'm going to detail it. Now all
[52:40] this was done. All what was done? All
[52:43] the details concerning the birth of
[52:45] Jesus Christ. All this was done. You
[52:49] following me?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; That it might be fulfilled. Now, we did
[52:55] all of this. That's what the Bible's
[52:56] saying. All this happened for one
[52:59] purpose, that it might be fulfilled,
[53:02] which was spoken of the Lord
[53:07] by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin
[53:10] shall conceive, and shall be with child,
[53:14] and shall bring forth a son, and thou
[53:15] shalt call his name Emanuel, which being
[53:18] interpreted is God with us. So that was
[53:21] in the season of his birth.
[53:24] on down the road as Matthew's recording
[53:27] the life of Jesus and then he's coming
[53:29] towards he's coming now to where where
[53:31] all the great things have have more or
[53:33] less ceased and he and people don't know
[53:36] and his own disciples don't know why
[53:38] he's not continuing on with the
[53:40] supernatural uh supernatural miracles
[53:43] and all of these things and then uh you
[53:47] know they're being troubled over it and
[53:49] even wanting to protect him from it.
[53:51] Peter wants to protect him from it. And
[53:54] the Bible tells us,
[53:56] "But all this was done." Now this is at
[53:59] the other, this is coming out of the
[54:00] season of suffering.
[54:02] All this was done that the scriptures of
[54:05] the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
[54:08] all the disciples forsook him and fled.
[54:11] So one is his birth and one is his This
[54:13] is why I believe this message.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. is because I
[54:18] am more than convinced more than
[54:21] convinced given my whole life to the
[54:24] fact that that's the same God
[54:27] &gt;&gt; that spoke the things in the scripture
[54:29] that uttered the things that we hear
[54:32] today and there are things we don't
[54:34] understand. There are things that have
[54:36] happened and taken place and things that
[54:39] we still look forward to.
[54:41] I haven't experienced
[54:44] uh the resurrection of the dead. But the
[54:47] same God who said that a virgin shall
[54:50] conceive. He's the same God who said
[54:53] that he would take and open up seven
[54:55] seals. and the and although I read the
[54:58] seven seals book, you have read the
[55:00] message and perhaps you might say, well,
[55:03] I don't understand and all of this and
[55:05] it seems to come from different
[55:06] directions and so on and there's so much
[55:08] in here and it's perhaps against
[55:10] denominationalism. Let me say it could
[55:14] you a person could do an an an analysis
[55:17] of the seven seals and you'll find that
[55:20] he's talking about denominationalism
[55:23] because he's taking the covers off of
[55:25] Satan's deception. And what does that
[55:27] mean to us? He may talk about national
[55:30] things and political things so that we
[55:33] don't get all wrapped up and looking for
[55:36] some kind of savior to help us. and and
[55:39] uh and he speaks about those things so
[55:41] that we will have clarity. You could
[55:43] just summarize it all and saying it's
[55:45] protection on one hand. It's a it's
[55:48] revealing our situation and telling us
[55:50] what is going to happen and telling why
[55:53] Israel is where they are and what is
[55:55] happening over there nationally. And
[55:57] people get all engrossed in in in the
[56:01] dayto-day things. friends, this whole
[56:03] thing's passing away and we're a we're a
[56:06] group of people here, but you're just a
[56:08] teaspoon of ashes.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:15] And so now I go on from there now
[56:17] securing the season that we are in.
[56:24] Prophet said that God allotted his word
[56:26] to each age. And as the age comes along,
[56:30] now I'd like to just say something
[56:32] during this service and that's why I
[56:34] mentioned students earlier is because I
[56:37] have spent an incredible amount of time
[56:41] just to get one line out of here and one
[56:44] line out of there and put them together.
[56:47] So that the continuity of thought is
[56:50] that's the very best I could do for you.
[56:53] So I really appreciate your real close
[56:56] attention.
[56:58] So now God has allotted a certain amount
[57:00] of time to each age and as the age comes
[57:04] along. He said he sends someone there to
[57:07] vindicate that word.
[57:10] So God has allotted a certain amount of
[57:12] word to each age and he sends someone
[57:16] along to vindicate that word. And when
[57:19] you see a supernatural vindication that
[57:21] no man can do, this isn't some man's
[57:24] claim. This is what God allows some man
[57:28] to do.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; It happens. And you can look at it as
[57:32] critically as you want. And you're going
[57:34] to have to come up to a conclusion that
[57:36] is supernatural.
[57:38] Right.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Then if God puts it on in this modern
[57:41] age that we're on when in the first
[57:44] message brother Vom we have recorded
[57:46] says now they have a a new recording
[57:49] gadget and and and that's a very
[57:52] specific purpose so that we in this age
[57:56] would be without excuse.
[57:59] we would know that this is a
[58:01] supernatural and then when we determine
[58:03] it is that kind of voice that it is God
[58:06] Almighty speaking then it's incumbent
[58:09] upon us what does it mean to me and what
[58:12] [clears throat] am I supposed to do
[58:13] about it
[58:17] and he says and in the days that we are
[58:19] now living in there is an allotted word
[58:22] not only a lot of time but there's an
[58:24] allotted word a promise for this age and
[58:28] we believe that the Holy Spirit is here
[58:32] on earth now trying to find hearts. He's
[58:37] doing it this morning trying to find
[58:40] hearts. I heard that brother Tom spoke
[58:43] to the students at the school and gave
[58:47] each one a piece of paper. They took a
[58:49] piece of paper. I don't know exactly.
[58:51] And who could say that they knew they
[58:53] were born again? They didn't have to put
[58:55] their name on it. did not have to
[58:57] identify themselves. Who is born again
[59:01] and who may not know that they're born
[59:04] again and who are not born again. And I
[59:09] understand that there was far too large
[59:11] a percentage for our school and our
[59:14] students who come here and listen that
[59:17] could not say they were born again.
[59:20] Perhaps as many as half.
[59:23] Uh, I would say that if you're sitting
[59:26] here and you are,
[59:29] this service is for you, that you need
[59:33] to have something. If your teacher
[59:35] stands up
[59:36] or your principal comes into your room
[59:39] and says something or a minister stands
[59:41] behind this pulpit and says something,
[59:43] we're not here to to eat up some of your
[59:48] time.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; We're here to speak truth. Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; We're here to present something to you
[59:54] that you can say, "I believe that."
[59:59] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it, then you
[1:00:01] need to know why you don't believe it.
[1:00:02] But you need to give yourself. You'll
[1:00:04] never come to believe it unless you give
[1:00:06] yourself to believe it.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And we would not want to think that we
[1:00:11] brainwash anybody. We want to present
[1:00:13] you. And I'm presenting you with
[1:00:15] supernatural. If you want to turn away
[1:00:17] from supernatural things, well, I don't
[1:00:19] believe it anyway. Well, brother Brown
[1:00:21] said it's like going down the basement
[1:00:23] and a man saying, "I don't believe the
[1:00:24] sun is shining."
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; You can you can just be willingly
[1:00:30] ignorant if you want. The Bible says
[1:00:31] that. But I want to be willingly willing
[1:00:34] to hear truth. Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; And when a when a message has and you
[1:00:40] are able to say as believers uh I don't
[1:00:44] the reason I believe this I don't
[1:00:45] believe this just to be you know uh uh
[1:00:49] uh kind of a light light think about
[1:00:51] these things lightly but because there
[1:00:54] is uh
[1:00:56] 1100 almost 1,200 messages recorded
[1:01:01] where you can hear live and there's been
[1:01:04] live witness and live testimony. 20.
[1:01:07] Now, you might say, "Well,
[1:01:10] Brother Ed, I I know all these things."
[1:01:12] No, it's not that we know it. It's what
[1:01:14] we do with it.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:01:24] the scripture says in Ephesians that we
[1:01:26] grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby we
[1:01:30] are, you're sealed until the day of your
[1:01:32] redemption.
[1:01:34] You are sealed until the day of your
[1:01:36] redemption. And he said that's the
[1:01:38] genuine true Easter seal. It shows that
[1:01:42] number one, sin has been paid for. And
[1:01:47] number two, that God has accepted you.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And number three, that you're sealed
[1:01:54] into Christ. And Christ is the word.
[1:01:58] We're not sealed into a paperback book.
[1:02:01] We're not sealed into some mythical
[1:02:03] story, but we're actually sealed into
[1:02:06] one that can do more supernatural things
[1:02:10] in the next few minutes than we could
[1:02:12] even expect beyond our expectation.
[1:02:17] To be sealed is number one, for
[1:02:20] security. For security from Satan,
[1:02:24] you're sealed. Things that are sealed up
[1:02:27] are concealed. They're also hidden and
[1:02:29] held secret.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Think of it for a moment because of what
[1:02:33] I will say in a in just a couple
[1:02:35] minutes. And kept in silence or kept
[1:02:39] secret. Things that are sealed in order
[1:02:43] to prove in order to prove or confirm
[1:02:46] something beyond any doubt. When it's
[1:02:49] unsealed, it's proven to as a testimony
[1:02:54] that he is what he professes to be. if
[1:02:56] something is sealed. All right. Uh
[1:03:01] now, if you should try to say to me, we
[1:03:05] don't believe you're the son of Ed
[1:03:07] Biscll, uh or the son of Fred Biscll. We
[1:03:11] don't believe I I would just smile and
[1:03:15] that's fine. You You believe what you
[1:03:17] want to believe. I happen to know where
[1:03:19] I come from. I happen to know who used
[1:03:22] to spank me. I I I'm very very well
[1:03:25] acquainted. I'm happy to know who
[1:03:27] brought the uh you know the the bacon
[1:03:30] home and and the food home. I happen to
[1:03:32] know that because I lived it. I
[1:03:34] experienced it.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; So a security that you know something is
[1:03:42] still I know when I was young and when
[1:03:45] we were young as as as some of these
[1:03:48] young people uh you know they don't know
[1:03:51] exactly what they're going to become.
[1:03:55] uh because it hasn't been developed yet.
[1:03:57] They don't know exactly what uh what
[1:04:01] traits, what characteristics are still
[1:04:03] in them that just have to be developed.
[1:04:06] And God is a great creator.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Now, uh
[1:04:15] so we were sealed.
[1:04:17] Maybe I'll just say this ahead of time.
[1:04:23] The bride
[1:04:24] body of Jesus Christ
[1:04:28] was sealed in Christ
[1:04:31] just like Eve was sealed in Adam.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; She was sealed
[1:04:39] both
[1:04:40] body her body
[1:04:43] and her
[1:04:47] entire character.
[1:04:50] All that she was, all her feminine
[1:04:52] traits
[1:04:53] were sealed in Adam. Would that be
[1:04:56] right?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that we are
[1:05:04] sealed in Christ. We are hidden in
[1:05:07] Christ.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We've been kept secret in tr.
[1:05:11] Now uh [clears throat]
[1:05:14] God help me here to just give you the
[1:05:16] scope of it because my mind is racing so
[1:05:19] many ways.
[1:05:20] Now the Bible says that Christ that he
[1:05:24] was the creator of all things.
[1:05:28] By him were all things made that are
[1:05:31] made. So it's a continuing.
[1:05:35] We're in time. We're mortals of time. I
[1:05:38] mean we're creatures of time. We're in
[1:05:41] the season, as the prophet said, we're
[1:05:43] in the season of mortal life.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; He is immortal. So, we can't put God
[1:05:49] into a box and say, well, uh uh you
[1:05:53] know, in in our time zone and things
[1:05:56] begin and things end. He's timeless.
[1:05:59] There is no time with God. So uh so God
[1:06:03] was in uh as Jesus said to the religious
[1:06:07] people of that time to the scribes and
[1:06:09] the Pharisees he said uh if you had
[1:06:13] believed Moses you'd believe me
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; because he was a reality back in Moses
[1:06:18] time. He talked about Abraham and and
[1:06:21] and who Abraham worshiped. He says
[1:06:24] before Abraham was I am. So he was the
[1:06:28] reality back then. Here's the reality
[1:06:30] all the way through. All the scriptures
[1:06:32] that were written were spoken of him.
[1:06:35] And here we are now. We're in another
[1:06:37] season. We're not in a season of
[1:06:39] prophesying. We're in a season of
[1:06:41] fulfillment
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; of those things that have been
[1:06:44] prophesied. So all I'm trying to say now
[1:06:47] in summary is that this is a this is a a
[1:06:50] a season. We talk about the season of
[1:06:53] redemption. There was a season when
[1:06:56] Jesus came and paid the price. Now,
[1:06:59] we're in a season where he's claiming
[1:07:01] what he paid. That's simple. You go to a
[1:07:04] pawn shop and you go in one time and and
[1:07:06] say, "Well, here's something here. You
[1:07:08] know, I want to pawn this off. I want to
[1:07:11] pawn this piece of jewelry. I want to
[1:07:13] pawn this piece of equipment off. What
[1:07:15] do you give me for it?" And well, they
[1:07:17] they give you a ticket and they give you
[1:07:19] $5 or 5,000 or whatever more and you
[1:07:22] leave it there. Then there comes a time
[1:07:24] when you're coming to claim it. Here I
[1:07:27] here's the ticket to show I paid the
[1:07:29] price and I'm I'm paying for it now and
[1:07:32] I'm receiving it to myself. So there's a
[1:07:34] a time of claiming it.
[1:07:38] So now he the brother Brandham said he
[1:07:42] is the one who opened the seals.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; And then he went on to say he is those
[1:07:49] seals.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; So now my question is what was sealed
[1:07:54] there? Oh, I'm going to read the seals
[1:07:56] book. The seals book isn't just a bunch
[1:08:00] of words. Like this just isn't a bunch
[1:08:02] of words. This is a person
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; and he was sealed.
[1:08:07] That it is simply indicating that a
[1:08:09] portion of this book right here was
[1:08:12] hidden and sealed. And if it had to be
[1:08:15] sealed, it had to be unsealed at some
[1:08:18] point in time.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] I'm saying and I'm de making these
[1:08:23] declarations to you. We are in the
[1:08:26] season. We are in the season when it was
[1:08:29] unsealed
[1:08:30] and when he was speaking there's so many
[1:08:33] things that indicate
[1:08:35] uh we can bring it for for example in
[1:08:38] the seals which is the the breach they
[1:08:40] have the uh God and simplicity and then
[1:08:43] the breach and right after the breach
[1:08:45] seals 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then the questions
[1:08:48] and answers and the seventh seal. So we
[1:08:52] say now is is this just a book? No, I
[1:08:54] want to say this is a record of a
[1:08:57] people.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; This is a record of a people. We don't
[1:09:02] understand everything, but if you are a
[1:09:04] believer elected for this age, you were
[1:09:07] sealed in there.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; The seals are Christ.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; So, it's like a a lot of people get
[1:09:17] married today, but they're not too sure
[1:09:19] who sure who they get married to. It's a
[1:09:22] great discovery. Marriage is a great
[1:09:24] great discovery. But I always say to
[1:09:27] couples, time is your best friend. And
[1:09:30] it is a it's a very very wise thing to
[1:09:33] get to know one another as the best you
[1:09:37] can prior to marriage because the more
[1:09:41] you find out before, the less you have
[1:09:43] to discover later on.
[1:09:46] Maybe that's just, you know, maybe
[1:09:48] that's just the way I am. But I, you
[1:09:51] know, it it's a great time of discovery.
[1:09:54] And so
[1:09:56] when there when there's a a
[1:10:00] young man, young woman, and and she's
[1:10:02] uh, you know, this is my fiance. I say
[1:10:04] it to so many, don't don't find out
[1:10:08] things later on. Find it all out ahead
[1:10:10] of time.
[1:10:13] I had a young man working for me one
[1:10:15] time and he he was going to get married
[1:10:17] and he wasn't he wasn't saved but he
[1:10:20] also came to church and he he really
[1:10:23] wanted to he admired our lives that I
[1:10:28] and my wife and my children. So he took
[1:10:31] me out for dinner and he said
[1:10:34] he said uh
[1:10:37] brother Ed. He said he didn't call me
[1:10:39] brother but he said he said do you think
[1:10:42] that he named the girl he was marrying.
[1:10:45] He said do you think she needs to know
[1:10:46] about all my bank accounts?
[1:10:50] And I said well it's hard to have things
[1:10:52] hidden. You know if you're going to take
[1:10:54] someone she's going to be you. You know
[1:10:56] you're going to become one. and he
[1:10:58] thought about it that you know he says
[1:11:00] well I'm not going to tell her he said I
[1:11:04] said well have a happy marriage
[1:11:08] you know he he going to start right off
[1:11:10] even before he got married holding some
[1:11:12] secrets about now there might be some of
[1:11:14] you here have a little secret bank
[1:11:16] account all I'm I'm not preaching at you
[1:11:18] I'm just simply saying what I believe
[1:11:21] I'm not I'm not going to tell her he
[1:11:23] pounded and even the dishes bounced on
[1:11:25] the table he hit it so
[1:11:29] But there was a time when the Lord Jesus
[1:11:33] just simply said, "I'm not going to have
[1:11:35] any secrets."
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to unseal myself.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come and call her my bride
[1:11:44] and I will call her out of the churches.
[1:11:47] I will call her and she will know it's
[1:11:49] my voice.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; She will know it's not a man's voice.
[1:11:53] She will know it's not a preacher. It's
[1:11:56] not even just a prophet, but it is me
[1:12:00] myself and I will call her and she'll
[1:12:04] know my voice. And that's part of the
[1:12:06] book of the song, Song of Solomon. She
[1:12:09] says, "My beloved, it's the voice of my
[1:12:11] beloved." And all the other girls on the
[1:12:14] street says, "Who's your beloved?"
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Who who's your beloved? It was a total
[1:12:20] stranger to her to them. But to her, it
[1:12:23] was his voice. I hear the voice of my
[1:12:26] beloved.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking about that voice today.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; So he's he is those seals. He's the one
[1:12:36] that opened the seals and he is the
[1:12:38] seals for the whole word of God is
[1:12:40] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[1:12:43] opened. And what was the opening of the
[1:12:45] seals then? He says the revealing of
[1:12:48] Jesus Christ. That's what it's all about
[1:12:51] friends. It's not a book on the shelf,
[1:12:54] but it's a person. So when the seals
[1:12:56] were broken and he said in one place,
[1:12:59] then you can seal see exactly what's in
[1:13:02] there. He talked about a box car being
[1:13:06] sealed, but it's full of full of
[1:13:08] material. It's full of commodities. It's
[1:13:10] all kinds of stuff in so someone can
[1:13:12] stand outside and say, "I want to tell
[1:13:15] you what's in that box car. This is
[1:13:17] what's in that box car." this. Brother
[1:13:19] Brandham says, "But when the seal is
[1:13:20] broken and you open it up, then you see
[1:13:23] exactly what was in there.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to come from left field,
[1:13:27] which I've been trying to do."
[1:13:31] I said that you were sealed in the seals
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; because the seals were Christ.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Now, if you can't put it together,
[1:13:40] that's fine. Just say amen anyway.
[1:13:43] and and and from the time of your birth
[1:13:46] all the way through there we in the time
[1:13:49] of this mortal season we have human life
[1:13:53] and human character and human frailties
[1:13:56] and human weaknesses and things we like
[1:13:59] about ourselves and things we dislike
[1:14:02] about ourselves. There are some things I
[1:14:05] think we probably hate about ourselves
[1:14:07] and we some things we would like to
[1:14:09] really change about ourselves. Well,
[1:14:14] there are things that are Christlike and
[1:14:16] things we display that are not like
[1:14:18] Christ. Well, I want you to know
[1:14:21] anything
[1:14:23] anything that was in Eve.
[1:14:26] Watch now, please. Eve was sealed in
[1:14:30] Adam when she came out. when she was
[1:14:33] brought forth and the Bible says that
[1:14:36] God brought the woman to the man and so
[1:14:40] whatever I know I don't know anything of
[1:14:42] the uh of of that season but I do know
[1:14:46] then then the serpent who was the most
[1:14:48] subtle came to her and through deception
[1:14:51] deceived her and I can tell you that the
[1:14:54] fall of mankind happened
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; you accept that
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; that will never happen again
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; because this Eve, this second Eve, this
[1:15:07] bride of Jesus Christ is not deceivable.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; She cannot fall.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Now, we carry some traits of the fall
[1:15:19] with us. But but but the scripture says
[1:15:21] and tells us that we are made new
[1:15:24] creatures in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And so even though I may not see, the
[1:15:30] Bible says that we have risen in Christ.
[1:15:33] We're already risen in Christ. The
[1:15:35] prophet speaks of it all also. But I
[1:15:38] haven't I haven't experienced all of it
[1:15:40] yet.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, listen. Now, God said to Abraham,
[1:15:47] "You go walking through the land, and
[1:15:49] wherever you walk, that's yours."
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; So he walked through the land. He just
[1:15:55] kept walking. Every place you put your
[1:15:57] foot, that'll be yours. And he never
[1:16:00] inherited one. He didn't inherit one
[1:16:03] meter of it,
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; even though it was his.
[1:16:07] And then Isaac came and Abraham told
[1:16:10] Isaac, his son, all this is ours. And he
[1:16:14] didn't he didn't inherit it. He didn't
[1:16:16] have like ownership of it. And so what
[1:16:20] had been told him and what was in
[1:16:22] reality seemed very very different. But
[1:16:26] he kept believing what had been told
[1:16:28] him.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; And then came Jacob. And Jacob never
[1:16:32] inherited any part of it.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; But he remembered what had been told
[1:16:39] him.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; So it was what was promised. I have been
[1:16:43] promised and you have been promised.
[1:16:45] I've been promised a completely
[1:16:49] supernatural
[1:16:51] nature and fullness of the character of
[1:16:55] Jesus Christ. I've been promised that
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; when you lose it.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you lose it.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Sometime you become irritated or
[1:17:07] impatient. I'm telling you that the
[1:17:10] promise declares that I am headed for a
[1:17:15] place in Christ. I have a place in
[1:17:18] Christ right now. That Christ is the
[1:17:20] same word. It's a He's promising me.
[1:17:23] He's telling me, you have to go through
[1:17:25] this. You have to take this journey. You
[1:17:27] have to walk this mortal life. You have
[1:17:29] to experience these weaknesses. You have
[1:17:31] to experience these trials. You have to
[1:17:34] experience these things. But there is
[1:17:35] coming a time because I promised it to
[1:17:37] you. you won't have this anymore.
[1:17:41] And so if we as believers, if we if we
[1:17:44] don't look at the promise and keep the
[1:17:46] promise in front of us, you're not
[1:17:48] supposed to keep all the failings in
[1:17:50] front of us and all the all all of the
[1:17:52] labors in front of us. If you keep that
[1:17:54] in front of us, you'll certainly have a
[1:17:56] very miserable life. But if you keep the
[1:17:58] promise in front of you, and Abraham
[1:18:01] could only say, he promised it. He said
[1:18:03] it. I don't even have a son yet. I don't
[1:18:06] even have someone to inherit it yet, but
[1:18:08] he promised that.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; He promised it. It's not up to me to
[1:18:12] fulfill the promise. He's going to do it
[1:18:14] that it's up to me to confess the
[1:18:17] promise.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; So, I confess the promise. IT WAS
[1:18:21] PROMISED. MALACHI 4 was promised. And
[1:18:24] you and and you CAN JUST LAY IT DOWN AND
[1:18:26] FORGET IT. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED. HE'S
[1:18:29] ALREADY SENT HIM. The world may have
[1:18:31] missed it, but he's already sent him.
[1:18:34] and and and Malachi 4 has spoken certain
[1:18:37] things and he said that the seals would
[1:18:39] be opened and so you can say the seals
[1:18:42] are open. Well, I don't even know what
[1:18:44] they mean. That that's just like Abraham
[1:18:46] saying, "I don't know what's over the
[1:18:48] hill, but just keep walking. You'll find
[1:18:50] out what's over the hill." YOU'LL FIND
[1:18:52] OUT WHAT YOU'RE supposed to inherit and
[1:18:55] you'll find yourself becoming stronger
[1:18:57] in the faith.
[1:19:00] Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; So class
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; please just hold fast to this. So the
[1:19:10] bride, her body and character, I will
[1:19:14] say that the bride body of Jesus Christ,
[1:19:17] the elect of God,
[1:19:20] our our our
[1:19:23] change, our body change, which we're so
[1:19:27] looking forward to, that body change
[1:19:31] lays in the promise because he has
[1:19:33] promised it. Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:19:37] the original image. I've got to take my
[1:19:40] time. If I feel right, I won't be able
[1:19:42] to do it. But are you with me? All
[1:19:44] right.
[1:19:49] The original image.
[1:19:54] Now, I said this in Seattle, and I'll
[1:19:57] I'll I want to dwell on it just a little
[1:19:59] bit.
[1:20:01] You listening? When God said
[1:20:06] said, "Let us make man in our image, in
[1:20:08] the image of God created he him." Let us
[1:20:11] make man in our image and in our
[1:20:12] likeness
[1:20:15] and in the image of God made he him.
[1:20:19] Male and female created he them. And
[1:20:22] when he was done, he only had one he
[1:20:24] only had one image in front of him,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; one one that represented him,
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; a son called Adam. And in God is all his
[1:20:34] attributes.
[1:20:36] And in Adam is all his attributes.
[1:20:39] God desired a family. He knew that Adam
[1:20:43] also would have the same desires because
[1:20:45] it reflected him. And so he took out
[1:20:48] from Adam. Now you're you're you're
[1:20:52] adult and I'm going to speak to you as
[1:20:54] adults now. So he took out from him a
[1:20:56] woman a place for his seed.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; God had created the whole earth as a
[1:21:03] womb. It was a place for his seed. Let
[1:21:06] it come forth. Let the waters come
[1:21:08] forth. Let the earth bring forth. Let it
[1:21:10] all bring forth. It wasn't let it die.
[1:21:12] Let it die. Let it die. Let it live. Let
[1:21:14] it live. Let it live. He's the author of
[1:21:17] life.
[1:21:18] It's man who brought the death.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He's the author of life. Let it live.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:28] And so when Eve came forth a place for
[1:21:33] Adam's seed and then she fell and
[1:21:37] brought brought the fall
[1:21:40] her husband with her
[1:21:43] and then God had a conversation with the
[1:21:45] serpent
[1:21:48] and this he said now I want you to
[1:21:51] follow with me very closely. He said to
[1:21:54] the serpent, he didn't say, "Why did you
[1:21:57] think this?"
[1:21:59] He didn't say to Eve, "Why did you think
[1:22:01] this?" He said to why have you done this
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; this act? Why have you done this?
[1:22:08] And I'll put enmity between your seed
[1:22:11] and the seed of the woman. Now, the
[1:22:14] woman didn't have any seed. That's
[1:22:16] right.
[1:22:17] So God spoke then through the prophets
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; said, you know, I'll give her a seed.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; So now that was God's seed coming and
[1:22:31] he's already told the serpent, I'm going
[1:22:34] to put enmity between your seed and her
[1:22:37] seed. Then came forth Jesus Christ and
[1:22:41] his seed held stones in their hand to
[1:22:43] slay him. Exactly like Cain held
[1:22:46] something in his hand to slay Abel. So
[1:22:49] it's identically the same thing. And
[1:22:51] then he said he said to uh the serpent
[1:22:56] he said dust shalt thou eat. Now he had
[1:23:00] just taken the bodies of Adam. Out of
[1:23:05] the dust the Bible says and out of the
[1:23:08] out of the dust of the earth he created
[1:23:10] a body for Adam.
[1:23:14] Now he said to the serpent, "Dust shall
[1:23:17] you eat." In other words, you will eat
[1:23:19] of death.
[1:23:21] You'll just eat of death. You'll feed on
[1:23:23] death. Is very important. Now,
[1:23:27] the only body
[1:23:29] that he has now fed on was the body of
[1:23:33] Jesus Christ.
[1:23:35] Because when the two men in their
[1:23:38] physical bodies ran to the tomb and the
[1:23:42] Bible says very clearly that the garment
[1:23:47] was rolled up here and the napkin around
[1:23:50] his head was placed over here, but the
[1:23:53] body they could not find.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Think about it now for just a moment.
[1:24:02] Think about it because I have a I have a
[1:24:04] little distance to go. The body they
[1:24:07] could not find. Now friends, we've just
[1:24:10] announced here. Brother Wman has just
[1:24:13] passed and gone to have a burial of some
[1:24:16] kind or whatever more. Satan feeds on
[1:24:21] death,
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; but he never can. Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He can never have the body of Jesus
[1:24:28] Christ
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; to feed on. And the Bible says, now
[1:24:33] here's the promise. We can sit here. I'm
[1:24:35] white-haired. Some are white-haired.
[1:24:37] Some have lost their hair. Some of you
[1:24:39] are young and the beauty of your youth.
[1:24:41] But the scripture says he will give to
[1:24:44] unto us a glorious body like unto his
[1:24:49] body.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Not the body that was bleeding with
[1:24:52] thorns in his head and mutilated. Not
[1:24:56] the body that had the beard pulled out
[1:24:58] of it. Not that body, but whatever came
[1:25:01] out of the tomb. AND THAT WAS A CHANGED
[1:25:04] BODY.
[1:25:05] Changed body. Because when they went and
[1:25:08] LOOKED IN THERE, THERE WAS NO BODY.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to ask you, you know, I'm
[1:25:15] filled with QUESTIONS ALSO. AND I'M
[1:25:17] ASKING YOU QUESTIONS. WHO CLOTHED HIM?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you're silent. Who clothed him?
[1:25:25] cuz he left the robes there to SHOW THAT
[1:25:28] NOTHING OF THIS WORLD. NOTHING OF THE OF
[1:25:32] THE LIFE THAT CAME BY A NATURAL BIRTH.
[1:25:35] Nothing was needed on the other side.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; And he was on THE OTHER SIDE. HE WAS
[1:25:41] FULLY CLOTHED. And Mary saw him and he
[1:25:45] looked like a gardener in THE GARDEN.
[1:25:47] WHERE HAVE YOU TAKEN HIM? SHE DIDN'T
[1:25:49] EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE CLOTHES are
[1:25:52] something newly created. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:57] WE HAVE WE OUR MINDS ARE SO CORRUPTED BY
[1:26:00] THIS WORLD. WE WE CAN HARDLY EXPAND THEM
[1:26:03] TO THINK AND I'D LIKE THIS CONGREGATION
[1:26:05] TO SAY THAT'S SO GLORIOUS, BROTHER ED.
[1:26:08] THAT'S SO MARVELOUS.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
[1:26:13] THAT.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; How many believe he came out of the
[1:26:16] tomb? Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; How many BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CLOTHED?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID HE WILL GIVE US A GLORIOUS
[1:26:24] BODY, LIGHT UNTO HIS GLORIOUS BODY.
[1:26:27] THAT'S THE PROMISE. THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M
[1:26:29] LOOKING AT HERE. I'M NOT LOOKING AT WHAT
[1:26:32] WE HAVE HERE. I'M NOT LOOKING AT THIS
[1:26:34] FLESH AND CLAY. I'M LOOKING AT THE
[1:26:36] PROMISE FROM GOD'S WORD. We shall not
[1:26:39] ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; IN A MOMENT and in a twinkling of an
[1:26:45] eye. That is the promise. AND
[1:26:47] FURTHERMORE, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD SEND
[1:26:49] A MESSENGER TO ALERT US THAT THIS TIME
[1:26:53] WAS COMING UPON US.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, YOUNG PEOPLE. WE I MAY NOT
[1:26:57] LIVE TO SAY IT, BUT SURELY YOU WILL. I
[1:27:00] EVEN ANTICIPATE IT BECAUSE I HAVE EVERY
[1:27:03] reason to anticipate it. GOD SAID HE
[1:27:05] WOULD SEND A MESSENGER AND HE WOULD OPEN
[1:27:08] the seals and the lamb would open the
[1:27:10] seals. Isn't it amazing? WHEN THIS
[1:27:12] MESSENGER COMES, HE BEGINS TO speak
[1:27:15] about Boaz.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Boaz, the kinsman redeemer. Now, here
[1:27:21] comes the last messenger, and he's
[1:27:23] talking about kinsman. Boaz, the kinsman
[1:27:26] redeemer, goes to the Old Testament,
[1:27:29] refers to him in I think 59 or 60 or
[1:27:34] perhaps a few more than 60 times refers
[1:27:38] to Boaz as the kinsman redeemer. What is
[1:27:42] the redeemer doing? He's redeeming. And
[1:27:45] then Boaz didn't only come and identify
[1:27:47] her. Boaz didn't only come and was
[1:27:50] introduced to Ruth. Boaz finally came
[1:27:54] and he went through the ceremony of
[1:27:56] purchasing her AND THEN HE CLAIMED HER.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; God sent you a messenger.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; I'm bringing it right. GOD SENT YOU
[1:28:06] PERSONALLY a messenger to tell you about
[1:28:09] this thing. Maybe you haven't read it.
[1:28:11] Maybe you haven't studied it. But now
[1:28:13] you can at least believe me as one who's
[1:28:15] given his time to find out these things.
[1:28:19] And of the many times, 59 or 60 times he
[1:28:23] spoke of Boaz,
[1:28:26] only twice after the seals.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; All the time before the SEALS CUZ HE'S
[1:28:33] ANNOUNCING BOAZ IS GOING TO COME.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Boaz is going to do the redeeming. Boaz
[1:28:40] is a kinsman redeemer. And then when he
[1:28:42] COMES TO THE BREACH JUST BEFORE THE
[1:28:44] SEALS, IT'S BOAZ and Ruth. And Boaz and
[1:28:47] RUTH AND BOAZ. WHY? BECAUSE THE TIME
[1:28:50] ARRIVED.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He's telling YOU AS A CONGREGATION, HE'S
[1:28:55] TELLING HIS PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT'S
[1:28:58] HAPPENING.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And this ONE THAT HE HE HE HE DEMON THIS
[1:29:02] ONE THAT HE EXPRESSED AND DEMONSTRATED
[1:29:04] AND MANIFESTED who had THIS KIND OF
[1:29:07] KNOWLEDGE. IT WASN'T HE SAID THAT'S NOT
[1:29:09] A MAN. THAT'S HIM.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; And now HE HAD TO COME INTO HIS OFFICE
[1:29:13] OF BOAZ AND DO THE REDEEMING. AND HE
[1:29:16] SAYS TWICE IN THE TWICE in the breach,
[1:29:19] HE SAYS, "WHAT IS WHAT IS WHAT'S
[1:29:21] HAPPENING? WHAT WHAT IS IT DOING NOW?"
[1:29:23] HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BOOK. THE BOOK'S
[1:29:25] IN the hands of the lamb. HE SAID,
[1:29:27] "WHAT'S IT DOING?" HE SAID, "WAITING FOR
[1:29:29] REDEMPTION'S CLAIMS." NOT WAITING FOR
[1:29:33] REDEMPTION. WAITING FOR THE CLAIM.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; THE CLAIM IS COMING WITH THE TICKET AND
[1:29:40] SAYING, "YOU'RE MINE. I HAVE THE PROOF.
[1:29:43] HERE'S THE SUPERNATURAL PROOF. I BOUGHT
[1:29:45] YOU.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO ME. AND NOW HAS COME THE
[1:29:49] TIME OF REDEMPTION CLAIMS. AND ONCE THE
[1:29:52] SEALS THE NEXT YEARS AFTER THE SEALS
[1:29:55] FROM 63 TO ALMOST 66,
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; he mentions Boaz once in ' 64, ONCE IN '
[1:30:04] 65. WHY? BECAUSE THE WORK WAS DONE.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; THE WORK WAS FINISHED. I'M TELLING YOU
[1:30:11] FOLKS, IT WAS ALREADY FINISHED. AND IF
[1:30:14] THAT WAS BACK THERE IN ' 65, 64, you
[1:30:17] say, "OH, THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO." THAT
[1:30:19] ISN'T EVEN A BREATH TO GOD.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT EVEN A BREATH TO GOD. HE KNOWS
[1:30:23] NOTHING ABOUT TIME. AND SO, WE NEED TO
[1:30:26] IDENTIFY THE season that we're in. AND
[1:30:29] THIS IS THE SEASON, THE SEASON, THE
[1:30:32] SEASON OF REDEMPTION. WE ARE IN THE
[1:30:35] FINAL ACT OF REDEMPTION.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED ALREADY. CLAIM.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE SAID THAT, I CAN TELL YOU I
[1:30:45] WAS WAITING.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; I was one that was WAITING FOR
[1:30:49] REDEMPTION CLAIM. I'M not waiting
[1:30:51] anymore. I'VE ALREADY BEEN CLAIMED.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; BUT I and a lot of other people AND ALL
[1:30:56] KINDS OF CHURCHES. YOU WENT THROUGH THIS
[1:30:58] CHURCH, THAT CHURCH, THIS THIS BELIEF,
[1:31:00] THAT BELIEF. AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING,
[1:31:02] THERE WAS SOMETHING YEARNING, YEARNING,
[1:31:04] YEARNING. And and because you YOU YOU
[1:31:07] WERE ONE THAT WAS TO BE CLAIMED.
[1:31:12] AMEN.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; No prophet
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; or angels could open the book. In other
[1:31:25] words, no one else. And in the book, I
[1:31:30] want to put it this way. I want to get
[1:31:31] away from the book for a moment. Said
[1:31:33] your name was in the book. Your name,
[1:31:36] which I've said many times, is simply
[1:31:38] your character.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; That's what your name is CONNECTED TO,
[1:31:42] IS YOUR CHARACTER. That's why brother
[1:31:44] Brandham even said that some of them
[1:31:46] that God called, they had to change
[1:31:48] their name. I'm not telling people to
[1:31:50] change their name, but I'm saying God
[1:31:52] changed their name because Abram Abram
[1:31:55] couldn't bring FORTH THE KIND OF SEED
[1:31:58] THAT ABRAHAM COULD BRING forth
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; because God ASSOCIATED HIS NAME WITH HE
[1:32:04] THE H HE PUT IN THERE and that
[1:32:06] associated it with God.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And that should mean something also to
[1:32:10] us. When he talked about Billy Graham,
[1:32:13] he had his part to play. He was a
[1:32:16] messenger to the world. And Branham was
[1:32:19] a messenger to us
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; and we SHOULD NEVER SHY AWAY FROM THAT.
[1:32:25] GOD ASSOCIATED THAT NAME WITH DIVINITY.
[1:32:28] HALLELUJAH. Because that which WAS IN
[1:32:31] HIM WAS A DIVINE ONE.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THAT THAT IS IN YOU AS A
[1:32:37] BORNAGAIN, HOLY GHOST FILILLED, holy
[1:32:41] ghostfilled
[1:32:43] son or daughter of God, YOU HAVE
[1:32:45] DIVINITY DWELLING IN YOU and never back
[1:32:49] away from that. PEOPLE SAY THAT'S A
[1:32:51] CULT. SAY I LOVE THAT CULT.
[1:32:55] AND YOU'VE GOT TO CONFESS THAT I HAVE A
[1:32:58] DIVINE one in me. IT'S CALLED GOD, THE
[1:33:02] CREATOR OF HEAVENS AND EARTH. He's in
[1:33:04] me. And he's GIVEN ME AS HIS CHILD. I AM
[1:33:07] HIS SON. I AM HIS DAUGHTER. AND YOU MUST
[1:33:09] NEVER MOVE FROM THAT.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; If you move away from that, Satan loves
[1:33:19] it.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; When you move away from that,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; he says, "Man was a secondary God on the
[1:33:30] earth.
[1:33:32] He was given the power to control
[1:33:34] things, all elements of the earth. And
[1:33:37] that was Adam. Adam was given the great
[1:33:39] powers. But then notice now what he
[1:33:42] said. I read this once to you and I felt
[1:33:45] it kind of went over the heads of most
[1:33:47] people. Adam was given great powers, but
[1:33:51] then the power that he was given to make
[1:33:55] himself is where he fell.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] Adam could not reproduce himself in the
[1:34:02] original form.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And I've been pointing out to you when
[1:34:06] the men ran to see the tomb and the tomb
[1:34:08] was empty. Now, we've gone all the way
[1:34:10] from the birth to the tomb and the tomb
[1:34:12] was empty. It was a different KIND OF A
[1:34:15] BODY that came in that came out of the
[1:34:17] tomb than went into the tomb.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; We already have a body like went into
[1:34:22] the tomb. He got hungry. WE GET HUNGRY.
[1:34:25] HE SWEAT WHEN HE WAS HOT. HE
[1:34:27] PROSPERSPIRED. HE WAS HE he he needed to
[1:34:30] sleep when he was tired. THAT'S THE BODY
[1:34:32] we have. BUT WHEN HE CAME OUT of that
[1:34:35] tomb with a GLORIOUS BODY, THAT'S THE
[1:34:38] ONE HE PROMISED US.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HIS PROMISE.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; AND THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING WELL UP
[1:34:46] WITHIN YOU SAY, "Oh God, I WANT THAT
[1:34:49] BODY. I WANT THAT PROMISE. THAT IS MY
[1:34:54] PROMISE. I WILL NOT DENY IT. I WON'T LET
[1:34:57] THE ENEMY I WON'T LET THE ENEMY DILUTE
[1:35:00] THAT. I'M GOING TO BELIEVE THAT.
[1:35:12] Now just to kind of summarize and and
[1:35:16] and uh
[1:35:19] let this be distilled
[1:35:22] and this is the best and one of brother
[1:35:24] Brandham's last imagine God's prophet
[1:35:27] giving his last words to the age in
[1:35:31] message things that are to be.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; So he says so a prophet is a reflector
[1:35:36] of God.
[1:35:38] He is made so that he cannot speak. Now,
[1:35:41] you need to hold these words very close
[1:35:43] and listen very, very close. Don't be
[1:35:46] distracted at all because then I'm going
[1:35:48] to come to something scientific in a
[1:35:50] moment that's right in your time. In
[1:35:54] fact, it's research that hasn't been
[1:35:56] completely concluded and finished.
[1:35:59] They're just waiting to put it now into
[1:36:02] actual into practice. And it was for
[1:36:05] medical reasons is what they were
[1:36:07] discovering these things for. But he
[1:36:09] said a prophet is a reflector of God. He
[1:36:12] is made so that he cannot speak his own
[1:36:15] words.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; It has to be God's words that he speaks.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; He's just like a reflector
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; and he is God's mouthpiece.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I know that you've heard these words.
[1:36:30] You've you've agreed with them before,
[1:36:31] but now I want to go beyond agreement.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; So, I believe that with all my heart and
[1:36:37] soul,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; and that's the only way it'll work for
[1:36:40] you.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; That's the only way it'll work.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; It's not, well, I believe that, but you
[1:36:45] know, I have some questions. No, then
[1:36:47] you're defeated right before you start.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He says he's just a reflector in his
[1:36:52] God's mouthpiece. So, and so therefore,
[1:36:56] he said, "A virgin shall conceive." He
[1:36:59] probably could not understand it, but
[1:37:01] God had spoke it through him
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; because he promised that. That's why he
[1:37:08] spoke it through him, through Isaiah,
[1:37:11] because he had promised it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Promised it way back in Eden.
[1:37:16] He would do nothing until he revealed it
[1:37:18] to his servants, the prophets. Then when
[1:37:21] he said that, it was 800 years before
[1:37:24] that ever came to pass. But it had to
[1:37:27] come to pass.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Finally, those words anchored in the
[1:37:33] womb of a virgin, and she conceived and
[1:37:36] brought forth Emmanuel unto us the child
[1:37:38] is born, a son is given. His name shall
[1:37:41] be called counselor, the mighty God, the
[1:37:43] prince of peace, the everlasting. He
[1:37:44] said that had to be that way.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] That had to be that way because God had
[1:37:53] spoke it
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; through the mouth of his prophets and
[1:37:57] all the words of God had to be
[1:37:59] fulfilled. Now that explains why I said
[1:38:02] at the beginning why I believe
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; The word I believe
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; is because it is it has been proven. And
[1:38:11] if anyone wants to doubt it, they first
[1:38:14] have to explain the supernatural in
[1:38:17] brother Brandon's ministry before they
[1:38:19] can deal with any other subject.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And you notice all these critics, they
[1:38:24] never deal with the supernatural because
[1:38:26] they cannot explain the supernatural.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; So they explain some other reasoning OR
[1:38:32] WHATEVER. LISTEN, THEY reasoned away the
[1:38:34] death of Jesus. They reasoned away his
[1:38:37] resurrection. What are we going to do
[1:38:39] with it? They reasoned it away
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; and they believe it.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THAT HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND
[1:38:47] STOLE HIM AWAY. THEY LOVED HIM TOO MUCH.
[1:38:50] THAT'S a very nice story.
[1:38:53] Which I was told by a very well-educated
[1:38:56] businessman in Morocco. And I just
[1:38:58] stopped him and I said, "Regardless of
[1:39:00] how holy a man I might be, I could not
[1:39:05] purchase you even a moment in eternal
[1:39:08] life." He said, "No, that's exactly
[1:39:10] right." I said, "And regardless, I don't
[1:39:13] know you, but regardless of," and he was
[1:39:15] vice president of the BA Oil Company. I
[1:39:17] said, "Regardless of how righteous a man
[1:39:21] you may be," and I believe of the Muslim
[1:39:24] faith, and he he probably prayed five
[1:39:26] times a day, which was more than I was
[1:39:29] doing. But I I said, "Well, regardless
[1:39:31] of how holy or you might be, you
[1:39:34] couldn't purchase me any time in etern
[1:39:36] as eternal life." And he got very sober.
[1:39:39] He said, "That's true."
[1:39:42] I said, "Listen, sir.
[1:39:45] Here's my children,
[1:39:47] my wife, and myself, and all of us in
[1:39:50] this room." I said, 'If that was not the
[1:39:53] son of God
[1:39:55] that hung on that cross and died as a
[1:39:59] sacrifice for our sins, we are all lost.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Completely lost.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; And this is what he said to me. He said,
[1:40:10] "That's very interesting. We've never
[1:40:12] heard it that way before."
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's the supernatural aspect. Yes,
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; he died a death like a human dies. He
[1:40:25] had to die because it was death was the
[1:40:27] sentence
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; in Eden.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; HE ALSO WAS FULFILLING THE SCRIPTURE,
[1:40:33] THE SAME SCRIPTURE WE FULFILLED. BUT
[1:40:36] WHEN HE WAS MOVING TO THE CROSS, HE SAID
[1:40:38] ALL THESE THINGS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF
[1:40:41] WHAT WAS SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHETS. HE
[1:40:44] DIDN'T HAVE A HE didn't have a problem
[1:40:46] with what the prophet spoke. HE SAID,
[1:40:48] "ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED." AS FAR IN
[1:40:50] REALITY, HE WAS he was HE HAD A HUGE
[1:40:53] CONGREGATION, 5,000, and they left him.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he's left WITH THE
[1:41:00] HE'S LEFT WITH JUST HIS DISCIPLES. AND
[1:41:02] ONE OF THOSE IS A DEVIL.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THOSE IS GOING TO DENY HIM.
[1:41:07] ONE OF THOSE IS GOING TO SELL THEM OUT
[1:41:08] FOR 30 PIECES OF SILVER, NOT REALIZING.
[1:41:12] And the PROPHET EVEN SAID, JUDAS DIDN'T
[1:41:14] EXPECT IT TO GO THERE. HE DIDN'T EXPECT
[1:41:17] THE CROSS. HE DIDN'T EXPECT THE cru
[1:41:19] cruelty. And that's why he came back
[1:41:21] with the 30 pieces of silver in
[1:41:23] repentance AND THREW IT DOWN ON THE
[1:41:26] FLOOR AND SAID, "TAKE IT BACK. I WANT
[1:41:28] NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS." NO. They said,
[1:41:30] "What you what what's done is done.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You've made your denial."
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; You talk about sobering time.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends.
[1:41:46] God is just not some wimpy kind of being
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; where you can just treat him any way you
[1:41:52] want and oh, he'll love me and take me
[1:41:54] back. You better take him while he's
[1:41:56] calling because he may never call again.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And if he calls some of you young
[1:42:01] people, some of you young boys and
[1:42:02] girls, HE CALLS YOU, YOU GIVE YOURSELF
[1:42:05] TO HIM AND NEVER TURN AWAY FROM IT.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:16] He said, "God came down in a blood
[1:42:18] cell." Just quickly because I'm not I'm
[1:42:20] I'm not right quite at my point yet. He
[1:42:23] came down in a blood cell, not through a
[1:42:25] man, but by the Holy Ghost. And in that
[1:42:28] virgin womb, a tabernacle for the
[1:42:31] purpose of death was built.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; A tabernacle for the purpose of death
[1:42:40] was built.
[1:42:43] Now
[1:42:46] I want to loosen loosen up your mental
[1:42:50] your mind a moment. I'll have your
[1:42:53] attention.
[1:42:55] researchers
[1:42:56] are developing a system and brother
[1:42:59] Brandham says in countdown.
[1:43:02] He says in countdown
[1:43:07] he said the happenings on earth
[1:43:10] how the happenings on earth
[1:43:14] always in this earth are representing
[1:43:17] something
[1:43:19] that comes from somewhere else.
[1:43:22] Happenings on this earth are always
[1:43:25] representing something that comes from
[1:43:28] somewhere else. But when it strikes the
[1:43:30] earth, it's usually in a perverted
[1:43:32] condition
[1:43:36] because it is in the world of darkness
[1:43:38] and sin. But then there is a true
[1:43:42] representation
[1:43:44] in the spiritual realms of other
[1:43:46] dimensions.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Friends, we are a supernatural
[1:43:51] people.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; We are a people that must while we're on
[1:43:55] in this earth and while we're walking
[1:43:57] and claiming certain promises, our
[1:44:00] promises must not be limited
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; to our jobs and our life in our
[1:44:07] marriages and our relationship and our
[1:44:09] families. That's just a small part of
[1:44:12] it. This is only representative. We are
[1:44:15] even our life our whole scope of our
[1:44:17] life here is only a reflection of
[1:44:19] something that is taking place
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; and you have a BODY HERE BUT YOU HAVE A
[1:44:24] BODY THERE.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You have a king. You have a savior. You
[1:44:29] have a redeemer but ONE DAY IT WILL BE
[1:44:32] IT'LL BE IT'S FACE TO FACE NOW BUT IT'LL
[1:44:34] BE MORE FACE TO FACE IN THAT YOU WILL
[1:44:37] PHYSICALLY YOU'LL BE IN A BODY.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And I BELIEVE THAT BROTHER
[1:44:42] BRANDON'S MESSAGE CAME TO ALERT US TO
[1:44:44] THE TIME THAT WE'RE IN.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, HE OPENED THE SEALS."
[1:44:48] I'LL TELL YOU, CHRIST OPENED THE SEALS
[1:44:51] AND ALLOWED HIM TO SPEAK IT. AND WHEN HE
[1:44:53] SPOKE IT, YOU HEARD YOUR NAME BECAUSE
[1:44:55] YOU YOU SAW A REFLECTION OF A LIFE. THAT
[1:44:58] WAS SOMETHING YOU LONGED FOR, SOMETHING
[1:45:00] YOU DESIRED. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT
[1:45:03] DESIRE, YOU WEREN'T THERE IN THE FIRST
[1:45:05] PLACE.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S HARD TO SAY.
[1:45:09] AMEN.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Researchers
[1:45:15] are developing a system for persons that
[1:45:17] are handicapped. This is what they're
[1:45:19] working towards. Handicapped with
[1:45:21] paralysis
[1:45:22] whereby they will be able to communicate
[1:45:25] with a computer
[1:45:27] through mental thought or intent.
[1:45:32] Now, if you've got good memories class,
[1:45:36] you remember I spoke on in the
[1:45:39] beginning, God created the heavens and
[1:45:40] the earth, and God said,
[1:45:43] and I stopped and asked you, what did
[1:45:45] God say?
[1:45:48] He didn't say in English, let there be
[1:45:51] light.
[1:45:54] Did he say it in Hebrew?
[1:45:56] I doubt it.
[1:45:59] Didn't say it in Greek. What What did he
[1:46:00] say?
[1:46:02] Did he just grunt?
[1:46:04] Did he make any sound at all?
[1:46:07] God said, "Let there be light."
[1:46:12] And the word and God said is
[1:46:16] he could have thought it,
[1:46:19] he could have uttered it,
[1:46:22] he could have just intended it. This was
[1:46:25] his intent.
[1:46:34] You know,
[1:46:36] my hearing is not that good these days,
[1:46:38] but it's good enough. And I can tell if
[1:46:42] my wife is happy or pleased or
[1:46:44] displeased. I don't even have to
[1:46:46] understand the words.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard something say, "Oh,
[1:46:52] why did you say, "Oh, because you
[1:46:55] understood what was intended.
[1:47:04] Whatever it was in the beginning, God
[1:47:08] said, "Let there be light." You can't
[1:47:10] tell me what he said.
[1:47:13] But I can tell you what he intended
[1:47:15] because whatever he said and and the
[1:47:19] prophet said, "If it if it just came a
[1:47:21] fog, then he didn't say light." That's
[1:47:24] right.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; If he said a light, then the proof of
[1:47:28] that is that light came.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:47:36] And the researchers are working on
[1:47:38] something now. In fact, as it's been
[1:47:40] developed, it's already developed.
[1:47:42] They've they've uh they've put all of
[1:47:44] this to work and it and it functions
[1:47:47] quite well. I'll I'll continue to read.
[1:47:49] The human brain sends out signals
[1:47:53] which translate into commands that the
[1:47:56] body responds to. So the human brain
[1:48:01] sends out signals. Well, this is old
[1:48:03] stuff to a lot of you young people. The
[1:48:06] human brain is sending out signals.
[1:48:09] I wrote down the signal, mental signal
[1:48:13] of faith.
[1:48:16] [snorts]
[1:48:17] Hallelujah. I believe that sends a
[1:48:20] signal to my hands. Glory to God
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; to my feet. I am free.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord to my mouth and my lips.
[1:48:30] Hallelujah. Why? Because I believe it.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; So I might even preach on the signal of
[1:48:40] faith.
[1:48:42] And then the medical research has
[1:48:44] succeeded has succeeded in causing
[1:48:47] patients to activate certain physical
[1:48:50] movements by act sending signals to the
[1:48:54] brain.
[1:48:57] Today man can create a computer voice
[1:49:01] which is signals sent through a
[1:49:03] mechanism that speaks a sound we
[1:49:07] understand.
[1:49:08] It's just a signal
[1:49:11] in a com in in a computer world. This is
[1:49:14] out of their magazine apparently.
[1:49:16] Researchers at Northwestern University
[1:49:18] that is in Utah have developed a device
[1:49:21] that they say can deliver me messengers
[1:49:25] messages from the brain directly to the
[1:49:28] muscles. Listen close. Skipping over the
[1:49:31] spinal cord. So they're passing over the
[1:49:36] nervous system and sending the signal
[1:49:40] directly to the muscle and the muscle
[1:49:43] will do it.
[1:49:45] We're just starting
[1:49:47] and don't forget countdown
[1:49:55] skipping over the spinal cord. He said
[1:49:57] we are eavesdropping
[1:49:59] on the natural electrical signals from
[1:50:02] the brain that tell the arm and hand how
[1:50:05] to move and sending those signals
[1:50:08] directly to the muscles. They're
[1:50:10] actually easedropping on the brain
[1:50:13] sending the signals.
[1:50:16] Don't move around, please. Researchers
[1:50:19] have been able to translate
[1:50:22] brain signals into speech
[1:50:28] using sensors attached to the surface of
[1:50:31] the brain for the first time. The
[1:50:33] breakthrough
[1:50:35] which is up to 90% accurate
[1:50:39] offers a way to communicate for
[1:50:42] paralyzed patients which cannot speak
[1:50:46] and could eventually lead to being able
[1:50:48] to lead to read anyone's
[1:50:51] anyone thoughts.
[1:50:54] We are based, we are beside ourselves
[1:50:57] with excitement when it started working,
[1:51:00] said Professor Bradley Greger, a
[1:51:02] bioengineer
[1:51:04] who led the team of researchers. We have
[1:51:06] been able to decode spoken words using
[1:51:10] only signals from the brain with a
[1:51:13] device that has promised for has
[1:51:15] promised for long-term use in paralyzed
[1:51:19] patients who can who cannot now speak.
[1:51:23] They can't speak. So this is the key.
[1:51:25] How is it going to happen?
[1:51:28] I would call it, he said, brain reading.
[1:51:32] And we hope that in two or three years,
[1:51:34] and this is two years ago, so it's
[1:51:36] coming right up, that it will be
[1:51:38] available for use for paralyzed
[1:51:41] patients.
[1:51:43] The computer picked up the patient's
[1:51:45] brain waves as he talked and did not use
[1:51:49] any voice recognition
[1:51:51] software.
[1:51:53] Because just thinking a word
[1:51:58] and not saying it is thought to produce
[1:52:01] the same brain signals. Professor Greger
[1:52:05] and his team believe that soon they will
[1:52:07] be able to have translation device and
[1:52:11] voice box that repeats the word you are
[1:52:14] thinking.
[1:52:18] What is more,
[1:52:21] think of countdown now. The brain of
[1:52:25] people who are paralyzed are often
[1:52:28] healthy and produce the same signals as
[1:52:32] though they were able-bodied people.
[1:52:36] It is just they are blocked by the
[1:52:39] injury from reaching the muscle.
[1:52:45] This is proof of concept. We have proven
[1:52:48] these signals can tell you what the
[1:52:51] person is saying well above chance. But
[1:52:55] we need to be able to do more words and
[1:52:58] more accuracy before it is something a
[1:53:01] patient really might find useful. People
[1:53:05] who eventually could benefit from a
[1:53:07] wireless device that converts thoughts
[1:53:10] into computer spoken words include those
[1:53:14] paralyzed by stroke, disease, and
[1:53:16] injury. Professor Greger said, and I
[1:53:20] want to just conclude now quickly. He
[1:53:23] said, "People who are now locked in." I
[1:53:26] want you to think of this spiritually
[1:53:30] because I'm going to come from left
[1:53:32] field and surprise I think many of you.
[1:53:35] People who are now locked in often
[1:53:37] communicate with any movement they can
[1:53:40] make. Blinking an eye or moving a hand
[1:53:43] slightly. Thought of your father,
[1:53:47] sister
[1:53:51] Paulo Sally.
[1:53:55] to arduously pick up letters or words
[1:53:58] from a list.
[1:54:00] The new device would allow them freedom
[1:54:02] to speak on their own.
[1:54:05] They simply think it
[1:54:09] because in thinking it, it sends a brain
[1:54:12] signal.
[1:54:15] You might think just now,
[1:54:19] I'm not getting anything out of this.
[1:54:24] Uh God heard it.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; And if you think it enough, you'll find
[1:54:31] it will bring action to the body and you
[1:54:35] won't want to come to church.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; You say you're my friend.
[1:54:48] Okay. Come here, Timothy.
[1:54:52] You're a young man here in the church.
[1:54:55] We've known each other a long time and
[1:54:58] you're my friend. So, I'll shake hands
[1:55:00] with you.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz my brain is saying I I'm not a
[1:55:04] hypocrite.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Neither are you.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Good. So, we can do that in reality.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Good. Am I squeezing your hand? It's
[1:55:15] because my signal is saying squeeze his
[1:55:17] hand.
[1:55:19] make him know that.
[1:55:22] Now, that's fine. Now, if I ever start
[1:55:24] thinking,
[1:55:27] I don't know if I really care for him
[1:55:31] anymore.
[1:55:34] That sends a signal and I may not shake
[1:55:37] his hand next time.
[1:55:39] And fact is, if I allowed that to
[1:55:42] continue and say, "You know what? He
[1:55:44] didn't shake my hand. He didn't even
[1:55:45] look at me. I think what I'll do, I'll
[1:55:48] just go the other side. I'll take
[1:55:49] another hallway here so I don't meet him
[1:55:52] because my brain signals are telling my
[1:55:55] body what to do.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Person might be sitting here and you
[1:56:01] might not even be born again. And you
[1:56:03] might say,
[1:56:05] "Wow."
[1:56:07] I mean that God even knows. No wonder
[1:56:10] the scripture says now in fact is here's
[1:56:14] what I wanted to come to at the
[1:56:15] beginning but I need to lay all this
[1:56:17] out.
[1:56:19] The Bible exploded to me.
[1:56:24] Verses started coming from all over the
[1:56:26] place and things in the message and you
[1:56:29] don't know what I went through. in fact
[1:56:31] is I'll tell brother Aaron while he's
[1:56:33] here that's where I was and I my
[1:56:35] computer started acting up and I was
[1:56:37] saying devil get out of this thing even
[1:56:40] to this morning that's the first time in
[1:56:43] my life the computer my printer failed
[1:56:47] to print this message wouldn't want to
[1:56:49] print it I can tell you why he wouldn't
[1:56:52] want to print it
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; he doesn't want you to hear this
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; and furthermore
[1:56:59] it says here in this study
[1:57:02] that they have been able to translate
[1:57:05] the brain signals further. Just listen
[1:57:07] now for just a moment.
[1:57:10] And that
[1:57:12] uh an individual
[1:57:15] although he might be completely
[1:57:16] paralyzed and mute mute mute cannot say
[1:57:21] a word. He can just have in his mind an
[1:57:25] incant.
[1:57:28] And the signal that comes from a human
[1:57:30] brain that's going to lie motionless
[1:57:34] without thought in a grave someday
[1:57:38] that that brain will send a signal an
[1:57:41] intent and his intent will speak out of
[1:57:45] the computer and say the word.
[1:57:49] Okay.
[1:57:50] Now we have a messenger and that's why I
[1:57:52] started out this morning saying this is
[1:57:55] why I believe what I believe.
[1:57:58] Now we have a messenger
[1:58:00] and he stands before someone.
[1:58:04] He says, "Are we strangers? Raise your
[1:58:06] hand." They raise your hand. I don't
[1:58:08] know you. You don't know me.
[1:58:11] And then he starts to say now just to
[1:58:14] help you believe.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; They aren't at the place of believing
[1:58:20] yet for healing. Uh-huh.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; to help you believe.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And he says to one woman, I have it
[1:58:32] here. So remarkable.
[1:58:34] He said, "Uh,
[1:58:37] now I see fields stretching out in front
[1:58:42] of me." It was in Chicago. He's in
[1:58:45] surrounded by concrete. He says, "I see
[1:58:48] fields stretching out in front of me.
[1:58:52] He said that it looks like it's fields
[1:58:54] of wheat.
[1:58:56] He said you are not from this place.
[1:59:01] You have come from Canada
[1:59:04] and you're not standing here for
[1:59:05] yourself.
[1:59:07] You're standing here for another woman.
[1:59:10] And that woman is dying with cancer.
[1:59:14] And she tried to get to me in a meeting.
[1:59:18] And I was not able to be there because I
[1:59:21] was held up by a snowstorm.
[1:59:26] Come on, folks.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Where where where is this man that's
[1:59:30] human that's standing in front of us?
[1:59:32] Where is he?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Who knows those kind of things?
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Who did it once, twice, a hundred times,
[1:59:41] a thousand times, thousands of times?
[1:59:45] Why? And what he's doing is telling her
[1:59:48] exactly what's in her heart.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And the same prophet said, "When the
[1:59:53] seals were opened, you opened the seal
[1:59:56] to find out." And and then he said,
[1:59:58] "Your name was in there, but but you
[2:00:00] were not able to live your exact nature.
[2:00:05] You were not in your ought to be
[2:00:07] condition." As brother Tom preaches, you
[2:00:10] were not able to be in your ought to be
[2:00:12] condition. But when the seals were
[2:00:15] opened and opening the seals, it was the
[2:00:18] bridegroom himself says, "This is what I
[2:00:21] see about you. This is the way you were
[2:00:23] intended to be." And furthermore,
[2:00:26] believe me, because I have never told a
[2:00:28] lie in my life. This is the way you will
[2:00:31] be.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; THIS IS YOUR OUGHT TO BE CONDITION. THIS
[2:00:35] IS YOUR TRUE NATURE.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S BRIDE. YOU'RE
[2:00:40] MY BRIDE. AND I'M TELLING YOU, AND
[2:00:44] HERE'S THE VESSEL THAT I USE TO TELL YOU
[2:00:46] THAT. AND HE'S NEVER FAILED.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT YOURSELF. YOU
[2:00:51] CAN HEAR IT YOURSELF. IT IS TRUE, TRUE,
[2:00:54] TRUE, TRUE. THEN THIS PROMISE IS TRUE.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:01] And if science at this time has come to
[2:01:04] the place where a man who's completely
[2:01:07] mute and cannot speak can simply intend
[2:01:14] intend something. He wants something. He
[2:01:18] needs something or he intends something
[2:01:21] and a mechanism will speak his intention
[2:01:25] of what it is he needs.
[2:01:28] And they're looking upon it as a great
[2:01:30] discovery which it would be for
[2:01:32] paralyzed people or people with lugaric
[2:01:35] disease or whatever more.
[2:01:38] But now here HERE ARE YOUR SAME
[2:01:41] MESSENGERS SAYING THEY WILL DISCOVERED
[2:01:43] HE SAID THEY ARE THEY ARE uh scientists
[2:01:47] they are achievements making
[2:01:49] achievements in this world. But he and
[2:01:52] he said another place in the countdown
[2:01:54] HE SAID THIS IS A WARNING. ARE YOU
[2:01:56] TAKING THE WARNING? THERE'S A WARNING
[2:01:58] THAT SOMETHING SPIRITUAL IS TO FOLLOW.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, what your
[2:02:09] mind, what your thoughts and the signals
[2:02:13] that's coming from your brain at this
[2:02:15] moment, we have one THAT'S A CONTROL
[2:02:18] CENTER. WE HAVE THE ALMIGHTY God
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; that HAD AS A HAS A CERTAIN INTENTION
[2:02:25] FOR THIS PEOPLE
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; AND FOR YOU SITTING HERE. I'VE BEEN SENT
[2:02:29] THIS MORNING TO TELL YOU GOD HAS AN
[2:02:33] INTENT FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL LIFE AND ALL
[2:02:36] YOU NEED TO DO IS AGREE WITH IT.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SAY YAY AND AMEN.
[2:02:42] I BELIEVE IT. AND THEN IT SHALL COME TO
[2:02:44] PASS. AMEN.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; And if YOU TAKE IT CASUALLY, IT WON'T
[2:02:51] HAPPEN.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE SAYS TO BELIEVE WITH
[2:02:54] ALL YOUR HEART,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; IF YOU BELIEVE IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
[2:02:58] IN YOU,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; but if you have fear AND YOU HOLD BACK,
[2:03:03] IT WON'T HAPPEN.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY SO MANY OF US ARE ROBBED
[2:03:07] SO MUCH OF THE TIME, IT WON'T HAPPEN.
[2:03:11] AND WHEN THE ENEMY COMES AROUND AND HE'S
[2:03:13] TRYING TO HOLD YOU UP, HE'S TRYING TO
[2:03:16] KEEP YOU FROM BELIEVING WITH ALL YOUR
[2:03:18] HEART. SO HE HE HE has no problem. WHEN
[2:03:22] JESUS SAID, "WHO DO MEN SAY I AM? Who do
[2:03:26] we say this is?" And that's why brother
[2:03:28] Brandham GOT UP AND PREACHED. WHO DO YOU
[2:03:30] SAY THIS IS? YEAH.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Well, by my life,
[2:03:40] the disciples said, "Oh, some of you
[2:03:41] believe some some of us some of the
[2:03:44] people believe you're Isaiah
[2:03:46] or Elijah even."
[2:03:49] He didn't say, "Oh,
[2:03:51] that's wonderful. They've come a long
[2:03:52] way." No, he said, "But who do you say I
[2:03:55] am?" Right.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Said to the woman at the well,
[2:04:01] she said, "Oh, if I were a prophet,"
[2:04:05] he could have responded that that was a
[2:04:08] rare compliment. That's very nice that
[2:04:10] you say that. No, but she says, "BUT I
[2:04:14] KNOW WHEN I know when the Christ comes,
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; HE WILL TELL US WHEN THE MESSIAH COMES,
[2:04:20] he'll tell us all things."
[2:04:22] And he DIDN'T HAVE TO PREACH HER SERMON
[2:04:24] LIKE YOU'VE HEARD SO MANY TIMES. IT
[2:04:26] SAID, "I THAT SPEAK UNTO THEE AM HE."
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; AND SHE BELIEVED IT.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; AND THE BRAIN SIGNALS CONNECTED. AND SHE
[2:04:36] DROPPED THE WATER BUCKET. AND THE BRAIN
[2:04:39] SIGNALS TOLD HER HER FEET TO RUN. AND
[2:04:42] THE MUSCLES WERE ACTIVATED. AND SHE RAN
[2:04:45] INTO THE CITY. AND THE BRAIN SIGNAL
[2:04:47] SAID, "SPEAK." AND SHE OPENED HER MOUTH
[2:04:49] AND SPOKE. SAYS, "COME SEE A MAN
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; THAT TOLD ME ALL THAT EVER I DID.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; IS NOT THIS THE CHRIST?"
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; I'm saying TO YOU AS BELIEVERS, WHAT
[2:05:02] HAVE YOU RECEIVED? WHAT IS IT YOU'VE
[2:05:04] RECEIVED IN THIS HOUR?
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; I wish I had THE YOUTH THAT SOME OF YOU
[2:05:12] YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE. I TELL YOU, I'D BE
[2:05:14] MAKING PLANS for the KINGDOM OF GOD, NOT
[2:05:18] FOR THIS WORLD THAT'S PASSING AWAY INTO
[2:05:21] CORRUPTION. I'D BE MAKING PLANS FOR the
[2:05:23] kingdom of God.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Now, you might remember this.
[2:05:41] Brother Brandham said,
[2:05:44] "That's my voice,
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; but that's not me speaking."
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his brain signals
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; producing the words.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; In fact, I've got several quotes here,
[2:06:02] says this microphone
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; is mute.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; There's no words in this microphone.
[2:06:09] This microphone CAN ONLY PICK UP
[2:06:11] SOMETHING I SAY THAT ORIGINATES IN MY
[2:06:14] BRAIN AND SENDS OUT A SIGNAL TO MY LIPS
[2:06:17] SPEAK AND THE MICROPHONE PICKS IT UP AND
[2:06:19] YOU HEAR IT.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT MAY NOT BE THE FULL INTENT
[2:06:22] BEHIND IT. And brother Brandon would say
[2:06:25] to people, "If I could, I'd heal you."
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; That was the signal from his brain. But
[2:06:33] then would come another brain, ANOTHER
[2:06:35] THOUGHT, ANOTHER SIGNAL. I CALL IT A
[2:06:38] FAITH SIGNAL.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Comes to a mute instrument. HE SAYS THE
[2:06:42] MICROPHONE IS MUTE AND I am a mute.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE A VOICE OF HIS OWN. HE
[2:06:50] DIDN'T HAVE A CAPABILITY OF HIS OWN. SO
[2:06:53] HE GOES INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND HE
[2:06:56] SEES OTHER THINGS HAPPENING AND AND AND
[2:06:59] HE'S A MUTE. AND WHEN HE COMES OUT OF
[2:07:01] IT, HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS SAID.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID. WHY? BECAUSE
[2:07:08] HE'S A MUTE. THIS MICROPHONE DOESN'T
[2:07:09] KNOW what I say.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO BE MUTE.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; WE ARE CALLED TO BE A WITNESS
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; AND HAVE THE WORD OF PROMISE SPEAK
[2:07:22] THROUGH US.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT ALL? NO, I DON'T
[2:07:26] UNDERSTAND IT ALL. BUT THIS IS WHAT HE
[2:07:28] TOLD ME TO SAY.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; HE TOLD ME TO CONFESS THIS.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IN
[2:07:36] MY HEART,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; MY BRAIN IS SAYING,
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; SPEAK THAT WORD.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Not be silent.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; SPEAK IT.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY IT.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; CONFESS THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; CONFESS WHAT YOU DON'T EVEN EXPECT.
[2:07:58] CONFESS THE PROMISE OF GOD.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:08:03] Are you getting it?
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want everyone in here to be
[2:08:15] aware that the things that I speak is
[2:08:18] not myself.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's not my voice." He said, "It's my
[2:08:22] voice, but not I'm not using it."
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; DON'T GO. DON'T LET YOUR BRAIN WAVES
[2:08:31] THINK, "OH, THAT'S FINE FOR HIM. THAT'S
[2:08:34] WAY BACK THERE." THAT SAME ONE WHO SPOKE
[2:08:37] THOSE WORDS SPEAKS TO US AND SAYS TO YOU
[2:08:41] AND I, "CONFESS IT."
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; HOW LONG DO I CONFESS IT? UNTIL YOU
[2:08:45] BELIEVE IT.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; CONFESS IT UNTIL IT'S THE MOST SURE
[2:08:49] THING IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; You young ladies, YOU NEED TO CONFESS
[2:08:54] WHY GOD SENT YOU HERE. HE DIDN'T SEND
[2:08:56] YOU HERE JUST to have long hair or wear
[2:08:59] a modest dress. That isn't it. HE
[2:09:01] DOESN'T DIDN'T SEND US YOUNG men and I
[2:09:05] say us young men. I'm only 18 coming on
[2:09:07] 21.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; He hasn't called us just to make a
[2:09:11] certain profession
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; and we go to a certain place etc. Do you
[2:09:18] know why you're here in Cloverdale by
[2:09:19] the way? BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS WORD.
[2:09:23] We believe it with all our heart and
[2:09:25] soul. We do not believe it as just a
[2:09:27] place to gather. THIS IS NOT JUST A
[2:09:29] PLACE TO HAVE A SOCIAL EVENT.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. In fact, as I can tell you,
[2:09:35] I woke up early in the morning. I see
[2:09:37] brother Terry and sister Shelley here.
[2:09:40] We didn't build the brothers didn't
[2:09:42] labor on this school just to give you a
[2:09:45] better building,
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; to give you a nicer place. It is that
[2:09:52] YOU MIGHT COME UNDER A CERTAIN
[2:09:53] ATMOSPHERE. WE WANT YOU TO RECEIVE
[2:09:56] SUPERNATURAL A SUPERNATURAL INSTRUCTION
[2:09:58] FROM HERE. WE WANT IT TO PASS ON TO THE
[2:10:01] TEACHERS. WE WANT THE TEACHERS TO GO
[2:10:03] INTO THOSE ROOMS WITH THAT KIND OF AN
[2:10:05] ATMOSPHERE. Already had this included.
[2:10:08] WE AND I HAVE SUCH confidence in the
[2:10:11] brothers and sisters that are part of
[2:10:13] the school system. But we don't go over
[2:10:15] there TO JUST BE PART OF EDUCATIONAL
[2:10:17] SYSTEM. The supernatural and the
[2:10:19] spiritual guidance comes HERE OVER THE
[2:10:21] PULPIT BY THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Does this congregation believe that?
[2:10:27] THAT'S WHAT MY BRAIN SIGNALS ARE
[2:10:28] ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED OF. So we can see
[2:10:31] our young people and children grow up in
[2:10:34] the admonition and the and the purpose
[2:10:36] of God in in instilled in their lives.
[2:10:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'M GOING TO
[2:10:42] CONFESS THAT BECAUSE I believe it.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We labored there for that purpose.
[2:10:48] And you parents that are sending
[2:10:49] children there, let me tell you
[2:10:51] something, friends, that's the MOST
[2:10:53] GLORIOUS THING. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF
[2:10:54] OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT SAME
[2:10:56] PLACE. NOT EVEN BELIEVERS OF THIS
[2:10:58] MESSAGE. THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT
[2:11:00] QUALITY AND THAT STANDARD of school and
[2:11:02] that standard of education. And you
[2:11:04] never want to you never want to forget
[2:11:06] that people ought to LOVE PRODUCED THIS.
[2:11:09] PEOPLE OUT OF LOVE PAID and gave years
[2:11:12] and time of their energy and strength.
[2:11:15] And brother Kim Ding Walter, no one else
[2:11:17] told me TO SAY THIS. GOD TOLD ME TO say
[2:11:19] it.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE JUST TO PUSH YOU THROUGH
[2:11:23] AN education up to from kindergarten to
[2:11:26] K from K to to grade 12. That's not the
[2:11:29] purpose of it. The purpose is TO GIVE
[2:11:31] YOU AN ATMOSPHERE. You don't have to
[2:11:33] hear cursing and damnation. You don't
[2:11:36] HAVE TO HEAR VILE STORIES. YOU DON'T
[2:11:38] HAVE TO HAVE DEMONPOSSESSED TEACHERS.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hey friends, I know what I'm talking
[2:11:47] about.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; I had grandkids in school where the
[2:11:50] teacher was so had such a a a naked legs
[2:11:53] and and sit up on the table and show her
[2:11:56] undergarments and have a fully fully
[2:12:00] mature young man standing there looking
[2:12:03] at her. I said, "She's demonpossessed."
[2:12:06] Soon as I heard it, I SAID, "SHE'S
[2:12:07] DEMONPOSSESSED. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE
[2:12:09] JUST BULL for the gospel. WE'RE HERE TO
[2:12:12] BE BOLD AGAINST THE AGAINST unbelief as
[2:12:14] well."
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; And now, let me tell you, let me tell
[2:12:18] you the rest that's on my heart.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Faith is brother Brown talks about
[2:12:23] mental faith and the state of the mind.
[2:12:26] And the Bible tells us,
[2:12:29] "Let this mind be in you
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; which WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS."
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT BROTHER ED SAYING THAT.
[2:12:38] THAT'S A COMMANDMENT OF THE APOSTLE
[2:12:41] PAUL. LET THIS MIND BE in you.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Though he was equal with God,
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; he made himself of no reputation.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[2:12:55] things are lovely, whatsoever things are
[2:12:57] of good report, and what and A FEW OTHER
[2:12:59] THINGS, THINK ON THESE THINGS.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Your mind, let your mind go into action.
[2:13:05] I want your lips to speak. Think on
[2:13:08] these things.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Will you say that with me?
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Think on these things.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's three classes of people.
[2:13:22] I've got I got pages. I'm not I'm going
[2:13:25] to close very quickly, but there's three
[2:13:27] classes of people. What are they?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Let me hear it.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; All it is is three classes of people
[2:13:39] that think differently.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; It's all it is.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Some are going to say, "I don't believe
[2:13:48] that.
[2:13:51] One man says to brother Bradom, he says,
[2:13:53] "I don't care how many people you raised
[2:13:54] from the dead, whatever more, I still
[2:13:56] wouldn't believe it." He said, 'Of
[2:13:57] course not because you are an
[2:13:59] unbeliever.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be persuaded one way or
[2:14:04] another.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; But there's such a thing as you could
[2:14:07] sit here this morning
[2:14:09] and and and I'll tell you what happened
[2:14:11] to me in the last few days. My whole
[2:14:14] mind I just began to think of all these
[2:14:17] things. Brother Brandham said, Brother
[2:14:19] Brandham is standing there and he's
[2:14:20] starting to speak and he says, "Don't
[2:14:23] think that
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; even says to some, I could I could
[2:14:27] identify you."
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; What was HE PICKING UP?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; GOD IN THE MAN
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; picking up THE BRAIN SIGNALS. IF GOD
[2:14:36] WOULD ALLOW A MAN TO PICK THAT UP, THEN
[2:14:39] I AM HERE TO TELL YOU, ALMIGHTY GOD HAS
[2:14:42] PICKED UP OUR THOUGHTS.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE LIKE AN OPEN BOOK BEFORE HIM.
[2:14:46] AND HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE HERE.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS PRECISELY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU THINK THE RIGHT THING AND
[2:14:54] BELIEVE THE RIGHT THING AND CONFESS THE
[2:14:56] RIGHT THING, YOU SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT
[2:14:58] THING.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; We shall identify the the season of
[2:15:09] redemption that we're in.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN A SEASON WHERE WE'RE NOT
[2:15:13] CHURCHGOERS.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT people that go to Cloverdale
[2:15:16] Bible way. We're not just people who say
[2:15:18] we believe the message or we're in the
[2:15:19] message. We're a group of people that
[2:15:21] have taken that upon ourselves. When you
[2:15:24] READ THAT WORD, THAT IS ME.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WANT YOU YOUNG PEOPLE TO
[2:15:29] START CONFESSING STUFF YOU'VE NEVER
[2:15:30] CONFESSED BEFORE. As you read the
[2:15:33] message and you're in the message and
[2:15:34] something strikes YOUR HEART, YOU SAY IT
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY, "GOD, YOUR MOUTHPIECE SAID
[2:15:40] THAT."
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOUR MOUTHPIECE SPOKE IT
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; AND IT MUST be
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; That's why we talk about that's why we
[2:15:54] talk about especially you may think I
[2:15:56] talk too much about the change of the
[2:15:58] body. You can have this world. I'll take
[2:16:01] the next one.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Or you you don't want to stay here, do
[2:16:10] you? This isn't getting any better. It's
[2:16:12] getting worse. And then my Bible says
[2:16:14] it'll wax worse and worse. And I believe
[2:16:17] it and I'm confessing it.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; But I THIS WORLD IS NOT MY HOME.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's not your home.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; You brothers and sisters that have
[2:16:26] struggled AND HAVE STRUGGLES, PUT IT
[2:16:28] BEHIND YOU. THIS WORLD IS NOT YOUR HOME.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; AND LET THE BRAIN WAVE SIGNAL START
[2:16:36] DECLARING HEAVEN IS MY HOME.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; OH FATHER
[2:16:42] IN HEAVEN,
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; HALLOWED BE THY NAME,
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; thy kingdom come, thy will BE DONE ON
[2:16:49] EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. Give us this
[2:16:52] day our daily bread. And forgive us our
[2:16:55] trespasses. Forgive us all of our
[2:16:58] trespasses as we forgive those who
[2:17:00] trespass against us. And lead us not
[2:17:03] into temptation, but deliver US FROM
[2:17:06] EVIL. FOR THINE is the kingdom. Thine is
[2:17:09] the glory. Thine is THE POWER FOREVER
[2:17:13] AND ever and ever. Amen. And the people
[2:17:16] said, "Amen."
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:30] Amen.
[2:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:45] when you have someone
[2:17:48] who said, "I'm a mute,
[2:17:50] but he stands there and tells people
[2:17:52] what they think."
[2:17:56] I believe on that ministry.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; And if he says this is the way
[2:18:02] conditions are going to be,
[2:18:05] that's the way they will be.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thine is the kingdom
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; the power and the glory
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; forever and ever. Hallelujah. God bless
[2:18:19] brother Wulman.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; He got the crossover yesterday, but
[2:18:23] we're still here fighting the battle.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; And we'll say to brother Wman and all
[2:18:28] others. We'll say to brother Lonnie, I'm
[2:18:30] happy Brother Tim Dodd here on the
[2:18:33] platform. has been a week up in up in
[2:18:36] Grand Prairie with the people, but
[2:18:38] someone who's staying close in contact
[2:18:40] and has had much to do with India. I
[2:18:43] want to say to the people in India and
[2:18:45] to the bride of Jesus Christ, we're not
[2:18:48] letting go.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; We're not slowing down.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'LL PRESS THE BATTLES OF
[2:18:54] THE VERY GATES OF HELL.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. ARE YOU WITH ME?
[2:19:00] HALLELUJAH. WHO'S ON THE LORD'S SIDE?
[2:19:03] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. LET'S STAND TO our
[2:19:07] feet. We're on the Lord's side.
[2:19:11] Glory to God.
[2:19:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:18] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:19:25] [applause]
[2:19:26] Thank you for your time and thank you
[2:19:28] for your attention. And I pray that it
[2:19:30] will have the same effect on you that
[2:19:32] it's had on me. Oh my, the Bible has
[2:19:36] just exploded to me. The message when
[2:19:40] you read it, think of this message. When
[2:19:42] you read a line and you read a
[2:19:44] paragraph, I want you to ask yourself,
[2:19:46] what is my brain cell signal? What what
[2:19:49] signal is it sending? Now,
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; I know you read something and say, oh,
[2:19:54] that was kind of hard. Or, oh, that kind
[2:19:57] of convicts me. You say thy will be done
[2:20:00] oh Lord. Hallelujah. My brain is sending
[2:20:02] out signals. My and let the mental
[2:20:06] faith, intellectual faith come down to
[2:20:08] be a spiritual faith. Hallelujah. And
[2:20:11] your body will will respond to it.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:20:17] we just feel as though we've emptied out
[2:20:20] all that we should at this time. I pray,
[2:20:24] oh God, that people will ponder this so
[2:20:26] deeply
[2:20:27] that it'll be a life-changing experience
[2:20:30] for many.
[2:20:32] Oh God, let them not think this is just
[2:20:34] another message or another sermon. And I
[2:20:37] pray you'll just prepare the people,
[2:20:38] Lord, for what you will speak tonight
[2:20:41] and what you have laid on brother Tom's
[2:20:43] heart. Oh God, as brother John and
[2:20:46] brother Kyle will be ministering there
[2:20:49] in Lima, I pray, Father, you will come
[2:20:52] upon the people and endure them with
[2:20:55] power
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; from on high that is not from this
[2:20:58] world. Lord, I pray that you will
[2:21:00] anoint, oh God, our principal, brother
[2:21:04] Tat and his wife, oh God, Sister Shel,
[2:21:08] as she labors with him and everyone who
[2:21:11] stands at their post of duty within the
[2:21:15] classrooms. May they know they stand
[2:21:18] amongst those that are redeemed
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; by the blood of Jesus Christ. And Lord,
[2:21:23] why they have while as teachers they
[2:21:25] have certain intentions and objectives
[2:21:28] for their children and young people, I
[2:21:31] pray they will never never be
[2:21:33] unconscious to the fact that you have an
[2:21:35] intention. Hallelujah. You intend to put
[2:21:38] these young people around the marriage
[2:21:41] supper of the lamb. You intend to take
[2:21:44] them and gather your family to them,
[2:21:46] Lord. And I pray all that are here, all
[2:21:49] that are to here now. And some may be in
[2:21:52] need of prayer and they're saying in
[2:21:54] their heart, "Oh, brother Biscll,
[2:21:58] remember to pray for me." I want to ask
[2:22:00] while our heads are bowed, while our
[2:22:02] eyes are closed. Is there some here that
[2:22:05] want to h have be remembered in prayer
[2:22:07] at this time? While we're praying and
[2:22:09] while this anointing is upon the people,
[2:22:12] you want to be remembered in prayer. You
[2:22:15] don't know him the way you'd like to
[2:22:16] know him the way that you should know
[2:22:18] him. Tell change your thoughts and
[2:22:22] change your direction. Father, as hands
[2:22:26] have been lifted and how your messenger
[2:22:28] has said there's something in the heart,
[2:22:30] oh God. And we think of the we think of
[2:22:33] the words, oh God, that tells us of the
[2:22:36] scripture that as a man thinkketh in his
[2:22:39] heart, so is he. Oh God, the thoughts
[2:22:43] that come and arise from the heart, the
[2:22:45] hunger and the thirst, AND YOU SAID,
[2:22:48] "COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT HUNGER AND
[2:22:50] THIRST, and I will give you rest."
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; I pray, oh God, for everyone that has
[2:22:56] got their hands raised up, and their
[2:22:58] mind is registering certain things.
[2:23:00] Their mind already told the muscles in
[2:23:03] their arms to lift them up against
[2:23:05] gravity and raise them up to heaven from
[2:23:09] whence we have come and from to whence
[2:23:11] we will go. I pray oh God that you will
[2:23:13] take every individual
[2:23:16] every individual request and you will
[2:23:18] decipher it. You'll send an assurance to
[2:23:21] their heart that you have heard and you
[2:23:24] shall surely answer. and let them also
[2:23:26] have a hope and an anticipation that
[2:23:29] this shall surely come to pass. Oh God,
[2:23:32] let every desire raise before you. Let
[2:23:34] the people of the Lord say so.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; So let it be
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. It has been
[2:23:47] spoken
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. So let it
[2:23:51] be fulfilled.
[2:23:53] We thank you Lord.
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Honor brother Ryan, are you here? You
[2:24:03] can help me. This world is not my home.
[2:24:07] I'm just a passing through. My treasures
[2:24:10] are laid up somewhere beyond the blue.
[2:24:13] We don't know just where. All right,
[2:24:15] let's
[2:24:17] And remember also when you're going and
[2:24:19] [music] party worship to someone who's
[2:24:21] in need, we want to bless Sister Clara
[2:24:24] with a an offering whenever you're able
[2:24:28] be fine. We've never begged. We just
[2:24:30] [music] ask God to bless it. Lord, bless
[2:24:33] the giving of the people. We thank them
[2:24:36] for their tithes and offerings already
[2:24:38] this morning.
[2:24:40] as [music] they give and some deposit
[2:24:42] their envelopes in the box. We thank you
[2:24:45] for them, Lord. How they support the
[2:24:47] work of God. And we just want to
[2:24:50] tirelessly give ourselves [music] to
[2:24:52] this gospel. Hallelujah.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you feel like rejoicing?
[2:25:08] This world is not my home.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; This world is not my [music] home. I
[2:25:14] just
[2:25:18] started
[2:25:20] [music] away on the moon. The angel
[2:25:26] [music] open
[2:25:31] in this world.
[2:25:33] [music]
[2:25:34] Lord,
[2:25:37] I am
[2:25:41] [music]
[2:25:44] what I do. the angel
[2:25:49] [music] open door and I can't walk in
[2:25:54] this world anymore
[2:25:58] [music]
[2:26:00] and that's the thing I know

[2:26:47] [music]
[2:26:48] see every
[2:26:51] shout

[2:26:59] and I can feel that [music]
[2:27:08] All right. I want to take that. Want to
[2:27:10] take that verse again. [music] Just over
[2:27:12] in the glory land. Not just over in the
[2:27:14] glory land. How about right here?
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham, he didn't stop

[2:27:24] I don't feel like I own a [music] I
[2:27:26] don't feel like I own a foot of this

[2:27:33] there and my nephews down there [music]
[2:27:35] and oh my what a mess. No, he didn't say

[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; If you can't say anything else, just
[2:27:59] say, "I'm glad Brother Ed's happy."
[2:28:01] [music]
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; In the hour [music] of trial,
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; what I'm speaking is exactly what'll
[2:28:10] hold you.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; In the hour of trial, when you need
[2:28:12] healing, that'll give you healing.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.

[2:28:29] said he confirmed his word with signs
[2:28:32] following. So now you're the one to
[2:28:34] receive all the benefit, the full
[2:28:36] benefit of it. [music]
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:40] Glory to God.
[2:28:44] Now, when [music] we sing this verse
[2:28:45] again, you just turn around and shake
[2:28:47] hands. If you would, if you care to
[2:28:51] greet somebody with a real Christian
[2:28:53] handshake, smile on your face, and
[2:28:56] [music] of God bless you. Let them know
[2:28:58] you receive something that you believe
[2:29:00] it. Amen.
[2:29:03] &gt;&gt; Just over in the glory land. [music]
[2:29:09] Our saints on every land are shouting
[2:29:13] your [music] glory.
[2:29:15] The songs of sweetest praise. Bring back
[2:29:18] the [music] heaven. And I can't feel my
[2:29:22] home in this [music] world anymore.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; my home
[2:29:39] [music]
[2:29:42] and I can't feel
[2:29:46] this world anymore. [music]
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; And I can't
[2:30:07] [music]
[2:30:13] thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Brother
[2:30:16] Mike Gier [music] going to ask you to
[2:30:18] come and pray a blessing upon the
[2:30:20] people. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; Let [music] those brain wave signals.
[2:30:25] GOD, BLESS HIS people in the name of
[2:30:27] Jesus Christ. [music]
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know you believe it.
[2:30:34] [music]
[2:30:36] Glory.
[2:30:45] What an incredible mind of God.
[2:30:50] You know, I thought,
[2:30:52] why would he ask me up to pray? But I
[2:30:55] had to say something. And it was
[2:30:58] I read an article on
[2:31:01] ESPN News or whatever it is, the same
[2:31:04] article brother Ed read,
[2:31:08] and it affected me. I just said, I
[2:31:10] thought of Brother Dods. I thought of
[2:31:13] sister Deborah that laid in a coma for
[2:31:15] all those years and no communication or
[2:31:18] very little communication.
[2:31:21] And I took it all to the natural. I took
[2:31:24] it all to my, you know, this is really
[2:31:27] something. They've tapped into God's
[2:31:29] laboratory
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; and they're able to communicate through
[2:31:33] a computer [music] the thought of a man.
[2:31:39] But it takes the mind of God to put that
[2:31:41] service together.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Takes the mind of God to be able to
[2:31:45] speak that kind of word that would open
[2:31:48] it up in such a way that it's not man's
[2:31:50] thinking. I was thinking natural. I did
[2:31:53] not tap into that spiritual to be able
[2:31:56] to connect it with the word that we hear
[2:31:58] every day. I say God help me to be more
[2:32:03] and more tapped in that that I would be
[2:32:06] surrendered in such a way that those
[2:32:08] brain waves of God would come through
[2:32:10] these lips through this thought through
[2:32:12] through me not not my thinking not
[2:32:16] natural not the natural man I'm tired of
[2:32:19] this man God help us let us pray
[2:32:24] dear heavenly father oh God
[2:32:27] we thank you for the mind of Jesus Jesus
[2:32:29] Christ.
[2:32:31] Not the mind of a man. Lord God, who
[2:32:34] could put this together, Lord, [music]
[2:32:36] you are so mighty in battle. Oh God,
[2:32:40] greatest battle ever fought in this
[2:32:42] mind. And you have conquered it, Lord,
[2:32:45] by the word of Jesus Christ. But a
[2:32:48] testimony of our lips, oh God. And we
[2:32:50] thank you, Father.
