[10:14] &gt;&gt; Man, we've got a number of requests here

[10:18] come and uh open the service in a word
[10:21] of prayer.
[10:24] to take these requests before the throne
[10:25] of grace.
[10:28] Brother Matthew Dertie has a request
[10:30] that we pray for his Iranian friend. He
[10:33] has come to Canada to start a business
[10:36] and the government wants him to go to
[10:38] New Brunswick but he wants to stay here
[10:39] in Vancouver and also he wants to know
[10:42] about the message and to become a
[10:44] Christian. So we want to remember him
[10:46] this morning that God would work out his
[10:48] perfect will in this man's life. Sister
[10:51] Amelia uh phoned to request prayer for
[10:53] her friend Emma. She is asking prayer
[10:56] for the Lord to keep her in a personal
[10:58] matter. She called from Italy that we
[11:00] and requested that we pray for her. Um
[11:04] Sister Katie Walner is sick at home. We
[11:08] just want to pray this morning that God
[11:09] would raise her up. And also there's a
[11:11] request that we remember Kim and Nicole
[11:14] Frey who are at home not well this
[11:16] morning. If you've got a need that you
[11:18] want to be remembered before the Lord
[11:20] this morning, you just lift it to him as
[11:22] we go to prayer. Amen. If you're
[11:24] listening in this morning on the
[11:25] internet or on the phone line, you just
[11:28] take your request before him and we'll
[11:30] join our hearts with yours this morning.
[11:32] Amen. Brother Murphy had come.
[11:40] Our precious Lord Jesus, we count as so
[11:43] privileged to come to you again Lord.

[17:53] Good morning. God bless you.
[18:00] Sometimes we go through a lot of pain,
[18:04] suffering, discouragement.
[18:08] [Music]
[18:11] And a lot of times we think we don't
[18:13] deserve it
[18:16] and we say, "Oh, woe is me."
[18:20] But this morning,
[18:23] if you'd allow yourself to be
[18:27] transported into another dimension
[18:30] where the inspiration came for the man
[18:33] that wrote these words,
[18:36] "Oh, what a savior."
[18:39] Not, "Oh, is me or woe is me,"
[18:44] but oh, what a savior. We're here this
[18:46] morning because of his grace, aren't we?
[18:50] So when the inspiration flowed
[18:53] in 1948,
[18:56] the same time that Israel was made a
[18:58] nation, these words were pinned. I trust
[19:01] they'll be a more than just a song with
[19:04] words, but an inspiration to you this
[19:07] morning.
[19:13] Once I was straying

[21:04] with calmness. Sweet
[21:08] and
[21:11] soaring
[21:16] came down from heaven
[21:22] and gave his life
[21:26] blood
[21:28] to make the vilest
[21:33] sinner.
[21:36] free.

[32:14] Amen.
[32:16] Is that your destination?
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that king
[32:22] &gt;&gt; of that city, he knows you by name.
[32:25] Amen. And he loves you. Let's sing it
[32:27] together. Jesus loves even me. We've got
[32:29] a baby dedication. Uh Jar and Joan, if
[32:32] you'd come at this time.
[32:36] I am so glad that our father in heaven
[32:42] tells of his love in the book he has
[32:46] given us. Wonderful things in the Bible
[32:51] I see. But this is the dearest that
[32:56] Jesus loves me. Oh, I am so glad that
[33:02] Jesus loves me. I know Jesus.
[33:06] [Music]
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:24] We have a lot of wonderful things that
[33:27] are occurring
[33:29] uh not only Sunday by Sunday but year by
[33:32] year. And today we have our brother
[33:37] Jeremy and sister Joanna Brryer
[33:40] uh Bergen.
[33:47] I said that uh the way all these young
[33:50] couples are
[33:52] getting together and getting married
[33:54] between the few names in the families,
[33:57] it'll be just like a colony anymore.
[34:00] We get the Walders and the Stalls and
[34:02] the Hoffers, you know, you've got a lot
[34:04] of people out there in Manitoba. Isn't
[34:06] that right? Wherever it is. And so
[34:11] we have brother Jeremy
[34:13] and Sister Joanna. They're bringing
[34:15] their daughter Lana Mariah
[34:18] to be uh dedicated to the Lord.
[34:22] And uh if you haven't heard, which I
[34:24] don't believe I've dedicated anybody by
[34:26] the name of Lana, that is uh it's uh not
[34:30] only the name of
[34:32] brother Jeremy's greatg grandmother's
[34:36] middle name and uh or her grandmother's
[34:40] name and the middle name of her sister,
[34:42] his sister Anna.
[34:44] Uh, but it is uh uh the name of the
[34:48] national flower of Sweden. And I
[34:51] actually looked it up and had a look at
[34:52] the flower. So I know what I was talking
[34:55] about and I found out that uh even the
[34:59] name is associated with a very famous
[35:02] botanist
[35:03] uh in Sweden who did a lot of study on
[35:06] these things and uh it's a kind of a
[35:09] just associated with one of their great
[35:12] trees as well. uh massive tree which
[35:15] they make musical instruments out of and
[35:18] uh um make rope out of the bark and it's
[35:22] a very very useful tree. But so but the
[35:26] child we're talking about today I have
[35:28] some things that I want to say to
[35:31] brother Jeremy and sister Joanna
[35:37] today. Uh we hear a lot about
[35:39] underprivileged children
[35:42] or less privileged children
[35:45] and we hear a good deal also about
[35:47] privileged children
[35:50] and the world has a they've they've got
[35:53] their
[35:55] assessment of what is underprivileged or
[35:58] less privileged
[36:00] or what a privileged child is.
[36:05] So the privileged children according to
[36:08] some of the things which I have gathered
[36:12] they get a good education.
[36:15] This was the assessment of a Jewish
[36:17] rabbi.
[36:19] They have access to decent health care
[36:23] and they live in secure homes
[36:26] and they enjoy good nutrition and have
[36:28] enough clothing. But even he determined
[36:31] that that wasn't sufficient.
[36:33] I say this child
[36:36] has been born a privileged child, not
[36:39] because of any of these things. I'm
[36:42] happy they have these things, but a lot
[36:44] of children have these things, but don't
[36:46] have a real mother and a father. They
[36:49] don't have grandparents. And I
[36:52] understand that this child has
[36:53] greatgrandparents here on both sides of
[36:57] the family, on the Bergen side and on
[36:59] the Briner side.
[37:02] So many children today don't have
[37:06] parents that give themselves freely and
[37:09] completely to their children.
[37:13] Raising a child is a long-term job.
[37:18] And it requires that parents would
[37:20] lovingly
[37:22] give themselves freely and completely to
[37:25] the child. And that child then is a
[37:28] privileged child even though they may
[37:30] not have all of these other things. It's
[37:32] wonderful if they do have them. Plus,
[37:35] but if I had to take a choice between
[37:37] one or the other, I'd say, "Give me
[37:39] godly parents.
[37:42] Give me parents that are devoted,
[37:44] committed, committed,
[37:47] dedicated themselves first to God, and
[37:50] then they that will dedicate their
[37:52] children to God. and whether they get
[37:54] along on meager fair, whether they don't
[37:57] have access to the best education in the
[37:59] world, and whether they don't travel,
[38:01] whether they're not able to plan and and
[38:04] maintain a uh, you know, a family name.
[38:07] All of those things really are quite
[38:09] secondary when it comes to spiritual
[38:12] things. And I think this congregation
[38:14] will agree. There's been many that are
[38:17] classed by the world as being privileged
[38:22] children, but they end up in the later
[38:25] in their lives as suffering,
[38:29] desperately suffering and needful and
[38:32] lacking in many areas of their lives.
[38:35] When I was speaking to the school and
[38:38] brother Randy Timberman had asked me to
[38:40] say a few words. It was while I was
[38:41] speaking brother Randy there and I spoke
[38:44] out of the scripture for they have sown
[38:47] to the wind and they shall reap the
[38:49] whirlwind
[38:51] it hath no stock the bud shall yield no
[38:54] meal.
[38:56] If so be it yield the stranger shall
[38:58] swallow it up. And I thought of that
[39:00] scripture in reference to young people.
[39:03] And while I was speaking it, I thought
[39:04] of this dedication.
[39:06] I thought this child
[39:09] as well as other children here are
[39:13] privileged children because they have
[39:16] parents that are going to protect them
[39:19] and keep them from sewing to the wind so
[39:22] that they shall not reap the whirlwind.
[39:25] And as I look out over the young people
[39:27] of today, you see them on the streets.
[39:30] You see them with such an aimless,
[39:32] haunted look in their eyes. And our
[39:34] brothers who are here, who are, you
[39:37] know, on the police force have told me
[39:39] that some of the most violent are the
[39:42] young ladies that are 15 years old at
[39:44] that age group. And I thought, what a
[39:46] tragedy. It isn't even that little
[39:48] girl's fault. They've been deprived. And
[39:52] here we have Lana
[39:55] Mariah
[39:57] being privileged to be in this
[39:59] atmosphere this morning. Even though
[40:02] although she knows nothing about it,
[40:03] she's privileged that she will be guided
[40:07] by a godly father and a godly mother so
[40:10] that she will not sew to the wind and by
[40:12] God's grace shall never reap the
[40:14] whirlwind. Hallelujah. And it's on that
[40:18] basis I want to dedicate her in the name
[40:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[40:28] Heavenly Father, it is with joy in my
[40:30] heart
[40:32] that I embrace and hold this child. And
[40:34] as you touched them, laid your hand upon
[40:38] them, you knew more about them than even
[40:41] the parents did. And today you knew more
[40:44] about this child. You gave it before it
[40:47] was formed in the womb. You knew it, oh
[40:50] God. And you gave the life, Father, that
[40:53] should now be expressed. And I believe
[40:56] that you have brought her forth, Lord,
[40:58] that she could express a part of the
[41:00] Lord Jesus Christ. I ask that you will
[41:04] cause Lana Mariah to be a blessing in
[41:07] the home. We thank you for what you've
[41:09] done just recently for her, Lord,
[41:11] touching her body and touching her
[41:13] system and giving her a peace, Lord,
[41:15] that she had not had. And Lord, I pray
[41:18] that you will receive our thanksgiving
[41:20] to you today. And as you have given her
[41:23] so graciously and so freely into the
[41:26] arms and the hearts of brother Jeremy
[41:28] and sister Joanna, I ask now Lord that
[41:31] you will see their hearts as they stand
[41:34] here before this crowd of witnesses
[41:37] saying we give her back to you Lord
[41:39] Jesus.
[41:41] Our arms and our hands will guide her
[41:44] and our arms will hold her and love her.
[41:47] But there are times when we won't be
[41:49] able to reach her. Then we ask Lord that
[41:51] you will hold her, that you will take
[41:54] her by the hand and that you will guide
[41:56] her. I pray that you'll bless her father
[41:58] and mother, Lord, our brother Jeremy,
[42:00] sister Joanna, give them wisdom, give
[42:04] them leadership, and I pray above all
[42:06] things you'll give this child
[42:10] eternal life
[42:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:14] Guide her to those gates, Lord, that
[42:17] will open. And may this family be
[42:20] unbroken that day at the great supper
[42:23] table. I dedicate Leah Lana
[42:27] Mariah in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:30] Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you
[42:33] Joanna.
[42:36] God bless you. God bless you, brother
[42:38] Jeremy.
[42:51] Sister Marilyn, Sister Joanne, Sister
[42:53] Linda have a song for us just before we
[42:55] turn to the word. And as they come and
[42:57] prepare, let's sing. We place you in the
[43:00] highest place for you are the great high
[43:03] priest.
[43:07] We place you
[43:11] in the highest place.
[43:15] For you
[43:19] are the great high priest.
[43:23] We place you
[43:28] high above
[43:30] all.
[43:35] Oh yes,
[43:38] Lord and we come to you
[43:43] inship.
[43:45] [Music]
[43:53] We place you
[43:56] Lord in the highest place.
[44:01] For you
[44:04] are the great high priest.
[44:08] We place you
[44:12] high above.
[44:15] Oh,
[44:17] [Applause]
[44:20] what else
[44:23] can we come to
[44:27] and worship?
[44:30] [Music]
[44:54] [Music]
[45:09] Hey, Angels appeared unto shepherds,
[45:14] bearing the news of his birth.
[45:19] Glory to God in the highest.
[45:24] God had come down to the earth.
[45:29] Shepherds sought till they found him.
[45:34] And wise men brought treasure and my
[45:39] surely one spoke to the others.
[45:43] We will never be what we once were.

[46:29] [Music]
[46:43] Oh, how my heart well remembers
[46:48] the first time I heard the sweet news
[46:52] of this Jesus, born of a virgin,
[46:58] a carpenter, king of the Jews.
[47:03] Though I was not with the shepherds,
[47:07] and had less to bring than wise men,
[47:12] I too have been changed since I met him.
[47:18] I am not what I have been.
[47:22] Glory to God. Glory to God in the
[47:27] highest.
[47:29] [Music]
[47:32] Peace and good will. Peace and good will
[47:36] be to men.

[47:42] Immanuel
[47:45] Emmanuel has forgiven
[47:49] my sin.
[47:52] Glory to God.

[48:26] Immanuel say
[48:29] [Music]
[48:36] oh

[48:39] [Music]
[48:47] has forgiven
[48:50] my sin.
[48:52] Glory to God. I am not what I have been.
[49:02] Glory to God.
[49:05] I am not what I have
[49:11] been.
[49:12] [Music]
[49:20] [Applause]
[49:32] This is our only service today.
[49:35] So, it isn't that we're going to drag it
[49:39] out, but we're not going to hurry
[49:41] either.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Brother and Sister Swanson, so nice to
[49:45] see you and to hear you sing.
[49:48] Uh it's always such a joy. God bless
[49:53] you. Nice that we we have a little bit
[49:56] of temptation here for you now to you
[49:58] know to be with us sometime.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:04] Uh this Thursday
[50:07] we're going to be having a memorial
[50:08] service.
[50:10] For those of you that have not heard,
[50:12] our brother Mark Kemper passed away
[50:16] on Saturday.
[50:19] Uh believe it was, was it Saturday?
[50:22] Friday or Saturday? I'm sorry. I just
[50:25] lost track of my days.
[50:29] The uh service will be here in the
[50:32] church
[50:34] Thursday
[50:35] at 11:00 a.m.
[50:38] And so we would like as many of you as
[50:43] are able. We know that it's a morning, a
[50:46] work day for perhaps many, but it would
[50:49] be very nice for you to be here in
[50:52] support of our brother Lyall, sister
[50:55] Hannie, their family, brother Roger,
[50:59] sister Gail, and their family. And I was
[51:02] able to visit Mark a couple of times in
[51:06] the hospital, and he requested that we
[51:10] would have a service for him here in the
[51:13] church. And uh
[51:17] so we will be doing so
[51:21] and we're
[51:23] we're thankful to God for
[51:26] the promise that he has left us that uh
[51:30] we don't look upon death and passing as
[51:34] uh some final conclusion to things. It's
[51:39] a crossing over. And I certainly
[51:43] wouldn't want to call him back even if
[51:46] we had the opportunity.
[51:49] And I'll never forget
[51:51] I'll just never forget when my father
[51:54] crossed over.
[51:56] Uh a very youthful man.
[52:01] Not only my father but my sister Anne's
[52:04] father.
[52:05] Sharon, my sister who's not here.
[52:10] and he was 64,
[52:12] six years younger than myself at this
[52:14] time and hardly a gray hair in his head.
[52:19] And when he crossed over and I called
[52:22] brother McGriff to let them know and he
[52:26] just
[52:28] gave a little exclamation
[52:31] and said, "Praise God."
[52:34] He said, 'Well,
[52:36] you wouldn't want to call him back even
[52:38] if you could.' And I never forgot those
[52:41] words. I said, 'Now, that's right. I
[52:45] wouldn't want to call him back even if I
[52:46] could. For me, selfishly, we would like
[52:50] to have, but for him, it was far better
[52:55] where he was.
[52:57] So, if you'll remember that Thursday,
[52:59] please at uh 11:00 a.m.
[53:05] Now, for those of you that saw last
[53:07] Sunday,
[53:09] we were in Ghana,
[53:12] and I guess you saw a little bit of it.
[53:14] Uh we have just a few minutes of uh clip
[53:19] that brother Dier has taken on uh video.
[53:24] And uh would you like to take just a few
[53:26] minutes? It's it's four or five minutes
[53:28] at the very most. And this will show you
[53:31] now what the other people didn't show
[53:34] you. This is more the congregation and
[53:38] and so on. I'll just give you a little
[53:40] little taste of last Sunday and uh then
[53:43] you'll know why I'm so happy to be here
[53:46] this morning. Also,
[53:49] God bless you while you view this.
[54:15] Greetings from
[54:17] Columbia.
[54:55] Powerful.
[55:01] We have
[55:23] Hallelujah.
[55:52] Hallelujah.
[55:54] Hallelujah.
[56:06] Nobody.
[58:49] Hallelujah.
[58:55] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[58:59] Got to feel at home here.
[59:03] A lot of that what you see happening was
[59:05] happening while I was preaching. That
[59:07] brother that's all up by himself there
[59:09] sitting at the front. I was in the
[59:11] middle of the message. He just ran up
[59:14] and threw himself down. And some of the
[59:16] other people, you know, dancing around
[59:18] and they were just rejoicing. They get
[59:20] excited about the word.
[59:22] Hallelujah.
[59:24] I I think I we call that riboth as well.
[59:27] There was room for everybody. That's
[59:29] what it says in the scripture. They call
[59:30] it riaboth. There's room for everybody.
[59:32] That's what brother doa has called the
[59:35] new shakina translation or shakina
[59:37] publication. Riaboth, which means
[59:40] there's room for us all.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And he was saying that in reference to
[59:44] getting the message out. There's room
[59:46] for us all. But they were dancing down
[59:48] there. Brother did Diddy. I figured
[59:49] that's really both as well. There's room
[59:51] for everybody. I just couldn't
[59:53] understand how they're one right behind
[59:55] the other and all their eyes is closed.
[59:57] They're going like this, you know, right
[59:58] behind the other. And how in the world
[1:00:00] they know they're not going to bump into
[1:00:01] the fellow, you know, if he stops. But
[1:00:03] everything just kept moving. And and
[1:00:06] then one one just got completely carried
[1:00:08] away. And I mean, he's he's taking up
[1:00:10] the space of half a dozen people. And
[1:00:12] they just make room for him. I mean, you
[1:00:14] know, they they seem to have special
[1:00:16] discernment to know this fellow needs
[1:00:18] more space. give him more room because
[1:00:20] he's going to do it a different way. And
[1:00:22] I I I just think it's wonderful.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; As individual as we are, that's how God
[1:00:27] made us. And we want to just be thankful
[1:00:30] and worship however God uh uh directs
[1:00:34] us. Amen. Well, that was last Sunday, so
[1:00:38] I mean, you know, have patience with me.
[1:00:41] It's a real It's a real jerk to go from
[1:00:44] one atmosphere to another.
[1:00:47] So, don't be too quiet. Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] Well, we're going to read some
[1:00:54] scripture.
[1:00:59] Thanks for the song, for the specials,
[1:01:02] for the choir, and I I enjoyed Matthew
[1:01:06] singing last night with Brother Jake,
[1:01:08] didn't you? My was just wonderful. I I
[1:01:11] want to hear uh I told him right away, I
[1:01:13] want to hear another one. Not next year.
[1:01:16] real quick. We need to hear one of those
[1:01:20] once a month as far as I'm concerned.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read
[1:01:28] out of uh second Peter
[1:01:31] the third chapter.
[1:01:37] And I certainly appreciate your prayers
[1:01:41] and your prayer support.
[1:01:45] And I know that on behalf of brother
[1:01:47] Tay, he asked me to give greetings to
[1:01:49] you. They were very appreciative of the
[1:01:53] reception that you gave him as their
[1:01:57] pastor. We I dedicated also a book uh
[1:02:01] that they have just done. They did I
[1:02:04] think the part three of the Daniel uh 70
[1:02:08] week series. and uh the church here we
[1:02:12] gave a 20 $2,500 US contribution towards
[1:02:16] the printing of those books
[1:02:19] and they were very very thankful. He
[1:02:20] said that's the first time that had ever
[1:02:22] happened to them where someone had had
[1:02:25] given towards uh their work. So, I was
[1:02:29] happy that we were able to do that.
[1:02:32] And uh I want you to know that we we
[1:02:36] want to be a giving church, not just
[1:02:38] financially, but giving of ourselves and
[1:02:41] and uh hospitable church. We want to be
[1:02:44] that way. I believe that's the way Jesus
[1:02:45] was and that's what he'd have us to be.
[1:02:48] Now in second Peter the 3 chapter we'll
[1:02:52] read and these verses in part are part
[1:02:56] of brother Brandham's text to future
[1:02:58] home
[1:02:59] starting at verse five.
[1:03:02] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:03:06] that by the word of God the heavens were
[1:03:08] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:03:11] water and in the water whereby the word
[1:03:17] that then was
[1:03:19] I'm sorry the world that then was being
[1:03:22] overflowed with water perished but the
[1:03:26] heavens and the earth which are now by
[1:03:28] the same word are kept in store reserved
[1:03:32] unto fire against the day of judgment
[1:03:36] and predition of ungodly men. But
[1:03:39] beloved, be not ignorant of this one
[1:03:42] thing, that one day is with the Lord as
[1:03:45] a thousand years, and a thousand years
[1:03:48] as one day. The Lord is not slack
[1:03:51] concerning his promise as some men count
[1:03:54] slackness, but is long-suffering to
[1:03:57] usward, not willing that any should
[1:03:59] perish, but that all should come to
[1:04:03] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[1:04:05] come as a thief in the night, in the
[1:04:08] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[1:04:10] great noise, and the elements shall melt
[1:04:13] with fervent heat, and the earth also,
[1:04:15] and the works that are therein shall be
[1:04:18] burned up. Seeing then that all these
[1:04:22] things shall be dissolved,
[1:04:25] what manner of persons ought ye to be
[1:04:29] ought you to be in all holy conversation
[1:04:32] and godliness, looking for and hastening
[1:04:35] unto the coming of the day of God,
[1:04:38] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[1:04:41] be dissolved, and the elements shall
[1:04:43] melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[1:04:46] according to his promise look for new
[1:04:49] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:04:53] righteousness.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow in prayer
[1:05:00] with reverence
[1:05:02] with sincerity
[1:05:04] and humility. Oh God, we come to you
[1:05:09] presenting ourselves Lord.
[1:05:13] just presenting ourselves as what we
[1:05:16] are. We can be nothing more than you
[1:05:19] allow us to be. We can say I am what I
[1:05:22] am by the grace of God. We are what you
[1:05:26] have allowed us to be. We could do
[1:05:29] nothing. We could not have even come to
[1:05:32] you or approached you had you not called
[1:05:35] us. So we thank you oh God for the call
[1:05:38] and that you have justified. You have
[1:05:41] cleansed and sanctified and you have
[1:05:44] sealed by the spirit of promise every
[1:05:48] elected son and daughter of God. We can
[1:05:51] say this morning we stand redeemed by
[1:05:54] the blood of the lamb. That precious
[1:05:57] blood that stained the earth and claimed
[1:06:00] it as your very own. And you will
[1:06:03] complete this process. Oh God, you are
[1:06:06] bringing the earth through the same
[1:06:08] process your prophet said that you are
[1:06:11] bringing each individual and cleansing
[1:06:13] us by fire by a baptism of fire that we
[1:06:18] might be a suitable dwelling place. Oh
[1:06:21] dwell in us richly we pray. Oh God dwell
[1:06:24] in us richly. Bless Lord not only those
[1:06:28] that have gathered here but those that
[1:06:29] are gathered with us heart to heart,
[1:06:32] attribute to attribute. Lord, those that
[1:06:34] far away in the invisible audience in
[1:06:37] whatever country, whatever place,
[1:06:39] whatever room, wherever they find
[1:06:41] themselves, Lord, I pray that you'll
[1:06:43] take your word this morning and cause it
[1:06:45] to be a blessing. Anoint the hearers,
[1:06:48] Lord. Anoint myself, oh God, for without
[1:06:52] you, we confess we are nothing and can
[1:06:55] do nothing. We have no ability. May the
[1:06:58] ability be that of God. We pray your
[1:07:02] blessing now as we approach your word in
[1:07:04] Jesus Christ's name. May you be
[1:07:07] glorified amongst us. Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:07:12] Keep your Bibles open if you would.
[1:07:16] I would just like you to notice
[1:07:19] uh some phrases here
[1:07:23] where we began to read in verse five.
[1:07:27] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:07:31] that. Please notice by the word of God
[1:07:36] the heavens whereof old and the earth
[1:07:39] standing out of the water and by the
[1:07:41] word of God this was taking place. And
[1:07:45] then uh verse six, verse 7, but the
[1:07:50] heavens and the earth which are now by
[1:07:53] the same word are kept in store.
[1:07:58] So it's it's it's the word of God that
[1:08:00] are is holding things back or bringing
[1:08:04] things on.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; And it's reserved under fire against the
[1:08:10] day of judgment and the predition of
[1:08:12] ungodly men. So, if you'll just notice,
[1:08:15] I wanted you to notice the position and
[1:08:18] the place of the word of God. Uh, I will
[1:08:22] be reaching out
[1:08:24] into some distance.
[1:08:28] Uh, I pray that God will give us really
[1:08:32] a divine inspiration and understanding.
[1:08:38] I'm thinking in terms of uh the
[1:08:41] beginning of this year and where we're
[1:08:44] at and our our calendar. Brother
[1:08:47] Brennham talks about the various
[1:08:49] calendars in uh Daniel 70 weeks
[1:08:55] and he refers to the astronomy calendar,
[1:08:58] the Julian calendar,
[1:09:01] the Roman calendar
[1:09:03] and the Christian or prophetic calendar.
[1:09:07] And he said that I'm not going to be
[1:09:10] reading it but because of the position
[1:09:14] of the earth it cannot none of those
[1:09:17] calendars only the prophetic calendar is
[1:09:19] correct. None of the other calendars are
[1:09:22] are are correct because the earth is in
[1:09:25] such a position and it's in that
[1:09:27] position he says uh
[1:09:30] back in the days of Job and so forth
[1:09:33] that they kept time by the stars.
[1:09:37] See, they kept time by the stars. And
[1:09:40] back before that time, he said the world
[1:09:42] stood upright. So, it was in a different
[1:09:45] position. The earth was in a a little
[1:09:47] different position. And then, and then
[1:09:51] in the sin of man, the overflow of the
[1:09:54] world and it tilted and the floods came.
[1:09:59] The actual earth tilted and the floods
[1:10:02] came. Therefore, we have the great ice
[1:10:05] age and the glaciers and so forth. And
[1:10:08] he speaks of that. He says, "We we know
[1:10:10] that the earth does not sit up straight.
[1:10:14] Does not sit up. It's it sets tilted.
[1:10:18] That shook it out from where the moon
[1:10:20] and the stars were they were looking at
[1:10:23] and misplaced them. uh or you could not
[1:10:27] keep time by it anymore because it's
[1:10:31] sitting lopsided.
[1:10:33] Uh then he goes on in another continues
[1:10:37] on just a little bit. Listen very
[1:10:38] closely. It's laying back in that
[1:10:41] condition
[1:10:43] and and that only shows that this is
[1:10:46] just a period of time.
[1:10:49] It's tilted. It's lopsided. that's in
[1:10:51] that position showing that this is only
[1:10:54] a period of time. And he asks, "Can't
[1:10:58] you see God
[1:11:01] doesn't have things out of cater?"
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; So this is only it's only out of
[1:11:08] lopsided as it is, off some degrees as
[1:11:11] it is, tilting back. He uses all of
[1:11:14] those phrase, but it's only that way for
[1:11:16] a time. He's just letting it run like
[1:11:18] that for a time. And I truly believe
[1:11:22] that I truly believe that that thing was
[1:11:25] done. And at this last days is when
[1:11:30] God's going to reveal these secrets to
[1:11:34] the church.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] He goes on, "And the spirit of wisdom
[1:11:39] comes into the church to make known to
[1:11:42] the church by the revelation of the Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost, bringing the church in and
[1:11:49] revealing what day that we're living
[1:11:52] in." Just the same as Gabriel came to
[1:11:55] Daniel, the Holy Spirit comes to the
[1:11:58] church in the last days to reveal these
[1:12:02] great deep secrets. And do you
[1:12:05] understand? Now he said, so there are
[1:12:07] are things that are dropped in. It may
[1:12:09] not be like some uh essay that you can
[1:12:13] just read through. God doesn't do it
[1:12:15] that way. If you read uh in the book of
[1:12:19] Acts and if you read Paul's writings,
[1:12:22] his epistles, he will reach back into
[1:12:25] Genesis and just take a phrase and then
[1:12:27] he'll be in Psalms and take one phrase
[1:12:30] out of one verse and then over in
[1:12:32] another chapter and another phrase out
[1:12:34] another verse and maybe out of Hosea and
[1:12:36] one phrase out of one verse. And he
[1:12:39] pieces and links all of those together
[1:12:41] and gives you a picture of what is
[1:12:43] happening at that time.
[1:12:46] And we have just such a prophet
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; in a Leodysian church age. Now I'm just
[1:12:53] put piecing some of these things
[1:12:55] together.
[1:12:57] In the seventh stage,
[1:13:00] uh, Brother Brand was talking about the
[1:13:02] last eclipse. There was a sign in the
[1:13:03] heaven. It was a total eclipse of the
[1:13:05] moon. In the last eclipse of the moon
[1:13:09] was a total eclipse.
[1:13:12] It waned to a total darkness in seven
[1:13:15] stages.
[1:13:16] In the seventh stage, the total darkness
[1:13:19] came. Now watch this. The total
[1:13:21] darkness, the it it waned
[1:13:24] and the eclipse of the moon. Moon being
[1:13:29] church, moon being a reflector of the
[1:13:32] sun
[1:13:34] and it's a woman. And it waned and its
[1:13:37] light went completely out. In the
[1:13:39] seventh stage, the total darkness came
[1:13:43] as the pope of Rome, Pope Paul V 6th
[1:13:48] went to Palestine to make a holy tour of
[1:13:52] Jerusalem. And Jerusalem, he said, is
[1:13:54] the oldest church. And God in the
[1:13:57] heavens testified that the light went
[1:14:01] completely out when this enemy of the
[1:14:05] church went for the first time in
[1:14:08] history to Jerusalem.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; God declared it in the heavens. The
[1:14:14] astronomers didn't pick it up.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; The nations of the earth didn't pick it
[1:14:18] up. United Nations never picked it up.
[1:14:21] But a prophet picked it up.
[1:14:25] And he said to make a holy tour of
[1:14:28] Jerusalem. He was the first pope to ever
[1:14:31] go to Jerusalem. And the pope was named
[1:14:34] Paul I 6th.
[1:14:37] Paul was the first messenger. And this
[1:14:40] man goes by that name. You understand
[1:14:43] these are not the pope's names. They
[1:14:46] take those names.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; He said notice it. the moon or the
[1:14:52] church went into total darkness said
[1:14:55] this is it. This is the end. The
[1:14:58] generation shall not pass away until all
[1:15:02] be fulfilled. Even so, Lord Jesus come
[1:15:05] quickly.
[1:15:07] Now, that visit by Pope Paul, the first
[1:15:12] pope to ever go to Jerusalem was was
[1:15:16] January of 1964.
[1:15:20] And now we've come our 40 years.
[1:15:24] We're at a generation.
[1:15:28] What does it mean? What is this
[1:15:30] generation?
[1:15:32] There's a few
[1:15:34] during that visit.
[1:15:37] And now this present Pope Pope Paul II
[1:15:42] has made his visit
[1:15:45] recently.
[1:15:48] and to assure
[1:15:50] the Jews that uh
[1:15:55] that there was some sensitivity within
[1:15:58] the Roman church concerning the things
[1:16:01] that had happened. And the main thing
[1:16:03] was that they have been uh
[1:16:07] have have placed the responsibility of
[1:16:10] the death of Jesus Christ upon the Jews
[1:16:12] and the Jews placed it upon the Romans
[1:16:15] and that is the way that that thing has
[1:16:17] been there for 2,000 years. And so there
[1:16:19] has to come a place of unity.
[1:16:22] Now when that first visit in 1964, one
[1:16:26] generation ago,
[1:16:29] this was the basis.
[1:16:31] During his short trip to Israel, it
[1:16:34] lasted only 11 days.
[1:16:37] Pope Paul V 6th never once called Israel
[1:16:41] by name,
[1:16:44] and went out of his way to avoid using
[1:16:47] the word Jews.
[1:16:50] In those days, the Vatican saw Israel as
[1:16:54] a non-country
[1:16:55] and its people as a non-nation.
[1:16:59] Pope Paul V 6th even used the occasion
[1:17:03] to praise his mentor Pope Pas I 12th
[1:17:08] defending Pope Pas I 12th's
[1:17:12] his silence total silence during the
[1:17:16] Holocaust.
[1:17:17] never raised up one word of defense on
[1:17:23] behalf of six million people being
[1:17:25] slaughtered.
[1:17:28] And the current visit, by contrast,
[1:17:32] this current visit of Pope Paul II will
[1:17:35] be seen by many as cementing the
[1:17:38] establishment
[1:17:39] 7 years ago of full diplomatic relations
[1:17:44] between the Vatican and Israel. And here
[1:17:47] a prophet to this generation said they
[1:17:50] will make a covenant
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; as the only preacher that I have ever
[1:17:55] heard or read that declared thus sayeth
[1:17:58] the Lord. The Vatican and the Jews will
[1:18:02] make a covenant. And the first prime
[1:18:04] minister was Goldier that went to the
[1:18:07] Vatican to commence those relationships
[1:18:11] some years ago. And now those things are
[1:18:14] are coming into fruition. Not only did
[1:18:18] this prophet say they would make this
[1:18:20] covenant, he said they will also break
[1:18:22] this covenant.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; If he is correct on this point and the
[1:18:30] next one and the next one and the next
[1:18:33] one, you better hear what he said about
[1:18:35] those things that haven't happened yet.
[1:18:39] And you might as well settle it this
[1:18:41] morning and be as certain, as certain as
[1:18:44] you're sitting here breathing God's
[1:18:46] fresh air,
[1:18:48] at least free air,
[1:18:51] that what he spoke is going to take
[1:18:53] place.
[1:18:56] The newspapers
[1:18:59] at during this first visit hailed the
[1:19:01] announcement of Pope Paul's visit as
[1:19:04] astonishing
[1:19:06] saying he clearly wished to go beyond
[1:19:08] the historical precedent.
[1:19:11] The pope they said was careful to stress
[1:19:15] that his pilgrimage was a purely
[1:19:19] religious act. absolutely had nothing to
[1:19:23] do with any kind of political or
[1:19:26] temporal considerations. But the visit
[1:19:29] now 40 years later of Pope Paul II was
[1:19:34] entirely different. It was for political
[1:19:37] reasons and it was for the unification
[1:19:41] of the brethren because this pope said
[1:19:44] he that he had dedicated he dedicated
[1:19:47] that 40 years ago to Christian unity
[1:19:50] especially especially between Catholics
[1:19:53] and the Greek Orthodox Church rather
[1:19:56] than the reconciliation of different
[1:19:58] religions. But 40 years later, because a
[1:20:02] prophet has declared that they will, he
[1:20:04] said, "It may sound strange, but they
[1:20:06] will take it all over."
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And 40 years later, it's agreed by the
[1:20:12] papers that you read and whatever
[1:20:15] newscasts you hear, it is openly
[1:20:18] declared that this pope has succeeded in
[1:20:21] bringing them all together.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that that hasn't been just
[1:20:25] predicted. It's been prophesied.
[1:20:28] And so, uh, we're living in it. And I
[1:20:31] say to you, young and old alike, where
[1:20:34] are we at?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Does 40 years mean anything?
[1:20:40] And he dedicated to Christian unity
[1:20:44] just especially to the Catholics and the
[1:20:46] Greek Orthodox.
[1:20:48] Two years had elapsed since the second
[1:20:51] Vatican Council convened by Pope John
[1:20:54] the 23rd in 1962.
[1:20:58] which set out to dismantle they started
[1:21:02] in 1962 to dismantle the charge that
[1:21:06] Jews were responsible for killing Jesus.
[1:21:09] So that was 1962 it came into the mind
[1:21:12] of the Vatican. We've got to set in
[1:21:14] motion uh a a direction here so that the
[1:21:18] that the we can dismantle this belief in
[1:21:22] the world that we the Vatican believe
[1:21:25] that the Jews killed Jesus.
[1:21:27] Nevertheless,
[1:21:29] even though they started that 1962,
[1:21:33] Israel's statethood was still
[1:21:36] unrecognized by the Vatican. They still
[1:21:39] don't recognize the statethood of
[1:21:41] Israel.
[1:21:43] The Vatican only recognized the Jewish
[1:21:46] state 46 years after the creation of the
[1:21:51] state. They only recognized it 46 years
[1:21:55] after the United Nations recognized it
[1:21:59] like the rest of the international
[1:22:01] community. And it does not does not as
[1:22:05] of this moment today in 2005
[1:22:08] does not recognize Israeli sovereignty
[1:22:13] over East Jerusalem.
[1:22:16] So, here's a here's a power on earth
[1:22:19] that is saying Jerusalem, we will not
[1:22:23] acknowledge that Jerusalem belongs to
[1:22:25] Israel when God himself almighty says
[1:22:28] it's theirs.
[1:22:34] This present pope, Pope Paul II,
[1:22:38] journeyed to Jerusalem in an in an
[1:22:41] attempt to heal
[1:22:44] the division between the Vatican and the
[1:22:46] Jews.
[1:22:51] One of the things too that is
[1:22:54] outstanding
[1:22:56] uh that has taken place in our time is
[1:22:59] that this present pope
[1:23:02] also was instrumental
[1:23:05] almost singlehandedly
[1:23:08] bringing down communism
[1:23:14] in a in a magazine Front Line and it's
[1:23:18] from a book John Paul II and the fall of
[1:23:21] communism.
[1:23:23] Just briefly, it said it took time. It
[1:23:26] took the Pope's support from Rome, some
[1:23:30] of it financial. It took several more
[1:23:33] trips in 1983
[1:23:35] and in 1987.
[1:23:38] But the flame was lit. It would smolder
[1:23:41] and flicker before it burned from one
[1:23:43] end of Poland to the other.
[1:23:46] Millions of people spread the
[1:23:48] revolution, but it began with the pope's
[1:23:51] trip home in 1979
[1:23:55] as the leader of uh Poland said that was
[1:24:00] the detonator
[1:24:02] that detonated what took place. And you
[1:24:05] have seen here in the church uh the
[1:24:08] video that we showed where the pope
[1:24:11] joined with the United States and with
[1:24:14] President Reagan and designed the
[1:24:16] downfall of communism and they did
[1:24:19] succeed.
[1:24:20] It shows them joining. Here's what a
[1:24:22] prophet said in 1961.
[1:24:28] The Jews are in their homeland
[1:24:31] for the span and space of time 40 years.
[1:24:34] The new city's been built. They're
[1:24:37] watching for what? A coming Messiah.
[1:24:40] When will it be? I don't know. When that
[1:24:43] stone smites the image here, she's gone.
[1:24:46] It's all over then. Now, notice here in
[1:24:48] the middle of the week, three and a half
[1:24:50] years.
[1:24:52] He breaks the covenant and causes the
[1:24:55] sacrifice and oblation that they will
[1:24:59] have set up already.
[1:25:02] cuz they'll go right back and say now,
[1:25:04] now he says, "Now look, you all are
[1:25:08] churches.
[1:25:09] You can be received in this image under
[1:25:13] the beast. We'll have a fellowship."
[1:25:17] He He's saying that's what they will
[1:25:19] say. We'll have a fellowship.
[1:25:21] We'll get rid of communism.
[1:25:24] We'll just wipe communism all the way
[1:25:27] out.
[1:25:29] And they can do it.
[1:25:32] And they will do it.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Who who had sufficient
[1:25:46] stamina,
[1:25:49] not stamina,
[1:25:51] insight,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[1:25:55] And he said earlier, if you caught it,
[1:25:58] and God will send the spirit of
[1:26:00] knowledge into the church in the end
[1:26:04] time to reveal these things. This is
[1:26:06] what I'm reading. This is the spirit of
[1:26:08] knowledge
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; that is informing you. And now we look
[1:26:14] back and say, "Oh my goodness, I didn't
[1:26:18] see that. I didn't know that was
[1:26:20] happening." And these things are just
[1:26:22] happening on on a world scale like world
[1:26:24] events. And there are so many things we
[1:26:27] think are world events and they're not.
[1:26:29] They are the fulfillment of the
[1:26:32] scripture.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; But you wouldn't even know where to look
[1:26:35] unless you had a prophet to tell you
[1:26:37] that scripture. There it is and there it
[1:26:40] is and here it is
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; and we're seeing it.
[1:26:48] They'll wipe communism
[1:26:51] and communism at the time of 1961, 1962
[1:26:56] happened to be the missile crisis in
[1:26:59] Cuba 90 miles off the American coast
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; and the Russia was had sweeping Europe,
[1:27:10] African nations,
[1:27:12] India leaned to communism. When I was
[1:27:15] there, that's all you could read about
[1:27:17] in their national h the the Hindu the
[1:27:19] newspaper. They leaned towards
[1:27:22] communism. They got their help there.
[1:27:24] The Arab nations
[1:27:27] all surrounding Israel.
[1:27:30] Communism was sweeping like a flood. And
[1:27:32] every preacher, every preacher you could
[1:27:35] hear on the radio was blasting out
[1:27:37] against communism. We must preach
[1:27:39] against communism. And here stands one
[1:27:41] voice and says, "It makes me sick. to
[1:27:45] hear all that makes me sick. It's just a
[1:27:47] bluff. It's just a tool in God's hand
[1:27:50] and it's going to fall and God's going
[1:27:52] to wipe it out.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I say blessed be the name of God. The
[1:27:57] God of Elijah,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; the God of William Brham is the God that
[1:28:01] we want to serve and
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; believe in.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And if you ever heard anything, you want
[1:28:06] to hear these things and listen to them.
[1:28:09] 40 years.
[1:28:13] The recent earthquake
[1:28:16] happened to be the largest in 40 years.
[1:28:21] And as I said at watch night, this last
[1:28:25] year was like it was
[1:28:28] uh had a book end of an earthquake on
[1:28:30] one end and a earthquake on the other.
[1:28:34] Now we're 40 years in this last year.
[1:28:38] had a massive earthquake in Bam Iran.
[1:28:42] 90% of the city gone and now what the
[1:28:45] world is coping with. This one was
[1:28:47] different.
[1:28:50] This one was not in a country.
[1:28:53] This one did destruction
[1:28:56] in 13 nations.
[1:29:00] And I had a list of them which I won't
[1:29:03] weary you with.
[1:29:06] But all of the nations that are
[1:29:07] involved, including United States and
[1:29:11] Canada and Norway and Sweden and New
[1:29:13] Zealand and Australia and South Africa,
[1:29:17] Brother Dawn and Brother Leon Gave lost
[1:29:21] an aunt and uncle in this uh tsunami.
[1:29:28] And we don't we're waiting to hear about
[1:29:31] believers, but we believe God is
[1:29:33] protecting them. That's all we can do is
[1:29:35] believe that God is protecting them. Uh
[1:29:39] is is this significant? Of course, it's
[1:29:42] significant.
[1:29:44] It is the they said it was like
[1:29:48] 750
[1:29:49] times
[1:29:51] anything that they've had in the recent
[1:29:53] 5 years. It is every earthquake in the
[1:29:55] last five years put together. And this
[1:29:58] one's greater than all of those. They
[1:30:01] said it actually sped up the rotation of
[1:30:04] the earth,
[1:30:09] one of the reporters,
[1:30:12] he said the 33 ft tidal waves
[1:30:17] there perhaps were higher in some place.
[1:30:19] This is what he reported
[1:30:21] was described by Gordon Brown as a
[1:30:25] disaster of almost biblical proportions.
[1:30:30] This thought was echoed by the
[1:30:32] Washington Post reporter,
[1:30:35] Michael Dobs, who was swimming off Sri
[1:30:38] Lanka Island when the tidal wave flooded
[1:30:42] in. He said, "The speed with which it
[1:30:45] was it all happened seemed like a scene
[1:30:49] from the Bible." Isn't it amazing how
[1:30:52] they all turn to the scripture
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; to identify and describe what's
[1:30:59] happening?
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; He said a natural phenomenon unlike
[1:31:08] anything I had experienced before.
[1:31:11] Italy's National Geoysics Institute
[1:31:15] said it was so strong that it even
[1:31:19] disturbed the rotation of the earth. The
[1:31:23] last 30 years have been a dramatic
[1:31:26] increase in killer earthquakes. the most
[1:31:29] devastating to date happening on the
[1:31:32] 28th
[1:31:34] uh July 28th, 1977,
[1:31:37] 1976 rather in China when 240,000
[1:31:42] were killed. There's never been anything
[1:31:45] like this in recorded history like this
[1:31:49] one. They said a multination
[1:31:52] disaster and it requires a multi-nation
[1:31:58] response.
[1:32:00] And there shall be signs
[1:32:03] in the sun and in the moon and in the
[1:32:06] stars and upon the earth distress of
[1:32:08] nations
[1:32:10] and for with perplexity
[1:32:12] the sea and the waves roaring and men's
[1:32:17] hearts failing them for fear and for
[1:32:21] looking after those things which are
[1:32:23] coming on the earth. For the powers of
[1:32:25] the heaven shall be shaken.
[1:32:34] Now, this prophet said, spoke of the
[1:32:39] pope, spoke of the darkening out, spoke
[1:32:42] of this visit, spoke of another visit,
[1:32:45] spoke of the 40 years, and all of these
[1:32:47] things are happening in this 40-year
[1:32:49] span.
[1:32:51] He says,
[1:32:56] "God's going to sink Los Angeles.
[1:33:02] You think this one's bad?
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; God's going to sink Los Angeles.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And perhaps this is why
[1:33:17] there's a video apparently uh I know
[1:33:20] nothing about it. I have not seen it. I
[1:33:23] It's entitled
[1:33:25] It's been titled Death by Entertainment.
[1:33:30] And it's a brief analysis of the
[1:33:32] material
[1:33:34] that's available on video and it's
[1:33:36] speaking I believe it's of a warning
[1:33:38] nature.
[1:33:41] The video gives a historical
[1:33:43] perspective.
[1:33:45] Now these people know nothing of the
[1:33:47] message. But now I'm putting out to you
[1:33:50] who are familiar with the message. And
[1:33:52] if you're not, you should be.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You young people need to get into it to
[1:33:57] hear. You may think that it's just a
[1:33:59] sermon. As I said to the people in
[1:34:01] Ghana, Brother Brandham's messages are
[1:34:03] not sermons. They are announcements.
[1:34:06] They announce things that are happening
[1:34:09] and tie them to things that have
[1:34:10] happened. And you may think that you're
[1:34:12] just reading a sermon. You may think, I
[1:34:14] don't understand it. It It's not whether
[1:34:17] you understand it. It's what the Holy
[1:34:19] Spirit is putting in you so that you
[1:34:21] will understand the day that we're in
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; and the time that we're living in.
[1:34:27] The video, this video gives a historical
[1:34:31] perspective showing how the most
[1:34:33] corrupting, the most corrupting
[1:34:37] influences in Hollywood were held back.
[1:34:42] Listen now, they were held back. The
[1:34:45] most corrupting of them were held back
[1:34:48] between 1933
[1:34:51] and 1966.
[1:34:57] 1933,
[1:34:59] God sends a messenger,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; a prophet messenger to the earth with a
[1:35:04] message.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; And here's people who are actually
[1:35:08] writing and and developed a video of
[1:35:12] warning death by entertainment because
[1:35:15] they are so concerned of the wave of
[1:35:18] evil that has spread across the earth
[1:35:21] and stands a profit. And for those exact
[1:35:24] years in 1966, he's gone. And the relief
[1:35:28] is gone. And this is what they've said
[1:35:31] further that from 1933 to 1966, it was
[1:35:36] held back by the motion picture code
[1:35:40] which was which was produced and
[1:35:43] monitored by the churches
[1:35:46] in 1966.
[1:35:49] Now the prophet's gone right at the end
[1:35:52] at the first of 1966 he's gone. And at
[1:35:56] the end of 1966
[1:35:58] the liberal national council of churches
[1:36:02] which the prophet screamed out against
[1:36:05] all his years screamed out against that
[1:36:08] council of churches and they they
[1:36:11] abolished this code. The churches.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Can you grasp this? the churches,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; the National Council of Churches
[1:36:23] abolished the code so that the
[1:36:25] corruption could be released.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Where are we at?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; And God, a holy God in heaven, has
[1:36:37] looked down upon this, and he's not
[1:36:40] going to sink that place.
[1:36:44] And a council of churches abolished this
[1:36:47] code and effectively abandoned
[1:36:51] any Christian influence on Hollywood.
[1:36:55] Listen to this. These are not believers.
[1:36:58] These are people who are dreadfully
[1:37:00] concerned because now they're being
[1:37:03] swept in a title wave of iniquity and
[1:37:06] sin and perversion and terrible
[1:37:09] wickedness and evil. And they said from
[1:37:12] that point on the floodgates
[1:37:17] were opened for violence,
[1:37:20] explicit sex, oult influences to take
[1:37:24] over and for any opposition to this to
[1:37:28] be dismissed as censorship of artistic
[1:37:32] freedom.
[1:37:37] God held it back.
[1:37:40] by a prophet's message, by the influence
[1:37:43] of one man on the earth, God held it
[1:37:46] back. And when that voice was silenced,
[1:37:49] it was let go and away they went.
[1:37:56] The average child, this is now today,
[1:37:59] the average child watches 28 hours of TV
[1:38:04] a week. The average teenager 23 hours.
[1:38:10] By mid- teen years, children have
[1:38:13] watched 15,000 hours of TV, more time
[1:38:18] than spent with teachers, parents, and
[1:38:22] friends put together.
[1:38:25] Their friend, their teacher,
[1:38:30] their associate has been a television.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:34] And by the age of 18, they've seen
[1:38:38] 16,000
[1:38:40] murders
[1:38:41] and 200,000
[1:38:44] acts of violence.
[1:38:47] And by the age of 11, they have watched
[1:38:51] 400,000
[1:38:54] 400,000
[1:38:56] by the age of 11 acts of sexual innuendo
[1:39:01] primarily between non-married
[1:39:04] persons.
[1:39:06] The growing number of films and TV
[1:39:09] programs encourage young people to be
[1:39:12] involved in sorcery,
[1:39:15] witchcraft, and alternative religions.
[1:39:19] Onethird of criminals convicted of
[1:39:21] violent crime admitted that they were
[1:39:24] copying what they had seen on the media.
[1:39:31] They did a test,
[1:39:34] and I guess this isn't exactly my
[1:39:36] message, but it certainly sets a tone
[1:39:38] for it. They did a test. They took three
[1:39:41] year children, three-year-old children,
[1:39:44] put them in a room,
[1:39:47] and they w had them watching a
[1:39:50] television screen.
[1:39:52] And on the screen was introduced a
[1:39:55] little doll.
[1:39:57] And the doll was taken and
[1:40:01] caressed and cuddled and held and showed
[1:40:06] in in love.
[1:40:09] And then they took the children in the
[1:40:10] room and that doll was there.
[1:40:15] And they said everyone of the children
[1:40:17] that were in that test took that doll
[1:40:20] and cuddled it and cradled it and
[1:40:23] caressed it as they had seen on the
[1:40:25] television.
[1:40:26] And then they took the same children and
[1:40:29] put them in and they watched a watched a
[1:40:32] a film then and people had that doll
[1:40:36] there in the room and they took a hammer
[1:40:39] and beat on that doll and took those
[1:40:42] same children into another room where
[1:40:45] that doll was on the floor and every one
[1:40:48] of them took the hammer and beat on that
[1:40:50] doll.
[1:40:54] One man said, "For us to believe," and
[1:40:57] this man was from Washington DC. He
[1:41:00] said, "For us to believe that we could
[1:41:03] expose our people and especially young
[1:41:06] people to this kind of explosion of
[1:41:10] violence,
[1:41:12] sin, and corruption." This man's not a
[1:41:15] preacher. He said for us to believe that
[1:41:17] we could choke and that they can come
[1:41:19] out as wholesome young people without a
[1:41:22] life of crime. He said is for us to
[1:41:24] believe that you can take a healthy
[1:41:25] person and send them into an infirmary
[1:41:28] that's contaminated with disease and all
[1:41:30] kinds of germs and expect them to come
[1:41:32] out healthy.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make any sense. What is it?
[1:41:36] It's insanity and capital letters. It
[1:41:39] total insanity.
[1:41:44] And this has flooded from Hollywood.
[1:41:49] It's been exported
[1:41:53] in a message. Who do you say this is?
[1:41:56] He said, "We find ourselves at this
[1:41:58] Christmas." And this was 1964 and this
[1:42:01] is 40 years ago.
[1:42:07] a prophet's voice saying 40 years ago, a
[1:42:11] generation ago, now we find ourselves
[1:42:15] at this Christmas
[1:42:17] just about like they did the first
[1:42:21] Christmas.
[1:42:22] The world's just about to fall apart.
[1:42:27] And as I preached once somewhere about a
[1:42:30] Christmas message, the world falling
[1:42:33] apart. And this world again is just
[1:42:37] about to come to pieces. Look at the
[1:42:40] earthquakes over here in California. And
[1:42:43] I predict before the coming of the Lord
[1:42:46] Jesus that God will sink that place. And
[1:42:50] I believe that Hollywood and Los Angeles
[1:42:54] and them filthy places over there that
[1:42:57] God Almighty will sink them. They'll go
[1:43:00] beneath the bottom of the sea. And it's
[1:43:03] so much sin. You see, it's the barrier.
[1:43:07] Because of the sin, God is going to sink
[1:43:10] it.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Civilization has traveled with the sun
[1:43:17] and it started in the east going west
[1:43:19] and now it's at the west coast. If it
[1:43:23] goes any further, it'll go back east
[1:43:24] again. And so that's the barrier and sin
[1:43:28] has traveled with civilization and it
[1:43:30] becomes a cesspool of all ages.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to
[1:43:39] say amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; And you ought to thank God that you see
[1:43:45] what you see and that you hear what you
[1:43:48] hear. And more than that, that there's
[1:43:50] something within your soul that responds
[1:43:53] to it positively.
[1:43:56] Some people don't want to hear these
[1:43:57] things. I don't only want to hear them.
[1:44:00] I want a heart that believes them. And
[1:44:03] you that have not heard them. And you
[1:44:05] young people, you want to be warned. If
[1:44:07] I don't see it, you surely will say it.
[1:44:10] I'm expecting to see it any time because
[1:44:12] we're right there.
[1:44:18] You don't want to wake up like a lot of
[1:44:21] folks today have woke up in nation after
[1:44:25] nation after nation, many nations and
[1:44:29] find themselves devastated and at a
[1:44:32] great loss and ashamed of him.
[1:44:36] He said, "I was surely standing there
[1:44:38] under that inspiration." Put judgment on
[1:44:41] that West Coast and then followed it
[1:44:44] right up here. He says, "The sinking of
[1:44:46] Los Angeles. She's gone." That's right.
[1:44:49] It will happen. When? I don't know.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; And choosing of a bride,
[1:44:57] which was in Los Angeles, California,
[1:45:00] 1965,
[1:45:02] his last time. said he stretched himself
[1:45:05] out further in this service than at any
[1:45:08] other time. And he closes off. He said,
[1:45:12] "Remember, one day you'll be laying at
[1:45:14] the bottom of the sea. Your great
[1:45:17] honeycomb under you right now. The wrath
[1:45:20] of God is belting right beneath you. How
[1:45:23] much longer he'll hold this sandbar
[1:45:26] hanging over that?" And science has even
[1:45:28] shown that Dr. Dr. uh Jacobs from India
[1:45:32] was here who his special his specific
[1:45:35] field of of study is the earth's crust
[1:45:39] and he described for us the actual
[1:45:42] structure of the earth's crust under Los
[1:45:45] Angeles and he said what brother
[1:45:47] Brandham said it will slide into the
[1:45:49] ocean he said is exactly correct because
[1:45:52] uh layers of the substance that are
[1:45:54] under California which is a bench they
[1:45:57] know that he said is actually similar to
[1:46:00] graphite ite you would understand the
[1:46:02] people would understand graphite. He
[1:46:04] gave the technical term to it and he
[1:46:07] said it's like graphite and when that
[1:46:09] earthquake takes place he says that
[1:46:12] bench will literally slide into the
[1:46:15] ocean.
[1:46:20] He said that holding that sandbar over
[1:46:22] there. But when that ocean out yonder a
[1:46:25] mile deep will slide in there plum back
[1:46:29] to the salt and sea, it'll be worse than
[1:46:32] the last day of Pompei. I've been to
[1:46:35] Pompei. I've seen the people with their
[1:46:38] hands and their arms all in a grotesque
[1:46:41] manner. That that dust Pompei and that
[1:46:44] heat wave that blew in there caught
[1:46:47] them. Exactly. You can see in places
[1:46:49] they still left the bodies there and
[1:46:51] they're and they're just encased in that
[1:46:53] volcanic dust. And you ought to hear
[1:46:55] what the prophet speaks about the
[1:46:57] volcanics and the volcanic dust caught
[1:46:59] them on their knees going towards the
[1:47:02] door, their hands, their fingers all
[1:47:04] stretched out. You want to go and see
[1:47:06] Pompei. And Pompei was a city of sin.
[1:47:09] Pompei was where the rich Romans went
[1:47:12] and it faced the ocean out there. And
[1:47:15] they would they were the the the the
[1:47:18] rich and the famous and the powerful
[1:47:20] within the Roman Empire would go there
[1:47:23] and their sin the the uh the paintings
[1:47:26] that are still on the wall depict their
[1:47:29] sin. You go down one street, this was
[1:47:32] the brothel. All of these places where
[1:47:34] they had their prostitutes and God and
[1:47:37] and they went there. went there to to uh
[1:47:42] to rejoice over the destruction of
[1:47:45] Jerusalem.
[1:47:48] They went there and rejoiced over the
[1:47:50] destruction of Jerusalem and God
[1:47:53] destroyed them on the spot.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I feel like doing a dance
[1:47:59] myself, rejoicing in the God of my
[1:48:02] salvation. What a mighty God we have.
[1:48:05] And he does all things right.
[1:48:10] I tell you, the only justice we know, we
[1:48:12] know a God of justice is going to
[1:48:14] destroy sin and destroy sinners. And if
[1:48:17] you love sin, you're doomed with it.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; And if you love God and holiness and
[1:48:23] righteousness, you have been set free
[1:48:25] from it.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; It'll be worse than the last days upon
[1:48:35] pay. He said, "Repent, and the rest of
[1:48:39] you, turn to God. The hour of his wrath
[1:48:42] is upon the earth. Flee while there's
[1:48:45] time to flee and come into Christ.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Our time is gone.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; I want to preach to you on worlds in
[1:49:01] collision.
[1:49:07] Hallelujah.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Worlds in collision.
[1:49:17] Jesus said,
[1:49:20] "I am not of this world."
[1:49:23] He said in another place, "No man has
[1:49:27] ascended up to heaven but the son of man
[1:49:30] who is in heaven." while he was standing
[1:49:33] on the earth.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says he was in two
[1:49:37] worlds.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; No one could understand him. And every
[1:49:41] believer, every bornagain believer has
[1:49:45] been born into another world.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; This world is demanding.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; This world is consuming. This world uh I
[1:49:56] is a world that imposes itself upon you
[1:50:00] that you must do certain things. You
[1:50:02] must go at a certain pace. You must be
[1:50:05] in a certain place geographically and
[1:50:08] physically involved in a certain way.
[1:50:12] But there's another world
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; that is that is merging in colliding
[1:50:17] with this one.
[1:50:19] Yes, sir.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Two worlds.
[1:50:24] The one that God made
[1:50:29] and the one that we live in.
[1:50:33] And then the plurality of the two
[1:50:37] that a born again believer
[1:50:40] lives in both at the same time.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] I want to describe for a moment.
[1:50:50] Oh my, I wish I had I wish I had the
[1:50:54] rest of the afternoon to preach what's
[1:50:55] on my heart.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; But the first world, the one that God
[1:51:02] made, people have such a twisted
[1:51:05] concept. They they quote John 3:16, "For
[1:51:09] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:51:12] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:51:14] believeth in him should not perish."
[1:51:16] It's not this world that he loved.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; How can he love this world?
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Perverted, hellbent,
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:51:28] God, haters of God, feeding on iniquity
[1:51:32] in the cesspool of iniquity. That's not
[1:51:35] the world that God loves. The world that
[1:51:37] he loves is the one he made in the
[1:51:39] beginning.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; The world he loves is the one he's going
[1:51:44] to restore back
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and he dropped his own stained his own
[1:51:48] blood at Calvary and stained the earth
[1:51:52] with his own newly created blood
[1:51:55] claiming it that I will purify it and
[1:51:58] I'll bring it back to his holy state.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; And that's the world I want to walk in.
[1:52:04] As the choir sang, I want to run and I
[1:52:07] want to walk where the angels trod.
[1:52:10] That's the world. And it's a real world.
[1:52:11] It's more real than the one you're
[1:52:13] sitting in today. This one's passing
[1:52:15] away, but that one will not pass away.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; And that one is not complete till you
[1:52:21] arrive there.
[1:52:27] The principle in the Old Testament,
[1:52:32] the principal understanding of world in
[1:52:34] the Old Testament, they do not have a
[1:52:36] single word in the Hebrew
[1:52:40] for world as such. And that is why the
[1:52:44] scripture says in the beginning God
[1:52:46] created the heaven and the earth. is two
[1:52:50] separate Hebrew words to describe the
[1:52:54] heaven and the earth. And that's how the
[1:52:57] Hebrews understood it.
[1:53:00] The concept of the world to the
[1:53:04] Israelites,
[1:53:06] the concept of world, when you said
[1:53:08] world to the Israelites, it was a a
[1:53:12] combination of history
[1:53:15] and the covenant of God. and how those
[1:53:19] two elements related to their
[1:53:22] relationship with Jehovah. So it was the
[1:53:25] history, the events that had taken place
[1:53:30] along with the covenant of God and how
[1:53:33] those things together blended together
[1:53:36] how they uh are how they are in
[1:53:38] relationship with their association with
[1:53:42] Jehovah that to them was the world the
[1:53:45] covenant and the happening the
[1:53:48] fulfillment of it and their relationship
[1:53:50] with God that was the world
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; that's not the world today
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; that is foreign to the world today. The
[1:53:58] world on there out here today, they
[1:54:00] don't they don't have any concept of the
[1:54:02] covenant of God. They're not looking at
[1:54:05] the covenant of God in relationship to
[1:54:07] what's happening. But we have a prophet
[1:54:09] who did.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; You get as excited as you like this
[1:54:17] morning. This is something for the
[1:54:18] people of God to rejoice over. I say to
[1:54:21] the redeemed of God, you ought to
[1:54:23] rejoice. And if there isn't something in
[1:54:25] your heart to rejoice over, you ought to
[1:54:27] repent.
[1:54:30] [Music]
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; This ought to be your joy. This ought to
[1:54:33] be your love. This ought to be your
[1:54:35] excitement.
[1:54:37] This is what you should be stimulated
[1:54:39] over. If this doesn't stimulate you, you
[1:54:42] need to be at this altar. They say, "Oh
[1:54:45] God, in this hour when these things are
[1:54:47] happening, stir me to my bootstraps.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't conceive the blindness
[1:54:59] of people that can't see these things,
[1:55:02] especially when they're spoken."
[1:55:08] And so the Hebrew understanding is quite
[1:55:10] different from the Greek which simply
[1:55:13] says cosmos. And you all know cosmos.
[1:55:17] There's a restaurant by the name of
[1:55:19] cosmos. But cosmos in the Greek is a it
[1:55:23] is the arrangement of the world. It's a
[1:55:26] harmonious or supposed to be harmonious
[1:55:29] arrangement of the world. It's the world
[1:55:31] order. Right.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Cosmos can also refer to the entire
[1:55:37] universe.
[1:55:39] And so it's a it's a broader word, a
[1:55:41] broader understanding
[1:55:43] as far as the Greek is concerned, not
[1:55:45] deeper. It's just the one single word is
[1:55:48] broader. And in the Hebrew, they
[1:55:50] actually have several words. They have
[1:55:52] heaven and the earth. And then a a
[1:55:54] second word which has to do with uh uh
[1:55:59] uh with the time span but we won't get
[1:56:01] into it just at this time but the word
[1:56:04] in the Hebrew and so in the New
[1:56:06] Testament we have cosmos and sometimes
[1:56:08] it refers to universe sometimes it
[1:56:11] refers to the world order and at other
[1:56:14] times it refers to the ages of time as
[1:56:17] they are as they progress. So it can be
[1:56:20] re referring to all of those
[1:56:24] as it says in Luke's gospel and it came
[1:56:27] to pass in those days that there went
[1:56:29] out a decree from Caesar Augustus that
[1:56:32] all the world should be taxed. So in
[1:56:36] this case it's not the universe that's
[1:56:38] being taxed and it is not the entire
[1:56:40] world of all mankind because they
[1:56:43] certainly didn't have control of them
[1:56:45] but at this time it was the the
[1:56:48] constitution or the government or or
[1:56:51] those that had control of world affairs.
[1:56:55] So and now in Genesis as I said earlier
[1:56:58] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:57:00] and the earth. The scripture also tells
[1:57:03] us through faith we understand that the
[1:57:07] worlds were framed by the word of God
[1:57:11] so that the things which are seen were
[1:57:14] not made of things which do appear in
[1:57:17] Ephesians. and to make all men see what
[1:57:20] is the fellowship of the mystery which
[1:57:23] from the beginning of the world hath
[1:57:26] been hid in God who created all things
[1:57:30] by Jesus Christ
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; in Matthew 13 and49
[1:57:35] so shall it be at the end of the world
[1:57:39] the angels that's not the end of the
[1:57:41] universe that's not even the end of the
[1:57:44] framework of this earth but this earth.
[1:57:48] This scripture that I read at the
[1:57:50] beginning, please don't weary. It says
[1:57:52] it is being preserved by the same word.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Now, just so you see where I'm going in
[1:58:01] case you won't be here next Sunday,
[1:58:04] that is why I read of current events
[1:58:09] where the world is reporting
[1:58:13] this this whole thing was held back. All
[1:58:16] this corruption was held back. All of
[1:58:19] this terrible evil and iniquity which
[1:58:22] was going to flood the earth and be ex
[1:58:25] and and and and and be exported out of
[1:58:27] Hollywood was held back from 1933 to
[1:58:32] 1966. It wasn't the National Council of
[1:58:35] Churches that held it back. It was the
[1:58:37] word of God that held it back.
[1:58:41] And then when a prophet came at the end
[1:58:43] and said it's over,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; then it was over.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Then it was loosed. Then it was world
[1:58:50] falling apart.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; And then it was choosing of a bride
[1:58:54] also. And then it was the invisible
[1:58:57] union of the bride. And then it was who
[1:59:00] do you say this Melzdc is? And then it
[1:59:02] was third Exodus because these things
[1:59:05] were on.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:16] So shall it be in the end of the world.
[1:59:18] The angel shall come forth and sever the
[1:59:21] wicked from the just.
[1:59:24] I believe it's happening now.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; We're in another world. I'm in another
[1:59:29] world. They can think I'm crazy as they
[1:59:31] want. I that only make me rejoice. If
[1:59:34] somebody who I know is insane thinks I'm
[1:59:37] crazy, then I know I'm right where I'm
[1:59:39] supposed to be,
[1:59:49] the original world,
[1:59:52] the heavens and the earth, the divine
[1:59:55] arrangement of God,
[1:59:58] God and his children in fellowship.
[2:00:01] That's the world I'm speaking of just
[2:00:03] now.
[2:00:05] Give me just a short time and I'm going
[2:00:07] to be done. I'll I'll just break is what
[2:00:10] I'll do. I have a a spot in my mind
[2:00:12] where I want to break.
[2:00:15] The prophet speaks in oneness.
[2:00:17] The first man and the first woman in the
[2:00:21] Garden of Eden. You've heard these
[2:00:23] before, but now hear them in reference
[2:00:25] to the context of the message this
[2:00:28] morning. The first man and woman in the
[2:00:31] Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[2:00:34] with God so much that God could come
[2:00:38] down at any time he desired and talk lip
[2:00:43] to ear with Adam and Eve. I say, "Oh
[2:00:46] God, let that be now. Don't let this
[2:00:48] world so consume me or so consume you.
[2:00:52] Let don't let this world make so many
[2:00:54] demands on you. Don't let this world so
[2:00:57] impose itself upon you that God has to
[2:01:01] stand off. The Holy Spirit has to stand
[2:01:03] off. I can't get to them. Can't get to
[2:01:06] their mind. Can't even move them.
[2:01:08] They're so locked in. They're so
[2:01:09] encased. Oh, we want to. You say, "Well,
[2:01:12] I've got things to do. I've got work to
[2:01:13] do." Even while you're doing it, I don't
[2:01:15] care where you are. You can be God
[2:01:17] conscious.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can have your mind on
[2:01:20] God. What are you doing today, Lord? I
[2:01:23] want to be in tune with you. Here I am
[2:01:25] in school. Here I am in my studies. Here
[2:01:28] I am at my place of employment. Here I
[2:01:30] am doing the dishes. Here I am keeping
[2:01:32] the housework. But oh God, my soul is in
[2:01:36] tune and I am living in another world.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this world.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; That God could come at any time. He
[2:01:54] said, "Now that is perfect oneness, God
[2:01:58] and his creation, God speaking lip to
[2:02:02] ear with Adam and Eve." And they were so
[2:02:06] perfect in harmony with God till they
[2:02:08] were one with God. God and his family
[2:02:11] was one. I can tell you that that's I'm
[2:02:14] not I'm not just preaching something to
[2:02:16] you that is a bunch of hearsay.
[2:02:19] I have my mind on God when I'm washing
[2:02:23] my hands or whatever I'm doing. So often
[2:02:27] in the car, driving down the road, any
[2:02:30] time you can just have your mind set on
[2:02:34] God, he will keep him in perfect peace
[2:02:38] whose mind is set upon God.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; But in this in this world,
[2:02:50] that's the world.
[2:02:52] That is the arrangement.
[2:02:54] If you use the Greek, it would be
[2:02:56] cosmos. If you use the Hebrew, he
[2:03:00] created the heavens and the earth. And
[2:03:03] in the earth he set an order and a and
[2:03:06] of things from creeping things to things
[2:03:09] in the oceans and magnificent creatures
[2:03:13] which many are extinct today. And there
[2:03:16] everything was in order and the stars
[2:03:20] and the heavens and the earth was not
[2:03:22] lopsided.
[2:03:24] Hadn't been blown off its axes yet which
[2:03:27] is and that's only set that way for a
[2:03:30] period of time. And a prophet says it'll
[2:03:32] come back again.
[2:03:35] Oh, bless God. Going to come back again
[2:03:39] because it has to be set in order. It
[2:03:41] has to be put into perfection. But that
[2:03:43] was the order that God had. And it was
[2:03:46] marvelous. None of the things that we're
[2:03:48] so uh acquainted with today were in
[2:03:51] existence in that place. and God coming
[2:03:54] down at any time and and speaking lip to
[2:03:57] ear to his children. That was the
[2:04:02] arrangement.
[2:04:04] That was perfect oneness. That's what we
[2:04:07] desire and crave for. But in that world
[2:04:13] came colliding
[2:04:15] another one.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; One who was well organized.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. one with great leaders,
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; wicked
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; and violent,
[2:04:29] of leaders that knew worship, of leaders
[2:04:33] that had been in heaven,
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; of great angelic beings that fell to the
[2:04:38] earth and they were in a certain order
[2:04:41] and they had a leader. He was a master.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not glorifying him. Brother Brandham
[2:04:48] said he's a slipper. He said he's a
[2:04:51] theologian.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; He's a lover of beauty.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; This isn't just some wimp.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; It was a whole world.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; He had been in the presence of God. He
[2:05:07] had been at the right hand. He stood
[2:05:10] behind him. He was called the son of the
[2:05:12] morning.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; He was a creature of beauty. He walked
[2:05:17] through the garden of God with all the
[2:05:20] the stones of God as it were, with the
[2:05:23] beautiful colors and whatever more he
[2:05:26] was decked with.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; And it came that world
[2:05:33] with all of his ingenuity and all of his
[2:05:37] deception.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; A master of cunning.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; So cunning. Tell you what, you don't
[2:05:44] tackle him on your own.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; People to say, "Oh, I'm going to do this
[2:05:49] with my life and I'm going to be happy
[2:05:50] and I'm going to do this." Nonsense.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; People to say, "I don't have to listen
[2:05:56] to I don't have to listen to the word. I
[2:05:58] don't have to listen to the message. I
[2:05:59] don't have to listen to the preacher."
[2:06:01] You're doomed.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; You can take it on my word. You're
[2:06:05] doomed.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Absolutely doomed. God has his order.
[2:06:10] He's got his arrangement. And he will He
[2:06:13] will work through no other.
[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Anybody says, "I'm going to have my own
[2:06:20] pipeline directly to the reservoir." You
[2:06:23] don't have it. God set his own pipeline
[2:06:26] in order. He set his own He set his own
[2:06:29] uh He has his own arrangement.
[2:06:32] He has called apostles prophets. If you
[2:06:36] ignore the prophet, there's no way
[2:06:38] you're going to receive the word. For
[2:06:40] the word comes to the prophet.
[2:06:44] The apostle and establisher of the work,
[2:06:47] the pastor, the feeder and burden
[2:06:49] bearer, a teacher of the word and
[2:06:52] evangelist goes burning out. That is
[2:06:54] God's order.
[2:06:56] And God will never change that order.
[2:06:59] And God will bless nothing that ignores
[2:07:01] that order.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And that's thus sayith the word of God.
[2:07:07] He will bless nothing that is God's
[2:07:11] order. That's not brother Ed Biscll's
[2:07:13] order. I have nothing to do with it.
[2:07:15] That comes directly out of the word of
[2:07:17] God. Thus sayaith the word of God.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; There is no other way.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; But here he came.
[2:07:30] Here's what a prophet said about him.
[2:07:34] Now folks, I was with brother Brandham
[2:07:38] and he told me, he said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:07:41] you don't know what it's like." Sometime
[2:07:44] before I would come out on the platform,
[2:07:47] he would come to me and tell me, "When
[2:07:50] you step out, there'll be a woman up in
[2:07:53] the balcony in a yellow coat, and
[2:07:56] there's a man sitting down in the
[2:07:58] center. and the demon that's in her and
[2:08:02] the demon that's in him is going to join
[2:08:05] forces against you. But fear not, I'll
[2:08:09] be with you.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:08:16] you don't know what it was like to walk
[2:08:19] out. I'd walk out. I'd look up in the
[2:08:22] balcony and see that woman
[2:08:26] in the yellow coat and look down and see
[2:08:29] that man sitting in the middle and to
[2:08:33] know you don't kill me friends. You
[2:08:35] never convince me that there wasn't
[2:08:37] another world. And that's why when he
[2:08:39] stood there and to begin to reach into
[2:08:42] another realm, he would say, "Now I'm in
[2:08:45] another world." Hallelujah.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a world, friends.
[2:08:50] Another place, another arrangement,
[2:08:53] a place of power,
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; a place of infinite knowledge.
[2:08:58] [Applause]
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Who knew the secrets of the hearts and
[2:09:02] your problem is and your name is and
[2:09:05] where you live is here. And he knew
[2:09:07] everything about nothing was hidden in
[2:09:10] front of that infinite wisdom because it
[2:09:13] was not that of a man. It was that of
[2:09:15] God from another world.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:20] Thank you,
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; He fought a multitude of devils,
[2:09:25] battles with them. He said that told me
[2:09:27] that after a evening when they cast them
[2:09:29] out, he'd go home, they'd be screaming
[2:09:32] at him.
[2:09:34] Screaming at him
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; where they had no dwelling place.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. It's a real place.
[2:09:43] It just it just frightens me when I see
[2:09:46] young people, young men trusting in
[2:09:49] their strength or young women in their
[2:09:51] beauty. That's a trap of the devil.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; What you got up here isn't worth two
[2:09:58] cents outside of God. It will only take
[2:10:01] you away from God. People think they're
[2:10:04] going to reason things out in their
[2:10:05] mind. You'll never figure out anything
[2:10:08] in your mind.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; You're nothing.
[2:10:12] Your strength can be gone in the next
[2:10:14] minute.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; God only has to call a breath out of
[2:10:17] your body and then you'll be in the
[2:10:18] presence of God to give answer for the
[2:10:21] life you live down here. And I assure
[2:10:24] you, he'll ask you what you did with the
[2:10:26] service.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; He'll ask you what you did when you
[2:10:30] heard the word of God
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; and you'll stand speechless
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; because there'll be no answer. Here's
[2:10:40] what the prophet said
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; of this enemy.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; He's a slicker.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; He's a real wise man,
[2:10:53] educated to the spot
[2:10:56] in worldly wisdom.
[2:10:59] He's beautiful.
[2:11:02] Organized his army with worldly wisdom.
[2:11:06] He's polished.
[2:11:09] I mean, he's smart. PhD, LLD,
[2:11:13] and all the rest of it. Just as wise and
[2:11:17] shrewd as he can be. Don't you fool with
[2:11:21] him. Unless you know what you're talking
[2:11:24] about.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; He's a slicker. He's wisdom. He's
[2:11:28] educated. He's organized.
[2:11:30] He said he's a slicker behind the
[2:11:32] pullpit
[2:11:35] or some little Ricky with his hair
[2:11:37] combed down like a duck sitting on his
[2:11:39] back out there to harm some mother's
[2:11:42] daughter.
[2:11:44] That's the guy come around with that
[2:11:47] little cute little He describes it. He
[2:11:49] said it's appealing.
[2:11:51] Sin is appealing.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; That describes him. It's a whole world.
[2:11:56] It's a world of beauty. It's a world of
[2:11:58] wisdom. It's a world of reasoning. It's
[2:12:01] a world and we become so susceptible to
[2:12:03] it.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; It's another order, another arrangement
[2:12:12] with Satan as its head. And that world
[2:12:18] sin entered the per perfection of God's
[2:12:22] cre blessed creation.
[2:12:24] Not merely one single act of of
[2:12:28] transgression that took place, but
[2:12:30] rather an entire realm, an entire world
[2:12:33] penetrated, pierced, collided with God's
[2:12:38] world.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; And it came, it came in on the power of
[2:12:43] one word.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; This whole
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm a fanatic now. This
[2:12:51] entire kingdom,
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; this entire world crashed and collided
[2:12:58] in a horrific collision with the world
[2:13:01] that God had arranged on one word n.
[2:13:10] And if that kingdom
[2:13:13] came and collided with this one on the
[2:13:16] basis of one word, then I say to you
[2:13:19] that God, it's incumbent upon him to
[2:13:22] send a prophet in this day with a word
[2:13:25] in his mouth to rid us of that kingdom
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; by the power of the same word.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; And that is why I take those those are
[2:13:37] not merely quotes. That's That's say the
[2:13:40] Lord.
[2:13:42] And he's dismantling this kingdom and
[2:13:45] taking you into another world.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I say hallelujah
[2:14:00] to our father.
[2:14:12] Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so much.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not even started. Our
[2:14:31] first parents,
[2:14:33] they began to experience
[2:14:36] what was strange to them.
[2:14:42] That pure
[2:14:44] mirror of their conscience and their
[2:14:46] mind.
[2:14:48] now became clouded.
[2:14:52] That immediate reflection with God and
[2:14:56] communion
[2:14:58] now was clouded.
[2:15:02] And they found something strange.
[2:15:06] They found a heaviness and a weight that
[2:15:09] they' not known.
[2:15:13] They found it something they never
[2:15:15] experienced. The sadness gripped them
[2:15:17] and tears came into their eyes. They had
[2:15:20] never cried before. And the prophet
[2:15:22] says, "Now they could weep.
[2:15:26] Now they could weep."
[2:15:29] And he said, "The tears begin to come
[2:15:31] down." He's not just telling some sad
[2:15:34] tear joking story. He's telling exactly
[2:15:37] what happened.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; This was new to them. They didn't
[2:15:41] understand that. And he said the tears
[2:15:44] went down
[2:15:46] Adam's face and dropped onto the bosom
[2:15:51] of his lovely bride and mingled on down
[2:15:57] with the blood that was flapping against
[2:16:01] their legs with the skins flapping
[2:16:03] against their legs. And there was this
[2:16:05] tears of sorrow.
[2:16:08] They could cry now.
[2:16:11] They could weep now.
[2:16:14] They'd never done this before.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; And another world was being introduced.
[2:16:26] I don't care who you are.
[2:16:29] I don't care who you are.
[2:16:32] We've all known what our parents knew.
[2:16:37] We've all had that heaviness overwhelm
[2:16:40] us.
[2:16:41] We've stood, some of us beside
[2:16:46] the coffin of a loved one.
[2:16:49] We have had to say goodbye to somebody
[2:16:53] or maybe a home torn to shreds
[2:16:57] by this enemy. Let me tell you, my
[2:17:01] brother, my sister, and you that are
[2:17:03] here, and children, young people, and
[2:17:06] maybe older ones raised, and I have read
[2:17:10] some testimonies, it is so
[2:17:13] heartwrenching
[2:17:15] to read what some have gone through. And
[2:17:17] when I think of what some are going to
[2:17:19] be going through for years, I'm talking
[2:17:21] even about believers. Every one of us
[2:17:24] have known a heart that's been wretched
[2:17:28] and squeezed
[2:17:30] and tears
[2:17:32] came down our face and we cried out to
[2:17:36] God.
[2:17:43] One of my prayers,
[2:17:45] it's a consuming prayer
[2:17:49] and I don't know perhaps
[2:17:51] I'll just share it with you. It's very
[2:17:53] personal.
[2:17:57] But quite often
[2:17:59] I get very broken
[2:18:03] before God. And this is very personal
[2:18:04] now.
[2:18:09] And the words, it's hard for me to say
[2:18:11] it, but the words that come from my lips
[2:18:14] are,
[2:18:16] I'm so sorry
[2:18:19] that I couldn't do more.
[2:18:22] I'm so sorry
[2:18:24] that I couldn't be a a better servant or
[2:18:28] a better Christian.
[2:18:31] I would like to be
[2:18:34] I'd like to be able to glorify your name
[2:18:36] more. I would if you just give me an
[2:18:39] opportunity. Help me. We miss these
[2:18:43] wonderful opportunities.
[2:18:45] And it has nothing to do with works,
[2:18:48] friends. Just get that out of your mind.
[2:18:50] It has nothing to do with works. It's
[2:18:53] just wanting that relationship
[2:18:56] and that fellowship with him. And I just
[2:18:59] wish Lord because I'm so aware this is
[2:19:03] my this is our only chance.
[2:19:05] I wish I was the age of some you younger
[2:19:09] man. I wish I was the age that you are.
[2:19:12] I tell you what, you want to give every
[2:19:15] moment of your life to him
[2:19:18] because we are not of this world.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; We are of another world.
[2:19:25] We are in this world but we are not of
[2:19:28] this world.
[2:19:33] and death came
[2:19:36] and all of its consequences.
[2:19:44] And brother Brandham describes it in
[2:19:46] such magnificent literature.
[2:19:50] They're mortal now
[2:19:53] and they can cry now.
[2:19:57] But this world
[2:20:00] didn't only have that streak in it. It
[2:20:02] was also
[2:20:04] tantalizing.
[2:20:07] There's a aspect of it because he's a
[2:20:10] master of beauty. He makes it exciting.
[2:20:15] He makes it enchanting.
[2:20:19] Makes it very reasonable. This is the
[2:20:21] thing to do.
[2:20:23] And he majors upon your talents and your
[2:20:27] gifts and your abilities and says you
[2:20:30] can go places, but you watch where it is
[2:20:33] he wants you to go.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Make sure that's the place you want to
[2:20:39] go.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; You can be something.
[2:20:45] Make sure that's the something that you
[2:20:47] want to be.
[2:20:51] But it's so enticing and there's so much
[2:20:55] enjoyment and as the scripture says of
[2:20:58] of of Moses that he chose to suffer with
[2:21:02] the children of God rather than to en
[2:21:04] enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[2:21:10] He looked to another world.
[2:21:13] When this season is over,
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; when the season of this little uh this
[2:21:18] little enjoyment is over, then what?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; And so they soon found
[2:21:31] that this became this world became
[2:21:32] filled with pain and sorrow and sickness
[2:21:35] and death.
[2:21:37] And they found also according to as as
[2:21:40] the scripture says and the world passeth
[2:21:44] away.
[2:21:46] This world is passing away. How is it
[2:21:50] passing away? It'll pass away by the
[2:21:52] same word of God that brought it into
[2:21:55] existence.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Can I carry on a few more minutes?
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes and then I'm
[2:22:05] going to close. I have a spot I want to
[2:22:06] close.
[2:22:09] and the world passeth away and the lust
[2:22:11] thereof. The Bible speaks of the
[2:22:15] pleasures of the world and that there
[2:22:17] will be lovers of pleasure. The
[2:22:20] scripture speaks of and when the seed
[2:22:23] was sown amongst thorns,
[2:22:26] he said, "And it was choked with cares."
[2:22:30] That's of this world. choked with cares
[2:22:34] and riches and pleasures of this life.
[2:22:39] Whether it be cares, there's a master.
[2:22:42] Maybe he can't get you riches. Maybe you
[2:22:44] haven't got riches, but he gives you
[2:22:45] cares and weigh it down with cares and
[2:22:49] burdens and choke choke choke the life
[2:22:54] of that seed out of you. Don't let him
[2:22:56] do it. I say in the name of the Lord,
[2:22:58] that is this world. But I'm still
[2:23:00] talking about this world.
[2:23:02] This world is laden with cares. Mark
[2:23:05] speaks of the cares of this world and
[2:23:08] the deceitfulness of riches. This world
[2:23:10] is controlled by a prince. Jesus said,
[2:23:13] "Hereafter, I'll not talk much with you.
[2:23:15] For the prince of this world, this world
[2:23:20] has a prince.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; He's got a plan. He's got a scheme. He's
[2:23:27] a slicker. He's smart. He's wise. He's a
[2:23:30] theologian. He's a preacher.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for the protection of the
[2:23:38] word of God that we have in this hour.
[2:23:40] If you didn't have the message, you'd be
[2:23:42] listening to some preacher today and he
[2:23:44] might just be a slicker
[2:23:47] bleeding for your money, your finances,
[2:23:50] this gimmick, this program for the young
[2:23:52] people. and and you young people get
[2:23:54] there and jiggle along and and have a
[2:23:57] high old time and think you're having
[2:23:59] some enjoyment and you'd be deceived and
[2:24:02] going to hell.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[2:24:11] but against principalities, against
[2:24:13] powers, against the rulers of darkness,
[2:24:16] against the rulers of darkness of this
[2:24:19] world.
[2:24:21] That's right.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; The one that we have a duality. We're
[2:24:24] living in this world, but we're not of
[2:24:27] this world. We have been born again by
[2:24:30] the spirit of God into another world.
[2:24:42] eyes in its own conceits. But the world
[2:24:46] we're in and our leader has said, "I
[2:24:49] have made foolish the wisdom of this
[2:24:52] world."
[2:24:56] Where's the scribe?
[2:24:58] Where's the disputer of this world? Hath
[2:25:02] not God made foolish the wisdom of this
[2:25:05] world? This world is filled with
[2:25:08] perplexity. They don't have answers.
[2:25:11] Even the churches don't have answers.
[2:25:12] The preachers don't have answers. It's
[2:25:15] filled with questions and questions and
[2:25:18] talk shows and the answer man and on and
[2:25:20] on we go. Am I wearing you out?
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; This world is filled with perplexity.
[2:25:27] And there shall be signs in the sun and
[2:25:30] the moon and stars and upon the earth
[2:25:33] distress of nations. Right today there's
[2:25:37] very much distress of nations. Every
[2:25:41] radio broadcast and every newspaper,
[2:25:44] television, whatever more is filled with
[2:25:47] that the world is filled with
[2:25:48] perplexity. And that perplexity is is
[2:25:51] it's filled with doubt.
[2:25:55] That perplexity in the Greek is it means
[2:25:57] that they are without resources.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; They don't have the answer.
[2:26:03] Even in this catastrophic situation we
[2:26:06] have, you know, they get a half a
[2:26:08] billion dollars worth of aid, but they
[2:26:11] don't have the they don't have the the
[2:26:13] wherewithal or the infrastructure to
[2:26:16] deliver it to the people and where they
[2:26:18] are. I'm not preaching on it. I'm just
[2:26:20] saying this is just one of the massive
[2:26:23] sources of this time of doubt. What do
[2:26:26] we do? We don't have the answer.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Like one man sent me an email. He said
[2:26:33] the United Nations couldn't even put on
[2:26:35] a good tea party, let alone get down
[2:26:39] food to these people and so on and so
[2:26:41] forth. Oh, that's this world. And why is
[2:26:44] it that way? People are saying, "What do
[2:26:47] I do with my children? What do we do
[2:26:49] with this family? What do we do with
[2:26:51] this situation?" My brother and my
[2:26:53] sister, the world that we come from has
[2:26:55] the answer. we that world will never run
[2:26:58] out of resources
[2:27:00] of what to do. We want to make sure
[2:27:03] we're not going by our mind that we're
[2:27:05] depending upon him. And the wisdom that
[2:27:08] comes from all mighty God has been
[2:27:10] expressed to us in the message of this
[2:27:12] hour.
[2:27:18] And then the prophet says in Thotyron
[2:27:21] church age about the pressures of this
[2:27:24] age, I'll put no other burden upon you.
[2:27:27] Each age had its pressures. And for
[2:27:30] example, the great burden of the last
[2:27:32] age is the pressure of riches, soft
[2:27:35] living, and nervous tension. We may not
[2:27:39] we may not be that mindful of it but we
[2:27:43] go and sit in our automobile. It it came
[2:27:46] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[2:27:48] evil.
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; It is good but it's also evil.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; You have a radio in the house. It's good
[2:27:54] but it's also evil.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is, there's good attached to
[2:27:59] it and there's evil. You get an
[2:28:01] education that's good but Satan can
[2:28:03] anoint it and take you the wrong
[2:28:04] direction. You use it for God and God
[2:28:07] will bless you for it. Everything must
[2:28:09] be subject to another world,
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; subject to another wisdom, another
[2:28:15] source of wisdom.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; And the pressures of a soft age that we
[2:28:24] seem unfitted to live in. He said in
[2:28:27] this fourth generation, this fourth age
[2:28:29] seems to have had a clear-cut burden. It
[2:28:32] was to defy Rome and stand up for the
[2:28:35] word even unto death. And I would say we
[2:28:38] should defy the enemy.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Defy the onslaught and the wave of this
[2:28:46] generation.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; It's a perverted age that we're in. It's
[2:28:52] an age of damning and cursing and
[2:28:54] terrible vulgarity. We ought to turn our
[2:28:57] backs on it.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and stand after
[2:29:02] righteousness and holiness and be
[2:29:04] unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[2:29:08] [Applause]
[2:29:16] Brother Brandham spoke and I'm coming
[2:29:18] now to a close
[2:29:21] but he spoke
[2:29:23] a Christmas message that time and he
[2:29:26] said the world now is about where it was
[2:29:31] when Jesus came and was born.
[2:29:39] Satan now had had 4,000 years.
[2:29:44] He was master
[2:29:46] building his Eden,
[2:29:49] gaining control.
[2:29:52] He could see how he was going to
[2:29:53] manipulate the kingdoms and how he he
[2:29:56] had a scheme in his mind, how he's going
[2:29:58] to use Rome, a world kingdom, and how he
[2:30:03] was just going to uh just change his
[2:30:06] colors and change his mask. Instead of
[2:30:09] being a pagan Rome, he'll just become
[2:30:11] papal Rome. And I'll raise up another
[2:30:14] office. Oh, it will be pompous. It will
[2:30:17] be filled. It will come to such power
[2:30:20] and glory. It just touch his hand. You
[2:30:24] understand that the nations of the world
[2:30:26] have given a half a billion dollars thus
[2:30:28] far for the suffering people down there.
[2:30:31] And you know what? The Vatican has given
[2:30:34] a voice.
[2:30:36] The richest the richest of all
[2:30:38] organizations on earth haven't given a
[2:30:41] penny yet.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Just said that we should give. Right.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Let all the people give.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; That'd be great.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; What good would it be for me to stand
[2:30:53] say we've had a disaster. All you people
[2:30:56] give. You have a right to say, "What
[2:30:58] about you?"
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; And I say, "What about them?"
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; Worth billions upon billions. They can't
[2:31:05] even total amount that they're worth on
[2:31:07] earth and haven't given five cents.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; I say it's a damnable system. And I hope
[2:31:14] this goes around the world on the
[2:31:16] internet and let them hear it. And I
[2:31:18] hope they're piping it right into the
[2:31:20] Pope's inner office. It's a damnable
[2:31:23] system.
[2:31:26] That's why we're against it.
[2:31:29] And the spirit that was in the church
[2:31:31] back there would defy them. And I defy
[2:31:35] that system. It's a damnable system.
[2:31:39] Rob the people and would give nothing
[2:31:42] back.
[2:31:44] Thank God I was delivered out of it. I
[2:31:46] was born in that home. I was born a
[2:31:49] Catholic. My sister was born a Catholic
[2:31:53] and we've been our mother and father.
[2:31:55] Oh, thank God we're delivered from that
[2:31:57] pain.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; She's the mother of Pilots.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said her daughters are
[2:32:06] with her.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Say they're nice people. They got to
[2:32:11] come out of there.
[2:32:13] It's an image to the beast.
[2:32:14] Protestantism is an image to the beast.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; And Rome is the beast.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; And that system is of this world.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; And we're of another world.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; And they had power.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; And they were in control of the then
[2:32:36] known world. They were the superpower of
[2:32:39] that time 2,000 years ago. And their
[2:32:43] armies marched proudly all through. And
[2:32:47] they had all their all their Caesars and
[2:32:51] all their various governors over this
[2:32:53] state and over this place. And their
[2:32:56] chariots marched. Oh, there was nobody
[2:32:59] like them. And they took and seized
[2:33:01] control of Jerusalem.
[2:33:04] We're in charge of Jerusalem.
[2:33:07] But God decided it was time for another
[2:33:10] world to collide.
[2:33:13] Hallelujah.
[2:33:15] Hallelujah.
[2:33:17] And it came down in a blood cell into
[2:33:20] the womb of a woman married. Hallelujah.
[2:33:24] One that they would call their goddess.
[2:33:27] But God used that womb and is bringing
[2:33:30] another world.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:37] Hallelujah.
[2:33:40] The great I am. The great I am is coming
[2:33:44] down
[2:33:46] colliding with this world. I am.
[2:33:52] Hallelujah.
[2:33:53] The great I am with healing in his
[2:33:56] wings.
[2:33:58] The great I am. Who can say I am the
[2:34:01] resurrection
[2:34:03] and I am the life. I am the light and I
[2:34:07] am the bread that came down from heaven.
[2:34:11] I am the capstone and I am the
[2:34:14] foundation stone. I've come now to
[2:34:18] introduce a new world.
[2:34:22] Hallelujah.
[2:34:24] Hallelujah.
[2:34:26] Hallelujah.
[2:34:28] Hallelujah.
[2:34:31] Hallelujah.

[2:35:00] [Applause]
[2:35:00] [Music]
[2:35:15] Hallelujah.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; The great I am.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; The great I am
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; who spoke to Moses in the bush. The
[2:35:29] Elohim
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; who came to Abraham in the tent
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; has come to us.
[2:35:41] [Music]
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Just stay in the atmosphere. Stay the
[2:35:46] way you are.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; God took a piece of the old earth.
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; The old earth.
[2:35:56] He knew what it was to be tempted.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; In that body of flesh, he to buy a body
[2:36:03] like we do,
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; like we have. And he suffered sorrows
[2:36:09] and pains. And he had all of those. And
[2:36:12] God took that piece of clay and passed
[2:36:16] it through death.
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; And that piece of clay came back. For in
[2:36:23] the resurrection, they went to look in
[2:36:25] the tomb, and the body was not there.
[2:36:30] It was a new earth,
[2:36:34] a new earth,
[2:36:37] the beginning of a new world. And
[2:36:39] behold, I make all things new.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; I make a new heaven and a new earth.
[2:36:47] [Applause]
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; New earth.
[2:36:50] &gt;&gt; A new earth.
[2:36:52] Hallelujah.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; A new earth rising up out of the earth.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; A volcanic eruption.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Up from the grave he arose.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; And the mountain filled the whole earth.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; And I'll start
[2:37:16] on the next service how he filled that
[2:37:20] earth.
[2:37:23] He fills it again the way he filled it
[2:37:25] the first time.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; We are not of this world. We're in
[2:37:31] another world. Friend,
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; don't let the devil ever tell you
[2:37:35] anything different.
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we ought to just sing.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; Down from his glory.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Ever loving story. My God and Savior
[2:37:52] came and Jesus was his name
[2:37:55] born
[2:37:57] as he was.
[2:37:59] Hallelujah.
[2:38:00] [Applause]
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:09] Worship him. Worship him in spirit and
[2:38:12] truth.
[2:38:21] Just before we sang on, have you bow
[2:38:23] your head in prayer? Father, we're so
[2:38:27] thankful.
[2:38:29] Oh God, I'm thankful that you have given
[2:38:32] this people. I just love them because
[2:38:34] they love your word and I know that you
[2:38:36] love them. You love them so deeply.
[2:38:41] You've purchased us and this morning
[2:38:43] we're rejoicing in your word, Lord. And
[2:38:46] I just feel trembling inside.
[2:38:50] Oh God,
[2:38:52] we want to cross over, but not before
[2:38:54] our time is fulfilled.
[2:38:57] Help this congregation and this body of
[2:38:59] people to be a mighty, mighty voice.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; Let them be a mighty army, oh God,
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; standing for truth and righteousness.
[2:39:11] We give you all the praise and all the
[2:39:13] thanksgiving. I thank you for your
[2:39:15] presence with us now in Jesus name.
[2:39:19] [Music]
[2:39:22] Brother Lord, would you come please down
[2:39:25] from his glory?
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; Lift it up to him now.
[2:39:31] [Music]

[2:46:47] things.

[2:46:51] holy name. For he has done great things.
[2:46:55] He has done

[2:47:16] And you can have your seats.
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; What a sacred moment.
[2:47:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; What a glorious time. Yeah,
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; very special moment for myself to be
[2:47:35] here in the water with brother Roger
[2:47:36] Monk.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; It was the right service.
[2:47:54] He always had said to me, I certainly
[2:47:57] want I want the right time
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; and this was the right time.
[2:48:04] The whole thought that was on my mind in
[2:48:06] regards to brother Roger and I direct
[2:48:09] these comments to him.
[2:48:13] Paul said that ye put on
[2:48:16] the new man
[2:48:18] and the new man is the theme
[2:48:21] which after God is created in
[2:48:25] righteousness and true holiness. And
[2:48:27] once again, Brother Rogers, the only way
[2:48:30] that God can create us in righteousness
[2:48:33] and true holiness
[2:48:34] &gt;&gt; is the way he did the first creation by
[2:48:36] his word.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; By his spoken word,
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; and Paul said again in Colossians, "And
[2:48:42] hath put on the new man which is renewed
[2:48:46] in knowledge after the image of him that
[2:48:50] created him." And the word that Paul
[2:48:53] used was new as recently made. Brother
[2:48:59] Roger, I put you down
[2:49:02] into the water.
[2:49:04] Jesus came out. A different Christ than
[2:49:08] he went in. Different. The same yet
[2:49:11] different.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; The image will be the same when you
[2:49:14] rise, but Jesus rose with a different
[2:49:18] body.
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:21] New, recently made,
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; fresh,
[2:49:26] unused,
[2:49:29] which is recently made. That which is
[2:49:31] recently made is superior to that what
[2:49:36] you shall rise with, my dear brother
[2:49:38] Roger Monk, is superior to that went
[2:49:41] into the water.
[2:49:46] And I would say
[2:49:49] in a natural no one can take our place
[2:49:53] in life
[2:49:56] and spiritually speaking, brother Roger,
[2:49:58] no one can take your place in the plan
[2:50:01] of God. And I leave you with this quote
[2:50:04] from the scripture. Therefore, if any
[2:50:07] man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[2:50:12] Old things are passed away and behold
[2:50:16] all things are become new. And brother
[2:50:19] Brandham said in this regard, "Oh
[2:50:22] brother," says stop looking at yourself
[2:50:25] and look at your sacrifice.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; If you can find any fault in that and
[2:50:32] the sacrifice, all right, but if you
[2:50:34] find no fault in that, then you're
[2:50:37] perfect.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Because it's not you that God's
[2:50:40] accepted. If he's accepted Christ
[2:50:45] &gt;&gt; and Christ accepted you
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; and you are dead and your life is hid in
[2:50:52] God through Christ sealed by the Holy
[2:50:56] Ghost and all the devils in hell can't
[2:51:00] turn you out of there.
[2:51:03] &gt;&gt; For you are God's property.
[2:51:06] &gt;&gt; God never looks at you. He looks at
[2:51:08] Christ.
[2:51:11] Brother Roger, would you like to just
[2:51:12] say how you God has dealt with you?
[2:51:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed reminded me this morning of a
[2:51:21] of a time that we were together some 30
[2:51:24] years ago and it's made me think about
[2:51:27] that since.
[2:51:29] And
[2:51:31] each level of creation has different
[2:51:33] speeds and maturity and gestation. you
[2:51:36] know, some mice can get conceived and
[2:51:38] get born and and die within a couple of
[2:51:41] years. In myself, it's taken 30 years to
[2:51:44] get to the stage. And uh but it's a very
[2:51:46] special moment. And I couldn't be with
[2:51:47] more special people. And but the
[2:51:50] Biscals, their offspring and their
[2:51:53] family who have adopted me and been very
[2:51:57] kind and generous to me, as have most of
[2:52:00] you, as I've been here for nearly 5
[2:52:02] years now, and I know more and more of
[2:52:04] you. I know you better and better every
[2:52:06] day and uh I thank God for that and it's
[2:52:09] a it's a wonderful family. So, thank
[2:52:11] you.
[2:52:13] Let's pray.
[2:52:18] Almighty God,
[2:52:21] divine arranger
[2:52:24] of this new world,
[2:52:26] the origin originator of this new life.
[2:52:31] You conceived it in your great thoughts
[2:52:34] and you've made them known to us.
[2:52:37] Today, Father, I want to give you a
[2:52:41] special thanksgiving out of my own
[2:52:42] heart,
[2:52:44] able to stand here with one that you
[2:52:46] brought forth into this world
[2:52:50] as we have known our brother Roger Monk.
[2:52:54] And oh God, we've seen your hand dealing
[2:52:58] with him, your voice speaking to him,
[2:53:01] touching him very deeply.
[2:53:03] And now, Father, we do know that he has
[2:53:07] repented.
[2:53:09] We do know, oh God, that now standing in
[2:53:12] the water to be baptized,
[2:53:15] identified with your death, your burial,
[2:53:18] and your resurrection,

[2:59:30] come to your house, Lord, not to be
[2:59:32] turned away, but to lift up our eyes to
[2:59:35] know that our redemption is drawing
[2:59:37] nigh. And Lord, there's something in our

[3:00:01] Brother Roger.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; We're rejoicing Lord that you can deal
[3:00:05] with hearts of men. And Father, if there
[3:00:08] be any this morning that feels the
[3:00:10] beckoning and the tug of the Holy Ghost,
[3:00:12] I pray God you'll deal with them
[3:00:14] mightily and bring them to the waters of
[3:00:17] life. living waters that have been
[3:00:19] opened up, Lord, in this glorious hour.
[3:00:22] Bless our brother. Fill him with the
[3:00:25] Holy Ghost and fire.
[3:00:29] Lord, we heard a tremendous word this
[3:00:31] morning. We believe it was fresh from
[3:00:33] the throne of God. We're thankful for a
[3:00:36] godly pastor. Lord, we pray that you'll
[3:00:38] anoint him mightily. Strengthen him, oh
[3:00:41] God. Let that word of God flow through
[3:00:43] him was our prayer. And father, as your
[3:00:46] people have received that word, let them
[3:00:48] tuck it within their souls, in their
[3:00:50] hearts, and God, may it become a reality
[3:00:54] to each and every one of us. Bless your
[3:00:56] people once again. Go with us, Lord. And
[3:01:00] Father, for the days that lay ahead, may
[3:01:02] the peace of God rest mightily upon your
[3:01:05] children. Father, we ask now you go with
[3:01:08] each and every one of us. In Jesus name
[3:01:10] we pray. Amen.
[3:01:13] Amen.

[3:01:23] dismissed in Jesus name.
