If you come this morning, Lord, someone Great. [Music] Lord, come here. [Music] Oh Lord, come here. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Got a number of prayer requests here this morning. I'm going to ask for brother Tom. It's good to have brother Tom, sister Joanne, brother Ken, and sister Linda back with us. And uh so I'm going to ask brother Tom to come and open the service in a word of prayer. There's a request for brother Louise that we remember brother Hugo Ve Vega. He's a pastor in Chile. He has diabetes and his health is not good and feeling very tired and just need a touch from God. Um there's u [Music] request from brother Chris that we pray the people who gave their heart to God on the street last night in Bellingham. Pray the Lord would keep and strengthen them. Star Brown and Sundance Brown I guess are their names. So I want to remember them in prayer this morning. There's a request from Sister Bev Charman. We pray for Sarah Lawler. She's been in the hospital since last Tuesday with a ruptured appendix. And our brother Gil Ashdown has two requests. One that we pray for a coworker uh who has requested prayer for her mother-in-law who has had a hip replacement, has had to have blood transfusions. Name's Darlene Taves. Also pray uh that for brother Gil's cousin who's very ill with a stomach condition. The doctors are unable to do anything more for her. Her name is Mavis Date and she knows that we're going to be praying for her this morning. Man, if you've got a need this morning, just lift it before the Lord. If you're listening in on the internet or the phone hookup and needed a touch from our God, you just lift before him as we go to prayer. Brother Tom, let's pray. [Music] Father, a very appropriate song as we've been singing. Someone's praying, Lord, come by here. But Lord, there's another stanza that goes, I am needy, Lord, come by here. And Father, I believe there's many needs that have need to be met this morning. And so Lord, with uplifted voice, uplifted hands, looking to you, the lamb of God, our redeemer, our savior, our husband, our bridegroom, our friend. You are our everything. You are all in all. And this morning, Lord, we unite our voices together saying we are a needy people. Needy of a God to come amongst us. Needy of a God to raise us up in heavenly places. needy of a God that can touch us, that can heal us, that can save us, that can deliver us, Lord. And so, Lord, we reach out to you by faith and say, "Come by here, my Lord. Come by here." As I lay my hands upon these requests as Brother Rod has spoken them, we pray, God, you'll come by their way, meeting their needs, how we've heard of great reports. have we been away and how God has moved and how God has delivered. All we say is once more. Lord, let the fire fall amongst us. Lord, let us not get into a lethargy. Let us not take this meeting as a common thing. But Lord, let us be worshippers. Lord, as Elijah did at evening time, he rebuilt the altar. He said, "Lord, I've done all according to thy word. Let the fire fall." I say, "Let the fire fall this morning, Lord. We've done all according to your word. Your prophet said when those doors open, we'll be there. When the minister stands, Lord, we pray that you'll come by his way. Anoint him. Speak through him, Lord. And let the fire fall one more time. And so, Lord, we're asking that you will move amongst us supernaturally in the hearts of every believer this morning. We love you. We love your presence. We love your people. And we say, "Father God, here am I. Speak to me. Speak to every heart and speak to every life." Lord, this is the Lord's day and we give it to you. We've come, Lord, desiring to hear from the throne of grace. Would you break every wall, everyone that is bound, loose the prisoners. Let the chains fall. Let the children of God have victory this morning. Lord, let them open their mouths and worship a God of their salvation. Lord, you're worthy of all praise, all glory, and honor. We're not doing this as a form, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're doing this because of a love service to you. So, we're asking now, vindicate your word within the hearts of your children and speak to us now. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. [Music] We're uh want to welcome everyone who's visiting with us. We're happy to have each and every one of you here this morning. Um someone's no stranger here. Allison Stallison Carol um down in Tucson, Arizona, formerly Allison Nygard. So I guess she's changed her name. So uh we're happy to have you here, sister. And uh also we have brother um Tamboui. Tamboui. I'm probably getting it all wrong. From uh Toronto. I don't think we've met our brother before. Why don't we get you to stand up? There you are. God bless you. Happy to have you here with us, brother. And uh from down in uh Phoenix, our brother Lucas Rubiki, who's visiting with us. And uh I don't know if Lucas has brother Lucas been up here before. Why don't you stand up, brother Lucas, so everybody sees who you are? Happy to have you here with us. Uh testimony. Sister Hannah Fzen wants to thank to all who prayed uh for the recovery of her Bible. She found it safe and sound. So, we're thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, we've got a group of sisters who are going to come and bless us with a song this morning. Maybe they could come. And, uh, while they're coming, let's sing Light of the World, You Step Down into Darkness. And we're here this morning to worship. Light of the world, you step down into darkness. Open my eyes and me. Beauty this heart adore you. The joy of all spend with you. Here I am to worship. Here I am to Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together love. All together worthy, alltogether wonderful to thee. Here I am to worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together love, all together worthy, all together wonderful to me. [Music] [Music] [Music] There's a pressure building underneath our wings, preparing a people to fly home. And I feel this difference in the air. Yet his spirit whispers to my soul that with patience I must still press to the go. [Music] be steady. It will strengthen me to know. I've got to be in condition to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. Holding loose all that I possess in this season. I find rest. Soon the last mourn will dawn on the sands of time. [Music] We will stack our weapons on the banks of heaven shore. But for now, we must polish our sword again, advancing onward. Even as the sun goes down, embrace the heat of battle. Taking back our ground till the captain says you've conquered. Train your armor for a crown. I've got to be in condition to go home. [Music] So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. Oh loose all that I possess in this season I rest. [Music] I will take your hand across the table. There we cry tears of joy for the harvest our laborers reap and the pain and heartache we carried on the earth. Alone they seem a friend now as we kneel before the throne. They served a purpose to ready me for home. I rejoice in the testing for I will overcome. I'm about to be the nation to you. So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. Holy loose. All that I possess in this season are my rest. I've got to be conditioned to go home. So I surrender to the fire that brings me change. Oh, they lose all that I possess in this season. I find rest only lose all that I possess. [Music] In this season, our fire rest. In rapturous season, we [Music] find rest. [Applause] Thank you, sisters. Certainly want to be in condition to go home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Want the Lord to take care of any attitudes that we have in our hearts. We just want to be in his perfect will. Um, we're going to ask sister uh Reissa to come and bless us with a song. This song's been requested by sister um Melody Stall and uh she's written a note which I won't read all of it but um I'll post it back on the bulletin board um if you want to read it but uh brother John Sister Melody and their children are leaving and uh going up to Fort McMurray I believe uh to be living and uh she just wants to thank everyone for their prayers, their love and strength and support that they've given over the last couple years. And uh thankful the Lord's brought the family together again. And uh just want you to continue to pray for them as they're gone. Amen. Sister Resa [Music] When I first began to walk with the Lord, I did not trust him. how he longed for me to understand that I could. And so through the valleys he led me afraid as I could be till I felt his loving arms embrace me. See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. [Music] He's come through too many times that puts my mind at ease. I'll stake my very life. He's going to take care of me. See, I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me. Oh, how could I ever doubt a God whose hands hold the universe? How could I ever question his ability? [Music] There's no place that I can go where he doesn't know the things that trouble me. He's always aware of where I am. and what I need. See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. He's come through too many times that puts my mind at ease. And I'll stick my very life that he's going to take care of me. See, I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me. I believe now after all these years he's been so faithful. He's proven to be true. Never more will I doubt or question why. But I've seen him work before and I know what my God can do. See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. He has come through too many times that puts my mind at ease for good. Oh, and I'll take my very life that he's going to take care of me. See, I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me. So I'll stake my very life and he's going to take care of me. See, I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me. Yes, I've been through enough to know he'll be enough for me. [Applause] Thanks, sister. Let's sing together. Jehovah Gyra, my provider. As brother Episcopal comes to bring the word. Let's stand as we sing it in worship to him. Jehovah Gyra. [Music] Hold your mind. [Music] You are [Music] for me. [Music] For you are mighty and by your I am set free. I shall you are with me. [Music] You supply. You supply all my needs. You are you are [Music] we are [Music] glor again. Jehovah, my Lord, you are more than [Music] you are my healer. I was str I am set free. [Music] [Applause] You are with me. You [Music] all mighty. [Music] You are more than enough. More than enough. You are more than enough for me. How many believe he's more than enough? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even more than we have need of. Praise the Lord. I'm going to go directly to the word. Have you turn in your Bibles to Romans the 6th chapter. And while you're turning, I'm going to say, see, brother John Stall, God bless you. And Sister Melody and the family is going to be moving up to Fort McMurray. We're going to miss you. We're going to miss you. And I know the children in the school will and the young people will miss your children. But we are wishing you well. and we're wishing you God's continued presence. Uh, and please stay in touch with us often. I know, brother John, you have my email. You can't burn it out. So, just email me and keep us informed. Let us know how things we just pray God's blessings will be on you and you'll be a a testimony. I can tell you as a young man, brother John had a great burden for his family, for his parents and uh we prayed together many times. We spoke many times and brother John, sister Sarah Stall, and the rest of their family are here, I would say, largely because of brother John's prayers. And remember, brother John, the God who answered those prayers still answers prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we say, God bless you. God bless you, Sister Melody, as you seek to bring up the children and be at the home with them and both of you as a couple and rear them up in the admonition of the Lord. You won't have the same body of people here, but sometimes when you have to stand alone makes you stronger. So God bless you. &gt;&gt; I want to read some scriptures starting with the 12th chapter. In fact is um the sixth chapter the 12th verse is what I'm wanting to say. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the law, in the lust thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. For you are not under the law, but under grace. What then shall we sin? because we are not under the law, but under grace, God forbid. Know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of righteousness, of obedience unto righteousness. But God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin, ye become the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness. In Romans 12, if you'll just turn over a page or two, Romans 12, we'll just read verses one and two. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Our most loving righteous heavenly father for your grace that has been poured out. How can we say thank you? There isn't sufficient words in the language. We don't have sufficient time on this earth. There isn't enough spokespersons to say it, Lord. And if we would fill the very atmosphere with praises and worship for your grace, yet we would not be able to exhaust what's in our hearts today. We truly want to say thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we know that you will grasp, oh God, in your great heart and mind what it is we truly mean. Thank you for redemption. Thank you for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Thank you for deliverance, oh God. Thank you for crushing the serpent's head. Thank you for the Holy Spirit that has sealed us into the kingdom of God. And I pray those that have not yet been sealed will be sealed. You are the baptizer. I pray those that are not healed will be healed. Oh God, I pray that all manner of marvels will be done in the name of Jesus Christ that his name may be praised. Bless us together. Anoint us, oh God. anoint me as I stand at my post of duty in the people to hear the word and then when they dis disperse from this place that that seed will bring forth much fruit in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. You might want to hold your Bibles open while you have your seats because uh I want to just look at that uh the verse we just read the first verse of u Romans 6. Our first verse that we read was was the 12th verse. I would like you to notice carefully. It starts out, let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, indicating immediately that there's a a personal a personal uh this is a personal decision. Let not now Paul would not be saying that if you couldn't do anything about it. So he's saying let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey uh it in the lust thereof. And to reign is to have uh to exercise kingly power. So you have the power within your own self given of God to make certain that unbelief because sin is unbelief to make certain that unbelief doesn't have rulership in your in your life in your body and uh and this is important and that you should you do have the power on the other hand also to obey in to obey God rather than to obey unright righteousness and it goes on to say neither neither or neither yield ye your members 13th verse. So yielding because it comes up twice here neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness your members is going to be very important. This is the this is actually the theme of the entire service is right here. Don't neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield your members unto God. And so yielding is a deliberate act of the individual. And you have the power to yield to righteousness or to yield to unrighteousness and to and to present or to yield your members as it says in uh in uh uh in the first verse there. Now he says also in the 16th verse, know ye not that to whom you yield your uh yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to obey. So to whoever you yield, whichever power you yield to, that's the one that you'll be subjected to. And but the yielding part is strictly it is it's clear from all of these scriptures that yielding is an act within our own power of choice. We can yield or we cannot yield. And we can yield to unbelief. We can yield to our desires. We can yield to sin. Or we can yield to God. We can yield to the Holy Spirit. I think of the prophet of God how he spoke of in in respect to the ministry that he had and and and the magnitude of that ministry, but it really focused right back down to a a very small word, yielding. Said, "I just yield myself." Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see this great, incredible, indescribable power and contact with God in this ministry. Said, "Oh my, that just baffles me." But he'd bring it right down to that one word. I just yield. And I got thinking today or while I was studying, I should say this last week, the power that rests within the church of the living God just by yielding to the Holy Spirit of God. What might even take place this morning if each member just said, "I I am here. I'm not here just to hear somebody speak. I'm not here just to see someone else. I have come here to yield my members to the moving of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; To yield is to give something up to somebody else or to concede. That is to yield. To give something up to move or to bend under pressure or with the application of force. When uh when a person yields to the Holy Spirit, I can tell you, you'll do holy things. &gt;&gt; When you yield to the Holy Spirit, you'll yield you live a holy life. &gt;&gt; When you yield to the Holy Spirit, you can only do what the Holy Spirit does. &gt;&gt; You believe that? And so we do not have to yield or allow ourselves to be caught in a compromising position or a compromising place by presenting ourselves inappropriately. Now I'd like you to notice something. The word yield which is used several times in the sixth chapter of Romans is the identical word the same word that is used in Romans 12. I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies. It is exactly the same because as soon as a person presents themselves you are already in the state of yielding. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. And I've been thinking really pondering that and it's a massive subject and I don't know how far along I'll get. But as soon as you present yourself, however you present yourself, you're already in the mode of yielding. So when we come here this morning, perhaps you didn't consider your as presenting yourself, but in a way you have. You've come in here and you present yourself as a Christian. You present yourself as a believer of the message. You present yourself, I'm a brother. I'm a sister in Christ. You present yourself, I'm a young person. I'm a young man or a young lady. Uh we present ourselves to one another in the congregation. But what we really want to do even beyond that, we want to come in here and the and the consciousness that should be uh uh focused that should really be uh enveloping our mind is I have come here to present myself members to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to do what would be pleasing to him. &gt;&gt; First I present my ears to hear the word. I present my eyes to see that which is pleasing to God. I present myself to God, my members. &gt;&gt; We presented our our mouths and lips to worship earlier and I will be coming on that in a little further on in the message. And so we do not have to I want to make the statement again. We do not have to yield or allow ourselves to be caught in a compromised position to by presenting ourselves in an inappropriate way. Now, you've heard and I've heard and maybe you've said and perhaps I've said some, "The devil made me do it." Well, Brother Bram said that the devil didn't make us do it. He said in hearing, receiving, and acting, he talked about Noah and the word of God was revealed to him. Even though there had never been rain, it had been revealed to him that there would be rain. And he says, "What if he had just uh taken like that the the first scoffer that came by?" Because they certainly did scoff at him, and said, the first scoffer that came by said, "Well, look at that old holy roller." He said he'd have throw the whole thing up and said my let's quit. He said that's the way people do when you say I got started and the devil made me go back. &gt;&gt; He said the devil didn't do it. You did it yourself. &gt;&gt; See, the devil didn't make us go back. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't make us backslide. You went back. &gt;&gt; See, and the devil doesn't make us stop. Oh, he he will come and with all of his forces and do everything that he can, but you don't have to yield to it. You don't have to give into it. You can resist him. And I know that he's been on all of our cases. &gt;&gt; If he hasn't, he wouldn't be a good devil. &gt;&gt; You say, "Is there such a thing?" Well, the Bible says he's an adversary. And I believe he's a good adversary. That's one thing he is. But you don't have to yield to it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to give into it. So he said, "Uh, you did it yourself." He said, "Everyone that comes to God has got to has got to be tempted and tried. They certainly do. A real believer has heard the word of God. He recognized it to be the word of God. He will he will act on it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "But uh" and then he goes on in the breach. He said a seal talking about being sealed by the Holy Spirit. A seal signifies security to its destination. This is not our destination. Bible way is not our destination. Your house this afternoon is not your destination or any trip you take your destination believe me must be must be your eternal home. your eternal residence. That's all we're living here for. And some of us may live uh a shorter term than others. And some of us may not get through the day. &gt;&gt; Like brother Brown says, in five minutes, you know, we could be a corpse in five minutes. We could all be in glory. &gt;&gt; That that's our destination. &gt;&gt; That is our destination. &gt;&gt; So he said we're sealed to our destination. And woe unto that guy that would try to break that seal. And the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken, but some will try. And he says, "You all have heard me say that the people said the devil made me do this." No. No. He said, "The devil didn't do it. You just weren't sealed in." So then because you because when you're sealed in, he's sealed out. &gt;&gt; I like that. when he's sealed in. When you're sealed in, he's sealed out. &gt;&gt; Little story I heard, and I've said it here before, so I think it'll be all right to make a light moment, but it is really bears a truth. They said someone was walking down the sidewalk and right in front of the church, the devil was sitting on the curb and he was crying. And they said, "What in the world would you be crying for?" He said, "They're blaming me for things in there that I haven't even got a chance to do yet." And you've heard it so often. No, the devil me. Oh, the devil is this. And because of the devil, and the devil's on my case, let me tell you something. You don't have to yield to him. &gt;&gt; You don't have to yield to him. And if you don't yield to him, he's powerless. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even the devil himself can't break the seal. &gt;&gt; Make sure we're sealed in. &gt;&gt; Anybody that you young people get uh driver's license, one of the things that you will be tested on, you'll come to a certain sign. It'll be a certain design and you know, you know what it says to stop and you know what it says to do some of the other obey some of the other signs. But one of the signs will be to yield and it'll only be an emblem. You have to yield. That means that there's something else on its way. There's there's something else that's possibly coming and you need to give way to that that may be coming. And I say when we are gathering here in the house of God, we're not gathering here just as a ceremony. We're not gathering here just to put in some time on Sunday. We're gathering here because there's a power on its way. Hallelujah. And God promised where two or three are gathered, there I am in the midst of them. So it's not my will, your will, my likes, your likes. It's what he wants. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I wonder if we can all agree together with a a hearty amen. Whatever the Lord's will is, that's what we want. Let that power influence that persuasion of the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ come and be the dominant force in this meeting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thy will be done &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so the word that Paul uses to yield is to stand by or to place beside to stand by one or to place beside but now I I'm I'm going to emphasize this throughout the service but it is to present to stand by to be near but also So to present oneself, it is to place a person or a thing at one's disposal. To yield, as we've come to the house of God this morning and as we continue to live our Christian life, to yield and never forget it, please present h present yourself to another to be near them to draw near to them and present yourself to their disposal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether to unrighteousness or to righteousness, either way works the same. And whoever you yield to, that's you'll be their servant. &gt;&gt; To place a person or thing at one's disposal, to present a person for another to see and to question. actually, oh there's so much going through my mind, but actually the the bride of Jesus Christ has been put on display. God has actually presenting the bride. Now, we're not only presented to to to Christ, but we've been also risen here in this s generation and presented to the world because God will judge the world by the word that is being lived out in the body of Jesus Christ. That's good. &gt;&gt; In Acts, the scripture says of Jesus, to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion. See, now he presented himself. Jesus Christ, after his resurrection, after his passion and his suffering, now he's resurrected. Isn't this the most marvelous moment in history? Christ God who walked in flesh now has risen and the spirit of God has raised him from the dead. He didn't go to the governments of the world. He didn't go to the Sanhedrin. He didn't and the scripture says to whom to whom there was just a certain ones to whom he showed himself. In other words, there he is. This magnificent uh uh completion of redemption has happened. And now who's he going to present himself to? He's actually going to present himself. And he presented himself to this one, to the ladies, &gt;&gt; to the to on the way to Emmas. He's presenting himself. Here I am. I'm alive. I'm resurrected. Death is death is defeated. I'm here. To whom? And I say, "Oh God, of those billions of people that are on the face of the earth today, the same Jesus Christ still." To whom, oh, who it is, who is it, Lord, that you're &gt;&gt; you're manifesting yourself? Who is it &gt;&gt; that you're making yourself known? Who is it you're presenting yourself to? &gt;&gt; We are privileged people. I trust that you can sense and do sense that it's none other than Jesus Christ. And remember, he was missed then, almost missed, but he continued with them until they recognized who he was. &gt;&gt; He showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them 40 days. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not being seen of everybody, being seen of them. You know, this is an exclusive club. A lot of people don't like that, but it is an exclusive club. It doesn't exclude necessarily. We are not excluded. We're not excluding anybody. But you can only come in by a birth. You can only come in by a revelation. And that is sovereign of almighty God. &gt;&gt; We don't have any choosing over that. God. It's elective love is what it is. Now to yield also as I said earlier to stand beside or to stand near but it's also further to stand by for the purpose to help or to suck to be at one's aid and that is why Jesus when he was getting ready to depart he said to the disciples I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter and And and the word for yield begins with p a r i or par perah and that is the one is beside. He is one that is your aid. And and the word for the comforter is pariclete one that moves beside you one that comes near to you. And so he said I'll pray the father and he shall give you another comforter. I've been beside you, but now here's another one. He's going to be beside you. I'm leaving. And if I don't go, he can't come. &gt;&gt; But he will be your comforter. He will be your advocate. He is summoned to be your aid. &gt;&gt; He's summoned to be beside you. Listen, friends, God has summoned. He's caused his Holy Spirit to come and be near to you. &gt;&gt; Not distant, but near to you, &gt;&gt; to stand near to you. He's one that pleads another's case, an intercessor before a judge or a counsel or a defense. And that's why Paul said also in Romans 8:34, "Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died. Who is it that condemns? Who's got a pointing finger of condemnation? It's Christ that died. Yay. Rather, that is risen again. Who is even at the right hand of God. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe he's at the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; Who also maketh intercession. Not just standing there. He's making intercessions for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right now, this morning, he hasn't left. He hasn't departed. He's there making intercession for us. And the very spirit of God is not only with us but in us. He has been brought near to us. Not one that's far. He's a paraclete brought close to us as an advocate, as your counsel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To advise you. But now if we don't yield to him, then he isn't able to defend us. We need to yield be yielding to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit at your side. I thought this was really I was blessed when I wrote this down. The Holy Spirit at your side and Jesus Christ at the right hand of the Majesty on high making intercession for you. How can you lose? I that's a winning that's a winning case, isn't it? &gt;&gt; To yield in the spiritual sense is usually considered as giving a favorable response to the Holy Spirit in a service. That's what we think of it most often to be in agreement in our heart and soul with what God is doing or saying. That's been I think that has been probably the most common understanding to yield. Well, just you know and I think I want to take the mystery out of it for a lot of people because some say, "Well, how do I yield? How do I yield? What is it I'm to yield to? Is something happening right now in the service? Am I supposed to yield?" Well, I believe that yielding involves a uh whatever seems to be the order of the service. I believe that we should be attentive. I believe we should be deeply respectful. And I'm going to go into those if you will just bear with me and give me your time as I uh lay this foundation. Now, in the Old Testament, you can write it down, but I'd like you just I'm just going to read the verse in Leviticus 1 and5. It says, "And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord, and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood and sprinkle the blood around upon the altar and by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation." Now, I'm just building this thought. You shall do this. You shall take the bullock before the Lord and the Aaron's sons shall bring the blood. And the word bring is they shall present the blood. Now, it wasn't just that, oh well, I think I'll take it in this kind of a canister. I'll take it in this kind of a container. God had a set program and as they moved in that program, they shall kill a bullock. It wasn't another animal. It was a bullock. &gt;&gt; So, as they began, they're already yielding. See what I mean? &gt;&gt; They have nothing to present until they begin to yield. But they're already yielding. They're taking a certain animal. Has to be a certain kind of an animal. Has to be killed a certain way. And certain ones have to take the blood. And Aaron does this and his sons do that. And then they will bring that in. And of course when when they have yielded and done these things and then they presented the blood to God, of course it was acceptable. &gt;&gt; And the people had all kinds of failings. &gt;&gt; We all do. People had all kinds of things hanging on them, but when they followed through with those things and presented it to God, their sins were covered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we have, we've heard a certain uh message, we've heard a certain word, we heard a certain things that we need to do. And as we yield to that, we come before God and what a glorious thing. Say, I could just do do a few things in approaching to God. And God says, "If I repent, turn around, have a change of mind, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, I shall receive the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; What a wonderful conclusion for a little bit of obedience. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a marvelous benefit &gt;&gt; for a little bit of obedience. &gt;&gt; And when you're ob obeying, you're yielding. Neither yield or present your members. A member, this may sound very elementary, but a member can be a limb of your body, a member of the human body. So neither yield your members. I'm yielding my members now to you and yielding them to God. And if I didn't feel that I was yielding them to the Holy Spirit, I wouldn't be here. As one morning, I'd sooner be at home and be resting. But I felt I had this on my heart. I was even asked, "Do you really feel you want to preach?" I said, "Yeah, I do because I have something on my heart. I'm yielding my lips. I'm yielding my mouth. I'm yielding my tongue. I'm yielding my mind. I'm yielding my energy. I'm yielding whatever I can to God at this time that he may deliver &gt;&gt; whatever he wants the people to hear &gt;&gt; as an instrument. And the instrument can be a weapon or any tool for preparing a thing. And I believe we're preparing something. We're preparing a people for a rapture. I'm preparing you for what battle you may have tomorrow or what you may face yet this afternoon. We're getting ready. &gt;&gt; We're hearing the word. &gt;&gt; We're being alerted. We're being taught. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We must never underestimate the power of it. You hear it, it drops into your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and the Holy Spirit will bring it to your attention by remembrance when you need it. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the plan of God. And so we yield our members as instruments. I want you to notice an instrument can be a weapon for good. It can be a weapon also for evil. David said in the Psalms, "My soul is among lions, and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword." So he had people around him whose mouth was fixed to do him damage, and their tongue was like a sword. He said, "They're around them. I sleep amongst them. They're around me." He said in Psalm 64, "Who wet who wet wh their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words." That was David's experience. A man after God's own heart. I can tell you those fellas didn't get much of reward. They didn't get any reward from God. &gt;&gt; This was God's friend. But just because we're sons and daughters of God doesn't mean that someone won't whip their sword &gt;&gt; and have their teeth sharpened and to grind out words that are painful on you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's good. God doesn't God doesn't promise us a life of ease as such. And if someone, you know, if someone uh yields themselves that way, so be it. That's their reward. In Proverbs, it says, "There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every one of you that are here, we have that instrument called a tongue. Oh my. And it can set a world on fire. &gt;&gt; James says so much about it. Here's the word of God. Even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth. And the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity. So is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setth on fire the course of nature and is set on fire of hell. I say one thing to this waiting congregation today. If there's any member of our body that should be yielded and presented to God, it's this one right here. And we ought to dedicate ourselves and say, I am going to yield my tongue to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It is a weapon. It's an instrument. And it's can be a powerful weapon. I can build up or I can tear down. I can speak victory. I can speak defeat. I can I can energize people with faith or I can bring doubt. I can bring a sunshine upon their life. Or I can bring a cloud. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can encourage or I can criticize whatever. And I say we need to yield the tongue to the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, presenting oneself is to place a person or a thing at one's disposal. That was yielding or presenting. yielding or presenting, same word, presenting oneself. We've had a number of brothers here in the congregation that have been in the Marines. And the Marines is a, you know, very, very uh well-known, proud, and I don't say that in a bad way. They're very, very, they go through very strict training. And uh I was just talking to brother Dalton while he was here visiting and he was talking about the boys in Iraq and in the compound that he lives I think it's 12 miles square something like that and he said in that heat which is in Celsius over 40° and maybe like 120 degrees outside he said those boys those soldiers those Marines with full pack and he said the kind of the kind of suits and the outfits they have are almost air airtight, he said. And they go with full pack perhaps with 90 pounds or maybe more, I don't know. And he says they run for five miles. They'll run around the perimeter of that thing. And he says, "Come back." He said, "I don't even know how they can begin to do it. I don't He said, "I can hardly move in that kind of heat, but they have to get out there and they have to they have to do that cuz they're Marines. They're US Marines." Now, they didn't get that way. They were some raw recruits &gt;&gt; like some of you young fellows that are here. I'm glad I'm away. I'm glad I I got God just arranged. I tell you what, I know that things are absolutely divine. God just had me birth just I was just too early for one war and too late for the next one. I said, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; But you go, I've seen pictures of those Marines and just when they're standing there, you know, their Adam's apple kind of protruding out, young guy, two, three hairs on it, you know, and just standing there and just as green and raw as can be, and standing there, boy, they don't know what's coming. They don't know what's coming. And that sergeant that looks so nice, they don't know he's got a heavy voice, a lot heavier than mine. He's going to be screaming at them in a few minutes and telling them what to do and telling them what for and everything else and and they're presenting themselves. And I can tell you their life's just about to change &gt;&gt; because they're already soon as they soon as they joined up or soon as they accepted say, "I want to be in the Marines." Yeah. And they stood there. You know what they you know what that first act was? Yielding. &gt;&gt; They presented themselves and they began to yield. And from that moment on, they didn't have any thought. &gt;&gt; They couldn't have any decision who they wanted to stand beside. &gt;&gt; They didn't have any decision where they're sleeping or what they wear. &gt;&gt; You wear that. &gt;&gt; And this is the weapon you carry. and this is where you're going to serve and this is what you're going to do and this is and and this is your food. This is what you're going to eat and don't say anything about it. &gt;&gt; You're in the Marines now. &gt;&gt; Eat those dead dry crackers or whatever it is. It's good for you. Whatever. I don't know. You know, I do know cuz when I was on and living in the US Army camps, uh I we had some of those raations. They called them dog biscuits. And I'll tell you what, they were indeed they were, you know, well, I won't say any more about that, but I didn't find anything. I never ate a Kration or never ate one of those rations where I wanted to go back and have another bite. Never once. Dried eggs and powdered milk. Yuck and yuck. It's all I can say. It was just terrible. Absolutely terrible. I don't know why an army that you know a government wants to have an army. Why don't feed the boys on good food? But I guess it's all part of the program. But when you present yourself to the Marines, when you present yourself to God, you essentially lose your identity. God's going to tell you who your brother is. God's going to tell you who your sister is. God's going to tell you who you fellowship with. God's going to tell you who you shake hands with. God's going to tell you everything. God's going to tell you what you eat and he's going to tell you what you don't eat. God's going to tell you how to dress and how not to dress. He's going to give you the outfit. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you presented yourself and said, I feel something moving. I feel uh a conviction and you present. Do you desire this? Yes, I do. I have to desire. At that moment, you're yielding. And from that time on, he's the he's the captain of the host. Hallelujah. He tells us how to walk. He tells us how to march. He tells us where to live. He tells us how far to go and where we can't go. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; You getting my point now? And you must surrender your personal views. I say, "You know what, Sergeant? I grew up in the wilderness. This how I use a gun." He say, "Forget it. We're going to tell you how to hold a gun." Well, I I think we ought to have a bigger bullet or a smaller bullet. He says, "Shut up. You don't have anything to say about this." Isn't that right, Brother Derek? &gt;&gt; Is that about the way it is? You didn't have any choice of what size of gun or bullet or anything else. They tell you what you're going to God tells you. There will be certain scriptures. There'll be certain things that'll be real to one person, not real to you. But God gives you the ammunition. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going to fight. He knows what you're going to face and he'll give you what you have need of. And there is no temptation. There is nothing that can overcome the believer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll give you the equipment. &gt;&gt; He's the one who's called you into this. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you must surrender up your personal views, your likes, your dislikes, your personal preferences to the rigor of Marine training. If you're going to be a real soldier, you're required to live under the strictest of schedule and obey all orders. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All orders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to work alongside and in perfect harmony with the other Marines. I'm sure they have all kinds of character uh uh you know conflicts and personality conflicts. If that's in the Marines and we're in the army of God, &gt;&gt; we cannot tolerate they can't tolerate it for just a a warfare to to do what? I don't know. We're in a warfare against the powers of darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we deny and defy any enemy that tries to do anything to hinder the people of God from reaching their objective. &gt;&gt; I say victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't die to see me defeated. He didn't die to see you graveling on the ground. He died that you can have victory in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are victorious and you will be victorious if you're not victorious. &gt;&gt; Another thing in the Marines, I've never been to the Marines, but any of you fellas that have been, you can come and tell me, correct me if I'm wrong, but I've been around enough of you. You have to respect every officer. &gt;&gt; You forget to salute. I don't care whether he's a corporal or a sergeant or what he is. You forget to salute. Listen here, boy. You salute when I walk by. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right now, &gt;&gt; not well. Hi there. Hi, Sarge. How are you today? Smarten up. You click your heels. You snap to attention because you've been trained to do that. &gt;&gt; How did all that happen? Oh, one day you walked in as green as a grass of Wyoming in your old clothes and they say, "Go in there, take all those clothes off, get a bath, and have a shave and cut your hair, and we'll look after you from here on out." You're a Marine, and you just gave yourself to it. But if you didn't give yourself to it, you'd never be that fighting man out in the front lines. And I say, my brother, my sister, when we came and we gave ourselves, we presented ourselves to God, we we didn't come here for a picnic. &gt;&gt; We didn't come here for that kind of a thing. We came here to be a soldier. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I can't stand anything that's a wishy-washy dish rag and no stamina, no background, no convictions. I said, "Ah, forget it. Give me men and women to stand for the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those of you that you're not in any army or service of that kind, but you studied for a prof a profession, you maybe thought it over and said, "This is kind of thing. I'll give myself to this profession. I'll give myself to this business or whatever more or to this job and you presented yourself. Bunch you here are bus drivers and different different kinds of work. You presented yourself and now they tell you they begin to tell you what to do, what your schedule is and so on so forth. And there's degrees of of uh the amount of control. But you must give yourself you presented yourself. Then you give of your time. You surrender up your family time. You surrender up private and pleasure time. You surrender up in many cases God's time. But it all started with yielding. You had to yield and present yourself. You presented yourself. And that's my whole lesson this morning. You presented yourself. And that is a form of yielding. The same word in the Bible. I'm just emphasizing it not because I think you're dull mentally, but because I want to really establish it. As believers, we present our bodies, the Bible says, a living sacrifice. Now, sacrifice doesn't give a pleasant connotation. Sacrifice is something that is expended. We are to give ourselves, yield ourselves, present ourselves to God. As far as I'm concerned, and I'll say it flat out, just coming here to church on Wednesday and on Sunday, that's not that's has nothing to do with presenting our bodies. &gt;&gt; I believe we present our bodies to God &gt;&gt; as a living sacrifice &gt;&gt; every hour of the day, &gt;&gt; every day of the week. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We present ourselves and by presenting ourselves, we are already commencement to yielding ourselves. God called for Moses and Joshua to present themselves. Now, I'm coming on more onto a spiritual side. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Behold, thy days approach that thou must die. call Joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that I may give him a charge. There is a there is a purpose to this. You come and present yourselves. &gt;&gt; And soon as they did, Moses called Joshua. We're called of God. We're to go into the tabernacle and into the congregation that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. To present themselves, once again, as I said, is to stand or to present oneselves. Present your bodies a living sacrifice. And God also called Moses, when all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose, which God shall choose. Thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. There's a plan. There's a program that God has set out. You shall come. You shall present yourselves. But once the people have presented themselves, thou shalt declare the word of God to the people, that's my solemn responsibility this morning. &gt;&gt; When the people come, you haven't just come to attend a service. You've come now and presented yourself before God. And now it's God's duty and it's my charge or any minister standing here. It is his duty to declare the word of God. And then it's the people's duty to take that and yield themselves to that. &gt;&gt; And that's the that's the really the way it's supposed to operate. &gt;&gt; Gather the people together. God said to Moses, "Men and women and children." I'm glad we're here. Men and women and children. Let the people say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Men and women and children. All say amen. &gt;&gt; We are here. gather them together and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the Lord your God and observe to do all the words of his law. You go back to the just back when I was demonstrating uh of the soldier and the marines. That's what he does. He comes and presents himself. And you present yourself and the first thing you're going to do, you're going to hear something. And where you're going to obey it and you're going to learn some things that you never knew before. You're going to learn how to conduct yourself. You're going to learn how to respect yourself. You're going to learn how to respect your officers. You're going to learn how to how to uh h how to handle equipment you've never handled before. I've never driven a tank. You're going to learn. &gt;&gt; I don't know how to fly a jet. You're going to learn. See, and you give yourself to it because you stood there one day and presented yourself. And then finally, when that program comes to an end, you're a a select few of the entire people, but you have a charge. Protect the country. Protect your government and and you're loyal and you're gallant and you're brave. It takes a lot for a young man, young woman to say, "I'm here to protect my country, and if it costs my life, so be it. And thousands of them say it and many thousands have given their lives for it. They they've said that and I think that's an honorable thing that they've had to do that. They But it all started one day as a green green recruit standing there. One day we were that green recruit. &gt;&gt; One day we may have been at an altar. One day it might have been it might have been in camp. It might have been some other place. What are we doing now? We're getting trained up. We're hearing we're hearing some officers. We're hearing some that have been through a few wars. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To make the way to show you how to defend yourself. And I'll tell you, there's no army like the army of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only present yourself, but thou shalt read this law before the people, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and that they may fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of the law. I just want to start now with presenting ourselves. And I'll just begin with presenting our lips, our tongue and our mouth to praise and worship. &gt;&gt; Sometime I observe, I don't want to be negative, but sometime I observed in people are really caught in worship. And there's a percentage of the people that they have no they have no understanding and no concept whatsoever that I've come here to worship. And they have no concept that these lips belong to God. &gt;&gt; My mom and dad didn't give me these lips. God gave them to me. &gt;&gt; God gave me the tongue. God gave me the life. God gave me this brain. Whatever whatever level of intelligence we have and it doesn't take a whole lot. And the scripture says, and here's a number of them just quickly. There are so many. Because thy loving kindness is better than life. How many will agree with that? &gt;&gt; Because thy loving kindness is better than life. Thy loving kindness is better than life. The next praise is my lips shall praise thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's not just the odd amen here and there. My lips shall praise thee because your loving kindness is better than life. I don't know how to sing. Well, just make a sound. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, praise be to God because your loving kindness is better than life. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I I I've never done that." Start doing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You won't scare me. Amen. &gt;&gt; David said again, "My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. My mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not somebody been baptized in grapefruit juice. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody who's all soured up. This is somebody who's rejoicing in the things that God has done. They got their focus on the right on the right things. &gt;&gt; They're thinking on the right things. &gt;&gt; Is this the word of God? &gt;&gt; Because I love in kindness. It's better than life. My lips shall praise you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe the people of God need to praise God. &gt;&gt; And if there's ever any people that ought to praise him, it's the believers of this message. You are a privileged people of the whole earth. The prophet said, "You're the Exodus people." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Paul says in Hebrews, "By him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise." The sacrifice of praise to God. The sacrifice indicates that maybe you don't want to do it. You don't feel like doing it. you you had a bad morning and Satan really tried to get on your case this morning. Don't let him rob your Lord of what belongs to him. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I made up a certain way. I made up quiet." Well, you can thank your mother and father for that, but you've been made up another way from God himself. &gt;&gt; And don't go by your first natural birth. go by your spiritual birth and my soul says I want to thank God. &gt;&gt; I want to worship you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't boast if I were you that you managed to get out of this meeting without saying praise the Lord. That wouldn't be a good record. &gt;&gt; I say something started to move in my heart &gt;&gt; and I just begin to realize I need to surrender my members to God. &gt;&gt; I need to even offer the sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; You don't feel like it, but you do it anyway. You offer the sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; You'll do him an honor. &gt;&gt; Glory. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord and let all flesh bless his holy name. Hello flesh. &gt;&gt; Hello flesh. Let all flesh bless his holy name. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna have the musicians here in a few minutes if I don't watch out. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord. Ezra at a at a certain time and at the evening sacrifice I rose up from my heaviness. Hello. I rose up from my heaviness. Somebody's here is heavy. I rose up from my heaviness. &gt;&gt; And having rent my garment &gt;&gt; in humility, I rent my garment and my mantle. I fell on my knees and I spread out my hands unto the Lord my God. Why did he do that? Because it was indicative of what was going on inside. I fell on my knees and I spread out my hands to my God. There's nothing wrong with raising up your hands at my God. I give you praise. Hallelujah. I'll fall on my knees at an appropriate moment. I lift up my hands unto the Lord. I worship him. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you don't want to do it, let me take your reward. I'll do it again. Praise be to God.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David said, "My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments. I'll lift up my hands as to your commandments which I have loved and I will meditate in their statutes. He said, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice." Oh, let my prayers be as incense and let my hands be lifted up at the evening sacrifice. telling what's going on in the heart. &gt;&gt; I stretch forth my hands unto thee, David said, and my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land. Look at what people surrender themselves to in the world. how unreservedly they give themselves &gt;&gt; and all of their energy and all of their training and all of their sports activity and and the people in the stands. I mean, if you go to see an NBA uh ball game or uh a football game or uh one of these other sports games, the people, they don't just sit there and say, "Well, you know, well, you know, well, you know, made a touchdown." They're they're yelling and screaming and come out of there with no voice and and over what? &gt;&gt; Over a pig skin full of air. &gt;&gt; It's just unbelievable. Unbelievable. And here we gather and we have eternal life. I I'm not going to pump you up. You got to have that in you. I'll lift up my hands to God. I'll give glory to God. Let Let the redeemed say so. Hallelujah. Let the redeemed say so. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I need a musician. &gt;&gt; I need a musician. I need somebody at the piano. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. If anybody ask you who I am, tell them I'm redeemed. Glory to God. I got to sing a song. I got to tell the world. We got to tell the people on the internet and whoever may hear this service, I'm redeemed. I'm redeemed. I'm saved by the blood of the lamb. I'll lift up my hands as a sacrifice to God. I'm redeemed. Hallelujah. Let's just sing that one. Redeemed. Oh yes, I am good. Oh my Jesus, change my life. Oh, if anybody asks you just who I am, oh then tell them I am redeemed. Make it as a confession now.

[Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessings and honor, praise, majesty. Our Lord, glory. Have your seats for a few more moments, please. And let the musicians just stay where they are. [Music] There was a man by the name of Cornelius in the New Testament. He was a gentile and uh he called for Peter. God spoke to him said send for one Peter. Peter came and the Bible says that Cornelius fell down at Peter's feet and worshiped him. &gt;&gt; Now to worship the man is not right. It's wrong. However, his action expressed his deep respect for what he was expecting from the messenger of God. And Peter said to him and as Peter was coming, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. And Peter said, "I'm a man also. Don't worship me." But Cornelius and all of his house were saved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'd say that it it it it represented something in him. And John, the apostle John, when he began to see the things that the angel was showing him in Revelation 22:8, "And I, John, saw these things and I heard them. And when I heard them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things. And the angel said, "See thou do it not, for I'm of thy brethren the prophets, &gt;&gt; and I keep the sayings of these books." But it showed how overcome John had become from what he was seeing and the atmosphere he was in. My brother, my sister, we need to come to the house of God expecting more than we ever had before. expecting expecting something more than we've seen. How do we limit God? Don't limit God. All things are possible. Glory to God. When I when I hear the supernatural, when I hear Sister Debbie Lowry's uh examination and the MRI and not being able to find the aneurysm, I just say, "It's just another one. Just another one. Why not? Why not? Why should we have another one? supernatural things happening. We all should expect it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say it with everything that's in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With everything that's in me. I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; We present ourselves. We present ourselves in conversation. Yes. &gt;&gt; When we begin to speak to somebody, we need to measure our words because our our conduct and the way we present ourselves in conversation. Paul said to Timothy, "Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Be thou an example to the believers." He's a young man, but it's for all of us. Be an example in word. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In conversation, &gt;&gt; in charity, that is in love, in spirit, &gt;&gt; pure spirit, in faith, and in purity, till I come. Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine. Hallelujah. In other words, you've been called into the army of the Lord. You've been called into this great family. You give yourself to reading, to exhortation, to prayer, and and and be an example. Don't let another one drag you down. S be an example. &gt;&gt; You know something? I'm so glad that we as believers have the message that we have so that we can live the standard that God has given us to live. &gt;&gt; It to me, it's a great privilege. It's a great privilege that God has endowed us with that he he has entrusted us with to be the example of this generation. &gt;&gt; Just wait a moment now. Says, "How can I overcome? Just give me about another 10 minutes. I'm going to just beat it down." Says, "Now don't struggle." He said, "Now him that willth," it's not him that wth or him that runth, but God. He said just let God just yield yourself in him. Now this isn't how I can overcome. And three times he says it and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he's able to perform. Not joining one denomination or another. Not even joining this church or some other church and running this that or the other but and trying this. He said just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful, quiet, not interrupted. Just keep on walking with him. That's right. You just yield to him. And you can't yield. The first thing of yielding is presenting yourself. &gt;&gt; When you walk in these doors at the next service, which is tonight, when you walk in the meeting, say, "I've come here to present myself &gt;&gt; to God." &gt;&gt; And in so doing, I'm already yielding &gt;&gt; to the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And whatever you shall direct in this meeting, here I am, Lord. &gt;&gt; What would you have me to do? What kind of an example would you have me to be? There was a brother that had actually had a breakdown. Sound like a nervous breakdown. And brother Brandham had just talked to him. You know what he told a man that just had a nervous breakdown? Just yield to God. &gt;&gt; That was a solution. You say, "I'm at the end of myself. I'm just at the end of my wits. I just don't know what I'm going to do. I feel like I'm coming apart." Yield. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just yield to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In appearance, in our appearance, in our conduct, our appearance, a woman has been entrusted with a sacred trust for life and redemption. Characteristics that must not be broken or violated. By yielding to the spirit of Eden, she's enticed to present or yield her members to the direction of that spirit, which in turn causes her to be defiled. &gt;&gt; Now, that was a big statement. But now, here's what brother Brandham has said. She has now I'm talking about presenting themselves because I couldn't even begin to get to it. You know, when Jesus was here, he said these words and some here I was just speaking to the other night. You'll recall that's why it was on my mind when Jesus was asked concerning marriage and divorce and so on. says and then he he said but I say unto you said for the saving for the cause of fornication but divorce was granted on a on on aa case of fornication which was premarital sexual relationship. Brother Brandham says Jesus said then but I say unto you he that lookth on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her in her in his heart already. So when Jesus was here, he essentially condemned the entire mankind because throughout the man's lifetime, he's going to commit that kind of a that kind of a transgression for sure. But the women were dressing appropriately at that time. The women did not dress as they dress today. They all had their long gowns and so on. And you can read in the Bible, you can hear you can read of a a a widow's garment and you can read of a harlot's garment, but that's all that's about all you read about. But in this day, then it's the same Jesus Christ coming in this time, &gt;&gt; revealing himself and speaking his words through his messengergers's mouth. &gt;&gt; And so now he takes it a step further. And I want to say I want to be very very uh uh listening very closely now. So now he says he says and he quotes the same scripture. If a man looks on a woman to lust after he has committed adultery with her in his heart, that's what God sees, &gt;&gt; right? But he says, "But if you presented yourself, &gt;&gt; if you presented yourself," he says, "you'll be the guilty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You'll be guilty." And and and and I begin to realize when a person, man or woman, but this is a woman's age and it's a woman's nation. And now sisters, you just listen closely. When a a a woman begins to present herself, say, "I'm putting on a certain garment and whatever more." But who are you presenting that to? &gt;&gt; You see, who are you presenting it? And you are already in the stage of yielding. &gt;&gt; Already beginning to yield. Says, "I'll put on this and say, well, what is it?" that. Well, brother Bram talked about uh and too many times for me to even get into being poured in &gt;&gt; and when you look in a mirror, just stand in the mirror and just say, "Do I look like I'm poured into this?" &gt;&gt; And if it looks like you're poured into it, then I would discard it. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't take a whole lot of intelligence. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, is that on your subject?" That's absolutely on my subject because because God has sent a word to protect you &gt;&gt; from committing some horrible sins and transgressions and say, "Well, you know, I wasn't told or I have such so much trouble." Everybody, especially the women, I feel so sorry because they go to the go to the uh racks in the stores and whatever more and this is all they have. All they have is some tops that are like socks. They're like just skin tight things and so on. and and uh uh pretty well uh sleeveless. You know, another word that Brother Bram uses, he uses the word strip tease. And I thought I would look into that. And this is what the strip tease, this is what the word means, a gradual, graceful disroing of a female performer. And of course, the streets are full of it today. It's been gradual. Brother Brandham talked about Clarabo. I showed her a picture up here some time ago. A very very early uh woman that Satan used and and he actually said it kind of started with Clara Bo. Uh he said and they had a song and it was uh uh the song was uh something about you know show your knees giries or something like that. It's a famous song and brother Brandham says he talked about censorship but he says but that was the first one they let through. And I thought that was so amazing. That was the first one that they let through. And I I I went onto the internet and I found a a woman's a really a putter forward of feminist things and she revers refers right back to that and talks about that's where it started. And here a prophet of God is telling us that's where it started. &gt;&gt; So will you give me some time while I just read? I'm talking about yielding &gt;&gt; and there this is what happens now. I'm not talking about godly godly sisters. There's a sister that's not here. And uh I've always thought a sister Jen Johnson, they're away on vacation. Sister Jen Johnson, a young lady amongst us. She's always dressed so admirable, so Christian-like, and always I always thought that. I thought one day I'd even say something, but I didn't want to embarrass her, and so I never did say it. There's others do as well. But I feel sorry for our young ladies that have to go and be subjected, and I mean subjected. And now listen to me. That's been a whole army, the hordes of hell. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want one of those designers that designed the very clothes that is hanging on the rack to have dinner with you today. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want You talk about perverted. You talk about demonpossessed. You talk about designing things and Satan himself is just he he's he's engineering that because he wants you to yield your member, &gt;&gt; members of your body that God has given for womanhood, for motherhood, but he wants to throw it out &gt;&gt; to the gaze of every lustful demon in hell and every man in the country. And here's God's great soldier, warrior, or prophet trying to warn his people. Don't come and stand before God as an adulteress. And that word is there to protect you. &gt;&gt; That word is there to actually uh to to actually deliver you. &gt;&gt; And I know a incredible struggle. It is &gt;&gt; incredible struggle. Let me just read some, please. And you know, I didn't really want to speak this morning because of my I'm just not really well, but I felt so pressed. So, I want you to know I really felt urged with this. &gt;&gt; In invisible union, he says she has a sacred trust, a virtue committed to her by her Lord, a certain virtue. All sisters, you have a sacred trust, a certain virtue committed to you by her, Lord, a certain virtue. Nothing else holds it but a woman. That's right. He said, "And that's committed to her by God. And she must not defile that virtue. Even if she does something wrong, she must confess that to her husband before he takes her and make it right." Continuing on in paragraph 14, notice now he says she has a sacred trust of virtue that's been given to her, trusted to her by the Lord. God gave her that virtue just as it was in the Garden of Eden. She can say yes or no. She has a sacred trust of womanhood committed to her and she must not break the womanhood. He says I'm speaking of here. He says, "And is her conduct, her character around men, not letting every man look on these screens and see how these movie stars and kissing and hugging and slopping over around uh over these women." He said, "A woman does that is of a bad character. She might be virtuous otherwise, but see in her heart when those glands, he talks about sex glands in the lips and a man kiss a woman, he's actually potentially committing adultery." And then invisible union of the bride again. Uh he says, "Now we find out that she has been given this sacred trust that she must not break of womanhood. Uh have her character, raise her children, be honorable to her husband." And nowadays they pay no more uh not a bit of attention to it than anything in the world. And he swore by himself. I'm reading a number of quotes here I want to just get done. He said, "There's a lot of women here, and the woman is a marvelous thing. If God could have give a man anything better than a woman, he'd have done so." But he he gave a woman. See, show you what's in my heart. Before I came to the pulpit today, and I wasn't thinking about these particular things, but I thought, well, you know, you arrive at certain stations in your life, and I thank God for my wife. I thank God for my wife. Every man that's got a godly wife ought to thank God for her. That's a gift that's been sent directly from the throne of God. You thank God for that kind of a woman. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the godly women of this congregation. I thank God for you young people that that uh display yourself in a godly manner. And if God is speaking you through the message this morning, just say, "Here I am, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "There's a lot of women here." And he was speaking in Jeffersonville. And the woman's marvelous thing. He goes on, he said, "But this is a woman's world. She's running." Can you believe this is 1954? That was the year I was married. And if you'd have told me then it was a woman's world, I couldn't have hardly believed it. But here he is speaking speaking with a uh with a prophet's character. He's speaking ahead of his time. He said it's a woman's world. She's running the whole thing. Not you house mothers here, but I mean out in the world. And he said, "Let some little strip tease out in Hollywood, excuse me, out in Hollywood start to cut her hair some way." not just cut her hair, but cut her hair some way and watch all the girls cut their hair the same way. Or they start some fad in dress and watch all the girls do the same thing. Christians and all so-called That's right. It's a woman's world. Now, I just want to I want to say something here. It's not a major part of the message, but it's an important part of the message that you you go to the shop, you go to the store, whatever. You don't know where that originated. But most of that stuff in there, I'm talking about the whole cosmetic industry. I'm talking about what you use for your hair, it all started in Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Some woman in Hollywood, she'll do her hair a certain kinky way and all the rest of it, and pretty soon you just see it everywhere. &gt;&gt; But you need to know just where did it start? Well, what should I be? What should I be, brother Bisc? What should I be? Just just be the way God made you. &gt;&gt; Just just thank God that God made you the way that you are and be nice and be pretty and and and so on. But when you go to present yourself, you have to be very very careful and under God be, you know, ask God to give you a whole sense of of intelligence about spiritual things. And when you when you stand before the mirror, men and women, we need to know we're not here to get muscles to impress somebody. &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to get and work out and going to get muscle bound here so we can go down the street and display our members. &gt;&gt; So some woman look at that say, "Oh, you know, what a hunk." That's about all it is. &gt;&gt; Just a hunk as far as God sees. God just sees worms &gt;&gt; going through that body. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "You see some attractive woman walking down the street." He says, "Just remember in 24 hours be worms just going through her body. &gt;&gt; Skin worms." &gt;&gt; It's in the body. They don't inject them in, but they'll eat it up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For a word is protecting word. &gt;&gt; And I thought, you know, they some some woman will do something and she's some new star. She wears a certain kind of a garment at some stage of her life, whatever it might be, and the next thing you know, it's plastered all over the papers, plastered all over the magazines. It's at the cash counter where you shop. It's right there. They got all those, you know, the People magazine and the starlets and all all the rest of people, all fallen stars. &gt;&gt; And but they're there. What are they there for? Catch your eye. Look, say, "Oh, that that hairdo." You know what I mean? And then uh you know a Max Factor or somebody else will produce a certain kind of gel so you can get it kinkedked up a certain kind of a way and get and then I see I see the fellas today. Excuse me. I'm not being critical but I see the fellas today and I thought man I wish I had a good fast lawn mower so I could cut that top off and then just really straighten his hair out. See you know all up there you know I mean they must work to make it that messy. They must really work at it. How do you How do you make it that messy? &gt;&gt; And that's the thing. I thought, "This guy just crawled out of a log. He'd been there all winter. Poor man. I should give him my comb. Maybe he like to comb his hair." No. Might be a little bit humorous, but that's what it is. &gt;&gt; What made the poor soul do that? &gt;&gt; Somebody else did it. &gt;&gt; Some idol did it. And so he's doing it and he's just following along. &gt;&gt; Maybe we're just oldfashioned. &gt;&gt; But give me the oldfashioned way. &gt;&gt; The strip tees in Hollywood becomes the strip tease on the street, in the workplace, in the school, and in the church. That's what happens because that's where it started. It started there. It went into the stores and into the shops, ended up on the street. It's in the home. It's in the school. And that's the thing. And that's all that's all you have. You just see what's around you. And when you go there to buy, there isn't hardly anything you can buy. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, men don't have that struggle so much. But I'll just give you I'll give you Do you want a little exercise? Go down to Willoughbrook here and walk the entire place or go down to Bellisfair. I haven't been Bellisar for years, but go down and you go down to these big shopping centers. I think there's 255 stores or something in a Willoughbrook. Just walk down there and count how many ladies shops there are and how many men's shops there are. And by the time you're done, you'll be thankful your men are even dressed. That we actually found a store to shop in. There's maybe two or three. And there's dozens of women's shops. &gt;&gt; And what is it? Oh, it's the latest this. It's the latest color. It's the latest something else. The latest something else. And I'll tell you what, it's been designed by demons. &gt;&gt; That's just the simplicity of it. And then and then what it is, you can be sure as as as the prophet spoke it, it's been the gradual &gt;&gt; disroing &gt;&gt; of her body &gt;&gt; until I'm ashamed to take men that come from overseas ministers to some of our restaurants. They have good food but dreadful waitresses. &gt;&gt; And the ladies are lovely, young, beautiful women. But Satan has enticed them &gt;&gt; and they have yielded to expose their members and stand before God as prostitutes. &gt;&gt; And you're able to hear, you and I are able to hear a word that will bring us from that and protect us from that. And that is why we should open our lips and open our mouth and say, "Thank God that you've kept me from that. Thank God for the word that you've given me." What a protection it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of it, both men and women. And I'm closing in just a moment. In serpent seat, he said, "So look here. If their grandmother was a chorus girl and her mother was a flapper, what's she today? A rock and roll strip tease. &gt;&gt; What's her ch What's her children going to be? &gt;&gt; And you say, "Does God do that?" Yes, sir. God visits the iniquity of the children, the generation even to 14 generations. This thing didn't start here. &gt;&gt; It it started a long time ago. And and you see what what some of those women back there, listen, some of these some of these uh women, they don't even don't even know what they're going to I wish I had something here. I forgot to get it printed for you. But some this one woman wrote about Clarabo and she mentioned another woman and she said and this woman had and this girl said had lovely thick long braids, blond braids. And she said to her, "Daddy, I'm going to cut my hair. I'm going to cut this off." That was just at the beginning. And this is way back in the very early 1900s. I'm going to cut my hair. He said, "Don't you dare." And this woman was this woman was writing about another woman and she said, "But this this other girl said,"I going to cut my hair." And she went and cut her hair. And her daddy just said, "Well, that's cute." That's all he said. And and she was expecting a great big ruckus in the home over because she had beautiful, beautiful long hair. And then and then they began to talk about the song of Clarabo and and you know, uh, roll them up girlies. Roll them up and show your pretty little knees. And uh your daddy and your mommy will say something, but you just say, "Haha." &gt;&gt; That's the words to the song. Your mother and dad will say uh something against it and but you just say, "Haha." Ain't that amazing? A prophet will say, "That's the spirit of the age." &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of America. Haha. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I had you standing up rejoicing a few minutes ago. &gt;&gt; But you ought to rejoice of this, too. This is a great protection. &gt;&gt; A great protection. And he said, "What's her children going to be?" And then just a little further in in serpent seed, he said, "What was the seed of the serpent?" He said, "Adulter." You follow it? Adultery with Eve. What happened to that? What brought that forth? What is it tonight? He said, "Uh, they used to censor songs before they'd let them be sung on the radio." And the first one come out was that roll them. Roll them girlies. Roll them. Show your pretty knees and all of that. Laugh at Paw and Ma and give them a haha. Laugh at M and Pa because they're the ones that didn't want it. They're the ones that were trying to stand against it. And give them a haha. He said that's the first one that they let slip through. You think we didn't have a prophet &gt;&gt; and you can go back, you can go on the internet and you can get those people that write on those things and they will pin it right back to that very time &gt;&gt; and to these same women &gt;&gt; and he says where do you think the guy is tonight that wrote that song? &gt;&gt; He's dead. What do you think of Clarabo who come out the first one said she said and and this curve this uh phrase the dangerous curves and the strip tease that sent thousands of souls to hell. Where do you think she is tonight? &gt;&gt; She's been dead for a long time. Where's she at when that body of hers laying yonder, cankered in the dust, and the worms and the maggots has eat through it and her soul lays yonder before a just God. I say praise be to God &gt;&gt; that set us a word, &gt;&gt; set us a standard. Hallelujah. I feel like let my lips rejoice and praise him for the protection of the word. My brother, my sister, just think what it is. And I I have a little bit of a sense. I have a little bit of a conscience standing in the presence of of of brother Brandham. And that angel of the Lord came there. I tell you the first thought that went through my mind, I am naked. &gt;&gt; There is nothing I can hide. &gt;&gt; Oh, hide me, rock of ages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me be hidden. Yes, &gt;&gt; you young people especially, I felt it so much on my heart. Let it be known to you that God is giving us this kind of word that you will yield yourself the the moment the moment you begin to uh uh present yourself. &gt;&gt; That is the first stage of yielding. &gt;&gt; And so then you're yielding to the spirit that even designed the thing men and women both all kinds of things. I take very very great care when I personally go shopping. I find men my age. I think that they've got their second childhood too early, prematurely. They're wanting to act like they're 15 or 16 or 18 or 20 once again. Oh, what an age we're living in. Thank God for deliverance. Now, &gt;&gt; I know this is going to come sideways to you. Our Lord Jesus, he prophesied and he said, "In the day when you see Sodom and Gomorrah again, that'll be the day that I will come and reveal myself." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And I think of the vessel that he chose to reveal himself in. You know, brother Brandon was a handsome man. You know, a very handsome man. &gt;&gt; I say he was striking and he had black wavy curly hair before he lost it. And he didn't lose it naturally. He told me about losing it. He could have sued the man. He lost it through a barber, but he lost his hair early. All fell out in just a short time. He was a very handsome man. in his young life and to hear him speak straight the way that he did in the age that he was in. I tell you what, friends. And then and then I'm closing now. And then God in his great intelligence said, I want to present myself. I want to present myself to a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the way I will present myself, they'll see something that induces them to yield. And here come a little man and his humility was so it was so great. His humility. He come said, "Good evening friends." and speak so kindly to the people and and and knowing the man knowing that in a few moments the very pillar of fire that was back with Moses 4,000 years ago in a bush is going to be right beside him and yet to just be that humble and speak to the people. But you know why he had to be that way? Because he had to present he had to present Jesus Christ to the to a certain group of people. And now you that are here today, let me say in closing, I can't I cannot estimate. I cannot grasp even though I try the grace and the love of God that there were multitudes and multitudes that heard it and it didn't attract them. There was nothing that brought a yielding of them. There was nothing that appealed to them. But there was a few. There was one here and one there. And you one here and one there. You've gathered here into quite a group of people tonight. We have something in common. &gt;&gt; We have something in common. You young fellows that are here, you young ladies and the congregation that is here, you in the balcony, we have something in common. You were attracted by the same thing I was attracted to. You were attracted to the same thing the one next to you. You children and young people have been born in the message. And one day God came by your way. But let it be known that you were attracted to something and you say, "What was I attracted to?" You're attracted to one who came and presented himself to you. Here I am. &gt;&gt; And that is why I tell you what, I break down. I break down just hearing a woman standing there and and brother Brandon then he turns Isn't he lovely? When he said those words, it was like as though he had just stepped out of his presence. It was just like he just stepped out of his presence like the Lord Jesus right there. Like he just been seeing him and he had to now turn to this woman and you know and it seemed like he couldn't say anything else. He says, "Isn't he lovely?" Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, when when Jesus presented himself to me in a vessel that could have that kind of a relationship, I thirst and I hunger after that kind of relationship. And I don't want to settle for anything less. And it's for you. &gt;&gt; It's for you. It's for you young people. It's for you that might have said, "I feel so dry." But I'll tell you what, he's very lovely and he's right near us and he's looking for a response from you. You just want to respond with your heart and you say, "What can I do?" The first thing you can do, you can give your lips and say, "I'll praise him. I'll give my tongue. I'll give you praise. I'm going to lift my hands. I'm going to exalt you. And Lord Jesus, I'm I'm not going to be ashamed to fall on my knees and tell you I love you. And I'm not ashamed of my voice. I'm going to let others hear it because you presented yourself to me. And and now I've yielded to you. And I surrender up my members." I wonder if we can stand. I give you all that I am, all that I ever can be. Oh God, I give it to you. I surrender my members. Would you do that this morning in a in a total surrender to him? All that I All that I am. [Music] All that I am. All I shall ever be. We cannot [Applause] [Music] surrender to thee today. All that I am. All [Music] I shall ever [Music] love that I surrender to thee. All he wants is me. All he wants is [Music] will [Music] not just height. power. All he wants is all I need. All he wants is all he wants is me. Unreservedly every member [Music] not just a part. He wants all my heart. All he wants is all I need. All he wants is &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. [Music] My dear friends, brothers and sisters, as I spoke this morning, I'm praying that God will just take the words and suit it right to your heart. Don't worry about the questions. Well, what should I do? Just just yield. just yield. If you'll yield and say, "Here I am, Lord." And I pray that the Holy Spirit will now just brood. I've done my part, and now I know that he'll do his part. And all he's asking and all he's wanting is just us to draw nearer to him. And let let the word, if there's been a a real conviction there, just surrender to it. Say, "Oh, God." You that perhaps have never practiced to open your mouth and to praise God. Believe me, it's a big part of the scriptures. Give him thanks. We give you thanks, Lord. We lift you up, oh God. Father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God of the prophets, God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, God of Israel, God of the apostles, and you're the God who visited us in this time. You are that living God. You stood by the prophet of God, Lord, and how you trusted him. how we appreciate the messengergers's un undying and undaunted and uncompromising way. Oh God, we thank you for the word that you have sent. And Lord, I thank you especially for the people that have responded to it at at in a different way. You spoke in to one in one way, you spoke to another. You've brought in families. And here we stand today standing redeemed. We're standing here, Lord, to live a life that's glorious before the world, before our associates, before our friends, before our peers. And I'm asking that you'll keep the fires, oh God, of the Holy Spirit burning with a brilliant flame. And may the lives be so quickened from service to service. I even ask that tonight, oh God, you will take, Father, and just grace this day with a mighty visitation. And Father, for whatever you would do throughout as a result of this service, throughout the day, let the people ponder and let them just be so thankful that you come by our way, Lord, service after service. And now, Lord, I pray that you will dismiss us with your grace and send us from this place with joy and thanksgiving in our heart. We give you praise now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I I would like to as you're just getting ready to leave, uh I I want to sing that course. We lift We lift you up in the highest place. Let's lift them up in the highest place.
