[25:26] Amanda you look down as for sister
[25:28] Ramona brother Matthew but we can stand
[25:30] here today he said he made a way light
[25:32] in the darkness amen amen second Samuel
[25:39] 15.
[25:43] and we'll start at 19.
[25:51] well I'll back her up I'll go I'll go
[25:53] 13. how does that give you a little bit
[25:54] of back story here and there came I'll
[25:56] just go quickly and there came a
[25:58] messenger to David saying the hearts of
[25:59] man of Israel are after Absalom and
[26:02] David said unto all his servants that
[26:03] were with him at Jerusalem arise and let
[26:05] us flee and uh and we shall not for we
[26:09] shall not else Escape for absolute makes
[26:11] speed to depart lest he overtake us
[26:13] suddenly and bring evil upon us and
[26:15] smite the city with the edge of the
[26:16] sword
[26:17] the king's servant said unto the king
[26:19] Behold thy servants are ready to do
[26:20] whatsoever my Lord the king shall
[26:22] appoint
[26:24] we'll go into this a little bit later
[26:25] and the King went forth and all his
[26:27] household after him and the King left
[26:29] ten women which were concubines to keep
[26:30] the house and the King went forth and
[26:32] all the people after him and tarried in
[26:34] a place that was afar off
[26:38] in verse 19 now well 18 sorry and the
[26:41] servants all passed on beside him and
[26:43] all the cheriths and the pelotites and
[26:45] all the good tight 600 men which came
[26:46] after him from gath passed on before the
[26:49] king these are men that have been with
[26:51] him for quite a while verse 19 says then
[26:53] the king said to itai to get tight
[26:55] wherefore goest thou also with us return
[26:58] to thy place and abide to the king for
[27:01] thou art a stranger and also in Exile
[27:04] whereas thou camest but yesterday should
[27:06] I this day make thee go up and down with
[27:08] us seeing I go with her I may return
[27:10] thou and take back thy Brethren mercy
[27:13] and Truth be with thee and I answered
[27:16] the king and said as the Lord liveth and
[27:18] as my Lord the king liveth surely in
[27:21] what place my Lord the king shall be
[27:22] whether in death or in life even there
[27:25] also will thy servant be and David said
[27:29] to it I go and pass over and inside the
[27:32] get tight passed over and all his men
[27:33] and all the little ones that were with
[27:36] him let's just skip over to uh second
[27:38] Samuel 18 and we'll just go forward just
[27:41] a little bit let's read a verse
[27:42] hopefully we'll be able to connect them
[27:43] together before you
[27:45] second Samuel 18 verse 2.
[27:50] and David sent fourth a third part of
[27:52] the people under the hand of joab and a
[27:54] third part under the hand of abishai and
[27:56] now this is David in Exile and they're
[27:58] working their way through over Jordan
[28:01] job's brother a third part under the
[28:03] hand also of ithai the guitar so they're
[28:05] broken into three parts and the King
[28:07] said unto the people I will surely go
[28:09] forth with you myself also
[28:11] and the people said Thou shalt not go
[28:14] forth for if we flee away they will not
[28:17] care for us neither if half of us die
[28:19] will they care for us but now Thou Art
[28:22] worth ten thousand of us look at what
[28:26] they how they thought of David their
[28:28] King Thou Art worth ten thousand of us
[28:31] think of it
[28:33] therefore now it is better that thou
[28:35] secure us out of the city
[28:38] so David did not go it that way let's
[28:42] just pray one more time Heavenly Father
[28:44] Lord we've read parts of your scripture
[28:48] Laura and I so in love reading Lord
[28:51] different accounts in your Old Testament
[28:53] and seeing Lord how you weaved who you
[28:56] are through the lives of these brothers
[28:58] and sisters and Lord different accounts
[29:01] of scripture Lord as you typed yourself
[29:03] in so many different ways Lord your
[29:05] scripture is so inspired how one can
[29:07] look at the Bible and read through it
[29:09] and not see Lord the weaving of Jesus
[29:10] Christ all the way through is beyond me
[29:13] but Lord I'm so thankful that you've
[29:15] opened our eyes to see this beautiful
[29:17] word with a message that you gave us to
[29:19] open our eyes Lord so we commit this
[29:21] service tonight
[29:23] feed us with your word we pray in Jesus
[29:25] Christ's name amen
[29:27] amen you let me have your seats tonight
[29:31] I'm going to attempt to uh
[29:34] speak just a little topic
[29:36] something a little
[29:39] fairly just uh let's say basic but just
[29:42] down home and I'm so I'm going to title
[29:45] tonight and you're probably uh today's
[29:47] title I'm just going to call Semper
[29:48] Fidelis and so that's my title tonight
[29:55] nobody reads Latin
[29:58] that went somewhere long time ago semper
[30:00] fidelis well tonight we're just going to
[30:02] title it always loyal
[30:04] and that's what that means and we'll get
[30:06] into that a little bit but I want to
[30:07] speak a little bit about loyalty which
[30:09] you can see here in this scripture it's
[30:11] pretty hard to look at the at the
[30:13] subject of loyalty and not look at the
[30:16] account of David and his men and the
[30:18] Mighty Men and so I just want to maybe
[30:19] delve into a little bit of the topic and
[30:21] that's where we just took itai who was
[30:24] just a newcomer into the ranks so at
[30:26] this time and that's why David told him
[30:28] he said really you don't need to come
[30:29] with us you just got here you yourself
[30:31] is a is an Excel why don't you just go
[30:33] to your place you really haven't you
[30:34] haven't really had much uh you know
[30:36] you're you'd be pretty safe if you just
[30:38] stayed back go back don't need to run
[30:40] around and Exile with me and he said go
[30:42] but his his response was very similar to
[30:45] other accounts in the scripture which we
[30:47] might touch on but as the Lord liveth
[30:49] and as the Lord the king liveth surely
[30:51] in what place my Lord the king shall be
[30:53] whether in death or in life this was a
[30:57] commitment this wasn't just well I'll
[30:59] come along for the ride no he knew that
[31:01] maybe I could die he really just arrived
[31:04] why would he have any need to to connect
[31:07] himself with David and David's troubles
[31:09] but he had obviously made a journey to
[31:11] connect himself he'd come from I think
[31:13] one account says he's a Philistine
[31:15] origin the get tight and so he's come
[31:18] here he's he's seen something in David
[31:21] and he's now said in death or in life
[31:23] I'm with you all right this is the next
[31:25] this is the level of of itai's statement
[31:27] he said here and then on the flip side
[31:29] the people that what they thought of
[31:32] David in their loyalty to him with he
[31:35] was worth ten thousand to of them to to
[31:38] the people which showed you that
[31:39] obviously there was a two-way
[31:41] relationship between David and his
[31:43] people
[31:44] he was loyal to them and they were loyal
[31:46] to him that was pretty clear in these
[31:48] scriptures hopefully you got that much
[31:49] thus far but loyalty is is a pretty
[31:53] broad term it implies a faithfulness
[31:55] that is steadfast in the face of any
[31:57] temptation to renounce desert or betray
[32:01] so you're loyal loyalty is a strong word
[32:04] it really connotates the feeling or
[32:06] sediment you know of accompanying a
[32:07] sense of of Allegiance you know if
[32:09] you're loyal you're Allegiant to
[32:11] something you're very loyal and it it
[32:13] has a certain level of devotion applied
[32:15] to it and it it also if you're loyal to
[32:18] something or if you have allegiance to
[32:19] somebody it also then characterizes you
[32:22] have obviously have a love for some for
[32:24] that that person or or whichever it is
[32:27] you're loyal to and it's an enjoyable
[32:28] experience that's shared between in many
[32:31] cases maybe a sovereign or employer you
[32:34] know in loyalty it's a great quality
[32:37] loyalty it's needed much needed in the
[32:41] world today it's something that's you
[32:44] know kind of higher level you know it's
[32:45] truthfulness it's diligence it's
[32:46] Integrity it's faithfulness it's got all
[32:48] these literally bundled up into this
[32:51] word and and so loyalty though is I I
[32:55] think is is broken hard to find these
[32:58] days
[33:00] you know loyalty it's really the strict
[33:01] application of the golden rule it's the
[33:04] opposite
[33:05] of every uh of really the very human
[33:07] tendency to to look out for
[33:10] number one
[33:11] right loyalty doesn't do that loyalty it
[33:14] really puts the it takes the place or
[33:16] the law of self-preservation before the
[33:18] Divine Law of Honor or preferring one
[33:21] before yourself or prefer one another
[33:23] and so that's pretty tough for this age
[33:26] to be loyal because then I got to put
[33:29] somebody else before me and and
[33:30] therefore that's tough to do in this
[33:33] wonderful laodicean age and so loyalty
[33:36] it's it's it's broken
[33:39] and in fact uh you know I think even
[33:41] people maybe have a hard time
[33:42] understanding the concept if you go back
[33:44] in time loyalty was a big deal chivalry
[33:48] and loyalty and you know came for king
[33:50] and country and so really what we what
[33:53] our level of loyalty is our loyalty
[33:55] programs that's really our sense of
[33:57] loyalty I've got my my 18 loyalty
[34:00] program cards and that's the extent of
[34:02] my loyalty I go I'm loyal to this place
[34:04] because they stamp my card and they give
[34:06] me free things after 10 times or I you
[34:09] know buy them and they give me points I
[34:11] spend ten thousand dollars I get two
[34:12] points I need ten thousand points to do
[34:14] anything to buy a paper clip do the math
[34:16] it's about as good as it is but you
[34:18] carry them you've got your cards full of
[34:21] them and man
[34:22] that's the extent of loyalty these days
[34:25] yeah and when the next one tell us comes
[34:28] up with a good deal it's like throw that
[34:29] modem away and suddenly I've got uh
[34:31] Telus modem and Rogers has went out the
[34:33] door and six months later there's a new
[34:34] promo to out goes Telus modem in goes
[34:36] the Rogers modem loyalty nah
[34:40] no no no mortgage rates so ltd's got the
[34:42] better one I'm gonna go to RBC moving
[34:44] all my accounts over to RBC
[34:47] that's how loyal we are
[34:49] really at the end of the day you know
[34:51] some people they're pretty loyal to
[34:53] their car brands I've had Honda for a
[34:55] long time but you know that's about the
[34:57] extent of it you know so businesses they
[34:59] they drive hard because they really just
[35:00] want your money that's that's really all
[35:03] they're doing is they're actually really
[35:03] not loyal to you they're loyal to your
[35:05] dollar and as soon as they don't have
[35:06] your dollar they ain't loyal to you
[35:08] anymore is that how that works
[35:10] I guess we live in the same world huh
[35:12] yeah
[35:14] but I wonder if we treat God like a
[35:17] loyalty card
[35:18] you know it's if he gives me something
[35:20] while I'm sticking with him if he's
[35:22] given me the points I need or he's he's
[35:24] given me the you know the the healing I
[35:26] need well then I'm loyal but you know if
[35:29] I ain't getting anything in return while
[35:30] I'm moving on to my own ideas
[35:32] just another loyalty card in your
[35:34] spiritual pocketbook
[35:36] that's what the world I think treats God
[35:38] as
[35:39] you know I pledge allegiance
[35:41] to do loyal to a country
[35:43] I don't know if the state's still do but
[35:45] uh you know they pledge allegiance to
[35:47] the flag
[35:48] it's an oath it's a solemn promise
[35:51] and they they pledge that I know
[35:53] everybody says well I pledge allegiance
[35:55] to the flag and you know it's about 30
[35:56] words long or so but I wonder if they
[35:59] really even know what they're doing you
[36:02] know I don't take if I was pledging
[36:04] something they gave each other a pledge
[36:06] was something I know where that comes
[36:08] from but uh that was a pretty big
[36:10] statement to pledge something
[36:12] you know he just don't so when you
[36:14] pledge to your country well you're
[36:15] you're putting yourself right on the the
[36:18] front line of the ranks and saying okay
[36:20] I'm going to stand for it anything that
[36:22] that I need to I'm going to give by all
[36:23] to my country I'm going to be loyal to
[36:25] it I'm going to uphold it standards
[36:28] I wonder if you want to do that
[36:33] sir Nathan Hale was one of the first U.S
[36:35] I think the first U.S uh spy
[36:40] and was killed as a spy back in 1776 I
[36:44] believe it was and he was loyal to
[36:46] Country and he said my regret it is it
[36:49] is said that he says this it's not
[36:51] totally confirmed but the history says
[36:52] that he regrets his last words were that
[36:55] he has but one life to lose for his
[36:58] country this was this was loyalty
[37:02] he wish he had more lives to lose and
[37:04] now if we spin forward
[37:06] consequently or coincidentally we have a
[37:09] coronation this weekend unbeknownst to
[37:11] me until I was doing some studying and
[37:13] we have a we have a king being crowned
[37:15] this Saturday I believe it is and uh and
[37:18] so they're having a you know the
[37:19] citizens are going to obviously around
[37:21] the globe are going to be watching as
[37:23] they pledge you know their allegiance to
[37:25] the king because something new is
[37:27] happening this time that they actually
[37:29] are allowing homage to the people to be
[37:31] done and so the Archbishop of Canterbury
[37:34] is going to enlist a course of millions
[37:37] they say to ask oh whoso desire in the
[37:40] Abbey and elsewhere to make an oath this
[37:43] is used to be just for nobility to say
[37:44] but now the people can join and say this
[37:47] is what they will be able to say I swear
[37:48] that I will pay true allegiance to your
[37:51] majesty and to your heirs and successors
[37:53] according to law so help me God
[37:57] yes this is what everybody can have to
[37:59] say and then after this after the uh
[38:01] followed by a Fanfare from the
[38:02] Archbishop saying God saved the king and
[38:04] in response the people will shout God
[38:06] save King Charles Long Live King Charles
[38:08] May the King live forever
[38:11] this is on the program this is what's
[38:13] happening this weekend
[38:15] yes the pledge
[38:16] [Laughter]
[38:19] this replaces the traditional homage of
[38:21] peers I said which was really just for
[38:23] you know the Royal Heritage but we want
[38:25] everybody now we're not going to be in
[38:27] exclusive we're going to include the
[38:29] world and allow them to be loyal to the
[38:31] crown and state this fact Unfortunately
[38:34] they didn't pull the public and when
[38:36] they did 85 percent of the public has no
[38:38] desire to give their loyalty to the
[38:41] crown
[38:43] so this is where loyalty lies
[38:48] and it's all but it's integrated in this
[38:50] age
[38:51] it's lost in our marriages and
[38:53] friendships and work
[38:54] and there's a lot of so much
[38:56] unfaithfulness
[38:57] because of the age and I wonder if
[39:00] that's how we did it in battle we said
[39:02] well forget it I'm just going to battle
[39:04] and it's for me and me alone it'd be a
[39:06] one-man battle everywhere and it'd be
[39:07] just a chaos there was there was a
[39:09] requirement in battle to be loyal
[39:11] because you fought his unified Force
[39:14] and so a soldier and I feel for me I
[39:16] feel like I should uh I feel like I
[39:18] could have been born back in those eras
[39:21] you know the 1200s I feel like I could
[39:22] have been a knight you know I feel like
[39:24] I could fight you know for for my king
[39:27] it just somehow was something in me you
[39:29] know but I think Lord maybe that's
[39:30] because I'm just fighting for my king
[39:32] not something in this world but in me
[39:35] and I would believe in a seed of God
[39:37] there's something that's like yeah I'm
[39:39] fighting for my king I've got a king you
[39:41] know people say well my lease yeah he is
[39:43] my lead he's my king of kings and I
[39:45] fight for him yeah yeah well you know
[39:48] King Arthur's days I liked those books
[39:51] thank you
[39:54] but people don't even know what that
[39:55] means anymore
[39:57] it's it's like really you know fight for
[40:00] a king the mentality is so shifted
[40:03] but
[40:04] I would hope that's not the case in the
[40:06] ranks of God's Army
[40:09] oh sir I would pray that there was an
[40:12] unwavering loyalty in this church
[40:15] tonight amen you know but it's easy to
[40:17] serve it's easy to be loyal when the
[40:20] going is good when everything is is fine
[40:22] and and wonderful but when things get
[40:24] tough like it did in David's day like it
[40:27] did when itai came it was a rough moment
[40:30] because David was being sent out of the
[40:32] Kingdom he was he was basically running
[40:34] in Exile before Absalom came along and
[40:36] the times were not easy and this is when
[40:38] you really find where your loyalty lies
[40:40] and you're seen really in their Kingdom
[40:42] what was happening and so people they
[40:44] can they can have their loyalty but but
[40:45] really when it when the battle stiffens
[40:48] then we find out where it is and if your
[40:50] loyalty has just been in a church and
[40:52] something ripples through a church and
[40:53] your loyalty is then shattered you're
[40:55] shattered you put your loyalty in some
[40:57] friend or your family and your family
[40:59] fails you and now you're sitting there
[41:01] well man your world starts to crumble
[41:03] you put it in a minister or a pastor and
[41:05] something happens and your confidence
[41:06] gets shaken it's because your loyalty
[41:08] has been put in the wrong thing your
[41:10] loyalty put should be in the very word
[41:12] of God in the word of God alone man will
[41:14] make mistakes churches will make
[41:16] mistakes but God's word never makes a
[41:18] mistake
[41:21] but Abraham says oh everything's all
[41:22] right as long as you got your name in
[41:24] the book you might have your name on a
[41:25] dozen books if it ain't the book of life
[41:28] you're lost he says you can never be so
[41:30] good you you can just be as loyal and
[41:33] clean and moral as you can be that won't
[41:36] have one thing to do with it
[41:40] you can say I come to church every
[41:42] service I'm as loyal church member as it
[41:45] can be it really don't matter actually
[41:47] what you're loyal to matters
[41:50] you need to be loyal to this
[41:53] and that alone
[41:54] amen
[41:56] loyalty to anything else but the
[41:58] anointed word of God
[41:59] it's got nothing for you because at some
[42:01] point it will fail
[42:04] and here if we go back in the story if
[42:07] you read you can go through II Samuel
[42:09] and first Samuel there's a quite the uh
[42:13] quite the accounts there
[42:15] but if we go back in there there was a
[42:16] time when out of Nigel was going to be
[42:18] crowned King because some loyalty
[42:21] shifted for joab had moved his loyalty
[42:23] which he should never have done and he
[42:25] moved it and thought that out of Niger
[42:27] one of David's Sons should be king and
[42:29] so joab and abiathar was going to take
[42:32] him to be crowned King David is now aged
[42:34] and hasn't really decreed who would he
[42:37] has but but they're trying to take maybe
[42:38] advantage and so their loyalty now to
[42:41] their own idea they're loyal to their
[42:43] own own thought on the matter and so now
[42:45] they're going to start to put things
[42:47] together and off they go they get some
[42:48] guests they kill some oxen and they're
[42:50] going to go have a party to Crown out of
[42:52] Niger King and so then Nathan and and uh
[42:56] Ben Anaya and zedok they they come to to
[42:59] David and they say wait a second it is
[43:01] not Solomon supposed to be king
[43:04] now let's let's type type to here and
[43:06] brother Brown says in a quote we'll get
[43:07] to further down the road David was the
[43:09] type of Christ and so David had what was
[43:12] going to be the direction for the
[43:13] kingdom David had the word for the
[43:15] kingdom and so Solomon was to be king
[43:17] and so here he decrees this and and and
[43:20] and brings benaniah and zyduck and they
[43:22] anoint Solomon and they bring him on the
[43:24] king's mule and here Port joab he's got
[43:27] his loyalty now misplaced over here and
[43:29] they prayed Solomon now down the street
[43:31] and they start to oh and now they start
[43:34] to cheer and this is a wonderful moment
[43:36] so here you've got somebody being
[43:37] crowned out in a different area and now
[43:39] you have David they've now they've
[43:41] anointed Solomon and he's getting
[43:42] crowned over in this area and so people
[43:44] say they're over where adonija is
[43:46] they're they're all you know they're
[43:48] having a good time until they hear
[43:50] sounds of cheering and again so they say
[43:53] what's that what's happening say well
[43:55] wait a second a Runner comes in and says
[43:56] they've just crowned Solomon King
[44:00] you know what happened in that very
[44:01] moment
[44:02] all their loyalty
[44:05] faded
[44:06] faded fast because they knew their
[44:09] loyalty was in the wrong spot but when
[44:12] things were going just okay you know and
[44:14] there was no Ripple in it that was fine
[44:16] they were they were feeling confident
[44:17] but the moment the error was found out
[44:20] oh my goodness you couldn't find nobody
[44:22] that was going to want to side without a
[44:24] Niger they were gone they were going
[44:26] this direction in that direction because
[44:28] their neck was on the line but those
[44:30] that were behind Solomon had confidence
[44:32] because they were following the word of
[44:34] the king they didn't have to be oh well
[44:37] I don't know can we cheer no tear King
[44:40] Solomon's on the throne
[44:43] and that's what the men with David as
[44:44] they came out of Exile they were
[44:47] confident that their lawyer who wear
[44:48] their loyalty was they didn't have to be
[44:50] like well should I be with David should
[44:52] I not no he's anointed that's who I'm
[44:54] following
[44:56] when you know you're following the word
[44:57] you don't have to Hopscotch around and
[45:00] look over your shoulder and wonder am I
[45:02] on the wrong right side no no you're on
[45:04] the right side I'd be wondering if
[45:06] you're on the other side
[45:08] that's when you should be should be a
[45:10] little scared
[45:12] but your trust your hope your faith your
[45:13] life should be placed in the anointed
[45:16] word for our day
[45:21] God's children don't
[45:23] it's in the worst times
[45:25] it's in the difficult times
[45:27] that's when God likes to show and bring
[45:30] out who's loyal to his word and not
[45:33] it's in the difficult moments you see
[45:35] where someone's loyalty lies
[45:37] and here as we read the scripture now we
[45:39] have David's Mighty Men needed really
[45:42] needed a real revelation of who they are
[45:45] following
[45:46] really if you look at the circumstance
[45:48] this is now the second time David had
[45:50] been on the run these men had been
[45:51] following him always when he was on the
[45:53] run from Saul many of them David was
[45:55] scorned he was a vagabond he had he had
[45:58] feigned craziness at Early times and
[46:00] they've kept following him
[46:03] all this time
[46:05] I put yourself in their shoes these are
[46:08] men
[46:09] they didn't just like well you know
[46:10] willy-nilly no these were Mighty Men and
[46:13] they had aligned themselves with David
[46:15] and David was not going through good
[46:18] times all the time
[46:22] this word has had difficult times
[46:28] and a small band of men
[46:31] looked beyond circumstances
[46:33] it was 600 at one point another
[46:35] scripture says 400 there's more but
[46:37] these were the men around and then there
[46:39] was a 30 which is even smaller group of
[46:41] them that were Mighty they're defined in
[46:44] scripture then there's even those that
[46:45] are the three and and Brad Brown says
[46:49] did you know David who he represented he
[46:50] represented Christ Christ was the son of
[46:53] David he said listen closely those
[46:55] Gentile Warriors many of them noticed
[46:56] they came from everywhere some of them
[46:58] were Gentiles some were even Jew but
[47:00] they they didn't know that they knew
[47:02] that the fugitive was anointed this is
[47:06] what matters
[47:07] they knew David was rejected by his own
[47:09] people they knowed the anointing was on
[47:11] them they could see it so they stood
[47:13] right by his side die or live they were
[47:16] Gallant men no matter how much the
[47:18] outside world didn't believe it
[47:22] they were firm and their loyalty
[47:25] I love the types in the Bible I wonder
[47:27] sometimes I read I just wonder I love
[47:30] putting myself into the types of the
[47:32] scripture I'm like yeah that's that's me
[47:34] that's me there or I read another
[47:36] account in scripture I'm like in Moses
[47:38] and different things I'm like yep that
[47:39] that's me I'd be right there with him I
[47:41] wonder if some people read the scripture
[47:43] I wonder where they put themselves
[47:45] I I really do are they able to put
[47:48] themselves on uh as David's Mighty Man I
[47:51] hope so that's where we all want to
[47:52] place ourselves and here David mighty
[47:54] man he came his own people kicked him
[47:56] out they didn't want nothing to do with
[47:57] him Saul run him out the head of
[47:59] denomination kicked him out have nothing
[48:01] to do with it the council kicked him out
[48:02] David was a fugitive he had gone
[48:05] wherever he could and there he was up in
[48:07] the mountains with a little group of men
[48:09] Gentiles and so forth and they looked at
[48:11] that man and they knowed he was the
[48:13] coming King man thou taking a revelation
[48:17] Big Time Revelation here they were
[48:19] before Saul when it was during Saul's
[48:22] time he's at the caves of agileum and
[48:24] these different accounts and they had to
[48:25] look at here's the man he's just in a
[48:28] cave I mean drinking stagnant water and
[48:30] food they could have scond or take get
[48:32] from other places that would provide for
[48:34] them they're on the run and they're like
[48:35] yeah he's King I'm following him
[48:37] some people like what are these guys
[48:38] they're crazy what are they following
[48:39] anyway
[48:41] just some cult out there
[48:44] let's put it down to our day
[48:47] who is this anyway is this it doesn't
[48:49] even make sense he's being run off it's
[48:51] not he's not unpopular it's it's just
[48:55] but there was a group of men
[48:57] there's a group of people
[48:58] that were loyal
[49:00] to the anointing
[49:05] so David ran from run from Saul
[49:09] he ran from Absalom David was on the Run
[49:11] both these times of rejection
[49:13] when David you think about it when David
[49:15] was running from Saul one one priest
[49:17] helped him out and gave him Goliath's
[49:19] sword
[49:20] and for that he was killed a bunch of
[49:23] other priests were killed in the whole
[49:24] village where the priest came from knob
[49:26] they were also slain men women children
[49:27] oxen
[49:29] because they'd helped David
[49:31] and then David had to wear that burden
[49:33] and the men that followed him loyal to
[49:35] him also had to carry that really what
[49:37] are you doing you had all these people
[49:39] killed because you helped like what you
[49:41] think think about what they had to live
[49:43] the heaviness of this but they stuck
[49:45] with him
[49:46] day in day out night in Night Out
[49:50] rejection and scorned and scoffed but
[49:54] they said that's the anointed king
[50:00] Absalom then
[50:02] he runs out David runs out now in that
[50:04] situation
[50:05] absent didn't like how David dealt with
[50:07] Tamar and Ammon and the story and
[50:09] thought he should have dealt with it now
[50:11] he stirs up the people and people start
[50:13] switching their loyalty and again David
[50:15] now is running out of out of the city of
[50:18] Jerusalem that's where the scripture he
[50:19] read started and what a turmoil again as
[50:21] David lazy packs up his family and he
[50:23] flees rejected
[50:25] and once again
[50:27] the loyal Mighty Men bind around so
[50:30] let's go
[50:31] we're with you
[50:33] through thick through sin through
[50:35] Darkness through good times through bad
[50:37] times their loyalty wasn't dependent on
[50:40] good circumstances and I wonder we will
[50:43] make sure that our loyalty to the word
[50:46] is not dependent upon great
[50:48] circumstances well I'm just doing
[50:50] wonderful my family's doing great but
[50:52] when I'm in dark times when my family's
[50:54] in a dark time when my wife is sick when
[50:56] my husband is sick when my lost loved
[50:58] ones are out in those times are you
[51:00] loyal
[51:02] amen
[51:05] I didn't see a scripture someone could
[51:07] point it to me but I didn't see one
[51:09] where through the up and down the
[51:11] Loyalty of those Mighty Men wavered I
[51:13] didn't see a scripture where it said
[51:14] well these 37 or the three but that one
[51:16] of the three he he he he he was always
[51:19] in scripture they were accounted as
[51:21] mighty men at David and so these Valiant
[51:24] Mighty Men had different Feats and
[51:26] battles you had the one that you know
[51:28] killed 800 with lifted up his spear
[51:31] against 800 and slew at one time that's
[51:33] a lot of people fill this place to the
[51:35] brink and then put the put me in the
[51:36] middle and be like all right bring it on
[51:39] you'll be like yeah we'll we'll take you
[51:41] out in 10 seconds no he didn't he took
[51:43] them out and whatever long it was these
[51:45] are Mighty Men Alias are son of Dodo and
[51:47] ahoite one of the three Mighty Men He
[51:49] arose smoke Philistines until his hand
[51:51] was weary and his hand claved to the
[51:53] sword they had to pry his fingers off
[51:55] the sword he had fought for so long
[51:57] these are Mighty Men of Valor he stood
[51:59] in the midst of the ground defended a
[52:01] ground full of lentils we have benoniah
[52:04] who who uh slew two lion-like men of
[52:06] Moab threw a lion in the midst of a pit
[52:08] slew an Egyptian large five cubits of
[52:11] spear the same as gliosphere Weaver's
[52:13] beam we had other Mighty Men of David
[52:15] that also slew Goliath's brothers so not
[52:18] just David David showed in the example
[52:20] the other mighty man said if he can do
[52:21] it we can do it if our God can do it
[52:25] he's given us the work so he can do it
[52:29] these Mighty Men not all of them Jew but
[52:32] they had a revelation Simon didn't even
[52:34] belong to Israel but David to them was
[52:36] the king didn't matter if they were
[52:38] Israel or not David was their King and
[52:40] so they accomplished these Feats for
[52:42] David
[52:46] not just women though not in this in
[52:48] David's sense but it's not just women
[52:50] that are mighty Mighty and Valor when
[52:53] there's a loyalty to to to where the
[52:56] loyalty is placed and I was thinking we
[52:58] can sometimes place our you know these
[53:00] Mighty Men of Valor what they've done
[53:02] and we can type and say rise up mighty
[53:04] event and sometimes our sisters are like
[53:06] what about us
[53:08] sisters you're mighty too
[53:11] I think because I go back to an equal
[53:14] Mighty woman
[53:15] whose name is JL
[53:17] and she also had a loyalty who jabin
[53:21] thought she was loyal to Canaan but her
[53:24] loyalty was on something else her
[53:26] loyalty was clearly on Israel and who
[53:28] she was fighting for who she was willing
[53:30] to fight for she had aligned that there
[53:32] and so she was loyal and faithful and
[53:34] here she had a devil come in her tent
[53:37] come on moms
[53:39] well you ever had a devil come into your
[53:40] home coming on your child or something
[53:42] like that come out of school there's an
[53:44] influencer where did that thing come
[53:46] from
[53:47] yeah this is where J.L was and so they
[53:49] thought she was at peace that little
[53:51] demon thought maybe they could enter
[53:52] your home and and be maybe be missed or
[53:54] maybe not be seen But jail refused to be
[53:57] loyal to anybody but Israel by her
[54:00] surely by her actions looked like she
[54:02] stood alone but tonight I wonder if
[54:04] there's mothers of this gospel you might
[54:07] feel like you're all alone in your
[54:09] little home but I say identify with JL
[54:14] maybe your spiritual walk has grown cold
[54:16] a little bit you can't remember the last
[54:18] time you've prayed maybe you've got
[54:20] little children you've allowed them
[54:21] maybe you're sticking them on some
[54:23] streaming device instead of taking care
[54:25] of them or your husband's home wondering
[54:27] if you barely have time for him and
[54:28] maybe when's the last time you put on a
[54:29] nice dress when he walked in the door
[54:31] and tell you revolutionized probably
[54:32] your marriage at that very moment but if
[54:34] any of those little imps or something
[54:36] come in your home I'd say like jail take
[54:38] a little take a nail of the word and
[54:40] nail his head to the ground
[54:46] he's a mighty woman
[54:48] Mighty and Valor
[54:50] claim back your walk claim back your
[54:53] loyalty to your savior maybe it's
[54:55] Deborah she was a judge of Israel road
[54:57] to battle with Barack
[54:59] the same this is the same time actually
[55:00] Deborah in jail we're also in the same
[55:03] time period essentially great women
[55:06] Valiant loyal
[55:08] to their King of Kings
[55:11] could we speak of Daniel
[55:12] who is told to stop praying stop
[55:14] worshiping stop praising Daniel you're
[55:17] going to be fed to a lion Den
[55:21] um
[55:22] his loyalty
[55:23] was to his God
[55:25] and it was not going to waver in the
[55:28] dark moment well I guess I for 30 days I
[55:31] mean that's all it is for 30 days I
[55:32] guess I could stop praying why not for
[55:34] 30 days I could stop opening my window
[55:36] maybe I'll just pray behind the window
[55:38] could have done these things
[55:41] don't tell me the devil didn't place the
[55:43] thought there but Daniel said no way I'm
[55:46] not going to alter my walk I'm not going
[55:48] to alter how I serve my God for any
[55:51] devil that's going to encroach his foot
[55:53] on my ground so open these windows I'm
[55:55] going to stand there boldly and I'm
[55:57] going to pray
[55:59] he did
[56:03] Paul so many ones in Scripture
[56:07] heresy he said so I worship God Hebrew
[56:10] boys we know how how often these were in
[56:13] difficult moments is when their loyalty
[56:16] to whom they serve who they said they
[56:18] served was now coming to the Forefront
[56:21] all right you say that you won't bow
[56:23] let's just see if you if you can put
[56:26] your money where your mouth is right and
[56:29] that's what's going to happen and that's
[56:30] what God and the devil's going to do you
[56:32] confess it you say it this is what I
[56:34] believe I stand on the word of God and
[56:36] then a trout comes and he's like all
[56:38] right let's just see where you stand on
[56:40] that and that's what happened in the
[56:42] Hebrew boys but our bam says they
[56:44] purpose in their heart in a prayer
[56:45] meeting one night amen Brothers
[56:47] a purpose in their heart in a prayer
[56:49] meeting one night amen you could be at a
[56:51] prayer meeting one night and you could
[56:53] be praying on your knees and we're
[56:55] purposing to say I'm going to live for
[56:56] this gospel and the devil's coming
[56:59] to say all right you're gonna bow
[57:03] we're not going to defile ourselves we
[57:06] was going to stand we was going to stand
[57:09] of God's word regardless of what the
[57:11] rest of the world said that's about a
[57:13] brown said they said so they said we're
[57:15] going to stand we're going to be loyal
[57:17] they're going to worship their God
[57:19] they're going to bow to the God of this
[57:21] evil age that's fine but not us
[57:24] all right so Nebuchadnezzar said well
[57:26] we'll just burn some of this Holy Roller
[57:29] religion right out of them
[57:32] brother Brown says could you imagine
[57:34] burn the holy ghost out of a man when
[57:37] the Holy Ghost is fire itself
[57:39] just you try amen he said fire fights
[57:43] fire
[57:45] amen you have the fire of God in you
[57:48] that don't matter what's on this age it
[57:50] don't matter how hot the furnace is
[57:51] you'll just walk right in there because
[57:53] you are fire
[57:55] amen
[57:57] he said I'll bring a fire that no man
[57:58] can bring but God's seeing the Loyalty
[58:01] The faithfulness of these Hebrew
[58:03] children oh my goodness brother Brandon
[58:05] he oh he encounts this one's so
[58:06] beautiful I know you've probably read it
[58:08] 1800 times I've read it so many but
[58:10] there the angel said Master look down
[58:12] they're fit have you we're they're
[58:14] fixing to burn up three faithful
[58:16] believers
[58:19] ah I can hear he says yep where and
[58:22] would I watch them all night long don't
[58:24] think his eyes not watching you you
[58:26] don't think when the Devil Makes then
[58:27] his his call of what he's going to do
[58:29] you don't think the Lord doesn't know
[58:30] that he's doing that you bet he does
[58:32] he's like all right I'll just take a
[58:34] look at this his eyes on the sparrow if
[58:37] he knows any sparrow that falls out of
[58:38] the sky you don't think he can see you
[58:40] or I when we're going through a deep
[58:42] dark trial oh yeah he's watching you
[58:45] he's watching you he said no no no no
[58:47] these are my loyal Faithful Servants
[58:50] he's got a keen interest
[58:52] to watch you because he wants to watch
[58:54] your life glorify him
[58:56] yeah he says oh I know
[58:59] he sees everything I hear warm what he
[59:01] says oh back there give me the authority
[59:03] he wants to wipe off wipe Nebuchadnezzar
[59:05] off the off the planet he says you know
[59:07] let me just go and watch Babylon off the
[59:09] face of the Earth he says I can't let
[59:11] you go and then Gabriel comes up he says
[59:13] in an account and draws his sword he
[59:15] said I want to chop them you know I'll
[59:16] just chop them right to death but I'm
[59:17] sure in about a split second Gabriel
[59:20] would be there and Nebuchadnezzar would
[59:21] be would be on the ground dead and there
[59:23] would be no fire but God said that's
[59:26] that's I believe you could do that but
[59:27] now it's not happened he said uh he said
[59:29] I can hear him say Well Gabriel you
[59:31] obeyed me since the day I created you
[59:32] but I can't let you go because he says
[59:35] I'm going myself because it's a
[59:37] man-sized job
[59:39] uh can you imagine God saying the story
[59:40] Gabriel but it's a man's size job I mean
[59:43] it's a god-sized job for me to go down
[59:45] there
[59:48] he says I can see him rise from his seat
[59:50] his robes drop off him way back there in
[59:52] the north and he talks about how he
[59:53] brings the Thunderclap clouds and all of
[59:55] all of this as he describes it which I
[59:57] won't take the time but then in a moment
[59:59] there as they walk into them flames you
[1:00:02] know what he says he says they're
[1:00:03] standing there Fanning away all the
[1:00:05] breezes like that talking over the
[1:00:08] future for them
[1:00:09] you wonder what they were talking about
[1:00:11] right there they're talking about their
[1:00:13] future right there what was going to
[1:00:14] happen he was given a little insight of
[1:00:16] what was going on Amen here this word
[1:00:18] tells you about your future in there
[1:00:20] your fourth man in the fire sent you a
[1:00:22] message in this hour to tell you your
[1:00:24] future in the Flames of laodice here you
[1:00:27] will not be consumed and while you're in
[1:00:29] there you've got a word that you can
[1:00:31] read and a message that you can pour
[1:00:33] over and it's your God and God's side
[1:00:36] God to tell you your future
[1:00:39] hey
[1:00:42] there they stood you know what the fire
[1:00:44] didn't go nowhere
[1:00:45] they were still in the trial
[1:00:51] You're Still In the Heat of laodicea I
[1:00:54] should say you're still in the fires of
[1:00:55] laodicea but there ain't no heat on you
[1:01:00] there's no smoke man no smell no no that
[1:01:04] there nothing of the age they were still
[1:01:08] in it the fire was all around them but
[1:01:11] they had one that could keep all the
[1:01:13] effects of it
[1:01:15] foot down why because loyal Faithful
[1:01:18] Servants to the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:01:20] would stand there and he back them up
[1:01:23] you loyal to him he's loyal to his
[1:01:26] servant
[1:01:28] in the time of need he just wanted to
[1:01:31] see are they going to do it are they
[1:01:34] going to stand for me
[1:01:35] God didn't wonder he was just waiting
[1:01:38] it's okay wormwood it's okay Gabriel
[1:01:41] they got it
[1:01:42] I'm just waiting for the moment when I
[1:01:45] can step on the scene same thing he did
[1:01:47] with Moses when he called and then he
[1:01:49] put in there amram trusted in the Lord
[1:01:51] their loyalty was in him he had spoke to
[1:01:54] them they knew Moses was a deliverer
[1:01:56] they knew he was a different child and
[1:01:59] they committed him to the river and God
[1:02:00] said bring down a legion of angels line
[1:02:03] up that now River on left and right and
[1:02:05] I'm going to go to the very end of it
[1:02:07] and wait for it because he's mine
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] you think you're in a trial with
[1:02:14] crocodiles everywhere but you might have
[1:02:16] Legion of angels all the way down you're
[1:02:18] not you're never and at the end of it as
[1:02:20] the Lord said just come to me I'm at the
[1:02:22] end of your River
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:31] but this God
[1:02:32] you're God and my God
[1:02:34] he doesn't demand a loyalty in fact he
[1:02:36] doesn't demand it at all
[1:02:38] but he creates
[1:02:40] a relationship
[1:02:42] that you desire to be loyal to him
[1:02:47] in fact he begins by example
[1:02:51] a man he's loyal
[1:02:53] he's the loyal one he's always loyal
[1:02:57] always faithful he's not gonna he he's
[1:03:01] not going to desire commitment from you
[1:03:03] that he wouldn't do himself that's not
[1:03:06] our God David was a warrior he fought he
[1:03:10] led he provided he gave him dying
[1:03:13] loyalty to his people as Christ did for
[1:03:15] you and I that's why they could say no
[1:03:17] David don't don't you're worth ten
[1:03:19] thousand to us why because David had
[1:03:22] constantly gone all before them he led
[1:03:24] the way they knew he was a runny little
[1:03:26] boy and took a glass down he led and so
[1:03:31] therefore they desired I'm following him
[1:03:37] he was a type of our God
[1:03:39] who is the epitome of the motto of my
[1:03:42] title
[1:03:43] simpler
[1:03:44] Fidelis
[1:03:46] Semper Fidelis
[1:03:48] he's a covenant keeper he's a promise
[1:03:51] keeper
[1:03:52] Moses in Exodus and it came to pass in
[1:03:56] process of time the king of Egypt died
[1:03:57] the children of Israel signed by aside
[1:03:59] by reason of bondage and cried and their
[1:04:01] Cry came up to the Lord by reason of
[1:04:03] their bondage and God heard their
[1:04:05] groaning and remembered his Covenant
[1:04:10] amen God didn't go 400 plus years he's
[1:04:12] like oh I missed it I mean 400 years
[1:04:15] have passed oh my goodness oh no that's
[1:04:18] not our God he's loyal he's faithful to
[1:04:20] his promise he said to act for 400 years
[1:04:23] I will deliver your people Abraham and
[1:04:25] at 400 plus years God was just waiting
[1:04:28] Moses came to his proper time he said
[1:04:30] now's the moment I'm a promise keeper
[1:04:33] I'm a covenant maker and a covenant
[1:04:35] keeper
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:38] he'll never let his word fall
[1:04:40] he's a coming his Covenant if it would
[1:04:44] break eternity would break it's
[1:04:45] impossible world will pass away God's
[1:04:48] word will never pass away
[1:04:50] Deuteronomy 4 31 says for the Lord that
[1:04:53] God is a merciful god he will not
[1:04:55] forsake thee neither destroy thee nor
[1:04:59] forget the Covenant of thy fathers which
[1:05:01] he swear under them no forsake means
[1:05:03] it's to sink or to relax to let down to
[1:05:06] be disheartened to withdraw God will
[1:05:09] never withdraw he'll never abandon he'll
[1:05:12] never refrain he'll never relax he'll
[1:05:14] never let you alone he'll never be quiet
[1:05:16] he's gonna he's never gonna show himself
[1:05:18] slack as men count slackness not God
[1:05:22] and David knew of this faithful one
[1:05:25] David knew of this loyal one you just
[1:05:28] read his Psalms you know he knew who he
[1:05:31] had believed in amen
[1:05:34] David when he writes the Psalms in
[1:05:35] Psalms 136 you can actually read and if
[1:05:39] I read it you would unders you would
[1:05:40] know it right quickly because it's a
[1:05:42] Psalm that has every verse and has mercy
[1:05:44] endureth forever and it says another
[1:05:46] verse and his Mercy endures forever
[1:05:48] there's many verses there there's 30 26
[1:05:50] that say and his mercy endureth forever
[1:05:54] this is a Psalm that David wrote but if
[1:05:56] you go into that psalm
[1:05:58] and you read the word mercy the word
[1:06:01] mercy is actually a Hebrew word called
[1:06:03] and it's not just Mercy as you would
[1:06:06] take Mercy
[1:06:07] it's actually indicating kindness loving
[1:06:10] kindness Mercy goodness faithfulness
[1:06:12] love acts of kindness oh he said it's
[1:06:15] it's this aspect of God it's his
[1:06:17] character of Truth and faithfulness
[1:06:19] Mercy steadfastness Justice
[1:06:21] righteousness loyalty all in one word
[1:06:25] it said it's actually impossible to try
[1:06:27] and convey what that word is in the in
[1:06:29] all of the English language and so the
[1:06:31] the translator put Mercy there but it's
[1:06:34] not just that it's the he said the moon
[1:06:36] the stars the rule by night for his
[1:06:38] mercy endureth forever that could be
[1:06:40] well his goodness endureth forever his
[1:06:42] loyalty endures forever it's
[1:06:43] faithfulness endures forever he's the
[1:06:45] love endures forever amen he's heading
[1:06:48] he slew the famous Kings he gave their
[1:06:50] land for a Heritage he said in who
[1:06:52] remembered I said our lowest state for
[1:06:54] his mercy endureth forever redeemed us
[1:06:56] from our enemies first faithfulness
[1:06:58] endures forever David knew who his God
[1:07:01] was he was a loyal God and he would
[1:07:03] write a Psalm about him
[1:07:06] Isaiah 54 said in the little rat in a
[1:07:09] little wrath I hid my faith from thee
[1:07:11] for a moment but with Everlasting
[1:07:13] kindness
[1:07:14] depart Everlasting kindness will I have
[1:07:17] mercy on thee that Everlasting kindness
[1:07:19] is again said it's faithfulness it's
[1:07:21] love it's very it's loyalty it's acts of
[1:07:24] kindness all of that you say oh is
[1:07:26] Everlasting kindness no is his
[1:07:27] Everlasting faithfulness to you is this
[1:07:29] Everlasting loyalty to you
[1:07:31] oh the Bible's much deeper and richer
[1:07:34] than just face value
[1:07:36] Deuteronomy says no therefore the Lord
[1:07:38] that God he is the faithful God who
[1:07:40] keepeth Covenant and mercy again which
[1:07:42] is the word has said Exodus 34 and the
[1:07:45] Lord God passed before him proclaim the
[1:07:46] Lord the Lord God merciful gracious
[1:07:49] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[1:07:51] and Truth keeping Mercy for the
[1:07:53] thousands and forgiving iniquity and
[1:07:55] transgression the whole scripture again
[1:07:57] the same word I said it's just filled
[1:07:59] with his faithfulness it's filled with
[1:08:02] his loyalty and his love for you and I
[1:08:07] the keeper of his word
[1:08:11] that's what he's loyal to
[1:08:13] it's his word
[1:08:16] he's the one who said
[1:08:19] seed will crush the head of the serpent
[1:08:22] did it happen
[1:08:23] it did
[1:08:24] because he's loyal to his word
[1:08:27] he will ensure that it happens he's the
[1:08:31] one who said Noah build an ark and a
[1:08:33] place of safety so that he would get
[1:08:34] through the flood did it happen oh yes
[1:08:37] it did he's the one who promised Abraham
[1:08:39] seed would be Sans as the seed and as
[1:08:41] the start of the sky and he have seat
[1:08:43] out of his flesh did it happen oh yes it
[1:08:46] did he promised Israel would go into
[1:08:48] captivity for 70 years did it happen
[1:08:50] some didn't want to but did it happen
[1:08:52] yes it did why because he's loyal to his
[1:08:55] word his Prophet speaker's word God's
[1:08:58] obligated to ensure it happens
[1:09:00] that's why even when Elisha spoke to she
[1:09:03] Bears though God is obligated for that
[1:09:05] to happen
[1:09:06] he said he would be wounded bruised
[1:09:09] bearing our sorrow did it happen yes
[1:09:12] because Isaiah spoke it the scripture
[1:09:14] spoken it happened because he's loyal to
[1:09:17] his word
[1:09:19] he said he'd raise a prophet like under
[1:09:20] Moses he said he'd be a savior he said
[1:09:23] he'd be a Healer he'd be a member of the
[1:09:25] Brokenhearted he said he'd send the Holy
[1:09:28] Spirit did it happen yes it did
[1:09:33] whether you want to say so or not it did
[1:09:35] because God is going to keep his promise
[1:09:41] you know if God could keep a covenant
[1:09:43] promise 400 and something years in the
[1:09:44] making you know to humanity that's a
[1:09:46] long time
[1:09:47] you'd be like that wow that's like let's
[1:09:49] put the watch on here this is we're in
[1:09:50] for Long Haul
[1:09:51] but God is tireless
[1:09:53] and he waited for it
[1:09:55] but if God can make sure that that
[1:09:57] happened through the course of
[1:09:58] generations you don't think that he's
[1:10:01] still able to ensure that his promises
[1:10:03] happen today
[1:10:05] I'd say if he can do that he can do
[1:10:07] anything
[1:10:08] if he can bring Humanity through a
[1:10:10] series of time bring it through a
[1:10:11] certain aspects and Junctions he can
[1:10:13] have prophets of hold through the
[1:10:14] hundreds and thousands of years speak
[1:10:16] certain things and then they happen all
[1:10:17] like this and then happen in one man
[1:10:19] Jesus Christ and prophecy fulfilled if
[1:10:21] he can do that do you think that he's
[1:10:24] can fulfill everything he said for this
[1:10:25] day
[1:10:28] John 14 18 I will not leave you comfort
[1:10:29] us but I will come to you
[1:10:32] amen yet a little while the world see me
[1:10:34] no more but see me because I live ye
[1:10:36] shall live also at that days you know
[1:10:38] I'm in the father ye and me and I in you
[1:10:40] Matthew 28 teaching them the last verse
[1:10:43] in Matthew lo I am with you always
[1:10:47] faithful one so unchanging loyal one
[1:10:51] always this last verse in Matthew always
[1:10:56] amen
[1:10:58] even to the end of the world it's second
[1:11:01] Timothy 2 13 if we believe not
[1:11:03] listen to this if we believe not this is
[1:11:06] scripture
[1:11:07] yet he abideth faithful
[1:11:10] he cannot deny himself
[1:11:14] I want you to ponder that scripture for
[1:11:16] just a little bit there was a time when
[1:11:18] you were lost in sin in wickedness and
[1:11:21] trespass in Dark Places maybe a time
[1:11:24] you're in a low low valley but he cannot
[1:11:26] as scripture says deny what
[1:11:29] himself who are you
[1:11:33] who are you
[1:11:38] we're Believers you've read the message
[1:11:40] what's inside of you
[1:11:43] himself because he's deposited his seed
[1:11:47] in you and that's why through the
[1:11:50] darkest of valleys even when scripture
[1:11:52] says if we believe not when you are in
[1:11:54] sin and trespass but he could not deny
[1:11:57] himself he would be faithful always to
[1:12:00] pick you up out of the muck in the mire
[1:12:02] and say there's a time when so and so
[1:12:05] I've got a time appointed I'm faithful
[1:12:07] I'm that God and I'm going to raise him
[1:12:09] up at that time
[1:12:13] you're his word you're a people that
[1:12:15] have eaten the book
[1:12:16] a man you've become the word he's
[1:12:19] faithful to you always faithful
[1:12:22] you have he quickened I wrote down here
[1:12:26] a god who's rich in Mercy loyalty to his
[1:12:29] seed and I wrote down
[1:12:32] he even went through hell for you
[1:12:36] that's your God
[1:12:38] he even went down to hell for you
[1:12:41] men might use that as some cursed phrase
[1:12:43] no he went there for you and I and
[1:12:47] stripped the keys that's your loyal God
[1:12:56] and you hathy quickened who are dead and
[1:12:59] trespasses in sin where in times past
[1:13:01] you watch according to the course of
[1:13:02] this world according to the prince of
[1:13:03] the power of the air but God who is rich
[1:13:06] in Mercy who is rich in faithfulness who
[1:13:09] is rich in love who's rich in his
[1:13:10] loyalty to his people loyalty to his
[1:13:13] word and if you are the word he cannot
[1:13:16] reject you
[1:13:22] even when we were dead in sin
[1:13:24] have quickened us together
[1:13:27] with Christ amen you would play a little
[1:13:30] video for me I'm going to take a a
[1:13:31] little switch here or jerk your
[1:13:33] attention
[1:13:34] just one minute minute and a half of
[1:13:35] video
[1:13:38] I need sound
[1:13:51] but
[1:13:52] me means we're holding each other
[1:13:54] accountable
[1:13:59] stands for always faithful to the Core
[1:14:02] never turn your back on it
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:06] what is someone that you can rely on
[1:14:08] like one time they're going to get tough
[1:14:09] you know that there's going to be
[1:14:10] someone there to back you up and it's
[1:14:12] going to be your fellow Marine that's on
[1:14:13] your left or your right
[1:14:15] so we're always faithful we're always
[1:14:16] there with each other we'll always be
[1:14:18] fighting for each other if we have
[1:14:19] nothing else left at the end of the day
[1:14:26] I will never be a part of anything else
[1:14:28] as big as this
[1:14:35] I think it speaks volumes of the
[1:14:37] character of Marines past present
[1:14:40] about what we both treat ourselves
[1:14:42] always faithful to each other to our
[1:14:45] country and to our families
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:15:00] Eternal Bond
[1:15:01] hey I'm not even American I'm proud of
[1:15:03] them
[1:15:04] soldiers
[1:15:07] but they don't have an eternal Bond
[1:15:11] like you and I have I'm sorry they might
[1:15:15] carry the motto Semper Fidelis hmm
[1:15:18] but I said no way I was studying halfway
[1:15:20] through I had a totally different title
[1:15:21] and I came across that he said um that's
[1:15:22] my title that's exactly what my motto is
[1:15:25] always faithful always loyal that's what
[1:15:28] it means I'm sorry but at least one lady
[1:15:31] said I'll never be involved in something
[1:15:33] bigger than this sorry there is
[1:15:35] something bigger let's call it a battle
[1:15:37] for life and death and there's an army
[1:15:40] that's raging against the enemy and I'm
[1:15:42] part of that big army
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:46] I'd take semper fidelis my way you know
[1:15:49] what they say about that it demons to
[1:15:51] demonstrate that in Practical terms new
[1:15:53] recruits are told story after story of
[1:15:56] how Marines sacrificed in combat to
[1:15:59] remain faithful to their fellow Warriors
[1:16:00] and so they're constantly telling each
[1:16:02] other of a warrior I've gone by they're
[1:16:05] telling each other of a shamgar they're
[1:16:07] telling each other assumption they're
[1:16:09] telling each other of a David of people
[1:16:12] gone by saying you know them except for
[1:16:14] Philadelphia
[1:16:15] you know that person except for Phil
[1:16:17] Dallas you know any bisco except for
[1:16:19] Dallas
[1:16:22] look to each other and you say hey
[1:16:24] Stanford Dallas
[1:16:28] putting their lives at risk to save all
[1:16:29] the Marines refusing to leave one of
[1:16:31] their own behind alive or dead
[1:16:37] that's this Earth
[1:16:38] but not dead in this light in eternity
[1:16:41] because this semper fidelis this army
[1:16:43] goes through a prayer meeting on a
[1:16:44] Monday night and they're praying for
[1:16:46] those that are wounded those that are
[1:16:48] somewhere left in a battle and they're
[1:16:50] saying nah devil we're fighting we're
[1:16:53] going to be going to Warfare we're going
[1:16:55] to be telling each other semper fidelis
[1:16:57] always painful
[1:17:01] we can talk about Peter and Noah
[1:17:03] different ones who risk their life think
[1:17:04] about John the Baptist they would have
[1:17:06] been telling each other do you know what
[1:17:07] he did he put his life on the line he
[1:17:09] was preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:17:11] they cut off his head Semper Fidelis
[1:17:17] faithful loyal
[1:17:20] families moving here and there trying to
[1:17:22] uproot their families to grow and go
[1:17:23] maybe go to church many of you moved in
[1:17:25] here so your children could be in a
[1:17:27] school you're sacrificing your
[1:17:28] livelihoods you're sacrificing her ease
[1:17:30] why you're faithful to the cause you're
[1:17:32] faithful to the words I need whatever I
[1:17:34] can for my children Semper Fidelis
[1:17:38] story after Story
[1:17:40] encouraging each other in the faithful
[1:17:42] gone by and the faithful that are
[1:17:43] present
[1:17:45] you know what the rest says
[1:17:47] it says in many of the stories
[1:17:50] one Marine made a conscious decision to
[1:17:53] die
[1:17:54] in order to save the lives of others
[1:17:57] and so they tell the story this one died
[1:18:00] and it would start to well up something
[1:18:02] some comrade ship loyal to the Core
[1:18:09] and this commitment to semper fidelis
[1:18:10] was one of the reasons Marines enjoy the
[1:18:13] well-deserved reputation for Valor in
[1:18:16] combat
[1:18:18] because they encourage each other
[1:18:20] telling each other of different counts
[1:18:22] because they go to like I said and they
[1:18:25] gather together they edify but I said
[1:18:27] let me tell you
[1:18:28] of a story of all time of one that gave
[1:18:32] his life on a cross for you and I it is
[1:18:36] a no Marine which I respect but the king
[1:18:38] of glory came down to a stable to save
[1:18:41] Mankind and give salvation for all oh
[1:18:44] that's them for Fidelity that's always
[1:18:47] faithful
[1:18:51] I will sing of my redeemer and its
[1:18:54] precious love for me on a cruel crossy
[1:18:56] suburb paid the dead and made me free
[1:18:59] single thing
[1:19:02] that's what I'll say to the next one
[1:19:04] that builds up
[1:19:06] Valor in combat
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:10] that's why they can say Leave No Man
[1:19:12] Behind
[1:19:13] comes into play here with the Marines
[1:19:15] it's burned into their being
[1:19:17] it becomes part of really who they are
[1:19:20] far be it
[1:19:21] from an Earthly Army Corps
[1:19:24] to have more Valor more loyalty more
[1:19:27] comment ship more faithfulness than the
[1:19:31] armies of the Living God
[1:19:34] Instagram
[1:19:37] that's why each one of us young old
[1:19:39] middle-aged teenage you need to be
[1:19:41] walking down the hallway at school he
[1:19:43] said how you doing
[1:19:44] Senator Fidelis faithful loyal or are
[1:19:48] you just pretending we don't need
[1:19:49] feigned loyalty
[1:19:51] not feigned loyalty
[1:19:54] because what happens there after a time
[1:19:56] I don't have time to get into it that
[1:19:59] that manifests itself
[1:20:01] so if you need loyalty you need to
[1:20:03] pledge allegiance not to No Flag but to
[1:20:05] the word
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] maybe it's in your bedroom

[1:21:00] for you and me
