Description:
61 0411 But It Wasn't So From The Beginning-3: William Marrion Branham 
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
many of us people electing a our pastor for our church we want somebody that's really brilliant smart got PhD wld D qst all kinds of things behind their name and maybe knows more about God than a Hot and Hot knows about an Egyptian night now that's true now that's a rude remark forgive the rude expression but that's true he might know all kinds of Bible theology and Creeds but knows nothing about God I'd rather have a man with my child leading the god that didn't know the difference between split beans and coffee and and no God in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and I have all the theology that you could talk about and taking him some big p seat somewhere kneeling down and say a few things I'd rather have him out there in a corn fer in the broom Sage patch by a stump somewhere praying through to God that's right go back to the original
