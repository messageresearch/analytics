Description:
60-1225 God's Wrapped Gift-2: WIlliam Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the rich high- minded people are the denominations of their days they were turned down flat not only in that day but in this day also they turn it down flat they don't come wrapped the way they want it they want to discard it say there's nothing to it so the rich and the denominations refuse that gift they had nothing to do with it why why would they do a thing like that it wasn't wrapped in the custom of their Creeds amen that's the reason why today that they don't want the gift of Goden amen this United States don't want God these churches don't want God Amen that's right they want Santa Claus they want something with pencil and red colors and and and and shiny things amen they refuse the truth of the Gospel of the power and the resurrection of Christ Jesus Hallelujah it won't wrap with their Creeds you can't wrap Christ in a Creed
