[19:56] Lord, as brother Ryan has been leading
[19:59] in songs and worship, God, it just seems
[20:02] so wonderful to be in the house of God
[20:04] this morning.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; You are my help.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; You're the helper of everyone that read
[20:11] a a request down this morning and penned
[20:14] it down. Lord, you're Sister Joan's
[20:17] help.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; God, you are our strength giver. You are
[20:22] the almighty God.
[20:24] And then Lord, as we realize you are our
[20:26] help and it's already done, the three
[20:29] greatest words that were ever spoken, it
[20:32] is finished,
[20:33] Lord, the supreme sacrifice came at
[20:36] Calvary. And today, Lord, according to
[20:39] our faith, it is finished, Lord. Every
[20:44] need that is here this morning, it's
[20:46] already done by the supreme sacrifice
[20:49] himself, the Jesus Christ, the living
[20:52] word. You came, you died, you rose
[20:56] again, and you said, "Because I live,
[20:59] you shall live also." We are testifying
[21:02] of that life this morning.
[21:07] We are the living church of the living
[21:10] God this morning. And we've come to
[21:12] worship you and to adore you. You're our
[21:15] husband. You're our bridegroom. You're
[21:17] our redeemer. You're our healer. You're
[21:20] our savior. You're our victory. You're
[21:23] everything to us, Lord.
[21:27] Jesus, we bless your holy name. We ask,
[21:30] God, that you will touch every need and
[21:33] meet every request this morning. Father,
[21:36] we've come to meet with you and have an
[21:39] encounter with God. Lord, you know,
[21:41] every area of our lives. If there's
[21:44] something, Lord, that you would like to
[21:45] deal with, we want to lay our lives open
[21:48] and say, "Oh, God, take away and burn
[21:51] out the draws, let the word come in
[21:53] power. Let it come in demonstration. May
[21:56] you anoint the servant of God this
[21:58] morning. May you take, brother Ed in a
[22:00] special way. May the channels of God
[22:03] open to us, Lord. Let our eyes of
[22:06] understanding be opened up at last. Let
[22:08] the spirit of wisdom and in the
[22:10] knowledge of him be our portion we pray.
[22:14] Bless your people. Meet every need. Be
[22:18] glorified amongst us. Lord, we don't
[22:20] want to end this worship. We want to be
[22:22] objects of worship as we lift up that
[22:25] name of Jesus. We pray now that you'll
[22:28] meet every need, every spoken and
[22:30] unspoken. And may you be glorified
[22:33] through their lives.

[37:49] And when the praise
[37:53] [Music]
[37:54] of life
[37:56] and son
[37:58] will shed for us,
[38:03] his preious blood.
[38:08] Oh, and his love
[38:13] will remember
[38:15] [Music]
[38:17] and can see
[38:22] to sing his praise.
[38:27] We will live
[38:30] [Music]
[38:32] for God's hand.
[38:36] through our hands.
[38:40] eternal ways on the mount and on the
[38:46] ground
[38:47] [Music]
[38:49] of crucifixion
[38:53] both fountains open
[38:57] [Music]
[38:59] and wide
[39:00] [Music]
[39:02] as through the love
[39:07] gates of
[39:08] God's mercy
[39:11] There was a
[39:14] [Music]
[39:16] and gracious
[39:18] time.
[39:20] Oh, and with love
[39:24] will not remember.
[39:29] And you
[39:31] all who can cease to sing
[39:35] his praise.
[39:38] for he
[39:42] worthy
[39:44] for God.
[39:47] Well, through our
[39:51] eternal
[39:53] grace and love. Oh, and grace and love.
[40:00] Like mighty rivers
[40:04] they flow in
[40:07] [Music]
[40:10] above
[40:13] as heaven's peace
[40:17] and perfect justice.
[40:22] They kissed the guilty
[40:26] world
[40:28] in love.
[40:33] Oh, his love
[40:37] will not remember. And who can see
[40:44] to sing his praise?
[40:48] And he will live
[40:52] [Music]
[40:54] for God's hand
[40:56] or through ahead.
[41:01] I see the course again. Who is love? Oh,
[41:05] and you love
[41:13] [Music]
[41:28] [Music]
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:36] [Music]
[41:41] Hallelujah.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Well, we are uh
[41:52] we're in the after effects, the ripple
[41:54] effects of the of the wedding that took
[41:57] place and uh we rejoiced with the young
[42:00] couple that were married and brother
[42:03] Kyle and brother John took the ceremony
[42:07] and it was really really special. But
[42:09] we're now here on the Lord's day.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Special day.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] Feel his divine presence.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're so thankful for what he's
[42:28] done in our time.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to uh I'm going to be
[42:34] speaking to you in a few moments and I'm
[42:38] going to speak to you on Enoch's
[42:41] expectation.
[42:43] Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And I would like you to be mindful
[42:46] during the service, during the reading,
[42:50] some of the reading of the scriptures,
[42:51] fairly lengthy, but I'd like you to
[42:54] prepare yourself and even pray now. God,
[42:57] give me insight. I've read those
[42:59] scriptures before, but give me insight
[43:02] in the light of the message.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Because this message came to reveal
[43:07] Jesus Christ.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what people miss so much
[43:11] when we talk about the message. They get
[43:14] caught up in the, you know, the
[43:17] semantics or they get caught up in the
[43:20] uh some mental reasoning or some
[43:24] precision of it and fail to realize that
[43:28] the purpose of the message is to reveal
[43:30] Jesus Christ.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ is this word.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can read volumes of
[43:38] scripture and people do
[43:40] &gt;&gt; millions today have the scripture in
[43:43] their home or in their church or
[43:45] wherever more on their lap uh in a
[43:48] service but don't understand what it
[43:51] really says. And so I I trust that you
[43:55] will be able to um grasp even more. I'm
[44:00] just I'm I feel real urgency to pour out
[44:04] all that is within my heart uh as much
[44:08] as possible for the hour that we're in.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And when we think of Enoch, we sometimes
[44:17] think of, well, Enoch walked with God
[44:20] and he was not for God took him. It
[44:23] sounds so nice and, you know, so quiet
[44:26] and so peaceful.
[44:28] But I'm going to read a scripture which
[44:31] you have read many times where Bible
[44:33] says that Enoch prophesied of the
[44:36] judgment of God.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; And he didn't prophesy for a service or
[44:41] a week or an hour on the Sabbath day. He
[44:44] prophesied for probably 330 years.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; And he saw it coming. And so this is
[44:52] some of the things that I want to go
[44:54] into.
[44:56] Um, but before we do, I want to make a
[44:59] formal announcement
[45:02] with regards to uh the website that's
[45:05] been known as the Believe the Sign,
[45:08] which is quite a paradox.
[45:11] Uh,
[45:14] because I've had I've had some inquiry.
[45:17] I've had some phone calls, not many, uh,
[45:20] two or three, but I think they're
[45:22] important and people want to know. And
[45:24] so we have many that are streaming
[45:26] today, perhaps many more streaming than
[45:29] are actually sitting here in the
[45:30] service. And so I want them to know and
[45:33] the question has been uh presented to
[45:35] me. Is it our website? No, it's not our
[45:39] website. Never has been our website. And
[45:42] so I just want to give some
[45:44] excuse me some former ex uh for formal
[45:48] explanation.
[45:50] Neither Cloverdale Bible Way nor Bible
[45:52] Believers
[45:54] have ever been connected or have
[45:57] sponsored have not sponsored uh the
[46:01] website Believe the Sign. This website
[46:04] has absolutely no connection with this
[46:08] church or with Bible believers.
[46:13] Uh several years ago, a brother who at
[46:16] that time attended this church expressed
[46:19] a desire to uh design a website to make
[46:23] known the supernatural things which took
[46:27] place in brother Brandham's ministry.
[46:31] Uh thus believe the sign website was
[46:33] produced and became available to
[46:37] internet users.
[46:39] Many church and other websites including
[46:42] our own had a link to believe the sign
[46:46] website
[46:47] and it could be found on many many
[46:50] different websites. Uh the brother who
[46:52] designed the website left this church
[46:54] about 3 years ago
[46:57] and some months ago
[47:00] so I hope you're following that. Some
[47:02] months ago, I became aware
[47:05] uh that believe the signed website was
[47:08] carrying material from authors opposed
[47:13] to brother Brham's ministry. And they
[47:16] referred to the article as prophecies
[47:18] and I deny that they are not prophecies.
[47:23] And if you say they're prophecies, I
[47:24] want to know under whose authority they
[47:27] are claimed to be uh prophecies. It
[47:30] would be good for the authors of the
[47:33] supporters of the website, Believe the
[47:35] Sign, to go on to Google and find out
[47:38] how many false prophecies those authors
[47:41] made.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; I immediately gave instructions to
[47:50] remove the link
[47:53] uh to believe the sign website from our
[47:55] website. And this was actually done
[47:57] within minutes of my uh being made aware
[48:02] of the material they were carrying.
[48:04] Incidentally, the material they were
[48:05] carrying certainly wasn't new to me.
[48:08] It's old stuff.
[48:12] And uh prophecies coming 50 years after
[48:15] the fact.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; I thought a prophecy is foretelling.
[48:26] We do not support this material.
[48:30] There is in my view they're false
[48:32] prophecies.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And so I say to this congregation and
[48:37] all that will hear my voice now or on
[48:39] the archives. Let the blind lead the
[48:41] blind.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with believers.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Don't occupy yourself with it.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Well, it's on this it's on this social
[48:51] network. Forget the social network.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Our social network is called a
[48:56] vindicated message.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; That's where we have our our society in
[49:03] our gathering.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; And I hope that you remember that.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:08] It's indeed sad that men who once
[49:11] fellowshipped
[49:13] as believers and partook in communion
[49:16] and footwashing were baptized in the
[49:19] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:21] have become and I say this respectfully
[49:24] enemies
[49:26] &gt;&gt; of the very re revelation of Jesus
[49:28] Christ.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; To say that brother Brandham was not the
[49:32] fulfillment of Malachi 4 to me is almost
[49:36] blasphemous.
[49:39] And I would say anyone who takes that
[49:42] position is standing on very very
[49:45] dangerous ground.
[49:49] I cannot think of anything more
[49:50] frightening
[49:53] &gt;&gt; than to become associated
[49:56] with this kind of
[50:00] uh
[50:01] direction
[50:04] or I will say to become associated with
[50:08] those that have become enemies of the
[50:10] revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:14] &gt;&gt; according to Luke 17:30
[50:17] to deny I that the prophet of God was
[50:21] sent to reveal Jesus Christ is to is to
[50:25] take away the very foundations of my
[50:28] life.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; How many others?
[50:34] &gt;&gt; This message was lifechanging.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; I heard all those prophecies 50 years
[50:42] ago and more. Listen to me folks. I
[50:45] experienced all this stuff. This was
[50:48] full of confusion.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Absolute confusion.
[50:52] Multitudes were confused and are still
[50:55] confused.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; And a few words out of this messenger's
[51:00] mouth
[51:01] &gt;&gt; just resolved and took away all the
[51:04] questions, took away all the cloud. And
[51:07] you young younger generation who have
[51:09] not experienced that, take it from an
[51:11] eyewitness and take it from someone. I'm
[51:15] glad that my testimony as far to my
[51:17] knowledge has never been on that site
[51:19] and and I would have gladly have given
[51:22] it but I'm glad it's not there today.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; And to those
[51:29] who perhaps signed on with this
[51:32] influence but perhaps today are not in
[51:36] favor would not support it. It would be
[51:38] a good thing for them to ask within
[51:40] themselves, when were the seeds
[51:44] &gt;&gt; of this doubt actually sown in those
[51:47] hearts
[51:49] &gt;&gt; and did they sign on with it, not
[51:51] realizing or should have perhaps been
[51:54] given some divine understanding, divine
[51:57] discernment. I'll tell you what, we need
[51:59] discerning of spirits in these days.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily discerning of people,
[52:04] discerning of spirits. That's what the
[52:06] Bible says.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; There's only two forces. The prophet
[52:13] said,
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Satan and God.
[52:19] And what's Satan's weapon against you is
[52:23] to try to get you to disbelieve your
[52:25] weapon.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And he disarms you. Right?
[52:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "If he can get you to
[52:31] disbelieve your weapon,
[52:34] &gt;&gt; that your weapon is equivalent,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; if he gets you to believe that your
[52:40] weapon is not strong enough,
[52:43] he's disarmed you.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; He wants you to know your weapon is
[52:48] strong enough.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Is equivalent to anything he can cast at
[52:52] you or more."
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; He disarms you. And when he gets you to
[52:57] disbelieve that weapon, when you lay
[53:01] that down, that finishes your fight,
[53:05] you've you're done. Hold that weapon.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Don't you lay it down.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; We see we see his unbelief and he's been
[53:14] a unbeliever from the beginning.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] I wanted to needed to make that
[53:25] Jesus said
[53:27] in Matthew 24
[53:29] and Luke 21 I believe and Mark in Mark's
[53:34] gospel as well but Luke 21:31
[53:37] they describe the conditions and I will
[53:39] be speaking of these conditions some
[53:42] today he described the conditions of the
[53:45] end time and now listen friends I I
[53:49] don't want you just be here at a church
[53:51] service. I want you to be here as a
[53:54] participant and by your presence you are
[53:57] stating I am believing this end time
[54:02] message.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[54:05] &gt;&gt; All right. And in so doing Jesus
[54:08] described the conditions of our time. It
[54:10] shouldn't take us unawares. He described
[54:12] the conditions of our time and he said
[54:15] when you see these things,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; he didn't say be downhearted or be
[54:19] downcast or to be clouded over. When you
[54:22] see these things, we rejoice
[54:26] &gt;&gt; because these things were to take place.
[54:28] And when we see them, it should inspire
[54:31] faith
[54:33] &gt;&gt; in our hearts.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; These things must be.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; And it may get worse. Some ages had
[54:41] physical persecution and now in this age
[54:44] it becomes more a mind thing
[54:48] because that's a mind generation mind
[54:51] age. Well, and I'm going to be having
[54:54] some slides a little later on, but I
[54:56] want to um I I want to sing a verse or
[54:59] two of a song and have you stand with me
[55:01] and you'll sing my pace. Musicians,
[55:05] uh what is it? Beautiful robe.
[55:11] What a number.
[55:13] Hallelujah.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] Uh, do we have it up? What is it?
[55:33] Beautiful robe. We got it up.
[55:36] Beautiful
[55:44] home. Beautiful robe.
[55:47] Just a moment here. Beautiful rope. So
[55:50] white. All right. Here we are.
[55:55] Okay. Give us a star.
[55:57] Do you know it?
[56:00] Beautiful
[56:02] land of thy
[56:06] soul
[56:08] where there shall come your night
[56:12] beautiful crown
[56:14] where shining with stars or there yonder

[56:51] Beautiful father.
[56:54] We shall forever

[57:11] [Music]
[57:13] Beautiful.
[57:16] Beautiful.
[57:19] [Music]
[57:25] [Music]
[57:35] [Music]
[57:38] bright
[57:42] beautiful things on My God
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] is
[57:52] my
[57:54] [Music]
[58:02] sorrow.
[58:04] Heat. Heat.
[58:10] [Music]
[58:19] [Music]
[58:26] [Music]
[58:31] Second verse once again. Beautiful
[58:34] thought to me. We are forever.

[59:04] [Music]
[59:06] Oh,

[59:11] Beautiful

[59:17] Beautiful manion
[59:20] gather us there.
[59:23] [Music]
[59:24] Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Next Sunday, the second is
[59:31] the last Sunday before school starts.
[59:34] School starts the following week. And we
[59:36] want to spend some of the morning
[59:38] service in the direction of uh we're
[59:42] going to have prayer naturally for all
[59:44] the families and the young people, the
[59:47] children, but it's not just a school. We
[59:50] want to give our thoughts towards what
[59:53] the that effort and the sacrifice that
[59:57] was put in bringing that building
[59:59] together in that facility and the
[1:00:02] teachers that will be here and the
[1:00:04] principal our brother Terry Tatch and
[1:00:07] his wife Shel've been working hard and
[1:00:09] many others. We want you to be mindful
[1:00:12] of what that is to produce. It is to
[1:00:16] bring forth, cultivate young men, young
[1:00:19] ladies for the kingdom of God. That's
[1:00:22] the purpose of it. And uh while I have
[1:00:26] that in mind, so that's next Sunday the
[1:00:28] second. And we want to say that brother
[1:00:31] David and Naomi Roy are happy to
[1:00:35] announce the arrival of Arajoy.
[1:00:39] Ara is the pronunciation.
[1:00:43] born on Friday, August the 24th,
[1:00:46] weighing 6 lb 6 oz. And when she weighs
[1:00:50] a little bit more and is a few more
[1:00:52] years under her belt, I trust you'll be
[1:00:55] over there if we're not up there.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, I'd like to have
[1:01:02] your full attention as we turn to the
[1:01:03] scripture.
[1:01:06] And incidentally, just a a moment uh
[1:01:10] before we're going to read the
[1:01:11] scripture, you know, when I make a
[1:01:13] formal announcement such as I did, don't
[1:01:16] be caught up with the atmosphere of
[1:01:19] Leodysa. Oh, we don't want to step on
[1:01:22] anybody's toes. Jesus stepped on lots of
[1:01:25] people's toes.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And he said it the way it is.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; And that's the way we've got to be,
[1:01:31] friends. And we don't only have, you
[1:01:33] know, uplifting things, but we also have
[1:01:35] warnings.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And those of you, I ask if you have your
[1:01:40] Bibles today, if you're here and you
[1:01:42] don't have a Bible and you haven't
[1:01:43] brought a Bible, bring your Bible to
[1:01:45] church
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; so that you have it so we can read it
[1:01:48] together. All right. I'll have you turn
[1:01:51] in your Bibles to Genesis, the 5th
[1:01:53] chapter. We have two places where we're
[1:01:56] going to read. Genesis 5 and also Luke,
[1:02:02] I'm sorry, Jude.
[1:02:20] All right, let's just bow our heads in
[1:02:22] prayer.
[1:02:25] Almighty God,
[1:02:29] creator of heavens and earth and giver
[1:02:32] of every good gift,
[1:02:34] we are so dependent upon you.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; We are so in love, oh God, with you.
[1:02:42] just uh even this morning and yesterday
[1:02:46] and this morning especially, Father,
[1:02:50] seeing your hand move in such a mighty
[1:02:53] supernatural way
[1:02:55] uh uh uh and vindicating and confirming
[1:02:59] your divine presence, the supernatural
[1:03:03] God. Confirm your presence here this
[1:03:06] morning, Lord. We've seen, Father, where
[1:03:09] you've come and have met needs of
[1:03:11] individuals, Lord, and let our needs be
[1:03:15] met. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:18] Father, I pray that you will do
[1:03:20] something of such a special nature for
[1:03:23] the individuals that are here, we've
[1:03:26] gathered here with a divine purpose and
[1:03:29] a divine expectation. And as I seek to
[1:03:32] approach God Enoch's expectation, I pray
[1:03:36] that we will translate it to our
[1:03:38] expectation
[1:03:40] in the name of Jesus Christ and for his
[1:03:42] glory alone, for no flesh shall glory in
[1:03:45] his presence. Amen.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Starting at the 21st verse. And Enoch
[1:03:54] lived 60 and five years and begat
[1:03:58] Methuselah.
[1:04:00] And Enoch walked with God after he begat
[1:04:03] Methuselah
[1:04:04] 300 years and begat sons and daughters.
[1:04:08] And all the days of Enoch were 365
[1:04:11] years. And Enoch walked with God, and he
[1:04:15] was not, for God took him.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And then I'd like to have you turn to
[1:04:22] the book of Jude,
[1:04:25] which is the little book just before
[1:04:27] Revelation.
[1:04:29] And there's only one chapter in it,
[1:04:34] 25 verses.
[1:04:38] I will read verse 14 and 15.
[1:04:42] And Enoch also the seventh from Adam
[1:04:46] prophesied of these, saying, "Behold,
[1:04:50] the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his
[1:04:52] saints to execute judgment upon all, and
[1:04:57] to convince all that are ungodly among
[1:05:01] them, of all their ungodly deeds which
[1:05:04] they have ungodly committed, and of all
[1:05:07] their hard speeches which ungodly
[1:05:11] sinners have spoken,
[1:05:12] against him.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; It's amazing that Enoch was involved
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; in that kind of ministry.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Say, Enoch walked with God. The truth of
[1:05:25] the matter is Enoch prophesied and
[1:05:28] preached this kind of gospel
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; to execute judgment.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. because the because the the whole
[1:05:37] the whole civilization of his time was
[1:05:40] going so weward and was so uh God was so
[1:05:44] displeased and he preached for many many
[1:05:48] years and prophesied and that faith that
[1:05:52] gave him faith when he saw those
[1:05:54] conditions that gave him faith for his
[1:05:57] rapture.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[1:06:04] I'd like your kind attention and just
[1:06:07] little as movement as possible please.
[1:06:11] Enoch is a type of the raptured church
[1:06:14] in the great coming revival. Brother
[1:06:17] Brandham said in that message and Enoch
[1:06:19] of course was a type of the raptured
[1:06:22] group of the church.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Notice how he says the raptured group of
[1:06:26] the church.
[1:06:28] Enoch was raptured. This is in the
[1:06:32] rapture message. Now, Enoch was
[1:06:34] raptured, the seventh, showing that it's
[1:06:37] the seventh church age that takes the
[1:06:40] rapture. And now, there's no doubt that
[1:06:43] we're living in the seventh church age.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I just want to say very, very directly,
[1:06:49] what do we expect in this day and age?
[1:06:52] Do we expect an easy time? Are we
[1:06:54] expecting a flowery bed of roses to go?
[1:06:58] No, we don't expect that. This is a
[1:07:01] battle and the prophet said we're going
[1:07:02] to fight for every inch of the way.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] When I see,
[1:07:11] you know, or even sense an attitude of
[1:07:14] kind of, you know, just easy and go
[1:07:16] along with things and I I resist that
[1:07:20] very much because that is not the
[1:07:23] program of God's believers. It's not
[1:07:26] been the program of the church. It's not
[1:07:27] the program of believers. It wasn't how
[1:07:30] the church was birthed and soon as soon
[1:07:33] as the uh spirit of God, the Holy Spirit
[1:07:37] came and filled the believers. They
[1:07:39] immediately were persecuted.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; They immediately had opposition. Is that
[1:07:44] not true?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And if the church has anything less than
[1:07:47] that, then there's something wrong with
[1:07:49] the church.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; And and uh you know in in this day and
[1:07:54] age when we look at the world, it's just
[1:07:56] all accept everybody just for what they
[1:07:59] are and so on and so forth. That's not
[1:08:01] the believer's position.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said, you know, in his
[1:08:06] time there was the the theme was we're
[1:08:08] all one.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; So he just said clearly, we're not one.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You're not one with some of that stuff.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And you want to you want to say glory to
[1:08:19] God. I'm glad I'm not one with all of
[1:08:22] that.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; There are two things that I am wanting
[1:08:28] to draw your attention to and I'm going
[1:08:30] to watch my time, but uh I I I want this
[1:08:34] service to be a blessing to you. Uh
[1:08:36] there's two things about Enoch's life.
[1:08:39] In fact, there's about three uh that uh
[1:08:43] uh that refer to us. Number one, the
[1:08:47] conditions that existed
[1:08:50] and which Enoch had to live in. We don't
[1:08:53] often think of that. In fact, this I
[1:08:55] have to say myself and I make a
[1:08:57] confession. I've thought of Enoch, you
[1:08:59] know, he walked with God and and he was
[1:09:02] not for God took him. We think just how
[1:09:04] wonderful that is. But we forget that he
[1:09:06] lived for many, many years with se
[1:09:10] severe and stiff opposition. And he
[1:09:12] preached a message that is not easy to
[1:09:14] preach and lived a life that was not
[1:09:17] that easy to live.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; But Enoch walked hearing the voice of
[1:09:23] God. And this is really the the crux of
[1:09:27] my message this morning. Walking with
[1:09:29] the voice. He walked with God. But God
[1:09:32] wasn't just some silent distant form or
[1:09:36] force someplace. God God had allowed him
[1:09:40] to know that the the direction the
[1:09:42] people were leave living was a direction
[1:09:45] of destruction.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; It was going to be a fierce destruction.
[1:09:49] And friends, I want to say that the
[1:09:51] destruction that this world is headed
[1:09:53] for now is is not like the one they went
[1:09:57] through which was water but this this
[1:09:59] time it's fire. Right.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And the third thing, the intimate
[1:10:06] relationship of walking with and in the
[1:10:09] word of God put Enoch into a state of
[1:10:14] heightened expectation. Now, when you
[1:10:17] expect something, if you expect some
[1:10:19] friends or if you expect some family to
[1:10:21] come and say, "Well, uh, our family's
[1:10:24] going to come and visit, uh, you know,
[1:10:26] three weeks from now." Well, you start
[1:10:29] getting excited, but as the time draws
[1:10:32] near, someone you haven't seen, someone
[1:10:34] that is dear, someone that is precious
[1:10:36] to you, oh, and you're so anxious to see
[1:10:39] them, and the day comes. Well, you're
[1:10:42] you're you're listening for every sound.
[1:10:44] Was that the car that drove up? Uh, you
[1:10:47] know, you're looking for them at the
[1:10:49] door. You're just so excited. What does
[1:10:52] excitement do? It and and usually it
[1:10:54] causes you to prepare. Well, I I've got
[1:10:57] to prepare the room where they're going
[1:10:58] to be. We're going to buy some extra
[1:11:00] food. We're going to do things because
[1:11:02] you get into expectation and other
[1:11:04] things that come in the way. No, I can't
[1:11:07] have that appointment. I can't do this
[1:11:09] because we're having our family is
[1:11:11] coming or something is happening and and
[1:11:14] that's the way we get and uh and perhaps
[1:11:17] you could even get uh you could get, you
[1:11:20] know, really under pressure uh of of
[1:11:23] some something else. And but you you get
[1:11:26] desperate.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; You can get desperate. Expectation can
[1:11:30] put you into desperation.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; And I want to say as it says in Matthew,
[1:11:41] but and if that evil servant shall say
[1:11:43] in his heart, "My lord delayeth his
[1:11:45] coming," and shall begin to smite his
[1:11:47] fellow servants, and to eat and drink
[1:11:49] with the drunken, uh the Lord of that
[1:11:52] servant shall come in a day when he
[1:11:54] lookth not for him, and in an hour that
[1:11:58] he's not aware of. We don't want uh that
[1:12:01] hour. We don't want that attitude to
[1:12:04] come upon us in a in an when he's not
[1:12:07] looking for him. He says, "Well, he
[1:12:09] delays the coming." And uh we say,
[1:12:11] "Well, people have been looking for the
[1:12:13] Lord to come for for centuries." And now
[1:12:16] here we are. And he and the scripture
[1:12:18] says, "And he shall cut him aunderder
[1:12:20] and appoint him his portion with the
[1:12:22] hypocrites. They shall be there shall be
[1:12:24] weeping and nashing of teeth." I want to
[1:12:28] say emphatically that I believe I
[1:12:32] believe with everything that's in me
[1:12:33] that there's a people on the earth now
[1:12:37] that are the antitype of Enoch's type.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; There's a people on the earth now that
[1:12:48] are walking with God in the faith once
[1:12:51] delivered to the saints. Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; There's a people on the earth now that
[1:12:57] have heard the voice of God in another
[1:12:59] garden
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; called Satan's Eden.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And we've heard his voice in this
[1:13:06] garden. And we're walking with it.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; As Enoch walked with God, he was walking
[1:13:14] with the word of God. He was walking
[1:13:16] with the revelation of God. He was
[1:13:18] walking in the in the knowledge of the
[1:13:21] hour that he was in
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; and he walked pleasing to God
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; in that hour.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation
[1:13:29] and all that hear my voice that that
[1:13:32] that we will not permit Satan to raise
[1:13:36] up in our mind that it's not possible
[1:13:38] for us to live a fervent life in this
[1:13:41] day. It's entirely possible. I reject
[1:13:45] the spirit of Leodysa with everything
[1:13:47] that's in me.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I reject that uh lullabi uh rock rock
[1:13:53] you to sleep attitude that's not part of
[1:13:56] us.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; I want this congregation to agree with
[1:14:01] that.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; So that you say within yourself, I have
[1:14:05] that same I have that same uh uh
[1:14:09] conviction
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; in my heart today.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll do you good to agree
[1:14:14] with it.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And there are people on the earth today
[1:14:21] that are living a testimony that is
[1:14:24] pleasing to God.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; By faith, Enoch was translated,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; that he should not see death, and was f
[1:14:35] not found because God had translated
[1:14:37] him. For before his translation, he had
[1:14:41] this testimony that he pleased God.
[1:14:44] Brother Brandham describes the scenario
[1:14:46] that he just walked with God. And he
[1:14:49] walked with God in such a way that God
[1:14:51] was so pleased with him,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; he just decided to take him. And if that
[1:14:56] is the type of a people that's on the
[1:14:59] earth now, we're either just a people of
[1:15:02] of another belief or another set of
[1:15:04] doctrines or another church group or
[1:15:07] we're a people that are after the same
[1:15:09] type of of of of Enoch. And if the
[1:15:13] scripture says that Enoch walked with
[1:15:16] God, the seventh from Adam, and you know
[1:15:19] we are the seventh from the second Adam.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; We are the seventh church age from the
[1:15:25] second Adam, Jesus Christ.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my
[1:15:30] heart.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; He pleased God. That was he be he was
[1:15:36] acceptable with God. He was well
[1:15:38] pleasing. And the scripture tells us,
[1:15:40] having predestinated us, you know what
[1:15:42] predestinated is? You're predestinated.
[1:15:46] That's your destination.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; God has determined that this is your
[1:15:50] destination.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; He predestinated us under the adoption
[1:15:54] of children by Jesus Christ according to
[1:15:58] the good pleasure of his will. his will
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:16:05] wherein
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; he hath made
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; not you have made he hath made us
[1:16:13] accepted in the beloved
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I love the dagot
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; verse for these verses and the dagot
[1:16:23] says this where it starts out having
[1:16:26] predestinated us unto adoption it says
[1:16:29] having in of
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; previously marked us out. Previously
[1:16:35] marked you out.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; You want to say this morning, I have
[1:16:40] been previously marked out.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I'm a marked indeed. I'm marked.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; He's marked us out for sunship.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; He says, "You're going to be a mature
[1:16:53] son."
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to cause it to be that
[1:16:56] way. Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; G
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus for himself
[1:17:03] according for the good pleasure of his
[1:17:05] will to the praise of his glorious uh
[1:17:08] beneficence uh with which he graciously
[1:17:12] favored us in the beloved one. I love
[1:17:16] that having marked having in love
[1:17:18] previously marked us out.
[1:17:23] Now, here are some things I want to give
[1:17:25] you some background so that we can uh
[1:17:29] move together through this message.
[1:17:32] Enoch walked with God after he begat
[1:17:35] Methuselah
[1:17:37] for 300 years.
[1:17:42] Methuselah, who almost broke the
[1:17:45] thousand-year day, he lived the longest.
[1:17:48] a day is with the Lord as a thousand
[1:17:51] years. He lived 969
[1:17:55] years, but failed to break the
[1:17:58] thousand-year day. In other words, in
[1:18:01] the day you eat thereof, you shall
[1:18:03] surely die. No man was able to break
[1:18:07] that thousand-year day.
[1:18:10] Enoch walked with God after he begat
[1:18:12] Methuselah 300 years.
[1:18:16] Enoch walked with Adam
[1:18:19] for possibly 57 years.
[1:18:24] Adam
[1:18:26] who saw everything transpire in Eden.
[1:18:31] Enoch was able to
[1:18:34] perhaps speak with him
[1:18:36] and know exactly what took place.
[1:18:40] that 57 years before Adam died. Enoch
[1:18:44] prophesied or preached for perhaps I
[1:18:48] took him at 30 years old. He lived to
[1:18:50] 365 years. He probably preached
[1:18:55] prophesied for 335 years before he was
[1:18:59] translated.
[1:19:02] Enoch saw the coming of the Lord to
[1:19:04] execute judgment upon the ungodly.
[1:19:09] Enoch was the seventh from Adam and we
[1:19:11] are the seventh church age from the
[1:19:14] second Adam.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; And we read that in Jude 14 and 15.
[1:19:22] And the prophet said in the rapture
[1:19:24] message again Enoch was the seventh from
[1:19:28] Adam which was a type of the church
[1:19:30] ages. Now, all of the rest of the six
[1:19:33] men before him died, but Enoch was
[1:19:36] translated, Enoch was raptured, the
[1:19:39] seventh, showing that it's the seventh
[1:19:42] church age that takes the rapture.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Now, there's no doubt that we're living
[1:19:48] in the seventh church age.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; In the days of Enoch, the people had
[1:19:53] their own religion. In questions and
[1:19:55] answers, a prophet said they had their
[1:19:59] own religions and they did not believe
[1:20:01] the message of Noah. They did not
[1:20:04] believe the message of Enoch. And the
[1:20:07] type is there are many that can't
[1:20:11] believe and don't believe the message of
[1:20:13] this hour. And I would trust that we
[1:20:15] today are believers. And they rejected
[1:20:18] their message and was condemned. The
[1:20:21] Bible said they were
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; right. in conflict between God and
[1:20:26] Satan. Says, "And Enoch,
[1:20:29] the great prophet who prophesied of the
[1:20:32] Lord coming was translated raptured
[1:20:35] before the flood. Noah was carried
[1:20:38] through to preserve seed on the earth."
[1:20:43] Noah's father, Lamek,
[1:20:47] he lived 140 years during Enoch's
[1:20:51] lifetime.
[1:20:53] And Lamek may well have told his son
[1:20:57] uh Noah of his grandfather, Lamech's
[1:21:01] grandfather,
[1:21:03] who was translated
[1:21:06] Lamek's grandfather was Enoch
[1:21:09] and he could possibly well have told him
[1:21:14] uh of the young man of 365 years. Now
[1:21:17] you have to put your mind in a
[1:21:19] completely different we live 60 70 years
[1:21:22] 80 years 90 years and oo we're old.
[1:21:26] Uh Enoch at 365 years he live he died as
[1:21:31] a very young man or he didn't die he was
[1:21:34] raptured as a very young man. The one
[1:21:37] before Enoch was I'm going to show you
[1:21:40] these in a minute and lived 962 years
[1:21:45] which was Jared his father
[1:21:48] and his son lived 969 years and he lived
[1:21:53] 306. So he lived about a third of an
[1:21:56] average man's life. So say an average
[1:21:59] man's life is you know 60 70 years or 75
[1:22:03] years and he could have lived about said
[1:22:07] the word was out
[1:22:10] Enoch
[1:22:11] he vanished
[1:22:14] he was a holy man godly man and God took
[1:22:18] him
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; when he was just a young man
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; of 365 years only lived a third of the
[1:22:25] average man's life.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You know, it shouldn't really surprise
[1:22:29] if we think 300 years, 900 years. I
[1:22:32] thought I thought that you folks are
[1:22:34] here because of eternal life.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; What's eternal life?
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; There's no beginning, no end.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; You're not going to learn to play a
[1:22:45] harp. That's not it. Not going to sit on
[1:22:47] a cloud and do some things. That's not
[1:22:50] what it's all about. There's a a God out
[1:22:53] there. I was just driving to the church
[1:22:56] this morning and seeing we passed all
[1:22:59] the farm fields where they have uh so
[1:23:02] much of the market gardens growing and
[1:23:05] all kinds of vegetables and they're
[1:23:07] probably they've just planted probably
[1:23:09] the fourth or fifth crop this season.
[1:23:13] And that ground is so fertile here in
[1:23:16] this delta. It just grows up. You almost
[1:23:19] can see it grow up. And they have
[1:23:21] carrots and vegetables and onions and
[1:23:23] all kinds of things growing. And then
[1:23:25] and there'll be on one side of the field
[1:23:27] there'll be the sorers and on the other
[1:23:29] side of the field be the reapers on the
[1:23:31] same field and then all kinds of
[1:23:34] different different things growing. And
[1:23:36] I thought, isn't our God? I said to my
[1:23:39] wife, "Isn't our God something? Just all
[1:23:41] these different things and some of these
[1:23:43] vegetables people love and then next
[1:23:45] person hates it and doesn't want to eat
[1:23:48] it." And and she said, "Yes, and what
[1:23:50] about all the taste buds that are in
[1:23:52] your tongue?" And and I said, "You know,
[1:23:54] that's just amazing. Our God, he just
[1:23:56] planted all of this stuff." I said, "Why
[1:23:58] didn't he just say, listen, you lump of
[1:24:00] dirt, go out and eat the dirt." Yeah.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But in the dirt, he he said, "You know,
[1:24:06] the these people I've made and my
[1:24:08] children, they're going to need what's
[1:24:10] in there for their for their bodies,
[1:24:12] just for their earthly. So, I'll take
[1:24:14] all the elements of the soil, and I'll
[1:24:17] bring it up in all different here's
[1:24:18] blueberries over here, and here's
[1:24:20] carrots over here, and here's all these
[1:24:22] wonderful vegetables just growing up,
[1:24:25] and all the to satisfy all the different
[1:24:27] taste buds of all the different people."
[1:24:30] one said, "No, I don't like that." Next
[1:24:32] one says, "I love it." Isn't it amazing?
[1:24:34] We sit at the same table.
[1:24:38] You folks, I I want you to respond like
[1:24:41] humans now. You know, that's where you
[1:24:43] live. And and that's exactly the way we
[1:24:46] are. And just think our heavenly father.
[1:24:48] And brother Brandham says, "And and then
[1:24:50] he created thing. One person loves the
[1:24:52] deserts, and the next person loves the
[1:24:54] mountains, and one loves the ocean, and
[1:24:56] one loves the prairies. And it's a good
[1:24:59] thing we're not all the same. We're not
[1:25:00] all in the same place. And he says, "And
[1:25:03] then somebody says, "Oh, no. I'm not
[1:25:05] interested in the mountains." He said,
[1:25:06] "You know, God just cleaned off his his
[1:25:09] uh uh his trowel or his mortar box and
[1:25:12] and created all the mountains." Well,
[1:25:14] and he said he did it for me then cuz he
[1:25:17] liked the mountains. Well, uh we're here
[1:25:19] and we've got mountains whether we like
[1:25:21] them or not. They're they're here. So,
[1:25:24] uh you know, just imagine what he's
[1:25:26] preparing. Behold, I go and prepare a
[1:25:28] place for you. And it'll he said it'll
[1:25:31] be suited just exactly to the bride's
[1:25:34] liking. Hallelujah. You won't have to
[1:25:36] worry about being bored over there,
[1:25:38] friends.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I can just feel the expectation of it
[1:25:44] coming on.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I thought this might be interesting for
[1:25:53] you.
[1:25:57] And this isn't critical, but I'm going
[1:25:59] to just show you a couple slides.
[1:26:09] Can I get it here as well? Thank you.
[1:26:12] Just 10 generations spanned the 1656
[1:26:17] years between the day God made Adam and
[1:26:21] the day Noah entered the ark to ride out
[1:26:24] the great flood.
[1:26:26] And because of their longevity,
[1:26:29] excluding Enoch only,
[1:26:32] the pre flood members in the in the Adam
[1:26:35] to Noah line lived an average of 912
[1:26:39] years.
[1:26:41] And one might imagine that many
[1:26:43] thousands of years passed from the
[1:26:45] creation to the flood. The first
[1:26:48] biblical genealogy recorded is in
[1:26:51] Genesis 5 if you wish to look at it. And
[1:26:55] I thought that this might be interesting
[1:26:57] to you.
[1:26:59] Adam
[1:27:01] from zero from his creation lived 930
[1:27:05] years. Seth
[1:27:08] 130 from when he was born to 10:42. We
[1:27:12] go on down Enos, Canaan, Mahal, Lal,
[1:27:17] Jared, Enoch,
[1:27:20] Methuselah,
[1:27:22] Lamek, and Noah.
[1:27:26] This is what's interesting.
[1:27:30] Adam lived to see the birth of all of
[1:27:33] his descendants
[1:27:35] except Noah.
[1:27:39] Adam thus saw the terrible fruits of his
[1:27:42] sinfulness
[1:27:43] as mankind was just a generation away
[1:27:46] from destruction when he died.
[1:27:51] All the pre-noah generations in Adam's
[1:27:54] bloodline died out before the flood.
[1:27:59] Methusela died the very year of the
[1:28:01] flood.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; That's very significant. God would not
[1:28:06] allow in those generations the direct
[1:28:10] bloodline of Adam to perish.
[1:28:16] And Methuselah witnessed his grandson
[1:28:19] building the ark.
[1:28:27] Methuselah, the last survivor of the
[1:28:30] pre-noah generations, he outlived his
[1:28:33] son Lamech,
[1:28:36] died the very year in which God sent the
[1:28:38] flood. Noah's father, Lamech, died just
[1:28:42] four years before the flood.
[1:28:47] Noah, having been told by the Lord that
[1:28:50] only he and his wife and his sons and
[1:28:53] their wives were to be going into the
[1:28:56] ark, was probably not terribly
[1:28:58] distressed at having to bid his father
[1:29:02] and grandfather farewell before the
[1:29:05] flood struck.
[1:29:08] So that's a little background.
[1:29:13] And the scripture says, Enoch
[1:29:16] the seventh from Adam prophesied of
[1:29:20] these, saying, "Behold, the Lord cometh
[1:29:22] with 10 thousands of his saints." I want
[1:29:26] to direct your attention now, and if
[1:29:28] you'll have your Bibles, please turn to
[1:29:31] the book of Jude.
[1:29:46] And then when you have found it, it's
[1:29:48] just before revelation.
[1:29:55] There are things that perhaps mean
[1:29:58] something to me
[1:30:01] and I trust will mean something to you.
[1:30:04] Even if I can jar your
[1:30:07] interest.
[1:30:09] So you say I will look at the message
[1:30:11] differently.
[1:30:13] The message is not just a series of
[1:30:15] books,
[1:30:17] a series of messages.
[1:30:22] The prophet says there's not a
[1:30:23] punctuation
[1:30:25] out of place in this Bible.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; God put Jude where he wanted the book of
[1:30:32] Jude. He directed the men and influenced
[1:30:35] them that the canon of scripture. And
[1:30:39] there are some, excuse me, that felt,
[1:30:43] for example, the book of Enoch is not in
[1:30:46] the Bible. But, and there were other
[1:30:48] books, the Mcabes and the Catholic
[1:30:52] Bible, some of them, I think, have the
[1:30:54] Mcabes books in the Bible. God has
[1:30:58] ordained that the this Bible does not
[1:31:01] have those books for whatever reason was
[1:31:05] known to him. But the book of Enoch, the
[1:31:08] book of Jude which speaks of Enoch
[1:31:12] happens to be just below just before the
[1:31:15] book of Revelation which is really a
[1:31:18] book of our day. And uh and now this is
[1:31:22] I think very striking.
[1:31:26] Brother Brandham takes his text for
[1:31:29] souls that are in prison now
[1:31:32] from the book of Jude
[1:31:35] and also from Peter where he speaks of
[1:31:38] the uh destruction in the angels which
[1:31:42] were once in uh that were deceived and
[1:31:46] were cast down and Jude refers to it.
[1:31:51] So Enoch walked amongst a people
[1:31:55] that had corrupted themselves to such a
[1:31:59] degree
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; that God was grieved that he had made
[1:32:03] man. And the Bible says in Genesis 6 and
[1:32:07] 11, don't turn to it. I'm going to going
[1:32:10] to Jude right away. The earth was also
[1:32:13] corrupt before God and the earth was
[1:32:16] filled with violence. Do we not have
[1:32:19] that earth again now? And God looked
[1:32:22] upon the earth, and behold, it was
[1:32:24] corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his
[1:32:28] way upon the earth. And the Bible says,
[1:32:30] "And it repented the Lord that he had
[1:32:33] made man on the earth, and it grieved
[1:32:36] him to his heart." And the and the if
[1:32:38] you take the word grieved and it grieved
[1:32:40] him to his heart, it actually says it
[1:32:43] angered him. The Bible tells about God
[1:32:47] could be filled with wrath. And you
[1:32:49] might think, you wonder about that, say,
[1:32:51] "Well, I thought God was love." Our
[1:32:54] problem is we don't understand what love
[1:32:56] is.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Love has to have justice associated with
[1:33:00] it. Otherwise, it's not love.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Love is corrective.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; And our prophet has said that. And we
[1:33:07] know that that's true. If we love our
[1:33:09] children or you have children, if you
[1:33:11] love them, you'll correct them. You'll
[1:33:13] direct them. and if necessary chastise
[1:33:16] them whether it's the law or not the law
[1:33:19] I don't say beat them I'm just saying
[1:33:22] chastise them and there's different ways
[1:33:24] perhaps of doing that but I I am saying
[1:33:28] that the scripture has the right uh has
[1:33:31] the right policy has the right direction
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; for our lives
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; all of our lives and so the Bible says
[1:33:39] that it was it was uh it grieved him at
[1:33:43] his heart and the grief was not only to
[1:33:46] hurt but to be in pain or vexed to
[1:33:49] torture. God's heart was so grieved and
[1:33:53] he became angered. Listen, it wasn't.
[1:33:57] You say, "Well, how does a God of love
[1:33:59] destroy the earth in a flood? Destroy
[1:34:01] every living thing." You should read
[1:34:03] about it. Destroy every living creature
[1:34:06] in a in a flood. And then they get all
[1:34:08] into debate. Did it happen? Didn't it
[1:34:10] happen? How are the mountains? I've
[1:34:12] talked to people, they said, "Well, how
[1:34:13] are the mountains covered?" Because
[1:34:15] there wouldn't be enough water. They
[1:34:16] don't read or they don't understand the
[1:34:18] Bible. The Bible says the fountains of
[1:34:20] the deep were broken up.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; It didn't just rain.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; The fountains of the deep, even science
[1:34:26] tells us today that there's rivers in
[1:34:28] the earth which are larger than those
[1:34:30] that are on the earth. Right.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; I go over to Hawaii and I look at these
[1:34:34] monster hotels and just thousands and
[1:34:38] tens of thousands and millions of people
[1:34:40] that visit and they they run their water
[1:34:43] taps and they run. I say to my wife,
[1:34:45] here we are sitting out in the middle of
[1:34:47] the Pacific and the salt water just
[1:34:49] every direction for thousands of miles.
[1:34:52] Where does this water come from? They
[1:34:54] flush their toilets and they wash their
[1:34:56] dishes and they have all of this fresh
[1:34:58] water and there just more fresh water
[1:35:01] coming. Where does this water come from?
[1:35:03] They don't chip it here. Comes out of
[1:35:04] the earth. And yet those earth th those
[1:35:07] mountains that the Hawaiian islands are
[1:35:09] sitting on. I've got uh just thousands
[1:35:13] of miles of water and hundreds if not
[1:35:15] thousands of feet deep. Where does this
[1:35:18] water come from? And God has provided it
[1:35:20] some way. We can't just go along and and
[1:35:23] put God in some kind of a little box.
[1:35:26] God, even this even this earth, this
[1:35:29] planet that we're on today, I'm I'm just
[1:35:31] marveling. God has to be a God to even
[1:35:34] find this speck,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; let alone find these specks that are
[1:35:40] sitted here today. and to be concerned
[1:35:43] about them. We have to believe that God
[1:35:46] is concerned about every little bit of
[1:35:48] his creation.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And he knew exactly the life you'd live
[1:35:52] and exactly when you'd be born, exactly
[1:35:55] when you'd hear his voice.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; And then he would appeal to you. Walk
[1:36:00] with my voice. Walk with me. You can't
[1:36:03] walk with God unless you walk with his
[1:36:05] words. And you walk with his voice. And
[1:36:08] if you turn away from his words, you
[1:36:10] turn away from his voice. It's not
[1:36:12] possible to walk with God and not walk
[1:36:14] with his word.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Enoch walked his life
[1:36:30] and lived a testimony.
[1:36:33] and his life and testimony spoke of the
[1:36:36] oncoming storms of judgment
[1:36:41] and the conditions that no doubt became
[1:36:44] quite normal
[1:36:46] for him for Enoch and I'm placing
[1:36:49] ourselves in the same thing became quite
[1:36:51] normal
[1:36:53] the perverted life that was being lived
[1:36:56] till God and he's now he's walking with
[1:37:00] God he's walking with a revelation of
[1:37:03] God that is so contrary to what he's
[1:37:08] experiencing.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, I've never seen this
[1:37:12] this way. I've never preached on this
[1:37:14] this way. But there he's caught between
[1:37:18] he's walking with God. And yet all the
[1:37:20] conditions around him are so opposed to
[1:37:23] God and grieving God to such a degree is
[1:37:27] that God, his father, the one he's
[1:37:29] walking with, is saying, "I'm going to
[1:37:31] destroy this
[1:37:34] And Enoch said, "I better say something
[1:37:36] about it." And he preached that God was
[1:37:40] going to execute judgment. You think he
[1:37:42] was popular? He was not popular.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; And he was not trying to wing a popular
[1:37:48] win a popularity contest. He was it it
[1:37:52] inspired when he heard that and knew
[1:37:55] that God was grieved. And when he knew
[1:37:57] the earth was corrupted, it put him in
[1:38:00] such a state of expectation that one
[1:38:03] that walks with God surely can't stay
[1:38:05] here.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I must be designed for another place
[1:38:10] because this world is not my home.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not at home in this c I'm not at
[1:38:17] home the way I'm not at home friends the
[1:38:19] way Leo deay is going.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Are you? No you we're not. We're not at
[1:38:25] home. Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; We're distressed about it
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; and that's good.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't shouldn't put us in a
[1:38:32] state of despondency. Oh, look at this
[1:38:34] and look at that. Don't even look at
[1:38:36] that. Look at the one you're walking
[1:38:38] with.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Look at the Holy One of Israel.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Look at the God who designed redemption.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Look at the God who loved you so much
[1:38:49] that even took out of his own bosom,
[1:38:51] sent his son to die of cruel death at
[1:38:55] Calvary. that we might be saved
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; that he wanted to save these little
[1:39:00] lumps of clay
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; and give them eternal life.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; And send a part of his own nature
[1:39:08] character into us.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Listen. Reproach for the word. The
[1:39:19] prophet speaking, Noah lived. And I've
[1:39:22] had people maybe question this, but
[1:39:24] here's here's one that was vindicated.
[1:39:27] And if we question it, we better have
[1:39:29] equal or better vindication.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Noah lived in a scientific age. Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Where there was a scientific achievement
[1:39:42] that they were unable to manufacture
[1:39:45] uh that we are
[1:39:49] where there was a scientific achievement
[1:39:52] that they were able to manufacture that
[1:39:54] were beyond anything we've manufactured
[1:39:58] today.
[1:40:00] They were brighter,
[1:40:03] more intelligent.
[1:40:05] Their science was far advanced to ours.
[1:40:10] And just remember,
[1:40:12] he had to stand the reproach of the word
[1:40:15] that he preached
[1:40:17] 120 years. He was speaking of Noah, of
[1:40:20] the face of the scoffers. And I'm
[1:40:23] telling you that these were conditions
[1:40:25] that Enoch also lived in.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Their great scientific ways proved to
[1:40:31] them that there was no rain in the
[1:40:34] skies.
[1:40:36] But yet Noah had heard the word of the
[1:40:39] Lord. How? That's not a none of our
[1:40:42] business. He had heard the word of the
[1:40:44] Lord
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; and it was contrary to their conception
[1:40:48] of it. So before his life could be
[1:40:51] saved, he must stand in the face and
[1:40:55] bear the reproach that these scoffers
[1:40:57] reproached him by.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Jude makes references
[1:41:04] Now, I hope are are you are you all
[1:41:06] right for a little bit yet? Jude makes
[1:41:09] references to the conditions of Enoch's
[1:41:12] time. Part of the service today is to
[1:41:15] get your mind turned around just in case
[1:41:19] you didn't think of the time that your
[1:41:22] type Enoch lived.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; And when you see him, then you know what
[1:41:27] you expect.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; When you see what he could do, then you
[1:41:31] know what you can do. When you saw what
[1:41:33] he can overcome, then you know that you
[1:41:35] will overcome it.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, not only
[1:41:39] understand that and not go away from
[1:41:40] here with, you know, just some
[1:41:42] excitement about it, but to say that he
[1:41:45] God put him there. His conditions are
[1:41:48] the same and he overcame it.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And if he overcame it, that is a perfect
[1:41:54] sign that I'm going to overcome it.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; And my faith is in the word of God. God
[1:41:59] put that word there. Are you in
[1:42:01] agreement with that? He overcame it. I
[1:42:04] will overcome it. Not because you have a
[1:42:06] certain uh degree of stamina or a
[1:42:09] certain determination. It's not your
[1:42:11] determination. It's God said he made you
[1:42:14] accepted in the beloved.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Noah Enoch was accepted. You're
[1:42:20] accepted.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Noah Enoch overcame. You overcome.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:29] So Jude makes references to the
[1:42:31] conditions of Enoch's time. And now
[1:42:37] we will turn to Jude's gospel, Jude's
[1:42:41] epistle.
[1:42:44] And uh I'm going to start at the third
[1:42:46] verse,
[1:42:48] but this been on my heart and it's
[1:42:49] rather strange. I'm going to have you
[1:42:53] read with me.
[1:42:55] I want you to absorb what it is
[1:42:58] that Jude is saying. And these are the
[1:43:02] conditions.
[1:43:03] We'll start with the third verse.
[1:43:06] Beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[1:43:10] write unto you of the common salvation,
[1:43:14] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:43:17] and exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:43:20] contend for the faith which was once
[1:43:23] delivered unto the saints. You're
[1:43:25] reading it with me, are you?
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to be reading it with me.
[1:43:30] Now, uh,
[1:43:32] notice this verse.
[1:43:36] I gave all diligence to write unto you
[1:43:39] of the common salvation.
[1:43:42] It's the only time it appears like that.
[1:43:45] The and common salvation is not just a
[1:43:48] uh it doesn't refer to that of the
[1:43:51] common people. But the common salvation
[1:43:54] actually common has a negative
[1:43:58] uh inference.
[1:44:00] it it refers to something that's
[1:44:02] negative, something that's common,
[1:44:05] something that's unacceptable.
[1:44:07] But the reason why uh the apostle here
[1:44:11] or Jude is referred to it as the common
[1:44:14] salvation, it is the it is a word that
[1:44:18] encompasses the generality.
[1:44:21] If you were to say today, how many
[1:44:23] people believe they're saved?
[1:44:26] Multitudes.
[1:44:28] Churches are full of it. All field are
[1:44:30] saved. How many are born again? Millions
[1:44:34] born again. And so it's the it's the
[1:44:38] common it's the salvation in generality.
[1:44:42] But now these are some of the things. So
[1:44:43] he's dealing with what is what is
[1:44:47] involved with the common salvation. And
[1:44:51] he says, he says, "And when I gave all
[1:44:53] diligence
[1:44:55] to write unto you of the common
[1:44:57] salvation,
[1:44:58] it was needful for me to write unto
[1:45:01] you." When he thought of the common
[1:45:03] salvation, all who experience or feel
[1:45:07] that they have received salvation.
[1:45:10] They're under the banner of salvation.
[1:45:13] He said, "When I thought of that, it was
[1:45:15] needful that I write unto you and exhort
[1:45:18] you that you should earnestly contend
[1:45:21] for the faith." Why is he saying that is
[1:45:23] because there were those that did not
[1:45:25] contend for the faith.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And he goes into he goes into that
[1:45:30] subject in the rest of these verses. the
[1:45:33] shortest verse in the Bible. The one
[1:45:34] that God placed just before Revelation.
[1:45:38] The one that the pro prophet in this day
[1:45:41] chose for the message souls that are in
[1:45:44] prison now.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; That you should earnestly contend for
[1:45:51] the faith which was once delivered to
[1:45:53] the saints.
[1:45:58] in Ephesians the message
[1:46:01] the Ephesians church age
[1:46:04] he he he refers to Jude 3:4 and12 and
[1:46:09] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[1:46:11] write unto you he takes the same
[1:46:12] scripture and then brother Brandham says
[1:46:15] it cannot be denied in the face of these
[1:46:18] scriptures that the true church and the
[1:46:22] false church are intertwined having been
[1:46:25] planted together but of different seeds
[1:46:28] Now friends, this is not to be this is
[1:46:31] not a scripture for just a
[1:46:33] denominational church. In fact is it's
[1:46:35] not. It's for those that are contending
[1:46:38] for the faith. It is that you shall
[1:46:41] know, you are to know and if you don't
[1:46:44] know, you should know that as the
[1:46:47] prophet says, it cannot be denied in the
[1:46:49] face of these scriptures that the true
[1:46:51] church and the false church are
[1:46:54] interwined,
[1:46:56] having been planted together, but of
[1:46:59] different seeds.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; We need to say amen to that. We need to
[1:47:04] be in full expectation and realize that
[1:47:07] we need the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; We need to be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:14] to make discernment between what is true
[1:47:17] and who is contending for the faith and
[1:47:20] who's denying the faith.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Because if you just take the outward, if
[1:47:25] you just take a an emotional approach,
[1:47:28] you'll be completely confused because
[1:47:30] they will look the same. They will say
[1:47:32] the same things. They will sing the same
[1:47:34] songs, but they're not of the same seed.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; And don't make a believer responsible
[1:47:42] for those that don't believe.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Every man must bear his own burden. It's
[1:47:52] not your responsibility what my
[1:47:54] decisions are. That's me. I'm
[1:47:56] responsible before God. You're
[1:47:58] responsible before God. Amen.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I'll smile so you don't know. You don't
[1:48:06] think I'm angry. I'm not.
[1:48:11] Verse four.
[1:48:13] Now, let's just finish with verse three
[1:48:16] again. That you should earnestly contend
[1:48:19] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:48:22] unto the saints. for or because
[1:48:27] there are certain men crept in unawares,
[1:48:33] who are before of old, ordained to this
[1:48:36] condemnation,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[1:48:41] into lasciviousness
[1:48:43] and denying the only Lord God and our
[1:48:46] Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this is a bit of
[1:48:49] a a bit a bit of a study, but when we
[1:48:51] say lasciviousness, we think of
[1:48:53] uncleanness. Gross uncleanness.
[1:48:56] Let me say to you, there is nothing so
[1:48:59] grossly unclean as someone having
[1:49:03] another another gospel.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That is the adultery of all adulteries
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; is to deny the faith. And that's what
[1:49:14] that's what Jude is speaking about.
[1:49:17] Friends, I can't say this in in soft
[1:49:19] terms. I have to say it very very
[1:49:21] clearly so that you won't have any
[1:49:23] misunderstanding of what I'm saying. And
[1:49:26] I'm not speaking of any persons. Have
[1:49:28] that absolutely firmly in your mind. If
[1:49:30] anybody even says that, that is
[1:49:32] absolutely wrong. But if anybody if the
[1:49:35] shoe fits, then they better wear it.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; If I deny the faith, I want someone to
[1:49:42] come to me and tell me, you're denying
[1:49:44] the faith.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And if someone denies that the prophet
[1:49:48] of God is a vindicated messenger of this
[1:49:51] age, I say they are denying the faith
[1:49:55] [Applause]
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; and let them have their
[1:50:06] they'll be rewarded accordingly. All of
[1:50:08] us will be rewarded accordingly. I'm
[1:50:11] taking this gospel very seriously. I
[1:50:14] take this message very seriously.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I had I had one of the one of the men
[1:50:21] that I most respected on earth travel a
[1:50:26] 10 or 11 hour round trip to sit in my
[1:50:30] home
[1:50:31] and tell me that this message was not
[1:50:35] correct.
[1:50:38] And I called him by his first name
[1:50:40] because many of you know of him,
[1:50:43] led me into the ministry, opened the
[1:50:45] doors for me, and I said to him, Chad,
[1:50:50] my wife who was in the kitchen
[1:50:54] and my children,
[1:50:57] I have committed to this gospel
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; and nothing can change that. Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And those were our last words. Not our
[1:51:07] last words to speak about, but our last
[1:51:10] words to speak on that situation. He
[1:51:13] knew that nothing could change
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; my position on the message of the hour.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; That was the same then,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; maybe 40 years ago, and it's the same
[1:51:25] today.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; This message I experienced answering
[1:51:30] confusing questions. This message
[1:51:33] answered where the world was going and
[1:51:35] where the religious world was going and
[1:51:38] a world that hasn't got an understanding
[1:51:40] of even the godhead
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; or baptism which the prophet said
[1:51:45] shouldn't take a revelation all kinds of
[1:51:48] confusion and as soon as these the even
[1:51:51] these authors that come against uh
[1:51:53] William Bran's message almost every one
[1:51:56] of them almost every single one the
[1:51:59] first thing they bring up is the
[1:52:01] trinity. Yeah.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Something that doesn't appear in the
[1:52:04] Bible
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; and we use them as some kind of
[1:52:07] authority
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; to oppose the message. I say that is a
[1:52:13] that is so unreasonable.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm this is part of a testimony
[1:52:20] this morning. I'm saying this message
[1:52:22] resolved that question for me forever.
[1:52:25] I've never had a question about the
[1:52:27] Godhead from that day to this. Never had
[1:52:30] a question about baptism. That doesn't
[1:52:32] even enter my mind. I have such a
[1:52:34] blessed confidence and such an
[1:52:36] assurance. Glory to God.
[1:52:40] Jesus is mine.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to read now. Listen.
[1:52:49] Lasciviousness
[1:52:51] is is want wantedness or shamelessness.
[1:52:55] And the and the and it gives a further
[1:52:57] meaning. It says shamelessness,
[1:52:59] lasciviousness is to also
[1:53:04] to be shameless or untroubled or
[1:53:07] unaffected by shame, especially in
[1:53:10] situations where others would be
[1:53:12] ashamed.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Friends, when I read what some people,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; those who've been who've been brought up
[1:53:20] in the message, I'm not even talking
[1:53:22] about I'm not even talking about this
[1:53:24] place. I I there's been those that have
[1:53:26] been in Arizona, those in Indiana and
[1:53:30] other parts of the world. This message
[1:53:33] will have opposition that all all kinds
[1:53:36] of denominations and churches, they
[1:53:38] scrap and fight amongst themselves. But
[1:53:41] it's the amazing thing. The message
[1:53:43] becomes a real target.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And it's not those on the outside, but
[1:53:48] those that have come from within.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; And it has happened. It's been in
[1:53:52] different parts of the country,
[1:53:53] different parts of the world, and they
[1:53:55] raised up now because they they know
[1:53:58] things from the inside. Listen, I'm
[1:54:00] going to be very very plain. Judas
[1:54:03] happened to know where the garden was.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; He happened to know where Jesus resorted
[1:54:09] thither.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; He knew he The other people didn't know
[1:54:12] where to go, but he knew where to go. He
[1:54:15] knew where he would be cuz he had come
[1:54:17] from the inside.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; He was a treasure. He carried the bag.
[1:54:22] He knew how things were conducted.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And he went to his own place
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; by his own testimony. I'll tell you
[1:54:33] what, friends. You say, "Well, we don't
[1:54:35] want to, you know, we don't want to hurt
[1:54:37] anybody's feelings." Let me say this.
[1:54:39] The graveyard is full of people and most
[1:54:42] of them died as unbelievers and they
[1:54:44] will go dust to dust and so will this
[1:54:46] body go dust to dust. But my soul has
[1:54:50] been redeemed by the word of God.
[1:54:54] And we only have the promise of God. And
[1:54:57] it's this God that can vindicate
[1:54:59] himself, prove himself, show himself as
[1:55:03] being true and prove his give evidence
[1:55:06] that he is present.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So now I want you to read with
[1:55:18] me. I want to be able to hear your
[1:55:20] voice.
[1:55:26] We'll start with the verse five.
[1:55:30] Verse four ends up only and denying the
[1:55:33] only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:55:37] Verse five we'll read together. I will
[1:55:40] therefore put you in remembrance, though
[1:55:44] ye once knew this, how that the Lord
[1:55:47] having saved the people out of the land
[1:55:50] of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that
[1:55:53] believed not. That's verse five. He's
[1:55:56] dealing with the children of Israel that
[1:55:58] came out of Egypt. Now two, he goes to
[1:56:00] the angels which held not their first
[1:56:03] estate. Verse six. And the angels which
[1:56:06] kept not their first estate, but left
[1:56:09] their own habitation, he hath reserved
[1:56:12] in everlasting chains under darkness
[1:56:16] under the judgment of the great day. Now
[1:56:18] he goes to Sodom. Verse 7. Even as Sodom
[1:56:22] and Gomorrah and the cities about them
[1:56:25] in like manner, giving themselves over
[1:56:27] to fornication and going after strange
[1:56:30] flesh are set forth for an example,
[1:56:34] suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
[1:56:36] Verse 8 will continue. Likewise also
[1:56:39] these filthy dreamers defile the flesh,
[1:56:43] despise dominion, and speak evil of
[1:56:46] dignities. Stop there. How could how
[1:56:49] could I put in any other category? When
[1:56:52] I read it, I was filled with shame.
[1:56:55] Filled with flame shame. It says Malachi
[1:56:58] 4 5 and 6. Malachi 4. William Brandham
[1:57:03] did not fulfill this. I tell you that is
[1:57:06] a shameful statement.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; And that is speaking evil of dignity.
[1:57:12] Why don't they refer to perhaps I I did
[1:57:15] a little brief calculation that the the
[1:57:17] prophet of God stood publicly before
[1:57:20] nations of the world be it India or
[1:57:23] Africa or United States or Canada or
[1:57:26] Finland or Norway and in Europe and
[1:57:28] Germany and Switzerland and the same
[1:57:30] angel of the Lord was always present.
[1:57:33] Oh, they can quibble about this light or
[1:57:35] that light or whether it was a bulb or
[1:57:37] whether it was I care not. I care about
[1:57:40] the light that spoke to the individual
[1:57:43] and the the light that said to them uh
[1:57:46] as they said to a woman that I just read
[1:57:48] this morning and you got a baby. The
[1:57:50] reason you're weeping is you've got a
[1:57:52] baby and it's got marks on its face and
[1:57:55] you don't know and the doctors have told
[1:57:57] you it is without hope. They can do
[1:58:00] nothing for you. And he says and some
[1:58:02] people say it's a birthmark and he he
[1:58:05] cast out the devil out of that child.
[1:58:07] and he said it's actually tumorous.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Something that medical science couldn't
[1:58:14] prove. But a prophet gives a lady the
[1:58:18] answer for her child and it's actually
[1:58:21] tumorous and it'll leave. You tell me
[1:58:24] that isn't a prophecy. That's a
[1:58:26] prophecy. And are untold millions around
[1:58:29] the globe that have come under the
[1:58:31] blessing of that of that prophetic
[1:58:34] ministry.
[1:58:37] Pray for me friends.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; I want to say it very clear to me that's
[1:58:42] speaking evil of dignities. And I want
[1:58:45] every person here, don't you even listen
[1:58:47] to that stuff. Don't you even become
[1:58:49] affected because in this day of social
[1:58:52] networking, cast it out in the name of
[1:58:55] Jesus Christ. I would shut down
[1:58:58] Facebook.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I don't belong to it. Never have been.
[1:59:01] I've been invited to it many times. I
[1:59:04] don't answer it. I don't join and I and
[1:59:06] that's not because I'm old-fashioned. I
[1:59:09] do all my messages on I I research
[1:59:11] things all the time. I'm in the on the
[1:59:14] internet and on Google far more than a
[1:59:16] lot of other people younger than myself,
[1:59:18] but I don't set myself up with this to
[1:59:21] be a target for all this other nonsense.
[1:59:24] I don't want my eyes to read it and I
[1:59:27] don't want my ears to hear it. And the
[1:59:29] only time you said, "Well, have you have
[1:59:31] you heard have you you know what? I
[1:59:33] haven't even read the whole thing.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; It's too shameful.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And a bunch of people that are
[1:59:41] completely nonvindicated
[1:59:45] on what authority do these things be
[1:59:47] spoken
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; and they cannot duplicate not one of the
[1:59:52] thousands of times. And I calculated
[1:59:54] perhaps brother Brandham revealing the
[1:59:56] secret, God revealing the secret of the
[1:59:58] heart through him about uh maybe 7,000
[2:00:02] times. Can you imagine that? Right from
[2:00:05] the beginning of his ministry right to
[2:00:07] the very end of his ministry.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's why I want you to read this
[2:00:17] scripture with me.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; I want you to read I want your lips to
[2:00:21] say what he said. what Jude said, what
[2:00:24] God has said in his word and he is
[2:00:27] speaking about Enoch's time
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; and this is our time. You can't say out
[2:00:35] of one side of your mouth, Enoch is my
[2:00:37] type. But on the other hand, I live in a
[2:00:39] different kind of a culture and I live
[2:00:41] in more accepted. No, you don't. You
[2:00:44] live in exactly the same condition.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; And while Enoch was living, God was
[2:00:49] fitting the generation for destruction
[2:00:51] by water. And he is fitting this
[2:00:53] generation. This generation is headed
[2:00:55] for absolute destruction. I even marvel
[2:00:58] that it still exists.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; When I see the glorification
[2:01:05] of all of this perverted gra
[2:01:07] gratification, it's just amazing,
[2:01:10] friends. It's amazing. You ought to be
[2:01:11] stirred up in your heart about these
[2:01:13] things.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; You ought to say, "I I I'm just deeply I
[2:01:18] I'm shameful for the generation we live
[2:01:20] in.
[2:01:25] All right.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; I just hope that you're in agreement.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't think I was going to come this
[2:01:36] strong this way, but I just preached,
[2:01:39] believe it or not. I just let the lights
[2:01:42] blind me because in the auditorium in
[2:01:44] North Carolina and Thursday and Friday,
[2:01:47] I preached not from this subject at all.
[2:01:49] a completely different subject. But God
[2:01:51] just took a hold as I feel he is this
[2:01:54] morning and God was speaking to me
[2:01:56] earlier said let the people read this
[2:01:58] themselves.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; This is God's word.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; We either believe it or we don't believe
[2:02:03] it. And I talked very straight and 4 500
[2:02:05] maybe 600 700 people there. The place
[2:02:08] turned electric.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And I had ministers come to me after and
[2:02:12] say you had to say that.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; We needed to hear it. And that's a
[2:02:18] message of this hour.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; And we spoke very forcefully of the
[2:02:21] conditions of this time. And friends,
[2:02:24] I'm not going to let people just invade
[2:02:26] and creep in unawares and we just, you
[2:02:29] know, go along, you know, call it for
[2:02:31] what it is. It's a denial of the very
[2:02:35] gospel that saved me.
[2:02:37] It's a denial of the very structure that
[2:02:40] we're founded on. And I don't I resist
[2:02:43] it in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:02:46] as a demon spirit.
[2:02:49] [Applause]
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; And friends, you may not know, but I
[2:02:55] stood in my office and spoke to one of
[2:02:58] the leaders and said, "This is a demon
[2:03:01] spirit." And he turned and looked me in
[2:03:03] the eye. He said, "Are you calling this
[2:03:05] a devil?" I said, "I am indeed." I said,
[2:03:08] "Are you calling a work that uh that
[2:03:10] destroys seeks to destroy the house of
[2:03:13] God and families and the people of God
[2:03:17] and tear them one from another? I is
[2:03:19] that the Holy Ghost?"
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I asked him right in my office
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; and there was no voice. There was no
[2:03:27] words. There was no sound. And I opened
[2:03:30] the door and allowed the man to leave.
[2:03:35] Listen friends, we know what the Holy
[2:03:37] Ghost does.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; We have sense the presence of the Holy
[2:03:41] Ghost.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, even when it comes
[2:03:44] to sickness, a lot of people aren't
[2:03:45] delivered from sickness because they
[2:03:47] say, "Well, you know, I'm depressed or
[2:03:49] I'm this or I'm call it what it is. It's
[2:03:51] a devil."
[2:03:53] And the sooner you call it the devil,
[2:03:55] the sooner you'll be delivered from it.
[2:03:59] I'm just not able to walk up to the
[2:04:02] standard of the of the message. Of
[2:04:04] course you're able.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; You need to deny it. And the scripture
[2:04:07] tells us and the prophet is speaking in
[2:04:09] in souls that are in prison. It's the
[2:04:11] nature. The the soul is the nature of
[2:04:15] the life. It was our nature. It was
[2:04:18] Adam's nature. He lost the God nature.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; And Jesus went to Calvary. And the
[2:04:25] scripture says in Isaiah 60 uh Isaiah 60
[2:04:29] uh 1 6162 there Isaiah 53 I'm sorry says
[2:04:34] and he poured out his soul
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; unto death at Calvary he poured out what
[2:04:41] you need
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; and people say well that's just by
[2:04:44] nature. No you need to die
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; and let that nature die.
[2:04:49] [Applause]
[2:04:51] And when that nature rises up and and
[2:04:54] keeps you uh keeps you distant from the
[2:04:57] things of God, deny that nature.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; I can't praise God. I'm a quiet person.
[2:05:06] I would call on every quiet person in
[2:05:08] this place to give a praise to God and
[2:05:10] say, "Thank God for deliverance."
[2:05:14] Hallelujah. I deny that nature because
[2:05:18] I'm robbing Jesus Christ of his due
[2:05:21] praise.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God. Thank God
[2:05:28] for Calvary. Thank God for saving me.
[2:05:31] Amen.
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; And then he goes on verse nine, we'll
[2:05:46] read together
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; all your boys. Verse nine.
[2:05:51] Yet Michael the Archangel,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; he disputed about the body of Moses, dur
[2:06:00] not bring against him a railing
[2:06:02] accusation, but said, "The Lord rebuke
[2:06:05] thee." Even Michael when contending with
[2:06:09] Satan, dur not bring an accusation
[2:06:12] against him when he disputed about the
[2:06:14] body of Jesus or I'm sorry, the body of
[2:06:17] Moses. He dares not bring a railing
[2:06:20] accusation against him, but said the
[2:06:22] Lord rebuke thee.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; It's not my rising up or your rising up.
[2:06:29] It's the Lord that is this is the battle
[2:06:32] is the Lord's.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord rebuke thee. He said verse 10.
[2:06:38] But these speak evil of those things
[2:06:41] which they know not. Stop.
[2:06:46] They speak evil. Jude is speaking of
[2:06:50] conditions that Enoch experienced.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; And then he goes to uh he goes to the
[2:06:56] children of Israel that came out of
[2:06:58] Egypt and they spoke evil of things that
[2:07:01] they knew nothing about. They thought
[2:07:03] they were just speaking about Moses. I
[2:07:05] want to reveal something to you. This is
[2:07:07] a pattern that a lot of people don't
[2:07:09] know. And listen on the internet and
[2:07:11] everywhere in archive and wherever it is
[2:07:14] I'm speaking it for the first time. They
[2:07:17] speak evil of those things they know
[2:07:19] not.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; They don't have a full understanding.
[2:07:23] They don't have a spiritual
[2:07:24] understanding of it and they speak evil
[2:07:27] of those things and it always follows
[2:07:29] the same pattern. First it's it's a
[2:07:32] individual because it's something that's
[2:07:34] from the natural. It's a reasoning. So
[2:07:36] they they find something wrong with an
[2:07:39] individual.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; They found something wrong with the
[2:07:42] woman Moses married.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; It was the individual.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Then it goes from the individual to the
[2:07:52] preacher.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; It's his problem because he's not
[2:07:56] handling it right.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; And Moses now it it it advanced to him
[2:08:01] because he had taken and now a prophet,
[2:08:04] you need the message. The prophet of God
[2:08:06] said God told him to take her.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; But it goes from first it's an
[2:08:13] individual in the church. We've had it
[2:08:15] many times. It's all you know a certain
[2:08:18] problem in the church or sometimes it's
[2:08:20] a problem with an individual. Sometimes
[2:08:22] it's a problem with that very person's
[2:08:25] own children, own young person. And then
[2:08:27] they say, and I I appreciate every
[2:08:30] family here, but listen to me now. And
[2:08:32] then and then as Satan gets behind it
[2:08:34] and then says, "Well, there's something
[2:08:36] wrong
[2:08:38] with the preacher
[2:08:40] because if he was preaching the right
[2:08:42] thing, then I wouldn't have this
[2:08:44] problem." So now Satan, he's transferred
[2:08:47] it from the individual to the minister
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; or to the prophet. I'll show you. And
[2:08:54] they transferred it to Moses. And then
[2:08:56] they transferred it to God because they
[2:08:59] said, "Are you the only holy one here?"
[2:09:01] Now, now it advanced. It wasn't the
[2:09:04] woman anymore. And these are two
[2:09:06] different or three different accounts.
[2:09:08] But advanced from the person to the p to
[2:09:11] to the minister, then from the minister
[2:09:14] to his message.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; And when they touched the message, they
[2:09:19] were touching God.
[2:09:21] Yeah.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; And that was that spirit's design in the
[2:09:25] first place.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; So they took what humanly they saw with
[2:09:30] the human eyes and the human
[2:09:32] understanding. That shouldn't be that
[2:09:34] this is wrong, that's wrong, this
[2:09:36] person, that person. It's an individual.
[2:09:38] Then it goes from the individual to the
[2:09:41] preacher
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; or the prophet or the servant of God,
[2:09:45] whoever that servant happens to be in
[2:09:47] that place. Then it goes, hey, every
[2:09:49] preacher in the message would say amen
[2:09:51] to this
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; because they've all experienced the same
[2:09:55] thing. Then it goes just to the
[2:09:56] minister. I'm not saying the minister
[2:09:58] don't do wrong. They may well do wrong.
[2:10:01] But a servant rises or falls before his
[2:10:03] own master
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; and then it goes to the message. Well,
[2:10:09] if you were dealing with it right, if
[2:10:10] you understood the message right, or if
[2:10:12] you understood the message correctly,
[2:10:15] you'd be doing this, that, or the other
[2:10:17] thing. And so, they found that with
[2:10:19] Moses. And then, and then and then it
[2:10:22] was God. And so, God even had to speak
[2:10:24] to Moses, step aside.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to destroy them.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; And he fell down, showed his his
[2:10:32] attitude. He fell down the brereech
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; to be a type of Christ.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't take them. if you take them
[2:10:39] take my name off the book.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And so God spared them, but said he'd
[2:10:44] still remember that.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; He'd remember that.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Now, let I I'll go to I'll go to Samuel.
[2:10:52] In Samuel's case, we might even if you
[2:10:55] read it, you might even sympathize with
[2:10:58] the people because it was the elders.
[2:11:01] They came to Samuel. I'm only showing
[2:11:02] you a principle now in the scripture.
[2:11:05] And they came to Samuel and said, "Your
[2:11:07] sons are living wicked lives." Which
[2:11:10] they were. And And your sons are living
[2:11:12] wicked lives. They're not following God
[2:11:14] like you do.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; And and so they realize they have a
[2:11:19] need.
[2:11:20] And so it was it was the boys in
[2:11:24] Samuel's case. And then it went to
[2:11:27] Samuel
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; because he hadn't maybe reared them
[2:11:31] right or whatever was in their mind, but
[2:11:34] they had come to a conclusion. And the
[2:11:37] conclusion was there was they wanted to
[2:11:40] have now a king. Well, a king has a
[2:11:43] different message than a prophet.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; So they had a problem with his message.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; When they had a problem with his
[2:11:51] message, they were having a problem with
[2:11:53] God. Right.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; They had not put the connection
[2:11:57] together. And so
[2:12:01] Samuel goes to mourning and he mourns
[2:12:05] over being rejected. And God comes and
[2:12:09] comforts him and says, "They have not
[2:12:12] rejected you. They rejected me."
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; They don't realize that.
[2:12:21] Hey, in this generation, friends,
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham in the opening of the
[2:12:26] seals says this what the speaking the
[2:12:30] seals. He spoke hundreds and hundreds of
[2:12:32] messages. Now he's speaking se as seven
[2:12:36] seals messages simplicity and then the
[2:12:38] breach with it plus questions and
[2:12:40] answers all in the seals book. He said
[2:12:43] this will cause 10,000
[2:12:46] of my friends to leave me.
[2:12:49] He knew it ahead of time.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; This will cause 10,000. But did he
[2:12:54] deter? Did he change course? Did he
[2:12:57] soften it up? No. He said it like it
[2:12:59] was.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; So that he could say at the end, it's
[2:13:03] thus sayaith the Lord. Because there'd
[2:13:05] be a people like you and I that would
[2:13:07] need to hear that. And I heard thus
[2:13:09] sayith the Lord this morning in my chair
[2:13:12] and I just start to break up. Oh God,
[2:13:15] thank you. Oh God, thank you. We have
[2:13:18] thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Take this message seriously, friends, as
[2:13:25] seriously as I'm taking it. Can I carry
[2:13:27] on for just a few more minutes?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Speak evil of those things which they
[2:13:34] know not.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; But what they know naturally.
[2:13:46] As brute beasts in those things they
[2:13:48] corrupt themselves naturally, that is in
[2:13:52] a manner in a natural manner or by the
[2:13:55] aid of bodily senses.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; What they know naturally
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; that must not dictate to our spiritual
[2:14:05] life. What we know naturally is what God
[2:14:08] has revealed to you, spoken to you, and
[2:14:12] confirmed.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Agree with the word.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Let's read together from verse 11.
[2:14:22] Woe unto them for they have gone in the
[2:14:26] way of Cain and ran greedily after the
[2:14:29] error of Balum
[2:14:31] for and perished in the gain sayings of
[2:14:35] Kora. These are spots in your feasts of
[2:14:39] charity when they feast with you. Stop
[2:14:42] please. When they feast with you. This
[2:14:46] is not some distant thing. This is thing
[2:14:49] that crept in unawares and can feast
[2:14:53] with you.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Take communion with you.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Wash feet with you.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; This is what you have to be aware of.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Feeding themselves without fear. Clouds
[2:15:09] they are without water, carried about of
[2:15:12] winds. Trees whose fruit witherth
[2:15:16] without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by
[2:15:19] the roots, raging waves of the sea,
[2:15:23] foaming out their own shame, wandering
[2:15:26] stars to whom is reserved the blackness
[2:15:29] of darkness forever. And Enoch also, the
[2:15:33] seventh from Adam, prophesied of these.
[2:15:37] Stop. Prophesied of these. our type
[2:15:41] prophesied of these.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; What is your life testifying about? Your
[2:15:49] life's a prophecy that these things
[2:15:52] exist.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; And so when you see it, say, "Oh, all
[2:15:59] caught up." Don't glorify it. Oh, you
[2:16:01] hear what this person saying, "Here,
[2:16:02] this person wrote a book or whatever and
[2:16:04] more."
[2:16:07] One of the big books that's out just now
[2:16:09] which maybe some of this material come
[2:16:11] from was denied this message when we
[2:16:14] were still in the house
[2:16:19] and he's an engineer lives here lives in
[2:16:22] this lower mainland area
[2:16:25] I met him in fact walking on the
[2:16:28] prominad in clover in in white rock
[2:16:31] happened to meet him here some months
[2:16:33] ago
[2:16:35] and he looked at me and he said,
[2:16:38] "I need to speak with you."
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes."
[2:16:43] He said
[2:16:46] one of the happiest moment in fact is I
[2:16:47] think he said the happiest moment, most
[2:16:50] wonderful moment of his life was when he
[2:16:53] met us.
[2:16:56] Said that then he said, "I need to speak
[2:16:58] with you." I said, "Yeah." He said, 'I
[2:17:01] can prove to you
[2:17:04] that the serpent seedy doctrine is
[2:17:06] wrong.'
[2:17:07] I said, 'Really, we're on the prominad
[2:17:11] and young ladies, they're prominading
[2:17:13] back and forth in their short shorts and
[2:17:17] whatever more and everybody, you know
[2:17:19] what it is down in White Rock. We try to
[2:17:21] go there early in the morning before
[2:17:23] they feel comfortable stripped down like
[2:17:26] that. It's a shame,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; but it's there. It's they're the ones
[2:17:30] going to answer for it.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; And so I said, "Is that so? You're going
[2:17:35] to prove to me." I said, "What do you
[2:17:37] call all this walking down here?"
[2:17:41] Uh, he opened his mouth to say
[2:17:43] something.
[2:17:45] I said, "Are are you going to call it
[2:17:47] God's seed?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say that? It's God's
[2:17:52] seed." No, he couldn't say it. I said,
[2:17:54] "Serpent seed."
[2:17:56] Don't try to tell me about the doctrine
[2:17:58] you have when I got the evidence right
[2:18:00] in front of my eyes
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; naturally
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; trying to figure things out naturally
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; coming against a vindicated mind a
[2:18:12] vindication of almighty God with a human
[2:18:15] mind. Hear me friends. This is a this is
[2:18:18] a condition of this day
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; when people are lifted up in their human
[2:18:22] minds and can explain this and explain
[2:18:25] that. I don't even give it the time of
[2:18:27] the day.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; I gave that man just a few minutes have
[2:18:31] never seen him since.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in what people's
[2:18:36] arguments are. And you know one thing,
[2:18:39] listen to me now. One thing I'm talking
[2:18:42] about an old warhorse now. One thing I
[2:18:46] have learned, they never come up with a
[2:18:48] better vindication.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; They never come up and say, then I tell
[2:18:54] them, "Well, just say this is of the
[2:18:56] devil." Oh, no. They're Christians.
[2:18:59] Well, what are you saying? How can you
[2:19:01] be Christians and you have to be born of
[2:19:03] the spirit of God to be a Christian?
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; No, they're born of the spirit of God,
[2:19:10] but they're false.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, give me a break.
[2:19:14] This thing is this thing is weaker or
[2:19:16] thinner than as brother Brandham says.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; You try to live on something that's boil
[2:19:29] your eggs and think you have soup.
[2:19:38] And Enoch also for verse 14, the
[2:19:42] seventh, the the seventh from Adam
[2:19:44] prophesied of these. And this is what he
[2:19:47] said. Behold, the Lord cometh with 10
[2:19:50] thousands of his saints. Read verse 15
[2:19:53] with me. to execute judgment upon all,
[2:19:57] and to convince all that are ungodly
[2:20:00] among them, of all their ungodly deeds,
[2:20:03] which they have ungodly committed, and
[2:20:06] of all their hard speeches which ungodly
[2:20:09] sinners have spoken of them. And I want
[2:20:12] to get stop there for a moment. To
[2:20:14] convince all, it says execute judgment.
[2:20:16] and to convince all that are ungodly.
[2:20:19] That is that they they were in want of
[2:20:22] reverence towards God. They didn't
[2:20:25] respect God.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; And that's why he had to preach against
[2:20:30] their their their their condition and he
[2:20:33] called it ungodly among them. And
[2:20:37] they're hard speeches. They're hard
[2:20:39] speeches. Harsh, offensive, intolerable.
[2:20:44] And these are murmurers, complainers,
[2:20:47] walking after their own lusts, and their
[2:20:50] own mouth speaketh great swelling words,
[2:20:54] having men's persons in admiration,
[2:20:57] admiration, admiration, because of
[2:21:00] advantage. But beloved, remember ye the
[2:21:02] words which were spoken uh before of the
[2:21:07] apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how
[2:21:09] that he told you there should be mockers
[2:21:11] in the last time, who should walk after
[2:21:14] their own ungodly lusts. These be they
[2:21:17] who separate themselves sensual, having
[2:21:21] not the spirit. But ye beloved, building
[2:21:24] up yourselves in the most holy faith,
[2:21:26] praying in the Holy Ghost, keep
[2:21:28] yourselves in the love of God, looking
[2:21:31] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:21:33] unto eternal life and and of some having
[2:21:37] compassion, making a difference, and
[2:21:40] others save with fear, pulling them out
[2:21:43] of the fire, hating even the garment
[2:21:45] spotted by the flesh. Now unto him that
[2:21:48] is able to keep you, I say this in the
[2:21:51] name of Jesus Christ, unto him that is
[2:21:53] able to keep you from falling and to
[2:21:56] present you faultless before the
[2:21:58] presence of his glory with exceeding
[2:22:00] joy. To the only wise God our savior be
[2:22:04] glory and majesty, dominion and power
[2:22:07] both now and forever. Amen and amen and
[2:22:12] amen.
[2:22:15] Amen.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; And let me say this
[2:22:32] in closing.
[2:22:34] Don't anybody
[2:22:37] even dare
[2:22:39] to say that brother Biscoll was placing
[2:22:42] certain people or certain situation
[2:22:45] here. I've let that thing go so long ago
[2:22:48] it isn't funny.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; But when I have good believers,
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; honest people
[2:22:56] speak and call.
[2:22:58] I I let brother Billy Paul Brandham know
[2:23:02] where I stood here about a week ago and
[2:23:06] I thought you know what I said to him if
[2:23:11] anyone calls you and let you know cuz
[2:23:14] people somehow I it it it just it came
[2:23:17] to me and I got a call yesterday did are
[2:23:20] we the ones that started believe the
[2:23:23] sign? I said I'm going to make this
[2:23:24] clear. I said just have them listen to
[2:23:27] Sunday morning service. I'm going to
[2:23:28] make an announcement. We have nothing to
[2:23:30] do with that. But I want to say one
[2:23:32] thing, friends. Those things whether
[2:23:34] it's here, I've heard of it. Oh, it's
[2:23:36] over here and it's over there and it
[2:23:38] many years ago and all the rest of it.
[2:23:40] It's time to address it.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; It's time to let you know. You need to
[2:23:45] know where I stand.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; You need to know what the message says
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; and you need to know where you stand.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Amen.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; You need to have a foundation. And you
[2:23:58] go home and read the book of Jude and
[2:24:00] it's amazing. The prophet of God uses
[2:24:03] that to take his text and it and it's
[2:24:06] amazing that it's just before
[2:24:08] Revelation, the book of Revelation, the
[2:24:12] revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the
[2:24:15] ministry of Malachi 4 to turn the hearts
[2:24:19] of the children back to the original
[2:24:22] faith of the fathers. Amen.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's the whole ministry.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; And some spirit rise up. I will not
[2:24:31] stand still
[2:24:32] &gt;&gt; and not go to battle against that spirit
[2:24:35] and let you know that it's not persons.
[2:24:37] It's not individuals. I pray for their
[2:24:40] salvation. I pray that God may have
[2:24:42] mercy. But I can tell you when they go
[2:24:45] that far,
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; it's on very dangerous ground.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; And I would not compromise with it. I
[2:24:53] would be I would be uh uh I would be
[2:24:57] moving away from my responsibility if I
[2:24:59] didn't say to you and you see that
[2:25:01] stuff. My advice to you and counsel to
[2:25:05] you and sound counsel is forget it.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Turn aside from it.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; The computer can be a wonderful thing,
[2:25:14] but it can be a very destructive thing.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; And there are things you see and read
[2:25:18] and you wish you never saw. And I can
[2:25:21] tell you, you'll make it without having
[2:25:23] all read all that. You don't have to go
[2:25:25] into it. And don't spread it around the
[2:25:27] country.
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Believers don't need to hear it.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; I don't need to hear it.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; And I don't I just don't read it.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; I don't read it.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it bugs them that I don't read
[2:25:41] it.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; Because they think, you know, Satan, he
[2:25:45] wants to have attention. Well, you got
[2:25:47] to hear this. No, I don't have to hear
[2:25:49] that.
[2:25:50] I know where you're headed.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; You know where you're headed, Satan.
[2:25:54] You're going to the flames of hell. And
[2:25:56] I'm going to be standing on the on the
[2:25:58] balcony watching you go.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture says that it talks
[2:26:02] about the destruction. It says to the
[2:26:04] people of God, "Yeah, we worship God."
[2:26:07] And we say, "Hallelujah."
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; You're not there yet.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation says when you see
[2:26:14] the destruction of the wicked, you're
[2:26:16] going to say, "Hallelujah.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; We're done with it." Amen.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; The tempter, the accuser, the brethren.
[2:26:23] He's cast out.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's where we are to
[2:26:29] live.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your time and for your
[2:26:31] patience.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, do we have a song you can
[2:26:36] come and sing? Isn't he wonderful?
[2:26:51] Hallelujah.
[2:26:53] Let's just stand a moment
[2:26:59] with your head bowed. I want to thank
[2:27:01] God for
[2:27:03] your u
[2:27:06] patience and being so attentive.
[2:27:11] May be someone here even in this very
[2:27:13] unlikely type of service
[2:27:16] that you're seeing and you're feeling
[2:27:18] and sensing that God is speaking to you
[2:27:23] and you are
[2:27:25] seeing and coming to know and understand
[2:27:27] things that maybe something was said
[2:27:30] that is going to guide and direct your
[2:27:32] life
[2:27:34] and you you want to say now Lord help me
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; help me
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; come to me Lord Jesus and he'll come
[2:27:40] he'll will come right now. I want you to
[2:27:43] believe that he'll come right now. He'll
[2:27:45] come right where you are.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; And he knows what spoke to your heart.
[2:27:49] He sent it for you.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; And if you're one of those, you can just
[2:27:55] raise open your heart,
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; lift your cup upwards, raise your hand
[2:27:59] if you wish to. None of those things
[2:28:01] will do it, but the condition of your
[2:28:03] heart. And I want every believer to
[2:28:06] believe and pray with me. Father, we
[2:28:08] pray for this congregation, especially
[2:28:11] for needy ones that may be standing
[2:28:13] amongst us at this time and their heart
[2:28:16] is saying, "Lord, help me. Help me. I
[2:28:18] need you right at this time." I pray,
[2:28:21] Father, if there's any that are bound,
[2:28:22] that you will bring a deliverance to
[2:28:24] them. That you will cause the chains to
[2:28:26] be broken and that you will cause the
[2:28:29] hearts that have not rejoiced to
[2:28:31] rejoice. I pray, Father, in the name of
[2:28:34] Jesus Christ, you'll accept my
[2:28:36] thanksgiving for the wonderful group of
[2:28:38] people that are here and those that are
[2:28:41] streaming and some that have even
[2:28:42] contacted me this morning and said, "I
[2:28:45] will be streaming. I can't be at the
[2:28:46] service. I'm far away, but I will be
[2:28:48] streaming the service." Bless everyone,
[2:28:51] oh God, who was with us in the meeting.
[2:28:53] And I pray that the Holy Ghost will go
[2:28:55] and give understanding in every
[2:28:57] situation. Oh, Father, we're here. We
[2:29:01] are we are the antitype of Enoch. We see
[2:29:06] the oncoming storms of judgment. God,
[2:29:09] you sent an escape for us and we've
[2:29:12] accepted that escape in the name of
[2:29:15] Jesus Christ. You send us a message. Oh
[2:29:18] God, we're walking with the word. I'm
[2:29:21] walking with the word. I'm walking with
[2:29:22] it. Say, I'm writing on it. I'm writing
[2:29:25] on it. Oh, we bless your name. We bless
[2:29:28] your name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:29:32] Hallelujah. Let the people of the Lord
[2:29:34] say, "Praise God." Let's give him
[2:29:37] worship and thanksgiving.
[2:29:39] Oh, we thank you for your provision, oh
[2:29:41] God. Thank you for your provision.
[2:29:45] Blessed be your name, Lord. Thank you
[2:29:47] for your instruction.
[2:29:50] Thank you for earnest parts.
[2:29:53] Let us be those that will earnestly
[2:29:55] contend for the faith
[2:29:58] in this day and be unmoved in the name
[2:30:02] of Jesus Christ for your glory. For your
[2:30:06] glory, for your glory, for your glory,
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; glory.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:22] And we say God, we bless this. We bless
[2:30:24] thy name. We bless thy name. We bless
[2:30:27] thy name. If you got a microphone, we
[2:30:30] bless thy name.
[2:30:34] I bless your name in song the midnight
[2:30:37] hour.
[2:30:41] I bless your name.
[2:30:44] [Music]
[2:30:46] I bless your name.

[2:31:09] the way.
[2:31:13] I bless your name.
[2:31:18] I bless your name in prisoners chains.
[2:31:23] In prisoners chain
[2:31:28] with bleeding stripes.
[2:31:34] All in silence.
[2:31:37] All in silence. Pray that night.
[2:31:43] And in their pain
[2:31:48] began to sing.
[2:31:51] [Music]
[2:31:53] Their chains were loose
[2:31:56] [Music]
[2:31:58] and they were free.
[2:32:02] [Music]
[2:32:03] I bless your name.

[2:32:43] and some den
[2:32:47] [Music]
[2:32:48] if you
[2:32:51] listen to these words now
[2:32:56] in a prison in your mind.
[2:33:03] Reach out and pray.
[2:33:08] defy those chains
[2:33:11] [Music]
[2:33:12] and they will fall.
[2:33:16] They will fall in Jesus
[2:33:20] name.
[2:33:23] I bless your name.
[2:33:28] I bless your name.
[2:33:31] [Music]
[2:33:32] Heat. Heat.
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:43] Oh,
[2:33:52] I
[2:33:54] [Music]
[2:33:58] bless
[2:33:59] you.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; I'd like this congregation to leave here
[2:34:03] with these words on your mind.
[2:34:06] and others
[2:34:08] saved with fear,
[2:34:11] pulling them out of the fire,
[2:34:14] hating even the garment
[2:34:17] spotted by the flesh.
[2:34:22] Others save
[2:34:25] we have a commission. This Enoch type,
[2:34:28] we have a commission. It's not talking
[2:34:31] about the drunk on the street. It's
[2:34:33] talking about those go and read the
[2:34:35] chapter.
[2:34:37] Read the chapter. Others save
[2:34:41] with fear.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Why? What? What do we have? We have It's
[2:34:46] not We're afraid,
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; but we have fear
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; to the And we have reverence to the
[2:34:52] truth of God's word.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; Friends, don't be caught up. This fine
[2:34:58] society that you and I are living in,
[2:35:01] especially for you young people say,
[2:35:02] "Well, we got a lot of promise." Your
[2:35:04] best promise
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; is not a car or a good job or a better
[2:35:08] education. Your best promise is that you
[2:35:10] have eternal life because the holy God
[2:35:13] of Israel will surely destroy this world
[2:35:16] and all of the systems of the world. And
[2:35:19] we don't want to be part of that
[2:35:20] destruction whatsoever.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; You want to say, "I shall not be part of
[2:35:26] the tribulation."
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:28] You want to say that to yourself this
[2:35:30] morning after hearing this service? I
[2:35:32] will not be part of the tribulation. I
[2:35:34] don't need to be a part of the
[2:35:35] tribulation. I'm here under the sound of
[2:35:38] God's word.
[2:35:40] [Music]
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:47] [Music]
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:35:54] [Music]
[2:36:00] I'm giving that to you as a commission.
[2:36:03] You'll meet people that I don't meet.
[2:36:05] Don't be soft on the issue.
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; Save others by fear.
[2:36:12] Live a godly life.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Live a Enoch life.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; And this thing I felt so urgent upon me.
[2:36:21] Don't be weary now. I'm just taking a
[2:36:23] couple minutes less. I felt so urgent
[2:36:26] upon me that I should convey to you that
[2:36:30] the things that come your way, I've
[2:36:32] heard so many things come my way and and
[2:36:34] little texts, whatever more and and and
[2:36:37] and people start feeling down and
[2:36:40] depressed.
[2:36:41] Click your heels.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Jump for joy. This is what the scripture
[2:36:46] talks about. What do we hear? You hear
[2:36:49] the scripture. You hear the message, you
[2:36:52] It's a time for you to rejoice.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; We don't rejoice in it. You don't see
[2:36:58] Noah going along and rejoicing in the
[2:37:01] destruction of the of the wicked. God
[2:37:04] doesn't take pleasure in the destruction
[2:37:05] of the wicked. Not a bit, but we save
[2:37:08] all that we can. But we You'll never
[2:37:10] save them by waffling on the message.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; You need to know the message.
[2:37:17] Some of you young people that maybe
[2:37:19] don't have Bibles and you don't bring
[2:37:20] your Bible here. You get a Bible. You
[2:37:23] buy a Bible. Get your parents to get you
[2:37:25] a Bible and come to church with your
[2:37:27] Bible.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you hear the message.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, if I if I
[2:37:33] heard, listen, this place is going to be
[2:37:36] destroyed. This country is going to be
[2:37:37] destroyed. And we got a we got an exit
[2:37:39] route and all you have to do is follow
[2:37:41] these instructions. I tell you what,
[2:37:43] we'd be studying them. Oh, this is my
[2:37:46] way out.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; This message, this word of God revealed
[2:37:51] is your way out.
[2:37:55] [Applause]
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Let's be diligent with it.
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother. Oh my loving brother.
[2:38:06] When the world's on fire, don't you want
[2:38:08] God's bosom to be your pillow?

[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I do. Lord Jesus,
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; hide me over
[2:41:52] in the rock of aes.
[2:41:56] [Music]
[2:41:58] Rockes
[2:41:59] [Music]
[2:42:04] for me.
[2:42:08] Fathers and mothers,
[2:42:10] you have your family and you have your
[2:42:12] children.
[2:42:16] [Music]
[2:42:18] You've got loved ones.
[2:42:21] [Music]
[2:42:28] I tell you what friends, a lot of things
[2:42:30] in this life aren't very certain,
[2:42:33] but destruction is certain. It's a
[2:42:36] spirit that Enoch's expectation which is
[2:42:39] driving me this morning.
[2:42:43] On one side, I got great faith.
[2:42:46] It's letting me know that the rapture
[2:42:48] time and the change, the power is here
[2:42:50] to change his body.
[2:42:53] lets me also know that I must pull
[2:42:55] others from the fire.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Don't let the spirit of this age
[2:43:03] don't coast along you. I can't coast
[2:43:06] along
[2:43:07] into eternal life.
[2:43:10] We are here to fight the good fight of
[2:43:14] faith
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; and to contend. Contend. Contend is an
[2:43:18] action word. to contend for the faith
[2:43:21] that was once delivered for the saints.
[2:43:23] Don't feel hard against me. That's what
[2:43:25] I'm doing this morning to do everything
[2:43:27] in my power. Do everything within under
[2:43:29] the sound of my voice to have the people
[2:43:32] contend for the faith. We're not
[2:43:34] contending for any other contention.
[2:43:37] We're contending for the faith.
[2:43:40] Amen.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my loving brother
[2:43:45] and sister, when the world's on fire.
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you want God's
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; to be your pillow?
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; I'm sure you do.
[2:44:03] I be over
[2:44:07] in the rock of age of
[2:44:13] rock of age
[2:44:19] for me.
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; I say God bless all that are at the
[2:44:22] camp. Father Derek and the saints and
[2:44:25] the believers that are there. God bless
[2:44:28] those that couldn't be here. God bless
[2:44:30] those of our loved ones that we've
[2:44:33] claimed
[2:44:34] that are not here in the service.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Have no fear, friends.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; God knows them that are his.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; I say it again. God knows them that are
[2:44:48] his.
[2:44:49] [Music]
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; You hold them there in faith.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:59] I can't find exactly this quote, but I
[2:45:02] remember reading it. Someone was asking,
[2:45:05] "Brother Brandon about a loved one, and
[2:45:08] I believe it was actually a partner,
[2:45:10] husband and wife or wife and husband."
[2:45:13] and
[2:45:15] we're praying and
[2:45:17] and I get I'm so astounded at the at the
[2:45:21] way the prophet will take just a few
[2:45:22] words and reduce
[2:45:26] the very fundamentals of God in a few
[2:45:29] lines and he said this
[2:45:33] he said if you pray
[2:45:35] and you do not doubt
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; even if you don't see the answer in your
[2:45:41] life
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; when you rise is in the resurrection.
[2:45:45] God who cannot lie will have to answer
[2:45:48] to that faith.
[2:45:51] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful, friends? Isn't
[2:45:53] that wonderful?
[2:45:55] God who cannot lie must answer to that
[2:45:59] faith. It'll be just as fresh as when
[2:46:02] the day you went to sleep. Oh, bless his
[2:46:06] name. I'm trying to close the service,
[2:46:09] but it's so hard. So hard. One of these
[2:46:12] days there'll be no time and there won't
[2:46:14] be won't have to worry about that. We'll
[2:46:16] be on the other side and we're going to
[2:46:19] sit around the table, friends. We're
[2:46:21] going to sit around the supper table and
[2:46:23] you're going to be just every bit of the
[2:46:25] person that you are right now, but
[2:46:26] you'll be in another body.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be there?
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to go to heaven?
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Of course you do.
[2:46:42] Father,
[2:46:45] [Music]
[2:46:48] do what is most pleasing to you
[2:46:51] in the latter moments of this gathering
[2:46:54] right now.
[2:46:56] Don't let anyone
[2:46:59] that needs to make a decision, don't let
[2:47:01] them go out without making the decision
[2:47:03] say, "I've come to the place.
[2:47:06] I'm done with the world and I'm done
[2:47:08] with these doubts and I'm done with all
[2:47:10] of these reasonings and I just give
[2:47:13] myself completely.
[2:47:15] Bless this precious people, Lord, that
[2:47:17] have so attentively listened. We've
[2:47:21] worshiped together.
[2:47:25] I said to your spirit, Lord,
[2:47:28] you have the answer for every question
[2:47:30] that's in our minds.
[2:47:33] And father, if anything was said that I
[2:47:36] said that is not something that you
[2:47:41] would care and vindicate or care to have
[2:47:45] said, then I'll ask you to forgive me,
[2:47:49] Father. But if it is if it is truth and
[2:47:52] it is something you would punctuate, let
[2:47:55] it blaze like a brand of fire in the
[2:47:58] hearts of the people. Oh God, bless your
[2:48:01] children, I pray, as they spend the rest
[2:48:03] of the day in your presence, I believe,
[2:48:06] and I trust so in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:48:11] Amen. Amen. Amen. Oh, come and go with
[2:48:15] me to my father's house. Yes. Yeah.
[2:48:20] Come and go with me to my father's
[2:48:22] house.
[2:48:23] Come and go with me
[2:48:27] to my father's house.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Let's shake hands with one another. My
[2:48:32] father's house.
[2:48:35] To my father's house.
[2:48:39] Come and go with me.
[2:48:43] To my father's house.
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; Joseph, where there's peace,
[2:48:49] peace,
[2:48:51] peace.
[2:48:54] King Jesus will be there.
[2:48:58] Oh, in my father's house.
[2:49:02] In my father's house.
[2:49:06] In my father's house.
[2:49:10] Jesus will be there.
[2:49:14] In my father's house where there's peace
[2:49:21] meal

[2:50:45] spirit of God.

[2:50:59] cast you out
[2:51:03] of
[2:51:05] nothing but

[2:51:28] specialization.
[2:51:30] [Music]
[2:51:41] [Music]
[2:52:01] will
[2:52:03] [Music]
[2:52:05] rejoice because Jesus Christ is
[2:52:09] today and forever
[2:52:12] must beus.
[2:52:15] [Music]
[2:52:45] God
[2:52:46] [Music]
[2:53:09] bless the Bless
[2:53:12] [Music]
[2:53:34] you for
[2:53:35] [Music]
[2:53:41] By your stripes I
[2:53:43] [Music]
[2:53:47] draw
[2:53:50] myself.
[2:53:51] What a promise this is. You shall ask
[2:53:54] anything in my name. You shall have what
[2:53:57] you ask. Lay hands on the sick and show.
[2:54:00] That is the word of God and we stand
[2:54:03] with it. We come against
[2:54:06] the name of Jesus Christ
[2:54:10] in Jesus name.
[2:54:12] [Music]
[2:54:17] I resist the devil and that's the word
[2:54:21] of God and earth shall pass
[2:54:30] in Jesus name.
