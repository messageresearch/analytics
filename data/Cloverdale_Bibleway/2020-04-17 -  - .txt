TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this account is regarding a soldier boy and knowing that I had raised I'd been raised in quite a few the army camped US army camps during the building of the Alaskan Highway now this was 1961 so I had not seen a US Army uniform but I in the foyer of the church where it wasn't the church it was the church hall in Dawson Creek United Church Hall in Dawson Creek and I looked through the people and I could see a staff sergeant on a tunic and so that caught my attention I thought that's nice to see you know and then I didn't see it anymore then while we are in the service we've come to the end of the service that is Saturday evening and brother Branham has preached the service from that time and we've come to the end of the service and these begins to sing the whole congregation begin to sing I love him I love him and right in the midst of that course of the first end of the course what's the matters told you boy you're not going to mid suicide the Devils are lying to you boy you've only got a faux B he's lying to your driving and save you bleeding denying renounce the devil I command you in the name of Jesus Christ you renounce the devil and accept Jesus Christ as your healer you'll go back and be a gentleman and a real real man do you do it raise up your hands to God and say praise God that's right oh hey man Michael told me be well Oh raise your hands me brave the amazing thing is I was there I was on the platform and so I immediately thought of this this tunic that I had seen and and young people were buying you know army uniforms and tunics and so on just wearing it as jackets so I didn't know but what it was that and so I began to look for Soulja Boy and others were looking also there were also some Canadian soldiers that had been attending the meeting one of them became a very very firm believer and we couldn't see any soldier boy at all and one brother branham continues to talk to him and says you'll go home and be a real gentleman and be a real man then neither devil deny him and so it was a it was a startling moment really and the next day we were leaving or there following day we were leaving early in the morning on Monday morning brother branham did not know where we were taking him I was just taking him off the Alaskan Highway and we were going to go about 375 400 miles so we drove as far as Fort Nelson which is mile 300 and I said to brother branham I said you know maybe boy maybe we should have a bite to eat because by the time we get up to brother southwest place which will be mild 375 at that time I said you know sister Lila will probably be done or dishes at sister self waken he said I think that's a good idea so we just pulled off on an access road on the left side and stopped a little little stopping place it was like a little hotel when the US army pushed the highway through dawn through for Dawson Creek and then Fort st. John they passed the town and then the service stations etc built along side of the road and so we stopped in there but there was a restaurant just little clapboard building probably two stories and we're having or we're gonna have our lunch brother Chris Berg was with us brother Chris Berg brother branham and myself and we sat in a booth the waitress had come and taken our order and just after that the door opened which was on the side of the building and then came to Ben and I recognized as one as being the soldier boy that I'd seen in the tunic unit the tunic uniform I should say and I when I looked at him I said well fancy seeing you here I had been away from this area for about a year and a half and brother branham he just looked up over his shoulder like this to see who it was I was talking to he thought maybe perhaps one of my old friends I don't know what he thought exactly but just then a trend of a stout heavier set man squeezed between him and came around and and thrust his hand down towards brother branham and said brother branham he said remember calling out the soldier boy and and brother branham was a little startled because he hadn't expected that and he said he said he looked across the table he said did you remember brother Eddie I said yes you said hey you're not commit suicide soldier boy that's the devil talking to you he said yeah that's what you said that's what you said and he's shaking brother branham's hand he said well I brought him all the way from Fairbanks and we tried to get him into a prayer line and we weren't able to get him into a prayer line he said this is him would you pray for him and oh sure and just that moment the waitress came and slid our soup in front of us and so so brother Brown said well perhaps and that was one of my first real shocking moments I thought brother Branham was going to stand and pray for him to cast that devil out of him you know because that was how I had been brought up and brother Branham said well maybe we'll just eat our soup first and I thought eat her soup you know here here's a soldier boy trying to commit suicide so anyway they said well that'll be fine we need to get something to eat ourselves and they went down to three booths and sat him to have their dinner and then brother Branham entered into visions and he just looked over my head and began to talk about what had happened in the prayer line the day before he said I believe there was a blind woman that came through the service yesterday and I said well I can't remember a blind woman and brother Chris Berg spoke up he said yeah I believe there was a blind woman and brother Branham he is not really acknowledging our conversation he just looking over my head and he said yes he said let's see yes he said oh I understand I say no he said there's a young German woman that has given up her place in the prayer line to lead the blind woman through and then he he looked at me he said you see brother Eddie it may be that she's praying right now and they said just a moment and he looks away for a moment he said yes she's a German woman just to help you believe he said I'll ask him and he'll give me her name and he just looked away he said yes her name is sister Fair in English we would say fear but in German we would say fair sister fair and then he just moved his head for a little bit he said you see perhaps she's praying just now he said she has a heart trouble she has on two or three organs in her body and he named them and said she's she may be praying just now I asked my father if he could find this woman and my father found her she was in a city quite a bit south of Dawson Creek and it would have been about five hundred miles from where we were sitting and I I just found myself in an unusual place and now with that soldier boy in his need brother branham became under that burden so soon as we were finished eating we got up to pay the bill and brother Branham he's standing right in front he wouldn't he wouldn't let anyone pay the bill so he's standing right in front of the cash desk and where I'm standing right beside him and the soldier boy came in and he's right behind him and the soldier boy just tapped him on the shoulder he said brother Brad he said just two minutes just two minutes oh sure he said and and and a little don't fell we're all in the group there and we walked out the door and outside the door was a small sidewalk it went down here would be to the left as we came out and went down to the garbage cans and up to the right would be where the cars were parked on the gravel access road and so I and Chris Berg and the little heavyset fellow who drove him down went up we went up there but I faced myself so I could watch and see that brother branham what he was doing because I was very very curious in my young heart I was about 26 27 and I'd been preaching for several years but I was just there was no such a thing as knowing the message yet there's no such a thing I had no knowledge of Malachi 4 had no knowledge of Revelation no knowledge of a messenger I only knew that brother Branham had of unique the unique part of his ministry was the angel of the Lord that was always there and I thought if that angel of the Lord is in attendance at these meetings regardless of what anyone has said about him or said about his doctrine I would I would know by the presence of the angel of the Lord that he would not honor something that was not correct or true and so as I was watching brother branham I saw that he had his hat off and I knew that he was praying and then he slipped his hat back on and both of both he and the soldier boy turned around and they're walking very erect towards me the soldier boy was bit quite a bit taller than brother branham and I thought at that instant I thought now this should be a very charismatic movement and I'm not going to be swept away by the you know the excitement or the emotion of the moment and that's what I had just had in my heart but the soldier boy's face was completely transformed he was he was just totally relaxed and he thrust his hand up in the air with his fists he said I'm free I'm free I'm free and they came up and the soldier said to me said this man told me something that only I and my wife in this world know he says and when he did it was gone so we stepped into our cars and we said our farewells and I guess I understand I took a picture of them and which I'm this is a unique part of this ministry and a unique part of my testimony is the eternal aspect of God because here I had it on a platform now here we were 300 miles of the road and all I can really say is I was there on the platform I heard him call the soldier boy out we have it on tape now I'm 300 miles away and you you have to understand where we were standing you probably could go a thousand or 1500 miles north and never see a human you could probably go at least five six seven hundred miles south and never see a human down the Rocky Mountain trench from where we were truly a needle in a haystack and that man had brought the soldier down for prayer from Fairbanks Alaska fifteen hundred and twenty three miles on a very difficult journey actually believed he said I believed that we would find you and the soldier boy spoke up and he said that is correct this man actually believed we would find you today and to find two humans or three humans in that part of the world was is more than a needle in a haystack it just had to be sovereign Almighty God and now he's saying his final words while they were down praying at the garbage cans this heavyset man was kind of nervously speaking he said he's tried to commit suicide three times he's been under the care of the army doctors and he said they can't figure out what's wrong with him he has he has a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children and they just couldn't figure out what was wrong with him when we got in our cars brother branham he just on a little access road and it was rough and brother branham said to me said brother Eddie he said you don't know this young man or I said no I don't really he said that he's not a good friend of yours I said no I don't know him he said not likely you'll ever see him again and I know I noticed that not likely you'll ever see him again and I said no I said he lives in Fairbanks Alaska I live in Victoria British Columbia not likely will ever see him again he said no just to help you believe he said if if you knew him if he was a good friend of yours I'd never tell you but he said when we got to the end of the sidewalk he came to us there I knew exactly what he was talking about he came to us there and told him had a lovely Christian wife and two beautiful children I just heard that two three minutes before from his friend that drove him down and I wouldn't be telling this account to you or the world if he had said he had a Christian wife and three children but the man told me he had a lovely Christian wife and two children here's brother brown telling me he has a lovely Christian wife and two children but he had been committing homosexual acts with young men and as soon as he said that he said as soon as that was uncovered Satan lost his power and I I learned a great truth at that moment that all Satan has to be as exposed once he's exposed he's lost his power now here I come to a very unique part of this whole ministry that one that was talking and speaking he came to us there that one who said what his problem was that God is timeless he's eternal and it was 36 years later 36 years later a few years ago oh I was in my study and I came upstairs and my daughter Marilyn our middle daughter her and her husband Mike had been down to Florida and had been visiting a church and the pastor brother Bob Brown gave Marilyn a picture and said here give this to your dad I think it may be northern Canada and he might know something about it so when I came upstairs from study my wife said Marilyn left a picture here for you brother Bob Brown sent it up so I went to the little telephone desk and I'm I'm holding the picture and it's the soldier boy and the man that brought him down from Fairbanks and brother branham standing between them and I took the picture I couldn't remember taking the picture but I was the only other person except brother Chris Berg who wouldn't know how to handle the camera and I was struck into silence and she and my wife said what is it I couldn't seem to answer her she said again what is it what is it what is a picture I said it's the soldier boy I said I've got to call brother brown so I called him and got him on the phone right away I said brother brown where did you get this picture he said well I had a young man here in the church he was kind of a you know he wasn't really stable he didn't seem to be stable he was here and then he would be drifting someplace else I said is he still there no he said he's not here anymore he said and he was working in a with a construction company they were building a wall and some people were in there doing the floor and this young guy he was always wanting to witness to somebody so he was talking to this man about brother Brennan and he said and the other other fella said well I've had my picture taken with him and he brought him that picture and brother Brennan had said to me not likely you'll ever see him again I tried to make contact with him but I could not I never have seen him since well since that day a week in Fort Nelson British Columbia and so I begin to realize the timelessness and how something an event will happen but it's not just a single event it just keeps unfolding and unfolding because it's an eternal God and that is the story of the soldier boy [Music]
