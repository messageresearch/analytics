TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord happy to be in the house of God I I'm sure you are and I trust that before the service is over you'll even be more thankful you are here amen uh we have uh much to uh say and much to do before tonight is out we have communion this evening Lord's table foot washing and that's always such a glorious time we're happy that you're all here we only wish that those that are part of the invisible congregation on the internet I wish they were here I have a a couple of testimonies I want to give one we were so happy to hear about sister Isabelle uh Weber and uh the testimony she gave but here's another testimony and uh uh this is from Brother Daniel and sister lydy kulen Bruner from Switzerland and sister lyd's parents have been uh watching the congregation uh the service has here the streaming for about a year and a half maybe more than a year and a half now and then told their daughter and her husband about the services streaming and they've been streaming the services and uh here's a a letter I just received from from Brother Daniel and sister ladyy my wife and myself were so much blessed to listen to watch the night Ser the watch night's service and see all the testimonies for the glory of the Lord there is a testimony I'd like also to share with you since more than 12 years we are married a married couple and for about 8 years have tried to have a little baby but it was not possible after a lot of medical tests we were told that I Daniel had a problem and there was no way we could have a baby the doctors did their job and gave the medical proof of why we could not have a baby after all this medical exam our hearts were very much moved and there was just no way that we could ever believe of not having a little baby I always felt that there must be another deep responding to the deep in our hearts of being real parents there was no way we could accept the doctor's diagnostic to be the end of the story so the years went by and waiting sometimes was painful and not without tears in spite of the impossibilities by God's grace we kept the faith we bought a little baby bed and clothes and some year even some years ago then in summer of 205 we heard the testimony of one of your song leaders brother Jason I told Brother Jason I have a surprise for him and sister Emmy this morning we heard the testimony of brother Jason and how they could not have a baby but the Lord made a miracle for them we were so much encouraged by this testimony and our faith was so much strengthened also during the time I went through a prayer line believing that he is the same yesterday today and forever and that my body would be healed and some weeks later we found out that my wife was pregnant and she gave birth on May 28th 806 a little girl called Jolene and uh she is such a lovely baby smiling and reflecting the joy of the Lord we are so happy that he never fails amen isn't that wonderful praise the Lord I think it's just wonderful greetings to you from brother dooka in Congo and he confirmed he expects to be here in July to the convention and of course I think that would be absolutely it wouldn't be the same if we didn't have brother DEA with us they are also planning a Minister's meeting now a ministers meeting over there isn't like it is in anywhere else in the world the last last uh ministers meeting that had of the convention there was 1472 I believe 1476 ministers registered and uh they said that they uh there was not everyone registered so they expected probably over 1,500 ministers he said this time there's such momentum and so many want to come that they're expecting over 3,000 ministers from Congo and the surrounding African nations now that might seem quite impossible to you but kinasa I don't know exactly how many million people are in kinasa but I have uh I have in my possession the names of the churches and the addresses of the message churches in kinasa 172 172 churches in the city of kinasa thank you for your silence lets me know you are in a stunned shocked state but that's God's doing that's not man's doing that's a God we serve and so we're so thankful for that brother our brother Timothy Ma has just arrived back a couple of weeks ago from Vietnam and we cannot report on Vietnam like we can on China or other places in the world but he traveled all the way from the north which is right bordering in China all the way to the South names which many are familiar with Saigon and Hanoi the north North Korea South Korea which now is I mean Vietnam which is all now Vietnam in one one country but he's been baptizing ministers and you it it is so different he just is By Word of Mouth there's no way to communicate there's no way to do any Mass publication it's it's unlawful to have a uh a photocopy machine and so there's only certain people uh businesses which have photocopy machines and these ministers are wanting they're coming from other denominations and those that are God is raising up and they're needing the message books the only way to get a message book is to go to a public commercial like a kingho for example uh printing place and have it done it's very expensive it cost on the average of about 75 cents a book a message book to have it done which is just on on on sheets such as letter size sheets and uh so we want to I want want that you'll take this burden this is an ongoing burden it's not something that we just say we'll take an offering today or something like that we we'd like you to remember Vietnam and we are wanting to commit ourselves to see that the ministers and those that are teachers uh we'd like to provide about 200 of them with the messages brother brother Timothy has translated about 300 or oversaw the translation of around 300 messages in Vietnamese in the last few years I'm talking about maybe five years and that is a mammoth Mammoth undertaking and now it is to get those uh to get fund so that we can just publish those and we just want to get it in the hands of the teachers and the ministers so they can teach the message to their people brother Timothy uh travels great distances and then gathers a few uh generally maybe around a table where they're having something to eat so everything is very much incognito and is able to bring the message to these people but I tell you God knows how to reach the elect you say amen God knows how to reach them and so we we want to re remember the uh need in in Vietnam praise God well I'll have you stand and we're going to read and while before we read I'd like to sing I Love You Lord 239 on the screen uh and may I just ask a special request of you that uh some of the things I have to say today are uh maybe a little bit different maybe a little different approach a little strange some of them might seem very very negative some of them might seem um you know uh well there is a negative side to it but I would like you to think with me and to receive from my my words right now that everything negative is for a positive purpose and sometimes we have to look at negative things uh for a positive purpose and uh God has been dealing with me just differently that's all I can say and and and pray that God will convey to you not so it'll be you know brother Ed speaking your pastor speaking but say say Lord deal with me like you're dealing with him and let me catch what it is he's attempting to say because the words only words are only you know only allow you to go so far and we're so limited and God is so great and so wonderful we want to express our love to him just now as we sing I love in my to you oh my [Music] soul you let be [Music] AET join all together once again please [Music] oh my [Music] soul GL in a moment of prayer let's ask the author of the word to come father I pray that you will send now the Holy Spirit to bring your presence near to each person that is attending now and within the walls of this sanctuary and throughout the building and the fellowship room and the nursery and the translators and the people in The Sound and the video all who are streaming and all who ever will hear this service I pray oh God creator of heavens and earth and all things that are therein that you will come and take possession of these little bodies these frail pieces of clay as we've been so mindful oh Lord I pray you will take us and use us use every effort use every word use oh God what we now surrender to you for we surrender ourselves completely and I ask father that whatever would be pleasing to you that you will accomplish it today break every chain and feather raise up a circumstance that will bind Satan and make his make his attempt to hinder oh God I pray you'll make it invalid render him helpless bring him down low oh God and may the kingdom of God be raised high and glorious before us Lord Jesus I give myself to you anoint me I pray and the people to hear For Your Glory in Jesus name we ask it amen amen I'm going to read out of Luke's gospel the 12th chapter and we'll begin reading at verse 35 let your loins be girded about and your lights burning and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for the Lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh shall find watching verily I say unto you that he shall G himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the Third Watch and find them so blessed are those servants and this know that if the Goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when you think not then Peter said unto him Lord speakest thou this Parable unto us or even to all and the Lord said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord shall F shall make ruler over his house hold to give them their portion of meat in their due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing God bless you as you have your seats you'll need your full focus and full attention in the service this morning I want to speak on uh spiritual stewardship and Steward a steward is a one who is put in charge of the Affairs of someone else or a steward is one who is usted with another person's possessions and stewardship of course then is the act of of being and Jesus said who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household that's everything the ruler has as Joseph to the Pharaoh and to Piper working with pitifer but to Pharaoh he became uh a faithful Steward over the entire Kingdom at that time and so stewardship is the act of uh having charge having full control being Master over a man's Affairs but also in the in in the economy of God and I'm going to use that word now the Apostle Paul uses the word dispensation four times in the uh New Testament and we'll read those scriptures later on but he says that a dispensation of the Gospel had been given to him and the dispensation in the Greek is from the word Eon which is economy the economy in other words God has not only entrusted man with uh uh with his Goods as it were and we are going to go into this deep and long if you don't mind he's given him a stewardship in a number of areas and going to we're going to give an account for it there's just no way that we're not going to give an account for our stewardship and we've been given we've been given that of God but uh the the the stewardship also is when it comes to the word economy you can find that there are or the dispensation the dispensation because there was we could say there was a dispensation of Eden and from uh from Adam to Noah and and and the economy or the conducting of the Affairs had a certain order to it there was a system we call it and I'm trying to take the Bible terms and bring it into modern terms so you can get get it and then take it and apply it back is that quite clear so we have an economic system today and everybody here is involved in it you have currency which is a means of obtaining things it's a means of trade and we have different all different manner of ways of we got credit and we've got Banking and we've got checks and we've got credit cards and we've got a local economy and we've got a a state economy and a federal economy and a world economy it's it's a system how things operate but from Adam to Noah that was kind of one system and as far as God holding man responsible and then came the judgment and the flood and then we could say from Noah to Moses was almost like a different system a different type of operation because God then said I won't destroy the world anymore by a flood like like that I won't deal with man that way seeing that man is but flesh and then he shortened the years so the system changed and then from Moses the people were saying don't let God speak to us directly because God was uh speaking to the people directly don't let them speak to us it's too too fearsome it's too Dreadful let them speak to you you get the word you come down and tell us and then a different system came into place and then through Moses came the law and all the slaying of the animals and the man become conscious because the law law came Thou shalt not Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt not and then he found that he was too weak in the flesh and he couldn't he could not abide by the laws of God so he ended up carrying a guilt and so God made a provision you can bring an animal and bring this kind of an animal at this certain thing and when this happens bring this kind of animal bring a bring a a goat bring a kid bring a ox whatever and then this is what'll happen the priest must do this and he'll take the blood and he'll take the parts and take the innards and take the fat and burn it as an incense and on and on it was an entire system the whole system that was God's economy for a person to become uh free of their guilt for the moment and the high priest would go in on behalf of the people and offered blood once every year and he could not enter without blood it was a whole economic system and then when John the Baptist came on the scene the system began it began to have evidence that was going to change and he said don't say we got Abraham to our father God's able to these stones to raise up children to Abraham and these things now were shocking so we say that then when Christ came on the scene and we could go from John to Christ to the Apostle Paul the whole thing went through a seismic uh uh just a seismic experiences a seismic event when those men started to lay aside and Jesus Jesus was telling him the law being fulfilled and yet he was fulfilling it and he was abiding by the those uh scriptures and doing the things which the law commanded and yet at the same time seemed to be uh he said you know Moses has said you said Moses said but I say unto you what is happening here what was happening is that he was imposing on them a new economy because it was a new dispensation and letting them know the way that you used to get rid of your guilt you can't get rid of it anymore that way the way you used to obtain Mercy you can't obtain it that way anymore because there's a whole new system coming into place and then the Apostle Paul comes and starts to speak of the law and Grace and God turns the corner from law to Grace through the apostles Ministry and then we come to the end time and to the last messenger that was the first messenger when you come to the last messenger the whole economy changes again because a uh a bride has been called out of the church Ages which is the age of the woman and the bride gets called out and the bridegroom comes to the bride Weds her and of course you that are married you that are married and have entered into marriage and have married life you know the economy changes when you get married I'll smile you don't have to you men and women can sit there and look Pious and don't want your wife to see that you really know it Chang changed the old song used to say used to say when I was single my pockets did jingle but anyway it's all right you can look at me however you wish but the economy changes after marriage happens and uh things just are totally different when the husband takes the wife and it changes for the wife too so already now at least I've kind of established the thought and the direction that we're going the message this uh this morning and I'll probably have to uh approach it again but the message I'd like to deal with these subjects the the stewardship over the various things that God has entrusted to us that stewardship the dispensations and I more or less have given to you the dispensations or those eras those times when the system which is the system of the economics or the system under which the stewardship operated and then we as I've just said Adam to Noah and to Moses and to Christ the Apostle Paul to brother brandom in our day and then there's a dispensation of the Millennium Reign and that's going to be different and that's going to be very different also from the Eternal day which is the eighth day all right it changes all all through that then I want to approach also in connection with this the utter insignificance of man and that's where it may seem to be uh rather negative but it's not really and I have been very very much affected by the insignificance of man in connection with God in relationship to God and how great is our God and today so much more than being present in a service such as we are song leader Rises we sing songs and we worship and the musicians play and all the apparatuses in motion and we present ourselves in a certain way but I would like to emphasize and impress upon you that God is looking on the heart and everything that we do or present ourselves and how whatever form we present ourselves is really quite irrelevant God is looking on the heart and those things that may appear to be great are not necessarily great those things which appear to be very very insignificant may not be insignificant God may be looking you me you're looking this direction and I'm standing here at my post of Duty and preaching but it might be something that's happening elsewhere in the congregation that God is really focusing on it may be someone's need it may be someone's it may be someone who you never even hear speak or has never been on the platform or who has never risen to sing a song or to pray a prayer in public it may be that person who's actually touching this great God he's he's a very very mysterious God and yet a very present God and I'd like to you to encourage you to make that touch with him the first one to receive uh a stewardship from God the Bible says and regarding Adam and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Adam was given this glorious and marvelous stewardship over this planet called Earth and God gave him a position as a Son of God and God of the earth and you are over everything he placed his son in the message Messiah the prophet said said there's something about a man he's a God he was made to be a god his purpose here on Earth was to be a God to have a dominion over everything of the Earth in the earth and in Genesis again 2:15 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it he was given that responsibility the law of Moses was certainly considered by the Jews as something that encompassed their entire economy in fact as Moses told them Moses told them how to employ their servants their their slaves H H how they would be free the Year of Jubilee the whole economy the entire system was actually conducted by God through Moses and through the Levites which was the priesthood the ministers to the people in the scripture Apostle Paul says now that's the reason I gave you the foundation at the beginning so I can go back and forth from Old Testament to New Testament in in Ephesians 3 and2 Apostle Paul says if you have heard of the dispensation or the economy of the grace of God which is given to me for to you word in other words God has entrusted to me this dispensation or this economy which was a complete change of the system in fact is the Levites as a priesthood was done away with think of the think of the enormously magnitude of this man's position one man in the Earth you talk about a onean Ministry it's one man Ministry and here God through Moses and all of the prophets all down through the whole Old Testament to the coming of Christ and now here stands a man who never even sat under the under the personal Ministry of Jesus Christ on Earth and yet he is saying he's he he's displacing as it were the entire levitical priesthood and putting in pastors and teachers and uh evangelists Apostles and Prophets and establish them as a Ministry and then change the entire system of how the husband and the wife and the children and the deacons and and things which were not even referred to then takes and changes the high priest from the from the from the aonic The Lion of Aaron to the line of Judah I mean this this is something that's just incred it it's incredulous that a man would take this kind of responsibility but God backed him up and so he changed this as I said earlier four times Apostle Paul refers to this and this is absolutely essential no more slaying of animals do you realize animals were slayed by the tens of thousands every year and he with the stroke of his hand as it we is doing away no more slang of animals because the blood of bulls and goats won't do it and he put all the efficacy on Jesus Christ and if you're not washed in the blood of Jesus Christ you still bear your sin and they they could say hey Moses told us Moses God's Prophet with God's word in his mouth that is true but it was a different economy it was a different dispensation and now they moved under another one and he did away with the slang of the animals the shedding of their blood and fact is they could well have asked him are you saying all these millions have been slain in vain like people today said well are you saying that the whole denominational system all the gospel all down through the ages of 2,000 years has been in vain no it's not been in vain it did it thing brother vandom even said don't say they were wrong they were right they were doing their lived in the light that they had but now we come to another economy now we come to another dispensation in the message faith brother Bram said he met Abraham and he gave him the Covenant now not to Abraham if you will do a certain thing I'll do certain things he said I've already passed tense done it it's already settled I've already made the Covenant with Abraham I'm going to save you and I'm going to bring you home with your fathers in a ripe old age nothing you can do about it I've already done it there was completely a different economy completely a different dispensation than what had been in the past the Apostle Paul went on to say for if I do this thing willingly 1 Corinthians 9:17 if I do this thing willingly I have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me he's saying this whole order has been committed to me in Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation now listen closely in the dispensation or in the economy when this system is set up in the dispensation of the fullness of [Music] times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him so now the Apostle Paul has not only saying a dispensation has been committed to me but he's saying there's a there's a time arriving which will be called the fullness the fullness of times and in that fullness will be a time a dispensation or a system will be set up when God will begin to unite the things that are in heaven and the all the things that are in worth in Earth into one which is in Christ which is the word in other words he'll send a word that will gather everything into it and there's nothing outside of that that is called the dispensation of the fullness of times I can tell you we have a arrived we have arrived whereof he said I am made a minister Colossians 1:25 according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God these are the times and this is the day which our Lord Jesus Christ has revealed himself as a bridegroom at no other time has he revealed himself in such a way he reveals himself as a bridegroom for the purpose of being wed to a wife to a woman to a bride and make her his wife a totally different you must recognize and acknowledge I believe you do in your heart but God sees your heart say I acknowledge that our Lord Jesus Christ has not only come but revealed himself revealed himself as a bridegroom and for the express purpose of being united in a new way in other words friend if you're sitting here today and you feel you're just a church member I got news for you there's thousands and millions of them all over sitting in church today feeling as church members you must not feel just as a church member you must not feel as though you're here even just to sing songs or hear a service you must feel and know within your heart by experience that I have been United I am led to one called Jesus Christ I'm led to this word brother Bram speaks Paul a prisoner and he refers to him as being bound being in bonds to Christ being in bonds being chained to the word you should feel that in your heart I speak especially to those that have have been married or are in a marriage Union and there's a certain sacredness with a marriage Union if a person is living where they ought to live in their marriage Union there's a certain you say oh it's just wonderful love it's more than that there's also fear there's a fear there ought to be an awe and a fear Within the heart of a man or a woman to keep their vows to be true to their partner and to live in such a way so that they are respected and honored and respect and honor one another can you not say Amen to that the system of the world the economics of the world spiritual economics has not been to support or to to encourage that but the the scripture teach es that Hallelujah and it can get quiet if you want but I believe that that's the way it ought to be that's the kind of home God intends on having and I believe if we live by every word of God we'll have that kind of home we'll have that kind of relationship that's what God intends Satan's on a war path trying to destroy it and we're on the war path to destroy his work and that is when the management of household Affairs changes dramatically I think the Book of Ruth and I don't want to get on that because that would take the rest of the service but I think the Book of Ruth is the best example of the dramatic changes that takes place once the bridegroom steps in and in her case her bridegroom was bridegroom Redeemer bridegroom Boaz Redeemer and and as soon as Boaz stepped into her life you talk about economics changing her poverty went out the window Hallelujah she wasn't gleaning a few grains out of somebody's field she now became owner of the field Hallelujah she owned it all coming from being a Barren Widow with no children husband dead not only having now a husband but a husband that brought her to be the mother of Kings Hallelujah you talk about riches you talk about a dramatic change you talk about a change of an economy Hallelujah and not only to be the mother of Kings but to be named glory to be named as the mother of Jesus Christ what a what a type she is for us what an example she is for us that's the kind of economy that changes when the bridegroom takes the wife and in the future home brother brandom says he got to number seven in the dispensations and they said now brother Brandon what are you going to do you've run out of you've run out of your complete sevens what are you going to do now now he says now you're a dispensationalist he said which I am and I believe that God is too says you've noticed you've run out of dispensation types if you're going to put something beyond the seventh day how are you going to get it where are you going now he says all right I'll draw your attention he takes them to Leviticus the uh 23rd chapter I believe it is 23rd chapter and then he begins to talk about the eighth day and he he closes with this I don't want to read it all but he closes with this notice he said seven days has to do with the old creation World Time seven days he said that's the Millennium the rest day and God labored six days rested on the sth the church labor six days and rest on the seventh but you're still in a time element but you see there's no such a thing as eight days there's no such such a thing as eight days you go back again to the first day there's another place you break into eternity friends we're in an element of time and we'll go into a millennium which will still be an element of time but the Millennium will blend into eternity the seventh day when you come to the first day of the week which is today is the first day of the week which is the Eighth Day of a week but you you go into another time another era as far as the dispensations are concerned I can tell you eternity is going to be completely different from the Millennium in the Millennium the world is partially cleaned partially judged and after the Thousand Years there's still certain events but let me announce to you even though this body may go to a teaspoon of Ashes there's an eighth day there's an eighth day and we that have eternal life are in that Eighth Day we have it we possess inwardly but we will have our complete being into an eternal realm how we live I don't know it's a mystery do we eat don't we eat we do those things in Millennium what it's going to be like what kind of body we're going to have I only know it'll be a body like his glorious body what is our purpose here talking about a story stewardship what is our purpose here brother Bram says there's no one that lives on the Earth but what at some time in his life or her life he's got to stop and think where he come from what's his purpose here and where is he going here after everyone Everyone likes would like to look Beyond the curtain maybe you're not just in that frame of mind this morning but quite frankly I would just give anything if I could just look beyond the curtain for a moment brother brandham was taken beyond the curtain he came back and said I cannot be the same brother brandham anymore even just that little Glimpse changed his life forever I say God help us to live to live the kind of life let's live with that in view with that in our mind you think that's all right man is not an island to themselves God has placed us here for a purpose and to give an account for our stewardship God is going to ultimately hold man responsible for what he does with the Earth what you do with your body which you're sitting in today what we do with the message what we do as a congregation as part of the community of the bright Jesus Christ God's going to hold us accountable and responsible for our stewardship job in the midst of his despair when he had his sores running from the top of his head to the soles of his feet and was in a Despicable condition and scraping his body and in such pain and despair he cried out what is man that thou should us Magnify Him and that thou should as set thine heart upon him in another place he said what is man that thou that th that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous David said what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him one of my favorite scriptures one I cry out quite often in prayer I say what is I think of God I said what is man that thou are mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him David said again what is man that thou mindful of him Lord he said what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him Paul in the Hebrews he begins in Hebrews in the second chapter he talks about man being made a little lower than the Angels but he says but one in a certain place which was David testified saying what is man that thou are mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him I'd like to take the next few minutes of this service and dwell on our insignificance and how God does not look on the outward appearance but God looks on the heart now someone might say right away when it come to the message and the message says a good deal about uh a woman's dress her hair and her conduct a good deal about men and their conduct and how they act and how we should be and so on so forth and they they'll say right away oh God looks on the heart well the reason though the motive in their heart for saying that is so that they can live worldly that's what's in their heart and that's what God saw now if you're sitting here today just in a certain kind of conduct and a certain kind of deportment we we we conduct ourselves we speak nicely we shake hands and so on but if that's not in our heart remember the handshake means nothing to God it's what's in the heart first it's see and if what God is seeing on the outward is a manifestation of what was in the heart and what was in the heart was pleasing to him then what is being manifested is also pleasing to him have I made that clear tonight we'll take the Lord's table and have foot washing when we are doing that the ACT is right but it needs to be in the heart before it's an act and then the ACT becomes acceptable to God because God sought it in the heart before it became an act young ladies and Sisters of the church if you only dress a certain way because you say well this is the status quo this is what we do in the message but you have no reason for doing it it's not in your heart are you saying you might say to me well are you saying I should just go and live anyway no I'm not saying that at all I'm saying you should get before God and see that it gets in your heart first and let let the outward be a manifestation of what's already in the heart don't do a Warfare when God speaks to us each one about our personal lives we want to make sure it's in the heart God spoke to Samuel I just pray the Lord help us now I have so much and I don't want to rush over too quickly so stay alert if you would pleas please you're a real nice audience this morning and the Lord said to Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him that was one of the sons David's Brothers he said for the Lord seeth not as a man seeth for a man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart God sees the heart and receives what's in the heart and then what what what's in the heart whatever is in the heart will come out will be manifested and God accepts that as well now the most insignificant thing that comes from the heart is infinitely greater than something that you know is out in the open and as a big eye catcher brother brandham was telling about Gypsy Smith how many have heard of gypsy Smith how many haven't heard of gypsy Smith we're going to hear about him now I can't tell you a whole lot about Gypsy Smith but I understand he was saved as a boy about 8 years old understand he was the only one that was at the altar nobody paid any attention that was nothing very great and he was a gypsy his uncle and his father I understand were great Christians but anyway he was in a service and the people and that all the people had give him a love offering and from the depths of their heart he said they had done it many of those people he said are in glory tonight and their reward is with them for helping that wonderful man of God and he said one striking thing now listen son Gypsy Smith told it brother brandham picked it up and now brother bram's telling it I want you to catch it in the context he said one striking thing to Gypsy Smith when he started to leave the audience at night now they' just taken up a love offering so that's quite an event that's happening in a service and when he's leaving the audience that night standing back behind a curtain was a little girl ragged and she had a little present wrapped up in her hand and she said Mr Smith said this is all I have but this is my love offering to you and when he got outside and unwrapped it he said it was a lollipop it was a sucker had been licked on a little bit but she happened to think that it was all that she had to give and he used to tell how it got him said that's right it's all that she had so Gypsy Smith told this a story over and over because it had so gripped him he didn't tell what size the offering was or who put the largest amount in or any of those things even though the prophet says many of them gone on to Glory they've gone on to the reward they got the reward but what got this great man of God's heart was a little licked on lollipop that was wrapped up why because it was all she had we might say that is so insignificant it is hardly worth mentioning but jepsy Smith mentioned it and God's Prophet mentioned it and I'm mentioning it because I want to emphasize there is nothing that is too insignificant to catch the eye of God and to catch the heart of his people and brother brandom Carries On from that and he says you know the one who watched the Widow who put in the two pennies the tithings that time he said he seen listen now this is your Elijah he seen the lollipop don't you believe sure so sure he did he sees everything no matter how insignificant it is he sees me telling this account again today and while it may be so insignificant and so to some it may be so void of a spiritual application but to me it is a it's a profound truth if people can grasp if you can grasp that this God there's nothing escapes him and it's not what I do or what I say with my mouth or what I express in my body my physical being but it's what's in my heart I tell you what friends if we could get our hearts so exposed before God it would change and transform your life your home and this congregation do you believe that then he went on he said Jesus said isn't Two Sparrows sold for one farthing said a farthing's about a fourth of a penny Two Sparrows for one farthing he said how insignificant but he said no Sparrow can even fall to the ground without the the father knowing about it he knows everything so isn't it wonderful to just lay our hearts right out before him brother brenon went on with the woman in another message and he said that she was with a woman now he adds to the story is this all right you're not wearied she adds to he adds to the story said she had perhaps a bunch of children and the little children's Papa was gone and she had two pennies and it was her tithing money just pennies like you all saved and she threw it in the treasury of God Jesus was standing there watching now don't tell me there wasn't a lot of other things for Jesus to see there was a lot of other things that he could have been watching people may be occupied with the architecture and the buildings and the temple and all these great things as his disciples were but here was the creator of heavens and earth watching a widow knowing her husband's dead she's got children at home and he's walking up and watching her and she drops in the two pennies he says and I wondered what would I have done if I'd been standing there he said I'd probably run up and say no no sister don't do that we don't we don't really need it you need it for them children now I said I wouldn't have let her do that but Jesus let her do it he let her do it why he knows it's more blessed to give than it is to receive and he knew what he would do for for her and so apparently there was some something that followed this he knew what he would do for her brother Brandon was praying after this I'm on the subject of insignificance for the moment oh God have mercy I look at the people father and I think of them I think of it here in America my lovely home I love it Lord oh how oh what a great country and we still got the Open Bible we got men of God who stands fearlessly proclaiming the word God how our nation has started off started eating on the other tree he begins to say this is early 1952 two years before I was married I was a young man working when brother Brandon was proclaiming this they've started eating off the other tree said this Free Nation the Bible is open and Men fearlessly declaring the word of God and I can tell you that time they were burning up the country Great Men great you know what it was nothing to have a tent of 20,000 25,000 30,000 people and have it filled every night of the week that was nothing in that era we lived in and others are here that remember those times that happened and they were sending out their circulars and it was almost like a competition who's going to have the bigger tent that's what was happening but I now comes a prophet in the midst of that Revival in the midst of all of that great things happening said they started to eat off the other tree allog together he said by education our seminaries and everything they have to be brought out with the fine scholarships oh he says or they won't receive them and you have to belong to their organization they have to be well trained and taught oh he said what a hindrance how a how a called man of God could be winning thousands of souls while he's in the school Yonder taking it out of him what God put in what a Pity I want you to notice this is why reading this Lord what can I do about it is prayer I'm just a little insignificant illiterate worthy of all of God's Wrath to be poured upon me uneducated born in a sinful family raised by a bootlegged parent oh God how did you ever save me it's a mystery to me with this I have some slides every once in a while I get sent something that I think is in they don't know what they're doing but I think it's important for me I'm continuing with this our insignificance I just want I'm going to show you some slides some pictures that was taken and some comments that were made the spacecraft Voyager One sailed away from the earth in 1990 Voyager at that time was more than 4 billion miles from the Earth on its way out of the solar system and Ground Control issued a command for the distant spacecraft to turn around and looking back take photos of each of the planets it had visited from Voyager fast vast distance the Earth was captured in an infal point of light in this next slide I'll be showing to you in a moment you'll have to look between the two white tick marks actually smaller than a single Pixel of the photo and here it is just there barely visible between those two tick marks right in the middle this happens to be a a ray of sunlight which they had not it was unplanned and uh that was the Earth from 4 billion miles that was caught quite by accident acent the Earth was captured in one of the scattered light rays caused by taking the image at an angle so close to the Sun and now here is an enlargement of the area around our pale blue dot and there is the earth in this Sunbeam of light suspended there we succeeded in taking that picture from deep space and if you look at it you see a DOT that's here that's home that's us on it everyone you ever heard of every human being who ever lived lived out their lives here the aggregate of all our Joys and sufferings thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every Hunter and forager every hero and coward every Creator and destroyer of civilizations every King and peasant every young couple in love every hopeful child every mother and father every inventor and Explorer every teacher of morals and every corrupt politician every superstar and every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a moat of dust suspended in a Sunbeam the Earth is a very small stage in a vast Cosmic Arena think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and Emperors so that in glory and in Triumph they could become a moment momentary masters of a fraction of a DOT think of the Endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants on another the other corner of the dot how frequent their Mis understandings how eager they are to kill one another how fervent their hatreds our posturings our imagined self-importance the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light our planet is a lonely Speck in the great enveloping Cosmic dark in our obscur in all this vastness there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves there is perhaps no better demonstration of the Folly of human conceits than the distant image of our Tiny World it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot the only home we've ever known that affected me very profoundly and in all of that distant expanse God is there omnipresent omniscient how does he radiate his presence out from this universe I think we have God sometimes so small we think he's just you know here and I get all swallowed up with my own Affairs and my own problems and my own and how does God view all of this and before I go on I want you to think that I'm thinking in relationship ship to the message I think of the people that rise up and it helps me to be careful of my actions and my words when I think of the enormous magnitude of a great God who will call me up and you as well and give an account for our lives here on this Earth that he's given us a an area of responsibility someone else wrote and I thought I should leave this with you the scale of the universe is awesome our sun is more than a million times greater in volume than the earth it is only a tiny Speck even the sun is only a tiny Speck in the unimaginable vastness of the Milky Way hundreds of billions of such sums Suns rather make up this galaxy most of them far greater in size than our own and the Galaxy itself is but a tiny Speck among the countless billions of galaxies that occupy the cosmos that science perceives that's what they perceive what they see to set our minds reeling you might say brother Ed this is a service we're here to worship hey my father made all this my parent made this I'm connected to this but we're here today and I'm an infal Speck on a speck of a DOT a speck on a speck insignificant you better believe it our little world and what we make is big things and so on so forth unless it has some Eternal importance unless it has some Eternal significance I say it's just going to collapse into nothing to set our minds at reings it is enough to contemplate the bare distances that astronomy has measured they haven't been able to measure everything this is what they've measured light traveling brother brandham talks about it I'll maybe make reference to it in a few moments traveling at 186,000 miles per second it's already gone some millions of miles just in our in this message 186,000 Miles a second takes 8 minutes to reach us from the Sun but four years from the nearest star eight minutes from the Sun for light to reach the Earth in fact is someone said for all we know the sun could have quit Shing shining it could have exploded into nothing we won't know for eight minutes we'll have to wait to find out from the nearest star it would take 27,000 years from the nearest star from the center of the Milky Way and 800,000 years 800,000 years from the Galaxy androma yet androma is now considered a member of what is called the local cluster of galaxies Beyond which lie countless stars and groupings of stars thousand thousands of times more distant from us than this androma astronomers say the Earth is some five billion years old that's what astronomers say in the beginning God created a heaven on the earth period Millions trillions we don't know astronomers say half a million half a billion years old which means that the entire history of mankind as we record it is but a fraction of a second in the time scale of Earth just Earth it is no exaggeration to say that in this picture of the universe not the one I showed but the one that's being verbally described here it is no exaggeration I want you to catch this to say that in this picture of the Universe man is crushed within Cosmic time he is less than the blinking of an eye in size he is not even a speck and his continued his continued existence is solely at the mercy of such colossal colossal dimensions of force that the most minor momentary change in these forces would be enough to obliterate instantly the the very memory of human life just some little thing then Prophet talks about the Earth bursting with its volcanics and changing the earth I tell you what you can't you can't hardly find the Earth just from 4 billion miles which is nothing it's just a bat of an eye and he's and his astronomers say just some little change could eliminate in just a second that man even ever existed so what is your point brother why have you taken us out there number one my father made all of that number two he had a purpose in it number three he made this little pale DOT number four he put me on the DOT number five he put you on the dot and we're here for a purpose and the only purpose that could possibly be for any human is so this great God that fills all time and space somehow by his presence could come down and and and raise up a piece a speck of dust Out of the Dust of the ashes of this world out of the cosmic forces and and things that he has he has produced to bring so that he can put a part of himself down by the Holy Spirit into the IND individual and make some expression of his greatness Suns and stars and galaxies and all of these things and God chooses us that's insignificance beyond all all all intelligent words talk about insignificant we we can't even we don't even have a word for our insignificant and to think that God God Prophet says this what made him great and he sees every flea and every bug every time it bats his eyes I don't understand the Universe I certainly don't understand God I don't pretend to but the scripture says the 4 and 20 elders and those that were in Heavens and wherever that is they fell down and they gave worship to him Hallelujah and they said Thou Art Worthy oh Lord and I say today Thou Art Worthy oh God lift these lips on this little speck that's on this little speck on this little dot let these lips say something that's worthwhile we'll get out and chatter about what we're going to have for lunch and read our menu and go over and talk about the weather and about the snow and about the ice and a whole bunch of other things that just is worthless but here we are and you can hardly get people to open their mouth to say I want to praise the god that made Heaven and Earth and gave me gave me life to say something about this God we would not have known this invisible God except he came down this power this omnipresent power omnicient God we would know nothing about him except he came down in his in his Beauty in Jesus Christ and began to move about humanity and do good and he saw the sick and he healed them he started the possess and he drove the Devils out of him he's the same God today he's the same God at this moment and he deserves your life your life is worthless with without him there's not a man or a woman or a child that's worth anything outside of this God the only thing you can ever do is Express him hallelujah hallelujah friends don't think I'm beside myself our life is worthless all of our achievements and our accomplishments down here and what we attain to is is less than dust oh we get to some status we get to some position we get some knowledge we get some attitude we get some feeling of importance there's nobody here that's important there's only one that's important that's our Lord Jesus Christ and quite frankly what's been going through my heart I wish I didn't have have to be here preaching I'd like to be off in some Corner oh God oh God whoever you are how did you even you talk about magnifying Grace Grace Hall it takes on new meaning that's why the prophet said how he ever saved me is a mystery to me how did you find me huah how' you ever discover that we were here then when you see this vast darkness of billions and billions of light years of space and think that there's one little speck just one little speck and the prophet said it's his womb he made it for a womb for his seed and here comes every form of seed of life and it's lifegiving it's life in the body life in the animal life life this God of life and then he comes the in Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead bodily and the scripture says in him was life that's why he could never attend a funeral I attend funerals he never attended a funeral he raised him up in him was life this God's not a god of death he's a god of life [Music] if we could catch that and you're here sick you'll go out of these doors absolutely healed cuz he's a god of life he come down into this little speck of clay to let you know he's a god of Deliverance don't you let that enemy of Darkness ruler of Darkness he's going to go into some Abyss let you ever don't let him ever lie to you and tell you you've got something bonded you bound and you can't get think about this [Applause] God how great you are you'll be delivered in an instant how many people can say praise be to God thou are worthy oh [Applause] Lord hallelujah you can turn yourself loose and praise him all you want he's worthy of everything [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah almighty God oh I love thee Lord I love thee Lord and I've come to worship you how you even hear my words that you even see my heart that you hear me oh God that you gave me a voice that I can worship you oh mighty God how insignificant we are what great things you've done oh God oh God oh God he is Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Almighty one almighty God creator of Heaven and Earth and of all things that are therein get Glory To Your Great Name get Glory To Your Great Name hallelujah hallelujah we allow me to go for another few moments th are worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure were they created all of this was created for his pleasure and all forms of life that are on this little blue dot were created for his pleasure and he entrusted man with it and unfortunately Adam ate from the Tree of knowledge and man in this generation I think has devoured the tree they have so glorified the human mind the little fragments of indescribably small insignificant dust particles living on a little blue dot God gave man the stewardship of the Earth who is the god of the Earth the prophet says man that's his domain everything in the earth is subject to the to the man through sin he fell and through Christ's redeeming power he comes back again because the Earth belongs to man you realize a lot of folks are walking on it today that are not going to be here when you'll still be here this Earth belongs to man don't squeeze up now God gave God made this place cuz he already put you here that shouldn't be a mystery he already put you here the only thing is we don't know we don't know our rightful position and that's why a message come that to restore everything everything lost in Adam was brought back in Jesus Christ maybe we haven't come into our full inheritance and I know we haven't but nevertheless it does not change the truth of it and we should be moving forward it belongs to me it's mine it's mine it's mine in Christ the seventh angel sounded there was great voices in heaven saying the kingdom of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever the 4 and 20 Elders which sat before God on the seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God saying we give thee thanks oh Lord God Almighty which art which and was and art to come because thou H has taken to thee thy great power and Hast reigned and here's the scripture I want to leave with you and the nations were angry and the and the Wrath and thy wrath has come in the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou should give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the Saints and to them that fear thy name small and great and should destroy them that destroy the Earth time come when God will recognize his purpose in you on the earth and we'll go and walk into a full reward for for here we suffer all kinds of things but that's there's a Time coming and there's a Time coming when all who are in the world will be judged for their responsibility just think of the world now that you live in the job where you're at the radio program you hear the newspaper you read the magazines that are confronting you regularly the television screens and the restaurant and whatever more to corrupt they that destroy the Earth to corrupt it to cause it to perish to change it for the worse isn't that so to corrupt the minds full page almost a whole page of the Vancouver son I wished I'd saved it but I wouldn't want to read it and the whole the whole the whole subject was that just a few years ago stuff that you couldn't even wouldn't even be allowed on the television screen today not only is a common place but they said that we have come to a certain maturity in the media and now pornography is on the screen all the time I say and God's going to judge them for it God's going to hold them responsible for corrupting the minds of our young people our children of every man and every woman God's going to hold somebody responsible I wouldn't want the man who wrote that software I wouldn't want to be the person who took those pictures and the word to destroy come from another word which is to accuse because he's the accuser he didn't only come to pollute he's the one who devised all of these things to corrupt they destroy the Earth and destroy this Earth he's not only doing that but now he comes in through the back door and accuses you for being what you are for being what he designed a person to be I'm not saying what you are you understand my you understand the context in which I'm speaking this he's an accuser and to accuse is from a Greek word is to throw over or AC Cross or to cross over he was the one who caused Eve to cross over the barrier of the word that was protecting her and enticed her out from the word listen especially young people how this world is designed for young people automobiles are designed for young people the clothing and everything designed for the young people and Satan is behind all of this fashion to entice you across the border of the word the boundary of the word you hold your body's sacred both men and women hold yourself sacred before God let you be oldfashioned be whatever they want remember the little blue dot and you're just here for a speck of time they can't even measure measure that time it's so brief I'm here for a long time don't you even think it one little movement in the cosmos they said they wouldn't even be able to remember the existence of man and we're important it'll help you to realize our insignificance which will cause you to say what what what is there to make my life worthwhile why do I struggle why do I study why do I work what is it all about it's worthless unless God Is In You by the Holy Spirit giving some purpose to your life I declare in the name of the Lord you'll pass off the scene and many many people who come into contact with the message will pass off the scene and and and be a spe that becomes no more unless by the new birth God is allowed to live and Reign and rule in your heart I don't even know how this God can do that I'll say with the prophet it's a mystery to me the National Oceanic and Atmospheric agency NOAA is reporting that the temperatures temperature data collected over the last over 1,200 1,200 monitoring stations just in the lower 48 states shows that 206 was the warmest year on the record and the recordkeeping began in 1895 for for a 100 107 years it's been the last year was the warmest and the News encouraged media reports that the climate apocalypse is a on us if global temperatures continue to rise as projected melting ice caps could rise sea levels worldwide of up to 3 feet by 2100 swamping Coastal communities and are at home that are home for millions of people right now it's in newspapers all the time continuously because at this very moment Canada has a great concern for the polar bears they don't know how to feed them and they're coming down into Churchill Manitoba coming down to civilization because because of the melting of the polar caps in fact is my neighbor who's not a Christian not a Believer as such so RCMP Sergeant who spent time on the Detachment in elmir Island up in the Far Far Arctic region he said he said a year and a half ago a huge chunk of the ice cap actually broke loose of the ice cap itself it broke free and began to drift out he said the Canadian government didn't even didn't even announce it didn't even make it known for a year and a half he said they're they're they're in real trouble man is destroying the Earth One study estimates that a third of the Earth's creatures a third of the Earth's creatures will be condemned to extinction by 2050 if time goes on you young people are going to be around here most of you 2050 not that many years a third of the Earth's creatures are doomed to Extinction if we continue this direction keeping up the current pace of emissions for 10 more years will reversibly irreversibly alter the earth's climate they in other words they won't be able to bring it back to where it should be just in 10 years where did the last 10 years go folks sewage pollution you say well brother Ed I don't know if we want to hear about this well I'll tell you what this statistic is just it pales into insignificance when you think of the pollution that's being preached over pulpits right and in churches and over the radio and in television absolute spiritual pollution and I'm speaking on spiritual stewardship God has given you a great responsibility I say what are you going to do with it you say if somebody here dropped a here here's a million dollars you're in charge of this don't you let it diminish don't you lose it don't you risk it I'll be back I'm going away I'll be back at a certain time and I want to see what you did with it that stewardship not a lousy million dollars that doesn't even appear on the map of God's economy but the Mysteries the scripture says that the that the Mysteries God has made us I can read the scripture God has made us stewards of the mysteries of God I wouldn't take and waste an investment that God gave me and let somebody just trample it under fooot and neither will I take this message and let them trample it under fooot I like what brother Timothy ma said to me I questioned him I because I want accountability I said how do you get these men the these men that are are are are Servants of Christ how do you know they're Servants of Christ he said they have to want this message before I give them a book they have to want it they have to desire and I appreciated that answer the US environmental the EPA which is well recognized for all of you across the border estimates that every year every year in every County Across the Nation I know there's 48 lower States but every County across the entire nation the amount of untreated sewage that enters the environment is enough to fill both the Empire State Building and Madison Square Gardens from every County in Hamilton County Ohio a single sewage discharge one single sewage discharge is 75 million gallons of untreated sewage into mil Creek every year here including during summer months when children swim in the river in Indianapolis more than 1 billion gallons of untreated sewage are discharged into the environment each year because treatment plants cannot handle the flow during the wet weather in each year 1.8 million to 3.5 million illnesses are caused by swimming in water contaminated by sewage overflows and an additional 500,000 from drinking contaminated water in Christianity are you with me in Christianity versus idolatry the prophet now said where it said baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they make Father Son and Holy Ghost three Gods out of it he said they corrupt the ways of God let the people come in the church women with bobbed hair wearing makeup dresses on that look scandalous men so sissified let a woman lead them around by the ear come to the church and playing bunkle games and Bingle and all other things of corruption things and the preachers and so forth out on the banks with naked women dressed in bathing suits and going swimming smoking cigarettes and calling themselves Servants of God when this Temple is the Temple dedicated to God not not to fills of the world say Amen am says I stood there yesterday in end time evangelism just bear with me another few minutes please I stood there yesterday and looked at that swimming pool this is 1962 I stood there at looked at the swimming pool just below us and I wondered when a man who's a Sunday school teacher said to me that ought to have been in the bible where jesus spit and said it's against the sanitation rules when Jesus spit and took his spittle when Jesus spit in the ground and took his spitt and the clay and Anointed The Man's eyes this Sunday school teacher says to the prophet that shouldn't be in allowed in the Bible because of its because of its uh uh uh because it's unsanitary and he says he took his hand and he reached down and picked up the spitt with the dirt and rubbed it to Man's eyes and said go and wash in the pool of silom and your eyes will be will come open and he went and washed and his eyes came open so this fellow said to me that would not work today that's against the sanitation rules the health rules and then that same man take his family wife and all those children down to the swimming pool where those women and men and all that water and all the water at times they in that water at times times of the month that they shouldn't be in and all that they never go into the restroom sometimes and all them dirty bodies and filth in there and them spurting it in and through their mouth and eyes and things like that and then they say that Jesus spitting in the ground to make a man see he says I brought a little boy from there the other day and he said I SW swallowed some of that water and he said I'm sick as a horse I'm going home the little fellow may be sitting here now who lives in a trailer about two or three blocks down the street where I took him and said and he said I'll never go in there again I got paper in my hands the paper industry each year due to the ongoing demand they clearcut logging a half a million Acres every year of Ontario and Alberta Primal Prim Primal fur and Spruce and so on they said there's 32% more carbon dioxide than it did at the start of the Industrial Revolution the industrial era they say that United States put 7 million tons of this pollution in the air brother Bram said Satan's gospel is knowledge knowledge has done this folks we're on a little pale dot a speck in the universe but man is so caught up Bloodshed and War and all the voices you think those voices aren't heard they're circling this little Globe this little Dot and probably going off into the abyss of the darkness of the universe but God knows it all he said knowledge you know Satan's gospel is knowledge and he says do you know that he preached it in the Garden of Eden to Eve and she was deceived by his knowledge gospel and now he has polluted the whole human race with it and that's exactly right you know friends I want to say to you I'm going to be closing soon brother brandham spoke in terms I can even see it as I hear the message I'm listening to birth pains and how this Earth is in such a upheaval and he brings it down it has to it has to give birth it has to it has to conver vse says it can't stand another one but it will this next one's going to birth it into a new world and I want to be a speck in that new world and the only assurance we have today that we will be there I don't want to go off into nothing when we're held accountable for said even if we can say something so simple the little World maybe comes up before God and all you can say I gave a lollipop it was all I had I gave it to a man of God as a love offering do you know what I believe our Lord will say enter in you blessed of the Lord enter in says well master I worked I slugged it out I slaved and I I I build up this and I build up that and I went to church and I became this and I became that what was in your heart that's what's important this morning my wife doesn't like to sing anymore so I don't call on her but she sings a song maybe you'll have the musicians come how about your heart friend what would you say if your heart were made with a window on both sides and people could look through and see what's in the heart tell you what friends this God that made this universe he doesn't need a window on each side he looks right down into our heart and sees us this isn't to be a condemnation he's not looking down to bring condemnation upon us but he's looking down to really see what is there and if it's not there of reality it's not there real experience you know something friends brother red 72 I knil in my desk yesterday and something came to my mind I'm not emotional about this my sisters here we lost our mom as most of you know at an early age she was 11 I was 6 and a half and then from then we didn't know much about home life we traveled a thou over a thousand miles on a train with a stepmother we didn't know either one of us and we arrived in the town where my wife was born in Dawson Creek and that day my my sister was taken to brother bre Lang's home he was overseas in the war and was taken to her home because they had a daughter sister brother Brett's about her age and that's where she would go and I was taken way into the to a Pioneer Family over a river over the piece River on a barge and that's where I spent the next eight months and then I was just tracing my life when I was I was thinking about all of this what what what am I what is a spec all of humanity to God i' I've been trying to comprehend eternity it's been such a a gripping compelling thought in my mind eternity how can it be without how can how can this being who I don't even feel worthy to come in here and talk about him when I know he never had a beginning never had an end who who am I I try to grasp that how can I ever be worthy I can't so it just magnifies Grace gets greater greater and greater and greater with the grace of God and I just was going back over my life and I thought didn't really have a home much didn't have parent it was just like a I can't explain it just like something inside I didn't call for it I didn't ask for it but something inside wasn't in my mind it was he it because it touched me immediately I'm your parent and I found out of my mouth say you're my mother you're my father I came from your seed and you're my mother you gave me birth and you gave me and then I begin to see God expressing himself through individuals and different ones and I then I begin to think of some here in the church and you mothers your mothers to more than just your family even mothers to other and you got that kind of spirit that fathers would give counsel and advice let me say to you young people in the beauty of your Youth and your strength if you spend it for anything other than God by the holy spirit in you it's a total vapor and a total waste and it'll never never be remembered anymore and your little life here as James says what is your life it's even as a vapor it appears for a little while and I showed you today with in the in the in the view of the cosmic all of mankind all of known history couldn't even be known it wouldn't be a flash all of it all of history would be gone what are we in the view of that the only thing the only thing that we can that is worthwhile and we have the little phrase only one life will soon be passed only What's Done For Christ will last and I leave that with you maybe not a great deep message of mysteries and all the rest of it to me this is the mystery of life to me this is something real this has made God so much greater to me J even in the last few days I thought how I been on the road too long I should have been feeling this have to forgive me folks said God why why didn't you why didn't I think of this when I was 20 why didn't I have somebody tell me this when I was young I I feel I could have burned out more energy I could have done more it's had an effect on me I want to serve him and do what I can do and even if it's just a lollipop or some little thing that you think is insignificant when it's from the heart when it's from the heart it's not insignificant it's great in the sight of God and I leave you with this it's not my words I think they'll mean a whole lot more to you when it's a prophet's words and I'd like to just be down I'd like to be across the table for me I'd like to have you sitting in the chair next to me and I'd like to say I'd like to just say well brother brand I I've repeated your words to them I don't care how insignificant want every person listening I don't care how insignificant you it may it may be how little you may be how old you may be I say thank you Lord how simple you may be how many times you've tried to receive the Holy Ghost how many times you've tried to repent how many times you've tried to be right to do right and have failed there's still hope for you as long as God's knocking at your door that's the only thing that counts don't care how many churches you joined how many mistakes and how much fanaticism or how much this you do or that you've done there's still hope as long as God's knocking at your door he said invited the people let's hold a conference that's my suggestion to you let's hold a conference we'll bow our heads dear father with whatever strength and whatever words that you've given this morning I've tried to bring to the people something that you have been speaking to my own heart this morning I pray Lord that you will help us all to see something of your greatness and in seeing that greatness we see grace magnified in seeing our insignificance we see grace magnified in seeing that you could send your spirit and speak and knock at the door of our heart and call us say my son my daughter give me your heart oh God what else is there in life what else is there in in this world otherwise we simply turning our wheels in the sands of time is it where but you have given us oh God such a glorious promise you said you made all these things you made them for your pleasure we have been brought here for your pleasure Lord I want to do and conclude this service before the people are sent and I'd like to just interject in my prayer if you are here and you want to have a conference you feel you need a conference with God pay no attention of who's next to you be a wife husband children or what your position is in this world if you feel that you just need a conference you need to have a something special to you specifically from God all I can tell you is that this God also has said that he would be present and he would respond to our words and to our call if you're here and you're not saved if you're here and you're bound and sin's habits have held you don't let this enemy Buffet you any longer let God be glorified in your deliverance father in the name of Jesus Christ every person who now stands every person who desires something that you have put in their heart to desire they're craving for you they hunger for you oh blessed Lord Jesus come I pray and fulfill the craving and you're the one who said blessed are you you that hunger and thirst after righteousness and I'm hungering after you Lord I'm just thirsting for more of that beautiful Eternal Waters Waters of eternal life in Jesus Christ's name I commit the word spoken in this audience to you prepare our hearts this afternoon Lord for this evening service which we've already prayed for and the communion may it be blessed time and may it be everything be right in our hearts oh Jesus Christ in your name we pray thank you Father amen let's stand to our feet shall we Hallelujah like to sing Jehovah Gyra my provider will you think about this after you leave here it's a different service for me I'm sure a different service for you I'd like to say to this congregation God sent this word to somebody somebody is here that needs that word whatever you do don't leave this place until the full effect of it has gripped your heart and I'm praying that God will even give give you a completely different outlook on your future that you'll hold everything within certain parameters and remember only what is we do for the Eternal kingdom of God really last say amen amen Jehovah Gyra gy [Music] my you are more than [Music] for you are my healer by your I [Music] am you are with me [Music] [Music] you [Music] are you [Music] are before we sing it once again this brother Ed if I just had some final words to you these are words I would say whatever you may have because every home every life every individual person has something that's of real concern this morning even before you came here it's real important to you right from the youngest to the oldest person that's here we have things that weigh upon us I would like you to take that out and look at it inew view of what you saw today on the screen and put it in perspective to this pale PL Blue Dot that you're on right now on an indesirable Speck of dust hanging out in a Sunbeam and look at it and just say in relationship to all of that and God who's in control of it all how important is this and that will put things into perspective for you you got a financial problem you got a maral problem you got a family problem you got some other kind of problem or some other kind of difficulty I want you to look at it in relationship to what I spoke today and just see how important it is and then that will help you determine what you should do that sounds to me like I'm speaking a mystery that to me is so simple some people hold chips on their shoulders for years you want to take that chip on your shoulder and to think well I've been hurt and someone said this and all the rest of it and you have that hurt in your heart and and we're coming to communion tonight take that hurt out hold it in front of you and just see how important it is how important is it going to be 10 billion late years from now how important is it going to be it's nothing it's nothing let God tend to it and he say amen do the right thing so what would be the right thing forgiveness I can think of forgiveness I can think of some I can think of some attributes of God and you you you can too so what would God do do what he would do and then you'll be doing the right thing Hallelujah good thing I've been preaching for an hour and a half or I'd start preaching all over again [Music] you're going to find out one day if you haven't realized it yet that this today was a very important day a very important day and is a very important service with this we're
