[14:31] Ask brother Ricardo, Ricardo, if you'd
[14:33] come and open the service in a word of
[14:35] prayer. Got a prayer request here. We
[14:37] got a prayer cloth as well. Want to just
[14:41] pray over these needs this morning. If
[14:44] you've got a need, just lift it before
[14:45] the Lord as we go to prayer.
[14:48] If you're listening in on the internet,
[14:50] you've got a need, just lift it before
[14:53] our God as we go before him.
[14:57] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you,
[14:59] Father.
[15:04] Let's pray.
[15:09] Father God,
[15:12] even as a song was written,
[15:16] heal me, oh Lord.
[15:19] and we'll be healed.
[15:21] [Music]
[15:22] Lord, we come to you with an open heart,
[15:25] asking you to have your way with this
[15:28] service.
[15:29] Speak to everyone who's here, everyone
[15:32] who's over the internet, wherever they
[15:34] may be, wherever this goes.
[15:37] Have your way with this service, Lord.
[15:39] We need you more than ever before.
[15:42] We just came through some meetings,
[15:44] Lord, and I believe you're still dealing
[15:46] with all of us.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; Can we join our hearts together and ask
[15:50] you have your way with this service from
[15:53] the singers to the songwriters to the
[15:56] the musicians to the ministers. We all
[15:59] have need of you, Lord God. You know
[16:01] where we're all living. And when we ask
[16:04] you,
[16:05] Lord,
[16:06] &gt;&gt; could you lift us up, Lord?
[16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; And could you let us see a little
[16:10] further? Help
[16:13] [Music]
[16:14] the minister who's going to be getting
[16:16] himself out of the way. Lord, we want to
[16:18] see you
[16:20] and we want you to work in our lives.
[16:23] We love you, Father God, and we can't
[16:26] say it enough and we can't express it
[16:28] enough.
[16:29] But we're so glad that you see the
[16:30] intent of the heart. We just commit this
[16:33] service to you, Lord God. We ask you to
[16:35] be with every prayer request that was
[16:37] written, ones that weren't
[16:39] with this prayer cloth. Lord, we pray
[16:41] over it. You know the heart, Lord God.
[16:46] We just commit this service now before
[16:48] you. In your blessed name we pray. Amen.
[16:56] And you can have your seats.
[17:13] I don't think we're going to take a lot
[17:14] of time with preliminaries this morning.
[17:16] We'll uh got one special, I think, and
[17:19] then uh and uh then uh Brother John,
[17:23] sister Leah, and Sister Joanna could
[17:25] come and get ready. You love the Lord.
[17:28] This morning, we got a couple of
[17:30] announcements. Uh there's an
[17:32] announcement here from Brother Dave
[17:33] Chaberna. There's a wedding reception,
[17:36] Brother Dave and Sister Marilyn, on
[17:38] Friday, July the 27th, 3 in the
[17:41] afternoon in the fellowship room. Um,
[17:44] everyone is welcome.
[17:47] Just note that. And also, um, we want to
[17:50] be remembering Brother Biscll. He's
[17:52] going to be speaking this next weekend
[17:54] at Brother Roy Shrewsberry's church in,
[17:57] uh, Beckley, West Virginia. The meetings
[17:59] are Friday, Saturday the 20th and the
[18:01] 21st and they conclude with the
[18:04] dedication of the new building Sunday
[18:06] morning uh July 22nd. They're not having
[18:08] any uh Sunday evening service.
[18:12] Amen.

[25:49] shining
[25:52] through the
[25:59] &gt;&gt; morning.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just lift our hearts up to him.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we're here to worship you.
[26:08] Yes,
[26:09] &gt;&gt; we have made a declaration in song. All
[26:12] I want to see is Jesus.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ,
[26:18] living word, live in us.
[26:22] Live in us in all your fullness, Lord.
[26:26] Live in us, oh God. And having control,
[26:28] Lord. Take control. Take control of the
[26:31] reigns of our heart this morning. Take
[26:34] control of our minds, oh God. Father,
[26:38] help us by the Holy Ghost to bring every
[26:41] thought into captivity to the will and
[26:44] the purpose and the mind of Christ. Move
[26:47] throughout this congregation. Hover over
[26:50] us, oh God, in everywhere, Lord, where
[26:54] this voice is going now. May the Holy
[26:58] Spirit be there with those that are
[27:00] streaming. Oh God, we remember that
[27:03] congregation of people, Lord, that are
[27:06] united with us and we're united here. I
[27:09] pray you'll bring us into one thought,
[27:12] one mind, may the unity of the Holy
[27:15] Spirit. For you said, if two or three
[27:18] gather in my name, there I am in the
[27:21] midst and there to bless. Bless, oh
[27:25] Lord, I pray. I pray you'll bless every
[27:28] man, woman, and child. Bless the sick
[27:31] and the afflicted, oh God. Bless them
[27:32] with healing. Father, we have requests
[27:35] here, Father, that have been made. This
[27:38] couple, oh God, the brother Chris Price
[27:40] witness to. I pray, oh Father, that you
[27:43] will continue your work mighty in them.
[27:45] Our brother Conniving request, Father,
[27:48] for this missionary in Venezuela. I pray
[27:51] you'll make a way where there appears to
[27:53] be no way. Lord, I pray, oh God, that
[27:55] you will prepare the way before him,
[27:57] Lord. take control of the authorities
[28:00] and their decisions. I pray you'll make
[28:02] a way for your word to be preached and
[28:05] spoken and for the bride of Jesus Christ
[28:07] to be visited this morning. Lord, this
[28:10] congregation joins with other
[28:12] congregations. We're praying for our
[28:14] brother Dan Dazley. How that enemy has
[28:17] come against him. Oh God, how that demon
[28:20] father of this age that has become so
[28:23] prevalent in cancer. Oh God, I pray
[28:26] you'll smite that enemy at the very
[28:30] root. Oh God, I pray that you'll take
[28:33] the cells and destroy them. Father, how
[28:36] your prophet messenger was delivered a
[28:40] message by an angel that nothing would
[28:42] stand before his prayers if the people
[28:44] would believe. And we have received the
[28:47] same word. Lord, we may not have the
[28:50] same exact commission, but we've been
[28:52] commissioned by you, Lord Jesus, that we
[28:55] should pray for the sick. That we should
[28:57] lay hands upon the sick. That we should
[29:00] send your word, oh God. I pray you'll
[29:02] send your word and heal him. I ask,
[29:05] Father, and all the other afflictions
[29:08] which he's endured of recent days. I
[29:11] pray, Lord, you'll raise our brother Dan
[29:13] Dasley up. Oh God, give him years of
[29:16] strong usefulness in the kingdom of God.
[29:20] He has a heart for you, Lord. A heart
[29:23] for your people, a heart for this
[29:25] message, oh God. And Satan would like to
[29:28] bring him down. I pray you'll cut him
[29:30] off, Lord. Cut him off. I pray in the
[29:34] name of Jesus Christ. We take the gates
[29:37] of the enemy and walk away with them in
[29:40] the name of Jesus Christ. And for the
[29:42] glory of God, these gates of cancer
[29:45] cannot remain. They cannot stand.
[29:48] Somebody's touching the touching the
[29:50] very throne of God. Lord, reach out your
[29:53] scepter. I pray over our brother Dan
[29:56] Daisley and raise him up for your glory.
[29:59] Lord, for this service this morning,
[30:02] for your servant, Lord, as I give myself
[30:05] to you, I pray, oh Father, that the
[30:08] people will be blessed, edified, built
[30:10] up in the most holy faith. I ask,
[30:14] Father, that Satan will be utterly
[30:16] defeated today in the lives, oh God,
[30:19] where he's tried to afflict them and to
[30:22] affect their spiritual life. I pray
[30:25] he'll be brought low, brought down.
[30:28] Lord, give power, I pray, to your word.
[30:31] May the Holy Spirit, oh God, take it and
[30:35] have the preeminence here today in the
[30:37] name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[30:41] Amen. You may be seated. Or rather, but
[30:43] while you're still standing, I'll just
[30:45] read the scripture. Thank you for that
[30:46] song. Certainly enjoyed that. Lovely.
[30:51] Hallelujah.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can turn to Ephesians
[30:56] uh the 6th chapter. We will have a short
[30:59] reading and then please keep your Bibles
[31:01] open because I have uh quite a bit of
[31:06] scripture that we'll be making reference
[31:08] to. Amen. How many enjoyed the
[31:11] convention? Need I ask?
[31:15] We were asked right away by some of the
[31:17] pastors, you going to have one next
[31:18] year? I said, "You have it and we'll
[31:21] come."
[31:23] Anyway, I want to thank this
[31:25] congregation
[31:27] for your incredible
[31:30] support and willingness
[31:34] to do whatever was needful at any time.
[31:39] And I don't care if it was any more than
[31:41] a warm handshake
[31:45] and to say God bless you with the depth
[31:49] and meaning that you had.
[31:53] uh
[31:56] one of the senior pastors in fact is our
[31:58] brother Gear Roald
[32:01] told me that he was asked by uh one of
[32:06] our couples here in the church.
[32:09] They he they he asked him, "What was it
[32:12] that you were most impressed with
[32:16] in this convention?"
[32:20] And he thought for
[32:22] a few moments,
[32:25] he said, "The thing that I was most
[32:27] impressed with,"
[32:29] he said, "I saw everyone
[32:33] in their place."
[32:35] He said, "When we drove into the parking
[32:38] lot, there was a young fellows
[32:42] just like children." He said, "To him,
[32:44] they were just children." And he said
[32:46] they were standing there and directing
[32:49] us where we should park and directing
[32:52] the traffic. And then when we came in to
[32:55] the auditorium,
[32:57] the deacons were there and all in their
[33:01] place and everyone the sisters with the
[33:05] lunches after the meeting for us to take
[33:08] home so we could have it in the room.
[33:11] And I you probably don't know but they
[33:13] prepared just marvelous lunches and the
[33:18] and all the people that were in hotels
[33:20] because the restaurants mostly were
[33:22] closed and we didn't want them to have
[33:24] to go in that atmosphere and so they had
[33:27] prepared lovely lunches for them. Just
[33:32] enormous sandwiches. they couldn't
[33:34] possibly eat them all and took them to
[33:37] their room and they had other little
[33:40] goodies that were in there and they said
[33:41] there was so much we just we kept the
[33:43] other goodies to take home to our
[33:45] children but he brother Rodal said the
[33:49] lunches that were prepared and then as
[33:52] soon as we walked outside there's the
[33:54] driver standing by their buses and
[33:56] everyone knew where to go and who they
[33:59] were to take and and this what he said
[34:02] he said I saw a church
[34:05] that was fully adopted.
[34:08] Everyone was in their place. That was a
[34:11] good question, Sister Cigarette, Brother
[34:13] Chris, that you asked. And that was an
[34:16] incredible answer. I have never heard an
[34:18] answer like that. And I felt both
[34:21] humbled
[34:23] and proud, if you know what I mean.
[34:26] Just to see
[34:28] the man, a senior brother would say that
[34:31] he just saw the people in their place.
[34:34] That means a great deal. And that's what
[34:37] we preach for. That's what we live for.
[34:40] Amen. God bless you each one. We're
[34:43] going to read at
[34:47] the uh sixth chapter. I'm starting just
[34:50] at the 11th verse and we'll just read
[34:53] three verses.
[34:55] Put on the whole armor of God that ye
[34:58] may be able to stand against the ws of
[35:01] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[35:04] flesh and blood, but against
[35:06] principalities, against powers, against
[35:10] the rulers of the darkness of this
[35:13] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[35:16] high places. Wherefore take unto you the
[35:20] whole armor of God, that ye may be able
[35:23] to withstand in the evil day, and having
[35:27] done all to stand, I'll read the 14th
[35:30] verse. Stand therefore, having your
[35:33] loins gird about with truth, and having
[35:35] on the breastplate of righteousness.
[35:38] We'll just stop there and we'll hold
[35:41] your Bibles open. If you'll just notice
[35:43] please in the 12th verse, we wrestle not
[35:47] against We wrestle not against flesh and
[35:50] blood but against
[35:54] that's that's opposition
[35:56] against principalities
[35:59] against powers against the rulers of
[36:03] darkness of this world and against
[36:06] spiritual wickedness. That's a lot to be
[36:08] against
[36:10] &gt;&gt; and we are against it. God bless you as
[36:12] you have your seats.
[36:17] Brother Brandham said in the contest,
[36:21] the message the contest
[36:24] and the the message of contest is really
[36:28] very interesting.
[36:30] Uh he preaches reproach for the word.
[36:34] This is just in the last of December of
[36:39] 1962.
[36:41] Reproach for the word.
[36:44] The world is falling apart.
[36:47] The absolute
[36:50] sers. Is this the time?
[36:53] And contest.
[36:55] And these come right on the heels of the
[36:59] visitation
[37:01] in vision form of the angels and the
[37:04] announcement. The announcement
[37:07] that the seals will be opened. the
[37:09] announcement which was preparing him and
[37:13] somehow he's directed by the Holy Spirit
[37:17] speak reproach for the word because the
[37:20] reproach would really come in the
[37:22] opening of the word. That's where it
[37:24] really would come and then the absolute
[37:27] because that revelation of the word is
[37:30] the absolute and the world falling apart
[37:34] identifying that that had to happen at
[37:36] this time
[37:38] and then the absolute and then the world
[37:40] falling apart and then the contest
[37:44] because this with this would create the
[37:47] contest and the contest was just on the
[37:50] short service on the 31st before they
[37:52] had communion.
[37:54] So if you put all of those together now,
[37:56] it's it's important. That's why I say,
[37:58] you know, I don't don't believe in just
[38:00] listening at a shotgun style this over
[38:02] here and that over there and something
[38:04] over here. Uh even though that's fine,
[38:07] but in order to get when you know that a
[38:10] certain event was happening at a certain
[38:12] time, a very significant event and and
[38:16] serves as this the time where he
[38:18] actually relates uh the visitation of
[38:22] the angels in in uh in vision form, but
[38:25] he said he was actually there, actually
[38:28] caught up in this consolation. In fact,
[38:31] as his wife was rattling the door and he
[38:33] was over in the corner of the room and
[38:35] had the Bible open to Romans 9 and 33.
[38:40] And I always find that very significant
[38:42] also because how do you have the Bible
[38:44] open to a chapter and a verse? When you
[38:48] open the Bible, you've got many verses
[38:50] there. But he said it was open to 9 and
[38:52] 33. Behold, I lay in Zion a a a a stone,
[38:58] a foundation stone I lay in Zion. God
[39:01] was making an announcement to his
[39:03] servant that he was laying in Zion. And
[39:06] that's that stone is Christ and Christ
[39:08] is the word. So he was laying the word
[39:11] in in a special way.
[39:15] Now, so in this message, the contest, I
[39:18] thought I just want to give that a
[39:19] little bit to you. I might
[39:22] today might largely be a foundation but
[39:25] it's going to be foundation because I'm
[39:28] I'm I'm coming to something that would
[39:30] be
[39:32] uh require a lot of understanding from
[39:34] the congregation
[39:36] and sometimes we have God deals with us
[39:39] in such a way that uh
[39:44] sometime I feel it you know to just let
[39:46] it out to the world sort of on on on the
[39:48] internet sometime time. It may not be
[39:51] exactly what I feel like doing in my
[39:53] heart. And yet, there's people out there
[39:54] that probably would be benefited from
[39:56] it. But, you know, the Bible the Bible
[40:00] deals with it deals with certain
[40:03] subjects and it deals with it in such a
[40:06] uh a way I will say such a intimate way
[40:09] that you almost have to have a
[40:11] congregation like you are that know me
[40:13] as well as you do and I know you as well
[40:16] as I do. I can take certain liberties
[40:18] and say certain things that perhaps you
[40:21] wouldn't say if you were in a visiting,
[40:23] you know, if I was visiting at another
[40:24] church, another congregation. But this
[40:27] this service today will probably be in
[40:30] preparation. Then we'll just have to
[40:32] take the next one as it goes and and
[40:35] follow the leadership of the Holy
[40:36] Spirit.
[40:38] But I I want to speak on uh the correct
[40:41] response to your enemy. And the comments
[40:45] that I just made
[40:48] started this whole this whole service
[40:50] today actually started from reading in
[40:52] Judges and how God used Samuel to stir
[40:57] up his enemy.
[40:59] They were enemies of Israel, but they
[41:01] were God's enemies also.
[41:04] And just to give you a little bit of a
[41:06] clue, the Bible says that he loved a
[41:10] woman from Tenmath, I believe it was,
[41:14] that Samson loved this woman. And he
[41:18] said to, and I don't want to get into
[41:20] it, but he said to his parents, "Get me
[41:22] her for wife."
[41:24] And they said, "Isn't there enough women
[41:26] in Israel that you have to go for a
[41:29] woman in of the Philistines?"
[41:32] And he just wouldn't hear. He said,
[41:33] "Just get me her for a wife." And then
[41:36] it goes through a real unusual set of
[41:40] circumstances,
[41:41] things that happen, and it stirs up
[41:44] Samson enormously, and he he does great
[41:47] damage to the Philistines, and the
[41:49] Philistines come onto him and all of
[41:51] these things. But the Bible says that
[41:53] his parents didn't know that God
[41:57] God was doing this. God was engineering
[42:00] this whole thing. God created that
[42:02] desire within him to love a woman of
[42:04] another nation so that he could get at
[42:07] his enemy.
[42:10] But his parents didn't understand that.
[42:14] And so I'm speaking on the correct
[42:16] response
[42:18] to your enemy.
[42:20] He said in uh contest Jesus said in Mark
[42:24] 16, "In my name they shall cast out
[42:28] devils."
[42:30] people today, he said, don't believe in
[42:33] demons in this day. But he says the
[42:36] thing to do to my opinion
[42:39] is to know your enemy. To know your
[42:42] enemy and train for the contest that
[42:46] you're going to have when you when you
[42:50] meet him because you're going to meet
[42:53] him. There isn't a person here. There
[42:56] isn't a person living that's a believer
[42:58] of this word. But what? You're going to
[43:01] meet your enemy. And you probably, and I
[43:04] think I'm probably right in saying, you
[43:06] meet him every day
[43:10] and know him and know what his strength
[43:13] is. Know what his strength is. And then
[43:17] train for this contest when you go to
[43:20] meet him. For it's one thing sure,
[43:23] you're going to meet him and so train
[43:26] for the contest.
[43:29] The correct response, these are just
[43:31] some brief statements. Now, if you would
[43:33] hang on to each one of them, the correct
[43:35] response is quick,
[43:39] decisive,
[43:41] and with full unmitigated force. That's
[43:46] the correct response.
[43:48] quick,
[43:52] decisive,
[43:53] not you know wish we should wash your
[43:55] well maybe this maybe you know I'll
[43:57] maybe take some kind of measures that's
[44:00] not it has to be quick decisive and with
[44:04] full force unmitigated force
[44:08] undiluted forcemen
[44:15] &gt;&gt; I think often we don't recognize our
[44:17] enemy as soon as We should
[44:21] we need the discernment of the Holy
[44:23] Spirit.
[44:25] We need the active discernment of the
[44:28] Holy Spirit to know
[44:30] where our enemy is,
[44:33] his tactics, and what his intent is.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Often we don't respond as we should.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; We do not respond as quick as we should.
[44:44] We don't respond with with the with the
[44:47] strength. We don't respond with the
[44:49] right weapon and we don't use the
[44:52] provided weapon that God gives us.
[44:59] Most often we do not use the weapon as
[45:03] intended. In other words, I want to
[45:06] explain this as I move along. We quote
[45:09] the scripture.
[45:12] We can make confession by quoting. As
[45:15] brother Brandham says, you quote, you
[45:18] know, confess it. Confess it. But we
[45:21] need to confess what we're living.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, I'm going to read
[45:27] the scripture. Jesus answered,
[45:30] "It is written, man shall not live by
[45:33] bread alone, but by every word of God."
[45:37] Now, let me just make this almost a
[45:40] childproof.
[45:43] by bread alone. When you have a loaf of
[45:46] bread on the table, you can confess all
[45:49] you want what the ingredients are. This
[45:51] is so much flour. It is so much flour. I
[45:54] know it's so much flour. There's so much
[45:58] There's so much liquid there. There's so
[46:00] much of this in the ingredients of this.
[46:02] I have it right here. I've got the
[46:04] recipe written and I can declare it and
[46:06] declare it. That's not enough. In order
[46:09] to live by it, you got to eat that loaf
[46:11] of bread.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And and in fact is if you eat it and
[46:16] digest it into your system, it really
[46:18] doesn't matter how much you can quote
[46:20] the precise the preciseness of quote of
[46:23] exactly. I got this right from the bake
[46:26] shop. I can tell you exactly what's in
[46:28] it and here it is and I'll say it and
[46:30] I'll say it over and over. It does pay
[46:33] to quote it and it does pay to confess
[46:36] it only after you've eaten it.
[46:38] I live by the word of God. That's what
[46:43] I'm living by. My life is an outflow of
[46:46] the word of God. What you see is the
[46:50] word written form in living form. And
[46:53] when you do that and confess it in the
[46:55] devil's face when Jesus when he
[46:59] confronted Satan,
[47:01] Satan knew who he was who he was
[47:04] confronting.
[47:06] He knew that Jesus knew who he was and
[47:09] he knew who his enemy was, who Satan
[47:11] was.
[47:12] So
[47:14] if we live, say, let's say today I see
[47:17] people going down the street. You drive
[47:19] down the street and you see people
[47:21] walking, you see people running and
[47:23] they've got, you know, something on
[47:25] their arm and they're plugged into their
[47:28] with their headset and got their iPods
[47:30] on and and sometime my wife and I, we go
[47:34] down very early in the morning and we
[47:37] kind of see the same people all the time
[47:40] and we we don't get down, you know, to
[47:42] get to walk early in the morning as
[47:44] often as we'd like to, but whenever we
[47:46] get there, they seem to be the same
[47:48] people because they're living by a
[47:50] certain exercise program. They've got a
[47:53] program. They're living by the program.
[47:56] The program calls for them to get up at
[47:58] a certain time and to do certain things.
[48:00] And so they all go and, you know, they
[48:02] do their certain things, whatever it is.
[48:04] But they're living by that. How do we
[48:06] know we're living by? Because they're
[48:07] doing it.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; They're doing it. That's how I know
[48:10] they're living by it. And if we live by
[48:13] the word of God, it's not coming here
[48:15] just to church.
[48:17] That's not necessarily we're living.
[48:19] We're coming here to hear to be
[48:21] instructed, to be directed, to be
[48:24] corrected, to come under the influence
[48:26] and under the impact of the Holy Spirit.
[48:29] But living by the word is you hearing
[48:31] the word and then going out of here and
[48:34] saying, "I'm going to do that. I heard
[48:36] something today. The Holy Spirit made
[48:38] something real to me today that I didn't
[48:40] know last week or I've quoted it many
[48:43] times. I've heard it many times, but it
[48:45] just didn't impact me. And now it's been
[48:48] made real, and I'm going to do it. I'm
[48:51] just going to do it. And I find I'd like
[48:55] to just say this at this early stage of
[48:57] the service.
[49:00] When God sends a message for a certain
[49:02] season,
[49:04] see, the scripture is for all seasons
[49:08] and the entire history of mankind. Would
[49:10] you agree with that?
[49:12] When John the Baptist came with the
[49:15] spirit of Elijah,
[49:17] John the Baptist, he merely it took that
[49:20] prophetic spirit to identify certain
[49:23] scriptures and he reached I'm the voice
[49:25] of one crying in the wilderness. Then
[49:28] Jesus took a scripture out of Malachi 3
[49:30] said he was a servant that was sent to
[49:33] forerun and to prepare the way. And so
[49:35] they take those two scriptures. There
[49:38] are others of Old Testament prophets
[49:40] that reached out to other things which
[49:42] other prophets have spoken and quoted
[49:44] them. Then Jesus, he reached back, man
[49:47] shall not live by bread alone. That's
[49:48] from Deuteronomy. And Moses spoke that.
[49:52] But he picks that up and brings that
[49:53] forward and brings it into his present
[49:56] day because there was a certain
[49:57] condition that was taking place amongst
[50:00] the scribes and the Pharisees that
[50:02] needed that scripture. And then we have
[50:04] a prophet messenger today who said that
[50:07] that the the end time message meets end
[50:11] time conditions. They probably didn't
[50:13] have a marijuana problem uh back in the
[50:16] times of Jesus. I don't know. They
[50:19] probably didn't have the same kind of
[50:21] conditions. They didn't certainly have
[50:23] all the nakedness that's on the street
[50:25] and in the restaurants and wherever you
[50:28] go. They didn't have the same
[50:29] conditions. They didn't have the
[50:32] multitude of denominations. They didn't
[50:35] have all of these things that are taking
[50:37] place today, but we have them. And so,
[50:40] we had to have a prophet messenger that
[50:42] could come and identify in the scripture
[50:45] the scriptures which pertain to this
[50:48] time. That my friend is your weapon.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That that's why the message it's the
[50:55] message is not another book. I've read
[50:57] people just recently in the last two,
[50:59] three weeks where they've said, you
[51:01] know, uh calling the the believers of
[51:04] the message some kind of a cult. That's
[51:07] fine. That's up to them. But on the
[51:09] other hand, on the other hand, and they
[51:11] say, well, the Mormons have to have a a
[51:13] book and other people have a book and
[51:16] the Islam has to have a book. We don't
[51:18] have to have another book outside of
[51:20] this. The messages which we have, they
[51:22] don't understand it. The message which
[51:24] which we have only relates back to this
[51:26] book and it unveils this book. It
[51:30] identifies the scriptures in this book
[51:33] called the Bible and brings them out and
[51:35] say here it is children. Here's the
[51:37] bread for today. Eat this bread. You
[51:42] will be strengthened. You'll be
[51:44] protected. Hallelujah. Eat this bread.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. those things that were
[51:51] sealed up. How could you eat it if it
[51:53] was sealed up? It had to be made known.
[51:56] It had to be revealed. So, it's not
[51:58] another book.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It merely identified those things. And I
[52:05] say there isn't a condition that we
[52:07] experience today
[52:10] that has not been dealt with
[52:13] in one way or another.
[52:15] Brother Brandham said in running a man
[52:17] running from the presence he said
[52:20] Christianity is an everyday
[52:23] rugged life living for God in this
[52:26] present world. Now this is a quote that
[52:29] people use just regularly and many can
[52:32] probably
[52:34] say it from memory.
[52:36] It's a every day a rugged life living
[52:40] for God in this present world. It's a
[52:43] constant burning
[52:45] of the fire and love of God in the heart
[52:49] that sets you a fire and puts you out
[52:52] yonder with the people and making
[52:55] converts to Christ.
[52:57] In the feast church age, he said a life
[53:00] lived by the word would be the word
[53:04] expressed. So we want to say today, I
[53:07] live by the word of God.
[53:11] If we lived by a certain code of ethics,
[53:13] if we lived by certain regulations of
[53:16] some club or some society, then that's
[53:19] what we would be we would be doing that.
[53:22] And they could identify you say, "Well,
[53:24] oh, I see that's what you believe." And
[53:27] I'm glad that a lot of people are able
[53:30] to identify believers of this message
[53:33] because not merely because the way you
[53:35] dress or the way you act.
[53:38] In fact is
[53:42] brother Tom should be telling this
[53:43] because he experienced it. But we wanted
[53:46] to give the ministers and all the people
[53:48] that were in the rest in the hotels
[53:51] because we knew that the meetings would
[53:52] go beyond the time that they could go
[53:54] into restaurants. We want to avoid them
[53:55] from going into restaurants and getting
[53:58] get going from the beautiful atmosphere
[54:00] of the service into into the ungodly
[54:03] atmospheres. And so it was said, "Well,
[54:05] we'll find a place." And someone said,
[54:06] "Oh, there's a place up here, a little
[54:08] place up in in Port Kels, I believe it
[54:11] is." And and he makes massive uh sub
[54:14] sandwiches. Incredible. They are
[54:15] massive. Uh you know, my mouth's not too
[54:18] small, but I couldn't get my mouth
[54:20] around that sandwich about that much
[54:22] meat in it without an exaggeration. And
[54:24] so we give them these have these
[54:26] sandwiches made up in this nice little
[54:28] bag.
[54:30] And apparently the fella that has this
[54:32] place, can I say he's fairly rough? He's
[54:35] raw. He's crass, you know, and just his
[54:39] language is not that good and all the
[54:41] rest of it. And the people that come
[54:43] there are just kind of workmen. They're
[54:44] kind of rowdy and all the rest of it. So
[54:47] apparently some of them were in there.
[54:48] Also, a lady, huh, was in there and he
[54:51] just
[54:53] Sister Karen Ashdone walks in.
[54:57] Whoa. Oh, he said a lady,
[55:02] you know, and there's one sitting there
[55:04] and he wasn't identifying her as one of
[55:06] these.
[55:08] Whoa. You know, be careful how you, you
[55:11] know, conduct yourself. Here we have a
[55:14] lady.
[55:15] So, she
[55:17] talks to him and I don't know what the
[55:19] conversation all is. Then she leaves. A
[55:22] while later in come brother Dier and
[55:25] brother Tom.
[55:27] Now those are two different fellows.
[55:31] And they both walk in and he goes, "Same
[55:34] one." He says, "Oh, you must be from the
[55:37] same place
[55:40] this other girl was from."
[55:43] Man, that spirit was able to identify
[55:45] those two
[55:47] and put them together. So, you're
[55:49] exactly right. And what a testimony,
[55:52] what a witness it was. It was to him.
[55:56] It's really amazing.
[56:01] So, it's not a life. It's not just
[56:04] something you say, but it's a life
[56:06] that's expressed. So, we don't simply
[56:09] confess it. We live by it.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; I'm just making some statements now
[56:14] because uh you'll need these later on.
[56:19] I'd like you to turn in your Bible now,
[56:20] please, to 2 Corinthians, the 10th
[56:23] chapter.
[56:24] And we're going to read a few verses
[56:26] there, starting with verse three
[56:29] down through verse 6.
[56:32] 2 Corinthians 10 and3.
[56:36] For though we walk in the flesh, we do
[56:39] not war after the flesh. For the weapons
[56:42] of our warfare are not carnal, but are
[56:45] mighty through God to the pulling down
[56:48] of of of strongholds.
[56:51] Casting down, notice now doesn't just
[56:54] say laying them down, but casting down
[56:57] imaginations and every high thing that
[57:01] exaltth itself against the knowledge of
[57:03] God and bringing into captivity every
[57:06] thought to the obedience of Christ.
[57:08] Isn't that aren't those powerful words?
[57:11] You can't you can't say that this is
[57:13] Paul is soft soaping things. He's not
[57:16] handling things with velvet gloves. He's
[57:19] got his fist out there and he's telling
[57:21] the people what to do. You cast down
[57:24] these imaginations and every high thing
[57:27] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[57:30] of God. What is the knowledge of God?
[57:32] The revealed truth of God's word cast
[57:35] down anything that's in opposition to
[57:37] it. Don't let it exalt itself against
[57:40] the word. Don't let anybody exalt
[57:42] itself.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you run into it. God bless the
[57:48] doctors. God, we've got godly doctor
[57:51] here in the church and one of the
[57:53] leading in his field.
[57:55] But you know the the medical profession
[58:00] somehow once they come out of their
[58:03] field
[58:06] it seems that they look upon faith
[58:12] as a almost like a personal
[58:16] attack on them or a personal affront to
[58:20] their profession.
[58:22] I can tell you what then you'll find
[58:24] doctors who say if you have faith and
[58:28] I've spoken to doctor and said does it
[58:30] make a difference what a person thinks
[58:33] about you and what they really think
[58:34] about and having confidence in you said
[58:37] very definitely very definitely but what
[58:40] if that person has confidence in God
[58:43] confidence in the prayers of the saints
[58:46] confidence in the supernatural what's
[58:48] wrong with it
[58:50] &gt;&gt; I hear it all the time I I hear it all
[58:52] the time. Heard it just this last week.
[58:57] Sister was listening now. She she told
[59:00] them, you know, they said, "Well,
[59:02] something's wrong with your brain.
[59:04] Something's wrong on the side of your
[59:05] brain." She said, "Well, I've been
[59:07] prayed for now, and I'm going to cancel
[59:10] this certain appointment." And they keep
[59:12] calling and keep calling and keep
[59:14] calling because it's impossible for them
[59:16] to accept faith. Science and faith are
[59:20] two different things.
[59:22] Faith declares what science cannot
[59:25] detect.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Do you say amen to that?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Faith Faith can reach into another realm
[59:33] where science cannot reach. Faith can
[59:36] pull down the promise of God. Faith can
[59:39] bring the presence of the almighty God
[59:42] right into your own being. Faith can do
[59:45] that. Science cannot do that. We're
[59:47] thankful. They're not an enemy one of
[59:49] another to us. But those that become so
[59:52] entrenched that science is the answer,
[59:56] they can become an enemy to your faith,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; not theirs, but what what they put
[1:00:02] forward. So casting down imaginations
[1:00:04] and every high thing that exaltth itself
[1:00:06] against the knowledge of God and
[1:00:08] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:00:11] the obedience of Christ
[1:00:14] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[1:00:18] disobedience. Notice this last phrase
[1:00:21] when your obedience is fulfilled.
[1:00:25] You see, if God is dealing with you as
[1:00:27] an individual
[1:00:29] on a certain area, on a certain aspect,
[1:00:31] on maybe a certain part of your life or
[1:00:33] a certain thing, and you just, you know,
[1:00:36] you struggle with it and you wrestle
[1:00:37] with it and and so on so forth. But then
[1:00:40] when you come to the place where you
[1:00:42] want to have a revenge on all
[1:00:45] disobedience, remember Paul says when
[1:00:47] your obedience is fulfilled,
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; when you do your own, do with what God
[1:00:52] is doing. In other words, it might even
[1:00:54] be in your own situation. You're asking
[1:00:57] God for a certain answer. Oh, and you
[1:01:00] want a certain desire that a certain
[1:01:02] thing will take place. But down here is
[1:01:06] an area of your life that you've not
[1:01:08] been able to bring into full obedience
[1:01:11] to the word of God and God has dealt
[1:01:13] with you. Could be just a it could be
[1:01:15] the most uh elementary thing for a
[1:01:19] Christian, for a believer, but it just
[1:01:21] keeps, you know, just keeps uh uh
[1:01:26] you know nagging on you. Just one of
[1:01:28] those nagging things down there. You
[1:01:30] know what I mean?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not alone here.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And then you face you're confronted with
[1:01:35] something. You want an answer and you
[1:01:37] want to bring this thing into subjection
[1:01:40] to the word of God. And I've got a
[1:01:42] promise of God. One thing I want you to
[1:01:44] go out of here today and remember that
[1:01:46] you can bring revenge on that once your
[1:01:49] obedience is fulfilled in the other
[1:01:52] areas.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just want to make that point.
[1:01:58] The believer's life
[1:02:01] is one of conflict.
[1:02:04] And Paul compares the Christian life
[1:02:06] with warfare.
[1:02:10] He expresses also many difficulties
[1:02:13] and knew well that his adversary the
[1:02:16] devil goes about as a roaring line and
[1:02:19] we heard it in the conference as well.
[1:02:22] And I'm not referring now to the
[1:02:25] struggles of life because we all have
[1:02:28] normal struggles of life. I have to be
[1:02:31] very careful here. Satan can use the
[1:02:34] circumstances and the normal rigors of
[1:02:37] life. We have you know some of our some
[1:02:40] of our the details of our life can
[1:02:43] become very very
[1:02:45] you know very strenuous and in this day
[1:02:49] is a day of pressure and we all have it
[1:02:52] at all levels. You can take a person
[1:02:54] from the simplest you can think of the
[1:02:57] most simplest form of life and
[1:03:00] livelihood. They could go in and punch a
[1:03:03] clock at 8 and walk out at four and you
[1:03:06] think they haven't got a problem in the
[1:03:08] world, but you'll find that person under
[1:03:10] pressure. Then you'll find the
[1:03:12] businessman under pressure. You'll find
[1:03:13] the housewife under pressure. She's got
[1:03:15] to get the children off to school and
[1:03:17] they've got this program and they've got
[1:03:19] the music lesson. They've got something
[1:03:20] else and they're just going from morning
[1:03:22] to night. Isn't it so? No, you're
[1:03:25] sitting quiet because you know that
[1:03:27] that's exactly the truth. the children
[1:03:29] and the young people are under pressure
[1:03:31] at at school. They've got this project
[1:03:33] and they've got that game and they've
[1:03:35] got to prepare for this and and why?
[1:03:37] It's Satan's Eden.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. It's Satan's
[1:03:41] Eden. And of course, if if you're not,
[1:03:44] you know, experiencing that, then God
[1:03:46] bless you. Whatever you do to protect,
[1:03:49] protect what it is you're doing or not
[1:03:51] doing.
[1:03:58] sinner and saint alike experience these
[1:04:00] things. That's why I said
[1:04:04] it's not necessarily you know sometime
[1:04:06] that's why I said know your enemy.
[1:04:08] Sometimes these are just things
[1:04:11] of normal life that you have to go
[1:04:14] through
[1:04:16] and sometimes they are also creations of
[1:04:19] our own selves. We create the situation.
[1:04:24] We, you know, we've agreed to something
[1:04:26] and then we make certain decisions and
[1:04:29] then we find ourselves in a certain
[1:04:31] place and having to deal with certain
[1:04:34] things and it's something of our own
[1:04:36] creation.
[1:04:38] And I and my wife, we've had discussions
[1:04:40] about this and we say, "Well, we ought
[1:04:42] to just, you know, rebuke the devil or
[1:04:44] take control over the devil." I said,
[1:04:45] "Well, no, I don't think it's the devil.
[1:04:47] I think it's just us. I think we we did
[1:04:51] this. We made these decisions and we
[1:04:53] created this situation and our heavenly
[1:04:55] father's just saying, you know, you got
[1:04:57] into it. Get out.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Ever feel that way?
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You made the decisions. You You
[1:05:05] didn't consult me. And lot I get it all
[1:05:08] the time, too. I get, you know, I get
[1:05:10] asked for you give me advice. Well, what
[1:05:12] kind of advice do you want? You know,
[1:05:14] well, uh uh is is the decision to be
[1:05:17] made or has it been made? No, it's been
[1:05:20] made. It's a It's already made. Well, I
[1:05:22] I hope it works out. I hope everything's
[1:05:24] fine for you. But there's nothing for me
[1:05:26] to say. It's always after the fact. You
[1:05:29] know,
[1:05:32] can't do anything after the fact.
[1:05:36] The Bible says this.
[1:05:43] But this I say, brethren, the time is
[1:05:46] short. It remainth that both they that
[1:05:49] have wives be as though they have none,
[1:05:53] and they that weep as though they wept
[1:05:55] not, and they that rejoice as though
[1:05:59] they rejoice not, and they that buy as
[1:06:02] though they possess not,
[1:06:04] and they that use this world as not
[1:06:08] abusing it, for the fashion of this
[1:06:11] world passeth away. Now this is the
[1:06:14] Apostle Paul and he's giving very very
[1:06:17] sound advice is he's saying he's saying
[1:06:21] they that have wives as though they have
[1:06:23] none. In other words, and they that weep
[1:06:27] as though they wept not. We have
[1:06:29] something to weep over.
[1:06:32] We have responsibilities
[1:06:35] but they are not to consume us.
[1:06:41] You know if you have some uh something
[1:06:45] that brings grief, something that brings
[1:06:47] some kind of calamity that happens
[1:06:50] because everybody has a calamity.
[1:06:54] And Paul is saying, don't major on it.
[1:06:57] Don't just stay. Don't let it destroy
[1:06:59] your spiritual life. And it can do so.
[1:07:02] You might as well say, "Amen, folks. I'm
[1:07:03] going to preach it till it comes
[1:07:04] through."
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Years later, years later, they can
[1:07:09] remember something that happened way
[1:07:11] back there. way back there. And that
[1:07:13] thing years ago is affecting their
[1:07:15] spiritual life today. And Paul is
[1:07:19] saying, you know, if you have a wife, be
[1:07:23] as though you haven't got one, not as
[1:07:25] though you disregard her or disrespect
[1:07:27] her or her to him. It is that you you're
[1:07:29] focused on your spiritual life on what
[1:07:32] God has you here for and and home and
[1:07:36] life and family and job and everything
[1:07:38] else is to have its proper position
[1:07:42] because the scripture also deals with
[1:07:44] employers and employees and how you
[1:07:46] serve your master and how you be loyal
[1:07:49] and you work with integrity. All of
[1:07:51] that's in the word too. Paul is not
[1:07:53] saying disregard this. But he said if if
[1:07:56] you wept be as though you didn't weep. I
[1:07:59] that has happened all right but I must
[1:08:01] go on.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And then if you have something wonderful
[1:08:04] that happened to you and you just oh it
[1:08:06] just is brings you into ecstasy. This is
[1:08:09] the most glorious thing. Fine great
[1:08:11] enjoy it. But don't just don't just stay
[1:08:14] with that all the time. Continue on.
[1:08:16] Move on from there. Bad things happen.
[1:08:19] Good things happen. Hardships happen.
[1:08:22] Calamities happen. Great things happen.
[1:08:25] Joyous things happen. You know, we've
[1:08:27] had a wonderful convention. You're not
[1:08:29] going to hear me talking about the
[1:08:30] convention, how glorious it is for weeks
[1:08:32] and weeks and weeks. We've had it and
[1:08:34] we've had it as though we we have the we
[1:08:37] have it whatever God intended. Praise
[1:08:39] God. And we go on. It's as though we
[1:08:41] didn't have a convention because we're
[1:08:43] looking forward for whatever God has
[1:08:45] today, tomorrow. I can't live on last
[1:08:48] week. I'm living on this word now.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We heard some good word.
[1:08:54] That's great. But we're moving on from
[1:08:56] there.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:06] We must be constantly aware.
[1:09:10] Constantly aware. And I'm staying close
[1:09:12] to my notes because I have labored over
[1:09:14] this and really line by line. And this
[1:09:19] how I want to bring it to you for now.
[1:09:22] We must be constantly aware that we are
[1:09:26] living in Satan's Eden.
[1:09:29] A prophet messenger gave you that term,
[1:09:32] Satan's Eden. We are in Satan's Eden.
[1:09:35] And none of us are going to reverse
[1:09:37] that. This is Satan's Eden. Where you
[1:09:40] work is Satan's Eden. Where you shop is
[1:09:42] Satan's Eden. The clothes that you have
[1:09:46] to choose from have been designed by
[1:09:48] people living in Satan's Eden.
[1:09:51] Everything that you hear in the media is
[1:09:54] completely
[1:09:56] completely saturated and permeated
[1:09:59] through and through with Satan's Eden.
[1:10:02] And that's why we need discernment of
[1:10:04] the Holy Spirit every day of our life so
[1:10:07] we can live our life godly in the midst
[1:10:10] of Satan's Eden. We are in the world,
[1:10:13] but you are not of the world.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; We're constantly in need of that divine
[1:10:20] divine discernment.
[1:10:23] And it is a modern
[1:10:25] advanced society that we are in where
[1:10:29] beauty plays a big part, a big role.
[1:10:32] It's beauty in the automobile industry.
[1:10:36] It's beauty in the sports program and
[1:10:39] the sports world. everything is too so
[1:10:42] appealing to the eyes. The media has
[1:10:45] become so that you you you could
[1:10:48] scarcely uh take your eyes off it if you
[1:10:51] walk in and there's a bunch of football
[1:10:54] players in on a big giant screen when
[1:10:57] you walk into a restaurant or a a
[1:11:00] shopping center and there's all it's
[1:11:03] it's designed to appeal to the human
[1:11:06] nature, the base human nature. I'm not
[1:11:09] talking about sinful things. I'm just
[1:11:11] talking about something that is that is
[1:11:13] out there to lay hold of you to give
[1:11:16] entrance to a spirit.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Want you to really hang on to that.
[1:11:25] And so it is critically important for us
[1:11:28] as believers
[1:11:31] to have the discernment of the Holy
[1:11:33] Spirit operating at all times in our
[1:11:36] lives.
[1:11:38] and that we use the world, we use what
[1:11:43] is made available to us to edify the
[1:11:46] bride body of Jesus Christ and for the
[1:11:49] advancement of the kingdom of God. We
[1:11:52] use it, but we don't abuse it in that in
[1:11:55] that term. This is the scripture which I
[1:11:58] read.
[1:12:00] Weep not, they that weep as though they
[1:12:02] wept not. They that rejoice as though
[1:12:04] they rejoice not. And they that they
[1:12:07] that buy as though they possess not.
[1:12:12] Now you folks aren't going to live very
[1:12:13] long before you buy something.
[1:12:16] And they that use this world
[1:12:20] for we are they.
[1:12:22] We do use this world
[1:12:25] as not abusing it. And the word abusing
[1:12:29] or the word use is to make simply make
[1:12:31] use of something. Buy a vehicle. Make
[1:12:34] use of it. Use it for the kingdom of
[1:12:36] God. Make sure you drive it to church.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Let me be upfront. There's people who
[1:12:45] claim to be believers who got wheels and
[1:12:49] are not here in the church this morning.
[1:12:51] And I say to them, if they're listening
[1:12:54] streaming, you ought to be here. We
[1:12:56] don't have the streaming for people just
[1:12:57] so they can sit at home. We have
[1:12:59] streaming so people who are sick, people
[1:13:02] who can't get to church. But the prophet
[1:13:04] said, "And now here's the word that is
[1:13:06] there to protect you." See, it says you
[1:13:09] should be waiting at the door. Is that
[1:13:11] what he said? Oh, that's just a little
[1:13:13] terminology. That's just some night
[1:13:15] poetic language, is it? Or is it? What
[1:13:17] does he really mean? What he said? We
[1:13:19] ought to be waiting at the door. We
[1:13:21] ought to be in the house of God. We
[1:13:23] ought to be there to give for our full
[1:13:25] support to the brother, the sister
[1:13:27] that's beside us, to say a word, an
[1:13:29] encouraging word, to give a smile, to
[1:13:31] give a handshake, to put our money in
[1:13:33] the offering, all a part of worship. We
[1:13:36] ought to be here in the house of God. Do
[1:13:37] you believe it? That's what said
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and that's the protection.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; That's the protection.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; That is what we're living by.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; We're living by the word.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, living by it is doing
[1:13:51] it.
[1:13:53] doing it
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and not abusing it. And the abusing of
[1:14:00] it is to use much excessively
[1:14:03] or to use up or to consume by use. To
[1:14:07] use it up fully, well, we're living in a
[1:14:10] very
[1:14:12] uh a world that's given over to it.
[1:14:15] We're a throwaway generation. I'm not
[1:14:17] just on to things of our present time,
[1:14:19] but I'm I'm I'm leading all up to let
[1:14:22] you know that there's a spirit of the
[1:14:24] age that's behind that. Use it all up.
[1:14:26] Throw it away. Oh, get another one. Get
[1:14:29] a new one. That one doesn't, you know,
[1:14:31] we're we're using the world, but we're
[1:14:34] not to abuse it.
[1:14:37] In other words, because Paul knows that
[1:14:40] by abusing it, we can we become we
[1:14:44] ourselves become consumed by what we're
[1:14:46] consuming.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; We got to we got this. Oh, we got to get
[1:14:53] another one. We got to get a better one.
[1:14:54] We got to do this. In order to do that,
[1:14:55] we got to work hard. I got to get
[1:14:57] another job so I can pay for what all
[1:14:58] these things that we're doing and so on
[1:15:00] so forth. and and and then pretty soon
[1:15:04] Satan's tactic
[1:15:06] while you're consuming things, his
[1:15:09] tactic is to consume you.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; He wants to consume you and I. So, we
[1:15:17] get on the treadmill. Oh, it might be
[1:15:20] real quiet in here, friends, but I know
[1:15:22] what I'm talking about. We get on the
[1:15:23] treadmill and and Satan sees you through
[1:15:27] your years. You got to study, study. got
[1:15:30] stacks of homework. I got projects I've
[1:15:33] got to do study. I'm just in my youth,
[1:15:35] but I've got energy and I've got
[1:15:37] strength and I've got to do this because
[1:15:39] I got to get to a certain mark in my
[1:15:41] life and then when I get that I get my
[1:15:43] title or whatever I am and then I'm then
[1:15:46] I'm free. I'm done with my studies.
[1:15:48] You're just starting
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; because now you got to work work work to
[1:15:54] pay for your studies. Oh, I'll be done
[1:15:58] now. I'm going to, you know, you're
[1:15:59] going to smile at this because you know
[1:16:01] exactly where I'm coming. And then you
[1:16:03] just go and then finally, oh, you meet
[1:16:05] the person of your life and you get
[1:16:07] married and from marriage comes children
[1:16:10] and more and more and the thing keeps
[1:16:12] expanding. The kids need this. The kids
[1:16:14] need a horse. Oh, we need an acreage
[1:16:16] now. We need this. We need something
[1:16:18] else. We're just going, going, going.
[1:16:20] And finally, finally the devil says,
[1:16:22] "What do you know? I got them 60 years
[1:16:24] old and I just wasted their whole life.
[1:16:28] And they're at a place now where they
[1:16:30] can hardly do anything for God. They're
[1:16:31] all decrepit and all stooped over and
[1:16:34] they work so hard. They're hip joints
[1:16:36] and their knee joints and everything
[1:16:38] else is all shot and
[1:16:46] saying, "Brother Ed, I'm still young.
[1:16:50] I'm still youthful. I still got a strong
[1:16:53] body. I've got a good set of eyes. I've
[1:16:57] got some skills. I can use the computer.
[1:17:00] I can use a typewriter. What can I do?
[1:17:03] Is there something I can do? I don't
[1:17:04] care how small it is. Is there something
[1:17:05] I can do for God? Just a little thing. I
[1:17:08] don't care. I don't need any I don't
[1:17:10] need to be seen. I don't need, you know,
[1:17:12] I don't need to be recognized. I just
[1:17:14] want any little thing I can do.
[1:17:25] You know, I'm always thinking of things
[1:17:26] in a kind of a business way anyway
[1:17:30] because getting the gospel out is is big
[1:17:32] business.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Big business. If you don't think so, you
[1:17:36] should just pay for this convention.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Boy, that brought the quietest amen,
[1:17:43] brother Diddy, I've seen for a long
[1:17:45] time.
[1:17:48] It cost something.
[1:17:51] You know, we've got a little kitchen
[1:17:54] here.
[1:17:55] I shouldn't be saying this publicly, but
[1:17:57] I thought I think about it all the time.
[1:18:01] And uh and the office staff and everyone
[1:18:04] here and we have to try to run out at
[1:18:07] different times and and get a bowl of
[1:18:09] soup and get something. and the sisters
[1:18:11] are eating their soup or their salad or
[1:18:13] whatever else their diet stuff and so on
[1:18:16] at the counter and answering phones and
[1:18:18] trying to, you know, and I thought,
[1:18:20] wouldn't it be something if God would
[1:18:22] just lay it on some sister's heart and
[1:18:23] say, "You know what? I can make a I can
[1:18:26] make a fantastic pot of soup and I'll
[1:18:28] come in there and and if someone came
[1:18:31] forward and said that, I'd say, we'll
[1:18:33] pay you.
[1:18:35] I'd far sooner pay you than Moxy's
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; or Earls
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; or McDonald's.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know what a blessing that would
[1:18:47] be? We wouldn't have to go into that
[1:18:50] environment
[1:18:52] of the world. We'd just be with
[1:18:54] believers.
[1:18:56] And oh well,
[1:19:01] now I'm going to be like brother brother
[1:19:03] Rodal. Okay.
[1:19:05] We got it said. Now we go on. Wouldn't
[1:19:07] that be all right, Brother Darren? Oh,
[1:19:10] I'm sure if I had hands for the office
[1:19:12] staff here, they'd all raise their hand.
[1:19:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:21] I'm going to read 1 Timothy 6:17
[1:19:25] and 19 to 19.
[1:19:28] Charge them that are rich in this world,
[1:19:31] that they be not high minded, nor trust
[1:19:34] in uncertain riches,
[1:19:37] but in the living God, who giveth us
[1:19:39] richly all things to enjoy,
[1:19:42] that they may do good, that they may be
[1:19:45] rich in good works, ready to distribute,
[1:19:49] willing to communicate,
[1:19:51] looking up in laying up in store for
[1:19:55] themselves a good foundation against the
[1:19:59] time to come that they may lay hold on
[1:20:02] eternal life.
[1:20:04] So Paul is saying to Timothy that we
[1:20:08] charge those that are rich in the world.
[1:20:10] And that's a very relative thing because
[1:20:12] some say, "Well, I'm not rich." Well, it
[1:20:14] depends if you were comparing yourself
[1:20:15] with someone else in the world that
[1:20:17] could be. but not to be high-minded, not
[1:20:19] to trust in uncertain riches, but in the
[1:20:22] living God, who giveth us richly all
[1:20:24] things, that they do good, and that they
[1:20:27] be rich in good works, and ready to
[1:20:30] distribute, and willing to communicate,
[1:20:33] laying up, laying in store, up in store
[1:20:37] for themselves, a good foundation
[1:20:39] against the time to come, that they may
[1:20:43] lay hold on eternal life.
[1:20:46] Then I'm reading out of first out of
[1:20:48] first Peter also 5 and8. And I will be
[1:20:51] coming back to these things in a moment.
[1:20:55] Be sober.
[1:20:57] Be vigilant because your adversary the
[1:21:00] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:21:03] seeking whom he may devour.
[1:21:06] Whom resist steadfast in the faith
[1:21:09] knowing that the same afflictions
[1:21:12] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:21:14] are in the world. Now the reason I read
[1:21:17] that is because
[1:21:19] uh you know many times I find amongst
[1:21:21] the Christians they're inclined to
[1:21:24] believe that you know all the natural
[1:21:26] things that happen just a daily life in
[1:21:28] the world. Oh it's the devil. It's just
[1:21:31] the devil. It's the devil. And brother
[1:21:33] Brandham says know your enemy. Now the
[1:21:36] Bible says that these things uh
[1:21:41] it said resist whom resist steadfast in
[1:21:44] the faith in the faith knowing that the
[1:21:47] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:21:51] your brethren that are in the world. So
[1:21:53] I want to say to you the people in the
[1:21:55] world have difficulty. We have
[1:21:57] difficulty. They have disappointments.
[1:22:01] We have disappointments. They have
[1:22:03] calamities. We have calamities. They
[1:22:06] have grief. We have grief. All of those
[1:22:08] things. But but now Satan might, and
[1:22:12] here's the critical part, Satan can use
[1:22:16] that against us. He can use a
[1:22:19] circumstance. He can use some calamity.
[1:22:23] He can use some reversal against the
[1:22:26] believer.
[1:22:28] But it's not necessarily it's not that.
[1:22:31] That's why brother Brandham said it's
[1:22:32] not that God is displeased with a person
[1:22:35] that he allows these things. We have
[1:22:37] reversals. We have uh we have financial
[1:22:41] stresses and all kinds of things that
[1:22:44] come our way and things when even when
[1:22:46] you're trying to serve God, you can have
[1:22:49] some of the greatest disappointments.
[1:22:54] If you folks haven't experienced it,
[1:22:57] you're looking at somebody here and I've
[1:22:58] had my great disappointments trying to
[1:23:01] do something for God,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; extending extending my own personal self
[1:23:07] for the kingdom of God and the whole
[1:23:09] thing just goes right down the tube,
[1:23:14] right? You lose time. You lose
[1:23:17] resources. You can lose money.
[1:23:20] You can lose and lose time and precious
[1:23:23] time. And I've even said, "God, help me
[1:23:25] to be able to identify, you know,
[1:23:28] exactly." And even though you can be
[1:23:30] doing it just as as as with a pure
[1:23:33] heart, uh, as sincerely as possible, and
[1:23:37] then the whole thing can turn in
[1:23:39] reverse.
[1:23:41] If I get anything out of the messages
[1:23:44] I've been reading and I've been reading
[1:23:46] the contest or listening to reproach for
[1:23:48] the word, listening to these things and
[1:23:51] what Paul is saying is, you know, you
[1:23:54] have a disappointment.
[1:23:56] So
[1:23:58] all I I I then I go I go back to the I
[1:24:01] go back to the message which brother
[1:24:03] Brandham said things that were
[1:24:05] identified and I believe it's a message
[1:24:08] that has come to give us what we need.
[1:24:11] It's a message for endtime conditions.
[1:24:14] So, we have an end time condition. And
[1:24:16] he said, "Simple, simple. Put a bullet
[1:24:18] in the gun. If it doesn't fire,
[1:24:22] so what? You going to say, "Okay, you're
[1:24:23] going to throw this whole thing away.
[1:24:25] We're not going to do this anymore." No,
[1:24:27] just put another bullet in.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; So, we had one, it didn't fire. It just
[1:24:31] went, it was a total disaster. It didn't
[1:24:33] work. We lost We lost time. We lost
[1:24:38] money.
[1:24:40] I invested in a piece of property one
[1:24:43] time and had several other brothers.
[1:24:46] There were five in total. And I had
[1:24:49] these other brothers because they were
[1:24:51] all involved in the ministry and the
[1:24:55] missions. And some of them, you know,
[1:24:57] this whole church knows, but you don't
[1:24:59] know anything about this situation.
[1:25:01] Maybe just my own family. And I invested
[1:25:04] in some properties and the whole thing
[1:25:07] went sour. And we had a we had a
[1:25:11] economic collapse
[1:25:13] in 1980s
[1:25:15] and property went down like 40 50 and
[1:25:18] 60%
[1:25:20] and it was in cut in half
[1:25:24] and I was still paying on one property
[1:25:27] and we were hoping that it would you
[1:25:29] know develop into something and then
[1:25:31] these five all five would benefit
[1:25:34] equally from this and one was pastoring
[1:25:36] and he's pastoring now and one one
[1:25:39] traveled and did a lot of mission work
[1:25:41] and I thought this is this is marvelous
[1:25:43] and another brother had introduced me to
[1:25:45] it. So we just went the whole thing
[1:25:47] totally went sour. I lost the property
[1:25:52] and lost a lost a lot of I had to I had
[1:25:56] to stand good for it.
[1:25:58] I had to sell things.
[1:26:03] So you've never heard this. I had a nice
[1:26:05] boat. I sold the boat. I had a little
[1:26:09] place that I would retreat to. I sold
[1:26:11] it. And the banker even asked me months
[1:26:14] and many, many months later. He said,
[1:26:18] "How did you pay this off?"
[1:26:21] I said, "Well, I sold things.
[1:26:25] I took pictures off my wall.
[1:26:28] I had a little cabin. I sold that. I had
[1:26:31] a boat. I sold that. And I paid this bad
[1:26:34] debt off.
[1:26:37] And he says, "And we respect you because
[1:26:40] there's a lot of other people that
[1:26:41] wouldn't have done that. They would have
[1:26:43] just left us holding, you know, they
[1:26:44] would have left us holding the bag and
[1:26:46] we probably wouldn't have been able to
[1:26:47] collect. And we respect you for that."
[1:26:51] Well, you never heard me say that.
[1:26:53] That's 20 years ago. That's 25 years
[1:26:55] ago. You think that that's going to stop
[1:26:58] a person if I let and I just mold that
[1:27:01] over and mold that over? No one else had
[1:27:03] anything invested. I was the only one
[1:27:05] that had things invested and I was the
[1:27:07] only one that had, I think, borrowing
[1:27:08] power, so I borrowed and did it and had
[1:27:11] to pay pay it off.
[1:27:14] You say, "Well, uh, you know, you could
[1:27:16] afford it." No, I couldn't. I couldn't
[1:27:18] afford it. I just had to do it. So, you
[1:27:20] say, "What do you do?" Then I prayed. I
[1:27:23] said, "Lord, you know, I'm down to the
[1:27:25] bottom of my resources."
[1:27:29] The Lord knew what the purpose, what the
[1:27:31] intent, he knows what's in your heart.
[1:27:33] He knows whether it's for yourself. He
[1:27:35] knows whether it's for yourself or for
[1:27:37] the kingdom of God.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people and they got great
[1:27:41] plans and all the rest of it. Oh, the
[1:27:42] kingdom of God will be blessed. I don't
[1:27:44] see the kingdom of God very blessed. If
[1:27:46] some of some of them get blessed, but
[1:27:48] God knows what you're going to do with
[1:27:50] it. He knows what you're going to do
[1:27:51] with the ministry. He knows what you're
[1:27:52] going to do with the message. He knows
[1:27:54] He knows if that life is is being poured
[1:27:56] out for for the kingdom of God. And
[1:27:58] though we don't sit there and mope over
[1:28:00] it so much, it's all gone. Forget it.
[1:28:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; My father still owns a cattle on the
[1:28:07] thousand hills. He'll still provide for
[1:28:10] everything. He'll provide for the work
[1:28:12] of God. He'll provide for God's people.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. He'll provide for the
[1:28:17] ministry. He'll provide to get this
[1:28:19] message out. Do you believe that?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; I don't only believe it. I'm I I'm not
[1:28:23] ashamed to say here, I practice it.
[1:28:27] I believe in it.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; I believe this gospel. If this gospel
[1:28:31] didn't work, I'd go somewhere else.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's just how much I believe it. I
[1:28:35] believe it with everything that's in me.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; And believe in practicing what I'm
[1:28:38] preaching to you today. If I didn't
[1:28:40] practice it, I wouldn't preach it.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, everyone that
[1:28:49] experiences suffering, everyone
[1:28:51] experiences one kind or another.
[1:28:55] Can I still take a little bit of time?
[1:28:57] Just a little bit.
[1:29:01] We all have misfortune, calamities, I
[1:29:03] said a moment ago.
[1:29:06] But Paul, Peter says further in this
[1:29:08] scripture when we said whom resist
[1:29:11] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1:29:13] same affliction the same affliction are
[1:29:16] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:29:18] in the world. But then he goes on to say
[1:29:20] in verse 10 and 11, but the God of all
[1:29:23] grace who hath called us unto his
[1:29:26] eternal glory by Christ Jesus after we
[1:29:29] have suffered a while make you perfect,
[1:29:32] establish, strengthen, settle you. To
[1:29:36] him be glory and dominion forever and
[1:29:39] ever. And Peter says, "Amen." And I say,
[1:29:42] "Amen." And we say, "Amen."
[1:29:46] your adversary, the devil.
[1:29:49] He's a master of deception.
[1:29:54] Absolute master at deception.
[1:29:57] He's the one, remember,
[1:29:59] he's the one that swed the tears. Now,
[1:30:02] Jesus gave the parable, but Jesus
[1:30:04] didn't, you know, Jesus didn't make the
[1:30:08] program up. He said the swer went forth
[1:30:11] to sew. Brother Brandham had a vision
[1:30:14] almost identical.
[1:30:16] Seer went forth sewing because he knew
[1:30:19] he was sowing and he knew what would
[1:30:21] come behind. But Jesus gave the parable
[1:30:24] and he sowed good seed in his field and
[1:30:28] while men slept,
[1:30:31] his enemy, notice now it's enemy. He
[1:30:35] came and he sowed tears in the field.
[1:30:41] The tears didn't appear to be
[1:30:45] different.
[1:30:47] They all were like grass coming up in
[1:30:50] the field. But in the harvest time,
[1:30:54] the tears looked exactly like the wheat.
[1:30:58] And brother Brandham speaks about it
[1:31:00] over and over and over again because we
[1:31:03] are in that season.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; We are in the season when all kinds of
[1:31:09] people are born again. They all use the
[1:31:12] same the same language, the same jargon,
[1:31:15] the same philosophy, if you would, the
[1:31:17] same spiritual language that we use. The
[1:31:20] whole world uses it.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible you hold in your hand is held
[1:31:24] in millions of churches today. And they
[1:31:26] love it like you love it. And they read
[1:31:29] it fervently and they read it in the
[1:31:30] morning. And they have Bible Bible
[1:31:33] altar, they have family altar, they have
[1:31:35] all kinds of things. And people are are
[1:31:37] not they're not struck by your language
[1:31:40] or what you use. Now we have in the
[1:31:43] message we have special terminology.
[1:31:45] It's a it's a different it's unknown
[1:31:47] tongues to them.
[1:31:49] That's why I say the message is so
[1:31:52] critically important. It is our it is
[1:31:55] our weapon.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It is our protection in this hour.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And you have to know why you live the
[1:32:02] way you live. Why you dress the way you
[1:32:04] dress. why you speak the way that you
[1:32:07] speak, why you worship the way that you
[1:32:09] worship. You have to know why you do
[1:32:12] these things.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Not just that you do them, but why you
[1:32:15] do them.
[1:32:20] So it was Satan, the enemy that swed the
[1:32:24] tears. And he knew what he was sewing
[1:32:27] because he knew that in the end time his
[1:32:30] master weapon
[1:32:33] is deception.
[1:32:42] in Satan's Eden.
[1:32:44] Just bear with me now for a few more
[1:32:46] minutes. I'd love to have just preached,
[1:32:49] you know, but I I feel that I need to go
[1:32:52] down step by step. In Satan's Eden,
[1:32:56] Brother Brandham said, "The
[1:32:57] deceitfulness of the church of today,
[1:33:01] the son of predition, the devil." He
[1:33:04] said, ' Then people worshiping Satan in
[1:33:06] this day thinking that they're
[1:33:08] worshiping God, don't tell me that's not
[1:33:11] a master stroke of deception
[1:33:15] where he has engineered things to he
[1:33:18] finally and has a whole company called
[1:33:22] the Christian community that are
[1:33:25] actually fighting on his behalf,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; fighting for doctrines which he
[1:33:32] initiated.
[1:33:35] doctrines which he swed the seeds for.
[1:33:44] Just hang on to your seats. I have a few
[1:33:46] things to say.
[1:33:48] The people worshiping Satan in this day
[1:33:51] thinking that they're worshiping God.
[1:33:57] You know that's a hard statement to
[1:33:59] make.
[1:34:00] You meet nice people,
[1:34:04] good people,
[1:34:06] church people.
[1:34:10] They flatly refuse
[1:34:12] the Jesus Christ that you love.
[1:34:16] They would not be baptized in his name
[1:34:18] for nothing.
[1:34:20] But it would take a great deal of
[1:34:22] courage on our part to say, "You are
[1:34:24] worshiping Satan
[1:34:28] in your church."
[1:34:30] And in your religion,
[1:34:34] they would call you all kinds of names
[1:34:36] very quickly.
[1:34:40] And the word would go around in the
[1:34:42] community that you are indeed
[1:34:47] a wackle,
[1:34:50] a spiritual,
[1:34:54] some kind of a religious fanatic.
[1:35:00] I know it's quiet
[1:35:03] and brother Brandham says clearly
[1:35:05] not against the people
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; but against the system and the people
[1:35:12] become subservient to the system. Well,
[1:35:15] the church says and the preacher says
[1:35:19] but there's no deliverance in it
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; because the very author of bondage
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; is at the head of it.
[1:35:30] This last week,
[1:35:33] the new pope, Pope Benedict, and many of
[1:35:36] you know about this, but the new pope
[1:35:39] issued, now just watch it because
[1:35:41] probably you don't see it just exactly
[1:35:43] as I see it. The new pope issued
[1:35:48] actually not a new statement, but it's a
[1:35:51] reaffirmation of what he always believed
[1:35:54] because he was head. And listen, God's
[1:35:57] in control of things. He was head of the
[1:36:00] doctrinal,
[1:36:02] the doctrine of the church. He was a he
[1:36:05] he was a chief cardinal back in the in
[1:36:09] the brethren of the church that handled
[1:36:12] the doctrine of the church. He always
[1:36:15] believed this statement that he just
[1:36:17] made and was a it's a papal declaration.
[1:36:20] And this declaration is that Protestant
[1:36:23] churches are not churches as such. And
[1:36:28] if you read his actual statement and
[1:36:31] what he actually said, he emphasized
[1:36:34] that two or three different ways that
[1:36:37] they are communities.
[1:36:39] They are communities of people. They're
[1:36:42] communities, but they are not churches.
[1:36:45] And he pins it right down to their
[1:36:47] foundation doctrine. And that is and he
[1:36:51] said only the Catholic Church has the
[1:36:54] access and the power of salvation
[1:36:58] because it's the only church that can
[1:37:00] trace itself back to the apostolic
[1:37:03] succession. And the apostolic succession
[1:37:06] is one of the doctrines that your
[1:37:08] prophet took the axe to the tree and cut
[1:37:13] that root for you. you and I
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; and we know that it that apostolic
[1:37:18] succession is of the devil.
[1:37:24] Now listen friends,
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; two days later or three days later, this
[1:37:29] is day before yesterday,
[1:37:32] the bishop or cardinal of Los Angeles
[1:37:36] had to get up and make an public
[1:37:38] announcement because they've had 500
[1:37:43] a class action of 500 sexually abused
[1:37:47] people abused by the priests of their
[1:37:51] church. and they settled it day before
[1:37:54] yesterday for $600 million.
[1:37:58] Now, here's a church that the head has
[1:38:01] just declared where the only church that
[1:38:04] has salvation
[1:38:06] and you others are not churches. You're
[1:38:09] just gatherings or communities of
[1:38:10] people. And then they gave a long list.
[1:38:13] It's in the it's in the newspaper. You
[1:38:16] can get it if you wish on MSNBC on the
[1:38:19] on the computer. And they gave a list of
[1:38:22] all the all the costs of the millions of
[1:38:26] dollars. 85 million maybe in Brooklyn
[1:38:28] and 46 million for 84 people over here
[1:38:32] and another tens of millions over there
[1:38:35] and 160 million. I was going to add them
[1:38:38] all up. I I that was just one thing I
[1:38:40] forgot to do or didn't have time to do
[1:38:42] for you today. Add up the number of
[1:38:45] sexually abused people and you can
[1:38:48] believe that's just a fraction. That's a
[1:38:51] fraction. This is North America only. In
[1:38:54] fact, is it's only United States. Now
[1:38:57] multiply that by South America, by
[1:39:00] Central America, by Spain and by
[1:39:03] Portugal and by Africa and all of those
[1:39:06] countries in Europe and Italy and so on.
[1:39:08] Multiply it. It's hundreds of thousands
[1:39:12] of people that have been abused that'll
[1:39:14] never have a court, never be able to
[1:39:16] settle it, and I don't have any interest
[1:39:18] in it whatsoever. It is the center of
[1:39:21] debauchery.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; And that 600 million didn't belong to
[1:39:27] them. Did some person burned a Greece
[1:39:31] candle
[1:39:32] and paid the church a novena and paid
[1:39:35] them to get somebody out of purgatory
[1:39:38] and took up money that people thought
[1:39:40] they're giving to God. Gave it into the
[1:39:43] hands of Satan himself and paid for all
[1:39:46] the illicit sexual acts of their people.
[1:39:50] I say, what a day that we're living in.
[1:39:57] nice people,
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; good people, but have come subservient
[1:40:02] to the devil himself.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; And that is the seat of the Antichrist.
[1:40:07] And we've had a prophet say it and we
[1:40:09] don't just quote it. We need to identify
[1:40:11] it. That's what's happening right in
[1:40:13] front of us.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, my friends, we may think that
[1:40:18] your, you know, uh the things in your
[1:40:21] own life, uh should be consuming all of
[1:40:23] your time. We got an enemy.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; And it's a religious enemy. It's not
[1:40:29] just that church.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; It is this whole religious society that
[1:40:34] puts itself forward. And don't forget,
[1:40:37] Satan is a beautiful being.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; By his beauty, the prophet said, by his
[1:40:44] beauty, he seduced the angels in heaven.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; He must be a striking creature.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; He must be a striking creature. And then
[1:40:54] he allows this civilization, this so
[1:40:57] supposed to be wise civilization to have
[1:41:00] him as some hoofed creature with a a
[1:41:03] tail and a fork in his hand and so
[1:41:07] forth. What nonsense.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; He's a beautiful creature.
[1:41:12] And he's used deception.
[1:41:16] Can I just tell you this?
[1:41:18] I wanted to look up.
[1:41:21] He said, "And how can I overcome?" And
[1:41:23] then I'm going to just give you some
[1:41:25] statements and try to come to a close.
[1:41:27] He said, 'We see this age that we're
[1:41:29] living in. It's one of the grandest ages
[1:41:32] of all ages. This Leodysian church age
[1:41:36] is the grandest of all the church ages
[1:41:39] because it's ending. It's the ending of
[1:41:41] time and the blending of eternity. Oh,
[1:41:45] how I thank God we can say that. It's
[1:41:47] the ending of time and the blending of
[1:41:49] eternity. And then he said, "It's the
[1:41:51] greatest sinful age." It's the greatest
[1:41:54] sinful age. You young people in school,
[1:41:57] don't forget it. It's a sinful age. And
[1:42:00] you're going to see things. You're going
[1:42:02] to see things. And there's going to be a
[1:42:03] little voice down inside. And men and
[1:42:06] women, husbands and wives, and single
[1:42:09] that are here. It's a sinful age. It's
[1:42:12] the most sinful of all time. And it's
[1:42:16] being conducted by Satan who's a master
[1:42:19] of deception.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; And he says there's more sin in this age
[1:42:26] than there ever than there's ever been.
[1:42:29] And the powers of Satan is many times
[1:42:32] harder to fight to fight against than it
[1:42:34] was in any age. This is a great age of
[1:42:39] deception.
[1:42:41] He said, "Christ said so the two spirits
[1:42:44] would be so close to the last days till
[1:42:48] it would deceive the very elect if it
[1:42:50] was possible."
[1:42:52] I just did a little research. I know
[1:42:55] that deception
[1:42:57] is a critical part of any military
[1:43:01] expedition.
[1:43:03] Deception in war is a critical part of
[1:43:08] winning a battle or losing a battle. And
[1:43:11] here are some of the things that are
[1:43:14] from documents.
[1:43:16] Battlefield deception
[1:43:19] are an essential facet of the command.
[1:43:24] Command,
[1:43:26] control, and communications. They call
[1:43:29] that the three C's.
[1:43:32] Command,
[1:43:33] control, and communications.
[1:43:37] how Satan has taken a hold of
[1:43:41] communications to communicate with you
[1:43:44] through every newspaper, every little
[1:43:46] advertisement, every kind of media there
[1:43:49] is. Be it radio or be it television or
[1:43:52] be it uh be it just some announcement of
[1:43:55] some sort. Satan has taken control
[1:43:57] because he wants to control the mind.
[1:44:00] And don't forget, it's deceptive
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; command. because he wants command. He
[1:44:08] wants control
[1:44:10] and control and communications.
[1:44:13] He said they call it counter measures
[1:44:16] strategy.
[1:44:18] Number three, the purpose of battlefield
[1:44:21] deception
[1:44:23] is to mislead
[1:44:25] or confuse the enemy.
[1:44:28] You're his enemy
[1:44:32] and he wants to mislead or confuse
[1:44:36] you.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; He wants to confuse the decision maker
[1:44:40] by distorting,
[1:44:43] concealing or falsifying indicators of
[1:44:47] friendly intentions.
[1:44:50] That was his approach to Eve. And he was
[1:44:53] coming to the first battlefield of the
[1:44:56] mind of Eve. The mind had been selected.
[1:45:00] And so he came with a friendly approach.
[1:45:03] He came like he was with a good
[1:45:06] intention
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; to play on her weakness
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; to he said to show her something greater
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; more light.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You'll be God's.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You're going to get somewhere with this.
[1:45:20] You're more attractive.
[1:45:24] There's better way to worship.
[1:45:27] Something's better. That's why beauty
[1:45:31] wherever it is
[1:45:34] whether it be in the music I think keep
[1:45:37] it so it's very worshipful
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; keep your singing so it's very
[1:45:44] worshipful
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; I don't think we need to go to extra
[1:45:49] measures
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; you know extra measures to put ourselves
[1:45:53] forward
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; we had a striking convention
[1:45:57] it was a high tech convention, but I see
[1:46:01] that we used the world to advance the
[1:46:06] kingdom of God.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; And it's over and we're we're done with
[1:46:10] it. And I just say it's great.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; We introduced the kiosk. A lot of
[1:46:16] people, you know, it just didn't sink
[1:46:18] in. I can tell you it's going to
[1:46:20] revolutionize
[1:46:22] going to revolutionize the distribution
[1:46:24] of the message. It's absolutely
[1:46:26] incredible. We weren't even able to
[1:46:29] scratch the service and I'm not going to
[1:46:30] talk about it. But I can tell you I'll
[1:46:33] tell you this friends, you know, the
[1:46:35] person who who saw it right away
[1:46:41] had all of about 1300 believers there.
[1:46:45] I asked the ministers, "You want to see
[1:46:47] it?" And
[1:46:49] a pastor did.
[1:46:53] The last service I'm walking out
[1:46:58] And the lady who's in charge of the
[1:47:00] whole thing, whose husband is a lay
[1:47:03] minister
[1:47:06] after the first announcement,
[1:47:09] she caught me and we had given her
[1:47:12] recognition and thanked her and everyone
[1:47:14] clapped for her and the man who's in
[1:47:17] charge, but he's under her and she's
[1:47:20] actually she's the one you have to deal
[1:47:23] with for the whole thing there.
[1:47:26] and she caught me in or actually I
[1:47:28] greeted her and she stopped me. She
[1:47:30] said, "That was quite an announcement
[1:47:33] you made." I didn't even she heard
[1:47:36] anything. I said, "Well, yeah." I said,
[1:47:38] "It was." I said, "We weren't even able
[1:47:41] to say very much about it." Oh, she
[1:47:43] said, "I thought it was fantastic."
[1:47:46] And for you that were there, and I'm
[1:47:48] sure most of you were there, I mentioned
[1:47:49] Uganda three times because Uganda has
[1:47:53] four languages, four tribal languages.
[1:47:57] And when you hit the flag of Uganda,
[1:47:59] up comes those four languages in their
[1:48:02] own tongue.
[1:48:04] And she said, I said, and I I didn't
[1:48:06] even know she was a a Christian of any
[1:48:08] kind. I said for a for a educational
[1:48:11] institution like this I said this is
[1:48:13] incredible because it has diverse
[1:48:15] languages.
[1:48:17] The system will bring up things in
[1:48:18] diverse language and you can load
[1:48:20] anything you want on here. You can load
[1:48:22] all your educational material on here
[1:48:24] and so and she said yeah she said not
[1:48:27] only that we have a school in Uganda
[1:48:30] and she picked up on on networking those
[1:48:33] two together with their all of their
[1:48:35] data and their material. So then Sunday
[1:48:38] I'm just leaving and we're some of the
[1:48:41] last ones out. And she's there and I
[1:48:43] just greet her once again, shook her
[1:48:45] hand. I said, "You've been so
[1:48:47] accommodating and you worked well so
[1:48:49] well with us." And she said, "Oh," she
[1:48:50] said, "That's just something." She said,
[1:48:52] "I hope you don't mind. I took my pastor
[1:48:55] back to see the chaos."
[1:48:59] And I said, "Well, we're, you know, kind
[1:49:02] of keeping it under wraps yet." Well,
[1:49:04] she said, "I hope you don't mind." She
[1:49:06] said,
[1:49:08] Can I be a sales rep for you?
[1:49:12] She's dead serious.
[1:49:14] She said, "I think this is incredible."
[1:49:15] She said, "My husband is going, he's a
[1:49:18] lay minister and he's going to Mongolia
[1:49:20] for with the Asia missions." And she
[1:49:23] said, you know, she could see it right
[1:49:24] away. She caught the vision of it right
[1:49:26] away. She saw all as multiple languages
[1:49:28] and how you could network these chaos
[1:49:30] all over the all over the world and
[1:49:31] print out your own material any place
[1:49:34] that they were sitting and especially
[1:49:35] for translators in Siberia, translator
[1:49:38] in Brazil, translators in the
[1:49:40] Philippines, translators in China,
[1:49:41] wherever they are. And soon as you're
[1:49:43] done the book, click and it's loaded
[1:49:46] into every kiosk everywhere in the
[1:49:48] world. Well, she picked up on it right
[1:49:50] away. She thought it was incredible.
[1:49:55] So, you know,
[1:50:00] I thought it was incredible.
[1:50:03] I still do.
[1:50:05] Said the purpose of battlefield
[1:50:08] deception is to mislead or confuse the
[1:50:11] enemy decision maker by distorting or
[1:50:14] concealing or falsifying indicators of
[1:50:16] friendly intentions, capabilities, or
[1:50:19] dispositions. Can I just give you a few
[1:50:21] more? And I'm going to close in five
[1:50:22] minutes.
[1:50:25] the tactics of deceptions.
[1:50:29] Now, you know, we can say, "Well,
[1:50:31] Brother Biscll, these are military."
[1:50:33] Don't forget this is Satan's Eden.
[1:50:36] He's also the author of the same tactic,
[1:50:41] the same system. And as I prayerfully
[1:50:44] thought
[1:50:46] and waited on God for this service this
[1:50:50] morning and I thought of the many many
[1:50:53] many many years of of speaking with you
[1:50:57] and seeing what takes place and
[1:51:00] transpires in our lives. I want to say
[1:51:02] to you friends, you want to hear this
[1:51:04] real good because Satan uses exactly the
[1:51:08] same system within our homes, within our
[1:51:11] own minds. He tries to appeal to make to
[1:51:15] make us believe that something is
[1:51:17] necessary.
[1:51:19] And when you really look at it and say,
[1:51:20] "Is this necessary?"
[1:51:23] Say, "Well, no, it's not absolutely
[1:51:25] necessary."
[1:51:31] The tactics of deception are to number
[1:51:34] one mask or increase
[1:51:38] in a redeployment of forces
[1:51:42] or weapons
[1:51:44] systems which the enemy has spotted.
[1:51:49] Number two, to block the enemy's
[1:51:51] perception
[1:51:53] andor identification of new weapons and
[1:51:55] forces being introduced into combat.
[1:52:01] Now I can I can give you I'll give you
[1:52:03] some of my interpretation this as I go
[1:52:05] along.
[1:52:08] Paul said this is coming from left
[1:52:11] field.
[1:52:12] Paul said
[1:52:14] am I become an enemy
[1:52:18] to you because I spoke the truth?
[1:52:24] people came into such a mindset
[1:52:28] that when the apostle Paul spoke the
[1:52:31] word of God to them they said that's
[1:52:34] dangerous
[1:52:36] this is a and apostle Paul said to them
[1:52:40] clearly he himself can you imagine the
[1:52:43] great apostle becoming an enemy of the
[1:52:47] people because he was not saying to them
[1:52:50] what they intended or what they expected
[1:52:52] or what whatever David they said it's
[1:52:54] not relative whatever what is Apostle
[1:52:57] Paul saying to us and he says I tell you
[1:52:59] the truth and am I and he's asking the
[1:53:01] question am I become your enemy because
[1:53:03] I tell you the truth and I thought oh
[1:53:05] god
[1:53:08] sometimes even the truth
[1:53:12] can seem like it's threatening
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; this is threatening me this is going to
[1:53:17] change my whole lifestyle this is going
[1:53:19] to change the way I've been living
[1:53:22] a threat Sometimes the truth set you
[1:53:24] free
[1:53:34] to reinforce the enemy's preconceived
[1:53:38] beliefs
[1:53:40] to distract the enemy's attention from
[1:53:43] other activities.
[1:53:47] This is a tactic of deception to
[1:53:49] distract the enemy from other
[1:53:52] activities.
[1:53:54] If he sees that you come from, I'll put
[1:53:57] it in our language. He sees that you've
[1:53:59] come energized
[1:54:02] and you've heard the word and faith has
[1:54:06] dropped into your heart.
[1:54:09] He right away, believe me, he right away
[1:54:11] is saying that person could be dangerous
[1:54:14] now. And I've got to use some deception.
[1:54:18] I've got to attract them. I've got to
[1:54:21] distract them. I've got to get their
[1:54:24] focus uh on something else so they will
[1:54:27] not pursue this direction that's going
[1:54:29] to be damaging to my kingdom.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely the truth.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely the truth.
[1:54:52] And here's two I want you to think
[1:54:54] about.
[1:54:57] Deception
[1:54:58] to create the illusion of strength where
[1:55:02] weakness exists.
[1:55:09] I know that Satan has been incredibly
[1:55:12] successful,
[1:55:16] but I have a message
[1:55:18] that has the that has a counter measure,
[1:55:21] the counterattack
[1:55:24] that has said he is a bluff.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's difficult. It's
[1:55:30] difficult for us to make that kind of a
[1:55:32] declaration sometime when you're facing
[1:55:34] looks like defeat is right in your face.
[1:55:37] Looks like you in the hottest battle
[1:55:39] you've ever been. But you need to be
[1:55:41] able to say according to the word. That
[1:55:43] is living by the word. I'm going to
[1:55:46] live. I'm going to act. I'm going to
[1:55:50] move. I'm going to conduct myself
[1:55:52] according to that word. Which tells me
[1:55:55] he is a bluff.
[1:56:03] Hallelujah.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You have to know, friends, you're
[1:56:09] talking to or an old soldier is talking
[1:56:12] to you now. And we've had to say,
[1:56:15] "You're a bluff. You're a liar.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; You're a liar from the pit. You're a
[1:56:20] murderer from the beginning. And I don't
[1:56:22] care if it looks like absolute defeat.
[1:56:24] I'm still going to say what I have been
[1:56:26] told to say. And I'm living like it. I'm
[1:56:28] living by it. I'm going to go opposite
[1:56:31] to what you're telling me. I'm going in
[1:56:32] the opposite direction because you are a
[1:56:35] liar. You are. My Lord Jesus said,
[1:56:37] "You're a liar from the very beginning.
[1:56:39] You're a liar." And in in face of all of
[1:56:42] this, it looks like absolute defeat, but
[1:56:44] you keep saying it. You keep living by
[1:56:47] the word.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't care what it is
[1:56:50] you're struggling with this morning.
[1:56:51] Friends, you got to identify that enemy.
[1:56:54] You need to act against him decisively
[1:56:58] and with full force.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Full strength.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Throw all the weapons at him. Throw
[1:57:06] everything at him.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Even though he might say that this has
[1:57:11] been this has been something that's hung
[1:57:13] on me for years. This is something that
[1:57:15] is he's bad beating me down beatating me
[1:57:18] down. Nevertheless, you got to say, "I'm
[1:57:23] living by the word of God." And the word
[1:57:26] of God has declared that you are a
[1:57:28] destroyer. You are a liar. The truth is
[1:57:32] not in you.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; And that is why brother Brandham starts
[1:57:36] off with that scripture Mark 16. And I
[1:57:40] wondered about that till this morning or
[1:57:42] last night later on. He said, "And they
[1:57:46] shall cast out devils."
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; And friends, the prophet used that many
[1:57:54] times because he knew who he was dealing
[1:57:57] with. And many times you and I don't
[1:58:00] because he has he's disguised himself.
[1:58:03] He's moved into our normal, you know,
[1:58:06] our normal circle of friends and
[1:58:08] associations and whatever more.
[1:58:15] Some of you young people that are here
[1:58:22] got to forgive me. And yet don't forgive
[1:58:25] me, but I'm going to say it. Some of you
[1:58:27] have had your hardest battles
[1:58:30] of what you have termed is your friends.
[1:58:36] They are not your friends.
[1:58:39] They are nice people.
[1:58:41] They're acquaintances,
[1:58:43] but they're bodies for demon spirits.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And they operate under their command.
[1:58:51] And they have associated because they're
[1:58:53] nice people. They've associated with you
[1:58:56] and have proven to be your greatest
[1:58:58] enemy.
[1:59:00] They have bound you
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; to their environment to there by what is
[1:59:06] called friendship. And how can a
[1:59:08] friendship take you away from Christ or
[1:59:11] lessen your effectiveness with Christ?
[1:59:14] He can't do it. You got to put a new
[1:59:15] name. I'm sorry. It's not friends, it's
[1:59:17] enemies.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I'll be misunderstood. They're nice
[1:59:21] people. I have wonderful what I call
[1:59:24] friends that are in the world, but I've
[1:59:26] got a very clear-cut boundary. and and I
[1:59:29] and on that boundary when we get
[1:59:31] toe-to-toe on that boundary, I want to
[1:59:33] make sure I'm influencing them and
[1:59:36] they're not influencing me. And this is
[1:59:39] the line. This is the line. I can't go
[1:59:41] across this line. We can maybe go and
[1:59:43] have lunch together as I did well, not
[1:59:46] too long ago. And I said to a total
[1:59:48] stranger, "Do you mind if I pray?" I
[1:59:50] like to say, "Grace over the food." No.
[1:59:52] Fine. Go ahead. Because at times, you
[1:59:54] got to take command of the situation.
[1:59:57] You've got to direct the affairs.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got to be aware that
[2:00:01] Satan can be working through this person
[2:00:04] because they're not born again. They're
[2:00:06] not of the kingdom of God. I wish they
[2:00:08] were.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; I want to try to affect them. But Satan,
[2:00:12] Satan has put himself, he's a master.
[2:00:15] Don't forget it. He's a master at
[2:00:17] deception.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; He controls the things that are that
[2:00:22] that that you as a consumer need to buy
[2:00:25] in the store. He's there. My wife, she
[2:00:29] she used to be in tears, weeping, crying
[2:00:33] before she would go shopping to find a
[2:00:35] garments for our girls. And that was
[2:00:37] years ago
[2:00:39] when they were not nearly as bad as it
[2:00:41] is today. Today, they scarcely have a
[2:00:44] garment. And how the messenger, how your
[2:00:48] prophet warned us many years ago of the
[2:00:51] nakedness. It's a disgrace. I tell you,
[2:00:55] it's a disgrace that this nation and
[2:00:57] this people in this North America I have
[2:01:01] I can't hardly take a minister to a
[2:01:03] restaurant because the young ladies are
[2:01:05] so unclothed. It's a disgrace. And the
[2:01:09] fact that you would like to just take a
[2:01:11] walk and go to a pretty spot and go
[2:01:14] walking along the water and the it's a
[2:01:17] disgrace. And this is not Satan's This
[2:01:19] is not Satan's earth.
[2:01:22] The meek shall inherit the earth.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; This earth belongs to us.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; When I say that, I say they're going to
[2:01:29] have to answer to that.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's a demon. And the prophet said it
[2:01:33] is the devil.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And Satan has come in that beauty.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; You young people with the beauty of
[2:01:45] strength and health and and and and as
[2:01:48] as young ladies especially because He
[2:01:51] also said that Satan would use that body
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; that was intended for motherhood.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; He wants to cast it out before the eyes
[2:02:00] of lustful men
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; and bring you accountable. Bring you
[2:02:04] accountable to answer before God for
[2:02:07] committing adultery.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And he said you may be pure as a lily
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; and so you need to cover your body.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; You need to dress with loose garments.
[2:02:18] this business of dressing in something
[2:02:19] that's nothing more than a sock
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; for your upper body that shows every
[2:02:24] form, every part of your body. That's a
[2:02:28] disgrace.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And frankly, we don't want it in the
[2:02:31] church. Don't want you to influence
[2:02:33] others by it. Get before God and you
[2:02:37] say, "Well, what's my protection?"
[2:02:38] That'll get you into trouble. and you go
[2:02:41] back to the message and it will give you
[2:02:43] a protection of how you ought to live
[2:02:46] and how you ought to dress
[2:02:48] say, "Well, some churches have gone
[2:02:50] beyond
[2:02:52] uh clothesline preaching." This isn't
[2:02:54] clothesline preaching. This just happens
[2:02:56] to be the word.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; It just happens to be the way we ought
[2:02:59] to live.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; If you got a problem with it, just read
[2:03:03] the message and see what that says. To
[2:03:05] me, the message has to be our absolute
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; for this generation.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; And so the enemy I've taken 10 minutes
[2:03:19] now. Sorry.
[2:03:23] He wants to he wants to create the
[2:03:25] illusion
[2:03:27] of strength where weakness.
[2:03:32] Brother Brandham, I just heard him
[2:03:33] yesterday.
[2:03:36] He's caught into a vision
[2:03:40] and he sees a strong man, huge man.
[2:03:45] He's got a big stick
[2:03:47] and a little woman.
[2:03:52] And this man is striking her with the
[2:03:54] stick.
[2:03:56] He thought this is this is impossible.
[2:04:00] And he strikes her again another few
[2:04:02] minutes and strikes her again.
[2:04:05] And he goes up and puts his finger at
[2:04:08] his face and says, "If you do that
[2:04:11] again, you'll have to answer to me."
[2:04:14] Then his his own body begin to just like
[2:04:19] he had muscles huge muscles began to
[2:04:22] strengthen so much. And then he realized
[2:04:25] that the woman was the church.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And this was the doctrine.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; This man was the doctrine with the
[2:04:35] trinity stick. That's right.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; There isn't a person in this place that
[2:04:40] doesn't know, not one person, but a good
[2:04:42] number of people that have been struck
[2:04:45] by that same stick.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; You don't get it. It's your enemy.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; It's your enemy.
[2:04:59] He wants to give the illusion of
[2:05:01] strength where actually weakness exists.
[2:05:04] And then also he wants to give the
[2:05:06] illusion
[2:05:08] of weakness where strength exists.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; And he's played that one on every person
[2:05:14] in this congregation. Tell you, you're
[2:05:17] no good for nothing. You're weak. What
[2:05:19] do you think? You think you're going to
[2:05:20] You think you can overcome this? You
[2:05:22] think you're going to Hello.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; He tries to make out weakness.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; That's his deception. And don't let him
[2:05:32] work it on you.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it anyway?
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Where strength exists,
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; he wants to give the illusion
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; that they're weak. The church is weak.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; I don't major on the weaknesses of the
[2:05:58] church.
[2:06:01] There isn't a church that I know of in
[2:06:03] the world that hasn't got weak spots.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you something else just
[2:06:08] before I close. In the Bible, even when
[2:06:11] God Israel was God's nation,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Israel would go into battle and have a
[2:06:17] horrific defeat.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; They were still God's nation.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; He would not deny them ownership of that
[2:06:23] nation.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Then they went into bondage. They were
[2:06:26] in Babylon 70 years. God never disowned
[2:06:29] them even though he allowed it. And he
[2:06:31] even said to the other nations, "Anybody
[2:06:34] that doesn't let Nebuchadnezzar control
[2:06:36] him and put his neck put his foot on
[2:06:38] your neck, he said, uh, you're going to
[2:06:41] be under Nebuchadnezzar, he my servant,"
[2:06:43] he said because he declared it. But he
[2:06:45] he does not give the right of other
[2:06:47] people to point their finger at his
[2:06:50] people.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; And even one place in the scriptures, he
[2:06:55] they use the word ah. He said you cannot
[2:06:58] say ah. When God comes against his
[2:07:01] people and corrects them and brings them
[2:07:04] corrective measures and maybe gives them
[2:07:06] defeat and brings hardship and all kinds
[2:07:08] of things, he doesn't give us the
[2:07:10] permission to say, "Ah,
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; ah, look at that. Oh, look at that
[2:07:16] person. Oh, look at this." It's not that
[2:07:19] God's excusing it. He's got his way to
[2:07:21] cleanse his church. He's got his way to
[2:07:23] deal with the people. And that's by the
[2:07:25] Holy Ghost.
[2:07:28] He's got his way to do it.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you just let God do it and
[2:07:32] he'll do his work.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; In the meantime, it's my commission, my
[2:07:37] part to preach the gospel, other
[2:07:39] ministers to preach the word. It was the
[2:07:42] prophet's commission to bring the word
[2:07:43] so we would have it to preach. And we
[2:07:45] preach it out of the scriptures. And I
[2:07:47] can tell you friends, our enemy, I tell
[2:07:50] Satan today, we've got your number.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; We know who you are. Our prophet has
[2:07:56] uncovered you. The word of God has
[2:07:59] declared who you are and what you are
[2:08:01] and that you're a bluff. You're
[2:08:03] defeated.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:08] Glory to God.
[2:08:17] Hallelujah.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I want to sing a song because I just
[2:08:21] feel we need to close.
[2:08:30] Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:08:54] right here in the service this morning.
[2:08:58] You just been letting something linger.
[2:09:02] It's time
[2:09:04] when a word like this has been preached.
[2:09:07] Say, "Thus far and no further.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're not coming home with me.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; I am done.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; I'm done with you." Maybe something in
[2:09:19] the character, something mentally,
[2:09:22] something pounded you over something
[2:09:24] he's bound you with. You want to
[2:09:27] announce to him, I'm going to live by
[2:09:30] every word of God, and you're not going
[2:09:33] home with me. Are you ready to say that?
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; I'm leaving here a free man, a free
[2:09:40] person. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:09:43] declare it.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe God's speaking to you and you want
[2:09:50] to just stand to your feet. I'm going to
[2:09:51] make a declaration. Going to make a
[2:09:53] public declaration. You're not coming
[2:09:55] home with me, Satan.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Look at this people. Hallelujah. You
[2:09:59] mean it. You mean it. Hallelujah.
[2:10:02] Hallelujah. Don't let him use his
[2:10:04] deception. He's not strong. He's weak.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; He's weak.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; He's weak. The believer is strong.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; The believer, He's not bloodwashed. You
[2:10:14] are.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the Holy Ghost. You do.
[2:10:20] Glory to God.
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:22] [Applause]
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; It's something real, friends. It's
[2:10:26] substantial.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:39] I want to sing
[2:10:48] Victory. Victory over all the powers of
[2:10:51] darkness.
[2:10:53] Victory
[2:10:55] just prayerfully.
[2:10:58] Victory. Victory
[2:11:00] over all the powers of darkness.
[2:11:02] Victory.
[2:11:04] [Music]
[2:11:08] Victory.
[2:11:11] Victory.
[2:11:15] over the clouds of darkness. Victory
[2:11:23] battles in a rain angel
[2:11:27] in the
[2:11:30] fight.
[2:11:32] Victory,
[2:11:36] victory,
[2:11:39] victory.
[2:11:43] overest
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:56] and God fights for those who victory.
[2:12:03] I don't want you to fight a passive
[2:12:05] battle.
[2:12:07] That's not why I preach this morning. I
[2:12:10] want you to take the battle to the
[2:12:12] enemy's camp.
[2:12:18] I have so much it'll just come in
[2:12:20] another service.
[2:12:23] But Israel made a very big mistake at
[2:12:24] one time
[2:12:27] and that is that they left an enemy, the
[2:12:30] Canaanites.
[2:12:32] They left them in their country and they
[2:12:35] said, you know,
[2:12:37] we'll take tribute of them.
[2:12:41] We'll make them work for us.
[2:12:44] But it was terrible deception
[2:12:48] because while they were taking tribute
[2:12:50] and they thought we're doing so well
[2:12:52] financially, oh, we got all these
[2:12:55] Canaanites working for us.
[2:12:58] But the young cana Canaanite ladies, the
[2:13:01] young girls,
[2:13:04] they were beautiful.
[2:13:06] [Music]
[2:13:08] And the boys of Israel,
[2:13:10] they just,
[2:13:12] you know, they're our neighbor. Their
[2:13:15] dad works for my dad
[2:13:19] and we'll just intermar.
[2:13:23] And they did. And before long,
[2:13:27] the wife would say, "Well, I've gone to
[2:13:30] your church. Now you come to mine."
[2:13:34] Yeah, I guess that's fair. After all,
[2:13:36] we're in a we're in a marriage
[2:13:38] relationship, so they'll go to their
[2:13:40] church.
[2:13:42] And Israel went into went into idolatry,
[2:13:48] and God had to turn from them.
[2:13:52] In our daily life, in our homes,
[2:13:57] sometimes things come up and say, "Well,
[2:13:59] you know, I can just use this. I I'll
[2:14:02] use this as a as a benefit." You have to
[2:14:05] really watch and make sure it's not a
[2:14:08] Canaanite
[2:14:10] we're using. I'm not talking about
[2:14:11] financial things. I'm talking about, you
[2:14:13] know, a spirit of a thing comes and you
[2:14:15] can sense that and you can feel that.
[2:14:18] So, we're not we're not covering with
[2:14:20] the enemy. I say take the enemy
[2:14:25] in your place of business. I'm I'm so
[2:14:28] thankful for you brothers. I hear
[2:14:30] testimony after testimony where you
[2:14:32] stand and you make your declaration and
[2:14:34] this is what you believe and let every
[2:14:37] let the chips fall where they may
[2:14:39] sisters as well. I say God bless you. I
[2:14:43] felt this service was important today to
[2:14:45] this congregation and I've got a part
[2:14:47] two or part three yet coming. All right.
[2:14:51] Victory,
[2:14:54] victory
[2:14:57] over all of
[2:15:02] [Music]
[2:15:04] the battles.
[2:15:07] Angels
[2:15:10] and God
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:16] 777 in the book and we'll close with
[2:15:18] this song.
[2:15:22] I heard an old old story
[2:15:25] and it's still a new story. Amen.
[2:15:29] Hallelujah. Think you can take this
[2:15:32] home? Put it into practice.
[2:15:35] Amen. I can tell you friends, Satan
[2:15:38] didn't want me to speak this message
[2:15:39] this morning. He just threw all his guns
[2:15:42] at me. I'm going to preach it anyway.
[2:15:45] Going to preach it anyway.
[2:15:48] [Applause]
[2:15:51] You know, he used his power deception
[2:15:54] while I was even writing these things
[2:15:56] down. You know what he said to me? You
[2:15:59] want in on it?
[2:16:02] He said, "Clearly,
[2:16:05] you haven't got a message.
[2:16:08] You don't have a message.
[2:16:10] What are you going to say? You don't
[2:16:12] have a message."
[2:16:15] Say, "What did you do, Brother Ed? I
[2:16:17] just kept my head
[2:16:21] working.
[2:16:23] I said, "If I haven't got a message, I'm
[2:16:25] going to listen to another message. I'm
[2:16:28] going to get in the car. I've got to go
[2:16:30] someplace, but I'm going to be listening
[2:16:32] to Reproach for the Word. When I get
[2:16:34] home, I'm going to study some more. I'm
[2:16:37] going to pray some more. I'm going to
[2:16:39] lay down a rest. I'm going to listen to
[2:16:41] the contest. Just give it to him."
[2:16:43] Hallelujah.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not just excited, friends. This is
[2:16:47] truth.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; And I listened to the contest. Did me so
[2:16:51] much good. Brother says, "I only got
[2:16:54] about 10 or 15 minutes to speak cuz this
[2:16:57] is Christmas Eve and we're going to have
[2:17:00] the Lord's table."
[2:17:03] Tell you friends,
[2:17:06] he said, "I just came down here. Didn't
[2:17:08] feel like I had anything much to say."
[2:17:12] Oh, God. Even he felt that way. The
[2:17:15] devil worked on him. And I'm so glad he
[2:17:17] preached the contest.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; We're in the contest.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; We have victory
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. This is not
[2:17:26] some hype. This is We've got a thus
[2:17:30] sayaith the Lord.
[2:17:32] I hope you people can grasp. I'm sure
[2:17:35] you do. I know you do.
[2:17:37] Who else has a vindicate? Churches all
[2:17:40] over the country. What have they got for
[2:17:43] what have they got to h their faith on
[2:17:46] say well if you just send yours back you
[2:17:49] don't have to go back very far you say
[2:17:55] we we actually have all kinds of people
[2:17:57] have pro we have a prophet
[2:18:00] that means so much to me that stood and
[2:18:02] declared it oh my hallelujah
[2:18:08] I haven't told you the truth and he
[2:18:10] won't vindicate
[2:18:11] If I told you the truth over and over
[2:18:15] and he come every time, tell me, was
[2:18:18] there ever a time that that Lord Jesus
[2:18:21] by the Holy Spirit, by the pillar of
[2:18:23] fire didn't come? Was there even once?
[2:18:25] Never once.
[2:18:29] [Music]
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; I can rejoice over that. Never once, my
[2:18:33] God came every time and stood behind his
[2:18:37] word for this hour.
[2:18:41] All right. God bless you. I heard an old
[2:18:45] story. Our savior came from glory. how
[2:18:51] he gave his life on
[2:18:55] a rich
[2:19:02] blood
[2:19:05] and I
[2:19:08] sleus
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:16] myior
[2:19:18] forever.
[2:19:20] He sought me and he meal
[2:19:27] [Music]
[2:19:31] and all my love to him. He meant
[2:19:37] [Music]
[2:19:40] blood.
[2:19:42] I heard about his healing on his hand
[2:19:49] [Music]
[2:19:54] to see
[2:19:58] [Music]
[2:20:00] him
[2:20:01] [Music]
[2:20:03] and somehow Jesus came and me victory.
[2:20:10] Oh,
[2:20:13] Jesus my savior forever.
[2:20:18] He sought me and
[2:20:22] his
[2:20:23] blood.
[2:20:25] He loved me and I knew
[2:20:30] to him.
[2:20:34] [Music]
[2:20:39] I heard about the man
[2:20:43] for me in glory.
[2:20:46] I heard about the sweet
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:54] angels singtory.
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:21:09] Jesus myavior
[2:21:12] forever.
[2:21:14] He sought me.
[2:21:17] [Music]
[2:21:47] I don't know just how we're going to
[2:21:48] sing what song we're going to sing when
[2:21:51] we get over on the other side
[2:21:55] and have brother Gary St. John come up
[2:21:57] and pray a prayer at the close of this
[2:22:00] service. Now,
[2:22:04] Brother Brandham says he's going to give
[2:22:05] a crown of life.
[2:22:08] I'm looking down in the faces of people.
[2:22:11] I believe in my heart of hearts.
[2:22:14] Be a crown of life for you. A crown of
[2:22:17] life. It's going to crown
[2:22:20] your life
[2:22:22] with eternal life. You have it now, but
[2:22:25] you'll come into the full realization of
[2:22:28] it. He'll crown you with eternal life.
[2:22:32] Some people get the crown because
[2:22:33] they've had to give their life.
[2:22:37] They gave their life. They were martyed
[2:22:41] and we admire them.
[2:22:44] And we are called on to give our life by
[2:22:47] he said some will give by giving and
[2:22:49] some will give it by striving.
[2:22:52] and you're you're called to strive every
[2:22:54] day.
[2:22:58] We're in a contest every day.
[2:23:01] But then
[2:23:03] and and and and friends, I think that
[2:23:08] this will mean something to you because
[2:23:10] I've tried in this service when I was
[2:23:13] studying throughout this week. Actually,
[2:23:15] it's been a couple weeks.
[2:23:21] What does God actually expect? How will
[2:23:23] I
[2:23:27] how will it be when we cross over?
[2:23:31] And so I look to see and brother
[2:23:33] Brandham talks about this
[2:23:36] great Roman emperor
[2:23:38] and he's having the troops march by.
[2:23:45] And there comes a little fellow.
[2:23:47] He's kind of all crumpled up and he's
[2:23:50] all scarred
[2:23:52] and he calls him out, identifies them,
[2:23:54] say, "Come here."
[2:23:56] Walks up, says, "Where'd you get those
[2:23:58] scars?"
[2:23:59] Said, "Fighting for my emperor."
[2:24:04] He said, "Get in my chariot.
[2:24:07] You're too good to be there. Get in my
[2:24:09] chariot."
[2:24:11] And then, Brother Brandham says this,
[2:24:13] and I'm going to leave it with you.
[2:24:22] We're on a battlefield now.
[2:24:27] We're on the battlefield now. When you
[2:24:29] go out these doors, say, "Well, I was
[2:24:30] just at church this morning." Well, your
[2:24:32] pastor told you you're on the
[2:24:33] battlefield.
[2:24:40] He said, "We've got to hurry away, but I
[2:24:43] just imagine what it'll be when I look
[2:24:46] across the table and see all the
[2:24:49] redeemed sitting there."
[2:24:54] He said he's going to be gathered with
[2:24:55] his people.
[2:24:58] And at that table,
[2:25:01] he describes the scene and what happens.
[2:25:04] and we'll reach across and get a hold of
[2:25:07] one another's hand.
[2:25:12] We start crying.
[2:25:17] He said, "We've got to."
[2:25:20] Then the king will come out and wipe all
[2:25:23] the tears from our eyes and he'll say,
[2:25:27] "Don't cry, children. It's all over."
[2:25:31] That's why we're here this morning.
[2:25:34] That's and I were in church. Don't cry,
[2:25:36] children. It's all over.
[2:25:40] Enter into the joys of the Lord that's
[2:25:42] been prepared to you since the
[2:25:44] foundation of the world. Our little
[2:25:46] differences will fade away then, and
[2:25:49] there'll be one great eternity that I
[2:25:52] want to spend it with you. Amen.
[2:25:56] Brother Gary, would you come, please?
[2:26:16] How many enjoy that?
[2:26:19] Let's just pray.
[2:26:23] Father, Lord,
[2:26:25] this takes my mind back, Lord. Even
[2:26:27] being in the military myself, Lord.
[2:26:31] Lord, I always heard Lord we weren't
[2:26:33] training for peace time. Lord, we were
[2:26:34] training for battle. Lord, training for
[2:26:37] war, Lord is to always keep us ready,
[2:26:40] Father. Lord, and have this this sermon
[2:26:42] this morning, Lord, just bless my heart,
[2:26:45] Lord. Lord, just make that enemy more
[2:26:48] real to me, Lord, this morning, Lord, as
[2:26:51] we leave these doors, Father. Lord, let
[2:26:53] us know, Lord, that he's ever present,
[2:26:56] Lord. We get so relaxed, Lord, some of
[2:26:58] these days, Lord. We just pray Lord that
[2:27:00] you would Lord just reveal him before us
[2:27:03] Father Lord and each and every little
[2:27:04] thing Lord it's not the big things
[2:27:06] sometimes Lord that get in our way and
[2:27:08] Lord get us down Lord but Lord just
[2:27:11] simple things Father Lord just where we
[2:27:14] may congregate Lord where we may find
[2:27:16] ourselves days Lord Jesus we just ask
[2:27:19] Lord you'd just lead our footsteps Lord
[2:27:22] lead our blessings Lord lead our lives
[2:27:24] Lord before you Lord Jesus Lord help us
[2:27:27] to rise early Lord in the morning and
[2:27:29] meet you each and every day. Father,
[2:27:31] Lord, help us, Lord, where we may feel
[2:27:34] bound. Lord, help us, Lord, where we may
[2:27:36] feel like defeat, defeated, Lord Jesus.
[2:27:38] Help us, Lord, where we could, Lord,
[2:27:41] just just just
[2:27:43] convinced, Lord, be convinced, Lord
[2:27:45] Jesus, where that bread sits on the
[2:27:47] table, Lord, to be consumed with it,
[2:27:49] Lord Jesus. Lord, to be fed by it, Lord.
[2:27:52] Lord, to be strengthened with it, Lord
[2:27:53] Jesus. Lord, each and every day, Lord
[2:27:56] Jesus. Lord, raise up, Lord. Just
[2:27:58] believing, Lord, that you've got our
[2:28:00] portion for us daily, Lord. We're not
[2:28:02] living off yesterday, Lord Jesus. But
[2:28:05] not even the convention, Lord, and all
[2:28:06] that it brought, Lord. And how fantastic
[2:28:09] it was, Lord, but Lord, tomorrow, Lord,
[2:28:11] and this afternoon, Lord, and how we may
[2:28:13] be a blessing, Lord, and not for be to
[2:28:16] be blessed, Lord, but be a blessing,
[2:28:17] Father, Lord, to be a giver and not a
[2:28:20] taker, Lord Jesus. Lord, that we could
[2:28:22] just be a blessing, Lord, in some way,
[2:28:24] Lord. Not the great things as the pastor
[2:28:26] said, Lord, but Lord, just how we may be
[2:28:29] a blessing, Lord Jesus. Even in a little
[2:28:31] thing, Lord, even as we were talking,
[2:28:33] Lord, just being a little flunky
[2:28:34] footwasher, Lord Jesus, as in your day,
[2:28:37] Lord Jesus, whatever it may be, as
[2:28:39] humble as it may be, Father, Lord, it's
[2:28:41] all got its position, Lord, in your
[2:28:43] kingdom, Lord Jesus. Lord, help us,
[2:28:45] Lord. Lord, just reveal your great
[2:28:47] things to us, Lord, even as we leave
[2:28:49] here, Father. Bless our pastor, Lord, as
[2:28:52] we he sat, Lord, even thinking he didn't
[2:28:54] have a message for us, Lord. Oh, God.
[2:28:55] What a blessing, Lord. It was, Lord, how
[2:28:58] your prophet was a blessing to us, Lord.
[2:29:00] And just daily, Lord, just a blessing to
[2:29:02] us. Every if we would just sit and not
[2:29:05] have this word revealed to us, Lord,
[2:29:07] we'd be no different than the lost out
[2:29:09] there, Lord Jesus. What a blessing it
[2:29:11] is, Father. Oh, God. We're so grateful
[2:29:14] for it, Lord Jesus. Oh, God. We just
[2:29:16] don't give our thanks enough, Lord
[2:29:18] Jesus. I would be lost, Lord, without
[2:29:21] you, Lord Jesus. Without this word,
[2:29:23] without your servants, Lord Jesus. We're
[2:29:25] so grateful for them, Lord. Lord, we
[2:29:28] ask, Lord, you'd bless the rest of this
[2:29:30] day. That's your people, Lord. Bless
[2:29:32] your ministry, Lord,
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; for having them all in place, Lord. What
[2:29:35] a blessing that was for brother Gerwall
[2:29:38] to see the church in its place, Lord
[2:29:40] Jesus. Everybody lined up, Lord. Lord,
[2:29:43] we know your time's soon at hand, Lord.
[2:29:46] We want to be ready, Lord. We don't want
[2:29:47] one to miss it, Father.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, just bless your word to us now,
[2:29:51] Lord. Let us think on it as the day goes
[2:29:53] on, Lord.
[2:29:54] &gt;&gt; We ask it all in our precious Jesus
[2:29:57] name.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Gary.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; And I say God bless you. And when you go
[2:30:04] from this place, if you would please
[2:30:06] just remember this service and remember
[2:30:09] when I'm able to approach it again. This
[2:30:12] next Sunday, we're going to be
[2:30:14] dedicating
[2:30:15] brother Roy Shrewsbury's church that had
[2:30:17] burned to the ground. And you know, it's
[2:30:20] just I can't explain how God works. This
[2:30:22] morning, this morning, God gave me a
[2:30:25] message and I wrote the notes for that
[2:30:28] service. I don't know how it happens.
[2:30:30] Just dropped it in before I even got out
[2:30:33] of bed. And I've been wrestling with it
[2:30:35] for a couple weeks knowing it was coming
[2:30:37] up. You know, God just drops it in by
[2:30:40] divine inspiration. I came out and told
[2:30:42] my wife I got the message for the
[2:30:44] dedication. Hallelujah. Be praying for
[2:30:47] the meeting if you would please. And
[2:30:50] remember when you go out from here I
[2:30:52] want you to when you shake hands and I
[2:30:55] want you to keep in your mind
[2:30:58] as a soldier in the army of the Lord.
[2:31:02] Camaraderie is a big thing. You want to
[2:31:05] encourage one another.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Encourage one another. Amen. and
[2:31:09] strengthen one another. Glory to God.
[2:31:12] Tell them there's absolute victory. I
[2:31:14] guarantee you you're going to shake
[2:31:16] hands with one another today. It's only
[2:31:19] a prelude to reaching across the table
[2:31:21] and doing it there. You're dismissed in
[2:31:24] Jesus Christ's name. God bless you.
[2:31:27] Amen.
[2:31:35] Now, Brother Tom, there it is.
