[2:49] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wonderful
[2:51] to be gathered together again. We're
[2:53] going to start the service number 11:28.
[2:55] In Christ alone, I've had this song on
[2:58] my heart as powerful lyrics. Amen. So,
[3:01] why don't we stand as we sing in Christ
[3:03] alone my hope is found. He is my light,
[3:06] my strength, and my song. Amen.
[3:09] Hallelujah.
[3:10] Oh, in Christ alone,
[3:14] my hope is found.
[3:17] He is my light, my strength, my song.
[3:23] This cornerstone,
[3:26] this solid ground
[3:29] burn through the fiercest proud
[3:32] and stone.
[3:34] What heights of love,
[3:37] what depths of
[3:40] when fears are still, when thriving
[3:45] cease. I conquer
[3:49] my all in all.
[3:52] Oh, here in the right I stand
[3:58] [Music]
[4:01] Christ alone
[4:03] who took on flesh
[4:06] all in helpless.
[4:12] is love
[4:14] and righteousness
[4:18] for my he
[4:21] to save
[4:23] till on that cross
[4:25] that Jesus died. The wrath of God was
[4:32] satisfied
[4:33] [Applause]
[4:34] for every sin. On him was laid. And here
[4:40] in the death of Christ I live.
[4:47] Oh, there in the ground
[4:51] his body laid.
[4:54] Light of the world by darkness day. Then
[4:59] bursting forth in glorious day. Oh grave
[5:06] he rose again.
[5:10] as he stands in victory.
[5:15] Since curse has lost his bread on me,
[5:21] for I am his and he is mine,
[5:27] born with the precious blood of Christ.
[5:34] Oh, no guilt in life, no fear in death.
[5:40] For this is the power of Christ in me
[5:46] from life
[5:49] to my breath.
[5:52] Jesus command my destiny.
[5:57] God
[6:02] can never
[6:05] be from his
[6:08] till he returns
[6:10] or call me home
[6:13] here in the power of Christ. I'll stand.
[6:18] Let's sing that last verse once again.
[6:20] Oh no guilt in life
[6:24] here and death.
[6:27] This is the power of Christ in me from
[6:33] life birth.
[6:37] Oh yes, Jesus commands my destiny
[6:43] and no power.
[6:46] No king of man can ever
[6:51] be from his hand till he returns
[6:58] home
[7:00] here in the power. No power.
[7:05] No power of hell. No king of man can
[7:11] ever
[7:13] be from his hand till he returns
[7:19] or calls me home. Oh here in the power
[7:24] of Christ
[7:26] I'll stand.
[7:29] Hallelujah.
[7:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[7:35] I stand in awe within the presence of
[7:41] the Lord.
[7:43] Know in whom the wisdom of the ages
[7:49] lies
[7:52] and for whom the raing of the sea
[7:57] of
[8:00] the living sacrifice
[8:03] [Applause]
[8:05] the only horse
[8:08] of life
[8:10] I
[8:13] is it?
[8:16] Yes. From the time I
[8:20] [Applause]
[8:24] [Music]
[8:31] [Music]
[8:38] second verse.
[8:40] Oh, his tender mercies come with that
[8:44] ever rising
[8:46] sun.

[9:43] know his tender mercies come with every
[9:48] rising
[9:50] sun
[9:52] to meet the sinner
[9:55] in his brokenness.
[10:00] offer healing and he
[10:06] [Music]

[10:19] it is Yeah.
[10:22] [Music]
[10:24] Heat.
[10:37] Oh,

[10:41] more.
[10:47] Yes, my home
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] is in
[10:54] from this time on
[11:03] my
[11:06] it is in the Lord
[11:10] forever
[11:12] more.
[11:14] [Music]
[11:15] Why don't you thank him, my brother, my
[11:16] sister? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[11:19] Hallelujah. Lord,
[11:22] blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; You're our hope, oh God. You're the God
[11:28] of our salvation, of our deliverance.
[11:31] You're our healer, Lord, our peace, our
[11:34] provider.
[11:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[11:40] Our hope for whatever our need might be.
[11:43] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[11:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[11:50] Oh, give him thanks. Give him thanks.
[11:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's
[11:57] so worthy.
[11:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[12:02] Glory to your name, oh God. Hallelu,
[12:07] hallelujah, hallelujah.
[12:11] Blessed be the name of our Lord.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to open in a word of prayer.
[12:18] I'm going to ask our brother Peta
[12:19] Raokero if you would come and open the
[12:21] service. We have some testimonies. One
[12:24] from our sister Elizabeth. She was
[12:26] diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis over
[12:28] 15 years ago. Pain and swelling got so
[12:30] bad at times that she could not raise
[12:31] her arms or walk. They said there is no
[12:33] cure. The medicine made her sick. The
[12:37] scriptures say, "A merry heart does good
[12:39] like medicine." Well, recently the
[12:41] preaching of the word has more than
[12:42] touched her heart and soul. And she
[12:43] says, "I have had no pain for months. I
[12:46] believe and give God all the glory."
[12:48] Amen. God bless Elizabeth. Rejoice with
[12:50] you.
[12:52] Amen. Amen.
[12:54] Hallelujah. Testimony from our brother
[12:57] Al King. Recently, we prayed for a
[12:58] couple expecting a baby. There were some
[13:00] medical concerns. The baby has arrived
[13:02] and is doing well. Thank you for your
[13:03] prayers. And also from the Reika Drokas,
[13:06] we would like to thank the Lord for his
[13:07] hand of protection. Yesterday, Samuel
[13:09] had his right hand caught in a locked
[13:11] trunk. When it was released, there was
[13:13] barely a scratch on the skin. Amen.
[13:15] Praise the Lord. Amen. Just as our
[13:17] brother Peta comes, we have two prayer
[13:19] requests. One from the Esther Heisen
[13:21] family. Please remember sister Marie in
[13:23] South Africa who has stage four tumors
[13:26] in her brain and her lungs. Just asking
[13:28] we would hold sister Marie up in prayer
[13:29] in this time. Amen. And and also can we
[13:32] please pray for total restoration of my
[13:35] two oldest children, Michael and Jillian
[13:37] and Ken. It's from the Moscu family that
[13:41] God would convict them and bring them in
[13:42] the fold is their prayer. Amen. Many of
[13:44] us have loved ones that are on our
[13:46] hearts. So we bind our hearts together
[13:48] with the Moscu family with this prayer
[13:50] request. Brother Peter, why don't you
[13:51] come? If there's a need on your heart,
[13:53] be known with an uplifted hand. God
[13:55] bless you.
[13:57] [Music]
[14:00] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Our most
[14:02] kind gracious heavenly father, it's a
[14:04] privilege once again to be here in your
[14:06] house. We want to come Lord to praise
[14:08] you and magnify their name. We lift your
[14:11] name on high this morning Lord in the
[14:14] world Lord. They are they elevate the
[14:17] sports star Lord but you are more
[14:18] important to us this morning. We bless
[14:21] your mighty name this morning Lord. We
[14:23] glorify thy holy name Lord this morning.
[14:26] Thank you once again, Father, for your
[14:28] presence this morning, Lord. Thank you
[14:30] for brother Ryan, Lord, the atmosphere.
[14:32] Lord, we welcome you this morning. We
[14:34] pray, Father, that you'll come down this
[14:36] morning and speak to us in a very
[14:38] special way, Lord. Speak to the
[14:40] children, speak to the young people and
[14:42] likewise, Lord. Lord, we are expecting
[14:45] great things from you this morning,
[14:47] Lord. We heard about the prayer request
[14:50] this morning. I might just not uh
[14:52] remember it right now, Lord. Just pray
[14:54] that you'll go to every individual,
[14:56] Lord, that has a need this morning,
[14:58] Lord. Just pray they'll touch them,
[15:00] Lord, in any way, any capacity, Lord,
[15:03] that you'll speak to them and Lord,
[15:05] raise them up for your glory and honor.
[15:07] Thank you for the testimony, Lord, of
[15:09] the believers this morning, Lord. Thank
[15:11] you for touching Samuel, Lord, that you
[15:14] uh keep his hand intact, Lord Jesus. We
[15:16] just want to thank you once again, Lord,
[15:18] for uh every single one they here, they
[15:20] come, Lord. They didn't come just for
[15:22] church. We come here expecting that
[15:25] you'll do the most uh exceedingly
[15:27] abundantly for us Lord. Pray for the
[15:29] ministers Lord is waiting to speak this
[15:32] morning. Use him mightily, Lord. Hiding
[15:34] behind the cross. Let Jesus Christ Lord
[15:36] speak to us in a very special way Lord.
[15:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah Lord. We bless
[15:42] thy mighty name Lord this morning. Bless
[15:45] the servants Lord. Bless us together
[15:46] Lord now in your presence. We pray and
[15:49] ask all this blessing in the name of
[15:50] Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. Amen.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:58] Amen. Why don't you shake one another's
[16:00] hands and greet one another?
[16:03] Amen. You're welcome to have your seats.
[16:04] Brother Darren's going to come share
[16:06] some good news with us. Brother Darren,
[16:09] why don't you go ahead and make your way
[16:11] and I think you have an announcement
[16:12] regarding the message hub.
[16:16] God bless you.
[16:27] You want to take that to the homepage?
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; Um, this has been in the makings for
[16:35] quite some time.
[16:37] Um, but kind of persevered and took a
[16:40] little longer than we expected, but I
[16:42] think the the wait I hope is is is well
[16:44] worth it. What we've done is we've uh
[16:47] built a new version of the message hub
[16:49] website and the existing message hub
[16:52] website had a um had some uh you can say
[16:55] restrictions to it. So uh we took the
[16:58] time to uh redesign it, add some new
[17:00] functionality to it. And today we just
[17:02] kind of want to give you uh a little bit
[17:03] of an overview of the new functionality
[17:05] so when people go to the MessageHub
[17:06] website they won't get surprised. Oh,
[17:08] it's all changed. How does this all
[17:09] work? So, uh, we thought it would just
[17:12] be a good idea
[17:14] just to take a few moments and show you
[17:16] some of the new features. Um, one of the
[17:18] ones we did, what the one of the big
[17:20] things we did was the redesign. And if
[17:22] you notice an existing message hub
[17:24] website is kind of a fixed width. So,
[17:27] it's can get quite uh kind of crowded.
[17:29] So, what we did here is because computer
[17:31] screens are now quite wide, we thought,
[17:33] well, let's take advantage of a wide
[17:34] screen. So what we've done now is we the
[17:37] website now takes up the full width
[17:41] of the web browser. So if you have a
[17:43] really wide browser, it takes up the
[17:45] whole width and actually allows you to
[17:47] um see the information a little bit
[17:48] easier. Um we've increased the font
[17:51] size. We've made the page pages uh load
[17:53] a lot quicker. Um so on this uh I should
[17:58] go back to the uh the first tab, Aaron.
[18:01] Translated the translated. There you go.
[18:03] translated names. So, as before, when
[18:06] you first come up, you'll see all the
[18:07] translated
[18:09] uh languages that we have available on
[18:11] the hub. This is not the live database.
[18:14] Um, it doesn't have quite all the same
[18:16] information in it. Um, I think we're
[18:18] about up to about 46 or 47 languages
[18:20] now, getting close to 50. Um, so people
[18:23] have the choice of either searching by
[18:25] their own uh the language in their own
[18:27] name of the language in their own
[18:28] language or for for people who don't
[18:31] speak anything else but English. You can
[18:32] go to the English tab. Let's go there,
[18:34] Aaron.
[18:38] And everything is now in the English
[18:39] language. So if you want to print a
[18:41] message book for yourself or you want to
[18:43] print it for somebody you're witnessing
[18:44] to, you can go here and find their
[18:46] language. Well, let's let's go to um
[18:48] English.
[18:50] This is where most of us would print a
[18:52] book for ourselves at least.
[18:54] And on here, what we've done now is
[18:56] we've we've taken the the list of
[18:58] messages and we've kind of broken it
[19:00] down into segments. So along the top
[19:02] here, we have a new toolbar that where
[19:04] we've added some functionality. Um we
[19:06] have some tabs down here for the
[19:08] different types of formats that are now
[19:09] available. Some of these are existing,
[19:11] some of them are new. Um so under here
[19:13] we have printed books. and print a books
[19:16] or something that you'd want to be able
[19:17] to print and read for yourself or
[19:18] somebody else. We have an option here to
[19:20] read online. So, if you want to just sit
[19:23] at your computer and and read a message,
[19:25] you can do that. And you can also
[19:28] download or listen to a message uh from
[19:31] the message hub as well. So, on the
[19:34] bottom here, you've got a list of all
[19:35] the messages that are available for that
[19:37] particular language. Right now in
[19:39] English, we have 1,084.
[19:42] Um, so you got your reference number,
[19:44] title, location, and when it was that we
[19:47] actually uploaded this message to the
[19:49] um, message hub. So in the list, what
[19:51] we've done to make it easier for people
[19:52] to look and say, are there any new
[19:54] messages? Well, any new message will be
[19:56] at the top of the list. So you don't
[19:58] have to then worry about, you know,
[20:00] hunting and searching for it.
[20:03] Um, and if you want to do a quick
[20:04] search, let's do a, um, we're on audio
[20:06] right now. Aaron, once you type in um
[20:09] 62-0513M
[20:13] and as he types, it filters the list and
[20:16] gives you the specific message that
[20:18] you're looking for. So you don't have to
[20:21] go through all the pages. You can either
[20:22] you can type by the the reference
[20:24] number, the title, or the location. Any
[20:26] way you want to find a message, just
[20:27] type the information that's in the list.
[20:30] Then if we click on that title on the
[20:32] right hand side, it shows you the
[20:34] available formats for that particular
[20:37] tab. Here it's just audio. So you have
[20:39] the option now to be able to just listen
[20:41] to it online or be able to download it.
[20:42] I know some of this stuff is is
[20:44] existing. A lot of you may already know
[20:46] about this, but uh one nice feature that
[20:48] we've added is the ability to actually
[20:51] read and listen at the same time. So if
[20:54] we uh let's go back to read online first
[20:57] and then click on the title. So now on
[20:59] the right hand side it's got a read ic
[21:01] or sorry read online. So you click that
[21:04] Aaron
[21:06] and we just maximize that.
[21:12] So now what we have here is we have at
[21:13] the very top here we have an audio
[21:15] player. Down below we have the text and
[21:18] you can just scroll down. Now one thing
[21:21] that we've done is we want we wanted the
[21:22] site to be easier for you know the
[21:24] masses to be able to read it online. So
[21:26] what we have here is we have a little
[21:27] scroll bar where you can actually adjust
[21:29] the size of the font to make it as big
[21:30] as you want. And then so if you just
[21:33] click on the play button now
[21:39] &gt;&gt; good morning friends. It's a fine
[21:41] morning and good time to be here.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:45] [Applause]
[21:47] &gt;&gt; So what we're trying to do here is we're
[21:49] trying to make it to me it's not really
[21:51] a website. This is more of a tool and
[21:53] that's why we kind of re restructured it
[21:55] to make it a more effective tool that
[21:57] more people will be able to benefit from
[21:59] or Okay, let's close that window.
[22:04] Now we're back here. So, but let's let's
[22:07] go to the printed books. Now, there's
[22:08] there are some new formats. They're not
[22:10] all on here yet because this is a new
[22:12] website and the old website didn't
[22:13] accommodate all these new formats. But
[22:15] we have in total, I believe, nine
[22:17] different formats including audio and
[22:19] the online version. And once this is um
[22:23] launched in the next couple of days,
[22:25] we're just uh fixing a couple of little
[22:26] bugs in it, but once it's launched,
[22:29] Sister Beth and the translators and
[22:31] everyone will have lots of work to do to
[22:32] get the new messages uploaded. So right
[22:35] now we've got two types of um message
[22:38] book formats for the printed books and
[22:41] that is metric paper sizes and then the
[22:43] what we call the US paper sizes. The US
[22:46] paper sizes you know your your standard
[22:47] letter size 8 and 1 half by 11 whereas
[22:50] the metric ones are more for the
[22:51] European the Asian countries where they
[22:53] use a different standard for the uh page
[22:56] sizes. So if we uh click on say the US
[23:00] paper size that that's what we use here
[23:02] gives you the option now either to open
[23:03] it or to save it. So if you just want to
[23:05] save it for later use you can do that or
[23:07] you just click on open it downloads it
[23:13] and there it is. Now it's available for
[23:16] you to print on your printer. And we'll
[23:18] have different formats on there where
[23:19] you can have it'll be single-sided. So,
[23:22] if you don't have a printer that will
[23:23] print on two sides, you can have a
[23:25] version that'll just print on one side.
[23:28] Um, we've got, if you've seen, I think
[23:30] Brother Ed has shown to the congregation
[23:32] before, we have the little pocket sizes
[23:33] that fit in your shirt pocket. Those are
[23:35] really nice. They're working on those,
[23:38] and
[23:40] those are basically the formats there.
[23:41] The other thing that we've done now is
[23:42] we want to be able to recognize those
[23:44] that have labored to uh contribute
[23:46] towards the translation and the
[23:49] transcribing of of the messages. So if
[23:51] we go to the contributors page, the
[23:54] English uh text that we have of of the
[23:57] message was transcribed by by brother
[23:59] David Mamelis and uh those that have
[24:01] worked with him and are still doing um
[24:04] transcriptions on it. So what we wanted
[24:06] to be able to do is, you know, give
[24:08] credit where credit is due. Give him a a
[24:09] bouquet now and just let people know who
[24:12] are these ones that have contributed to
[24:13] this. It's not just us. There's a lot of
[24:16] people behind the scenes that do a lot
[24:18] of work, spend countless hours, and we
[24:22] want to make sure that, you know,
[24:23] everybody as we can gets, you know, some
[24:25] sort of credit towards this. So, we'll
[24:28] have this as as time goes on, there'll
[24:29] be other languages that will be added
[24:31] onto it as well. Um, if you want to go
[24:33] to the message index, this is going to
[24:35] take a minute to load.
[24:37] Now, this is more for translators and
[24:40] it's going to give you a long list of
[24:41] every message that we have and what
[24:43] format it's been um or what yeah what
[24:47] format it's been formatted into and to
[24:49] give an idea to people well what
[24:51] messages should I translate so if we
[24:53] have people that it would say well I
[24:54] want to translate in a certain language
[24:56] and there's only a few there which one
[24:57] should I translate this list here just
[25:00] give it as a long list this here we go
[25:02] this list is then going to show them
[25:03] which um messages need to be translated
[25:06] bill.
[25:07] So the ones in green mean that they're
[25:09] available. The ones in red are not
[25:11] available. So basically have they would
[25:14] translate one version and then once they
[25:17] have the the trans uh translation done,
[25:19] then it's just a a little bit of time
[25:21] then to format into each type of book.
[25:24] So if you can just scroll down there,
[25:25] you can see all the books and all the
[25:27] messages that are are and aren't
[25:28] available. So again, that's more for
[25:30] translators. It was again we wanted to
[25:32] make it so the message hub was a tool
[25:34] that we could communicate to those who
[25:36] are burdened to actually do and have
[25:38] part a part in the translation of it. If
[25:40] you go to translation templates
[25:44] now, I just have my little test file up
[25:46] there, but again, this is what we're
[25:48] intending this to be is so that if
[25:49] people want to translate, we can provide
[25:52] them with the translation templates
[25:55] where they can actually type in all
[25:56] their content and then with that
[25:59] template then they can actually then
[26:01] create a PDF, upload it to the hub and
[26:03] so as fast as they can translate it,
[26:06] transcribe it, format it, it can be on
[26:08] the hub within hours.
[26:12] Then uh so they can actually download if
[26:14] they like to there with a download
[26:16] button. We won't bother doing that
[26:17] though. And then the last thing, oh we
[26:19] have the donate button here which just
[26:20] takes you to PayPal.
[26:23] Um so if anybody's interested in
[26:26] supporting the message hub that is one
[26:27] way that you can do it. Go online, make
[26:29] a PayPal contribution that goes directly
[26:31] to missions. And then the final um
[26:35] toolbar button there is contact us,
[26:37] which we don't have anything like that
[26:38] really on our website right now. So it's
[26:40] kind of like how do I contact somebody?
[26:42] So at least we have a little bit more
[26:44] information on there. Um
[26:48] just trying to think of anything else
[26:50] right now.
[26:52] I think that's about it. So I'm planning
[26:55] to have it launched within the next
[26:56] couple of days. Um I want to thank all
[26:59] those that have contributed. Um, again,
[27:01] it was a lot of work. Um,
[27:04] but as you know, like I say, it's it's
[27:06] it was well worth it. So, I just say God
[27:08] bless you and thank you very much for
[27:10] supporting the message hub for those
[27:12] that do transcriptions, those that
[27:14] support financially, those that give of
[27:15] your time. You know, it's not going to
[27:17] be God's not going to overlook the least
[27:19] of what you do for his kingdom. And to
[27:22] think that, you know, we have a we have
[27:24] the message at our fingertips. It's so
[27:26] easy for us to get on our iPods,
[27:28] iPhones, computers. We have it printed
[27:31] out. But just think about those that
[27:33] don't have it. Those those that I'll
[27:35] just do a little little uh short little
[27:37] testimony here. My brother-in-law went
[27:40] to the Congo to minister and he went to
[27:42] two different churches. And the
[27:46] the only thing the minister had was two
[27:48] message books to preach out of. And
[27:51] there was so much confusion between the
[27:53] churches because they didn't have any
[27:55] any word to to to build their foundation
[27:58] on and or to to build their their um
[28:01] testimonies on. So they said, "Well, no,
[28:03] I don't want to share if I get a I get I
[28:04] get a you know, print hub station, I
[28:06] don't want to share with anybody. I want
[28:07] to keep to myself." But that's that's
[28:09] the attitude they have because they
[28:10] haven't been taught what the word says
[28:12] because how can you how can you really
[28:14] get a revelation of the word with only
[28:15] two message books
[28:16] &gt;&gt; and especially this is a pastor who's
[28:18] preaching to his congregation. So,
[28:20] whatever we can do to get the message
[28:22] out, you know, God, give us the
[28:24] strength. God, give us the the desire
[28:26] and the burden to do it to bless
[28:27] somebody else that's not as as uh as
[28:30] fortunate as we are.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; So, I just pray that you just remember
[28:32] us in your prayers. Remember all those
[28:34] that translate and uh I say God bless to
[28:38] each and every one of you. Thank you for
[28:39] your time.
[28:50] Wonderful. Thank you, brother Darren.
[28:52] Sister Marina in the choir. Why don't
[28:53] you come? Let's sing. Blessed be.

[31:23] blessed.
[31:26] Amen.
[31:30] [Music]
[31:58] [Music]
[32:13] I've just come into a valley, one like
[32:17] I've never been before.
[32:21] I keep searching for a way out. Seems
[32:25] like padlocks around the door. Oh, there
[32:29] must be another sunrise. Another sunset
[32:34] that I'll see. God will make this trial
[32:39] a blessing.
[32:40] That's the love he has for me.
[32:45] God will make this trial a blessing.
[32:50] Though it sends me to my knees,
[32:54] though my tears flow like a river,
[32:58] yet in him there's sweet relief. There's
[33:02] no need to get discouraged.
[33:06] There's no need to talk defeat.
[33:10] God will make this trial a blessing
[33:14] and the whole wide world will see.
[33:24] I was not the first one to come into
[33:29] this place. You see every child of God,
[33:35] this test he must face. It is here that
[33:40] God will mold you and make you what you
[33:44] ought to be. God will make this trial a
[33:49] blessing. Just be patient. You will see.
[34:00] Now I'm standing on the mountain.
[34:04] Looking back I can see. When I was in
[34:09] that lowest valley, his strong hand was
[34:13] leading me. Oh, it's good to see the
[34:18] sunshine
[34:20] and taste sweet victory.
[34:23] God has made this trial a blessing.
[34:27] Oh, the grace he gives to me.
[34:32] God will make this trial a blessing.
[34:37] Though he sends me to my knees,
[34:41] though my tears flow like a river,
[34:45] yet in him there's sweet relief. There's
[34:49] no need to get discouraged.
[34:52] There's no need to talk defeat.
[34:56] God will make this trial a blessing
[35:00] and the whole wide world will see.
[35:09] God will make this trial a blessing.
[35:14] Though it sends me to my knees,
[35:18] though my tears flow like a river,
[35:22] yet in him there's sweet relief.
[35:25] There's no need to get discouraged.
[35:29] There's no need to talk defeat.
[35:33] God will make this trial a blessing.
[35:37] And the whole wide world will see.
[35:42] God will make this trial a blessing.
[35:47] And the whole wide world will see.
[35:53] [Music]
[36:01] [Applause]
[36:16] Amen. Our brother Ben Drake's going to
[36:18] come sing a special for us. And
[36:19] Immediately after that, they're going to
[36:20] have their little one, Rehea, dedicated.
[36:22] So, Brother Ben, why don't you come?
[36:24] Let's sing in everything. Give him
[36:25] thanks. Amen. Thank you, choir, Sister
[36:28] Marina. We appreciate that. Amen. Oh,
[36:32] and
[36:35] oh everything.
[36:39] Oh, give him thanks.
[36:43] Just give him thanks.
[36:49] in
[36:51] everything.
[36:55] Just give him
[37:03] the good time.
[37:07] Just praise his name.
[37:10] Oh,

[37:19] in everything.
[37:22] Just give the king of kings.
[37:27] All the things
[37:31] in everything
[37:33] for your
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] in
[37:40] [Music]
[37:54] Everything
[37:56] just give it.
[38:02] [Music]
[38:24] The king of
[38:27] all
[38:30] the Heat. Heat.
[38:42] And in the last time
[38:45] just do the same
[38:49] in everything.
[38:53] [Music]
[38:54] The king of kings
[38:57] all the things
[39:02] you Amen. Praise the Lord.
[39:10] Uh friends, I just um
[39:15] just my heart is so filled with
[39:17] expectation for this morning and for
[39:19] with what we've been hearing. It's just
[39:22] it's truly rapturing faith beating
[39:23] within our hearts and
[39:25] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful to be a part of it.
[39:28] Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; I think back a few years ago and I was
[39:33] running, you know,
[39:35] &gt;&gt; and this little song says, "He came to
[39:37] me and I'm so thankful
[39:39] &gt;&gt; that he came to me and just want to sing
[39:41] it from my heart and forgive me. Little
[39:44] broken this morning. It's a special day
[39:46] and
[39:48] we just we just want to get out of here.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; So, we're just believing and we're going
[39:52] to stand up and have faith
[39:54] &gt;&gt; and just press in because
[39:57] I I just believe for the supernatural
[39:59] this morning and
[40:01] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to explode here. So, praise
[40:03] the Lord.
[40:07] [Music]
[40:22] The golf that separated
[40:26] me
[40:28] from Christ my Lord.
[40:36] It was so fast
[40:39] the crossing I could never afford.
[40:46] [Music]
[40:49] From where I was
[40:52] to his domain
[40:55] it seemed
[40:57] so far.
[41:02] I cry, dear Lord,
[41:06] I cannot come to where
[41:11] you are.
[41:15] And he came to me.
[41:22] He came
[41:25] to me
[41:29] when I could not come
[41:33] to where he was. He came
[41:38] to me.
[41:42] Oh, and that's why
[41:45] he died
[41:49] on Calary.
[41:56] When I could not come
[42:00] to where he was,
[42:03] he came to me.
[42:08] [Music]
[42:22] Oh, he came to me
[42:26] when I was bound in chains of my sin.
[42:35] He came to me
[42:39] when I could find no hope
[42:43] within.
[42:49] He reached down,
[42:52] drew me down
[42:55] to his side.
[42:59] [Music]
[43:01] where today
[43:04] his sweet love
[43:08] I now abide.
[43:14] He came.
[43:18] Just join with me, saints.
[43:23] [Music]
[43:32] He was
[43:34] he
[43:37] [Music]
[43:40] and that's why he
[43:44] [Music]
[43:51] [Music]
[43:54] could not
[43:57] to where he was. He came to me.
[44:05] Oh, for he came to me.
[44:12] He came
[44:15] to me.
[44:18] Hallelujah. I could not come
[44:23] to where he was.
[44:26] He came
[44:28] to me.
[44:31] Oh, and that's why he died
[44:38] on Calary.
[44:45] When I could not come
[44:49] to where he was,
[44:52] he came to me.
[44:57] For he came
[45:00] to me.
[45:04] He came
[45:06] to me
[45:10] when I could not come
[45:15] to where he was.
[45:17] He came to me.
[45:22] [Music]
[45:23] Oh, and that's why he died.
[45:30] Oh calary.
[45:33] [Applause]
[45:36] When I could not come
[45:40] to where he was, he came to me.
[45:49] He came
[45:52] to me.
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] [Applause]
[46:08] That's why we're here
[46:11] &gt;&gt; because he came to you, came to me.
[46:14] We're
[46:16] so thankful
[46:18] in this atmosphere. We're going to have
[46:20] the baby dedication for our brother Ben
[46:24] and sister Amanda.
[46:26] And if they'll just bring their little
[46:29] one up now, we'll be fine.
[46:32] I'd like to
[46:34] say that uh Jesus took time and brother
[46:38] Brandham took time for the little ones.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Suffer the little ones to come unto me
[46:46] for such is the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; God would give us the trust that these
[46:51] little ones have and the faith that they
[46:54] have.
[46:55] Amen.
[47:02] We're happy today that
[47:05] Sister Amanda's mother, Sister Dick, is
[47:08] able to be here with us. This child has
[47:12] grandparents on Ben's side, Brother
[47:16] David and Sister Pat Drake.
[47:19] And uh
[47:22] Sister Dick and Brother Dick.
[47:25] We
[47:28] uh we want to convey our thanks to God
[47:32] for his grace.
[47:34] And we have a great grandmother
[47:38] too, Sister Elner Drake.
[47:40] We always knew you were a great
[47:42] grandmother before this happened, but uh
[47:52] Brother Ben, thanks for the song.
[47:57] One of my favorites.
[48:00] Brother Ben and Sister Amanda,
[48:04] they have named this child Rehea
[48:08] Shayen. Is that correct?
[48:13] Parents often struggle with names.
[48:16] I had some my grandchildren. I would
[48:20] visit them 3 4 days after their birth
[48:23] and they still didn't have a name. Said
[48:25] it's coming.
[48:27] And so our brother Ben and Sister
[48:29] Amanda, they chose names
[48:32] that they combined together to come with
[48:35] a a a wonderful spiritual meaning for
[48:39] them. Taking depths of meaning from both
[48:42] of the names
[48:44] and I'm taking the combined name of
[48:46] heavenly life.
[48:49] Shaylin is life
[48:52] and
[48:54] Rehea is heaven.
[48:57] and taken from the
[49:00] from the meanings of the words. But I'm
[49:04] wanting to say that heavenly life is
[49:08] coming from heaven
[49:11] and dwelling in heaven.
[49:14] And those are two wonderful things,
[49:17] coming from heaven and dwelling in
[49:19] heaven. And Jesus said, "Take heed that
[49:21] you despise not one of these little
[49:23] ones. And for I say unto you that in
[49:27] heaven their angels do always behold the
[49:31] face of my father which is in heaven.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; We as mortals we are so
[49:38] uh limited to what we see what we hear
[49:43] but taking from the scriptures from the
[49:45] words of Jesus and emphasized by our
[49:48] prophet in this day there's another one
[49:51] standing here. That's her angel.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Another one is standing here, the one
[49:58] who told us about that angel. And that's
[50:00] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; And he's more present than we are,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; more real than we are,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; just beyond our sight. But they are
[50:10] here.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; And this child's angel
[50:15] always is before the face of the father.
[50:18] Amen.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Lo children are inheritage of the Lord
[50:21] and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
[50:24] It's his heritage or his possession or
[50:26] his property,
[50:28] his inheritance and his portion. And
[50:30] that is why he dispenses his angel
[50:34] as my property.
[50:36] And I'm going to entrust it to you,
[50:38] brother Ben and Sister Amanda. And this
[50:40] little one will no doubt be very very
[50:42] close to you. I don't know. They they
[50:45] say that uh girls are close to their
[50:47] mother. When they're young, they closer
[50:49] to their father. They get older. I don't
[50:51] know if that's true or not, but I can
[50:53] see brother Ben, you're very very
[50:55] touched by having this daughter. Brother
[50:58] Brandham said, "Take heed that you
[51:01] despise not one of these little ones,
[51:03] for their angels always. Behold my
[51:05] father's face which is in heaven."
[51:08] remember he said they have an angel
[51:12] and when you're born it stays with you
[51:14] all through life and here's just part of
[51:16] a prayer
[51:18] he prayed and I wanted to repeat that
[51:22] prayer before we pray and now their
[51:27] little ones are here watching the lives
[51:30] of their father and mother
[51:33] as we are examples in all that we do our
[51:36] dear God creator creator of heavens and
[51:38] earth, guide our feet. And so I'm
[51:42] praying that for you, Sister Amanda,
[51:44] Brother Ben.
[51:46] Guide our feet, Lord, that we'll do that
[51:51] we'll not do nothing before these little
[51:53] ones that would put a stumbling block in
[51:56] their way.
[51:58] For it is said it'd be better that if we
[52:00] had a millstone tied around our neck and
[52:03] to be cast into the sea than to offend
[52:05] one of these little ones.
[52:08] And you said their angels always behold
[52:11] my father's face which is in heaven, the
[52:14] great angel and guardian angel over each
[52:18] one of these little ones. And I'm going
[52:21] to pray today that this Rehea
[52:26] Shayen will be heavenly life in your
[52:30] home and a brightness. We'll dedicate
[52:32] her to the Lord.
[52:40] Maybe I'll just keep her.
[52:47] Heavenly Father,
[52:50] what a treasure and what a delight it is
[52:52] to be able to hold this gem, this jewel
[52:55] that you have given to our brother Ben
[52:57] and sister Amanda.
[52:59] I'm praying, oh God, that every day of
[53:01] her life. Father, she will be under the
[53:04] protection of the Holy Spirit. I pray
[53:07] that you will guide both father and
[53:09] mother. Oh God, give words to Sister
[53:11] Amanda
[53:13] as she instructs the child. give
[53:15] guidance to brother Ben, father, as he
[53:18] lives before this child. And I pray,
[53:22] dear Lord, that this dedication will be
[53:24] a a a double dedication. That father and
[53:27] mother will dedicate themselves to you
[53:29] in a new and living way. That they will
[53:31] say, "We, Lord, stand here to be the
[53:34] kind of father and the kind of mother
[53:36] that you would have us to be for this
[53:38] child." And we're thankful for her,
[53:40] Lord. We pray that you'll keep her in
[53:42] good health. We pray that you'll watch
[53:44] over her, Father. Provide for her all
[53:46] the days of her life and keep her from
[53:48] the stains of evil and from the wicked
[53:50] influences of this world. I pray that
[53:53] she'll be shielded and put a wall of
[53:55] fire around her, oh God. And as you have
[53:57] given her to our brother Ben and sister
[54:00] Amanda, we now dedicate her in the name
[54:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ and give her
[54:06] back to you, oh God, that the name of
[54:09] Jesus will be glorified in her life.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:20] God bless you, Sister Amanda.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[54:26] God bless you, brother Ben. Amen.
[54:31] God bless you.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[54:36] Hallelujah.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; I was wondering if our brother Roger and
[54:44] Sister Topppsy made it from White Horse.
[54:49] Well, my goodness, there they are. Well,
[54:51] why don't you stand up?
[54:52] our brother Roger Lassard and Sister
[54:54] Topsy. Lassard, God bless you.
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:03] They've moved down to uh worship with us
[55:07] and to fellowship and go along and go in
[55:10] the rapture with us. I hope
[55:13] that's that's what we're counting on.
[55:15] It's a long drive. come a long ways from
[55:18] White Horse to be with us and we're so
[55:21] thankful for that. Brother Abe Dick, God
[55:23] bless him. He journeyed all the way up
[55:26] there. That's a long ways. That's maybe
[55:30] 1500 miles or so. But we're thankful for
[55:34] him and his willingness to go up there.
[55:37] We want to remember this morning too
[55:40] just before we go to the word or when we
[55:42] pray for brother Nathaniel Johnson. How
[55:46] many of you remember brother Nathaniel
[55:47] Johnson when he was here? Yes, there was
[55:50] quite a few. And uh he was uh he was a
[55:55] teacher or principal up in the in the
[55:57] school in Tucson and also ministered up
[56:00] in the north. I remember he lost a son
[56:03] on the on the Yukon River. And uh uh
[56:08] he's he's been in the hospital on life
[56:11] support. He had a stroke about some time
[56:13] ago and uh
[56:17] he may not be on life support very long
[56:19] because the family's decided to remove
[56:22] that from him and they're waiting for a
[56:25] daughter I understand to come from New
[56:28] York. Uh I think we want to at least the
[56:33] very least we can do is remember the
[56:35] family.
[56:37] I always respected and admired our
[56:39] brother Nathaniel. is a real fine man of
[56:42] God. So, I wonder if you'd stand with me
[56:45] and we want to remember this family. And
[56:48] if you have a need, I know we've already
[56:50] had prayer, but we can God is always
[56:53] ready to hear us when we pray. And we
[56:56] want to also pray for the word. I feel a
[56:59] special something I'd like to deliver to
[57:02] you today. Pray that the Holy Spirit
[57:05] will presence himself mightily. Almighty
[57:08] God, creator of heavens and earth, all
[57:12] of the universes, oh God, all everything
[57:15] that every every uh planet and every
[57:19] star and all of these things, oh God,
[57:22] but you set aside this this orb that
[57:26] we're on that we call the earth. And as
[57:28] your prophet said, it's a womb for your
[57:31] seed. And this worth is earth is full of
[57:34] life. And father, we're full of life. Oh
[57:38] God, by the living word of God. You have
[57:41] given us eternal life. Thank you,
[57:43] Father, for this great gift. And I pray
[57:46] that the Holy Spirit breathe upon this
[57:48] congregation, oh God. And let nothing,
[57:51] Father, hinder the word coming to its
[57:53] ordained place. Feed the sheep, oh God.
[57:57] Guide us, I pray. Bless, Father, the
[58:01] Nathaniel Johnson's family, Father. He
[58:04] may not be aware, but perhaps you're
[58:06] just taking him over, oh God, into the
[58:09] other land that he's preached about,
[58:12] he's lived for, Lord, he's prayed for,
[58:15] he's desired this moment. Oh God, let
[58:18] his entrance be a glorious entrance as
[58:21] he's received by the saints. Oh God, I
[58:24] pray, Father, that you will bless the
[58:26] family. And if there be any that are not
[58:28] living where they should be living, I
[58:30] pray that you will use this moment,
[58:32] Lord, to let dad's testimony witness to
[58:36] them. Father, in the name of Jesus
[58:38] Christ, I pray that you'll achieve what
[58:41] you need to achieve, oh God. And now we
[58:43] dedicate ourselves to you. Pray you'll
[58:46] anoint hearer and the speaker in Jesus
[58:49] Christ's name. Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And everyone could say amen to
[58:53] that.
[58:55] Take your Bibles if you would and we'll
[58:57] turn quickly to
[59:01] the book of second Peter
[59:03] reading from in chapter 3 starting with
[59:07] verse 5.
[59:15] Brother John is going to be going down
[59:17] to Seattle
[59:19] for the afternoon meeting. Those of you
[59:22] that are here from Seattle, we're
[59:23] thankful for you. And brother Tom and
[59:26] sister Joanna are in Arkansas with
[59:30] brother Jason Jackson at his church
[59:32] taking the services today. Thank you for
[59:35] your prayers. Brother Tom was kind of
[59:37] stricken with a a bug and uh one day but
[59:41] God strengthened him so he was able to
[59:43] take the service last night and to
[59:46] today.
[59:48] So now we will read in first and second
[59:51] Peter uh 2 Peter 3 and5.
[59:54] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[59:57] that by the word of God the heavens were
[1:00:00] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:00:02] water and in the water whereby the world
[1:00:07] that then was being overflowed with
[1:00:09] water perished. But the heavens and the
[1:00:12] earth, which are now by the same word,
[1:00:15] are kept in store, reserved unto fire uh
[1:00:19] against the day of judgment and
[1:00:20] predition of ungodly men.
[1:00:24] But beloved, be ye not ignorant of this
[1:00:27] one thing, that one day is with the Lord
[1:00:29] as a thousand years, and a thousand
[1:00:31] years as one day. The Lord is not slack
[1:00:34] concerning his promise, as some men
[1:00:37] count slackness, but as long-suffering
[1:00:40] to us word, not willing that any should
[1:00:42] perish, but that all should come to
[1:00:44] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[1:00:47] come as a thief in the night, in the
[1:00:49] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[1:00:52] great noise, and the elements shall melt
[1:00:54] with fervent heat, the earth also, and
[1:00:56] the works therein shall be burned up.
[1:00:59] Seeing then that all these things shall
[1:01:01] be dissolved, what manner of persons
[1:01:04] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[1:01:07] and godliness, looking for and hasting
[1:01:10] unto the coming of the day of God,
[1:01:12] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[1:01:15] be dissolved, and the elements shall
[1:01:17] melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[1:01:20] according to his promise look for new
[1:01:22] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:01:24] righteousness. Would you turn please to
[1:01:27] Revelation the 21st chapter
[1:01:30] reading just four verses starting with
[1:01:32] verse one. And I saw a new heaven and a
[1:01:35] new earth for the first heaven and the
[1:01:38] first earth were passed away and there
[1:01:40] was no more sea and I John saw the holy
[1:01:44] city new Jerusalem coming down from God
[1:01:47] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[1:01:49] adorned for her husband. And I heard a
[1:01:52] great voice. I'd like you to notice this
[1:01:54] verse, please. And I heard a great voice
[1:01:57] out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[1:01:59] tabernacle of God is with men, and he
[1:02:02] will dwell with them, and they shall be
[1:02:04] his people, and God himself shall be
[1:02:07] with them, and be their God, and God
[1:02:10] shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:02:12] eyes." Have you had any?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I'm sure we have. Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; God shall wipe away all tears
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; from our eyes. Whatever caused those
[1:02:26] tears, friends, going to pass away.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And there shall be no more death.
[1:02:35] Who here has been touched by it one way
[1:02:38] or another?
[1:02:40] Friend, a loved one,
[1:02:44] someone close,
[1:02:46] there'll be no more death.
[1:02:48] That's why we're here.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And there will be no more sorrow,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; nor crying,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; neither shall be there shall there be
[1:02:59] any more pain.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; For the former things are passed away,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; not will be, as far as God is concerned,
[1:03:06] are passed away.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat and
[1:03:11] hold your attention, please.
[1:03:15] And let's have as little movement as
[1:03:16] possible.
[1:03:18] The prophet said in future home and I
[1:03:20] would encourage you to
[1:03:23] uh read prayerfully and slowly the
[1:03:26] future home the message that's where
[1:03:29] we're going
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; and the and the prophet's message to me
[1:03:34] has been so
[1:03:36] profound and more recently in the last
[1:03:40] few years and I would say probably in
[1:03:43] the last year even it it seems that
[1:03:46] we've come into a a season.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; This is a season of rapture and
[1:03:52] resurrection.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And we've been in the prophecy of Luke
[1:03:56] 24,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; the resurrection and the gathering of
[1:04:00] the people. The resurrection not only of
[1:04:03] Jesus, but of all of those that were
[1:04:04] seen on the streets of Jerusalem
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; as well. and uh and the gathering of the
[1:04:10] living and the dead uh with those that
[1:04:13] saw them and those that reported it and
[1:04:16] those that spoke with Jesus and that he
[1:04:18] was there with them perhaps of 40 days
[1:04:22] uh with all of these remarks uh
[1:04:24] remarkable things and he and brother
[1:04:26] Brandham said in future home and by
[1:04:28] these passages one might think or be led
[1:04:31] rather to believe that the whole planet
[1:04:34] of this earth will be destroyed. He
[1:04:37] said, "I make a new heaven and a new
[1:04:38] earth." See, the heavens will be gone
[1:04:42] and the earth will be gone completely
[1:04:45] annihilated.
[1:04:46] But a close study with the help of the
[1:04:49] Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of
[1:04:52] this. And that's what we're going into.
[1:04:55] And he said, "It's only the atmospheres
[1:04:58] around it and the sin that's upon the
[1:05:01] earth that will be destroyed." And I
[1:05:04] cannot say glory to God in the highest
[1:05:07] as loud as I would like to. I'd like to
[1:05:10] declare it over the whole earth. Praise
[1:05:12] God
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; when sin is gone
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; and Satan is gone
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; and the framework he said will remain.
[1:05:20] Peter said and will melt with fervent
[1:05:23] heat. Brother Brandon I'm still quoting
[1:05:24] it. And the works therein burnt up not
[1:05:27] the planet the works therein the works
[1:05:30] of man. all their politicians and their
[1:05:34] schemes and all their denominations and
[1:05:37] man-made schemes will go with it when it
[1:05:40] burns and heavens will pass away with a
[1:05:44] great noise.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a
[1:05:49] literal fire.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; It's also a holy fire.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll take a holy fire to
[1:05:57] restore it to a holy place
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; fit for God's dwelling. He says, "And
[1:06:01] that will take away Satan and all of his
[1:06:05] devils, both heaven and earth will pass
[1:06:09] away." Then he goes into pass away.
[1:06:11] Heavens and earth will pass away. He
[1:06:13] said, "Now this word passing from one
[1:06:15] form to another, it's not the it's not
[1:06:18] to mean annihilation. It means passing
[1:06:22] from one thing to another. To pass from
[1:06:26] one condition, it says to another. And
[1:06:29] then in Titus 3 and three, he refers to
[1:06:32] it. Paul is using this same word pass
[1:06:35] away. He's using the same word which
[1:06:37] means regeneration of men.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Your old life passed away.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Your old desires passed away.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He says that man has passed from a
[1:06:49] sinner to a saint. Not completely
[1:06:52] annihilated.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Not completely annihilated. When a man's
[1:06:57] changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's
[1:06:59] a changed person. He's been changed from
[1:07:02] what he was to what he is, not
[1:07:06] annihilated. Thank God we've been
[1:07:08] changed.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus used the same word at the
[1:07:12] resurrection of Lazar. Lazarus, loose
[1:07:14] him, change him. He's been tied. Let him
[1:07:18] go.
[1:07:20] And when he told the disciples, "Go and
[1:07:21] get a colt, he'll be tied. Loose him.
[1:07:25] Let him pass from a tied condition to a
[1:07:28] loose condition from being tied and not
[1:07:31] being able to fulfill the plan of God,
[1:07:33] but to be now changed." So where you
[1:07:37] think the Messiah himself would ride on
[1:07:39] him,
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; the earth will be loosed from the grip
[1:07:44] of Satan.
[1:07:46] It'll be loose. It'll be loosed from
[1:07:48] politics.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; It'll be loosed from denominational
[1:07:51] religious systems
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God to be
[1:07:55] established here on earth.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; I pray,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; very frequently and I pray very very
[1:08:04] slowly and and with great deal of
[1:08:08] purpose in my words. Our father
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven,
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; I can't define that. But you are my
[1:08:17] father
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and you are in heaven.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't say that as deeply as I
[1:08:28] would like to. Thy kingdom come. When I
[1:08:30] think of everything we see and
[1:08:32] everything we face, I say, "Thy kingdom
[1:08:34] come." My soul cries out, "Thy kingdom
[1:08:37] come." A kingdom of justice.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; We held a little baby. Do you know this
[1:08:45] little child today in brother Ben and
[1:08:47] Sister Amanda's home and the others that
[1:08:48] we've I think we've had a dedication
[1:08:51] every service for the last several
[1:08:52] services. How privileged those children
[1:08:55] are. Their children today while we're
[1:08:57] here.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; You had breakfast. They didn't.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; You had something to eat. There's a
[1:09:03] little children with their bodies out of
[1:09:06] condition, out of shape and
[1:09:08] malnourished.
[1:09:10] They didn't deserve it. It's this
[1:09:12] wickedness,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; greedy men,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; power- hungry men,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; cruel men,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Satan who who possesses them. Listen
[1:09:24] friends, that's what this prophet's
[1:09:27] message came to remind us that we are
[1:09:30] now in that season.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it or you'll miss it.
[1:09:37] God doesn't send a seventh messenger
[1:09:39] like that for the world to take lightly
[1:09:42] or the religious world to take lightly.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; You won't see this again.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; You will not see another one like that.
[1:09:49] You won't have someone standing and
[1:09:52] saying he's here now. I'll speak to the
[1:09:54] first person revealing the secrets of
[1:09:57] the hearts. I tell you, it's a lot more
[1:09:59] than just revealing. And then Pentecost
[1:10:01] missed it completely. Think it's just
[1:10:03] some gift or some gift of discernment.
[1:10:05] missed it completely. And that's why
[1:10:07] they don't don't have the word because
[1:10:09] they refused the word.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when he came up out of the
[1:10:17] water," and you may wonder about that
[1:10:18] scripture. I I don't want to take any
[1:10:20] time with it, but it says that
[1:10:23] that he the the the earth was in the
[1:10:26] water and out of the water. And we know
[1:10:28] that Jesus Christ was the beginning of
[1:10:31] the new creation of God. If you go into
[1:10:33] Genesis, you'll find it that God
[1:10:35] separated and the the the water rose up
[1:10:38] out of the the earth rose up out of the
[1:10:41] water and the waters were dried back and
[1:10:43] whatever more. But in the new creation,
[1:10:46] Jesus Christ, the seed that produced
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ was a created seed of God.
[1:10:54] And it was by the word of God that he
[1:10:57] spoke as I spoke last Sunday. By the
[1:11:00] words of the prophets. By the word of
[1:11:02] God. The prophet said the words of the
[1:11:05] prophets anchored to the womb of Mary.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; The words that God spoke through them
[1:11:14] anchored and that was a created seed.
[1:11:17] And now when he comes and the voices to
[1:11:19] speak over him, he's the beginning of
[1:11:22] the new creation.
[1:11:23] If God in a man
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; and the body is of the earth,
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; his body was of the earth. He took the
[1:11:32] earth up through the womb of a woman
[1:11:35] through which seed through which sin
[1:11:37] came to commence the redemption process.
[1:11:41] And now Jesus Christ himself, the earth,
[1:11:44] the body of earth is standing in the
[1:11:46] water and out of the water.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the voice spoke, "This
[1:11:51] is my beloved son.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; This is the beginning of the creation of
[1:11:56] God." Hallelujah. In the first creation,
[1:11:58] he ended with a son, but this one, he
[1:12:00] starts with the sun.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Thought I'd just drop that in.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; And John the Apostle saw the new
[1:12:09] Jerusalem descending out of heaven. John
[1:12:13] the Baptist saw the Holy Spirit as a
[1:12:16] dove descending upon a part of the
[1:12:18] earth. Jesus Christ. And John the
[1:12:21] Apostle saw the New Jerusalem descending
[1:12:25] upon the earth, out of heaven, upon the
[1:12:27] earth. And John the Baptist saw the Holy
[1:12:31] Spirit descending as a dove upon a part
[1:12:34] of the earth. Brother Bram says Jesus
[1:12:36] Christ.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; And law of voice
[1:12:40] from heaven.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; And this is the title of my message, a
[1:12:44] great voice
[1:12:46] out of heaven. You want to listen very
[1:12:48] close because I'm going to take some
[1:12:52] sharp turns in the message
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; and it might sound too natural
[1:13:02] but I think I want I want you to
[1:13:04] consider some things very deeply today.
[1:13:08] And lo, a voice from heaven saying,
[1:13:10] "This is my beloved son in whom I am
[1:13:13] well pleased."
[1:13:16] in a future home. Yet John said, "I saw
[1:13:18] the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[1:13:22] descending out of heaven as a bride
[1:13:24] adorned for her husband." The new
[1:13:27] Jerusalem appeared like the a bride
[1:13:30] adorned for her husband. And where did
[1:13:34] it settle on? Just exactly like it did
[1:13:37] there upon the earth. Jesus was a part
[1:13:41] of the earth. Listen friends, you'll
[1:13:43] have to p you'll have to pinch your
[1:13:45] conscience now. Say, God, let the spirit
[1:13:48] of revelation come upon me.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I saw the holy city, Jerusalem,
[1:13:55] the new Jerusalem, descending out of
[1:13:57] heaven as a bride adorned for her
[1:14:00] husband. And where did it settle on? He
[1:14:04] asked. And then he breaks into it and
[1:14:06] says, just exactly like it did on there
[1:14:09] upon the earth. Jesus was part of the
[1:14:12] earth that the Holy Ghost descended
[1:14:14] upon. Is that right? And remained upon
[1:14:18] him forever. It never can leave him.
[1:14:20] It's always there. He and God are one.
[1:14:24] Always has to remain. And so John saw
[1:14:28] the holy city. He's going back and forth
[1:14:31] from the baptism of Jesus to what John
[1:14:33] saw. And so John saw the holy city, the
[1:14:36] new Jerusalem, descending like a comet
[1:14:40] or a dove coming down out of heaven and
[1:14:44] settling upon a redeemed earth.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood in the water and the dove
[1:14:51] came down as a testimony because that
[1:14:53] was the beginning of the redemption of
[1:14:55] the whole earth.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And in him was the blood that was going
[1:14:59] to be spill at Calvary and claimed the
[1:15:02] whole earth.
[1:15:04] Hallelujah.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And you have been redeemed already.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The very body that you're
[1:15:12] in, that's why it's going to be
[1:15:14] resurrected. Jesus has redeemed it.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; It's already redeemed.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Your soul is redeemed.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Has always been redeemed. Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; But your body shall the elements I
[1:15:29] whether you were buried in the ocean or
[1:15:31] or burned at the stake, God will call it
[1:15:34] forth.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it'll be in the likeness
[1:15:37] that he intended it to be. Do you
[1:15:39] believe that people
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; to claim every attribute
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; that he made the earth for? This earth
[1:15:48] was made for his redeemed attributes,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; his redeemed children. And that's what
[1:15:54] this earth is made for. Wasn't made for
[1:15:56] New York and Los Angeles and London and
[1:15:59] Paris and whatever goes on there. Wasn't
[1:16:01] made for these governments. Wasn't made
[1:16:03] for these things. Wasn't made for wicked
[1:16:06] wars and all these turmoils. It was made
[1:16:08] for the redeemed saints.
[1:16:11] And righteousness shall reign supreme.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And friends, I want to be in that
[1:16:17] kingdom.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. Oh God, is that your
[1:16:22] heart cry?
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Remember the message a few weeks ago?
[1:16:27] That needs to be the allconsuming desire
[1:16:30] within you.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Not, oh God, I got a pain in my
[1:16:33] shoulder. Oh God, my knee is not good.
[1:16:35] And oh God, my heart that that's fine.
[1:16:37] That's in the package. That's not the
[1:16:40] main thing for the people. Now it's, oh
[1:16:42] God, let thy kingdom come.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Let thy rapture come.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Let the change come. It's been spoken in
[1:16:51] the word and that's my promise.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Let that sweep come. I live for that
[1:16:58] sweep.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Let these atoms be changed
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:17:06] Let the resurrection come.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; When was the last time you looked for a
[1:17:12] resurrected saint? That ought to be one
[1:17:14] of our key desires. Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll see one this morning.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; How can we believe it and not believe
[1:17:28] it?
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; You say that's going over the edge.
[1:17:30] Well, the prophet said, "I'm crazy. They
[1:17:33] say I'm crazy. Just leave me that way."
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; We're looking for another city.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; They can have these perverted places.
[1:17:47] Give me that city,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; that new Jerusalem, which we are part of
[1:17:51] that city.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; To claim every attribute that he made
[1:17:57] the earth for. Every man that was
[1:18:00] represented in the eternity and every
[1:18:02] woman is redeemed. Then the holy blood
[1:18:06] that was created by God, the blood, the
[1:18:09] life, the creation of God. Jesus was the
[1:18:13] beginning of the creation of God.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost descended upon Jesus,
[1:18:21] which was Jesus was a part of the earth.
[1:18:24] As I said a moment ago,
[1:18:26] and then brother Brandham goes into it.
[1:18:28] It's actually paragraph 49. And I'll
[1:18:30] leave it because I'm trying to save a
[1:18:32] little bit of time.
[1:18:34] He said, "His spirit light floods the
[1:18:37] pyramid city."
[1:18:39] Like Peter and John, I tell you, you
[1:18:42] know this prophet messenger, he's in
[1:18:45] another dimension.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; He'll describe something out of the
[1:18:49] scripture and then he goes to something
[1:18:51] in the scripture and you need to have
[1:18:53] your spiritual mind on and your
[1:18:55] spiritual let the Holy Spirit because
[1:18:58] when he goes from one to the other, the
[1:19:01] human mind can't connect them.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; But you better say, God, give me your
[1:19:06] mind because they are connected. Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; So he says the pyramid, the spirit light
[1:19:13] floods a pyramid city, the building the
[1:19:16] the city four square
[1:19:19] and he describes it 1500 miles square
[1:19:21] 1500 miles high like a pyramid. He said
[1:19:24] like Peter and John up on the on top of
[1:19:27] the mountain the light covered the top
[1:19:29] of the mountain mount transfiguration
[1:19:33] and a voice spoke.
[1:19:36] A voice spoke.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; In Revelation 21:3 and 4, he says, "And
[1:19:46] I heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:19:49] saying, behold, the tabernacle of God is
[1:19:53] with men."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I can speak it
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; and God can say, "That's fine. You're
[1:20:00] called minister of the gospel. You can
[1:20:03] speak it and say the same words." And
[1:20:05] those words will go out into the I will
[1:20:07] say into the infinity of eternity and
[1:20:11] because it goes rippling out. I want you
[1:20:14] to think about that. But when the
[1:20:16] seventh messenger comes according to
[1:20:19] God's season and time, born at the right
[1:20:22] time, born under the sign, born with the
[1:20:26] supernatural, with the light following
[1:20:28] all through. And then when he begins to
[1:20:30] say there's a voice out of heaven
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; saying hallelujah.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; That voice
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; goes into the heavens.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You heard brother Darren speaking about
[1:20:44] the hub.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; I'll just give you a little clue in
[1:20:47] where I'm going. There has never been
[1:20:50] brother Brandham in fact is in
[1:20:51] countdown. The one thing that he
[1:20:53] declares emphatically is that human
[1:20:56] scientific achievement happens and going
[1:21:00] along in concert with it is the
[1:21:02] achievement a spiritual achievement. And
[1:21:06] he called Wesley Luther, he called
[1:21:08] Luther a scientist, a spiritual
[1:21:10] scientist. Wesley was a spiritual
[1:21:12] scientist because he said they're
[1:21:14] discovering things in the word and
[1:21:17] they're discovering spiritual
[1:21:19] achievements. And he says they're taking
[1:21:21] the chemicals, the chemistry of the
[1:21:24] word, the chemicals of the word, and
[1:21:26] there's achievement in the body of
[1:21:28] Christ, and we're moving higher and
[1:21:30] higher and higher. This is the first
[1:21:32] time since Adam. Now, our voices, I'm
[1:21:36] getting ahead of myself, but you'll see
[1:21:37] where I'm going. Our voices go out into
[1:21:40] the into the infinity, as I said, of
[1:21:43] eternity. Just go echoing on out. But
[1:21:46] man has never been able to until this
[1:21:48] age go up into that space and bring it
[1:21:52] back down
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; and hear it.
[1:21:56] [Music]
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Go onto your computer and go to the
[1:22:02] message and search the first message in
[1:22:05] 1947.
[1:22:06] Faith is a substance. And the first
[1:22:09] words out of the prophet's mouth are,
[1:22:11] "We have a new gadgets here
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; for recording."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; You think that's an accident? That's
[1:22:21] absolutely divinely ordained of Almighty
[1:22:24] God because God had ordained that that
[1:22:27] voice would be recorded and he knew that
[1:22:30] that voice would go into the heavens and
[1:22:33] he knew that we could have a scientific
[1:22:36] achievement in this hour that can pull a
[1:22:38] voice back down
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and for the first time listen to
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; a dying humanity can listen to that
[1:22:48] voice. I say to you today, as far as I'm
[1:22:50] satisfied, it's a voice from heaven.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And you can pull all your trash and
[1:22:58] garbage out of it if you wish. And I
[1:23:00] don't wish to, but there's all kinds of
[1:23:02] trash and garbage that's up there. Every
[1:23:05] man's voice and all of this nonsense and
[1:23:08] all of these lies that are spoken of by
[1:23:11] politicians and failed promises and all
[1:23:14] of these predictions and all of these
[1:23:16] things. That is why the prophet declared
[1:23:19] in the future home that it's going to be
[1:23:22] burned up. No wonder there'll be a great
[1:23:24] noise
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and the heavens will be on fire and
[1:23:29] God's going to purge it. You think he's
[1:23:31] going to leave e any of that evil trash
[1:23:33] up there? He's going to cleanse every
[1:23:35] wit of it.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; It'll be purified.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And I want to make another statement.
[1:23:41] God for sure will never destroy his own
[1:23:45] word.
[1:23:48] The only thing that will remain there is
[1:23:51] God's word.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; You'll still hear all the messengers
[1:23:55] voices. You'll still hear that prophet's
[1:23:57] voice.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; It'll still there. God even made the
[1:24:01] atmosphere to retain the voice
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; for judgment's sake.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And for justification's sake,
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; listen to me now. You're hearing my
[1:24:14] voice. I'm going to make announcement to
[1:24:16] you according to the prophet's word.
[1:24:18] You're going to hear your own voice.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; And he said he will hear his voice
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; screaming out against this generation.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; You'll hear your voice.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And of what he said, I'm going into what
[1:24:34] he said.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; He said that your thoughts speak louder
[1:24:38] in heaven than your words on earth.
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:49] That's my introduction.
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; This beginning of the new creation
[1:25:02] was the holy son of God,
[1:25:06] the blood of God.
[1:25:08] an act of creation
[1:25:11] and a body of the earth. And the
[1:25:14] scripture says in Hebrews 12:24, "And to
[1:25:17] Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant,
[1:25:20] and the blood of sprinkling that
[1:25:22] speaketh better things than that of
[1:25:24] Abel." What is speaking?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; What is speaking?
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; The blood that speaketh better things.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to think deep now.
[1:25:35] And and the Bible says after Cain was
[1:25:39] slain, after Abel was slain, rather, and
[1:25:43] God said and he said, "What hast thou
[1:25:45] done? The voice of thy brother's blood
[1:25:49] crith unto me from the ground."
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't quite comprehend it, but
[1:25:56] I read it and I believe it. Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And God said, "The voice of Cain's blood
[1:26:02] cries to me out of the ground."
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know what it said, but the Bible
[1:26:07] says that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:09] speak of better things than that of
[1:26:12] Abel.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not say, "I forgive
[1:26:15] you."
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not say, "Father,
[1:26:19] forgive them, for they know not what
[1:26:21] they do."
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Abel's blood could not do that. But the
[1:26:24] blood of Jesus Christ, the blood of
[1:26:27] Jesus Christ through the mouth, the
[1:26:28] words of a prophet, which is the
[1:26:30] bleeding word
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; could say you never did it in the first
[1:26:34] place.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; I don't think you want to be accountable
[1:26:38] for every thought, every word, every
[1:26:41] act. So we say, "Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I accept that.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I accept that.
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:52] What other minister? Not just a
[1:26:53] minister. That was the words of Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ coming through his servants's
[1:26:57] mouth.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have another thought if I
[1:27:04] were you.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; That's his thought.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Paul said to the Corinthians, "If the
[1:27:15] trumpet give an uncertain sound, who
[1:27:16] shall prepare himself to battle?" So
[1:27:18] likewise you, except you utter by the
[1:27:22] tongue words easy to be understood, how
[1:27:24] shall it be known what is spoken? For if
[1:27:27] you shall speak, for you shall speak
[1:27:29] into the air. There are it may be so
[1:27:34] many kinds of voices in the world and
[1:27:36] none of them is without signification.
[1:27:39] Therefore, if I know what the meaning of
[1:27:42] the voice, I shall if I if I know not
[1:27:45] rather the meaning of the voice, I shall
[1:27:47] be unto him that speaketh a barbarian.
[1:27:51] And he that speaketh unto me a
[1:27:52] barbarian, and a barbarian is one who
[1:27:54] speaks in a foreign strange language
[1:27:57] which is not understood by another.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; So Paul says we won't understand. And so
[1:28:04] we hear in the scripture, the Bible says
[1:28:07] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:28:09] walking in the Jordan. I try to imagine
[1:28:13] what that was in Deuteronomy. And the
[1:28:16] Lord said, "Speak and the Lord spake
[1:28:20] unto you out of the midst of the fire."
[1:28:23] God spoke. I don't know how it was
[1:28:26] conveyed. I don't know if it was
[1:28:28] articulated into words or if it was some
[1:28:31] sound. I don't know what it was. As I
[1:28:33] said last Sunday, the voice of the
[1:28:36] resurrection. Is it simply the voice of
[1:28:39] words that are heard on our eard drum or
[1:28:42] is it something that goes beyond the
[1:28:44] eardrum into our mind and down into our
[1:28:47] heart, down into our soul? Or is it
[1:28:51] words combined with manifestation?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Because things that we see can be so
[1:28:58] much more powerful when it's visually.
[1:29:00] And so when we hear a word, it's like a
[1:29:02] teacher saying to a class, giving it all
[1:29:05] to the class and and then turns to the
[1:29:08] to the board and said, "Now I'll do a
[1:29:11] diagram." And he the prophet does that
[1:29:13] here. He describes it what what the
[1:29:15] person is like that has a snake in their
[1:29:18] in their heart and what the person is
[1:29:19] like that has the word of God in their
[1:29:21] heart. And so he drives a draws draws a
[1:29:24] diagram to describe and so visually the
[1:29:27] people can see. So perhaps after the
[1:29:29] resurrection, why Jesus said, and now
[1:29:32] you're catching my recent messages, why
[1:29:35] Jesus said because they were having some
[1:29:37] doubts. He said, "Touch me.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Feel me."
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that would pronounce the uh
[1:29:44] a resurrection. They were having doubt.
[1:29:47] They thought it was a spirit. They had
[1:29:49] heard the strange things from the women
[1:29:52] and those that had run to the tomb. But
[1:29:54] he said, "Touch me because I would help
[1:29:57] to to impress them that the resurrection
[1:30:00] indeed had happened."
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; A spirit hath not flesh and bones such
[1:30:05] as I have. Touch me.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And in this in this age, we
[1:30:10] got to go beyond just hearing a message.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; We need to take that message until it's
[1:30:15] absorbed
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; in us. Until you can touch it.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. This message is
[1:30:24] Jesus Christ and he's no less real today
[1:30:29] than he was back then. And if he said
[1:30:32] back then, catch me after the
[1:30:35] resurrection. That's what give them
[1:30:37] faith
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; to believe and to preach the
[1:30:40] resurrection. And the book of Acts opens
[1:30:42] with the resurrection. This age opens
[1:30:45] with the resurrection. And it closes
[1:30:47] with the resurrection. Our message is a
[1:30:51] message of the resurrection.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Because when the saints are resurrected,
[1:30:56] I guarantee you, you're only here for a
[1:30:59] very few days.
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; And you'll be one.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; There's not many.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; That's one thing the message is makes me
[1:31:11] quiver.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; There's not many.
[1:31:14] But I'm determined
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; by God's grace
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; to be in that number.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; If I go by the way of the grave, I'll
[1:31:25] beat you to it.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I'll beat you to it before your bodies
[1:31:28] change.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Because the dead and Christ shall rise
[1:31:31] first and then we who are alive and
[1:31:34] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:31:37] them.
[1:31:39] Hallelujah.
[1:31:42] Make your calling and election sure.
[1:31:44] Make sure you have a place at the
[1:31:46] wedding supper table.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; We're not here for any other reason.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; This message has been a clear sound.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; So what is the sound? What is the voice?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And it spoke a voice out of the midst of
[1:32:07] the fire. Deuteronomy 5:23 says, "And a
[1:32:11] voice out of the midst of the darkness,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; and John 1, John 12, and 28, then came
[1:32:18] there a voice from heaven, saying, I
[1:32:21] have both glorified it
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; and will glorify it again."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God comes to that
[1:32:27] very scripture in the first seal.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to it in a few
[1:32:33] minutes,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:32:37] Yeah,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do something a little
[1:32:41] different.
[1:32:43] Don't lose track of where I am.
[1:32:48] Brother John Andy's asked a group of men
[1:32:51] to come help me here. I'd like all those
[1:32:55] men to come at this moment. If you would
[1:32:58] please.
[1:33:11] Just line up across here.
[1:33:22] When you speak and when you have the
[1:33:24] microphone in front of you,
[1:33:28] I want you to say it
[1:33:30] with the same force that you'd hear a
[1:33:33] prophet of God say it. I want you to
[1:33:36] read from the same.
[1:33:39] You have it there, but I want you to
[1:33:40] read from the same one. And then you'll
[1:33:42] hand it to the next person and you'll
[1:33:45] say it. Use the microphone right up to
[1:33:47] your mouth, please. And say it in your
[1:33:49] language. Okay?
[1:34:00] Okay. Respond.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Same paper.
[1:34:18] Fore
[1:34:42] same paper.
[1:34:46] How many understood that?
[1:34:50] Four.
[1:34:53] At least four.
[1:35:06] How many understood that? Praise the
[1:35:08] Lord.
[1:35:21] [Applause]
[1:35:23] Wow.
[1:35:25] Hallelujah. We struck the mother load.
[1:35:41] Amen.
[1:36:06] Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; We all heard words.
[1:36:12] We all heard speech.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; We all heard men speak,
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; but our minds were not fruitful.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Now listen. All of these men said the
[1:36:25] same scripture
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; that you believed or you wouldn't be
[1:36:28] here. Repent and be baptized every one
[1:36:32] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:36:35] the remission of sins and you shall
[1:36:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Now every one of these men spoke
[1:36:43] different completely different words
[1:36:46] completely different language but they
[1:36:48] have all experienced the same thing.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you hear something beyond
[1:36:55] the word.
[1:36:57] Thank you, brothers. Thank you.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; So, they heard a voice out of the fire.
[1:37:09] They heard a voice out of the darkness.
[1:37:11] Uh they heard a voice out of the burning
[1:37:13] bush. But it all had the same effect.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; And there came a voice out of heaven
[1:37:23] saying,
[1:37:26] I have both glorified and will glorify
[1:37:28] it again. And Apostle Paul said, I heard
[1:37:32] a voice speaking unto me and saying in
[1:37:36] the Hebrew tongue,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; God can speak Hebrew.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; He can speak African.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; He can speak French and English.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; He can speak any language.
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our sister Topsy here has a
[1:37:52] great aunt or an aunt who is translating
[1:37:55] a message in the Inuit language. For
[1:37:58] those of you who don't know what Inuit
[1:38:00] is was formerly Eskimo and it's the
[1:38:03] first time I know that it's going into
[1:38:05] that language
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; but when that when they are done Sister
[1:38:08] Topppsy they will go on the hub
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; and it will be a voice from heaven.
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:18] Don't think that that is just too
[1:38:20] practical or too common. That is a voice
[1:38:23] from heaven. God knew that was going to
[1:38:26] be available. God knew whose message was
[1:38:29] going to be there.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even as I speak to you,
[1:38:34] the prophet's voice is up there. A voice
[1:38:36] from heaven crying out, "Come out of
[1:38:39] her, my people."
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; It's a voice from heaven.
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Don't think I'm beside myself, friends.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; I've been thinking about this one for a
[1:38:55] long time.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And I heard another voice from heaven,
[1:39:02] John in the Revelator says, saying,
[1:39:04] "Come out of her, my people, that you be
[1:39:07] not partakers of her sins, and that you
[1:39:10] receive not her plagues." Isn't it
[1:39:13] amazing that John would hear a voice out
[1:39:15] of heaven and he could articulate those
[1:39:18] words
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; and then those words are translated and
[1:39:22] brought down into English and into all
[1:39:24] kinds of languages which would just be
[1:39:27] garble. But when that person believes it
[1:39:29] and this person believes it, I don't
[1:39:31] know what the thing sounds like, but the
[1:39:34] effect of it is exactly the same.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why when the
[1:39:41] bride comes marching in, they'll all be
[1:39:44] dressed the same. Hallelujah. Because
[1:39:47] they believe the same word.
[1:39:52] [Applause]
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; I've been in a lot of countries and all
[1:39:59] I can say is it's been a privilege to
[1:40:01] see them whether in the Russia or in
[1:40:03] China or the islands of the sea. They
[1:40:06] have all have the the same message has
[1:40:09] the same effect.
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; They don't have to go to a Bible school.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; They don't have to spend years.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; I've seen young ones just born into the
[1:40:26] faith and they are transformed
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; by the power of the word of God.
[1:40:35] [Music]
[1:40:38] Hallelujah.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in the first seal
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; in John 12:27-28, he says, "Now listen
[1:40:51] here real close." That's him saying it.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Then you won't have to wonder no more
[1:41:01] what it is.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] And Jesus answering him said, "The hour
[1:41:08] has come."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; That the Son of Man should be glorified.
[1:41:13] And brother Brham interjects.
[1:41:16] So we're at the end of an age there. His
[1:41:19] ministry is ending.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And his own ministry was ending.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; He's at an end of an age here.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; The seals are now going to be open. He's
[1:41:28] going to preach a few short services and
[1:41:30] be gone.
[1:41:32] And Jesus his his ministry was ending.
[1:41:35] His life was ending.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; And he goes on, "The hour has come that
[1:41:39] the son of man
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; should be glorified."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham breaks in.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; that when this his bride must be taken
[1:41:51] away?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; What about that hour?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; What about the hour has come
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; that time shall be no more?
[1:42:01] The angel is ready to set a foot
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; on the land and another on the sea with
[1:42:07] a rainbow over his head over him with
[1:42:10] his feet and say time's run out.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Where are we folks?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Where are you?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; I've got news for you. You're here.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; I hope you can catch up
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; to the unfolding of the word. I hope you
[1:42:29] can catch up to the fulfillment of the
[1:42:31] word.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be so slow
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; that we have to walk with the
[1:42:36] resurrected Christ and have him explain
[1:42:39] the scriptures and details and say all
[1:42:41] fools and fools and fools as we know it
[1:42:44] is oh slow slugards lazy and mentally.
[1:42:49] Let's not be lazy today.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; You young people, you pinch your
[1:42:54] conscience. You can learn in school. You
[1:42:56] can learn here in church.
[1:42:58] We're in a late hour
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; and there's a fresh sweep
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; in a resurrection season.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell that to you. You
[1:43:10] know it. You feel it.
[1:43:12] [Applause]
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Time's run out. And besides that, he
[1:43:20] raised his hand and swore that time
[1:43:24] would be no more.
[1:43:26] And that's not that the clocks stop.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Time no more is that there will be no
[1:43:30] longer a delay
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; for the revelation because this is the
[1:43:34] first seal. And now each night
[1:43:37] afterward, he's going to speak the
[1:43:39] others.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be a thunder, which is
[1:43:42] a voice of God.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Do you hear it, brothers, sisters?
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Do you hear it?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; You read the seals, it ought to be a
[1:43:52] thunder to you. Yeah.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Said, "Well, he spoken years ago."
[1:43:56] Listen, he spoke for our He's a prophet,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; speaking ahead of his time.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The hour has come that the son of man
[1:44:10] should be glorified.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Father, glorify that name, thy name.
[1:44:18] Then came there a voice from heaven.
[1:44:21] And there were other people there, but I
[1:44:23] don't know who heard it, but Jesus heard
[1:44:25] it. It was articulated.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; I heard a voice from heaven saying, "I
[1:44:31] have both glorified it and will glorify
[1:44:36] it again."
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And the people and those that stood by
[1:44:39] heard it and they said, "It thundered."
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; So God spoke, but it sounded like a
[1:44:45] thunder.
[1:44:46] And it didn't mean anything to the some
[1:44:48] people, but to others it meant I have
[1:44:52] glorified it and will glorify it again.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And that was recorded
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; so that it could be brought down into
[1:45:03] our time. And the prophet said, "And
[1:45:06] then when the lamb took the book and
[1:45:07] broke the first seal, God spoke
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; from his eternal throne
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; to say what that seal was revealed."
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; God spoke
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; from his eternal throne.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Through who?
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Through who?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Through a man that could speak the
[1:45:29] language you most of you understand. And
[1:45:32] to those that don't understand it, there
[1:45:34] are people like these men says they've
[1:45:37] got my people have to know this. People
[1:45:40] like brother Murphy up there right now
[1:45:42] and people like brother Timothy Maul
[1:45:45] over 450 messages in the Vietnamese. How
[1:45:49] can they hear it? A voice from heaven.
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:46:00] God bless every minister.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I thank God for them.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Thank God those that travel. Thank God
[1:46:06] for every interpreter. Thank God for the
[1:46:08] translators.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; But just think now, it isn't even they
[1:46:12] don't have to fly in a jet. God in the
[1:46:15] creation of the earth made a a sphere to
[1:46:18] hold the voices of the people. your
[1:46:21] voice, my voice.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I've got a ways to go. So, I hope you
[1:46:25] just hang on a moment.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And he reserved it for his voice,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; not these adulterers and these
[1:46:34] celebrities, so-called fallen stars,
[1:46:36] devils, demons from hell, perverted
[1:46:40] people,
[1:46:42] murderers, and adulterers.
[1:46:45] He made it for his voice. He made it for
[1:46:48] the voice of the witnesses. He made it
[1:46:51] for your voice.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; He wanted to hear you say, "I believe
[1:46:56] that."
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to He wanted to hear you
[1:47:00] say, "Lord Jesus, speak on."
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; He wanted you to hear. He wanted to hear
[1:47:13] you say, "Lord, what wil thou have me to
[1:47:17] do?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And I will do it."
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said in the first seal,
[1:47:36] speaking from his throne, he says, "But
[1:47:37] when it was placed before John, it was a
[1:47:39] symbol. And when John saw it, it was
[1:47:42] still a mystery.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Remember he said, "A loud clapping noise
[1:47:46] of a thunder is the voice of God."
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And when it came and and the prophets
[1:47:54] receiving it in the first seal, he said
[1:47:57] it was a sworn affidavit
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; to the church. He stops reading. I have
[1:48:03] glorified it and I will glorify it
[1:48:05] again. He said it's a sworn affidavit.
[1:48:10] a sworn affidavit. And you know, an
[1:48:12] affidavit is a written declaration
[1:48:16] made on an oath
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; before somebody
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; authorized
[1:48:22] to administer the oath.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; There had to be a vindicated
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; prophet,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; a vindicated messenger who year after
[1:48:33] year after year, this one of whom I
[1:48:35] speak was not ashamed to stand by him.
[1:48:38] He was he was an authorized person to
[1:48:42] administer the oath
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; and the or oath is a sworn affidavit to
[1:48:49] the people.
[1:48:55] [Applause]
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Tell your friends
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; serious moment. It doesn't get any
[1:49:00] stronger than that.
[1:49:06] It doesn't get any stronger than that.
[1:49:08] And notice where it's placed in the
[1:49:11] first seal. I have glorified it
[1:49:14] and I will glorify it again.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:49:20] Because we're at a wedding time.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; And the woman, Paul said, is the glory
[1:49:27] of the man. That's right.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; And now that season had just arrived
[1:49:32] where the woman the bride was this was
[1:49:34] the messenger calling the bride out. He
[1:49:36] said that's what the shout is to make
[1:49:38] the bride to call her out.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he must be glorified again.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:50] I feel like doing a dance
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; before God who gave this word
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; to think that he would call us the likes
[1:49:57] of you and me
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; to be part of this thing.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh, how great is our God.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Aren't you privileged?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; That's your word, Lord.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; A voice of languages.
[1:50:20] As I said and as I had the brethren
[1:50:22] here, completely different in sounds.
[1:50:25] Yet the word of God will produce
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; and does produce the same thing.
[1:50:39] our voices. I'm going to go quickly now
[1:50:41] because I have just give me about
[1:50:43] another 10 or 15 minutes if you would
[1:50:45] please. This message actually deserves
[1:50:48] another hour or so.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; But I don't want to be long. But I said
[1:50:53] our voices I want to make a statement
[1:50:55] then I want to back it up with a with a
[1:50:58] message. Our voices are going on out
[1:51:01] into the infinity of eternity.
[1:51:05] And Jesus said, "But I say unto you that
[1:51:09] every idle word that men shall speak,
[1:51:13] they shall give an account thereof in
[1:51:16] the day of judgment."
[1:51:19] In deep call to the deep, brother
[1:51:21] Brennham said, "Lord, let us today,
[1:51:26] let us be today the lightgivers of this
[1:51:28] age." That when the great drama is set
[1:51:32] out at the end of the road.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; And listen to me my brother, my sister,
[1:51:36] if I ever or never speak to you again,
[1:51:39] you do have an end at your road.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Whether it is the change of the body or
[1:51:44] whatever, but these words will still
[1:51:45] hold true.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; These words are in heaven.
[1:51:50] Yes, sir.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; When we come to the end of the road and
[1:51:55] each one of us, there's nobody hiding
[1:51:58] behind another one. Each one of us
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; comes up before you and the great screen
[1:52:05] is pulled out
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; and our lives of this generation is
[1:52:10] brought back before us. God,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; here's this prayer now. God,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; let me hear my voice.
[1:52:18] screaming out against unrighteousness
[1:52:23] and calling to people to believe on
[1:52:26] Jesus Christ.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God, when that hour comes, let me
[1:52:30] hear my voice from today calling people
[1:52:35] to righteousness. Believe on the word
[1:52:38] that God has sent
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; and that's your righteousness. Abraham
[1:52:45] believed God and it was accounted to him
[1:52:47] for righteousness
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; which incidentally is your garment
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; that you need to be clothed. You need to
[1:52:55] hear the voice from heaven.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; To be clothed
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; so that you don't stand before him
[1:53:01] naked.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; The word is your garment.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; It's not just something you choose to
[1:53:08] listen to and to hear and to sit on the
[1:53:10] shelf in some books. That's not it.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It's a voice coming from the throne
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; to clothe you.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Because Leodysia was naked.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Why was she naked? Because she refused
[1:53:27] the prophet God sent to her.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; And others just mouthed it. And others
[1:53:35] were hitchhikers. And others were casual
[1:53:38] about it. Whatever you do, my brother,
[1:53:40] my sister, don't be casual about this
[1:53:43] word.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; God's not casual.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Don't you be casual.
[1:53:49] [Applause]
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Young people, hear me?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; You're diligent in your studies. You
[1:53:56] need to be diligent with this. More
[1:53:58] diligent.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Your studies are only for this life.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's voice through his holy
[1:54:07] prophet and prophets,
[1:54:09] apostles, and the bride body of Jesus
[1:54:12] Christ. That's the last voice to the
[1:54:16] last age.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; And is it's going out now. It's being
[1:54:21] recorded.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; It's being preserved to the day of
[1:54:25] judgment
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; in the spoken word.
[1:54:32] And the word of God continually goes on.
[1:54:34] Now, it's not your word, my word, but
[1:54:36] he's saying the word of God goes
[1:54:37] continually on. I'm told that if we
[1:54:40] could pick up an instrument that could
[1:54:42] catch it,
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; that a man's voice, my voice that I
[1:54:46] speak today, 10,000 years from now,
[1:54:49] could still be picked up in the air.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know why the hub is such a
[1:54:53] marvelous thing? Invention, the world
[1:54:56] invented it. We use it for the glory of
[1:54:58] God. is because it's permanently
[1:55:01] recorded and no one can take it out of
[1:55:04] there.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; It's in the heavens.
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's wife, Sister Mey said
[1:55:14] to him, "You go back and forth across
[1:55:17] the nations, back and forth all the time
[1:55:19] preaching. You go right back in the
[1:55:22] people just doing the same thing, and
[1:55:24] what good does it?" He said, I I said
[1:55:29] in the day of judgment,
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; there will be a tape recording on God's
[1:55:34] great tape.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a great recording gadget?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Would you like to have been there in
[1:55:46] 1947?
[1:55:48] His first words,
[1:55:51] if you knew who he was, his first words,
[1:55:54] we've got a new some new recording
[1:55:58] gadget. Gadgets
[1:56:00] or new gadgets here for recording.
[1:56:10] He said, "In the day of judgment, there
[1:56:11] will be a tape recording on God's great
[1:56:13] tape. You're not ignorant of these
[1:56:16] things. God will blast it across the
[1:56:18] skies.
[1:56:19] He's got to have a voice there to
[1:56:22] condemn the world by.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; And the voice is the gospel.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't we thankful today?
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And this voice has been blasted across
[1:56:32] the skies.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; But at the judgment, people will hear
[1:56:35] their own voice.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; God's not going to come and standing
[1:56:39] like with a great accusing finger and
[1:56:41] said, "You rascal."
[1:56:44] It's going to be your own voice
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and you want to fill the heavens
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; with the declaration.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Yay, I believe it.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I believe God's word. I may not
[1:56:55] understand it, but I believe it.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Fill the heavens with your voice.
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:06] Jesus said, and this will take on new
[1:57:08] meaning for you, heavens and earth
[1:57:13] shall pass away.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; You know the last phrase,
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; but my word,
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; my words shall not pass away.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; It's on the basis of that scripture. I
[1:57:27] tell you that everything that's in the
[1:57:29] heavens, every blasphemer,
[1:57:32] every accuser, everyone who's written
[1:57:34] derogatory books concerning William
[1:57:37] Brandham's message and his life, it will
[1:57:41] all pass away.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; But thus saith the Lord shall never pass
[1:57:46] away. My people shall never pass away.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Why don't you raise your hand and say,
[1:57:52] "Praise God."
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; It'll never pass away.
[1:57:58] The message that called you shall never
[1:58:00] pass away.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; You believe Jesus.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth shall pass away,
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; but my word shall never pass away.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I would say when you've crossed over
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; and you begin speaking whatever heavenly
[1:58:24] language has been given,
[1:58:26] There will be nothing else in the
[1:58:28] heavens
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; but the voice of God
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; and Hosea it says and it shall come to
[1:58:42] pass in that day I will hear said the
[1:58:44] Lord I will hear the heavens and they
[1:58:46] shall hear the earth
[1:58:50] and marvelous
[1:58:52] I shall hear the heavens I will hear
[1:58:55] what's in the heavens and the heavens
[1:58:58] hear the earth.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I got two two more very important
[1:59:05] steps. You'll stay with me very close.
[1:59:11] When I first this first came to me, I
[1:59:14] never dreamed I would ever preach on it.
[1:59:16] Never dreamed it. It's a few I'm going
[1:59:19] back a few years. I I thought they were
[1:59:21] just thoughts,
[1:59:23] but to me they were wonderful thoughts
[1:59:25] and I kept them private
[1:59:28] until time went on.
[1:59:31] Brother Brandham says
[1:59:34] he calls the word the bleeding word
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; and that's why he had an indictment
[1:59:42] against this generation
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus
[1:59:46] Christ. And the crucifixion was the
[1:59:48] shedding of blood.
[1:59:50] And this message, he said, this word is
[1:59:52] a bleeding word. Listen now. He said the
[1:59:56] sinner's got to stand judgment and there
[1:59:58] won't be but this judgment. It's just
[2:00:01] like a circle or a rainbow around the
[2:00:04] world of the blood of Christ. Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Every messenger, all the apostles, all
[2:00:12] the prophets,
[2:00:14] Moses' words, Elijah, Elisha, Samuel's,
[2:00:19] Solomon's wisdom,
[2:00:24] Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Naam,
[2:00:27] Jonah, Daniel,
[2:00:30] Habacook,
[2:00:31] all of those prophets, their words are
[2:00:34] all there,
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:36] held.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; The heavens have heard the word,
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Then came the apostles and the
[2:00:45] commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ. Go
[2:00:47] ye out into all the world and preach the
[2:00:49] gospel.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; They that believe shall be saved.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; By believing that word, you be saved.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Denying that word, you're damned. Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Cast your words out.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; I will keep them. I will record them. I
[2:01:09] will preserve them. And then we came
[2:01:14] and the word which Christ is the word.
[2:01:19] And now he was put out into the
[2:01:22] eternities
[2:01:24] through the spoken word of vessels of
[2:01:27] earth
[2:01:28] who he had sent been sent to redeem.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, we're in swimming water. I
[2:01:33] hope you follow me. And so he had these
[2:01:37] were potentially redeemed bodies. Go use
[2:01:40] your body. They'll slay you. They will
[2:01:43] hate you. They will cast you into
[2:01:45] prison. But preach this gospel. And they
[2:01:48] went out and they declared the
[2:01:50] resurrection of Jesus Christ. They
[2:01:53] declared the blood of Jesus Christ as
[2:01:55] the only atonement for sin
[2:01:59] [Applause]
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; until their lives were over and their
[2:02:03] voices were silenced and they went to
[2:02:05] the grave. But he said, "Don't worry.
[2:02:07] I'll raise you up out of there." Amen.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Go speak it.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; We talk about the weather and about our
[2:02:20] education and about our finance and
[2:02:22] about everything else and all the
[2:02:23] business everything else that's all
[2:02:25] going to pass away.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Not that we don't have to do it, but as
[2:02:31] a believers, we do do it within our
[2:02:33] realm of of of life and existence. We
[2:02:36] have to do it. But it's not for a
[2:02:38] believer. That's not a natural thing.
[2:02:40] That's a spiritual thing.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; When you men work and earn a living for
[2:02:44] your family, that's spiritual. It's in
[2:02:46] the word of God.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; But unbeliever does it, it's not
[2:02:50] spiritual because he hasn't believed.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; So it's a bleeding word.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's like a circle, like a
[2:03:01] rainbow around the world. The rainbow is
[2:03:05] of the blood
[2:03:07] of Christ.
[2:03:12] Ever since I was just a young man, I
[2:03:14] pondered about a certain scripture and
[2:03:17] some have gone over the edge with it.
[2:03:20] And that was when Jesus died, he died
[2:03:23] for the sins of the
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; what? world.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; So I thought, how can he damn people
[2:03:32] and have atoned for their sins at the
[2:03:34] same time?
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; There's always a question in my mind.
[2:03:39] Oh, how I thank God for the message.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says that perfectly. He
[2:03:46] says there's a like a ribbon, like a
[2:03:48] ring,
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ around the
[2:03:51] whole earth. and every sinner. He said
[2:03:53] it doesn't matter whether and I'm going
[2:03:55] to just paraphrase now because I've read
[2:03:56] it. I have I know it very well. He said
[2:03:58] she can he can be a drunkard a gambler.
[2:04:01] She can be a prostitute. Whatever. As
[2:04:03] long as they're here, their blood, their
[2:04:06] sins are atoned for.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; But when they die,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; they pass through
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; that ribbon of blood
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; and stand in the presence of God
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and cannot go into the presence of God
[2:04:24] because they do not have any blood.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; They've passed through it.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; When we're down here, we believe on it.
[2:04:32] We believe on the life that came out of
[2:04:35] the blood. We've received the Holy
[2:04:37] Spirit that came from the blood.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; And our sins are erased and forgiven and
[2:04:46] gone.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; But when an unbeliever, just think about
[2:04:49] believing, an unbeliever passes through
[2:04:52] the ring of the blood, he said two
[2:04:54] things. He cannot go into the presence
[2:04:57] of God
[2:04:59] because he does not have the blood any
[2:05:01] longer atoning for him or her. And they
[2:05:05] cannot come back to earth again because
[2:05:07] their time has been lived out.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And he said they're caught in a
[2:05:12] nightmare. And another place he calls it
[2:05:14] the fifth dimension.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; And it's like a nightmare. He said,
[2:05:18] "Like a person who's they're not fully
[2:05:21] asleep and they're not fully awake and
[2:05:24] they're caught in a nightmare."
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "And they are screaming
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; and nashing of teeth
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; because they're caught in a nightmare."
[2:05:34] My dear friends,
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; young and old alike,
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; visitor or believer, unbeliever, make
[2:05:41] believer, whatever you might be, don't
[2:05:44] go there.
[2:05:47] [Applause]
[2:05:49] And you don't need to go there. Say,
[2:05:51] "Brother Ed, what must I do?" Believe on
[2:05:55] this Lord Jesus Christ. Believe on the
[2:05:58] revealed word of God, and thou shalt be
[2:06:02] saved.
[2:06:03] [Music]
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; If you come here just to go to church,
[2:06:09] you're missing it.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm preaching about.
[2:06:14] Amen.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Believe
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; repent
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; and be baptized every one of you
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; And if you've not been baptized, you
[2:06:28] should run to this water.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And thou shalt be saved.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; And they pass through the ring of blood.
[2:06:40] And I have all of these quotes here.
[2:06:46] shows a man when he's unconverted.
[2:06:49] He lived his time up. He's dead on earth
[2:06:51] and he cannot go into the presence of
[2:06:53] God because he's not fit to go there
[2:06:55] without the blood and he's caught. He
[2:06:58] cannot come back to earth because the
[2:07:00] time's finished
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; here on earth and he's caught between
[2:07:03] and he's in a nightmare.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; In a countdown, he says, "But my point
[2:07:10] is this. the scientific things has been
[2:07:14] able to achieve.
[2:07:16] They were there at the world fair. He
[2:07:19] talks about at the world fair I believe
[2:07:20] it's 62 showing by scientific research
[2:07:24] what science has been able to achieve in
[2:07:27] the natural things. Now we are here.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; We are here and he'll tell you why
[2:07:38] you're here. We are here by spiritual
[2:07:40] research.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; We are here because God has used
[2:07:45] spiritual things.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; I am here probably largely because there
[2:07:51] is a gadget here recording his voice.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Was it just some human? Was it just some
[2:08:04] something to to fill in a sentence when
[2:08:06] he said there's a a new we have some new
[2:08:08] gadgets for recording?
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Is it just some statistics which I'll
[2:08:15] give you in just a moment that that the
[2:08:17] voice of God's messenger? I'm glad my
[2:08:20] voice can go as a witness and your voice
[2:08:22] can go as witnesses. I'm glad for that
[2:08:25] because I want to hear my voice.
[2:08:34] That's why the prophet was such an
[2:08:36] example to us.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Said, "Say nice things
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; about one another."
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; You think they saying that just so he'd
[2:08:48] be nice? You're missing it. Say nice
[2:08:51] things cuz you're going to hear it
[2:08:53] again.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe that, you don't
[2:08:59] believe him. If you don't believe him,
[2:09:00] you don't believe God.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; He said a few years ago the
[2:09:11] transportation was by horse and buggy.
[2:09:13] Just give me another few minutes. I'm
[2:09:15] I'm about 10 minutes now. Oh, just a few
[2:09:17] minutes. It represented an achievement
[2:09:20] of God's economy.
[2:09:24] He said the automobile day and the
[2:09:26] airplane day came along and they went
[2:09:28] from the earth into the air. If a person
[2:09:30] will have a spiritual mind and I say,
[2:09:33] "Lord,
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; grant me a spiritual mind." If you'll
[2:09:37] have a spiritual mind, it represented it
[2:09:40] represented what the buggy and the and
[2:09:43] the and the automobile and the airplane
[2:09:46] represented
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; a an achievement
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; of God's economy with his church.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; You've never heard me speak like this,
[2:09:58] friends.
[2:09:59] bring it right to this very moment.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; He said Wesley was one of God's great
[2:10:05] scientists. Luther was one of God's
[2:10:07] great scientists. And he took the
[2:10:09] chemicals of the word and put it
[2:10:10] together. And the church moved by faith.
[2:10:13] The Pentecostals believe the baptism of
[2:10:15] the Holy Ghost that the promise was to
[2:10:17] you, your children, them are far off.
[2:10:20] And they said they put the chemicals
[2:10:21] together and out out of the word and
[2:10:23] they moved into the air. But now
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; something
[2:10:29] else has happened.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to amen me. I just want
[2:10:39] to know you got it.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Something else has happened.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; We got an astronaut now.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got one that went beyond
[2:10:52] the curtain of time.
[2:10:58] Hallelujah.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; And came back.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "We got
[2:11:04] astronauts. We had astronauts long ago.
[2:11:07] Enoch was one of our astronauts. And
[2:11:09] Elijah was one of our astronauts. We got
[2:11:12] astronauts. We got an astronaut in our
[2:11:14] day."
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; And he described what kind of body he
[2:11:22] had. It wasn't just one went up into
[2:11:24] space. He went into another realm, into
[2:11:26] another dimension. Said, "I held I
[2:11:29] pinched my hand, Brother Eddie.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me?"
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I bit my finger.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; I felt for my hair and my head was full
[2:11:37] of hair."
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I felt them and they had
[2:11:41] real bodies."
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; I ask you, are you going there? You
[2:11:46] believe that?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; You ought to say, Lord, I believe.
[2:11:52] I want to hear my voice.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; I believe that prophet of God.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; I believe that Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:02] speaking through him.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; But now something else has happened. And
[2:12:08] he says, "And remember," he drops it in.
[2:12:10] And remember, I'm coming to a close
[2:12:12] right now. The messenger comes at the
[2:12:15] end of the age.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Why does he come at the end of the age?
[2:12:19] tell you what has been happening so you
[2:12:21] can see it and to tell you what is about
[2:12:23] to happen.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "What does it represent?" He
[2:12:26] said, "A spiritual age, a spiritual time
[2:12:29] to where God's going to have spiritual
[2:12:32] astronauts."
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice,
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; God has allowed brothers, as brother
[2:12:41] Darren said,
[2:12:44] he said, "I don't other brothers have
[2:12:47] worked on this. I don't even know the Do
[2:12:49] you know what? I don't even know who who
[2:12:51] it was that worked on the hub alto
[2:12:53] together.
[2:12:55] We put a lot of effort, a lot of time
[2:12:57] and a lot of expense into it
[2:13:03] in the days of the voice.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:13:09] angel.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; And you know what he says about the
[2:13:12] bride? He says she knows
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; what he wants done
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; with the word.
[2:13:20] [Applause]
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; She knows.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; And that's why God puts in their heart
[2:13:28] and they translate on the we hours of
[2:13:30] the night.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; I I I thank God for the brethren that
[2:13:33] have labored and worked. They do theirs
[2:13:35] and they don't see me in in in in my
[2:13:37] night hours
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; and I don't see them and we don't see
[2:13:40] one another.
[2:13:43] I don't hear you pray, but God hears you
[2:13:45] pray.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:50] [Music]
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; The scientific achievement in the bride
[2:13:54] made possible the preservation and the
[2:13:57] permanent preservation of the voice. He
[2:14:01] said, "Oh word believers, this is in
[2:14:04] birth pains.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Oh word believers,
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; give me your attention now. He's calling
[2:14:11] out to you
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; and these words are in the heavens. Oh
[2:14:15] word believers,
[2:14:17] give in to my message.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Hear me. Not my message but his message.
[2:14:27] Lord,
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; the following figures
[2:14:38] are only the last four months
[2:14:44] from December 1
[2:14:46] to the end of March.
[2:14:54] 54,237
[2:14:57] visits from 3,238
[2:15:01] cities in 146 countries
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; in 4 months.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Approximately 200 hub stations have been
[2:15:12] sent all over the world and more are
[2:15:13] waiting right now to go.
[2:15:17] 17 translators working on the hub
[2:15:19] message. That's 17 that we support here.
[2:15:26] But there are men like brotherh Jacques
[2:15:27] in the Czech Republic been translating
[2:15:31] for about 30 years and he's putting all
[2:15:34] of his messages
[2:15:36] on the hub. People are calling from all
[2:15:38] over a brother from South Africa from
[2:15:42] and speaking Zulu. He said I will speak
[2:15:44] Zulu. You only have a couple messages
[2:15:46] Zulu. I will resign my position and
[2:15:49] translate for one year and at the end of
[2:15:52] the year I will seek other employment.
[2:15:57] 1,999
[2:15:59] message were uploaded on the hub in four
[2:16:01] months by brothers and sisters that are
[2:16:03] here in this congregation or those that
[2:16:05] are burdened for it.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; 109,819
[2:16:11] messages downloaded from the hub.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:18] This isn't merely statistics.
[2:16:21] Somebody's hearing the voice.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; 46 languages on the hub.
[2:16:31] And
[2:16:35] in February, just February,
[2:16:39] 30,000
[2:16:41] 30,000 in February downloaded messages
[2:16:46] in one month. And that is triple last
[2:16:50] February.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; You see where it's going, friends? This
[2:16:54] isn't the work of man. It isn't even the
[2:16:56] work of this. People ask me, "Who owns
[2:16:58] the hub?" I said, "We don't. I don't
[2:17:00] know. The bride owns it.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; We certainly don't own it. We're just
[2:17:03] pushing it for all we're worth
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; because we believe in it.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; There's a there's we're trying to figure
[2:17:10] out a way right now to get one over to
[2:17:12] northern Uganda and I think that the
[2:17:14] best way is to buy one over there and
[2:17:15] that's what we're communicating to them.
[2:17:17] And they said we will we will the tribal
[2:17:19] languages up here. There isn't messages.
[2:17:21] We'll translate and put them on and
[2:17:23] we'll print books for 40 40 churches in
[2:17:26] this area.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Is that a good work? Amen.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; $1,200 or $1,500 to provide this message
[2:17:33] to 40 churches. I say absolutely that's
[2:17:36] the best best deal I ever heard of.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; We can put the voice.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; First time in history
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; that the prophet's voice,
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; vindicated voice can be pulled down
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; out of the heavens
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; and listened to.
[2:18:00] Don't ever take that lightly, friends.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; You'll go home and look at your MP3s or
[2:18:04] your CDs or whatever more and you'll
[2:18:06] have a lot a much greater appreciation
[2:18:09] for it than you've ever had.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:14] Amen.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; And last, and I'm done,
[2:18:23] we say we are washed
[2:18:26] by the water
[2:18:28] of the word.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:18:36] we're washed.
[2:18:39] The word is water.
[2:18:42] The word is cleansing.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; The word will cleanse you from what
[2:18:48] nothing else can cleanse you. You can
[2:18:50] wash. Pilate washed his hands. He could
[2:18:52] not cleanse
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; himself.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; We can't cleanse ourselves. We can't We
[2:18:57] can't think our way out of this thing,
[2:18:58] friends. We can't think our way out of
[2:19:01] our mistakes, out of our errors or
[2:19:03] whatever more. You can't do that. You
[2:19:05] can't even think your way into a closer
[2:19:07] walk with God.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; But you hear that word. You absorb that
[2:19:12] word.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Say, "I've heard it before." Hear it
[2:19:15] again.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; It'll wash you when you don't even know
[2:19:20] you're being washed.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; And it'll clothe you.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, he even
[2:19:27] prayed and cried out to God, "Let me
[2:19:30] clothe the bride."
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Do you hear it, friends?
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Let me clothe the bride.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Do you think God heard that? that's gone
[2:19:39] into the heavens. Are you bride?
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one that can clothe you.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; That vindicated messenger. Not what I
[2:19:47] think he said. What he said.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, I tell you, I'm
[2:19:55] completely absorbed. I'm completely
[2:19:57] consumed.
[2:19:59] [Applause]
[2:20:02] There's never been a people
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; that has been had the privilege of
[2:20:06] hearing what we hear.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; And God has sent that to you so that you
[2:20:12] won't have to miss it.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; And if he sent a messenger and said,
[2:20:16] "Don't miss it."
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; You can be sure he's provided a way for
[2:20:20] you to make sure you don't miss it.
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:27] Let's stand, shall we?
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, my loving brother,
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; when the world's on fire,
[2:20:40] don't you want God's bosom
[2:20:44] to be your pillow?
[2:20:48] Oh, hide me over

[2:22:17] brother.
[2:22:19] When the world's on fire,
[2:22:23] don't you want God's good

[2:24:08] never see.
[2:24:10] Listen to this line.
[2:24:22] Yeah.
[2:24:26] Heat.
[2:24:31] [Music]
[2:24:36] You are not
[2:24:40] to be
[2:24:45] I
[2:24:47] [Music]
[2:24:57] for me.
[2:25:00] We're as a body. We're going to pray for
[2:25:01] our sister Charmaine.
[2:25:04] The enemy. He's a vile, wicked one.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Sister Charmaine, I want to say to you,
[2:25:10] there's a voice from heaven.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; And up there it declares even now, I am
[2:25:17] the Lord that healthareth thee.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:24] &gt;&gt; And that voice is sounding through the
[2:25:26] bride of Jesus Christ. Any other person
[2:25:30] sick and afflicted, utter with your void
[2:25:33] voice the voice you'll hear again
[2:25:35] someday. I am the Lord that health thee.
[2:25:40] Are you delivered? Are you bound? If
[2:25:43] you're bound by anything, Jesus Christ
[2:25:46] did not come to bind you. He came to
[2:25:48] loose you.
[2:25:51] And let your voice be heard. He that the
[2:25:53] Son sets free is free indeed. And that
[2:25:57] voice is in the heavens. I heard a voice
[2:26:00] from the heavens. The tabernacle of God
[2:26:03] is with men.
[2:26:07] [Music]
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Everyone pray.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Everyone just break out into prayer.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; Break out into prayer.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; Let your words be heard again.
[2:26:23] Oh, sister Charmaine, in the name of
[2:26:25] Jesus Christ, we cannot add further to
[2:26:28] the words of God. I am the Lord that
[2:26:30] health thee. And the words of our Lord
[2:26:33] Jesus Christ said, rebuke the devil and
[2:26:36] he will flee. Resist the devil and he
[2:26:39] will flee. We speak life into these
[2:26:42] arms. We speak oh God that this
[2:26:45] affliction shall pass from her. We pray,
[2:26:47] oh God, that you will give her the
[2:26:49] medication, a heavenly medication, a
[2:26:52] supernatural medication, a supernatural
[2:26:55] deliverance, a supernatural healing in
[2:26:58] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; For the glory of God, for the glory of
[2:27:04] God, for the glory of God is this arm
[2:27:07] that gives pain. Can you lift this arm?
[2:27:11] Hallelujah.
[2:27:12] Hallelujah.
[2:27:14] Hallelujah.
[2:27:15] Hallelujah.
[2:27:17] Hallelujah.
[2:27:20] For the glory of God. For the glory of
[2:27:23] God. Lord Jesus, restore this arm.
[2:27:27] Restore this body. Restore this lamb. Oh
[2:27:30] God. Give my precious sister her
[2:27:34] inheritance.
[2:27:37] In the finished works of Calvary.
[2:27:40] Oh God, remove distress. I pray. Father
[2:27:45] in the name of Jesus
[2:27:47] and sister Charmaine,
[2:27:51] the great secret is to praise him and to
[2:27:54] thank him and to give glory to God. Let
[2:27:58] your eyes be fixed upon Calvary, the
[2:28:01] finished work of Calvary. Hallelujah.
[2:28:05] Thank you, Lord Jesus. May you receive
[2:28:07] it in Jesus Christ's name for his glory.
[2:28:11] I prayed for this for his glory alone.
[2:28:13] Sister Charmaine.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Virtue of the resurrected Christ.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; I have declared that you're here, Lord.
[2:28:24] And now you will prove it to our sister.
[2:28:27] You'll prove it to our sister in Jesus
[2:28:30] for your glory.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:36] Hallelujah.
[2:28:38] Hallelujah.
[2:28:41] Almighty one. Almighty one.
[2:28:45] Glory. Glory.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory.
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; We praise your name, Lord.
[2:29:00] Thank you for what you're doing and what
[2:29:02] you will continue to do. Bless every
[2:29:04] life, Lord.
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; Bless every man, woman in your presence.
[2:29:09] Father, send them with their hearts full
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; Put a seal upon our lips. Oh God,
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; we speak only those things we desire to
[2:29:20] hear again in your presence.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; In your presence. Thank you, Father.
[2:29:29] In
[2:29:31] in everything we'll give him thanks.
[2:29:36] [Music]
[2:29:55] In everything
[2:29:59] I give you thanks
[2:30:02] I give you thanks.
[2:30:04] I give you thanks to you Lord.
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:27] Give the King of Kings
[2:30:31] all

[2:31:22] with your presence.
[2:31:26] Let your spirit go with each one.
[2:31:28] Father, in the automobiles,
[2:31:31] as the people spend the afternoon,
[2:31:35] may there be a sacred,
[2:31:37] holy, divine presence near them in
[2:31:41] Jesus' name. Amen.
[2:31:45] Gold blood covered ones in the name of
[2:31:48] Jesus Christ. Isn't he lovely?

[2:31:54] evening. Brother Murphy speaking
[2:31:55] tonight, 5:00. You'll want to be here
[2:31:57] and hear what God has put on his heart.
