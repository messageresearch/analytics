[3:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire this morning?
[3:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that song. There is a
[3:31] fountain open in the house of David.
[3:36] There is a fountain
[3:41] open
[3:44] in the house
[3:50] to you.
[3:58] [Applause]
[4:00] And there are streams
[4:04] of grace
[4:07] flowing down

[4:57] from Calary
[5:03] now.
[5:04] [Music]
[5:11] Amen. Amen. And I just have one prayer
[5:14] request this morning. Brother Norm Wood
[5:17] asked that we'd remember his
[5:18] daughter-in-law's mother. She's in the
[5:20] hospital with low blood blood pressure
[5:22] and hemorrhaging. We want to remember
[5:24] her in prayer. We also reme want to
[5:26] remember brother Victor Adamora who's
[5:28] still in Nigeria that God would be with
[5:30] him and lead him as as he's there. We
[5:34] ask brother Tom to come and open the
[5:36] service in a word of prayer this
[5:37] morning. And as he comes, let's sing
[5:39] that chorus. He cares for you. Through
[5:42] sunshine or shadows, he cares for you.
[5:44] And sometimes when I think about this
[5:46] song, I try and sing it almost as a
[5:49] ministry to somebody else. He cares for
[5:52] you. Think about somebody in your heart
[5:54] this morning that's really going through
[5:55] a hard place and minister to them. He
[5:58] carth for you.
[6:03] He
[6:05] carth
[6:07] for you.
[6:13] He
[6:16] cares
[6:17] for you
[6:23] through
[6:26] sunshine
[6:28] and shadows.
[6:33] He
[6:35] car
[6:37] for you.
[6:41] [Music]
[6:42] He
[6:45] cares
[6:46] for you.
[6:49] [Music]
[6:52] He
[6:54] car
[6:56] for you.
[6:59] [Music]
[7:03] Sunshine
[7:05] or shine
[7:08] [Music]
[7:13] caring
[7:15] for you.
[7:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe that he cares for you
[7:19] this morning?
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just hold our hands
[7:22] and our hearts up before the throne of
[7:25] grace?
[7:27] Lord, we know by your word
[7:31] it declares that you'd care for us.
[7:34] You cared for that little widow woman
[7:36] one day, Lord, when Elijah had come by
[7:39] her way. And Lord Jesus, we believe that
[7:42] the word of God has come by our way and
[7:45] that you care for us. And we pray Lord
[7:48] that as we as believers take a hold of
[7:52] the promises that they're yay and amen
[7:55] to them that believe. We know that
[7:58] you're a seeking savior. You know your
[8:00] eye is on the sparrow and I know his eye
[8:04] is watching me. And so Lord, for every
[8:07] hand that's been uplifted and the
[8:09] requests that brother Kim has spoken,
[8:11] Brother Norm has pinned it down on
[8:13] paper. But Lord, before it was pinned
[8:15] down, you knew it. And Lord, that is our
[8:19] consolation this morning that you're an
[8:21] all- knowing God. And you can be touched
[8:23] by the feeling of our infirmity. So we
[8:26] pray, God, you'll meet every need, every
[8:28] burden, every request, Lord, that is
[8:31] raised before the throne of grace this
[8:33] morning. And as we have prayed this
[8:36] morning that you'll anoint the man of
[8:38] God. Would you anoint us to hear what
[8:40] the spirit would say to the church this
[8:43] morning? We don't want to be dull of
[8:45] hearing, Lord. But we want to be quick
[8:47] to hear that you would open our eyes and
[8:49] open our hearts to see the glory of God
[8:52] as it would pass by or away. That we can
[8:54] say, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior.
[8:57] Hear my humble cry this morning." We
[9:00] have needs and we're a needy people.
[9:02] Speak to us deeply within our souls this
[9:05] morning. anointing both speaker and
[9:09] hearer that you'll be glorified amongst
[9:11] us, Lord, for the specials. We pray that
[9:14] you'll anoint it, Lord. And may it be a
[9:16] blessed day in the presence of God as we
[9:20] commit this morning's service to you in
[9:23] Jesus name. Amen.
[9:28] Brother Tom, you may be seated this
[9:30] morning. Amen. Let's sing that uh song.

[9:35] Jesus.

[31:52] Isn't it wonderful to be in his
[31:55] presence?
[31:57] I want to thank the choir for that song.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Sister Natasha, thank you for singing. I
[32:03] asked Sister Natasha to sing that song,
[32:06] The Absolute.
[32:09] We don't have any other absolute.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan is going to be married in a
[32:17] few days and Sister Yolena. Yolena. Hope
[32:21] I'm saying that right.
[32:23] And we can't be there. Brother Ryan and
[32:26] Sister Yolena. Where's Sister Yolena?
[32:30] Over here. Yes. Someone who's going to
[32:33] be a bride. We should have her right
[32:34] down here in front where everybody can
[32:36] see her.
[32:39] They're going to be married in a few
[32:41] days. And I want to just say how much
[32:46] uh we appreciate their lives and brother
[32:50] Ryan's labor of love.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; We appreciate it.
[32:55] [Music]
[32:57] [Applause]
[33:08] And we're wishing both of you, Sister
[33:12] Elena and brother Ryan, God's richest
[33:15] blessings
[33:17] on your marriage.
[33:20] And we're also
[33:22] asking that our Lord Jesus
[33:25] who went to the marriage in Canaa of
[33:28] Galilee
[33:29] may this time go to the marriage in
[33:31] Maui.
[33:34] And I believe it won't make any
[33:36] difference to him whether it's Galilee
[33:37] or Maui.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; May he sanction it. May he sanctify it.
[33:44] And may you have a happy and lovely day
[33:47] and life together. And when you're home,
[33:50] we'll try to make sure that it's that
[33:52] way.
[33:54] We enjoyed the choir and the efforts of
[33:56] all of you who sang. God bless you. It's
[34:00] wonderful to hear people just sing
[34:03] hosana hosana with all their heart and
[34:06] strength and soul. And to all those that
[34:09] are uh connected with us on the internet
[34:13] today, we want to say to that
[34:15] congregation as well because there's so
[34:17] many others, many more than is here.
[34:21] Many more than are here. Probably
[34:23] somewhere between 20 and 30 countries
[34:27] in each service. That's just live
[34:29] streaming. And we don't know how many
[34:32] hundreds more in the uh in the archives
[34:35] that in the very next week. And they're
[34:38] just like you and I. They like to come
[34:40] to church. They want to be there. And so
[34:42] many of them haven't got that
[34:44] opportunity.
[34:46] But today they're we trust that they
[34:49] will be blessed exactly the same as we
[34:51] are. And we wish that they were here.
[34:53] But one day we will be together.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[34:59] [Music]
[35:02] God bless you.
[35:04] [Music]
[35:09] I'm going to have us turn in just a
[35:12] moment to the word, but I uh just to put
[35:15] our minds in in tune with where I want
[35:18] to go today, I just want to sing that
[35:20] chorus. Redeemed, redeemed, redeemed by
[35:23] the blood of the lamb, redeemed,
[35:24] redeemed, his child, and forever I am.
[35:27] Would you help us with
[35:32] redeemed
[35:37] [Music]
[35:38] by the blood of the lamb
[35:43] redee?
[35:46] Redee
[35:49] [Music]
[35:58] redee.
[36:00] redeemed my father.
[36:06] Redee
[36:07] [Music]
[36:13] is high forever. I am.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; We're just rejoicing in it. I'll have
[36:27] you turn in your Bibles to 1 Corinthians
[36:31] uh the 15th chapter
[36:40] and we're going to read just uh
[36:43] three verses there 45 to 47.
[36:49] We've been speaking about
[36:51] great deal about redemption. We spoke a
[36:53] couple of services at least on uh the
[36:56] lamb
[36:58] and the book of redemption.
[37:01] Uh that we spoke on the garden of Eden
[37:04] restored. Of course res restoration is
[37:07] redemption. So it is along the same
[37:09] theme
[37:11] and I would like to uh speak this
[37:14] morning on the mystery of redemption
[37:18] because it's always been mysterious and
[37:21] mysterious in that we don't know and
[37:23] we're in a mystery. We're part of that
[37:25] redemption but we do not know
[37:30] uh and did not expect to be perhaps
[37:32] exactly where we are. We didn't expect
[37:35] our to experience what we've experienced
[37:39] in our lives. And so it's all it can be
[37:42] a mis mystery. It's mysterious. But our
[37:45] confidence is in God
[37:47] &gt;&gt; who has written the book
[37:50] &gt;&gt; from the beginning to the end.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And we are that book. We're not just
[37:55] part of it, but we are the book.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; So, uh I I trust that the scriptures
[38:00] will tie together for you. and you pray
[38:02] for me and we'll pray for one another as
[38:05] we already have.
[38:08] And so it is written. 1 Corinthians
[38:10] 15:45.
[38:13] And so it is written, the first man,
[38:15] Adam, was made a living soul. The last
[38:19] Adam was made a quickening spirit. How
[38:23] be it, that was not first which is
[38:26] spiritual, but that which is natural,
[38:29] and afterward that which is spiritual.
[38:33] The first man is of the earth, earthy,
[38:37] and the second man is the Lord from
[38:39] heaven. Amen.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; I want to say before we read our second
[38:43] scripture, all
[38:47] born again believers that are born again
[38:50] of the Holy Spirit are part of the first
[38:53] and the last Adam.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; We're all part of the first and the last
[38:59] Adam. Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Now in Genesis 1 and 27 we read, "So God
[39:07] created man in his own image. In the
[39:10] image of God created he him.
[39:14] Male and female created he them."
[39:18] So he was a he had a dual personality if
[39:23] you would. He had the attributes of Eve
[39:27] in him. Genesis 2:7.
[39:31] And the Lord God formed man out of the
[39:33] dust of the ground, and he breathed into
[39:36] his nostrils the breath of life, and man
[39:40] became a living soul. And the Lord God
[39:43] planted a garden eastward in Eden, and
[39:47] there he put the man whom he had formed.
[39:51] And I will say to you this morning, and
[39:54] that same God put you here
[39:57] &gt;&gt; and has brought you and allowed you to
[39:59] be in this time, in this season, in this
[40:02] place, in this age, to hear this
[40:05] message,
[40:06] &gt;&gt; not the one I'm preaching, but the
[40:07] message God sent
[40:09] &gt;&gt; by his prophet mouth and which we simply
[40:13] want to uh we simply want to extend that
[40:18] and may God add his blessing to his
[40:20] word. As you have your seats, keep your
[40:22] Bibles open if you would please
[40:25] because I would I I want you not to be
[40:29] distracted by sitting down after we read
[40:31] this next scripture. And it is Matthew
[40:34] 1.
[40:36] And then I want to ask some questions as
[40:38] we just read about three verses here.
[40:43] Matthew the first chapter.
[40:46] And we watch this very close because
[40:49] this will set a tone
[40:53] uh for the service and and bring you
[40:56] right into sharp focus with what I
[40:59] believe God would bring to us.
[41:02] In the 21st verse,
[41:06] this is speaking which a lot of people
[41:08] would have read over Christmas time, but
[41:11] we're not interested in that. This is uh
[41:14] it's always Christmas for us. It's
[41:15] always Easter for us. It's always
[41:17] resurrection
[41:18] and uh we're going to partake in a
[41:20] rapture.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Now, uh 21st verse, and she shall bring
[41:27] forth a son,
[41:29] and thou shalt call his name Jesus.
[41:35] For he shall save his people from their
[41:37] sins.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; And this next verse is a pillar verse
[41:42] for me in the Bible.
[41:46] Now all this was done.
[41:50] Verse 20, verse 18 says, "Now the birth
[41:54] of Jesus Christ was on this wise." So it
[41:57] gives the details of it. And now in 20
[42:01] verse 22, it says, "Now all this all
[42:05] this was done." So I'd like to just stop
[42:08] there and have you look this way for a
[42:10] moment.
[42:12] What was done?
[42:14] What is it that was done?
[42:18] Could I say that a young virgin had been
[42:21] selected out of all humanity? Was that
[42:24] done?
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Would you agree?
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with me that she had a
[42:32] conception?
[42:34] &gt;&gt; That was done.
[42:37] Would you agree
[42:39] that there was a birth,
[42:42] &gt;&gt; an actual birth took place?
[42:46] And I know that you agree, I'm sure that
[42:48] you agree, that this conception was in
[42:52] the womb of a young woman, young woman
[42:57] that had never known a man.
[43:02] You agree?
[43:04] All this was done
[43:08] that it might be fulfilled.
[43:13] A virgin was chosen.
[43:16] A new a new creation
[43:20] began.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that the
[43:25] words of the prophet the words of the
[43:28] prophet lodged in her womb. Amen.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Try to get a hold of that in your mind.
[43:36] The words of the prophet
[43:38] lodged in her womb.
[43:41] So what kind of words are those?
[43:45] What kind of force
[43:48] &gt;&gt; is being spoken out of human lips
[43:52] &gt;&gt; that would that would draw on the
[43:55] eternal power of almighty God and lodge
[43:59] those words in the in a womb of a woman
[44:02] and create a seed
[44:04] &gt;&gt; which would be called the beginning of
[44:07] the new creation of God
[44:11] &gt;&gt; that it might be fulfilled which was
[44:13] spoken of the Lord.
[44:16] not spoken of the Lord by the prophet,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; saying, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive
[44:28] and be with child, and shall bring forth
[44:31] a son, and they shall call his name
[44:34] Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God
[44:37] with us." Amen.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Do you think that Mary, if she began to
[44:43] feel his conception take place and she
[44:46] knew now by the angels visitation that
[44:50] it's it's going to be a boy, she didn't
[44:52] have to have, you know, all the medical
[44:56] apparatus they have today to find out is
[44:58] it a boy, is it a girl. She knew by
[45:02] divine intervention and visitation,
[45:04] you're going to bring forth a son. So
[45:06] she knew that that was a son that she
[45:09] was carrying in her and she's a virgin.
[45:12] She wonders, "How is this going to be?
[45:14] But let it be unto me according to your
[45:17] word and it happened."
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Now I ask you a another question. Was
[45:25] this part of redemption?
[45:29] &gt;&gt; What a part of redemption.
[45:32] She was per a participant in redemption,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; but it was a mystery. Do you think for a
[45:38] moment she realized that this one that's
[45:40] coming forth out of her womb is going to
[45:43] stand before the people and speak words
[45:46] and the people are going to marvel at
[45:48] those words and they would say, "Where
[45:51] has this man learned these letters?
[45:53] Where has he gotten this wisdom? Do you
[45:56] think that she even even passed through
[45:59] her mind that this one that she uh was
[46:02] going to bring forth? Do you think do
[46:04] you think it even even crossed in her
[46:06] wildest imagination that she's going to
[46:08] stand at the foot of a cross and watch
[46:12] this son in the agony of the most cruel
[46:15] death and to see that his phys?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; She never even dreamed of such a thing.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; It never passed through her mind. And
[46:31] that's how mysterious redemption is.
[46:33] Right while redemption, right, while you
[46:36] were being purchased, Mary was standing
[46:39] there, she knew nothing of it and we
[46:42] were being bought.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Do you think it passed through her mind
[46:46] that when the blood that flowed down out
[46:48] of his body and dripped on the earth, do
[46:51] you think for a moment she realized the
[46:54] whole earth was being purchased? Amen.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Do you think for a moment that she
[46:59] realized that Satan himself was being
[47:03] defeated and while the blood was
[47:05] dropping and Jesus was claiming the
[47:07] earth that the serpent's head was being
[47:10] crushed?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; This congregation ought to be able to
[47:16] rejoice.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Redemption. The mystery of redemption.
[47:22] And it goes on today. And you're part of
[47:25] that mystery. You're part of that
[47:27] redemption. Who ever dreamed that this
[47:30] would that it was going to be this way?
[47:32] And God is going to send a messenger in
[47:34] this end time and speak certain words.
[47:37] And those words are going to be just as
[47:39] creative as the words that created Jesus
[47:42] Christ.
[47:44] Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Just as creative,
[47:53] &gt;&gt; a virgin then and a virgin now.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; And she was a virgin. And the word that
[48:04] she received
[48:06] brought forth a son, as I said last
[48:10] Sunday, that would never take a wife,
[48:12] but would bring forth many more
[48:14] children.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; She was a virgin and received a seed.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; We receive a seed and become a virgin.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of life you've
[48:30] had. I don't care what you've
[48:31] experienced. This word
[48:34] &gt;&gt; by this prophet
[48:36] &gt;&gt; will turn you back
[48:38] &gt;&gt; into a virgin sinless state.
[48:42] [Music]
[48:45] &gt;&gt; The only thing that has separated
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; mankind within the within the human
[48:53] community.
[48:54] The only thing that has separated man is
[48:58] just one thing only one thing. religion.
[49:02] The world's full of it.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; We say, "Well, there's violent religions
[49:06] and there's uh religions of apathy and
[49:10] religions that are meaningless and
[49:11] religions that are empty." I have
[49:14] nothing to say uh one way or another
[49:17] about religion. I will say this, there's
[49:19] only one thing that separates all
[49:22] humanity. There's one significant thing
[49:25] and that is the people.
[49:29] those that have something in them that
[49:34] is far far more meaningful and has far
[49:39] more influence on them than anything
[49:42] even in their intelligence. It is a seed
[49:45] that God's prophet has called a
[49:47] predestinated seed way down in there.
[49:51] Somehow this God who could bring forth a
[49:54] man from a virgin, he has put a seed in
[49:57] you that would cause you to hear the
[50:00] word, the same God speaking through
[50:03] another prophet's mouth that will turn
[50:05] you back to a virgin condition.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; What can wash away my sin? Nothing but
[50:13] the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[50:16] What can make me whole again? Nothing
[50:19] but the blood of Jesus Christ. And the
[50:21] life that came from that blood, the
[50:23] spirit fell upon the church. And out of
[50:25] the church was raised apostles,
[50:27] prophets, pastors, teachers, and
[50:29] evangelists. And then God has selected
[50:32] certain ones that would be messengers to
[50:34] the age, to the church age, to the
[50:36] Ephesian age, the Philadelphiaian age,
[50:38] the Sardisian age, Thotyron age, and all
[50:41] of these different ages. in Leodysa.
[50:43] Thank God one came to this dark age
[50:47] &gt;&gt; with a word of light,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; with a word of power,
[50:51] &gt;&gt; with a word that can restore you back.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want to hear that kind of
[50:56] news?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Who wants to live in this world with all
[51:01] of its atrocities,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; injustices, and you think it's ever
[51:06] going to get better? Never. It's sinking
[51:08] into a hopeless spiral
[51:11] &gt;&gt; downward and downward and ever downward.
[51:13] And it finally ends up in a in in a
[51:16] state of judgment in hell.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And God's going to cleanse it and
[51:20] renovate it to make it a fit place.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; For his children, his people.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; All right. That's the part
[51:34] part of the mystery of redemption. Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I doubt if there's anyone here that
[51:44] realized when God first laid his hand on
[51:47] you
[51:50] and called you into this word.
[51:54] I doubt if any of you ever dreamed that
[51:58] you'd experience what you've experienced
[52:01] or what you're experiencing now or what
[52:04] we have experienced
[52:06] as a we would never have dreamed that
[52:08] say what should I do don't do anything
[52:13] what was what was Mary to do
[52:16] &gt;&gt; she found herself it it had nothing to
[52:18] do with her it had everything to do with
[52:20] God and and and and things that were
[52:23] simply happening and taking place. I'm
[52:26] sure that there isn't a person here, but
[52:28] what God has allowed you to experience
[52:31] things in your life that you didn't ask
[52:33] for. You didn't plan. You didn't
[52:36] program. You didn't make any you didn't
[52:39] make any preparations for it. It just
[52:41] happened. It just came. It just
[52:43] happened. And you you might say, "Why
[52:45] did this happen in my life?" Or why am I
[52:47] going through this or whatever more?
[52:49] We've had all kinds of things in the
[52:51] individual lives that and there isn't
[52:53] any uh I wouldn't be able to make any uh
[52:56] scenario that would fit everybody. But
[52:59] we all could say that we have
[53:01] experienced those things and we say what
[53:04] should I do? Well, just do one thing.
[53:07] Believe what he has said
[53:10] &gt;&gt; and live by what he has said.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; That is my admonishment to you. That's
[53:16] my counsel to you because that is what
[53:18] separates the believer from the
[53:20] unbeliever, the believer from the
[53:22] makebeliever is believing everything
[53:25] that he said.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; This is not a message smores board
[53:29] &gt;&gt; where we just go and say, "Well, I like
[53:31] this and I like that, but I don't like
[53:32] that and I like that." That's not what
[53:34] it is. When the Passover lamb was
[53:37] sacrificed, they had to eat the lamb. It
[53:39] wasn't just the roast. It wasn't the
[53:41] tenderloin. It was the internal parts
[53:44] and every part, the bitter herbs and all
[53:46] the rest of it was all part of
[53:48] redemption.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; So we have bitter things in our lives.
[53:53] It's part of redemption.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; We have things that are mysterious to
[53:57] us. It's part of redemption. Just stand
[54:00] steadfast. Stand where God has planted
[54:03] your feet. Remain there. Be resolved.
[54:06] This is the direction that God has sent
[54:08] me. This is the word that I believe and
[54:11] nothing can change that.
[54:14] [Music]
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Just a few perhaps thoughts that I had
[54:25] brought to you in the last two three
[54:27] weeks or so
[54:29] concerning redemption.
[54:32] I mentioned to you that from within the
[54:34] first creation,
[54:37] it was a perfect creation. God had
[54:39] already looked on and he said, "It's
[54:41] good. It's very good." But in the midst
[54:44] of that creation, I review this because
[54:45] some of you perhaps weren't here and
[54:47] others that were here. It's good to
[54:49] review it again. But part of that
[54:51] creation,
[54:53] although it was perfect, God, the Bible
[54:55] says God planted afterward, afterward
[54:58] God planted a garden.
[55:01] And that garden was a place for seed
[55:04] because in the midst of that garden was
[55:06] his seed, the tree of life, which was
[55:09] Christ.
[55:11] And he brings forth a man. He's already
[55:13] brought forth. And that's why I read the
[55:15] scripture, the first man. The first man,
[55:18] the first man, Adam was a was actually
[55:20] created in the image of God in the first
[55:23] instance. Created in the image of God,
[55:27] but within him, within that creation
[55:31] was a woman,
[55:33] was a wife and she would be his garden.
[55:38] And God brought her forth out from him.
[55:41] The same as he planted a garden in the
[55:43] creation. Now he has a creation of a man
[55:46] in his image who is reflecting him. Now
[55:49] I haven't spoken that part before. Adam
[55:52] is the son of God reflecting God. God is
[55:56] a God of all
[55:58] creation. God is a God of all the
[56:01] universe. God is God. There is none
[56:03] other beside him. But now God has a son
[56:06] and he gives him the dominion. Have
[56:09] dominion over this earth and over this
[56:12] creation. name the animals and speak the
[56:15] word and do whatever uh you are led to
[56:19] do. And he said that he the prophet of
[56:21] God said he led the animals as as the
[56:24] Holy Spirit leads the church today. What
[56:27] uh what a man this first Adam was. But
[56:31] he was reflecting God on the earth. He
[56:34] was a reflection of God because every
[56:36] son is a reflection of his father.
[56:39] And in God his attributes in God is
[56:44] seed. In Adam was seed.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; And now God brings forth Adam and from
[56:51] Adam brings forth Eve. And she's a place
[56:55] where his seeds are planted. And before
[56:59] he got there, because Satan, now hang on
[57:02] to this because I'm going to come back
[57:04] to it. Satan cannot create. He can only
[57:08] pervert what has been created.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; He is not a creator. And in fact, as the
[57:14] prophet of God in instructed us that he
[57:17] was co-equal with God and only only in
[57:22] creation, that's why that's why Isaiah
[57:24] speaks of I'll ascend. I'll ascend to
[57:27] the stars of God. I'll ascend to the
[57:29] mount of God because there was something
[57:31] that he couldn't yet do and it was
[57:33] creation that he couldn't do. So, he
[57:35] comes down in Eden. Why didn't he come
[57:38] before? And you've heard me say this
[57:40] many times. Satan was cast to the earth
[57:43] because of his disobedience. Because
[57:45] iniquity was found in his heart.
[57:48] Why did he why did he arrive in Eden?
[57:52] Just the garden.
[57:54] It wasn't just creation. It wasn't just
[57:57] at the time when the creation was done
[57:59] that Lucifer was found. But he comes to
[58:02] Eden. Why does he come to Eden? Because
[58:05] it's a place of seed sowing
[58:09] &gt;&gt; and he can't create he can't create a
[58:12] serpent. And this upright being this
[58:14] very fine being who had been cast out.
[58:17] Serpent wasn't a snake, folks.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The serpent wasn't a snake. He was cast
[58:22] down. God God completely destroyed the
[58:26] whole structure of his body.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; He was cast down. The Bible says above
[58:30] all the animals. So he was above them.
[58:32] You can't be cast down below them if you
[58:34] weren't above them.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; So, he was cast down lower than all the
[58:37] animals because he was above them. He
[58:39] was a creature. Hey, he was a creature
[58:42] God talked to.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; He was a creature that could speak back.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; He was a creature that knew what God
[58:49] said.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Hath God said? He was a
[58:54] extremely intelligent and perhaps even
[58:57] finer looking physically than Adam
[59:00] himself? We do not know. But he spoke to
[59:03] Eve. He enticed Eve. He beguiled her
[59:06] through his subility. He had seed
[59:10] &gt;&gt; and the people looked for a missing link
[59:12] and that was him.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Because that is the one that God cursed
[59:16] out of existence.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Science looks for the missing link.
[59:20] There's some missing link. There's some
[59:21] link between human and animal because
[59:24] they know that man is an animal, a
[59:25] mammal in that sense of the word. But he
[59:29] was cursed out of existence and they'll
[59:31] never find him.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; God changed his entire structure. But
[59:36] prior to that, Satan took a hold of that
[59:38] instrument. He couldn't create him, but
[59:40] he could pervert him. and he took it and
[59:43] swed his seed in the garden of Eve
[59:49] &gt;&gt; and brought forth a Cain
[59:52] &gt;&gt; who would stand in the face of God and
[59:54] lie in the face of God and speak and
[59:56] rebel in the face of God. Think what
[59:58] kind of uh uh you talk about two vines
[1:00:02] there they start
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; man who had murder in his heart.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:00:09] So when God, the prophet said in the
[1:00:12] cruelty of sin. So when God made his
[1:00:14] first man, I gave you this quote before
[1:00:16] he was a spirit man. He was something on
[1:00:19] the order of God or the son of God, the
[1:00:22] logos. That was the first man. Then he
[1:00:26] gave the man jurisdiction over to lead
[1:00:29] all the animal life just like the Holy
[1:00:32] Spirit leads the believer today.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] And out of Adam he said, Because thou
[1:00:40] hast hearkened unto the voice of thy
[1:00:43] wife, and hast eaten of the tree of
[1:00:46] which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
[1:00:48] shalt not eat of it. Cursed is the
[1:00:51] ground for thy sake. In sorrow shalt
[1:00:54] thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] Therefore, Genesis 3:23, therefore the
[1:01:02] Lord God sent him forth from the Garden
[1:01:07] of Eden to till the ground.
[1:01:11] This is really striking
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:17] very sad.
[1:01:20] And God sent him forth from the garden.
[1:01:23] I I don't want to take the time, but
[1:01:24] when you think of a God that had the
[1:01:26] capacity to feel what our God, the love
[1:01:30] that he had for the world and for the
[1:01:33] earth and for the he loves his creation
[1:01:36] and his son, how he must have just had
[1:01:40] such an intense
[1:01:42] love upon his son and now his son's
[1:01:45] bride
[1:01:47] and now he had put them in this garden
[1:01:49] and now he's driving them boat
[1:01:52] and he sent the fourth out of the garden
[1:01:54] to till the ground. Go to work.
[1:01:58] I had put you here just to tend to the
[1:02:00] garden to keep it and to dress it. Go
[1:02:02] out now to work amongst the thorns and
[1:02:06] the thistles and the storms and
[1:02:07] everything that will come. And so he
[1:02:10] drove the man out. Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; He drove out the man and he placed at
[1:02:16] the east of the garden of Eden
[1:02:17] cherubams,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; angels and a flaming sword. Now another
[1:02:23] dimension comes into existence. Now it's
[1:02:26] not just uh the things that are there
[1:02:29] physically in the creation. But now
[1:02:31] there's another dimension that is
[1:02:32] introduced and that's cherubams. Angels
[1:02:35] are going to be uh east of Eden. uh
[1:02:40] cherubams and a flaming sword which
[1:02:42] turned every way to keep the way of the
[1:02:46] tree of life. And the prophet said Jesus
[1:02:48] when he came then he said I'm the way.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He was the one that was being kept the
[1:02:54] way. It wasn't they weren't protecting
[1:02:56] Jesus. They weren't protecting the tree
[1:02:57] of life. They were protecting the way of
[1:03:00] the tree of life. Uh Adam lost his way.
[1:03:04] Now he didn't know. He didn't have the
[1:03:06] same range of intelligence he had just
[1:03:09] prior to this. Now he's reduced. He's
[1:03:11] he's fallen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; He's a fallen man. And they don't know
[1:03:15] what to do. Things are happening. Soon
[1:03:18] they have murder on their hands and
[1:03:20] they've got bloodshed and they've got
[1:03:22] hatred and they have everything. And he
[1:03:24] lives all these years, centuries of
[1:03:26] years. I think 930 years Adam lived or
[1:03:29] 950 right up in there. and and and now
[1:03:33] he's been driven out of the garden of
[1:03:36] Eden.
[1:03:41] Now there was a need for redemption.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Now, now there was a need for
[1:03:47] redemption.
[1:03:49] And brother Brandham said, "Adam,
[1:03:52] he could not meet the requirements of
[1:03:54] redemption.
[1:03:56] He found after he found he lost it.
[1:04:01] You know,
[1:04:03] I I know what it's about a little bit.
[1:04:06] When you're as time passes and those of
[1:04:10] you that have a few years, those of you
[1:04:12] that young, I have news for you.
[1:04:14] There'll be a time when you won't be
[1:04:15] able to do quite what you used to do
[1:04:17] before.
[1:04:20] I used to work for a fellow. I was I was
[1:04:23] 15 years old. And I was on a farm and
[1:04:27] the old fella, he was a bachelor and he
[1:04:29] had two brothers. They were all
[1:04:30] bachelors. They came from Ireland. They
[1:04:32] all came became wealthy and he had so
[1:04:34] much land. He didn't know how much land.
[1:04:36] He didn't know how many head of cattle
[1:04:37] he had. He didn't know how many horses.
[1:04:39] They were just out there producing year
[1:04:41] after year after year. And he had broke
[1:04:43] horses and rode horses and and got
[1:04:46] bucked off of horses until he was kind
[1:04:48] of bent over and around, you
[1:04:51] know, and he he would try and encourage
[1:04:54] us younger fellas to do different
[1:04:55] things.
[1:04:58] Oh, it was a case. He was a case. And
[1:05:02] and then he'd talk on into the night. We
[1:05:04] had to stop answering him or he'd just
[1:05:06] keep talking. And they were in this old
[1:05:08] log house of his and dark and you know
[1:05:12] bunk house type of a house and and just
[1:05:14] live like bachelors. I mean you know
[1:05:17] let's say no more.
[1:05:20] And I'd lay on this cot and listen to
[1:05:22] him go on and on. He'd talk about this
[1:05:24] story and that story and these horses he
[1:05:26] had and these he sold and these he broke
[1:05:30] and everyone every time he'd tell a
[1:05:32] story about these horses, you know, cuz
[1:05:34] he had hundreds of them and he'd talk
[1:05:36] about one and he broke this horse and
[1:05:39] there he was all crippled up and his
[1:05:40] legs all stiff and he says, "And I can
[1:05:42] still do it.
[1:05:44] I can still do it." And I think in his
[1:05:46] mind he thought he could still do it. So
[1:05:48] we'd say to him, you know, and I've
[1:05:50] thought quite a bit about this because
[1:05:52] now I'm at a place where I can't really
[1:05:53] do everything I used to do. And and so I
[1:05:56] I still inside I still think I can still
[1:05:58] do it.
[1:06:02] You know, I guess some of these things
[1:06:03] are humorous, but my wife says, she says
[1:06:06] to me, I need the top of the, you know,
[1:06:09] the fan. I need the top of it dusted
[1:06:12] off. So I said, okay, get a rag, you
[1:06:16] know.
[1:06:17] So this is nothing. I'm just going to
[1:06:19] get up here and do this. This is this is
[1:06:21] just a piece of cake. So I start getting
[1:06:24] up there and even her words to me now be
[1:06:26] careful.
[1:06:28] So that kind of put a caution on me.
[1:06:31] Maybe this isn't as easy as I thought.
[1:06:33] You know, you get in a chair and you
[1:06:34] start to jiggle a wee bit. I thought
[1:06:36] this is ridiculous. I can do this, but
[1:06:38] you know, you find out you got to just
[1:06:40] be a little bit more careful. And I got
[1:06:42] thinking of old Joe Clark. I I can still
[1:06:44] do it. He was all crippled up. So, you
[1:06:47] know what we'd say? Well, well, we got
[1:06:48] some horses out here, Joe. Let Why don't
[1:06:51] we do it? Go out there and break them.
[1:06:54] But, you know, he never took us up
[1:06:57] because deep, deep, deep, deep down, I
[1:07:00] thought he knew he still couldn't do it.
[1:07:02] He had finally arrived there.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; And you know what? It kind of dawns on
[1:07:06] you.
[1:07:09] I I I can I can't quite do it.
[1:07:14] Adam. That's what I believe it was with
[1:07:15] Adam. He began to realize he couldn't
[1:07:18] quite do it. He thought, "I should be
[1:07:22] able to handle this. Why aren't these
[1:07:24] animals listening to me? Why isn't I'm
[1:07:27] speaking to this tree? Why isn't it
[1:07:28] doing what it did before? How come I
[1:07:32] don't have that same power?" I think the
[1:07:33] same thing happened with Samson because
[1:07:36] the Bible says he wished not
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; that the spirit of God had left him. And
[1:07:41] so, friends, when the spirit of God
[1:07:44] lifts, people don't stop worshiping.
[1:07:46] They don't stop having church. And
[1:07:48] brother Baron says after the bride is
[1:07:50] gone,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; they'll still have church
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; and they'll still have altar calls and
[1:07:56] people will come and think they're
[1:07:58] getting saved.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hey, you have a whole nation over there
[1:08:06] called Israel. They don't believe that
[1:08:08] Jesus came.
[1:08:11] They don't believe he died for the sins
[1:08:13] of the world. They don't believe he was
[1:08:14] virgin born. They don't believe any of
[1:08:16] this that you and I believe. They don't
[1:08:18] believe the New Testament. They don't
[1:08:19] have the New Testament. They can read
[1:08:21] it, but they don't believe it.
[1:08:23] And if you went over there and said,
[1:08:25] "You're lost.
[1:08:27] You think they believe you?" No. We
[1:08:29] know, of course, they're blinded,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; but if you went over there and said,
[1:08:33] "You're blinded so we could come in."
[1:08:35] They'd say, "Get out of here.
[1:08:38] We don't have anything to we we don't
[1:08:40] want to hear that. So they have lost
[1:08:42] something,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; but they don't realize it.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; And so here's what happened. And he
[1:08:50] sinned and he separated himself from
[1:08:52] God. And I love these words even though
[1:08:55] they're sad. And the prophet says they
[1:08:58] separated themselves. He separated
[1:08:59] himself from God. Was on this side of
[1:09:02] the chasm. Brother Brandham was saying
[1:09:05] he was on this side of the chasm here in
[1:09:08] this life.
[1:09:10] Oh friends,
[1:09:13] I hope I'm able to convey myself to you.
[1:09:17] I'm so glad that he came through
[1:09:21] redemption
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; and bridged away to the other side of
[1:09:24] the chasm.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I don't I have no intention on staying
[1:09:28] on this human side of the chasm. We have
[1:09:32] believed now in a supernatural. But Adam
[1:09:35] found himself on this side of the chasm
[1:09:38] and it was a chasm.
[1:09:41] So he could not redeem it. It took
[1:09:44] redemption to reach the other side. He
[1:09:46] just couldn't do it because he needed
[1:09:48] redemption himself.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; How could he redeem when he needed
[1:09:52] redemption himself? in the restoration
[1:09:55] of the bride tree.
[1:09:57] Speaking of Christ, he was God's prophet
[1:10:00] tree.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; I love the language because it it fits
[1:10:04] so much in what I've been ministering.
[1:10:07] He preached all the perfect word of God.
[1:10:09] For he was the word of God made
[1:10:12] manifest. He was the perfect prophet
[1:10:14] tree that preached the perfect prophet
[1:10:16] word that brought forth the perfect
[1:10:19] prophet fruit by the perfect word of
[1:10:22] God. Did you ever hear such things as
[1:10:24] that? He was a perfect prophet tree. He
[1:10:27] was a tree who spoke the perfect prophet
[1:10:30] word and brought forth the perfect
[1:10:32] prophet fruit by the perfect word of
[1:10:35] God. Thank God for Isaiah one day who
[1:10:39] cried out, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:10:41] conceive." And that perfect prophet word
[1:10:44] brought forth a perfect prophet fruit.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Called the son of the living God. Yes,
[1:10:51] sir.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? I'm sure you are.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; And now the prophet of God in this
[1:10:56] generation, he's he's he's tying back.
[1:10:59] He's putting his anchor back there and
[1:11:02] he's bringing it forward to this day
[1:11:04] because he knows that it's not him. He
[1:11:08] knows it's the same God speaking through
[1:11:11] his lips. That's why he could say so
[1:11:13] many times, not me speaking. That's my
[1:11:15] voice, but that's not me speaking. I
[1:11:18] don't know what I said, but that was him
[1:11:20] speaking. You can hear it. That happened
[1:11:22] in our time. I say to you, do you
[1:11:24] believe that's the truth? Do you believe
[1:11:26] that was God speaking? Do you believe it
[1:11:29] was God taking this word that the world
[1:11:31] is so confused over and speaking it so
[1:11:34] you could understand it and speaking it
[1:11:36] so you could have a revelation? I say,
[1:11:38] open up your ears, open up your heart,
[1:11:41] open up your mind, and yield to the Holy
[1:11:44] Spirit.
[1:11:46] Exactly.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; God's perfect prophet word
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; to bring forth a perfect prophet fruit.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Not fruit of a denomination, not fruit
[1:11:56] of a church, not a fruit of a man's
[1:11:58] idea, but I want to bring forth and you
[1:12:00] must bring forth fruit of thus sayaith
[1:12:03] the Lord.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Thus saith the Lord. That's what
[1:12:08] separates all humanity.
[1:12:12] Glory to God.
[1:12:14] He said, "Oh, brother, what a tree."
[1:12:17] He was that life tree that the angel
[1:12:21] kept Eve and Adam away from
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; with the guarding cherubams away from
[1:12:26] that tree. Now the same cherubams
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; the same cherubams
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; is trying to run them into it
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; because there's been a way made for
[1:12:44] them.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; He's making an announcement. He's an
[1:12:47] announcement messenger. He's an
[1:12:48] announcement prophet. This that you have
[1:12:50] read about. It is now here present.
[1:12:53] There has been a way already made a way
[1:12:56] for them. Prior to that, perhaps there
[1:12:58] wasn't a way like there is now across
[1:13:01] the chasm. There's a way.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And you that have crossed the chasm and
[1:13:08] crossed this uh marvelous bridge from
[1:13:12] humanity
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; to eternity.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. friends
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; my holding myself back
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; because there's been a way made in
[1:13:24] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[1:13:26] said he's that seed the woman's seed the
[1:13:30] tree of life in the garden he's all of
[1:13:33] those he's the seed the woman's seed
[1:13:36] what was in Eve
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; what was in uh Mary was in Eden
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; you see it's just different layers of
[1:13:43] the same thing he's a tree there he's a
[1:13:45] child here. He's a man here. He's a king
[1:13:48] of kings. He's a lord of lords. He's all
[1:13:51] of that. It's the same one.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; We We don't have a whole uh myriad of
[1:13:58] gods. We have one God.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Manifested
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world
[1:14:06] to himself, redeeming you and I. The
[1:14:09] same God.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; He's the woman's seed. Amen.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; He's the tree in the garden.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And unless they put forth their hands
[1:14:19] and and and move this tree, they'd eat
[1:14:22] that tree and live forever. And he's the
[1:14:25] only tree that can be taken that you can
[1:14:28] live forever.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; He's the only tree. And he's the word.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; He's the word.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; He's He's only He's not just words. He
[1:14:38] is the word.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And the word is this. Listen, friends,
[1:14:43] it's so simple.
[1:14:45] Even while a prophet of God, while all
[1:14:47] the messengers were here, while Apostle
[1:14:49] Paul was here, while Jesus was here,
[1:14:52] there is one distinction between them
[1:14:54] all and the rest of humanity. And that
[1:14:56] is this. When they spoke, God moved in
[1:14:59] behind it and performed vindicated their
[1:15:03] words by the supernatural taking place.
[1:15:09] I just read uh and and brother Brandon
[1:15:12] was preaching early in the 1950s
[1:15:15] in Eerie, Pennsylvania.
[1:15:19] It's Eeries, Pennsylvania. Is that
[1:15:20] right?
[1:15:23] He m he he go he makes in one paragraph
[1:15:27] it would just absolutely stun any
[1:15:30] scientist's word any sci scientist's
[1:15:32] mind or any medical mind or any
[1:15:35] religious mind he was just so far out
[1:15:38] there and letting the people know
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; that this is no more history
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; this same God that you believed in I'll
[1:15:46] prove to you he's here right now
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; what what kind of a a vessel is that he
[1:15:52] have such absolute assurance that that
[1:15:54] God is going to move on the scene in the
[1:15:57] next few moments and prove that what
[1:16:00] he's saying is absolutely the truth.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Friends, here I stand here today with
[1:16:05] you joining hearttoheart and saying this
[1:16:09] messenger we believe.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; This word we believe.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; And that's what separates humanity.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; And that's all you're called on to do.
[1:16:20] Believe it.
[1:16:21] Yes, sir.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; You're not even called on to produce
[1:16:25] certain things. The word itself will
[1:16:28] produce it.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He said he was put on a tree of
[1:16:36] disgrace.
[1:16:37] Cursed is he that hung on a tree
[1:16:41] became a curse for the human race.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And now through that he brings forth a
[1:16:48] bride tree.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who ever dreamed? Did Mary
[1:16:52] think while she stood at the foot of the
[1:16:54] cross, "Oh, how wonderful. A bride tree
[1:16:56] is coming forth."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Did she think for a moment, humanity is
[1:17:02] being redeemed?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Did anyone, even the prophets, the most
[1:17:08] holy and the most righteous, or the
[1:17:10] disciples that have been called, do you
[1:17:12] think anyone even realized this is God's
[1:17:16] rest?
[1:17:19] God rested on the seventh day. His work
[1:17:22] was finished.
[1:17:25] But he left the law. Says, "The day you
[1:17:27] eat thereof, that day you die."
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And he put a judgment on the earth and a
[1:17:33] curse on the earth.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Can you comprehend with me? Do you think
[1:17:39] Mary compre? Do you think we comprehend
[1:17:41] it that as she stood there, here's a
[1:17:43] rugged tree, here's blood, here's two
[1:17:46] other male factors, here's the people,
[1:17:48] and they're wagging their head and
[1:17:50] they're saying, "Ah, come down from the
[1:17:53] cross. You that said, uh, I I will
[1:17:56] destroy the temple and raise it up in
[1:17:58] three days. Do that and we'll believe.
[1:18:00] Come down from the cross and we'll
[1:18:02] believe." And and both of the male
[1:18:04] factors and I believe it was brother Tom
[1:18:06] was mentioning that only one of them he
[1:18:08] saw something different but both of them
[1:18:10] were railing on him. The Bible says
[1:18:12] railing on him. Do something. You're a
[1:18:15] miracle worker. Bring us down. Come down
[1:18:17] from the cross and bring us down.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Do you think they thought for a moment?
[1:18:22] Do you think anybody realized
[1:18:25] that the judgment of God
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; was being satisfied?
[1:18:33] the justice of all a holy righteous
[1:18:37] creator. His justice was being
[1:18:40] satisfied. Do you think for a moment
[1:18:42] that they could realize no one who
[1:18:45] believes on him will ever have to suffer
[1:18:48] a penalty of sin? The whole penalty is
[1:18:52] being paid now. The justice of God is
[1:18:55] being paid now. And God entered into his
[1:18:58] rest.
[1:19:02] And if God could enter into his rest
[1:19:04] with that work, surely you and I can
[1:19:07] enter into that rest.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Say, "Satan puts guilt on your mind.
[1:19:12] Satan brings condemnation on your mind.
[1:19:14] You deny him. He has no right to do it.
[1:19:18] If you're called of the Holy Spirit, God
[1:19:21] and Jesus Christ died for you, paid the
[1:19:24] penalty for you, completely paid the
[1:19:26] penalty, and you are not you're not only
[1:19:28] free, you're guiltless.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; What a tree.
[1:19:45] He said through the woman in natural
[1:19:48] birth we die
[1:19:51] but through the man
[1:19:54] the man
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; we live
[1:19:58] such powerful things you won't hear this
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; where else will you hear such statements
[1:20:05] through the woman we die
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; through your mother he said we die.
[1:20:11] There isn't a human that comes by a
[1:20:13] sexual natural birth, but what you are
[1:20:16] destined to die
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; if the nature of your birth destines you
[1:20:22] to a death.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; But now comes another voice.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Now comes another word.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; The same the same God who spoke through
[1:20:33] Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[1:20:35] And those words anchored in her womb.
[1:20:38] And they anchored in her womb for the
[1:20:40] express purpose for the express purpose
[1:20:42] of fulfilling that prophet's words
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; because they were not the words of a
[1:20:48] man. They were the words of God.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And you get this settled in your heart.
[1:20:52] When you read the messages, when you
[1:20:54] hear it, it will have a completely
[1:20:56] different connotation to you. You read
[1:20:59] it, you'll realize this is not a man
[1:21:01] speaking. A man couldn't say these kind
[1:21:03] of things. This is almighty God. And
[1:21:06] whether it has happened or it's going to
[1:21:08] happen, it certainly will happen because
[1:21:11] God word will never fail.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; All that lived by the woman die.
[1:21:22] All that's born by the man lives.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; All that comes by the woman in natural
[1:21:28] is natural. All that comes from the man
[1:21:30] is spiritual. Not the man here but the
[1:21:33] man Christ Jesus.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; So I said we all are part of the first
[1:21:40] Adam and the last Adam.
[1:21:43] You have been sown.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; In this earth
[1:21:48] we are we have different backgrounds,
[1:21:52] different ethnic groups. We're very
[1:21:56] multicultural.
[1:21:58] We are we have different cultures.
[1:22:01] We have learned different languages.
[1:22:06] We have different ways of doing things.
[1:22:08] We are made up different. Some love
[1:22:10] mountains, some love prairie, some love
[1:22:13] sunshine. I hope you all love rain.
[1:22:18] Anyway, that's what we have.
[1:22:21] And we we we're very very different. And
[1:22:24] we like things. And we like different
[1:22:26] kinds of foods. And you like food I
[1:22:28] can't stand. and I perhaps eat food you
[1:22:30] can't stand. And and we're all very very
[1:22:32] different. As long as we have one thing
[1:22:35] in common,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; we have the same intense love
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; for God's word.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; What God spoke.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; And we have that in common. And we're
[1:22:47] all on common ground.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; There are seven names of God.
[1:22:58] I have a list. I don't have it here. I
[1:23:00] have it in another file,
[1:23:02] but I have 100 names for Jesus Christ.
[1:23:09] It's unbelievable.
[1:23:11] And quite frankly, there's more names
[1:23:14] for Satan than perhaps you realize. It
[1:23:17] would shock you.
[1:23:19] the devil, Satan, Lucifer, the
[1:23:23] adversary, all these names. There's a
[1:23:26] whole string of them, perhaps 50 or
[1:23:28] more,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; but there's a hundred for Jesus Christ.
[1:23:33] At least a hundred and perhaps more.
[1:23:35] That's marvelous. And the amazing thing
[1:23:38] is the the same Bible that gives those
[1:23:42] titles to him gives almost the same ones
[1:23:47] to you as the bride of Jesus Christ, the
[1:23:50] body of Jesus Christ, the spotless one,
[1:23:53] the the great host without number. It
[1:23:55] goes on and on and on. We have so many.
[1:23:59] But there are seven and the brother
[1:24:01] Brandham calls them the seven redemptive
[1:24:04] names of Jehovah.
[1:24:07] And I think of this now in terms of
[1:24:08] redemption. Redeemed. Redeemed. Oh, I
[1:24:10] love to proclaim it in terms of
[1:24:12] redemption. Friends,
[1:24:14] if we don't participate in redemption,
[1:24:17] we're on the wrong side of the chasm.
[1:24:20] And if there's anyone here, the greatest
[1:24:22] thing we could do as a congregation
[1:24:23] today would be to invite somebody who's
[1:24:26] on the other side of the chasm. Come
[1:24:28] over here.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; There has been a way made for you. Don't
[1:24:34] stay there where there's sure
[1:24:36] destruction and sure darkness. Don't
[1:24:39] stay there.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, do you mind me lifting my voice
[1:24:42] and crying out?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Come over to this side of the chasm.
[1:24:47] [Applause]
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; There's no tree of life over there.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; There's no eternal life over there.
[1:24:57] Don't stay there.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Look at the world you live in. Look at
[1:25:00] the people you have to rub shoulders
[1:25:02] with. Look at the things the people
[1:25:04] humanity feeds on. Do you want that to
[1:25:06] be your diet? Do you want that to be
[1:25:08] your future? I say no. No, no. If you're
[1:25:11] a seed of God, there's something in here
[1:25:13] that's calling out
[1:25:16] [Music]
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; seven re redemptive names. Jehovah.
[1:25:26] He's Jehovah Gyra.
[1:25:29] The Lord will provide. And brother
[1:25:31] Brandham says, "The Lord will provide a
[1:25:33] sacrifice."
[1:25:35] And after each one of these, I want the
[1:25:37] congregation to say, "Redemption."
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Rafa. Think about this now.
[1:25:48] The Lord that healeth thee.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[1:25:53] He's Jehovah Nissi, the Lord our banner.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; He is Jehovah Shalom,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; the Lord our peace.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Raha, the Lord my shepherd.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[1:26:13] He's Jehovah Sidkanu, the Lord our
[1:26:16] righteousness.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Redemption. And he's Jehovah Shama. The
[1:26:22] Lord is present.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Redemption.
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gave those in a message
[1:26:34] and he said, "I want to take the first
[1:26:36] one and the last one."
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I want to speak on the
[1:26:40] last one."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, that was his that was his message.
[1:26:44] That was what he was sent to the earth
[1:26:46] to say. the last of the seven uh
[1:26:49] descriptive names of Jesus in in
[1:26:51] Revelation the first chapter. He saw his
[1:26:54] eyes and his garment and his hair and
[1:26:57] his eyes as a flame of fire and his his
[1:27:00] hair glistening white and his garment
[1:27:03] glistening and his feet as brass that
[1:27:05] burned in the furnace. But the last
[1:27:08] description of him was his countenance,
[1:27:10] his face. Because when the Bible speaks
[1:27:13] of his face or the face of a person,
[1:27:16] he's present
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and you're looking at each other.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; It's not a crowd you're looking at, but
[1:27:21] you're right together and you're looking
[1:27:22] right in his face. His ministry was to
[1:27:25] bring you face to face.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; His ministry was to speak about Jehovah
[1:27:30] Shyama.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; The Lord is present.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; He's not 150 million light years up in
[1:27:37] space. He's not in some distant country.
[1:27:40] He's as close as your breath.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; If you could believe that, nothing is
[1:27:45] impossible in this service today.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; There isn't a sickness, there isn't a
[1:27:50] disease, there isn't a need that a
[1:27:52] person could have if you can grasp
[1:27:55] Jehovah Shama.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Not only is he present, this is part of
[1:28:00] my redemption.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel, you have to forgive me. I
[1:28:08] feel incredibly inspired and moved by
[1:28:12] the Holy Spirit to bring this to you.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; When they say the Lord is present, it
[1:28:20] doesn't mean that this person has it or
[1:28:22] that person has it or the preacher has
[1:28:24] it or someone who you know is highly
[1:28:27] visible has it. No, the person who
[1:28:30] doesn't hardly say anything and maybe is
[1:28:32] is scarcely seen or heard
[1:28:37] is very present to you.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Redemption
[1:28:47] is paramount
[1:28:49] in the mind of God.
[1:28:57] So much so that Jesus Christ, who's the
[1:29:01] theme of the entire scripture,
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; he's he is the redeemer.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham calls Isaiah the book
[1:29:10] of Isaiah, and I'm sure you've all heard
[1:29:12] this many times before, but we'll repeat
[1:29:15] it once again. Isaiah is a commentary of
[1:29:18] the entire Bible.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The book of Isaiah has 66 chapters
[1:29:25] and the Bible has 66 books.
[1:29:28] Isaiah starts off with the creation in a
[1:29:31] sense about the middle of the book you
[1:29:35] find John the Baptist and at the end of
[1:29:37] the book you find the millennium.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:42] Isaiah
[1:29:43] has said these things and I will just
[1:29:47] tell you as a matter of interest
[1:29:50] 18 times in the Bible
[1:29:54] God is spoken of as redeemer
[1:29:59] 13 of those times are in the book of
[1:30:02] Isaiah.
[1:30:05] I would say that that is telling us
[1:30:08] something. Isaiah who's writing a
[1:30:11] commentary of the Bible, his his his
[1:30:14] whole book is seasoned with he's a
[1:30:17] redeemer. He's a redeemer. He's a
[1:30:20] redeemer. And it's not Isaiah saying it.
[1:30:23] It's God saying it. And then I just have
[1:30:25] a few of them. Thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:30:27] Isaiah 44 and6. Thus sayith the Lord,
[1:30:30] the King of Israel and his redeemer, the
[1:30:32] Lord of hosts. I'm the first and I'm the
[1:30:35] last. And beside me there is no other
[1:30:36] God.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of redeemer I want.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 44:24, "Thus saith the Lord thy
[1:30:45] redeemer, and he that formed thee from
[1:30:47] the womb." We've all been formed from
[1:30:49] the womb. This is a message to you from
[1:30:52] Isaiah. Thus sayaith the Lord your
[1:30:54] redeemer.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; And he that formed you in the womb. You
[1:30:58] came as a part of the first Adam. But
[1:31:01] this is the one who's speaking to you.
[1:31:03] He is also the God who brings forth the
[1:31:06] redeemer, the tree of life, the living
[1:31:08] word that will transport you and does
[1:31:11] has transported us to the other side of
[1:31:13] the chasm.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; That formed thee from the womb. I am the
[1:31:18] Lord that maketh all things that
[1:31:20] stretcheth forth the heavens alone that
[1:31:23] spreadth abroad the earth by myself.
[1:31:25] Isaiah 54 and5 for thy maker is thine
[1:31:29] husband. Hallelujah.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Can you sit quiet?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Here he is speaking. Thy maker.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; He's thy husband.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm glad I got a husband to take
[1:31:44] care of us.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I had a husband who said, "I'm
[1:31:48] Jehovah Gyra. I'm the one that
[1:31:50] provides."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts is his name. and thy
[1:31:59] redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, the
[1:32:02] God of the whole earth, shall he be
[1:32:04] called?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; He's the God of the whole earth. He's
[1:32:07] your redeemer. He's your husband. He's
[1:32:09] your maker. He's everything. Oh, he's
[1:32:11] everything. He's everything to me.
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54:8. In a little while, in a
[1:32:20] little wrath, oh, I'm so glad it was
[1:32:23] just a little wrath. I hid my face from
[1:32:27] thee for a moment,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; but with everlasting kindness, not with
[1:32:33] everlasting wrath, but with everlasting
[1:32:35] kindness, will I have mercy on thee,
[1:32:38] says the Lord, thy redeemer.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the church of the living
[1:32:45] God rejoice in such a glorious promise.
[1:32:50] Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; It's been the theme of the church. The
[1:32:56] prophet said,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; "It's been its outlook. It's been its
[1:32:59] heart.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; The earth's bathed with the blood of his
[1:33:02] kinsman redeemer to redeem Adam's fallen
[1:33:06] race."
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; In the breach.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "This seven sealed book now
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; is the mystery of redemption."
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; And that was my message.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. the mystery of redemption.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; It's unfolding even now. And I trust
[1:33:24] you'll see things even in the in the
[1:33:26] word that's being ministered today. Say,
[1:33:28] "Oh my, it it I perhaps I've heard it
[1:33:31] before, but it never really took hold
[1:33:44] down all down through the scripture. the
[1:33:48] different stages and phases of this
[1:33:50] redemption and I won't even get into it
[1:33:52] or we won't get done
[1:33:54] I want to come to a very important part
[1:33:57] very important part
[1:34:04] when we come to the breach I've been
[1:34:05] speaking about don't think the breach is
[1:34:07] a message
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; the breach is actually an act
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; the same as Mary conceived in her womb
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; the breach is an is an event
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; and The event is the prophet is is
[1:34:19] announcing that Boaz is coming.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And now when he takes the book
[1:34:26] and your name is in the book,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; he's laying claim to you.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to each one of you,
[1:34:33] I'd like to sit across the table and
[1:34:35] look into your face and into your eyes.
[1:34:38] Every single believer, you have been
[1:34:40] claimed.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; You are not your own. You've been
[1:34:44] claimed. Oh, I'm so glad he claimed me.
[1:34:47] Because we all were in the devil's
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; we had a mortgage on our lives.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; We were in the devil's pawn shop.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And we've been claimed out.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus Christ came with the
[1:34:59] ticket
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; and said, "They're mine.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; I bought them.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; He's a mighty man of wealth. He's the
[1:35:06] Boaz." And he took you out of the pawn
[1:35:08] shop.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "You can't
[1:35:11] be in it and out of it at the same time.
[1:35:14] We're either in it or we're out of it."
[1:35:15] And I want How many can rejoice and say,
[1:35:17] "I'm out of the pawn shop.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; I'm out of it.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; I've been purchased. I know that I'm out
[1:35:25] of it. It's already taken place.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He has no claim on me.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; God through Jesus Christ has claimed
[1:35:34] me." And he actually sent a messenger
[1:35:36] down in this time. And to read those
[1:35:39] scriptures and to say, "It's now here."
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:44] This is not history, friends. This is
[1:35:46] present.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; If I'm beside myself, just leave me this
[1:35:54] way.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "These seven seals got the
[1:36:03] mysteries of God from the foundation of
[1:36:05] the world all sealed up in there
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; and revealed by seven different seals.
[1:36:10] There the mystery of redemption is
[1:36:12] sealed.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, there had to be part of
[1:36:15] the mystery of redemption.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That had to be made known.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; It has to be preached.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; It has to be received into your heart,
[1:36:24] into your mind, and into your heart and
[1:36:26] soul.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; It needs to come down that one channel.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Have adult minds now.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; The one channel which is the channel
[1:36:38] down to the soul. Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; One channel, five channels of the body,
[1:36:42] five channels of your spirit, memory and
[1:36:44] imagination and conscience and and
[1:36:47] affection and reasoning.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; All of those channels to the spirit
[1:36:51] emotional man. You know, I just throw
[1:36:53] this in and just pray that I'll find
[1:36:56] where I kind left off.
[1:36:59] I was studying this
[1:37:01] and I have said repeated many times
[1:37:05] and I wish I could take you to one of
[1:37:07] brother Ben's meetings right now
[1:37:11] where there were thousands of people and
[1:37:14] I sat in at least 30 of the meetings
[1:37:18] and I've seen him stand
[1:37:21] little small humble man
[1:37:24] and he just I could I could see that his
[1:37:27] his he would change. And we had been
[1:37:30] told and instructed he will do nothing.
[1:37:32] He cannot speak. He cannot. There's no
[1:37:36] ability. He said, "I'm just your
[1:37:37] brother." But when the angel of the Lord
[1:37:39] came,
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; he'd just say like this, "He's here."
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Quite often he'd raise the same hand and
[1:37:47] he'd say, "I now take every spirit,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; of every person under my control."
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; For the glory of God.
[1:37:59] He say, "Where's the first person?
[1:38:01] Where's the first patient?" And there
[1:38:04] were people who were friends of mine who
[1:38:06] he had never laid eyes on in his life.
[1:38:11] What would you do if you're sitting like
[1:38:13] where I was, where brother Tom is, and
[1:38:16] he's standing there, and a woman is
[1:38:18] standing here, old family friend
[1:38:21] of my family.
[1:38:23] He's standing about about as far as from
[1:38:26] the piano. He said, "Um,
[1:38:30] you're not here for yourself.
[1:38:33] You're here
[1:38:35] because you're praying for a man."
[1:38:38] And that man does not live in this city.
[1:38:42] He lives in a place just north from
[1:38:44] here. And I believe it's called Fort St.
[1:38:48] John.
[1:38:50] For those you British Columbians, you
[1:38:51] know where that is. is about 700 miles
[1:38:53] north
[1:38:55] and he said that man is shattered by
[1:38:58] death and he's dying with cancer
[1:39:02] and just told her to pray or to believe
[1:39:05] and and and she would go.
[1:39:08] The next morning, I'm in the car with
[1:39:10] brother Brandham driving to a location
[1:39:14] about 400 miles away up the Alaskan
[1:39:17] Highway and he doesn't know where I'm
[1:39:19] taking him.
[1:39:21] And that Alaskan highway when the US
[1:39:23] Army put it in, it goes right through
[1:39:25] some farmer's fields and they built the
[1:39:28] little village and finally became a town
[1:39:30] and now is a city called Fort St. John.
[1:39:33] and a bypass went right through a
[1:39:35] farmer's yard and a big old white house
[1:39:38] sitting maybe a couple hundred yards or
[1:39:40] meters off to the road and I often saw
[1:39:43] that house and then motel and gas
[1:39:45] stations build up all along the highway
[1:39:48] but that house that old farmhouse always
[1:39:50] stayed there and we're just driving by
[1:39:52] we're relaxed now the meetings are over
[1:39:54] brother Brandham's just in his dungarees
[1:39:56] his jeans little cowboy hat on and he's
[1:40:00] driving I'm sitting beside him brother
[1:40:01] Chris Berg is in the back seat
[1:40:04] And brother Bam's driving and we had to
[1:40:08] slow down because there just 30 mph
[1:40:10] speed limit there. He slows right down.
[1:40:14] Then he he just changed a wee bit. He
[1:40:16] says, "There was a woman praying for a
[1:40:20] man from Fort St. John. He was dying
[1:40:23] with cancer." I said, "Yes, Brother
[1:40:25] Brandham. Her name is Sister Clint.
[1:40:28] She's a very dear friend of my family."
[1:40:30] He just went like this. And that and
[1:40:32] because he was driving and we were
[1:40:33] passing by. He just went like this
[1:40:36] behind my head. He went behind my head.
[1:40:38] He says the man's in that house.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You might say like I said, and you can
[1:40:47] say, "Shame on me for that." I said,
[1:40:48] "How do I know he's in the house?"
[1:40:52] Do you know why you say that? Because
[1:40:54] the devil is present.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And I was just a babe. Even though I was
[1:40:59] ministering, been preaching for seven
[1:41:01] years, I we didn't know anything about
[1:41:03] the message and I had all kinds of
[1:41:05] questions and wonderments and I thought
[1:41:07] and I thought it wasn't my thought. It
[1:41:09] just flashed through my mind. How do I
[1:41:11] know he's in that house? Now I knew the
[1:41:13] woman on the platform. I knew her well.
[1:41:16] I knew now we're in Fort St. John and
[1:41:18] here's the house. He's identifying this
[1:41:20] old farmhouse
[1:41:22] 375 miles up the road. We stopped at
[1:41:25] brother Southwick's who was going to
[1:41:27] take us out hunting and take him out for
[1:41:29] a rest.
[1:41:31] And I want to tell brother Bud what kind
[1:41:33] of a man, what kind of a ministry, what,
[1:41:35] you know, because he knew nothing. He'd
[1:41:37] given his life to Christ, but he knew
[1:41:39] nothing about the Bible. Nothing.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; So I said, "Brother brother Bud, you
[1:41:43] know, he's he's a prophet." And I said,
[1:41:45] you know, on the platform, this is what
[1:41:47] happened. And when we're driving up the
[1:41:49] highway, I said, "We're slowing down.
[1:41:52] Fort St. John is on the right hand side.
[1:41:54] And I said, and he points, he says, "The
[1:41:56] man's in that house." Brother Bud says,
[1:41:59] "And Bud had been b born and raised in
[1:42:01] Fort St. John." He said, "Well, that's
[1:42:03] right." He said, "I know him." And he
[1:42:06] gave me his name. He says, "I also know
[1:42:08] he's dying with cancer." So now here,
[1:42:12] you wonder why I speak with such
[1:42:14] intensity? Because I'm so determined to
[1:42:17] cause people to believe it. There it was
[1:42:20] on the platform with the woman I knew
[1:42:22] that I knew he had never seen. There it
[1:42:24] was on the highway driving past the
[1:42:26] house. The man's in the house. There it
[1:42:28] is with my almost lifelong friend,
[1:42:31] brother Southwick. He says, "Yes, I know
[1:42:33] the man. I know he's dying with cancer.
[1:42:36] How could I disbelieve?
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; How could I disbelieve?"
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And then who has that kind of
[1:42:42] intelligence? Where does it come from?
[1:42:45] It's divine.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; It come from God. Then you begin to
[1:42:49] believe and see that God is speaking
[1:42:52] through the mouth. And you begin to hear
[1:42:54] it over and over and over again
[1:42:56] thousands of times. Not in a corner,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; throughout the whole earth,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; seven times around the world.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Why am I saying that? Why am I
[1:43:07] emphasizing that? Is so that when he
[1:43:09] begins to speak about your redemption
[1:43:12] that you will believe it with the same
[1:43:14] intensity.
[1:43:16] When he begins to say, "We're on the
[1:43:18] other side of the chasm. We're not in
[1:43:20] that confusion anymore." You'll believe
[1:43:22] it. When he'll say, "You're not church
[1:43:24] anymore. I call you bride." That you'll
[1:43:27] believe it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; When he say when he says, "We're not
[1:43:31] going to the wedding. We're married
[1:43:33] here. We're going to the marriage
[1:43:35] supper." That you'll believe it with the
[1:43:37] same intensity. And by believing it,
[1:43:40] friends, it will happen. I'm not asking
[1:43:43] how you feel today. You can feel as dead
[1:43:46] as this pullpit. But if you'll believe
[1:43:48] the word, that word has life in it.
[1:43:52] And that's the same word, the same word
[1:43:55] that created a seed in the womb of a
[1:43:58] virgin.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; And it'll turn you back, virgin.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Untouched.
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; So now I say in the name of the Lord,
[1:44:16] you are part
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; of this mystery of redemption.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; The process of redemption is taking
[1:44:23] place.
[1:44:24] And brother Brandham in the breach and
[1:44:26] this is the part I want to come to and
[1:44:28] then I'm going to close. He goes to the
[1:44:31] book of Ruth and it would it would do
[1:44:32] you well after this service go to the
[1:44:35] book of Ruth and read it. It's only four
[1:44:37] chapter four four chapters.
[1:44:41] Powerful
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; and in the breach that is the breach.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; In and that is revelation five.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; In revelation five
[1:44:52] he as kinsman redeemer.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; The lamb.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; The lamb. Not the king. The lamb.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Stood. Not the priest and not the
[1:45:02] prophet. The lamb.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; He came. See, apostle uh John the
[1:45:07] Baptist rather when he saw Jesus, they
[1:45:09] were cousins after the flesh, after the
[1:45:11] first Adam, they were cousins. But in
[1:45:13] the plan of God, they one was a prophet
[1:45:16] and the other was a god of the prophets.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; And he had revelation cuz he's a
[1:45:21] prophet. So he says, "Behold the lamb of
[1:45:23] God that takes away the sin of the
[1:45:26] world."
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; What a statement.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; What a statement. The sin of the world.
[1:45:33] What a revelation.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; How many believed him? I would say very
[1:45:37] few if any.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; And he probably scarcely could he
[1:45:42] probably scarcely could fathom his own
[1:45:45] words.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away
[1:45:49] the sin of the world. And I can see the
[1:45:51] people saying, "Oh yeah, they're
[1:45:52] cousins."
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, they've got something hatched
[1:45:56] up
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; like some have said. so ignorantly.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, Tom Ray, he he he's a
[1:46:06] son-in-law.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; That's God. I didn't have any idea he
[1:46:09] was ever going to preach the gospel.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; We have That's not That's not man's
[1:46:14] choosing. That's God's calling. And if
[1:46:17] you don't have a call, you just can't do
[1:46:19] it.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, that's quite a thing hatched
[1:46:24] up. They're two they're cousins.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And he's putting them forward as some
[1:46:29] great one. Behold the lamb of God that
[1:46:32] takes away the sin of the world.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; What a statement.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't man speaking. It was God
[1:46:39] speaking through the man.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Elijah speaking.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it was the spirit of
[1:46:46] Elijah? And the spirit of Elijah Malachi
[1:46:49] 4 spoke again in this time to turn your
[1:46:52] heart back to the faith of the father.
[1:46:57] Hallelujah.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; And so now he's commissioned to speak
[1:47:02] the opening of the seven seals.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; By the angels of God that descended,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; allowed science to take a picture of it.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Allowed me
[1:47:16] as a young man to sit in an audience
[1:47:19] when that picture was first shown
[1:47:22] and a gasp went over the people. Brother
[1:47:25] Bradom just said, "This is the way it is
[1:47:27] in the Life magazine."
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "They have it the wrong way.
[1:47:31] They just need to turn it to the right."
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And when he did, the people gasped and I
[1:47:35] gasped.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Said, "Who is this?" Jesus.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; He's the wicked one with white wig on.
[1:47:42] He's coming as the judge.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And he sends his messenger, "Go and
[1:47:46] speak the opening of the seals. Seven
[1:47:49] angels with seven seals to be open. a
[1:47:52] message to the end time to us
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; and he comes to speak and before he
[1:48:06] speaks
[1:48:08] he comes to the breach
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; and he says in in in a message I'm just
[1:48:14] going all over the map now he says in
[1:48:15] the message that the Old Testament
[1:48:19] you see the Old Testament and the New
[1:48:21] Testament 's husband and wife.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:48:26] It's like Christ and his bride.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; All right. At the end of the Old
[1:48:31] Testament, which is here
[1:48:36] comes Jesus Christ.
[1:48:39] And between this page, I hate to do this
[1:48:41] with my new Bible, but between this page
[1:48:46] and this page is 400 and some years.
[1:48:50] And there was no prophet during that 400
[1:48:52] years.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And this closing of this prophet's
[1:48:55] mouth, he says, "Behold,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; I will send you."
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet before the great and
[1:49:02] terrible day of the Lord. His first
[1:49:05] coming was great. His last coming is
[1:49:07] terrible.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; He came with to pay the price for
[1:49:10] redemption the first time. He comes the
[1:49:12] last time to claim his own and bring
[1:49:14] judgment to the sin cursed earth. Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, when the world's on fire,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; don't you want to be in God's bosom?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be in God's bosom? I
[1:49:29] said,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; I'll send you Elijah the prophet
[1:49:41] and he'll turn the heart.
[1:49:44] And this prophet said the Old Testament.
[1:49:47] Now I said this was husband and wife.
[1:49:51] Eve,
[1:49:52] this is the wife. So Eve
[1:49:56] was hidden in Adam.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody knew anything about her.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; She was hidden or concealed in Adam.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; When she came out was brought out.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said the woman is
[1:50:15] given to the man so he can reflect
[1:50:17] himself.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; And so now his garden is there and he
[1:50:21] can sew his seed.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And he Adam reflects himself. And the
[1:50:26] perverted one Cain did not reflect the
[1:50:28] son of God. So she had another seed. And
[1:50:33] the scripture says, "And God appointed
[1:50:35] her another seed."
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Enos.
[1:50:39] And then Seth
[1:50:42] or Seth and whichever.
[1:50:46] Now he has a seed that reflect him.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; And we have the two vines
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; and they're here today.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; They're here with us today.
[1:51:00] So now
[1:51:02] the messenger comes
[1:51:05] and he says the Old Testament.
[1:51:09] So Naomi in the book of Ruth and I have
[1:51:14] to go very quickly and I only want to
[1:51:15] take another five minutes or so. And so
[1:51:18] Naomi in the book of Ruth, he goes to
[1:51:20] Naomi says she's the old Orthodox
[1:51:23] church. She's the old Jewish church.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and she's got a gentile with her
[1:51:32] and the two
[1:51:35] there was Ruth and Orpha but Ruth was
[1:51:39] had been married
[1:51:41] but her husband could bring no seed to
[1:51:43] her and so she had brought forth no
[1:51:46] children
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; so she was childless a widowed childless
[1:51:52] woman and she she follows Ruth and
[1:51:56] there's wonderful words She follows
[1:51:58] Naomi rather and it's words that are
[1:52:01] used in weddings and so on and so forth
[1:52:03] and by the world. Your God will be my
[1:52:05] God. Your people will be my people.
[1:52:09] Where you live, I'll live. And where you
[1:52:11] die, I'll die. And all of these
[1:52:12] wonderful words. It's a lot more than
[1:52:14] that. But now a prophet comes and gives
[1:52:16] it completely different and new meaning.
[1:52:18] Says that's the old Hebrew church. And
[1:52:21] and now comes Boaz who was a near
[1:52:24] kinsman to her and to Naomi. And in
[1:52:28] redeeming the old Hebrew church, he gets
[1:52:31] a gentile bride
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; because she came with her.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And Naomi's aged now. And Ruth goes to
[1:52:40] the field. And the Bible says it haps it
[1:52:43] happened that she lighted in Boaz's
[1:52:47] field.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; And what does Jesus say the field is?
[1:52:49] fulfilled as the world.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; It It just so happened
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; that you arrived here in the world.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; It just so happened that you arrived at
[1:52:58] this present time.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; It just so happened that you arrived in
[1:53:02] this church today. And it didn't just so
[1:53:05] happen. It's no accident. It's a design
[1:53:08] of almighty God to hear. And God wanted
[1:53:11] you to hear what you're hearing today.
[1:53:13] And God wants that word not to come into
[1:53:16] your ears, but to go down the channel
[1:53:18] into the soul.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; God wants to pregnant you
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; with the life of this word.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; You women that have born children,
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; for a while it's a mystery.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; For a while it's a secret.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; For a while no one even knows. and you
[1:53:41] have kind of a Mona Lisa smile on your
[1:53:43] face.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; You know something no one else knows.
[1:53:47] Then your husband perhaps gets to know
[1:53:49] the secret with you. And then you keep
[1:53:51] the secret. But finally, eventually the
[1:53:54] life begins to show.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Finally, eventually you can't hide it
[1:53:59] any longer.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Finally, everybody knows you're carrying
[1:54:03] a child.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we can't hide it
[1:54:07] anymore.
[1:54:08] Hallelujah. We just can't hide it. And
[1:54:11] neither do we want to hide it. We've
[1:54:12] been pregnantated by the spoken word of
[1:54:15] Almighty God. And we're thrilled about
[1:54:18] it.
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; And that word will see you out of this
[1:54:23] country.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; That word will see you out of the grave
[1:54:26] if you go to the grave first.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Don't belittle sir
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; the word that's to raise you in the
[1:54:32] resurrection.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; But this is it. And here's really my
[1:54:37] theme, which I've been all this time
[1:54:39] getting to.
[1:54:41] Boaz, our kinsman redeemer.
[1:54:45] Oh, it is. I just so love this.
[1:54:50] He comes to the field
[1:54:54] towards the ending of day
[1:54:57] and all the reapers are there. There's a
[1:54:58] great revival going on. This is a
[1:55:00] harvest time.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; And his eye is fixed. He sees one maiden
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; and he speaks to his servant singular
[1:55:10] who's over all the reapers
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; and he says to the servant who's going
[1:55:16] to introduce him to his bride.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Who is this maiden?
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, she's the moabitetish.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; She's a gentile.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; She's not Jewish, but she's a gentile.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; And from that time, he passes off the
[1:55:31] scene. And from that time forward, it's
[1:55:34] only Boaz and Ruth.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Ruth goes and tells Naomi that Boaz, I'm
[1:55:41] in Boaz's field. Naomi tells her, Naomi,
[1:55:45] the Old Testament, tells her he's a near
[1:55:48] kinsman.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; It's the Old Testament that tells us all
[1:55:51] about the kinsmen. It's the law of Moses
[1:55:53] that gave us the law of the kinsman
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and the work of the kinsman and what he
[1:55:57] had to do. And Boaz begins to do that.
[1:55:59] And the prophet in our day begins to
[1:56:01] show that this is Revelation five.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Our kinsman
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; came and took the book
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; and you were in the book.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Boaz as a kinsman came and took Ruth.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't leave her in the field. He
[1:56:16] took her
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; to his own place
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; and gave her seed.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; And God, the Bible says, gave her
[1:56:25] conception.
[1:56:28] God gave you seed,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; a spoken word seed.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; And but God gave you the conception.
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; And just as he's ready to take her,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; is it all right? I have a few more
[1:56:45] minutes.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Just as he's ready to take her,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Boaz says,
[1:56:54] "But there's a nearer kinsman.
[1:56:58] There's one that's nearer than me.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:57:07] and I will go to him first
[1:57:11] and see if he can redeem you.
[1:57:15] I was reading it in the original Hebrew
[1:57:21] and I'll just read it for you.
[1:57:30] And here's the original Hebrew
[1:57:32] when Boaz says that and he says, "Now
[1:57:35] surely it is true that a redeemer am I
[1:57:42] or a redeemer I am.
[1:57:45] But also there is a redeemer nearer than
[1:57:47] I."
[1:57:50] said, "So stay here tonight,
[1:57:53] and it shall be in the morning.
[1:57:56] If he will redeem you, good,
[1:57:59] he will redeem.
[1:58:01] If not, he is pleased to redeem you,
[1:58:05] then I will redeem you."
[1:58:09] I won't go into it. Brother Brandham
[1:58:12] said that was the devil.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He was the first one that was closer to
[1:58:18] you.
[1:58:20] You were born in this world with a
[1:58:22] sinful nature.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You were born in this world shapen in
[1:58:26] iniquities and speaking lies and and he
[1:58:29] had and the Bible said and the prophet
[1:58:31] of God says he had control of you and
[1:58:34] your own life tells you he had control
[1:58:36] of you and what he said you did and the
[1:58:38] places he enticed you to go you went. He
[1:58:41] was in. But there was one thing Boaz
[1:58:44] said to him, "All right, if you'll
[1:58:46] redeem Naomi, the Old Testament,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; which was just under blood of bulls and
[1:58:51] goats,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; he said, "Will you redeem her?" He says,
[1:58:54] "I'll redeem her
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; because you could kill goats and bulls
[1:58:58] forever."
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; So he didn't have any problem with that.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "But let it be known that if
[1:59:06] you're going to redeem Naomi, you got to
[1:59:08] redeem Ruth also." Yeah.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said, "I can't do it."
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said he couldn't
[1:59:15] do it. Do you know why he couldn't do
[1:59:16] it? Because he couldn't redeem you from
[1:59:19] sin when he was the author of sin.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; He said he already was the devil. How
[1:59:24] could he redeem you?
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; He was the one who brought you to this
[1:59:28] lost state.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; He was the one who robbed it from us.
[1:59:32] How could he save us?
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; He was the one who brought us to his
[1:59:36] side of the chasm. How was he going to
[1:59:38] take us to the other side?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; And it was that one thing.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, follow me. Stay real close. The one
[1:59:49] thing he couldn't do was create.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; And in order to redeem, there had to be
[1:59:55] an act of creation.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; And I say redemption, you can hung this
[2:00:00] phrase and stay with it. Redemption hung
[2:00:03] on the thread of creation.
[2:00:06] That's right.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Redemption hung on that little thread
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; of creative power.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; That's why I read Matthew first.
[2:00:21] redemption actually hung
[2:00:24] on Isaiah being able to say against all
[2:00:28] science and against all the wisdom of
[2:00:29] the world and against everything that a
[2:00:31] man that even had been with the king of
[2:00:34] Uzziah that a man a man who had been
[2:00:37] respected would say a virgin will
[2:00:41] conceive.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; But redemption hung
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; on that word. Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; And if God spoke it, God will never deny
[2:00:52] it.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; And whether it be 2,000 years ago or
[2:00:56] 10,000 years ago or 10,000 in the
[2:00:58] future, a virgin would conceive.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; There's no way. It's not going to
[2:01:06] happen.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; It was going to take place. And Satan,
[2:01:14] the nearer kinsman, could not bring
[2:01:17] forth a virgin birth.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "I can't do it."
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Then Boaz said, "Well, I will."
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; I'm a mighty man of wealth. I will.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "A redeemer I am."
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I love that. A redeemer I am. And if he
[2:01:39] won't do it, if he's not pleased to do
[2:01:41] it, I will do it.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. You might be a
[2:01:46] motivish. You came from a very bad
[2:01:48] background. You came from a very
[2:01:50] terrible uh life, but I will do it.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll bring you into my
[2:01:55] place. I'll sew you with my seed and I
[2:01:58] will redeem you fully.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; And you won't only become a wife, you'll
[2:02:02] become the mother of kings. Hallelujah.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; I won't you won't only become my wife
[2:02:07] but you will be called in the New
[2:02:09] Testament.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Your name will be transferred into the
[2:02:13] book of into the book of uh uh Matthew.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; You will be called one of the mothers of
[2:02:19] Jesus Christ.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Now I close. Do you think the same as I
[2:02:31] opened with Mary, the Virgin Mary, do
[2:02:33] you think for a moment that Ruth, there
[2:02:36] she is, fresh out of the field, she'd
[2:02:38] been laying at this man's feet through
[2:02:39] the night, resting.
[2:02:43] And then the prophet says, Ruth
[2:02:45] deciding,
[2:02:46] Ruth resting and Ruth rewarded
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; four stages of redemption in her life.
[2:02:54] Do you think you could have said to her,
[2:02:55] "Ruth,
[2:02:58] Ruth,
[2:03:00] you're going to bear a son
[2:03:03] and you're going to actually change the
[2:03:05] whole direction of redemption."
[2:03:10] They would knew well about redemption.
[2:03:12] You're going to be used in this way to
[2:03:14] change the whole
[2:03:16] uh the whole effect of redemption. In
[2:03:19] fact, is Boaz through you. who is going
[2:03:22] to change from kinsman redeemer
[2:03:26] and through your seed you're going to be
[2:03:28] instrumental in turning him into king of
[2:03:30] kings
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; right
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; he's going to be the son he's going to
[2:03:34] be the lion of the tribe of Judah he's
[2:03:37] going to take his kingship
[2:03:40] through you
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; now folks you can think I'm crazy
[2:03:45] whatever you want to think
[2:03:49] for 2 cares.
[2:03:52] Jesus has been
[2:03:55] made known to the people and by the
[2:03:57] people that he's Jesus and he's waiting.
[2:04:00] He has his arms extended. He's waiting
[2:04:02] for you. He's the lamb. He He bled for
[2:04:04] you. He died. He hung on a cross for
[2:04:06] you. There has to come a time when that
[2:04:09] ends.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; There has to come a time when that phase
[2:04:15] of it ends. Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; You can ship me off if you want on the
[2:04:20] next boat to whoever, wherever. But I'm
[2:04:23] here to tell you on the authority of
[2:04:25] what the prophet of God spoke
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; that season has ended.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; And we're just in the changing and and
[2:04:36] you want to know what part of redemption
[2:04:38] you're playing
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; through you.
[2:04:41] Through the bride of Jesus Christ. We're
[2:04:44] not just a bunch of little churches here
[2:04:46] and there. You're not called just to be
[2:04:48] a church. You're not called just to sing
[2:04:51] in a choir or to play in a church.
[2:04:52] That's not where we're called here to
[2:04:54] believe a word that God has said. We're
[2:04:56] called to believe that word and it will
[2:04:58] be pregnantated by that and a life will
[2:05:00] come forth.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; You don't know any more about that life
[2:05:05] than Ruth did.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; And you don't know any more about that
[2:05:08] life than perhaps Mary did
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; because you don't know just how it's
[2:05:12] going to happen. How is God going to go
[2:05:14] back? But he's going to change back
[2:05:16] through the bride of Jesus Christ. He's
[2:05:18] he's making himself known as king.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; King,
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; son of David,
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; as king.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; And he's making a shift and he's going
[2:05:30] back to the Jews. I don't know when. I
[2:05:33] don't know if it's already started.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's halfway through.
[2:05:37] But before he takes his position as king
[2:05:40] of the Jews, the same prophet said, "You
[2:05:45] will be gone."
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:54] You know, if you told me
[2:05:57] that God was going to bring forth
[2:06:01] uh child by a virgin birth, Brother
[2:06:04] Brandham says that's not that scarcely
[2:06:06] is that's not as miraculous as a natural
[2:06:10] birth.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; If you think of God Almighty, creator of
[2:06:14] heavens and earth, speaking a word in a
[2:06:15] woman conceiving, I I understand that in
[2:06:18] a moment.
[2:06:19] But how you brought forth
[2:06:22] a child
[2:06:24] and in your womb you women that a spine
[2:06:27] begins to form
[2:06:30] and that ears and hands
[2:06:33] and features of a body and a heart
[2:06:36] begins to beat when it's just a little
[2:06:39] piece of pulp.
[2:06:42] You talk about marvelous.
[2:06:44] And to think God would take you as a
[2:06:46] human being and bring forth that kind of
[2:06:49] life. That God has ordained you men,
[2:06:54] women, sons, and daughters of God to
[2:06:56] bring forth a life of Jesus Christ. This
[2:06:59] word is a literal seed.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; This word has pregnantated certain
[2:07:04] people.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; And and you that may not have
[2:07:07] experienced it, you ought to say today
[2:07:10] with unabashed forward out open say, "Oh
[2:07:13] God,
[2:07:14] Let your word penetrate
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and come down into the womb of my soul
[2:07:19] and bring forth the life of Jesus
[2:07:21] Christ.
[2:07:23] [Applause]
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; You think that that's being too
[2:07:30] forceful? Not at all.
[2:07:32] One of Jacob's wives who couldn't have
[2:07:35] children, she laid a hold of him, said,
[2:07:38] "Give me children or I die." Amen.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; You think that was some little weak
[2:07:44] statement?
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; No. It meant everything.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Give me children or I die.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Am I God?
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; How can I do that?"
[2:07:55] If a woman could do that for a natural
[2:07:57] son,
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; how much more you and I long after this
[2:08:01] service, God help us. We're not just
[2:08:02] having church. When you go home and
[2:08:05] you're in your car, oh God, oh God, hear
[2:08:08] me. If I got anything out of the sermon
[2:08:11] this morning, fragate me with your
[2:08:13] living word seed.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; When you read the next message
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; and you hear that God sent this
[2:08:21] messenger
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; with a spoken word seed,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; you'll not take it as a booklet or a
[2:08:26] tape or just a a sermon that somebody's
[2:08:28] preaching. You say, "This is a seed of
[2:08:30] God. This is God's creative power
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; that he sent into me.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; It'll change your life.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; It'll bring about changes you never even
[2:08:43] dreamed of. Forget about how you want to
[2:08:45] change your life. Believe the word.
[2:08:47] Believe him who God has sent.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:54] [Applause]
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; There was a nearer kinsman, but he
[2:08:59] couldn't do it.
[2:09:00] Hallelujah. He couldn't do it.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; He couldn't He couldn't bring forth the
[2:09:04] spoken word.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He's out there all over on every church
[2:09:09] corner
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; saying today, "I can do it. I can do it.
[2:09:12] I can do it."
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; But there's one who said he can't do it.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God came in this
[2:09:17] generation said he couldn't do it.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; So, we had one that did do it.
[2:09:28] Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; A near kinsman.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to sing.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Redeemed.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Redeemed. There's so many songs I could
[2:09:42] uh pass through my mind. I'm going to
[2:09:45] have brother Kim come and help me.
[2:09:47] Brother Derek is busy at the camp today
[2:09:52] and we're busy here hearing the word.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; How do you feel? Amen.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; How do you believe?
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; That's the thing I want to know. You
[2:10:02] believe it?
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Father,
[2:10:17] dear father,
[2:10:21] you were not uh you did not hold back
[2:10:24] whatsoever.
[2:10:26] You chose your vessels and you spoke
[2:10:28] through them all down through the
[2:10:29] centuries of time.
[2:10:32] You're doing so even now.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; You did in this generation.
[2:10:37] I'm deeply humbled
[2:10:39] this morning to think that perhaps I
[2:10:41] could take this time, a couple of hours
[2:10:45] of these people's time and speak of the
[2:10:48] things that I've seen and heard and
[2:10:51] bring to them the message that they have
[2:10:53] heard and believed. And for some we
[2:10:56] rejoice together, oh God. We rejoice in
[2:10:59] what you're doing. We rejoice immensely.
[2:11:02] And others, Lord, I pray that I've been
[2:11:05] instrumental in creating within them a
[2:11:07] great hunger.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; A hunger that will not let them go long
[2:11:10] after they've left this building.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; May they cry out to you in their own
[2:11:15] quiet time. Oh God almighty, creator of
[2:11:19] heavens and earth. Create in me, oh God.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Create in me the very life source of
[2:11:26] Jesus Christ.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Live in me richly.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; If you're here and you have not
[2:11:33] experienced that, you can do so in this
[2:11:36] moment. If God is calling you, I cannot
[2:11:40] call you. The sermon can't call you. It
[2:11:42] must be the Holy Spirit of God that
[2:11:44] calls you. But if he's calling you, I
[2:11:47] say in the name of the Lord, yield to
[2:11:49] that voice. If you've been just a hearer
[2:11:52] of the message, oh friend, don't cross
[2:11:56] over in the attitude you're in right
[2:11:58] now. Cease being just a hearer of the
[2:12:00] word and say, "Oh God, I want to be a
[2:12:03] full participant.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; I want to be surrendered to you.
[2:12:08] come in all of your beauty
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; and all of your power and create within
[2:12:13] me
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Father, if we've done wrong, thought
[2:12:20] wrong, sinned, had iniquity in our
[2:12:24] heart, forgive us, oh God.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; I pray you'll forgive forgiveness will
[2:12:28] come to each one, oh Lord, and they will
[2:12:31] receive it from you,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, in your name.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Work. Lord. I prayed earlier today that
[2:12:43] you'd send your Holy Ghost spirit across
[2:12:47] this congregation of people and those on
[2:12:50] the internet reach out. Oh father in
[2:12:54] Jesus name. In Jesus name. Loose the
[2:12:57] bands. Loose the feathers and cause this
[2:13:00] one that was nearer. This one who said
[2:13:02] he would be a redeemer but he didn't
[2:13:04] have the power to redeem. He didn't have
[2:13:07] the blood to redeem. He didn't have the
[2:13:09] creation in him to redeem. He's a
[2:13:11] deceiver, a perverter. And we deny him
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; Redeemed. Redeemed.
[2:13:29] Let's just worship for a moment.
[2:13:37] Redee,
[2:13:40] redeemed,
[2:13:43] redeemed by the blood of the lamb.
[2:13:48] Redee,
[2:13:52] redeem
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:13:57] forever. I am
[2:14:01] redeemed. How I love to
[2:14:06] redeem
[2:14:09] the lamb
[2:14:12] through his
[2:14:14] mercy
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:18] forever. I am
[2:14:21] redeemed.
[2:14:24] Redee
[2:14:39] his child forever. I am the last place.
[2:14:45] No, I shall see his beauty.
[2:14:50] The king might
[2:14:54] [Music]
[2:14:55] be
[2:14:57] my
[2:15:00] and
[2:15:05] redee.
[2:15:15] Redeemed
[2:15:22] is
[2:15:24] forever. I am I am redeemed. I am
[2:15:28] redeemed.
[2:15:31] I am redeemed.
[2:15:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:15:45] [Applause]
[2:15:50] I
[2:15:52] am you
[2:15:54] just
[2:15:56] I am
[2:16:01] I am
[2:16:04] [Music]
[2:16:08] I am redeemed
[2:16:13] with the Christ.
[2:16:17] Jesus
[2:16:18] has changed my whole life.
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:35] that
[2:16:37] I am redeemed.
[2:16:42] I can't tell you how privileged I feel
[2:16:47] and am to be with you,
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; the redeemed.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; And we're singing right now, but I'm
[2:16:59] going to tell you on the authority of
[2:17:01] God's word,
[2:17:03] you are going to sing. And I'm saying
[2:17:05] this in faith and by grace. You and I
[2:17:08] are going to sing.
[2:17:10] We're going to sing about his
[2:17:11] redemption.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; And the angels,
[2:17:16] Prophet God said, angels are going to
[2:17:18] stand
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; in bowed silence because they can't sing
[2:17:22] it.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Creatures of worship, but they can't
[2:17:27] sing it. They've never been lost.
[2:17:28] They've never been redeemed. Amen.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; And they're going to stand listening to
[2:17:33] you and I say,
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; "That's not a myth.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; That's not some far off fence story.
[2:17:42] That's a reality."
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, do you believe what I'm
[2:17:48] do you believe what the prophet of God
[2:17:50] said?
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "An angel is standing right
[2:17:56] beside you." Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; That angel is there to protect that
[2:18:02] angel. Your word body is right beside
[2:18:04] you.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; But that angel cannot participate in the
[2:18:08] song you're singing right now.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; He can't say I'm redeemed, but you can.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's fine, friends. You can ship me
[2:18:21] off to the puzzle factory if you want
[2:18:23] to,
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; but you might as well sing a song for
[2:18:26] your angel.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; All right, Angel, I'll sing for you. You
[2:18:30] can't sing this one, but I'll sing it
[2:18:32] for you.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed. Everyone
[2:18:45] Jesus
[2:18:47] has changed.
[2:18:58] [Music]
[2:19:05] [Music]
[2:19:12] I have to make an announcement
[2:19:16] in April.
[2:19:18] How many remember Brother Gary Walker,
[2:19:20] Sister Deborah, Brother Gary Walker? Did
[2:19:22] you see the pictures? Remember the
[2:19:24] pictures? Many of you never did see the
[2:19:27] pictures. You won't need to. You're
[2:19:29] going to see him.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was driving in his car in New
[2:19:32] Zealand
[2:19:34] coming to a a place on the road after a
[2:19:36] meeting I believe it was going a curve
[2:19:39] and a truck with a huge load of logs or
[2:19:43] timber and lumber on it was coming
[2:19:46] around. They came around too fast and
[2:19:48] the load broke loose and the load fell
[2:19:52] on his car. His wife was in the car and
[2:19:55] he threw himself over to protect her.
[2:19:59] uh from the from the crush
[2:20:04] and uh I don't know how badly she was
[2:20:06] hurt but the air helicopter ambulance
[2:20:12] they had said he's dead they tried to
[2:20:16] revive him they then he would come back
[2:20:19] then he'd go again he was broken crushed
[2:20:23] from the top of his head to the soles of
[2:20:26] his feet we have followed
[2:20:29] They flew him into a hospital and the
[2:20:32] paramedics said there was just no way
[2:20:35] that this was impossible.
[2:20:38] Flew him into a hospital and he started
[2:20:40] the long road to recovery. And the
[2:20:43] doctors and the medical team said he
[2:20:45] won't do this and he won't be able to do
[2:20:47] that. He won't have his mentality. He
[2:20:49] won't have his mental capabilities. He
[2:20:51] won't have this movement. He won't have
[2:20:53] his arm movements. And they have all
[2:20:55] come to confess, we have never never in
[2:20:58] our entire in our entire profession seen
[2:21:03] this kind of resolve and determination.
[2:21:06] And that man now he is mowing his lawn
[2:21:09] behind a lawnmower. He is standing
[2:21:12] behind a pulpit and ministering. And
[2:21:14] God's willing, he's going to stand
[2:21:16] behind this pulpit and minister to you.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:28] April the 18th and we're going to show
[2:21:30] the pictures and he's got a PowerPoint
[2:21:33] presentation and he's going to preach.
[2:21:36] I've asked him, he's a little bit
[2:21:38] nervous about it, but you can be praying
[2:21:39] about it. I asked him that I would like
[2:21:42] to have him and Sister Deborah on the
[2:21:44] platform and do an interview. And he
[2:21:46] said, "I'm a little uncomfortable.
[2:21:48] That's out of my comfort zone. But if
[2:21:49] you feel led to, and I'll tell you why I
[2:21:52] feel led to. Brother Kim Dingwall sat
[2:21:55] here with his wife Haddie and Beth who
[2:21:58] was here. How many years was Beth with
[2:22:03] leukemia?
[2:22:06] Six years
[2:22:08] fighting the devil of leukemia. Sister
[2:22:11] Beth, who stands? Raise your hand.
[2:22:13] Sister Beth, raise it higher. There you
[2:22:16] are. Sister Beth comes in here and does
[2:22:19] uh mission secretarial work for her
[2:22:21] daddy. That girl laid for six years in
[2:22:26] and out of hospitals. Her hospital
[2:22:29] record is almost a foot high.
[2:22:31] And usually they don't give those
[2:22:33] documents out. When brother Kim said,
[2:22:35] "We want to do a video
[2:22:38] interview. We've been asked." And they
[2:22:40] just sent gave him the whole file.
[2:22:43] Sister Beth's testimony,
[2:22:47] Sister Beth's testimony, we'll pray for
[2:22:49] him,
[2:22:52] is mandatory
[2:22:54] information now
[2:22:56] with the nurses in the hospital in
[2:23:01] Calgary.
[2:23:03] We have a little little boy here. Let's
[2:23:05] just bow our heads and pray for him.
[2:23:08] Heavenly Father,
[2:23:11] so much of this viruses and going around
[2:23:14] and our young lad here, brother Tom
[2:23:17] Frey's son, I believe, just had this
[2:23:20] fainting spell. In the name of Jesus
[2:23:23] Christ, our redeemer,
[2:23:25] our redeemer,
[2:23:27] let the virtue from the resurrected
[2:23:29] redeemer flow into his body. Lord, we
[2:23:32] rebuke the enemy that would try to
[2:23:34] distract and distract the people and
[2:23:37] distract him. And if it's some kind of
[2:23:39] sickness trying to come on, we rebuke
[2:23:41] you, Satan. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:23:45] we deny you this right. You do not have,
[2:23:47] you cannot cross this threshold. You are
[2:23:50] not the redeemer. Our redeemer is
[2:23:52] Jehovah Rafa. He's Jehovah Nissi. He's
[2:23:56] Jehovah Tidu. He is the healer. We thank
[2:24:01] you, oh God, your power thrust him out
[2:24:05] in Jesus Christ's name. And that your
[2:24:08] name may be glorified. And even now, we
[2:24:10] thank you, Lord, for what you did for
[2:24:12] brother Gary Walker. And that you will
[2:24:14] bring him, oh God, here. And that the
[2:24:16] people will hear and many more perhaps
[2:24:19] who are streaming will make an effort to
[2:24:20] be here during that time in Jesus
[2:24:23] Christ's name. Amen.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:24:29] lay hands on him and get him a little a
[2:24:32] little bit of water. Amen.
[2:24:35] Hallelujah. God bless you, son.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our redeemer is faithful and true.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Can we sing that? Uh
[2:24:48] do we have the words to it? Our redeemer
[2:24:50] is faithful and true. Those of you that
[2:24:52] maybe don't know it,
[2:24:54] lift it up. Don't be don't be hesitant.
[2:24:56] and then we're closing. Thank you all
[2:24:59] the people from Seattle. I see a number
[2:25:02] of you here. And I say to the
[2:25:04] congregation, don't don't be ashamed or
[2:25:06] afraid. Just ask people, are you are you
[2:25:09] from Tacoma or Seattle or Mary'sville or
[2:25:11] someplace? So they if they want to be to
[2:25:13] the evening service or even if they
[2:25:15] don't can't be to the evening service,
[2:25:17] maybe they can slip over to your place,
[2:25:18] have a bite to eat or take them out,
[2:25:21] whatever. And I'd like to do that. Show
[2:25:23] all the hospitality you can. Would you
[2:25:26] do that? God bless you. So nice to see
[2:25:29] you. Amen.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; My redeemer
[2:25:34] is faithful and true.
[2:25:40] Everything
[2:25:42] he has said he will do.
[2:25:47] Thank you now. Every morning
[2:25:51] his mercies are new.
[2:25:57] My redeemer
[2:25:59] is faithful
[2:26:01] and true.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Once again, let's just
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; My redeemer
[2:26:08] is faithful and
[2:26:13] everything he has said he will will do.
[2:26:22] Every morning
[2:26:24] his mercies are new.
[2:26:30] My redeemer
[2:26:33] is faithful
[2:26:35] and true.
[2:26:39] Let's just power.
[2:26:42] Heavenly Father, there are so many
[2:26:44] gallant
[2:26:46] men of God here that I would like to
[2:26:49] have heard pray.
[2:26:51] But now we are just standing here at the
[2:26:53] post of duty to ask your blessings.
[2:26:56] Special blessings upon the people
[2:27:00] as they leave. Your presence will be
[2:27:03] with them. Let it be an intense
[2:27:05] presence. Let it be one that is actually
[2:27:08] felt within them as they go in their
[2:27:11] automobiles or down the highways. Give
[2:27:14] them safe drive. The people that have
[2:27:16] come from Seattle, Tacoma, Mary'sville,
[2:27:19] and from distant places. Bless them.
[2:27:22] Bless them. I pray. May the word be
[2:27:25] quickened to them in Jesus Christ's
[2:27:28] name. I pray that you'll dismiss us with
[2:27:30] your smile of approval. Lord of all
[2:27:34] things we want to be pleasing to you.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; We thank you now in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; I dismiss you in the name of the Lord.
[2:27:43] If you'll just greet one another and
[2:27:45] then leave uh quietly at
[2:27:50] 5:00 tonight, we're going to hear from
[2:27:52] brother John Andy's. He hasn't preached
[2:27:53] here for quite a while. He just got back
[2:27:55] from Belgium at the convention there.
[2:27:58] And so, God bless you and we'll see you
[2:28:00] this evening 5:00. You're dismissed in
[2:28:03] Jesus name. Is that right?
