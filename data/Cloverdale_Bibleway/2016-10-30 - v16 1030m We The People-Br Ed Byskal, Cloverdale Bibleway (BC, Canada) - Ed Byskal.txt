TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of Alexander David on October 27th at 1:37 a.m. weighing in at 8 lb and 8 o and um 21.6 in long. They're very accurate. Both baby and mommy are doing well. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then a testimony from Brother Norm and Sister Louise. Um you got to excuse me. I got to put on these cuz I don't want to make a mistake. Uh, Brother Norm writes in, "Thank you for your prayers. Two weeks ago, Sister Louise saw her diabetic specialist. She was almost hospitalized due to an extremely high sugar count. She was given insulin in the office. Her sugar count dropped and she was allowed to go home. As of Friday, her number was below the target seven. She hasn't been there for many years. She wants to give the Lord all the glory for the remarkable turnaround. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you so much. God bless you richly and continue to heal you and raise you up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Let's sing uh victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I heard an old old story. Praise God. Let's sing it with all your heart. I heard an old old story. How a savior came from glory. How he on Calvary save a rich life for me. And I heard about his gro at. And I repented of my sins and won the victory. Oh, victory in Jesus my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redee blood. He loved me and I knew him and all my love. He bunched me to victory in the cleansing blood. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power healing. How he made you walk with me and he caused the blind to see [Applause] Jesus come and he spit and somehow Jesus came on to the victory. Oh, victory Jesus my savior forever. He saw me and he bought me his blood. He and all my blood. I heard about a mansion he has built for me. And I heard about the streets of beyond the crystal world and the orange story. And someday I'll sing our song victory. Oh, Jesus my s [Music] and me [Music] and all my victory. Oh, victory. I see. [Music] And [Music] of my [Music] blood. Victory in the cleansing blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am redeemed and I'm following a price. Jesus has changed my whole life. [Music] I see who I am. that I [Music] I'll tell his face tell of his precious love. I'll tell his goodness to me. He purchases my redemption with his precious blood and sing [Music] and I'm [Music] Jesus and [Music] If anybody ask you to guess who I am, there was the of where there was confusion peace now. Oh, when I walk in with Jesus, I follow the king and it's all because I am [Music] I am and I [Music] Make my life. [Music] Yes. Yes. I am [Music] I am. [Music] Let's try that song. He signed the feet number 302. I don't know how many of you know this song. We used to sing it a lot years ago and it's been going through my mind and I just think the words are just perfect. He signed the deed with his atoning blood. He ever lives to make his promise sure. Though all the hosts of hell march in to make a second claim, they all have to march out at the mention of Jesus name. Amen. Praise God. Let's all stand together. We'll learn it together. He signed the deed with his atoning blood. He ever lives to make his promise. Though all the hosts of hell march in to make a second claim, they all march out at the mansion of his name. He signs us with his atoning blood. He ever will make his promise. Though all the hosts of hell march in to make a second claim, they all march out at the manion of his name. One more tiny sign with days of joining lives to make his promise. Though all the hosts of hell marching to make a second claim, they all march out at the manion of his name. And he's everything. He's everything to me. He's everything. He's everything to me. He's my father, my mother, my sister, and my brother. He's everything to me. Oh yes, he's everything. He's everything to me. He's everything. He's everything to me. He's my father, my mother, my sister, and my brother. He's everything to me. Oh yes, he's everything. [Music] everything to me. He's everything. He's everything to me. He's my father, my brother, my sister, and my brother. He's everything to me. Let's just sing that song. Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that name. As we prepare to go to the throne of grace, I'm just going to ask brother Norm Wood if you'd come and lead us to the throne of grace. I don't have no written requests this morning, but we are a needy people and we know that God supplies our need. Praise God. Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that name. Oh, Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's just something about that name. Master, Savior Jesus, like a fragrance after the rain. [Music] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Let all heaven and earth proclaim. Kings and kingdoms will all pass away. Yet there's nothing about that. As brother Norm comes, let's just sing that in worship once more. Oh Jesus, Jesus. Jesus. There's something about that day. master save Jesus like the rain and the rain. [Music] Oh hallelujah &gt;&gt; Jesus Jesus Jesus let all heaven and earth proclaim kings and kingdoms will all pass away but something about that day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just hold your request before the Lord. The Lord Jesus is very present and very near. God bless you, brother Noah. If I may just add a couple more things that testimony I couldn't write down. Um when she went there, of course, the doctor took the sugar number. It was off her scale. So at that point she says, "I should send you to the hospital, but I'll give you an hour. You take this insulin and if it's not done an hour, are you going to go?" Well, it did drop. And then um you know, she's given the ultimatum. Okay. And if it you come back in a week and if it's not good, you're not going to Hawaii either. So that was a bit of a bombshell. But um anyways, it worked. Come back in a week. It was dropped down lower than what she's ever been at. Even with insulin before, she'd never been able to get to these numbers. And then Friday morning, which is uh 2 weeks and a day after she'd been in there, it was under seven. She'd never ever been there. Probably 20 25 years, something like a long long time since she was a much younger person. Anyways, the Lord took care of it all. And um you know, I think it's just the Lord doing it. I mean, there's insulin for sure, but she never been able to get to these numbers with the insulin before. So, the Lord had to be undertaking. So, anyways, God bless you. Thanks again for your prayers. And let's just ask the Lord now to be with us. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your grace, your mercy, and Lord, truly it is your name, Lord, that makes the devil tremble. And we've seen that again in our lives and in the church, Lord, have you undertaken for different souls. And we thank you for that, Lord. We ask now that you'd be in our midst that you might continue to forgive us, Lord, where we fail you and do things a miss, have maybe wrong thoughts. We just ask you'd help us rise above those things. Ask now you'd be in a ministry, be with the brother, bringing the word, Lord, just anoint them that we could hear the words of life and that it would change our lives, Lord, and just be a benefit to us. We ask you to just be with us, be in our midst, Lord, be with the tithes that are offerings that are taking up this morning. May just bless the hands that give richly those that are not able to. Father, just be in our midst. We pray now on the balance of the service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Appreciate that so much. Just thank the Lord Jesus. As I take up the tithe and offering this morning, you have your seats. Let's uh sing that little chorus. Oh, how I love Jesus. There is a name I love to hear. There is a name I love to hear and I love to sing. It's worth it like the music in my ear. the sweetest saint. [Music] Oh, sing it to him. Oh, how I love Jesus. [Music] Oh, how I love Jesus. How I love Jesus because we love me. We're going to have a special and those that will be doing this special will just get ready. We'll sing the second verse and the chorus again. It tells the Savior's love who died to set me free. He carous. [Music] Oh, I love Jesus. Oh, I love Jesus. [Music] Because he'll sing verse three. It tells me what my father [Music] I so bad sun shine all the way. Oh, how I love Jesus. [Music] Oh, how I love Jesus. How I love Jesus [Music] because first of [Music] I know what my f on. I know not what my future holds. Lord, I have no way of knowing, but I know the one who holds my future. And I have no fear of where I'm going. Sometimes it seems like I'm standing still until I [Music] look back and see how deep my valley, how high the hill And each step nearer to eternity, I know not what my future holds. Lord, I have no way of knowing. But I know the one who holds my future. And I have no fear [Music] of where I'm going. Sometimes my friends misunderstand me cuz I hear the sound of a different drummer. But I know my life [Music] is in his hands. Just as sure as autumn follows summer. I know not what my future holds. Lord, I have no way of knowing, but I know my love. Who holds my future, and I have no fear of where I'm going. I know not what my future holds. Lord, I have no way of knowing. But I know the one who holds my future. And I have no fear [Music] of where I'm going. [Music] And I have no fear of where I'm going. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And we'll just invite our pastor to come at this time and let's just sing that song together. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. Let's stand together. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood now flows through my veins. And I who was wretched and vile now can sing. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, I'm a child of the king. Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king. His royal blood now blows through my face and died who was wretched and th now can sing. Praise God. Praise God. Oh, I'm a child of the king. I'm amazed that he loves me.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] and my sins are all washed away all my [Music] father we are for this day that you've given us and the counsel that you've left us &gt;&gt; the words that you've spoken to us we I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that you will take and uh have control of the speaker and the hearers. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Too many wires. Amen. Good to look down into your faces today. And uh we're going to go directly to the word. So thank you musicians. I have a very different type of a service today. So uh I want to include everyone in a very special way. And this is more of a lesson. Uh there's something that I've observed over the years and that is people come to church and they hear a message. The message has a content, has a beginning, has an end quite often an appeal to the people or the needy at the end. But there's one thing that I have seen that is uh missing as far as the message itself is concerned. The message and the messenger are is a it's a dispensational and by saying dispensational that involves the economy of a season that in involves events within a season and it involves all of that time that's involved in what is termed as an age and brother Brennham refers to the age and I want to if we miss that element within the message you essentially miss really what the message is all about and I feel that there are people especially uh young people and children and all of us so I'm going to include us all in this uh particular time so I have asked for God's help and I'm going to try to move along as as quickly as possible. Um, and I don't want you to look upon this as a just a service and you listening and hearing and the people gathered and me speaking. I don't want you to get that. I've got I've got a lot of slides. I'm going to try to tie the whole season together. The age of the Leodysans. Uh, I'll just have you have your seats for a moment. Keep your Bibles ready. I'm going to do something different just now. Brother Brandham said that the Leodysain church age began about 1906. So I will ask all of those that were born from 1900 to 1950 to stand. All right. You notice I'm standing also. Now you remain standing. Then I'll have 1950 to 2000 stand. All right. Now, the younger ones from 2000 to October 2016, I'll have you stand. You've been born during that time. I don't think there's anyone here standing or there's anyone still seated. So I think that the message actually refers to all of us and the events. So you might think, oh well that was long time ago. No, no, I don't think so. I think that it involves you. And uh I'm going to read now some uh some scripture, but I'm going to put it up on the on the screen. and unto the angel of the church of the Leodyans write these things. So now this is a letter that is from God sent through John to the angel or the messenger and that's none other than brother Brennham and I'll we'll be able to declare that there's abundant we've had services here services you've heard on the vindication the vindication the vindication E even if you heard it once, if God just vindicated it once, that should be sufficient for all of you. &gt;&gt; So this letter came from God by the Holy Spirit. And the last scripture we will read, we will read this the the scripture to the church of the Leodysans is not a very nice one, but it gives a tremendous and wonderful invitation at the end. &gt;&gt; And then it says that we should hear what the spirit saith to the church. So it's not John, it's not brother Brandham, it's not any person, it's not the preacher standing behind the pulpit. You are to hear what the Holy Spirit is saying to the church and then the events that took place. I intend to by God's help to uh just tie together some of the events. Now I I tried this out on one or two people mostly my wife just to see what their reaction is. And do you know that the events there's one thing that is outstanding about this age? The events are just incredibly fast. Incredibly fast. They're merging one with another scarcely. one is over and the other one is coming in. The brother Brandham said that the age started about 1906. He was born in 1909. 3 years later, 1914, he's just a boy and that's just a few years has gone by just a very few years and the first world war has happened. And it happened the first world war happened because uh his name was France Ferdinand of in Sievo which you might think of just being Sievo was one one of the winter Olympics was there it was in I don't know whether it's Bosnia is it Bosnia now Sievo is in Bosnia but it was s and so war was declared on Serbia. Brother Milco came from Yugoslavia which involved all of that area at that time. And uh and that was the first world war. It was a brutal war. My wife is standing back there. Her daddy was in that war. He was in the trenches. She just read a letter that he had written and he had a comp there was a company of people. He became a sergeant and he looked around at one time and he was the only one standing. They were all all killed. Uh these things were not funny times. &gt;&gt; These things were not joyous times, but they're real times. This happened. &gt;&gt; It's happened in your age, Leodysian age. And then that war was over in uh November of uh 1918 and the Roaring 20s started. And the Roaring 20s were a was a hilarious time of liberation of the people making vast amounts of money. And then came the 1929 crash and people leaped out of buildings in New York and other places and destroyed themselves, committed suicide for the loss of the trillions of dollars. And that was the roaring 20s. That's barely over. In fact, as I hardly think it is over and the depression starts and the Great Depression, we'll just I'm going to show you clips of slides and I won't get into some of the brutality of it all. I just feel it would be too harmful for our perhaps our young people. Didn't even leave me feeling very happy. And then the great depression and and then the second world war commences and the second world war ends with a incredible cloud of destruction. And that cloud is barely gone. And that war of second world war is just beginning. And while it's beginning and in the midst of it is an incredible persecution on one people, mostly one people called the Jews. And while they're being driven back home during the same time, God now has released and loosed a messenger, the messenger to the Leodysian church. He's released him and begins uh a a indisputable indescribable and indisputable irre just indisputable ministry of healing and miracles. &gt;&gt; That he's going to call this age and the people of this age which you are all standing. He's going to call them to be accountable for what you did, what I did with this message. &gt;&gt; And he releases this message with he himself standing at the platform and the messenger saying until he comes &gt;&gt; I can't do anything. Right? &gt;&gt; It's him &gt;&gt; from another dimension, from another realm, a breath away that's going to call the people of this age to be accountable. &gt;&gt; In other words, what did you do with it? &gt;&gt; And you folks that are here this morning are going to be doubly accountable because I have I have felt so oppressed and to lay this out this way. And then Israel is born. And that's a birth, a new birth for them while a new birth is being announced to a bride of Jesus Christ. And I end up with Israel being chopped. Brother Brandham says, chopped from the nations at the same time he's chopping a bride from the denominations. &gt;&gt; It is really incredible. And I think that you will be benefited by this. I'm reading now. You have here Revelation 3:14. And we'll continue to read. I know thy works that thou art neither hot uh nor co nor hot. I would thou art cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, this was the message of the church. Was he popular? Of course any messenger was going to say this couldn't be popular. And neither cold nor hot. I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold ti tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes have that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and I I would say that he is doing that even this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even all as I also overcame, and am sat down with my father in his throne. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. God bless his word to us. You may be seated. I'm going to just interject before the slides. I'm going to interject the scripture that actually was inspired to me to uh come to this message in this direction. Uh in Moses time, he went up and we uh all know of the account. It's in Exodus actually 32. Don't turn to it. I'm just going to uh be referring to some scriptures out of it later on if I have time. But Moses, he was now he's the first prophet because the people had said don't we don't want to hear directly from God anymore. It was too fearful. So you go and you hear from him and then you come and tell us what he said. So now that's the first instance that God begins to speak and he said there's been no man like Moses. I spa I spake to him um mouth to ear and and then Moses was on the mountain receiving the words from God himself and he comes down the mountain with Joshua his servant and he hears uh all the sound and and uh it's a sound and and there's a confusion about the sound. Well, it sounds like victory. And and uh there's a sound down there Joshua sang. And Moses speaks to him said, "No, this is not the sound of anyone that's rejoicing from a victory, and this is not the sound of those that have been overcome." And they got down, and they they had made the golden calf, and they were uh having realry and so on. And there's some confusion a little bit. Perhaps I can straighten out if the Lord will help me. Uh concerning the sound. And it says, "And they they were naked and they rose up to play and so on and so forth, eating and drinking and making marry." And uh but when the the word that is used, the Hebrew word that Aaron had made them naked is that they were leaderless. They Moses Moses was on the mountain getting the word from God and they now were without a leader and uh they they had gone to gone to Aaron the people and here's where I get the message now. We the people I'm speaking on. We the people. That's why I had you stand so you could give testimony to yourself. We the people are the people of Leodysa. This age of this age all of these things happened not maybe in my time of life but in the age. And God says he sent a messenger to the age. Now and then the people said to Aaron what's happened to this prophet we don't know. got people like that today. And then they said, "Make us gods." They they want something physical, something we can hang on to, something we can see with our eyes. So they were reverting back to the senses which God had only given them by the natural birth had given us senses to contact this world. I feel this. It feels like wood. I look at it. It is wood. as far as I can see. And so, you know, I look at you and I see you in the body that you're in. But like the prophet of God said, "We don't really see each other. You have never seen me. I've never seen you. The real you. That's the That's the one that you have difficulty describing. You you're you're able to have emotions in that next realm. Th this physical realm touches the physical world and that we are living in. But then there's another realm that's beyond that. And we have emotions and we have feelings that are impossible to describe. And then we h we we can have grief that goes even beyond a h human ability to to tell anybody. And we have feelings. Uh you've been married. Many of you are married and you you have partners, but you can't you can't fully describe what you perhaps go through or how you feel or the depth of your love or the depth of your devotion. You love the Lord. You come to church. So there has to be another place. There has to be another birth. This one I have a I didn't I I wasn't able to bring it. Anybody got an iPhone? Who's got an iPhone here? Nobody. You got one? I've got an iPad and it's got the Apple on front and the Apple's got a bite out of it. All the slides that I'm going to show you is because of the bite. And you and I sitting here in these bodies that are not getting younger, by tonight you'll be older, that's also because of the bite. And uh uh the the the computer that I have, it's it's very very useful and I get very frustrated if it's not working right. and I call brother Aaron, my hard disk minister, and and he fixes everything up or Michael, one of the two, and they're the IT guys, and we have some experts here. Uh, and so they get things fixed up, and then and then the knowledge starts flowing again. And I can get Wikipedia or I can find how to spell a word correctly or I can find a country or I can find a city. I can find people uh generally and so I don't want to take up too much time with that but uh that's the knowledge part of it but there's also a bad part of it &gt;&gt; there's a bad part it it it happens to be from a tree of good and evil &gt;&gt; and we all are experience that. So we live in a world there's some nice things and there's some advancements and so on so forth but you'll always find and the prophet will say it so clearly there's always he said what is science got in store for you more death &gt;&gt; that just happens to be the truth I don't care whether you uh agree with that doesn't make any difference but there's more death associated with it we got our cars out there we're happy for and we're going to drive home or go someplace and uh it's fine. But that's not the answer. We get into an aircraft as they did people in Chicago day before yesterday I guess it was and the right engine blew into flames and they all got out but just got out and the plane was going to explode if it got to the fuel. So anyway, there's evil attached with everything and in this body which came from the first bite uh which was a sexual thing. We weren't born in the right way. That's why you have to be born again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thank God that we have known more clearly through the messenger &gt;&gt; what it is to be born again, &gt;&gt; born of the spirit, born of the word. Amen. And in this account in in Exodus, the people the people rose up and said, "Make us gods. We don't know what's happened to this Moses. We don't know what's happened to this prophet. Make us make us God's. Make us something that we can see. So now this will be an answer for many of you. Just listen very closely. Now that's why even in the age of the message in the message churches I'll just call them message gatherings because people are not in the message it's the message which is Christ the person in the individual &gt;&gt; and until that happens it's not a message church &gt;&gt; but there are those that are associated and have associated themselves They they like the standards of it. They like how the young people are to respect their parents and husbands and their relationship with their wife and so on so forth. And it's just good. It's better class of things. And so they they associate themselves with it because of the benefits. That's not it. It's it is a relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That is what is necessary. And so there are people that uh they they need somebody they need a person. They they want somebody physical or they want something physical and doctrines will maybe a brother will in the message and I may be uh uh I may I'm stretching it myself a wee bit now could be misunderstood but I'm I'm I want you to receive this. people get a a certain maybe a it's or we always attach revelation to it because that's a word nice word and we all understand it. So they get a revelation or they think they see something in the message and probably do and then voom it goes way off. goes spiraling way out of control and all kinds of doctrines to support of things that are happening. What it really is is the people of we the people we and Mo and and Aaron said to Moses, "Don't be angry with me. Don't let your wrath wax hot against me." He said, "You know, the people &gt;&gt; they the people are uh they wanted something they wanted something physical &gt;&gt; because they hadn't really got the message of God." &gt;&gt; And here Moses was coming down with the words that God had actually inscribed himself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And while they were waiting, they had to have something physical. So there are men that have been in the message. They are I would say uh perhaps highly visible people. And I can I can speak this because right as of this moment I am being called because people are becoming I'm talking to you now as a family. People are becoming rather uh desperate. They they feel they got to have somebody that was with the prophet. And if we can just have him, he doesn't have to speak. Even if he's just visible here in his presence here. So this last week or few days I have had calls and incredible incredible pressure from Africa, Malawi, from Nigeria, a whole a representative was in Florida, the whole council of ministers. Please come call yesterday from Mexico City. Uh we're having a convention. It is a 60th or 70th anniversary of the message in Mexico City. We're having it at Easter and we want you and brother Billy Paul to come. Well, those are probably maybe two of the last remaining eyewitnesses of things and uh and and I told them I said I'm past 82. I I can't do these kind of long trips anymore. And it's just like I didn't say anything. They're just waiting for that and want you to pray about it and expect you to be there and so on and so forth. I'm not saying that it doesn't mean something. Of course, it means something to them. But uh there's a time when there was a time when brother Brandon left. I thought if he left everything ended. I thought the only thing to do would be to run across the country and just scream it's over. That's what I thought at that time. But then there was a uh uh Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Then there was a urgency. What about the people that don't speak English or speak French or speak clearly and don't understand what the messenger said? So I was gripped very very early when this church was in the log church back maybe yet in the house. People have to get these tapes and they have to get to hear what this message is all about. And that's what you have been busy with and we've been busy with all of these years. But when Moses said to Aaron, "What did you do?" He said, "Well, the people are given over to mischief and that's and and then when they were eating and drinking and that, you know, they're having fellowship and hilarity and and it was almost a mocking sort of thing. That's what it finally reduced down to." And they were kind of mocking, I guess, their own conviction. I don't know. And the and the Bible says that they were made naked. They, in other words, they didn't have any leadership anymore. No one had actually led them into that. He said, so Aaron said, "So I just told them to break off the earrings and things." In other words, they had the substance to make God very angry. They had that potential. And they broke off their earrings. And Aaron says one place, it says one place in chapter 32 that he graved the the molten calf. Then it says uh and Aaron was repeating he said and so the I told the people break off the earrings and they threw the earrings into the fire and out came this calf. He couldn't really tell how it developed and that's exactly what happens. There's doctrines that have swept into the message. You heard them. Maybe some of you been touched by it. I've studied them. I've studied most of them because I I didn't want to I I'm listening to and being influenced by what the prophet of God says. And he says that error can be 99% true. So I am desiring to know the truth. But I want to know if they stayed with what the messenger said. &gt;&gt; And then some perhaps go in a fanatical way of every last, you know, every last word. And if he made a mistake or he said seven thou 700 instead of 7,000 or he said something, oh that's somehow it just does away with the message. What nonsense? &gt;&gt; Because I stutter or fumble around. And brother Brandham's a human. &gt;&gt; He He's got a He's got a human body that wears out. &gt;&gt; He's got a human body that he pulled back from the ministry &gt;&gt; for a season. &gt;&gt; You understand? People have certain convictions. &gt;&gt; He said, "If we have a meeting and we're not able to pay for it, then we just stop." Well, you might say, "Well, where was this faith?" And God is going to provide if the message is from God. You know, you can't figure God out. &gt;&gt; Nobody here can figure God out. And one thing that people make a huge error in this day, and I've they've done it right in this church, and that is that they try to put a timeless God into a time slot. &gt;&gt; You can't do that. The message, the message when it comes from God, the message, it can't be put into just a 24hour time frame. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; All right. What I want you to see now in the next few moments is the events. And I want you to absorb the events. These are some of them are catastrophic. Some of them are still have hang over the world with a a just a heavy heavy atmosphere because there are even things we don't want to remember. You might as well remember them is your age. That's why you stood up. So he said that the age uh started about 1906. Now by 1914, here's what's going on. They're marching in the streets. Then they're in the trenches. This the first world war. In fact, this let's put it in the messengers language. This is the first birth pain. &gt;&gt; That's right. and they had gas and then they went to the trenches and my wife's daddy, my father-in-law, was in these trenches and we went to them on Vimeie Ridge. If you ever go get over to Belgium and in France and that area, you want to see Vimemy Ridge. They have about a 100 ft statue of a mother and she's looking over the valley and in the trenches. And we went into the trenches and the Canadians at that at that one point and the Americans were in another area and the Canadians were fighting there and the Germans 30 40 yards apart yards meters and sometimes only gain a few meters in a day. and they've left the soil how it was bombed and it was just craters everywhere and uh the German troops were very well fortified. In fact is I had a lot of respect for one German comedant who sent a man out of their trenches. They're looking at each other. sent a man out of their trenches with a white flag and came to the Canadian trench and said, "May I see your common dant?" And he said, "My common dant says, we shall have a truce. You have so many men that are wounded and also killed in between the trenches." just maybe maybe 50 60 70 up to 100 meters. And he said, "We will cease fighting for uh for a day and we'll help you bring your men back." And so they all worked together, the Canadian troops and the US troops, I should say, the Canadian troops and the German troops in this case. And they helped carry the men back to the Canadian trenches so they could get first aid and hospitals and etc. And the trenches were sometimes two and three stories deep. They had hospitals and kitchens and food and everything in there. And it was really a a bitter bitter bitter and uh something that we don't like. We have all our letters from my father-in-law that he was writing home. So we've been close to that. We've been touched. We're in this Leodysian age. This is an event that happened started in 1914, ended four years later or five right at the end of uh 1918. And this statue that they have is on a white marble. They said it's the only marble that there is no more marble like that. And a Toronto uh architecture uh sculpture I should say from Toronto. And I stood beside that woman. She's about 100 ft in the air. And her she draped with a cloak. She's holding a bouquet of flowers and they're just hanging down by her side and she's looking like this down over where her sons have given their lives. That's a part of our history. You think, "Oh, that's a long time." No, it's not very long ago. &gt;&gt; You've got people here. I might say some things, which I will. My wife, the mother of my daughters and a spiritual mother to many of you, she always wondered about, I shouldn't say always wondered, but at certain times wondered about not her salvation, but when the prophet of God says, "You're a gene of God." And I, as her husband, I felt so impressed to preach that. And I stayed on that subject. And one day she said to me after the service, I got it. It's over. And she realized, she said, I realized that my father when he had his comrades and his colleagues and his buddies dropping beside him, she said, "And he would walk out. He was wounded, but he walked out. She said, "He could not perish because I was still in him." &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, an experience like that helps you realize the reality &gt;&gt; of a prophet saying, "And we needed that message. &gt;&gt; Needed somebody to come and say, as you were in the loins of your father, &gt;&gt; so were you in the loins of God. That's not some poetic license. That's not just some fancy words. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're in the loins of God. &gt;&gt; And a seed from God came out to give you a new birth. &gt;&gt; You had a new birth, but you discovered it. And so, and so it was. And so, they go from the trenches to some of the wounded. And the war was over. And now the depression starts. I'm sorry. Uh then yeah, we got somehow uh then the roaring 20s came and then the collapse in 1929 and then starts the depression. This is a school. All of you in that are in school, there's a teacher there and uh a mother in the kitchen. uh lined up to get some soup. My father-in-law sold entire entire hay racks of hay or I should say he bought entire hay racks of hay for 50 cents and didn't have the 50 cents to pay for it. And I met the people that sold it to him and they said, "So we waited till he could pay it. That's our world. Well, you got money in your pocket. &gt;&gt; That money may not be worth very much. &gt;&gt; You can have an absolute collapse. &gt;&gt; And there are people who are smart people who are predicting that. I'm not predicting it. I'm not here to predict that. I'm not here as a politician, but this is this is the real world. They lined up. I think this was in Chicago or someplace. And then the during this time they're trying to find work. So they have the only way they couldn't buy gas and didn't have cars. And so they're hitching rides on the railway. There's a couple there. Why can't you give my dad a job? Boy sang because there isn't work either. Then the dust storms, incredible dust storms after all of this uh or during all of these things and then the commencement of World War II. And here, this actually was a dust storm. I want to get it before that. That's one of the dust storms coming. And this is another dust storm. It literally blew the soil that could bear a crop, blew it off. I know with those kind of winds, you think God knew anything about it? They couldn't grow things and they didn't have seed and they didn't have anything to eat. And those were tough times. And now I come to my time. I stood and watched my father, my dad, cuz he want had two children to feed and a wife. And he's peeling ties that are under the railway for 10 cents a tie. But he was happy to have work. And then he got work. That's the only two jobs I know that he had. He had the second job was in an alalfa plant cleaning the bags and made enough to so we could eat and then would start the second world war. There's a load of US troops there. They are heading for the beaches. This is some of the cities that have been bombed out. Now we're This is La Le Oia. And technologies advancing. They've gone from gas to be able to make bombs and larger bombs and larger bombs until they have a cloud. And that is part of it all well as well taken from the ground and that's what was left the next morning. There's a man surveying it. And there's two US officers at uh maybe Flanders Fields. That's a different kind of a cloud. And when they were there, I'm going to just show you some clips slides. Now, you need to see this. If you haven't seen it, you need to see it. You need to see it in relationship to a message. Message I'm looking down into your faces that God sent you &gt;&gt; and he allowed this to happen for a certain reason. And during this time when these people were suffering this incredible, who's going to describe this? &gt;&gt; Who's going to say what's in that man's heart? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's a real person. &gt;&gt; Got feelings like you, like me, maybe had a family. I don't know. I don't know anything about it. But at this time they were far too gruesome and I wouldn't show you. I have I have a volumes of the books that detailed the building of the concentration camps. And I never heard and neither did you hear any person say when millions of people were going to the gas chambers to have a man stand an intelligent man stand behind the pulpit and say it was the hand gracious hand of Jehovah. How could you say that? I personally was in a I can't say a state of shock, but my mind couldn't work around it. The tender hand of Jehovah. Listen folks, this is your message. This is a letter, a letter been sent from God. Hear what the spirit says &gt;&gt; to the church. How can you go through Ashwitz for example which I have and stand in front of the crematorium. Forget about the people or putting blame anywhere. And I said to uh Gishon Solomon that had spoke here, drove him to the ABC motel down the street and his wife is just opening the door to the motel and I'm still sitting with him in the car and I'm talking to him about God sent us a prophet. I had already told him that I guess but I was saying you know our prophet said when you people when your nation was going through it wasn't a nation yet was going through the Holocaust and the Jews were being slain literally slaughtered genocide by the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands until your mind cannot grasp it anymore. I said, "Our prophet said it was a tender hand of Jehovah." And he just looked down at the glove box and he said, "It's something that my wife," and I just looked out the window and she was opening the door, glass door. She said, "It's something that's so hard for her." Said, "It's so hard for her." I said, "And our prophet said it was the tender hand of Jehovah because it was driving you back to Israel and God cannot bless the Jew outside of Israel." And he just said, "That is right." Listen friends, if you want to if you want to hear it, it's it's a it's one of the stronger messages. I will say recognizing your day &gt;&gt; in its message. I'm saying what I'm saying today and showing the slides that I am to say this all happened in Leodya. &gt;&gt; This all happened. under the message message that the messenger which was sent to our time and the people of this time and we've got to do more than just go to a church that we identify as a message church. That's not the point. &gt;&gt; The the purpose of this church is to see that you get the person this the word was made flesh again. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message came in such a way it's not a bunch of words like you hear &gt;&gt; at some other church. Is this different? Absolutely different. Not because I'm saying it because because we have been sent a message and we take it as a personal responsibility. Are you with me? And during this time then happens another type of cloud and another type of cloud that is all making reference to a message. In fact, is I was with brother Brandham when he talked about this pillar of fire coming into this auditorium at the arena at the Sam Houston, Texas in Houston, Texas. He was relating that and he was up in the balcony. He didn't want to come down. He didn't want to be part of the uh debate. And uh brother, what's his name? the tall brother that was with him all the time &gt;&gt; that took the debate. &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; Bossworth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Bosworth. Brother Bosworth. Brother Bosworth said to brother Brandham, "I would like to take the debate." And he didn't want. He said, "As long as there's no debate about the scriptures as such." No. No. He said, "There won't." He had another plan. Brother Brandham said he was up in the balcony and he said he just felt like a little voice, a little urge to go down because the debate was over in a in a few minutes. And the debate was over because of this. Are you all listening now? Don't be distracted. Brother Bosworth said to Reverend Best, the Baptist minister, "You can go first." No, no, he says, "You go first." Because the one who goes first doesn't get the last last 10 minutes to speak. So, I think it was 10 minutes. So, Brother Bosworth got up and he said, "I have one question I would like to ask Reverend Best. I'd like him to answer it yes or no. The question was, is the seven redemptive names of Jehovah in the Old Testament, does it refer to Jesus Christ? Yes or no? If he said no, it would mean that he was not Jehovah's savior. If he said yes, it would mean that he also was Jehovah Rapha, Jehovah healer. &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't answer it. and the and the committee handed the debate down to brother Bosworth and that caused some strife and trouble there and that's where the picture was taken and brother Brandham said he felt a little voice just say urging him because the people had come for a meeting and the whole service was over and so he went down and he went up the steps and and he's standing at the pulpit. In fact, is I'm sorry you don't see all of the picture because brother Brandham actually is holding a small piece of paper, very small piece of paper in his hand. It is just a little piece of white paper and it's about about this size and he's holding in his hand like this. And he said, "It is true." Brother Bam said to me, he said, he was saying to the people, "It is true that an angel from God did speak to me." He was just referring to the angel. And then he said, "Just a moment, he of whom I speak is now here." And this light moved down the audience and came and hung where you see it there. And it was Reverend Best's photographer who he had had come because he said, "I want you to take my picture when I have my finger at William Brandham's nose in front of his nose in front of his face declaring him a fraud." And it was his photo photographer photographer rather that took this picture. And that's why this picture went to George J. G. Lacy or George J. Lacy for examination. That's the kind of cloud I want to follow. &gt;&gt; This cloud did not come to bring death. Came to bring life. This didn't come to injure people. Came to heal people. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health thee. &gt;&gt; That's the cloud. &gt;&gt; Now, you that are high-tech people, one thing that you do get and you that aren't high-tech, you get upgrades all the time. I said, "When will Microsoft end upgrading? When will these people ever end up upgrading? I got reams of upgrades. And then my uh computer, you need to restart it and reboot it. This word has been here a long time. &gt;&gt; And God never had to upgrade it. &gt;&gt; Not one time. &gt;&gt; Back in the beginning, the tithing was 10%. &gt;&gt; It's still 10%. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can't the people say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're just excited, Brother Biscuit." You better get excited. &gt;&gt; This is probably the most glorious thing that ever has happened. &gt;&gt; Got a book that never needed to be upgraded. And while this was taking place, the Jews were returning. The tender hand of Jehovah in motion. Incidentally, that's a Hagena ship. That was one of the kind of the renegade uh groups, breakaway groups. And there's another boat. They got stopped by the British and sent to Cyprus after all of the suffering, all of the incredible suffering and lost their homes and lost their possessions, lost everything. Rings on their finger and their clothes and hair, toothbrushes, combs. dehumanized and scentlike. And the prophet said in recognizing your day in this message, he said they drove, they were driven back. They were herded back. The wolves the wolves chased them. The wolves tore at them and chased them until they established their own to the protection of their own land, their own country. Here they're pulling them to shore in the water. They walked. This is over the Alp Mountains. walking from Europe to Israel. Tell you what, friends, I wish that there was more of that spirit driving &gt;&gt; us with that kind of urgency to church. &gt;&gt; God sent me a message. &gt;&gt; I have a chance to go to church and hear &gt;&gt; something of what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, my car won't work. Or come on, &gt;&gt; I'm ready to climb over the Alps. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to walk through the snow. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to do whatever I need to do. I'm going to hear what the messenger said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they walked and I thought they're still in their concentration prison guard and one is uh I guess not washing his feet but soaking them. Israel has become a nation. itself. The oldest nation in the world, the oldest flag in the world has their own nation, their own flag, their own army, their own money and everything else. The mis mysterious of how that bunch of Jews persecuted everywhere and turned out and run out and thrown out like the church down through these ages of rejection. And yet Jesus said, "When you see the fig tree putting forth its buds, that nation returning back to be a nation again, the time is at hand, even at the door." Israel is already a nation. She is established now with her armies, navy, postal system, flag, and all that pertains to nationhood. But there's still to be uh fulfill the scripture that says a or shall a nation be born at once. Isaiah 66 and8 that day is coming soon. The fig tree has put forth her buds. The Israelites are waiting for the Messiah. They are expecting him and their expectation are about to be fulfilled. Israel be reborn spiritually for her light and her life are about to be revealed to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said though through Hosea I have heeded. Now watch Israel he's talking to I have heed or in other words I have chopped chopped them out through the prophets. That's how God does his people. He chopped them out from the rest of the nations. What? By his two-edged sword, his word. He chopped them. His nation from the nations. He chopped his nation from the nations. By the prophets, his vindicated word. So has he chopped his bride from the denominations? By his word promised by Malachi 4. in the last day chopped out his bride, hewed her from the rest of the churches, hewed out his bride. This is where some people maybe I don't know if you're here this chopping. God is not he was not slack in hewing his people. There was a man I spoke to in Israel. His name was Hama, I believe it was. He was the originator of a kibuts. And I said, "Kaman," that was his name. And I said, "How how is it that you came here to Israel?" He said it was 1939 be just before the war just as it started. He said and my father I was one of four sons. My father had a successful tailoring business. And he said and I was the eldest son. The tailoring business would fall to me. But he said something within me was sending me back here to Israel. And I I have come back here and became one of the originators of this caboots in uh in in Galilee. And we stayed there actually and I got to know him and we went and he showed me the dairy, showed me the farm, showed me the the whole kabuts and the children and the school and so on. And I was I was uh quite affected by it. And I had a little bit of a debate uh with him about it because I thought that maybe we treated our children better. And uh before I was done talking to him, I can see they spend more time with their children than the parents do in this day and age with their children. And uh I was I was really quite affected by it. So he said, "And and then we have been chopped out." If you ever are inclined to think that this message has caused you to suffer, I say think it again. If you think that maybe a a code of dress or a code of living or anything, I just want to say to this church, there's nobody here that is really suffering. The kind of suffering &gt;&gt; I'm talking about suffering. &gt;&gt; You haven't lost family. You haven't lost friends. You haven't lost, you know, God is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And however he feels to do things, we say yes. &gt;&gt; His way is the right way. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? and since that time since that time but I I would like you to just see if you'd see the continuity God taking the natural church Israel the natural the natural nation and the spiritual sending a message to a group of people to chop them out. Chop them out from wherever they were. And God could not be handle you with kid gloves. Some of you have come from very very distant places and I don't want to even enter into a personal personal testimony but I stand here as a witness to this message. I have not known what it is to have a bedroom of my own or a room of my own. I've not known that I lost my mother when I was 6 and 1/2, 7 years old and moved and moved and moved and lived in camps and lived in other people's homes and was more like a native person just drifting from one camp to another, one place to another. I can tell you one thing. God's way is perfect. &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't trade it for anything. &gt;&gt; You could be brought up in a king's palace and that would be perfectly fine. You could have little or nothing and that would be perfectly fine. You could have abundance of material things and that would be fine. But I want to I want to uh just say to you, do we have a few minutes? I have just a a few quotes that tie into everything that I've shown thus far in the in the message invisible union. Brother Bram talked about the pilgrim fathers and I have a question that I want you to be able to go home with. the US Constitution. Now, to our beloved American brothers and sisters, their constitution starts out, we the people, and that's why I use that as a title. We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure uh domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity, our posterity to ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America. That's their constitution. And then uh in uh I think the Declaration of Independence starts out in the name of God. Amen. And then starts the preamble and the preamble to the US Declaration of Independence in 1776. We hold there we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and they are endowed they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. How did we get here? How do we get where we are? I listened to some of the earlier messages and we need the very spirit of God that forced and drove that messenger with uh tirelessly to bring a rugged message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it is to give birth to a rugged people. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; We do not have to have our bread buttered for us. &gt;&gt; God has something that is worthwhile in this life. &gt;&gt; And it's not this, you know, just come breath go breath and if it doesn't happen and if we don't just have everything just right. That's why I have a lot of respect personally for many of our African people because some of you have come out of great suffering. We do not want to be diluted. We don't want to be reduced. When I see the message and I hear the messenger crying out as he does and recognizing your day and your message and he cries out and I know it's in the scripture, the Holy Spirit is commissioning John, write this letter to the messenger. And I even almost cringed because he's screaming at the top of his lungs, you are blind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are naked. &gt;&gt; I just thought I was listening to it last night again. I thought, who can hear that? &gt;&gt; We the people who are predestinated, we can hear it. &gt;&gt; We the people. There's another we the people and that's those that are ordained to eternal life &gt;&gt; and to this word. &gt;&gt; We're not ordained to a church. &gt;&gt; We're not ordained to Cloverdale Bible way. &gt;&gt; We're ordained to eternal life. &gt;&gt; We are the Exodus people. &gt;&gt; He spoke of the Exodus people. We are the people. How did we the people &gt;&gt; do we have to have soft benches or it's too hot, it's too cold, or it's not quite bright enough or the lights are too bright or where are we? &gt;&gt; You people are going to be happy that I only preach once in a while. But I can tell you this message came to foster. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; To foster and bring forth a virgin bride. Do you know that this that these words are strong enough the messenger's words because they were not his words. &gt;&gt; It's thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that thus sayaith the Lord said it's not him saying he doesn't have the power to say you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; You just learn those things. You hear them and we become accustomed to them. You can't you can't just receive those things. A man can't say it. &gt;&gt; But when God says it, &gt;&gt; you're not just forgiven. When you have a father, an eternal father, a heavenly father that says, "I'll annihilate your sin." &gt;&gt; I tell that's the kind of cloud I want to hear from. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of cloud I want to be left with. And he says uh the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their new found way of life being separated from the old English denominations and creed. They could marry to the new anointed word. They could marry to the new I want you to think about that. marry to the new anointed word. For their age. That's right. The new anointed word for their age. The reason I spoke like this to you today is that I had you stand so you'd give testimony to yourself. I'm an individual who this message has been sent to. And I am here called of God to repeat that to you. Not to fluff it, not to make it more palatable, but to let you know that this is your only way out of this age. &gt;&gt; This is your only way that you will get from here to the other side. &gt;&gt; We don't want to die like dogs. We don't want to die. And they think of those people that went to the crematorium and then you have a prophet stand up and say every one of them received white robes. &gt;&gt; They didn't even know it. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that. &gt;&gt; Just think of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, friends, what I'm saying to you, either this message is true or it is the wildest nightmare you could possibly think of. Amen. &gt;&gt; Give me another man that will save 10 million Jews going to the gas chambers and have him stand up and say this is the tender hand of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; You have to you have to account for that. &gt;&gt; That is the message of your messenger declared. &gt;&gt; He didn't invent those things. And if it wasn't from the spirit of God, if it wasn't from God Almighty driving his people back to their homeland, to the safety of their homeland, and at the same time, simultaneously, the message that says those things is coming to another group of people. We just come out of the war. Oh, we've come into and he talks about it himself. And I I've got the quote here. I don't know if I can even find it. And and some are being married to the new word for the age. You girls that have a desire to marry and you young men who have a desire to marry, you have no desire like the people who hear this message say, "I must be united with that word." I don't want to just go and hear a preacher preach and tickle my ears. I want to be united. I must have that come into me. &gt;&gt; I must come. I must become one with him. &gt;&gt; I feel like asking you to forgive me, but on the other hand, I don't feel like asking you to forgive me. This church and the bride of Jesus Christ needs to hear these things. We need to be chopped out of where we are by the two-edged sword of the word of God and united, reunited in a marriage union with Jesus Christ himself, the person, &gt;&gt; so they could marry the new anointed word for their age. a new anointed word for their age, for their day. So can we be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separated ourself from the things of the world? All of our associates, Abraham was a pilgrim. I'm calling you to this pilgrimage. &gt;&gt; Hello, church. I'm calling you to this pilgrimage. &gt;&gt; There are certain ones that I thought of this morning and I'm glad you're here. How did we get here? Are we just going to sit back and let Satan come in with whatever you know he he's Listen friends, he's a slicker. &gt;&gt; And if you think for a minute that you can outwit him, you're sunk. &gt;&gt; You'll never outwit him. He'll use more regulations &gt;&gt; and more laws and things. He'll use the economics. He'll use whatever. &gt;&gt; I don't want to divulge things. But you realize regulations and laws that have just been passed down. Listen, in this country, in this country, in your country, &gt;&gt; right? in the United States of America or the dominion of Canada. Well, I will say it, Brother Kim. You can forgive me. They want this school over here to be transgender. And if you don't cope with it, you may lo your lose your status and perhaps and I have well I've thought about it for some few years. I'm just going to ask you, what are you going to do if they say, "Well, you're going to lose your you either have to bend to the homosexual standards or you lose your society designation. And as such, we can't allow you to give receipts for your giving. You think that this is just some kind of excitement? No. This is the real world. &gt;&gt; That's right where you're headed. &gt;&gt; I might be in I might be gone. I hope I am. &gt;&gt; I hope I I hope I hope we all are gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. But just in case, some of the little things that you've seen, horrible things that you've seen, could be just a kindergarten compared to what they want to do. &gt;&gt; Do you think the enemy Do you think that the enemy of Christ, do you think the enemy of this word has good things all lined up for you? &gt;&gt; Not for a second. So, I'm just trying to prepare you. We have a good friend in Malawi. He had 600 people. How many people have we got here? And the church organizations got together and put the finger on the government and said, "This is what these people are. these are heretics or this or this or whatever more. And the building that they were using, I've been there. I preached to these people. The building that they were using, one group could use it and then the next group could use it. And there was a there was a I think a Pentecostal group that used it just ahead of them always. And when they came to enter, they found a big padlock on the door. and the message books that you hold in your hand thrown out in the ground and their song books and everything thrown out. And a bunch of them were going to be thrown in prison and one sister did go to prison. I only mention her because she gave a birth to a child in prison. She was in it about 30 days. They let most of them out. You know how many people they had the next Sunday? About 150. About 150. I'm asking you fellas, you girls, are you one of the 600 or are you one of the 150? &gt;&gt; That's what I'm asking. What are you a part of? Are you part of what we are here today? God bless you, Sister Patricia. I thought of you this morning. I know what's deep down in your heart. Brother Kim, think these things over. &gt;&gt; I stand with the three Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; I will not bend. &gt;&gt; I will not bow. &gt;&gt; And I will not burn. &gt;&gt; They can heat the fire up as hot as they want to, &gt;&gt; but the son of man will be there. &gt;&gt; There's a God we know. There's a God we understand. &gt;&gt; And if it means persecution or whatever it means, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What do you fellas think about it? &gt;&gt; I'm ask you some serious questions. This is a service you won't forget. I want to say with Moses who's on the Lord's side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You decide that in your own heart and say, "God, I'm resolved." &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Israel. I think of you often. It's not been that easy, but it still may be difficult. We don't know. But I want to say and I'd like to hear the people say, "Whatever the cost, &gt;&gt; the cost, &gt;&gt; we the people, &gt;&gt; we the people." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It's 12:30. Can I just have a few minutes and then I'm going to end? I asked the question a few times this morning. How do we get here? And I want to say this is how the name Leodysia the name is a Leodysian age. The name Leodysia means the people's rights. one of the most politically important and financially flourishing cities in Asia Minor. This Pacific Northwest is is by all standards of the world I would say very very fine place to live. Yes, some of you have hardships. I don't believe and I'm going to speak very personally now. I don't believe that a person is experiencing any hardship if there's anything they can do to survive. Maybe I've said enough. They worshiped one god in Leodysa. And their god was Zeus. He was the father of gods. This forecast, the prophet said, this forecast, the 20th century, one God, father of us all, religious premise that sets forth the brotherhood of man, and is even now bringing together the Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Hindus, etc. with the intent, here's the intent. How did we get here? with the intent that a mutual form of worship will increased our love and understanding and care for each other. This very attitude was seen, this is a prophet speaking now. His very attitude was seen in the United Nations organization when the world leaders refused to recognize any one individual concept of spiritual worship, but recommended putting aside all those separate concepts with the hopes that all religions become leveled into one. For all desire the same goals, all have the same purposes and all are basically right. I say we are not one of them. &gt;&gt; And I want to go on record to say and to emphasize &gt;&gt; we are not one of them. Our form of worship cannot be leveled down &gt;&gt; to the level of the United Nations. They cannot dictate to us what kind of worship we have and how we worship. Who else will talk about another cloud? &gt;&gt; Who else talks about the seals being opened? &gt;&gt; Listen to friends. Those might just be phrases to you, but now I'm talking about events. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I look into the faces of you young men and I I may look stern. I'm not stern. I'm earnest. Very earnest. I don't want anybody in here to say, "Well, that's fine for you to say, brother Bis, you got to get out and get in a fine car." And so on so forth. I want you to know, would you be part of me and my work when you didn't know if you had a milk for your kids in the morning? I could still say we the people. I wasn't intent on giving up. This hand here reached over to my dear sisters listening. This hand reached over to a little promise box and I pulled a a promise box out of there because I I didn't have anything. I was down here in Ever, Washington. And I couldn't I couldn't work cuz I wasn't allowed to work. And I pulled a promise out of the box because I didn't have 25 cents to go and buy my daughter's milk. And the promise box said, "Jehovah Gyra, &gt;&gt; the Lord will provide." &gt;&gt; And I said, "If the Lord will provide, &gt;&gt; then I will go now to the post office." &gt;&gt; But nobody knew I was down there. And I went to the post office and I stood before the wicket or the counter and the man was in front of me and he left. And then I stepped forward and I said, "Do you have any mail for Ed Biscll?" And the post person turned around and reached up to the bees and threw a letter out. It was from my father. I didn't. It had been It had been forwarded. Nobody knew we were there. Nobody knew our condition. And in there was $20 that got us through that difficult time. I say I say fine, we're here now on, you know, we have all of these things. Yeah. So I come to church Wednesday and Sunday and so on forth. That's not really what God wants to know. That's not what I want to know. Where would you be if there just a few? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to ask you. They that said we the people, &gt;&gt; but they don't want to make that declaration today. You from the United States of America, you know that. That's not what they want to say. They don't want to say we the people. They don't want to start out with in the name of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have no desire for that. That is repulsive to them. I say what is dear to you and it's repulsive to somebody else so be it. &gt;&gt; And we need to take that kind of character and let it build down. Speaking about character, I hope I'm not boring you. But speaking about character, the god of this age, the god of Leodysa, he is so uh merged himself and homogenized himself with technology. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Till you come into a place and the sound has to be just right and emphasized and the lights shining in a certain way. And we must not suffer. We must not have any pain. And we must not have any hardship. And the God of this age has taken and watch now just for a moment. And I'm coming to a close. And he's he's merged together the technology and the sounds of things and the emotions of the inner man, the memories and the imagination. and it's telling you what you could be or where you go to church and will get the sounds and and then then then captures also the uh brother Brandham says you'll have to stay with me now this was a difficult part for me to come to brother Brandham says some people are boisterous some people are really back quiet, laidback, some are dogmatic, some are unexpressive, maybe they're think deep thinkers, etc. And he says, "God made everything for us." He just he said, "I like mountains." Somebody says, "Ah, I wouldn't I I I don't care for mountains. God cleaned out his mortar box when he created the mountains." said, "Well, he said, "He did it for me." Some like the deserts, some like the plains. There are some that are like Peter, impetuous Peter, put his foot up on the railing of the boat and say, "Lord, if that's you, let me come to you." &gt;&gt; And he starts walking on the waves. People say, "Oh, yeah, but he sunk." Yeah, but he stepped out. My goodness, it's wonderful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I'm not lost for words. I'm just trying to cut them back so I don't go on too far. What about Paul? He said he's scholarly. And then Paul said in his day, he said, "Some say we're following this one or we're following that one or we're following somebody else." It's exactly the same today. &gt;&gt; He said, "One sws and one reaps and but God gives the increase." It's God. He was trying to get everybody to see some. And then you say, "Oh, Apostle Paul, what would you do if Apostle Paul was here?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What would you do when Apostle Paul stood up and said, "All men have left me?" &gt;&gt; Think I'd never I'd never leave you, Paul. I don't know. I'm I'm I'm really digging deep. I'm digging deep. So, this church, this congregation of people, I love you, and I think I think you're just the cream of the crop, but I wouldn't want anything to creep in. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want any worm to start eating at the at the heart of it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, you settle in your own mind. You have, you're the one. I can't nip it in the bud. You have to nip it in the bud. &gt;&gt; You have to identify something. I become very I feel that I become very vulnerable because this is going on the internet as well. And Joanne, perhaps you won't mind if I just say this. I have a chair in my office and it's soft and should be redone and should be re covered and so on so forth. Tom, you'll allow me this space. And occasionally I have somebody come in and say, "Well, sit. you can just sit here so I can talk to you. And they sit and they sink down and you know, doesn't look like Could I afford another chair? Yeah, probably could. I said to one of the last brothers that came into my office and I was just looking up a phone number and I said, "Excuse me for that chair. I'm I'm making an apology for the chair." But I said, "You know, I never have covered that chair." I said many years ago, my daughter sat in that chair and I had just detected some little kink in the character. Good. Just a wonderful girl. Never complained. Come to church all the time. sat quiet, listened to the sermon. She had one or two good friends. One was a minister's uh the Anglican minister was next door and his girl was an adopted girl and she was a good friend. And you know, as a father, you're just scanning. As a pastor, you're just scanning. as your fathers and mothers and as elder sisters, you're just scanning and and I had scanned. I thought they can't I can't lay a finger there. She's not a bad girl at all. She's very very good. I had her I called her and she sat as my little office under the stairway and she sat in my chair and I said, "You know, honey," I said, "U, I I've noticed you in church and you've just been real excellent young lady." I said, 'When the Holy Spirit is moving and and when he's moving, do you ever feel a feel a drawing to him? And she kind of pursed her lips and shook her head. I said, "Not even a little tinkle. No. I said, "You know, dear, you're sitting in the chair where daddy prays. I pray in that chair. I talk to God in that chair and God talks to me." I said, "I've noticed just a little something in your character." And I said, "When you get older that could cause you a lot of trouble." And I I saw be and I was digging deep and I saw a tear come down her face. Not because the tear mentioned anything, but I saw a tear coming down her face. She said, "I've tried. I've tried." Maybe you're here. You've tried. You've tried. I've got there. I've tried. I've tried. It's just not real. And the next Sunday was the Sunday morning. We were just in the church in a house. Doesn't have to be a church like this. It was just in a house. And the only me only message I ever published that I did myself that I preached myself was this one. Sinners die alone. That's the only one. And the reason now you'll hear why I published it. And I was I was weeping. I was preaching on the the man at the gate and the angels came and gathered him and took him. And the rich man died alone. And I said he died alone. sinners die alone. And I was weeping and I cried out, Joanne, it's you. And she was sitting at the back on the chair. She shot up out of that chair and ran down to the front. I don't know if she even remembers it. And from that day to this, from that day to this, that's what you see. And what you see is what you got. That is her life, friends. That's the God I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm inviting you to. &gt;&gt; That's the reality that I know. That's the only God I know. That's the only God that's worth our time and worth your time. I would not be trying to persuade you any other way. I know &gt;&gt; this message &gt;&gt; works. &gt;&gt; I know this message is none other than Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and I want to follow him all the way. &gt;&gt; All the way. &gt;&gt; Will you bow your heads? Dear Lord Jesus, dear Lord Jesus, I do not know how further to express what's in my heart. It's it's a mixture of feelings. Such a love for the people, such a love and determination. Oh God, Lord, if we would leave this world, we want to leave it with such a testimony that people would need to say they're committed, completely devoted. God, I pray that you will take this congregation of people, cause their character, cause their witness, cause their life to speak out truth, cause them to be a testimony, a witness of the true vine. Let them be a witness, Lord, that it works. It's a living testimony. It's a living Christ. It's a living life. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus that you'll take the words and chopped up service that we have, but we know whereof we speak. I know the reality. Oh God, you've been so good, so true, so so dependable and reliable. Lord, I pray that you'll prove yourself to everyone here. And I'm going to stop in this moment of prayer to say if you would like to be included in the prayer, if you would just stand to your feet just now, say, "I desire, I hunger after that reality." And I pray father in the name of Jesus Christ that every individual, every person whose beat heart is beating and yearning and responding to your call and your voice. Oh God, I'm so thankful that one day in the honesty and sincerity of my own soul, I found nothing out there that could satisfy and then found you. Oh God, you came to me and now I can say we the people, we the individuals, we've heard your voice. Your prophet has said once a person sees you, they can never be the same. And truly, Lord, we can never be the same. I can never be the same. I needed to see you. I needed to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; And I know that you can speak until a person hears it. Lord, I pray you'll give a special sensor, special hearing to the individuals that are here, gathered here. I do not even know for certain to whom these words were sent, but send them on the wings of the dove of the Holy Spirit. Send them and flutter over the hearts, oh God. flutter over the soul where there needs to be a determination. Oh God, let there come a resolve that only can come from the throne of God. As Jesus, you set your face towards Calvary, towards Jerusalem, and nothing and no one, even your closest friends, even your own disciples could not change your direction. You were headed for Calvary. You're headed for paying the price for my redemption. How I thank you. Father, I thank you. Oh, I want to give you praise before this congregation of people. I want to give this praise to you. You are so gracious and so so loving and caring. Oh God, there's none like you. There's none like you. Lord Jesus, I pray for the people. I pray for those that are hungering a life of reality, [Music] something special. Pray that you will do it, Lord, in Jesus' name. Could we sing? Only you Lord only you. Only you Lord only you. Only you. Only you. [Music] Only you. Only you. You're the fountain. [Music] I run to only you, Lord. [Music] Only you only you Lord. Only you. Only you Lord. only you. You're the founder. [Music] Holy God, you Here's [Music] some words I want to leave you. Brother Brandham starts off listen. So I would like you to listen. You young people today. I don't know whether you come to this church or where you come. you young boys and girls and I gave things today that you might have said, "Well, that is so much history." No, you stood up. Remember, you were born in this time. [Music] Did you realize here's the messenger that received the letter? He's saying, and I'm just repeating, do you realize the things that you're doing, if there's another generation, or you might say, "Well, this is just so simple, you know, you just text something or send a picture or send something." And he says, "Your children will be judged for what you do. Haven't you know respect or decency? You girls out there wearing these little old shorts and things around. You might say we don't. Praise God. You can say we the people. There's another group of people. But he was speaking to some. And there may well be. I have it here. So it is for somebody that's reflecting on your daughter. Things that we do now, things that we live now is reflecting on our children, on our daughter, on our son. Did you know your grandmommy, your grandmommy was a flapper? That's back from the roaring 20s. That's when that word was invented. That was one kind of a person. Never throwing putting on dresses and just a new whole new way of life because this is this is standard for this generation. And I can tell you that uh things that I see, things that you see, things that you see in church, things you don't see in church, but maybe you see in the in in in the school. It's madness. &gt;&gt; Let the people say what they want to say. Is it true? &gt;&gt; Is it true? &gt;&gt; I'm not an old crank. [Music] I see people our age, this generation, where you go, you're going to go to work, you're going to go outside and rub shoulders with the world. You know, it's insanity. &gt;&gt; Let me hear it again. &gt;&gt; It's insanity, &gt;&gt; which is just a offbalance, off off the middle. You cannot associate with that. That's not your colleagues. That's not your friends. That is not your associates. You are to be a light in this world. There's a world of darkness, friends. Gross darkness. That's what this Bible says. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. And that doesn't need an upgrade. &gt;&gt; That's been the same for hundreds of years and is still the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; And your mommy a course girl from flapper to mommy and that's the reason you're a strip tease today. It's certainly what will your children be. See it's not something that is on a trend upward. It's on a trend down because the one who's inspiring it came and is destined for hell. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way he can think. And as I said, I said to my own girls going to a school of maybe a thousand people. Now there's 2,000 there. And one of their teachers listened to the prophets tapes till they wore them out. don't think ever darkened the door of the church even though he wanted to. His wife held him back. Dy friends, we've been through it. We've seen it. Seen every kind of situation you can imagine. Don't allow anyone to stand in your way. &gt;&gt; Stand with the few. Even when I I hear the messenger say, I can tell you one thing, there'll be very very few. That always strikes my heart. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let me be one of the few. [Music] Let me sing one of the few shall we please. [Music] one of the few and by faith in God's word I can claim it though the way makes and the opposition strong for the bride is away from my I just to hold my I must be firmly deciding to follow my oy and I will. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to ask the congregation about the service today and I've taken my liberty. Is there something inside that says I'm I'm resolved. &gt;&gt; Friends, there is no option. &gt;&gt; There actually is no option. It's God's word, God's way, God's promise. And I know for perhaps many of you, well, brother Biscll, my life and what's happened to me and the people who have affected me and everything else, you've got to separate yourself. Say, I walk with God. Even if I walk alone, I walk with God. I will not compromise on my commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ. You are my savior. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you as I close the service now. [Music] Stand up and be counted. I have I have so much. [Music] I especially if time should go on even a few more years, we're going to fall and depend so much upon you young ladies. Give me your attention. You young men, what kind of home, what kind of family are you going to have? It must be a solid uh true witness of the true vine an example congregation example family that's what you need to be say I'm dedicated to that comes little or come much whatever that means nothing it means nothing to Hey, [Music] I'm looking down your faces. I desire with all my heart, young men, young women, take your place. Take your position. Remain fervent with God. Don't be attract distracted one way or another. and let that be known as your commitment. [Music] We'll pray. Heavenly Father, I pray that we will see much fruit, your kind of fruit, that which you produce by your word, oh God, in the hearts of the people, in the souls. I pray that you will talk to them. I've talked to them now for the last hour and a half. Now you talk to them. You can speak to them in their when they're alone and no one is around. Bring back, oh God, these thoughts and these words and cause a commitment, oh God. Cause a cause them to be willing to be crucified with Christ. As the apostle has said, I'm crucified with Christ, dead to the world. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus, you said in your prayer and I identified with it said they are not of the world even as I am not of this world. Oh God, this world is not my home. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just pilgrims and strangers traveling through. I pray that you'll take, oh God, every person. [Music] Let them not, Father, be forgetful of these things. May they see that the message we have been called by, you'll be faithful to that call. It will continue to sound, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray your blessing upon the rest of this day and the service tonight and brother John in Victoria today. Oh God, let your word go out with a mighty voice in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. This world is not my home. Brother Nathan, would you help me sing that, please? This world is on my own. I'm just passing through my tri [Music] be. The angels make me open door. I am feeling in this world anymore. Oh glory. I have no friend like you. And if heavens are my home, Lord, what will I do? The angels beckoned me from angel and I be holy world. [Music] Amen. uh that course I um searched through heaven. Um &gt;&gt; yeah. Oh, not not not what a savior but u anyway. Yeah. Okay, we can sing a verse of that. Oh my savior.

[Music] He gave his life glory and redee in Port El Bernie. Brother Brandham just came to the pull pit after one of our native brothers sang that song and he just looked at me and he said, "Person wouldn't be much of a preacher if they couldn't preach after that." That's what he felt about that song. Maybe you could sing it again. The person wouldn't be much of a preacher. We couldn't preach after that. Well, we're not going to preach. We're going to just dismiss you now. The chorus. Oh hallelujah. [Music] His power was [Music] on Cal. His hands were his. [Music] He gave his life for me. &gt;&gt; And we love him, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. We love him, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Why don't you turn around, shake hands with somebody close by and wish them God's blessings today and we'll see you this evening. Amen. You're dismissed in Jesus name. [Music] Heat. Heat.
