Just a couple of prayer requests. We want to pray for brother Edwin Daws who's experiencing shortness of of breath along with severe coughing all week. So, we just want to lift our brother Edwin up in prayer. We also want to uh pray that the Lord will help brother Jeff Sachar find a good stable full-time job so he'll be able to support his family. And we also want to remember sister Christine, the wife of brother Gary Watson who's uh the manager of Mainland Broadcasting. She was uh diagnosed with having breast cancer and is scheduled to go to Christ Church for tests and and surgery should uh this be found necessary. So, we want to lift the sister up in prayer. If you have a need on your heart, if you're on the telephone hookup on the internet watching the service, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. Brother Jim, if you'd come. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray together. Father, it's a privilege to be here tonight, Lord. It just feels so wonderful, Lord, to come into the house of God, Lord, to especially if you've been away for a while. It's just a refreshing, Lord, a washing, Lord, and just sensing your presence, Father, and enjoying it. We're thankful for it, Father God, that you are pleased to inhabit the praise of your people, Lord. Father, we've come to hear your word, Lord, to come to a higher place than what we are even now. Lord, we see your promise, Lord Jesus, of a totally manifested and surrendered life, oh God. It's our heart's desire. And we know that the word continues to unfold in our hearts, Lord, and becoming a greater reality in each of us, Lord. And we come with expectation tonight, Father, asking that you would take your servant, Lord, whoever would speak here tonight, Lord, and enable him to yield himself to you, Lord, and come, Lord God. Let him be just a a a vessel for your spoken word tonight, Lord. Speak to our hearts, oh God. Father, we want to bring these requests before you. Our brother Edwin, our precious brother Edwin. Lord, he means so much to so many of us, Father God, by his life and his kindness, Lord. And Lord, I pray you'd go to where he's at right now, Lord, that you'd take away this cough and whatever ailment and this affliction, oh God. &gt;&gt; Father, we ask you in the name of Jesus Christ to go to our brother right now, Lord. Touch him, oh God, and raise him up, Lord. be glorified, oh God, as you have been in Sister Sally's life, a walking miracle, Lord. God, this man is life is totally surrendered to you and he's been a total blessing to us, oh God. I pray you go to him, Father, comfort him, Lord, and heal him even now, Lord Jesus, we ask. Father, for this uh brother Jeff looking for a job, oh Lord. God, it's a desire that's not always found in everyone today, Lord. But these godly men have the desire to go out and work on and provide for their families. I know if we just commit it to you, Lord, you'll make a way for them, Lord. Lord, help him tonight, Father. we pray just may you just enable him to commit it to you Lord and have peace about it oh God that you fulfill that need because you commanded it Lord that we do that and so you'll provide Lord thank you for that and the sister Lord that has been I believe it's sister Christine Lord that uh has been diagnosed with this form of cancer Lord and it's going to this place for test and surgery oh God we've seen your hand before Lord Lord, we Lord just ask that you would go and give her a peace, oh God. That you'd give her a revelation, Father, of her healing, Lord, that she could just have peace, Lord, and surrender it to you, oh God, knowing that you've provided for her, Lord. Oh, go with her, Lord. Give her that revelation, oh God, of faith, Lord, that she can just go and know and claim it in the name of Jesus Christ. Father, Lord, we commit the rest of this service to you, Lord. just help us to enter into a worship that's pleasing to you, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. I want to welcome everyone tonight. If you're visiting with us, we want to say God bless you. It's good to see Brother Mark, Sister Tina, Stanley with us. God bless you. Good to have you. We're going to turn directly to the word as brother Ed's going to come. Why don't we sing number 2057? Uh, have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. [Music] Have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. [Music] Thou art the potter. [Music] I am the clay. Hold me and make me after thy will. While I am waiting, yield it as still. Oh, how thine way, Lord. have thy own way. Search me and try me, master today. Oh, wider than snow. Wash me just now. And in thy presence humbly I bow. Oh have thy own way. Lord have thy own way. [Music] wounded and weery. Lord, help me I pray. Oh power, surely is thine. Oh, touch me and heal me. Savior divine. [Music] Oh, have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way over my [Music] absolute sway. Oh, filled with thy spirit till all shall see Christ all living. Let's sing the first verse again. Oh, have I lo I thou art the father I am the clay. Hold me and make me after I wait. While I am waiting, he stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Here we are able to gather today. I appreciated the prayer, brother Jim. You know, sometimes you have to be away a little while and then you appreciate coming just coming into the even into the sanctuary is a blessing, isn't it? There's just a a I don't know quietness. There's just a peace. There's a serenity. Like brother Brandham said, he liked to when he held a meeting, he far sooner preached in a church than be, you know, some auditorium or some place where they had wrestling the night before or who knows what they had the night before. Said it seemed to him that spirits kind of hung around. Well, I just believe the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; just stays around. God's people were there. They know that the next time they gather here, they're going to worship, going to praise him. Amen. We're here for one reason. &gt;&gt; That's to exalt his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Uh I'm going to make an announcement that I want to sing as the heart panth for the waterbrooks. The only reason I say that now is I might forget it by the time I get to the announcement. You you have to have stop gap measures, you know, as time goes on. uh for the school for the Bible way Christian Academy, they need and are looking for a volunteer uh driver from the US side because it's a US licensed bus. They would need a driver to transport the US children to and from the school on a regular basis from starting from September. And we already have the bus. We just need a driver. And please contact Brother Derek Paris if you are able to help. Amen. Uh the bus has been donated a 60 passenger bus and uh our brother Billy Joe Fer he may maybe wouldn't want me to say it but I'm saying it anyway then he can deal with me. But he donated the bus and uh he works for the school uh department or the school board. I don't know what they call it exactly, but he had uh had opportunity and we went down and I had looked over three buses with him and and he said, "I'm going to buy one for the school. I want to buy one for the church. It'll be also be a wonderful opportunity when perhaps some special meetings take place down in Seattle. We'll be can take more down than just in the van, you know." So, that's really nice and we're really thankful. The second announcement that the school needs to make is that there's going to be a short work be on Saturday. That's this Saturday the 10th. And could parents, brothers of the school children, and any other volunteers, so that opens up to everybody, please make themselves available for this short workbe on Saturday morning at 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. So, it's just 3 hours. And please contact Brother Leon Davea if you have any question. Shouldn't be much question. can just come with your sleeves rolled up, I guess, is the only thing. And also, uh, I want to make an announcement. I off often have you young people, young men, young ladies that don't have a whole lot of, uh, obligations perhaps. I know your schedule's busy, but maybe you can adjust it easier than others. We we need uh the the house that's immediately next where the minister suite is downstairs. Brother uh brother Paul and sister Lena live downstairs that used to be the old minister suite and brother Alex has moved to the next house next door. And we've had the upstairs completely renovated. And we need we need some young people. There can be some sisters. And we'd like uh we'd like to have a sister and a brother. Uh maybe one brother can take charge of the outside and he could just do it as a you know be a nice outing. Thank you. That was very delayed. But it did come through. Be very nice outing. Fresh air and all the rest. Sisters can be inside and that won't take long either. It's it's essentially it's essentially there. just a few things that need to be done and and made ready for we uh want to make it available and it will be rented to believers, believers only. And if you know someone that will be needing, it would be ideal for, you know, maybe not over a family of not over four, it would be ideal for a couple of sisters actually. And it's two bedrooms and and so on. So, uh, it it is available and, uh, it'll be available probably about the 15th of this month. So, if you knew that someone was in need, we don't want it to be on a short-term thing because as soon as someone is out, then of course you have to fix it up again. And so, this is in the uh this is under the trustees and and so if you have someone, you could perhaps contact brother DJ and let him know or brother Tom. Uh, but I wonder if we have a a a sister who could just take charge of the inside and get a few other sisters with her. Uh, so we know we have somebody or and brother for the outside. All right, Sister Margaret, you're going to take charge and you'll take charge. Okay, get, you know, get a half a dozen or three or four with you. And uh, I would say if you have three, four sisters, Sister Margaret. So any other sister, you can see Sister Margaret or say our brother here, brother Right. When he stands up, you can't miss him. That's great. So, that's all looked after. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glad to be in the house of God tonight, &gt;&gt; Brother Mark. Nice to see you and your family. My goodness. Back home again for a little while. All right. Why don't we stand and sing? What was it? As the heart pan. That's right. [Music] As the mark guide the water from my soul is after thee. You alone are my heart. Desire and I long to worship thee. You alone are my strength and shield. You alone does my spirit heal. [Music] You alone are my heart desire and my long toship. &gt;&gt; I want to sing that first verse in that chorus again. And I'd like everyone just to set your mind on the Lord. And I wonder while you're singing if you might ask yourself, how much do I love him? How much do I desire him? And that'll help you think about what it is you're saying and you're singing. You know, sometimes it's hard. you know, you've come from a day's work and it's not it's not just uh that simple just to give yourself over. But when you don't have to ask yourself very many questions, how much do I love him? How much does he love you? What does he really desire? I believe he desires our full attention tonight. Our all of our love and all that we can be. I heard of one man one day he was in prayer and the Lord spoke to him and said he was in his morning prayer and the Lord spoke to him and said I want you to go and meet everyone you can today and tell them that I love them. And that man had an incredible day. He said people just broke down in weeping and tears when he told him because the presence of God was with him. But you know that holds true for every one of us. Holds true. And we can't we can't even begin to determine the depth of that. And the reason I'm trying to bring this to you is I want to set I want to set the service in a direction for the word. And sometimes you come to a subject that's just not that easy to deliver to the people. And we have one of those tonight. You need to be spiritual. You need to have the mind of God and say, "God, whatever it is you have laid on my brother's heart tonight, deliver it to my soul." And I want to tell you that I desire you with everything that's in me. All right? As the deer pandeth for the water so my soul long after thee. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee. You alone are my strength, my shield. &gt;&gt; You alone are my spirit. You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship. [Music] with our heads bowed. Father, we're coming reverently. You made yourself known through Jesus Christ. And what we saw in him was grace, mercy, and love. And Lord, tonight we are recipients of these graces. Lord, had you not loved us, you would never have searched us out, but you found us and you came by in such a way and just appealed to us. You brooded over us. You wooed us &gt;&gt; and brought us and caused us. Oh God, some of us had very hard hearts. Some of us were so steeped in darkness. We were so bound it looked like it was impossible. Many of us, and sure, I'm sure all of us tried to make amends. We tried to turn over new leaves. We tried to make resolutions, but they didn't work. We failed. And oh God, one day we came helpless. And we said, "Oh Lord, have mercy upon me. And you came to our aid. You came to us. And oh Lord, tonight we're so thankful." And we want to say, "Blessed be your name. You're so you've been so gracious to us. And I pray that you'll grip every heart, Lord. And may we be overflowing with thanksgiving and worship to you in adoration. Pray, oh God, you'll bless now your word. You know the things you've laid on my heart. May they be delivered to your people as you delivered it to me. I pray you'll anoint me, oh God, and anoint the people and anoint all who are streaming tonight. Lord, we we say God blessings upon them. The name of Jesus Christ, we commit all things to you now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing, I'm going to read just a couple of verses which we have for text on Sunday. John the 14th chapter verses 2 and three. And then if you'll keep your Bibles open because I have quite a number of scriptures and it it will be in the book of Deuteronomy. uh when you are seated we will be going through quite a number of those scriptures in John's gospel in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also. Amen. God bless this word and God bless you as you have your seats. In this scripture Jesus has said I will come again and receive you to myself. This receiving of you is to not just to accept you. That's not it. To receive you is to take you to himself, to join you to himself as a companion and to take you by the hand. In fact, the Greek says to take you in order to carry you away. That's the intent. in order to snatch you and take you away. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; To take what is one's own by it taking you by receiving you. He is saying you belong to me. You don't belong to anything else. You don't belong to this environment or this society or this civilization or this nation or this city or this church. You belong to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, you're mine and I'm taking you and to take what belongs to one and to make it his own. To lay claim to it, to literally seize it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love that. To to be an associate, as one, as a companion. He's receiving us as a companion and of that which is taken with the intent to never let it go. Hallelujah. Isn't that marvelous? You know, I could preach on that. I I could just preach on that to receive you unto myself, to seize you, to take a hold with the intent of of letting you know you're mine. You're not your own &gt;&gt; and I'm not going to let you go. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to take you away &gt;&gt; to my place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. as my associate, as my companion, &gt;&gt; and to lay hold to let you know that you've been selected &gt;&gt; and chosen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a great relationship. We've been speaking on the rapture and how that the rapture is not so much uh a location as it is a change of status, &gt;&gt; a change of position. Brother Jim may not remember, but he he said so much in his prayer the position that God has brought us into. And uh we took from the prophet's message on rapture. I'm just rehearsing this to you. I'm not going to spend any time on it. Where Psalms 27 where he's talking about the rapture and the order of this great rapture. In Psalms 27 speaks of I will dwell in the house of the Lord. Speaks of inquire in his temple. These are all aspects of this rapture that that is taking place. And in his pavilion, he'll hide me in the secret of his tabernacle. Now, I want to take a scripture. It's a strange scripture, but I will be reading in Deuteronomy, if you will turn with me to the 12th chapter. Brother Brandham preaches a message and God's only place of worship. God's only place of worship. And in preaching that I like you to recall that uh the children of Israel were constantly moving. So the place was not so much a geographical location. But it was a condition. &gt;&gt; It was a it was a position. It was something that people entered into. &gt;&gt; And it is exactly the same today. We say you know that these places are house this is a house of worship which is true only in part. But I mean this structure means absolutely nothing to God. But it is who comes in and the attitude they come in with and what they receive while they're here and with the response of what the response uh that they have as a result of what they hear. That means everything to God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That means everything to him. That's what the house of worship is all about. And so as it is with the place of worship, the place you'll hold that in your mind. This is the place. The place is not so much a geographical location as the rapture is a place, not a geographical location, but it's a condition that one comes into. It's a position that one receives. It's a status. It's a it it's a it's a level of and I want to take today. It's a level of a relationship &gt;&gt; that we didn't have before, &gt;&gt; an intimacy. &gt;&gt; And I the what makes it a little bit difficult and uh you know occasionally brother Brandham said, "Well, I he approach the subject and say, I trust that we're you know, mostly adults here. I trust that we're all adults and I trust that you will be mature and those that are streaming will also be. they wouldn't be streaming if they if they weren't really uh deeply interested and committed. But let me say this. Satan has perpetrated upon this generation especially and upon society as we know it. I would say a massive fraud in taking the most precious and the most intimate things and degrading them down until they can scarcely be talked about. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is a fraud upon our upon the believer especially. And it's a triple fraud when he dragged the precious things down. That's fraud number one. And makes it so that the people in the world can't even see it straight. What's love? You think the world knows what love is? has no concept of what love is &gt;&gt; about the marriage, about the family, about the union that God has ordained. These things are so intimate. They are so precious. In fact, is Satan has perpetrated such a fraud even upon believers. I said to brother Tom just before I came out, there are scriptures in this word of God that I refrain from reading because people our minds are actually tainted &gt;&gt; if not contaminated by the world. And what is what the messages that are sent to you through the books and the magazines and the advertisements and and the billboards along the side of the road and everything that you grew up with and everything that you hear and everything that you've heard in school and all the rest of it and the things that that the that Satan wants to make you think that now you know something about it. And quite frankly, we don't know very much about it. And that's why so often we find ourselves into a pit. So from having said that we will read a scripture in uh Deuteronomy 12. These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it. all the days that you live upon the earth. And you shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which you shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree. I'll just stop there for a moment. Do you know, and I'm sure that you do, that God regarded when the people worshiped false gods, he regarded that as an adulterous act &gt;&gt; because they were entering into something so sacred, something so holy, and something so intimate that God considered when a man or a woman gives of their very being and their soul to a false god. And God spoke through the prophets and said that they committed whoredoms uh upon every high hill and under every green tree. And and he he told Israel, "Cut your hair off. I'm going to I'm I'm going to divorce you. I'm going to put you away for that." And then he on in the chapter, I believe in Jeremiah 16 said, you know, can a man forget his wife? What was it? And the prophet said, "As Eve as Eve was polluted and uh and then uh so was Israel, Adam had a had a bride and God had a bride. Jehovah had a bride in in Israel and Jesus had a bride all the way through. &gt;&gt; And the same thing happened in each case." And so God is telling them here, "And you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire, and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place." I can assure you that when a person comes into a real birth, into a real relationship with the word of this hour, that the gods of the past and the gods of my ideas and the gods of denominationalism are destroyed. &gt;&gt; That is why the rock that was cut out of the mountain without hands, it it struck that image at the feet and ground the thing to powder. There was nothing left. The wind just blew it away. I say God, even in this message, people hang on to old ideas and old theories and old denominational uh uh concepts. I say they need to be destroyed. They just need to pass away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They need to come under subjection to the word of God which is Jesus Christ revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, "You shall not uh and you shall overthrow," verse three, "you shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire, and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place. You shall not do so unto the Lord your God, but unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name, there even unto his habitation shall you seek, and thither shalt thou come. I was I was really struck with this phrase, and I would like you to remember it and keep it in your heart. unto his habitation shall you seek, and thither shalt thou come. There's a number of places, in fact about seven, and they're all found in Deuteronomy, and they're found between chapters 12, which we're reading, and I think chapter 18, and it's all has reference, and it says the same words, unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose. In in the fifth verse here which we just read, the 14th verse says, "But in the place which the Lord your God shall choose in one of thy tribes, there shalt thou offer thy burnt offerings, and thou shalt do all that I command thee." In the I won't read all the verses, but in 12 and 18, but thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose. in Deuteronomy 12 and 26. Only thy only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou hast uh thou shalt take and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose in chapter 15 and 20. Thou shalt eat it before the Lord. These are the these are the feasts. And the and the Lord thy God year by year in the place which the Lord shall choose. and and thy household. And 16 and two, thou shalt therefore sacrifice the Passover unto the Lord thy God of the flock and the herd in the place which the Lord shall choose to place his name there. In 16 and 15, 7 days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord the the Lord shall choose. in 17 and 10. And thou shalt do according to the sentence which they of that place which the Lord shall choose shall show thee in 18 and6. And if a Levite come uh from from any of thy gates out of all Israel where he sojourned and come with all desire of his mind unto the place which the Lord shall choose. So the place now the children of Israel are moving. These people are moving. They're transient. The place is not so much a hill or a mountain or a valley or a or a geographical location, but the place and you can see each of these references. I believe every one of them have reference to the people entering into worship and their sacrifices and their vows and their offerings. They are, shall I say, in communion with God. They're entering into not a not say this is a nice place under this tree or under this rock or whatever more had nothing to do with that but the thing that God was saying that this place it is a it is a certain realm that you will enter into this place that I choose and it was connected to keeping every word of God because it was impossible to enter into that place and disregard God's heard &gt;&gt; and the same holds true today. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about the rapture. The rapture say, well, we have it in our mind. I know that we do because we've been taught that. And and and it is a place. Heaven is a heaven is a place, but there's a lot more to it than that. And if we're just simply waiting to go from this place to that place, I think that we're missing something. And I think that God wants us to know that it's not just from this place which we will say in a in a a time locked limit limited uh physical life which we have here to to an eternal realm. It's it's not just that but it is even more so a place that a person rises into &gt;&gt; in a relationship with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; A relationship with Jesus Christ, an intimacy that is unknown to the world. &gt;&gt; It is a spiritual bedroom chamber. &gt;&gt; We enter into &gt;&gt; We are going to a marriage supper. &gt;&gt; Not just a supper. It's a marriage supper. The people who go there have entered into a special relationship with that one. And we go there as the lamb's wife. I tell you, we have a relationship with that Christ. Now, &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's not just from this place to another place or from this dwelling place or this mortal to an immortal or from an earthly place that is so dictated to by time not not merely to an eternal timeless existence but this place the place is uh a position a status a class &gt;&gt; or a rank It's a place of eminence. &gt;&gt; It's a place of recognition &gt;&gt; that a people must enter into. And I believe our our call of God to come into this place. Now, uh, just to save some time, there are times in the scripture, I'll just go over it quickly, where God, for example, when he called Abram, who later became Abraham, get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, a geographical place. I'm going to show you a place. I'm going to show you a physical land, and I'm going to give you that land. There were times when that when that took place in Exodus, uh God speaking, he said, "Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb." He's telling Moses, "I'll stand before you in the rock in Horeb." That wasn't on uh Hermon or or or Nebo or or Mount Carmel. It was on Horeb. God identified a certain uh geographical location. But when he said to Moses over and over again, "In the place that I will choose, in the place that I will choose, in the place that I will choose," it wasn't a geographical place where they stopped. &gt;&gt; It wasn't an oasis or a certain place. It was a It was a a a realm that they entered into. It was a spiritual realm. It was a relationship with their God that they entered into. Even as marvelous as it was when Moses stood before a burning bush and uh and it burned and and was not consumed and God Almighty spoke and it was a pillar of fire burning there. There's no record that Moses ever went back to it. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Take off your shoes. The ground you're standing on is holy." It was holy because Moses was standing there being met by God himself. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't holy after God and Moses left. It wasn't a geographical location. It was something he entered into. He entered into a realm where God talked to him and he could speak back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what God's talking about. And that is more what I want to come to in rapture. That's what rapture is all about. We can't sit here, you know, kind of numb and dull and and uh and uh uh kind of insulated sort of thing. We have to come into this house realizing we're the bride of Jesus Christ. We have a relationship with him. We have an intimacy that the world knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; And if you miss that, you're missing the whole thing. &gt;&gt; If you that are married, if you only have a roof over your head and and the and the woman does the cooking and the man does the working and brings in brings in the bacon, you're missing it. &gt;&gt; You're missing it. &gt;&gt; You can say amen or stay silent if you want. A home is something where where love is is exchanged from man to wife and that's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; And someone might say, "Well, that's all right, Brother Ed, but I'm not married and I'm not I'm I'm this that we're not judging everything by your your particular unique position. I'm talking what the scripture says." And when the scripture says it starts out right away in Genesis, let me just see. I want to just go along here in Genesis when God began to speak to Adam and he says to multiply. He says to the animals, even to the fishes, multiply, bring forth, fill the seas. &gt;&gt; That's God's very nature. Multiply and bring forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he made it one of the most sacred of things. And so what now when we're talking about a place, I want you to be mature now. Going to talk about a place. Uh, I'm not going to preach on this, but the place, a husband's responsibility, but not his responsibility, but his position, a husband's position is a place. &gt;&gt; Because he's elevated to a place in marriage. And a woman that gets married, she's elevated to a place. See, she's not just a girl. She's not just a someone that's in school. She's not going to college. She's not learning a career now. She's entering into what God has chosen and made her for. And it's a place of fulfillment. It's a place where the husband and the wife, the man and his wife, it's such a sacred thing. And Satan has so he's deployed all of his uh all of his armorament at this very sacred thing. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, he's he's he's wre havoc &gt;&gt; upon the family and upon the home. And I'm not talking a social. I'm talking about Christ and his bride. And and and that the only reason we have what we have which is sacred and uh we have you know uh young men, young ladies or just men and and ladies come to the altar to receive one another. And it always it's a great celebration. It's a great happy time. And the families are oh all excited and enthused about it. and and uh young ladies, you know, have stars in their eyes and they're just uh looking with anticipation of the future and all the rest of it. And young couple just in in expectation of what lays before them and all the rest of it. You only have that because God has already instituted it. &gt;&gt; God already ordained it. And I can tell you what, friends, the Bible, not that I I don't mean to say it that way, but the Bible begins with a love story between Adam and and Adam and Eve in Eden. And it ends with the lamb and his wife in Revelation. This Bible right here is not a book of ethics. This Bible is not how to run a church. This Bible is a love story from Genesis to Revelation. And it's the most intimate of love stories. And I tell you what, friends, regardless of how how much revelation you get, I do not believe we will plum the depth of this intimacy that Jesus Christ wants to have with his church, with his people. In fact, is the rapture to me is that &gt;&gt; and it's that we enter into. &gt;&gt; We talk about crossing over. I tell you what, we got to know and God intends for us to know this kind of a relationship untainted by the world, unaffected by the world. And I want to caution you and I want to warn you, do not allow the world, do not allow Satan to interpret to you what a man and a woman, what a young man, what a young woman. Don't let Satan interpret to you what purity is. &gt;&gt; He knows nothing about purity. He's an impure creature and don't let him make wreak havoc and make a make mockery of virginity. It is it is a blessed thing in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; Whether you have it or you don't have it, that's irrelevant to me. But tonight for this message, I say that's something that God has given. &gt;&gt; It's something to be protected. It's something to be revered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll not allow him. I deny and defy the enemy that tries to come in and make purity and make it uh oh, you're pure. I tell you what, you want to throw your shoulders back and say, "Thank God I am." &gt;&gt; I could never protect myself, but God has done it. &gt;&gt; And you want to thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're entering into a realm of relationship &gt;&gt; that the world can never give you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's something to be treasured. &gt;&gt; And when we come to the house of God, we're not in this place. When we come into this place, it has nothing to do with the geographical location. 18306 on 60th Avenue. Has nothing to do with that. Has nothing to do with the name of Cloverdale Bible Way. But it is that God in his great wisdom in his mind came across your pathway and led you to a place in Christ. &gt;&gt; And so we have a certain respect for brothers and sisters in the family of God in the house of God that God uh perhaps met and did special things for us. It's a but it doesn't make it a a sacred shrine. It just makes it a place that God has ordained that we should come and be together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so this place that God speaks about, as I said earlier, it's a standing. There's different words in the Hebrew for the place that God has ordained. But it's a place where you can stand. It's a region. It's a place where you can rise up and be established. And there's a specific emphasis now that God has made a specific emphasis even unto his habitation. This is not a request. I want you to I want you to listen close now. God is saying to you tonight, I would never be on this subject. I didn't dream this up. In fact, as I wouldn't have normally been preaching tonight, but I felt very pressed. Even unto his habitation shall you seek. &gt;&gt; Amen. And thither shalt thou come. You will come to it. &gt;&gt; If you're one of his, you're going to come to it. &gt;&gt; But first, before you get there, you shall seek it. &gt;&gt; You shall desire it. As the deer, as a heart panth after the waterbrooks, so pantth my soul after thee, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His habitation that you shall seek is not merely a dwelling, but it's a place where you settle down. a place that you will abide. You're not going to be leaving there. It's a place that you will rest. You'll come to a rest. You'll come to a relaxation. So much so that the word of habitation, you'll come to my habitation. And you know in the world we have the word word cohabit cohabitation which has a direct inference to marriage and that union. And that's exactly what this word means. It is that you will rest, you'll relax, you will lie down. And it has a direct reference to the married sexual relationship. And if you take that word through the through the Hebrew, it runs all the way through the entire Old Testament where a woman came to her husband or came to another man, whatever the case might be. And that's where that word comes from. But God says, "You shall seek &gt;&gt; this place. &gt;&gt; You shall seek this relationship." God does not want to be just a provider for us. &gt;&gt; Oh, give me this, give me that, give me something else. God wants to enter into a relationship with his people. And Satan is trying to perpetrate a fraud upon the people that they can't scarcely grasp this in a proper balance. Oh God, how how how do I have this where I have this kind of a relationship because the world has made it such a filthy thing. But I want to deny that and purge your minds of that tonight by the washing of the water, by the word, and let you know that God intends a sacred intimate relationship &gt;&gt; with his people. &gt;&gt; The people opens, as I said, the scripture opens with the scene of Adam and his wife in Eden. And the first words that God utters be fruitful and multiply &gt;&gt; right. They cannot do thus without having that intimacy &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that God prepared for them. Jesus when he was here in his first coming he said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a king which made a marriage for his son. Who's he talking about? I'm talking about himself. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of heaven &gt;&gt; is like unto a king that made a great marriage for his son. He's the son &gt;&gt; and that's what he's talking about. And he invited and he sent forth his servants to call him that were bidden to the wedding. He thought they would be excited. They would come to this wedding. They would come to this glorious event. And they would not come. And while they went, and the Bible speaks of those in Matthew 25 that the voice came, "Oh, arise, uh, behold, the bridegroom cometh." And they that were ready went in with him into the marriage. They didn't just go with him into the supper. They went with him into the marriage. &gt;&gt; They came into a union. &gt;&gt; We have continual, we're continually bombarded with a gay parade, pride celebration. You know what it is? It's a celebration. It's a celebration that the seed that God gave to man is refused by woman. That's what they're celebrating. And celebrating that man has been done such dastardly things &gt;&gt; as to live in such a way that the scripture commanded death for it. &gt;&gt; And I could get into a lot of trouble for saying this, but I deny Satan to perpetrate upon my mind any fraud. That's what God's holy word has said. &gt;&gt; This scripture is speaking about a relationship. And they talk about these celebrations. Look how they've turned the whole the whole society around. &gt;&gt; It's time that we stand up and declare &gt;&gt; what the truth of God's word is all about. God desires. I'm not going to fear for a job. I'm not going to fear that the doors of this church are closed. If they're closed, we'll preach on the streets. We'll preach in the garage. We'll preach wherever we can preach. But we'll not deny the truth of God's word. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're not going to cower to it. &gt;&gt; We're not going to bow down to it. &gt;&gt; We don't bow down to that deadly thing, godless society, &gt;&gt; and the leaders go right with it. And they'll be destroyed with them if they don't repent themselves. From the highest of the politicians to the civic politicians to whoever they are to go out this way merely for votes, they'll die with this. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says God's going to burn it up. &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, it can't happen too soon. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; And the whole purpose behind it is to try and contaminate the minds of the people who would try to seek out and understand the scriptures. &gt;&gt; And that's what rapture actually is. We have to enter into a marriage with him first before we go to the supper. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say we went to church first or we sang in the choir first or we played an instrument first. We had a marriage first. That's rapture. &gt;&gt; And do not let the world try to taint your minds or tell you what this means or that means. The devil and all of his hordes and all of the people that follow him know nothing about the intimacy that the scripture talks about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's for you. &gt;&gt; And don't let the devil cheat you out of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The sum total and substance of the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation is on this subject. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have enough time in a week of preaching to cover this subject. And here I am on a Wednesday night trying to approach it. And God blessed them &gt;&gt; and said unto them, "Be fruitful." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And multiply. &gt;&gt; Be fruitful. And God bless them. God, Jehovah, almighty God, the first act he does upon his son. And God blessed them right after he made them. God blessed them. And said his first words, "Be fruitful &gt;&gt; and multiply." &gt;&gt; He could have said a lot of other things. Could have said, "I'll be with you always. I'll never let I'll never let one of these animals get at you. I'll protect you. You're going to have things easy. All these things." He could have said, "All that." That is what he said. He had his mind on one thing. You're going to be fruitful, and you're going to multiply, and you're going to bring a continual expression of myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in spoken words, the original seed, Jehovah had a bride &gt;&gt; that he loved. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Jehovah had a bride that he loved. &gt;&gt; I got a wife here and I'm thankful that she loves me. Have children and have a congregation and I feel loved. But oh, it has nothing. It can't compare with thinking that Almighty God would love me &gt;&gt; and love you. And Jehovah had a bride and he loved her. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He loved Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And Israel went to whoring after strange gods and played the part of the harlot. Right. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "And God spoke through the prophet and said, "You've laid on every green tree and you've allowed your breasts to be pressed down." And what's he talking about? He's talking about this terrible relationship. But what what were they doing? They were worshiping other gods. And he says they've even gone as far as to offer their sons and their daughters, which was the fruit of their bodies to these gods. &gt;&gt; What have you done? Think of this generation. The abortions that they committed every single day and children murdered, which it actually is. &gt;&gt; And all of this filth, I can tell you, it's only filth in their minds. It's only filth where they've dragged it. But let me announce to you that everything that God has instituted is absolutely holy. I'm going to say things. You young men that are growing up here and becoming into maturity and young women and all the rest said, "I have certain desires. I feel so terrible. I I have such guilt. I have such lust. I have such desires." You know what I'm going to say is, "Pastor, nonsense. &gt;&gt; It's the devil that told you it's unclean. &gt;&gt; God put it in your system. God made you that way and he gave it to you so you could control it under the word of God and remain pure and holy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But God gave it to you. And I've counseledled with a lot of people that I don't ever remember preaching it as plain as I am tonight. But I've counseledled with a lot of young people and they come under that under that cloud. You know why? Cuz the world, the devil interpreted that desire to you. This is low. This is filthy. This is dirty. This is nasty. It's something that God gave you &gt;&gt; and it's only dirty if you allow him to control it. But if you allow God to control it, it's pure. It's holy. It's something that God has given. &gt;&gt; And this kind of preaching will set you free. &gt;&gt; You don't let the devil interpret it for you. &gt;&gt; You don't let the world interpret it for you. You let the word interpret it for you. Hallelujah. This will take the wind out of his sails and this will set you free. &gt;&gt; You want to go out of this place tonight liberated. Say, I accept what you've said about this God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll be able to come to your husbands and your wives pure &gt;&gt; and enter into a relationship. Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of other areas I'm not even going to try to touch on and deal, but this is this is the this is a focus point of the scripture. In the spoken word, brother Brandham said, "Adam's wife rejected rejected to bring life. She brought forth death. We're her product." Hello. &gt;&gt; We're all her product. By the woman, he said we die. &gt;&gt; But by the man, we live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you follow that? By the woman, you've been born of a woman. And because you've been born of a woman, you die. Has nothing to do, it's nothing against a woman. That's the way it the world happened. We all have a natural birth, sexual birth. And by that, we die. &gt;&gt; But by a birth, by our heavenly parent, we live &gt;&gt; and we live forever. He says we're her product, our bodies. I'm glad he said our bodies. Our soul didn't come from our mama. &gt;&gt; Our soul didn't come from our daddy. Our soul came from God. &gt;&gt; And God looked upon that and said, "That's mine." Hallelujah. Satan, you can't have it. You can't even contaminate it. I'm going to hold it and protect it and I'm going to bring it to myself. But you shall seek after me. You shall seek this kind of a relationship. You shall seek this kind of cohabitation. &gt;&gt; You shall seek this kind of relationship &gt;&gt; where you relax, where you trust, where you give yourself over completely. And the way God described it was the marriage relationship &gt;&gt; so completely surrendered to one another. Tell you what folks wouldn't be a bit surprised that all of us here tonight. We'll learn something from this Wednesday night service. Say, "Oh God, take me take me out of the kitchen where you just provide for me. Take me out of the living room where we just have fellowship, fellowship, fellowship. Take me to that bedroom chamber where the prophet says it's a three-bedroom. It's a three- room house. Hallelujah. It's a three room house. And uh as far as the church world is concerned, they know nothing about the bedroom chamber. &gt;&gt; And soon as you say all kinds of all kinds of wicked things and evil things, I say shut them out. &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't let him even crowd in. He has no right. And even preachers of the gospel think, "Oh, that is that's too intimate. That's too close. We can't dare say that." I say, "We better say it or there won't be a rapture." &gt;&gt; A rapture is a relationship. &gt;&gt; A rapture is a marriage before the supper. &gt;&gt; And we're to preach until you have that relationship. &gt;&gt; Till you're unashamed to enter into that kind of intimacy. Oh God, it'll mean more to you after the service when you say, "As the deer panth after the water brooks, then you'll be able to go into the Song of Solomon and read several chapters as I did before service tonight." Oh, says, "I'm sick of love. I'm sick of love." Tell me, have you seen him? &gt;&gt; I'm looking for him. I'm searching for him. Others have wounded me. Mother's told me, "You're crazy, but I can't be as satisfied. My thirst can't be quenched till I have found him." &gt;&gt; Ah, she said, "When I found him, he took a hold of me. He embraced me. He held me with his hand." &gt;&gt; His right hand was under my head. &gt;&gt; You think that's some loosey goosey nonsense? The world knows nothing about this. And incidentally, heaven preached on it for many, many years. But she said, his right hand, she was aware, his right hand, and his right hand is what held the message. His right hand held all the seven messengers. His right hand was under her head. &gt;&gt; She was supported. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By what he held in his right hand. &gt;&gt; She was embraced. by the word. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; Adam's bride, he said, was found of the false seed. That's exactly right. And Jehovah's bride was found the same way. Right. And he divorced her and put her away. Is that right? That was God. And Christ's bride is the same thing. She's found with worldly organization seed in her and not the gospel having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof uh from the Holy Spirit and from the word. &gt;&gt; Five women, you've heard me speak on them before. Five women are listed in the chapter that starts out the book of the generation of Jesus Christ. The book of the generation singular of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Five women, Tamar, Rahab the harlot, and Tamar received seed from her father-in-law, which was totally against this word, Rahab the harlot, and Ruth the Moabitete who came through a genealogy that actually had a commencement from incest and Bath Sheeba who was Uriah's wife who David had murdered so he had Bath Sheba these are called the generation of Jesus Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. &gt;&gt; All of these women have one thing in common and that is all of them received seed and by receiving seed their status and position in life changed dramatically. Four of them received seed by man and one received seed by God. This is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ. And Sarah received seed when she was past the age and her womb was dead and milk veins dried up and her husband was his body was dead. But God by his promise gave life. All of these five women, what the scripture is saying is that these women, not only was their status changed, but each one of them, if you were to read their account, listen closely, their entire state of affairs, their entire position, their entire realm was transformed. formed &gt;&gt; completely &gt;&gt; completely and instantly &gt;&gt; when they received when Kamar receive seed of Judah you may not understand it but you take what you're hearing and hang on to it because this is the scripture &gt;&gt; and this is where it goes way beyond anything you could understand from the marriage relationship ship. The thirst and the the pangs of desire were so great within the hearts and beings of these women that they desired after God. They didn't desire. It was no fleshly relationship that they were desiring. Their soul cried out &gt;&gt; for something they didn't understand. And I'm telling you tonight with all the ferveny of my soul, God's trying to get something across to you people sitting there. He's trying to get something across to you that there's a relationship that we must enter into with Jesus Christ that even you don't understand. &gt;&gt; And perhaps you'll never understand it. &gt;&gt; You thirst after God. You say, "Why is it I crave after him with such a desire and it doesn't seem to be satisfied? I have such a craving. I come in the house of God. God meets me in a special way. I I had a certain experience with him and oh, it was so glorious. It was so marvelous." Let me tell you something. We haven't touched We haven't touched the surface of it yet, but what God is trying to do is pull you through to the other side because it's this kind of a thirst. It's this kind of a craving that's going to pull you into the rapture. &gt;&gt; You won't get it any other way. &gt;&gt; You say, "I hunger after God." You want to thank God that you do tonight. I'd like to say so much more about these about these women. Every time I read it, it's just so incomprehensible. How are you going to answer that one? How you people going to figure that one out? You'll never figure that one out. You've heard me speak about Tamar, but I It's not enough to hear me speak about it. It it's it's more that you contemplate and that you meditate and say, "God, what is it you're saying? This is the very book of the generation of Jesus Christ." They're telling us how Jesus Christ came. This is the record. &gt;&gt; I tell you that God transformed in a moment of time the realm of of Rahab the harlot. Oh, her life changed dramatically. Dramatically. You'll never be able to describe it &gt;&gt; here. She has a house. She's a harlot. And God, what is the distance? &gt;&gt; What is the distance from being a roadside harlot &gt;&gt; to being written in Genesis 1? &gt;&gt; What is that span? &gt;&gt; It's like an eternity. &gt;&gt; Who can comprehend that span? Who can comprehend the span of taking that poor soul and then uniting her and bringing her in? And the prophet telling us that uh an officer of the Israel Israel army, the Hebrews took her to wife &gt;&gt; and she became a mother into the kingly lineage of Jesus Christ. and Ruth and Ba Sheba. We say so much about Rebecca and Isaac and Eleazar and we sing we sing songs and the specials about Isaac and the camel train is coming. has very little to do about the camel train, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it has a lot to do with Rebecca saying, "Who is that man &gt;&gt; standing out in the field? This world is a field. Who is this man?" She finds a she finds somebody. &gt;&gt; Who is he? &gt;&gt; Says, "That's my master's son." And the scripture says, "And Isaac brought her &gt;&gt; into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death." Is this a love story? Far be it from so this is Isaac, the promised son. Yes, &gt;&gt; he's a type of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I can assure you that when this bride of Jesus Christ in this generation seeks after him, &gt;&gt; seeks after his habitation, &gt;&gt; habitation, it's not just temple, pavilion, tabernacle, house dwelling. Now it's tabernacle. I'm bringing another side to you. It's tabernac. It is is habitation. And you shall seek after this habitation. You shall seek after this relationship and anything less than that is not good enough. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And thou shalt you shall come in." and our Isaac. Our Isaac, I tell you what, friends, I care nothing for what the world has to say. And if you can possibly decontaminate your mind, but Christ has one thing on his mind, and that is a love relationship. as Isaac saw her and took her into his mother's tempt and became husband to her. When Christ people say, "Oh, oh, I repented and I I I I wept at the altar and all the rest of it." That's all wonderful. I'm glad you repented. But I want to announce to you tonight, there's one thing on his mind, and that is that he he can come to you in such an intimacy and gives you seed as Mary receives seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These other women, the four in in Matthew 1, before they were taken to be wife and receive seed. Mary. She was pregnant, still a virgin, and had not known a man. And that is a that is not exactly our type because she was still a carrier. We enter into such a relationship. It goes beyond my description. But the bride of Jesus Christ is not merely a carrier. &gt;&gt; Right? This prophet said in such astounding words, she becomes him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was word, she's word. &gt;&gt; It's not that he was word and she's a carrier of the word. Mary was a carrier, but she issued out, but she was pregnantated and still virgin. In that sense, that is also the bride of Jesus Christ. Pregnated with the word of God. So, let it be unto me according to your word. and the and the very life of Christ uh comes into us as a as believers and we become we express Christ. But it goes deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you want to really be spiritual. You want to really pray because I'll tell you what, I'll be honest before God. I'm as sensitive to the Holy Spirit right now that I'm just listening to him how far I shall go. And if you can take it, I may go a little further. &gt;&gt; But if God sees that you can't, then I will stop. These things go much deeper &gt;&gt; and richer. Last Sunday morning as I start speaking on the rapture, you think maybe I spent 10 or 20 hours, which I do most every week on on on a message. That message has been in my heart and in my bosom for at least six years and I think more like 8 to 10 years. And I've held that before God and without approaching it. I would approach it just come to this to come to the edge of it and then back away. And a couple conventions I was telling the people the prophet of God actually walked through. He walked through the whole order of the rapture in the last days of his life. And then I would just drop it and see how the Holy Spirit would make it known to the people. But I felt that I this was the season to bring it down to your friends. &gt;&gt; And all of these everything that here the prophet is speaking about, I will dwell in the house of God. I will inquire in his temple. All his realms, it's all descriptive of of of the rapture experience. But the real the real heart of it is you shall seek unto this habitation. And I will say to you tonight as a congregation, there isn't a man or a woman sitting here and myself included. But what needs to seek under that kind of relationship? &gt;&gt; You see, you can say, "Well, brother Biscll, I uh I have heard and I believed already that we have entered into that relationship with him and we are already married to him and I've already received his seed." That is true. But you can ask other married couples around here. Lots of people have experienced that. And the whole marriage union just kind of, you know, becomes very very mechanical and the dynamics dissipate and diminish and are gone and fade away because the world saps it out of the natural home. And the same devil and the same world wants to sap it out of your spiritual experience. But we want to rise up tonight and say, "I deny him. I deny his right." &gt;&gt; And I feel sorry for you if you sit here and let the devil cheat you out of that kind of an experience. &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for anybody that would sit back and say, "I sooner just live with my own miserable self." God help you. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to set you free. &gt;&gt; You want to shake yourself. &gt;&gt; Shake yourself. Come out of that dismal position that you're in. &gt;&gt; Let your mouth speak the truth &gt;&gt; rather than something that Satan who wants to give Satan any glory or credit tonight. &gt;&gt; He says in the last days and I'm going to close. I've got to close. I spoke of Isaac. Let me give you one more just before I move on to this last quote or two. David and when the morning was passed because David had a child with Basheba and God took him and he died. And when the morning was passed, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the Lord. The thing that David did displeased the Lord. There isn't anybody here but what? We have done things. We have thought things. We've committed things that has displeased the Lord. But that does not deter God from his objective. If he's got you assigned and allotted for a rapture and a change of this body, he's going to bring you to it one way or another. &gt;&gt; He will not be deterred. He will not be denied and he will not be defeated. &gt;&gt; He says of his bride, she's going to rise. She's going to stand. She's going to be established. She's going to come into my house. She's going to be my wife. &gt;&gt; And nothing's going to prevent that. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says in these last days, the true bride church, which he says is Christ's seed, &gt;&gt; will come to the headstone. Listen to this now. And she will be the super church, a super race. As she nears him, [Applause] as she nears him, her status is changed. Her whole realm of existence has changed. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And I can tell you when King David began to come near to Ba Sheba and she came near to him, her status changed. And Rahab when she came to the to Solomon her status changed from harlotry into the lineage of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; As she nears him and they and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be his very image. This in order to be united with him and they will be one. I say glory, &gt;&gt; glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; We are one with him, &gt;&gt; united with him, &gt;&gt; married to him, carrying his seed. &gt;&gt; What a great honor. &gt;&gt; What a place God has given us. &gt;&gt; Oh church. &gt;&gt; Oh church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an honor he's bestowed upon us. &gt;&gt; How lovely he is. &gt;&gt; Habitation. Even unto his habitation shalt thou seek, and thither shalt thou come. I send you home with those words. And thither you shall come. &gt;&gt; If you're not there yet, thither you shall come. &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless all of you who hear this word tonight. God bless you. This isn't friends. This isn't, you know, this isn't mild chicken soup tonight. I felt perhaps why it had to be a Wednesday night because those who really hunger and thirst after God, I feel come together on the night. And I God bless you. God bless you young people. And may you know something more about it. And let me tell you, protect your minds. And don't you let the devil try to tell you what this is all about and what sex is all about and what love is all about. They don't know nothing about it. Never have known anything about it. They've been perverted since Eden. &gt;&gt; They ate from the wrong tree, but we're eating from the right tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Oh, that thrills my soul is Jesus. He is more than life to me. &gt;&gt; And the fairest of 10,000 in my blessed Lord I see. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us sing it. Why don't we stand and while you're standing and getting ready, we're going to we're just bow and worship him. Tell him whatever's in your heart. So say whatever you want to say to him, &gt;&gt; however near he may be to you tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm so glad you came and ministered the way you did. So glad you spoken these things to us. Oh Lord Jesus, I would have no other desire than to tell his people about you and to admonish them and to instruct them, oh God, that they'll enter into and enter into something of a relationship and an intimacy that they've never experienced before. And may they go from this place realizing that you you have commanded us and commissioned us to seek after this habitation, this rapture habitation. Oh, this rapture realm, this rapture condition, this changing of our status and our position. And what a change it will be when we leave the status of this mortal, the status of this vile body and into the status of the immortal. Oh God, what a glorious, glorious rising and resurrection it is even now. No wonder your prophet said we're in the resurrection. We have been resurrected. Give the people understanding, I pray. and bless them immensely. I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Who can cheer the heart like Jesus? Oh, [Music] &gt;&gt; sing it out to him now. Oh, he present all divine and true and tender, pure and pre, precious. Oh, how sweet to call him mine. And all that thrills my soul is Jesus. [Applause] Oh, he is more &gt;&gt; so much more. The fairest of 10,000 10,000 in my blessed Lord I see and love of Christ so freely king and grace of God beyond on decree [Music] and mercy. Higher than the heaven, heaven and deeper than the deepest sea. [Music] All that thrills my soul in Jesus. And he is more than life [Music] and the fairest [Applause] 10,000 in my blessed Lord I see.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise and glorify my king. Oh, sing it now. Oh, that grills my soul is Jesus.

Pray the Holy Spirit just brood upon you. Just give him what is due to him. [Music] worthy lovely one lovely Lord Jesus. I pray Lord that each person that is here has participated in this service tonight has sat listened. Pray that you will increase I ask that you will increase the desire and the hunger. Oh God, let our thirst become so great until it is a pain within us. As your prophet said, the thirst can be a painful experience. Oh God, that we thirst after you. We long after you. It is, oh God, that our soul, our soul just cries out after you, oh God. And I pray this will be our experience. Let it be a quickened experience in the coming days. Oh, Holy Spirit, don't let the people be forgetful. Don't let the enemy take it out of their minds and out of their thoughts. But may they meditate upon it day and night, oh God. And oh God, may they say when they rise in the morning and throughout the day, I shall seek after your habitation. I shall seek after that secret chamber. I shall seek after that place that you have desired for me to enter into that I might have this continual relationship with you, oh Lord, my savior, my God, my bridegroom, and my husband. Ask you Lord that you'll please go with the people and as they meet and greet one another, may there be such a a a spirit, Lord, that flows from heart to heart, from one life to the other. There's someone weak tonight. There's someone, oh God, that Satan is trying to blockade and hinder. We deny and stand as a body of Christ. Jesus speak oh God through your church in the name of the Lord Jesus. And may they be delivered and set free by the power of Christ. Nothing to do of man but by the power of the Holy Spirit. For whom the sun sets free is free indeed. And oh God, may the people live and walk in the liberty that you have purchased for them. &gt;&gt; Bless the visitors that are with us tonight, Lord. Perhaps strange things they've heard, but let it ring true in their heart. And may there be a yay and amen, saying, "Well, your word is truth." &gt;&gt; Father, dismiss us and go with us and watch over each of us. protect us, I pray. And above all things, let us move into that rapture realm, that whole position, oh God, that you have for us. In the name of Jesus Christ, send us from this place happy and solemn and quiet and relaxed and at peace in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. It's all I can say. God bless you. be fruitful in this great kingdom of God that he's called you into. Hallelujah. You're a blessed people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not many people have this message that God has sent to us in this day. We thank God for it. Amen. Happy to have brother DJ back. You're bringing us greetings from Congo. Why don't you come and just give the people greetings and before we shake hands and go from here? Brother Dia couldn't get out, you know, for a few days and we're happy he was able to get out. God bless you. Looks like he lost a little bit of weight, too. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's that's a compliment. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I heard some of you been praying for us. The situation was a bit tense, but the Lord was with us. Um, some people lost their lives and so on, but God saw his children through and we think things are going to actually settle down um for the best and it's good to be here. God bless you and I guess that's it. Greetings from everybody to all the saints here, especially to brother Bisco, from brother Kumbi. I had a chance to be with him and speak for him and also brother Dioa they send the love and uh they both told me to tell everybody that u they truly love you. So they are looking forward to you coming back to see them. &gt;&gt; That's why you were there. &gt;&gt; Well it's it's not quite the same. So uh they did do a lot of printings at Shakana publication since the beginning of the year uh since January actually to when I was there they just finished about close to 2 million books. I was able to get some sample that uh praise the Lord to display this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And um brother Dio has determined I think to have the whole message printed in another two to three years he has the translator working basically day and night. I had a meeting with all of them and uh they tell me that he doesn't even allow them vacation time and his uh his quote is that the message is urgent while they come under the burden of the pastor and amen they seem to be willing to work that way. Please remember them in prayer and because they do depend on those prayers. God bless you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother DJ. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh just one thing, Wednesday, this is July the 6th, today. It's a reminder that camp registration forms are due this Sunday on the 10th.
