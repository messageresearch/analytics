[0:00] the Proverbs Chapter 6 my son if thou be
[0:04] shy for thy friend if thou Hast stricken
[0:07] thy hand with a stranger thou art snared
[0:10] with the words of thy mouth Thou Art
[0:12] taken with the words of thy mouth do
[0:14] this now my son and deliver thyself when
[0:18] thou art come into the hand of thy
[0:20] friend go humble thyself and make sure
[0:23] thy friend give not sleep to thine eyes
[0:26] nor Slumber to thine eyelids deliver
[0:29] thyself of as a roof from the hand of
[0:31] the Hunter and as a bird from the hand
[0:33] of the Fowler go to the aunt thou
[0:35] sluggard consider her ways and be wise
[0:38] which having no guide overseer or ruler
[0:42] provideth her meat in the summer and
[0:44] gathereth her food in the Harvest how
[0:46] long wilt thou sleep oh sluggard when
[0:49] wilt thou arise out of thy sleep yet a
[0:52] little sleep a little Slumber a little
[0:54] folding of the hands to sleep so shall
[0:57] thy poverty come as one that travelleth
[0:59] and th one is an armed man a naughty
[1:02] person a wicked man walketh with a
[1:04] throwed mouth he winketh with his eyes
[1:07] he speaketh with his feet he teacheth
[1:10] with his fingers frowardness is in his
[1:12] heart he deviseth Mischief continually
[1:15] he sweeth Discord therefore shall his
[1:18] Calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he
[1:20] be broken without remedy these six
[1:23] things doth the Lord hate yay seven are
[1:26] an Abomination unto him a proud look a
[1:29] lying tongue and hands that shed
[1:31] innocent blood and heart that deviseth
[1:34] Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift
[1:36] in running to Mischief a false witness
[1:39] that speaketh lies and he that Seth
[1:41] Discord among Brethren my son keep thy
[1:44] father's commandment and forsake not the
[1:47] law of thy mother bind them continually
[1:49] upon thine heart and tie them about thy
[1:52] neck when thou goest it shall lead thee
[1:55] when thou sleepest it shall keep thee
[1:58] and when thou awest it shall talk with
[2:00] thee for the Commandment is a lamp and
[2:03] the law is light and reproofs of
[2:05] instruction are the way of life to keep
[2:07] thee from the evil woman from the
[2:09] flattery of the tongue of a strange
[2:11] woman lust not after her beauty in thine
[2:13] heart neither let her take thee with her
[2:16] eyelids for by means of a horish woman a
[2:18] man is brought to a piece of bread and
[2:20] the adulterous will hunt for the
[2:22] precious life can a man take fire in his
[2:25] bosom and his clothes not be burned can
[2:28] one go upon hot coals and his feet not
[2:31] be burned so he that goeth into his
[2:33] neighbor's wife whosoever toucheth her
[2:36] shall not be innocent men do not despise
[2:39] a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul
[2:41] when he is hungry but if he be found he
[2:44] shall restore Sevenfold he shall give
[2:47] all the substance of his house but who
[2:49] so committeth adultery with a woman lath
[2:52] understanding he that doeth it
[2:54] destroyeth his own soul a wound and
[2:56] dishonor shall he get and his reproach
[2:59] shall not be wiped away for jealousy is
[3:01] the Rage of a man therefore he will not
[3:04] spare in the day of Vengeance he will
[3:06] not regard any Ransom neither will he
[3:08] rest content though thou givest many
[3:11] gifts
