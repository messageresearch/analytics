[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:36] I just have been turning [music] over a
[6:38] song in my uh in my heart and I just
[6:42] [music] wanted to hear it. [snorts]
[6:43] Savior, Savior,
[6:46] while in others thou art calling.
[6:48] [music] And then I just wanted to change
[6:50] this line.
[6:52] The songwriter said, "Do not pass me
[6:54] by." I want to say, "You will not
[6:56] [music] pass me by."
[6:58] He said, "Ask
[7:00] &gt;&gt; and you shall receive." Do you believe
[7:03] that? And I just would like to hear the
[7:07] congregation say, sing it. Savior,
[7:11] Savior. Brother Ryan, [music] would you
[7:18] Oh, [singing] pass
[7:21] me [music]

[8:29] Amen. You'll not pass me by. Oh, you
[8:32] [singing]
[8:33] will not pass [music] me. [singing] My
[8:39] savior. Savior.
[8:41] Oh my savior. [music]
[8:47] Oh Savior. [singing]
[8:52] for hear [music]
[8:53] my humble
[8:57] cry.

[9:15] [music and singing]
[9:16] me.
[9:19] [music]
[9:20] Thank you and God bless you. You may be
[9:22] seated.
[9:27] Last year I was not able to be here.
[9:31] I'm glad I'm here.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we're in the land of the living
[9:36] &gt;&gt; and able to say, "Savior,
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Savior,
[9:41] while on others,
[9:43] &gt;&gt; thou art calling. While on others, thou
[9:46] art calling,
[9:48] &gt;&gt; you'll not pass me by." Amen.
[9:53] We have guests and we always have
[9:55] wonderful things that are happening. And
[9:57] I spoke to a few folks at the dinner
[9:59] table tonight and said, "You're not
[10:02] having dinner at camp. That's not what's
[10:07] happening. You're actually sitting in
[10:09] the book of Acts." And I believe that
[10:12] with all my heart.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; I believe it. And because I believe it,
[10:17] I experience it. We are sitting in the
[10:20] book of Acts. You're not just having a a
[10:23] service in a tent and a in a camp
[10:27] meeting. We are living out the prophet
[10:30] of God has said you will write a book of
[10:34] acts behind it. And I believe that there
[10:37] is a book of acts being written. And
[10:40] just uh we want to greet uh some folks
[10:43] here. Uh
[10:46] there's always things happening. There
[10:48] are there are some folks here that have
[10:51] flown up from Denver to Seattle
[10:55] and from Seattle drove right here and
[10:58] got here.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy, would you like to
[11:06] invite them and then I would like to
[11:10] welcome someone?
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[11:13] Well, we have a special guest. Uh they
[11:15] just arrived to Seattle from Denver uh
[11:18] this afternoon and then they rented a
[11:20] car and then drove all the way here and
[11:23] getting so excited to be in the service.
[11:25] Uh I wonder if brother Tony Wong and
[11:28] sister Le Young they can stand up.
[11:34] [applause]
[11:43] I just want to share a little testimony
[11:45] how they came into the Lord. Uh I'll see
[11:48] how fervent u if you want to find
[11:51] somebody that's a fervent and zeal and
[11:53] passionate for God, you need to talk to
[11:55] brother Wong and sister uh Lily and they
[11:58] are one of they just arrived. Um and
[12:01] sister Ruse asked me uh do they realize
[12:03] that in the last few days we have a heat
[12:05] wave here? I said, "I'm sorry. We
[12:07] haven't even got a time to talk about
[12:09] the weather yet." Which is
[12:10] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[12:11] &gt;&gt; uh well, as soon as they arrived and we
[12:13] started to talk about the word, they
[12:15] started talking about how they sharing
[12:17] the message with uh the denominational
[12:19] church that they were in. The people
[12:21] they rejected him that he was sharing
[12:23] the message with them till almost 2:00
[12:27] that in the morning and the constantly
[12:29] just sharing the serpent seed and the
[12:31] message and it come to a time the devil
[12:34] started attacking our brother. Then he
[12:36] got uh vertical and he started throw up.
[12:38] Then he uh get up again. He said that
[12:40] you know what the devil tried to stop me
[12:42] to share in the word with them but I'm
[12:45] going to share the word no matter what
[12:46] happens to me. And that's a ferveny that
[12:49] we were talking about and how they came
[12:52] to this message and sister Juniper I
[12:55] wonder if you can stand up Juniper.
[12:59] the sister juniper a few years ago and
[13:02] uh she uh received the message and uh
[13:05] after she received the message she's not
[13:08] sitting still this is all happened that
[13:10] around us and she started sharing a
[13:12] message with the people and then it
[13:15] caused a big stir in the church in
[13:17] Beijing that's uh in China that the
[13:20] former denominational church they went
[13:22] to and then uh after sister Juniper
[13:25] shared a message uh with them and then
[13:28] the head leaders of that um uh
[13:30] denominational church and asked Jim and
[13:33] uh uh Shirley, I wonder brother Jim and
[13:36] Sister Shirley, can you stand up?
[13:39] &gt;&gt; And they asked them to come over to pull
[13:42] sister Juniper out of the cult.
[13:45] Aren't you glad you're in the cult
[13:49] and somebody care about you?
[13:52] So then they send brother Jim and Sister
[13:54] Shirley come over to pull sister Juniper
[13:56] out of the cult. And so brother Jim and
[13:59] sister Shirley come into the service and
[14:01] with a full intention want to pull her
[14:03] out of it. And while they were sitting
[14:06] in the church and sister Juniper doesn't
[14:08] say a lot of things she just said come
[14:10] and see. And so they come to the church
[14:13] brother Jim sitting there sister Shirley
[14:15] sitting there and as the music started
[14:18] as the singing started and they started
[14:20] petting their feet and they start to
[14:22] raising their hands. They kind of enjoy
[14:24] the atmosphere and afterward that they
[14:26] asked, "Do you know that they're a
[14:28] cult?" He said that they're a cult or
[14:29] not. I don't know, but I sense a
[14:32] different supernatural atmosphere. I
[14:33] never sense it anywhere.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, brother James is
[14:38] surely they were baptized in the name of
[14:40] Jesus Christ. [applause]
[14:46] &gt;&gt; And the story is not over.
[14:49] And then uh the burden came on brother
[14:51] Jim and sister Shirley and they uh
[14:54] invited brother Tony and sister Leoy
[14:57] then coming from China and they have the
[15:00] uh they have some uh task on their
[15:02] shoulder too because the leader said
[15:05] okay now we got a two already in the
[15:06] cult and you two go over there pull all
[15:09] of them out of the cult. So they coming
[15:12] over and sister Shirley and brother
[15:13] Jim's book a cruise they went to Alaska
[15:16] they're not talking about the weather.
[15:18] They're not talking about a cruise trip
[15:20] every morning. And this uh sister
[15:23] Shirley and the brother Jim just go to
[15:25] their door and knock on their door and
[15:27] said, "You want a Bible study?" And the
[15:30] whole week from the morning to night
[15:32] during the cruise and they're sharing
[15:35] the message with them and as soon as
[15:37] they're sharing about the serpent seed,
[15:39] brother Wong, brother Tony said that's
[15:41] exactly he said that's it. and all these
[15:44] uh church leaders the peoples that who
[15:48] consider to be spiritual and they never
[15:50] see it but for brother Tony the first
[15:52] time when brother Jim and sister shared
[15:54] that wisdom then he saw it
[15:57] &gt;&gt; and by God's grace a few months ago they
[16:00] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[16:03] [applause]
[16:08] [applause]
[16:08] so brother Ed we're talking about the
[16:10] book of act
[16:11] &gt;&gt; this is the book of act right in front
[16:13] of your eyes.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you and let us have a
[16:17] ferveny that passionate about what we
[16:20] heard. How the Lord has been preaching
[16:22] to us, how the Lord has been speaking
[16:24] the word to us. Now we saw that the word
[16:26] has uh been changing transformed this
[16:29] few people and they have a bird and a
[16:31] zeal in their heart. Every day brother
[16:33] Jim was sharing with his people that's
[16:35] in Beijing and sharing with them. They
[16:38] had a Bible study that in the Twasan
[16:40] there and they invited at a former
[16:42] denominational church members coming
[16:44] over and have a Bible study with them
[16:46] and sharing the word with them. But time
[16:48] after time people rejecting them don't
[16:51] believe what he said but God give them
[16:54] the burden in their heart. If I know
[16:56] something this is the truth I want to
[16:58] bring the truth to the people that
[17:00] whoever that encountered with. May the
[17:03] Lord bless you.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Murphy. God bless
[17:11] you. Thank you. [applause]
[17:13] And there's another sister here, not
[17:15] from China. She came originally from
[17:18] Russia.
[17:19] Bellarus, Russia. Sister Ena, wonder if
[17:23] you would stand up. Where's Sister Ena?
[17:27] Here. She is here. And her son. She
[17:30] brought her son, a 16-year-old son from
[17:34] Florida is standing there with her. And
[17:38] Sister Ena was standing in Russia when
[17:42] Sister Biscll and I were there in 1990.
[17:47] Now, many of you were not born at that
[17:50] time. Some of you were. And we communism
[17:54] had just fell, but the soldiers were
[17:58] still at the at guarding the doors of
[18:01] the hotel where the government assigned
[18:04] us to certain rooms and certain hotels.
[18:09] And we went there for one purpose and
[18:11] that is to see a elderly man my age or
[18:17] maybe older
[18:19] and he preached in communist Russia for
[18:23] 60 years. That is sister Ena's grandpa.
[18:28] And she was sitting in the church when I
[18:31] and my wife were there in 1990.
[18:35] and she remembers I don't remember my
[18:38] wife at the piano and sang a song and
[18:42] she remembers that listen friends and
[18:45] now she said I moved to Florida 5 years
[18:49] ago but I was in Moscow and you were
[18:53] there in Moscow we have been to
[18:55] Switzerland twice and she said and we
[18:59] heard about these meetings here this is
[19:02] not a meeting friends it's a book of
[19:04] acts
[19:05] Can you say
[19:06] &gt;&gt; amen?
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Are you happy that you're in the book of
[19:11] &gt;&gt; the book of Acts? And then maybe in when
[19:13] you read the book of Acts, you think,
[19:15] "Oh, I wish I was there." You're here.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; You're in another book of Acts, you're
[19:21] in a book of Acts that are spoke of. Do
[19:24] you believe that?
[19:25] &gt;&gt; I do with all my heart. Sister Ena,
[19:28] thank you for standing. her grandfather
[19:31] saw
[19:33] brother Brandham in a vision before he
[19:36] ever ever met him. And and he was
[19:40] sitting at a table on at this side of
[19:43] the pullpit and I was standing at the
[19:46] pulpit. And I said, "Your pastor had a
[19:50] vision of the messenger of this age, and
[19:55] now I am here behind the pulpit to tell
[19:58] you that I was with him." And friends,
[20:01] they listened. And out of that group has
[20:04] come some believers. And here's sister
[20:07] Ena and her son here in this service. I
[20:11] can tell you friends, I am here to
[20:13] witness to you young people that this is
[20:16] a continuation of the book of Acts. This
[20:19] is and someday you will find that it's
[20:21] another chapter of the book of Acts. God
[20:24] bless you.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; And now we're here to hear the rest of
[20:27] it. [applause]

[28:39] expecting
[28:40] supernatural things to take place. Every
[28:42] time God speaks with us, it's
[28:44] supernatural. Amen. But it's natural for
[28:46] him. I love how brother canandies
[28:48] brought that out once. With God, [music]
[28:49] nothing is supernatural because it's all
[28:51] natural to God. It's only supernatural
[28:53] to us. It's incredible. Amen. So, what
[28:56] you want for the Lord this camp? Amen.
[28:58] Just put it on your heart and I trust
[29:00] that God will meet your needs. [music]
[29:02] Amen. As we hear the word this weekend.
[29:05] Amen. Let's sing the song together. For
[29:06] the battle is the Lord's.
[29:09] There is a source [singing and music]
[29:14] in times of need
[29:19] that [music] gives me [singing]
[29:21] hope,
[29:23] that [music] brings me peace.
[29:29] [music]
[29:32] Through [singing] every test, my [music]
[29:36] savior,

[29:42] in my defense. So [singing] when the
[29:45] road So when the [music] road
[29:49] when the road
[29:52] leaves you tired [music and singing]

[30:01] torn. Just remember
[30:06] my [singing and music] God is greater
[30:08] than the storm.
[30:11] Don't take courage. [music and singing]

[31:27] verse. There is a source. Hallelujah.
[31:31] There is a source. Oh, [music] have you
[31:34] found [singing] that source, my brother,
[31:35] my sister, in your times of need.

[32:54] the waves he [music] holds my hand
[33:00] as my [music and singing] shers

[33:11] [music and singing]
[33:16] [music]
[33:17] Let's stand together
[33:22] [singing and music]
[33:24] and all your strength is gone
[33:26] [music and singing] and your heart feels
[33:29] to
[33:31] remember God [singing]
[33:34] is greater [music] than the storm. So
[33:38] take courage.
[33:42] I know [music and singing]
[33:43] the battle is over. I sing. Remember,
[33:46] God is greater. Oh, remember
[33:50] God is greater [music and singing] than

[34:02] again. Remember God. [music]
[34:04] Oh, remember God
[34:09] gone. [music]
[34:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:19] &gt;&gt; One more time. Say, say it one more
[34:21] time.
[34:23] Her [music] God
[34:26] is greater [singing] than the storm.
[34:31] Take her is Lord. [music]
[34:35] The [singing] battle is alone.
[34:38] [music]
[34:41] Hallelujah.
[34:44] I think we can praise him.
[34:48] [applause]
[34:49] [music]
[34:50] Hallelujah.
[34:57] We're expecting great things,
[35:00] &gt;&gt; young people. Are you expecting great
[35:01] things?
[35:02] &gt;&gt; As brother Biscll, [music]
[35:04] this is another chapter in the book of
[35:08] Acts. [music] And I I believe God's
[35:11] going to do exceedingly
[35:13] mo abundantly more
[35:16] than I could even ask or [music] think.
[35:19] And I want you to know this afternoon,
[35:21] we got alone with the Lord.
[35:24] And my expectancy is so high.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to let the devil have
[35:30] any room in this in this camp.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let any unbelieving
[35:35] spirit try and bind what God is going to
[35:37] do.
[35:39] I believe the Holy Spirit is here
[35:40] present to do more than you had even
[35:43] thought in your life.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; That we got young people that need a
[35:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost and a born
[35:49] again experience. And I'm believing
[35:51] God's going to use his servant
[35:54] &gt;&gt; in a mighty way. And if you don't want
[35:57] it, you give me your portion because I'm
[36:00] believing God is come down and is
[36:02] amongst us right now.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Right now. And I sent that prophet and
[36:08] he stood there, brother Ron. He just
[36:10] stood there and he says, "You know what
[36:12] I'm waiting for? You know what I'm
[36:15] waiting for?" [music] He said, "I'm
[36:17] waiting for him." He said, "That same
[36:19] one that led the children of Israel
[36:23] is that same one that you've seen in
[36:25] that picture." [music]
[36:26] He said, "I'm waiting for him." And just
[36:29] that moment, in that time, he said, "I
[36:32] take every spirit under my control for
[36:34] the glory of God." That God,
[36:38] &gt;&gt; that God is in this tent right now. That
[36:41] God is going to use the man of God
[36:43] tonight.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; And I just say, Lord, would you have
[36:46] your way? We have the privilege to have
[36:49] Brother Ron Spencer. And Sister [music]
[36:51] Connie, where are you? Sister Connie
[36:53] Spencer, where are you? Way in the back.
[36:56] Way back there.
[36:58] God bless you, Sister Connie. Thank you
[37:00] for coming to join with us in these
[37:02] meetings. We love you and your family
[37:06] dearly.
[37:08] What, brother Ron? But the ministry and
[37:11] what he's meant to this church,
[37:14] we can't write it down.
[37:16] Supernatural.
[37:18] [music] And we have the privilege to
[37:19] have brother Andrew, his son, who's
[37:22] going to be speaking in the morning. And
[37:24] [music] sister Katie, his wife, is here.
[37:26] And we feel privileged to have you, too,
[37:28] brother Andrew. May God use you in a
[37:31] mighty way.
[37:33] How many want more of God tonight?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Then you're going to get what you expect
[37:37] [music]
[37:38] &gt;&gt; because he's an unchanging God, brother
[37:40] Ram said, and he's unchanging in his
[37:43] [music] unexpected way. He said, if you
[37:46] want God to move, he always [music]
[37:49] moves in an unexpected time. So Lord,
[37:53] would you move at this time?
[37:56] We thank God for it.
[37:59] This is our our 33rd [music]
[38:02] family camp. 33 years ago.
[38:07] And God has kept [music] the vision that
[38:10] a pastor has had for us for 33 years.
[38:15] And as I say to the young people, is it
[38:18] worth it?
[38:19] Is it worth it?
[38:22] Is it worth it that when a man of God I
[38:24] got a pen down in my Bible in 1985
[38:28] [music]
[38:29] said I give you your children and I was
[38:31] a deacon in the back of the church and I
[38:34] wrote that down in my Bible and said I
[38:37] accept that and I claim my children in
[38:40] the name of the Lord Jesus. 10 years ago
[38:44] my third son [music] got saved here at
[38:47] this camp.
[38:50] The year we bought this camp, God gave
[38:53] me my final son, my [music] last son.
[38:56] And I say he g if he did it for me, he
[38:59] will do it for you tonight. And I want
[39:01] you to come and start pulling for these
[39:04] young people that God gives them a Holy
[39:06] Ghost experience. We talk about an upper
[39:09] room. The upper room is right here in
[39:12] this tent right now.
[39:14] So, I feel very privileged and honored
[39:17] to introduce Brother Ron Spencer,
[39:19] [music]
[39:20] a man of God and a privileged friend of
[39:24] mine.
[39:26] May God use him and may you pull on the
[39:29] gift because you're going to get what
[39:31] you expect. So, God bless you, Brother
[39:34] Ron Spencer. God bless you. Thank you
[39:38] for accepting to be with [music] us at
[39:40] this camp. May God use you in a mighty
[39:43] way.
[39:44] Amen. Why don't you come in?
[40:05] Bless you.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[40:13] Amen.
[40:18] I have so many emotions standing here
[40:20] tonight.
[40:22] I I just hope that I can just share them
[40:26] without a whole lot of
[40:31] breaking down.
[40:34] But I'm so privileged to be here to
[40:37] enjoy this incredible celebration of 10
[40:40] years of this camp.
[40:43] Maybe through through the service
[40:45] tonight I can share a few things, but I
[40:48] I'm honored to be here. Thank you for
[40:51] the invitation, Brother Tom and Brother
[40:53] Ed and the church. Thank you for having
[40:55] me here.
[40:57] This is almost like a reunion.
[41:01] And I see friends from all over. We
[41:04] certainly love you with all of our
[41:05] hearts. And uh we thank you for having
[41:09] us. and what incredible hospitality that
[41:11] you've given us. And I truly believe
[41:14] with all my heart that we have been
[41:17] called to a conference.
[41:22] And I believe that God's going to do
[41:24] incredible supernatural things.
[41:28] And how we already know is we've already
[41:30] seen
[41:32] already in this service what God is
[41:35] doing,
[41:36] &gt;&gt; not what a man is doing. Not what the
[41:40] influence of a man is doing, but what
[41:42] our God is doing among us.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Certainly thrilled
[41:48] to have Sister Connie with me. She was
[41:51] not able to be with me in Edmonton and
[41:54] we had wonderful meetings there and I
[41:56] see many Edmonton friends here tonight.
[41:58] And we love you. And God came on the
[42:02] scene for us there. And I believe he's
[42:04] the same God this week. Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Don't you love him?
[42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we could just talk to him
[42:13] for a moment. Heavenly Father, we love
[42:17] you with all of our hearts.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Now, as we turn to the word, Father, we
[42:23] would ask you once again that you would
[42:26] come.
[42:29] Now, we realize that, Father, that no
[42:31] man,
[42:33] no man can do anything, but you're the
[42:36] one that comes and does the work.
[42:39] I ask you, Father, that you'd bless this
[42:41] place
[42:43] like never before.
[42:46] And if we could have any gift at all
[42:48] tonight, might it be both as speaker and
[42:52] as hearer to get ourselves out of the
[42:55] way?
[42:57] Now Lord Jesus, we have come with many
[42:59] needs tonight and we believe that you're
[43:02] a way maker and you provide a way of
[43:04] escape.
[43:07] Father,
[43:09] as I was coming to the pull pit this
[43:12] evening, I my thoughts begin to go back
[43:14] to last year
[43:17] and you gave me a sermon to speak in
[43:19] this pull pit.
[43:22] And that sermon was, "Satan, you can't
[43:25] take his life."
[43:29] Brother Ed, as he stood to this pull pit
[43:31] tonight, Father,
[43:34] I thank you for the power of a
[43:37] resurrection.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; I thank you for the power of life and
[43:41] your healing touch,
[43:44] &gt;&gt; a miracle that has happened among us.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Dear God, we express our thanksgiving
[43:50] back to you and our hearts desire as a
[43:54] congregation, as a body of believers
[43:56] around the world.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; First of all, we stop and thank you.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[44:05] Thank you, dear God,
[44:07] &gt;&gt; that you brought doctors on the scene at
[44:10] the right time and
[44:12] &gt;&gt; the right kind of medicine.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; But Father, the high physician came on
[44:17] the scene and took the case.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, we thank you for that,
[44:23] Father.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you. I'm just consumed with
[44:29] what you are doing
[44:31] &gt;&gt; and we even what you're preparing to do.
[44:35] Lord, we we thank you for laying your
[44:38] hands on this camp.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; We thank you for laying your hands on
[44:42] this camp.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; This is your work.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; This is your vision.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; This is your plan and this is your
[44:51] purpose. And you've got a purpose for
[44:53] your seed.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:57] now be may Satan's plans be thwarted
[45:00] tonight and may he be defeated in the
[45:04] name of Jesus Christ we pray we dedicate
[45:08] and commit these meetings to you father
[45:11] and give oursel to your your service
[45:15] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[45:19] &gt;&gt; amen and amen
[45:22] bless you
[45:24] if you will turn with me to Isaiah
[45:25] chapter six. And
[45:28] I will [snorts] try my best not to hold
[45:30] you too long this evening, but I want to
[45:32] share some things that are just on my
[45:34] heart. Is that okay?
[45:39] I'd like to speak this evening on Mark
[45:43] this place.
[45:47] Mark this place.
[45:52] Not just a place in the scriptures,
[45:55] but mark this place where you're
[45:56] standing.
[45:59] Mark the place where you're sitting
[46:01] tonight.
[46:04] Mark this place.
[46:07] Remember this time
[46:10] cuz God chose to meet you here.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Not because you've gathered just to be
[46:16] at another meeting.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe you didn't even know who was
[46:20] speaking.
[46:22] Maybe you didn't even know kind of how
[46:24] the arrangements would be, but God
[46:28] rooted over you before the foundation of
[46:32] the world
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and knew that you would be here.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; So, he's has something provided for you.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; He pre-planned this meeting.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to share with you a
[46:45] couple of meetings that he has prepared
[46:47] this evening. in as we just turn our
[46:50] hearts toward him.
[46:52] Isaiah chapter 6 and verse one. Very
[46:56] important scriptures to the man that's
[46:59] going to be
[47:01] writing down and scribing the book of
[47:04] Isaiah.
[47:07] In the year that King Uzziah died,
[47:11] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[47:14] throne high and lifted up. and his train
[47:18] filled the temple. And above it stood
[47:21] serapants. Each one had six wings. With
[47:25] twain he covered his face, and with
[47:27] twain he covered his feet, and twain he
[47:30] did fly. One cried unto another and
[47:34] said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[47:37] hosts.
[47:39] The whole earth is full of his glory."
[47:43] And the post of the door moved at the
[47:45] voice of him that cried, and the house
[47:47] was filled with smoke. Then said I, "Woe
[47:51] is me, for I am undone, because I'm a
[47:55] man of unclean lips, and dwell in the
[47:58] midst of people of unclean lips, for
[48:01] mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord
[48:04] of hosts." Then flew one of the
[48:06] seraraphants unto me, having a live coal
[48:08] in his hand, and which he had taken from
[48:10] the tongs from off of the altar. And he
[48:13] laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo,
[48:16] this hath touched thy lips, and thine
[48:19] iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
[48:24] purged.
[48:26] And also I I heard the voice of the Lord
[48:29] saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will
[48:34] go for us?"
[48:36] And then said I, "Here am I. Send me."
[48:42] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[48:52] Isaiah chapter 118 and verse 23.
[48:58] The scripture said this
[49:01] is the Lord's doing.
[49:05] It is marvelous in our eyes. I pray that
[49:10] we can look beyond mortality even now
[49:14] human instrumentality
[49:17] beyond who's sitting beside of you and
[49:19] who's speaking
[49:22] and catch what God is doing here tonight
[49:26] the realm of time that we're standing
[49:29] the conditions of the world the prophecy
[49:33] that actually we are a part of the
[49:35] fulfilling even right Now
[49:39] verse 24 said, "This is the day which
[49:43] the Lord hath made."
[49:46] &gt;&gt; We will rejoice
[49:49] &gt;&gt; and be glad in it.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Our prophet said that's what's happening
[49:53] today. He predestinated it to this by
[49:58] his fornowledge when he predestinated in
[50:01] Malachi 4 that it's going that it's got
[50:04] to happen. When he came over and
[50:07] predestinates anything to happen in his
[50:10] word, he had to prove his word to be so.
[50:15] And when he predestinates anything to
[50:18] happen and says that it will happen, he
[50:21] knows that that seed will be there just
[50:25] at that time.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; He predestinated abroad.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; He predestinated a bride.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; He's talking about you.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; He predestinated a bride.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; She's going to be there.
[50:47] going to be a rapture.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; She's going to be there.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; He predestinates it by his fornowledge.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing
[51:00] &gt;&gt; that's going to stop it.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; I love that. Don't you?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I want you to hear the prophet as he
[51:08] begins to speak. And just I'll just
[51:10] share this in my opening comments.
[51:14] Brother Brandham just shares his desire
[51:16] and shares his passion and shares where
[51:19] he's standing.
[51:20] He said, "I love him
[51:23] and I want you to love him.
[51:26] I want you to believe him."
[51:30] Perfect love casteth out all fear. Amen.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; And if you love him with the right kind
[51:38] of a heart, you won't have one speck of
[51:41] fear,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; whether you can keep his word or not.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; I'd like to say booevil right there.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; It's not you keeping the word, but it's
[51:50] the seed that's on the inside of you.
[51:56] Night after night, standing on the
[51:58] platform before the gross thousands of
[52:00] people around the world, critics sitting
[52:04] there saying, "Is this that or another
[52:07] witch doctor standing there trying to
[52:10] throw spells on you, challenge you to
[52:12] dus and things like that?" Never one
[52:15] time.
[52:17] And I say by the grace of God has one
[52:21] speck of fear ever hit my heart. Not one
[52:25] time.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Why? He said he would take care of me.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; He asked the question why he said he
[52:34] would take care of me.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And I believe him.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That's why if I would get scared, I'd
[52:43] run. Now, let me just say, God not only
[52:46] gave our prophet that promise, but what
[52:48] about you tonight?
[52:50] &gt;&gt; He said he would take care of you.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Did God make that promise?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, did God make the
[53:01] promise?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Absolutely, he made the promise. And
[53:04] he's an infinite God, and God's never
[53:07] failed.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; He's never lied. He's never been in a
[53:13] crisis.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; He predestinates it to happen. And it's
[53:18] got to be that way.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And all of hell can't stop it.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; All of hell can't stop it.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; The greatest imps, the greatest demons
[53:26] of hell cannot stop the power of what
[53:30] God [screaming] is doing even in this
[53:32] moment.
[53:37] But I tell you, when Jesus Christ
[53:41] anoints you, you're not made out of
[53:43] running material.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Not the Rock of Gibraltar, but the Rock
[53:52] of Ages.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; You climb up in the rock of ages. That's
[53:56] God's word. and take your position there
[53:59] and stand when the gates of hell is
[54:01] battling against it with this perfect
[54:04] assurance
[54:05] &gt;&gt; that he who promised it
[54:12] &gt;&gt; will not fail. It'll never fail.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's faith.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; And that's when you're not scared. The
[54:21] devil's nothing but a bluff anyhow.
[54:23] snorting and blowing and all the thunder
[54:26] and the and no lightning. But I tell
[54:28] you, brother, that the lightning power
[54:31] of the resurrected Jesus Christ puts a
[54:34] reality there that shocks the soul from
[54:37] a dead slumber of these earthly bound
[54:40] things into the immortal realms to
[54:42] believe God and to take him at his word
[54:45] and call those things which are not as
[54:48] though they [screaming] were.
[54:54] Hallelujah.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. I just get a little bit
[55:00] excited. And that's the way it is.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 1 and verse 5.
[55:06] Before I formed thee,
[55:10] &gt;&gt; in the belly,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; I knew thee,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; and before thou camest forth out of the
[55:17] womb, I sanctified thee.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And I ordained thee a prophet unto the
[55:24] nations.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Now listen as a prophet says this. And
[55:28] he said, "Now God's strategy is to take
[55:31] empty human vessels
[55:33] &gt;&gt; and shake the world with them.
[55:37] Like at Pentecost. At Pentecost, what
[55:40] did he do? He taken them 10 days and to
[55:43] get them all emptied out. He said, "But
[55:46] they was all standing there with their
[55:48] vessels turned up. And God took himself
[55:51] and filled them up. That's all. And they
[55:54] shook the world with it."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That's the need of today. That's what we
[55:59] need today is empty vessels
[56:02] &gt;&gt; so God can fill them up. Who's he
[56:04] talking to tonight?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Me and you.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Who's the challenge to tonight? We're
[56:11] not waiting for somebody else to come.
[56:13] This is our hour.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ronnie, wish somebody else
[56:21] was in the building. God chose you.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And God ordained you.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; He watched over your path getting here.
[56:28] He watched over your mother and father's
[56:30] path and your grandfathers and your
[56:32] great-grandfathers and the generations
[56:34] all the way back and pre-planned it. He
[56:37] was determined to take care of the
[56:39] natural seed,
[56:42] knowing that you would get here, knowing
[56:44] your hair color, knowing what your eyes
[56:46] would look like, even your human nature.
[56:49] God knew that he was going to call you
[56:51] in this day to hear this predestinated
[56:55] word
[56:57] &gt;&gt; and you would meet the challenge of
[56:59] [screaming] this day.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; You are that thousands of lived voices.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; A prophet would speak a few sermons on
[57:17] influence.
[57:19] He would understand influence.
[57:22] He had dealt with a lot of influences.
[57:26] Influential men around him. Influential
[57:29] men that had a a lot of opinions.
[57:33] Influential men that wanted to push him
[57:36] this way or that way.
[57:39] Some of them wanted to him to quit
[57:41] preaching on how women ought to dress.
[57:45] Maybe if he could just if he could just
[57:48] uh maybe just back off and teach them
[57:51] gifts
[57:56] &gt;&gt; because the message
[57:58] had a great attraction to it,
[58:01] &gt;&gt; but they wanted to polish it up.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; These were men of schools. These are men
[58:07] of great organization.
[58:10] They knew that this had life in it, but
[58:13] they couldn't take the word test.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; So, he knew what influence was.
[58:20] So when he would walk to the pullpit and
[58:22] speak a sermons like the influence of
[58:24] another
[58:26] or influence,
[58:28] he was not just speaking it because it
[58:30] was a good topic
[58:34] &gt;&gt; because he understood what the influence
[58:38] of even denomination or organization or
[58:41] leotaa
[58:43] was putting on the church.
[58:46] And he like Isaiah
[58:50] &gt;&gt; could not get his eyes on the kings of
[58:53] this world
[58:56] &gt;&gt; or the great men of this world
[58:58] &gt;&gt; because he had had a meeting.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; He had had a conference
[59:05] &gt;&gt; in another realm.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; That's our challenge today. To meet a
[59:11] living God.
[59:14] to meet the God of this message.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Isaiah was an important man of the
[59:20] scripture. He will write a commentary.
[59:24] He will write a prophetic book.
[59:27] In the Old Testament, he will very be a
[59:30] very key man. But being a key man, he
[59:34] had grew up under the influence of a
[59:36] king.
[59:38] This king had a a very good background.
[59:41] and he had a very good heritage.
[59:44] But this king got lifted up and got his
[59:48] eyes on a position that was not his
[59:51] &gt;&gt; and he began to allow things to happen.
[59:55] God could not allow him to continue in
[59:57] the in the position that he was in.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; But you see, God had a plan.
[1:00:04] And maybe you have got your eyes on
[1:00:06] different things of this world,
[1:00:09] different different aspects of this
[1:00:11] world and different influences of this
[1:00:13] world that may has draw you in different
[1:00:16] directions.
[1:00:17] But maybe tonight if we could just stop
[1:00:20] for a few minutes and look into another
[1:00:22] realm,
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; God would like to pull our eyes off of
[1:00:29] the things of the world
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; and put us in a direction and a direct
[1:00:34] channel where he can speak to you.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] More than the effects of a camp,
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; more than some temporary weak or two
[1:00:46] sensationalism about it,
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; more than some emotion, but [laughter]
[1:00:51] an anchor
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; that will anchor your soul for the rest
[1:00:55] of your lives
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; more than some sensationalism.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:08] something that will anchor you.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Let me just say sometimes we've got to
[1:01:14] come like Jacob did.
[1:01:17] Jacob had the birthight now in his
[1:01:19] hands.
[1:01:21] Jacob was blessed. He could see the
[1:01:24] blessing around him. Everything he
[1:01:26] touched seemed to be blessed. But he was
[1:01:29] making his way back to his homeland. And
[1:01:32] he knew,
[1:01:34] I just can't even live with myself.
[1:01:39] You know, sometimes we've got to come to
[1:01:41] that spot in our life.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; May I speak it not just to the seen
[1:01:47] audience, but maybe even the unseen.
[1:01:50] There's decisions that have been made,
[1:01:53] actions that have been done
[1:01:56] that has caused incredible hurt and
[1:01:59] pain, choices that have been made. As
[1:02:03] our prophet says, choices will
[1:02:07] will take us somewhere.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Choices will send you down a path.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Decisions have consequences to them.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; They will not just affect you.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; As a young person, they'll affect your
[1:02:23] your family.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; They'll affect your future family.
[1:02:31] That's right.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; They'll affect generations.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; And Satan would tell you that it's just
[1:02:38] a that you you've got to make your own
[1:02:42] decisions. And you and and and he begin
[1:02:45] to show you opportunities. And you see,
[1:02:48] he showed Jesus opportunities.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He showed lot opportunities.
[1:02:58] He'll show you opportunities
[1:03:01] and sometimes you can't see because of
[1:03:04] your human
[1:03:06] ability. You can't see past tomorrow
[1:03:10] of where this decision is going to take
[1:03:12] us.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Satan will talk a man into smoking one
[1:03:17] cigarette.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; And brother Mannon said he don't have to
[1:03:22] tell him no more to do it.
[1:03:24] listening to one piece of rock music.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Or one wrong thing on an internet and
[1:03:32] before long it becomes a rolling vortex.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And after a while,
[1:03:38] guilt begins to set in and condemnation
[1:03:41] and traps and chains of circumstances
[1:03:45] begin to be wound around you.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Before long, like like Jacob, he's
[1:03:50] deceived his brother. He's deceived his
[1:03:52] father-in-law. His family knows that
[1:03:55] he's living a lie.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing that will fix
[1:03:59] that, and that's God.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's God. That's the only thing that
[1:04:07] will fix it.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; It's God to come on the scene in your
[1:04:11] life.
[1:04:20] He didn't know where the the meeting was
[1:04:22] going to be at,
[1:04:25] but he got himself alone.
[1:04:31] You know, God be to move to force him to
[1:04:34] get himself alone.
[1:04:40] He thought he was making the choices,
[1:04:44] but God had a plan
[1:04:46] to get him alone.
[1:04:49] He got Isaiah alone.
[1:04:52] Sometimes [snorts] he has to get you
[1:04:53] alone.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; And he pulls you a place alone to where
[1:04:58] that he can deal personally with you.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; And he gets you to a place to where it's
[1:05:03] just you and him.
[1:05:06] a place to where that he can
[1:05:08] supernaturally speak to your life.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Jacob didn't know what kind of a place
[1:05:20] that he was at until he came.
[1:05:24] We can read the scriptures that that an
[1:05:27] angel came
[1:05:29] and he wrestled with that angel.
[1:05:35] Could we say this tonight that Jacob
[1:05:37] wrestled with him because he refused to
[1:05:40] stay the way that he was?
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Jacob knew Jacob.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; You know you.
[1:05:51] It's not your mom and dad or your
[1:05:53] grandma and your granddad or pastor.
[1:05:55] It's you and God.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; This is an individual relationship.
[1:05:59] Brother Ron, but I've came to camps
[1:06:01] before and I've walked to altars before,
[1:06:03] but you know where you are today. Now, I
[1:06:06] don't want to just talk to the front
[1:06:08] row. I want to go all the way to back
[1:06:09] row.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; We know where we're at.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; We know oursel. We see our condition.
[1:06:16] And now God has brought us to a place to
[1:06:19] where we can have a personal meeting. If
[1:06:23] we're not careful, we'll wrestle with
[1:06:25] our own self-will.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Our own self-will will wrestle with
[1:06:30] that.
[1:06:32] But if we could only grab a hold tonight
[1:06:35] and say, "God, don't leave me like I am.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Don't leave me like I am.
[1:06:46] I've got to have a change.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what put that desire on the inside
[1:06:52] of us?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Because we couldn't seek for God. God
[1:06:57] came seeking for us.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; And so, under the atmosphere of that
[1:07:02] presence, something comes to life.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; We couldn't bring it to life, but that
[1:07:09] something comes to life. Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Our prophet would call it gene seed,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; God DNA.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; It would be on the inside of us
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; and it would begin to come to life.
[1:07:26] This is more than about a church society
[1:07:31] going to a church.
[1:07:35] God wants to have a personal
[1:07:36] relationship with you.
[1:07:45] And Jacob begins to hold on.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I think about when brother Brandham
[1:07:50] prays for that little girl in Jonesboro,
[1:07:53] Arkansas.
[1:07:55] When she recognizes
[1:07:58] that it's brother Brandham
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; that is standing in front of her.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:08:04] when she recognizes that brother
[1:08:06] Brandamus is there and he has to explain
[1:08:10] to her I'm not the healer.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; But all she knew was she had to get to
[1:08:16] him.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And she's told brother Brandham if if I
[1:08:20] can get to William Brandham I can get to
[1:08:23] my daddy.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; And she's recognized I've come to this
[1:08:29] meeting and I don't want to go home
[1:08:31] blind.
[1:08:37] Are you with me now?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; She was living in a condition and
[1:08:42] refused to go home blind.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; She refused. If I can get to this man
[1:08:48] where where Jesus is operating in. If I
[1:08:52] can get to him,
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; I won't have to feel around in the
[1:08:57] night. I'll be able to see what color
[1:08:59] dress I've got on. I'll be able to see
[1:09:01] everything that around me. I'll see the
[1:09:03] sun come up in the morning. I'll see the
[1:09:06] stars at night.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; If I can get to him,
[1:09:13] I'll find my daddy.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; When she recognized who he was, she
[1:09:23] grabbed the lapels of his coat.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; She held on.
[1:09:31] She held on. I'm sure that made him feel
[1:09:33] uncomfortable.
[1:09:35] As a man of God, I'm sure that made him
[1:09:37] feel uncomfortable. Now she's got a hold
[1:09:39] of him.
[1:09:41] But she refuses to let loose.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; I would ask you tonight,
[1:09:51] could you kind of get a little bit even
[1:09:53] out of your own human order and grab a
[1:09:56] hol and hang on?
[1:10:03] If I could ask you tonight,
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; you're tired of just sitting in a pew
[1:10:09] and going through the the run of the
[1:10:11] emotions. And
[1:10:14] that's for somebody else. And
[1:10:18] I'm tried. I've made promises. I've made
[1:10:20] vows. I've I I've did all different
[1:10:22] kinds of things. But but God has called
[1:10:24] a conference tonight. It is God that has
[1:10:26] called this conference. And I don't want
[1:10:28] to miss this. How many time did the
[1:10:31] brother brother Brandham tell us, don't
[1:10:32] miss this.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this. Oh, but I wasn't in his
[1:10:37] meeting. But this is a book of Acts for
[1:10:39] you.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to just call to you.
[1:10:44] Don't miss this.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; To miss this.
[1:10:54] How many have we saw set in places like
[1:10:57] you're sitting at?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; And just take it for another service.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Where are their lives at today?
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Where did their choices take them? I'm
[1:11:08] sorry to go negative for a moment, but
[1:11:10] where did their choices take them?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; I would tell you tonight, there's no
[1:11:15] life out there.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; There's no life out there.
[1:11:25] Where's their denominations taking them?
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Where? Where is their
[1:11:31] pulpits leading them?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Why one word out of place is separation
[1:11:37] from God?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Just one word.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; To walk away from the message of the
[1:11:44] hour separates you.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:11:51] And I'd say if I was in that condition,
[1:11:53] I would call, I would dig, I would
[1:11:56] scream. I'd eat every bit of pride that
[1:11:59] I could to scream my way back to
[1:12:01] Calvary.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; She held on.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; We have a testimony because she held on.
[1:12:20] Her eyes came open because she held on.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Jacob held on to the angel.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Jacob wrestled [screaming] with him.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And Jacob wrestled with him until the
[1:12:33] sun was beginning to come up.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And he wrestled with him and he held on.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; He refused to go home. Jacob,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; God put this on my heart, so I'm just
[1:12:50] delivering it to you with with all my
[1:12:52] heart.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I was at a place in my life one time
[1:12:57] that I refused.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; I refused.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to live that way no more.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; and something on the inside of me was
[1:13:08] calling to a higher walk.
[1:13:11] I remember that place.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; I remember that time. I remember that
[1:13:17] moment
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; where I met the voice behind the voice.
[1:13:33] I walked into the tent
[1:13:38] yesterday
[1:13:40] with brother Tom
[1:13:44] and I saw the painting that is behind me
[1:13:53] and I was filled with emotion.
[1:14:00] Because that painting
[1:14:02] has become a part of my life.
[1:14:07] It has been interweaved with the fabric
[1:14:09] of my being.
[1:14:12] Switzerland.
[1:14:16] Brother David Mayor is here and I I
[1:14:18] can't find him just now. It's hard to
[1:14:21] hard to believe I can't find a man that
[1:14:23] tall.
[1:14:30] And I'd meet friends like brother David
[1:14:33] and brother Daniel and I I Brother
[1:14:36] Gito's daughter's in the building.
[1:14:39] Sister Jessica's son is here.
[1:14:43] God bless you.
[1:14:47] Brother Biscll would call me and he
[1:14:50] would share his burden
[1:14:53] for the people of Switzerland and all
[1:14:56] the countries around.
[1:15:04] He's quite a salesman.
[1:15:09] Has incredible passion.
[1:15:14] But you see, he delivered the message,
[1:15:18] but God wouldn't allow it to just be
[1:15:21] passed over.
[1:15:24] I couldn't go that first year.
[1:15:31] But brother David, when I went with
[1:15:34] Brother Biscll and Brother Tom and
[1:15:37] the other ministers that were there,
[1:15:40] something gripped my heart.
[1:15:44] And this place,
[1:15:47] this place
[1:15:49] became a conference
[1:15:55] and we would witness through the last
[1:15:57] years.
[1:15:59] People come from all over
[1:16:03] and they would be like Isaiah and be
[1:16:06] like Jacob
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; and they would rrestle it out.
[1:16:12] Brother David, you send out
[1:16:14] announcements and you you guys do a
[1:16:16] phenomenal job of setting that meeting
[1:16:18] up. And I'd say it's beyond human effort
[1:16:20] that does it.
[1:16:23] You send an invitation out. Come. You
[1:16:27] don't know who's coming,
[1:16:29] what walks of life that they're coming.
[1:16:33] And they come.
[1:16:35] They come to the meeting.
[1:16:38] And in that meeting,
[1:16:41] he gathers. You see, no man can gather
[1:16:45] the seed of God.
[1:16:47] It's God that sends forth his word.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; He sends forth his word and he begins to
[1:16:54] he begins to anoint
[1:16:58] anoint men to come and stand in the
[1:17:00] pullpit and speak the words of life.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] Not with agenda of mankind but an agenda
[1:17:09] of the word of God
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; that this message would be exalted. The
[1:17:16] Christ of this message would be exalted
[1:17:18] and it would find its bedding grounds.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And we can mark that place.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; We can mark that spot. We've seen it
[1:17:32] over and over. Brother Random said God
[1:17:34] calls a conference.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; He said men call a conference. He said
[1:17:38] they'll call the Geneva conference and
[1:17:40] they'll call other conferences and
[1:17:42] they'll get together and they'll fuss
[1:17:44] with one another and they'll come to
[1:17:45] some sort of a decision. But God calls a
[1:17:48] conference.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; It makes a major difference when God
[1:17:52] calls the conference.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; He is determined to get his seed.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:07] Hallelujah.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; How many of this is the first time here
[1:18:16] tonight? First time you've ever been to
[1:18:18] this camp.
[1:18:20] Thank you.
[1:18:22] Thank you.
[1:18:25] Thank you.
[1:18:28] Now, this is not choreographed or
[1:18:30] neither did I run this by Brother
[1:18:32] Biscell or Brother Tom or any of the men
[1:18:35] that's working.
[1:18:41] You look around, this is more than just
[1:18:43] a nice place.
[1:18:51] This took vision.
[1:18:55] This took immense amount of money.
[1:18:58] This took a
[1:19:00] the amount of effort of an army almost
[1:19:05] of volunteers.
[1:19:08] Now a decade.
[1:19:11] Sometimes we walk up to a painting and
[1:19:13] we don't know what what that painting
[1:19:15] actually cost.
[1:19:17] You go, "Oh, that's nice."
[1:19:20] And we don't know it took a lifetime of
[1:19:22] a honing a gift to make that painting.
[1:19:27] I'll speak maybe later in the week.
[1:19:30] Sister Marilyn's an incredible artist,
[1:19:35] but it's a life's work.
[1:19:43] This camp
[1:19:45] and these young men that's working
[1:19:50] sitting all in the back and working all
[1:19:52] over the building. They were once
[1:19:54] sitting in seats like you are.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; When we hear Isaiah say, not only did
[1:20:02] God speak to him, but then he responded
[1:20:04] back to God. Here am I send me.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; It's not just answering to a voice and
[1:20:12] believing a voice, but there's work to
[1:20:15] do.
[1:20:17] There's incredible work [screaming] to
[1:20:19] do. And
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; God wants you. He wants your hands.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; He wants your energies.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; He wants your life.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; God wants to use you.
[1:20:40] When I look around at this this camp,
[1:20:45] it holds incredible memories for me.
[1:20:49] Can I just share a few things here? Very
[1:20:52] personal. This is the 10th anniversary
[1:20:54] of this camp
[1:20:57] of Bayern Mount Baker camp and it
[1:21:00] becoming what it is.
[1:21:05] This is more than brother Biscll's
[1:21:06] vision.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; This is God's vision.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; This is God's thoughts.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we go, I want to see a
[1:21:19] miracle.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You're sitting on one.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; You're sitting on one.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; God provided this.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, Brother, I want to see something
[1:21:30] God's done. Look around.
[1:21:35] Just look around.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know of all how the workings
[1:21:45] that this camp came about,
[1:21:48] but I'd like to take you to
[1:21:51] one of the first phases of my
[1:21:55] I'd been to other camps.
[1:21:58] I'd never been to this one.
[1:22:04] Where I first would get acquainted with
[1:22:06] the first year of this camp was
[1:22:10] was when I was in a coma
[1:22:15] and I was laying
[1:22:18] burned 75% of my lungs burned.
[1:22:24] I had pneumonia
[1:22:29] on the very day, not two weeks later,
[1:22:32] not a month later,
[1:22:35] not six weeks later, did we figure out
[1:22:38] some things and put some things together
[1:22:39] to make it look right, but on the very
[1:22:42] day
[1:22:45] that the doctors would say there was no
[1:22:47] hope and no way and no chance and
[1:22:50] there's no way
[1:22:54] On that very day, God speaks to your
[1:22:57] pastor.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; God speaks to your pastor.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That brother Ron will be the speaker
[1:23:06] next year.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to just think just for a
[1:23:09] moment of the impossible human thinking.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Absolutely.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Think of the impossible. Sometimes we
[1:23:18] think, well, man puts this all together.
[1:23:19] I want to just stop and let's just
[1:23:22] consider the miracles.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Let's just consider the miracles first
[1:23:28] of all that this ground has provided.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Of all the places in British Columbia,
[1:23:36] Colombia and and Washington, this piece
[1:23:40] of ground
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; is provided
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; in one of the most beautiful areas in
[1:23:47] all of Washington.
[1:23:54] God provides this.
[1:23:58] I would say that Satan giggled.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; The morning that brother Biscoll called
[1:24:07] sister Connie
[1:24:09] and my oldest son that had pulled me out
[1:24:12] of the fire was in one hospital
[1:24:16] and I was in another hospital.
[1:24:21] Not just in a hospital, but in a burn
[1:24:23] unit
[1:24:25] on life support with zero chance of
[1:24:27] living.
[1:24:32] Doctors, nurses here,
[1:24:35] you know what? 75% of your lungs, not
[1:24:38] just your lungs, but your throat, your
[1:24:40] mouth, all of the inner workings of your
[1:24:42] mouth, your lips, your face, your arms,
[1:24:46] your body is burned.
[1:24:51] Just when it looks impossible to man
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; in that state,
[1:24:57] God anoints a servant of the Lord.
[1:25:06] Well, brother Ron, I'd like to see
[1:25:08] vindication.
[1:25:17] If not just this miracle,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; God speaks to your pastor. He will be
[1:25:24] the speaker next year.
[1:25:31] Brother Matt, that's beyond human
[1:25:33] thought, human.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I would lay for another couple of weeks.
[1:25:39] [laughter]
[1:25:41] I wouldn't know anything about the plans
[1:25:43] of God.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I would come into a condition where that
[1:25:47] I would be 36 hours literally
[1:25:50] nonresponsive.
[1:25:52] And if God doesn't work a miracle in
[1:25:55] five more hours, they're going to take
[1:25:57] my organs.
[1:26:03] Brother Tim Puit stands in my home
[1:26:05] church and he preaches two sermons.
[1:26:07] God's Hall of Fame. Some way by faith,
[1:26:10] brother Jimbo, he's he puts me in God's
[1:26:13] Hall of Fame.
[1:26:18] And on the day that I went nonresponsive
[1:26:23] where that the doctors couldn't figure
[1:26:25] out what went wrong, he stands in the
[1:26:27] pull pit in my pullpit at home and
[1:26:31] preaches God will have a testimony.
[1:26:38] And the next morning I woke up.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:26:53] [applause]
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; God had a plan.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; God had a plan.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll chose since all of this
[1:27:09] had happened in our lives,
[1:27:12] chose to bring our family
[1:27:17] Brother Andrew, Sister Katie, Brother
[1:27:20] Matthew, and Sister Cassie, and you
[1:27:22] chose to bring my father and my mother.
[1:27:28] And they came and
[1:27:31] they came to that meeting. And my father
[1:27:33] told me just last week, he said, "I'll
[1:27:35] tell you." And he said, "You can tell
[1:27:37] Brother Biscll this." And so I'm doing
[1:27:39] this very public now.
[1:27:42] He said, "That was the greatest vacation
[1:27:45] I've ever had
[1:27:47] in my entire life
[1:27:50] when I got to come to that camp meeting.
[1:27:55] You can go all over the world and do all
[1:27:58] kind of worldly things and but let me
[1:28:00] just say this to you. To come to a spot
[1:28:02] like this
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; where you meet God,
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; there's just nothing greater.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about the value
[1:28:17] of a seed.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; It's worth 10 million worlds.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; 10 million worlds. Now think about that.
[1:28:30] God in his infant mind
[1:28:33] called you before the foundation of the
[1:28:36] world. Then he chose the place to meet
[1:28:38] you at.
[1:28:42] Brother Joel Ray.
[1:28:45] Brother Joel Ray, would you just stand?
[1:28:52] Sister Joanne.
[1:28:55] Sister Joanne, where's she at?
[1:29:00] She had a burden on her heart for her
[1:29:02] third son.
[1:29:09] She had expressed
[1:29:12] her burden to her father.
[1:29:20] She wanted life for her son.
[1:29:25] Let me explain to you. We're not
[1:29:27] satisfied
[1:29:30] with just living a good worldly life.
[1:29:36] We want
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; eternity.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; We want Christ [screaming]
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; with everything that is within us.
[1:29:45] Brother Tom,
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; we won't negotiate for something second
[1:29:50] class.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; We want God. We've got a covenant with
[1:29:56] God.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; We've got a covenant with God. Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; This covenant is with God and he's and
[1:30:06] he's bound [screaming] to his own word.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; And we gave Joel
[1:30:15] to God when he was born
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; and she was not willing
[1:30:21] for Satan to destroy his life
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; in that meeting.
[1:30:32] God came on the scene
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; being rich in mercy
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; and grabbed a hold. Are you with me now?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; More than emotion,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; more than some sensationalism.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; But God grabbed a hold of his life. You
[1:30:50] see, he's determined.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; He's determined to get his seed.
[1:30:58] He'll bankrupt heaven to get to where
[1:31:01] you're at.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; He went to the woman at the well. He
[1:31:05] knows where she was.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; He [screaming] knows how to come and get
[1:31:08] a hold of your life. He's not ashamed
[1:31:11] tonight to come and get a hold of you.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; That night
[1:31:22] changed Joel Ray's
[1:31:26] life.
[1:31:31] How long did it take? Just a moment.
[1:31:36] Just a moment.
[1:31:39] Just a moment.
[1:31:41] And you're just not no more the same,
[1:31:44] Brother Joel.
[1:31:47] Now,
[1:31:48] this is all right, Sister Joanne. I'm
[1:31:50] sorry to keep you standing.
[1:31:53] Brother Joel, that that didn't just
[1:31:55] affect you.
[1:31:59] Where's your father-in-law?
[1:32:02] Could you stand?
[1:32:05] Where's your mother-in-law?
[1:32:10] Could you stand?
[1:32:13] Is your wife in the building? No,
[1:32:17] she's working.
[1:32:24] Your baby
[1:32:27] Good for them.
[1:32:30] And we thank the Lord Jesus for his
[1:32:32] miracle of peace,
[1:32:37] brother Joel. We could say tonight that
[1:32:41] you see God put it on your heart, Sister
[1:32:43] Joanne,
[1:32:46] because you'd made a covenant many years
[1:32:48] ago. And we heard brother Tom Ray speak
[1:32:51] earlier about writing it down on the fly
[1:32:53] leaf of his Bible. Just writing it down.
[1:32:58] Brother Biscllow, you spoke those words
[1:33:00] and you spoke eternal words. Those were
[1:33:04] eternal words. And when you spoke those
[1:33:06] words, those words had power,
[1:33:13] Brother Glenn. It would affect your
[1:33:15] life.
[1:33:17] It would affect your life in a traumatic
[1:33:21] way,
[1:33:22] an incredible way,
[1:33:24] a very creative way,
[1:33:27] because you wanted a a Joel that had a
[1:33:30] new birth.
[1:33:33] Yes, sir.
[1:33:35] You wanted a Joel that was serving God.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; You wanted a Joel that would dedicate
[1:33:42] his life and his job and his gift to
[1:33:45] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And I would say one night,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; now let me just say
[1:33:56] all of his life was pressing toward that
[1:33:59] night. Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Every service that he was in was
[1:34:04] pressing toward that night. And that
[1:34:06] night, he recognized
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; the voice behind the voice that had came
[1:34:12] on the scene to bring a gathering for
[1:34:14] him.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And it changed their lives.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a great big hand.
[1:34:20] [applause]
[1:34:29] 10 years. [applause]
[1:34:36] Michael Andes,
[1:34:39] where you at?
[1:34:42] Stand on a chair.
[1:34:53] End that meeting.
[1:34:59] He would get called out
[1:35:03] and we would be amused at it. Maybe we
[1:35:06] could show that one evening. He'd people
[1:35:09] would be amused at myself bringing
[1:35:12] Brother Michael up. He's a little bitty
[1:35:14] boy.
[1:35:16] And I would begin to talk about this is
[1:35:18] what Satan hates.
[1:35:23] God can take this little bitty guy and
[1:35:26] shake the world with it.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; How important is this camp?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; How important is this camp, Silas?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; How important is it?
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you it was very important for
[1:35:46] you.
[1:35:50] No doubt in another round they were
[1:35:51] chuckling, but God knew what he was
[1:35:53] doing.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was doing. And he was
[1:36:00] anchoring something in your life.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And he began to talk about dynamite
[1:36:06] coming in small packages. I'll tell you,
[1:36:08] when it does, [screaming]
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; it's life.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; And that life begins to speak to other
[1:36:20] seeds and scream out.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Who did it affect? We could we could
[1:36:28] have his whole family to stand tonight
[1:36:30] and say it has affected us all. We could
[1:36:32] have the whole church to stand tonight
[1:36:34] and say it has affected us all.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Brother John, it's affected your life.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, it's been made a team
[1:36:43] player.
[1:36:47] It's affected your business. It's
[1:36:49] affected your your education. It's
[1:36:51] affected everything in your life.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So, we watched him preach the other day
[1:36:55] and using a a bullhorn. Boy, sometimes
[1:36:58] I'd like to have one of them. And
[1:37:02] he set a pan on fire.
[1:37:06] Nobody' ever let me do that.
[1:37:15] But what was he doing? Expressing life.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; This is more than just a coalition of
[1:37:28] quotes.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; This is more than just a good recipe.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; This is life.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] I brought my family.
[1:37:45] I spoke this meeting in a weakened
[1:37:47] condition.
[1:37:50] But I brought my family
[1:37:56] and she would sit.
[1:37:59] Sister Katie and brother Andrew would
[1:38:01] sit in that tent about where you are,
[1:38:05] Sister Lelay,
[1:38:08] Brother John.
[1:38:11] And they would sit back there.
[1:38:15] And Andrew was a good boy.
[1:38:20] He believed the message,
[1:38:23] but he didn't have a life.
[1:38:27] Did you catch what I just said right
[1:38:29] there?
[1:38:31] He was a good boy.
[1:38:34] He believed the message,
[1:38:36] but he didn't have a life.
[1:38:40] I knew that.
[1:38:43] I understood that.
[1:38:47] But brother Tom, I had a covenant.
[1:38:52] Sister Joanne, I understood what you
[1:38:56] and I was screaming to God,
[1:38:59] God help my children.
[1:39:02] [snorts]
[1:39:04] You'll hear brother Andrew speak in the
[1:39:06] morning.
[1:39:10] He's more than just a reproduction of
[1:39:12] myself.
[1:39:15] God knows you wouldn't want to copy me
[1:39:17] to start off with,
[1:39:21] but Sister Katie sat about where you are
[1:39:24] and during the meeting, she would just
[1:39:26] scream.
[1:39:30] 10 years later, she screamed only one
[1:39:32] other time in a meeting like that.
[1:39:36] And it was just a few weeks ago and I
[1:39:38] heard her just blowing in the presence
[1:39:40] of God. She was just screaming with all
[1:39:42] of her might
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; and I thought I heard that scream a few
[1:39:46] years ago
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; and she was sitting in that meeting and
[1:39:50] she was just screaming out to God in the
[1:39:53] presence of the Lord.
[1:39:57] That week,
[1:40:00] Brother Andrew
[1:40:03] would be standing in the street with
[1:40:05] Brother Tom Ray
[1:40:07] and he would turn in desperation.
[1:40:10] He needed to know the God of this
[1:40:13] message.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; He needed to know the voice. And
[1:40:19] [screaming] in that moment,
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; somehow
[1:40:25] I tell him, "We've got a covenant."
[1:40:27] Somehow he grabbed a hold of the
[1:40:29] covenant
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; and he held on.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; One Andrew walked up to brother Tom.
[1:40:38] Another Andrew walked away.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Who did it affect? His family.
[1:40:48] his [screaming] wife, his children, his
[1:40:50] parents, our church.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Thousands have heard him preach. Now, I
[1:40:56] tell you, one seed,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; that's the seventh seal. One seed coming
[1:41:05] to life is like a rocket going off.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Your life affects
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; many others.
[1:41:22] To God be the glory.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; No more conference sessions. No more no
[1:41:30] more trying to listen. It was just
[1:41:32] settled.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm struggling with this
[1:41:35] and struggling with that and I'm
[1:41:36] struggling with this and I'm struggling
[1:41:37] with that. You get into his presence one
[1:41:40] time. It'll settle that.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; It'll just settle that.
[1:41:44] You won't have to worry about the music
[1:41:45] no more,
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; the video games anymore,
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; the all the kind of nonsense anymore.
[1:41:51] It'll just evaporate
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; in a moment's notice. It'll evaporate
[1:41:55] out of your life.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It'll be more than just a service. It'll
[1:41:58] be more than just coming and and setting
[1:42:00] and a movement of it. All of a sudden,
[1:42:02] you'll be pulling on the life.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more story?
[1:42:15] I was in China with brother Murphy Wong
[1:42:19] and brother Tom Ray, brother Glenn
[1:42:22] Gruner.
[1:42:26] And we had we had meetings that we will
[1:42:28] that will
[1:42:30] you'll never reduplicate them,
[1:42:33] remanufacture them. It was just
[1:42:35] sovereign meetings.
[1:42:37] We witness
[1:42:40] phenomenal incredible book of acts among
[1:42:44] us.
[1:42:47] I come to the end of my my journey and
[1:42:51] as it would be
[1:42:54] brother Jason
[1:42:58] would be flying home at the same time.
[1:43:07] And so we go we go through the ticket
[1:43:10] situation
[1:43:13] at the same time. His mother and
[1:43:15] father's with him and brother Tom's with
[1:43:18] me and brother Murphy with Glenn.
[1:43:22] They're staying behind and and I'm going
[1:43:24] through and I'm a very anxious traveler.
[1:43:29] I I I'm not I come off of a farm. I I
[1:43:34] flying is just not in my my deal.
[1:43:38] And so here I am with this
[1:43:42] 20 year old boy. You 20 yet? Yeah.
[1:43:48] And he's with me. And he doesn't realize
[1:43:52] how precious he is to me right now.
[1:43:56] He's he's crutching my nervousness.
[1:44:01] And we go through customs together.
[1:44:04] and we go we go into the gate area
[1:44:07] together
[1:44:09] and I want to
[1:44:11] I don't know I've ate a lot of things in
[1:44:13] China and I'd like something that's
[1:44:15] familiar to me and I got a whopper.
[1:44:23] [snorts]
[1:44:25] I felt like I got cheated cuz it was
[1:44:27] about that big.
[1:44:36] And we walked out to the area. He I I
[1:44:39] think you just got a drink maybe. And
[1:44:43] walked out to the area and we sat down
[1:44:45] and we sat there and we didn't talk
[1:44:48] about the weather.
[1:44:51] There was people sitting all around us.
[1:44:55] You know, it's a busy airport. They're
[1:44:57] sitting all around. And there's a man
[1:44:59] man sitting as close to me to brother
[1:45:01] Tom right behind brother Jason and I
[1:45:05] asked him I said tell me your story
[1:45:13] and he began to talk about coming
[1:45:17] and and actually finding they
[1:45:21] brought him to this school because of
[1:45:23] this school
[1:45:26] and he began to talk about coming to the
[1:45:28] school and living in the home and
[1:45:32] talking about trying to dress and do
[1:45:35] right and behave himself. And
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; he begin to come to church and and one
[1:45:43] day
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; one day it came to life
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; and one day something be to respond to
[1:45:53] him and this message became a reality to
[1:45:56] him.
[1:45:58] Hallelujah.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Is it okay if I just share these words?
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And brother Jason was standing there and
[1:46:05] he said, I begin to think about the
[1:46:07] other guys around me. He said,
[1:46:09] I'm getting it now. Why aren't you
[1:46:11] getting it?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And he be to he be to share these words.
[1:46:18] He says, "It become alive to me." And I
[1:46:22] thought everybody else ought to receive
[1:46:24] the same experience that I received. And
[1:46:28] he began to talk about how school
[1:46:29] became, how church became, and how the
[1:46:32] message became and and how that he
[1:46:34] wanted to do something. Now
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I started, now I'm ending with this. God
[1:46:43] speaks to him and he believes it and
[1:46:47] then he responds, "Here am I. Send me."
[1:46:51] Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And I was sitting on this side of him
[1:46:57] and there's a man sitting on the other
[1:46:59] side and tears are running down his face
[1:47:02] and you don't know it till this very
[1:47:04] moment that you was affecting somebody
[1:47:07] even in the airport that you didn't even
[1:47:09] know.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, will you stand?
[1:47:14] Hallelujah.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; To God
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; be the glory. [applause]
[1:47:31] [applause]
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. How many people will he
[1:47:36] affect? Only eternity.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; How many will you affect?
[1:47:46] What about your home?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; What about what you left?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You're from France.
[1:48:00] God sent you as a representative from
[1:48:02] France.
[1:48:04] You're from Belgium.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; He sent you as a representative from
[1:48:08] Belgium.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; We've got many countries represented
[1:48:12] sitting in this building. We've even got
[1:48:14] Louisiana sitting in this building.
[1:48:16] We've got Edmonton sitting in this
[1:48:18] building.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; God knows exactly where you're from.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; And he gathered you from all ends of the
[1:48:24] earth for this place.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; From Grand Prairie.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Even being a minister,
[1:48:30] brother Steven. But I believe God can
[1:48:32] ignite you like never before.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Honor had an experience
[1:48:37] but many refillings of the spirit of
[1:48:40] God. May the revival fires be like never
[1:48:44] before,
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; more than emotion,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; more than a sensation, [cheering]
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; but may God speak to our hearts.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; That moment.
[1:49:07] In that moment,
[1:49:09] Brother Calvin, a few years ago, you and
[1:49:12] I had a moment. And you know, and we
[1:49:16] don't have to say no more. We had a
[1:49:18] moment,
[1:49:23] changed your life.
[1:49:26] How long does it take?
[1:49:29] Tell you how long it took for me.
[1:49:30] Seconds.
[1:49:34] Seconds.
[1:49:36] Just seconds.
[1:49:42] Seconds.
[1:49:47] It changes our life forever.
[1:49:53] Absolutely forever.
[1:50:00] Isaiah,
[1:50:02] Jacob,
[1:50:04] Ruth,
[1:50:06] Abraham,
[1:50:11] William Brandham in a cave.
[1:50:17] He shares his life with us
[1:50:21] and then begins to tell us that he'll
[1:50:24] come to you.
[1:50:26] He'll come to where you are.
[1:50:30] He chose this place.
[1:50:33] Mark this place.
[1:50:36] Mark this night.
[1:50:40] Mark it. You got counselors to support
[1:50:43] you.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; You got ministry to support you.
[1:50:48] But this is more than a social
[1:50:49] gathering.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Many of you have peer pressure that
[1:50:56] you're struggling with.
[1:50:58] Many of you got pressures that you don't
[1:51:01] even want to tell your mother and father
[1:51:02] about. You close the world in. And
[1:51:06] sometimes it's like a cage. It's like a
[1:51:08] trap. It's like a chains.
[1:51:11] Weaknesses that you struggle with in
[1:51:13] your mind. And there's things that you
[1:51:15] struggle with that only you know about.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Could it be tonight that you could say,
[1:51:24] "I don't want to stay this way.
[1:51:30] I don't want to stay this way, brother.
[1:51:33] Do I have to live the rest of my life
[1:51:36] [snorts]
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; in just a churchgoing condition and
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; just a condition of just hiding things
[1:51:43] from others.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; My choices are taking me down wrong
[1:51:49] roads.
[1:51:53] I'm telling you, in just a moment
[1:51:55] tonight,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; in just a moment,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; oh, brother Ron, I think I'll make a
[1:52:03] decision. God's already began your
[1:52:06] decision process
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; way before you ever packed your clothes.
[1:52:14] [applause and cheering]
[1:52:23] He's gathering his seed. He's got
[1:52:26] eternal purposes here.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; More than counting chairs and more than
[1:52:30] counting people. He's after you.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; You don't need a man to tell you who you
[1:52:42] are. You know,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; you don't need a man to tell you your
[1:52:46] weaknesses. You already know.
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; And the key is God already knows.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Could we bow our head just a moment?
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; We talk about chains. We talk about
[1:53:14] prison walls. We talk about darkness
[1:53:17] of choices.
[1:53:19] We talk about just being lonely,
[1:53:25] going through the motions.
[1:53:30] Maybe you'd like to say, "I just need a
[1:53:32] touch from God. Brother Ron, I just need
[1:53:35] to give my life to him like never
[1:53:36] before.
[1:53:39] I'd like to raise my hand to him.
[1:53:42] Yes.
[1:53:44] Yes.
[1:53:46] Yes.
[1:53:48] Yes.
[1:53:51] Brother, I'm just exhausted putting up
[1:53:53] with myself. I want to just give myself
[1:53:56] away to him tonight.
[1:53:58] I just want to just give myself to him.
[1:54:01] I I I I I don't want to wait till
[1:54:04] another meeting. I I I I just I'm just
[1:54:06] exhausted with with the things in my
[1:54:09] life. I just got to have a I got to have
[1:54:11] a change. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:54:17] Thank you.
[1:54:22] I'd like to just invite you to this
[1:54:24] altar now.
[1:54:26] You've raised your hands.
[1:54:37] One seed, the value,
[1:54:41] who will it affect,
[1:54:45] Jessica? Who will it affect?
[1:54:55] Who will it affect?
[1:55:02] Oh God.
[1:55:05] Oh God.
[1:55:08] Hallelujah.
[1:55:11] Let's talk to him now.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I want you to talk to him with your lips
[1:55:17] and your heart.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've done this before, but
[1:55:22] tonight,
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; may it be different than ever before.
[1:55:29] Won't you just lay it all out just
[1:55:31] tonight?
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Lay it out just now.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Lay it out just where you're at just
[1:55:41] now.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I invite you to where I'm at
[1:55:47] now.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Eternal God, I bow my head before you
[1:55:51] now.
[1:56:00] Jesus.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, you've came wave after wave already
[1:56:04] in this meeting.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; It's been like a mighty wave as you
[1:56:10] you've moved even in this service now.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; These are your children,
[1:56:19] Satan. You can't have them.
[1:56:24] We make a claim tonight. In the name of
[1:56:26] Jesus Christ,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; the name of Jesus Christ, we rebuke
[1:56:33] every demon of hell,
[1:56:36] every tormenting enemy,
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Satan tries to destroy our lives, but
[1:56:42] we're here to destroy his purpose
[1:56:45] tonight.
[1:56:50] We rebuke the enemy.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; We rebuke the shadows of darkness right
[1:56:55] now
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:57:00] May every chain be loose right now. May
[1:57:03] there be a sounding of jubilee happen
[1:57:06] among us. We're not a slave to that
[1:57:09] thing any longer.
[1:57:11] Oh dear God, we renounce those things in
[1:57:16] the name of Jesus Christ and we give our
[1:57:19] life to you, Father.
[1:57:22] We give oursel to you, Lord God.
[1:57:26] Now we ask you that you'd fill every
[1:57:28] fiber of our being.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; May you sanctify our lives and cleanse
[1:57:34] us, Father, by the blood of Jesus
[1:57:37] Christ. May that blood wash us. Wash the
[1:57:41] desires, wash the affections, wash our
[1:57:45] memory, wash our thought process, wash
[1:57:49] our mind,
[1:57:51] wash our hearts. May the blood of Jesus
[1:57:54] Christ begin to create in us a new
[1:57:57] heart, a new life. Oh God, may it change
[1:58:02] our ambition, change our purpose.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:58:11] God.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; Oh God,

[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; And we call to the house of hell. Give
[1:58:19] way in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're defeated.
[1:58:29] You're defeated. You're nothing but a
[1:58:32] bluff.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:36] in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, may the search light of the word
[1:58:41] of God go through our hearts right now.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; On this first night,
[1:58:49] it's been you that's pulled to us. We
[1:58:52] stand like Isaiah
[1:58:54] and in the presence of God,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; this holy presence tonight,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; we recognize
[1:59:02] our humanity.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, God.
[1:59:05] May you take the tongue, the call from
[1:59:08] off of the altar, lay it on our lips,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; and we respond. Here am I, Lord.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; I mark this place tonight.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; I mark this place. This is more than a
[1:59:26] tent. It's more than a camp. This is a
[1:59:29] conference with God. I mark this place
[1:59:33] now.
[1:59:34] Oh God, my life will never be the same.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Joel's life's never been the same.
[1:59:43] Michael's life's never been the same.
[1:59:46] Andrew's life has never been the same.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; You're the same God tonight.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; You're the same God
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; from young people in Belgium and young
[1:59:58] people from Switzerland and Lord God
[2:00:00] from China. Lord God, you see your
[2:00:03] children. You know where they're from.
[2:00:06] You call this meeting.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; You place this on my heart because you
[2:00:13] had a work to do.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, at the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; I pray
[2:00:22] we give ourselves to you just now.
[2:00:27] We give oursel to you just now.

[2:00:35] come. Let's just talk to him now.
[2:00:39] Could you just talk to him now?
[2:00:44] Could you just talk to him?
[2:00:46] Won't you reach out?
[2:00:50] Won't you reach out where you're at?

[2:01:11] This your night, too.
[2:01:18] This is your night, too.
[2:01:23] How long has it been since you had a
[2:01:25] real revival stir in your heart?
[2:01:29] Would you say, "I want to just fall in
[2:01:31] love with him like never before. I just
[2:01:34] want to fall in love with him."
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Like never before. I want to fall in
[2:01:40] love with the living God. I want this to
[2:01:43] be a passion in my heart.
[2:01:46] I want it to be a passion in my heart.
[2:01:49] Hallelujah.
[2:01:51] God sees your tears.
[2:01:54] He knows your condition. He knows your
[2:01:56] situation tonight. [music]
[2:01:59] He knows the people that you will
[2:02:01] personally affect in your lives.

[2:29:00] [music]
[2:29:06] [music]
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit has done something very
[2:29:13] supernatural this evening. Very
[2:29:15] supernatural.
[2:29:20] You say, "Well, brother Tom, normally uh
[2:29:23] maybe get up and it's maybe a little bit
[2:29:26] enthusiasm. I want to punch something
[2:29:28] home."
[2:29:30] You know what? I live for moments like
[2:29:35] this.
[2:29:37] I live for the presence of God.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; That's what I live for, [music] saints.
[2:29:44] I don't want to interrupt him if he's
[2:29:46] doing something.
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; I thought, well, I'll just step through
[2:29:51] the pulpit. Brother Ryan is
[2:29:54] he's doing a wonderful job song leading,
[2:29:57] but I know I step the pulpit then I got
[2:29:59] to close. I didn't want to close
[2:30:04] because I know what God does in a
[2:30:06] moment.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I know.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:11] I know it
[2:30:13] because I heard it this evening and I
[2:30:16] can testify [music]
[2:30:17] of it.
[2:30:19] It's not something that's mental. It's
[2:30:22] something that's real. Hallelujah.
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; And they forgot. Brother Ron, I'm sure
[2:30:27] he could have gone on and on
[2:30:32] 10 [music] years ago,
[2:30:34] but there's a young man that's kneeling
[2:30:36] right here,
[2:30:39] praying for [music]
[2:30:42] a brother right here. 10 years ago, he
[2:30:45] was so cool.
[2:30:48] He had a jean jacket on with a fur liner
[2:30:50] at a 100 degree weather.
[2:30:54] Now that's cool.
[2:30:59] And brother Ron was just ending the
[2:31:00] service and he said, "I'm just out of
[2:31:04] here."
[2:31:05] And he got up out of his seat right over
[2:31:07] here [music]
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; and he started to walk to the back of
[2:31:10] the gate.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; Something stopped him
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; where Michael is.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Something stopped him. And now he's
[2:31:19] right here. [music]
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; 10 years Hallelujah.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Because of that one decision.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; One decision. He's got a wife. He's
[2:31:29] here. He's works in the office. He loves
[2:31:32] the Lord. He takes prayer meetings.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; In a moment.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; It's not history. It's not 30 years ago.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; It's right here, right now, young
[2:31:45] people.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; So, you say, "Well, brother Tom, I had
[2:31:48] maybe a little bit of a emotional." It's
[2:31:50] beyond the emotion. [music]
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; It's it's to the resolve. I am resolved
[2:31:57] never to be that person [music] again.
[2:32:00] Not a camp meeting experience to another
[2:32:03] camp meeting experience. I heard of a
[2:32:06] little blind girl that went determined
[2:32:09] not to go home blind.
[2:32:12] That That's my kind of meeting.
[2:32:16] I see young people and I pray God may
[2:32:20] they come to this camp [music]
[2:32:22] determined not to go back the same
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; resolved
[2:32:28] that the Holy Spirit the [music] first
[2:32:30] night can deal not that we just shout
[2:32:34] and sing and and and and have clap our
[2:32:37] hands but it's something that's happened
[2:32:38] in your heart
[2:32:41] and once that's happened I can tell you
[2:32:44] as a 21-year-old man now 64. [music]
[2:32:49] It's never grown old.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; I only want more of Jesus.
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; I only want more of God.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; And so something happened tonight in
[2:32:59] your own life. You mark [music] that
[2:33:01] spot.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Mark that spot where you were. Say, "I
[2:33:05] will never ever be the same again."
[2:33:07] Brother [music] Tom, let's bow our heads
[2:33:10] in a word of prayer.
[2:33:14] songwriter penned I want more of Jesus
[2:33:19] more and more and more.
[2:33:23] They might have penned that many years
[2:33:25] ago, but Lord, that's rung in my soul
[2:33:28] for years.
[2:33:32] I want more
[2:33:34] of Jesus.
[2:33:36] I want more of your word. I want more of
[2:33:39] you for you [music] are your word.
[2:33:42] What what a what a wonderful time, Lord,
[2:33:46] we've had this evening basking in
[2:33:48] [music] the presence of God, seeing
[2:33:50] young people being affected by the word.
[2:33:55] Would you continue [music]
[2:33:57] to move in their lives
[2:34:00] deeper, deeper
[2:34:02] in the love of Jesus?
[2:34:07] Father, I'm just praying God, as you
[2:34:09] have done, as many testimonies have been
[2:34:11] said tonight,
[2:34:13] still here tonight, 10 years, it still
[2:34:15] holds.
[2:34:17] They made a decision and in that
[2:34:19] decision, God, you've continued to
[2:34:21] [music] use it. May the decisions that
[2:34:23] are made tonight be eternal.
[2:34:27] And may Lord these young people leave
[2:34:29] tonight [music] with a deep resolve,
[2:34:36] a deep resolve for their love
[2:34:39] of Jesus Christ. [music]
[2:34:41] Bless your people as they'll go their
[2:34:44] way. Many will go on the road tonight.
[2:34:47] Lord, speaking of this meeting,
[2:34:50] may the angel of God come into their
[2:34:53] little vehicle. When they go to their
[2:34:55] cabins, Lord, wherever they will be
[2:34:57] sleeping, may the presence of God just
[2:35:00] wave after wave
[2:35:03] minister to their souls.
[2:35:06] Father, an unusual beginning.
[2:35:10] May you take us higher
[2:35:12] into that heavenly places where we have
[2:35:15] not experienced.
[2:35:18] Lord, I've had the pleasure and
[2:35:22] privilege
[2:35:24] to go certain heights
[2:35:27] in the lovely presence of Jesus, but I
[2:35:29] want to come higher, Lord,
[2:35:34] beyond what I've even thought of.
[2:35:37] to be lost in God,
[2:35:41] to be lost in the glory of your
[2:35:43] presence, worshiping you, [music]
[2:35:46] loving you. So would you bless each one
[2:35:49] of these young people tonight as they go
[2:35:51] to their cabins? [music]
[2:35:53] May it be an unusual evening for them.
[2:35:58] And God, may you come near them.
[2:36:02] Would you watch over all that will be
[2:36:04] leaving and making their way off of the
[2:36:06] camp?
[2:36:08] And Lord, if we have a tomorrow, may God
[2:36:11] your glory come down. And brother Andrew
[2:36:14] Spencer will be speaking in the morning.
[2:36:16] May our hearts be charged [music]
[2:36:20] with great expectation to hear what
[2:36:23] you've laid on his heart.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Bless us now as we go our separate way.
[2:36:28] We're thankful for all that have made
[2:36:30] this
[2:36:32] meeting tonight, coming from so many
[2:36:35] different places. [music] We feel
[2:36:38] humbled
[2:36:40] and privileged that they would come and
[2:36:43] be with us at this camp. So go with
[2:36:45] [music] us now, Lord. We ask it in Jesus
[2:36:49] name.
[2:36:50] Amen.

[2:37:02] as you make your way quietly, I'm sure
[2:37:04] off the campgrounds, be careful.
[2:37:07] And cabins, if you wish to leave with
[2:37:10] your cabin, go. Your counselor,
