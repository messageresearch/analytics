[0:00] I say this with all my heart that if any
[0:03] persons will take the right mental
[0:06] attitude towards any Divine promise that
[0:08] God has made it'll bring it to pass if
[0:11] you could take the right attitude
[0:14] towards what he said it'll bring it to
[0:16] pass I've seen sarcom cancer lead people
[0:20] by that same thing now maybe you won't
[0:23] be able to receive enough for just to
[0:25] deliver you all of a sudden but I might
[0:28] say tonight this closing I want to talk
[0:30] to you a moment and say this if you
[0:33] can't receive enough Faith to be healed
[0:36] instantly then you take the adopted baby
[0:39] route did you ever hear of adopting a
[0:42] baby now if you take a young woman
[0:45] she'll maybe be married and and she and
[0:47] her husband and she's scared she isn't
[0:50] going to have a baby she wants one and
[0:52] she's so scared she won't have it she
[0:55] won't because just like job said the
[0:57] things that I feared the most come up
[1:00] call me but you take that same woman now
[1:03] there doctors which probably is sitting
[1:05] by nurses you take that same woman and
[1:08] let her adopt a baby then she'll have
[1:11] one herself see it quietens her now if
[1:14] you haven't got enough Faith to receive
[1:17] it right now as a miracle then take the
[1:20] adopted baby attitude Lord is mine
[1:23] because you promis that I'll go from
[1:25] here tonight praising you just the same
[1:27] as I was well watch what happen
[1:30] you'll receive it it has to happen God
[1:33] promised it so he's the infinite God and
[1:37] if you can feel just the least little
[1:39] speck of faith that tells you that
[1:41] you'll be all right you believe it just
[1:44] go on thanking him part
