His father's in the hospital recovering from pneumonia and he needs a healing touch from the Lord. Just want to lift up our brother pal. And also a prayer request from our sister Elena Hendrickson. Please remember my boss's daughter Anna who has had chronic pain resulting from an operation over one and a half years ago was at a hip surgery that didn't go well. And we're just praying that this will be a way to speak further about the message. As Sena's boss is very open and receptive and Elena was just sharing a bit with me and it's amazing.

Anything that's on your heart that you just like to lift before the Lord with an uplifted hand and dad, would you come? Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's just pray together. Heavenly Father, how thankful we are, Lord, to have the desire in our heart, Lord, to assemble ourselves together, Lord. And how thankful we are to have a desire in our heart, Father, to be found in this hour, seeking you, Lord, seeking the oneness, Father God, that is our greatest heart's desire, Lord. and how thankful we are, Lord, that you are able to fulfill those promises that you have given to us, Lord. And we have confidence, dear God, that you're able to finish the work and perfect the work that you began in each of us here, Lord. And we don't count it robbery, Lord, to be one with you, Lord. It's according to your word, Father. And you've declared, and it's your very victory, Father. And how grateful we are, Lord Jesus, for it to acknowledge this truth and to be found in this hour with that desire in our heart, Lord. How we can have confidence, Father, to bring these petitions before you, Lord, because you said you supply all our needs in Christ Jesus. Lord, you promise that, Father. Everything we need to know to be enter into that oneness, Lord. Enter into that perfect love with you, Father. You provide for us. And how thankful we are that you're mindful of our needs, Lord. these requests that have been brought before, Lord, the confidence that they have in the body to present them, Lord, before you. And we just want to pray for these requests, Lord, that you meet these needs. You go to the specific situation, Lord God, and address them for your children that have brought them before you. How thankful we are, how you love us, Lord, and how you're mindful of us, Lord, and your your heart towards us, oh God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just going to continue right on in this atmosphere. Maybe just before you have your seats, why don't we sing? We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord, right now. And if Elizabeth and Brianna could come and just get ready. We have one special this morning. Want to remember communion this evening at 4:00. Let's continue to prepare our hearts throughout the day for the Lord's supper this evening. Just looking forward to a wonderful time. There's many visiting with us. Just trust that you would all be welcome. We're thankful to have each and every one of you with us. Amen. So, just as we before we have this special, why don't we sing, we need you, Lord.

[Music] We pray for peace. peace, comfort for family protection while we sleep. We pray for healing, for prosperity. [Music] We pray for your mighty hand to ease our suffering. [Music] All the while you hear each spoken need, yet love us way too much to give us lesser things. What if your blessings come through raindrops? What if your healing comes through tears? What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near? [Music] What if trials of this life are your mercies in disguise? We pray for wisdom, your voice to hear. We cry in anger when we cannot feel you near. We doubt your goodness. [Music] We doubt your love. [Music] as if every promise from your word is not enough. &gt;&gt; And all the while you hear each desperate clear, &gt;&gt; yet long we have faith to believe. Cuz what if your blessings come through raindrops? What if your healing comes through tears? What if a thousand sleepless nights are what it takes to know you're near? &gt;&gt; And what if trials of this life are your mercies in disguise? [Music] When friends betray us, [Music] when darkness seems to win, we know the pain reminds this heart that this is not this is not our home. [Music] It's not our home. Oh, [Music] cuz what if your blessings come through raindrops? What if your healing comes through tears? What if a thousand sleepless nights? Or what it takes to know you're near? What if my greatest disappointment or the achings of this life is the revealing of a gater thirst can satisfy? What if trials of this life, the rain, the storms, the hardest nights, are your mercies in disguise? [Music] [Applause] greetings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that a good day? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's nice to see you all and some that are visiting. Brother Larry and Sister Darlene. Forgive me. I said Donna the other night. I'm sorry. God bless you. Nice to have you here. Daughter Sarah. Amen. And today is uh this evening is communion, the Lord's supper, foot washing. What a wonderful time. &gt;&gt; It's never been a disappointment. &gt;&gt; It's always a blessed time. &gt;&gt; And we're happy to have uh also our friends from Israel with us and uh all of you that have come up from Seattle, Tacoma to be with us. God bless you. We're so happy that you're here. Very happy. Always feels more like home. Amen. Uh well, I trust you're rejoicing &gt;&gt; tomorrow. I understand I just got an email that tomorrow we're going to be receiving the first uh young sister, a student from China for the school. She arrives tomorrow. So, I think quite a few of you perhaps got the got the email because she just is able to get on the aircraft with the things that she could carry and apparently be needing some things. So, Sister Shelley and Brother Terry were letting us know a little bit about that and we want to do all we can for for them. Incidentally, we got a lovely email from a pastor in Malawi and apparently they, you know, they've been pretty close contact. I don't I haven't met him, I don't think, unless maybe when he was a young man some years ago, but they have been following what has been taking place uh here at the church and with the school and it's exactly the same thing over there as it is here. He said it's just impossible to be able to put the children in the school system the way it is now. &gt;&gt; And he said we have been inspired by what we have seen and we are going to follow your example and we are going to put up a structure and a building for our children and they're just determined to keep them as protected as possible. And you know it's really wonderful. It's really wonderful when you It gives me a lot of joy to be able to say to Satan, you don't have them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad today that we can say to the denominational system, you don't have them. &gt;&gt; We have them. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ has them. Wonderful. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to also remind you once again that Brother Timuit will be here Saturday night, October 1st, and two services on Sunday, October the 2nd. So, that's coming up quite quickly. And we are uh really looking forward to having brother Tim and his family. I believe his family will other members will be here also because they'll be here for brother James and Sister Kathy Waldner's wedding. Brother James Morgan and Sister Kathy getting married on Friday the 30th and uh that is out at the camp. It's going to be uh uh I is that about the second one we've had out there? Is it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These are special times. Whoever thought, Sister Kathy, you're going to get married out of the camp. Amen. So, that's wonderful. Be be really in earnest prayer for these. I I don't have time this morning. Uh we got a a long email report from brother Jonathan Larga who he and brother Alladen, brother Draamir and I think another brother, four of them went into uh Macedonia again and it is unbelievable. They just went from one brother to another to this pastor to another pastor to these people and where they had left message books before and they have had them and several people are uh are excellent translators and they have read the church age book and they're interested in translating and I just I just couldn't hardly believe what those four men did. And it all started they decided they were going to use Facebook. The devil uses Facebook, we'll use Facebook. So they went on, all these people started responding uh responding to them for message books and for uh different material. And so they went down there and loaded them up and then they went down now with another load. And it was marvelous, brother Mil. I'm sure you're rejoicing over that. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I thought I'd like to just sing I just want to thank thee, Lord, for letting me hear your word. And then, Brother Mike Gier, I know we've had prayer. I'm going to ask you to come and pray uh before I read the scripture. If you do that, please. Let's stand as we sing. Just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. What have I done? Glory. [Music] I just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word. Oh, what have I done to deserve such glory reveal? Thanks for that special. Then I saw you glorious face to face with eternal life for I. &gt;&gt; Not even in my wildest dreams did I think I see such thing as the coming of the Lord. The rapture mystery. I have heard, but now I see. God is in my spoken word is the original seed. Oh Lord, I thank thee. Just want to bless your holy name. Oh God, we thank you Lord for letting us hear your glorious word. Oh God, surely what have we done to deserve such glory. Glory that was before the foundation of the world. Glory that was in you, Lord God. We're so thankful to be found in Christ Jesus. Truly, this world is not our home. Oh God, we're thankful that we're just passing through, Lord God, that there's a place waiting for us, Lord Jesus. Lord, we have tasted of the heavenly things, Lord. And we long not only for a temporary presence, a seating in heavenly places with you, Lord, but to eternally dwell with you there, Lord, where we were in you before the foundation of the world. Oh God, we thank you, heavenly father, Lord, that you've allowed us, Lord, to recognize our place, recognize this day in our message. Oh God, Lord, the revealing of Christ, Christ, the mystery of God revealed in us. &gt;&gt; What an amazing thing that we can declare with our whole heart, &gt;&gt; oh God, that we've never done it in the first place. What an amazing thing, Lord God. We look at the rich that we are, Lord. Oh Lord, you are so good, Lord Jesus. To believe all that the Father has done for us, oh God. Oh Lord, we claim our loved ones, Lord Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus, all the Father has given will come. None shall pluck them from your hands, Lord God. Lord, as we gather this morning, oh God, just to to worship you, Lord. And we're laying ourselves before you, thinking of those that once worshiped with us, Lord, and had foot washing. And oh Lord, we see them driving in opposite directions. Lord, we're all going to the same heaven. We all worship the same God, Lord. They're on our hearts. We are one. Father, we just remember them, oh God. And pray, Lord, you just draw us ever closer to you. &gt;&gt; Draw us closer to each other, Lord. Break down the barriers, the walls, the petitions. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we love you, Father. We thank you, Father, for opportunity to worship you. Lord, it did my heart good to worship you, Lord. How I need to worship and so hard it is sometimes, Lord, to open our mouths and praise you, Lord. Truly, it is the sacrifice of praise. Oh God, &gt;&gt; bless us now, Lord, as we drink in not only from your word, but from your spirit. Bless our pastor, Father. bless our hearts to do what you say, things that the spirit would say unto us this day. I thank you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And I just want to thank you for letting me hear your word. [Music] I love to such glory revealing. &gt;&gt; Lift it up now again. Thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious came face to face with eternal life. Lord, I thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; I believe this the atmosphere God wants us to turn to the word. Actually, I woke up in the middle of the night two nights ago. God spoke to me and said, "Have brother D have brother G pray before you read the scripture." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why we did it. It's nice to obey the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Isn't the atmosphere nice? &gt;&gt; Are you ready to receive the word? &gt;&gt; I'd like to have just little as movement as possible and just every bit every person's mind and thoughts on the word. But we're going to read out of the scripture out of First Kings uh the 19th chapter. We'll read verses verses 1 to four and then I want to read skip down to eight down to 18 and then we're going to read three verses four verses three four five verses out of Romans the 11th chapter and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and with all how he had slain all the prophets with the sword Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. And when he saw that, he arose and went for his life, and came to Beersa, which belongth to Judah, and left his servant there. And he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree. And he requested for himself that he might die and said, "It is enough now, oh Lord, take away my life, for I am not better than my fathers." Then the eighth verse. And he rose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the mount of God. And he came thither into a unto a cave and lodged there. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him and said unto him, What do thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I only am left, and they seek my life to take it away." And he said, "Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great strong wind the mountains, and beh and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, a still small voice. And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him and said, What do thou hear, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword. And I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it away. Yet I have left 7,000 is in Israel all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul is referring to this in Romans 11. He's referring to the same instance. And starting at verse one, I'm just reading five verses. I say then hath God cast away his people, speaking of Israel. God forbid. For I also am an Israelite of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. What know ye not? What know ye not what the scripture saith of Elias or Elijah? How he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and dig down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they seek my life. But what saith the answer of God unto him? I want you to notice that Paul calls it, "What saith the answer of God unto him?" I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee knee to the image of Baal. Even so, then at this present time also, there is a remnant according to the election of grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. I want to want to direct your thoughts and I would like you to really absorb if you would please the principle of the scripture to your own individual life. I feel very very impressed and directed with the word today. Not that we don't always but not sometimes just a little different. I want to speak to you on what saith the answer of God and also like two titles. What doest thou hear? In that time it was Elijah but this time it's us. What doest thou hear? The older testament the old testament account describes it in one way. The Apostle Paul describes it in another. What saith the answer of God? Actually, excuse me. Elijah didn't ask any question. Didn't Elijah didn't ask a question of God. He just told God of the circumstances. This is the situation. This is the way things are. The Israel's backsliden. uh people that believe the message are gone uh this way. It's cooled off and they've digged down the altars and they've cast them down and they've gone after different gods and and and and the circumstances and uh and now they seek my life also and my message is rejected. And that was the situation. &gt;&gt; And so he he didn't ask God a question at all. But God said to him, "I have reserved 7,000 &gt;&gt; to myself which have not bowed the knee and has not kissed Baal." &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul calls that the answer. What saith the answer of God? &gt;&gt; To uh to Elijah &gt;&gt; in the message, what does thou hear? Brother Brandham says these few words. And Elijah who was trying with a heart in him of God trying to show the people that God was still God and it had backfired on him. &gt;&gt; These are principles, friends. &gt;&gt; Sometimes even though you may be the most fervent message believer and you may be cutting it right to the line and living it as devoted as you know how to live it and be a sanctified believer and do all that is right, it can backfire. Amen. &gt;&gt; It backfired on Elijah. It backfired on the messenger. &gt;&gt; It backfired on men who have lived valiant and fought valiantly. But it's backfired on them. But it's then what happens when it does that? It backfired on him. And he ran out into the wilderness when he heard it. And there he laid under the juniper tree trying to find consolation. He sent his servants away and left him. And our story goes in three places. I'd like you to notice the three places. I'll refer to them a wee bit as we go on. Mount Carmel, &gt;&gt; that's where he had the great victory. &gt;&gt; That's where he slew the prophets. That's where fire came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; That's where supernatural things happened. That's where he restored the word and rebuilt the altar of God. &gt;&gt; At Mount Carmel. The next was under the juniper tree &gt;&gt; where he had ran to save his life and where he prayed, "Let me die. I'm not greater than my father's." That's getting fairly low. And the third place was a cave where God met him. &gt;&gt; And in the cave, in the cave, there's a a mighty rushing wind. &gt;&gt; But God's not in the wind. And there's an earthquake and God's not in the earthquake. Shook things down. And there's a fire, but God's not in the fire. &gt;&gt; But there's a still small voice. And brother Brandham says the cave that our cave is not Elijah's perhaps physical cave but you can go back perhaps into your memory and reach down into the uh resource of your soul down into the recesses of your inner being and become quiet before God and listen &gt;&gt; and see if he'll speak &gt;&gt; in a still small voice. That's why we often find the enthusiasm and we can't keep the enthusiasm. We're not here to pump the enthusiasm up. &gt;&gt; That's not the game. That's not it. The Mount Carmel's come and glorious times and victory, but you can expect there may be a a juniper tree experience and then God calls you to go back and he comes and meets you in your cave. When you give back into your own inner being and become quiet before God and after the fires passed and after the earthquake and the tempest that tried to shake your life to pieces &gt;&gt; and it wasn't successful &gt;&gt; and after the wind and after the fire and after the glorious things and after it died down and and after the earthquake, you found you're still standing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then God allows you to go to a cave &gt;&gt; and that's quiet. &gt;&gt; Then there's a mighty wind, &gt;&gt; but you realize God's not in the wind. &gt;&gt; There's an earthquake. &gt;&gt; There's trouble and God's not in it either. He just uses it. There's a fire. God's not in the fire. Then there's a still small voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the voice was a question. &gt;&gt; What doest thou here? &gt;&gt; What are you doing with your focus on all these circumstances? &gt;&gt; They're true. This is happening. This is happening in the message. This is happening. This is happening in my family. This is happening. Oh, how how is the people backsliding and all these things? But a still small voice &gt;&gt; and it wasn't even didn't even address all those things. They might have been absolutely true. This is happening and that's happening and my friends and and whatever more all this is happening. That's not it. God still God. &gt;&gt; But the question was what doest thou here Elijah? &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Why are you consumed? Why is this so affected you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why do thou what doest thou hear? And then he the answer apostle Paul said the answer of God was I've reserved 7,000. &gt;&gt; 7,000. He didn't know another one. &gt;&gt; He didn't know any of the 7,000. God had 7,000. And I can tell you regardless of what you say, there is a spotless bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And she's going to walk directly into the rapture. &gt;&gt; And there will be a rapture. There will be a marriage supper. &gt;&gt; But make sure that you're there. &gt;&gt; We can't be consumed and all taken up with all that takes place around us. There's something more happening. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God can be in the supernatural. God can be in the Mount Carmel. God can be in the great times when you just felt that you couldn't that you're going to be raptured yourself. You felt you're going to be carried away. And those times pass and uh then there's other things that come in. I'll come back to this in a few moments. And the and the prophet said, "It's very strange." He said, "You watch after your mount caramels, you're going to have a juniper tree." &gt;&gt; He said, "Whenever whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God pours down and does something for you, look out, &gt;&gt; Sam." He said, "Satan's on the track." He said, "Just remember the next day, that Monday, after a good day on Sunday, it's going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence you out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before." &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't take him long. &gt;&gt; The very next day, you have a wonderful day. Here we are today. What kind of a day will we have? Only God knows supernatural things happen. I can tell you this. Last week, I've seen the hand of God come down. I thought, "Oh, how glorious you are in battle." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Just incredible victories &gt;&gt; that you'll no doubt hear about in the future, but it happens on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; When it seems like it's impossible, God comes on the scene and you know it's God. [Music] I don't even know whether I should say it, but our brother Toby and Sister Rebecca got called to the immigration department and it was just incredible. You don't know the circumstances. You don't need to know all the circumstances, but it's dead end at both ends. Totally dead end at both ends. I didn't remember exactly the prayer, but brother Toby said to Rebecca came into my office and two weeks ago week before last and we spoke together and they were had a big question about a very very major decision in their life and they and and brother Toby had said he prayed and he said whatever brother Ed says I take that as from God telling God whatever he says I take it as coming from God and and one is east and one is west and we had a conversation and we spoke and and he says I want a direct answer yes or no that's always hard and then we prayed and brother Toby said do you remember what you prayed I said not exactly he said you prayed let the person who makes the decision that person that makes the decision cause them to lay their hand on this file and they got a call within about two days and said, "I want to see you tomorrow morning at 9:30." And I can tell you the hand of God &gt;&gt; move supernaturally &gt;&gt; on their case. &gt;&gt; Is that all right, brother Toby? &gt;&gt; Here's here's how supernatural is. I'll I'll go this far. The person said addressed brother Toby said there's no possible way it's impossible for you under your status to have a work permit a work visa in this country. But she said all those files come to me. I'm the one that makes the decision and I'm giving you a work permit. [Music] Hallelujah. I say glory to God. And if this woman should ever hear this service, I'd say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; She heard the voice of God and did something. Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; You have to understand some of the greatest things that happened, we can't mention to you, but I want to give glory to God. I go as far as I can over this pulpit, but believe me, friends, God's on the move. God is doing supernatural things. God is moving people and positioning things. And it's incredible when it seems there's no way out. God makes a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the heart of Elijah said that God is God. I say that that same God is present in this building today. &gt;&gt; That same God sent this message that you've embraced. &gt;&gt; So you be ready sometime after a glorious time there come a juniper tree &gt;&gt; and in the same message what hearest thou Elijah? Brother Brandham prays. He said let us pray. Listen to his prayer. then you'll find out where he was. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh Lord, here they are. Forgive me, Lord. I didn't mean to say it like that. Here we are. Lord, just as true as I'm standing here, God, I believe that you're telling your church, you're calling your church into a cave now to speak to them. And Lord, it doesn't altogether have to be made a cave like the prophet hid in him. But it can be a little cave in in our memory. It can be a cave in our soul where we can move back, stop, &gt;&gt; take inventory, &gt;&gt; look around and listen and see what we can hear. Right, &gt;&gt; friends. We need to do that. &gt;&gt; We need we must not be swallowed up with everything that happens from day to day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in our association and amongst our friends and amongst our family and amongst the message at large or amongst the world or amongst your job or amongst your school or amongst your studies, whatever it is, we have to stop. go back in our memory. &gt;&gt; When you touched me, &gt;&gt; when you met me, &gt;&gt; when you called my name, &gt;&gt; when you revealed yourself, &gt;&gt; this message became so clear. I say, God, you're real. &gt;&gt; You're true. &gt;&gt; Start saying it all over again. Start confessing the right thing. You're the author of this word. You're the author of this message. You sent this messenger. You sent them directly to me. You put that book in my hand. You sent that witness to me. And oh God, how great you are. &gt;&gt; Go back in your memory. &gt;&gt; Go back in your take inventory and look around and see what you can hear. Said, "We've heard the wind and we're grateful for it. We've heard the rushing winds. We've heard the roaring revivals. We've seen the miracles of Mount Carmel or we've seen the the mighty winds of Mount Baker &gt;&gt; and we've seen the defeat and Lord, we have we're tired tonight. We're nervous. He's speaking of himself. Have you ever been there? &gt;&gt; Have you ever got felt tired? &gt;&gt; You felt wear &gt;&gt; God knows that &gt;&gt; we're wearied. We're tired. We're nervous. and we need you. &gt;&gt; We're laying here under the juniper tree. &gt;&gt; Feed us of thy truth. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you while he was under the juniper tree saying, "Let me die." &gt;&gt; God had angels baking him food. &gt;&gt; And on the strength of that food, he went 40 days. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While you're down in the pit and while you're at the very end of your rope and &gt;&gt; you say, "I don't see any way out." &gt;&gt; God has angels around you. &gt;&gt; He's got a messenger that has delivered a word. And if you open and listen to yourself, listen to your inner being, you'll find there's food right there. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go and find it. It's right there. &gt;&gt; You just turn around, the food's right beside you. and the drink. &gt;&gt; And on the strength of that food, and on the strength of that drink, he went many days till he got to a cave where he could hear the voice of God. &gt;&gt; The voice of God was an answer. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have a question. He was just telling the Lord, "Lord, this is the way it is. Lord, this is the way it is. I've been very jealous for you. I've been very faithful. I've I've done all that I can do. I've come to the service. I've done all I can for my family, for my children, for my brothers. I I I've done everything I thought I've been through. And I've seen the the I I've seen the altars tore down. I've seen the standards start to diminish. And I've been so troubled over it. Oh my. I told my wife the other day, I said, "I saw Pentecost go into a decline, into a steep decline, and I was a troubled young man sitting on a log looking into the face of Elijah with a thousand questions in my heart and soul. Oh God, what is the answer? &gt;&gt; He says, "Have you have you heard the my message false anointed ones? Spring of 19 think about it now. Spring of 1961, May, last two weeks of May 1961. He didn't preach it till 1965. I couldn't have heard it. He hadn't been preached yet, but that what was going to come in 65 was the answer then. So he just went to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? That messenger was in a timeless realm. &gt;&gt; I didn't even discover it for years later. &gt;&gt; Didn't discover it like that. And the answer came from God. &gt;&gt; Friends, in the midst of your dilemma, &gt;&gt; the answer's right beside you. [Applause] [Music] Right? When you can see no light at all, all darkness. We don't have to say there's light at the end of the tunnel. The light standing right beside you. Thank you, &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; We heard the revivals were laying under the juniper tree. He said, "Feed us thy truth. &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Take us from here this moment, &gt;&gt; Lord. Listen to the prophet's prayer. Take us from here, Lord, &gt;&gt; to the cave, &gt;&gt; and let us hide there in the cliff of the rock, &gt;&gt; until we hear that still small voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He concluded from his surroundings that he must be the only one. When you look at your surroundings, my friends and my brothers and sisters, and you come with a conclusion, one thing that I I feel assured that I can say in all truth, your conclusion is incorrect. &gt;&gt; This must be the way it is because I've looked at everything around me and I've looked at everything and that is true and this is all right. So it must be this. It's not that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not that. &gt;&gt; That's not the end of the road. &gt;&gt; Are you Can you say amen to it? &gt;&gt; God was on Mount Carmel. God was under the juniper tree. God was at the cave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What I'm saying here today, I don't care what your circumstances is, God will never leave you nor forsake you. So it covers the whole congregation today. Whether you're in your Mount Carmel and you're seeing supernatural things and having marvelous things and fire from heaven, I just say praise God. It might not be that way tomorrow morning. But if you're on Mount Carmel, praise God. &gt;&gt; And then if you finally decided that uh you can scarcely live and you're you're at the end of the rope and you've got to give it all up and you're under your juniper tree, God's there. I don't care how low you are this morning. I don't care what your circumstances are. God's there. &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends. God even gave life to the juniper tree. &gt;&gt; God knew Elijah was going to crawl under that one. &gt;&gt; God knew he was going to say, "Let me die. &gt;&gt; I'm the only one left. &gt;&gt; I've been faithful to the Lord and let me die." And there was angel. There was food already prepared for him. And I say to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, there's food that's already been prepared. It's called a message food. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's there's something exactly that is God's answer. &gt;&gt; Answer of God doesn't always sound like an answer. But what saith the answer of God to you? The answer is a divine response. &gt;&gt; It's not what come from your friend or what you heard on the telephone. Forget the telephone. &gt;&gt; It's not what somebody texts to you. &gt;&gt; It's not what somebody put on some other social network for you. That's not God's method. &gt;&gt; God's method is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. sometime coming not even through a ministry over the o over the pulpit but when you get back down into your inner being &gt;&gt; and you ponder the work of God in your life and you have to come up with a conclusion that was God back there that was God here that was God's been in my life he's done things he has spoken to me and then just sit quiet and you'll hear another voice a quiet voice &gt;&gt; still small voice a divine uh response, an oracle. And the oracle is something that the children of Israel believe came from the Holy of Holies. There are times when people cry out to God and they don't actually cry for anything specific. the children of Israel under the cruel hand of Egypt. They were crying out. They were crying out because of their burdens. They were crying out because of their task masters. No doubt mothers were crying out for their situation their children were born into. They were crying out to God. &gt;&gt; And God sends an answer. He sends the answer in the form of a deliverer. &gt;&gt; Amen. He sent the answer in the form of a man. &gt;&gt; It was exactly what they needed, &gt;&gt; but they didn't recognize what they needed. And often, and I'll come to it a little later, the prophet said God sends them exactly what they need, &gt;&gt; but it because it doesn't come in the way they want it &gt;&gt; or the way they expected it &gt;&gt; and because the very answer didn't come the way they had it figured out in their mind. So, let me tell you friends, don't figure it out in your mind. &gt;&gt; Let God send the answer. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Are you in agreement? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you'll receive it, &gt;&gt; God will do it something for you. &gt;&gt; A special a special visitation. &gt;&gt; So, what God sends is his answer, which is often rejected because it doesn't come the way that the people expect it. &gt;&gt; A little off the subject, but still relates. The first question that was ever asked was by the serpent. That's the first question. Adam and Eve never had any questions until after they listened to the serpent. The serpent asked the first question. Hath God said? And from that time the world has been filled with questions, &gt;&gt; questions that are scarcely any answers for. And and there are no answers for a lot of people. But there are answers for the believer. &gt;&gt; There is &gt;&gt; the answer of God sometimes comes in the way of a of a call. God may call and that is even his answer. So the Bible says, "And the Lord said to Moses, calling him when he was before the bush, and the Lord said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry." That's what he heard was a cry. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it may not even be something that's verbal. It may not be something that you even is vocalized. Have you ever been there &gt;&gt; where you just grown? &gt;&gt; I've been with people. I prayed with them when the cry was so deep they couldn't utter it. They couldn't find words and they just groaned. They fall to their knees and their face to the floor and they just oh there is no words. God God knows exactly the word &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He can define that sound precisely. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God heard you. I'm I know I'm talking to you because I know this message came directly from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to be old. You don't have to be an old person. You can be a very young person. I don't want to give personal experiences, but things took place in my life and I just knew. All I knew is that this is terribly wrong. You have everybody and all your family and everybody tore away from you and you're you're you're there alone. And there's something set up inside and it just it's a it's a groaning. It's a it's a cry. And God said, I've heard their cry by reason of their task masters, for I know their sorrows. Come now, therefore, he said to Moses, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth the people, my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses asked, "Who shall I say sent me?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He had a question. Who? Who? Who is sending me? &gt;&gt; Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am that hath sent me unto you. &gt;&gt; Pharaoh asked, he had a question. Who is this Lord that I should obey his voice and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. Well, I can tell you in a few days, in a few days, he knew who that Lord was. &gt;&gt; Why? Because his question was being answered. &gt;&gt; God Moses was God's answer. &gt;&gt; This is my answer. &gt;&gt; The serpent, the rod goes down. The serpent eats up the other serpents. the flies come and the frogs come and and all the things come and and finally death comes. He knew who God was &gt;&gt; and he he knew it so well. He told him get away from here &gt;&gt; because he knew he thought they were the source of his trouble when he himself &gt;&gt; was the his idolatry and godless nation and even though he was a superpower &gt;&gt; they were their own worst enemy. Friends, I hope you can read something in that. &gt;&gt; America's problems are from within. &gt;&gt; Their problems are from within. Our problems in this country from within. &gt;&gt; It's not the bird on the outside. It's the worm at the core. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the sin that's at the core of the nation, &gt;&gt; corrupting from within. &gt;&gt; You can do everything you can to fix it, but it's Satan's Eden. Hallelujah. That's our answer. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And you better believe it. &gt;&gt; That's the answer of God. &gt;&gt; Who is this Lord? And God sends his answer. It's amazing. God sends his answer until Pharaoh recognized it. But the people had trouble recognizing it. Even the people that he delivered recognized it. and then they didn't recognize it and so I won't get into that. But then God God promised the answer to the sin question to the problem. He said the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head. &gt;&gt; What is he talking about? He's talking about the answer. &gt;&gt; He's not even there isn't even a question yet, but he's giving the answer. And he said, "God, it it was another time in Israel when they were under great distress, crushed under the into the submission of Rome, under the cruel foot, under their cruel foot." And God sends the answer. And a prophet said in the breach, "The kinsman redeemer must be born of the human race." &gt;&gt; And here that leaves us on a limb. But let me sound the trumpet to you. Here's a prophet sounding the trumpet to you. &gt;&gt; The virgin birth &gt;&gt; produced &gt;&gt; the virgin birth produced the product. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love those words. &gt;&gt; The answer to you. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, we wouldn't have a church full of people today if that answer hadn't come. No wonder they can say Christ is the answer and Christ is still the revealed message of the hour. &gt;&gt; People come to me and have asked that in my office and said, "Should we go to Christian counselors? Should we go to Christian psychologists?" I said, "They can help a lot of people, but they can't help you &gt;&gt; because you have an answer that even goes beyond them. They're still asking questions &gt;&gt; at the end of all of their psychology. They're still filled with questions. But when you have the answer and it works, you don't have a question anymore. &gt;&gt; How many people here have had the question answered? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The craving of your soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The virgin birth produced the product and the virgin birth produced our kinsman redeemer. &gt;&gt; None other. Listen who was the answer? None other but the almighty God became Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; One of us. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel the kinsman redeemer was met. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the scripture says he came to his own and his own received him not. The answer came &gt;&gt; the complete answer to the whole problem. The answer came. It didn't come in the way they expected it to come. &gt;&gt; And when the answer didn't come the way they wanted to come, they turned it down. &gt;&gt; He came to his own, but his own received him not. But as to many as received him, &gt;&gt; to them gave he power to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The answer came to those needing answers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they received him not. He said when all of them was crying for a Messiah and God sent them one but one wanted a general, one wanted an education machine and all so forth, but God sent them a baby. &gt;&gt; It might not come. It may come in a way that you'd even wonder. You couldn't possibly believe that this is an answer. Oh, if I could only tell you how God, he knows how to turn things around and God's wheels can turn very slow. We become impatient. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I looked back even this last week and recognized someone that was maybe met even years ago. You didn't realize it at the time. It was just a casual acquaintance. And many years later, God, you realize God set up that person and that contact so that that one would mention your name or mention something about the message over to someone else. And years later, then that contact is made again. And you realize this was God's network. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I tell you, before there was ever an internet, God had his own net. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we needed Elijah back there. We needed the tishbite. &gt;&gt; We needed him &gt;&gt; on Mount Carmel. We needed him under a juniper. We needed him in a cave because that same life matches our experience today. &gt;&gt; We needed all of that. &gt;&gt; Desperately. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you ought to be able to say, "Thank God for sending Elijah the Tishbite. Thank God for these men. &gt;&gt; Thank God for David and what he went through. Solomon and these all these prophets. Thank God for the apostles. &gt;&gt; Thank God for what they went through. I found myself there. Thank God for the messenger he sent today. &gt;&gt; That he was humble enough to say, "Oh God, I'm nervous and I'm I'm under a juniper tree." &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; Then that doesn't make you feel so bad. Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't dare ask. I'd like to find out how many are under juniper trees today. So, I want to chop it down. &gt;&gt; That's the way I feel. But maybe you need to be there for a little while. &gt;&gt; Be there until you realize you just turn your head around. You find out there's some there's food for you right there. &gt;&gt; You'll get home this afternoon. Maybe just pick up a message book and you'll find out there was angel food already prepared. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about food that'll let you go on the strength of it for many days. &gt;&gt; We must not, there's a lesson now. We must not determine how the answer is supposed to come &gt;&gt; because it'll come in a different way than what you expected. &gt;&gt; Right? God hiding in simplicity says he came according to the word. But why didn't they why didn't they receive him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he didn't come the way they thought he ought to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In Queen of Sheba, you're sitting very reverently. Listen by these next words. What would happen? Now the prophet's asking a question. What would happen if all the people that call by the name of the Lord if every one of them would rally around the great gift of God today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit. What would have happened? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He asked the question and what would take place? Right. &gt;&gt; What would take place if every bornagain Christian in Texas, he was in Texas, Dallas, where we will be in in November. What would happen if every born again believer in Dallas in Texas rallied around the gift of God? &gt;&gt; Listen to me. Gives now the answer. Texas would be the most popular place in all the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say that was some that some exaggeration. No exaggeration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was speaking of the possibilities. &gt;&gt; What he could see in God, &gt;&gt; the spirit of Elijah &gt;&gt; being rejected, the message being rejected. But what would happen if this place would receive the gift of God and everyone rally around that gift that God sent? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What would happen in this place? What would happen in the Pacific Northwest if every person I'm speaking directly to you, every man, woman, and child forsook your circumstances. Forget your juniper tree. Get back in your cave and hear the voice of God and hear the answer of God to this dilemma. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in your complaint about the message. I'm not interested in your questions about it. God will answer them as he needs it. I'm not interested in our little aggravations about one another or whatever more these little upsets. You know how long that will go? That will go on till you left this world. I'm interested in the answer of God. &gt;&gt; God has an answer for every one of your lives. &gt;&gt; And that answer is not some distant place. The answer is present here now. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I'm under a juniper tree. God made that juniper tree. God created the situation &gt;&gt; so that you come to the place that maybe you'd call out to God &gt;&gt; and he would it would give him an opportunity to come and answer you and speak to you. &gt;&gt; And I say the answer is closer to you than you dare think. &gt;&gt; The answer's right beside you. God's already sent his answer &gt;&gt; in the form of a message. &gt;&gt; That's not just some books on the shelf or some CDs or tapes. That's not what it is. It's the answer to the dilemma of &gt;&gt; Leodysia. &gt;&gt; And it will be our answer until he takes us out of this life and out of this mortal into immortality. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let me sound a trumpet. The answer &gt;&gt; is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The answer is in the sanctuary today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's been effective. &gt;&gt; The answer has cut the shackles of sin and habits from you. &gt;&gt; The answer has changed the nature of many of you &gt;&gt; from renegades, from rebellious people. The answer has changed you from religious fanatics to be a believer of the word of God. &gt;&gt; The answer is here. And the answers for everybody. &gt;&gt; Not just those rejoicing. The answers for you &gt;&gt; sitting there quietly in your cave. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt hear a still small voice. And after you have told all your prayers to God and you know that he heard you, his answer is going to come in the question. What doest thou here? &gt;&gt; What doest thou hear? Why is your mind and your soul consumed with things that are of no avail? and no spiritual benefit. &gt;&gt; You young people, I speak to you, you have hopes for the future, things that you're going to do and going to be. Don't put your trust there. It may never happen, &gt;&gt; but there's somebody that has the answer for every one of your lives. I can tell you God has an answer &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? The answer is present friends. He's asking, "What are you doing here?" Well, I'm just standing firm as I know how. I've I've been so jealous for this word. I've been so faithful to this word. I've done everything I can for this word. And still, it gets worse and gets worse. No wonder the prophet he's went around the world and went into all of these places. My heart has been so touched as I read of the places he went and not not in a jet age &gt;&gt; but in the time he was and the conditions he went into in in Africa and around the world and in India and these different places and then he says I come back and come back in the places even worse and they don't hear it and God was sending his answer but they maybe wanted it in a different way. They wanted it more eloquent or they wanted whatever. I don't know what the people wanted. I don't know what we all want. &gt;&gt; But we go on week after week and year after year and I can say what is it that you expect? &gt;&gt; What is it that you desire? I can say one thing on the authority of God's word. The answer for your life. The answer that can make it absolutely a a a a glorious spiritual success. That answer is here with us. The food is here with us. Say, I have a long journey ahead. Eat up what God has prepared. Eat the food that God has given. Drink the drink that God has given. And you'll go as many days as you need to go. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh America, now he's addressing a nation. Oh, America tonight would rally. If America tonight would rally around the gift of God, &gt;&gt; it would be a golden age, &gt;&gt; it would be a millennium for us here. &gt;&gt; I want you to say a yay and amen to everything that you agree with in these lines. If we'd rally around the gift that God that the Holy Ghost, of course, all America would rally around the gift that God sent to us, the Holy Ghost, it would be a time that they would break down every wall of partition between Methodist and Baptist, between Presbyterian and Lutheran, between Pentecostal, and we'd have a golden age. And the power of God would sweep this nation from sea to shining sea. &gt;&gt; Every nation under heaven would fear us. &gt;&gt; Think of it, friends. It was right there. The answer of God came in a little seventh grade educated Kuckian with a halting language, but the answer of God was right before them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No wonder he would cry out and say all these tens of thousands and you can hear him in prayer. Oh God, why don't they hear it? Why don't they hear it? &gt;&gt; When people see your lives and on the one side of they wish they could live that life on the other side of it, they find all kinds of fault with it. &gt;&gt; It's the devil. &gt;&gt; That's all it is. It's the devil. &gt;&gt; They know it's the right life. They know they they they admire you young ladies. They admire you families. They admire you men. They wish they could be like that, but the devil keeps them from it. &gt;&gt; Is that not true? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Says, "And all Israel believed the gift that God and all Israel believed the voice of the sign. &gt;&gt; Believe the gift that God give them. If America would just give believe the gift that God's given us these last days, his son in the form of the Holy Ghost raised from the dead living amongst us according to his promise. If we'd only cherish that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want you just say, "I got to go to church." &gt;&gt; But when you leave this place, I want you to cherish. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I went back into my cave in that study. &gt;&gt; Amen. While brother Ryan was leading the service, I went back into the cave of my memory because the prophet gave me the words to get the access and I remembered when God did certain things and I knew it was God &gt;&gt; and I thought I will just give him I'll give him glory once again and I thought I would just say something to him. I don't know. I don't understand a lot of things, but there's one thing I know. That presence. I didn't see you physically, but that presence. And I want to say this. If I would if I'd go into if I go into eternity in the next hour, I would want to have this on my lips. That presence, Lord Jesus, I know it was you. &gt;&gt; And I love it. &gt;&gt; That's all I can say. I love it. And the words came out of my mouth. I was going to sing it. Maybe we will yet. My Lord, my Jesus, I love thee. &gt;&gt; I know thou art mine. &gt;&gt; And for thee all the follyies of sin I resign. &gt;&gt; My blessed redeemer, my savior art thou. &gt;&gt; If ever I love thee, my Jesus is now. &gt;&gt; Rally around the gift that God has sent. while someone is just able to make it a tradition or make it some kind of a just a a church formality. We don't want that. This great age of civilization, modern civilization has produced a nation of neur neurotics. Really great distress of this day and it causes them to cry out. You know what friends? It's not just believers that cry out. There's a lot of a lot of good people, a lot of people that don't go to church. They're crying out. They're pained. They want an answer. How blessed we are. And he said in investments, "What if people today that's praying for a Messiah and we're praying for a great something to happen?" He said there we Pentecostals. He was in Phoenix. And maybe he answers your prayer and you don't know it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you wouldn't receive it. If he answered it, it wouldn't come in the color that you prayed for. That's what they've always done. &gt;&gt; And if it come again, it would come in the same color. It would come in the same package. Just skip right over the top of it. In world falling apart, he said, "Now we find out that the world wants their own messiah. Russia wants theirs and the United States wants theirs. The church world wants theirs. Each one wants their own Messiah, but they want it in the way that they can control it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They want to have control over the Messiah. &gt;&gt; And if God would send it in their own taste, they certainly would accept it. But you see, then God knew their needs. &gt;&gt; He's not promised to send us our wants. It's what we ask for, but our needs. &gt;&gt; God knows what we need. &gt;&gt; Back then, they needed the nation of Israel needed a baby. &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet in the end time. So much of the word was lost. &gt;&gt; The loose ends could never be put back together. Oh, how we needed a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it came with the first pull. And everybody rallied &gt;&gt; around Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; That kind of a showdown. &gt;&gt; There was no other ministry. Just think of it friends. No other ministry could demonstrate that. What a showdown. &gt;&gt; And would speak a message and they hated the message, rejected the message, would stand right there and start calling them out. And oh, how they loved that. &gt;&gt; Oh, they loved that. But after that mighty wind, then it changed &gt;&gt; and start to reveal the very secret of their hearts. &gt;&gt; And after that mighty happening, then came the still small voice. &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, brother Brandon got up and he preached and screamed out his message, poured out his soul," which he did. But after you long long after you leave a sanctuary like this, I pray that God will bring a still small voice to you and begin to speak to you. &gt;&gt; The answer came in our day, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know our questions today and I hope I'm not considered to be fanatic but most of the questions that you have and I have many of the questions about today and the circumstances of our lives and so on have been created by the devil himself. And the reason I said that is so I can say this. In Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Notice speaking to you and I being personally identified by the original headship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the answer to the devil's question. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to have a dance. I don't care what answer, what question the devil has. We have the answer. I have Elijah telling me we have the answer. &gt;&gt; You know why I have such confidence as Elijah ministry? He been on Mount Carmel. &gt;&gt; He's been under the juniper. He's been in the cave. He's had all of those experiences. He come and tell us exactly what it is all about. &gt;&gt; I had never put those three together. I've never heard any other minister put those three together. Who did he put them together for? For you? &gt;&gt; For me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I look in the face of sometime you young people. And and I I don't blame you kind of looking maybe a little bit distant. But I'm telling you, you'll remember what brother Biscll said. You'll be there someday. &gt;&gt; You'll reach that point someday. [Music] &gt;&gt; What kind of a I'm not trying to be dramatic now, but what goes through people's minds? What goes through young teenagers minds when they go and hang themselves? &gt;&gt; You think they find they've got a they've got questions, &gt;&gt; big ones and no answers. &gt;&gt; They say life becomes hopeless. &gt;&gt; How can life become hopeless when they haven't even entered womanhood or manhood yet? I just mentioned the other day it's an it's national news in one of the in one of the uh uh native communities in Northern Ontario. They've had so many happen so quickly. What kind of a young man can have fame and fortune in the hockey world? And three of them in about one week I guess it was or two weeks. three of them in just a short time is taken take their own life. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the devil's got questions but no answers. &gt;&gt; I'm announcing to this congregation, everybody on the internet, this God has sent his answer. &gt;&gt; I don't care what dilemma you have. I don't care what question you have. God has sent his answer to this generation. [Applause] When you try to get an answer, what do you do? You think about it. Well, forget that because the headship, according to Elijah, the headship has come here. &gt;&gt; The head of the body, &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ. He said the headship. &gt;&gt; We have the headship. That's why we have the devil's answer. You don't know what the devil is devising. You don't even know what he might want to do tomorrow. But the head that has come to the bride knows exactly what he's going to do. [Music] &gt;&gt; He said the devil. &gt;&gt; That's the reason he's howling the way he is. His wickedness has been He said his scheme has been uncovered. &gt;&gt; Who uncovered it? Not some preacher behind the pulpit. The message of the hour. The answer came and uncovered and exposed him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's had he's had his devices. He's had his all kinds of schemes for your life, &gt;&gt; for your home, &gt;&gt; for this church, for every bride church. He hates this message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm so glad that this message has has given us a confirmation that he is defeated. And I'm rejoicing in his &gt;&gt; defeat. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes on. He's still in this. Listen what he says. He says, and this he's expressing and he says, "You think I'm beside myself? I'm not. &gt;&gt; We've got the devil's answer." &gt;&gt; They thought he was beside himself. He was having such a glorious time. You think I'm beside myself? I'm not. &gt;&gt; We've got the devil's answer. That's why he was reacting the way that he is. &gt;&gt; You think I'm beside myself today? Not a bit. I'm so glad I can announce to this people, anybody that comes to hear me speak, we've got the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "It's not me that liveth, but Christ that the word living in me. &gt;&gt; It's not my idea. It's his power. &gt;&gt; It's not your scheme. It's not your idea. It's his power. &gt;&gt; If you didn't have that power in you today, I dare I dare even consider where you might be. &gt;&gt; God has held you. &gt;&gt; God has preserved you. I can say as Jesus said, Satan have desired to have you. &gt;&gt; But Jesus prayed for you. &gt;&gt; The messenger prayed for you. &gt;&gt; I have prayed for you and we have prayed for one another. &gt;&gt; What a defeat upon an enemy. &gt;&gt; When a son of God standing by the throne of God begins to pray and call a person's name, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; said, "We've got the answer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is risen &gt;&gt; and he's paid the price for our redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What God in Christ manifested, he gave that flesh and blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh be redeemed &gt;&gt; that that God in his redeemed flesh could manifest his word for the day as he did in that day. And he goes, "Woo, glory." &gt;&gt; Why are you speaking about what was happening right then? He wasn't rejoicing in the past. And I'm not rejoicing in just what he said. I'm rejoicing in what he said is alive and quickened in a people today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Occasionally people have said, "Oh, brother Ed, you know, yeah, just amazed and you know, you just keep plowing forward. Hallelujah. Do you know what? Yeah, it's tough sometimes, but it's not that hard. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? There is no other way. &gt;&gt; There is no other option. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just give me a couple minutes and I'm going to close. &gt;&gt; What do thou hear, Elijah? He said, "Mount Carmel's wonderful." He said, "You might be under the juniper tree and where you want to give up, but God has angel food prepared for you." I want to just give some titles here. Our cave or your cave experience. Another one, the Messiah in the message. You're thinking about it. Everybody wants a Messiah and they call for a Messiah. Russia wants a Messiah. America wants a Messiah. The churches want a messiah because they want somebody to come out and make them a spectacular organization or a superpower, spectacular country. They want to achieve. You're talking about they want to achieve and get to this get to the moon and get to the out into the universe and get space and achieve a great name in the world. That's not it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're not interested right here in this church. I speak for myself. I trust I speak for you. We're not interested in the name. I'm interested in one thing. I want to be an example to this glorious message. Want to live a life that's honorable and a credit to this message and do everything in our power with our with our united resources to get the word and get it out to some other people that someone else could enjoy what you and I are rejoining. Wouldn't you wouldn't it be a wonderful thing for you &gt;&gt; just to be able to see someone else come out &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; from their terrible life of misery &gt;&gt; and find out there was an answer to their life. &gt;&gt; The answer is Christ. In a still small voice, I just looked up the still, a whisper, calm whisper. God's great mystery. What the eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then was given out down to his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was once in God's mind? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is this a quote or is this a reality? &gt;&gt; What was once was in God's mind is now in the body of Christ. Jesus making love to the church, his bride, whispering his secrets to her. Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, &gt;&gt; we have heard &gt;&gt; a still small voice. &gt;&gt; Mine is in the still small voice because I'm rejoicing over it. &gt;&gt; But we've heard a still small voice. Many times there is no voice. It's just me in the scriptures or me with a message &gt;&gt; or me listening to the prophet's voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. or me having nothing in front. You having nothing in front of you, no Bible in your hand, but the thing that you heard or a statement that was said. And when you get back in your cave and you begin to consider your life and your future and and the threats against you and whatever more and you hear something coming back, reverberating, the Holy Ghost has blown out the channel of your memory and you hear a voice coming to you. It is me. Be not afraid. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That Messiah is here. &gt;&gt; Not because I said it. And not because this church world says it. And not because only it's in the Bible, but what was in the Bible has been manifested as a living thing today. And that has said to me, that has made it quickened. &gt;&gt; I It is I &gt;&gt; be not afraid. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is I when everything seems that you're at the end of your rope at your end of your resources. And I know the pressure this day. I know that even you young people and you families, fathers with your responsibility. You come to places where you just you don't know which way to turn. Remember this. There's a still small voice &gt;&gt; saying it's I &gt;&gt; be not afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing, greatest favor you could do for me today is accept what's being preached. &gt;&gt; Accept it. And the reason I say that is not for my benefit. &gt;&gt; It is for yours. &gt;&gt; I trust that you may receive it &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Do you believe that God knew things from before the foundation of the world? &gt;&gt; Then he knew exactly that I was going to speak this and he knew exactly you were going to be sitting here. &gt;&gt; He had a plan. We're in God's plan. I don't know whether I in expressing my own self I express something that's in you but perhaps it's like there's a I find a cry within the hearts of the people. And the longer we live in the message, I'm I'm I'm just like I'm across your dinner table. I'm across the desk from you. We are reing and enjoy the message. We enjoy the body of Christ. But there's a cry within our hearts and and and and the cry may be it may result from different things. I go back just for a moment just to understand back in Egypt the mothers perhaps cried because they brought children. They saw their daughters and their sons under the weight of the task masters. So that might have been the source of their cry. The fathers perhaps cried because they weren't able to provide for their family and just had meager nothing. The young people perhaps cried because they why was I born in this family? Why why I see these Egyptians and they have, you know, a life of ease and relative. They're not being whipped. And and and the young people see their dad and how would you kids like to see your father under that kind of your mother lashed? This was reality. That's not a that's not a story. That's not a myth. They were whipped. And if you saw your mother and father, I want to put you there. and saw your mother and father being whipped with the lashes and work harder and make more bricks and push that load. So, they all had different reasons for their cry. I'm right down where you live now. Satan has been ruthless. He's torn at lives and he's torn at bodies and some have become racked with disease and sickness and affliction. Satan is in control of the economic system and you may be under the oppression of that. That may be one person's problem while it's not the next one. They might find it quite easy, relatively easy, but the other one just can't hardly find enough. I have people in this church, people in this church that's sitting in this church today told me that they've come to the table and didn't have food to put on the table because the the economics are so severe. What do you think that does to my heart? I just do anything and everything I can must be food on that table. They have their burden. They have their cry. &gt;&gt; They have some of you your homes. There's broken homes there. And there's a cry. There's a weight. There's a pain that no one can share. Everybody has their own cry, &gt;&gt; but it was that cry that God heard. &gt;&gt; And those cries have been, they have been set up, they have come as a result of circumstances and situations in the world. And we could be saying like and maybe not even not even voicing it. Not even voicing it until God until there came an opportunity and God came and said, "What? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? I'm in church. It's Sunday. So I come to church, but when I go out of this door, I still have this pain. I still have this cry. I still have this problem. I'm still faced with this dilemma. And week after week, and I've I ran out into the desert myself. I just went out into the desert. And I'm in a very dry place. I found a juniper tree and I just laid there. I just wished I could quit. I wish I but I can't I can't somehow I can't give up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And you found that there was some strength you found and then God spoke to you and you found enough strength and you ate and you drank and said, "Oh, I heard I heard what the messenger said. I heard somebody say something over the pulpit. I heard a quote. I read a scripture and it gave me strength and I got up and I moved on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this morning &gt;&gt; you're in your cave. &gt;&gt; God is having me tell you. &gt;&gt; Many of you are in your cave and I'm telling you to forget all about the great expecting some great flash, some great thunder, some great wind, some great revival is going to shake the place to pieces. No, God's wanting to say something to you. &gt;&gt; I've been real jealous. I've wanted the best for my family. I've wanted the best for my brothers. I wanted the best for our church. I wanted the best for the bride of Christ. I just I've done everything. Sometimes &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not preaching it. I'm telling you my own testimony. Sometimes I just had to say, "Lord, I don't know what more to do. Give me strength in my senior years. Give me all the strength. Give me more energy." &gt;&gt; All I know is wherever I heard it, people want to hear the message and they didn't have it. We're just doing everything. We're doing it even this last week. We just want I want them to be blessed with what I've been blessed. I want them to be able to read the masterpiece. I want them to be able to read I want them to be able to read these words. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've done all we can. I don't know if we have enough funds. I don't know if we have enough. We want to do what we want to do what we can for our children. I want to see you young people. I just want to see you have a Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; teacher standing in front of you with the glory of God on their face. We've done what we can. Amen. But then there'll be a moment that you have to sit quiet. Ask yourself some very deep questions. Do I believe that this is true? Yes, I do. I believe that this is the only message that God ever vindicated like this. &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. And if you ask yourself a few questions and give the right answer to it, you'll start to feel a strength coming back. &gt;&gt; And I believe there's a still small voice today. &gt;&gt; God is speaking to this congregation and to those on the internet congregation. What What do thou hear? You say, "Well, what do I do with these circumstances?" Then the Apostle Paul, his words come ringing through the centuries. Hear the answer of God to him. I reserved 7,000 others. Hear the answer of God to the bride of Jesus Christ. I reserved every elected. Not one shall be taken out of my hand. All that the father hath given me shall come. &gt;&gt; Hear the answer of God, &gt;&gt; and I shall not lose any of them. &gt;&gt; Church, hear the answer of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our confidence and our rest is there. &gt;&gt; And I don't care where those people are today. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've prayed. I've been jealous. They haven't they haven't surrendered. They're still in their sin. They're still in that terrible condition. That's irrespective. &gt;&gt; That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Completely irrelevant. &gt;&gt; We know who God is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Congregation. &gt;&gt; If this isn't God, close the doors. &gt;&gt; Everyone go home, eat, drink, and be merry. But this is if this is of God, he deserves everything that we have. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give her your energy. Give her your strength. Give her your physical hours that you can help us. We've got We've got young people scattered throughout. Not only young people, we got people scattered. We're doing this building here is used from day to night, from day to day. It's a beehive of activity. We're sending the word out. Sister Debbie is making discs and tapes and I've got people who want t discs from the from the from the camp that we just had. They said, "We want to hear from," can you believe it, that uh uh a service that was spoken at camp went from here to South Africa, and someone from South Africa called uh Brother Tom Brown in Ohio and and said, "We heard your name mentioned over brother Danny Steam's dad, heard the gospel in your front room." And he was outside rejecting it up to a certain time. and her and his mom was there and he was standing there as a young boy on the sofa hearing this message about five or six years old. Hello boys. &gt;&gt; Five or six years old standing on a sofa preaching here years later with his own teenagers in the place and remembering where he heard this message. &gt;&gt; God is God. &gt;&gt; God know who he calls. &gt;&gt; God knows who he needs. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad you're all here today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're here because I have confidence God is going to speak to many of you in a still small voice and he will he will pour in such a divine strength that the enemy's tactics will end up fruitless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he'll end up defeated at your feet. This is the promise of God to his people. Rise in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Rise and be victorious, oh army of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art mine. For thee all the follyies of sin I resign. &gt;&gt; My gracious redeemer, my savior, art thou? If ever I love thee, &gt;&gt; my Jesus did. Now, &gt;&gt; let's stand to our feet. &gt;&gt; Father, we scarcely know what to say. &gt;&gt; And perhaps I don't need to say anymore. Your Holy Spirit will do the speaking, do the talking. Today we're getting ready for the communion. I pray, Father, you give us such a blessed day this afternoon as the people fellowship together. I pray that you'll give us a blessed time and may our hearts just be made ready and be prepared. I ask father that in this service and after service and this afternoon and this evening you'll choose a time and when people get next to themselves go back in the cave of their memory back in the cave of their soul get quiet before God and they'll look this way and look that way and listen listen we'll hear the answer of God to our soul Jesus, we love you.

Our gracious redeemer, our wonderful heavenly father, Lord, our hearts overwhelmed with gratitude and with thanksgiving to you for your divine presence that we have experienced here today, Father. Father, we thank you for the words of eternal life that we've heard from thy divine throne this morning. Heavenly Father, we are so thankful that you're conscious of those times, Lord, when we find ourselves in the caves of our minds. &gt;&gt; In those places, Father, where it's very difficult to tread. In those places, Father, where you alone can meet us and know, Father, the burdens. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. where you where you meet us in the conditions of our beings, Father, where there is no more strength in us to carry on, Father, but we've heard, Lord, you've provided a way, Lord. You've made a way of escape. You've provided food, Lord, in due season where we can eat and be strengthened in the inner man, Father. And oh God, how we are so thankful today that you've given us the answer, Father. Father, we are so thankful that the good news of the gospel has been preached to us today. Father, that the enemy is destroyed. His eminent destruction has happened, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can rejoice, oh father, because we have heard from your divine throne, oh God, that you will not lose one in your holy mountain. That none is able to pluck us from your hands today, Father. There is no conditions of life, oh God, that will take us away from you. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Father, for the word that we've heard this day, oh God. It's it's life into our bones this morning, Lord. It's the strength that we've called for, Father. Lord, I can testify today that what's been preached, Father, is a cry of my own soul that you've heard, Lord. And I know that by speaking that which you've spoken today that you've heard the cry of each and every one of your children. Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you for the answer. Father, thank you, oh God, for the strength that you've given us today. Thank you for this divine power that has come to energize our faith, Lord, to go forward and to claim the victory, Father. Hallelujah. Father, we thank you this morning, Lord. Father, we are empowered in the inner man, Lord. We are supercharged, Lord, and we believe your word today, Father.

Glory be to Jesus this morning. Father, we lift you up on high, oh Lord. We crown you with praise and adoration this morning, Father. Oh, Father, how thankful we are this morning, that we have a God with the answer, Father. We have a God who is fearless, Lord. We have a God who is able to do the exceedingly, the abundantly above all we can ask or think. Father, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Father, you're a God of the impossible today.
