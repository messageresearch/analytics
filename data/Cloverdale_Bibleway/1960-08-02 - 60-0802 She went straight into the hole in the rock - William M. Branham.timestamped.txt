[0:25] with them little eagles they never had
[0:27] their feet on that grass before you know
[0:29] nothing but the old sticky stinky Nest
[0:31] like the world and the mother spread her
[0:33] big wings and picked them up and brought
[0:35] them down and set them down in

[0:49] Pentecostal Jubilee and that old mother
[0:51] as soon as she left him she flew tuck
[0:53] her big wings and flew up on a big High
[0:55] Rock hold of those big wings and sat up

[1:50] wings out just made a big call and every
[1:52] one of them little Eagles run jumped out
