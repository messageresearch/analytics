I wonder if our brother John Andy's Lord Brother John, would you just come and open the service for us in a word of prayer? We do want to remember unspoken prayer request from our sister Violet Laws this morning and also our sister Lydia Colenbrunner. She's worked in the Switzerland convention and she has a special request for a physical need this morning. Amen. I just wonder if the brothers would also come and prepare to take the morning offering. Amen. Maybe as they're coming, can we just sing, Lord, I lift your name, your holy name. [Music] The whole Lord I live in worship now as we go in prayer. Oh holy name [Music] my God for your great I am you are the is my God. [Music] Can we sing? Lord, I lift your name just once more. We go to prayer now. Lord, I lift your name. [Music] I lift your holy [Music] Oh my god. [Music] You are the ris and my comfort. [Music] Can I hear? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's a need on your heart that you just want to lift before the Lord with an upraised hand. Amen. He sees every hand this morning. Brother John. Thank you. Heavenly Father, our father, we're here today because you have birthed us by your word. You screamed over this generation. Where is the generation that will love me, will love you, Lord? And here we are. It's only by your grace and your mercy that a blood came dripping down into this hour with a power of that bleach to take away all of our sin, all of our past. Only God can do this. Only a miracle can do this. Only a creative voice. Oh Jesus, we're humbled today that you have raised us up to be your wife. It's making ourselves ready. We're falling on the rock today. We're falling on you, Lord Jesus. This world is falling apart all around us. Satan's Eden has come to choke. The tree of knowledge is coming to so many hearts and lives, bringing death. He's riding through the land on his pale horse. And we're so grateful for a message. We're so grateful for a light that's come on in this darkness. We just feel like our souls are crying out hosanas and praises. We just feel like lifting up our voices, Lord, and shouting, "Thank you, Jesus." At the same time, Lord, there's tears. Our heart, Lord, is so grateful. We so appreciate you, God. We so love your appearing, God. What you've done in this day, Lord Jesus. You have spread your wings over us. Lord, [Music] we want to run into your pavilion today. Lord, those that are strangers, those that are weary, those that are broken, that your healing, strength, and virtue will lift up every soul that is weary. Every life that Lord needs a touch from you, our hands are lifted up, Lord. Our lives are naked, Lord. You have come to collect those that are honest in heart, Lord Jesus. Come to our hearts, Lord Jesus. That is the heart of the matter, Lord. That you would come and change us. Give us a new desire. Give us a new longing. That when your word comes as it was on the day of Pentecost, Lord, here we are. Lord, the calendar says it's Pentecost 50 days from Easter. Lord, let there be a life quickening among us. Lord Jesus, not just 2,000 years ago, but to recognize that a message has come to take a people into a body change. And these things that are on our hearts, these needs, these things that are so little to you, God, you're the creator. You're the healer. You're the dissolver of all doubts. Lord, you could just breathe a word, just a thought, Lord, and everything would just vanish, Lord. But you've chosen to come in the souls of men and women. But by that creative spoken word, now we would speak and we would have desires. We would have yearnings. It's the same thought, the same word, same atmosphere that is in heaven is in the service right now, permeating through our bodies and healing us, taking cancers away, dissolving, Lord, everything that would be out of order in our systems, Lord. Oh Jesus, our healer. Lord, by your stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; Lover of our souls and deliverer of everything that is ungodly or evil. your dissolver of everything that is filthy or of Satan's kingdom. May the Holy Ghost, Lord, come through this atmosphere. Take hearts and break them down to nothing. Take all of us, Lord Jesus, for we are in need of a touch from you. &gt;&gt; To circumcise us, &gt;&gt; circumcise our souls, Lord. &gt;&gt; May the power of God strike us today, Lord Jesus. Consume us, holy fire. be with these needs, Lord. Our sister Violet has an unspoken request. Touch her family and touch her life. Sister Lydia Coen Brener, we spoke her name, Lord, with other believers on Friday, but once more, Lord, she's probably listening right now. We are a family. We are a body, Lord. the very mention of your name of Jesus. You can come into her system, Lord. And you're the great doctor and physician, what's causing the mass to leave and what's causing these things in her body. You know everything about it. We're under your great microscope today. Lord, I pray that you would touch Sister Lydia. Go out through the internet and throughout all the hundreds of the souls. Even in this building, God, we lift up our hands. There's unspoken requests. There's needs. Lord, we are not ashamed, Lord, to testify that you alone are the answer to our lives. The very lover, love of our soul is Jesus. Would you take our pastor today? Take the gift in his life and the channel that you predestinated for us to find the answer to our needs. May our children and our young people, may the middle-aged and the older ones find access into your presence today, Lord, that every need could be met. Lord, we want to put our all into this service. Strengthen the weary. May we be focused on you, Lord Jesus. Look and live. &gt;&gt; May you come through the songs, come through the worship. Bless this offering, Lord. The tithes and offerings of your people. Bless them. Bless every worshipper today. May we forget about ourselves and those around us. May we be locked into you, Lord Jesus. We're here to listen. &gt;&gt; We're here to obey. We're here to submit ourselves. We're here to say amen to your word and &gt;&gt; become material within our lives. we bless your name and break the bread now that's going to be spoken to us Lord and take the vessel and strengthen him and all of us we pray in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe just as the brothers take up the offering and you have your seats we can sing. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul sweet spirit. Amen. Oh, sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spirit. Sweet over my soul. For my rest is complete. While I sit at your feet, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. Sing it again. Sweep over my soul. Sweet over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Sweet spit. be over my soul. My best is complete while I sit at your feet. Sweet spirit, sweet over my soul. Just want the Lord to have his way this morning. And we do have an announcement want to remember um please announce that everyone is invited Thursday evening July the 18th 2013 to Mountain Baker Bible Way Camp for Brother Timothy Andy Sister Jessica Caldwell's wedding and reception. There's a signup sheet to RSVP on the bulletin board with all the details. Amen. God bless brother Tim. Sister Jessica looking forward to that. Amen. Did we have any luck brother Aaron with I had a number of requests. Um, someone that can't quite cross the border yet that we're looking. Do we have it? This is Elelliana. So, she'd love to be here, but she can't be here yet. Praise the Lord. Amen. God's been good to us. Praise the Lord. Amen. There's been a song on my heart that I've been feeling to sing for some time. Amen. And could we just sing Have Thine Own Way, Lord, as we just before I sing that, we turn the service to Brother Ed, I'm going to sing a song that the Lord's laid on my heart for you. And uh we Amen. It's just been heavy on my heart. And after brother Tom spoke this last Wednesday on trials and being molded by the potter, I said, "Okay, Lord, it's it's the right time." Ultimately, we just want to be surrendered to what God wants to do in our lives. Amen. Amen. And so as we sing this song, just keep that in your heart that we truly just want God to have his way this morning. Oh, have thine own way, Lord. Have thine own way. For thou art the water and I am [Music] Lord hold me and make me after I will what I am way. He has still once more. I'll have thy will. Oh, have thy own way, Lord. Have thy own way. For thorn [Music] holy and [Music] after I will [Music] Hey, [Music] I just wanted to briefly share a little bit of the inspiration behind this song. It's called the breaking and it has to do with the clay and the potter and how we may not always understand but the heart of the believer is thankful for the breaking thankful for what God does in our lives. And the Bible says in Jeremiah 18 that the word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise and go down to the potter's house and there I will cause thee to hear my words. Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter. So he made it again, another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, "Oh house of Israel, cannot I cannot I do with you, as this potter, sayeth the Lord, behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, oh house of Israel." And then a very familiar quote, brother Brandham says in the Smyrnan church age. The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. Neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval. His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. His love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? Oh yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us. For he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit, placing us as sons. And how shall I prove my love to him? I love this part. By believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass. And that's why the believer can say, "Lord, I thank you for the breaking because we know that it's making his mind come to full fruition in our lives." Amen. God bless you. For every vessel there's a season where the potter takes and molds and breaks and shapes it once again. [Music] And though I may not know the reason, there's much that I can't see. He knows what's best for me. He has a purpose for the fires we pass through. So I thank him for his love for me. That brings me to the breaking. [Music] Sometimes he leads beside still waters [Music] and causes me to rest and sleep in pastures soft and green. [Music] Sometimes he leads me through the fire. Yet even there I've seen that still he walks with me. It doesn't matter how the potter molds the clay. His plans for me are perfect. So I yield to him and say, "Though the storm around me rages, I'm anchored to the rock of ages. When it seems there's no escaping, Lord, I thank you for the breaking. When the sky is red above me, I'm reminded how you love me. And when it seems my world is shaking, Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. [Music] I've watched the fires that surround me serve only to cleanse and remove the things that I don't need. And I've seen the waves that crash around me. Though violent they may be, they serve just to wash me clean. [Music] The driving wind can only drive me to my knees. And it's in the darkest nights that I most clearly see. That all the storm around me rages. I anchor to the rock of ages. When it seems there's no escaping, Lord, I thank you for the breaking. When the sky is red above me, I'm reminded how you love me. And when it seems my world is shaking, Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. And as you take me and break me, I'm becoming more like you. So Lord, hold me and hold me. So your likeness will shine through. And when I'm broken, I'm open to the things you want to do. Don't break me, Lord. Break me, [Music] my maker, too, the rock of ages. And through each test and every trial, I know you're with me all the while. I see now what you're undertaking. So Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Through the pain and all molding, I can see your will unfolding. A masterpiece is what you're making. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Oh, thank you for the breaking, Lord. I know a masterpiece is what you're making. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. Lord, I thank you for the breaking. [Music] [Applause] Oh, we thank God for the breaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glad that you're all here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glad that the Holy Spirit is here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'll ask you to rise and we're going to go directly to the word. We only have one service today &gt;&gt; and one service next Sunday because of the long weekend and the traffic and so on. And we brother John Andy's is going down to Reon this afternoon for the evening service there. So we pray that uh there won't be too much of a hold up at the at the border lineup. Uh we trust it'll just be better. Um we also want to remember brother Tim Dodd that's in Germany right now having services with uh brother Pankin. Brother Pankin happens to be brother Dystra's son-in-law. And brother Dyster as you know has been very very ill and is uh has has not recovered his strength as far as I know as yet. So, we just want to remember brother Tim Dodd that God will use him. It's a difficult trip. We just got back from uh Moscow and then two two and a half weeks later he's uh made another trip and he'll be coming back here on Tuesday. So, you know, the physical body we don't have the uh perhaps the same challenges that they had in the days of Wesley riding horses for ever so long. But I'll tell you, the planes are no joy trip. Brother Jim, I'm amazed that you make it back and forth. So, we want to remember that. Also, I'd like to say that uh we really appreciate the brothers that participated in the Friday night service from SFU and what God is doing there. And I can tell you it's not only happening in little local areas. I have uh uh I've been in contact constant contact for probably about the last four years with uh with the brother Basabosi in Uganda and uh I won't spend much time with that but he was that was the wedding that brother Tim Dodd took while the group from the from the school went over to Uganda and it was really really remarkable and incidentally pastor Ibali will be here June June the 23rd, that weekend of June the 23rd where uh to he wants to well we actually we put a lot of pressure on him to he was going to be your midweek and we said no you must be here on the weekend because that is the graduation weekend and these young people didn't go over there to work on your ceiling and then for you to miss out on us here. So he had to rearrange his ticket and pay a little bit extra and and so he will be here that weekend and ministering that Sunday uh the weekend of the 22nd 23rd in there. Uh so you'll remember that also uh this brother Babosi he's he just came out of Ethiopia. he got married and then you know because I had been uh texting him back and forth and brother Tim do been texting him as well about Ethiopia and brother uh Chimpaka brother Jean Chimpaka who uh I feel heavy this morning he should be here in the service and he was denied a visa in New York and had to return to Africa where he's working in Chad and uh the Chimpaka family is here this morning And we want you to know that we're heavy in our hearts with you and we're going to be praying that God will tear down the barriers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let him be here with his family. &gt;&gt; But nevertheless, he had a burden also because Chad is right near Ethiopia. And uh so brother Tim Dodd walked into my office one day not too long ago and he said, "What's what's going on with Ethiopia?" And I said, "Well, I don't know, but I'm hearing quite a bit about it." and he says, "Well," I said, "It's come up three times this last week for me." And uh so we were sharing it with brother Basaboosezi and he said, "Well, he said, "I haven't mentioned it to my bride yet cuz he wasn't married, but he said, I think I'd like to take my honeymoon up there." So, so he got married and took his honey took his wife, new wife to Ethiopia on a honeymoon trip and he just was preaching a house on fire. I tell you what, he stirred up the place, stirred up the people and he got he got a Pentecostal evangelist and he started gave him a few me just met him. So, he gave him a few messages and he said, you know, if that means anything to you and get back in touch with me. that evangelist came back 200 kilometers to see him said, "I've never heard such things as this." And that just started a real stir in his heart. Then he met a he met a lady and and he brother just said to me, he said, "If she was a man, she'd be a preacher." He said she just he said, "I've never met anyone that caught the revelation so clear as she caught it." And uh and so anyway, then he got an open door into a Lutheran church, maybe through her, I don't know, but he got in Lutheran church and he had two translators and I think it was this woman was translating into one language and the pastor was translating into another language and bus is preaching and of course he just comes right down on the message. He starts delivering the message and finally the Lutheran pastor said, "I can't I can't say that." So they had a bit of a discussion at the platform about what what should happen and I don't know exactly how it ended up but I can tell you one thing Ethiopia will never be the same. That's all I can tell you. So I sent him back. I said they gave many accusations against the Lord Jesus but they gave one that was correct and they said he stirth up the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He stirs up the He still stirs up the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he'd be praying for brother Busabosi. He he he just spoke in fact as they're streaming the service right now from Kenya and he spoke at a church in Kenya on his way home. God bless all these workers. &gt;&gt; Let's have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we just sent such a lovely spirit and presence because we believe and know that you are here. You said you'd be here. you would you always keep your appointments. Your messenger told us you keep the appointments. And I pray, Father, that you will send a double portion of the Holy Spirit upon every hungry and waiting heart. And I am waiting. I am just so hungry for you. We love your presence, Lord. And we pray that you will bless the people in a very special way. May this be a a day that we will remember. I ask Father you'll take the word now and anoint us to receive and to speak in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh I'm reading one scripture and it's found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and then I'll have you have your seats but keep your Bibles please open and ready because we have quite a number of scriptures we'd like to refer to. 1 Thessalonians 4:16. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. This is a declaration of victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first. I'd like to read that again and put some emphasis uh on certain phrases. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. &gt;&gt; So that's the Lord himself shall descend from heaven. Notice please with a shout &gt;&gt; with the voice the archangel. &gt;&gt; The Lord isn't the archangel because he couldn't be a kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; and be an angel. &gt;&gt; There was no angel that could fill that place. No angel could take the book of redemption. It is the Lord himself because it was God himself. &gt;&gt; Out of the bosom of the father &gt;&gt; came the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is he is that one. And and so it was no angel. Incidentally, this is the first time in the Bible that the word archangel appears. And it appears when there's a declaration for the dead in Christ shall rise. Just hold that please. You may have your seats. I'd ask for your absolute full attention and I'll do my best. I've I'm just don't know exactly what all God will have me to say and how far I shall go. But uh uh you'll give me some allowance and if you don't agree, well, that's fine. I mean, you just I'm not going to try to pound something home to you that you, you know, have difficult, but just open your heart and think about some of these things and you'll have to follow it very very closely. So now we have this scripture. The first time that an archangel appears in the Bible, Gabriel said he came from the presence of God, but didn't say he was an archangel. I believe he is. The prophet said he was, but he says now the first time that this is mentioned and he and the Lord himself is descending with a shout. That's not all all not in an instant or a flash or all in a moment a time. We do not know that. Uh and with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God and with the trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first. There's a mass victory in that death is conquered. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we want to just go back to the beginning. Our first parents, Adam and Eve, had eternal life. And at some point in time, we don't have a timeline and we don't need one. We just need what the Bible says. But at some point in time, uh, a fallen archangel, Lucifer, began to speak to the wife and uh, begin to speak to her and and sew a seed of unbelief. He found a voice by you the utilization of the serpent, a created being. And he was a created being. He was the one right next to God. And now he comes to the one that's right next to man. And he takes control of him. And this now this battle which had taken place in heaven says Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels and overcame him and cast him and he was cast out of heaven and now they have come to the earth and have come to Eden in the earth. They've come to Eden and so now as the prophet said the battle uh of angels fell upon humans. And now we are seeing the first encounter of a fallen archangel beginning to bring the attack and the battle upon humans and as a result of that death came and he was the author of death. He is the tree of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The tree of knowledge was the tree of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the more knowledge we get, the more death we encounter. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And so this is the conversation with our first parents who had eternal life and was given the tree of life to eat from. And they're visited by uh this serpent who has the voice and is the instrument through the voice for the voice of a fallen archangel. Have we followed thus far? And here is the conversation in brief. Genesis 3:1. You won't have to look. Just listen. And the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field. And he said, &gt;&gt; this is abbreviated now. And he said to the woman, "Hath God said?" And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of every tree of the garden of the trees of the garden." And the serpent said unto the woman, "You shall not surely die." That's why the Apostle Paul, the first church age messenger, &gt;&gt; had to establish &gt;&gt; the Lord himself, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; shall descend from heaven with a shout &gt;&gt; and with a voice and with a trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they heard the voice, verse 8, and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. I'm going to speak to you on the voice of the archangel as a title and a subject is turning over every stone. We've had many people here and I have not I don't believe I've said it publicly but when we've had people come for prayer that have serious situations very serious in the last few days I used it I even sent it overseas because we've been praying for sister Lady Koulen Brunner in Switzerland and she is a wife of brother Daniel who is one of the main brothers. He works with brother David Mayor in getting the conventions together over there and they've had the burden and the vision for it and his wife young wife they have one child and she has come down with uh and has been attacked over a period of time over a period of actually a few years but she came with such excruciating pain they thought it was in her back and so on they're not and the doctors can't find out what's wrong but she was actually losing body mass and could hardly walk in the last few days. And uh different ones entered into prayer as we did as well. I heard this morning that she uh the pain had subsided and we're thankful for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But uh but what I I I sent a message to them whenever I have a serious situation or one myself which I have I take the message be certain of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says in there, and I'll give the quote a little later on, he said that how many times that he himself &gt;&gt; has turned over every stone. &gt;&gt; And when you have turned over every stone and gone over and and then if something is you find something that is you're questioning, it may not be exactly right. He said, then he would repent over it and and make it right and whatever more. He says, "And then if God still remains silent, then you have to be certain of God." &gt;&gt; And so now in this account that we have here, I hope you're able to follow with me. Now we have the first sin taking place. And now we have the turning over every stone. And God is prompting it. And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, "Where are you? And he said, "I heard I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself." And he said, "God speaking, who told you you were naked?" &gt;&gt; He wasn't naked, &gt;&gt; but they I when I Excuse me. He was naked, but he was veiled. They were veiled. You understand? And that's what he want to know. Who told you that? &gt;&gt; That you were naked. &gt;&gt; And uh and uh and he said, "Have you eaten of the tree? Have you partaken of this?" And the man said, "Well, the woman gave it to me." They're turning over every stone. The woman gave me it and uh and gave me the tree, and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the woman, "What is this that thou hast done? It's not ever, you know, what you thought. What is this that thou has done?" And the woman said, "The serpent beguiled me." And I did eat. And so that's how they began to turn every stone to find out where the source of things were, &gt;&gt; where the problem is. Brother Brandham said when people came up before him, he said, "Now if you have any sin," he said, "don't don't come if you have any sin you're hiding because because this will uncover it. Satan came to Eve and began to reason against the word of God." That's one statement brother Brandham makes. He said again, "Satan told Eve enough to be deceitful. He told her the truth, but not all the truth &gt;&gt; in true vine and false vine. He said the biggest lie that was ever told is one that's got a whole lot of truth in it. &gt;&gt; Now, the biggest lie was ever told was what Satan told Eve &gt;&gt; in the way of a true prophet. He said Eve began to reason and Satan said like this. Now he's going back in the conversation. Now he said, "Now you don't you don't know because you haven't had any schooling yet. I'm a professor of the seminary over here." And I tell you, we've learned some things out there. We've learned that God is so good. We've learned in our seminary that God is so good. He doesn't expect you to do all that he wrote here. He doesn't expect that. &gt;&gt; And then in 27, Genesis 2:7 says, "For in the day that thou eateest thereof," this is what God had told them, "for in the day that thou eateest thereof, thou shalt surely die." And now we take a step. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise. &gt;&gt; No, I've just given you this for a bit of a a bit of a basis in the rapture message. And you must remember the rapture message is right now at the end of 33 years of ministry. Getting a people, calling out a people. Do you believe that that was sent to call out a people &gt;&gt; now? He's telling a group. He's telling that group of people which I believe that we are part of that. &gt;&gt; And in the rapture message, this is the first time that he takes it just like this. He said three things happens. A shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus notice now before Jesus appears. And he said Jesus does all three of them &gt;&gt; when he's descending. &gt;&gt; So I just want to say amen to all of those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to figure it out, but just say amen to it. &gt;&gt; A shout. He said, what is a shout? It's a message going forth. That's the shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Already happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said uh the shout it's a message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride that will produce a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now brother Brandham could have said that maybe nothing would have happened. &gt;&gt; There'd be no call. There'd be no people come out. There'd be no people that would be gripped &gt;&gt; as as the believers. I'm talking about believers of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about some of this limp nonsense that goes on. I'm talking about people that are fervent committed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it has done something for them. &gt;&gt; And even though even though they might at some time say this is too hard, we just heard of the song of the breaking. Sometime you think I can't go any further, but you do. &gt;&gt; I can't bear another thing. But you do. I ought to just give this up. But you can't. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; No way. &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? &gt;&gt; For thou hast the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Where would a person go? &gt;&gt; And even when everything fell apart for the disciples, everything fell apart for the disciples. Their leader was gone. The leader was dead. He was in a tomb. uh the great apostles that were with them and participated in the miracles, they were all hiding and secretary of the church had committed suicide and everything. The whole country was just uh while there were mobs that were coming for healing, now there's mobs that are crying for his blood and his death. And you couldn't find a more dismal situation than that. But he said, could they go back to their old synagogue and the old formal thing and the old dead thing? They couldn't go back. There's no place to go. &gt;&gt; I would ask you, where will you go? &gt;&gt; Where would you go? Jesus even invited them to go. &gt;&gt; He even said to his leaders, "Will you leave? &gt;&gt; Where will you go, Brother &gt;&gt; John? Brother Tom, where where will you go? Where we go? can't go from where we come out of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he said so the and the second is a voice of the resurrection. He comes with a shout &gt;&gt; and with a voice and with a trumpet doesn't say that he is the voice even though that he is. You have to understand what I'm saying. He's more than just the voice. &gt;&gt; He's also the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the resurrection." But kind of how do you relate that he he's a person &gt;&gt; at that point? He's a person. &gt;&gt; And we know that he's actually God. He came out from God. God can be whatever form he desires to present himself in. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So the second is the voice of the resurrection. the same voice and I've spoken over many many months now and God said some of the first verse first three verses in the Bible and God said what did he say &gt;&gt; what did anybody hear and people today trying to sort out you know this little technicality and that little you'll never figure God out the further you go the more ignorant you show yourself as being a little teaspoon of ashes up here trying to figure out these things. &gt;&gt; This is eternal God. &gt;&gt; If God wants to, he could just have another universe. And maybe he has. I don't know. &gt;&gt; Who are we? &gt;&gt; Who are we? Little specks on a little globe. It's even a marvel that God even found us in this great expansive universe of his creation. But not only did he find us, this was the place he selected as a a womb for his seed. And that's why Satan came here because this was the this was the uh result of the spoken word. He's always lusted and hungered after that spoken word. Wherever that spoken word is, that's where you'll find him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so the second thing is the voice of the resurrection. the same voice &gt;&gt; uh the loud voice that called Lazarus from the grave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same voice. &gt;&gt; And the third, he says, "Now the third is the trumpet, which always is the feast of the trumpets is calling the people to the feast. And that'll be the bride's supper, the lamb's supper with the bride in the sky." The first thing comes forth is this message calling the bride together. I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you folks, but I'm on my way to a supper. &gt;&gt; You're on your way to a supper. &gt;&gt; You're not just here to attend church. &gt;&gt; We're on our way out of here. &gt;&gt; This world is a a chaotic mess. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the first thing comes forth is a message calling the bride together. The next is a resurrection. The sleeping of the sleeping bride, the ones died back in other ages and they're caught together and the trumpet, the feast of in the heavens in the sky. Why? Uh that's the thing that takes place, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a maybe four or five more, six hours for him to speak and then his lips will be sealed. &gt;&gt; So the message is turning over every stone in Satan's Eden. God himself came down with his voice in his Eden and turned over every stone until he traced it down and find out who's responsible for this. &gt;&gt; Are you responsible, Adam? Well, woman, you gave me, she gave it to me. Are are you responsible that serpent gave it to me? Okay. Does God just drop it there? No. Then he goes to the serpent. So he said, "Oh, you're the respon responsible." And then he prophesies. &gt;&gt; I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and the woman's seed. Anybody that discusses serpent seed to you, just take him to that scripture and say, "When you tell me what that is, then I'll I can talk to you further." Not until then. And this is God Almighty himself talking to the serpent, &gt;&gt; which he's not talking to a snake in a tree. Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; He's talking to an intelligent being that even knew his word. Did God say this? &gt;&gt; The one that knew enough to question it and sew a seed of doubt. And so now in the in this time, in this end time, I'm I'm making statements going to you're going to have to think about it. This message really is uh turning over every stone in Satan's Aiden. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see this great degradation taking place and immorality taking place through the voice &gt;&gt; coming and asking the question and being direct in this time. Where'd that come from? &gt;&gt; And they turn it over and turn another one over. Well, I got it here. This what my this is what my preacher says. This is what the priest says. This is what someone else says. You have a prophet come says it come right out of where they got taught. &gt;&gt; There are seminaries &gt;&gt; and all of that theology &gt;&gt; and all this ecumenical movement &gt;&gt; and all this uniting together is only depicting the weaknesses. And you can't take a whole bunch of weaknesses together and make a strength. &gt;&gt; It only gets more weak, &gt;&gt; more evil. And the scripture says, "And things shall wax worse and worse." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is this all right, friends? &gt;&gt; So I had to think about this. So obviously you will. So when the Michael when the war that took place in heaven and and uh Lucifer is cast out, I've been pondering this. I said, and I have it here in my notes, Lucifer's office was left vacant. He's not there anymore, but he's here. So he lost his position, but he didn't lose his power to deceive &gt;&gt; because he carried on with that right away. &gt;&gt; His his his fallen nature or whatever. And I cannot explain all those things, but he set about to what what he was doing what he was doing and the battle he was doing there and deceiving angels and and bringing them down and casting them them following him or them being cast out with him. Then he com he continues with this same program. &gt;&gt; And he's been quite successful &gt;&gt; not some little wimp &gt;&gt; and people make a make some joke, you know, with a fork and a and cloven hoofs and a tail. Forget it. &gt;&gt; He has permeated every area. of your life. &gt;&gt; You got money in your pocket. He's in the economy. &gt;&gt; He's in the industry. He's in the economics. &gt;&gt; You have an ID card in your pocket. He's in the politics. &gt;&gt; We all have to have education. And he's in that system. &gt;&gt; And you may be quiet now, but you'll probably get quieter before I'm done. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to have to have a sword, a word that can divide between. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Between the word. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of the joints and marrow and of the uh of the soul and the spirit. &gt;&gt; So many times we said not the body and the spirit, but the soul and the spirit. Your soul was made to receive the engrafted word of God. &gt;&gt; But the system that's out here wants to permeate and wants to uh wants to homogenize your life until you can't find that dividing line. But listen now, I'm going to make a statement. Only believers of the revealed word of God know where that line is. &gt;&gt; And they've got a six sense that tells them thus far, no further. I will use you, but you will not use me. &gt;&gt; I am in the world, but I'm not of the world. &gt;&gt; I'm here. I'm getting an education. I'm getting a living. I'm working. I've I'm I'm in business. I'm in this. I'm in that. But I will remain by the Holy Spirit the master of my life, of my home, of my children. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many years ago &gt;&gt; the school system right here in this in this area sent word that that uh my daughters had to participate in dancing because they have now made dancing part of the curriculum and they sent word because they knew that my position on it. They sent word and said and this will form part of their um part of their marks. So if they're not in it, they're not going to get the marks. And I said, I I wrote a letter. I sent it to teachers. I sent it to the inspector. And I sent it to about eight ministers in this area. Not one minister wrote back. And I said, finally, I was exasperated. I said, who is playing the music for the dance? The Pentecostal pastor's children. because he didn't want them participating, but they were playing the music &gt;&gt; at the music. I'm not degrading him. I'm just saying that's what was happening. &gt;&gt; And so I said, I wrote a very stern letter and I said, you are responsible to teach my children what they need to know with regards to the basics of human life, reading and the writing and the arithmetic. But I and my wife are responsible for their social life and we will keep that to ourselves. &gt;&gt; You have nothing to do with their social life. &gt;&gt; And so they simply told the teacher, we can't participate. And so the teacher said, "There are those of you that are cannot participate and so you can go and and and bounce a volleyball or something up on the plat on on the stage and the rest of them in the gym were going to do this." Well, guess what? A whole bunch of the young guys, all the young fellas, they all went up there. They would sooner bounce the ball and do all this stupid dancing stuff. And he said, and and the and the instructor teacher said, "No, no, no." He says, "Come on back." He says, "I know that you can." No, they didn't want to. The whole thing, the whole thing absolutely collapsed in three weeks. It was all over. I say, listen, friends, God God knows where the line is. You know where the line is. You've got something within you that witnesses that. We need to listen to that voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in Acts, I said now the the archangel's office of Lucifer apparently was left vacant. Uh but he carried on with his thing. Listen to this. In Acts, there's another one whose office was left vacant and his name was Judas. &gt;&gt; And this is what happened there. That he may take part of this ministry. So they're selecting another person or drawing lots. The the apostles are that he may take part of this ministry and apostilhip from which Judas by transgression fell. &gt;&gt; So did so did Lucifer fall &gt;&gt; by transgression and which Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place. And they gave forth their lots and the lot fell to Mattheus and he was numbered with the 11 apostles. And we know that the prophet comes in this day and says that was their choice. But God's choice was Apostle Paul. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And Matthews didn't write the scriptures, but Apostle Paul wrote most of the New Testament. &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks in Jude and says, "Yet Michael the Archangel," and that's only the second time in the Bible that the word appears. at Michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses and durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee &gt;&gt; and uh in the revelation series they said the voice that summoned John to come up &gt;&gt; the same voice that said to John come up is the same voice that summons the church someday summons the church come up. &gt;&gt; Also, the same voice that summoned John to come up is the same voice that summoned the dead Lazarus out of the grave. The same voice of the archangel. Jesus of Nazarus isn't going to stand here and say, "Let all the dead in Christ rise." It's a voice. It's a It's It's a voice that God sends. And then there comes a junction of time &gt;&gt; where where the word that's been spoken &gt;&gt; and it's been declared. God doesn't have to come back and say it or make a sound again. It's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; The thus sayeth the Lord has been spoken and he descends. He descends with a shout. &gt;&gt; And the shout it wasn't him in the skies. It was a It was a messenger, an angel on earth &gt;&gt; that was speaking the word and saying, "Thus sayaith the Lord." [Music] &gt;&gt; There's a pillar of fire between I and the person, &gt;&gt; and I'm speaking through that pillar of fire. I tell you what, friends, there isn't another living person that's had that kind of indication. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I say, thanks be to God, &gt;&gt; we have that kind of indication. Aren't you happy for that? [Applause] &gt;&gt; The same kind of voice that summoned Lazarus out of the grave and the same voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ is the voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Christ is the voice of the archangel. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Voice of the archangel. He says, "Oh, the trumpet voice of Christ summoned John to come up and the same voice summoned Lazarus." &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks in Jeremiah. Now, ju just to digress for a moment, but we'll follow along on exactly the same. And it said through Jeremiah 29:10, he said, "For thus sayith the Lord, that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end." And then then shall you call upon me, &gt;&gt; and you shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. Isn't that incredible? And you shall pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and you shall seek me and find me when you shall search with me for me with all of your heart. And that is the very words that gave rise to this entire message. I wanted to know who is God searching for &gt;&gt; and who are we and what are we searching for and I thought of you young people and the graduation and and uh now more responsibility falling upon your life what what what uh profession or what direction should I go uh where am I headed and you've got decisions and weighty things upon your mind &gt;&gt; and some of you are even now searching And I want to admonish all that hear me within the congregation and now all that are streaming and will ever hear. We need to go on a massive search &gt;&gt; to search out everything that God has spoken about our eternal home &gt;&gt; and our eternal life. &gt;&gt; We need to search that much more than what we're searching just for our natural things. how we how we put so much effort &gt;&gt; in seeking out every last thing of a human life. But we need to search out &gt;&gt; these spiritual things. &gt;&gt; I have been uh I've been blessed lately because I've been in the message for so many years and in the scriptures and when I sit down and study it just comes from so many directions because I've become familiar with it. And you might say, "Well, they you're a minister." Anybody &gt;&gt; can become I've talked to women and all they've done, they've just heard the messages and heard the tapes and and they just uh they just open their mouth and it just comes out from every direction. I've always admired that. &gt;&gt; And I think that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And we need to seek out &gt;&gt; the little things that God has said &gt;&gt; and my prophet calls them nuggets. Amen. &gt;&gt; I read of a man. I heard of him at first on the news and I looked it up a wee bit the other day. A man his by the name of Forest Fan. He was dying with cancer. This is very recently. He was dying with cancer and decided to hide a fortune. It's in excess of million dollars. some things that may be two million in gold and treasures in the mountains just out of Santa Fe, New Mexico. And he's announced it all over. It's been on CNN and everywhere. And uh and then he wrote a book. He wrote a book with the clues of where it is. Everybody wants that book. And they're not just reading like a newspaper. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, they're not reading like a newspaper. They're searching every possible word. &gt;&gt; I was talking to brother Mark Matul. He won't mind me mentioning his name. And they're streaming the service this morning because we're out of the camp actually. So we say, "God bless you, brother Mark, and for telling me this." He didn't know that I might use this, but he said that we were talking about a certain situation, a certain thing. He said that he had done he had taken because, you know, he's been in the police force. He said we were I took a course. He said a very intense course. and he said this course was actually written by a man from a Jewish background and he's a he's an absolute considered I think like a world authority on interrogation and he said this man said and brother brother brother Mark was so locked into what this man had said and so on so forth I think he probably didn't weren't catching right at then at that moment that that was almost word for word what Brother Brandham said at the beginning, he said, "This man has said man was not made to lie." And he said because he's not constructed to lie. Brother Brandham said, "Man was not made to lie." And he says the lie detection equipment, a lie detector will prove that because you can have and you can get your alibi absolutely flawless and you can speak with such confidence. But that that vibration will show there. It will show that you're not speaking the truth when you answer a certain question. This man had a just a little different. He said man was not made to lie. And he says and that will show up. He said it it comes down and registers and out of his mouth comes the words and it comes into the vocabulary and and at a certain point in interrogation. He will give a clue and it's up to the interrogator to find out what word was used that actually was the key to the deception. And uh that wasn't the end of the story. He apparently got a message. Brother brother Mark was taking this course and he took a certain instance, a certain happening that took place and he said he he he put that in a in a section by itself. And he said, "This is an account of of of this whole program on a certain case. And if you can determine there's one word in here that is the key to the deception and shows that it was not correct." And he said, "If you can find it, I will give you a very special gift." And brother Mark said that he I said, 'Well, what happened?' He said, 'Well, I I just poured over it and I studied it. He says, ' And I found the word. You did? I He said, "Yeah, I found the word." And I went back to him. I said, he said, "I I found the word. I'm sure I found the word." And the word was and a N d. And they connected two things. He connected two things together and it didn't quite register. And so he said to this professor or this instructor, he said, "The word and." He said, "You're correct. That is the word." He says, "Well, what kind of a prize do I get?" And he gave him a a large postcard about like this. He didn't know I was going to say all this, and I didn't expect to say it all either, but I gave him a large postcard. And on the postcard is a drawing of a a room. All a drawing. He said, "A few years ago," this man said, "A few years ago, a Soviet uh Russian jet pilot flew one of their latest jets into Iran." And how many have heard about it? Yeah, I see. I heard about it. and he said he flew it into Iran and uh I think maybe sought asylum or whatever more I don't know but the whole thing I remember it it was a huge international kurfuffle and I didn't know what the result of it was but the result was I think that the US allowed them to take the pilot back and maybe kept the plane I do not know but I know this that he they interrogated him in a KGB B interrogation room. And he said while he was being interrogated, he drew the room. And he said, "This is the first picture of the inside of a KGB investigation room where he was being interrogated." He says, "I'm giving it to you." So, so he got that that is his prize. But I thought of this uh Mr. fan. Do you do you mind me taking being myself a little bit? &gt;&gt; I thought of this Mr. Fan here. And so he wrote a book of his memoirs. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the key to where the treasure was was in there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they haven't found it yet, but they're scouring and all kinds of people are going trying to find this uh treasure of a million dollars. Can you imagine what they're going to? And people that go out in the ocean and track and measure things and try to find the location of old wrecks so they can find some sunken treasure. &gt;&gt; We have hidden treasure. [Applause] [Music] If there was a drugstore, the prophet said, if there's a pharmacy down the street that said, "We have an injection that will give you eternal life." &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's enough ignorant people that would line up. &gt;&gt; Thinking it might be, what do you got to lose? &gt;&gt; And it'll be people. And now God in his extended mercy, listen to me folks, God in his mercy and extended grace said, "I'll do it again. I'll do exactly what was happened in the life of Jesus Christ. I'll do it again. I'll do it. It'll it'll follow the same pattern. I'll take a man that has no history of education. I'll take a man out of poverty. I'll take a man that you never heard about &gt;&gt; and I'll just begin to endow him with supernatural power and wisdom of things and he'll speak about the heavens and speak about and speak to the storm and and cause the sea to become quiet and all these things you have that I told you &gt;&gt; a few weeks ago &gt;&gt; holding it in my heart for 50 I told you I saw a storm in four days in that storm stom four days locked in the tent. &gt;&gt; Four days of just saturated and and and God dealt with it. And the prophet said, "It's over." &gt;&gt; I would not be behind this pulpit this morning &gt;&gt; if that wasn't over. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's over and we'll ride out of here dry." &gt;&gt; And I'm here as a testimony today to say that happened &gt;&gt; in my lifetime. And I saw the sky turn absolutely blue. &gt;&gt; I took off my rainwear. I took off my other garments and rode out in my shirt sleeves because it was actually hot. &gt;&gt; Friends, I tell you what, God has gone beyond measure &gt;&gt; to confirm to us &gt;&gt; this is the hour. &gt;&gt; There's never been a day like this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And Mr. Finn afterwards found himself cancer free. &gt;&gt; But he didn't take it all back. But he wrote his memoirs and said it's there. And we have we have we have not only God's memoirs, but we've got God's word. &gt;&gt; There's two aspects to a search. And uh in Jeremiah which I read, he said, "And you shall seek me, and you'll find me when you seek for me with all of your heart." &gt;&gt; And that search is to to seek with care. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not listening to a tape for background music. &gt;&gt; That's why I've always been against that. I think we ought to listen to it prayerfully. &gt;&gt; We ought to read the word and put ourselves in the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; I would urge you to do that. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a search. &gt;&gt; It shouldn't be this quiet. &gt;&gt; Search &gt;&gt; to inquire. &gt;&gt; And also, if you're searching, if you lost something, one thing that you'll do, you'll go back over the same ground, &gt;&gt; the same territory, &gt;&gt; and you'll frequent it again and again. You see the law enforcement and the police department when there's been some heinous heinous crime, they go back and forth. They pour over and they'll pick up the least little clue. &gt;&gt; And the prophet starts speaking about son of man, son of David, son of God. And you know what he calls it? These nuggets. &gt;&gt; I wonder if you found out it was a nugget. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And some people look at something, they don't realize what's worth. &gt;&gt; They don't realize it. &gt;&gt; You may not even realize the value of this message. &gt;&gt; You may not realize the value of the quotes that I'm coming to or the scripture or the or the continuity of them. &gt;&gt; So, we search it and we seek God in prayer. We practice and study it. and seek God also with application. It's not just head knowledge. &gt;&gt; I just read I just read when I was coming home from Russia and they were concerned about the incredible number of young people between 18 and 25 that don't have work in the world. It was news, major news on the Canadian news broadcasting system this last week. 12.6% of the of the population is without employment. And this is a youth that are unemployed. And they said that the entire population of America now about 350 million people in the age of 18 to 25 that number of people are without work in the world. And it's having a shift in the demographics of the of the world and it's it's it's it has a ripple effect of problems and the professor or whoever was speaking and writing this article it's in the economist magazine I believe or the Herald Tribune from Paris and they were saying this is a massive massive problem and it it brings a delusion not a delusion but a disheartenment to the to the people. And I said we have to find some way to close the gap between the world of education and the world of work. &gt;&gt; Huge gap between the two. &gt;&gt; Because a person can become so educated. This is where a believer has to draw the line &gt;&gt; and know how far &gt;&gt; and for what is the purpose. &gt;&gt; My purpose is to live godly to be an example there. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And my first purpose is that I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach it. &gt;&gt; And I would say to the young ladies, &gt;&gt; if you go for further education because you haven't got anything to do now, go for further education. You should make absolutely certain that it's something that will add to motherhood. &gt;&gt; Hello. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to learn philosophy and and do what? I'm going to go into the sciences. Well, I'd help you raise your children. &gt;&gt; The great Apostle Paul says, "I would that the younger women marry." &gt;&gt; And bear children &gt;&gt; Well, it's not popular maybe anymore. We're not we're not talking about what's popular. &gt;&gt; We're talking about what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; And God has hidden his treasures &gt;&gt; in his word. &gt;&gt; And they're there, but Satan has come along and said, "Well, that's not really the end thing to do. We're not into the end thing. &gt;&gt; We're into the eternal thing." And then there's the other side of searching and that is search me oh God. &gt;&gt; King David said and know my heart. Obviously there were some things that he perhaps didn't fully understand. Know me and know my heart and try me and know my thoughts. &gt;&gt; And that was a that was a different different meaning. examine me thoroughly and search me out and to be ascertained. You know, I've I've used it here over the pulpit because the Bible says, "And and God did tempt Abraham." He didn't tempt him with evil. He assayed him as you do with a mining ore. And you grind it until it's fine powder. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, your song broken. Not just broken, ground down. It says that our Lord Jesus Christ, this this uh wheat of life, &gt;&gt; this grain of wheat &gt;&gt; was ground until it became fine powder &gt;&gt; to make the loaf &gt;&gt; a bread &gt;&gt; for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was acquainted with grief. &gt;&gt; He didn't visit. He wasn't visited with grief. He was acquainted with grief &gt;&gt; and acquainted with disappointments and suffering &gt;&gt; and we hid as it were our faces from him. &gt;&gt; He was despised and rejected of men. &gt;&gt; You want him to be your Lord? I do. &gt;&gt; I do indeed. And David said, "Search me." Apostle Peter said, "Beloved, think not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened to you." When brother Brandham talked about turning over every stone and be certain of God, just let me just quickly read this because I have so much more I have to get on to here very quickly. He says, he says, when we've confessed all of our sin and we've met every requirement that God requires, we believed on God, there's a circumstance has to be met and it's according to his will and we've confessed our sin and we've made all we've made all the wrongs that we have did right and done everything that we know how to do. every requirement that God had made or asked, we have met that requirement. And yet he lays silent. He just won't answer. &gt;&gt; And he goes on, he says, I'm sure that I'm speaking to peoples this morning who have come to that place. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, I've been there many times myself. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; I've been there many times myself. He said, "When I've went back and traced my life," and this is the only place I find this phrase that came my subject this morning and turned over every stone and I'd find that I did something wrong and I'd go and confess it and say, "Lord God, I'll make it right." And do so and then come back again and say, "Now, Lord, thou art God, you'll answer me. Surely I've met every request that I that you've required me to do and every requirement I've met it and still he won't move. &gt;&gt; Seems to set silent. That's when you've got to be sure that he is God &gt;&gt; and don't be discouraged. &gt;&gt; The only thing is that in your heart be certain of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I thought that is so encouraging. friends, when I had a slip disc in my neck that went against the spinal cord and the doctor said, "We'll get your bed as quick as possible and sign this piece of paper, put it off me sign to relieve them of any responsibility because it's a dangerous thing touching the spinal cord." And I said, I walked out of his office. I said, "Is there any possibility that it no?" He said, "There's no possibility that improve." He said, "I have to go in here and take bone from your hip or bone from a cow and fuse those together and suck the disc out that's pressing against the cord." And he said, "That's the only way." And I was walking. I had to have my arm up over my head. I walk into the car and I got in the car and now here starts my search. I said, "Take me to the church." I came and stood right here. And I had the three brothers that were here come and and stand with me. And I said, I'm following I'm following exactly what I say to people when they are in desperation. Follow the scriptures to the letter. And the scripture says, "Is any afflicted, let him pray." &gt;&gt; I want to say that to the congregation. When you get afflicted, you pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't call on somebody else. Don't get on the telephone. Don't get on Facebook and some other nonsense. You pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is any sick among you? Let him call. &gt;&gt; That's the clues &gt;&gt; to the treasure. &gt;&gt; And I said to the three brothers, I have not asked you to come here to pray for me. &gt;&gt; I said, I want to follow the scripture to the letter. I have come here to pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I ask you to pray with me. &gt;&gt; I said, "I'm not sick. I'm terribly afflicted." &gt;&gt; And I knelt and prayed. Nothing happened. I lost 10 pounds in the next two weeks. I went back to the same doctor. I said, "We're here. I'm here for the operation." He said, "But how are you?" I said, "I lost 10bs in the last two weeks if that means anything." But he says, "But you're you well," he says, "Come in the next room." and he began to examine me. He said, "But you're no worse." I said, "Dr. Chan, Dr. Richard Chan at Colombian Royal Colombian Hospital, one of three specialists." I said, "I've come here for the operation." But he said, "But you're no worse." I said, "But I'm no better." And I was just testing it because the Lord had already told me and a voice speaking through my own voice. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said, "If thou wilt, thou can make me whole." And he said, "Through me, I will &gt;&gt; be thou whole." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I stood here behind this pulpit and spoke to this congregation said, "Not better, not improved, but whole." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to know I stand here today 16 years later, &gt;&gt; having never had a doctor touch that &gt;&gt; that boy. I go hunting with my son-in-laws. I go riding the quad and I'm absolutely free. And they tell me three of my discs have three of my vertebrae have no discs between them. I don't know. I don't understand it. But I know that my author, author of life, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; has sent a word. &gt;&gt; I don't have anywhere else to turn. &gt;&gt; I'm not against doctors. I go to them frequently. Not infrequently, but I go to them, take their advice. But all then there's a time when a man can only go so far, my prophet said, and that's when God starts. That's where he begins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when this life is fading away and man can do nothing for you and your loved ones can do nothing for you, there's another one, the author of eternal life. Hallelujah. He's already spoken the word of the resurrection. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've received that word. &gt;&gt; You've received that word of the resurrection which is beyond this life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for getting excited, but this this is worth being excited. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us of another search that went on. Abraham I I'm not near over. I'll have to probably take another service. But Abraham looked for a city. &gt;&gt; And how he looked for a city. &gt;&gt; He never occupied it. Friends, &gt;&gt; I want you to really stick this down your heart. He never occupied it, but he continued to look for it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, I won't read it all, but the prophet said he looked for it because he had met the king of that city. He met Melzdc. He said, "I know that city is some place. &gt;&gt; I know heaven is some place. &gt;&gt; I don't know exactly where, but I know it's some place. &gt;&gt; He told me about it. &gt;&gt; And I also met the king of that city. &gt;&gt; I met the king. &gt;&gt; I've heard him speak. &gt;&gt; I've heard him speak. I've heard his voice. &gt;&gt; And I can never deny it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Abraham, father Abraham, &gt;&gt; I too follow in the footsteps of faith. &gt;&gt; I look for the same city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I say, I'll meet you in that city. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; That one single encounter, &gt;&gt; we say, "Oh God, we need you every day. We need you to meet us. We need you to bless. We need you to speak. No, that one encounter Abraham encountered Melchisedc once &gt;&gt; and that put him in such expectation he never deterred from his direction. [Music] &gt;&gt; God give us children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; He searched for this city and remained faithful to the vision &gt;&gt; even though he did not occupy it. Then I hope you're not too weary. &gt;&gt; Then our Lord Jesus said to leaders and men who ought to have known better, I'm saying to you and you young people, I address you because you've got minds that are far beyond mine. You want to really absorb this and your use of studies and your used uh accustomed to retention. you retain these things. Jesus said, "Search the scriptures." &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal life. &gt;&gt; It's almost reading their minds if you want to put it that way. They were they go to the synagogue like we're sitting in church. You have eternal life. Oh yeah, I have eternal life. He said, "Search the scriptures &gt;&gt; because they are the ones that testify of me. They're the ones that tell me tell you that I'll be here at this time. &gt;&gt; Friends, I don't want to lay any heavies, but those those of you that are seated here in this congregation and those that are on the internet that don't really have a real good solid clue of what the prophet of God, God said, I'll send Elijah the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll send you &gt;&gt; Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he'll turn your heart &gt;&gt; back to the faith of the fathers. &gt;&gt; And if you say today, I need to have my faith turned back to the faith of the original fathers. &gt;&gt; Then the book is here. The memoirs are here. &gt;&gt; The history is here. &gt;&gt; The future is here. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God has come. And he said that in one of the last message I think it is things that are to be he said God has so spoken so clearly and and he says I've given you the places. I've given you the addresses. I've given you I've given you all the statistics. He told people where they were from. He told everything. Revealed the secret of their heart. He said God like God can do no more. And I want to say friends, if God could have sent something better, he would have. &gt;&gt; He has sent his best. &gt;&gt; He's already sent his best. &gt;&gt; He can do no more to get you to heaven than what he's already done. &gt;&gt; So search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have life. And it is in modern events made clear. And I'll read it for you. Remember he comes in three sons names. &gt;&gt; He came first in the name of the son of man. Never called himself the son of god. He acknowledged that of course but he says now he come after the day of pentecost came back in the form of the holy ghost supernatural spirit. Now he's the son of god &gt;&gt; in the millennium. He'll be son of David sitting upon the throne of David. &gt;&gt; He said he's come come son of god son of man son of David. Oh, the Bible is full of these nuggets. &gt;&gt; Do you sit here this morning and have not discovered that was a nugget? &gt;&gt; That's a greater treasure than if I gave you a a whole brick of gold. [Applause] for you to come to the realization &gt;&gt; God sent a son of man revealing Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and did all of these things that I can hear it I can read it I can assimilate it in my mind oh what a day I'm in [Music] &gt;&gt; he said, "Am not I tonight, just listen to this, please. Am not I tonight trying to tell you word by word, even to the position, the place, the names, &gt;&gt; the numbers, everything else, and all of the signs of times, and everything that were right here at the end time. That's what all of that signed was for. The sign of the Messiah, the sign of the resurrection that we're right here. &gt;&gt; He said, "Surely you can see what I'm talking about." &gt;&gt; He said, "Look, that's so plain. It should need no more identification." He said, &gt;&gt; when he was here on earth, he said, "Search the scriptures. &gt;&gt; In them you think you have eternal life." Amen. &gt;&gt; And there they testify &gt;&gt; of what I see. &gt;&gt; I hope you're able to follow me. &gt;&gt; Please, will you stay with me another few minutes? &gt;&gt; I have a I have a key thought, &gt;&gt; a key part of this message. But just before I do, God did a search also. &gt;&gt; He waited through a lot of mud and filth and dirt to find you. [Music] He waited through a lot of doctrine and teaching and nonsense &gt;&gt; to find us. &gt;&gt; Each one of us &gt;&gt; when I think of this, I would never known it without the message. And there's one sitting on the throne, the original life. Almighty God is taken back into his control, the ownership, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; of the earth, &gt;&gt; and all of his children. &gt;&gt; And he has the record of it &gt;&gt; in a book. This is a book of redemption. Let me tell you friends, you know exactly what I'm talking about when I say they're trying to conserve water. They're wanting to purify the earth. They're wanting to go green. What are they wanting to do? They're wanting to redeem the mess that has been accumulated. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot redeem the earth he polluted. &gt;&gt; This is the book of redemption. This is the one who created in the first place &gt;&gt; and he's the only one that knows how to renew it. &gt;&gt; And the pro and his prophet said he'll renew it by fire. &gt;&gt; Water wouldn't do it. He'll renew it by fire. &gt;&gt; And he'll even burn the heavens &gt;&gt; and all your war games and all of this filth and all this pornography. &gt;&gt; Don't let it worry you, friends. It's going to pass off the scene in a holy, holy fire of God. God's going to destroy it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they searched through heaven and found a savior. [Music] &gt;&gt; One of the services we arranged for brother Brandham, a native brother, got up and sang. He said it's the first time he sang and I'm going to let you hear him sing. One of the most beautiful voices. And this is what he said. This is what he sang. And the reason I have him sing it is because they searched through heaven &gt;&gt; and found one. &gt;&gt; Only one. No archangel, &gt;&gt; no saraphim, &gt;&gt; none of the ones that even stood in the presence of a holy God &gt;&gt; could take that book. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And a bleeding lamp. He said, "Where was he?" &gt;&gt; Came from the eternities. &gt;&gt; He'd been in battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wasn't in battle for himself. He was in battle for you and for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the song and you'll hear it. Oh, what a savior. These are his comments and give us plenty of volume, please. I'm a little bit stage right Mike right first time I ever saw sang a song to a big congregation but praise God he's within my soul &gt;&gt; and I know that I could stand up for him and say that I am saved &gt;&gt; praise the Lord I've been saved now for year, two months, 3 months. Praise the Lord. It's been a wonderful, &gt;&gt; wonderful servant him. I'm going to sing. What a taste you are. [Music] One star was straight [Music] in dark. No hope within. [Music] They searched through heaven and they found a sing God. He save the soul like heal. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior. Oh hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; In his heart was broken. [Music] His hands were nail [Music] he for me. He left the father with all his rich tears. With calmness sweetness [Music] came down from heaven and gave his life to still last. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, what a savior. Oh, hallelujah. His heart was broken. [Music] Unal. [Music] His hands were nailed. He sat with him. [Music] He gave his last love for me. Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; Yet we walking out to the crushing [Music] his hands will lead me. for I'll join the chorus in that city and sing after [Music] more. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior we are. Hallelujah. He was strong. [Music] He has forg. Because he died for He's [Music] over again, please. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a savior. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] His hands were broken and [Music] his hands were never heavily [Music] for me. Brother Brandham walked out from behind just a little wall just came out this way. You could hear it if you hear the tape. He said wouldn't be much of a preacher if you couldn't preach after that. He told me it was the best meeting he'd had in that whole series coming up the coast from California, Oregon, Washington, then amongst the native people. I want to conclude by and it won't be a down. It's rather an upside of this service. Are you ready? Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says first Peter, Peter's recording it, of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the ga grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify &gt;&gt; when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, as he was just moving up to his sufferings just before the cross, just moving up to his sufferings, this was written just after just moving up to his sufferings. He said, "Father, glorify thyself." Then came there a voice from heaven and those that stood by said, "It thundered." And the prophet in the seals goes back to that scripture &gt;&gt; when in the revelation 10 there were thunders &gt;&gt; a voice like thunder &gt;&gt; and he he said he goes back to that he said see what the thunder is it's the voice of God &gt;&gt; this message &gt;&gt; came as a result of the voice of God it's not the voice of a man it's not the voice of an institution it's not the voice of a seminary it's the voice of God. &gt;&gt; And thus the Holy Spirit witnesses into your heart and your soul that this is not a man. &gt;&gt; This did not come from a book. &gt;&gt; This is the voice of God speaking &gt;&gt; and it comes like a thunder &gt;&gt; from God. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit in you is signifying &gt;&gt; and is signified. And the spirit of God that's in you is searching, &gt;&gt; scanning, scanning the horizon concerning what and what manner of time &gt;&gt; is this that this glory which should follow. &gt;&gt; For the bride, the woman is the glory of the man. The Holy Spirit is witnessing &gt;&gt; inside of us, searching out that this is the season of that scripture to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And it is being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It is being fulfilled. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Let us be awakened &gt;&gt; to this season that we're in. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophets prophesied of the grace that would come. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God that was in them spoke of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow. And through the inner vision by the Holy Spirit, the prophets saw something &gt;&gt; and they saw everything I would say from Adam, what Adam lost being restored back again. They said, uh, the spirit that's in us &gt;&gt; is witnessing that this is to be restored. &gt;&gt; And the prophets one after the other died and another one died. But they said the spirit that's in us is witnessing that this is to be restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, just pray that God give me a strengthened voice now. &gt;&gt; This is the crux of this message because it's coming home to your address. The thing that you have felt in your heart &gt;&gt; that you might feel call it exuberance or you might call it a positive feeling. It's none of that. It's way beyond that. It's the spirit of God testifying of the things that have been written concerning redemption in this book. It's testifying in this day that this is the hour when he will glorify himself again. God will glorify himself again &gt;&gt; in another age &gt;&gt; through another people &gt;&gt; and in the midst of Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; when everything imaginable is vile &gt;&gt; and wretched and demoralized and wicked and even the integrity of man has gone away in that hour I'll come back &gt;&gt; in that hour I'll speak again. &gt;&gt; In that hour it will not be a man's voice. It'll be my voice. &gt;&gt; And thus you have heard it. Said that's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; Not a man, folks. &gt;&gt; Not a man. &gt;&gt; I'm here telling you not a man. &gt;&gt; It's a voice. &gt;&gt; Hope you forgive me. That's the voice of the archangel, &gt;&gt; a major angel &gt;&gt; speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has not entrusted this message to any other voice. &gt;&gt; This voice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you are the privilege of the earth to have heard these things. &gt;&gt; You're the elected lady of Jesus Christ. And the spirit that's in you, even in the midst of your difficulties, in the midst of your failures, the spirit that's in you says, "This is the season. This is the time. And this is the message." Hallelujah. This is the resurrection hour. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; I won't send it again. I won't do it again. &gt;&gt; This is it. You won't hear it again. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; God's not sending another messenger. It's not another man that'll raise up. &gt;&gt; This is it. &gt;&gt; You got what you're going to get. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We better search it out &gt;&gt; and believe it &gt;&gt; with everything that is within us. &gt;&gt; Search it out. &gt;&gt; Find these nuggets that God has left. this great treasure &gt;&gt; that he's left. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think that those prophets, they must have seen and they couldn't have put it into words, but they it was witnessing to them of the glory. They must have saw the early church rise &gt;&gt; in the New Testament &gt;&gt; with the pure word of God. Oh, those prophets calling backsliden Israel to back into into line once again. They must have thought, "Oh, that'll be so glorious to live in that hour when when God &gt;&gt; when God, not only the spirit that's moving me, but when God will come into humans. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; I wish I could live to that hour." They would say, &gt;&gt; they saw the church rising. They saw it going in his tower. They saw the signs and the wonders and the miracles. Oh God, if we could live to that hour, but it was not for them. &gt;&gt; They had to go back out and face a backsliden people, &gt;&gt; hardened people who were refused to be moved by their by the word of God that was in them. &gt;&gt; They couldn't bring them to expectation. And Apostle Peter picks it up. the spirit that was in them. &gt;&gt; And I think that they saw prophet said the reason why the early church had healings, miracles, and visions and power is because the living word of God in the form of the lion of the tribe of Judah &gt;&gt; riding out to combat that &gt;&gt; to combat. &gt;&gt; I'll make an announcement. &gt;&gt; You have more than sufficient within you to combat that out there. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's SFU or a high school or some other damnable place. You have more than sufficient in you to withstand it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So in heaven, &gt;&gt; the angels call. They must have seen it. They must have seen the book &gt;&gt; in the hand of the original owner &gt;&gt; and the spirit that was in them saying there's one there's one that can take that book. &gt;&gt; No wonder no wonder a great angel of this hour. And don't misunderstand me. You will never put brother Brandham on a pedestal that God put him on. &gt;&gt; He gave him the leading position. And there was an angel in this hour. A strong angel. &gt;&gt; A strong angel in Revelation 5. He said, "Let him &gt;&gt; if he will, &gt;&gt; if he will, &gt;&gt; let him &gt;&gt; come now and take the book." And whether you want to believe it or not, he came &gt;&gt; and took the book &gt;&gt; and released the seals and opened the book &gt;&gt; and sent the word down &gt;&gt; to an angel &gt;&gt; and spoke the word. &gt;&gt; He said he will come &gt;&gt; with a shout. &gt;&gt; He will descend with the voice, &gt;&gt; not the voice. He imparts a voice to another. You better listen to me. The resurrection's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; That's the order of the rapture. &gt;&gt; The resurrection's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; All God has to do is just bring it to the crux of the crossing of the time. The timing &gt;&gt; the dead in Christ could be walking the streets before you get out of this meeting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you miss this, you'll miss that. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Don't miss what you're hearing now. &gt;&gt; Don't let it go over your head. &gt;&gt; Don't become dull and slow. &gt;&gt; Say, "This is for me. &gt;&gt; This belongs to me. &gt;&gt; This is mine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I won't let any man take my treasure. &gt;&gt; This is my treasure. &gt;&gt; Belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's yours, children. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; God can do nothing more. &gt;&gt; He'll give it to you &gt;&gt; with such liberality as he has. And the spirit that's in you is witnessing &gt;&gt; that what I'm saying is the truth. &gt;&gt; And what this message speaks is the truth. &gt;&gt; Even when you don't understand it, you agree with it and you say it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The prophet right in the bridge, he's coming to the fields. the opening of the seals and he's saying the call went out. &gt;&gt; The call went out. &gt;&gt; The call went out throughout heaven. &gt;&gt; Who's worthy? Who could tell us that? &gt;&gt; Who can tell us that but a prophet who can see into that realm &gt;&gt; and the call has gone out. Amen. &gt;&gt; If a man can stand here on earth, he can hear what doctors are saying a week ago &gt;&gt; or a month ago. &gt;&gt; He can hear what's going on in heaven. &gt;&gt; Said there's a call. &gt;&gt; A call has gone out for somebody who's worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Michael's standing there. Gabriel's standing there. No angel, &gt;&gt; no archangel, he said. &gt;&gt; But God himself, that which came out from his bosom &gt;&gt; and became the son of man, the son of God, &gt;&gt; he came said, "Give me the book. &gt;&gt; Give me the book." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I shed the blood. Give me the book. &gt;&gt; There's no other way. [Applause] I've paid for the book. &gt;&gt; I paid for the content. &gt;&gt; Listen. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to cut I'm going to shut it down in a few minutes, but I have much more to say &gt;&gt; next time. And you've read Revelation 10:1 many, many times. &gt;&gt; 1 through7. You've read it many, many times. I'd like to put some emphasis on it if you would please. &gt;&gt; Would you allow me to do that? &gt;&gt; This one that came and took the book. &gt;&gt; He says he could say, "I've been offered the world. &gt;&gt; I've been offered &gt;&gt; Satan came and tempted me. This same fallen archangel came to this one and tried to tempt me. &gt;&gt; And they showed me all the glories, &gt;&gt; all the philosophy, &gt;&gt; all the political power, &gt;&gt; all the superpower, &gt;&gt; all the political power, all the wealth. &gt;&gt; Think of it. All the enticements. He showed him everything. &gt;&gt; But he could not persuade him. &gt;&gt; And he only asked for one thing. Satan only asked for one thing. This fallen archangel only asked for one thing. Fall down &gt;&gt; and worship me &gt;&gt; and you'll have it all. &gt;&gt; Can you realize, friends, what that meant? He was willing to give up everything. All the glamour of Hollywood, &gt;&gt; all the beauty and fame of those people, all the stardom of all the sports and all the people and all of those who have won gold and silver and bronze at the World Olympics &gt;&gt; throughout the centuries. I'll give it all to you. I'll give you hundreds of millions and billions of people if you'll just fall down and worship me. &gt;&gt; If you can understand that or try to comprehend that, then you'll understand what was in his mind when he was in heaven &gt;&gt; and wanting say I'll ascend and I'll be like God. He wanted to be worshiped. And that is why the scripture tells us in revelation this dragon and the dragon is not some ugly dragon that you think of. The Bible tells us in the Greek language it is a fabulous beast. &gt;&gt; All of the glory and all the gold and all the artwork and all the attention and all the wealth of the world is found in her. Amen. &gt;&gt; The mother harlot &gt;&gt; and the mother of harlots. &gt;&gt; Those that have followed along have the same baptism, &gt;&gt; have the same understanding of the godhead. And the whole thing is pagan from beginning to end. &gt;&gt; Her holidays are pagan. &gt;&gt; Everything, even the dress, &gt;&gt; the dress code of the bishops and the popes and all of that is all pagan. &gt;&gt; Thank God for deliverance. I know what I'm talking about, friends. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. They tried to make me as a boy kiss the idols &gt;&gt; and something was in me telling me that is not right. I'm not kissing this piece of wood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They must have seen all of that. So, here we are. Now, follow me real close. And I saw another mighty angel &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven &gt;&gt; clothed with a cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a rainbow upon his head. Not a rainbow over his head, a rainbow upon his head. The rainbow is the covenant. &gt;&gt; This is what's in his mind. &gt;&gt; The covenant, &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; has come down that this enemy, this fallen archangel has tried to contaminate &gt;&gt; and tried to dilute, tried to adulterate and denominationalize. &gt;&gt; And now he's descending with a rainbow right upon his head. I'm coming to restore this. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it was Christ. &gt;&gt; And now listen. And the rainbows upon his head and his face was as it were the sun. &gt;&gt; Please stay with me. As it were the sun. And he said it's the same as in Revelation one. His sun shining in its strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that is a that is a symbol and a declaration of judgment. &gt;&gt; Now listen close. As it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. &gt;&gt; And in Revelation one as feet there were pillars of fire as burning and a brass there were brass &gt;&gt; burning and brass has always been judgment. The brass serpent &gt;&gt; uh on the pole in the wilderness. the sea of brass but became glass &gt;&gt; because it was judgment. &gt;&gt; All right, are you follow it close? And his feet now and his head as it were. The head is a word that is used in the phrases relating to capital and extreme punishment. Please follow this very closely. anything supreme, chief, prominent of persons, master, lord, of a husband in relations to his wife, of Christ, the Lord, of the husband and the church of things, and of the cornerstone. He's a cornerstone. Now, he's coming. He's coming with the word &gt;&gt; and with the with the symbols of extreme judgment &gt;&gt; for two reasons. So that the bride &gt;&gt; who has a messenger on earth, follow it close, &gt;&gt; could have that messenger declare, you never sinned in the first place. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he that is descending is coming with extreme judgment. &gt;&gt; Not on the individual, on he will turn over every stone &gt;&gt; and come to the beginning and say, "You serpent are the one. you Satan. And that is why the dragon, the old devil and and the Satan has cast into the lake of fire. He bundles them all together in the book of Revelation and destroys them because it's extreme judgment &gt;&gt; so that he can tell you, &gt;&gt; not a church member, &gt;&gt; but a part of the body of Jesus Christ. So to tell you, &gt;&gt; you're not responsible. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you repent, &gt;&gt; you're not responsible. &gt;&gt; The blood and he that's descended is the one who shed the supreme price. &gt;&gt; And the supreme price, oh God, give me your voice. The supreme price paid for the extreme judgment. Your sin &gt;&gt; has come under the extreme judgment &gt;&gt; of the judge himself, &gt;&gt; the worthy one, &gt;&gt; the wicked one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So he could say, "You're free. &gt;&gt; You're pure. &gt;&gt; You're without spot &gt;&gt; and without wrinkle &gt;&gt; or any such thing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And extreme judgment &gt;&gt; because just beyond &gt;&gt; just beyond &gt;&gt; is a lake of fire &gt;&gt; where he's going to be done with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The old devil, the serpent, &gt;&gt; that dragon, &gt;&gt; all of it and all that followed him &gt;&gt; going to become go into complete annihilation. &gt;&gt; And all I can say to you friends There's coming a time you'll never be troubled with it again. &gt;&gt; And never be troubled again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he took the complete and extreme death penalty for our son sin. Now, here's the one. And the dead in Christ shall rise &gt;&gt; at his very presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the supreme judge coming now to judge a godrejecting world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Warning, then judgment." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But but but but but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, that's why he had to send that seventh angel &gt;&gt; to let the people know this one is the one that's descending. &gt;&gt; That's why at the end of his ministry, he said he does all three when he's descending. Does all three of them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar. And when he cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. The open book. And even the voice that he cried is the result of a book that's open. &gt;&gt; If the book had not been open, he wouldn't have had anything to say. But now the book is open. He's got something to say. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice. &gt;&gt; And when he cried, seven thunders uttered the voices. And when the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write &gt;&gt; and a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up those things. Don't write them." &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; when he shall begin to sound, all the mystery of God will be made known. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, my time is gone. I'd like I'd like to have carried on. That which is in me, &gt;&gt; that spirit which is in me is testifying. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And urging to you, I'm not here to preach a sermon. That spirit that's in me is testifying. &gt;&gt; There will never be another message like this ever. &gt;&gt; There will never be vindication like this ever. So catch it. That vindication is such a treasure to you, friends. Such a treasure. &gt;&gt; Such a treasure. Amen. &gt;&gt; This might be a surprise to you, but I sat and had coffee with Brother Roger Smith yesterday. We spent about an hour together. We had a wonderful time. Just a wonderful time. And and he just said, "Well, let's go for coffee." We both arrived at the same place. He was just going out and I was just coming in. He said, "Let's just go and have coffee." I said, "Sounds good." We sat and talked and fellowship. He got talking about the opening of the word and he got talking the vindication. He says the vindication that's it. He says, you know, people try to belittle the vindication. Hey, I tell you what, I'm so thankful for every supernatural vindication. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That's the manifestation of this God that we love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I've got to stop her. I won't get stopped. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could sing uh let's sing a verse. They searched through heaven and found a savior. Would you sing it with me? &gt;&gt; And then we'll close it. It is.

And Lord, I trust every cup that's been present this morning is lifted up, filled, running down. We've heard your word and it's stirred deeply within our hearts this morning. &gt;&gt; What a voice we have received in this hour. What a voice, Lord. And there are men that you have raised up, Lord, that are sounding forth the same trumpet, an instrument of the voice. Lord, let that resurrection take place with amongst us, Lord. Father, that's our expectation. That has been our yearning. And Lord, as we've heard the word this morning, it's just brought it closer. Lord, the next hand we shake, the next meal we take, Lord, we're expecting at any moment a change within the atoms. And so, Lord, as we've heard the word and we've so reveled in it, we're so thankful for your servant, thankful for a man of God, Lord, that has yielded himself to you. I pray, God, that as we've taken deeply, we've drunk deeply of your word that we can truly say with thanksgiving in our hearts, it's good to been in the house of the Lord. So, Father, as we have tucked these nuggets, as we heard this morning, deep within our hearts, may we ponder them, may we revel in them, may we speak about them. May it not just be, Lord, a a service this morning and go out and forget what's spoken, but may there have been a great deposit of the Holy Ghost within the hearts of your children. That their hearts are also burning, Lord. that they could run six miles to proclaim the resurrection is on. May we run and hold this message dear. Lord, we're thankful again for the assembling of the saints, for each one that is here this morning. May they go with burning hearts. Thankful that you have done Lord a great thing within our lives this morning in Jesus' name. Amen. So I'm casting all my cares on you.

Tuck the word in your heart this morning. Don't let it go. Don't let the devil rob you when you go out these doors. You go over in your mind what those nuggets that God had deposited in your little strip bag and you start polishing them over lunch, over this afternoon, and you start dwelling on these things because I believe we are in that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Catch us away, oh Lord. Let that chariot of God's fire come down and swing low. You'll never regret it, Brother West. We'll have a shouting rejubile at that time. God bless you. Greet one another.
