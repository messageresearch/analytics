[31:31] foreign
[31:33] went up church this morning
[31:35] yes sir next week just a couple little
[31:38] announcements here
[31:40] we'll have prayer for the children
[31:43] next Sunday so everybody at school
[31:45] started I know this week but we'll have
[31:47] prayer with everyone we'll do that next
[31:48] Sunday if you have that keep that on
[31:50] your heart we'll also have family prayer
[31:52] meeting next Monday so not tomorrow but
[31:55] next Monday we'll have family prayer
[31:57] meeting as well
[31:59] you know I was pondering just prayer you
[32:02] know even as we always do that we just
[32:04] have prayer for the children and those
[32:05] going back to school and all of that you
[32:07] know I wonder if we could just have a
[32:09] peek if God would roll back the realm a
[32:11] little bit and and give us a a glimpse
[32:14] into the eternities as maybe as we would
[32:16] stand for prayer as we do each year and
[32:18] see really the impact of that as God
[32:21] starts dispatching
[32:23] his angels down he said okay now you
[32:25] take care of that one you watch over
[32:26] there and they start setting the order
[32:28] of Legions of the Angels would be coming
[32:31] down as they set an array as you go out
[32:33] to battle another year you don't say I
[32:35] was having prayer no we're saying Lord
[32:38] put a hedge about us amen we just don't
[32:41] do that as tradition but we're asking
[32:43] him to be with us each step of the way
[32:44] this year
[32:46] uh also going to have young peoples put
[32:48] that on your calendar for September 23rd
[32:51] and uh
[32:53] plan for as we best we can the third
[32:56] Friday of each month would be the uh the
[32:58] time that we like to do that but this so
[33:01] this will be September 23rd we'll have
[33:03] young peoples here I'll be at the uh
[33:05] we'll be holding that in the school
[33:06] recently so that'll be where that is uh
[33:09] indeed I bring greetings from Brother
[33:11] David Mayer and the assembly there we
[33:13] were able to spend some time with them
[33:14] we had a wonderful time together uh
[33:18] sees letter David he's like family he's
[33:20] pretty much like family here to the
[33:22] church so it's just really a little
[33:23] extension but they send their greetings
[33:25] to everybody here and say God bless you
[33:28] be with you and a little break there
[33:30] with them and we're back in the saddle

[34:01] say this mountain Can't Be Moved no
[34:06] they say well that's what they say but
[34:09] my God says differently amen they say
[34:12] these chains as we sang will never break
[34:14] that's what they say but my God says
[34:16] something different why do we sing that
[34:18] together this morning as we turn to the
[34:20] word you help me out
[34:22] all right let them snow be special
[34:25] they say this mountain can be moved

[38:25] heart this morning as Lord if we could
[38:27] just say to you we believe your word
[38:30] Lord Through the Ages Lord many have
[38:32] fallen away and Lord question this and
[38:35] questioned that but Lord we this morning
[38:37] I pray are a hundred percent group of
[38:40] Believers in this building that can say
[38:42] we believe we might not understand it
[38:44] all but we believe it all and Lord you
[38:47] said it so we believe it this morning
[38:49] Lord I pray you would take your word

[39:15] that you can meet my cry this very hour
[39:18] so we commit this service and all that
[39:21] is transpired and will Lord be said into
[39:24] your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen
[39:28] amen he said it
[39:32] amen let's turn to our Bibles this
[39:34] morning Isaiah 50.
[39:39] thank you musicians
[39:53] I Was preparing in a bit of a different
[39:55] direction for most the weekend and I
[39:57] couldn't really shake
[40:00] to go to this thought
[40:04] she took it in Switzerland and I
[40:06] generally just once it's preached it's
[40:08] breached
[40:10] but uh Lord help me this morning
[40:14] maybe somebody is in need today Isaiah
[40:17] 50.
[40:18] verse 5.
[40:22] the Lord God hath opened mine ear and I
[40:24] was not rebellious
[40:26] neither turned away back
[40:28] man I'm so glad he's opened my ear
[40:30] oh man and I'm not rebellious
[40:33] I haven't turned around but I've ran to
[40:35] him I gave my back to the smiters and my
[40:38] cheeks to them that plucked off the hair
[40:41] I hid my fate hid not my faith from
[40:43] shame and spitting
[40:46] and prophesying
[40:47] of Jesus
[40:49] for the Lord God will help me therefore
[40:51] shall I not be confounded
[40:54] therefore have I set my face like a
[40:56] flint and I know that I shall not be
[40:59] ashamed
[41:00] he is near that justifieth me who will
[41:03] contend with me my I love this verse he
[41:06] is near that justifies me isn't that
[41:09] beautiful
[41:10] Amplified says he who declares me is
[41:13] right near
[41:15] Glory
[41:16] it says who will contend with me let us
[41:19] Stand Together who is mine adversary let
[41:21] him come near me
[41:23] again who will dare to contend with me
[41:25] is what another
[41:26] translation says let him let us stand up
[41:29] to each other who is my adversary let
[41:31] him approach me
[41:32] amen he knew who's by his side man when
[41:35] you have Lord Jesus standing near you
[41:37] say who's my adversary amen if God
[41:40] before us who can stand against us verse
[41:42] 9 behold the Lord God will help me who
[41:44] is he that shall condemn me Lo they
[41:46] shall wax old as a garment and the moth
[41:49] shall eat them up
[41:51] amen let's turn to Luke 9 51.
[42:10] sister Sheila I was looking for brother
[42:12] Peter this morning tell him I was had a
[42:14] hankering for his specials
[42:17] passed that message on for me
[42:22] verse 51 and it came to pass when the
[42:24] time was come that he should be received
[42:27] up he steadfastly set his face
[42:30] to go to Jerusalem
[42:32] amen he steadfastly set his face to go
[42:35] to Jerusalem and the Lord blessed the
[42:37] reading of his word
[42:38] you may have receipts this morning
[42:44] can I relax like already I know it's
[42:47] Sunday morning but
[42:49] that's what's worse Sunday morning
[42:53] I'm used to just good old-fashioned
[42:55] Wednesday
[42:56] amen well
[42:58] I'm gonna just take a little thought
[42:59] this morning uh face set Like Flint
[43:02] it's just been something that's been on
[43:04] my heart I've pondered it for a while
[43:06] now and
[43:08] I just
[43:09] pray that it would be a little blessing
[43:11] to you but face set Like Flint you know
[43:13] what we humans we're we're interesting
[43:17] we're we're uh we have a certain nature
[43:21] a certain drive inside of us that is is
[43:23] unique from the other species that are
[43:25] on the planet
[43:27] and uh you know they will sometimes go
[43:30] not sometimes many times will go beyond
[43:33] really the imaginable or what we should
[43:36] be doing for a certain level of gain you
[43:39] know we will strive you know and
[43:41] sometimes uh question really was it
[43:44] worth it per se but you know nature on a
[43:47] whole it it has a different
[43:50] um level of Drive per se they'll go to a
[43:52] certain limit you know if you've ever
[43:55] seen uh you watch bears like a man like
[43:59] a couple male bears as they're in maybe
[44:00] a season for a mating season of such and
[44:03] these men these male Bears they'll stand
[44:05] there with each other as they come
[44:06] against each other and they're you know
[44:08] they're they're combating for who is
[44:09] obviously the biggest and the greatest
[44:11] and and uh but they'll they'll they'll I
[44:13] won't do it because I'm no bear and then
[44:15] nor do I want to look like a fool up
[44:16] here but uh you know they have their big
[44:19] mouths and their snouts open real wide
[44:21] and they stand up on their two feet and
[44:22] they get pretty tall and especially like
[44:24] a Grizzly or something like that or a
[44:26] polar bear and and they'll have their
[44:27] gaping mouth open and they're kind of
[44:29] just roaring and I won't even imitate
[44:30] that because that would be way off the
[44:32] grid and and they're trying to scare the
[44:35] other one
[44:37] all right thank you brother Richard he
[44:39] knows these things and they're trying to
[44:42] prove that I've got I've got everything
[44:44] I need to beat you I've got it all and
[44:46] so he just starts to Roar and gnarl and
[44:49] and you know get real close and he bends
[44:51] his head a little bit like he's going to
[44:52] go in for the kill but he's just you
[44:54] know not quite there but he's showing
[44:56] that he's ready anybody ever seen that
[44:58] thank you yeah we've seen that in many
[45:00] different in nature and different
[45:02] animals because they're actually they're
[45:04] not willing to put their life on the
[45:07] line unless really really necessary
[45:12] nature does that they it's just not
[45:15] worth it you know there's few things
[45:17] that are worth it to them and showing
[45:19] that they're the biggest and and best is
[45:21] is really just right there and sometimes
[45:23] they will you know just someone tips
[45:26] over the edge and then it's game on but
[45:28] really other than that or maybe food and
[45:31] they're they're extremely uh they're
[45:32] gonna starve to death really a matter of
[45:34] life and death that's when Nature will
[45:36] put it all on the line that's when
[45:39] Nature puts it on the line and and then
[45:41] they'll you know as those two bears they
[45:42] really strap it out but humans were a
[45:46] little different
[45:47] we're just a tad different than that
[45:49] apparently we really don't have that
[45:52] threshold it's not life or death only
[45:54] but it can be really anything
[45:56] humans really put it put it on the line
[45:58] and go to extremes for really minimum
[46:03] really you don't know what I'm talking
[46:05] about
[46:06] you know many of you would know way back
[46:08] not too long ago there was this you know
[46:10] this whole series called Fear Factor
[46:13] who knows that that is don't even have
[46:15] to put your head up and they would do
[46:18] some Terrible Things they'd be willing
[46:20] to do terrible things
[46:21] for fifty thousand dollars
[46:24] he said well that's a lot of money but
[46:25] when they when you see what they were
[46:27] willing to do you say you're insane
[46:30] and all of nature would look at them and
[46:32] say you're insane and you're the top of
[46:34] the chain I don't know
[46:37] so you know people they're willing to
[46:39] even discuss things but if you actually
[46:41] go into one person they're willing to be
[46:43] trapped into a coffin buried in a coffin
[46:46] and then their partner who had to dig
[46:47] them out in a certain period of time
[46:51] really
[46:52] and your partner's not even a ditch
[46:54] digger not even a hole digger I mean
[46:56] it's one thing if they're power pole
[46:58] diggers but not so in this one case but
[47:00] this humans are willing to do the insane
[47:04] for such small gain
[47:08] you know I'll give you 20 bucks and all
[47:10] these challenges that go over the
[47:11] internet you know this challenge that
[47:13] challenge you know eat a spoonful of
[47:14] cinnamon and die pretty much don't do it
[47:18] for what you know for what what are
[47:21] people why are they doing it
[47:23] that's the human species
[47:25] and so they go they're willing to go to
[47:27] these limits really for the smallest
[47:29] amount whether it's for a little bit of
[47:31] money maybe a little popularity that's
[47:33] really what most of it's for
[47:34] right nowadays it's just so you get your
[47:36] picture you know with as many hits as
[47:38] you can
[47:39] and so they do the worst of things
[47:43] it's because they're convinced that it's
[47:45] worthwhile
[47:46] right they're convinced they're
[47:48] convinced that it's you know why not
[47:50] people will fall they'll look for a
[47:52] selfie and die because they felt that
[47:54] that was worth worth their time work to
[47:56] go to the edge you wouldn't believe how
[47:58] many people have died taking selfies
[48:00] it's a real deal
[48:02] go beyond the fence line just go beyond
[48:04] I just need to get the best picture and
[48:06] take a step back you don't think it
[48:07] happens it happens a lot it's terrible
[48:10] for the most minimal thing because
[48:11] apparently it's worth it I'm convinced
[48:13] that I need to do that and so that's
[48:15] what where humanity is
[48:18] and they assess that it's worth giving
[48:20] my all
[48:23] for something very very small
[48:27] and they've actually set their face like
[48:29] a flint
[48:30] they put their face towards something I
[48:33] said whatever it takes I'm going to do
[48:34] it because it's worth it you know in the
[48:37] scripture they use Flint Flint is super
[48:39] hard it's actually way up there on the
[48:41] scale of of hardness just under Diamond
[48:43] by a little bit a few few numbers on the
[48:46] scale and so in the scripture it's
[48:48] saying I've set my face like a flint
[48:50] just it was such a hardness with such a
[48:53] which was such a I got no quit in me
[48:55] I've got no stop I've said I'm so
[48:57] determined and that's what this the the
[49:00] line means I've set my face like a flint
[49:02] and so someone becomes so convinced they
[49:04] become so firmly believing in the truth
[49:07] of something and so therefore they
[49:09] they're willing to put it all in the
[49:10] line
[49:12] but brother Branham says you know he
[49:14] says God God of people ready he says
[49:16] better convinced in 10 days then we can
[49:19] get them in 10 years speaking of the
[49:21] upper room he says when our seminaries
[49:24] come out they're still not convinced
[49:25] because they've had tradition injected
[49:27] into them but when they waited on God
[49:29] for 10 days they certainly convinced
[49:32] them he says certainly convinced some of
[49:35] them at Pentecost couldn't even write
[49:36] their own name but they were convinced
[49:39] it was God Amen and so therefore their
[49:43] faces were set like a flint and man they
[49:47] were so convinced brother Brown says
[49:48] that he was all they needed amen they
[49:52] didn't need anything else and man he
[49:54] says we haven't come to this place yet
[49:56] he goes they were convinced they didn't
[49:58] need education they didn't you know
[49:59] Fellowship card they knew they were
[50:01] Abraham's seed and God is able to
[50:04] perform what he promised to do I'd say
[50:06] at that point at that moment when the
[50:08] Holy Spirit came down in the upper room
[50:11] they were all in after that they were
[50:14] immediately convinced this is God I
[50:16] don't need a question anymore I don't
[50:18] got a Wonder in my mind was this really
[50:19] him at that moment it was all in and
[50:22] their faces were set Like Flint on the
[50:24] word of God Amen
[50:27] and you need to be thoroughly convinced
[50:29] before you sell out to something
[50:32] if you're just a little halfway you
[50:34] ain't gonna you're not gonna give it all
[50:36] you say it's not really worth it it's
[50:38] just not worth me you know putting
[50:40] putting my everything into that if you
[50:42] don't actually really believe and are
[50:45] convinced that is true
[50:47] so I wonder how many Christians these
[50:50] days really actually aren't convinced
[50:52] because they haven't had an experience
[50:54] and so therefore the reason why their
[50:56] life is only half baked or a half-mast
[50:58] Christian Life is because they're not
[51:00] totally convinced that Christ is the
[51:02] only one they need but when you get so
[51:04] convinced like they did in the upper
[51:06] room that he is the only true God he's
[51:10] the one that can fill me and save me
[51:11] he's the one is my deliverer and he
[51:14] alone is who I'll serve when you are
[51:15] convinced like that your walk is an
[51:18] all-in walk
[51:20] and you will know it and so will those
[51:22] around you
[51:24] amen people go all in
[51:26] they're convinced that their sports team
[51:28] or their Sports drive or their desire
[51:30] for business
[51:32] their desire for fashion
[51:34] they believe in it
[51:35] and so they go all in and you can see it
[51:37] all over their life they'll do
[51:38] everything for it do everything they can
[51:40] to achieve the end they desire whatever
[51:42] they want to do
[51:44] but I pray this morning
[51:46] you're just checking your heart say Lord
[51:47] I'm gonna be all in today
[51:50] I want to fully convinced experience but
[51:53] around preach convinced and then
[51:54] concerned
[51:55] but you know I'm gonna
[51:57] there's another fella
[52:00] that's convinced in what he's doing
[52:03] and that's the Devil Himself
[52:06] he's convinced
[52:07] of what he's his objective and he is
[52:10] indeed willing
[52:11] willing to do whatever it takes to
[52:16] derail you
[52:19] so I'm telling you this morning the
[52:20] reason why you need to be all in the
[52:22] reason why you need to know that you and
[52:24] your God have a personal walk because
[52:26] your adversary the devil is all in in
[52:29] what he's trying to achieve he's not
[52:31] holding Zippo back against you so I
[52:34] would recommend you have a walk with God
[52:36] so that he can do whatever it takes amen
[52:41] Satan
[52:43] will go to the very edge the very extent
[52:46] the very maximum he isn't going to he's
[52:48] not a halfway person I'll tell you that
[52:50] just check out what he's done through
[52:52] time he isn't holding something back
[52:54] he's given everything he's got to try
[52:58] and upset God's plan and so as we would
[53:01] go and it very easy or or an ex account
[53:04] in the scripture that would would be
[53:06] very um familiar to you would be into
[53:08] job as Satan would have came and spoke
[53:11] to God I still always Marvel when I read
[53:14] that there was a day when the sons of
[53:16] God came to present themselves before
[53:17] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[53:20] can you imagine and the Lord said to
[53:22] Satan whence cometh thou my I just I I
[53:26] just try and visual visualize this this
[53:28] account and say an answer to the Lord
[53:30] and said well from going to and from for
[53:32] over in the earth and walking up and
[53:34] down so Satan's been walking around he's
[53:36] been looking around checking out all the
[53:39] different aspects of the earth and
[53:40] obviously job was high on the on the
[53:43] list because this is who comes up in the
[53:45] conversation and so Satan had been
[53:47] watching job
[53:49] Satan's watching you I've been going to
[53:52] and fro looking at God's people and
[53:54] job's caught his eye well you don't
[53:56] think Satan's walking to and fro and I
[53:58] sure hope you catch his eye you kind of
[54:01] want to I sure hope we're on his radar
[54:04] because if you're not you're obviously
[54:06] not he's all you're obviously not a
[54:07] problem to him may we be on his radar
[54:09] maybe get up in the morning and Satan's
[54:12] like oh dear they're back up again I got
[54:14] to deal with these ones again they're on
[54:15] my radar let's fill his radar with with
[54:18] our walk with God Amen so the Lord said
[54:20] to Satan hast thou considered my servant
[54:22] job there is none like him on Earth
[54:24] perfect upright one that fear God and
[54:27] Satan said to the lord well yeah
[54:29] does job fear God for not
[54:32] have to put a hedge about him and about
[54:34] his house but all he has on every side
[54:37] that was bless the work of his hands and
[54:39] his substances increased in the land of
[54:42] course you've done everything you can
[54:44] for job and he's been blessed and his
[54:47] hand his work he's prosperous and his
[54:49] substances increase but I tell you if
[54:52] you take your hand from him and you just
[54:54] step back a little bit and touch all
[54:57] that he hath he'll curse you to your
[54:59] face
[55:00] and imagine the challenge that the devil
[55:02] is giving to God
[55:04] imagine that
[55:06] like he doesn't know that God doesn't
[55:08] know all things he does know all things
[55:09] and here's Satan's saying yeah but if
[55:11] you do this he's going to curse you
[55:14] and the Lord said behold
[55:16] all that he hath is in thine power
[55:19] only upon himself put not forth that
[55:23] hand and so Satan went forth from the
[55:26] presence of the Lord can you imagine
[55:28] Satan saying I've got this now just you
[55:32] watch just you wait everything is now in
[55:36] my control
[55:38] you know what I what I love about this
[55:40] better brand says now notice oh he says
[55:43] oh I love this God knowing the heart job
[55:47] had only one way that's through
[55:49] Fellowship through the shedding of the
[55:51] blood he had talked to God he knowed
[55:55] that he was God had confidence in job
[55:58] because he had fellowship with job
[56:02] can you imagine Satan's saying he's
[56:04] going to curse you to your face and God
[56:06] is sitting back there saying
[56:09] do what you feel I'll give you all the
[56:12] range you need up into his life because
[56:14] God knew I've actually had fellowship
[56:16] with job me and job we've had some
[56:19] communion together well I just was just
[56:21] with him actually just recently this is
[56:22] in God's mind and Satan doesn't know and
[56:24] he's like I just had fellowship with job
[56:26] and he just was talking to me about his
[56:28] his struggles and and his desires he was
[56:30] just telling me how much he loved me and
[56:32] and I was speaking back to him and
[56:34] telling him I love you too job you keep
[56:37] my Commandments and you're holding fast
[56:39] to my word I just want to bless you and
[56:41] he's he communed with him
[56:44] he had fellowship with job and so God
[56:48] knew Sorry Devil I've had fellowship
[56:51] with job I know his walk I know his
[56:54] desires I know his struggles I know it
[56:57] all because he's talking to me he's
[57:00] fellowshipping with me and because of
[57:01] that I have full confidence
[57:04] full confidence in his walk so do what
[57:08] you want I'll give you all the bandwidth
[57:10] you need but I know job came to this
[57:13] Revelation but God already knew
[57:16] job ain't gonna curse me for nothing
[57:19] amen oh he says oh god brother Brandon
[57:22] says may the Branham Tabernacle
[57:27] can have confidence in you
[57:30] it's not because you do something
[57:33] not because you do something amazing
[57:36] or with your faith or do something but
[57:38] when you have Fellowship
[57:41] Fellowship
[57:43] how important is fellowship fellowship
[57:46] with him oh what blessed sweet communion
[57:49] Jesus is a friend of mine that's the
[57:53] most important can you imagine if job
[57:55] didn't have fellowship and there was no
[57:57] confidence it would be a totally
[57:58] different story but job had conf guarded
[58:01] confidence in job because of a walk with
[58:04] God
[58:05] amen
[58:08] so Satan
[58:10] he says wonderful
[58:11] so he got to work Satan didn't take any
[58:14] time
[58:15] he didn't he didn't he didn't need a
[58:17] whole lot of time to figure out what to
[58:18] do
[58:19] so here he comes and the messenger came
[58:20] to job and oxen replying as the
[58:23] scripture says and they were feeding and
[58:25] the sabians fell upon them and took them
[58:27] all away
[58:28] this is what the messenger is saying to
[58:30] job
[58:31] messenger number one and here he comes
[58:34] he's speaking now to Job saying oh my
[58:36] goodness I was plowing with the auction
[58:39] and the asses were feeding beside them
[58:40] and the sabians fell upon him and took
[58:42] them all away and they've slain the
[58:44] servants with the edge of the sword and
[58:46] I'm the only one I alone am the only one
[58:48] to tell you
[58:50] you know who's read this recently
[58:52] nobody well all right
[58:56] you know what the next verse says it
[58:58] says while he was yet speaking
[59:01] while he was yet speaking and I've
[59:03] always been amazed at this because job
[59:05] is sitting there maybe at the the
[59:08] doorway of his tent and he's sitting
[59:10] maybe on his little on a little chair
[59:12] something that or a stool and you know
[59:14] it was just another normal day just woke
[59:16] up you know everything's you know day by
[59:18] day the Lord has blessed him all is
[59:20] wonderful but something changed he
[59:22] didn't know but something changed
[59:23] everything that Satan could do was now
[59:26] getting poured out on job
[59:29] he just woke up in the morning you wake
[59:31] up in the morning like my goodness
[59:32] what's going wrong well it could be a
[59:35] job moment job God and the devil had a
[59:37] conversation and God says do what you
[59:39] need to do because I'm going to prove to
[59:41] you I have confidence in them and this
[59:43] was the morning that job had he was just
[59:45] sitting and suddenly everything was
[59:48] going wrong
[59:50] and so here he's now trying to take in
[59:52] oh my goodness all my oxen and all my
[59:55] asses they're all gone the sabians but
[59:57] they haven't come and they haven't come
[59:58] to hurt us or or to fight with us so am
[1:00:01] I you know he's just trying to deal with
[1:00:02] that and the last words are coming out
[1:00:05] of the servant's mouth and so he would
[1:00:07] have been saying and I only and suddenly
[1:00:09] another servant comes running up and
[1:00:12] he's trying to get out what you know the
[1:00:14] first one out of his mouth and the other
[1:00:15] one comes and says oh job job the fire
[1:00:18] of God has fallen from heaven and have
[1:00:21] burned up the sheep and the servants and
[1:00:24] consumed them and I only am escaped and
[1:00:28] he is also saying I only as the other
[1:00:31] one and another servant is barging into
[1:00:34] the into his tent area there and he says
[1:00:36] oh job job I don't know what these two
[1:00:38] are here for but I got some important
[1:00:40] news he says oh the Chaldeans have made
[1:00:42] out three bands and fell upon your
[1:00:45] camels and carried them away and I'm and
[1:00:47] slain the servants by the edge of the
[1:00:49] sword and I only am escaped I don't know
[1:00:51] what your problem is but mine's
[1:00:52] incredible
[1:00:55] job is trying to take it all in
[1:00:57] uh sabians camels oxen all my servants
[1:01:01] and while he's yet speaking he thought
[1:01:04] his news was important the next servant
[1:01:06] came in and said oh you I don't know
[1:01:09] what their your issues looks like
[1:01:10] there's a gathering here but I got some
[1:01:12] important news job your sons and
[1:01:14] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[1:01:16] in their eldest brother's house and
[1:01:18] behold a great wind came right from out
[1:01:21] of nowhere just blew through the from
[1:01:24] the Wilderness and smote the corners of
[1:01:25] the home and all the young men and
[1:01:28] they're dead and I only am escaped
[1:01:32] one two three four
[1:01:36] and Joe's swimming what is going on
[1:01:41] it's because Satan was doing everything
[1:01:44] he could everything
[1:01:48] God didn't say yeah you can do anything
[1:01:51] you want up and to his life and Satan's
[1:01:55] like wow okay I'll uh I'll just go
[1:01:57] halfway
[1:01:58] I'll just take care of his camels
[1:02:01] or maybe just his oxen
[1:02:03] no no no
[1:02:04] Satan said all right
[1:02:07] and went
[1:02:08] all the way
[1:02:09] to the very
[1:02:12] weight and delay it it was just like
[1:02:15] bang bang bang take that
[1:02:18] this is how Satan was working
[1:02:21] and job Rose rent his mantle shaved his
[1:02:25] head and fell down upon the ground
[1:02:28] and worshiped
[1:02:31] Glory
[1:02:33] God we are jobs
[1:02:36] we are the same caliber as job I'd say
[1:02:39] because we're of that we're children of
[1:02:41] God and in those moments if you have
[1:02:43] fellowship with God
[1:02:45] there's not it's not job had a different
[1:02:47] type of Fellowship you have fellowship
[1:02:49] with God God will have confidence in you
[1:02:52] because you are communing with him and
[1:02:54] whether or not the devil is is doing
[1:02:56] halfway or all the way God has full
[1:02:58] confidence in your response and our
[1:03:01] response may it be oh God I worship you
[1:03:06] you're the king of glory
[1:03:08] what did he say he says and he said
[1:03:11] naked came I out of my mother's womb
[1:03:14] naked I return God is given God taken
[1:03:17] away blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:03:22] that can only come out of a relationship
[1:03:25] with God you can't have that response
[1:03:28] you cannot have what that man took and
[1:03:30] be like well blessed be the name of the
[1:03:32] Lord no no that came because there was a
[1:03:35] walk with God
[1:03:36] it came I can tell you it was probably I
[1:03:39] would believe it just came out of a just
[1:03:41] a burst from job
[1:03:44] she emotionally completely wrecked
[1:03:48] really
[1:03:49] wrecked
[1:03:50] how do you process all that
[1:03:53] but something inside job
[1:03:55] because he had Fellowship because he had
[1:03:59] a personal walk with almighty God
[1:04:02] something inside of him just started to
[1:04:04] well up oh God I don't know what's going
[1:04:06] on on my tip but something is well up he
[1:04:08] said oh naked came I naked I go blessed
[1:04:12] be the name of the Lord
[1:04:15] and in all this job
[1:04:18] sinned not
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:23] nor charge God foolishly
[1:04:26] can you imagine
[1:04:28] the devil
[1:04:29] you know how upset he must have been
[1:04:33] I said come on
[1:04:38] keep everything I got
[1:04:40] still
[1:04:41] still seriously you know why
[1:04:44] you know why because God just drew a
[1:04:46] line
[1:04:48] he says all right devil you can go to
[1:04:51] there
[1:04:53] and so the devil
[1:04:55] was immediately there
[1:04:58] immediately
[1:05:00] if you read your scripture he was there
[1:05:02] he didn't delay he didn't take time and
[1:05:04] saw under his way to the line no he was
[1:05:06] immediately at the line but you know
[1:05:08] what he couldn't take one big toenail
[1:05:10] across the line he can't take a move
[1:05:13] across where God has placed him you say
[1:05:16] oh what am I going through God knows
[1:05:18] what you're going through he knows
[1:05:19] exactly what you can handle scripture
[1:05:21] states that and he'll never allow the
[1:05:24] enemy to go past it even a millimeter
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:29] this might be your Breaking Point here
[1:05:31] and God sets the line
[1:05:34] because he knows he says uh-uh Sorry
[1:05:36] Devil I just tried his fellowship with
[1:05:38] them I just had a Sweet Hour of Prayer
[1:05:40] with that sister so here you go go to
[1:05:43] there but you can't go any further amen
[1:05:47] that should put confidence in your God
[1:05:50] because he's got your back
[1:05:52] he knows exactly what you can handle so
[1:05:55] he says all right Dev I'll give you all
[1:05:57] you need
[1:05:58] except past the line
[1:06:02] foreign
[1:06:04] you know what's beautiful
[1:06:09] it's never
[1:06:11] the devil's best
[1:06:13] is never enough
[1:06:16] the devil's best
[1:06:20] actually enough
[1:06:24] you must have the most wickedest complex
[1:06:31] the I'm not good enough complex
[1:06:34] the devil has that one
[1:06:36] so if he tries to throw that on you it's
[1:06:38] because he has it himself
[1:06:40] so don't take his problem
[1:06:42] he is just not good enough God placed
[1:06:44] that one there everything he does I mean
[1:06:47] good grief he should have set back from
[1:06:48] Job and said well why do I even try but
[1:06:51] he still does just builds back up on his
[1:06:53] complex I'm sure he's fired more demons
[1:06:56] from the job they said really you
[1:06:57] couldn't do it no they just they just
[1:06:59] withstood me you're fired next one well
[1:07:02] I couldn't get them to go there I
[1:07:04] attempted him I tempted him but they
[1:07:05] just wouldn't go you're fired he'd fired
[1:07:07] so many because he cannot make it happen
[1:07:10] because he can only go so far
[1:07:14] it's not good enough
[1:07:19] second Corinthians
[1:07:20] it says
[1:07:22] and it's been spoke on and loved the
[1:07:24] scripture but we have this treasure in
[1:07:26] Earth and vessels
[1:07:28] the Excellency of the power may be of
[1:07:30] God and not of us
[1:07:32] we are troubled but the Murphy spoke on
[1:07:34] this so incredibly on every side yet not
[1:07:38] distressed
[1:07:40] we're perplexed
[1:07:42] but not in despair
[1:07:43] or persecuted but not forsaken we're
[1:07:47] cast down but not destroyed amen why
[1:07:50] because he just can't get all the way
[1:07:52] it's never good enough to take his son
[1:07:55] or daughter of God and take them into
[1:07:57] the wretchedness God will hold him back
[1:08:00] to your limit why can you be troubled
[1:08:02] you're going to be troubled
[1:08:04] job was troubled are you going to be
[1:08:07] destroyed are you going to be perplexed
[1:08:08] oh God why is this happening I don't
[1:08:11] understand it can you have perplexing
[1:08:13] times oh yeah you can are you going to
[1:08:16] be persecuted mm-hmm
[1:08:17] he was persecuted
[1:08:19] he bore Stripes he bore scorn he bore
[1:08:22] shame will you yes you can
[1:08:27] cast down
[1:08:29] maybe you're going to feel like you're
[1:08:31] just completely down barely feeling you
[1:08:33] can get up the next day so distraught
[1:08:36] but the scripture says yet not
[1:08:39] distressed but not despair but not
[1:08:42] forsaken but not destroyed he's gonna
[1:08:46] push against the lying put you against
[1:08:48] the line you're cast down now you're
[1:08:50] perplexed you're troubled but yes but
[1:08:52] I'm not destroyed I'm not in despair
[1:08:54] because he's got me in his hand i'm
[1:08:58] communion with my God I'm like job I
[1:09:01] have fellowship with my Jesus
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:12] Satan
[1:09:14] another time in Scripture
[1:09:17] tried to put all the fury of hell
[1:09:20] unto one man
[1:09:22] and here
[1:09:23] was a man named Legion
[1:09:25] how it started I don't know
[1:09:28] but Satan started to lay it on
[1:09:32] again he ain't gonna hold it back
[1:09:34] everything
[1:09:36] he's gonna do everything that he can do
[1:09:38] and he started to lay it on him and
[1:09:41] Demon after demon started to wrap a
[1:09:45] legion
[1:09:46] and if I visualized it as I did in
[1:09:49] Switzerland I was just visualizing what
[1:09:51] Legion would have looked like
[1:09:53] in that Supernatural realm we'd have
[1:09:56] seen a man tearing at himself and chains
[1:09:58] and all that but in a different place if
[1:10:00] you can imagine chain after chain
[1:10:03] it would have been placed on him demon
[1:10:05] after demon started to just wrap around
[1:10:07] him as as the devil just started
[1:10:09] throwing it and started to wrap and bind
[1:10:12] him with chains of darkness and so bit
[1:10:15] by bit all you would see after the wild
[1:10:18] devil say I got some more another demon
[1:10:20] here another demon there another issue
[1:10:22] there he doesn't start to wrap him and
[1:10:24] all you would have seen is this huge rap
[1:10:27] ball of Gene and somewhere somewhere in
[1:10:31] there
[1:10:32] was Legion
[1:10:34] and the devil was saying
[1:10:37] you're going to be my example
[1:10:39] I've thrown everything I can and nothing
[1:10:43] nothing will deliver him impossible
[1:10:48] and Satan thought that he had finally
[1:10:51] been good enough to defeat God
[1:10:54] and here Legion was now amongst the
[1:10:57] tombs
[1:10:59] hurting himself
[1:11:01] all of these things breaking things men
[1:11:03] couldn't contain him and he was he was
[1:11:06] Satan's
[1:11:08] you know
[1:11:09] model that's what I can do
[1:11:12] he could point to all of his demons see
[1:11:14] what I can do that's my best
[1:11:17] that's my best
[1:11:20] [Music]
[1:11:21] you know your Bible
[1:11:25] but just one day
[1:11:28] just one day
[1:11:30] a little man
[1:11:32] stepped out of a boat
[1:11:34] stepped out of a boat
[1:11:36] he'd just gone through a storm
[1:11:39] he just calmed it and he steps on the
[1:11:42] shore and Satan is like huh
[1:11:45] that was the best I got
[1:11:47] what happened
[1:11:49] he came running up and fell down at the
[1:11:53] feet of Jesus and started to worship
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:11:57] Satan's what's going on everything that
[1:12:00] I've done my best is what's what's
[1:12:01] happening it it was all falling apart
[1:12:03] and right there in just a matter of a
[1:12:06] few words and a short span of time Jesus
[1:12:09] said
[1:12:10] what do you say
[1:12:13] I just said a couple little words
[1:12:16] he said lose him
[1:12:19] the demons he told the flea he decided a
[1:12:22] couple little words
[1:12:25] a couple little words
[1:12:27] and the brain's chain started to break
[1:12:30] one by one if you could let step back in
[1:12:32] that realm chain after chain started to
[1:12:35] break up the noise of it would have been
[1:12:37] deafening as everything started to fall
[1:12:39] apart and the power that the devil
[1:12:41] thought he had the best that he could do
[1:12:43] started to break apart at the spoken
[1:12:46] word of almighty God all that God had to
[1:12:49] do was just speak and loose him from the
[1:12:51] power of the enemy and the chain started
[1:12:53] to break away and everything sort of
[1:12:55] fall away and there was Legion in his
[1:12:58] right mind
[1:13:00] because God spoke
[1:13:03] you might have you might say well I'm in
[1:13:06] big I have some problems my son is in
[1:13:08] Chains my daughter's in Chains I've got
[1:13:11] an issue but at the word of God
[1:13:13] if it can take a legion
[1:13:16] if it can take Legion who is Satan's
[1:13:19] picture of what he can do it was never
[1:13:21] and will never be good enough
[1:13:24] never good enough for the word of God
[1:13:26] God will speak with her across this
[1:13:28] Pulpit or across some other Pulpit or
[1:13:31] when you're reading your Bible in the
[1:13:32] morning and the word of God just speaks
[1:13:34] to you that alone is enough to break
[1:13:36] every bit that the devil can do
[1:13:40] thank you
[1:13:41] amen
[1:13:46] Satan's Fury
[1:13:48] is never good enough
[1:13:50] I'm never good enough
[1:13:52] he will Bluff you
[1:13:54] he'll Bluff you
[1:13:56] to try and tell you it's good enough
[1:13:58] but God has armed you with enough in
[1:14:01] here to show you that it's never good
[1:14:04] enough and that's why he's got a bad bad
[1:14:08] day every day because he's got to live
[1:14:09] with the complex that I'm never good
[1:14:11] enough
[1:14:12] give it to him feed his complex every
[1:14:16] day
[1:14:19] you know
[1:14:23] Satan does his best and gives it all
[1:14:27] every bit of it
[1:14:29] so convinced he sets his face like Flint
[1:14:31] before you
[1:14:32] so does God
[1:14:35] 's going to do his and everything
[1:14:38] God ain't Hold nothing back either if
[1:14:41] Satan's given it all
[1:14:42] so is our Lord
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:49] brother Brown says he was so concerned
[1:14:52] that he came from heaven
[1:14:54] give up heaven came down here on Earth
[1:14:57] and became born in a manure stable
[1:15:01] wait this is God's best
[1:15:06] think about it Satan his best is a whole
[1:15:09] different story wait God's giving his
[1:15:11] best here in a manure's table of
[1:15:13] bleeding cattle not even with clothes
[1:15:16] not a place to lay his head not a tomb
[1:15:19] to be buried smitten stricken the way he
[1:15:22] was he was concerned enough and God so
[1:15:25] loved the world till he give his only
[1:15:28] begotten son
[1:15:31] a man love
[1:15:33] constrained him
[1:15:35] amen God by his Sovereign Grace for
[1:15:38] ordained spoke your word your life into
[1:15:39] existence before the world was ever
[1:15:41] formed and by his infinite mind knowed
[1:15:43] you'd be in the Final End he says then
[1:15:46] Grace
[1:15:47] constrained him love constrained him to
[1:15:51] project Sovereign Grace to the Earth to
[1:15:54] make a provision to save you if he's
[1:15:56] seen you desired to be saved he's seen
[1:15:59] you desired to be saved so then
[1:16:02] therefore love constrained him to
[1:16:04] through his love his great attributes
[1:16:06] would not permit him to do nothing else
[1:16:10] amen he says to make a way of Escape he
[1:16:14] must do it
[1:16:16] Glory he must do it and so God had to
[1:16:20] then say I'm going to give my everything
[1:16:22] he gave everything what he gave was
[1:16:24] himself amen he didn't hold anything
[1:16:27] back he didn't send an angel he didn't
[1:16:29] send some other somebody in his place he
[1:16:32] couldn't and he knew that and so love
[1:16:34] constrained him he said I must give it
[1:16:36] all I must set my face like flint and
[1:16:39] give my everything I'm going to give
[1:16:41] them my everything
[1:16:45] and so the scripture said he said his
[1:16:47] face steadfastly
[1:16:49] because you could say well I'm just
[1:16:50] going to give it all all right
[1:16:54] that's easier said than done
[1:16:57] that can be easier said than done
[1:16:59] and Jesus as we open in scripture in
[1:17:02] Luke
[1:17:03] said his face steadfastly
[1:17:07] and here we go through those moments of
[1:17:10] time
[1:17:11] the Jews were looking for a king they
[1:17:13] were looking for someone to overthrow
[1:17:14] Rome they were looking for the Messiah
[1:17:17] to come and Reign and get rid of this
[1:17:20] domination and set up a kingdom and here
[1:17:23] they saw that the Messiah some were
[1:17:25] seeing all the Miracles and wonders said
[1:17:27] surely this could be the one he's going
[1:17:28] to set up his kingdom here he's going to
[1:17:30] overthrow Rome
[1:17:32] some thought this
[1:17:34] this wasn't the case
[1:17:35] but there was a pressure there that was
[1:17:38] bubbling through you can imagine there
[1:17:40] was a zealots in all of this that was
[1:17:41] happening at the time oh there was
[1:17:43] wonderful things Hosanna Hosanna you
[1:17:46] know the Palms are waving
[1:17:48] but it wasn't his purpose
[1:17:50] it wasn't his purpose to overthrow an
[1:17:52] Earthly Realm
[1:17:54] and he set his face to the cross
[1:17:57] I said there sperden said there had been
[1:17:59] hundreds of thousands of cases in which
[1:18:01] men's characters appeared to be opening
[1:18:02] like a rose
[1:18:04] oh things were they were their character
[1:18:06] was was blooming but he says that the
[1:18:09] worm of wealth was gnawing at the root
[1:18:11] and air Rose could fully expand and if
[1:18:15] the flood and flood the air with his
[1:18:17] perfume and so he's speaking here how
[1:18:18] many people have gone through time and
[1:18:20] it looks like they they were on the
[1:18:22] right course and their characters
[1:18:24] blooming but because something was was
[1:18:26] said or or wealth or popularity or
[1:18:28] something it detracted them off the
[1:18:31] pathway and there the perfume could emit
[1:18:34] from their life
[1:18:36] and here is Jesus was oh that you can
[1:18:39] imagine there would have been a lot of
[1:18:40] people
[1:18:41] and it was a very a time and but God set
[1:18:44] his eyes
[1:18:45] on the cross it didn't matter I'm not
[1:18:47] setting my kingdom up here I'm not I'm
[1:18:49] not looking to that I've got a different
[1:18:51] purpose and so he kept his eyes
[1:18:53] steadfastly like a flint he says I Gotta
[1:18:56] Give It All
[1:18:58] and Satan came down and says you want
[1:19:00] Power you want power just worship me a
[1:19:04] little
[1:19:05] it's not that hard
[1:19:07] just worship me and it's all the kingdom
[1:19:09] of the Earth is Yours
[1:19:14] but his purpose was too strong
[1:19:19] oh devil my compassion for my peoples
[1:19:22] too intense to yield to the tempter
[1:19:25] I was I'm not going to voluntarily I
[1:19:27] didn't leave the throne room of glory
[1:19:29] and the royalties of heaven and strip
[1:19:31] myself of all this just to take it in a
[1:19:34] different way I must go to the Cross
[1:19:35] amen he couldn't be bribed of his
[1:19:38] purpose no no no sir he said his face
[1:19:41] like Flint on the cross
[1:19:44] this is the process of giving everything
[1:19:50] friends even tried to persuade them
[1:19:53] Matthew
[1:19:54] from that time for Jesus began to show
[1:19:56] his disciples how he must go into
[1:19:57] Jerusalem suffer many things and be
[1:20:00] killed and be raised again on the third
[1:20:01] day Jesus told his disciples this in
[1:20:04] Matthew 16 and Peter took him and says
[1:20:06] oh and began to rebuke him
[1:20:09] imagine this Peter rebuking God
[1:20:15] rebuking the Lord Jesus right to his
[1:20:18] face saying be it far from thee Lord
[1:20:19] this shall not be unto thee it's not
[1:20:23] happening you're not going to die you're
[1:20:25] not you're not going to go through all
[1:20:26] this the sun is not and I know Peter's
[1:20:28] heart was was uh pure I'm sure but the
[1:20:30] response as we all know he turned and
[1:20:32] said get thee behind me Satan Thou Art
[1:20:36] an offense unto me how many how many in
[1:20:40] the form of maybe a loved one even Peter
[1:20:42] was pretty close to Jesus
[1:20:44] Peter was pretty close to Jesus
[1:20:46] and you have someone that is really dear
[1:20:48] to you start to tell you something maybe
[1:20:51] inside you know I have a direction I
[1:20:53] must go but a loved one starts to say no
[1:20:55] no that's not the right way to go and
[1:20:57] deter somebody from really the path they
[1:21:00] should take beware
[1:21:03] his face was set steadfast on the will
[1:21:06] of God you make sure you know the will
[1:21:09] of God for your life not someone else's
[1:21:12] idea of what it should be no no no Lord
[1:21:14] be it far from you you'll never go there
[1:21:16] he says Get Behind Me Satan
[1:21:21] foreign
[1:21:23] maybe it comes down where it's just you
[1:21:25] and you alone and you and God
[1:21:27] you know God's path for you
[1:21:31] and God said well
[1:21:33] step aside I have my eyes set on the
[1:21:36] purpose I came for and Day by Day
[1:21:38] scripture by scripture he set his eyes
[1:21:41] steadfastly on the cross
[1:21:44] can you imagine
[1:21:46] you know as humans
[1:21:48] hear God is coming to die for you and me
[1:21:52] and all of the different things that
[1:21:54] people blasphemer be able to Bob and all
[1:21:58] of these things and here he's coming to
[1:22:00] die for them
[1:22:01] you know if you're here to do if you're
[1:22:03] doing something for somebody and they're
[1:22:05] just tearing 10 strips off you every day
[1:22:06] you're like forget that
[1:22:09] why am I going to do that for you
[1:22:10] careful now
[1:22:13] you live in human flesh
[1:22:15] but that's not Christ
[1:22:18] they tore strips off of him
[1:22:21] but he says it's for them I've come he
[1:22:24] didn't let any of that get his eyes off
[1:22:27] of what he came to do
[1:22:30] yeah
[1:22:31] but these were all small trials really
[1:22:34] that's when he started to come to the
[1:22:36] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:22:37] and the drops of sweat like blood
[1:22:39] started to pour from his brow
[1:22:42] even as he would go to prayer and Peter
[1:22:46] and the disciples were praying he says
[1:22:48] you know would you pray with me a little
[1:22:49] while
[1:22:50] and they couldn't even do that
[1:22:53] and he's all three times would you just
[1:22:55] pray for me a little while and they fall
[1:22:57] asleep
[1:22:59] and even his closest ones
[1:23:01] couldn't even spend a little bit of time
[1:23:03] as he agonized over what he must do
[1:23:06] sometimes what you must do it's
[1:23:08] agonizing
[1:23:09] it's agonizing
[1:23:11] all right you you know and he says oh
[1:23:14] God
[1:23:16] if this cup could pass from me
[1:23:20] but not my will
[1:23:22] and he agonized in the garden
[1:23:25] like I said doing everything it took
[1:23:27] easier said than done
[1:23:29] this isn't an easy walk Saints
[1:23:32] it's not an easy walk it wasn't an easy
[1:23:34] walk for our lord Jesus
[1:23:36] but he was showing us What It Takes he
[1:23:41] says I'm doing it for you Abraham
[1:23:43] and he set his face to the cross
[1:23:47] and felt the sorrow
[1:23:50] but he says I am resolved to achieve the
[1:23:53] Redemption of my people
[1:23:57] then came the agony the shame the
[1:24:00] whipping
[1:24:03] and God hung on the cross
[1:24:05] and then nailed him to the tree
[1:24:10] and all the Devils of Hell could jibe at
[1:24:13] him from all the parts of the earth that
[1:24:15] are mocking and jeering and who is this
[1:24:19] and he cried there on the cross my God
[1:24:29] Maybe
[1:24:30] in those moments
[1:24:32] he said I can't do it
[1:24:34] I don't have what it takes
[1:24:38] no
[1:24:44] you know the Romans they thought as they
[1:24:46] took the nail in his hand
[1:24:48] started to slam the nail down they
[1:24:51] thought that was what hung him on the
[1:24:52] cross
[1:24:53] they said that'll hold him there
[1:24:57] as they crucified
[1:24:59] your lord
[1:25:01] but it wasn't nails
[1:25:03] it was his love for me
[1:25:07] that nailed him to the train
[1:25:10] oh and bore the agony for all my sin
[1:25:14] amen he said no no I'm willing to do
[1:25:18] everything I'm gonna go all the way nail
[1:25:21] Me to the Cross with my back put the
[1:25:23] crown of thorns on my head scorn me mock
[1:25:26] me put me to shame do whatever you can
[1:25:28] give me everything you got devil
[1:25:31] give me it all
[1:25:33] and it's not gonna be enough
[1:25:36] It's never enough
[1:25:37] I'm the king of glory I'm going to give
[1:25:40] my all my everything and that is what it
[1:25:44] will take because I'm here to redeem my
[1:25:47] children amen
[1:25:50] he says I'm going to complete
[1:25:51] salvation's plan and bring Fallen man
[1:25:54] back to fellowship
[1:25:56] with me hey man I'm so glad he did
[1:25:59] everything ever he didn't hold back just
[1:26:01] a little bit and say well man I just I
[1:26:04] just cannot do it he did it he did it
[1:26:06] for you he did it for me and therefore
[1:26:09] therefore we must do it for him
[1:26:14] and so I'm challenging you this morning
[1:26:17] he did everything he had to do to save
[1:26:20] you and I everything the devil could
[1:26:22] throw at him wasn't enough to buy back
[1:26:25] your soul
[1:26:28] so now
[1:26:29] Lord Jesus I'm giving you my everything
[1:26:34] God's people will do whatever it takes
[1:26:37] because we're part of him
[1:26:39] we're part of him Saints if he had it in
[1:26:43] him to go every bit of the distance he's
[1:26:47] going all the way if you're part of him
[1:26:50] you've got what it takes to go the
[1:26:52] distance every bit of the way amen
[1:26:55] Philippians 3 says not as though I have
[1:26:57] already attained Ida was already perfect
[1:27:00] but I follow after if that I may
[1:27:02] apprehend that for which I am also
[1:27:04] apprehended for Christ Jesus Brethren I
[1:27:07] count on myself to have apprehended but
[1:27:09] this thing I do forgetting those things
[1:27:11] which are behind from this day today
[1:27:14] what happened last night at 11 59 PM I
[1:27:18] don't care
[1:27:19] I don't care and neither should you care
[1:27:22] this day this moment forgetting those
[1:27:26] things which are behind me I'm reaching
[1:27:29] part I'm going right ahead of me to
[1:27:31] those things which are before me I press
[1:27:34] toward I said my face as a flint on the
[1:27:39] prize
[1:27:41] amen of the High Calling of God in
[1:27:43] Christ Jesus amen set your face I don't
[1:27:47] care what's going on leave it behind
[1:27:50] if you take this scripture every day
[1:27:53] everything's behind you all the time
[1:27:55] day by day it's behind you always
[1:27:57] looking forward don't live in rear view
[1:28:00] mirrors
[1:28:01] don't place the rear view mirror and
[1:28:02] you're going forward in light but really
[1:28:04] you're just looking at your rear view
[1:28:05] everything's behind you all the time
[1:28:06] you're living your day in the rear view
[1:28:08] forget it Paul said press forward forget
[1:28:11] the behind you
[1:28:16] and now behold I go Bound in the spirit
[1:28:18] unto Jerusalem not knowing the things
[1:28:19] that shall befall me save the Holy Ghost
[1:28:22] witness Us in every city saying that
[1:28:24] bonds and afflictions abide me but none
[1:28:28] of these things move me
[1:28:31] amen none of these things move me I
[1:28:34] don't know what I got ahead of me
[1:28:36] they're saying I have bonds and
[1:28:37] afflictions and they'll do abide me
[1:28:39] whatever
[1:28:40] they don't move me
[1:28:42] neither count I life dear unto myself so
[1:28:44] that I might finish my course with joy
[1:28:48] amen
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:51] let Paul we're going to give it all
[1:28:53] Esther had to do such she was in a
[1:28:56] position where she had to really
[1:28:58] actually count it all out and she came
[1:29:00] to a point where it was
[1:29:01] uh life or death was it not Haman had
[1:29:05] laid out his plan Mordecai urges her to
[1:29:07] to do what she needs to do and he says
[1:29:10] Hey Esther if you don't do this you
[1:29:12] think you're not going to make you don't
[1:29:13] think you're going to get scot-free so
[1:29:15] here she now has to Botha must approach
[1:29:17] the king or his death to all of her
[1:29:19] people
[1:29:22] and so the 13th of a Dar was the day
[1:29:24] that was set
[1:29:26] and it could have been a day of mourning
[1:29:28] and sorrow
[1:29:30] Esther
[1:29:31] she had to pondered out she fasted
[1:29:34] she said is this you know you got to put
[1:29:38] yourself in Esther's shoes
[1:29:40] she was going to open the door
[1:29:42] and she didn't know whether she was
[1:29:45] going to be
[1:29:46] the last moments of her life or their
[1:29:49] life would continue on
[1:29:51] and so she had to go through that
[1:29:54] crushing in her mind and her spirit
[1:29:57] what must I do and she fasted and she
[1:30:00] fasted
[1:30:03] but she was willing to do everything for
[1:30:06] her people
[1:30:07] and she came out of those days of
[1:30:09] fasting
[1:30:10] and I love the words
[1:30:12] and I love brother Benny Gandy who sings
[1:30:14] it if I perish
[1:30:16] I perish
[1:30:18] but I'm going
[1:30:20] before the king amen she was willing to
[1:30:23] do everything it took she put it all
[1:30:26] behind her she says whatever I'm gonna
[1:30:28] lay it all down on the line I pray that
[1:30:30] that's where you can get this morning
[1:30:32] whatever it takes I don't really care
[1:30:34] maybe you've had to have some days maybe
[1:30:36] you have to have a few days of fasting
[1:30:38] but may it not be too long where you can
[1:30:40] say no I'm gonna be like Esther I might
[1:30:42] not have come before the king for a very
[1:30:43] long time because it had been a span of
[1:30:45] time you might have a very cold walk

[1:30:53] have She haven't really prayed

[1:34:38] had epilepsy she was trying to get to
[1:34:40] Jesus because she knowed he had healed
[1:34:42] others oh why couldn't he heal her
[1:34:44] daughter so after she had left her
[1:34:46] everything she had and got to him and
[1:34:48] then this disappointment says I'm not
[1:34:50] sent to your race I'm only sent to the
[1:34:52] children of Israel
[1:34:54] can you imagine can you imagine
[1:34:58] the moment there she is at the feet of
[1:35:01] she just whatever she had to do together
[1:35:02] everything brother Branham said she left
[1:35:04] it all behind the scorn of the people
[1:35:06] her husband leave her who knows what it
[1:35:07] is that all went down she just knew I
[1:35:09] have to get to Christ he is the answer
[1:35:11] to my son's my daughter's problem my
[1:35:13] child's problem and she just gave it all
[1:35:15] and here she is and he says I'm not sent
[1:35:17] to you
[1:35:18] I'm sent to Israel
[1:35:20] and he just ignores her
[1:35:23] I tell you what would you do
[1:35:28] foreign
[1:35:30] says you know what
[1:35:33] that don't stop her faith
[1:35:38] oh that's how you know she was a child
[1:35:40] of God something inside her says she's
[1:35:44] going to press through her face was set
[1:35:46] Like Flint no no he's the one I need she
[1:35:49] was willing to Humble herself to the
[1:35:51] lowest of the lowest of the lowest that
[1:35:54] is where we have to go you got to get
[1:35:55] Pride out the door you got to get
[1:35:57] everything behind you wow what did the
[1:35:59] preacher say about me tell you you what
[1:36:01] no no no no no no he called her if you
[1:36:04] want to go forward a dog
[1:36:06] that is the lowest in Jewish a dog it's
[1:36:09] it's the way down there at the depths of
[1:36:11] the bottom right he says oh no she
[1:36:13] pressed right on again she addressed him
[1:36:15] as son of David he wasn't a son of David
[1:36:16] to her but when she said Lord that was
[1:36:19] different
[1:36:20] she come in the right way oh Lord have
[1:36:23] mercy Lord you owe me this Lord you owe
[1:36:25] me that no no no Lord have mercy on me
[1:36:32] sometimes all times we need to base
[1:36:35] ourselves to the word of God
[1:36:38] not what our thoughts think about it not
[1:36:40] what our idea is well who does he think
[1:36:43] he is to tell me that no no no no if she
[1:36:46] had said that she would have walked away
[1:36:47] and had an epileptic daughter still
[1:36:50] I said what happened
[1:36:52] but she respected and based herself to
[1:36:56] the word of God and said you know what
[1:36:57] she said
[1:36:59] he said another thing he says you're
[1:37:00] nothing but a bunch of dogs I'm not sent
[1:37:03] to you look what that poor little woman
[1:37:05] had done and the things she went through
[1:37:06] everything she had to press to get to
[1:37:08] him and then when she got to him he said
[1:37:09] I'm not sent to your race and you're
[1:37:11] nothing but a bunch of dogs Oh my he
[1:37:13] said but she was persevering why she had
[1:37:17] faith
[1:37:19] she said yes Lord
[1:37:21] yes she agreed of course she had to
[1:37:24] agree he was the word and the word is
[1:37:26] always right the word is truth no matter
[1:37:29] what she said yes Lord I'm a dog
[1:37:31] whatever you say I'm there but even the
[1:37:34] dogs they just get that little crumb
[1:37:37] just a little bit from the master's
[1:37:39] table that's all I need I I am whatever
[1:37:41] you say the word is true I am I am I am
[1:37:45] a lie the word's true but I'll take just
[1:37:47] a little crumb I'll just take that
[1:37:49] little bed that's all I need and oh God
[1:37:52] honored the faith this is oh my goodness
[1:37:55] how could he turn away from that and her
[1:37:58] daughter was healed from that day amen
[1:38:01] that's the level that we need to be to
[1:38:03] press through all of it how how low we
[1:38:06] must go how whatever the word says we
[1:38:09] put ourselves in subjection to and say
[1:38:11] hey Lord whatever you say if I can't
[1:38:15] even imagine in that moment there as he
[1:38:18] says that you're just like a bunch of
[1:38:20] dogs to me oh that's humility
[1:38:23] yes
[1:38:24] but Lord I just need to grow
[1:38:27] I just need a little crumb
[1:38:30] she wasn't a hybrid
[1:38:32] she had Thoroughbred strength and Grit
[1:38:34] as did the thief on the cross you know
[1:38:37] he did everything
[1:38:39] it took in that moment
[1:38:41] here he was
[1:38:42] for whichever reasons God gave him that
[1:38:44] time and his eyes opened I actually
[1:38:47] recognize who was there and here he was
[1:38:49] on a cross at what state I don't know
[1:38:52] almost dead
[1:38:55] almost
[1:38:57] moments away minutes away I don't know
[1:38:59] where he was
[1:39:01] and here he is hanging there trying to
[1:39:02] keep get his breath very difficult to
[1:39:04] get your breath as you're on a cross
[1:39:06] crucified
[1:39:07] that's the whole point is to basically
[1:39:09] suffocate they die without as they sag
[1:39:11] and they can't hold themselves up it's
[1:39:12] terrible and here he was at the worst
[1:39:15] time that you could imagine and it would
[1:39:17] pick everything in him to try and get a
[1:39:20] little bit out
[1:39:22] and you might feel that someone might be
[1:39:24] spiritually just almost at the limit
[1:39:26] right at the very end you feel I'm
[1:39:28] almost I'm almost lost I I just feel
[1:39:31] like there's there's no more I can't go
[1:39:32] another day if God doesn't doesn't all
[1:39:35] hail me or God doesn't mean me he was
[1:39:36] there on a cross and God opened his eyes
[1:39:39] in that moment and he did everything
[1:39:41] that he had it wasn't he goodness one
[1:39:44] thing he did a lot all that mattered was
[1:39:46] some breath but it was everything he
[1:39:48] could do to get it and he pushed himself
[1:39:50] up and he said oh remember me that's all
[1:39:53] he had to say
[1:39:54] that's all you need to say everything
[1:39:57] that you would need to do is oh God
[1:39:59] remember me
[1:40:01] that's all he needed to say he says
[1:40:04] today you'll be with me in Paradise it
[1:40:08] took everything he gave it all at the
[1:40:10] right moment
[1:40:12] at the right moment amen
[1:40:15] why
[1:40:17] why do these ones in the scripture have
[1:40:20] the ability to do that why
[1:40:25] because inside them
[1:40:27] inside them got deposited
[1:40:30] a seed
[1:40:33] because again if God went all the way
[1:40:36] and achieved what he needed to achieve
[1:40:38] and gave everything he had he's placed
[1:40:40] it inside of you and I the ability the
[1:40:44] drive the determination the ability to
[1:40:47] set our faces Like Flint
[1:40:49] and go all the way amen it's because
[1:40:54] it's a seed that has power inside to do
[1:40:57] whatever is required to reach the Final
[1:40:59] Destination as we've said in different
[1:41:01] times the little blade of grass that
[1:41:02] could come up and burst forth past all
[1:41:06] the concrete and all that would lay on
[1:41:07] top of it and that little blade seeks
[1:41:09] why because it's looking for light and
[1:41:11] it's it's the water the words brother
[1:41:12] Brown speaks about he says you can't
[1:41:14] hide life amen You Can't Hide life if
[1:41:18] it's inside of you it's gonna burst
[1:41:19] forth amen the scripture says and in
[1:41:23] second First Kings it talks about the uh
[1:41:25] Elijah that was just all he was
[1:41:27] wrestling after caramel and all these
[1:41:28] great you know this great victories and
[1:41:30] he's like I only am left
[1:41:33] you know the scripture I'm only they
[1:41:35] seek my life but you know what Jesus you
[1:41:37] know what God said he says I have left
[1:41:39] me
[1:41:40] seven thousand in Israel all the needs
[1:41:43] which would not would not have bowed to
[1:41:45] Baal and every mouth which not have
[1:41:47] kissed him and in Romans it said Paul is
[1:41:50] speaking and he says oh but what saith
[1:41:51] the answer of God to him I have reserved
[1:41:53] to myself seven thousand men who have
[1:41:57] not bowed the knee I can tell you in
[1:41:59] that time it was an easy time to live
[1:42:01] they were hunted and they were found out
[1:42:03] and here they were living in caves and
[1:42:04] they were they were they were all hidden
[1:42:07] and such and even Elijah didn't even
[1:42:09] know all about them but they were there
[1:42:11] they were there God said I reserved them
[1:42:13] why because he placed something inside
[1:42:15] of them to not cut do not bow to not
[1:42:18] kiss the image of the god of that day
[1:42:20] you know what the god of that day was it
[1:42:22] was a sensual God bail
[1:42:25] you tell me what the God of this day is
[1:42:28] you tell me what the God of this day is
[1:42:30] God is placed inside of you he reserved
[1:42:33] seven thousand in that day he's reserved
[1:42:35] a people that will be hidden in the
[1:42:37] cleft of a rock that is going to come
[1:42:39] again came against the the gods of this
[1:42:42] wicked day and they will not kiss the
[1:42:44] image they'll not bow to the image
[1:42:46] because inside of them God has placed a
[1:42:48] little God Particle he says it's
[1:42:50] impossible for you to Bow it's
[1:42:52] impossible for you to kiss the image
[1:42:55] because inside of you is the same thing
[1:42:57] that was at the user Phoenician woman
[1:42:58] that's going to go everything she's got
[1:43:00] in the same thing in you that was in
[1:43:02] Naaman that said oh do I got to go all
[1:43:04] the way yeah he did all the way seven
[1:43:06] times he had to go you're willing to go
[1:43:09] every inch of the land
[1:43:12] happy
[1:43:16] amen
[1:43:23] you're God's Elite
[1:43:27] you're God's Elite
[1:43:29] I'm going to close
[1:43:34] musicians can make your way
[1:43:37] you know
[1:43:40] there's a we all know the elite armies
[1:43:43] of the day
[1:43:44] and we have these different play
[1:43:47] battalions or whatever groups that are
[1:43:50] the mightiest the SAS and all these
[1:43:52] things they're the elite of the world
[1:43:54] the elite Warriors of the world
[1:43:56] you know
[1:43:57] so these the Navy Seals they're one of
[1:43:59] these top Elites
[1:44:01] and they go through what's called hell
[1:44:02] week
[1:44:03] forward they're training hell week
[1:44:08] I wonder
[1:44:10] if we're in
[1:44:11] what would we consider
[1:44:14] this age
[1:44:15] When Death Rides
[1:44:17] that fourth seal
[1:44:19] and here we are they train super
[1:44:22] incredibly to try and get through
[1:44:24] 200 miles and they they run 200 miles in
[1:44:28] just one week
[1:44:29] they sleep for four hours 20 hours of
[1:44:31] physical training but
[1:44:33] you know whatever they all go through to
[1:44:36] get there
[1:44:37] one thing defines everybody that goes
[1:44:40] through the training
[1:44:42] and they have
[1:44:44] what they they have that hangs in the
[1:44:47] main Square
[1:44:48] of the main training area or the
[1:44:50] Gathering area it's a big Bell
[1:44:52] and it hangs there it's a big Bell and
[1:44:54] it sits in front of everybody
[1:44:57] and if you want to quit
[1:44:58] you have to go to the Bell
[1:45:00] you have to ring it three times Bang
[1:45:03] Bang
[1:45:05] and you place your hat
[1:45:07] training army hat on the ground
[1:45:10] and you walk off
[1:45:12] and you've quit
[1:45:15] and as the training goes
[1:45:18] hat upon hat gets added the Bell
[1:45:21] continues to get wrong
[1:45:24] and up to 80 plus percent
[1:45:27] ring the bell
[1:45:30] but one fellow said the one thing that
[1:45:31] defines everybody that goes through
[1:45:33] sealed training
[1:45:34] is that they didn't ring the bell they
[1:45:37] didn't quit
[1:45:40] it was it wasn't it so while it was
[1:45:43] important to be physically fit
[1:45:45] and all the training that you have to go
[1:45:46] through you find out though quickly says
[1:45:48] your background your social status your
[1:45:51] race none of this matters
[1:45:54] the only thing that matters
[1:45:56] is that you go in with purpose in mind
[1:45:59] and this that you are just not going to
[1:46:04] quit no matter what happens
[1:46:09] you know and there they are these are
[1:46:11] natural Elites that have something
[1:46:13] inside of them to willing to go all the
[1:46:18] way they just have they've something is
[1:46:20] there it's their makeup is a little bit
[1:46:22] different willing to go no matter what
[1:46:24] now how difficult and it's difficult to
[1:46:27] where they're dragging their carcasses
[1:46:28] somehow or their buddy is dragging them
[1:46:30] somehow just so they can get across the
[1:46:32] line for the day it's grueling it's
[1:46:34] difficult but something inside of them
[1:46:36] it just won't allow them to drag
[1:46:38] themselves up as much as somehow the
[1:46:40] battle in the mind just go ring the bell
[1:46:42] no I can't remember just go ring the
[1:46:44] bell if you just put your hat down there
[1:46:46] it's all over the pain is gone the agony
[1:46:49] it disappears you can be free of this
[1:46:51] wretched hell week and just go home
[1:46:54] ever had that mind battle
[1:46:58] just throw in the towel you can't do
[1:47:00] this no longer you think you've got
[1:47:02] another day left you can't do it but
[1:47:06] something inside you
[1:47:08] something inside of you because you're
[1:47:11] God's Elite in this day and age and
[1:47:13] there's some God Particle inside that
[1:47:16] just drives you on I just can't ring
[1:47:18] that Bell it's impossible for me to
[1:47:20] throw in the towel why because you're
[1:47:22] Gods he has dropped inside of you a seed
[1:47:25] that is going to grow and manifest in
[1:47:27] this day exactly what God wants say oh
[1:47:30] God I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:47:31] through it well Humanity goes through
[1:47:33] some crazy things people have dragged
[1:47:36] themselves through Wicked situations
[1:47:37] broken bone situations for miles and
[1:47:40] miles the human the natural being has
[1:47:43] something inside some people one fella
[1:47:46] fell 75 feet shattered his hip his femur
[1:47:49] and dragged himself for for eight miles
[1:47:52] through Creeks through streams just to
[1:47:54] get to a little home to get shattered
[1:47:56] body I don't even know how he did it
[1:47:58] something inside this guy he had a
[1:48:00] determination he had whatever you want
[1:48:02] to call it Inner Strength inner grit
[1:48:04] inner determination I don't care he had
[1:48:06] it that's natural there is something
[1:48:09] inside a Believer I don't know what you
[1:48:11] want to call it but I call it God I call
[1:48:13] it a seed of God that is planted inside
[1:48:16] of you that your face is set Like Flint
[1:48:19] and you say I don't care whatever it
[1:48:21] takes I'm gonna go and see my king
[1:48:25] amen
[1:48:27] amen they say well these different ones
[1:48:29] they say they shouldn't be alive well
[1:48:31] spiritually maybe some of you think well
[1:48:33] I just shouldn't be alive spiritually
[1:48:35] but you are
[1:48:37] you are
[1:48:38] you're here you're still fighting
[1:48:41] because God placed it in you
[1:48:44] it's not I that runeth but him
[1:48:48] may I say you know they have a Seal Team
[1:48:51] Six you know that they're the special
[1:48:53] ones
[1:48:55] we have Seal Team indeed may I say Seal
[1:48:58] Team seven that will overthrow this
[1:49:01] wicked generation
[1:49:03] amen I pray today we got fathers I pray
[1:49:07] we get mommies we get children I don't
[1:49:10] care teenagers I don't care who it is we
[1:49:11] need a resolve inside that we would set
[1:49:15] our face as a flint on the word of God
[1:49:18] no matter what goes on in this day and
[1:49:21] age do not lose your vision of Jesus
[1:49:26] hey man
[1:49:27] and you say Lord this morning
[1:49:29] I'm willing
[1:49:31] I'm willing
[1:49:32] you did it for me
[1:49:34] I'm willing to do whatever it takes
[1:49:36] I don't know what that looks like
[1:49:38] you know what that looks like I don't
[1:49:40] know the battle you go through I don't
[1:49:42] know where you're at in your life
[1:49:43] he called me you sit in church
[1:49:46] some have been here many many years
[1:49:48] some just recently
[1:49:50] I don't know
[1:49:52] but whatever you do I say don't leave
[1:49:54] the service this morning until you have
[1:49:57] resolved in your heart you have gone
[1:49:59] through those those moments of fasting
[1:50:01] in prayer that Esther did and she says
[1:50:04] I'm willing
[1:50:05] I'm going
[1:50:07] whether it's death or whether it's life
[1:50:09] I'm doing it all and may you come to
[1:50:11] this point
[1:50:12] and I wonder
[1:50:14] if we actually want him
[1:50:16] as much as he wonders us
[1:50:19] he was willing to do it all
[1:50:21] I said Lord may I show in my life
[1:50:25] every aspect of it
[1:50:27] that I'm willing to do whatever it takes
[1:50:30] the song
[1:50:33] that I pondered many that I that I love
[1:50:39] if someone writer wrote it down
[1:50:46] it says there's a voice calling me
[1:50:49] from an old rugged tree
[1:50:52] and it Whispers
[1:50:54] draw closer
[1:50:56] to me
[1:50:59] I said Jesus
[1:51:00] it's calling this morning
[1:51:03] and he's whispering to each one of you
[1:51:05] this morning
[1:51:06] I pray you could just take a moment and
[1:51:08] actually just quieten yourself and say
[1:51:10] Lord because he whispers in a still
[1:51:12] small voice
[1:51:16] and the songwriter penned down at
[1:51:18] Whispers to me
[1:51:20] leave this world far behind
[1:51:23] there are new heights to climb
[1:51:27] he's willing he's Desiring
[1:51:30] he wants to take you further deeper
[1:51:33] in him
[1:51:35] but he's saying I'm whispering to you
[1:51:37] but are you willing
[1:51:40] to do what it takes
[1:51:44] the verse is say take my houses and land
[1:51:47] change my dreams
[1:51:49] and all my plans
[1:51:52] you know I've had that happen to me
[1:51:55] my dreams and my plans really got
[1:51:57] changed
[1:52:02] because it's my desire to do whatever it
[1:52:05] takes
[1:52:09] for placing my life in your hands
[1:52:11] the disappointments come
[1:52:14] lonely days without the Sun
[1:52:16] and through sorrow more like you
[1:52:20] I become
[1:52:24] I'd like to sing that this morning more
[1:52:26] like a prayer
[1:52:29] as we would maybe just personally just
[1:52:30] bring ourselves right into just our own

[1:55:09] the will of almighty God in our lives
[1:55:11] Lord and whatever you acquire of us Lord
[1:55:17] no matter what the situation if it's a
[1:55:19] Seer Phoenician who is seemingly Lord
[1:55:22] ignored but Lord willing to go all the
[1:55:25] way
[1:55:26] Lord that we would subject ourselves to
[1:55:28] the very word of God
[1:55:34] that's what Lord
[1:55:36] we're willing to do Lord I pray this

[1:55:57] Lord we have resolved no longer to
[1:55:59] linger and Lord what a what a strength
[1:56:02] it is to see different ones Lord in our
[1:56:04] congregation that have been doing that
[1:56:05] over the years Lord and Lord we can look
[1:56:07] at them as young people and younger
[1:56:09] families we can look to different ones
[1:56:11] that are in the congregation that have
[1:56:13] indeed set their face like Flint Lord
[1:56:14] and we can be strengthened by their walk
[1:56:16] with God but Lord May the younger
[1:56:18] Generations Lord that raise up thee our
[1:56:21] children Lord can see this and or not
[1:56:23] get caught up in the times in the age
[1:56:24] but they also would have the same
[1:56:27] resolve the same desire the same passion
[1:56:30] for the kingdom of God I pray Lord may

[2:01:46] takes
[2:01:48] these are our brothers and sisters that
[2:01:51] are carrying this gospel

[2:02:04] cushy building cushion chairs
[2:02:08] somebody is out there holding the word
[2:02:10] of God

[2:02:19] said that shouldn't even exist it still

[2:02:27] we need to do
[2:02:29] in our area

[2:02:40] break my will God
[2:02:43] break my desires whatever it takes like
