The victory at last. Will isn't it wonderful to be nearing the shore. Amen. Getting close. Praise God. Amen. We're going to go to prayer at this time. I'm going to ask brother Glenn Grun. Brother Glenn, if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. and uh want to be praying continue to pray for uh our sisters in the hospital. The Lord would just touch her. Understand she's gone in for emergency surgery. Just want to be remembering her this evening in prayer. And if you've got a need, if you're listening in on the internet, you've got a need, just lift your hand to the Lord. Amen. Our God knows what your need is even before we ask. Amen. Glenn, if you'd come, let's bow our heads. Precious heavenly father, we come to you once again, God, being a needy people, Lord, desiring, God, first of all, you come in our midst this evening, Lord, to speak to us in a special way, Lord, as you so graciously did this morning for us, Lord. And we also uh are thinking of our sister Megan, Lord, in the hospital &gt;&gt; hearing that uh there's trouble again, Lord. I just pray that you'd come on the scene, Lord. God, uh have your perfect will in her life, Lord. And Lord, be with those that are with her now, Lord. Give them, Lord, your mercy in their lives, Lord. God to just trust you, Lord, to &gt;&gt; just trust your perfect will in her life. Lord, I just ask you raise her up, Lord, as we prayed this morning. We're going to continue to pray this way, Lord, that you'd raise her up for your glory. And Lord, we just commit her life into your hands now, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; and Lord, once again, we just count it an awesome privilege, God, to be in your house this evening, God, in your presence. And Lord, we desire once again you'd speak to our hearts, Lord. Draw us into heavenly places, Lord. Bring us closer to you, God. For we know that our time is short here, Lord. You're preparing your bride to leave this earth, Lord. And I just pray that you'd come this evening in a special way. Speak to our hearts, each one individually. Lord, I pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have your seats. Brother Ryan has got a song for us. And uh just one announcement. Um you'll notice, oh, some people have a uh this seat is reserved for me. I got one of them, right? Cuz when I'm up here, I need to have a place that I can go and sit down. But if you've got one of those, uh you need to put it down at the beginning of the service. It doesn't allow you to come to service late. So, Brother Alex is gonna I haven't talked to Brother Alex, but you know, if you see those green things sitting there between services, Brother Alex, you just pick them up. And I talked to deacons about it. And uh so, so uh if you if you get here, right, you're coming here, that's what I do. I come here and I go and I put my little green thing down and then it's safe for that service. And if I'm not here, then it doesn't take a place. And so, uh if you've got one of those green things, just take it home with you after the service. And then when you get to service here, you can put it down and that saves you a seat when you're here. But it doesn't save you a seat here, you know, all the time. So, uh, it's just when you're here and if you get to service in time enough to get a seat. So, um, is that is that a good idea? People with little green things are going, "No, no, now I have to come here early." But everybody else in the same boat and uh so uh so I think it's a good idea because I'm subject to the same rule. So &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ryan, I don't usually feel to dedicate a song a certain direction. Um I just fear that the Lord puts a song in my heart that the people that are to be blessed by it will will be regardless of whether I say anything. Uh just to give a little bit of a history behind this uh the chorus in the first part of the song uh came after Silas's passing when I was in Israel and I got the phone call and uh I was extremely burdened for the family and some of the young people. I'm close to a lot of the ones who were uh very affected by it. And uh that evening as I was just in prayer for the family and so I just was so burdened I couldn't even really pray anymore and I didn't have any words to say and I just sat there in the Lord's presence for a moment and then I just began to sing and the chorus to this song just came out just with no prior thought. It just kind of just came out at that point and I felt to come home and sing it but I wasn't finished with it and the Lord wouldn't give me the rest of the verses up until yesterday after sister Megan had gone into the hospital and Megan's close to my family and it just came I think the Lord needed me to experience that before he could give me the rest of the song. So it was more even more personal to myself and it's called you are God and it just speaks about how the Lord does all things well even when we can't understand. And that's what we're resting in at this time, even as she's in surgery while we're here tonight. So, the devil's tried to hit me with a bit of a cold, but I'm going to sing it anyway, and I hope that you'll be blessed, even if my voice isn't where it would usually be. So, God bless you. [Music] When my heart is tested and my strength is all but gone and in the times I wonder, how can I carry on? When my steps grow heavy and the suffering clouds my view, Lord, I still trust in you. Deep within my being, there's a calm I can't explain. A blessed sweet assurance that's deeper than the pain. For I have found a comfort where no comfort could be found, holding me fast and sure. You are God [Music] and I am [Music] Lord, you do all things well, even when I cannot understand. And though my heart be torn and my spirit weak, still is your face that my soul shall seek. I know [Music] you are God. It truly does matter how dark may be the night. You said that you'd be with us. However hard the fight and deeper than the loss we feel is the peace that you bestow. Lord, you do all things well. And if there's one thing I know, you are God. And I am Lord, you do all things well. [Music] me there when I cannot understand. And though my heart be torn and my spirit weak, still tears your face. Let my soul shall seek. I know [Music] you are God. You are holy, holy. Your ways are higher than mine. You are rightous. You are glorious. And your ways are higher than mine. You are holy, holy. [Music] Your ways are higher than mine. Holy, holy, Lord. You are holy and you are God. [Music] I am. And Lord, you do all things well. Even when I cannot understand. And though my heart be torn and my spirit weak, still tears your face that my soul shall seek. I know. I know. [Music] And I believe you are God. I know you are God. You are God. man. He is God. There's nobody like him. No God like him. Amen. And we have a privilege. It's a real privilege to be able to serve him. Amen. You're all I want. And we'll return the service to to the word as brother Ed comes. It's number 1027 on the screen. And those who sing in the chorus, you can sing it. Let's stand together as we sing it and just sing it to him this evening. You're all I want. [Music] Heavenly Father, you're all that I need. Lord, we worship you in the beauty of holiness. for what your word has done for us. We hide it in our hearts. We will not let the enemy steal away. You're all I want. Heavenly Father, you're all you're all I want. You're all that I want. every [Music] we worship you in the beauty of holiness. [Applause] [Music] We hide in our heart. We will not let the enemy steal away. You're all I want. Heavenly Father, you're all the prayer of my heart. Lord, you're all I want. You're all I want. Heavenly Father, you're all [Music] we worship you in the holy name for us. [Music] I let the enemy [Music] ste away. You're all heavenly father. You're all [Music] Amen. He's all we need. Wonderful Lord Jesus. Well, I trust you had a good day and you're ready to receive some more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer together. How gracious and loving Lord Jesus. It is indeed uh our privilege, our honor to be able to come before you. We wish and desire to come humbly, realizing, recognizing our frailty. Lord, we're depending entirely upon the Holy Spirit. Each person needs the Holy Spirit. And we pray, Father, that those that have not been filled will be filled. Those that have been filled will be filled again. one baptism but many fillings. Fill us, oh God, until we're overflowing. Fill us until we affect someone near us. Oh God, fill us until we affect the community. Fill us until we shine. Oh God, let the glory of God shine on our countenance. Shine through our vision, our seeing. Oh God, shine until our conversation is changed. And people can tell by the way we speak we've been with Jesus. Lord, I pray you'll hear our prayers. And and now, oh God, just come, I ask, and take the words and I pray you'll give enlightenment to each of us as we have need of in Jesus Christ's name, we receive now the not only engrafted word, but the anointed word. For this is your breath, and I pray it'll be breathed out upon every life for your glory. Amen. Amen. Well, we want to start with the same scriptures that we read this morning. I don't believe we can possibly tire of them. And uh once again, you can keep your Bibles if you would at the ready because I have a lot of scriptures and it will be good if you can turn to it. It will be good also if you have a piece of paper you can jot it down. I think that uh you know I recommend that because that's what I do. I like to when God speaks to me I like to remember it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you ever put a good idea down? You get a good idea say that's great. Uh well sometime if you don't it just it's gone like that. You have that problem too. Well I had it today. I was just driving out of here and driving down the road and thought that's wonderful. Ah, can't possibly forget that. By the time I parked my car, I'd forgotten it. So, you know, don't don't trust it to your memory. Trust it to a pen and paper. After all, God put it on paper. Cuz once it down on paper, it always says the same thing. Amen. All right. In Isaiah the 9th chapter, we're we'll read verses six and seven once again. And now you'll have the emphasis on his government. For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given. And the government shall be upon his shoulder. And his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, and the prince of peace. Of the increase of his government, and peace there shall be no end. upon the throne of David uh and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. There's so many uh so many relative things that we can make reference to in our in our natural life and we could spend a whole evening on uh on those things which are comparisons and I like to bring in a number of them because uh you know we relate to them right away and then when we when I can bring something you can relate to and say Oh yeah, that you know I understand that. And then bring it into the scripture. Then you can understand where the Holy Spirit is is leading us in in the scripture. And I think that's helpful. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I really believe it is. And so when we speak of uh uh you know of government, it's not the government so much that we have some problem with. It's the people who are in government is where we have problem. And fact is uh brother Brandham even says about say nuns or about that go into the uh to to give themselves to the church or priests that give themselves to the say the Catholic church. He said they don't go in there to be bad people. They go in there to be good. They go in there because they have a desire to do do good for the people. A lot of people, I mean, the presidents and prime ministers and whatever more when they, you know, when they tour the country and make all of their uh establish their their platform for their government, this is what we intend to do. And I don't believe they intentionally intend to get up there and say things that are untrue, but then when they get in the system and the it's the system that corrupts, &gt;&gt; the system always corrupts. And if you bring a system and try to make the word and bring it down and reduce it into a system, it'll be corrupted because man gets his hands on it. Then you see and so these people find themselves in some very very difficult places. And so now just to make that a relative statement uh if we talk about historically you know we could talk about United States and George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and nobody has any problem with them now but they had a big problem with Abraham Lincoln back then because somebody got up and shot shot him and assassinated him and so there was certainly a problem with him. They they speak of Jesus today. Oh Jesus. You know, everybody uses their name either in vain or uses it lovingly. Don't don't forget that name bore a lot of reproach back there. And not everybody who stood on stood on the side of the trail was in favor of that name of Jesus Christ. And so and that's always that way. We even talk about you know Charles Wesley and and the great move of the sanctification uh sanctification of the spirit. Hey, uh, even the name Methodist is it was a reproached name at the time because they they called it the new method. Oh, you that you're a Methodist because he was standing on a chair or standing on a box and preaching to hundreds if not thousands of people. He was he didn't win a popularity contest. I guarantee you. Uh, he he was put out of every pulpit in England. And that's why they had to preach on the streets because his name was so reproached at that time. And Luther today, there isn't there isn't a church in the country that's, you know, I don't think that's got uh uh the name Lutheran on it that is that is being, you know, torched or anything else. Uh but but don't forget back then they were hunting him down and he was in hiding. And so that's always the way it is. And it's that way right today. I'd say if the world will go on, if the world would go on for many, many years, people won't have the problem with the name William Brandham, he'll probably go down as as one who did more to change the face of Christianity because you cannot you cannot avoid and get away from the profound truths that have been spoken through that prophet's mouth. You just can't get away from it. &gt;&gt; And not that we want to, &gt;&gt; but the world won't be wouldn't be able to get away from it. And that's why even when you that have shared the message and you talk to people, you find that people that are completely right out in the world, you talk about serpent seed to them, they say, "Of course, of course." It's the only thing that makes sense. &gt;&gt; You know, but they they don't you don't you don't even need to have, you know, you just don't have to have barriers, but if you got barriers, then it becomes a problem. See, but people just see it, you know, and so many, many other things. All right. So now I just want to uh take and and make reference to this uh government and I would like to say regarding uh government because we're speaking of the administrative offices that God puts uh within his government because he has a kingdom. He has a government and he has also allocated or allotted certain abilities to certain persons for a certain time. Yes. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; God has allotted. He's he's he's allotted. He's actually given a certain ability to a certain individual for a certain season. And sometimes now that when that season arrives, whether the people are accepted or not, that's irrelevant for my message tonight. But when that season arrives, God stands behind that individual and it becomes abundantly evident that they have an unusual place. They have a special calling. They have they could the world can say, "Well, they're gifted or they're a powerful ministry or this or that or the other thing." And it doesn't have to be a powerful ministry, but God in a certain place, it might be relatively uh small in its influence, but you can say that that's a godly person. That's a godly man, a godly woman. and God has raised them up for a specific purpose. But in in God's government, in his kingdom, he has raised up certain offices. Now, there are offices like we're going to be speaking about the high priest. Uh the first high priest that we know of is Aaron. And then there's been high priests all the way through the centuries until when Jesus was before uh the judgment the high priest was was there was another high priest there uh Ananas and and he was in power I believe at that time and then there so there's been high priests all the way along when one died another one had to come up and they had a certain function that they were to discharge but God had a God had he had uh given and I want to say this carefully. It wasn't necessarily the man but it was the office that was uh that was regarded because God had designated the office with a certain level of authority and a certain level of respect. You remember when Apostle Paul was being questioned and everything else and and then he said to this man, he said, "You whited wall &gt;&gt; when they smoked him &gt;&gt; and then and then they said, "Don't you respect the high priest?" And he he apologized said, "I didn't know that this was the high priest." See, but nevertheless, he didn't take back necessarily what he said. But he should not have said what he did to that particular office because you got the man and he was a whited wall. &gt;&gt; But then you got the office and he was in the while he was in the office, he he deserved more respect than that. And so now let's just reduce it down to you and I that are here tonight. When you become when you become a son or a daughter within a certain family at the human level in the human community, you have certain rights that belong to you. Your your parents even your parents or your employer is not to abuse you. You have certain rights. You have rights of freedom. You have rights of protection. You have certain rights. Those are your rights as a as a human. Now when you become a son or daughter of God, you have certain rights which I'm going to come to later on and you can make a certain claim according to those rights. And we have when uh when when when Satan came to Jesus in what is called the great temptation, he did not say he did not say ah there's no son of God. What a this is a lot of nonsense. A son of God who ever thought that God would have a son. He he didn't say that. He said if thou be the son of God. &gt;&gt; So he was questioning his sunship or his office. &gt;&gt; If you're the son of God, then do these things. &gt;&gt; Turn turn, you know, turn make these stones into bread, etc. If you're the son of God, you have to realize that, and this is extremely important, you have to realize that God has endowed the offices with a a certain privilege and a certain authority. When you go in prayer to pray and you're coming against the powers of darkness, you need to know where you stand. &gt;&gt; You need to know who you are. You need to be able to say, "Satan, I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; I come in that position. I have that post. I have that position. &gt;&gt; I don't know. You remember when when when brother Ron Spencer gave part of his testimony how he fell out of that building, fell onto the concrete, broke the bones in his body, was completely shattered, rushed him into the hospital, and then called for his father. Incidentally, you'll be seeing brother Charlie Spencer and his wife, Ron's father and mother are coming to the camp this year. They're going to be here also. Sister Connie, her mother and father are coming. I mean, there's four people that are real warriors of God. And brother, brother Charlie Spencer, I love that man. And you'll see when he comes here why I do. I've known him since 1978. Yet, I've never preached in his church. He's never preached here. But we just have such a bond and such a oneness. I just love his spirit. and he came into the hospital and you know doctors today are very very very open they don't want to give any false hopes and when when brother Charlie Spencer came in and the doctor said to him he said I want you to know Mr. Spencer, your son will never walk again. And brother Charlie Spencer said, "Sir, you just don't know who you're talking to." &gt;&gt; He said, "I am a son of God." &gt;&gt; And he walks into his into his son's bed. And and Brother Ron said he'll never forget the words that his father spoke to him, but they were similar. And he said, "Son," he said, "I'm a son of God and you're going to walk out of this place." &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what happened in not very many days hence. I say, "Glory be to God." &gt;&gt; It's it's absolutely critical that we know who we are. &gt;&gt; That would not not just, you know, to to make some empty confession, but to know exactly who we are in God and be able to exercise that authority. Brother Brandham said, "Of all the wonderful gifts that Jesus had, he never used any of them in defeating Satan, he always used something that you and I have full access to, and that's the word." Every time he just said, "Thus sayaith the word." &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; All right. And so they with we have these certain offices in place and they operate whether you're aware of it or not. &gt;&gt; They have a scheme here in Canada. It's called a Canada pension plan. I'm smiling because it it works for some people, not so well for others. But anyway, we have a Canada pension plan. It it might buy gas for your car, but that's about it in Canada. Isn't that right, brother Paul? You have to excuse me. I'm going to enjoy this evening. I don't know how it is. You have your 401k down in this down in the States. And let's hope it's going this way instead of this way. But anyway, everybody is is planning for the retirement. I'm going to be coming from left field quite a few times tonight. Uh, and and while you're sitting right here, I don't think anybody here, at least I hope not, has been sitting here this evening thought, "Oh, my retirement. I sure hope I sure hope it's working for me. I hope the Department of Finance is doing their best for me. Don't count on it. But there is a department that's working there. Even though while you're sitting here, you're not aware of it, &gt;&gt; but it's supposed to be there working for you." Why? Because the government, not the government we're talking about, but the government is in place and they've got a department of finance. And part of that department, they've got an administration there that's supposed to be looking after your retirement. &gt;&gt; And let's hope it works. Do you know something? I tell you what, the office of MelzDC &gt;&gt; is the best retirement program. &gt;&gt; And you may not be aware of it tonight, but that was what has been instituted. And that is why brother Brandham in the end time had to speak about Melzdc because he was without beginning of days nor end of life. &gt;&gt; And that's your retirement. And you may not even be conscious of it tonight, but God has already put your retirement in place. &gt;&gt; And your retirement isn't to retire in a hole six feet deep. &gt;&gt; Your retirement is one. Your retirement stands in the promise of God. Because I live, &gt;&gt; you shall live also. &gt;&gt; That's our retirement program. Thank God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't depend on some program that this government has. We got another government. We're from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; And so these things are in place. And then then to become effective at a certain time, these offices have been established. I need to say all of these things as as we we move along. These offices have been established for specific functions and certain positions and under certain they have a certain function in a certain under a certain jurisdiction. Now uh I I just want to read a few notes that I have here which I have put down. Governments are a collection or a conglomerate of offices established or set up to administer the various functions of government. You can't take the department of immigration or a problem of immigration to the department of finance. You can't take a concern of legal matters involving the justice system to the department of highways. You said, "Well, I said that this morning. I need to say it again. Each have their specific realm of responsibility and authority to discharge their required duties. &gt;&gt; Yet all of these offices represent one government. all of the offices that God has established from a son of God, a daughter of God to the offices in the ministry, five-fold ministry to those ministries of helps which are also in the written in the in the Bible to those those were women that ministered to the Apostle Paul and ministered to Jesus Christ. All of those offices and ministries have a certain and a specific they have a specific uh position and place that God has given them and they all represent one government or one kingdom, &gt;&gt; one God, &gt;&gt; even though there are many of them and there are many that men have made to almost like replicate what God has, &gt;&gt; but they're they're man-made. It doesn't speak of popes and it doesn't speak of cardinals and doesn't speak of overseers and a lot of these things which which man has made because he has elevated people into certain positions by his program. God has a program and that program is that God raises a person up in their season in their at their time. He endows them with a certain talent or ability or gift. And now it's not everyone who's gifted is necessarily called, but he backs that up with a with a a something that's divine. It becomes evident that this is a supernatural thing that God is doing in this life. &gt;&gt; Now I want to speak on his government. Says his government &gt;&gt; and that's what the Bible speaks of. His government shall be upon his shoulder. The offices and the administration of his government. Now, God has ordained certain men for specific responsibilities. If this sounds like I'm repeating, I am, but I want to just enlarge it a wee bit. And he has given them the authority to carry out their duties. I don't believe even as Moses we'll just refer to Moses I'll refer to Abraham refer to the apostle Paul I'll refer to brother Brandham and I believe that that will be sufficient but when Moses even raised his objection to God he's slow of speech he can't really deal with you know this and the people won't believe me God didn't change his mind even though he was raising up objection that he would not be be able to discharge this enormous responsibility of of taking this whole host of people out from under a superpower and deliver them to a promised land. He just felt he could not do that. And one was that he was slow of speech. And God did not change his mind. He said, "Well, go and talk to your brother because he can speak and have Aaron do it." God didn't change his mind. And here we are hundreds and hundreds of years later and the man Moses, what he spoke remains absolutely steadfast today. &gt;&gt; If Moses was thinking for a moment, you've got to lead this people out. But God wasn't really telling him, Moses, I'm going to send a word through you, and that word is going to be imposed upon billions of people, not millions, not hundreds of millions, but billions of people down through the centuries are going to read your words &gt;&gt; and are going to be true then. And when Moses said and Moses had to say because it was it was truth at that time. Moses was the meakest man in all the earth. &gt;&gt; And that word still holds true today because the word of God can't. Are you following me? One man, Abraham, would be the father of the faith for both a natural seed and a spiritual seed until a until a messenger in in our time would speak about faithful Abraham, the royal seed of Abraham. Why? Because it still stands true. And Abraham wasn't just of his family, not just those that came out at at his time, those that he saw and and those that he became a part of, but Abraham, what I'm I'm bearing out to you now is is once God selects a person and and sets them out to do a a certain task to fulfill in their life, it's impossible for you and I to ascertain or to try to determine what the effect of our life is going to be in the whole scope of eternity. How are we ever going to know that? &gt;&gt; You think that God can't keep track not from not only from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Joseph and on the way down the patriarchs and come on on down. You think that God who knows every flea and every how many times it bats his eye and how much tallow it makes. That kind of a God can take the effect of your life and trace it down for hundreds of years and centuries of years and keep an accurate account of it and give you a reward for it on the other side. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, by the time it ripples on down, it's going to be just an absolute minute uh a minute amount of of effect. How do I know? You know, that's none of our business." God keeps the books. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the Bible that I believe in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One man, Abraham. One man, the Apostle Paul. And talk about knowing where a person stands. Uh here's what Apostle Paul said of himself. For I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles. I magnify mine office. He had to indeed know who he was. You know, Satan is such a a deceitful person. He gets us as believers even to cower at our position. I would love to see a church rise up &gt;&gt; that knew exactly who they were &gt;&gt; and would not cower at it what at any time any time of the day or before any person. I am a son of the living God. I'm a daughter of God. You girls in school should be able to throw your shoulders back and be proud. I would tell my girls when they were in high school, listen, they may say snide remarks about you while you're in school. They go home and wish they could live like you. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And we as believers of this message, one thing that we certainly do not want to be, we don't want to cower or for a moment be ashamed. And that's not a false pride. It's not that. It is a it is a a such a an overwhelming joy &gt;&gt; that God has called us into this kind of a life into this kind of a calling into this kind of a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he hasn't only called you into it. He has anointed you not for some past generation but for this generation. There's not a reason there's not an excuse for anybody to say well I I I feel weak or I don't have. You may feel weak, but I can assure you if you are a child of God and God has called you to this season, to this time, he's equipped you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To overcome, to withstand anything that will come your way in this generation. He didn't leave you weakened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's given us exactly what we have need of. And for the Apostle Paul to be able to say, and it doesn't say that everybody roared, "Amen." And all the Gentiles said, "Yay and amen." He said it because he knew it. And even they were opposed to it. That didn't change it. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham said many, many times, you believe me to be God's prophet. He had to know he was God's prophet. Because even the even the angel said, if you get the people to believe, not believe in God or do you believe that Christ was born or do you believe in in Easter time? Do you believe in the resurrection? That wasn't what had to have him believe that he had been sent by God as God's prophet to this age. &gt;&gt; And when they believed that on him whom he had sent, &gt;&gt; then they could they were he said it depends on where you this where you think this come from. &gt;&gt; Said if you believe it's of God, &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from. &gt;&gt; If you believe it's of Satan, then that's the reward will come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the administration now of the high priest. Let's just talk about the high priest for a few moments. Now you can turn if you would in your Bible to Hebrews the 5th chapter. So we're talking now about the administration these various offices and I can only speak of a few. All right. In Hebrews 5:1 for how many high priests? For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for who? &gt;&gt; It's ordained for men. So a high priest is ordained for men in things pertaining to who? &gt;&gt; God. So now you get the picture very clear. A high priest, he has a he's has an office. He has a p position. He has a certain jurisdiction. He's acting on behalf of God for men. &gt;&gt; That he may offer, here's his work, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. &gt;&gt; That's what a high priest's office position is. This is his jurisdiction. This is something that God has ordained a high priest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, what if a person hasn't got a high priest? &gt;&gt; What if they haven't got a high priest? &gt;&gt; What if God designated uh do you think that Aaron was the only high priest? In fact, is today I can tell you over in over in Asia, they've got high priests in Tibet that you hear so much about the monks and so on and the priests, they've got their high priests. We were in India and they had not only high priests but they had high priestesses, women and that one that wanted us to kneel in front of this fellow. There's all kinds of high priests. All kinds of priests. But they will not be they are not given a position by almighty God to offer gifts and sacrifices on behalf of the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people may give themselves, they may give their money, may give all their time, they may walk for miles such as they do in many places. And they offer they offer animals and I've stood in front of the doors in Nepal where the blood of goats was over the door exactly like in the in the book of Exodus. I I looked right through the little door and here's a it's all red from the goats. Animals have given their life absolutely empty in vain. It's only uh it's only uh uh trying to repeat or duplicate what is in the Bible. &gt;&gt; So, we're not the only people that have a high priest. And here here we have uh the whole church world that read and they believe in a high priest and read the scripture. Who did she touch? Uh you know, we have we have a high priest that's touched with the infirmity of our feeling. It's touched with the feeling of our infirmity. We have that but then it becomes evident that somehow the sacrifice is not res received. &gt;&gt; That's right. All right. I just leave you thinking about that. Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sin. Now, I'd like you to notice, please, that it's all Christ's doing. Whether it's a priest office, a king's office, a pastor's office, a a uh evangelist, teacher, whatever, a deacon's office. It's it's it's all Christ doing. It's God doing. It's like one government. &gt;&gt; You have the finance and you have the justice department. You have the highways and you have the you have the lands and forests and you have the parks and you have all of these. You have the immigration whatever more all different very diverse very specific very controlled &gt;&gt; but one government over it all and the government shall be upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; He has a government friend. I want to rise this up above just a sermon. I want to rise up to a doctrine position. This is a doctrine of the Bible. This is his government. He has a government. And we talk about brother Brandham. Let me tell you, let me tell you my position about brother Brandham right now in the context of this service. That was part of the government of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's part of the government. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A very very uh uh uh shall I say a a a very much empowered a very senior post &gt;&gt; in the government. the senior position in an entire generation, one messenger to this age. &gt;&gt; And that's where people dig in their heels. But those that are receiving it, they receive it with joy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we come under the benefits. &gt;&gt; There's benefits. And there's benefits that flow to us. Even when you're sleeping and you know nothing about it, there's benefits. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think of you young people that are brought up in homes where your mother and father and as long as you keep the order of the home where you love your father and your mother and you honor your father and your mother and you respect the God of your father and your mother. Do you know that you fall under those benefits even though you may not be aware of it? You fall under those blessings. We're sitting here right today, this evening, in this whole in this country, in America here and in Canada. We we we we just have all kinds of blessings and benefits that come here. We have the police to protect us and we got a fire department that'll run to us. And we got an ambulance service that go and get you and and we got hospitals that go and treat you. And all of these things, all of these benefits, you don't even realize it till you need it. And then you run and you find out it's all there and it's in place and much of it is paid for &gt;&gt; their benefits part of the government. Well, who paid for the police? And who paid for the fire department? Who paid for all of this? Well, the whole people and the whole public and out of their tax uh uh tax monies have paid for it. But I'm glad that we got it paid for. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that we have it today. &gt;&gt; Two Sundays ago, you may not know it. I I don't think I showed it when I got here to preach, but I got here to the pulpit. I just arrived to the pulpit and I just got a call just as I was coming to the pulpit that the fire department was on their way to my home. Now you're quiet. He said, "What did you do?" I came here and I said, "I I for a few moments I had I didn't know maybe my home's in a total blaze. I came here to the pulpit before I came in this door. I said, "God, I was called here to preach. I'm going to forget if that thing goes to ashes. So be it. I'm coming here to preach your word. &gt;&gt; I don't know what's going to happen." So instead of my home going down to ashes, I got a $90 invoice for a false call. So I was happy to pay it. But somebody paid I tell you what, they couldn't send that whole fire department and the police and everything else for $90. That's a bargain. Don't you think so? I tell you have those kind of people, you know, all equipped and everything else right there with ladders and everything and several men and several police and all the rest of it. I tell you what, any time of the day, I'll pay that. $90, Brother Toby. It's good country. It's all working even while we don't know it. &gt;&gt; We're sitting here. We got these benefits. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, uh so I say it was all Christ doing. It's just different people and different gifts at different times. Now, in Luke 16:16, I'll just read it because it's just one verse. For the law, Jesus said, "The law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and everyone pressth into it." &gt;&gt; That's a very revealing in the context of what I'm speaking. says the law and the prophets were until John. But now the gospel is preached. And the Bible says Jesus began to preach. The Bible says John began to preach. You don't find that terminology in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; It's New Testament terminology. Not because not because they were afraid of those words. It didn't fit the call in the Old Testament. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have the burden of the word of the Lord that came and to this prophet or that prophet and they spoke they spoke as as prophets of God and that was how that was the order that God had put in place back there. But now you have and John began to preach. It's it's a it it's it's a different you can see that there's a whole different uh aspect of the same gospel and the law and the prophets where until John I wished I had this up on the I didn't have enough time to prepare this in slides. I would like you to have be able to read it with me visually. For the law and the prophets were until John. Notice the word since that time something's changed. The kingdom of God is preached. So the kingdom of God was not preached in this manner prior to that. Not in the Old Testament the way it's now being preached and every man pressth into it. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us, and I'm moving along as quickly as possible because I have quite a ways to go. The Bible tells us about Peter being the one being the one given the keys to the kingdom. And now he uses the key. And the day of Pentecost, as I said this morning when I was closing, Jesus said to the uh apostles, don't go and preach. Don't go until you're endued with power from on high. Go and tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power. Why? because God was going to empower them for this new function as it were to administrate the gospel of Jesus Christ and to demonstrate it in power. Don't go until this comes upon you. And the Bible says in in Acts the 2 chapter verse 38, we always go to that now. He says, "Then Peter said unto them, repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, you shall receive and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." This is not a recipe for baptism. Peter in his office in his apostolic office is administrating he's he's administering the authority of his office and he's telling them under the authority of his office he's been endued now by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is punctuating the word through him repent &gt;&gt; and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and he's prophesying and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Holy Spirit. Many people perhaps have been to this tank but don't realize that you are under the jurisdiction of that office. &gt;&gt; That office is still effective today. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brandham, he couldn't even go any other place because he was a word prophet. Had to come right back to that. I want you to see it's not just a recipe for baptism. &gt;&gt; That's not what it is. It's not just some nice words. Oh, repent and be baptized. Every one of you shall receive. This is some kind of formula. It's not that. This is something that has come from the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This didn't come from Washington DC. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have much confidence in it. It's not come from I'm not come from Ottawa. I'd have perhaps less confidence in it. You might say, "Well, I'm not being patriotic." I am patriotic to the kingdom that I'm a citizen of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have far more far more confidence in that than I have in the constitution of this country because that one works. &gt;&gt; I find a lot of failures in this one. &gt;&gt; There's people that are trying and I and God bless them. God bless the leaders. God help them in in their to discharge their duties in in in a way that's honorable and with integrity. But on the other hand, I have a I have a constitution of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And that kingdom, it can never fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That kingdom is in another realm. &gt;&gt; That kingdom is in the unseen realm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it has many diverse offices. And God, the author, the the leader, he has endowed these various offices with the authority to discharge their duties and make the thing happen. And I tell you what, if you can see that coming on down, you'll see yourself in a different light. You'll say, "I'm from that kingdom." You won't have to put a swatch on your on your on your shirt or on your jacket identifying you with a certain nation. You want to be able to say, "I'm from another kingdom. I come from another country. I'm not of this world." &gt;&gt; As Jesus said, you're of this world. I'm not of this world. &gt;&gt; You're from below. I'm from above. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our leader said that. &gt;&gt; Our Lord said that. &gt;&gt; Is there any reason why you can't say that? I'm from above. I'm from another kingdom. Hallelujah. I'm from a kingdom with eternal life. &gt;&gt; I might look different because I am different. I sound different because I am different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm from a different place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My goodness. I have I just so in and gripped and enthused with this. &gt;&gt; Amen. regarding this building that God has been doing. &gt;&gt; And I said this morning that we are God's building &gt;&gt; on two fronts. We are the building in that God is doing the work and we are the building because God owns it and dwells in it. &gt;&gt; We are God's building. And Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:10, according to the grace of God &gt;&gt; according or to the measure according to the grace of God number one that's been given to me. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Once you get in this channel, friends, once you get in this channel, you'll find it all through the scripture. Do you know why the scripture worked? Cuz those men believed in who they were. Those women believed in who they were and what God had called them to. &gt;&gt; And the sooner that we wake up, the sooner that this becomes a part of us, it'll work different for you, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you find yourself stumbling along, then come to this kind of preaching right tonight. Hallelujah. You're children of the kingdom. [Music] according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder. I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon, but let every man take heed how he buildth thereupon. In the message trial, brother Brandham says, "Out of the skies come this cloud coming down speaking these words. As John the Baptist was commissioned to forerrun the first coming of Christ, your ministry will forrun the second coming of Christ." &gt;&gt; Is that any different? &gt;&gt; That's right. That's Bible language. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You hear the Apostle Paul, according to the grace of God that's given to me, I'm a wise master builder. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't have to cower and and and and say that in some weak manner. &gt;&gt; I'm glad that Brother Brandham didn't say it in some weak manner. Well, if God will hear me, that wasn't it. &gt;&gt; This is what God said. If I can get the people to believe, &gt;&gt; if I can get the people to believe, nothing will stand before my prayer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not even cancer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's a message of our kingdom. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? That's a message of our kingdom. &gt;&gt; And it has come to the right office. &gt;&gt; It has come to the right person. &gt;&gt; It has come at the right time. &gt;&gt; And it has come to the right people. We're the people &gt;&gt; that was sent for us to hear. &gt;&gt; We talk about these lights and the phenomena and thing on Sunset Mountain and the word that came and the cloud and all these things. It's not just to have a picture of. That's to realize that God sent that. God showed that in the heavens for me, &gt;&gt; for you &gt;&gt; to let you know that this that this message came with an authorship &gt;&gt; and it came with authority. &gt;&gt; And it came it came from a department. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of the government, &gt;&gt; his government, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, not some corrupt government, a government of truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; My wife has a wonderful She has a wonderful phrase. It's a kind of one of her pet phrases. She says it all the time. Said, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if everybody just had to wake up tomorrow morning and everybody had to say exactly the truth?" Everybody. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? Could you imagine every politician in the world getting bound instantly by some power that would grip them that everybody had to say absolutely the truth? &gt;&gt; I've been asked once in a while, how does this look on me? Oh, it's hard to be truthful. Well, quite frankly, it looks terrible. No, it looks wonderful. It just looks great. You know, you go and see a salesperson. Do you ever see a salesperson come in and you try something on, they say, "Nah, you just look terrible in that." No, no. Says, "That looks great." Of course, they're getting a commission. and our religion, our gospel, it's not just a, you know, everything's fine, everything's fine. No, that's why brother Brandham had to say very harsh things. &gt;&gt; Do you know why it's truth &gt;&gt; is truth. &gt;&gt; How we live, how we dress, how we speak, how we preach had to be truth. in the message uh taking sides with Jesus. Now I'm I'm dealing with this. Are you tired or can I carry on? &gt;&gt; Now I I want to approach in just a few moments. Sometimes these offices uh you'll find one person fulfill two offices &gt;&gt; and that that becomes dangerous especially in the in the natural world because uh I even read the the the state of North Carolina has has outlawed it. They've outlawed one official, elected official filling two offices because they're afraid of, you know, cross purposes and working with conflict of interest. And so they've outlawed it. Uh, at least that's what I pulled up and looked at. I know here in this province some years ago they the uh premier of the province took over the position of minister of finance as well and that was some bit they did that because there was a short period of time and for whatever reasons internally but and there was some some concern about that and it was in the newspapers that the premier should also be minister of finance and people were not very comfortable with that. And so some sometimes you have this, but God has on occasion had a dual office, but very very seldom do they have a dual office. So I want you to think about that now for a moment. Listen as I read in taking sides with Jesus. He says, 'I believe the Lord has used me in little special things to help maybe lay a foundation for a prophet that will come. But a prophet doesn't operate the way I operate. Now you know that a prophet isn't an evangelist. An evangelist isn't a prophet. A pastor isn't an evangelist. And an evangelist isn't a pastor. But God has set in the church, first apostles, then prophets, then teachers, and pastors, and so forth. God set them in the church. God gave them in office. &gt;&gt; But he says the morning when I laid the cornerstone now he said if you're spiritual you get it because of the cry of the people. &gt;&gt; He said if you could break out of your take take the book and read it. It said do the work of an evangelist. Didn't call me to be an evangelist but said do the work of an evangelist. For the time will come. This is why he said do the work of an evangelist. Didn't call him an evangelist. Do the work of an evangelist. For the time, and this was the reason, for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but will heap to themselves uh teachers having itching ears and shall turn from the truth to fables. So in the great mind of God, he had a purpose in telling the messenger do the work of an evangelist. Now uh in this you just have to help me. I hope you're able to receive now. Okay. in this uh subject of of of a dual office uh when a when a a person comes to marriage now I don't want you to think of a wedding we have here as such but I want you to think of the marriage of the bride and the groom and I'll just use a natural one to compare with a with a spiritual one because the marriage of the bride of Jesus Christ is something that takes place prior to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; We're all clear on that. &gt;&gt; All right. I personally believe that was brother Brandham's ministry to wed the bride to Christ. I may be going out on a limb. That's what I believe. I believe the message, the invisible union of the bride of Christ. That invisible union was a marriage ceremony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're wed here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you expect we could go at any moment you're going to the marriage supper, you have to be wed before you go to the marriage supper. &gt;&gt; And he says the wedding takes place here. &gt;&gt; He also said that his ministry was to introduce the bride to Christ &gt;&gt; and Christ is the word &gt;&gt; and we have been introduced to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you see it as a book, I feel sorry for you. If you see it just as a series of books or tapes or so on, I feel sorry to me. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; The word Christ has been restored. &gt;&gt; The word Christ has been revealed in the day when the son of man is revealed again. He was revealed &gt;&gt; and there's a converging of the offices. Right now, now we'll just take a couple coming down the aisle here to be married. How do you do, sir? Are you a husband? No, I'm not a husband. What are you? I'm a bridegroom. Oh, all right. Are you a wife? No, I'm not a wife. What are you? I'm a I'm a bride. But if you just hang around a little while, I'll change offices. &gt;&gt; And one is kind of almost overlapping into the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Okay, now here we go." And do you take this man to be your wed husband to live with him through thick and through thin? I'm I'm improvising now. Do you take her through all the trials of life? Do you take her? I do. Are you are are you husband yet? No, not yet. But just hang on. It's just overlapping. &gt;&gt; I'm just leaving one and going into the other one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you a wife yet? No, I'm not a wife. But just just stay here. Stay alert. Just wait for a few minutes. And finally go through the vows and exchange the rings and Oh, it's getting real close. Have you changed office yet? No, not yet. But it's I I can feel it coming on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. like they asked me to take that wedding and maybe told you about it. These are things I've experienced and I'll come back to this in a moment and take this wedding and brother Jeremiah said, "Uh, a couple here want you to marry them." I said, "No, no, no. I'm just here to preach." No, they want you to. So, anyway, they decide to have a wedding right after the morning service. And while I'm sitting on the platform, having got up to preach yet, he came over to me. He says, "There's another couple to be married." I said, "Well, what's their name?" name. He said, "I'll go and find out." And he couldn't find the first bride's name, too. He had to go and find out her name. Now he had to go and find out the second one's name. In the meantime, I got to do the I got to do the vows on the fly. Hey, and then I'm concerned because, you know, Brother Brandham even talks about the uh the morals that they have and the the kind of ceremony and their culture over there. head and shoulders above ours. And right away I'm thinking, you know, I'm gonna say I now, you know, pronounce you to be husband and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the congregation waits to click the cameras because that's when the groom kisses the bride. And I I was was I going to say that in a strange country? Oh, not on your life. So I I I I'm I'm waiting for them. They're singing. They're singing songs. Have you ever heard this before? &gt;&gt; That's good. And they're singing altar songs down at the cross where my savior died. And I'm trying to get into wedding spirit, you know. And they're singing, you know, all these alder songs. I surrender all. Of course, that was just going to happen in a few minutes, too. [Laughter] And nothing's happening. and the and the and the big table that I preached on is sitting there and some chairs up behind it and I I'm waiting for somebody to rearrange this thing and about 400 people 450 people there and so I said to the brother sitting beside me he's from Malawi and I said to him is somebody going to you know uh fix things up here oh he rolled his eyes you know he says oh brother Bisclly said if anything's going to happen I think you're going to have to do it so so while they're singing alder calls I'm moving the table out of the way and getting the chairs all arranged and trying to remember the vows at the same time. And I want to say a little few words of instruction to the people. And there's a big old theater and big curtains behind me, big velvet curtains about back where brother John is. And and I see strangers coming in. And then I see the people of the church, you know, moving out of the seats here. And I thought, "Oh, wow." You know, there's friends coming. There's family coming. And uh I thought I better go and have a look. We've been about half an hour. I better go and have a look. So I go and part these great big curtains and here's all these two couples all lined up and these girls are in beautiful white gowns and the men are in tuxedos with white gloves on. I thought, "Oh, this is not what I expected. These guys are dressed to the nines." The only thing they didn't have on was spats. And so I decide I better go back there because I've got to clear this thing up. I don't want to get myself in some terrible situation. So I go to this brother. I've never seen him. His name's Brother Daniel. I said, "Brother Daniel," I said, "Your culture is completely different than ours. In our country, when I pronounce a man and his bride to be husband and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in our country, the groom takes and he embraces and kisses the bride. Do you do that in this country? And his eyes went about this big around. And he just rolled his eyes. He says, "No, but it's coming. [Applause] it was coming, but I just didn't know how close it was. And so when I pronounced him to be husband and wife in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he was just exactly like a robot. He just went and put his arms up like this, turned around, put them around her, and give her a jerk. And that was all there was to it. Now, it didn't depend on the kiss. It didn't depend on what he did. But at that moment, she transferred &gt;&gt; from bride to wife &gt;&gt; and he transferred from groom to husband and their offices. They walked up in one office and walked out in another. Furthermore, they walked up under one spiritual jurisdiction. There are certain laws and certain things that are spoken of how a young man and a young woman should court one another and they're completely another set of laws on husband and wife. &gt;&gt; And the and the rules and the the whole everything changes and they walk out under completely different office. &gt;&gt; Have I made my point? Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, there'll be an an office that will be instituted just for a season. And when the season is over, it's all done. &gt;&gt; And on other hand, as it is with a high priest, it goes on and on and on and one dies and on comes another and on comes another. But it is it is so structured in the Bible. And I hope I hope that you can stay with me. Are you following me? All right. &gt;&gt; All right. this dual office. And the Bible says, take your Bible if you would and uh turn to uh Hebrews the 7th chapter. And if I get this through then I'll I'll feel that I have uh accomplished what I really want to do. Now, you have to have to understand, you know why it's hard here? Because I'm on page four and my last page is page 20. I won't keep you. For this high priest, for this MelzDC, verse one of chapter 7, for this Melzdc, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham, returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him. Now, brother Brandham calls Abraham God's prophet. God calls Abraham his prophet. When IMC was going to take his wife, even God spoke to him and said, "You have Abraham pray for you because he's my prophet." So, you have an office of a prophet. You have the office of a king and you have the office of a priest and all of those. And God comes to uh his prophet on earth. Now, stay with me real close. Now, God comes in a theophony form. And a theophony, I have all the quotes here, is something that could appear and disappear. &gt;&gt; It's from another realm. &gt;&gt; Can appear and disappear. &gt;&gt; They are here right now and you're not aware of it. Your theophony body is right one breath away from you, but you're not conscious of it. Maybe you are now that I mentioned it. And that the message has said so and the apostle Paul has said so. If this body be if this tabernacle be dissolved, we have another Aeonian eternal in the heavens. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we have that, right? But you're not conscious. You can't feel it, but it is here. &gt;&gt; Now, you are here in the physical realm under certain jurisdiction. You're controlled by the laws of the land and and the laws of humanity and the laws of human rights and all of these things. But in that realm, don't think just because you can't see it that it doesn't exist, that it doesn't. They are under a certain mandate. &gt;&gt; And the authority comes from that kingdom &gt;&gt; and it is effective whether you recognize it or not. &gt;&gt; Just like you don't know what's happening with your retirement. Well, it's just there someplace. No. And the kingdom of God, it's not just some uh, you know, nebulous thing that's out there. It's a reality. Even though you can't see it, it's real &gt;&gt; and it is it has an authority that goes with it. And so now Melzdc, please just stay with us. This is very very close to my heart. So now God in the form of Melzdc comes as king of Salem, king of peace and priest of the most high God. and he meets Abraham coming, this is strange, coming from the slaughter of the kings. &gt;&gt; So those those are the main factors in this. And now you have a dual office and you can't find that in the scripture. You won't find it while Jesus was here. It was very very specific. He was the son of man and he was prophet and when they when they tried to make him king as I said this morning he we he refused that because that was not his office and even brother Brandham makes a very strong point when the woman who was a Samaritan woman now because this is an important part of this she she didn't have any claim on him when a when a Jew when the blind man said Jesus thou son of David have mercy on on us. He responded to them because they had a claim on him as a son of David. &gt;&gt; But the Samaritan woman did not have a claim on him as son of David. And she cried, "Thou son of David, thou son of David." And Jesus didn't even as much as respond to her. &gt;&gt; And the disciples were saying, "Keep her quiet. Do something with this woman. She's disturbing the meeting." And finally in her desperation said, "Lord," &gt;&gt; and he turned right around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's how critical it is one office from another. She had a claim on him as Lord, but not as son of David &gt;&gt; because to her he was not son of David. And yet and yet within a certain uh within a certain confine because then when the Hebrews when the Jews tried to make him and put him officially into the office of king, he turned it down. He went and hid himself and escaped from them because it was not the season for his kingship. &gt;&gt; Now we come because there are things that had to take place. The things that had to take place is the gentile era. &gt;&gt; The gentile period had to come. The Jews had to reject him and crucify him and then he would turn to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; And he would come in another office to the Gentiles. He never came as son of man, as prophet to the Gentiles. But he came he came as a priest. And the gospel would go to the Gentiles of this Christ that came to save us from our sins. This Christ that came to heal us of our sicknesses. This Christ who is our high priest who's touched with the feeling of our infirmities. And we began and the gospel spread over the earth. But at the end at the end at the last age comes the last messenger and he is given the position and in his ministry we could stay here a long time and I don't want to do that but in his ministry he speaks to church ages and then he speaks to seals but in the seals before he comes to the first seal, he comes to the breach. And in the breach is chapter five. And you'll go home and you'll be able to read that. I want to lay enough down so you'll get it. In chapter five, and maybe you can take your Bible and read read along with me. Revelation chapter 5. I'll be about another 15 minutes and I'll close. And I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. couldn't even look thereon. And I wept much because no man because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book, neither to look thereon. This is the book of redemption. And John is weeping. Brother Brandham said because all was lost if no one could claim this book. All of the entire creation, everything was lost unless it could be redeemed. And no man was found worthy. Think of it while we're reading this now. And right when we're in this same chapter, at the end of the chapter, John is commissioned to go and take the John is commissioned to go and take the book and to eat it. And he wept much. End of verse four. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not, behold the lion of the tribe of Judah. Just stop there for a moment. Who is that? King. &gt;&gt; That's the king. The lion of the tribe of Judah is the king's office. &gt;&gt; So this office now comes into view. Don't we? John knew who the lion. He knew the lion of the tribe of Judah was the king. &gt;&gt; The lion is always king. &gt;&gt; Lamb is always priest. And eagle is always prophet. &gt;&gt; He's prophet, priest, and king. &gt;&gt; He's eagle uh lamb and lion. He's all of those. He's prophet, priest, and king. So he says, "Weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth. Now, you just look this way for a moment. And some of you have been here. I've I've touched on this before, but now in the context of this service, in the context of this subject, these two offices coming together, they happen in Genesis and it happens in Revelation. And they're coming to a strong angel or a strong messenger. Christ has come to a strong messenger. And the Bible says, "And I saw in the right hand," he says, "I saw," and John says, "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &gt;&gt; who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof." Do you know, brother Brandham comes to this very Now, remember a moment ago, please just hold your attention. A few moments ago I said people that use the name William Brandom and they say a man and a ministry etc etc. Do you realize that that was a God ordained before the foundation of the world? And not just that a certain man would come at a certain season, but under a certain office with a certain authority for a specific time to deliver a specific message to a specific people that would be alive at that time. And God knew every one of you would be here at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. And now he sends that under that jurisdiction. It's it's under the government. The government that was on his shoulder. The government of the kingdom of God. The government of whom he is king. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God sends this messenger at this time with this message to bring it to to deliver it to this people. And it happens to be a prophet's office. &gt;&gt; The world recognizes it. I mean the religious world people, we didn't shun it. We heard of it 50 years ago and right away recognized this is God's prophet. But we didn't know about Malachi 4. We didn't know about Revelation 3 and 14 and 15 that there has to be a messenger to the church to the Leodysain church. We didn't know that. But it all the pieces started falling together. &gt;&gt; It wasn't something you had to try to manufacture. They just started falling together. &gt;&gt; And so now when Abraham was here in in Genesis, here's Abraham. He's a man of promise. He happens to have the word of God. And God comes to him. &gt;&gt; If you hear me, you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God comes to him. God comes to his prophet. And then a little later, God comes to his prophet in two offices, king &gt;&gt; and priest. &gt;&gt; Doesn't happen again in all the scripture to the end time. And now comes a prophet &gt;&gt; unlike any that we have seen. And he's standing and God is confirming. God is showing, I have established this office. I've established the one who's in charge of this office. I've establish the one that I'm using. I won't change my mind. I won't use anybody else. I'm using this one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll reveal the secrets of the heart. And if they don't hear the first sign, the voice of first sign, they will hear the second. For I'll make you to know the very secret of their heart. Did it happen? Yes, it happened. You have,00 tapes telling you it happened. &gt;&gt; And now he's coming to the end of his ministry. &gt;&gt; And God comes to him and Revelation five he takes and you'll read it in the breach. Revelation 5 now which also it speaks of Boaz and Naomi and Ruth because that is the account of redemption. &gt;&gt; And incidentally, oh my, I could keep you here a long time tonight and I don't want to. But in the in that account of redemption, the thing that happens in with Boaz and Ruth especially is that they change offices &gt;&gt; from widow &gt;&gt; to bride &gt;&gt; to wife &gt;&gt; and he goes from bachelor &gt;&gt; to bridegroom &gt;&gt; to husband &gt;&gt; and that's a trans that's a thing that transcends in that message &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham takes it in uh in the breach because also in the breach he has he said John I I I have it here perhaps I can just find it for you. &gt;&gt; John is looking for uh he says I want you to notice the fifth chapter when he looked at it. This is in Revelation the fifth chapter uh part part two revelation series. Weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, these are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. Brother Brandham says, "A lamb." Why didn't he see the lamb before? The lamb had been seated on the father's throne inside the guards. John couldn't see in there. He only seen those four beasts standing there, those four cherubams standing there guarding the holy place. Now, it showed it was not a natural beast, a lamb, because it took the book right out of out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne. And the lamb couldn't do that. He said he was a lamb. It was Christ. In other words, his attributes, he was meek and gentle as a lamb. And and continuing in the breach, he said, "The lion, a symbol of the tribe of Judah, has prevailed. He's overcome." And when he looked around to see where the lion was, he saw a lamb, &gt;&gt; says the lion has prevailed. &gt;&gt; And he turns to see the lion &gt;&gt; and he sees a lamb. Both those offices converging right there. &gt;&gt; And now at the end time as a prophet standing on the earth. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One to whom the word comes to &gt;&gt; and now begins to unveil that heavenly scene &gt;&gt; in the unseen realm. Are you with me? Yes. &gt;&gt; And as he begins to unveil it for the first time in history, uh we have this strange arrangement. Uh weep not John. And the and the prophet is describing why he's weeping. He's weeping because everything's lost. All creation's lost. All redemption's lost. There's no hope. And so he's weeping. And then the one speaks, "Weep not, John, for the lion of the tribe of Judah, the king's office, has prevailed to take the book and to loose the seals thereof." And he turns to see this and he sees a lamb &gt;&gt; because the lamb is priest &gt;&gt; and the lion is king. And at the end time, here's these offices coming together because now a prophet, a messenger is on earth and has to have this particular office on earth at the converging of these offices because the the office or the position of the lamb mercy. Do you know that they're going to call for mercy and there won't be any? &gt;&gt; Why? Because God is bringing is is going to cause that department to cease. Excuse me for using secular terms, but you understand there's a certain office &gt;&gt; I've called I've called I've called uh government agencies sometimes and said I you know I have a certain certain thing I wanted to this oh no that department's closed. &gt;&gt; We don't do that anymore. I I I've gone through that. How many of you remember Robert David? Bob David? Brother Bob David. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lots of you. You know, when he died, all his stuff came to my garage. He had no will, no documents, no nothing. I got all of his stuff in my garage. And over weeks, I'm going through everything trying to find out. We try to go overseas, ever he's lived, has he ever been married? Does he have any children? Has he got any relatives? We can't find anybody. Has he got any other bank accounts? Anything? We can't find anything. I'm going through his things one or another. Here's here here's a cashier's check for $6,500. The same as cash just stuck in some old billfold. Here's another check I find for $800 written to him from somebody in California. Stale dated now because it's over six months old. And uh and and so I have to call uh who who takes charge of this when nobody has a will. Nobody has any relatives. No, the government takes it. So, I had to actually deliver all of this to the government. The government got about 16.5 thousand or about $16,000 from his assets, the sale of his assets. And I had to get permission from from the uh the authorities to give his red volume books said, "Yeah, they said go ahead and give it to his friends." So, here I am. I'm a little Joe boy for the government and I give the red books to, you know, the believers who want the red books. I hand them all the money, make all the arrangements, and I said to them, I said, you know, can we give this man, can we give him something than uh above a a poppers funeral burial in just a cloth rather than just in a cloth box that the government pays for? They said, "Yeah, there there's there's plenty here." You know, it was a woman. She said, "Yeah, go ahead." So, we had a nice burial for him and it was maybe about $3,000 for his whole entire funeral. And that's cheap. You must know that. And about four months later, I got a phone call here to the church from the funeral home and they said, "Who's going to pay this bill for about $1,600 and some dollars?" I said, "What are you talking about?" They said, "Uh, for the funeral of of Bob Harvey." I said, 'Well, it was all arranged. It was all paid for. The government's supposed to pay that. No, they said they only pay the minimum. They only pay about $1,500 and the rest, he said, 'The church will have to pay it. I said, not a chance. I gave all this money to the government. So, I said, "Just a second. I'll call them." I called it. I called them. Hello? You know, for the estate department, etc., etc. They said, "Oh, no, no, that department's been changed. the it doesn't exist anymore. And the government's changed the whole program and they're they're handling it under another office now. And they got other regulations and they wanted us to pay $1,600. Well, I guess you can guess the result of that. I didn't pay it. Do you think I should have? No. They had all that money. I said, "You pay it." And not only that, your your officer who's authorized told me to go ahead and I went ahead and did what you told me to do. Now they tried to say, "Oh, no, that office has been closed." Do you know that you had this world has heard a prophet messenger a prophet? You have if you haven't heard it before, you're hearing it tonight. He's saying clearly and it's Bible language. They will call for mercy. And it will not be there. &gt;&gt; Do you know why? Because the office is closed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know that there'll be no mercy at a certain time? You think people are going to, "Oh, I'm sorry. The office is closed. I'm not going to call for mercy." They're going to scream for mercy. &gt;&gt; They're going to cry for mercy. They're going to beg for mercy. &gt;&gt; You're looking at me like that's a little strange. Do you know that Judas repented &gt;&gt; with bitter tears? &gt;&gt; Do you know that Judas went back? He went back. He returned. He took the money, threw it down the floor. I don't want anything to do with this. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says he didn't think it was going to go to that place. He tried to repent. &gt;&gt; The office was closed &gt;&gt; for him. The office was closed &gt;&gt; and he went to his place. The Bible says, let's just turn over in your Bible as I'm getting ready to close right now. I'm 5 minutes over. I'm sorry. Let's just go to Revelation 10 for a moment. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. It's Christ. Same one in in Revelation chapter one. And he had in his right hand a little book open. In re in Revelation 5, it was closed. Now it's open. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth. And he cried with a loud voice as when a what? &gt;&gt; Not a lamb, but when a lion roarth and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. Now we're we're done reading. Where's the lamb? I just want to say to you in the plain language of the as I've been speaking tonight, the office is closed. &gt;&gt; The office is closed. &gt;&gt; When you get to Revelation 10, the office there's no lamp present. &gt;&gt; There was a there was a verging of those a merging of those offices in in the fifth chapter. But when you get to Revelation 10, the office is closed. You know, I haven't got time tonight, and I've pondered about this a whole lot, but there's a lot of people out there that wish things were different, but I can tell you not very many. In my lifetime, in my lifetime, you could take and put a whole lot less energy than we put even into a Sunday service and you have people flocking and running to the altar and calling to God. Such conviction, such a pull of the spirit today. You can preach your heart out. You can spend tens of thousands of dollars and maybe only get a few &gt;&gt; that'll come. And you who God has dealt with and you have come to know Christ in the power of his resurrection and have had the Holy Spirit bring a revealing of the word to you. You don't know how to be thankful enough. You just want to you you want to thank God every moment of your life that God ever opened my eyes. There's millions. There's multitudes out there actually crying for mercy and not finding it. &gt;&gt; That's true. That's &gt;&gt; right. Because in closing, in closing, when an office closes and mercy ceases to be available, doesn't say there's no more mercy because that's an attribute of God. And mercy doesn't doesn't vacate. God changes the administration and says, "Ah, you used to get it that way, but I'm not giving it that way anymore." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Aaron's office closed. Right. &gt;&gt; And Melchazedc's office. And here the Hebrews are still trying to follow that Aaron priesthood and getting what? Nothing. &gt;&gt; And they never will get anything until God comes to them and there they will hear their prophets &gt;&gt; and God will restore the hearts and 144,000 of them will have a revelation of Jesus Christ to them. But why? Because God is going to energize and vindicate an office to them and it'll be under that jurisdiction. They will receive it. &gt;&gt; And you can give them millions of Bibles, it won't do any good. &gt;&gt; It can only come under God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope you're understanding what I'm saying. And so, Revelation 5, you have them all there. In Revelation 10, you don't have them there. In Revelation five, you have priest prophet and king in Revelation 5. In Revelation 10, there's no prophet. There's no messenger. Revelation 10:1 only speaks of one messenger and it's Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Revelation five in the breach, brother Brandham will take you to the book of Ruth and explain how all that transition happened. And in Revelation five in in in I'm sorry, in chapter two of the book of Ruth, when Boaz comes to the field, which is the world, Jesus said the field is the world. And Boaz, who is Christ, comes to the world, and they've been toiling all the day. They're at the end of the day. And the first the only one that the only one Boaz is interested in of all of the reapers &gt;&gt; that's workers in the gospel maybe great evangelist and ministries and who knows what but he only has his eye on one person and he only speaks to another person. He only speaks to one who's over all the field &gt;&gt; his servant. &gt;&gt; And he says to his servant, "Who is this maiden?" and he introduces Boaz to the maiden. And from then on, the prophet's out of the picture. You don't see him again. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 5, you have prophet, you have king, and you have you have priest. But in Revelation 10, you only have king. &gt;&gt; It's passed. &gt;&gt; It's transcended the offices from one to the other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. This thing is so real. I hope you can pick it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are under the jurisdiction. We're under the jurisdiction of not some past uh uh ministry. And I'm not referring to Brother Brandham's ministry now, but we're not under some, you know, under some churchity. We're not under that. We have received the message. Listen, listen to me now because I I I tread on on perhaps delicate ground right now. There's people within the message and all are they're just uh completely consumed with the person, brother Brandham. Oh, he did this and he hunted there and he did this and he did the other thing and you can talk about them and they'll cry and start talking about Jesus and they don't don't shed a tear. &gt;&gt; You can talk about Calvary. You can talk about all these things because they're they're they're they're completely connected to the man &gt;&gt; and they just want the man to come back. Oh, he'll come back. They missed the marriage. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; If I had a bride, I married her here and and she left this place being united being introduced to to the groom and if I was a groom and she went from here hankering for another man. Oh, if I just had if I just had him, I could hang on to him. She she has missed the whole revelation. &gt;&gt; It's no revelation that I'm her husband. When you're married to Christ, you don't need another man to hang on to. &gt;&gt; You don't need another physical person. &gt;&gt; No matter what his name is, I have nothing against any of the people &gt;&gt; of the family or any great leader or anything else. And not no person's the man. &gt;&gt; The man is Revelation 10 and one. And I saw another mighty angel Christ descend from heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And things have changed. and we are united with him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I hope I don't make enemies, but I'm not here to make an enemy. But I'm here to tell the bride of Jesus Christ, you're married. &gt;&gt; And he's your husband. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's coming now into his kingship. &gt;&gt; He's going to be king of kings. &gt;&gt; Lord of lords. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't find it in the Bible priests of priests &gt;&gt; or prophets of prophets. &gt;&gt; Nobody you hear in the Bible king of kings &gt;&gt; because that's how it concludes. And we are the people in this concluding hour. &gt;&gt; And we're under the order of MelzDC. [Applause] As &gt;&gt; I said to you this morning and closing right now with this, I closed with the I said I'll give you these two tidbits. What what is the what what's in the uh uh what is Melkazedc? What was he authorized for? What is his position? What is his jurisdiction? Well, he gave bread and wine. He gave sustaining life and stimulation &gt;&gt; after the slaughter of the kings to our father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, sure enough, I'm not going to preach a message like this for perhaps a long time. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, brother Brandham came that little servant of God and he slew a lot of the Lord's enemies. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I indict this generation &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I indict these preachers. I indict this false doctrine. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you something, friends. God backed him up. [Music] &gt;&gt; God backed him up. &gt;&gt; And I'll put it in the language of the Bible. As Abraham came as God's prophet from a great slaughter of those wicked kings, &gt;&gt; this prophet's ministry left a trail &gt;&gt; of a lot of bodies, &gt;&gt; right? spiritually dead &gt;&gt; because they rejected and crucified the same Christ all over again. &gt;&gt; And it was from the slaughter of the kings. And Melzdc come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With bread, &gt;&gt; sustaining bread. &gt;&gt; The word bread, &gt;&gt; mana from heaven, &gt;&gt; and that brought stimulation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Have you had it? &gt;&gt; Have you drank of this wine? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got it now. &gt;&gt; It isn't something we have to have. We got bread and wine now. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we're under the administration &gt;&gt; of Melzdc. &gt;&gt; You maybe don't even know where it come from, but it came from that authority. Came from that office. &gt;&gt; And another thing he had to give evidence of and bring a people under the jurisdiction. I'm closing. This is a different priesthood. You read revel uh you read Hebrews the fifth chapter, third chapter, fifth chapter, especially the seventh chapter. The other high priests, they had high priests all through the Bible. But this one raised up, ministered to the people with all his robes, everything, and he died. And the people would be reminded, I'm dying, too. my high priest died. &gt;&gt; But now here comes a high priest. &gt;&gt; And he has to have a prophet on hand to put you in contact with him because he says he's standing right here, &gt;&gt; this Jesus Christ. And if you read Hebrews, you'll find that Apostle Paul ties Melzdc directly to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Directly to Jesus Christ. And a prophet says that's Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He says another place I'm talking to the woman through the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; He said that is the Holy Spirit. That is the spirit of Christ. That is the that is Jesus Christ in another realm. Now you've got an agent. &gt;&gt; Who sees that? Who can tell where he is? &gt;&gt; Can tell exactly uh what his response is. can tell that woman's trying to believe. Uh, can tell she's missing it. Can tell it was over. That person has come back. Oh, now it's going back. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; what kind of office is that? What kind of a messenger is that? &gt;&gt; And then now is able to is able to declare according to the scripture that's without beginning of days nor end of life. And this is the office that we've come under. Uh it's one thing to believe in eternal life. I believe that I received eternal life. I believe my name's been on the book since the foundation of the world. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I believe my name's been on the on the book from the foundation of the world. But it's completely different when the one that you are believing in actually comes and confirms yes what you believed is in fact truth. It is fact and I give you the assurance. You say what is that? God reveals. God opens your understanding. God opens, he gives you enlightenment. &gt;&gt; You know, there was a man here not long ago, and you've probably read about him. He was a Japanese man. He was a he was a Japanese soldier in the Second World War. And he went into the jungles and hid. And you know how long he was in the jungles? I believe I'm correct. 34 years. And just a short time ago, not very long ago, he came out. Somehow contact was made with him. He came out and had to convince him that the war was over. &gt;&gt; And he thought the war was still on. And here he's been 34 years living in the jungles and the war is all finished. It's all over. It's finished. Do you know there's people and if Satan could he put you in a hole in a jungle and make you think that we're still at war and we still got a huge battle on and all the rest of it. And now a messenger comes and says and this is this is now news from another realm. &gt;&gt; Your war is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your war is finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We still have an enemy but he is defeated. &gt;&gt; Your war is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not a message from a from a a minister or even a prophet trying to encourage you, trying to make you happy. He's telling you a statement from the office. &gt;&gt; He's telling you a statement from the war department. &gt;&gt; I hope you forgive me for using this secular terminology. He's telling you from the Department of Defense, the war is over. &gt;&gt; You can come out of your dark hole. &gt;&gt; The W victory's already been won. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And our great leader has already taken and declared peace &gt;&gt; for his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; And he's purging this world &gt;&gt; and coming back to rule here &gt;&gt; with his people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I'm long over my time. &gt;&gt; This is the administration that we're under. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read Revelation 5, Revelation 10, just keep that one thing in mind. These positions, these offices have changed. And we're under we're under completely a different mandate. Completely. Oh, I wish. Do you know friends, there's all kinds of churches in the area. I'm not against the churches, but the system that they're under will not give them the kind of life that you have. &gt;&gt; Why do you as believers, why do you have the kind of life that we have that we kind of enjoy? Why do we have a sustaining power? What is it? I asked the question today, you young people, we even are asked by our our some of our senior people. Why do you direct so much to our young people? Because it's almost half of the congregation. And it's a it's a paradox to me. I talk to all kinds of people and churches and ministers and they can't hardly they get every kind of gimmick and game and all kinds of programs and music and this and entertainment trying to keep their young people. And here we stand behind the word and preach the word and preach the gospel and not an easy gospel and the young people come &gt;&gt; and another one comes &gt;&gt; and another one says I want to be baptized and nobody coaxes them and it's not an emotional thing and I said I said today to one of our trustees I said how does this happen why is this happening I said I just talked to a young man out the door and he's been coming for some months just coming on his own just a fine and radiant. I said, "There's nothing like this message. Once you say it, nothing." He said, "No, there is nothing else." &gt;&gt; That's the first words I've had with him. This is incredible. Who does this? God. &gt;&gt; No program, no excitement, no emotion. God does it. &gt;&gt; God opens the understanding. &gt;&gt; How how privileged we are. Oh, my friends, I'm having such a a difficult time. I'm trying to say the the the church world it is that they're appealing. Listen, the time is going to come when preachers are preaching perhaps a a lot better message and uh you know with more power or more vigor or more something than I am and they're going to convince the people of their need of Christ. Brother Brandham says they're going to come to the altar and they're going to pray. They're gonna weep and believe they're getting salvation &gt;&gt; and it'll be over. &gt;&gt; The office is closed. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayaith the word. &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus say it? &gt;&gt; Many will come say, "We did this in your name. We did that in your name. We did something else." And what's he going to say? What's he say? &gt;&gt; Say it again. Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that. &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that. &gt;&gt; You never want to hear that. And that's why we preach the way we preach. &gt;&gt; That's why we urge people. We're not here. and the wrong office, the wrong there. They still have a mental concept, a mental image of Jesus that walked by the Sea of Galilee. He did walk by the Sea of Galilee. He doesn't happen to be there right now. &gt;&gt; He happens to be right here &gt;&gt; in another office. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're under another order. We're under an order of &gt;&gt; MelzDC. &gt;&gt; Unchanging God &gt;&gt; without beginning of days nor ending of life. &gt;&gt; That's the order I want to be under. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you for remaining with me as long as you did. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing, shall we? Amen. There's no place to end, so we just quit. But the office isn't closed. will be here the next service, &gt;&gt; Lord willing. &gt;&gt; If this office closes, we'll be open on the other side. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's sing. There's never been a day like this. Let's stand, shall we? And sing. There's never been a day like this day. You sing it however it means. Whatever it means to you. There's never been a day like this day. There's never been a day like this. I see. Oh, there's never [Music] [Applause] so bright as this day. this glorious day. There's never been a day like this day to me. There's never been a day like this day. I see. There's never light that shine so bright as the glorious day. Something came to me earlier while I was studying this message, I believe yesterday, and it comes back to me again right now. And that is if you have some question that has arisen in your mind on the subject that we've been speaking, if you'd like to just write it down and hand it into into me or into the office, I'd be happy to receive it. might not be able to answer them all, but I just felt that we might want to do that because if there's something that you'd say, well, I I I kind of missed this. I if you'd give me some clarification on this or tell me where I might read to get a better understanding of this, I'd be very very happy to do that. So, we just like to be as helpful as we can. Do you enjoyed the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I trust that you have. There's never been a day like this day to me. There's never been a day like this day. I see. There is a light that shines so bright as the glory of I am redeemed. I am redeemed. I am redeemed. &gt;&gt; Thank you for it. Oh my Jesus. my life and [Music] just don't be afraid. Tell them I [Music] am My Jesus [Applause] I am. Oh, tell them I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just feel like worshiping him just for a moment in song. Let's just worship him. Wonder if we can sing worthy is the lamb. uh some midnight hour, you know, when you get into that one. Okay, start me off. Okay. I am blessed. I [Music] might give you [Music] [Music] Bless you.

And doctors said that all went well and that they were able to remove the entire blood clot. I want to say we do not tell the congregation everything. But earlier today they did a bio they not a biopsy but they did a uh sent a like a catheter camera uh up like an angio up to the spot. They said it was much worse than what they had expected. In fact is I believe they said it was one of the worst that they've seen and they didn't didn't really have uh a whole lot of confidence of just how things would turn out. They weren't nearly as hopeful as they were when they first brought her. We didn't say that. Sometimes people get caught in the emotion of it. We've been holding it before the Lord and uh said please pray for the family in your prayers as there are still uncertainties of the effects of her motor skills balance and memory. The family wishes for no visitors at this time. So I want to rem remind you young people no visitors for sister Megan at this time but we bless his name. &gt;&gt; We bless his name. I personally have prayed and am praying that this will be something that will get glory. I've been I I'm I'm just like I'm just obsessed with this one thought. Not healing to satisfy us. Not healing even to give life back. Not healing so we can have our loved ones back. healing or this miracle, whatever it is we're praying for that your name, oh God, can be glorified. &gt;&gt; Whatever will glorify your name, &gt;&gt; whether in life or in death, whatever it is, glorify your name. &gt;&gt; Get glory to your name. &gt;&gt; And I would like to see him be able to glorify &gt;&gt; the Christ of this word. &gt;&gt; Glorify the living Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it with all my heart. I'm going to ask our brother Mohan Senior if you will come please and pray. I saw you get blessed in the word this morning and that blessed me also. Let's just sing I'll bless your name once again as our brother Mohan comes and and ask give thanks to God if you would brother Moan for the work that has taken place on our sister Megan as well. Thank her. Thank God on behalf of this congregation. Get let we'll give praise to him and then ask God's blessing upon the people this week. Okay, we'll sing I bless your name. [Music] God bless you.
