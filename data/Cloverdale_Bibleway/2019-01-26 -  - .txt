TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just before we turn to the word and carry on with the scripture I thought I'd like to just also mention we we have a look at the website that her brother Robert Wilson has and really amazing what God is providing to especially english-speaking people and I'm maybe I'll just have you have your seats for just a moment and be easier this way we had an unusual thing in fact as I had never if you had told me a few years ago that this is what I was going to experience I would could never have believed that such a thing was going to take place this what happened since the work started in China which is about 12 to 15 years ago and then into Vietnam and our whole focus was on India we printed in India for messages untold millions from 1980-81 all through up till just recently and then the messages now have gone onto the Internet and what's called the message hub and it would surprise you there's a 60 languages we have 60 languages and it's end and as translators wherever they are in the world they could be in Mongolia they could be another southern tip of South America they could be in the Arctic they could be wherever anywhere on earth that they're translating there just a certain format they have to put it in so the titles write that and the date and so on and so forth and then they can they can just click it like that and that message goes on the internet and can be accessed read printed listen to providing it's got a voiceover at this time and many of them do not but many them do there's now 60 languages on the internet this you just from 2:13 till now in the first part of May there was 1 million 145,000 197 downloads these are not books printed where people just print masses of books and send them out over the country which we did in India and people got books maybe they didn't even want but these are people who want books these are people who print the book they want and the title they want and and so it and this this is a faith challenge report which it just printed I just got it off they pressed from the office just before I came and it speaks about Gandhi and Africa and the center spread is of China and then the next spread is print stations in Mexico and let me let me just you might just be here he say well I'm just over farmer I'm a mechanic this is the brother I've never met that I know of he wrote from Trinidad when he heard about the hub station and on his own salary he bought hub stations the station the printer the whole thing is a printers only about five six hundred dollars its HP you can buy it at any office depot and they're workhorses their duplex printer and he tastes those printers and a computer if he needs to to South America and has put print stations in every country of South America at his own expense and he just goes and he leaves it he eat leaves a here's where we're going and he sends a report back and he says gone to Bolivia in Bolivia met this brother met that brother had a meeting met brother to train them in the hub station and and loaded and downloaded something and then he puts mission accomplished he goes the next place and that's the kind of reporting sense this is what has happened in in China the translators if I could just describe to you how diligent they are and I'm going to be very brief they started translating and they have a Bible that's called the Union Bible of China and that's the one that government allowed them to have and I have to describe something to your friends China was in existence long before America was discovered you understand that as hundreds of millions and the Bible says that the eyes of the Lord go to and fro throughout the whole earth not just North America or America or Canada or Europe to throughout the whole earth and there are people there that are so so intensely it just humbled me to tears to see people that were they were teachers they were professional people they were common people everything you could imagine educated or more educated than any person in this building and I know that some of you are highly educated and they they go into a closet door and bring out little kindergarten plastic chairs because they have to be put away real quick if there's a wrong knock on the door and I know I was there my wife knows she was there and I happen to be there when the police walked in and the rest is history but we were in and we were in prison for some days and that they will if there's a knock on the door and it's a wrong kind of knock and they looked and say the police are here they put scoot all those chairs away and they get around the table have a cake and have a birthday havin they're havin a birthday gathering and there's a cake there and so on so the friends are here around this birthday we couldn't do that because there's about 80 people there and during the arrest but some of these people I will say almost all of them they they print these message books print finer books than we have here they actually said they didn't complain to me they don't complain to anybody they just said these books we're out too fast because they that's they read them and pass them around and they print a book for the sake of giving it out and it's just going like a prairie fire we can't even begin to keep track of it but they laminated beautifully laminated the covers the covers are just beautiful all different and they printed all our own books they don't ask for any help we give them help because we know that they need it but they don't ask for any help they just say we'll do it ourselves and they print the books one little print station itself printed over fifty thousand books they burn out though they burn out their printers and all of us would just replace it and keep on going but while they were doing that while they were translating several translators working under brother Murphy Wong and they would find what the prophet of God and they so believed that prophet of God said this is what he said look in their Bible that's not what our Bible says so they died arised those hours and then they would look there's one scripture first John five and seven for there are three that bear record in heaven the word the father the word and the father the spirit in the word and these three are one that verse isn't even in the Bible that verse which the Prophet emphasizes not even in their Bible at all and and they found so many hours so they they began to die rise those errors unbeknown to me I didn't know it I wasn't aware of it at all and finally a Chinese brother who's a deacon in our church walked into my office and he want to know if he just talked to me a few minutes and he told me how many five hundred million people have cell phones he said the Chinese people have an insatiable this insatiable desire to just read in their reading walking down the street and reading some have two phones and they're just reading and he says we are going to make a Bible reader and a message reader so they can read the Bible and the message on a reader similar to what brother Wilson was saying today I didn't see that the but I heard a little bit of it and and and and then what they did was he said we are we're going to translate the Bible just floored me I said translate the Bible that's an enormous enormous task why you're going to translate the Bible they haven't in Chinese no he said we haven't he got that we got to King James but it's a it's a uni Bible they call it a uni Bible and it's not accurate in fact it's fundamental Christians real fundamental solid Christians in Hong Kong did the Old Testament and he says they've offered it to us just free just take it have it and he says we're doing the entire New Testament and he said we'll be done by April that was a year ago April and that's how far they were along then they discovered there were so many hours in what these people had done even though they had improved it they did thirty thousand corrections in the Old Testament and so he said we're having to do it again and he said all I can tell you is that the Uni Bible is nothing more than a reference book believers discovered listen believers believers discovered the errors believers are translating the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation it's just rate of the doing a proofreading right now in our office and believers are going to make this Bible available to the entire world Chinese population on the internet free it's going to be printed as a Bible and and also almost identical to what brother Wilson has this the search engine has already been finished and completed and the search engine will not only work in Chinese it'll work in any language but as a person is reading the Bible just catch this as they're reading the Bible and they say little I can't like to know what does this scripture mean they just touch that icon takes them right to the message hub and has the Prophet interpret that scripture for them how do you like that that is well thought out we don't even have that ourselves as yet and takes them right and then gives them a list of all all the messages that brother branham refer to that scripture and I thought that was quite remarkable they're just finishing just finishing it now we don't even have that how many remember the old books that brother David mama was dead absolutely and that's the one I meant mention to your brother brother Robert that he did all of that work and it's been resurrected now because that's exactly what they needed to do and so they don't have to do it that's wonderful amen are we rejoicing the Bible says that even the angels of God rejoice over one soul isn't that what he said so we're so thankful for wherever they are whether it be in America or Europe or Canada or or over in Asia someplace we're just so thankful for it god bless you thank you for inviting us thank you for coming if you didn't come we wouldn't have much of a service and thank you for accept my apologies for the long service this morning and we we kind of put a lot in there and this evening might be a bit of a little strange but at the end of this service today I'm going to give a part of my testimony and to to maybe correct some things that have been improperly or wrongly propagated even on the internet and it's not accurate and the reason I can correct it is because I was there you know what song I was there when it happened and I guess I ought to know Alleluia all right why don't you stand to your feet and we're going to just look to the Lord and then we're going to read a scripture and move along real quickly let's bow our heads father hell we thank you for the kind warm attention of the people thank you for the reception that we've been given and once again I pray that you will touch our precious brother IV Lord what a responsibility the pastor and in their condition you know exactly how to touch that nerve and how to heal it and to remove the pain I pray father in the name of Jesus you said whatsoever we ask that we should expect it that it will take place and so I believe that that is exactly what will take place just touch our brother father in a supernatural way and by whatever means you choose we just ask that you will do it and do a marvelous healing and for everyone that is here tonight Lord I pray that you will send a special portion and let us as we hunger after you and we do hunger after you God be glorified in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen I'll have you turn with me to the Book of Isaiah the 14th chapter this morning you recall I stressed the point that for the Brenham made he said in the back part of God's mind remember that I said the Prophet you know whether it's Future past or present it's irrelevant because God is timeless now we're going to read in Isaiah where the Prophet speaks about how are the fallen Lucifer how would their fallen from heaven how did he know he was fallen from heaven he's way back into the eternity someplace and then John John in the revelation he Pence's that he goes forward and he sees them thrown into cast into the lake of fire so I mean you know with God we have to understand the kind of God do we have there isn't he marvelous praise be to God so in the 14th chapter we'll just read in the 12th verse how art thou fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation's for thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms you may be seated it's very very different I have never only spoke this at my church one other place and it's very very recent from last month but I want to speak to you on the evolution of Lucifer think about a moment and a subject the characteristics of Lucifer brother branham speaks in one place he talks about the evolution of the spirit and the the way that the Holy Spirit has worked from age to age in time to time but now I want to just draw your attention to the evolution of Lucifer because what what the Prophet is said not once but many times he said we need to know our enemy and I want to ask you as a congregation do you know your enemy you know him well the Prophet said we need to study his moves study how he did things and study how he he said even a boxer will stand back as brother Branham was a boxer and stand back and study the other boxers licks he called it on how he moved wise so he doesn't get hit so he doesn't get it doesn't get pounded by that and I think we as believers we sometimes have suffered some real hard knocks and we didn't need to we need to study him and say ah that's that's that's him in fact is in counseling we have counsel I've counseled with many many people in my ministry but and and you might be here this might just be for someone I didn't intend to say this but I have counseled and a person will be well in the medical world they would say their manic depressant but that's not in the Bible that spirit of depression is just nothing but the devil you say well that may be simplistic over-simplistic no I think your overcomplicated if a person wants to take some brother Brent says you call a cancer it's a devil and I would say we need to heed him and he starts talking way back in the 50s hello how a cell becomes wounded and then it and then it attaches and fastens itself and then the enemy takes ahold of it then and he said it is a devil and for someone who had such success as he had at casting that demon spirit out and the cancer dying I tell you what friends that's the message I want to listen to and so now there have been these that have been they said well they're just I'm I'm depressed and there may be somebody here goes through this and fights that I fight depression uh-huh and and I can tell you what happens and I just tell these people without knowing with necessarily knowing their individual situation I said you get up up a morning and maybe things don't go just exactly right but you you begin to feel just a heaviness just a cloud you just feel dark and heavy the other said we do I do I said that is that demon spirit that's the presence of that one and now he's an opportunist and he'll just wait till this goes wrong and that goes wrong and you just go deeper and deeper and deeper and soon he's got control of your thoughts in your mind and you just go into pits of depression as soon as you feel that heavy like you need to turn around and say I know you I've experienced that before and you've made my life miserable and now I'm identifying you and I am naming you guys where Jesus said what's your name you might as well know that's a mortal enemy and God is here to give you an absolute victory and if you've ever been bothered with that and that fits of depression and whatever more shake it off hallelujah I mean business friends I'm not here I'm not here to just exercise myself but I mean business shake that thing off say well I've had it for years that doesn't mean anything just shake it off be rid of it refuse it what does the Bible say what does your Bible say my Bible says rebuke the devil or resist the devil and he will flee from you is that what it says we ought to rejoice I'm going to take this subject from Lucifer to the serpent from the serpent to Satan and from Satan to the devil and from the devil to the dragon now we may think of oh the dragon some fear saying flaming fire out of its mouth no no no no the Greek word for dragon is a fabulous animal fabulous animal the Bible says Howard though fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning Sun of the morning and the Hebrew word is dawn as soon as I read that and heard that dawn and the Prophet said now the message is the key and you're gonna have to this is a this is a bit of a study but it's an incredibly important one because I want to on your behalf if I'm able I pray that God will allow me to put something into your hand that will disarm him render him helpless and you've got those doors tonight that you'll be equipped such as you've never been equipped before say Satan I'm prepared to meet you and stand my ground I'm not going to be just defensive now but I'll be offensive I have reason I have family I have friends I have children I have husband I have wife I have my own body to care for I am going to resist you I'm going to effectively resist you according to the Word of God do you have another Kingdom it's a kingdom of darkness but I am of the day I am of the light I'm of this resurrection power and you have no place with me whatsoever amen so over the years our Christian walk we have studied we've desired we have believed for the nature and character of Jesus Christ but this prophet said in the questions and answers and 61 he said study the enemy what he's going to do what's his move and then know how to meet him and he said and that's what we're here for now I've preached here several times but I've never preached on study your enemy but tonight this is not a negative this is not a negative message this is a positive message and you need to know and the Prophet said study your enemy I can tell you he certainly knew he certainly had studied him and he said that's what we're here for and study your enemies moves and knowing how to meet him and the thing that will overcome him so the Word of God is always the focus of Satan's attacks the message and the integrity of the message and the integrity of the revealed word is being questioned by some in this message is being questioned and now they have the tool of internet and all of these access and bring it into people's homes and so doubt Satan is using these technologies to him to the ultimate and maximum purpose for the kingdom of darkness and we need we're not interested so much in the technology for the kingdom of God as I am that God chose to preach the word and the word that we preach being the truth has got power to overcome that and God's not going to have any of his children to see but they are using all of these things than this is part of the reason why I perhaps will give testimony tonight this prophet said that he speaking of Satan hates all scripture and it's the whole Canon of Scripture but if anything he desires mostly is revelation that he despises I'm sorry he despises mostly is revelation in Genesis because Genesis tells the beginning and revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last day and to understand the subject we need to start at the beginning and in the beginning God the scripture the Prophet says God was alone with his thoughts in the beginning God dwelt alone with his attributes and that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts he created the angels to worship Him and the Angels worshiped him and he said and that made him God he said his own being now if you have a question and you want to jot down some places of Scripture that's perfectly fine as well because I have some scripture some locations of Scripture that might be a very interest to you of keen interest to you but he said he his own being created creatures to worship Him he said them to my opinion the first thing that he made was angels and then they worshiped him and that made him God and he started from there he created angels so he could be God he said in order to be God there had to be something to worship Him so he created angels and beings and cherubims and so forth to worship Him now you may think that I'm repeating being repeated repetitious but not so because there was some added added word so he created cherubims and serves an order of angels in fact and Lucifer was part of the heavenly creation you followed me now have you God was alone with his thoughts now he's got a host of angels and Lucifer was one of those from the initial creation in fact is I will give you quote in a few minutes where brother Branham says this and it certainly ties in with Isaiah saying the son of the dawn perhaps the dawn of creation and the prophet said that the only thing that Satan couldn't do was create he couldn't create I believe in my own heart of hearts is not a doctor and I just believe that he was standing there while God's Word went out and through Jesus Christ he created all things and without him was nothing created you believe that so the scripture tells us now that there was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven I asked the question why was Satan cast out into the earth and his angels with him I mentioned this morning why was he not cast to perhaps the outer reaches of the soul of the universe and into some a dark abyss why wasn't he why wasn't he well he was cast in fact is it it is a great plan I personally believe that time was created and the creation took place to draw Satan into this all-time battle because I believe that God has set aside this time to destroy him I don't want to go to heaven or there's another war I want to go to heaven knowing Satan has been destroyed and my elated all his angels everyone he deceived and that we are free from Sam and that's what God's promised so why was he cast to the earth now you can you have to listen to the whole service very closely because the battle that started in heaven was not one yet your prophet said and I keep saying your problem so you'll know it's not me saying it your prophet said that the battle that was angels angels battle fell on humans how many humans do we have here oh your field your prophet said the battle of angels fell on you you're not gonna you're not gonna just get mind-over-matter and say you know III don't have it no no that battle fell upon humans we're humans so he said the this great first battle that was ever fought begin in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer in his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth it originated in heaven and then was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings then the battle from angels became human battles and he said in another place has been raging ever since amen doesn't matter how quiet you are still the truth still the truth God sent a messenger to alert us to this and if we don't know and we don't understand and we don't make it our business or we don't at night but well be that we live a defeated life and Satan can defeat a person with a lot of things he can he breath brother ban says he takes them to an early grave it's not God's will say oh well you know I can't go to God pulls my number well that's only part of it the other thing he said some go to early grave don't let them go he prays that and then some some are taken by success you know the Satan uses success so oh I you know I've got to keep reaching out here because I've got scholarships and I've got this and I've got but what about a scholarship in the Word of God what's wrong with that what's wrong with studying this what's wrong with studying and knowing the enemy and say I faced you before uh yeah you've tried that before you you've got a friend of mine you've got a family member of mine you have someone you should be praying for do you have someone we should have victory over I believe that they the Prophet also said that God hates a powerless church he expects a church and I've given you power don't live powerless amen now now you can believe with I'll tell you in advance Satan doesn't want me to preach this but I'm gonna preach it anyway he doesn't want to be exposed he'd sooner have us ignorant about his moves and what his tactics but we won't be so now the first the first human that this battle fell upon was Adams wife she was the first human to come under the effect and the Prophet said I'm going to give you the quote later on the problem brother branham said that Satan loose her was right next to God you you were calling it said he was his right-hand man almost co-equal only in creation he could not create dozen friends he is our prophet said he was a slicker don't try and debate with him he knows more about the Bible and we do you talk about worship he was created to worship he knows all about worship and that is why even even into even into the music realm and they are trailing him that's why he dwells there probably even said that Hollywood was this was the seed of Satan it just moved it from Paris or someplace so now Lucifer needed a vessel Lucifer needed a vessel I hope you can follow me and so he who stood right next to God in heaven and has cast down now he goes and there's a God on the earth which is Adam the son of God and he takes and he takes and uses the vessel that's right next to him who is the serpent the serpent and it took a prophet to expose it he's not a snake he's a creature and he says perhaps more handsome and more appealing than even Adam what kind of a creature and he stood on his feet what kind of a being and ended and Satan Lucifer knew he was the only one with seed that would mingle with the woman you talk about an intelligence he knew some things so now the one that was right next to God in the heavens and is cast down earth he goes right next to the one that was next to man and uses him as a vessel and approaches not him than her because he didn't have the he didn't have the facility she had the facility to carry the scene oh my I'm just holding back a wee bit friends Satan when he came to Jesus Christ he came to the man Jesus Christ overcame him and stripped him and it is Jesus Christ speaking through this messenger you want to listen to me now and saying to you making a declaration your moon is sealed Alleluia he can come in with all of his attacks and do whatever he might do and pass through your mind and torment you and hound you and all the rest of it but the elect of God cannot receive his saint because Jesus Christ died to seal your wound your mental woo hallelujah do you believe that you believe that she'll thank God I'm sealed sealed sealed there's nothing else in this world that'll do it so he chose the closest thing to the human race the serpent now the Lucifer's the son of the morning that's his characteristic the front of the morning don't confuse them all now now he comes and uses an the facility of the serpent and the serpent even the name indicates he was one of cunning and and even the name means our divination so now being the son of the morning that isn't gonna work down here he has to use that cunning deception on Eve's mind and he has a question I want you to be fully awake now he has the question and many some have raised up in the message with the question you can have a question I've had questions but this is a question with an agenda behind it the agenda is to get this person to disbelieve and I can proclaim and tell you that there are those that have raised up that within the message and they're asking questions but the question is to get the people who read the question to disbelieve the word if you agree you can say America and I say to you give no place to the devil I wouldn't even take time to read the garbage I don't I really don't i'm just been made aware aware of others that are tormented by it and whatever you do don't give me the impression that you don't know anything about it be truthful so yeah I'm aware of it and I will say to you give no room to him give no space to him I do with people that they spend their time reading all about all the trash and stuff that all the accusations and everything else why waste her time with you spend that kind of time studying the message and all these network things hundreds and hundreds of millions tell your friends hello friends tell my friends yeah all those people out there aren't my friends they're not your friends angels are skilled and worship friends they're skilled and worship that's what they were made for so now here's brother branham's description I've gone to a lot of a lot of work to have this just down concise he said the serpent which was of being more like a man all right upon his feet just like a man in heaven Lucifer was right next to God and on earth he entered and used the serpent which was right next to man who was God of the earth and in the mark of the beast he said Satan could not have been the serpent he said Satan could not have been the serpent said in Corinthians it speaks the Bible said that transformed himself into an angel of light he said you just underestimate Satan we don't want to do that we'd want to underestimate him we're not glorifying him but we don't want to underestimate him he's our enemy he's an arch enemy he's God's enemy he's a Prophet's enemy he's the enemy of this message he said if he could come into the kind of substance like meeting made an angel of light and here's what brother Benton says if he could come into that kind of substance then why could he not come into a beast the next thing to a man next thing to a man so now notice Satan changes his mask Corinthians says Paul speaking in Corinthians lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices we know his scheme in other words we know his methodology we understand it says put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil is that the scripture put on the whole armor of corn that you might be able to withstand the wiles of the devil and the wiles of the devil is ax is the scheme or the craftiness the strategy and the deceit for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places how the Prophet says know your enemy he said a real good fighter usually knows and studies his opponent he studies his licks or his blows study the enemy and questions and answers again he said what's he going to do what's his move and then know how to meet him and that's what we're here for I have some slides but I think I'll just omit these after these first slides he says in the seal of the Antichrist the right-hand man of Almighty God was Lucifer at the Sun of the morning the first I want this congregation to think of that the first let's think about that a moment the right-hand man of Almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning or the son of the dawn the first I assume and I believe that perhaps he was the first one created and the Bible the Prophet said another place in the beginning when God spoke and Satan was standing there and heard it in the beginning when God spoke Satan was standing there and heard it if I saw that word let the let there be light I don't know eons of time what light appeared let the earth bring forth let the water dry out and he sees the power this word of power going forth and the Prophet said to give you some concept to give you a concept and I think we need this I really do I believe we need this to give us some concept we also want to know our God they said ah like a little sacred light way back when he was alone a second how can the Prophet go back well Isaiah went back Zico went back John went forward I don't have any trouble so the Prophet went back way back in the back part of God's mind way back when God was alone and he said to give you some concept in Christ the mystery said because this great being that fills all time and space fills the space between you and I sometimes we want to pray and ask old God send your virtue down his virtue and all of his attributes are right here closer than your breath if I get you to see that be it be nothing impossible for us you get this group of people to believe that we absolutely nothing impossible all healing mercy forgiveness is everything God God fills all time and space his Phyllis Phyllis building with all the attributes of God no wonder the prophets so strained if he could just get the people to accept that to receive it it was right here and it just speak the word and as they wouldn't believe it whatever they would believe whatever you would say it will happen according to his will hallelujah and Satan was standing there and the prophet Isaiah picked up the scene and he says Lucifer said Allah said I'll do that there was the only thing that he couldn't do so he left it after that power of the spoken word o believers friend I want you to grasp this tonight this message that came out of a prophet is not his words it is the words of Almighty Claudius Alleluia and I'm going to tell you of an experience now tonight I hear him say a word and say something happened in the in actual the the whole span of of the of the whole weather system say a change and I'll give it to you I was there it's not happen when you think of a man speaking in the elements of the world the elements of space begin to obey then we need to awaken and shake ourselves and say this message is not just a book or a tape this message has come from the eternities from Almighty God and I'm going to believe it that way I'm going to walk out and act on it that way alleluia alleluia you know sometimes healy and things like that move us a great deal you know a very very short time ago just very quickly just a short time ago a doctor because he's kind of watching me over my age and he says I want you to go through this I want you to go through that so it's okay okay fine we'll go through this test go through that test he called me in after a bunch of bloodwork and so on he said were you sick when you had this exam this blood test I said no he said are you diabetic he knows me well said are you diabetic I said no I don't think said you are now really he said but he was concerned he says your white blood cell count is not good so I don't understand all this stuff as three major things and I said well he said I'm gonna send you for another test so I go into the lab and I said to the young lady in the lab I said you folks ever make mistakes and she said well no she said I don't think so why I said well did this this blood test report that went to my doctor sounds like a different person doesn't sound like me at all okay so she she let me stand right there and watch in a while she took the piece of paper and glued it on and let me read it says my name is on there okay fine so she did all the bottles you know and did another blood test and I go back to the doctor and he said well this is better this is better and this is better you're just a little just watch it and I'd like you to just go and talk to the nurse about diabetes and so on said okay fine so you know they had me prick my finger for about a month and whatever they want fine but the Prophet tells us that healings in the body I say god I'll look after this body you give me and you do the rest amen hallelujah glory to God I believe it with all my heart I'm just kind of rejoicing because it wasn't that long ago I was exactly in in brother IV state so I told him all about it I said then put an injection there right to the nerve and all the rest of it and they told me you'll be here every three months every three months you have to have that I said brother IV that's that's two years ago I've been hunting I've been on the quad we've been shooting moose we've been packing meat we've been going over logs and everything else hallelujah hallelujah I believe what I'm beating friends glory to God and if God chooses for me to go however he chooses to go that's fine with me but my god healing is I believe it healings between you and I my brother my brother healing is between you and I forgiveness is there all the mercies there and some preacher yet I'm saying or mercies no more mercies no more that's my saying God's no more he can't he can't diminish he can't diminish in love he can't diminish and mercy he can't diminish than anything he can change the access how you have access you can't go to your old dead dead formal Church and get it but you can get it where the spoken word is you believe that and I can tell you where the spoken word is Satan is not very far away he's right there handy he wants that he desires that and he despises the fact that use a little little piece of dust as a human can believe God and have that spoken word act and he can't make it work Lori to God hallelujah friend humans will be happy I'm going to preach anyway so he comes down and now he's with the serpent and he he works let's just follow that guy that serpent for a moment the serpent to practice divination insight or foretelling like he always like he has some kind of wisdom seeking knowledge by supernatural means to discover hidden knowledge this is his nature I'm talking about the characteristics of the Lucifer and the mark of the beast he says further Satan was kicked out of heaven and came to the earth there was nothing else he could do he could get into the animal would be too far from him seed wouldn't mix so he had to get into this serpent which was a being more like a man he was the most subtle most shrewd cunning wisdom smarter than the animal he was right next to the man now you didn't had to hear from brother Bissell you from the prophet of God right next to the man in the questions and answers he said 64 said the Satan the serpent almost almost almost had a soul it's impossible for us to determine how close that was almost had a soul and he stood upon his feet just like a man he says then that seed which was next to the human seed and he goes on to say and you better believe this Satan himself the spirit knew that there was only one seed that that was the only seed that would pregnat the woman hey that's how he got into the human race but now listen closely and the serpent I want to say the serpent in Moses ministry Moses the first word prophet oh my you've got to let me preach for the first word prophet the people had heard the voice of God in the mountain and the Prophet says so many times they said don't let God speak to us anymore that's too fearsome you speak you go up and meet him you hear him and then come and speak and I was the first time Moses is the first prophet of that nature and he hears the Word of God speaks and God speak it mouth to ear to him and sends him down and speaks of the people and when Moses first heard saw the pillar of fire and met that God in the burning bush I'm the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob take off your shoes you're standing on holy ground he says I'm gonna send you I've heard the cry of the people I'm gonna send you any now he begins to make excuse that's what's in your hand rod catch that rod and it became a serpent serpent lujah because the serpent you're looking at me earnestly the serpent had already been judged and God spoke to the serpent and said because you have done this I'm putting Emily between you and the woman and between your seed and your seed anybody ever disputed you above the serpent seed take him to Genesis 3:16 and say what is this vein but what is this seed I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed and the seed woman doesn't have a seat as a prophetess said but she has a field she has a field Oh hallelujah love to preach it right now on the field of Boaz hallelujah Ruth was Boaz is field we are the bridegroom's field he soldiers see hallelujah you were meant for his seed you are not meant for the Serpent's seed and so God through Jesus Christ and not just by a messenger your mind your see move womb has been sealed alleluia because it was made for one scene you might have known others who were in a denomination but their seed wouldn't work they were dead and Jesus went because you were united to sin by birth you were born in sin shaped in iniquity and the only way in the invisible union we that was our first union and Jesus Christ that union could only be broken by death that's the only way your Union could be broken every man woman and child in this place and on earth was born in sin and shapen in iniquity and married to that sinful nature that was the first husband and in order to have a legal separation with husband he had to die and so our Lord Jesus Christ came and went to Calvary and died to break that million and said you and I free hallelujah and he rose again so the Apostle Paul said so you can be married to another even Jesus Christ raised from the dead and bring forth fruit unto Him all my goodness help me out hallelujah and Satan was the serpent the serpent now we're saying Satan but we don't want to interchange the names the serpent he said he's already been judged and so when he put it on the ground had become a serpent and the Bible says and Moses fled from it just take it up by the tail he reaches down and takes it by the tail and emissions of rot again becomes as his staff again and the staff was always an emblem of the Word of God now I may create more questions than there will answers but I want you to think of it'll set your thinking and it becomes a rowdy game then he comes before Pharaoh and the Prophet said Satan was in the Pharaoh and God was in Moses you believe that God was in Moses God is in you God was in roses Satan was in Pharaoh and so Moses does one of the plagues a cheap magician trick come on magicians they do the same thing false anointed ones Moses did something they did something he did something they did something he cast down his rod he'd become a snake they cast their rods down they become snakes and his slate snake his serpent saw it all aresult and the Prophet said what did Moses do he said he took the rod that had just swallowed all airs up and went out and went out in the wilderness and did miracle withered hallelujah our trouble is we got two smaller God hallelujah hallelujah I'm gonna grind it down friend I'm gonna say strong things he said strong things I'm gonna repeat what he said he said sim shim there is anybody free from sin but sin he said once it's confessed when it's confessed I'm talking about a real confession it drops into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and he says and you cannot find it again because it breaks up it breaks up it's even in even the construction of the chemistry breaks up and you can never put it back together again you can never find it again and he says furthermore that it actually becomes bleach and you'll never find it again say well I don't know if I got that big well my god is that big you can never find it again no he was praying and asking God to remember something in the past that he's already forgotten hallelujah he has the capacity to completely forget and annihilate the thought of it hallelujah that's my god amen so Aaron suited down the rod of Moses before Pharaoh and it became a serpent and demonstrating that the serpent identified sin already judged he was demonstrating before Farrell this is already judged and Moses serpent swallowed theirs up and the Bible says in Moses also the Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass when he beheld sin judge when you behold Sinjar soon as something begins to cause you to quiver or to tremble or to you feel you're going to be overcome just look and look at the Word of God look at the promise and see sin judged and if you behold sin judged and you can say Satan you have already been judged you are doomed and you keep holding to that you keep confessing that you're going to be a free man a free woman in no time glory to God hallelujah hallelujah so the two that fought in heaven now as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness jesus said even so must the Son of Man be lifted up and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life he's dealing with the consequence of death he'll not perish and no Marvel he said for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light at first Corinthians 2nd Corinthians 11 and 14 but now I want to come to Satan who's the adversary and one who withstands one who opposes another in a purpose or act the first time are you interested miss the first time that Satan is mentioned in the Bible is in chronicles 1st chronicles 2 and 11 and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked now he doesn't come and show himself as an angel of light he doesn't come with divination of the serpent he's coming now to all pose you see the characteristics if he can't come and show you more light but even when he came through the serpent to Eve he said he offered her more light there's people and trouble that has arisen even within the ranks of the message because people come and our offering said oh if you believe this you have more light to say excuse me folks I've got an entire message I've got the entire message opened by a prophet of God and that is the light of the hour [Applause] hallelujah glory to God I tell you what I can say that with and I do say that with some force because I have heard all kinds of wins that have come through oh this is like a special light there's no special light Christ is the light he the revealed word is a special light but he offered eath more light and now he's changed his characters that has changed from a messenger of light to one of divination and a question did God say now that doesn't really sound terrible does it did God say it's not the words that sound so terrible if the agenda behind it well how will I know that's where you need to really be in tune with God [Music] what's behind the question and the Bible says and Satan stood up against Israel and that's the first time the term is used for this dark enemy of the Church of the brighter Christ and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel and I don't know exactly why but that was a grievous sin to God that he would number Israel I suppose it showed some lack of trust the the term Devils first mentioned in Leviticus and three or four times in the Old Testament is in direct reference to sacrifice to Devils he use the term Devils but singular devil the devil does not appear in the Old Testament and the first time it appears in the Bible is when and the devil you want to be interested in this the Bible says then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil had not been before you're seeing it up there all right and the devil now it's not it's not late Sun of the morning it's not health God said I can show you a better way it's not that now and it's not Satan who's opposing how he's coming he's opposing God's king who posing the truth and and causing him to do something that's contrary to God but now now oh I want this church I want the people to see what I'm speaking now the two that were in eternity back in the eternities and one one of the word and now the word has become flesh and now they look at each other again eyeballs her eyeball and now it's the devil and the Bible teaches us to be tempted of the devil and the devil is an accuser see he didn't come just to show you more light he didn't come just to entice you in some nice things that's what people say oh they feel it you know this might even be glod come on wake up what's the end they're off which direction is it taking a person say no I'm not going there I'm not going to some old hold formal thing I'm not going to become lacks and lukewarm I'm gonna be aggressive with this word I'm gonna believe it I'm gonna have zeal in my heart hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you believe it sir Amen you believe it with all your heart Alleluia I'm looking for that kind of response we believe it I want to see that there's believers here I want to take a stand Moses said come and stand by me stand by your prophet steinbier a pastor whoever it is stand by and realize that this is a devil now he's gone from son of the morning son of the dawn but we need to know what his agenda was his agenda says I want that spoken word and when he gets down and now he's facing with the creature of the spoken word which is Adam and Eve God the God of the earth he comes as just how I can show you more light and this is more wonderful and this is more enticing and did God say you shouldn't protect you this well this is this is going to take you you'll be sure he didn't take it in the wrong direction come on folks that's exactly so well this doesn't hurt does it do any good and now to be tempted of the devil and here's here's Christ himself made flesh facing the enemy that he faced in the eternities to be tempted of him now now the word has become flesh do you think the for a second that that the enemy didn't know that that that that body now the word was in the body and the word became flesh and there are certain restrictions he's not tired he got hungry and after 40 days the scripture says he was unhung word that didn't happen in heaven that happened here and not the same one that looked they looked at each other eye to eye over there now they're on earth where he's been cast on earth and and and what does Jesus use what does Jesus use against him the very thing he lusted after the spoken word of God and your prophet happened to say listen to me folks your prophet happened to say Jesus did not use any of his grand and wonderful gifts he used what's available to you and it's your fault my fault if we don't use it it's like having your armory full of assault weapons but we won't use them I tell you take a hold of the Word of God said my prophet sent from God our Lord Jesus spoke through him and the same one who denied you and rebuked you there is now rebuking you because he dwells in me and you have no part of me Alleluia and my God has said I am sealed and you don't even have any access to me Alleluia and I hear you maybe somebody's saying well you don't know what I go through yeah I do I know what he goes through I can tell you that he's one fellow that doesn't leave the minister alone because he's afraid we might say something of eternal worth he might say feel that we're going to use something of the spoken word of God and speaks the word hallelujah I've made real enemies of his I told you this morning I just read one line this is a wounded one and her husband doesn't know she's read this listen friends because I obeyed that to the letter I flew four and a half hours with my wife in Reverse by jet to come to that town of Geneva Switzerland and two strangers total strangers picked us up there were the two that I'd got emails from and drove us to their home and took us up into the bedroom which they had prepared and I stood there in my suitcases right there my wife is right here I'm standing here and they closed the door and said refresh yourself and we'll come down have coffee I said to my wife what are we doing here what are we doing here for five days we're going to be here we never stay with people we never stay with people always arrange our own hotel what are we doing here but because of that a convention because some people came over and I told them no meetings I won't preach no meetings but they said well is a little we literally building here it's a quaint cute little Church in a town of about 150 people where we are and we're just gonna have our family gather there alright and I spoke to the family and because of that two of the brothers said you must come back we must have a service you know gather the people could you come next spring the pray about it we did and with a magnificent place in the windows along that side there's a grand mountains of Switzerland and snow in the valley all green and the pasture land it was just picture-perfect and God spoke to me and said conference with God and I went and got the message says and God will choose a beautiful place Sunday like Geneva and get people aside away from their families and away from all other things because of her because of crisis because there's a crisis God had already said these people are wounded you're talking about bruised Reed's bend over to the earth not knowing how we'll ever straighten up the game and so we had a gathering about 120 hundred thirty hundred forty people and I tell you it's the only time in my life it was like came into the room but there's many people are like a blanket fell over and there was people from all kinds of doctrines this doctrine and that doctrine and people who are afraid of each other and it kind of looked around the room and God and I said converse with God God said you'll call people to a beautiful place something like Geneva I said look at that and I said the reason he calls them is because there's a crisis and you people are in a crisis and it's like God brothers threw a blanket over the place and it was a witness even to senior men who came from Belgium they came from Holland they came from Germany they came from Italy they came from Romania they came from Croatia they came from all over the place and the next year even before we left they said when is the next meeting and it's like God drew a blanket around and said this is my convention nobody's going to town with this said Oh God happy way every way these people have been beating these people been bruised these people have been gone after this personality gone after that personality and I spoke very straight to them and God gave them a heart to receive and we just finished the fifth year of glorious almost 300 people and that blanket is still over the group hallelujah I tell you what friends I said this is a neutral country it's known as a neutral country and let people come from all over the country even want to come from my church and they did and they flew from different places to be there in a neutral place and hear the word of God with no agenda no agenda we have one agenda that we will fall in love with the bridegroom that's our agenda hallelujah hallelujah and we won't let Satan we deny Satan the right to tamper with this kind of love affair hallelujah glory to him I won't say forgive me but at least pray for me I have such an urgency within myself and so who you was to be tempted to the devil Jesus in the form of the second Adam by a new creation uses the same word that Lucifer desired to have and defeats him and he perhaps did not realize that the very word of creation that he listed to have would destroy him when the word became flesh hey man our Lord Jesus took of this earth that had been cursed because of him and our Lord Jesus even took him to cursed earth and and then lived in a body God in flesh and he took it to Calvary listen friends I'm going to say something perhaps you've heard it before but in in the servant that we have as the servant of God our precious brother branham God took a man that was born in sin he said he was a sinner we know that born in sin in shape iniquities and took him to a place of adoption where he where he was wholly surrendered to the will and the word of God and he wasn't interested in any denomination he wasn't interested in wealth in those things and showed us another way and we are virgin born as Jesus was virgin born but we are born in sin but now we have an example that you can be born in sin and overcome the enemy and live in overcomers life that's why the message came the message didn't come just to have us with churches dotted across the landscape the message came that there's going to be a people these buildings going to be empty one of these days there's going to be people that's going to depart them and go to some unknown place gonna be taken into another realm into another dimension I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am NOT where I will be where I am there you shall be also do you believe that I'm rejoicing in that brother hallelujah we're gonna be there I believe that with all my heart and soul and then as Lucifer came and used the one next to Adam now we have the second Adam and we have one next to him his name is Judas and they are in the Last Supper looking over the table together he is not afraid of your home he is not afraid of this church he's not afraid of this building he's not afraid of just a lot of person others from their lips but when a person by the inspiration and the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaks the Word of God he is he is disarmed [Music] hallelujah and now think of it friends I'm moving on down now it comes right next to the one the second Adam and I look right across the table I won't look at any person they look right across the table at each other and Jesus says what thou doest do quickly and the Bible says read it in your Bible then Satan entered him and he became the son of perdition and the son of God had four died one took worm to Calvary at Calvary son of God took one to heaven a son of perdition took one to hell that's the account of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the devil is an accuser now he's moved from one that opposes you to one who accuses you oh you think you're in the rapture you think you're going to heaven you think you're especially let group that's exactly that sounds just exactly like him and he's an accuser I know he'll dig up stuff he'll dig up some weakness something something you said a long long time ago and repented over a multitude of times just say you said that you think you're a believer what's what what should we answer them for the biskits what should we answer I'll answer him with yes I've been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ which you haven't I repented over my sin which you can't I've just done a whole lot of things that you can't do and I'm a son of God which you are and I'm destined for heaven which you are hallelujah there's a big difference friends glory to God hallelujah so the two were face to face again in a different form and the Prophet said in the first seal and in this act tonight in this act tonight is that we're going to see that if Satan changing his mask he changes Sun of the morning to divining creature offering more light something more more knowledge in a brighter kingdom now and then he moved and he's opposing now he's opposing you feel that opposition same one same one and now he takes another position to accuse all how he can accuse he knows the scripture he's a sucker he knows the Word of God and he uses that and twisted around and his intent is to degrade you to deny you your claim and one of the things and is why I'm coming to it now that he's attempting to do is find and he raises up those to find things that they say are irreconcilable in the message and the saying is this what your message says does it say this and and and if you were to say well yeah yeah it does say that I guess you know the it's not the question its what is the agenda don't forget it what is the agenda behind the question is get you to disbelieve the messenger if the same serpent asking a question with the intent of getting the person the believer the one that God has put his hand on to question the source of the spoken word because that's the thing he despises so says the second writer was exactly the same as the first horse he says what happened he changed his ministry another place he said he changed his position but now before I come to my testimony just hold it a moment I'm just questioning there's a tactic of war and war certainly something of Satan and during the Second World War horrific things took place the Holocaust I understand 54 million young men and people perished 54 million that's a very sizable country let alone a city perished some of our finest of young men and young ladies perished for what here we are a few years later so it hardly know what happened war but there was a tactic of infiltration infiltration rather a tactic of infiltration which was first implemented during the first world war or the first birth pain I prefer to use the prophets language and was used to gain further in the Second World War but infiltration attacks began with brief and violent bombardments of the enemy front lines to suppress and demon and demoralize the soldiers stationed there Satan knows this tactic very well it doesn't just come with one and the reason why people perhaps become a little quiet in and withdrawn when I come to a subject that's so close to home is because it is so revealing and I can just hear there's somebody here that has felt the bombardment come from one direction in another direction in another direction in another direction I'm not talking about succumbing to it I'm talking about overcoming it have you felt that you would be ashamed to raise your hand would you you've had the bombardment okay I'm preaching even for a few of you the bombardment also targeted the enemy re areas rear areas to destroy and disrupt roads and artillery and command units this was done to confuse the enemy and to reduce their capability to launch an effective counter-attack I have people that have you know maybe they start to get cool and then they're not in the service and not in the church in the house of God and go and talk to this person that person and and and maybe there's a question first but before long they're questioning the minister the pastor that's not sufficient then they question the church then they question the message then they question the Prophet himself and that's the pattern that it usually takes and from there next time you'll find them there in the world absolutely in the world and I've had them laden with Sam dark with Sam say I'm okay that's the next one I can't even believe the deception that has completely swallowed them completely swallowed them up completely in the world say hey I'm okay my kids are okay and you know their kids are drunkards and prostitutes they were okay I tell you what your children your family you may have loved ones in that state there's only one remedy and that is that the Holy Ghost will draw them to a place of repentance and they will find peace with God once again I'll be personal with you right now I'll be personal with you I have a half-sister that has experienced a lot of trouble in her life but she's done very well she's a professor and teachers in a university but she was going through a very very difficult times very very Grievous time in her teens that's right when I was with brother Benham and it so happened that I had to ride out and leave brother Branham in the hunting group we're in this beautiful place of the mountains and I had to ride out about 30 miles on and I couldn't believe that brother Southwick was gonna let me go alone at least he'd have a son go with me to lead the way I mean I'm in grizzly infested country I'm in absolute you haven't got wilderness perhaps have seen wilderness like this and I am I am I have some fear yes I do I've gotta cross rivers where the horse may have to swim I don't know and so I said buddies is Blaine gonna go with me now I said the horse knows the way hey I've written horse when I walked into never thirst and put their head up against the tree and I want you to tell them what to do they don't know which way to go and I wouldn't help for me if I don't know which way to go so here we are and I wake up that morning and the great big snowflakes are coming down total whiteout of snow coming down and they're all in the cookhouse and brother branham Billy Paul and all them in the cookhouse and I went the next tent was one year where brother branham and I and I believe I bleep her this off man was there and we I was rolling up my head my bag my sleeping bag did on my hands and knees and rolling up sleeping bag and brother Brent crawls in on his hands and knees part of the tent he sits in squats down he said well brother Eddie said I really hate to see you're going and I said yeah I hate to go - he said oh he said just be nice if we could just be up here for a month or so and the Sun would come out and shine nice and warm and we'd go up and see some big Rams in these mountains and I bit my lip because I was starting to tremble a wee bit and I was saying within myself for the Branum don't do this to me you're just killing me you know and then he turned real serious and he said but I know he said you know you've got a family and you got to work and you've got responsibilities I understand they said and I understand about the church in Dawson Creek the UPC was trying to take it away and he said I understand about the church in Dawson Creek and about your sister that's all he had to say I'm here preaching tonight and I told that sister of the prophets words praying that they would anchor in her heart that she could never have peace till she has received this Lord Jesus Christ amen friends I'm where I'm with you we're all in this together I'm holding fast hallelujah we've got battles to fight and I'm saying she's not yours devil she's not yours God's pokes her prophets mouth and spoke some things and said some things says he has another intention amen now give you part of my testimony now do we have about twenty minutes is that Alright you have never heard this has it never been written in a book and I only give it because there have been those who have took it upon themselves to go public and to say some things which I think are not right and I feel it it would be good to alert you and make you to know it as well and this concerns the brown bear vision the brother Brown spoke of and there's no record of it happening how many have that have had that question for you understand you heard about it quite a few how many raise your hands all right I want to be forthright and yet honest this is my testimony and I speak it because I was there these men who I'm familiar with and acquainted with took it upon themselves and on on the Internet have gone on a site called believe the sign when these men put that site up they were indeed professing to be believers but I say without any hesitation they have since become enemies of the message and still maintain that site to me it is so cunning that people would come on and with it with the heading believe the sign the web the website the web page believe the sign when in fact those behind it have their full intention to see that you don't believe the sign and I am here to be truthful to be honest with you and to show you in the message so that you are never shaken by such a thing on the site you will see in May 1962 possessing all things brother Branham said many of you remember the vision that I had where I had shot the grizzly bear 9 foot grizzly bear and the church remembers me telling it here and the caribou I was in that that took six hours that vision to be fulfilled so I'm not speaking of that I am the one in the green checkered shirt that was waiting for him said I had another remember it's on tape here and I seen a great huge brown bear that might be a Kodiak and it wouldn't have worked down here there in Canada because they're not there you see but wherever it will be it will be it'll be it will be that's thus saith the Lord it will be in the next slide then he comes out now may 1962 now this is June 1962 the next month now I'm going back into the country that you might know when I come back next year I'm going to get a brown bear that's almost twice that size you see if it's right or not I seen it when we were standing put my hands on his haunches laying on the ground like that and I could put my hands on his hips like that and him laying down now you find out if that's right or not then in August she just just hold that one off a moment would you please in August of 1962 we went up on the hunt and these people who put the sign up said william branham william branham returned to british columbia in July of 1962 these are their comments and preached six services on Vancouver Island those are the services which we arranged my wife played the piano and I was on the platform but did not fulfill the vision of the tie at that time he returned in British Columbia to British Columbia again in October 1964 with Perry green but did not fulfill the vision at that time either when william branham passed away on December 25th 1965 the vision had never been fulfilled what does that mean the question it means that when william branham said in 1962 that he would shoot a brown bear in british columbia and that this was thus saith the lord he spoke presumptuously and presumptuously is to infer that someone is speaking beyond the realm of authority their realm of authority he was speaking presumptuously now if you'll go back please to September 1962 and the reason I understand this is because this was after the hunt that I'm going to describe in a few moments and now brother Branham says so I in these thirty going on thirty two years of ministry I have tried to stay true to the word I don't know of one thing I've ever had to alter on because I just read it out of the Bible just it said just what the Bible said and let it go like that and so I haven't had to try to back or rearrange because I just said it the way that the Bible says it and I find out if God now notice if God has spoken anything then we must go with that word in or to make it be fulfilled he said we seen that as I told you last night of a vision just recently see that it I had to be there I had to be there he's just finished saying you have to you must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled and he said now I had to be there and warning to be there and telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and saying go down there three times with them and I just walked on with the other men and the vision passed right through exactly God's part and I was left standing you understand so we want to remember you've got to stay on the word just stay right with the word and where the word leads you go right with the word and it'll bring you out all right I'm sure now the reason why I understand that is because I was there in August with him and this is what happened it's my testimony brother Branham did not describe in detail the brown bear vision like he did of the caribou in the Grizzly which he told him very fine detailed the measurement of the horn and so on and however he did say that he was out with some small fellows when he got this particular bear and here are the details as it happened we traveled on horseback about 25 miles and we made camp way far into the Rocky Mountain trench mountains on all sides beautiful place mother Brown said it was just like beyond the curtain of time and we made camp and the next next day we looked and we we just saw you know it was a beautiful day and brother brother Southwick he said to his son Blaine there was Blaine his son Billy Paul brother branham son myself brother Southwick and brother branham and brother brother Southwick suffered with angina a little bit so he couldn't exert himself too much and so climbing he was slower than us younger fellows we were about half their age I was 27 brother branham was 52 I might have been 28 and he might have been 53 our first time I was 27 he was 52 so brother Brown is a brother Southwick said Blaine he said you take her brother Billy Paul and Eddie and to a certain direction he directed us and he said and I'll take brother branham and we'll go here on the hill a mountain right behind the camp is beautiful grass not much trees and willows and easy climb much easier than where we were going and so we left we left that morning and walked we walked to a place down this beautiful magnificent Valley and then a mountain was here and there was a small valley like a v-shaped valley which came up to a ridge and a saddle down from this mountain and went up between these two mountains and so we'd climb partway up and what we'd call the first ledge the first bench of this mountain and it just came around like this in this valley going this direction big valley vast vast areas and we got up on this bench and we just just as we started to walk on this bench we look up and here's a massive bear coming down equal to us but he's coming down just on the other side of this little V and it's widening out a wee bit until here when it flows into this valley it turns this way and this arse turns this way and so when we saw him coming down we got behind some willows and and kind of hid and because there wasn't any trees or bushes such but just these willows and we got down behind the Willows and he's coming down we watched him for perhaps as long as a half an hour and he's turning over stones and they're looking for rodents and looking for they also eat roots these big big grizzly bears and so he just moseying his way down feeding as he came and he came right down across from us dead across from us I have never seen a bear like this I've lived in the north most of my life I've been in the woods I've been in camps were as I said in the meeting I haven't had dogs as a friend but I've had bears because they were in camp every night dumping over the garbage cans and so on they were so common black bears and whatever more but this bear I have never seen a bear like that he was massive absolutely massive I'm not exaggerating but the outstanding feature of him is from he was dark he was dark in color but right behind his ears came a band from his hump as the Grizzlies have a hump a band about I would say about a foot wide coming right down and down over his chest over his Cape area like this and it was the color of golden wheat absolutely ripe harvest wheat it was gold I have never seen an animal like that in my life brother Blane Southwick who still lives has told me that that is the largest grizzly he's ever seen are the largest berries over same and he thought it probably would go a thousand pounds that was a massive massive animal and he just stood and he was on this Bluff and we're on this one right across so Blaine and Billy both are they're saying shoot him brother Eddie shoot him why don't you shoot him and I said no no I'm not I'm not gonna shoot him I said brother branham heaven I don't think even fired a shot and I I you know we want want him to get something and so we just watched him and we watched maybe 10 15 minutes and they were after a while I said why don't you shoot him take a shot you know I said no I don't want to shoot him it's quite a distance but I had a very flat shooting gun and I said no IIIi won't shoot him I said I want brother branham to get a shot first and get an animal and then that bear he just stands there like this and he goes his head massive head goes up and it just waves it from side to side like this and I know that he's got a wind of something and he's smelling their eyesight is very poor but boy they're scent of smell is just incredible and he's going like this and we're over here he goes like this just like that I he's zero driving on where we where we were probably five six hundred yards away he just looked like that and then he just wheeled around this way and started straight up this mountain and he and he a ram came through the glacier went right over the glacier great big paw marks we're watching him in our scope and went over the top he was gone somewhere between twelve and fifteen minutes over over that mountain peak it was the most incredible thing so we continued on that and then that evening when we got back to camp we said well we saw this magnificent barren and they haven't shot anything and so that night some somewhere in the night started to rain and it rained rain steady rained the next day clouds hanging down rained the next day rain the next night rain the next day rain the next night rain never let up rain the next day one two three four days and nights and just rained everything was just sobbing let heavy clouds cold miserable and brother-brother Southwick he I was the kind of the point man because I arranged the Hunts bought the food and so on and you actually when you buy the food for a hunt you count how many eggs you're going to eat a day each how many slices of bread because you got to pack it on horses all that distance so if there was any message brother branham want to get to butter something yeah they would talk between themselves butter there's anything having to do with the arrangement they would generally say well you know so bud says to me just in an attempt we're all in the tent but he says he's I guess brother Brandon wants to go home I said what I turn around brother Brown was over here his brother branham I said you want to go home all he said we've had a wonderful time brother Eddie I would my heart just went down to this my boots I said we just got here we just started you haven't fired a shot he said that means I can come back next year that didn't satisfy me I just thought I said well you know I didn't know what to say I just didn't couldn't believe that he was going to leave and then he said well you know he said by the time I get home I've been gone quite a while and I started to think yeah a day we rode in today we ride out that's two days four days sitting in there that six days he drives up probably three days you know one has to drive back yeah he's it's over two weeks by the time he gets back I said I understand so we start to dismantle things we have to pack everything and but he just does one job he did not like and he began to pack all the food and the stuff and we're all working around we had to pack everything up in the tent roll up our bags and get all ready and then in the horses now let me tell you folks in case you don't know horses hate to be packed up when they're wet and cold and get those saddles and cinches on their wet cold skin they're just like humans they don't want to they don't want that and so we have to start finding the horses and bringing them in and tying them up and putting the saddle blankets 100 the saddles pack saddles and cinch it up and our riding horses or you know there's there's 35 of us and so I I got on my horse I just sitting on the horse everything is so cold and Bud is starting to pack the panniers as the side boxes on the horse and the Blaine has to help him it it's a two-man job and brother branham came out he says brother Eddie he said where did you brother see that bear I said right down here I said you just go down this valley and that first first little Valley that you see going up into the mountain he was right there on that first ledge that's where he was right on the edge of it and so he said I wonder I wonder how much longer we're gonna be bud he says how long will it be before we have to pull out but says oh you've got all kinds of time he says we're not leaving here for two-three hours or whatever he said you know it'll be noon before we're gone he said just go on you know and just go you got lots of time so brother branham just took off in that direction and I just saw him disappear in the Willows and he was gone and there's not much that I could do because you know we're just helping out and whatever more and then and then when I bought maybe hour and a half to two hours later brother branham came back I was sitting on my horse at that time in rain gear but the bud was just up a few yards from me and brother branham came up and stood right beside my horse right here and he looked up and he says brother Eddie he said I'm the Jonah in this group now all I can tell you is the truth I'm the Jonah in this group and he pointed to the sky said this is on account of me he said it's only the second time I know in my life that i disobeyed a vision he said you know that first time was in in Africa and then he started talking about Africa and and and he didn't I remembered that there was a time when the ministers and different men were trying to persuade him to go someplace or have meetings or whatever more and then I think that's when he got sick and he said and it's the only second time that I know that i disobeyed a vision and he said just like this but it's over and we'll ride out of here dry friends but it's over and we'll ride how to here dry there's the most unbelievable words that you could possibly hear and I didn't even respond I didn't know about the other vision I didn't I didn't know that this was part of the vision that had taken place but now he's identified it and said it's on account of me and so I'm sitting on my horse and I'm just I'm just I'm pondering the event caught in kind of the vortex of something but it was not unusual to have this kind of experience with this servant of God and while I'm sitting there I think probably 10 12 15 minutes I'm just sitting there and it was a puff a puff of air I it's not a wind but it was just a puff a movement of air if it passed me that way I remembered like it was five minutes ago I thought that was warm it was so nice and warm and and and and then there was an air movement but no wind no breeze just air movement and it just increased and kept moving around like the action clouds all hanging down low and everything just soggy wet and now this air movement going in and then kind of turned into a bit of a breeze in a few moments and and the Willows were right about where this wall is in here where this brother sitting that's where the Willows were and the horses were tied in there and we were to pack them and and I notice a leaves on the Willows starting to shake like that hear me now two minutes walking through those bushes you'll be soaked to the hide everything was so soaking wet and now I see the leaves are just moving and shaking like that and and I was just sitting there on the horse and right out in front of me probably where these sisters are sitting maybe a little further they're just a big a big ah sunshine struck the earth and I thought now looked up like this and there was a like just big hole in the sky and I was looking for the first time at blue sky hadn't seen blue sky for days I didn't think anything spiritual I just thought isn't that nice you know for sunshine I've seen in days and and that Suns and little balmy air moving around I thought it's just great and before long that you know the whole of sunshine got bigger and bigger and finally it was you know surrounding us and I take off my rain gear and take off that in and I'm finding in my shirtsleeves and before our horses took one step it was I I cannot tell you there wasn't a cloud but I never saw a cloud the sky was just blue from from one peak to the other and we rode out of there that day the next eight hours in hot sunshine of the northern and up there that Sun doesn't go down till very very late in the day probably nine ten o'clock at night and all I can tell you I tell you friends you may wonder why I preach with such earnest zeal I have been in these kind of experiences and I want to tell you that if I had rolled up wet I would not be here behind this pulpit said the only second time I know that i disobeyed a vision and he said that vision passed by exactly God's part I was not where I and left me standing he wasn't standing where he was supposed to be vision gods part God uses man Moses didn't always do exactly what he was supposed to do but yet God didn't God didn't change his mind is still prophet he's still God's prophet still comes with God's Word and that's exactly and I'd like to hear you say amen amen thank you God bless you it's been a pleasure to be with you hey [Applause] [Music]
