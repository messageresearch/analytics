[1:15] in this series of episodes I would like
[1:20] to relate to you the things that I saw
[1:26] the things that I heard and the things
[1:30] which I experienced the purpose of these
[1:33] episodes is to acquaint you with the
[1:38] supernatural that's very essential to
[1:43] acquaint you with the supernatural which
[1:46] God did in and through the Ministry of
[1:50] William Branham and how God continues
[1:55] that's what's very significant how God
[1:59] continues to produce the supernatural
[2:03] through the ministry even to this
[2:07] present time proving that Jesus Christ
[2:10] is the same yesterday today and forever
[2:17] and that's the key believing that this
[2:21] Jesus Christ who spoke and who was
[2:25] recorded in the in the Bible and that
[2:29] Jesus of the Old Testament or God of the
[2:34] Old Testament is Jesus of the new and we
[2:37] have the Holy Spirit today it's the same
[2:40] God in all of those events and it shall
[2:47] come to pass the scripture says if they
[2:50] will not believe thee God speaking to
[2:53] Moses neither hearken to the voice of
[2:57] the first sign
[2:59] that they will believe the voice of the
[3:02] latter sign and if the supernatural
[3:06] doesn't have a voice that follows it a
[3:09] voice that reveals Jesus Christ to the
[3:13] people I'll be with you even in you to
[3:21] the end of the world is that true
[3:24] then Sam to disbelieve strictly stranger
[3:28] to me you're from away from here you
[3:32] come from another city you've got a lot
[3:36] of trouble all in your heart you got
[3:38] heart trouble if you begin with that
[3:40] right there's a whole lot of blackness
[3:43] must be a black sheet keep following you
[3:44] like that what's the last number I sold
[3:47] allowance and that was a man was
[3:49] professor divine healing he said uses
[3:52] the wind is that true and you got a
[3:56] horse turn your church there's nothing
[3:57] about it in that rap your pastors sick
[3:59] right so I've got polio is that right
[4:01] sister don't feel tension well then
[4:04] people tell you they're alive and the
[4:07] only thing wrong with your hearts that
[4:08] nervous condition got your heart worship
[4:09] world home and peace and God bless you
[4:12] you're all ours
[4:15] ask now that ever demons power in this
[4:18] feeling of evil
[4:23] we were not defeated taken after the in
[4:28] the name
[4:30] come out of the people
[4:32] and a few crippled people although we
[4:34] occur in Psalms God spoke through David
[4:43] and he said lo he doth send his voice
[4:47] and that a mighty voice Jesus when he
[4:51] came and there was God in Christ
[4:54] reconciling the world to himself jesus
[4:58] said my sheep hear my voice and I know
[5:03] them and they follow me
[5:07] that just couldn't be clearer my sheep
[5:11] know my voice I know them and they
[5:16] follow me and then speaking of the voice
[5:21] that would come in this last time but in
[5:23] the days of the voice of the seventh
[5:26] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[5:30] mystery of God should be finished as he
[5:34] hath declared it to his servants of
[5:37] prophets we say what is this mystery it
[5:40] is so that the voice will be in the
[5:43] bride so the prophet of God has said God
[5:47] raised up others and so it has gone on
[5:52] through the years until this last day
[5:56] there is again another people in the
[6:00] land who under their messenger will be
[6:04] the final voice to the final age and we
[6:10] can quote the words of Jesus when he
[6:14] said it is not you that speak but the
[6:20] Spirit of your father which speaketh in
[6:24] you and if all believers of this message
[6:29] would take those words that I've just
[6:32] spoken concerning it's always been the
[6:35] voice revealing they Almighty God to us
[6:41] and to realize it's not just something
[6:45] that we heard and
[6:46] we received this is what has connected
[6:49] the same Bible
[6:51] I don't read another Bible but the same
[6:54] Bible has just become alive and the
[6:58] opening of the word the opening of the
[7:02] scriptures things that we could not see
[7:05] or understand have become so clear and
[7:09] this is our great ambition to make this
[7:12] known and furthermore I would like to
[7:16] advise anyone regardless of what you
[7:19] have heard and way regardless of what
[7:23] you've heard positive or negative I can
[7:27] tell you that I would recommend to you
[7:30] to do the same thing that I did if the
[7:34] angel of the Lord was at the platform
[7:38] and I am a witness of these things I was
[7:41] there I saw it on the platform I saw it
[7:45] as the prophet of God spoke to the
[7:48] people and I knew the people some of
[7:51] them were from my church and I knew that
[7:54] the angel of the Lord would not use or
[7:58] human vessel to speak things that were
[8:01] not true it had to be absolutely true
[8:04] and God is a God of truth and it speaks
[8:08] of Jesus Christ he was full of truth and
[8:11] grace and I can say that in the
[8:14] revealing of himself it was absolutely
[8:17] true until you have somebody that can
[8:21] stand in the public year after year
[8:24] after year for many years and reveal the
[8:28] secret of the heart only God can do that
[8:32] tell where the people were till the war
[8:35] they were standing tell them what their
[8:37] suffering with tell them whether they
[8:39] live or they will die I mean that kind
[8:43] of that kind of voice is the voice that
[8:46] I want to hear and follow and that's the
[8:50] voice that a person will hear
[8:54] long after this life is over that's the
[8:58] voice that's the voice of Almighty God
[9:01] and I can tell you that that is what I
[9:04] experienced and it is true
