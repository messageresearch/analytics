[1:08] ever true? It's changing me and it's
[1:13] changing you.
[1:16] We have come Lord with open hearts
[1:21] for the word of God.

[1:52] changing
[1:55] you.
[1:56] We have come with high
[2:06] [Music]
[2:09] desire this morning.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandom was talking about Elisha
[2:15] how he called a minstrel
[2:19] so he could get in the spirit.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; He said so they got to play in the
[2:24] music. Now listen, if you can't be the
[2:26] prophet, you can be one of the
[2:27] instruments.
[2:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; You know that plays the music to bring
[2:31] the spirit down on the prophet.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So they began to
[2:36] play so forth. Beat the drums. Brother
[2:39] Chris here. Play the instruments. We
[2:41] have the musicians. They began to beat
[2:44] and play. Started singing there will be
[2:46] a meeting in the air and the sweet sweet
[2:47] by and by. Said the prophet began to get
[2:51] into the spirit and the first thing you
[2:52] know when he got into the spirit things
[2:54] began to happen.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter. We can't get
[2:58] anywhere today.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; We don't get the spirit of it. That's
[3:02] it. You got to get in the spirit of it.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; They begin to get to clapping their
[3:08] hands really having a good time and the
[3:10] spirit of God begin to fall on the
[3:11] prophet. His spirit got on the prophet.
[3:14] Then he began to see things.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; You'll go to seeing things when you get
[3:18] in the spirit.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; How many want to see something from God
[3:22] this morning?
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, the onus is on you this
[3:24] morning to get in the spirit.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to sing some songs. We
[3:28] got some wonderful brothers here going
[3:29] to come up in a few minutes. Don't be a
[3:32] spectator.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; Don't be a spectator. Be a participant.
[3:38] Amen. And then you're going to see the
[3:41] things of God here. this morning. Amen.
[3:43] [Music]
[3:45] We have a wonderful testimony before we
[3:47] sing.
[3:49] How many of you praying for brother
[3:51] David Paris, a little brother? Amen.

[3:59] Paris complete healing.

[4:17] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[4:22] Hallelujah.
[4:25] Thank you Lord.
[4:27] The doctors were able to perform a
[4:28] special procedure that they didn't think
[4:30] they'd be able to perform.
[4:32] They thought they'd have to remove
[4:35] almost his entire pancreas and as a
[4:38] result he would have been a diabetic. So
[4:40] he would have gone from the problem he
[4:41] had to another problem. Said he only had
[4:44] 20% of his pancreas removed. The blood
[4:46] sugars were normal immediately after the
[4:49] surgery. Amazing. Both the nurses and
[4:51] the doctors. All praise, honor, and
[4:53] glory to our Lord. Amen.
[4:56] [Music]
[5:04] Amen. We're going to sing uh this is for
[5:07] brother Gary. We were talking the other
[5:09] night and so brother Gary, this is for
[5:11] you. My hope is in the Lord. Let's stand

[19:54] moment to to tell you how honored we are
[19:57] to get to be here in this service with
[19:58] all of you this morning.
[20:01] Never dreamed that it would ever be
[20:04] possible. We tried many times, but
[20:06] something just happened that we couldn't
[20:08] make it. But it is a tremendous honor to
[20:10] be in your presence this morning. Now,
[20:12] more than all that, it's a tremendous
[20:14] honor to be in the presence of the King
[20:16] of Kings
[20:17] &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; We're glad that the Lord has permitted
[20:22] us to make this trip to be with you.

[20:43] God as our pastor as you are here. You

[20:46] speaks to you in the name of the Lord.
[20:48] Certainly we do.
[20:53] We're going to sing one more song and
[20:55] then we're going to sit down. Looking
[20:56] forward to the preaching of the word of
[20:57] the Lord this morning. But honest from
[21:00] our hearts,
[21:01] it is a tremendous honor, isn't it,
[21:03] Brother Kenneth? Great,
[21:04] &gt;&gt; brother. for us to get to be with you.
[21:07] Finally, our
[21:08] &gt;&gt; I want to say something.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. I ain't done.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; My name is Lyn Young.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; My name is Len.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Lol. Yeah. He's been called everything
[21:17] from Lionel to Linard to uh
[21:21] &gt;&gt; something to mention that
[21:21] &gt;&gt; other places. But uh Lenal Laniel

[21:31] [Music]
[21:32] But truly, it is a a tremendous honor to
[21:35] get to be with you this morning. May the
[21:36] Lord richly bless you as we journey here
[21:39] together in this life. We know that
[21:40] we're reaching and looking for a time
[21:43] where we'll never ever have to say
[21:45] goodbye. Never ever have to worry about
[21:48] leaving, shaking one another's hands for
[21:50] the last time. It won't happen over
[21:52] there. Aren't you excited about getting
[21:53] to go to a place like that? May the Lord
[21:56] bless you. Let's sing this song this
[21:57] morning. I believe in a hill called
[22:00] Mount Calvary. I appreciate the blood
[22:02] still being real in my life to my life
[22:04] this morning. Do you appreciate it?
[22:06] Amen. and he'll call that.
[22:08] [Music]
[22:31] I believe
[22:34] in a hill called
[22:37] Mount Calary.
[22:40] [Music]
[22:43] And I believe
[22:47] whatever
[22:50] the go.
[22:56] And when time
[22:59] has surrendered
[23:02] and earth
[23:05] is no more,
[23:08] I'll still cling
[23:11] to the old ruged.
[23:20] There are things
[23:23] as we travel
[23:27] this earth
[23:29] shifting sands
[23:32] that transcend all
[23:36] the reason
[23:39] of me
[23:44] and the things that really matter.
[23:51] the most in this world.
[23:56] You can't hold them
[23:59] in the palms of your hand.
[24:08] I believe
[24:11] in that Christ
[24:14] who was slain
[24:17] on the cross
[24:20] has the power
[24:23] to change
[24:26] lives today.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; For
[24:32] he changed.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. me completely
[24:37] and a new life
[24:40] is mine. Oh, and that is why
[24:45] by the cross I will stand.
[24:54] I believe
[24:57] in a hill called
[25:00] Mount Calary.
[25:05] And I believe
[25:09] whatever
[25:12] the call.
[25:17] And when time
[25:20] has surrendered
[25:24] and earth
[25:26] is no more,
[25:29] I'll still cling
[25:32] to the old rug.
[25:41] And when time
[25:43] has surrendered
[25:47] and earth
[25:49] is no more,
[25:52] I still
[25:54] [Music]
[25:59] cross.

[28:06] but there's a much better love story, a
[28:08] much greater love story. Amen. Our
[28:10] brothers were singing about Let's sing
[28:12] this together as uh I I understand

[30:14] congregation sounds like a choir.
[30:17] Why shouldn't it be
[30:18] &gt;&gt; heavenly choir?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; And we're adding a member to the choir.
[30:23] She doesn't know it yet, but
[30:27] now you have.
[30:29] Hi.
[30:31] Three daughters also. Yeah. And a son.
[30:35] That wonderful. That's why we need a
[30:38] school.
[30:41] We might need some extra walls here or
[30:44] expand the balcony or something, but God
[30:47] makes room for everyone.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; We're happy that you're all here, and
[30:51] we're happy for brother Marcus and
[30:53] Sister Anne and bringing their young one
[30:55] here, Sister Anne's mother, is uh has is
[31:00] leaving real soon now back for New
[31:02] Zealand. And the sister Anne's mother is
[31:07] of course the wife of brother Donald
[31:08] Derekson.
[31:10] Donaldson, I'm sorry. Brother Derek
[31:12] Donaldelsson.
[31:13] Brother Derek happens to be one of my
[31:16] favorite ministers.
[31:17] And he just uh I I want to send a
[31:21] message back with your mother, which I
[31:22] did, Sister Anne, that when he preaches,
[31:26] he bring brings the word just from such
[31:28] a direction. And I've always been happy
[31:30] for him. And now this uh young one which
[31:34] our brother Marcus and sister Anne has
[31:38] been blessed with
[31:40] as a daughter
[31:42] may have named her Stephanie
[31:46] Anastasia
[31:48] or Anastasia
[31:50] however you pronounce it.
[31:53] uh Stephanie a crown or a garland
[31:58] and Anna Stasha
[32:01] resurrection
[32:02] and that happens to be very fitting with
[32:04] my message today. Also the scripture
[32:08] which I wish to use and leave with you
[32:11] brother Marcus and sister an is this
[32:14] scripture
[32:16] that is in Deuteronomy.
[32:20] And thou shalt teach them diligently
[32:24] unto thy children, and shall talk of
[32:27] them when thou sitest in thine house,
[32:30] and when thou walkest by the way,
[32:34] and when thou liest down, and when thou
[32:36] riseest up. That pretty well covers the
[32:39] whole scope of our life.
[32:42] That's 3657.
[32:47] I was just in some foreign countries in
[32:50] the last few weeks
[32:53] and I saw some little children just like
[32:56] yours here and they were from m mixed
[32:59] mixed uh languages.
[33:02] Uh the mother spoke one language and
[33:04] that was her her mother tongue was one
[33:05] language and the father's mother tongue
[33:07] was another language and then they had a
[33:10] a third language
[33:12] and they were telling me because I'd
[33:15] hear that little one and sometimes she's
[33:17] speaking French and the next time she's
[33:19] speaking German and and I thought this
[33:21] is absolutely miraculous and then they'd
[33:23] speak to her in French and she'd answer
[33:24] in German.
[33:26] She was just as free with one language
[33:28] as another.
[33:30] And how they learned that was because
[33:33] they heard it,
[33:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:35] &gt;&gt; And they hear even the pronunciation
[33:39] and they acquire an accent.
[33:43] Sister Anne has been living in Canada
[33:45] quite a few years, but she still has
[33:47] some of that New Zealand accent.
[33:51] Of course, brother Sirill says that's
[33:52] what they're going to speak in in the
[33:54] millennium. So,
[33:57] so whatever accent they speak over
[33:59] there, that's the accent I want to
[34:01] speak. Don't you? And you know, then we
[34:04] have brother Louis Blevens and the Jans
[34:06] brothers here and they have a little
[34:08] different accent, but we understand
[34:11] uh and as you speak in the home, Brother
[34:14] Marcus, Sister Anne, this child will
[34:17] acquire what she hears and how she hears
[34:22] it. And I pray that God will just give
[34:24] you such divine wisdom that you'll never
[34:26] forget that when she was dedicated.
[34:29] Let her hear it in the evening. Let her
[34:31] hear it in the morning. Let her hear it
[34:33] at the table. And I She'll have a
[34:36] different language. She'll hear as we
[34:39] heard sung this morning. She'll hear
[34:41] Jesus. I know she'll hear that very
[34:43] early. May she acquire that.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; She'll hear rapture.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; She'll hear resurrection. what her name
[34:52] has and I I pray that she will acquire
[34:55] the depth of the meaning of it and we're
[34:57] going to dedicate her to the Lord as God
[34:59] has given her to you and pray that she
[35:01] shall surely be a blessing in your home.
[35:12] Dear heavenly father, we hold this gift
[35:15] that you have given now.
[35:18] And my brother Marcus and sister Anne,
[35:20] Lord, have received her with loving arms
[35:22] and now they are offering her back to
[35:25] you. But we're praying, Father, that
[35:28] every day that you have ordained that
[35:30] she should live on earth. I pray that
[35:32] her life will be a blessing. I ask that
[35:35] it'll be a joy in the home. I pray,
[35:38] Father, that as I have spoken these
[35:40] words of counsel, that her ears will
[35:42] hear early all of the statements and a
[35:46] great message of grace. I pray, Father,
[35:49] that her little soul will just respond
[35:53] so quickly. And I pray, oh God, that you
[35:57] will find here a temple to indwell.
[36:01] She's s in my arms now in her innocence,
[36:04] Lord. And I pray that you shall keep her
[36:06] in just such a state. May she come to
[36:08] know you very early in her life and may
[36:12] she live for you all the days of her
[36:14] life. And on that day, she will form
[36:17] part of this circle and it shall not be
[36:20] broken. We claim that in the name of the
[36:22] Lord Jesus Christ. And so, Father, now I
[36:25] dedicate Stephanie Anastasia to you and
[36:29] I pray, oh God, that you will receive
[36:31] her as her parents have received her.
[36:33] You will receive her that much more. We
[36:36] thank you for that. We thank you, Lord.
[36:38] We have the confidence this child shall
[36:42] be a blessing in the kingdom of God.
[36:45] Amen.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Marcus.
[36:51] God bless you, sister.
[36:54] Well, they got a quiver full.
[36:59] Ain't that wonderful?
[37:02] We're rejoicing with a wonderful
[37:03] testimony for our little brother David
[37:06] Paris. Uh we're just rejoicing over
[37:09] that. I have another one also. We've
[37:12] been praying for uh for the last two
[37:15] weeks for our brother Jean Jacques in
[37:18] Switzerland. and he's been going this
[37:21] last week he's been all week been going
[37:23] through another series of tests with
[37:25] neurologists
[37:27] uh one after the other with him testing
[37:30] every day every day they tested the
[37:33] healing had increased
[37:35] and already already one woman doctor
[37:38] came to Joel his son and said these
[37:42] words your father is a real miracle
[37:47] &gt;&gt; but they had a new neurologist, a
[37:49] specialist come in to speak with him and
[37:53] to take him through a whole series of
[37:54] tests. And when this neurologist was
[37:57] finished, he said, "There has been some
[38:00] mistake
[38:02] because Jean Jacques can't be this
[38:05] patient."
[38:09] &gt;&gt; But he was. Hallelujah.
[38:20] Is God real?
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[38:25] We've had such a blessing also with the
[38:28] entire Iberson family that have been
[38:31] here. Brother Nathaniel's brothers and
[38:34] sister.
[38:36] Uh they wanted to speak about uh about
[38:39] the hub and and the things that have
[38:41] been taking place.
[38:44] uh getting the brother Brandham's
[38:46] message in a massive digital library.
[38:49] The hub is up and operating and
[38:50] operating in some countries now and is
[38:53] expanding very very quickly and uh they
[38:55] had of course heard about it. They
[38:57] wanted to speak directly uh with us
[39:00] about it and they spoke with brother
[39:02] Darren also about the technical part. Uh
[39:05] brother David Iverson who is uh
[39:08] ministering now and traveling and
[39:10] ministering. Uh it would have been nice
[39:12] to have heard you, brother David, but it
[39:15] just uh with the wedding and everything
[39:17] taking place, it was difficult. But
[39:19] these brothers became so inspired and he
[39:22] said, "I have on a zip file in his
[39:24] pocket." He had 400 Dutch messages, but
[39:28] they were but they were in a file that
[39:30] they were in a certain format we thought
[39:32] we couldn't get. It changed over without
[39:34] quite a bit of difficulty, but they
[39:36] spoke with brother Darren and he said,
[39:37] "You know, there's always ways to do
[39:39] things in this
[39:41] computer world. And uh so the brothers
[39:44] uh the Iverson brothers, they sat down,
[39:47] all brought in laptops, all went to
[39:50] work, and this last week uh for
[39:54] reformatted and uploaded, which is now
[39:57] on the hub, 348
[39:59] Dutch messages.
[40:10] So I I said, "Well, where we were last
[40:13] night at the in Abbottzford, that has to
[40:16] be the Dutch center of Canada almost,
[40:19] there's a lot of Dutch-speaking people
[40:21] there and many, many in this valley. So
[40:24] we're so thankful for that." And uh
[40:26] Brother and Sister Iverson, uh you have
[40:29] a wonderful family and we've been we've
[40:32] been delighted to have them all here.
[40:34] And as long as you've been here, they
[40:35] have to leave today. We just say God
[40:37] bless you. God prosper your journey. God
[40:40] prosper your ministries. God prosper
[40:42] your work. Keep you in good health. And
[40:44] greet all the saints when you get back
[40:46] to Belgium and Europe for us. Amen.
[40:49] Amen. I'll have you stand if you would
[40:52] please. Like to
[40:55] I'm going to read some scripture in a
[40:57] moment. Uh you can turn to Genesis the
[41:01] first chapter.
[41:08] And before we read, I'm going to ask you
[41:10] to bow in prayer with me.
[41:17] Dear Father,
[41:20] we believe that you ordained
[41:23] the times and the seasons
[41:26] and you have ordained that we would be
[41:29] at s certain places at certain times. We
[41:34] believe that it has been pre-arranged.
[41:37] I believe and I'm absolutely confident
[41:40] this morning that you have
[41:42] every person who's supposed to be in
[41:44] this building, every person who is
[41:47] streaming, you have created the hunger,
[41:50] the thirst, the desire,
[41:53] and you know what it is that we have
[41:55] need of. I believe also that you have
[41:58] prepared the very food in season for us.
[42:03] We have reveled in your word.
[42:06] We are so delighted. We're so satisfied.
[42:09] We're so contented when we feed on the
[42:12] revelation of the word of God. Let it
[42:14] not be some intellectual thing. Lord,
[42:17] let it not just come to our to our human
[42:20] ears, but may it come to the hearing of
[42:22] the soul. I pray that the Holy Spirit
[42:26] will convey it and carry it, Lord,
[42:28] through that lifeam of the Holy Ghost to
[42:31] our very inner being. And may we be
[42:35] revelated, Lord. May we be inspired. And
[42:38] I pray that it'll remove all darkness in
[42:41] the name of Jesus Christ. We loose every
[42:44] person, oh God, to the will of God, to
[42:47] the purpose of God, and that we might
[42:49] fulfill what you have for us here in
[42:53] this life now in the name of Jesus
[42:55] Christ. Amen.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. All right. We will
[43:00] turn now to Genesis, the first chapter.
[43:04] And I'm going to read uh just a very few
[43:08] verses here and then we're we will read
[43:10] out of Matthew 4.
[43:13] Genesis 1:3 and 4.
[43:17] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[43:20] there was light.
[43:22] And God saw the light that it was good.
[43:26] And God divided the light from the
[43:28] darkness.
[43:30] I'd like to read down also to verse 14.
[43:34] And God said, "Let there be lights in
[43:36] the firmament of the heaven to divide
[43:39] the day from the night. And let them be
[43:42] for signs and for seasons and for days
[43:47] and for years." So that was that light.
[43:51] and verse 15, "And let them be for
[43:53] lights in the firmament of the heaven to
[43:57] give light upon the earth." And it was
[44:00] so. Now, before we read in Matthew, I'd
[44:04] like you just to notice this is in the
[44:06] in the natural creation that God he he
[44:12] didn't just say, "Let there be light,"
[44:13] but he said, "Let there be light. Let it
[44:15] be in the firmament
[44:18] and let it be for signs and let it be
[44:20] for seasons. So there's a purpose.
[44:23] There's an order. He placed the light in
[44:26] a certain place to shine in a certain
[44:29] direction and to shine on the earth, a
[44:31] womb for his seeds so that it would do
[44:35] specific things. It had a divi it had a
[44:38] divine purpose in the mind of God and it
[44:41] has been fulfilling that. All right. Now
[44:43] we will read in Matthew the 4th chapter
[44:47] and we're reading now here about another
[44:49] light the sen light and the Bible says
[44:54] in the fourth chapter 13th verse of
[44:56] Matthew and leaving Nazareth he came and
[45:00] dwelt in Capernaum
[45:03] which is upon the sea coast in the
[45:05] borders of Zabulon and Nephilim
[45:09] that it might be fulfilled which was
[45:11] spoken by the by Isaiah the prophet,
[45:14] saying, "The land of Zebulon and the
[45:17] land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea
[45:20] beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
[45:24] the people which sat in darkness saw
[45:27] great light. And to them which sat in
[45:30] the region and shadow of death, light is
[45:34] sprung up." And from that time Jesus
[45:38] began to preach and to say, "Repent, for
[45:41] the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Amen.
[45:44] You may be seated.
[45:57] I just want to say just before we start
[45:59] the end of the message, I so so enjoyed
[46:04] the Jon brothers and brother Louie
[46:07] Blevens
[46:10] and Brother Lenol.
[46:13] I said it right this time.
[46:16] uh we've seen you before and heard you
[46:20] sing and last night was just something
[46:22] special your comments before the songs
[46:26] and I said to a brother in the study I
[46:29] felt as though I got to know you last
[46:30] night
[46:32] and wonderful just to get to know one
[46:35] another and be blessed by the ministry
[46:38] we'll be hearing more from them this
[46:40] evening I want to speak to you on the
[46:43] light
[46:44] the light beyond the veil.
[46:49] God created this first light. We read
[46:51] the first scriptures
[46:54] and there was light in the heavens
[46:57] with a divine and specific purpose.
[47:00] There was another light. It was a pillar
[47:02] of fire in a burning bush.
[47:06] There was a light in the tabernacle in
[47:08] the wilderness.
[47:12] There was h a light
[47:15] between the cherubams, a flame of fire
[47:19] and it was over the mercy seat.
[47:22] It was there for a specific purpose
[47:25] and the people were not permitted at
[47:27] that time to go in just the high priest
[47:30] once a year and not without blood. And
[47:34] then as we were to go through through
[47:36] the all the Old Testament
[47:39] through the history of Israel
[47:42] uh at various intervals
[47:45] we find uh the special light
[47:50] then shining on the Gentiles as we read
[47:52] in Matthew and there's other places in
[47:55] the New Testament at the coming of Jesus
[47:59] uh and through the church ages. is
[48:04] intercepting Apostle Paul on the
[48:07] Damascus road was this light, a
[48:10] transforming light
[48:13] and it came for a specific purpose. It
[48:15] came to attract him and to capture him
[48:20] and which he said later he'd been
[48:21] apprehended.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That light apprehended him.
[48:26] He was the first church age messenger
[48:28] and it needed to divide
[48:31] and separate the law from grace and
[48:35] bring in grace and let the darkness of
[48:38] the law why you say the law was darkness
[48:41] because it says as pertaining to the
[48:42] mind it could never clear the conscience
[48:45] from guilt
[48:47] &gt;&gt; but but grace brought in such light
[48:51] &gt;&gt; it can deal with any and every
[48:54] situation.
[48:56] And if you're in one today, this light
[48:59] can abolish the darkness.
[49:02] And then the pillar of fire in this long
[49:04] journey,
[49:06] we find it arriving here at the end time
[49:09] in a very dramatic and unusual way
[49:13] over
[49:16] uh the prophet of God, not knowing he
[49:18] was a prophet at that time, but over the
[49:21] Ohio River and making manifest the
[49:24] purpose is to identify a messenger, to
[49:27] send him with a message, and to uh
[49:33] carry this process further to take it
[49:36] from word to bring back a restored word
[49:39] and to take it from word and to bring it
[49:42] actually into us as individuals so that
[49:46] the light can be in a people a people
[49:49] called the bride of Jesus Christ veiled
[49:52] and now that light
[49:54] if you can accept it is present with us
[49:59] &gt;&gt; veiled
[50:00] in human flesh.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; The light
[50:03] &gt;&gt; behind the veil, that light is a
[50:06] transforming light.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; That light has been placed in a like the
[50:12] sun that's out there. This light has
[50:14] been placed in a a an ordained
[50:18] spot for a specific purpose. And we
[50:22] don't want to lose sight of what that
[50:24] purpose is.
[50:27] I also want to bring in through the
[50:28] message which I touched on last Sunday.
[50:32] I want to bring in
[50:34] uh something that is is very clear in
[50:37] the message and I'm going to have to
[50:38] belabor the point a wee bit because
[50:41] brother Brandham's uh took a message in
[50:44] shalom and he said rise and shine for
[50:47] thy light has come and gross darkness
[50:50] upon the people. I want to bring those I
[50:53] alluded to it but I wish to bring it in
[50:55] a very very clear statements today that
[51:01] brother Brandham says that he repeats a
[51:03] statement which many of us have heard
[51:06] that the darkest hour is just before the
[51:08] dawn but brother Brandham gives a a
[51:12] reason why that is said it's because the
[51:15] light that is pressing the darkness and
[51:19] he says the darkness is actually
[51:21] congealing. He uses the word congealing,
[51:25] an unusual phrase. The darkness is
[51:28] actually congealing because the light is
[51:31] pressing it.
[51:33] And that's what's happening now.
[51:37] So when God places the light, he has a
[51:39] specific source
[51:42] and a specific purpose. And the light
[51:45] has a specific strength.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The light that you see will blind
[51:50] another one.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Someone comes out of absolute darkness,
[51:54] they can't. The light will just glaze
[51:57] their eyes over. The light is blinding
[52:00] to them and the next person can see it.
[52:03] One species of animal or bird is very
[52:06] comfortable. They they can move about in
[52:08] the darkness. They feed at night. They
[52:11] see they they're they're at home at
[52:13] night and and they do all right in the
[52:15] daytime. But you and I would stumble
[52:18] around and we go out in the woods and
[52:20] I've been out in the out in the woods in
[52:22] the jungles and everything else, but
[52:24] quite frankly, uh, I'm not comfortable
[52:27] at night around them. I've been in
[52:29] Africa and I've heard of the lions and
[52:31] I've heard the hyenas and heard the
[52:33] various animals and they're out there
[52:34] having a great time at night, but it's
[52:36] not my time.
[52:38] I just don't feel comfortable with it.
[52:41] Might get Brian Jones and he'll take you
[52:43] out there, but I'm still not
[52:44] comfortable. I I I try to trust him but
[52:47] not completely
[52:49] if you know what I mean.
[52:52] There's some birds and and and I
[52:55] understand from reading about them that
[52:57] the owls and various birds their eyes
[52:59] have been made in a certain way so that
[53:02] they're they see very clearly. They're
[53:04] comfortable in the evening. They're
[53:06] comfortable at night. Brother Brandham
[53:08] said that this message this message
[53:10] actually would blind the people. Can you
[53:12] imagine angels coming out of the very
[53:15] presence of God going to retrieve uh Lot
[53:19] out of Sodom and and and it didn't blind
[53:23] Lot but it blinded the others were
[53:26] smitten with blindness
[53:28] &gt;&gt; now in the in the message the rising of
[53:31] the sun I'll need your undivided
[53:34] attention and as little movement as
[53:36] possible so we don't disturb others
[53:39] in the rising of the sun there was a
[53:41] time when the world was laying lying in
[53:44] utter darkness. It was without form and
[53:47] void and was uh a and it was all covered
[53:50] with water and was laying there in the
[53:53] dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere.
[53:58] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[54:00] water and said, "Let there be light."
[54:03] Said God had a reason for that. For down
[54:07] beneath the water there was seeds. So
[54:10] now it wasn't wasn't just a light but
[54:12] now what was the purpose of that light?
[54:14] There were seeds that had been planted
[54:17] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[54:20] it live. Do you know friends, you were
[54:23] seeds that were planted in this
[54:25] generation
[54:27] and if this light of this message had
[54:29] not come, you wouldn't have any light.
[54:33] You'd still be stumbling along in some
[54:35] darkened place. You young people that
[54:37] are here, you you you can't even begin
[54:40] to compare the life you have now with
[54:42] the life you would have lived if this
[54:44] light hadn't come. So it came with a
[54:47] specific purpose and it came with a
[54:50] specific strength.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you see the prophet of God is
[54:54] speaking things say oh that's strong
[54:57] anything less wouldn't have done it.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; It had to have that strength. It had to
[55:02] shine with that. So that is why one sits
[55:04] there and says, "Ah, I can't take that."
[55:07] Blinds them. And the next one says,
[55:09] "Shine on me.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Let the light from the lighthouse shine
[55:13] on me."
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; We love this sunlight.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; It had to have the sunlight to live. And
[55:20] the first light that was ever given in
[55:23] the earth was God's spoken word. And the
[55:26] light that shines in this day is God's
[55:29] spoken word. Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Said the first light that ever struck
[55:33] the earth was God's spoken word. And he
[55:35] said, "Let there be light." And there
[55:37] was light and turned and that darkness
[55:40] and turned darkness into light in order
[55:44] to bring forth a creation,
[55:48] a creation of joy and life upon the
[55:51] earth. So the light pressed the darkness
[55:54] back in order to bring forth a creation
[55:59] of joy and life upon the earth.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Now according to the scripture, you are
[56:10] a new creation
[56:12] in Christ Jesus.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And the reason for that creation is to
[56:17] bring joy and life upon the earth. Amen.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Not just human existence.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the life in him was
[56:26] life. And that life was the light of
[56:29] man. That's the life I'm speaking about.
[56:32] That life in him. In him. Christ in him.
[56:36] The word made flesh. In him
[56:39] &gt;&gt; that that transmitted that light that
[56:42] was in him by spirit.
[56:45] by spirit, by the Holy Spirit, into this
[56:49] generation, into this congregation, into
[56:53] your home, into your environment. At
[56:57] certain a place, that light was ordained
[56:59] to shine there
[57:02] &gt;&gt; and to touch you,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; to strike that seed and cause it to come
[57:06] to life,
[57:09] &gt;&gt; to bring forth joy. He didn't come to
[57:12] bring forth distress. didn't come to
[57:15] bring forth any darkness and shadows and
[57:17] confusion. That's not why it came. It
[57:20] came to bring light.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And when you have light, then you have
[57:24] something you can walk in.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; So, there's another uh sun rising of the
[57:32] one I'm just speaking now. I want you to
[57:34] think of it as being a sunrising
[57:37] to bring forth a new creation of joy and
[57:41] life upon the earth. in the message why
[57:43] it had to be uh shepherds and and just
[57:47] so I get your mind in the in the same
[57:49] channel with me I am going
[57:51] chronologically somewhat through the
[57:53] scripture
[57:55] in the message why it had to be
[57:57] shepherds now we're at the at a a
[58:00] message a Christmas message that brother
[58:03] Brandon preached in 1964
[58:06] he said he had started a new creation
[58:09] what was it a creation of himself.
[58:14] God was made flesh and dwelt among us in
[58:17] the beginning. In the beginning of the
[58:20] creation of God, it was created. God was
[58:24] created in human form in Jesus Christ
[58:29] his son. I wish every trinitarian could
[58:32] read this paragraph and have the spirit
[58:34] of God make it clear to them. Just
[58:37] listen this profound statement. In the
[58:39] beginning of the creation of God, God
[58:42] was created in human form in Jesus
[58:46] Christ his son. God dwelt. He built his
[58:51] tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived
[58:54] in that tabernacle. God Emmanuel, God
[59:00] with us. He built himself a house to
[59:03] live in it so he could reflect his word
[59:06] to his subjects through that.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; You know what God is when you see
[59:18] Christ.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; That's a piece of literature, friends.
[59:22] That's beyond literature to me.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Just marvelous. God built himself a
[59:28] house to live in so he could reflect
[59:31] through that to you and to me the light.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Now that light did not come without an
[59:39] announcement. And the announcement
[59:43] he said the morning star announces the
[59:46] coming of the sun.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And of course I said last Sunday so you
[59:51] would know the morning star. He's the
[59:53] brighten morning star. Of course he is.
[59:55] He's a light, but it's his light shining
[59:58] through another vessel.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And here came, I will call it the Elijah
[1:00:03] light or another light called John the
[1:00:06] Baptist light.
[1:00:09] And just before the coming of the sun in
[1:00:13] the message former and latter rain,
[1:00:16] he said, "As soon as it gets real dark,"
[1:00:19] I want you to hold that. Just before the
[1:00:22] break of day, the morning star shines
[1:00:26] its brightest. What's it doing? It's
[1:00:29] reflecting the light of the coming sun.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; The reason he's saying, "Do you get it?"
[1:00:38] because it was happening at that moment.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; He was wanting them to be able to see
[1:00:44] that it was repeating again because
[1:00:46] there had to be another announcement for
[1:00:48] this coming.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; And then in watchmen
[1:00:52] uh what of the night and I have just put
[1:00:54] a heading here powerful words from God
[1:00:58] to us in this day.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what I find as powerful
[1:01:05] words. The sun is approaching.
[1:01:09] Then the darkest hour of the night is
[1:01:11] just before the dawn. And science claims
[1:01:14] it's the night. The sun the sun
[1:01:17] approaching,
[1:01:20] pressing,
[1:01:22] coming on, pressing.
[1:01:25] Here's a prophet messenger. Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Here's an Elijah light making a a making
[1:01:31] a most accurate
[1:01:34] announcement.
[1:01:36] Not only saying who's coming, but what's
[1:01:39] happening as a result of the coming. And
[1:01:42] he's saying it's coming. the sun
[1:01:44] approaching,
[1:01:46] pressing, coming on and pressing,
[1:01:50] congealing the night together
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; because it knows it's just got a little
[1:01:55] while and day will break. The darkness
[1:01:59] is congealing and the darkness knows it
[1:02:03] only has a little season and it's going
[1:02:05] to and the dawn is going to dispense
[1:02:07] with it.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Congaling it together. Doesn't the
[1:02:13] scripture say that where sin abounds,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; grace does that that much more abound?
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Why is sin abounding? If you see sin
[1:02:23] abounding, now I'm going to give you an
[1:02:26] indication where I'm going. If you see
[1:02:28] sin abounding,
[1:02:30] the abundance of sin, the increase in
[1:02:34] sin, the increase in iniquity is
[1:02:37] actually testifying that light is on its
[1:02:41] way. Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; So, we don't dwell in the gloom.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; We don't dwell in all the sin and the
[1:02:50] iniquity, but we say, "Praise God, the
[1:02:54] light's coming."
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And he's setting this principle here
[1:03:02] very vividly. That's why I say it's so
[1:03:04] powerful to me. congealing the night
[1:03:06] together because it knows it's just got
[1:03:09] a little while and day will break. And
[1:03:12] just before day break, what comes out?
[1:03:15] The morning star. As far as I'm
[1:03:18] concerned, he was standing there with
[1:03:20] the light of the morning star. But the
[1:03:24] morning star, no star has lights of its
[1:03:26] own. It only reflects something else.
[1:03:28] And the sen was drawing near coming to a
[1:03:32] dawning and it had to shine through that
[1:03:36] star messenger
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; to let us know.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Good morning.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Shalom, bride.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; It's a new day.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; And now you'll understand the shalom
[1:03:47] message even more.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; I would urge you to read it again.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And just before the day break, what
[1:03:53] comes out? The morning star. And what
[1:03:55] does the star mean? He stands alone.
[1:03:59] He's God's watchman. He stands in the
[1:04:02] tower alone.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; The rest of the stars have faded out.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; The rest of the messengers have faded
[1:04:10] out.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; The moon's gone. That's why I said and
[1:04:14] just before the daybreak or the day he
[1:04:17] said and the sun begins to shine against
[1:04:19] the morning star and it reflects the
[1:04:22] true light
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; of the true sun that's just about ready
[1:04:27] to shine.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; And therefore, Apostle Paul has said,
[1:04:36] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:04:40] is a new creature."
[1:04:43] And the word is he's a new creation.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You are not part of this old creation.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; You have not been merely patched up.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; You've not been merely forgiven. You're
[1:04:56] a new creation in Christ Jesus. That's
[1:04:59] what the word of God teaches. And
[1:05:02] anything less than that is not the
[1:05:04] scripture. You're a new creation.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is very, very
[1:05:10] clear. Not the old creation made over
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; but a new creation.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He's a new creature and old things are
[1:05:20] passed away and behold all things are
[1:05:24] become new. We are a new creation.
[1:05:29] In the paradox, he said when a man is
[1:05:31] changed from the person that he is to a
[1:05:35] new creature in Christ Jesus, he becomes
[1:05:38] a new creation.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; He's no more what he used to be. He's
[1:05:43] absolutely a new creation.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely a new creation.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I'd like to be able to have you say,
[1:05:53] "I'm a new creation."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; You believe it? Yeah,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; we should say it again. Now I'm a new
[1:06:00] creation.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; If you're having any trouble with that,
[1:06:05] Brother Brandham also has a recipe for
[1:06:07] you. Say, "How long shall I say it?" He
[1:06:10] said, "Until you believe it."
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until you believe it.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Say it to the devil. Say it to your
[1:06:17] wife. Say it to your husband. Say it to
[1:06:19] anybody you need to. I'm a new creation.
[1:06:24] Whatever comes your way that cannot
[1:06:26] change that.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation in Christ Jesus. I'm
[1:06:31] not part of the old creation. I'm part
[1:06:33] of this new creation. I'm not of this
[1:06:35] world. You're not of this world.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Now, in the Leo in church age, he said
[1:06:43] he's standing because he was standing in
[1:06:46] the midst of the churches.
[1:06:48] He said he stands there revealing who he
[1:06:51] is in the last age. That's what he's
[1:06:54] doing.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; This messenger is correct to the eenth
[1:07:00] degree. Christ is standing in the midst
[1:07:03] of his people revealing who he is in
[1:07:07] this last day. Otherwise, there could be
[1:07:10] no marriage between a bridegroom and the
[1:07:12] bride. We wouldn't know who he is. But
[1:07:15] this message has come to actually reveal
[1:07:17] who he is.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; So there's no mistake. We're not looking
[1:07:22] through a gloom or a glass darkly. We
[1:07:24] see him. We see him. If you haven't got
[1:07:27] a clear vision, say, "Oh God, trim my
[1:07:30] lamp. Clear the glass. Whatever you need
[1:07:33] to do."
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; He said he stands there revealing who he
[1:07:37] is in this last age. And he calls
[1:07:39] himself the author of the creation of
[1:07:43] God.
[1:07:44] This is another creation.
[1:07:48] This has to do with the church. This is
[1:07:51] a special designation of himself.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; He is the creator of that church. The
[1:08:00] heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:08:02] bride.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; What powerful words.
[1:08:07] uh uh I I don't know you know how you
[1:08:11] are
[1:08:12] uh uh at what capacity at what level
[1:08:14] you're able to receive it but I would
[1:08:16] encourage every person
[1:08:19] regardless of your age and regardless of
[1:08:22] your spiritual stature or maturity I I
[1:08:27] would believe every person should just
[1:08:29] be able to say I receive that I
[1:08:32] acknowledge that I accept that I receive
[1:08:36] it into my being.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that you can
[1:08:39] become a participant with it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Deny him.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; We'll go out of here being different
[1:08:51] people.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; The new creation. This creation is not
[1:08:57] an old creation made over.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Or it could not be called a new
[1:09:02] creation. This is exactly what it is. a
[1:09:05] new creation. It's another creation
[1:09:09] distinct from the old one.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And he's the first of that creation. He
[1:09:18] was God created in the form of man. Now
[1:09:22] by his spirit, he's creating many sons.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Now by his spirit, he's creating many
[1:09:30] sons. You are a new creation by the
[1:09:34] spirit of God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; We ought to deny anything that feels
[1:09:40] less than that. Don't trust our
[1:09:42] feelings. Don't trust your reasoning.
[1:09:44] Don't trust anything. Cast it all aside
[1:09:46] and just say, "I'm here just to hear the
[1:09:49] word of God. I'm here what's coming
[1:09:51] across this pullpit."
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:56] Yes, sir.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends, this isn't
[1:10:00] something I dreamed up.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; It's something that has come real in my
[1:10:04] heart.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And I believe that this is God's word to
[1:10:08] us this morning. I received it as God's
[1:10:11] word. And I could not deliver it to you
[1:10:12] if I didn't receive it as God's word.
[1:10:21] God the creator creating himself a part
[1:10:24] of his creation.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I wanted to have these things up on the
[1:10:30] slide for you, but I didn't have
[1:10:32] sufficient time.
[1:10:37] Listen close.
[1:10:39] I'm repeating it. He is the first of
[1:10:42] that creation. That's him.
[1:10:45] He was God created in the form of a man.
[1:10:48] That's Christ.
[1:10:50] Now by his spirit he is creating many
[1:10:53] sons unto himself.
[1:10:56] God the creator creating himself a part
[1:10:59] of his own creation.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Now I move forward
[1:11:06] to the light of the resurrection.
[1:11:09] I want to just index it slightly to take
[1:11:13] it to the pressing of the darkness
[1:11:17] and and and spend just a moment or two
[1:11:19] on that. He said, "And when the life
[1:11:23] that's in Jesus Christ
[1:11:26] comes to the tomb
[1:11:29] where your loved ones are sleeping,
[1:11:33] when the life that's in Jesus Christ
[1:11:37] comes to the tomb where your loved ones
[1:11:40] are sleeping." I want to ask, how many
[1:11:43] here
[1:11:45] have some loved ones that are sleeping?
[1:11:47] Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; What a host.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; What a host.
[1:11:57] I'm moved
[1:12:00] because here's a light, an announcing
[1:12:03] light,
[1:12:05] announcing to you
[1:12:07] that the life of Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] is going to come to the tomb or the
[1:12:13] grave where your loved ones are
[1:12:15] sleeping. Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; And there'll be another congaling.
[1:12:20] They'll bring together the atoms.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Transform the atoms.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; A sweep
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; will come over the living ones.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; And he'll congeal and take away the
[1:12:33] darkness.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Every trace of this world. Everything of
[1:12:37] this mortal life will be gone.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; This mortal life, who wants it? I can do
[1:12:44] without it. Give me eternal life.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Let immortality swallow up this
[1:12:51] mortality.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to your sleeping,
[1:12:57] loved ones are sleeping, there will be a
[1:13:00] resurrection. Listen very closely. Life
[1:13:03] and death can't dwell together. In other
[1:13:06] words, light and darkness can't dwell
[1:13:08] together. He's just come from the life
[1:13:11] of Christ coming to the sleeping loved
[1:13:14] ones.
[1:13:17] Life and darkness cannot live to life
[1:13:19] and death cannot live together no more
[1:13:20] than darkness and daylight can. Just as
[1:13:24] soon as the daylight comes,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; just as soon as the daylight comes, it
[1:13:29] presses the darkness away.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Daylight has to shine. No matter what
[1:13:36] takes place and when the world moves
[1:13:38] around there in front of that sun, it's
[1:13:41] got to come daylight. It has to. And
[1:13:44] just as sure as eternity
[1:13:48] as it pulls around to the time of the
[1:13:50] coming of the son of God,
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; there will be a resurrection over this
[1:13:55] world.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; And all that sleep in God, Christ will
[1:13:59] bring with him. In his resurrection,
[1:14:02] it'll have to be. There's no way out of
[1:14:04] it. You've got to have it. And how can
[1:14:06] you have it unless it's in here?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just refer to gross darkness
[1:14:16] for a few moments.
[1:14:19] Dense, congealing
[1:14:22] is that it becomes more dense, more
[1:14:24] solidified.
[1:14:28] And what we see today
[1:14:31] when I look at the world of
[1:14:34] religion
[1:14:38] and I see the announcements or the
[1:14:40] religious page, not to be critical,
[1:14:44] but all I see is darkness,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; I see entertainment and it spells
[1:14:50] darkness to me.
[1:14:54] see all of these gim gimmicks
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; and money pulling
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; and it all spells darkness to me.
[1:15:02] I see all this what is the world gets so
[1:15:05] excited about all this unifying and this
[1:15:08] ecu ecumenical movements and the coming
[1:15:11] together and multitudes and multitudes
[1:15:14] untold millions just rejoicing and there
[1:15:18] they think that this is the
[1:15:19] personification of of God's will that
[1:15:22] they might be one that's not what God
[1:15:25] said Jesus said that they might be one
[1:15:27] as I am one with the father
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; that's the oneness
[1:15:34] When I see it, it's darkness.
[1:15:37] I don't think it's difficult for us.
[1:15:40] It's not us here in America,
[1:15:45] but it's around the world. The world has
[1:15:48] come into a very, very
[1:15:50] dark time
[1:15:53] financially.
[1:15:55] They call this a global crisis.
[1:16:00] A lot of people are very very depressed
[1:16:04] and I hear that it's going to take a lot
[1:16:06] longer than most people anticipate.
[1:16:10] I've even read where they said it'll be
[1:16:12] it'll be some time even before the
[1:16:14] effects of it has reached you and I.
[1:16:19] And the wise and their counselors and
[1:16:23] the kings and the monarchs and the
[1:16:25] presidents and all with their advisors
[1:16:28] have not got a clear direction.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Well, perhaps try this or try that. What
[1:16:34] it is, friends, it's darkness. And when
[1:16:37] you start thinking about the economics,
[1:16:39] that comes right down to your home and
[1:16:41] the gas and the fuel and your automobile
[1:16:44] and the food on your table and the rent
[1:16:46] that you need to pay or the mortgage
[1:16:48] payment you need to pay. It's a reality.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; But there's a light
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; that is stronger than that darkness.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; When I look at the education,
[1:17:01] I shake my head. I tremble within my
[1:17:04] being. I am sometimes ashamed to say I'm
[1:17:08] a Canadian or an American with this
[1:17:11] godlessness. When I see the samesex
[1:17:14] marriage
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; happening within miles of this church,
[1:17:20] I'm disgraced.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Not as a citizen of this nation, but
[1:17:25] even of the human race.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see the nakedness and I see
[1:17:30] the complete without shame, the open dis
[1:17:35] desegration and disregard for anything
[1:17:39] that's right, holy, and it has come to
[1:17:41] where the clean is considered unclean,
[1:17:44] where the clean is worthy of mockery,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; a smirk on the face,
[1:17:51] because a person walks by with the glory
[1:17:54] of God and with some modesty, then in
[1:17:57] the world is in a very very dark place.
[1:18:00] I say gross darkness.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You young people, you're growing up in a
[1:18:06] in a state of gross darkness.
[1:18:09] But I have an announcement I have not
[1:18:11] made quite like this before. This gross
[1:18:14] darkness. And you all see it. You all
[1:18:17] are touched by it. You all uh uh you
[1:18:21] have it surrounding us every day. This
[1:18:23] gross darkness testifies of something.
[1:18:26] This gross darkness is speaking
[1:18:28] something. It is evidence that the sun
[1:18:32] has caused it to congeal.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; The sun, the sun has caused it to to
[1:18:39] become so intense. It's because it's
[1:18:42] being pushed back.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Pushed back.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a person here that
[1:18:48] would be foolish enough to stand up and
[1:18:50] say there's not gross darkness on the
[1:18:53] people. This world is in a dismal place.
[1:18:56] I look to see they say uh at the last
[1:18:59] count there are 27 wars being fought as
[1:19:03] you and I sit here
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; on the earth. 27 wars. These are not
[1:19:09] conflicts. These are wars.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; You can only thank God that you're not
[1:19:14] in the eastern Congo and being one of
[1:19:17] maybe one and a quarter million people
[1:19:19] fleeing with a few few possessions on
[1:19:22] their back. I mentioned last Sunday.
[1:19:24] It's going on today.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; And whether it happens or not, the rebel
[1:19:29] leader says that he intends to move to
[1:19:32] Kinshasa.
[1:19:34] And there's believers all over that
[1:19:36] count country.
[1:19:38] I'm so thankful to God. God spared them.
[1:19:41] Last time they actually fasted and
[1:19:43] prayed and there wasn't a bullet shot in
[1:19:46] the city of Kinshasa. God spared them.
[1:19:49] However, one of the pastors lost his
[1:19:51] wife because he was of one tribe. She
[1:19:53] was of another and the invading tribe
[1:19:57] was of his same tribe and they killed
[1:19:58] his wife. A believer of this message, a
[1:20:01] minister of this message in the same
[1:20:03] area where all the trouble is happening
[1:20:05] now.
[1:20:09] There's conflicts. There's violence. It
[1:20:12] it is as it was in the days of Noah.
[1:20:14] Only in the days of Noah,
[1:20:18] we have it today in a multiplied form
[1:20:21] because we have such a a increase in
[1:20:25] population
[1:20:27] and our populations have gathered into
[1:20:29] cities,
[1:20:31] great urban centers where sin
[1:20:36] is everywhere. Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; talk to some of our peace officers, our
[1:20:41] policemen, and they're encountering it
[1:20:44] every day. Every day, every day. I'm
[1:20:46] amazed that they wouldn't just become
[1:20:48] callous and hardened to it. Stabbings
[1:20:50] and shootings and every day. So, you
[1:20:52] major on that. No, we're not majoring on
[1:20:54] that, but we're looking at it today
[1:20:56] because it's evidence that the sun has
[1:20:59] arrived.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And it has to be that way. In fact, as
[1:21:04] I'm going to read a quote to you where
[1:21:06] he says that that this adulterous
[1:21:08] generation that looks for a sign that is
[1:21:11] evidence of the resurrection.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking at some revival and
[1:21:16] saying, "Oh, the revival's the evidence
[1:21:18] of the resurrection." The prophet of God
[1:21:20] more than once was looking at the
[1:21:22] terrible gross darkness of the world.
[1:21:26] And when he saw that adulterous
[1:21:28] generation, he said, "That's a sign of
[1:21:30] the resurrection.
[1:21:41] gross darkness
[1:21:47] in God's provided way of dealing with
[1:21:50] sin. Said always before the daylight
[1:21:53] it's the darkest.
[1:21:55] It's always darkest just before the
[1:21:57] break of day. I know I'm repeating
[1:21:58] myself. I'm I'm repeating him.
[1:22:02] And I'm saying it because he says it in
[1:22:04] different ways. He said it's because
[1:22:08] the light is pressing
[1:22:11] and condensing the darkness. See
[1:22:13] friends, the world has nowhere to turn.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; It's condensing the darkness. And that
[1:22:24] is at the time that the morning star
[1:22:27] comes out
[1:22:29] in the beginning and ending of the
[1:22:31] gentile dispensation. Notice the notice
[1:22:34] the title of the message that he was he
[1:22:37] was instructed and guided to call it the
[1:22:40] beginning and ending
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; of the gentile dispensation.
[1:22:46] We see the darkness gathering. Now
[1:22:52] what what is it? It's light pressing
[1:22:55] against the darkness.
[1:22:58] So now back at this time as an early
[1:23:01] message 55
[1:23:03] a prophet is seeing and and in that in
[1:23:06] in that time I might tell you the world
[1:23:08] was experienced great revival
[1:23:11] that David Edwin Harold writes about
[1:23:13] from about 48 to 58. Here he is in the
[1:23:16] middle of it. But he sees the prophet
[1:23:18] sees darkness coming
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; and he tells Oh my. I hope you have ears
[1:23:24] to hear today.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I just want to know
[1:23:28] you do.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet sees darkness back then. He
[1:23:34] said we see the darkness gathering now.
[1:23:37] Notice how it's worded. It's gathering
[1:23:39] now. Doesn't just see darkness, but he
[1:23:41] sees darkness gathering now.
[1:23:45] And then the explanation interpretation.
[1:23:47] What is it? It's light.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; He knew what he was there for.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Pressing against the darkness.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; And one has to give way.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's the era he was in. That's the
[1:24:03] chronological order.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; In the midst of great revival, healing
[1:24:07] revivals. Or Roberts was going on. Billy
[1:24:10] Graham was going on. Aa Robert, aa Allen
[1:24:13] was going on. Oel Jaggers, WV Grant, all
[1:24:16] of these ministries were going on. Uh
[1:24:19] Osburn and and and uh uh a whole myriad
[1:24:23] of great ministers in the field reaping
[1:24:26] an enormous harvest.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of it, the prophet
[1:24:30] says, "Darkness is gathering."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And this is why it's gathering because
[1:24:35] it's got to press. The light is pressing
[1:24:38] the darkness. And one of them has to
[1:24:40] give way. And he knew that God's light
[1:24:43] would not fail.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; God's light is never going to give way
[1:24:47] to darkness.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And apply that to your own life.
[1:24:51] Whatever you enter, whatever you
[1:24:53] encounter, God's light is not going to
[1:24:56] give way to that darkness.
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I feel this weakness. I feel this
[1:25:01] bondage. I feel this. I don't care what
[1:25:03] you feel. God's light of the new
[1:25:06] creation will never give way to that
[1:25:11] darkness.
[1:25:13] You need to speak against that darkness.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I come against you darkness in the name
[1:25:18] of Jesus Christ, the light of the world,
[1:25:21] the light of my life.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't psy it.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Don't play light with it.
[1:25:35] He says, "We see the darkness gathering
[1:25:37] now. It's the light pressing against the
[1:25:40] darkness.
[1:25:42] One has to give away." He says, "All the
[1:25:43] creeping things that's been running
[1:25:45] through the night when that sun comes to
[1:25:49] they run to take shelter
[1:25:52] when the light shines." Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And then in I know my redeemer liveth.
[1:25:58] And this great darkness
[1:26:01] that's swinging over the earth now, it's
[1:26:04] about three years later.
[1:26:07] This great darkness that's swinging over
[1:26:09] the earth now
[1:26:12] is nothing but to declare that the light
[1:26:16] is pressing its way down.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Do you catch the different language,
[1:26:20] friends?
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Do you catch how precise this is?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; I hope you're spiritually minded. I
[1:26:26] said, "We're going to go through it
[1:26:28] chronologically."
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "It is the light is the
[1:26:33] darkness is coming now." Three years
[1:26:37] later, he said it's swinging over the
[1:26:39] earth.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And he tells us precisely what is
[1:26:44] happening at the time.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And it's nothing but to declare. And so
[1:26:53] the darkness that was swinging over the
[1:26:55] earth and the prophet could see it, the
[1:26:57] darkness swinging over the earth. And he
[1:27:01] looked at the darkness and he said,
[1:27:03] "This is declaring. This is making a
[1:27:06] declaration.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; The light is coming.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Just hold it fast, friends.
[1:27:16] where we move on a little bit further
[1:27:23] and then if you read shalom again you'll
[1:27:25] see it different
[1:27:28] said the hour is upon us 1964
[1:27:32] now it's not coming but he said the hour
[1:27:34] is upon us
[1:27:37] darkness and gross darkness repeats it
[1:27:40] gross darkness on the people Now
[1:27:48] you know we here in this life,
[1:27:51] we here in this country and those of you
[1:27:54] from Europe,
[1:27:57] we have a pretty good life.
[1:28:01] We got lots of food,
[1:28:04] nice cars,
[1:28:07] comfortable place to sit and have
[1:28:09] church.
[1:28:11] freedom
[1:28:13] sir.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; But don't let the devil fool you with an
[1:28:16] artificial light.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that we in North America
[1:28:24] are living by an artificial light.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Some of its knowledge and intellect.
[1:28:32] We have great people and we have leaders
[1:28:34] and God bless our leaders and help them.
[1:28:38] But whatever makes your life rather
[1:28:41] easy, comfortable, don't forget that's
[1:28:46] an artificial light
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and it's going to pass away because
[1:28:52] it's gross darkness.
[1:28:54] And if you take a real good hard look,
[1:28:59] I'll say to you young people, it may be
[1:29:00] in education, you may be in college,
[1:29:05] you may be in school, in halls of
[1:29:07] learning,
[1:29:10] take a real good hard look at what it is
[1:29:13] you're studying
[1:29:15] and see if it is clean,
[1:29:18] holy, and something that Jesus could
[1:29:21] read
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; and be blessed by
[1:29:26] And if you look at it very critically
[1:29:30] say,
[1:29:32] you know, there's a facade here. There's
[1:29:35] a facade, but deep down below it,
[1:29:38] there's innuendos
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; and there's statements and there's
[1:29:43] little cunning things that are
[1:29:45] encouraging
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; sin,
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; encouraging me to do wrong or telling me
[1:29:53] that wrong is okay.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Have a look at the world of business or
[1:30:01] the world of economics.
[1:30:03] You don't have to look at it very long
[1:30:05] before you when you get down
[1:30:09] say you know what this is corrupt
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; the it's fundamentally flawed
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; politics
[1:30:18] right
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; I just listened I listened live to the
[1:30:24] man who is president-elect
[1:30:28] uh Obama's advisor
[1:30:33] He was his
[1:30:36] closest adviser in this election. I
[1:30:38] understand he was his head advisor.
[1:30:41] And they said, "Well, now he's now he's
[1:30:43] sweeping." This was just before he'd be
[1:30:46] become elected and he's sweeping to this
[1:30:49] great victory. What are you going to do
[1:30:51] now? Because it's obvious he won't be
[1:30:53] able to keep all the promises that have
[1:30:55] just been made.
[1:30:57] That advisor said that's our that's
[1:30:59] that's our first task in this period
[1:31:03] starting right immediately if he wins
[1:31:06] the election starting immediately. He
[1:31:08] said we have set a course to soften the
[1:31:11] people because we can't and these are
[1:31:14] his words we cannot keep the promises we
[1:31:16] made.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:20] I was at brother Ron Spencer's getting
[1:31:22] ready to come up and preach and brother
[1:31:25] Ron got up and said, "Just think," he
[1:31:27] said. They're lined up for hours waiting
[1:31:31] to get into a building to hear a man
[1:31:33] tell a bunch of lies.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look at any area of
[1:31:42] life very long before you'll find. And
[1:31:46] so the prophet also spoke several times
[1:31:48] about a false light. There are false
[1:31:51] lights. There is a glare. There's a
[1:31:54] reflected light. And there's a true
[1:31:56] reflected light through a prophet is a
[1:31:58] reflector. You're a reflector. But he
[1:32:01] spoke several times and spoke of the
[1:32:03] greatest train the greatest robbery that
[1:32:06] was ever taken which happened in in
[1:32:09] England. And it was a millions of
[1:32:12] dollars. I think maybe $7 million. the
[1:32:14] great train robbery and it was caused
[1:32:17] because of a false light.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; They put up a light and the train
[1:32:22] stopped
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; as I understand it and there was the
[1:32:26] greatest robbery. But there's a greater
[1:32:28] robbery.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; And I hope you're not losing some of
[1:32:33] your spiritual assets.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; The devil is going about like a roaring
[1:32:38] lion. And he doesn't necessarily go
[1:32:40] about roaring boo in your ear. He's
[1:32:42] saying it's okay. Right.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; It's fine. He's got a soft, cunning
[1:32:47] voice.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; You're all right. Don't get too excited
[1:32:50] about this. You don't have to get too
[1:32:52] fervent. You know, the preacher gets it,
[1:32:53] but you don't have to get it. He's a
[1:32:55] liar.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; He's a liar.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; This word, this message, this light
[1:33:01] needs to mean more to you than your job,
[1:33:03] than your education, than your business,
[1:33:05] than your money, or anything else. He's
[1:33:08] a liar.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; You need to tell him he's a liar. I
[1:33:11] don't care how kind how he comes to you,
[1:33:14] how soft, how cunning,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; how nice it sounds, it's an artificial
[1:33:18] light.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; It's artificial. And that light's going
[1:33:21] to go out.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And outside of that light is nothing but
[1:33:25] gross darkness.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people.
[1:33:31] Never been such a dark time. We've lived
[1:33:34] now since 64, 44 years. Here we are at
[1:33:39] this time.
[1:33:42] You know, I don't know. Sometimes things
[1:33:44] come up that may mean something and
[1:33:47] other times they may not mean a whole
[1:33:49] lot. I'm just going to jump ahead in in
[1:33:52] my message for a moment because
[1:33:56] I looked and this was really the heart
[1:33:59] of my message this morning. What we are
[1:34:02] seeing or at least what I am seeing is a
[1:34:06] intense
[1:34:08] congaling
[1:34:10] of darkness.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And if I didn't have this fundamental
[1:34:16] principle that the prophet of God left
[1:34:18] us
[1:34:20] telling us that that is a sign.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; It's a dismal sign to maybe even people
[1:34:27] in the message if they don't see the
[1:34:29] other side of it. this intense gross
[1:34:32] darkness that can almost be felt like it
[1:34:34] was in Egypt. There's no light. There's
[1:34:37] no way out politically, economically,
[1:34:40] religiously, any other way. It's all
[1:34:43] headed to an abysmal dismal pit.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:48] And that's not pessimism because on the
[1:34:50] other side I look at that and you can
[1:34:53] look at that through the eyes of the
[1:34:55] messenger and say aha but I this has
[1:34:58] happened because light is right behind
[1:35:00] it.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said furthermore when
[1:35:03] you see this gross adulterous generation
[1:35:07] seeking signs. He said that speaks of
[1:35:09] one thing. He said that is a sign of the
[1:35:13] resurrection.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. You see great dark gross
[1:35:19] darkness and I know you do. We can say
[1:35:21] praise be to God. We have another
[1:35:24] promise.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; The promise
[1:35:28] of the resurrection,
[1:35:34] the congaling of darkness.
[1:35:39] I mentioned 27 wars at the present time.
[1:35:43] And this is from
[1:35:46] the abortion
[1:35:49] the center
[1:35:52] uh
[1:35:54] institute
[1:35:56] and planned parenthood's family planning
[1:35:59] perspectives
[1:36:01] and this is their abortion statistics
[1:36:06] worldwide
[1:36:08] number of abortions per year is
[1:36:11] approximately
[1:36:13] 40 42 million
[1:36:20] numbers of abortions per day
[1:36:23] 115,000.
[1:36:28] In the United States, the number of
[1:36:30] abortions per year was 1.37 million in
[1:36:34] 1996.
[1:36:36] Those are statistics. That's not
[1:36:38] estimate.
[1:36:40] That's what took place.
[1:36:43] That would be 1.37 million is half the
[1:36:47] population
[1:36:49] of this entire greater Vancouver area
[1:36:53] was wiped out in abortions.
[1:36:59] I was just looking because I was curious
[1:37:02] to see what he said on this situation
[1:37:06] and brother Brandham referred to
[1:37:09] Chicago.
[1:37:10] I think every time he spoke about
[1:37:13] abortions,
[1:37:15] I looked to see if he ever connected it
[1:37:17] with Los Angeles. No, he connected the
[1:37:20] homosexual and the perversion with Los
[1:37:23] Angeles in the West
[1:37:26] and Vancouver happens to be an abundance
[1:37:28] of it here.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; But he spoke of it as being
[1:37:36] he connected it with Chicago. I just
[1:37:38] wonder if that prophet
[1:37:41] was connecting
[1:37:43] some spirit that would arise.
[1:37:48] Don't take me wrong, no reflection on
[1:37:50] the person, but America has a president
[1:37:54] coming into power who's very very
[1:37:57] pro-abortion
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; and also comes from Chicago.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; And I think it's more than a
[1:38:05] coincidence.
[1:38:08] I think there's gross. It's a sign of
[1:38:10] gross darkness.
[1:38:13] I think we're headed. Do you I want to
[1:38:16] ask this congregation
[1:38:18] on any one of these points. Anything
[1:38:21] that you can think of?
[1:38:23] Anything that perhaps has troubled you?
[1:38:26] I just want to ask you, do you see even
[1:38:29] the remotest
[1:38:31] indication that it will reverse?
[1:38:37] And that's sad.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Is it going to improve?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Are we going to have less divorces?
[1:38:47] Are we going to have less violence, less
[1:38:50] wars?
[1:38:56] I say to you,
[1:38:58] arise and shine because your light has
[1:39:01] come.
[1:39:04] And that darkness that you see and you
[1:39:07] touch and you're grieved with day after
[1:39:09] day after day is evidence,
[1:39:14] it's a sign from God's prophet to you
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; that the light is pushing it
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and it can't do anything but congeal and
[1:39:22] become more intense and more fierce and
[1:39:25] more dark because the resurrection is
[1:39:28] coming right behind it.
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:34] Hallelujah.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; I say by the evidence of the darkness,
[1:39:38] resurrection is on its way.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Rapture is on its way.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; That is why death
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; has become so prevalent
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; in every form
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; because the enemy is bringing it. That
[1:39:54] is what he's bringing. But it's it's
[1:39:56] that way and it's intensifying
[1:39:59] congaling because the light of the
[1:40:02] rapture, the change of these bodies
[1:40:04] because the scripture also tells us he
[1:40:07] goes about as a roaring line because he
[1:40:09] knows his time is short.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; He knows what time it is.
[1:40:20] Do you remember
[1:40:24] when Jesus cast a thousand
[1:40:27] demons out of the maniac and they went
[1:40:30] into the we're going to go into the
[1:40:32] swine and they screamed out and they
[1:40:34] said, "Have you come to torment us
[1:40:36] before the time?"
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; They knew it was coming, but they knew
[1:40:43] that wasn't the time.
[1:40:45] Have you come to torment us before the
[1:40:48] time?
[1:40:49] But they know well it's a time and it's
[1:40:52] like there's a fever in the kingdom of
[1:40:55] darkness. They're gripped with a fever.
[1:40:58] They're panicstricken. We haven't much
[1:41:01] time to accomplish our devious and evil
[1:41:04] ends. Let us get into government. Let us
[1:41:07] get behind the pulpit. Let us get into
[1:41:09] the churches. Let us get into worship.
[1:41:12] Let us get into the most the most
[1:41:14] deceiving place because we must if we
[1:41:16] can deceive the very elect.
[1:41:19] And the very elect happen to have a
[1:41:21] promise from God saying that's not
[1:41:23] possible.
[1:41:28] That can't happen.
[1:41:31] Might take the neighbor down the street
[1:41:32] but can't take the elect of God.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not just that you have
[1:41:38] light. It is that you are light.
[1:41:42] [Applause]
[1:41:47] Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. the announcement
[1:41:57] and we see we can see all through the
[1:41:59] all through the scriptures and I won't
[1:42:01] take the time
[1:42:03] but even when we come into the I was
[1:42:07] thinking of the Exodus and the Old
[1:42:08] Testament
[1:42:10] and God gave Moses a promise and said
[1:42:14] and the Lord went before them in a by
[1:42:16] day in a pillar of fire.
[1:42:19] What a comfort that must have been
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; to walk and have that pillar of fire
[1:42:24] before them.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; What a comfort it must have been and a
[1:42:30] confidence for that prophet of God
[1:42:34] to see that pillar of fire leading them.
[1:42:38] And he said, "A pillar of fire by
[1:42:42] by night in a pillar of fire and to give
[1:42:44] them light to go by day and night."
[1:42:51] I believe is in birth pains that brother
[1:42:54] Brandham speaks of
[1:42:58] the birth of Jesus Christ and how the
[1:43:02] world had come into a very very dark
[1:43:04] time.
[1:43:06] I'd say the nations, like the songwriter
[1:43:09] said, have lost their way.
[1:43:12] And God chose
[1:43:15] his prophets and his messengers
[1:43:18] to lead them out of that time. But then
[1:43:20] he sent, and I've referred to John the
[1:43:23] Baptist, but now I want to give some
[1:43:25] backup in some scriptures.
[1:43:28] Zachcharias,
[1:43:30] John the Baptist's father
[1:43:32] at John's birth. It was actually at his
[1:43:34] circumcision.
[1:43:37] And he speaks of him and he says to give
[1:43:39] light to them that sit in darkness and
[1:43:42] in the shadow of death to guide our feet
[1:43:44] into the way of peace. That's what they
[1:43:46] would say about the spirit of Elijah at
[1:43:48] that time. To give us light, to to to
[1:43:52] make something visible, to make it
[1:43:54] clear.
[1:43:56] And then I want you to notice please so
[1:44:00] we can uh project all these things to
[1:44:03] this moment and your address.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Zachcharias the father, he's not saying
[1:44:10] that he has it, but he's saying to give
[1:44:12] us light. You've sent this one to give
[1:44:15] us light and to show us the way and to
[1:44:19] give us direction.
[1:44:20] God's in the same business he was when
[1:44:23] he said to the son, "Let there be
[1:44:24] light." And he created lights in the
[1:44:26] heavens and he had them in their place.
[1:44:28] The moon's where it's supposed to be.
[1:44:29] The sun's where it's supposed to be. The
[1:44:31] stars are where it's supposed to be. Do
[1:44:33] you believe that?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And the light that was coming now, as
[1:44:37] Zacharias was speaking about, that light
[1:44:39] was exactly where it was supposed to be.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; It was with that infant child. That
[1:44:46] light was with that infant child. And it
[1:44:48] and God God gave it from the right
[1:44:51] source
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; with the right strength with the right
[1:44:55] intensity. It was going to reach
[1:44:57] everyone it was ordained to reach.
[1:45:09] He said, "You rejoiced in John. You
[1:45:11] rejoiced in in in his light for he was a
[1:45:14] great and shining light
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; and you rejoiced in it for a season." He
[1:45:20] said to the people then
[1:45:24] John, when he saw Jesus coming,
[1:45:27] this is just before Jesus was going to
[1:45:28] enter his ministry said, "Behold the
[1:45:31] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[1:45:34] the world." Made announcement. There
[1:45:37] never been an announcement like that. He
[1:45:38] hadn't even read that in the Old
[1:45:39] Testament.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; And it was just at that time because
[1:45:47] Jesus came and sought baptism of John
[1:45:50] and they went down into the water
[1:45:52] together. And John baptized him. And
[1:45:55] when he came up out of the water, a
[1:45:58] light came, a heavenly light, a dove
[1:46:00] light.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; That same light was over the Ohio River.
[1:46:04] What's the difference between Jordan,
[1:46:06] Ohio, or any other river? It was that
[1:46:08] same dove, that same heavenly light
[1:46:11] coming from a certain supernatural
[1:46:13] source
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; with the right intensity
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; to the right people
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; to the right man
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; and to the others who would be
[1:46:25] associated and see it and believe it.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach. Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; That light never misses a never misses a
[1:46:39] beat.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; When it came in this generation, it came
[1:46:43] to the right person.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; It came with the right strength,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; the right intensity, and the correct
[1:46:49] direction to catch the seed that's in
[1:46:52] you.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; It had to catch that seed that was in
[1:46:55] you.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; It was strong enough to reach even to
[1:46:59] you.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Are you here? Yeah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Did you come under that light?
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; You have much to rejoice in.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, thus sayith the Lord,
[1:47:11] outside of that light is only gross
[1:47:14] darkness.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't learn behold the lamb of God
[1:47:29] in a Bible school or theology. Right.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And when he came up out of the water,
[1:47:35] God was testifying. And I'm so thankful
[1:47:37] for the words. Are you getting weary?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; So thankful for the words that the
[1:47:42] prophet of God gave in the future home.
[1:47:45] When Jesus came up out of the water and
[1:47:48] the heavenly light appeared and a voice
[1:47:51] from heaven saying, "This is my son in
[1:47:52] whom I'm well pleased." The prophet puts
[1:47:55] it in in these words. God was saying,
[1:47:58] "This is my part of the earth."
[1:48:02] that I have redeemed.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Because God had created himself a
[1:48:07] physical body of which Mary in whose
[1:48:10] womb he was while she ate food and
[1:48:13] nurtured was nurtured of the earth. His
[1:48:15] body grew from the things that she
[1:48:17] craved and desired wheat or cabbage or
[1:48:20] bread or potatoes or whatever it was.
[1:48:22] And he had a body of the earth. He aged.
[1:48:26] Remember
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; he aged. When he was 30, he looked 50.
[1:48:30] He aged.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Small man, shoulder stooping,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; drooping, wearied with the burdens of
[1:48:40] life
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; and the cares of the people. He was so
[1:48:44] burdened,
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; that beautiful lamb of God.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And God was speaking, "This is my part
[1:48:52] of the earth. I'm so glad for the last
[1:48:54] part of the phrase." Brother Brandham
[1:48:56] didn't leave it there. And through this
[1:48:58] part,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; I will redeem all the rest of it.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; And through that part, that's why you're
[1:49:10] sitting here.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; That's how come you came.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; That light shone even to you.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I think about some of you young people.
[1:49:20] if you hadn't had the touch, if that
[1:49:22] light hasn't struck your soul. When
[1:49:24] brother Brisco's preaching this morning,
[1:49:25] say, "Oh God, I have not I've not really
[1:49:28] experienced what he's preaching about.
[1:49:29] But I give myself to you. Open it up to
[1:49:32] me. Make it a reality. Surely my time's
[1:49:34] come."
[1:49:36] [Applause]
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You can have it at 8 years old. You can
[1:49:39] have it at nine. You can have it at 10.
[1:49:42] You can have it at 80. You can have it.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching a reality. I'm preaching a
[1:49:47] supernatural thing.
[1:49:49] I'm looking for this event to happen
[1:49:51] even here now.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Just a word to you that feel all full,
[1:50:09] satisfied, and secure and you're so far
[1:50:11] in the kingdom of God that you don't
[1:50:14] have any worries.
[1:50:16] I want to tell you if you're in that
[1:50:17] state, you haven't got the mind of your
[1:50:19] father.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; The mind of the heavenly father was not
[1:50:25] one that said, "Well, everything's fine.
[1:50:28] I got my fields and I'm okay. I I'm just
[1:50:32] fine. I just want more increase and more
[1:50:36] more productivity. I just want more. I
[1:50:38] got my eldest son." No. No. He had all
[1:50:40] of those things, but he was worried over
[1:50:42] one.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That was a son who wasn't there.
[1:50:46] And if you have the spirit of God in
[1:50:48] you, that's exactly where your concern
[1:50:49] is.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; And when I'm preaching, I'm reaching out
[1:50:53] to that one.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, and the sisters probably
[1:51:02] live streaming at this moment,
[1:51:05] but I was touched.
[1:51:08] a long ways from here.
[1:51:12] A sister who's experienced a good deal
[1:51:14] of difficulty
[1:51:17] was she thought
[1:51:20] I'll just stream Cloverdale
[1:51:23] and see what's happening, see what's
[1:51:25] being spoken there.
[1:51:32] Turned on the streaming.
[1:51:35] I was preaching I think three weeks ago
[1:51:37] now.
[1:51:39] bind up the wounded.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; That was her to the letter.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And she bought a plane ticket
[1:51:51] and flew a 7,000mi round trip to be here
[1:51:56] in last Sunday's service.
[1:52:00] And weeping in the office said, "I don't
[1:52:03] want to go home."
[1:52:06] Why, friends? You're sitting here, let
[1:52:08] me tell you, this is a healing
[1:52:09] atmosphere.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; And you have a commission from Almighty
[1:52:14] God to keep it that way.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; You have a mandate. It's not just my
[1:52:18] job. It's your job. It's your job. It's
[1:52:21] the trustees job. It's the deacon's job.
[1:52:23] It's our job to keep that atmosphere
[1:52:25] because that's where our father is
[1:52:27] concerned. His concern is for that one
[1:52:29] that's out there that's on the mountain
[1:52:31] side or may be wounded, but it's his
[1:52:33] elect. Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; If it's his elect, he must bring them
[1:52:37] in.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; That's why I rejoice when I hear that
[1:52:41] these brothers uploaded 348
[1:52:44] Dutch messages. I don't just see it as a
[1:52:47] bunch of mechanics on a message hub. I
[1:52:49] see a hungering stall out there.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It's going to find that God's going to
[1:52:55] lead them right to it and they're going
[1:52:57] to hear exactly what they need to hear.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:18] in the former latter rain. I hope you
[1:53:20] don't mind me taking quite a few quotes
[1:53:22] because it is in a continuity.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't miss this." Now I'm
[1:53:30] reiterating
[1:53:32] some things I said earlier, but I want
[1:53:34] to do it from quote. Don't miss this
[1:53:36] now. The morning star comes out between
[1:53:40] that little light spell and the real
[1:53:43] breaking of the day as soon as it gets
[1:53:45] real dark. Just before the break of day,
[1:53:48] the morning star shines its brightest.
[1:53:53] What's it doing?
[1:53:55] It's reflecting the light of the coming
[1:53:59] son.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; I believe that we could sing, he's here.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he's here because I can
[1:54:12] feel his presence. He's here because I
[1:54:15] have seen the glory of God." I can say
[1:54:18] today uh uh in in in in alignment with
[1:54:21] the message today, I know that he's here
[1:54:24] because I see wickedness. I know he's
[1:54:26] here because I see an evil and an
[1:54:28] adulterous generation. I say he's here.
[1:54:31] I know he's here because the world is
[1:54:33] beyond repair.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; I say he's here because there isn't a
[1:54:37] there isn't enough Abraham Lincoln or
[1:54:39] George Washington's to save the nation.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:54:46] We haven't got a prime minister could
[1:54:48] possibly arise and and and save this
[1:54:50] generation. And they go there with good
[1:54:52] intent. Nothing against the men.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; They may have the best of intentions.
[1:54:58] The world is Satan's Eden.
[1:55:03] That's right.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And just as Satan crept into God's Eden
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; and brought and introduced the first
[1:55:11] rays of darkness, I can't call it rays
[1:55:13] of darkness, but the shadows of
[1:55:15] darkness, God, he didn't creep in. He
[1:55:19] come thundering down.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Out of the heavenlies with a cloud, a
[1:55:26] sign in the heavens, and a rainbow over
[1:55:29] his head.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with a little book open in
[1:55:34] his hand
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; and the names of the people, the
[1:55:39] individuals, your name, your life
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; written in here. The kind of life you
[1:55:44] were not living, but the kind of life he
[1:55:46] ordained you to live.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; I will speak my word.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; They will hear that word.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; My spirit will come to that word and
[1:55:57] life will commence.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. eternal life will commence.
[1:56:02] This is my elect. This is my body. This
[1:56:05] is my bride. And I will marry her.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And we are one.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Couple more minutes and I'm going to be
[1:56:18] done.
[1:56:26] Yes. the congaling of the darkness.
[1:56:35] As brother Brandham is coming to the end
[1:56:37] of shalom
[1:56:40] at the very end of the book, he just
[1:56:42] kind of summarizes again like he did at
[1:56:44] the beginning.
[1:56:46] It says John was the light.
[1:56:49] He was more light than Elijah
[1:56:53] and them had Elijah. He wasn't Elijah's
[1:56:57] light, but he was Elijah in another
[1:56:59] form.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Of vindicating the light
[1:57:03] he was. And he says, "And when Jesus
[1:57:05] come," he said he was a bright and
[1:57:06] shining light for a season. You love to
[1:57:10] walk in his light. He said, "And then
[1:57:13] John said, now I must dim out.
[1:57:16] Now I must dim out. I must go out now.
[1:57:21] My light's finished shining. I must go
[1:57:25] out. He must increase.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; He's the light.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm the light of the
[1:57:33] world."
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. In the same yesterday,
[1:57:38] today, and forever. And he's still the
[1:57:39] light of the world. And what he is in
[1:57:42] the beginning was the word, and the word
[1:57:44] was with God. Why was he the light of
[1:57:46] the world? If he'd come, he said he was
[1:57:48] the Messiah. and he didn't do like the
[1:57:50] Bible said then the Messiah wouldn't
[1:57:52] then the Messiah would do that Messiah
[1:57:56] would do. He wasn't the light if he
[1:57:57] didn't do what the Messiah was supposed
[1:57:59] to do. It's the vindicated word that
[1:58:01] makes it light.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And in this hour
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; that we're living in
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; is where I want to come to. And in this
[1:58:07] hour that we're living in the aindicated
[1:58:10] word for this hour
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Pentecostals he said you say speaking in
[1:58:14] tongues and so forth. That was the day
[1:58:16] of Pentecost. That was the light of the
[1:58:18] hour. Then he said, "See, this is
[1:58:20] another day."
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; And he's the light of the hour today,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; the seventh church age, all smothered
[1:58:28] out with Christ on the outside.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; You see, even the church, read it in
[1:58:34] Revelation. Where's Jesus?
[1:58:37] And the world have made a very, very sad
[1:58:42] picture
[1:58:44] with Christ standing on the outside.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Knocking to get in. The light on the
[1:58:51] outside.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Whatever they had inside was an
[1:58:55] artificial light. Whatever they had
[1:58:57] inside,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; I hope you can I hope you can understand
[1:59:03] me. There's people sitting in churches
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; scattered throughout this entire
[1:59:09] continent
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; of United States and Canada and
[1:59:12] throughout the world sitting in churches
[1:59:15] living in an artificial light.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God even interpreted
[1:59:21] for them many of them living in a glare
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; of another age.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; And so they're living in a glare say I
[1:59:27] see a light but it's a glare. Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; And another example he gave, they say a
[1:59:34] mirage,
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; something that looms up
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; because of the extreme heat,
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; extreme famine,
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; people clawing their way across the
[1:59:48] desert.
[1:59:50] And the scripture tells us that this day
[1:59:53] would be a time of famine.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; People are dying. They're clawing and
[1:59:59] men and women. It says they will go to
[2:00:00] and fro throughout the whole earth
[2:00:02] trying to find the word
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; and it says and shall not find it.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's part of the famine.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; And so they see a mirage,
[2:00:17] a Hollywood mirage.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Or some other kind of mirage.
[2:00:24] Oh, they say a mirage of wonderful
[2:00:27] things and a great future. And if I can
[2:00:29] just earn enough, I can make enough, if
[2:00:30] I can have enough money, it's a mirage.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; It'll disappear as fast as it showed
[2:00:36] out.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; And some of you that may be doubting,
[2:00:44] you wait till you get my age and you
[2:00:45] know it's the truth. If there is such a
[2:00:47] thing.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; And I don't see it happening
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; because the light has pressed the
[2:00:52] darkness.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; And if you don't see the darkness,
[2:00:55] friends, if you can't, it's not even see
[2:00:57] it. It's a matter of actually feeling it
[2:00:59] and sensing it.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; And now, brother Brandham comes to this.
[2:01:11] The dawning of a new day. I'm not just
[2:01:14] reading a quote.
[2:01:16] I'm reading
[2:01:18] what's a reality
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; in my own soul.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; The dawning of a new day. I feel it all
[2:01:26] over me now. He said it. I'm saying it.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not merely reading. I'm saying it. I
[2:01:33] feel the dawning of a new day
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; all over me now.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; The light of a new day.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; There's another day, friends.
[2:01:44] I charge you in the name of Jesus
[2:01:46] Christ, don't go out these doors and
[2:01:47] live the same old rat race you've lived
[2:01:49] before.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; It's not worth it.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; We're just contributing to the darkness
[2:01:55] of this world. Sell out for God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Sell out for this word.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; He said, I can feel the rays of this
[2:02:03] light breaking through upon my soul. The
[2:02:06] new day, the old one is pressing away.
[2:02:08] And as I feel the mortal blood pouring
[2:02:10] through my body, and I do, he said, I
[2:02:13] feel the surge of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; come in behind
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; and behind it
[2:02:21] rise and shine.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; My ears, your ears
[2:02:29] must be tuned. I hear I hear another
[2:02:32] sound. Amen.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I hear
[2:02:37] the sound
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; of the heavenly sound.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; I'm listening
[2:02:49] to
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; another sound.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; You, brother Louie, do you sing that
[2:02:58] song?
[2:03:01] I'm listening. Why don't you brothers
[2:03:03] come up and help us sing that? What is
[2:03:07] it? I'm I keep listening for another
[2:03:10] sound.
[2:03:12] The sound.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Rod has it. Okay, I'll
[2:03:21] help us. Brother Rod, would you
[2:03:26] I think we should have
[2:03:29] remember the last time I said, "Do you
[2:03:32] brothers know this song?" He said, "No."
[2:03:34] And I said, "All right, we'll sing it. I
[2:03:36] am redeemed. I am redeemed." And soon as
[2:03:37] we started, Brother Lou, you were
[2:03:38] standing way at the back. He says, "Why
[2:03:40] am I not up there?"
[2:03:43] I know you want to be up here.
[2:03:50] Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:59] I hope you folks,
[2:04:01] I won't call you folks, but brothers and
[2:04:03] sisters in Christ
[2:04:05] will appreciate.
[2:04:07] It's hard to convey everything that's on
[2:04:10] a person's heart, but I pray the Holy
[2:04:12] Ghost will just take it and make it a
[2:04:14] reality to you. The theme of this
[2:04:16] service today was God who created light.
[2:04:21] He knew exactly its source, precisely
[2:04:24] its strength, and exactly where it was
[2:04:26] going to shine.
[2:04:28] And he gave it for a purpose.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; You holding that?
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; And then he created different lights,
[2:04:38] but the one I said I was speaking of was
[2:04:40] the light behind the veil. And believe
[2:04:43] it or not, I'm going to conclude with
[2:04:44] that at this moment.
[2:04:48] And I'll give you the prophet of God's
[2:04:50] words.
[2:04:52] Everyone listening,
[2:04:55] he said, "You are the veil.
[2:04:59] You now veil him."
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you on the authority of
[2:05:04] God's word. And just behind that veil
[2:05:08] is a supernatural light.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:13] The same God. When next time you see the
[2:05:16] sun, please look up at the sun. Don't
[2:05:19] look at it, but look up to it and say,
[2:05:21] "The same God who put you there
[2:05:26] put this light here behind this veil."
[2:05:28] Amen.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; The same God that gave you the strength
[2:05:31] that you have to warm the earth and to
[2:05:34] bring forth seeds is the same God who
[2:05:36] put this light here behind this veil
[2:05:39] with a with a specific strength with a
[2:05:42] specific purpose with a divine intent
[2:05:46] that it shall shine to a certain place
[2:05:48] and it might be in my workplace or in my
[2:05:50] home or wherever it is but that God
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; of creation put this light here.
[2:05:56] Hallelujah. Go ye children of light.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Go and shine into gross darkness.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; And may God be with you.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; May God May God shine his light through
[2:06:09] you with such intensity it will light
[2:06:13] the area around you. I know it will. I
[2:06:15] know it will.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; And the people will see the glory of
[2:06:18] God.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; They may not all come to it.
[2:06:24] Excuse
[2:06:28] me.
[2:06:30] I had a major part of this message that
[2:06:34] I'm not able to come to. But you're
[2:06:36] spiritual. You're mature.
[2:06:39] You're spiritually adult.
[2:06:42] And I'm just going to give you the line
[2:06:45] Jesus speaking.
[2:06:48] He told the people and told them to
[2:06:50] beware
[2:06:51] lest that light that is in them become
[2:06:55] darkness.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; You might say how can that be?
[2:07:00] Well, it can be when we just take it too
[2:07:05] casual.
[2:07:07] We become insincere
[2:07:10] and we sit and we become deaf and dull
[2:07:13] and slow.
[2:07:18] And it doesn't mean what it's supposed
[2:07:19] to mean. And I can tell you it's not. It
[2:07:22] can't light your pathway.
[2:07:27] Knowledge is light.
[2:07:32] I would have taken you to Adam and Eve
[2:07:34] and they partok of a tree of good and
[2:07:35] evil and they brought forth a son who
[2:07:39] had knowledge
[2:07:42] to commit murder.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Right? and another son who had
[2:07:46] revelation
[2:07:48] and offered a sacrifice acceptable to
[2:07:50] God.
[2:07:52] So you see
[2:07:56] all light,
[2:07:59] all light, even the light of the gospel,
[2:08:04] it needs to be adhered to. It needs to
[2:08:06] be reverenced. It needs to be respected,
[2:08:12] brethren.
[2:08:15] You can see now imagine, just let your
[2:08:19] mind go. You've listened to the tapes. A
[2:08:22] person stands here.
[2:08:25] The prophet of God stands here and
[2:08:28] between them is that light. One place he
[2:08:32] said, "I'm speaking to you through the
[2:08:35] pillar of fire. I'm speaking to you
[2:08:37] through that light."
[2:08:40] And most often, very often, that light
[2:08:42] would hover over a person
[2:08:45] and he would say, "You're having a warm
[2:08:47] feeling. You have a certain feeling." He
[2:08:49] would describe the feeling because he
[2:08:51] knew what the light produced.
[2:08:55] And then he would say to several
[2:08:57] individuals at different times, he said,
[2:09:00] "Now, it depends
[2:09:02] upon what you think this is.
[2:09:06] If you think it's of God,
[2:09:09] if you think I'm God's prophet, that's
[2:09:13] where your reward will come from. Right
[2:09:16] under that light. But if you think it's
[2:09:19] of Satan, that's where your reward will
[2:09:21] come from.
[2:09:25] I feel like screaming out a warning.
[2:09:27] Don't sit in Cloverdale Bible way
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; with any intent of not adhering to every

[2:13:26] that, say, "Praise God."
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; The light's coming right in behind it.
[2:13:30] That's what's making it dark.
[2:13:32] Hallelujah.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; This is a confused place. These men
[2:13:37] haven't got the answers. Say, "Praise
[2:13:39] God."
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; They can't have it because it's it's The
[2:13:44] answer isn't in the world. The answer
[2:13:46] isn't in religion, not in politics, not
[2:13:48] in your school. It's nothing. It's not
[2:13:50] in your job.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:14:20] time, they have to leave right away
[2:14:21] because they're having lunchon with some
[2:14:23] people uh who paid a lot to do that.
