[18:39] This atmosphere of worship, we'll just
[18:41] ask our brother John Andes to come and
[18:43] lead the congregation in prayer this
[18:45] morning. Brother John,
[18:47] [Music]
[18:50] just want to give a testimony and also a
[18:52] prayer request for sister uh Sharon
[18:55] Holur. Uh Friday night she was on her
[18:57] way to the prayer meeting uh from the
[18:59] border uh just coming up uh 264th and
[19:03] 16th Avenue and uh a drunk driver
[19:06] smashed into her car and uh she didn't
[19:09] even know what hit her and uh when she
[19:11] came to there just happened to be an
[19:13] accident just ahead on the same road and
[19:16] the paramedics came right to sister
[19:18] Sharon and was able to give her oxygen
[19:20] and and take her to the hospital and we
[19:23] just want to say thank you Lord Jesus
[19:24] tonight and her whole car just it was
[19:27] three feet just right into the back of
[19:29] her um car just totally smashed and into
[19:33] uh two or three other vehicles out into
[19:35] the intersection and God saved her life
[19:37] on Friday night and we're able to visit
[19:39] her yesterday in the hospital. Uh she
[19:42] broke her wrist. She needs surgery
[19:44] tomorrow morning about noon on the wrist
[19:47] and there's other uh bruises and
[19:49] injuries that the Lord will heal. But we
[19:51] just thank the Lord for sparing Sister
[19:54] Sharon's life. It was right at 7:10. She
[19:57] just happened to look up at her clock uh
[19:59] right before the impact and that's what
[20:01] she remembers. You know, God is mindful
[20:03] every moment of our lives. But we just
[20:06] want to hold her up uh today that God
[20:08] will just heal her. How many else have a
[20:11] need that you just like to worship the
[20:12] Lord and say, "God, I believe. I
[20:15] believe. I believe all things are
[20:17] possible, Lord. Lord, we're still in
[20:20] worship, Lord. This is part of worship,
[20:23] God. Lifting up our hands, Lord. We
[20:25] don't want a form here to choke out or
[20:28] clog out, Lord, the arteries of our
[20:30] hearts, giving praises to your name,
[20:32] God, for eternal life that's flowed down
[20:36] into our lives. Lord, we want to cry out
[20:39] from our situation, from our lives,
[20:42] every individual. How great is your
[20:45] mercy and grace to come to each one of
[20:48] us and come to us in our time of our
[20:51] seasons of our lives and bring us
[20:53] salvation.
[20:55] It was so rich. It was so full and it's
[20:59] free God that we can just rejoice God
[21:02] and lives can lift up hands today Lord
[21:05] with burdens on their hearts, needs in
[21:08] the congregation, but with one thing on
[21:11] our lips. Lord, we believe you. Lord, we
[21:15] love you, God. You're the only true
[21:17] living God. Thankful for a place we can
[21:20] come into and let off the pressure. We
[21:22] can praise your name, God. We can wave
[21:25] our hands. We can shout out hallelujah.
[21:29] We can say amen God that we're so
[21:32] privileged to be in the atmosphere of
[21:34] the Holy Spirit God and have your
[21:37] presence even now saturating this whole
[21:40] building going out on the internet God.
[21:43] You are mindful of every seed, every
[21:46] predestinated life. We want to surrender
[21:49] today God. We want your Holy Spirit,
[21:52] God, to let perfect faith arise in our
[21:55] souls as we are in the very climax of
[21:58] time. We don't want anything in the way,
[22:01] God. Any grieving, any sin of unbelief,
[22:05] right now, we confess it, God, and we
[22:07] want to put it under the blood, Lord.
[22:10] Your spirit could could have full reign
[22:12] even in our prayers. Even right now,
[22:15] every man and woman, every young person
[22:17] and old could have a connection with
[22:20] Jesus Christ. And you could come down
[22:22] and fill these vessels, Lord. Our hands
[22:25] are lifted up, God. Our hearts are
[22:28] speaking, Lord. Even out of our lips,
[22:30] Lord. Some are whispering. Some are
[22:32] shouting, God. But you know our needs,
[22:35] Lord. You know our requests. And we
[22:37] believe that you're already on the way,
[22:39] God. You've provided the way, God.
[22:42] healing, salvation, the Holy Spirit, and
[22:45] even the direction that we need.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to thank you tonight for
[22:51] Sister Sharon Holer. This morning, God,
[22:54] Friday night, God, could have been the
[22:56] end of her life, but you've spared our
[22:58] sister. And as a congregation, we want
[23:01] to rejoice with her family that you've
[23:04] given our sister Sharon, God, grace and
[23:06] mercy and that you have given her, Lord,
[23:09] what a wonderful thing to be with her
[23:12] yesterday in prayer. So grateful, Lord,
[23:14] that you've spared her life. And Lord,
[23:17] that you would just heal her wrist,
[23:19] Lord, that's been broken and other
[23:21] complications and bruises and and and
[23:24] things that happened during the
[23:25] accident. We just feel your angels was
[23:28] all around her. God, oh father, even as
[23:31] our pastor conveyed to her the thoughts
[23:34] on his heart, how Satan has his reward,
[23:37] but sister Sharon has her reward, too.
[23:40] And we know that one day our arch enemy
[23:43] Satan will be destroyed and he'll be
[23:46] cast into a lake of fire. And how our
[23:49] hearts will rejoice as believers that
[23:52] our reward is eternity with you, God.
[23:55] and we'll be around your throne where
[23:58] we'll be rejoicing. We'll be praising
[24:00] you, God. We'll be so grateful for the
[24:03] day, for the hours that we lived our
[24:06] lives for you, God, we will have no
[24:08] regrets then. So, Lord, let us live in
[24:11] our liberty today. Our pastor comes
[24:14] forth, God. And as we hear singing and
[24:17] dedications and baptisms today, oh, what
[24:20] a full day we have, God. You are
[24:23] bringing life to your bride, God. As
[24:26] Boaz was married to her great Ruth,
[24:29] Lord, we're married to you. And we're
[24:31] not just gleaning anymore, but now we're
[24:34] married with you. And your very thoughts
[24:36] and your life is flowing right into our
[24:39] wombs, Lord, that we can receive it,
[24:42] God, all that you have for us. Bless
[24:44] every need, God, and every life. We just
[24:47] feel such a sacredness today in the
[24:49] sanctuary. May every life be impacted by
[24:52] that, God. May our pastor speak the
[24:55] words of eternal life that would be for
[24:58] every need. Just break it down to our
[25:00] lives, God, as you know, our bodies, our
[25:02] spirits, and our souls and how they cry
[25:05] out for more of you, Jesus. Fill every
[25:08] fiber. We want to thank you, God, for
[25:11] your dealings. Lord, we thank you,
[25:14] Jesus, for the miracles, the healings,
[25:16] and we wait upon you further for your
[25:19] glory. Amen.

[25:40] times longer to dedicate three as it
[25:42] does one, but I guess we'll find out

[34:14] Uh we're praying they don't start crying
[34:17] because they they're a trio.
[34:22] Uh after about 7 years,
[34:25] God gave brother Marco sit there Sharon
[34:28] an instant family
[34:30] and God was gracious beyond measure to
[34:32] bless them with the three healthy
[34:35] children and were indeed happy.
[34:39] grandparents on both sides of the family
[34:42] uh are believers and we're so happy for
[34:45] that. Brother Lex and Sister Tilly
[34:47] Vanenter
[34:48] and Brother Dave and Sister Marilyn
[34:50] Chabberonoff
[34:52] and we're thankful and happy for them.
[34:55] God bless them. I think the grandparents
[34:57] should stand if they would because
[35:01] they're a big part of this
[35:03] &gt;&gt; ongoing ongoing part
[35:07] and
[35:11] and also uh Aunt Sonia haven't even
[35:16] checking your hand sister Sonia forgive
[35:18] me uh sister Sonia
[35:22] and her husband Tace Tace had to remain
[35:26] in South Africa. But Sister Sonia, if
[35:28] you can believe it, I don't know if
[35:29] you've ever heard of this before, flew
[35:31] halfway around the world to help her
[35:33] sister Tilly care for these children.
[35:37] And they have their shifts. Brother
[35:40] Marco was educated in robotics,
[35:43] robotics. And he didn't know why he was
[35:46] studied robotics, but now he knows three
[35:49] minutes of this and down here and that
[35:51] comes over here and the diapers are over
[35:53] here and he just reaching everywhere
[35:57] and he he's got everything right down to
[36:00] uh uh right down to seconds. I visited
[36:03] with them and and everything happens
[36:05] around you. We're real thankful for
[36:08] that. Sister Sonia, I'd like if you
[36:10] would stand. We know you, but of course,
[36:12] this is an honor to you for flying
[36:14] around the world.
[36:20] God bless you.
[36:22] Also, the greatgrandparents, which is
[36:24] the father
[36:27] of uh sister Sonia and sister Tilly,
[36:31] their father, brother James Duplacy. We
[36:34] call him brother Dupy. I met him first
[36:36] in 1978.
[36:39] He came with brother Willie Ratif, his
[36:41] pastor, and brother Theo Rasmus, who has
[36:44] gone on to be with the Lord. They sat
[36:46] around our table, and I remember my wife
[36:49] co baked them a nice salmon. Little did
[36:52] I ever realize we'd be connected this
[36:56] way and have my granddaughter and
[36:58] brother Dupy's grandson standing here.
[37:01] and and of course, brother Marco just
[37:05] followed in his elder brother's
[37:07] footsteps who married
[37:10] Andrea.
[37:12] And so now we have Rickart marrying one
[37:15] daughter and one granddaughter and
[37:17] brother Marco the other. Well, I know
[37:20] that they're concerned about these
[37:22] children and we're not concerned about
[37:25] them.
[37:29] Good things come in threes
[37:32] and uh I expect this is a good thing.
[37:36] We have three children,
[37:38] Georgia Ray,
[37:41] Shiloh Pearl, and they're identical
[37:44] twins. And Wesley Joel is the odd one.
[37:51] I say that respectfully.
[37:54] Georgia. They thought a good deal about
[37:56] these names. Georgia is a worker of the
[37:59] earth
[38:01] or a farmer. She's not going to be a
[38:03] farmer, but she can maybe have a green
[38:06] thumb or get close to nature, a work of
[38:09] the earth. Rey is a lamb.
[38:14] Shiloh
[38:16] is peace and tranquility.
[38:19] to be at rest, to be at peace, to be
[38:22] quiet, to be at ease.
[38:25] And her second name, Pearl, is a word of
[38:27] great value.
[38:30] Wesley
[38:32] Joel.
[38:33] Wesley, some one of the West, but he's
[38:36] certainly in the West. And Jehovah God
[38:39] Joel
[38:41] daughter one is a worker
[38:44] connected close to the earth. Second
[38:46] daughter one is peaceful speaking words
[38:50] of great value
[38:52] and a son is to declare that Jehovah is
[38:55] God
[38:57] in blasphemous names. Brother Brandham
[38:59] said everything
[39:01] is perfected in threes.
[39:05] My wife and I have three children. Many
[39:07] others here have. It took us five or six
[39:10] years to do what they've done in less
[39:12] than a year.
[39:14] This is called an instant family.
[39:20] on a serious moment. Brother Marco and
[39:22] Sister Sharon have had a very deep and
[39:25] abiding respect
[39:28] for this message.
[39:31] A very deep respect for this message for
[39:33] God's prophet,
[39:36] the messenger,
[39:38] the message that was spoken
[39:41] for the ministry,
[39:43] for their parents,
[39:46] that goes a long way.
[39:49] It's not for the people so much, but the
[39:51] office that God has given.
[39:55] And Marco has been a real lover of the
[39:57] message.
[39:59] And I know that these children will be
[40:01] raised in the fear and the admonition of
[40:04] the Lord. And I pray that as I pray a
[40:07] prayer dedication, I pray that that
[40:08] respect that you, Brother Marco and
[40:10] Sharon, have will be passed off to these
[40:13] children.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; If they inherit anything, I pray they
[40:16] will inherit that. And I have
[40:20] uh looked to the Lord for something to
[40:23] say and very little came. I felt very
[40:26] directed. You stand here and as a
[40:29] servant of Christ, bless these children
[40:33] and bless this home.
[40:36] And so that's what I feel to do. I uh
[40:40] want to read some scripture
[40:44] and it is the blessing of God through
[40:47] Moses.
[40:49] And all the blessings shall come upon
[40:51] thee
[40:53] and overtake thee as these children have
[40:56] overtaken you. If thou shalt hearken
[40:59] unto the voice of the Lord thy God,
[41:02] blessed shalt thou be in the city,
[41:06] and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
[41:09] Blessed shalt be the fruit of thy body,
[41:13] and the fruit of thy ground, and the
[41:16] fruit of thy cattle, and the increase of
[41:19] thy kind, and the flocks of thy sheep.
[41:22] Blessed shall be thy basket, and thy
[41:26] store.
[41:28] And the rest of the chapter is too long
[41:31] for us to read. It's all blessings
[41:34] and curses if the people didn't keep the
[41:37] word of God. And this is a couple that
[41:40] have
[41:41] indeed been a blessing to the bride of
[41:43] Jesus Christ. And I'm not going to
[41:46] attempt to hold these three, but I'm
[41:48] going to bless each one individually if
[41:50] you'll bow your head with me. In the
[41:52] name of Jesus Christ,
[41:55] which one do we have here?
[42:02] Heavenly Father,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; I stand here, Lord, as a minister of the
[42:08] gospel of Jesus Christ before a father
[42:11] that is holding two of these children.
[42:15] We bless Georgia Ray in the blessed name
[42:18] of Jesus Christ that has been revealed
[42:20] in this hour. And I pray, oh God, that
[42:24] you will give to her, Father, the Holy
[42:27] Spirit at the earliest possible age she
[42:29] can receive it.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I pray that when she comes to the age of
[42:33] accountability, her ears will well have
[42:35] heard the name of Jesus Christ
[42:38] multitudes of times in their home. Lord,
[42:41] if any child affliction comes upon them,
[42:44] their father and mother shall unite as
[42:47] one and pray for them and you will heal
[42:50] them. I lay my hand oh God upon shallow
[42:53] pearl in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[42:56] bless her. I bless these children oh God
[43:00] and they shall grow and be nurtured and
[43:02] strengthened. They will become believers
[43:05] of this end time message. Let them be
[43:08] examples of a shining brilliant
[43:11] examples. Hold them hold them in your
[43:14] purity oh God all the days of their
[43:17] life. Yes.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; I lay my hand, oh God, upon Wesley Joel.
[43:22] May he, Father, be live a life that will
[43:25] certainly declare Jehovah is God and
[43:29] there's none other beside him. Father, I
[43:32] pray that this family will be blessed
[43:34] immensely with the lives of these
[43:37] children. I pray, oh God, that mother
[43:40] and father will be filled with wisdom.
[43:43] And as you have given them, oh God, I
[43:45] want to thank you for the healthy
[43:47] children. I want to thank you for the
[43:49] wonderful time as sister Sharon has
[43:52] carried them all these months. Oh God,
[43:55] without a moment of sickness, oh God, I
[43:58] pray that that holy that holy atmosphere
[44:02] will be upon the home. Father, I pray
[44:04] that the mother and the father, Lord, oh
[44:06] God, as they speak of you, as they hear
[44:09] your word and hear your messenger,
[44:12] &gt;&gt; these children as they become acquainted
[44:14] with their mother and father's voice,
[44:16] may they become acquainted with the
[44:18] voice of God.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[44:22] dedicate each one of them.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Georgia Ray, Shiloh Pearl, Wesley, Joel,
[44:29] back into the name of Jesus Christ to
[44:32] your care, to your keeping. And you
[44:35] watch over them when they're out of the
[44:37] eyesight of mother and father.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; You watch over them, oh God, when mother
[44:41] and father cannot reach them. You will
[44:43] care for them, oh father, and as you
[44:46] have given them as gifts to this couple,
[44:50] brother Marco and sister Sharon, they
[44:53] stand here to give them back in return
[44:55] to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[44:59] dedicate them. Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[45:16] Well, we couldn't take just a minute
[45:18] with that because
[45:20] I've told them whatever they plan to do,
[45:23] it'll be times three.
[45:26] Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a song, right? Good.
[45:32] We got time to serve the Lord today.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jason, it's so good to see you.
[45:38] We've been waiting to see you. I wonder
[45:40] if Brother Jason, Sister Sammy, and
[45:44] maybe their kids if you just stand up so
[45:46] we know who you are. Jason and Sammy
[45:48] Keane from Bellingham.
[45:51] [Music]
[45:56] God bless you.
[45:58] Amen.
[46:02] Sister Natasha, are you here?
[46:05] As she comes and gets ready, we'll just
[46:07] sing. Word of God, speak. Would you pour
[46:09] down like rain?
[46:12] Word of God, speak.
[46:16] Would you pour down like rain?
[46:20] Pausing my eyes to see
[46:25] your majesty.
[46:28] Be still and know.
[46:31] You're in this place.
[46:35] Please let me stay and rest
[46:39] in your holiness.
[46:43] Word of God speak.
[46:46] [Music]
[46:57] [Music]
[47:25] Whatever happened to tell death to us
[47:29] part?
[47:30] [Music]
[47:32] Does the home reflect the heart?
[47:38] Parents faces tell of worried minds.
[47:44] While children search, but they can't
[47:47] seem to find.
[47:51] It's time we took a closer look.
[47:57] got back to living by the holy book.
[48:03] No compromise
[48:06] without getting slack.
[48:09] You see, church won't go forward. It
[48:12] will just go back.
[48:18] We'll know the tree by the fruit we see.
[48:24] Serving God has no in between.
[48:29] [Music]
[48:30] We're either cold
[48:32] or we're hot.
[48:36] He said in his word, lukewarm shall have
[48:40] no part.
[48:42] It's coming down to in or out.
[48:48] Well, there's no time for all this
[48:51] playing around.
[48:54] We're going back to lost or found
[49:00] church. We've got to go back. We've got
[49:03] to stand our ground.
[49:08] We've got to go back to living true.
[49:14] We're going back to the absolute.
[49:20] Oh, back to where the church stands
[49:24] strong.
[49:26] Oh, back to where there's a right
[49:30] and there's a wrong. Back to where it's
[49:34] black or white.
[49:38] You see the difference. It's like day
[49:41] and night.
[49:44] We're going back to things above.
[49:49] love. We are going back to our first
[49:53] love.
[49:55] [Music]
[49:59] We're going to rise like a sleeping
[50:02] giant,
[50:05] standing tall in God's strength and
[50:08] might.
[50:11] Well, all the power we've claimed for so
[50:14] long,
[50:16] it has returned and we've been made
[50:20] strong.
[50:22] Oh, we're not looking to the right or to
[50:26] the left.
[50:28] You see these eyes? They're spiritled.
[50:34] We're going back to truth or fault.
[50:40] church. We've got to go back
[50:42] to Calvar's cross.
[50:47] We've got to go back to living true.
[50:53] We're going back to the absolute.
[50:59] Oh, back to where the church stands
[51:03] strong.
[51:05] Oh, back to where there's a right
[51:09] and there's a wrong. Back to where it's
[51:13] black.
[51:16] You see the difference. It's like day
[51:20] and night.
[51:22] We're going back to things above.
[51:28] We're going back to our first love.
[51:34] We've got to go back to living truth.
[51:39] We're going back to the absolute.
[51:45] Oh, back to where the church stands
[51:49] strong.
[51:50] Yes. Back to where there's a right
[51:54] and there's a road. Back to where it's
[51:59] back. Oh,
[52:02] you see the difference. It's like day
[52:05] and night.
[52:08] We're going back to things above.
[52:13] We're going back to our first love.
[52:19] We're going back to things above.
[52:25] We're going back to our
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:44] We've got to go back to living true.
[52:50] We're going back to the
[52:55] back to where the church is strong.
[53:01] It's back to where there's a
[53:04] [Music]
[53:06] [Applause]
[53:12] you see the difference
[53:15] of God.
[53:17] We're going back to Jes.
[53:21] [Music]
[53:23] We're going back to our first love.
[53:30] Hallelujah.
[53:32] [Music]
[53:38] Hallelujah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Back.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Back to this.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Send Elijah the prophet.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; He'll turn the heart of the children
[53:50] back
[53:52] &gt;&gt; to the original faith of the fathers.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful to be in this
[53:56] atmosphere?
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Just bow with me as we pray. Father,
[54:00] we've taken time to worship, time to
[54:03] pray, time to hear these songs. Oh God,
[54:07] we thank you, Father, for Sister Sharon
[54:09] that sang and and Sister Natasha that
[54:12] sang and for the people that sang. We're
[54:15] not just singing words, Lord. It's a
[54:18] reality in our soul. May the Holy Spirit
[54:21] witness today that you are receiving
[54:24] this worship to you. We worship you,
[54:27] Father, in spirit and in truth. Pray
[54:30] that you'll make this day an exceptional
[54:32] day, a day of blessing. Every day is a
[54:35] new day. This is the day the Lord hath
[54:37] made, and we will be glad and rejoice in
[54:40] it. We thank you, Father, for this
[54:43] supernatural thing that you have done
[54:45] for our brother Jason, sister Sammy.
[54:48] They've desired so much to be baptized.
[54:50] And tonight, oh God, that will take
[54:53] place. and others that will be baptized.
[54:56] Father, our brother Ben Ao, ask your
[54:58] blessing upon him today, oh God, as they
[55:01] look forward to this time. Father, in
[55:04] the name of Jesus Christ, we've come
[55:06] here to hear your word, and without you,
[55:08] we can do nothing. You are the revealer
[55:11] of your word, Lord. You're the baptizer
[55:14] in the Holy Spirit. I pray that any that
[55:17] are not filled with the Holy Ghost will
[55:20] be filled. And those, oh God, that need
[55:22] to be refilled will be refilled as we
[55:26] hear and receive your word. Anoint us,
[55:28] oh God. Anoint speaker and hearers in
[55:32] the lovely name of Jesus Christ. We ask
[55:34] it.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Isn't he wonderful?
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Well, if you were here Wednesday night,
[55:42] you will we're going to proceed further
[55:45] from that, but I'll give a little
[55:47] summary of it. You can turn in your
[55:49] Bibles if you would to Ephesians the 3
[55:52] chapter and then we'll be turning to
[55:55] Ephesians the 2 chapter.
[55:58] First we will read Ephesians 3
[56:01] 14:15 and 16.
[56:17] Once you found your scripture, if you'll
[56:19] just look this way. I would like to make
[56:22] a few comments before we read. I
[56:25] appreciate you all coming on this lovely
[56:27] day, being here, and blending our hearts
[56:31] together. We want it to be pleasing to
[56:33] the Lord.
[56:35] Our
[56:37] message, the message that we believe and
[56:41] that uh our faith is founded on
[56:46] is uh and as a most remarkable
[56:49] supernatural gospel
[56:53] &gt;&gt; been commissioned by an angel.
[56:57] The evidence of the angel of the Lord
[57:00] and the pillar of fire
[57:02] were present
[57:05] all through the ministry
[57:08] and it was something that was recognized
[57:11] by
[57:13] untold multitudes of people. Prophecies
[57:16] were spoken
[57:18] and fulfilled. Brother Brandham spoke
[57:21] prophecies, spoke them in public. Sir,
[57:24] is this the time in December and tells
[57:28] of the experience that should happen and
[57:31] two three months later it has taken
[57:33] place and we have the opening of the
[57:36] seals as a result of it foretelling of
[57:38] it. It's a message that speaks of the
[57:41] change of our bodies. It speaks of the
[57:43] theophony body that you have beside you.
[57:48] In the ministry of brother Brandham, he
[57:50] was reaching out into the supernatural
[57:53] and actually making us very very
[57:57] conscious of the supernatural.
[58:00] There are people today in the world and
[58:02] they are constantly trying to discover
[58:05] themselves
[58:06] because there's a part of the human
[58:09] psyche that is hard to understand and is
[58:12] very mysterious. And I hope to be able
[58:15] to take some of that mystery away today.
[58:20] The book that has been written by
[58:23] Professor Ed David Edwin Herrell of
[58:25] Birmingham, Alabama.
[58:28] He's the professor of history.
[58:32] He said these words
[58:35] uh concerning the great revival which
[58:38] was taking place between 1948 and 1958.
[58:41] And being a professor of history, he
[58:44] wanted to determine
[58:46] how and to what degree did this revival
[58:49] change the face of America.
[58:52] And he began to take the lives of men uh
[58:55] notable men, revivalists and outstanding
[58:59] men that were known to the pop public
[59:02] and very visible people. Wall Roberts
[59:06] and AA Allen, I think Velmer Gardner, WV
[59:09] Grant, and on and on because there was a
[59:12] a host of them that perhaps you're not a
[59:14] familiar with their names except for a
[59:16] few. and he said and he told me
[59:19] personally as he traveled up here and I
[59:21] spent a day with him
[59:24] uh because I used this quote on a radio
[59:28] broadcast that we had and he happened to
[59:30] be tuned into that station on that day
[59:32] and heard me use his name and he phoned
[59:35] me that's how that happened
[59:38] and I asked him how is it that you I
[59:42] notice you've given your first chapter
[59:45] is on the two giants
[59:47] William Brandom oral Roberts and you put
[59:49] Brother Brandham first and then in the
[59:51] pictorial section of the book you have
[59:54] the pillar of fires that appeared over
[59:56] the head of brother Brandham in Houston,
[59:58] Texas in the Sam Houston Coliseum. Why
[1:00:02] did you put that as first? And he said,
[1:00:06] "Well, it that's that's because those
[1:00:09] are the facts."
[1:00:12] And uh in his prologue this I read these
[1:00:16] words. The two giants of the healing
[1:00:19] revival, William Brandham and Oral
[1:00:20] Roberts, they were remarkably different
[1:00:23] personalities, but they quickly
[1:00:26] recognized one another as the premier
[1:00:28] leaders of the revival.
[1:00:30] Most of the participants of the revival
[1:00:33] looked upon Brham as its initiator. Out
[1:00:36] of his massive union meetings in 1947
[1:00:39] spread reports of hundreds of miracles
[1:00:42] and marvels. Brham seemed an unlikely
[1:00:45] leader. He had long been a pastor in a
[1:00:48] small independent Baptist church. He was
[1:00:52] introduced to the Pentecostal world by
[1:00:54] the despised oneness Pentecostals. His
[1:00:57] preaching was halting and simple beyond
[1:00:59] belief. But William Brham became a
[1:01:02] prophet to a generation.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. A small, meek, mild, a middle-aged
[1:01:08] man with piercing eyes, he held
[1:01:11] audiences spellbound with tales of
[1:01:14] constant communication with God and
[1:01:16] angels. That's why I'm reading this.
[1:01:20] Night after night before thousands of
[1:01:23] odded believers, he discerned the
[1:01:26] diseases of the sick and pronounced them
[1:01:29] healed.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:31] as he was telling telling me about
[1:01:35] uh how the book came about and then I
[1:01:37] asked him how was it that you I
[1:01:40] identified William Brandon he said I'd
[1:01:42] never heard of him he said and I I just
[1:01:45] as a educator I became interested in
[1:01:47] seeing how America
[1:01:50] the whole population of America had
[1:01:52] changed because of this revival and so
[1:01:56] he said I began to study the individual
[1:01:59] or Robertson Tommy Osburn and Tommy
[1:02:02] Hicks and all of these different
[1:02:03] individuals. He said, "And as I was
[1:02:05] compiling my data and my material on
[1:02:09] these various men," he said, "I found a
[1:02:11] common denominator. It would be here and
[1:02:14] this one, up here and this one, over
[1:02:15] here and this one, but I found the name
[1:02:18] William Brham in all of these men's
[1:02:20] lives." He said, ' And I said to say to
[1:02:23] myself, how is it I have never heard of
[1:02:26] this person? And he seems to be in the
[1:02:28] roots of every one of these men. He
[1:02:31] seems to be the flame that ignited. He
[1:02:34] was the torch that ignited their flame.
[1:02:36] So he said, "I laid all my studies
[1:02:38] aside." This is right here at a dinner
[1:02:40] table in this city. I laid all of my
[1:02:43] studies aside and determined I must find
[1:02:46] out who this man was. And when he was
[1:02:49] done, he gave him first place in his
[1:02:51] book because he said he believed indeed
[1:02:54] he was the initiator of this revival. I
[1:02:57] say to you, it's not because Professor
[1:03:00] Harold put him first. It was because the
[1:03:04] angel of the Lord,
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; a messenger from God, that God would
[1:03:09] cause the world to recognize it.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; And you and I have been birthed by a
[1:03:16] supernatural gospel.
[1:03:19] And it is a world apart,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; friends. Not because we're in another
[1:03:23] church or Cloverdale Bible Way has
[1:03:25] nothing to do with it. Because of the
[1:03:27] message you believe, we are a revelated
[1:03:31] people.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; We're in tune with another realm.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; The mass man that God has used has
[1:03:38] connected you
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; with the supernatural,
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; has connected you with the unseen. Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; God help us as we read now
[1:03:49] Ephesians 3:14. For this cause I bow my
[1:03:52] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:55] Christ, of whom the whole family in
[1:03:58] heaven and earth is named, that he would
[1:04:01] grant you according to the riches of his
[1:04:04] glory to be strengthened with might by
[1:04:06] his spirit in the inner man. And I would
[1:04:10] like you to pay attention to the inner
[1:04:12] man. Ephesians the 2 chapter
[1:04:16] verse 13 to 15.
[1:04:19] But now in Christ Jesus, you who were
[1:04:22] sometimes were a far off are made nigh
[1:04:25] by the blood of Christ. For he is our
[1:04:28] peace, who hath made both one, and hath
[1:04:32] broken down the middle wall of
[1:04:33] partition, which between us, having
[1:04:37] abolished in his flesh the enmity, even
[1:04:39] the law of commandments contained in
[1:04:42] ordinances, for to make in himself a
[1:04:46] twain, one new man, so making peace. I
[1:04:51] will read some other scriptures I've not
[1:04:53] announced, but Ephesians 4 once again,
[1:04:55] please turn to verse 22.
[1:05:00] That you put off concerning the former
[1:05:03] conversation,
[1:05:04] the old man. Notice now we have the new
[1:05:07] man. Now we have the old man, which is
[1:05:10] corrupt according to the deceitful
[1:05:12] lusts. and be renewed in the spirit of
[1:05:16] your mind
[1:05:17] and that you put on the new man which
[1:05:20] after God is created in righteousness
[1:05:23] and true holiness.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; If you care to just turn to Colossians
[1:05:27] quickly the third chapter, we'll read
[1:05:31] two verses there as well.
[1:05:34] Colossians the 3 chapter
[1:05:38] verse 9.
[1:05:42] Lie not one to another, seeing that ye
[1:05:45] have put off the old man with his deeds,
[1:05:49] and have put on the new man, which is
[1:05:52] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[1:05:56] him that created him.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[1:06:00] Thank you for being patient and
[1:06:03] standing.
[1:06:06] I wanted to be very pronounced today
[1:06:13] that we become conscious
[1:06:16] that we're more than just individual
[1:06:18] physical beings sitting here
[1:06:21] and you have your way of life. You have
[1:06:23] your own idiosyncrasies.
[1:06:26] You are made a certain way. You have a
[1:06:29] certain background after the flesh.
[1:06:32] That's after a natural birth.
[1:06:35] But we have a spiritual birth. There's
[1:06:38] not only the old man. This is the old
[1:06:40] man. And the old man, the old woman gets
[1:06:44] older day by day, but we have a new man.
[1:06:50] We spoke on on uh Wednesday
[1:06:55] uh concerning we led into this subject
[1:06:59] and how that God in the beginning began
[1:07:02] to create. We're talking about hearing
[1:07:04] the voice of God.
[1:07:09] The scripture says, for example, speak
[1:07:11] to my soul. What does that mean? What
[1:07:14] kind of feeling is that? Is that it's
[1:07:17] something that certainly goes far beyond
[1:07:20] just something penetrating our eardrums
[1:07:24] and resounding there. God spoke to to
[1:07:28] the substance of his creation.
[1:07:30] Now just turn your mind loose and let us
[1:07:34] go into what the scripture says, not
[1:07:37] what we've heard and what we've
[1:07:39] established before in our religious
[1:07:42] thinking.
[1:07:43] But God spoke to the substance of
[1:07:45] creation and it heard him and obeyed
[1:07:49] him. God spoke to the heavens. He spoke
[1:07:53] to the waters. He spoke to the earth. He
[1:07:57] spoke to man.
[1:07:59] and each in each case
[1:08:04] said very specific things just quickly
[1:08:07] as a summary now because I won't take
[1:08:10] much time with this just a couple
[1:08:12] minutes but when God said the Bible says
[1:08:15] and God said let there be light
[1:08:19] and when God said in the Hebrew he said
[1:08:23] is to not only speak or to utter because
[1:08:26] we have no we have nothing to relate to
[1:08:29] what the sound was, what the language
[1:08:31] was, if there was a sound. But the word
[1:08:35] speak in the Hebrew is to utter or to
[1:08:38] say in one's heart or to think or to
[1:08:42] command or to promise or to intend. Even
[1:08:47] if he had that intention, if he held
[1:08:50] that in his thoughts, he held it in his
[1:08:52] heart. He held it as a promise as
[1:08:55] something that he planned and intended
[1:08:58] to do that all is encompassed in the
[1:09:01] word and God said however God we we have
[1:09:06] no way of he as brother Brandham said he
[1:09:10] fills all time and space is too
[1:09:12] mysterious he had to become said that's
[1:09:14] why he become a son of man
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; so we could see uh and have a window
[1:09:20] into this great eternal being who has
[1:09:23] given given us life. We could see him.
[1:09:25] He was a God of compassion. He was a God
[1:09:28] of that was a healer. He was a God that
[1:09:31] would deliver people. He was a God that
[1:09:33] could cast out demon spirits. He could
[1:09:36] send the insane back home free and
[1:09:39] whole. And he's the same God.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And if he can get us to believe that,
[1:09:45] the more that we can believe that, the
[1:09:47] more we're in position to receive from
[1:09:50] him. And this God wants to give. He
[1:09:53] wants to give exactly what you have need
[1:09:55] of if he can get you to believe that he
[1:09:58] is there ready and here present with us
[1:10:01] to give it to us.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; And and the scripture says, "And God
[1:10:08] said, let there be light and let there
[1:10:09] be a firmament." And God said, "Let the
[1:10:11] waters under the heaven be gathered."
[1:10:13] And they were. And God said, "Let the
[1:10:15] earth bring forth." And it did. And God
[1:10:18] said, "Let the waters bring forth." And
[1:10:20] they did. And God said, "Let the earth
[1:10:22] bring forth of the living creature of
[1:10:24] his kind." And it did. And God said,
[1:10:27] "Let us make man in our image after our
[1:10:30] likeness." And he did.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; The creator is speaking to the substance
[1:10:36] of his creation.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; And whether that substance is has any
[1:10:43] life that can be animated or whether it
[1:10:46] was just substance, it obeyed him. The
[1:10:49] elements obeyed him.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; The potassium and the calcium and all of
[1:10:53] the things that make up the body, this
[1:10:56] obeyed him. How he formed man in his own
[1:11:00] image, how he took and formed us, we do
[1:11:03] not know. But the creator is speaking
[1:11:05] and giving his thoughts and his
[1:11:07] intention. And the prophet said it had
[1:11:10] to be a thought and then it became a
[1:11:11] word. And he spoke a word.
[1:11:15] Then I mo we moved on to the capacity of
[1:11:18] the seed, the children of God to hear
[1:11:22] the shepherd's voice.
[1:11:24] It's more than just a preacher behind a
[1:11:26] pullpit.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; It's more than even just reading a
[1:11:31] scripture.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; The shepherd knows exactly how and where
[1:11:36] you are
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and what you go through. And he who
[1:11:40] brought us here is prepared to lead us
[1:11:43] all the way to his intended lo direction
[1:11:47] or his intended destiny.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm coming to that in just a
[1:11:52] moment. I want to sew that in your minds
[1:11:54] very quickly because it's important to
[1:11:57] me at this time. Jesus said when he was
[1:11:59] here on earth, "My sheep hear my voice."
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Well, there are many that heard the
[1:12:04] vocal cords of Jesus, but very few heard
[1:12:07] his voice.
[1:12:09] He said, "And I know them
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; and they follow me. My sheep."
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Not all humans were his sheep.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; My sheep.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Even said to his disciples, "Go to the
[1:12:20] lost sheep of the house of Israel.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Go to those sheep."
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't everyone whose sheep.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; You take the serpent seed. It's all
[1:12:28] through the Bible. It's one of the most
[1:12:30] powerful scriptures. My sheep
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; hear my voice.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; And I know them. Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; And they follow me.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; The voice of the sign.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; When the angel of God spoke to the
[1:12:48] prophet, he said, "I'll give you two
[1:12:50] signs. One will be in your hand." I saw
[1:12:53] that. I was there. I was there. And he
[1:12:56] shook hands with the man. One of our
[1:12:57] elders of our church shook hands with
[1:12:59] our with him. And and and he looked up.
[1:13:02] He jerked quickly. He said, "Did you get
[1:13:04] that?" Well, I I didn't have any
[1:13:06] capacity. I didn't I wasn't given that
[1:13:08] kind of a gift, but he had in his hand.
[1:13:10] And then later when it came to the
[1:13:12] second pull, he just stood a distance
[1:13:14] from the people and revealed the secret
[1:13:17] of their heart. And as it was with
[1:13:18] Moses, if they don't hear I if and he
[1:13:21] says and it came to pass if they will
[1:13:23] not believe you not believe you neither
[1:13:27] hearken to the voice of the first sign
[1:13:31] they will believe the voice of the
[1:13:33] latter sign.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; So the sign had a voice.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; The voice the sign wasn't speaking
[1:13:39] wasn't uttering anything but it had a
[1:13:41] voice.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And those to whom it was intended heard
[1:13:45] that voice.
[1:13:48] So it comes to a different level than
[1:13:50] just receiving something in our ears or
[1:13:52] hearing somebody preach or becoming
[1:13:54] emotionally involved or emotionally
[1:13:57] attached to something. This friends has
[1:14:00] nothing to do with your family being
[1:14:01] here, your friends being here. It is
[1:14:04] between you and the almighty,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; between you and the divine almighty God.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the sooner we become uh uh
[1:14:14] become convinced of that,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; I believe that then we're in a place
[1:14:18] where we can move on.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; So there's obviously a sound or a voice
[1:14:25] uh with greater intensity that can reach
[1:14:28] into the parts of our being not
[1:14:31] connected with the physical hearing.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; I'm interested that you hear me. I'm
[1:14:36] interested that uh that you understand
[1:14:38] the words. I've prayed that God would
[1:14:41] make it very uh pronounced to you, but
[1:14:44] I'm more interested that the Holy Spirit
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; will take the words and take the
[1:14:50] substance of the thought and inject it
[1:14:53] into your heart and soul.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; So he said to Moses, "If they will not
[1:15:00] believe thee, they will believe the
[1:15:02] voice of the latter sign." Jesus said to
[1:15:06] the disciples, "Follow me. And as I
[1:15:10] pointed out Wednesday, this had an
[1:15:12] incredible effect upon the disciples.
[1:15:15] They were actually, the Bible says they
[1:15:16] were casting their net. Actually, they
[1:15:19] were casting their net into the into the
[1:15:22] sea when he spoke. And he says unto
[1:15:25] them, "Follow me, and I will make you
[1:15:28] fishers of men."
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; And they straightway or immediately left
[1:15:34] their nets
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and followed him. You can't tell me that
[1:15:38] anybody who just heard a man walking by
[1:15:42] the sea saying follow me that that his
[1:15:46] life could have had that kind of an
[1:15:47] effect. They heard something
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; that was far beyond the hearing. And
[1:15:53] that's what I'm interested in today. I
[1:15:56] want to say this message. If it had come
[1:15:58] out of a Bible school, you would need
[1:16:00] your eardrums to hear it. But this
[1:16:03] message goes far beyond the eardrums.
[1:16:06] This message is something that is so
[1:16:09] quick and so alive.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Uh my wife and I speaking as we came
[1:16:13] here and she was just saying it's so
[1:16:15] amazing that within our congregation,
[1:16:18] within our church, the people are lovers
[1:16:21] of the word of God.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; And you go from church to church and you
[1:16:25] find people scarcely know anything about
[1:16:28] the word of God. It's a social club.
[1:16:31] It's nothing more than a social club, a
[1:16:33] time to get together and socialize. We
[1:16:36] do socialize, but that's only a side
[1:16:39] benefit. We are here because we love the
[1:16:42] word of God,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; and we love his source. It came from
[1:16:49] God. And we love that God has sent us a
[1:16:52] messenger that could say, "Thus saith
[1:16:55] the Lord."
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And we receive it as that.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of others whose hearts had
[1:17:05] waxed gross and their ears dull of
[1:17:08] hearing. And I run into it all the time
[1:17:10] where people it it is as though they
[1:17:12] would even love to hear. They would love
[1:17:15] to have what you have. They would love
[1:17:17] to have the zeal. They would love to
[1:17:19] have that fervent spirit, but somehow it
[1:17:21] it escapes them. And I can tell you that
[1:17:24] the world and all of its religiosity
[1:17:28] and all of its programs, it has a
[1:17:30] tendency to dull the hearing so that
[1:17:34] people even want to hear. They want but
[1:17:36] they're escape and they they hear the
[1:17:38] same thing as you hear in the ears, but
[1:17:41] they don't hear the voice that comes to
[1:17:44] the soul.
[1:17:49] So, we're speaking of the inner man,
[1:17:52] the old man,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; but the inner man or the new man as it
[1:17:58] relates to the old man. I'm interested
[1:18:02] in the faculties of the inner man.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; You would not be sitting here today if
[1:18:08] you didn't have a physical body. And you
[1:18:10] would not be sitting here today if you
[1:18:12] didn't have an inner man.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] The scripture says, "If therefore any
[1:18:18] man be in Christ, he is a new creature."
[1:18:21] And the prophet gives that he is a new
[1:18:24] creation.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. And behold,
[1:18:29] all things are become new,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; and all things are of God, who hath
[1:18:35] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:18:37] Christ, and hath given to us the
[1:18:39] ministry of reconciliation.
[1:18:42] In Romans 6 and6 the scripture reads,
[1:18:44] "Knowing this that our old man
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; is crucified
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; with him
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:18:55] that henceforth we should not serve
[1:18:57] sin."
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; The first man, the first man of creation
[1:19:04] was a spirit man.
[1:19:11] the first man. And God said, "Let us
[1:19:14] make man in our image
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; and after our likeness." And when he was
[1:19:19] done, he had Adam,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; both masculine and feminine.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; So the first man of the creation
[1:19:30] was a spirit man.
[1:19:33] My question today and this is
[1:19:37] uh I've given a great deal of of thought
[1:19:39] and question to myself and I'm posing
[1:19:41] this to you. What is it that we are
[1:19:45] being restored back to?
[1:19:49] What is it that was in God's mind? What
[1:19:52] is full redemption? Where are we going
[1:19:55] back to? Are we going back to Adam and
[1:19:58] Eve
[1:20:01] post sin? Surely not. Are we going back
[1:20:06] to them just pre the fall
[1:20:10] or are we going back to what God formed
[1:20:14] when he said, "Let us make man in our
[1:20:17] image."
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And it was when he was done that and he
[1:20:22] gave a general summarization of all of
[1:20:25] creation and then he said and he looked
[1:20:28] upon this and said this is very good
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; and then he went into his rest.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; It was during that period
[1:20:38] we should be notified ahead as to what
[1:20:42] our destination is. What is the
[1:20:44] objective?
[1:20:45] I'm not interested friends in just
[1:20:47] playing a game. I'm not interested in
[1:20:49] just having church.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; I want to know why are we here?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And if God indeed has called us, why did
[1:20:57] God call us?
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; What is he calling us to? What is his
[1:21:01] objective? What is he plan?
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Any person working
[1:21:07] uh uh on a worthwhile project must keep
[1:21:10] the objective of that project in view.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Now, the first man was a spirit man. in
[1:21:17] questions and answers.
[1:21:19] Now, you'll listen very closely. I'm
[1:21:22] sure you will ask the question, please
[1:21:26] explain the difference between the
[1:21:28] spirit and the soul.
[1:21:32] Is 1961.
[1:21:36] He said, "But the first thing you are a
[1:21:40] triune being." You are a triune being
[1:21:45] just like father, son and holy ghost.
[1:21:48] Father, son and holy ghost is three
[1:21:51] titles going to one person which is
[1:21:55] Jesus Christ and your your soul,
[1:22:01] your body and spirit. But it takes the
[1:22:05] three to make you. with just one of
[1:22:09] them. You're not you.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; It takes the three of you.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Now friends, this is not a negative
[1:22:17] thought or negative statement, but we do
[1:22:20] indeed spend a horrific amount of time
[1:22:23] on the body.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; We feed the body, care for the body,
[1:22:27] want the body to feel right, want to
[1:22:29] extend its life, we want to give it
[1:22:31] enough rest. We do all these things for
[1:22:34] the body. But I can show you by the
[1:22:37] scriptures some of the scriptures which
[1:22:38] I've read will take on some new light
[1:22:41] that you have a capacity to hear and you
[1:22:44] are a person also within your soul
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; with w with within your soul.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Your soul is a is part of your being.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; It's the part of you that you do not
[1:22:55] fully understand.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; It's the part of you that perhaps is
[1:22:59] neglected.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; I say that again. It may often be
[1:23:04] neglected.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; We feed our body, but do we feed our
[1:23:07] soul
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; and the needs of the soul
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and the other part of our body? We we
[1:23:17] know all about our emotional self
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and those things. I have a number of
[1:23:22] quotes and I'm put them on the slide for
[1:23:25] the purpose of being able to read them
[1:23:29] with you.
[1:23:36] Now that is that one which I just read.
[1:23:41] And I want to go here to number two.
[1:23:45] When a man gets saved, he's just about
[1:23:48] like the light that comes into him is
[1:23:52] about like this little white button on
[1:23:55] my shirt. It's simple so that everybody
[1:23:58] can understand. That's when God comes
[1:24:00] into the inner part of a man. In the
[1:24:04] inner part of a man, a man is made up uh
[1:24:08] in in the system of the tabernacle.
[1:24:11] That's the tabernacle of the Old
[1:24:13] Testament.
[1:24:14] In the outer courts,
[1:24:17] then the holy place and the holiest of
[1:24:20] holies, the shakina glory on the inside
[1:24:24] the veil. The holy of holies is
[1:24:28] represented by your soul.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And that is the part God was not as
[1:24:34] concerned with the outer court which is
[1:24:36] your body.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And he was not nearly as concerned with
[1:24:40] the inner court which is your spirit,
[1:24:43] your emotional being.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; He is concerned and where God dwelt was
[1:24:48] in the soul. Your soul must be an in
[1:24:52] incredibly significant and important
[1:24:55] part of God's association and
[1:24:59] consequently with the service.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And each time we come here, we should
[1:25:04] know we're coming here to have our souls
[1:25:06] fed
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; to receive instruction in our soul
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; and have God speak to our soul
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and that we will become obedient to that
[1:25:16] voice.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now on the outside
[1:25:24] on the outside gates of a man there is
[1:25:27] five senses and enters that enters to
[1:25:30] his body. On the inside which is his
[1:25:32] soul
[1:25:34] or the soul he said is the nature of the
[1:25:37] spirit. I'd like you to notice brother
[1:25:40] Brandham he said as body
[1:25:44] soul and spirit and then towards the end
[1:25:46] of the ministry said body spirit and
[1:25:49] soul but did not change that did not
[1:25:52] change what he was saying about it. He
[1:25:55] says continually that the soul is the
[1:25:58] nature of the spirit.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; The soul is the nature of the life. And
[1:26:03] so I want you to notice that that is a
[1:26:05] that is an absolute the soul is the
[1:26:08] nature of the life.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And so he says that here and the soul is
[1:26:14] the nature of the spirit that's on the
[1:26:17] inside of his heart produces his soul
[1:26:20] which makes the atmosphere around him.
[1:26:24] And he has also he has also five
[1:26:27] entrances as we say the memory, the
[1:26:32] uh conscience and the affection and the
[1:26:36] reasoning and the imagination.
[1:26:40] Then on the inside he has only one gate
[1:26:43] one entrance to go into the shakina
[1:26:46] glory where God can enter into him and
[1:26:49] take over control take over in the
[1:26:52] control tower and that way is through
[1:26:55] self-will whether you will or you're or
[1:26:59] not that's up to you but that's the way
[1:27:03] that's the only avenue that's open to
[1:27:05] the man that God can come into his heart
[1:27:08] is by self-will.
[1:27:10] puts him right back like Adam and Eve on
[1:27:13] the free moral agency again. You can
[1:27:16] choose right or wrong. Either one you
[1:27:19] do. If you are born of his seed, you'll
[1:27:22] choose right.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; You'll choose his word.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And uh hear his voice.
[1:27:34] I think that we have this
[1:27:42] All right, just just take that one off
[1:27:44] for just a moment.
[1:27:46] In the message here, his voice, I'm
[1:27:48] laying some of this out first just to
[1:27:50] get some things established. He said, I
[1:27:52] was thinking when the soul has gone out
[1:27:55] of a man, what is it? He said, it's his
[1:27:59] inner being
[1:28:01] that has moved out. He's not dead. He's
[1:28:06] still alive. He lives forever and our
[1:28:09] loved ones who have passed on beyond
[1:28:11] this veil is in a body that we don't
[1:28:14] know what it is. It isn't revealed. This
[1:28:18] is back in 1958.
[1:28:21] And then
[1:28:23] I want to come to the token message
[1:28:25] here. Now the soul is the nature of the
[1:28:28] life.
[1:28:30] There is a life, a blood
[1:28:34] and a soul in the life. The soul is the
[1:28:38] nature of the life. Therefore, it had no
[1:28:41] certain it had no certain nature. Take
[1:28:45] speaking of the Old Testament. It was an
[1:28:47] animal the sacrifice back then because
[1:28:50] he's speak preaching on the token.
[1:28:52] Therefore, the blood stood for a token
[1:28:55] that the life had been given. But in
[1:28:58] this glorious place under this covenant,
[1:29:01] there is a difference between the blood
[1:29:03] and the life. The token,
[1:29:07] the token for the believer today is the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the
[1:29:15] Holy Spirit of God.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; That is the token that God requires of
[1:29:20] the church today. God must see this
[1:29:23] token. He must see it in every one of
[1:29:27] us.
[1:29:28] And then in questions and answers
[1:29:32] he's saying speaking now now the first
[1:29:34] man and please just notice how we're
[1:29:36] making a distinction of the first man
[1:29:38] the inner man the new man and so on and
[1:29:41] the first man now he made the first man
[1:29:44] in his image and we're returning back to
[1:29:49] that image
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; now the first man.
[1:29:59] He made the first man in his image. And
[1:30:03] we're returning back to that image, to
[1:30:07] our first create created image. When God
[1:30:11] created me, William Brandham, I was be
[1:30:14] before the foundation of the world. He
[1:30:16] made my being, my spirit. I wasn't
[1:30:19] conscious of anything as far as I know
[1:30:21] of, but I was there. Jesus told the
[1:30:24] disciples that he knew them before the
[1:30:27] foundation of the world. And Paul said
[1:30:30] that he chose us in him before the world
[1:30:33] began. Is that right?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Now, there was some part of me, he
[1:30:41] continuing on in this same uh paragraph.
[1:30:44] There's some part of me, Orman Neville,
[1:30:46] that's brother Neville who was the
[1:30:47] pastor there. and the rest of you all
[1:30:50] here that's in Christ Jesus before the
[1:30:54] world ever began and he said and here's
[1:30:57] to my analysis of that I think that the
[1:31:01] people today that are possessed with the
[1:31:03] spirit or the spirit a part of these
[1:31:07] angelic beings spirits were rotated off
[1:31:11] of God that never fell in the beginning
[1:31:15] and resisted the devils the devils lie
[1:31:18] in heaven heaven.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; You know, there was a there was a a
[1:31:22] number of them that were deceived
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; and were deceived by Satan.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want to concentrate on those.
[1:31:28] I'm not going to be speaking about it.
[1:31:31] But there were some angels in heaven.
[1:31:33] Says, "Let thy will be done on earth as
[1:31:35] it was in heaven." Uh when when uh when
[1:31:39] Abel slew a lamb and put blood on an
[1:31:43] altar, that blood matched the blood that
[1:31:47] was on an altar in heaven before the
[1:31:49] foundation of the world. And that's why
[1:31:51] God had to have respect to it
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; because he was seeing a reflection on
[1:31:55] earth of something that was in heaven.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; We are here today
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; and there's going to be a people who
[1:32:02] Satan will never succeed in deceiving.
[1:32:05] And the prophet made it very simple. The
[1:32:08] bride cannot be deceived.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; And there has to be reflection on earth
[1:32:13] of something that's already in heaven.
[1:32:15] There were angelic beings that could not
[1:32:17] be deceived.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And Satan with all of his cunning, with
[1:32:21] all of his beauty, and almost equal to
[1:32:24] God except in creation. With all of his
[1:32:27] power, with all of his persuasion, there
[1:32:30] were some beings he could not convince
[1:32:32] to follow him.
[1:32:34] And it's re irrespective of what he has
[1:32:37] on earth or how sophisticated this
[1:32:40] civilization becomes. He will not be
[1:32:43] able to persuade some people. There will
[1:32:46] listen to me young people. There will
[1:32:47] still be young people if time goes on.
[1:32:50] There will be young people like you kids
[1:32:52] right here that will be in their teens
[1:32:54] and God will preserve them. They are the
[1:32:57] elect of God.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And it'll be impossible. I don't care
[1:33:03] what Satan brings on, how how attractive
[1:33:07] he makes it, he could not possibly make
[1:33:10] sports attractive enough to attract even
[1:33:13] a a really qualified, skilled person who
[1:33:16] physically in the outer body could
[1:33:19] perhaps get a gold medal. But the inner
[1:33:21] man will say, "I'm not interested in it.
[1:33:25] I'm interested in another gold.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the character of my
[1:33:30] master. Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; I cannot sell my body, the outer man,
[1:33:34] out for this because it it won't mean
[1:33:37] anything
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; and it's just for time.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; I want something that's eternal.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; There's gifted people who have such
[1:33:50] incredible mental skills, such retention
[1:33:54] of their mind, they could they could
[1:33:56] attain to incredible heights in the
[1:33:58] world of all the old men,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; the old body, the old man.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; But the inner man is calling out for
[1:34:07] something that's far greater than that.
[1:34:10] The apostle Paul who was so well-versed
[1:34:13] and well taught under the greatest of
[1:34:15] teachers Galiel he studied there and
[1:34:18] Jesus let him study under Galo when God
[1:34:22] in the flesh was walking on the same
[1:34:24] ground. They no doubt crossed their
[1:34:26] pathways in that small country of
[1:34:29] Palestine. But Paul became so educated,
[1:34:33] he had such a mind, he had to have that
[1:34:36] in order to turn the law of the Old
[1:34:38] Testament to grace in the New.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; But he said everything that he had
[1:34:43] learned. All of his intelligence, he
[1:34:46] counted it as dung that he might win
[1:34:49] Christ.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; One was the old man,
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; but the other was the new man.
[1:34:56] And God yet took that intelligence and
[1:34:58] used it
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; and for the writing of the New Testament
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; now God put man first in his image in
[1:35:23] his own image which was in an image of
[1:35:27] God. And God is a supernatural being.
[1:35:31] He was a supernatural man. And then he
[1:35:34] put him in five senses. And none of
[1:35:36] those five senses declare his heavenly
[1:35:38] home. Do I need to say that?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; And none of those five senses declare
[1:35:43] his heavenly home. Those five senses
[1:35:46] declare this earthly home. And God give
[1:35:49] him the five senses to contact his
[1:35:51] earthly home and not to contact God. But
[1:35:55] I can tell you that this triune being,
[1:35:58] God has given us senses to contact our
[1:36:01] heavenly home.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; God has given us senses to contact our
[1:36:08] heavenly family.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; We need to listen to it.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; We can just turn the lights up if you
[1:36:18] will, please.
[1:36:25] And these five senses control the human
[1:36:27] body but and two senses control the
[1:36:31] inside man. The inside man and that's
[1:36:35] faith and unbelief. And you possess one
[1:36:38] of you possess one of the one or the
[1:36:41] other tonight. He said, David said, "My
[1:36:47] soul followeth hard after thee.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Thy right hand upholdeth me."
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Who is that?
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; What part of that? What part of you?
[1:37:00] What part of David was actually what was
[1:37:03] happening in reality in his life when he
[1:37:07] said my soul followeth hard after thee
[1:37:11] and thy right hand upholdeth me. There
[1:37:14] is a part of us that we need to become
[1:37:18] more conscious of. There are people in
[1:37:20] the world and they speak of you know uh
[1:37:24] spiritualism
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; and there's a certain reality to it.
[1:37:28] There's and we have nothing to do.
[1:37:31] There's people there who are, you know,
[1:37:33] they're so conscious of and in the world
[1:37:35] there's whole movements. I think the new
[1:37:38] age movement perhaps, you know, reaches
[1:37:40] out and people are constantly trying to
[1:37:42] reach out and and it kind of gets into a
[1:37:44] fuzzy area because it's it's out there
[1:37:47] someplace. That happens to be people in
[1:37:50] the world who know there's a great
[1:37:53] beyond. And and that's why almost all
[1:37:55] religions have a heaven someplace. and
[1:37:58] have a better place and a greater power
[1:38:01] and all of these things. Friends, of all
[1:38:04] of the religions of the world, there's
[1:38:06] none.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; And if there is, I I'm putting you under
[1:38:11] responsibility to come and tell me,
[1:38:14] there's none that I know of. one day in
[1:38:17] fact is I'm going to especially for you
[1:38:19] young people and those of you who have
[1:38:21] not done it I'm going to put on a a
[1:38:24] portion of the healing lines and have
[1:38:26] this messenger go from one to the other
[1:38:29] to the other to the other and speak and
[1:38:32] declare the very secret of their heart
[1:38:35] even one I'm just listening to and and
[1:38:37] he spoke and told her why she was there
[1:38:40] and and he said you're not satisfied
[1:38:42] with that because that's not why you're
[1:38:45] really Here you have someone else on
[1:38:47] your heart. And then he got right down.
[1:38:50] Who is it that knows that?
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Who is it that knows the inside of the
[1:38:55] inside? And then as he hears or he hears
[1:38:59] the vocal cords of a man speaking and
[1:39:02] they begin to break down and go to
[1:39:04] pieces and begin to convulse with tears.
[1:39:07] They're not listening to somebody with a
[1:39:10] seventh grade education from Kentucky.
[1:39:12] They're hearing the voice of God.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; They become consciously, they become
[1:39:18] aware, instantly aware, someone is here
[1:39:21] that knows me.
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's why he said so often, I don't
[1:39:27] know you. You're a stranger. We're
[1:39:29] strangers. Raise your hand. What I'm
[1:39:31] trying to get across to you, I'm not
[1:39:33] going back 40, 50 years just to, you
[1:39:37] know, to give accolades to brother
[1:39:40] Brandon because of that. I want this
[1:39:42] congregation to realize that person that
[1:39:45] knew that man or that woman knows you
[1:39:48] sitting right where you are today. I'm
[1:39:51] not him and you're not that person. But
[1:39:54] that same God that stood between those
[1:39:58] people, that same pillar of fire brought
[1:40:01] this message.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That same pillar of fire vindicated this
[1:40:06] message. It was that same pillar of
[1:40:08] fire, that angel of the Lord, which is
[1:40:10] none other than the spirit of the Lord
[1:40:12] Jesus Christ himself. He's the one who
[1:40:14] called you. And I'm announcing to you,
[1:40:17] you have something in you that could
[1:40:18] hear it.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And you had and that inner man in you
[1:40:23] didn't only hear it, you knew what it
[1:40:25] said.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; And when he said repent, you repented.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; When he said this isn't the way, it's
[1:40:32] another way.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And some of us have heard a voice
[1:40:34] inside. We've heard something. Others
[1:40:37] have been maybe just strongly influenced
[1:40:39] and inclined. And there's a there's
[1:40:42] influences right here in this service at
[1:40:44] this moment.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I don't care what this service means to
[1:40:49] you. This prophet said the angels of God
[1:40:52] are here trying to influence you in an
[1:40:55] upward motion.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you giving
[1:40:59] yourself to it? Say, "Oh God, let the
[1:41:02] messengers of heaven,
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; let me be influenced
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; in a Godword direction.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Let everything that might hinder
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; be cast away from me.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Let me be moved.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Let us not be so earthly minded. Let us
[1:41:20] let us become heavenly minded."
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; And say, "We become so heavenly minded,
[1:41:24] we're no earthly good." I'd say, "Praise
[1:41:26] God for that." Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; I wish people would become so heavenly
[1:41:30] minded. There are no earthly good.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; He said there's two elements that make
[1:41:41] up the human being. And one of them is
[1:41:44] your mind. This is not the same quote I
[1:41:47] just read. And the other is your soul.
[1:41:50] And the mind is your mental thinking,
[1:41:53] your intellectual.
[1:41:55] And your soul, your soul is a part of
[1:42:00] God that's in you.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; This great eternal force,
[1:42:10] this one who fills all time and space.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; There's a part of that God, I want to
[1:42:16] say it would be my last words in life. A
[1:42:19] part of that God is in his children.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; It's in you. Are you his child?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; You have a part of that God
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; in you.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; That God that creates
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; heaven and earth.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; That God that heals,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; that God that defeats and casts out
[1:42:37] Satan,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; part of that God is in you.
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe that,
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; supernatural things happen right while
[1:42:49] you're in your seat,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; that God's greater.
[1:42:55] greater than cancer.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Cancer is just a toothache.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; To God, this is God.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; There's no devil.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; People say, "Devil's been on my case."
[1:43:06] That devil is nothing but a bluff.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; There's no devil.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; This is God. I'm talking about the
[1:43:13] almighty God.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; And we as his children ought to give
[1:43:17] thanks and praise God to our heavenly
[1:43:20] father. We're here in a sanctuary where
[1:43:24] we can give him praise.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; We have breath in our lungs and strength
[1:43:29] in our body. Say, "Praise God, oh my
[1:43:32] soul."
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:39] [Applause]
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "Now I'm focusing on
[1:43:44] the soul." He said, "Your soul, your
[1:43:47] soul is what directs you. It's what you
[1:43:50] are.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Your soul is what you really are.
[1:43:56] He said if you you've got a soul besides
[1:43:59] your senses, God never gave you these
[1:44:02] senses to trust him with. God gave you
[1:44:05] his spirit to trust. You will trust.
[1:44:09] Your senses is only a contact. Taste,
[1:44:12] feel, smell, hear, but to you yourself
[1:44:16] is that spirit that lives in you.
[1:44:19] Now, here's a highlighted.
[1:44:21] And when that's been regenerated,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; see, it had to be regenerated.
[1:44:27] And the old man died
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; and the new man born again.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That is a part of God.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And then you become a son of God,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; an offspring of the creator.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is AB stuff.
[1:44:43] I've heard this. I believed this for
[1:44:45] years." We need to focus on it.
[1:44:48] We need to practice. We need to
[1:44:49] strengthen that part of this triune
[1:44:52] being.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And then you become a son of God, an
[1:45:01] offspring of the creator.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And then you can believe the impossible
[1:45:08] things. Friends, this is where I'm
[1:45:10] trying trying to come to because while
[1:45:12] you're sitting here, we need impossible
[1:45:15] things to happen.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; You need it in your home. Your family
[1:45:21] needs it. People need it. We're in the
[1:45:23] end time. We need impossible things to
[1:45:26] happen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Sister Karen Ficken's brother Lyall is
[1:45:33] lying in the hospital very ill, very
[1:45:36] sick. We need the supernatural.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; We don't need another church service. We
[1:45:42] need our soul to make contact with God
[1:45:46] and believe for the impossible.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; If thou can't believe,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible.
[1:45:55] [Applause]
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; We're children of God.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Let's have it.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Let's have it.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Let's have the full benefit. Why walk
[1:46:06] down here with the old man when we can
[1:46:08] walk up in the heavenlies with the new
[1:46:10] man?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Why are we all encumbered and worry and
[1:46:18] are troubled about all of these things
[1:46:21] here? This is passing. This building
[1:46:23] will be gone one day. Your bodies, this
[1:46:26] old man, will be nothing but a mere
[1:46:28] teaspoon of ashes.
[1:46:30] But the creator if we go by the grave
[1:46:34] will utter his same thought,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; his same intent that he had in the
[1:46:40] beginning. Because God cannot change his
[1:46:42] mind and he will call those elements
[1:46:44] back into the thorn he intended.
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; God's mind cannot be changed.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; He thought of you before the foundation
[1:46:56] of the world. And that's the form you'll
[1:46:59] come in. Amen.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I feel beside myself. Friends,
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; you help me.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And when he's regenerated
[1:47:11] and the old man died and the new man is
[1:47:14] born again,
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; that is a part of God.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; You become a son of God, an offspring of
[1:47:21] the creator.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Those words are too wonderful for me.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; They're too wonderful for my eyes to
[1:47:27] look on. We become a part of the
[1:47:29] creator.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, these aren't diluted
[1:47:36] words.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; This isn't mumbling something uh just of
[1:47:41] religion.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated prophet of God quad
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; that has declared truth.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, the world the world and
[1:47:51] all of its frivolity, it's a stench.
[1:47:55] Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; It stinks in God's nostrils.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of God.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; For you are dead
[1:48:08] and your life is hid
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; with Christ in God.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; In souls that are in prison, he said,
[1:48:16] "Now, it wasn't that your body died in
[1:48:19] reference to the scripture. It wasn't
[1:48:21] that your body died. It it wasn't your
[1:48:25] spirit died. It was the nature of your
[1:48:29] spirit died. The nature which is the
[1:48:32] soul. The nature of your spirit died.
[1:48:36] And the nature of your soul is God.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; If you're born again,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; if it's not, it's of the world.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; We have a nature of the world. But our
[1:48:47] nature of that soul, the nature died and
[1:48:52] we're born again.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Now the scripture tells us, following
[1:48:57] along close, friends, please. I agonized
[1:49:01] trying to bring my mind and thoughts
[1:49:04] into subjection even into the weariness
[1:49:06] of the night that we might have I might
[1:49:10] be able to bring it to you as as as I
[1:49:12] was feeling it within myself. Jesus
[1:49:14] Christ, the second Adam, the Bible tells
[1:49:17] us he poured out his soul, poured out
[1:49:20] his soul
[1:49:23] into death.
[1:49:27] And being in agony
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; in the garden of Gethsemane,
[1:49:32] he prayed more earnestly,
[1:49:35] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[1:49:37] of blood falling down to the ground,
[1:49:41] almost like a precursor of the
[1:49:43] redemption of the earth, because his
[1:49:46] blood on Calvary fell to the earth and
[1:49:49] claimed that newly created blood of God,
[1:49:53] that blood cell that had never
[1:49:55] experienced sin. man that had come by a
[1:49:58] virgin birth. Sex knew nothing about
[1:50:00] this. He didn't come out of sexual
[1:50:03] desire. He came out of the bosom of the
[1:50:05] father.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; And God chose another virgin woman, a
[1:50:11] little woman that believed him. Eve
[1:50:14] displaced him by disbelieving. And he
[1:50:17] chose another one. Be blessed art thou
[1:50:21] uh because she was chosen. marry your
[1:50:24] chosen of God. And how will these things
[1:50:27] be? You'll be overshadowed by the Holy
[1:50:31] Spirit. And that which is in thee, that
[1:50:34] holy thing is will is conceived of the
[1:50:38] Holy Ghost. And she gave forth a son.
[1:50:41] And now that blood, which was God's
[1:50:44] blood by his word, for the prophet spoke
[1:50:47] it
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; that a virgin would conceive. And the
[1:50:51] power of that word brought that blood
[1:50:54] cell. Hallelujah. It had it had been in
[1:50:58] the mind of God, but it had to be
[1:50:59] spoken.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; The thought became a word. And the
[1:51:03] prophet spoke the word. And the and the
[1:51:06] prophet, our prophet said, and those
[1:51:08] prophets words attached themselves
[1:51:11] [Applause]
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; to the womb of Mary,
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; and she brought forth a son. And now
[1:51:18] he's dropping his blood upon the earth.
[1:51:21] Why? Because the blood is the is the was
[1:51:25] the token and the life. He poured out
[1:51:28] his soul because that is uh something
[1:51:31] that cannot be described or to be
[1:51:33] defined. He poured out his soul because
[1:51:37] it was the soul that died. He lost his
[1:51:41] nature. He lost his God nature. Are you
[1:51:44] following me? Adam lost the way.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; He lost his God nature.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; And now we can say according to Isaiah
[1:51:54] 53, Isaiah's prophecy, who who would
[1:51:57] believe our report and to whom is the
[1:51:59] arm of the Lord revealed? And he was
[1:52:02] wounded for our transgressions and
[1:52:03] bruised for our iniquities. And the
[1:52:06] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[1:52:08] And by his stripes we are healed. And he
[1:52:11] was he was with the rich and the just
[1:52:13] and his and the rich and the wicked in
[1:52:15] his death. But the Bible tells us he
[1:52:18] poured out his soul if he had not done
[1:52:20] that. In other words, he could say,
[1:52:22] "Children,
[1:52:24] the nature of the father is given back
[1:52:28] to you.
[1:52:40] I'm going to coast for a little while. I
[1:52:43] want it to soak in.
[1:52:49] The fierce a fierce struggle
[1:52:52] went on into the night.
[1:52:56] Some of you that write songs, maybe
[1:52:58] you'll get some inspiration here.
[1:53:02] A fierce struggle went on into the night
[1:53:06] in agony
[1:53:08] while great drops of blood fell to the
[1:53:10] ground. Jesus cried,
[1:53:14] "Oh my father, if it be possible, let
[1:53:16] this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not
[1:53:20] as I will, but as thou wilt."
[1:53:26] The Bible says he went a little further
[1:53:28] and he fell on his face and prayed
[1:53:31] saying, "Oh my father,
[1:53:34] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[1:53:36] from me. Nevertheless, not as I wilt,
[1:53:39] but as thou wilt." I can tell you
[1:53:42] friends.
[1:53:43] He didn't want to die or suffer what was
[1:53:46] hanging just before him.
[1:53:49] But without that,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; without the spilling of this sacrifice,
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; there'd be no way for us to have access.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; And we may have had access, all right,
[1:54:01] you've been born again, but to be a to
[1:54:03] be made aware of what it is that's in
[1:54:06] you.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; I had a rem I have a remarkable clip.
[1:54:12] I wanted to show it to you this morning,
[1:54:13] but I perhaps at another time. It is
[1:54:17] really it's in a series of DVDs that
[1:54:20] comes from the Wisen Tall Institute. For
[1:54:23] those of you that don't know Wisen Tall,
[1:54:25] Mr. Weisen Tall who recently passed away
[1:54:28] and I believe he was he received the
[1:54:30] highest honor that America gave could
[1:54:33] give by the president and he was called
[1:54:36] the Nazi hunter. He hunted down
[1:54:40] uh
[1:54:45] the great men who were responsible for
[1:54:48] the murders of tens of thousands of
[1:54:51] Jews.
[1:54:53] Who was the one in Israel? They just had
[1:54:56] gotten had to one of the most main one
[1:54:59] in Israel.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Pardon? Ikeman. Thank you, brother
[1:55:03] Ernie. Ikeman. He's captured several
[1:55:06] others and whisked them out of the
[1:55:09] country. Sometimes while it was known to
[1:55:12] the government and most times while it
[1:55:14] was not known
[1:55:16] but he wanted to show that there were
[1:55:18] other
[1:55:20] other effects of
[1:55:24] uh the Holocaust and the ongoing things
[1:55:26] and one of them was most unusual and
[1:55:29] it's called beautiful music.
[1:55:33] Excuse me and forgive me now. I just
[1:55:35] want to take time. Can I have a few
[1:55:37] minutes?
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And he tells of it just breaks into the
[1:55:44] family, a Dutch family, Christians that
[1:55:49] were doing missionary work over there
[1:55:52] and a person, I forget the person that
[1:55:54] came to them and asked them if they
[1:55:58] would take these two Palestinian
[1:56:01] children.
[1:56:03] So what he's tying together is here's
[1:56:05] people who have a love for Israel. The
[1:56:07] Dutch people are there to give their
[1:56:10] lives for the betterment of Israel,
[1:56:12] etc., etc. And yet they're being
[1:56:14] approached and asked if they will take
[1:56:16] these two Palestinian children. These
[1:56:18] children have been abandoned by their
[1:56:21] parents. I think the girl must have been
[1:56:24] like five or six or seven and the boy a
[1:56:26] little bit younger. And both of them
[1:56:29] were like demented children. And they
[1:56:32] were all twisted up. They had been
[1:56:34] malnourished and just everything. I
[1:56:37] can't describe them. It's hard to look
[1:56:39] at them because their faces are all
[1:56:41] twisted and contorted and they jerk and
[1:56:44] and impossible to communicate with. And
[1:56:48] they and they had a difficult time
[1:56:51] taking those two children and finally
[1:56:53] they felt that they should. So they took
[1:56:56] these children,
[1:56:58] had them in their home, and they show
[1:57:00] quite a bit about the children. You kids
[1:57:03] need to see it.
[1:57:06] Young people need to see it. You
[1:57:07] families, you need to see it.
[1:57:10] And and and and as they grew up, you
[1:57:14] know, they I can't describe them to you,
[1:57:16] but they're just twisted and contorted
[1:57:18] and jerk and their eyes and everything
[1:57:22] is you you can't communicate with them.
[1:57:25] And one day in the house
[1:57:29] there they they hear suddenly they hear
[1:57:32] symphony music
[1:57:34] and and Bach or one of the great uh one
[1:57:39] of the great uh composers is being
[1:57:42] played and and he he he and her have a
[1:57:46] conversation. They well somebody must
[1:57:48] have turned on the radio.
[1:57:51] And so they go into the next room and
[1:57:53] here's this girl
[1:57:55] who to their knowledge had never heard
[1:57:58] symphony music
[1:58:00] and she's playing flawlessly on the
[1:58:03] piano.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; This uh Bach or one of the great
[1:58:09] musicians
[1:58:11] and playing and they are in a state of
[1:58:16] shock. They can't even begin to
[1:58:18] comprehend where it's coming from.
[1:58:22] And I'm going to take a quantum leap now
[1:58:25] to the end of this girl's life. She
[1:58:27] becomes a teenager.
[1:58:30] And this family went and asked one of
[1:58:32] the leading Jewish piano teachers if she
[1:58:34] would teach this girl and she went
[1:58:37] through an enormous struggle and finally
[1:58:39] decided that she would take her on. And
[1:58:42] she taught her for quite some time. And
[1:58:45] then the mother, her mother who had
[1:58:48] adopted her or her adopted mother died
[1:58:51] of cancer and that was a great shock and
[1:58:54] she went down kind of into her into
[1:58:57] herself became reclusive etc. And then
[1:59:00] they had to have some you know
[1:59:03] encouragement and and this man remarried
[1:59:05] but didn't have the same attraction to
[1:59:08] this girl and she becomes a girl about
[1:59:10] 15 16
[1:59:12] and she needed to be able to be funded
[1:59:16] and so this teacher who is a Jewish
[1:59:19] woman had a put on a benefit and the
[1:59:23] wealthy and the rich and the known
[1:59:26] people of Israel came into a great iator
[1:59:30] and that girl played.
[1:59:33] Now my question to you friends is this.
[1:59:35] It was just because it was a very
[1:59:37] outstanding example. My question to you
[1:59:40] is this. Where was that?
[1:59:45] Where was that music?
[1:59:48] Where was where were those skills?
[1:59:52] Where was it? She isn't that she
[1:59:53] tinkered and played on it and that they
[1:59:55] had some indication. and had no clue. It
[2:00:00] just boom, there it is.
[2:00:03] And she plays in this great grand
[2:00:06] theater to the absolute amazement
[2:00:10] of musicians and the elite of Israel.
[2:00:14] This isn't ancient stuff. This is
[2:00:16] recent. And when I say recent, I'm
[2:00:19] talking about this generation.
[2:00:22] and and that girl I don't know the end
[2:00:25] of it but they call it beautiful music
[2:00:29] and she she and the people I couldn't do
[2:00:32] nothing but give her a standing ovation
[2:00:35] my question is where was that
[2:00:40] we have people
[2:00:43] and you you're seating you're seated
[2:00:45] here you're not that and I thank God you
[2:00:48] haven't had to overcome that but you
[2:00:51] have you have if I were uh if I were
[2:00:56] someone who was an instructor of of
[2:00:59] athletics and I enjoyed athletics when I
[2:01:02] was in my teens and did quite well at it
[2:01:05] at school and racing and jumping and
[2:01:08] this kind of thing. I I liked uh that
[2:01:10] kind of sports. Uh I loved music. I used
[2:01:15] to play several hours a day. My guitar
[2:01:18] had opportunities to, you know, maybe
[2:01:21] play with a group or whatever more, but
[2:01:23] there was something inside I had no
[2:01:25] desire. I had no desire whatsoever when
[2:01:29] it came to the gospel. And I'm coming to
[2:01:32] something that's very moving to me. I
[2:01:35] have never been able to understand
[2:01:38] why I have an insatiable desire. I have
[2:01:43] been so blessed by this message. I'm so
[2:01:47] glad I've seen what I've seen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; And for me to think, Brother Ernie,
[2:01:53] maybe there's someone else. Maybe I can
[2:01:55] get this into someone else's hands, a
[2:01:58] Chinese person or a Bosnian or a or a
[2:02:02] Polish or a Ukrainian or a Russian or a
[2:02:05] Vietnamese. And and that is why I just
[2:02:08] can't seem to do enough to to get it.
[2:02:10] It's with me in the morning. It's with
[2:02:12] me at night. It's with me when I preach.
[2:02:14] I just have such a joy. And why do I
[2:02:17] rejoice? It's not me. It's not the old
[2:02:19] man. But there's something inside,
[2:02:21] friends. And to me, that makes music for
[2:02:24] me. It's just music to be able to know
[2:02:27] someone else is hearing it. Someone else
[2:02:29] is getting it. Someone else is printing
[2:02:32] it. I just say, you may wonder what that
[2:02:34] means to me. I'd sooner hear that than
[2:02:36] hear Boach.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I'd sooner hear that than hear a
[2:02:39] symphony.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Someone's getting it.
[2:02:44] 100 messages went out. I don't I'm not
[2:02:47] rejoicing over a hundred or 2,000 or a
[2:02:49] billion. I don't rejoice over that. I
[2:02:51] rejoice over one.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; One got a hold of it
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; and they trembled and the word the word
[2:02:58] was so uh quickening to them. They had
[2:03:01] an earthquake inside.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; How do you have four scriptures being
[2:03:06] spoken by a man and the whole scripture
[2:03:09] comes alive? No wonder the woman ran
[2:03:12] into the city and come see a man that
[2:03:14] told me all I ever did. He never told
[2:03:17] all she ever did. He just said a few
[2:03:19] lines, but her whole life was exposed.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; We have a soul.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you that's
[2:03:27] rejoicing.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you says that's
[2:03:32] music to my ears.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; It's that God that's in you says this is
[2:03:37] the real life. This is true riches.
[2:03:43] Amen.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says who for the joy that was
[2:03:56] set before him.
[2:03:59] I wrote these lines
[2:04:02] and I was blessed.
[2:04:06] He was in agony
[2:04:09] praying father and the father heard him
[2:04:13] if it's possible
[2:04:15] let this cup pass from me
[2:04:18] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[2:04:20] done
[2:04:22] I don't know if he heard anything from
[2:04:24] the father
[2:04:28] perhaps the father said no it's not
[2:04:30] possible
[2:04:33] or perhaps the father was exactly ly as
[2:04:36] he is sometimes with us silent
[2:04:41] and we heard nothing.
[2:04:47] The sacrifice
[2:04:49] met the penalty
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; on the background battleground.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Nailing on the scarred and blood soaked
[2:05:00] earth.
[2:05:01] an earth that was groaning
[2:05:04] for the blood of just one more.
[2:05:10] The blood of redemption,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; the blood that can take us back to the
[2:05:16] original Eden.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; He must face the fierce judgment
[2:05:22] of a holy God alone.
[2:05:26] And that's why he said through the
[2:05:27] prophet, therefore I divide him a
[2:05:30] portion with the great
[2:05:33] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[2:05:35] strong because he hath poured out his
[2:05:38] soul unto death because he prayed played
[2:05:42] and paid the supreme sacrifice.
[2:05:45] It was the soul Adam this sin the soul
[2:05:49] that sinner that shall die. He'll be
[2:05:51] separated from God. And now it became
[2:05:54] united back. It became available.
[2:05:57] Friends, whatever you do, wherever you
[2:05:59] are, whoever you are out on the
[2:06:00] internet, don't be satisfied just to
[2:06:03] say, "Well, I've heard a message
[2:06:04] regarded prophet." It's more than that.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; He came.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; I've got a couple things I have to say
[2:06:11] to you. Do you mind if I keep you a few
[2:06:12] more minutes?
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; I I have to say something. You're going
[2:06:16] to think maybe I'm crazy, but this
[2:06:18] messenger had to come. People think well
[2:06:21] the first pull the second pull of sunset
[2:06:23] mountain this that and the other thing.
[2:06:24] It's not those things are fine but it's
[2:06:28] more than that. It's that a messenger
[2:06:30] came ordained of almighty God with a
[2:06:34] word proceeding out of his mouth that
[2:06:37] could connect you back and bring back
[2:06:39] the nature of God to your soul.
[2:06:47] I tell you friends, then the struggle of
[2:06:49] the world is over. I'm talking about God
[2:06:52] life.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about God nature.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a part of God.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; And you become a son of God birthed into
[2:07:01] the kingdom of God.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And you can never be lost.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as being lost.
[2:07:11] God will never lose a part of himself.
[2:07:14] No part of God is going to hell.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're the redeemed.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; And let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:29] [Applause]
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; I wish I could sing like you, brother
[2:07:37] Nathan.
[2:07:39] Brother Nathan heard. I don't know
[2:07:41] exactly where.
[2:07:42] Many years ago, the Lord gave me a song.
[2:07:46] Not much of a writer, but I have written
[2:07:48] a few songs.
[2:07:51] I wish I could sing,
[2:07:55] but the words are Terry here.
[2:08:00] Wait a while,
[2:08:03] watch and pray with me.
[2:08:07] My soul's exceeding sorrowful,
[2:08:11] burdened heavily.
[2:08:15] A dying world awaits my choice,
[2:08:19] longing
[2:08:21] to be free.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; So Terry here,
[2:08:26] wait a while,
[2:08:29] watch and pray with me.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; The verse I can't sing. And Jesus went
[2:08:36] to the garden,
[2:08:38] but he went not alone.
[2:08:41] He took with him another three.
[2:08:44] And when the weight of our sin
[2:08:49] begin to burden him there, it's not
[2:08:52] exactly the words. Then he asked these
[2:08:56] three,
[2:08:58] "Watch with me.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; Terry here.
[2:09:04] Wait a while.
[2:09:07] Watch and pray with me.
[2:09:11] My soul's exceeding
[2:09:14] sorrowful,
[2:09:16] burdened heavily.
[2:09:19] A dying world awaits my choice.
[2:09:24] Longing to be free.
[2:09:27] So tar here.
[2:09:30] Wait a while.
[2:09:32] watch and pray with me.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; And three of his dearest friends on
[2:09:38] earth
[2:09:40] were weary and tired and they fell
[2:09:42] asleep
[2:09:44] and missed that moment.
[2:09:53] I'm just going to come to my conclusion.
[2:09:55] Just going to say it.
[2:10:03] I think you would agree there's not
[2:10:04] going to be another messenger.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Then who's going to take us back
[2:10:17] to the original man?
[2:10:22] Who's going to take us back?
[2:10:26] Where's the voice? Where's the words?
[2:10:30] Who has, as I closed last Wednesday, who
[2:10:34] has the power of infallibility,
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; who stood before untold hundreds of
[2:10:42] thousands and even millions of people
[2:10:44] and said, "Is it true?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[2:10:49] Is it true?
[2:10:54] Is what I'm saying true? Is it true?
[2:10:57] Amen.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Asking hundreds of thousands of people,
[2:11:00] first pull, second pull. And now here we
[2:11:03] are, children of the third pole.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; He said to all those tens of thousands
[2:11:07] of people that were getting something
[2:11:09] for the physical man, the outer man, the
[2:11:11] body, "Is it true? Is it true? Is it
[2:11:13] true? Is it true?" They said, "Yes, it's
[2:11:17] true. It's true." They broke down. It's
[2:11:19] true. They trembled. It's true. Here we
[2:11:22] are, a congregation, children of the
[2:11:24] third Paul, and I say to you, is it
[2:11:26] true? Amen.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Is true.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; What he said is true.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Is the unfolding of the word true?
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Is Luke 17:30 true?
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; This is a serious question.
[2:11:40] We're all We're all in a dying state
[2:11:44] here.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Who's going to take you and I back
[2:11:48] to the original? He said the original.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; The original.
[2:11:55] And God made man in his own image. It
[2:11:57] was his own thought and his own intent.
[2:11:59] And now he calls you in this generation
[2:12:01] in the end time a world that is sinking
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; in sin and death and corruption and
[2:12:11] uncleanness and perversion of every kind
[2:12:14] in this hellhole
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; when hell has come to the earth.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Is this God capable of bringing out a
[2:12:21] holy people?
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; I say yay. He is indeed.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; And will he do so?
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; He will indeed.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; And by what power? By the power of the
[2:12:34] spoken word.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; This messenger was sent to take you back
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; to your original condition.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; He did not come to give you a better
[2:12:46] church style or to give you a better
[2:12:48] service or help you sing better or help
[2:12:51] preachers preach better. This word came
[2:12:54] and the truth is of it. It is here and
[2:12:57] it will speak to your soul and let you
[2:13:00] know I've come to receive you to myself.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That where I am.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; Where is he? Where I am, I can tell you
[2:13:12] he's in a place of perfection. Where I
[2:13:15] am, there you shall be also.
[2:13:21] And when he came, who was he in
[2:13:23] attendance with? He said, "The pillar of
[2:13:25] fire is here." That's the spirit of
[2:13:27] Christ is here. I'm speaking to you
[2:13:29] through the pillar of fire. Who do you
[2:13:31] think brought this message?
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; The son of man himself.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; He who could break the seals, he who
[2:13:41] could make the mysteries known is none
[2:13:43] other than Jesus Christ himself.
[2:13:47] Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; And he came
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; to get you.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Not that he's coming. He's here.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; He's arrived.
[2:13:57] [Applause]
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; To get you.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; To receive you.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; To himself.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. The message was to
[2:14:08] receive you.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; To receive you. It's
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just a book.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's not just some quote. Amen.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; That is his receiving of you
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; to himself,
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; the voice of the creator in these last
[2:14:25] days.
[2:14:26] And he says that's where
[2:14:30] that's the reason Jesus had to come
[2:14:32] through the woman to bring it back to
[2:14:35] the original beginning again
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; in marriage and divorce without sex
[2:14:42] desire.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's virgin born.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; But hallelujah,
[2:14:48] there will come a time where it won't be
[2:14:50] no more sex.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; But God shall call his children
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; from the dust of the earth
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; back like they was in the original.
[2:15:01] And friends, if we are going to link up
[2:15:03] with those the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:15:06] first. And we which are alive and remain
[2:15:09] shall be changed, you're going to be
[2:15:11] changed into the same form they are.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; And it is the Almighty
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; calling them. Even if it's a teaspoon of
[2:15:19] ashes,
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; hear me now, church.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, all who are on the internet orever
[2:15:25] will hear this service. Hear me. The
[2:15:28] voice of God in this messenger already
[2:15:32] spoke it.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And once it's said and it's
[2:15:36] gone out into the heavens and into the
[2:15:38] earth, God God didn't need a second
[2:15:41] Isaiah.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; He said it first
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; and a virgin shall conceived and a
[2:15:47] virgin had to conceive or God is not
[2:15:50] true.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; And the words of those prophets lasted
[2:15:54] 800 years and beyond. Yes, sir.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; And God had to speak it in this
[2:15:59] generation
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; to reaffirm it.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; It already was written here,
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; but he had to reaffirm it in our time
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; to declare now is that timel
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; friends. And I think this is the
[2:16:16] critical point.
[2:16:18] There's some that's going to catch a
[2:16:20] hold of that.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Some are going to say, "That's for me."
[2:16:24] Some are going to say, "I'm not going to
[2:16:26] miss that."
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe this girl could play this great
[2:16:29] piano music and all the symphony music.
[2:16:32] But there's something within me that
[2:16:34] cannot let that promise go.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; I am here and the power of God is here.
[2:16:41] The creator has spoken.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; What is it friends when a young man 27
[2:16:49] as I was sitting and listening to
[2:16:52] another man? Is it his vocal cords that
[2:16:55] just spoke four scriptures that I've
[2:16:58] heard many times? I'm asking you the
[2:17:01] question, what is it? I asked myself the
[2:17:03] question, what is it that dissolved a
[2:17:05] thousand questions in my mind, troubling
[2:17:08] things and people have sat even after
[2:17:12] the last service and the sister sitting
[2:17:15] here had questions and said, "I heard
[2:17:18] the service and all the questions were
[2:17:21] answered. Who is it? It's not Edis
[2:17:24] speaking then.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; It is God taking the words,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; God taking his scripture,
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; God taking his prophet's words
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; and speaking to your soul.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Your soul is a being.
[2:17:51] But God shall call his children from the
[2:17:53] dust of the earth back like they was
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; in the original. I'm not emphasizing on
[2:17:58] calling them from the dust of the earth.
[2:17:59] I'm calling them back to the original.
[2:18:01] Yes.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; Not through any woman, but through the
[2:18:05] molding uh but through the molding of
[2:18:08] the clay
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; and the cosmic lights and the petroleum.
[2:18:12] He'll create again
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; like he did Adam at the first time.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; He'll create again
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; like he did Adam at the first time.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; That was actually one of my key phrases.
[2:18:26] Hallelujah.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus made this possible by God making
[2:18:36] himself a man and came into the world so
[2:18:40] he could die through this woman. Now is
[2:18:44] the testing time of sin. Hallelujah. We
[2:18:48] may think it's the testing time of
[2:18:50] believers,
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; but I want to announce to you this is a
[2:18:53] testing time of sin. Sin's in a big
[2:18:56] struggle with the believer
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; and sin is rising hopelessly defeated.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Sin is defeated.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Joy bells are ringing.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, I don't I care
[2:19:12] not what our families are. We go through
[2:19:15] individually.
[2:19:16] Catch a hold of what I'm saying today.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; That part of you that's inside of you is
[2:19:21] your soul. Satan has no access to that
[2:19:24] soul.
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; He can make things difficult in the
[2:19:28] body. He can make things difficult in
[2:19:31] our emotional realm. Disregard it.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Pay him no attention.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Where's my example? Jesus Christ is your
[2:19:42] example.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; You think the prophet of God down here
[2:19:45] had it easy? He had more. He had more
[2:19:47] difficulties than all of us put
[2:19:49] together. And Jesus took the burden of
[2:19:52] the whole world.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; And when Satan came to him, he ignored
[2:19:56] him.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Somehow there's something in my soul
[2:20:04] today, friends, that speaks peace.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Speaks peace.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Speaks peace.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:20:18] weigh your future out
[2:20:21] and your plans
[2:20:23] in the light of this message
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; if you would. Let's bow our heads.
[2:20:32] Gracious Father,
[2:20:35] this is a marvelous moment,
[2:20:41] I lay my life before you, oh God.
[2:20:49] And as someone who has contacted me
[2:20:53] just very recently,
[2:20:56] someone who's been away a long time
[2:20:59] said, "I feel I need to dedicate my life
[2:21:03] to God again."
[2:21:05] Father, I trust and I believe that there
[2:21:07] are many here who perhaps feel the same
[2:21:10] way. we can't get.
[2:21:12] It's impossible for us to get too much
[2:21:16] or to feel as though we've gotten so
[2:21:17] close. We don't need to get closer. We
[2:21:19] want to get closer to you.
[2:21:22] I ask you to bless this people that have
[2:21:24] come. They have driven. They've crossed
[2:21:26] the borders. They've done all kinds of
[2:21:29] things. Lord, in this afternoon, we have
[2:21:30] a short period of time before the
[2:21:32] evening service. And this is not just a
[2:21:35] service, not church.
[2:21:38] We're people.
[2:21:40] Lord, how
[2:21:42] thankful I am that you have spoken to
[2:21:45] the hearts. Oh God, even from a young
[2:21:48] lad, 12, what you've chosen for him in
[2:21:52] his life, we know not. But we will we
[2:21:55] will be so happy and delighted to
[2:21:58] baptize him. Oh God, how your word has
[2:22:01] become quickened to our brother Jason,
[2:22:04] sister Sammy. Father, how remarkable are
[2:22:08] your ways. Oh God, you are speaking to
[2:22:11] our soul.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; And we say, "Yay, amen. I have heard."
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; And we want to obey. Do what you'd have
[2:22:19] us to do. Bless the people, Lord, in
[2:22:21] this congregation. In Jesus Christ's
[2:22:23] name, I ask it. Amen.
[2:22:31] Sister Reena Wit,
[2:22:34] just going to have you stand a moment.
[2:22:39] The congregation see this sister.
[2:22:44] She's in the middle of a mall,
[2:22:48] Bellispher Mall,
[2:22:54] to do something,
[2:22:56] some banking or whatever. She's just
[2:22:59] there. Her mind isn't that some glorious
[2:23:03] thing is going to happen.
[2:23:06] But this woman here, Sammy, you stand.
[2:23:11] She looks on that woman.
[2:23:16] Sister Sammy, God
[2:23:20] spoke to your soul.
[2:23:22] He knew exactly what you needed.
[2:23:26] And he said to you, "That's different.
[2:23:31] That's the way it should be."
[2:23:33] And this woman approached this woman
[2:23:37] and began to question her,
[2:23:41] "What what religion are you and where do
[2:23:43] you go and so on?"
[2:23:47] And she saw a long hair
[2:23:51] and a long dress
[2:23:54] and something anchored in her heart.
[2:23:57] That's the way it should be.
[2:23:59] The devil wasn't saying that to you.
[2:24:02] The world wasn't saying that. Hollywood
[2:24:04] wasn't saying that. Fashion wasn't
[2:24:06] saying that. Vogue magazine wasn't
[2:24:08] saying that.
[2:24:10] That's what I'm trying to get across
[2:24:11] this congregation. At some time in your
[2:24:14] life,
[2:24:16] the still small voice just said, "This
[2:24:18] is the way." And sister Reena, you'll
[2:24:21] have a great reward for having lived as
[2:24:25] a Christian sister ought to live in the
[2:24:28] light of this message as this sister and
[2:24:30] her husband, Brother Jason, will go to
[2:24:32] the tank this evening. God bless you
[2:24:35] both.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; You think I'm not a preacher. You don't
[2:24:43] have to be a preacher. Right.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Sister Sister Reena preached the message
[2:24:49] that brought her to the tank.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; And then we just broke down the message.
[2:24:55] We just spoke about what God did. Isn't
[2:24:58] this wonderful?
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; Is this glorious?
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; That's where the marvelous things are
[2:25:03] taking place.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Come, Brother Derek, and help me sing.
[2:25:09] Forgive me for being so long,
[2:25:13] but I'd like to sing My Sheep Hear My
[2:25:16] Voice. Would that be all right?
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand? Change our position.
[2:25:21] God bless you.
[2:25:25] Do you have something to think about
[2:25:26] this morning?
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:32] Amen.
[2:25:35] I know my voice
[2:25:40] and the path that I take. They follow
[2:25:45] wherever
[2:25:47] I go.
[2:25:50] My sheep go my voice and come at my
[2:25:58] stranger voice do they not know.
[2:26:04] My she
[2:26:07] my voice
[2:26:11] and
[2:26:14] my
[2:26:15] [Music]
[2:26:24] Oh
[2:26:26] my
[2:26:29] [Music]
[2:26:34] go
[2:26:40] my
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:26:49] for my sheep.
[2:26:52] Oh my voice.
[2:26:55] [Music]
[2:26:57] My sheep know my voice and the pastures
[2:27:02] are green where I lead them so often to
[2:27:07] feed.
[2:27:10] My sheep know my voice. And the cool
[2:27:14] sparkly stream where beside it still
[2:27:20] I
[2:27:23] I see
[2:27:26] my
[2:27:30] and
[2:27:33] my name
[2:27:39] in the
[2:27:43] go
[2:27:45] [Music]
[2:27:46] a
[2:27:49] [Music]
[2:27:52] Because
[2:27:55] I have made
[2:27:58] them my choice
[2:28:05] my
[2:28:07] [Music]
[2:28:09] sheep.
[2:28:11] Oh my voice.
[2:28:15] My sheep know my voice and the valley of
[2:28:21] death through which I shall lead them
[2:28:25] someday.
[2:28:28] But no danger nor harm can touch one of
[2:28:33] them. For I will be with them always.
[2:28:41] My she
[2:28:44] know my voice
[2:28:47] and
[2:28:50] my name.
[2:28:54] They abide
[2:28:56] in the home
[2:29:00] and go
[2:29:03] not afraid.
[2:29:06] They love
[2:29:09] me because
[2:29:12] I have made
[2:29:15] them my choice
[2:29:18] and they
[2:29:22] my
[2:29:25] oh my she
[2:29:27] [Music]
[2:29:29] my
[2:29:32] ask your brother Leon Leon if you'd come
[2:29:36] Please and pray a prayer
[2:29:40] in the message hearing recognizing and
[2:29:42] acting
[2:29:45] on page about eight or nine.
[2:29:48] Brother Brenham, he he uses the same
[2:29:50] phrase. He says, "My sheep know my
[2:29:52] voice." But it just it's kind of
[2:29:55] disjointed from what he's saying.
[2:29:58] But he's saying to us, if you read the
[2:30:00] paragraph, he's saying to us clearly,
[2:30:03] now listen. In the beginning, he made
[2:30:05] man.
[2:30:07] That's not this man that we're looking
[2:30:09] at today. Like brother Bram says, quite
[2:30:11] frankly, you've never seen me and I've
[2:30:14] never seen you. I'm wanting to get
[2:30:16] across to you today that your soul, your
[2:30:21] inner being, it's not some kind of cloud
[2:30:24] or fluff.
[2:30:26] It's a person. It's the real you
[2:30:30] that God spoke to. And he said, "The
[2:30:33] reason that he says it like this,
[2:30:35] something like this,
[2:30:38] the reason you have this capacity to
[2:30:41] hear is because you were elected."
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; My brother and my sister, I want to
[2:30:48] emphasize today, you're a different kind
[2:30:51] of being inside.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; You go out of these doors, there'll be
[2:30:56] very few that you'll encounter that are
[2:30:59] elected.
[2:31:01] You say, "Well, how do we know that
[2:31:02] we're elected? Isn't that some lofty
[2:31:04] thought?" I say this to you. You were
[2:31:09] elected to hear this message.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; I want to I want an evidence from you
[2:31:17] when you heard the message or at what
[2:31:20] point did you hear the message? But was
[2:31:23] there a point when you heard the message
[2:31:25] that you said, "This is God speaking to
[2:31:28] my soul?
[2:31:30] Let me see your hands.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; This is God speaking to my soul.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; If you haven't had that, that's what God
[2:31:40] wants to talk to you. If you haven't had
[2:31:43] that, that's what this message is all
[2:31:45] about today.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; To announce to you that God created you,
[2:31:51] this body your mother and father give
[2:31:53] you, but God gave you a spirit.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; And somehow you've been attracted to
[2:31:57] this message.
[2:32:00] And it's God's voice to your soul.
[2:32:04] That being that one that this message
[2:32:07] came, this message didn't come for your
[2:32:09] body. That is why
[2:32:12] that is why. Are you still with me?
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; That is why when that when brother
[2:32:17] Brandham moved from the first pull and
[2:32:19] and then when he was bringing the
[2:32:21] message, he said to the people, "Don't
[2:32:23] don't do that. Don't pull. I must give
[2:32:26] myself to the message." Why? The pull
[2:32:29] that the people were pulling on was for
[2:32:31] their bodies.
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not here for the old man.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; I'm here for the new man.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; This bro, this open word now is for the
[2:32:41] soul.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; God was focusing now saying to his
[2:32:45] messenger, give them the final words.
[2:32:48] Amen.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why at the very end of his
[2:32:51] ministry, he's saying to the people, we
[2:32:53] ought to be notified,
[2:32:56] &gt;&gt; of what our destination is.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he was speaking these
[2:33:00] messages, notifying you of what the
[2:33:03] destination is and getting ready for
[2:33:06] that destination.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:33:14] Ryan,
[2:33:16] do we know the words that I just want to
[2:33:19] shout? Hallelujah.
[2:33:23] Thank you, Jesus, for the love. Do we
[2:33:26] have the words to that?
[2:33:32] [Music]
[2:33:35] When I think about the Lord,
[2:33:41] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[2:33:46] he filled me with the Holy Ghost. How he
[2:33:52] healed me to the uttermost.
[2:33:57] When I think about the Lord,
[2:34:01] [Music]
