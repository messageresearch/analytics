TRANSCRIPT
========================================
King James Bible the Book of Genesis chapter 11 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech and it came to pass as they journeyed from the East that they found a plane in the land of shenar and they dwelt there and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for Mortar and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top May reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth and the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded and the Lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do go to let us go down and they confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth and they left off to build a city therefore is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did their confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the Earth we are told that the new system of this denomination of bringing this year World Council churches will bring peace to the Earth what a disregard what a nasty slam am in the face of Christ Lord what an irreverent sacriligious thing that is so the devil a man can organize something better than God can send him the Tower of Babel it's another babbling and musall peace on Earth a false Messiah an antichrist in his teaching amen how are you going to throw these denominations together when they won't even they even agree with one another now when they broke up in little systems like that how about all joining together and getting over there see it's a false setup it's all done to throw protestantism into romanism a false Antichrist teaching God's kingdom is not of this world Jesus said so my kingdom is not of this world but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets
