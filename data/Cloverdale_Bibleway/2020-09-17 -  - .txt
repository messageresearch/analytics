on to the house of the lord amen god bless you sister brother john's been asking me for a couple of days if i had a special and i had nothing because i really believe in my heart that when a person gets up to sing they should really feel it in their heart it should be something that speaks to them and something that is a cry of their heart and so i just can't get up and sing any song because it has to speak to me and today i was cleaning my house and i was listening to a southern gospel radio station and this song came on and i was like that's the song so brother ben is very gracious and learned it very quickly with me before service so you just pray for me it's a brand new song but it really spoke to my heart and i pray it'll speak to yours [Music] so we have gathered in your house and i confess that i'm so tired the burdens of this life are heavy on my mind but i don't mean to complain when these problems cloud my view for you deserve my highest praise so lord this is what i'll do i will lift my hands and worship you again i can't lift you high enough for all you have been [Music] hallelujah so i will lift my hands and worship you again [Music] you are wonderful and mighty of kings and lord of all when i magnify your name all my problems seemed so small so i will lay aside my pain and i will lift my hands to you for i know it makes you smile every time i worship you [Music] i will lift my hands and worship you again i can't lift you high enough [Music] [Applause] hallelujah so i will lift my hands and worship you again [Music] so i will lift my hands and worship you again [Music] [Applause] thank you sister natasha amen the lord is always pleased with worship amen our lives our voices are everything just to worship him so let's sing this song and maybe we can all stand together let the worshipers arise we want to invite brother michael to come and minister unto us [Music] father i see that you were drawing a line in the sand [Music] let your kingdom come

just praying for the service and lord i just said lord you've done so much for us lord you've done so much for me oh the least i can do is surrender my all to you tonight lord every day every moment

to you jesus christ's name amen amen happy to be here tonight good i'm happy too though i wish i was sitting though i don't get to do that much either but why don't you take your bibles thank you musicians we're going to turn right to the word tonight we've got a full evening that's wonderful sister abigail god bless you we're just and there's nothing more that should thrill us than somebody that says i'm committing it all to him i want to be baptized amen that's that's a glorious thing glorious thing we can be a part of that tonight amen amen let's turn to matthew 25. we're going to start at verse 1. help me tonight i need you to pull real hard i'm looking at you dan amen when's the night just food for the for the souls a little a little home time tonight so maybe we'll just pray that whether it's here i greet everybody at home in your little rooms in front of your monitors your screens go bless you we're listening for you we're listening for you amen let's read in the word tonight matthew 25 then the kingdom then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto the ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish and they that were they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish shed under the wise give us of your oil our lamps are gone out the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go rather to them that sell buy for yourselves and while they went out to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other version saying lord lord these are the foolish virgins came up said lord open to us and he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you're not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh amen you may have your seeds very known scripture who knows that scripture who's read the scripture everybody has read that scripture tonight right it's a very something we should be all familiar with the parable of the wise and foolish virgins and i just want to we'll focus on verse 13 in the amplified says therefore be on the alert be prepared and ready okay be prepared and ready for you do not know the day nor the hour when the son of man will come being prepared i just want to speak on that tonight i was titled a little uh message tonight prepared for life and being being prepared it's actually preparations a pretty vital aspect in in life you know being prepared it's actually vital for success in your you know academic life in your business life whichever preparation is key to uh you know to to success at the as i say and actually some say it actually proves to be maybe one of the most valuable skills that you can master and to avoid a lot of build up of well stress and anxiety and and such that comes you know you have a due date or a deadline you got something to be done and in adequate preparation just creates a whole lot of turmoil right you got you got a deadline to make and because you've left it off or you didn't prepare quite right now you're just backpedaling you're spinning you're you're running and gunning now you have no clue what's going to work what does work it's because you didn't prepare preparation is it isn't something that's built in is some have come it comes easier but thankfully you can actually build that skill okay you can build preparation it can be learned comes a little discipline a little discipline and it can improve over time you work on that preparing uh you know bit there if it comes more difficult to you so preparation is key and it's actually the difference between being proactive and reactive right so if you prepare if something happens or you can actually be proactive in the situation because you're you're already ready for it you've kind of already seen all the different scenarios and you're like well this happens i'm going to do that if this happens i got this in my back pocket and if that happens i'm going this direction because you've thought it through you've prepared right if you don't prepare you're just reacting problem fire problem fire and you're trying to put it out and you're reacting it's because lack of preparation preparation takes time a lot of time because you've got to actually set aside for maybe the the key task or tasks you got to do for that day and you got to take time out of your day to prepare some of them say actually at the end of a day some say at three o'clock in the day maybe just before you're going to bed you take some time and you think about the day tomorrow and he said what do i gotta done in that day what's my most important tasks in that day and you lay them out some say you put your three most imp three most important tasks and then the vital task and these are all this this isn't a business class but this is preparation take that take that home and you'll be winning all the way to the bank no pun there all right preparation so many things take prep a lot of preparation you know buildings building a building major preparation years years in the making my brother's part part of that in in building and and some of these these projects that they're doing are five six seven eight years in the making as they go from beginning to end and it takes a ton of planning i've had some some experience in the film side of things and the planning it takes to bring a film to pass is incredible there could be there's upwards up to sometimes seven years before it even hits a production because they're planning they're preparing so much of the work involved to try and get there in fact production when you're filming something that's the shortest time in a whole project it's the shortest part of getting the camera out there and filming something it's it's the narrowest wedge of time the planning is actually one of the biggest right it's the preparing so it's a major it's very important to prepare and even nature itself struggles and prepares just so they can live nature struggles and just so they can prepare we got if you there's a whole herd of elephants in in africa that that they all they're focused on is making their way these great migrations and all they're doing is trying to find water they're moving from place to place and they're they're just that's all they're focused on and they got instinct is telling them i got to go here i got to hear it and all they're doing a bear he hibernates he just fills up his belly with fish he's preparing for something just just to live that's all he's doing he's preparing to live right what about what about a human what about us that's what i want to talk about is where are we in our preparations because we're not just preparing to to fill our bellies with salmon and berries right we're actually preparing for something greater than that all right you know where people put a lot of preparedness in is disasters we've got disaster plans we've got medical evac plans fire prevention plans we've got plans because they're preparing for the worst disaster is going to strike and so we plan we prepare but in all these preparations in whatever aspect in life so many times though we just come up with a whole lot of excuses right many common common excuses and in lack of planning and lack of preparation in the world is well i don't have money and i can't afford to prepare because it takes some money to go and buy certain things and get prepared you know cleaners go out there and get their go kit ready and they've got all their equipment in there that's my go bag it's stashed away it's got all my first aid and some food and you know compass and knife and this i'm ready disaster strike there i'm a go bag it costs money to do that i don't have money so there's no go bag for me another reason i said well you know it's not my responsibility i should actually my mom and dad's responsibility i don't need to prepare or it's my boss's responsibility or somebody's responsibility and so they should take care of it i don't need to they prepare not me and therefore you are unprepared third and common one well it'll never happen to me right it's not gonna happen to me i don't need to prepare for that it's way out it's in the realm of absurdity that something so you know a disaster or whatever it could be might happen to them and so they put that off as it ain't it's just not happening and therefore i'm not preparing all right and as the old saying says as many would you know poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine who's heard that one oh now you have it's a very very common proverb record you've got i've heard that yes everybody knows that saying right i'll say it again because apparently none of you heard it poor planning on your part doesn't necessitate an emergency on mine meaning you're you're i don't need to be tapping to your tune because you didn't prepare right okay so preparing ben franklin says by failing to prepare you prepare to fail there you go now all right now you've got your short lesson on preparation all right the importance of it but you know so for the unprepared the world has put together the response systems as we're talking about disasters and they have these early warning systems because they need to they know there's thousands if not millions of unprepared there's no because of these three reasons here most people fall into them and therefore they don't do nothing and so we gotta figure out we gotta we gotta warn him somehow we have early warning systems now and so we have a few of those the common ones of course which yes uh just one second there can you just go to uh slide two actually there joe i put them out of order i apologize yep earthquakes right earthquakes happen and so we have early or you know early warning systems and that they try to trigger and try to give you heads up because you haven't prepared we're going to give you a heads up that earthquake is coming and so they've got some very finicky systems and you know they try and monitor with accelerometers and size size manometers and communication computers all these different alarms are trying to make sure you know what how can we make these people aware that disaster is going to strike all right so in 2019 there was a there was a ridgecrest i believe that was in uh california i can't quite remember there was two earthquakes on july 4th uh 6.4 and 5.7 and the company this isn't it but this is just an image just to stick it in your mind they had an app and they it's called quake alert and out it went and the average user had a warning earthquakes coming average they had 45 seconds to prepare how much preparation you got in 45 seconds not much so the best they got right now for an earthquake you got 45 seconds on average to get something in ready go to slide one there joe right tsunamis they happen too big disasters how do we prepare for them some prepare more than others different countries have them more than others some don't have them at all obviously they're landlocked nonetheless the you know countries like japan and such are you know they work very hard and so they have they try to get warning systems they got different things in the ocean and and uh buoys and all that try and trigger you know wave height as the water rose you know and trigger things off and so they try to it's sophisticated not sophisticated enough that they didn't give them a heads up because at the earthquake um in i believe is indonesia at 603 pm earthquake hit and the three waves of the tsunami hit the coast from 610 to 6 18 so they had about eight minutes seven eight nine that's all they had to get ready for the onslaught of the tsunami experts say actually that if you see the ocean receding you've got five minutes you better get moving to high ground it's not a lot of time it's not a lot of time because actually if anybody has ever seen the footage that wave just just keeps pushing in and it's going fast five minutes ain't getting you nowhere and we can go to slide three yep sure we'll hit play tornadoes powerful disasters i would just i just i had to put a clip together because when you're seeing the sights of these actually images i just like whoa typically you got less than 15 minutes when a tornado drops down and some they had really just a matter of minutes from when they got a little alert on their phone saying tornadoes just in your area that they had to get down below and that big cloud and cyclone dropped in and tore their house right off so it's a uh these are real people live in these moments this isn't just uh you know pretend you're these are these are real and they're trying to figure out how do we warn people how do we warn you that this is coming so that you can prepare right so this is natural life let's push that aside because it's temporal this is just temporal all right you're gonna have to give me some more amens than that all right but who's preparing for after this who's preparing for after this let's just go that's where we're going to go there right hard because that's really what's most important you can see you can see that the people are preparing for that they're putting their lifetime in how can they track that and they drive around and put their little sensors down and try and figure out how is it how do we monitor this and get all the scientific data just so they can maybe give somebody a few extra minutes so they can actually get out of their home right but god has an early warning system for us because we're talking eternity now okay and i sure hope we don't got just five minutes or five seconds not the case gone as an early warning system it's called a watchman it's called a prophet that he can stand on a tower and look far in advance so you go more than five minutes or eight seconds or whatever it is for a disaster to strike okay so a watchman but abram speaks the message watchmen what of the night because in a watchman if somebody is able to look far far in the distance and warn of an oncoming storm or an oncoming tragedy or such and so they were on a tower and they could see far often so they'd be able to announce to people the danger and pending dangers coming and so they would be able to have time to prepare for that get in the city shut the city gates get inside i also talked about a watchman being able to tell even the time you know what's the time he said there you know they should they knew the stars and stuff you could shut up you know what what hour what hour is it but how are we in is it morning time is it evening time what time is it in the night time they didn't have watchers like you and me right but i brandon says and today god still has eagles messengers men on the tower who climb up the spirit up in the spirit far beyond all mechanisms and all the atomic bombs and scientific researches he has men whose special design for that purpose who climbs up the ramparts at calvary in the name of the lord jesus stands on the top of the cross doesn't that stands on top of the cross he says and can send the message back thus saith the lord this is our early warning system god's got it built in from all the way from the beginning of time he's got a prophet that has been a warning system over and over to the people in ages gone by and today early warning system a prophet amen a watchman their spiritual sight far greater than the priests in the temple beyond the ordinary men and walks of life their special design for the duties that god had for them and they see afar off isaiah could see a far off he said a virgin so i can see because god gave them that ability amos saw far off and saw destruction coming moses saw far off and said there will be a prophet likened unto me there are prophets they're able to see afar off be ready for this right be ready see things that are coming he sees the cup of god's wrath full before it's filled i think we'd want to know if the cup is if when that right cup of wrath is going to be filled where is it well it's going to be at this time when you see this happen when you see these events when this takes place then that's the time oh i want to be ready for that time right so that's why we wanted to keep our eye on the watchmen of the tower and say watchmen what of the night where are we at is disaster right on us or how much time do i got where are we who's asked the watchman who's looked at and said watch him what is it who's gone in there and said where are we right now is the cup full do i have seconds do i have minutes the watchman can tell you he can tell you what's coming or not he can tell you the world be dark gross darkness he's high up enough the sun's shining now but he sees that shade coming and he says he's saying what's he's look he says what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here that's right he knows it's coming years away years away yet he sees it i just thought you know my what was spoken that was coming years away and there's many things i could go on here and i don't i'm not going to labor more on uh on some of these but i was just saying this you know brother branham saw so many things and if you read the message wow he's he's speaking about then but he's speaking them but he that's got to be now he's like that's now some of them are simple because um what is my next slide can you go back out i want to make sure i got these in order yeah let's do that one slide five okay this is simple we got we got children we got to bring this tangible for them but our brandon he had seven visions i'm not going to go into every single one of them but one of them was cars he spoke about cards he said just before that time come that automobiles this is where you can dig in and you roll into the message and find out the rest wow i didn't know about that you dig in there he says in israel in the church number two he says what uh automobiles which was built that old straight back 20 years ago he said he was talking about the when he had the uh divisions and i said i said to look like an egg okay he said to look like an egg so he's talking in cars down the road are gonna look like an egg at the end time okay that's what he said he says be something on the shape of something like that that's the way that'll be just before the rapture okay this is he's this is the these are the cars he's talking about then not so egg-shaped okay we're talking like boxy big time big sharp edges and you can imagine the audience is like like an egg do you see our cars right now right yeah i know you're living right now in in shape cars you can click next actually i could probably do that too right i had to put that up there because come on that's as how about i just took a picture of an egg i did not distort that one bit just so you know nothing i just whoop got bigger i mean it was so exact to the egg curvature i was like wow it does not get that does not get more accurate than that okay this is just just to give an idea this is the watchman in the small but also then in the great okay in all of the different areas but brother branham talks about you look at civil unrest and all the different things that are going on right now he speaks about that and he talks about it now coming down this day and age he talks about how it's used he said communism will come right in there this is what he says yeah he says that he says they do that they start a little revolution then they take then they take it in without a shot he says they don't want to blow the country up they want it they wormweeded in and they seen in a case of doing they said and now what the old revolution was they start just another revolution and they just filter that in this is only the watchman where are we at let's go to the next slide right music my goodness now what about all this carrying on and done he says in the name of the church practicing square dancing in the church bunco bengal parties teenagers rock and roll look at this elvis presley the devil standing in shoes now that's as strong as it gets pat boone ricky nelson biggest indictment to this nature ever had that's right i i had to look at them and be like wow this is the devil standing in shoes here at the bottom for those that don't know i think it's ricky nelson at the top and pat boone in the middle and and all these other ones you know louis armstrong and hank williams and you know ray charles you know patsy clan i don't even know these people but i'm looking at them like the devil this is what they were looking at as the watchmen of the night the prophet is saying this though i can't even put the second slide i i didn't even make one for music in this day because that indeed is the devil in shoes and i wasn't even comfortable showing the devil in shoes on the screen horrible demon possessed but this is what he was speaking to at that time he was talking about seeing far off right right he said oh my he talks about in the jungles and and elvis presley and then different ones bouncing and jerking around miles away in the in the in africa he says in them and he said and and yet they say oh he's very religious him and pat boone talking about elvis presley why it's the judas of the hour and you don't know it he's pretty strong but it was seeds seeds and he's looking far out on the tower amen next slide he's gonna drive this one home yup all right hollywood in the old in the days of the 50s right he says what's the matter today nation going into sin and whiskey joins people cold formal uncensored radio programs uncensored television programs so fascinating sin so beautiful until it attracts the attention of the people sorry translators i am flying and if you're not truly born again he says where their where their attraction is on christ and single-minded they'll go after that stuff this is where um and they'll act like those people he says it used to be the old pentecostal wouldn't let their children even go to picture shows and the devil pulled one over on their eyes and brought the picture show right in the house he brought these picture shows in the house this is what he's preaching hard against and i was looking at them and ren tin tin a little dog gun smoke you know some cowboys and you're like brother brad no no he's looking at now on your device on your little youtube and on your demon demon inspired content a prophet a watchman warning warning all right not just there but then we start talking and watchmen is also revealing the mysteries he's showing you serpent seed revealing godhead the church changes all this i'm just i just got something a little more that i could help the kids even see this is what your watchman is doing if he's showing you that and far down the road what more is he showing what more is he reaching to and saying look at this okay so now a warning there's a warning butter branham says oh he says it pays to take warning you can take that down there but joe the first thing you do before there can be a warning there has to be a preparation made for safety or there's no need of a warning if there's no way of escape if there's no if why am i even going to warn you if there's no if there if you're on a train trestle and there's a train coming and you're in the middle of it and the only way is that way or the train there's a train coming i mean yeah i am dead either way what's the point of the warning but if there was a way of escape then i would be shouting at you and trying to warn you to go that direction prepare you can get away from that right so if what's the point of the warning if there was no preparation made and you and the warning is only a voice of one having you to prepare for the danger there has to be a preparation made first amen preparation made first i'm thankful there's a preparation made amen that's what we're talking about tonight there's a preparation available he's warning judgment is coming but he's giving there's a way out amen there's a way out warning preparation then judgment let's just talk about a couple of those that can be real tangible for you noah warning said and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all the flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth and god said to noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i'll destroy them with the earth warning all right prepare make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms thou shalt make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits breadth of it 50 cubits height of its 30 cubits you'll make a window in it i in prayer phase and then you'd put a door and then there'll be a lower second and third stories thou shalt make it here's what you do here's how you prepare for the warning and noah had to go into action and start to prepare and he had years now he had to work he had to go get the gopher wood he had to go find that he'd start cutting it down he had to get his boys on board hey let's go boys we got a whole lot of work to do we got a big boat on our hands we got to get her done because judgment is coming warning and then judgment right and so here they go they start working hour after hour day after day service after service wednesday after wednesday right preparation was being made on the ark so that eight souls could be taken to safety god rich in mercy giving noah in his time that he everybody had it available to them this wasn't a secluded ark it was there big big and huge available i mean it just reeked of warning on it something major is happening but they didn't take it they didn't heed the warning they didn't heed the warning and then there was judgment in the 600th year of noah's life the second month 17 day of the month the same day where all the foundations fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven are opened and judgment struck in noah's day i don't look at noah like doom don't get old i was heavy oh no no god made a way of escape he gave a warning and he said here's what you got to do get to work do it this way do it that way well i think i'm going to cut it in half and not do it quite that no it wouldn't have worked god had a set plan for him make it three stories put one window up put a door here and i know i'm going to put like 40 doors it wouldn't have worked because it didn't go according to god's plan and it would have sunk noah had to prepare exactly the way god had it made for him to do and so he got to work doing that and he floated to safety and spared their life and a way of escape that to me is glorious don't look at noah like oh my goodness the world ended no eight souls were saved because they heeded the warning and prepared according to his word all right let's get that let that drill through our hearts tonight amen in exodus we'll talk about another one very these are very known these are all through the bible exodus 12 we know of the passover you know the day before passover is called the day of preparation they're preparing for it they've got a lot of things they've got to do they can't cook and so so forth there's certain things that are prepared so the day before is actually the day of preparation exodus 12 there was a warning god said the death angel is coming in and the firstborn is going to die all right now you must prepare and then there was a preparation now involved right and he gave him very specific parameters here's how you prepare for this death is coming now we must you can be saved from it here's how it works okay and he said you take a lamb without blemish male of the first year you take it from out of the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it until the 14th day it actually says you'll take it without blemish and i want to say it says on the 10th day of the month in the 10th day monday she'll take them every man a lamb so on day 10 of that month they took a lamb all right they had to select it they had to go out and do it okay you had to go do something they had to go out there okay son get out there go look at lamb they might have a big herd go look at this one yeah no they brought them in flipped them up look at them yeah this one looks great is he one year old they had to know this had to be one year old not two-year-old not six months it wouldn't work god wouldn't have accepted the sacrifice if it was six months old or to five years old one year old blemish is there a blemish on here look at all around the legs up around the firm fur cur you know trying to frantically look we need the right one that we need the right lamb for one year old no blemish a male we need to prepare and so here they are they're preparing they didn't keep it four days nothing could happen to it you didn't want to have that lamp pick it out it's all perfect and then it stubs his leg breaks it scratches it whatever it's not it's not it's a blemish lamb now so we had to keep it from day 10 because his fort on day 14 is when they needed to give sacrifice kill the lamb in evening time take the blood strike the posts roasted eat the flesh the pertinent parts all through the night nothing remained in the morning if so then it was burned they stayed up at night there was preparation involved so the death angel would not strike their home preparation we're talking preparing all right no leaven no leaven in the home nothing for the next seven days right what's 11 children what's 11 you gotta know tell me have no clue it's yeast it's like a yeast it's a raisin compound you know what it does leaven it's using doughs and batters it it's a it has a foaming action and it lightens and softens the mixture god has no desire to lighten and soften his word zippo it's this is what it is it's hard sometimes he wants it uncontaminated with the world no leaven and they had to make sure there was nothing in the home and anywhere else they went through every room every crook every cranny every shelf every basket you name it they went through it because there had to be nothing zippo for seven days no 11. why in 11 why seven days but abram says seven church ages the types are beautiful you see just read over that in the scripture like oh seven days you had no 11. oh that was pretty tough no no no because the type couldn't be broken right the scripture had to work all the way through front to back so that we could believe and say that's the truth he's the same yesterday today and forever the types and the shadows work beautifully all the way from the beginning to end amen seven days seven days seven ages no extra ideas no additional creeds no i think this this is how i think it is oh it's trinity oh it's this no no no nothing zero eleven zero man's concepts it had to be pure word amen because death was in the land amen death was in the land one small amount of the world not even a little bit it wasn't 99 one little dust particle it had to be swept out and you prepared exactly scripture says your glory is not good no you not that a little leaveneth 11 11 is the whole lump so purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us nothing not a bit of the world everything scoured completely swept out that's how your life must be nothing nothing well daddy why do you got your shoes on they got there at now at midnight it's night time death angel came at midnight this wasn't like i'm tired oh nobody was tired that night they were working they were preparing to make sure he said well daddy why do you got your shoes on why do your staff in your hand why have you got piece of bread in one hand and lamb in the other why are there bitter herbs and things what are you eating what's that sweat running off your face because it was a desperate time of preparation because the death angel was coming amen it was a vital time to make sure you had everything right you didn't want it left by chance but dad wanted it left by chance no wonder his sweat going off his brow he gird up his loins he had a staff in his hand he was ready to go he's eating the bitter herbs he's eaten everything some of it's hard some of it's good but he had to eat it all the pertinent parts right sometimes sometimes services are a little bit this it's the hard parts too other times it's glory it's amazing you have to eat it all it's all word right you're girded up and ready to go you weren't leaving it to chance because if it was just left a chance and you did get a year and a half year old guess who was dying at midnight your firstborn was it serious it was serious procrastination would have been a horrible thing then well i'll just let it go you know you know day 10 you know i can do all that on day 13. no that would have been a bad end you want to procrastinate and leave it off no sir no sir scripture says now again he said wow passover is a heavy story it is a heavy account but i want you to focus on there was a way out there was preparation a warning that allowed preparation so that life could be preserved focus on that life could be preserved there was a preparation for life okay to get away from the death that was coming on the land you can prepare and live and you can do nothing and die let's focus on live because there's a way now a lot of times through these preparing times uh we can it there's can be a long period of time here we talked about disasters and you know a few minutes of time between warning and then and then and then destruction but sometimes it's a lot longer than that so much so the scripture says ii peter 3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming yeah we've been at this a long time for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation yeah i've heard this 40 000 times that's what they're saying rapture yeah i don't know where's the promise of his coming yeah it's scripture i can tell you it's happened to this day absolutely willingly they were ignorant that by the word of god the heavens were were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was that then was being overflowed with water and they perished god wants to know if it's really sticking no you're in it for the long haul not for the short haul all right and so he looked like he even put noah through all that preparation time and then he put him in the ark and then he sat there and waited hey the rain's coming the door's shut the animal's ready we're ready to go it's been a long time a whole lot of years and i'm ready to go i'm waiting to hear the thunder and day one happens then there's no thunder and he's two days done and three days and four days that's a long time and you i'm sure you got a whole lot of mockery going on the outside right he left it for seven days before that thunder started and then the rain fell right scripture says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie hold fast scripture is scripture it will not fail though it terry wait for it because it'll surely come it will not terry don't falter in this gap time hold fast you've prepared many of you you've prepared i'm not talking i'm talking to believers tonight hey man hold fast because though it terry wait for it who cares about this scoffer who cares about the mocker and you guys have believed that for years it will come to pass and i sure want to be the one that's inside the ark after day seven when it started to thunder and then someone outside was like oh man we made a mistake and there was no way out preparation was done we want to be in the ark that's why we're here that's why the watchmen came because he could shout out a message and say get in the ark get in christ this is where the word is get there amen that's what we're preaching tonight man you need to know who you are know how to know who he was when he had to do that and so did many of god's men we mentioned the different prophets they didn't know who they were right brother dan they didn't know who they were when they're speaking amos getting out there isaiah getting out there hosea doing god told jose to do some pretty intense things read hosea you got to know where you stand and then you can there and wait because the vision will manifest amen those that got tired they didn't listen to jesus jesus said when you see certain certain things happen when you see jerusalem compass with armies and know that the desolation there was nigh flee to the mountains he says for the days of vengeance are coming woe into them with child that gives suck in those days and great shall be the distress he told them watch for this he told them get out of jerusalem when you see this happen and those that heeded the warning and were watching and prepared yeah yup yup i see it happening we're gone they had stuff where they had gold bags they were ready to go 37 years later is when that happened to make sure that gold bag was ready to go when they had to tear out of the city because their roman was coming in and you know what they say more than 1.1 million jews perished 100 000 taken captive they said though yet while the jews suffered starvation and slaughter and capture their fellow christians in jerusalem escaped amen they prepared for life they were prepared oh you say i don't want to be here well that's why we're here you know god doesn't put you through a rigorous set of you've got to do this do this this this and you know what after 10 or 15 years then i'll see if you've passed the past my preparation test no no they were pricked in their heart when peter spoke to them and they said what must we do what must we do to be saved i don't want to be here there's an oncoming storm there's destruction coming i gotta i want to be ready i need to prepare what do i do what do i do well he said repent be baptized amen and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen it would that's it wasn't it's not super simple that's why that's why god hates the catholic doctrine and all of the dogmas that put prices on it and you have to do this whip yourself whip yourself pray this many times light this many candles because it's a free gift he says all you got to do is repent turn around be baptized in the name of jesus christ in my name on my name his name that's what you are i was just thinking today how incredible in vain do they worship me i was thinking because how do you worship him brother brown says in his provided place of worship which is in jesus christ and if they're believing eternity doctrine and following and baptizing the father son of holy ghost how are you worshiping him how do you worship him when you're worshiping in titles it's in his name that you worship him amen that's why you're baptized in his name by one spirit him are we baptized into and therefore then now you have the seal amen that's why that godhead is so important millions and millions of people that believe they believe and are worshiping not in god's provided place of worship can you imagine all your worship is in vain because you're not even worshiping in his name in the name of our lord jesus my when that comes no when that seal when god recognizes as abraham did he separated himself he showed his faith and god then circumcised a covenant of circumcision and then and when god sees that you step in you make a consecration you turn around you separate yourself you you surrender it all you lay it down you don't hold nothing back god sees that and he pours the holy ghost into your life boy what a change happens amen you're renewed in your nature you're completely changed this is what this this is what he does he changes you your old man is dead it's dead your desires are gone your worldly passions are gone because he died out and he now lives and reigns supreme in you he's washed you from your sins you're blameless he sees you washed completely pure amen spotless the blood of the lamb makes you perfect in his eyes perfect justified by his righteousness your filthy rags your righteousness are covered in his blood and he sees his righteousness which is pure white and says snow way man you're reconciled to god made to be just like him because you're part of him you've been torn he was tore at calvary you're the other part of him he's part join the ghettos bride and groom you make that covenant perfect match because he's a part of you that's what happens when the god pours his spirit in you amen and your lamp your vessel is fed with heavenly oil which is the holy spirit amen now let's talk about our scripture holy oil holy spirit that oil vital for preparation what do i need what do i need we got an oncoming storm as i said we've got destruction coming to this world we've just been talking to ourselves at home and different ones reading in revelation this abigail and the kids our abigail and inside we're just reading a little bit of the sixth seal boy oh boy oh boy you don't want to be here you don't want to be here storm storm but there's a way there's a prepare preparation that can be made so that you don't even need to be here amen and that's why you're here what are you preparing for are you preparing for judgment or are you preparing for life what are you preparing for you have a choice you can do it right now what am i what am i doing what's my focus right now what am i doing in life is my am i preparing everything i know there's something coming i know the watchman has said this well i don't have time or it's cost too much not money but it costs too much of you too much of your own self you've got to lie down everything in fact not just some everything ah just too much don't fall in to the vast majority that do not go unprepared prepare amen five of them were wise five were foolish they were foolish took their lamps took no oil took no oil the vital component to preparation but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps and while the bridegroom tarried he lingered while he lingered and tarried they slumbered and slept but abraham says all through the ages first stage second age third age he says and then those virgins rose oh sorry and at midnight a cry was made behold the bridegroom cometh brother brown says at the seventh watch in that last age he says that cry was made out at midnight at christ made the bridegroom cometh where are we we're at the end of the seventh age and the watchmen has shouted out here's what's coming behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and then those virgins rose and they trimmed their lamps they trimmed their lamps they were lamp trimming you know if you don't trim a wick it gets all smoky and charred up and your wick and your flame is minuscule in fact you blow off smoke you char up the lamp and eventually if you leave it it goes out and there's nothing happening on your on your little wick and you need that you need flame so they went out and trimmed their lamp they trimmed out you know what what have i got they started any little thing of preparation i got to make sure my wick is just looking good you actually trim a wick in a certain way you know not to cut right across the top no you want your flame to be bright and tall and as as powerful as you can in your little lamp and so they trim that lamp they got rid of anything is there a little bit of the world on me anything that's hindering my my flame from burning bright and so let's just trim that off a little bit something came across the pulpit on the surface i heard so i read something in the scripture that says trim that little lamp that little wick a little bit and you make that lamp just burn bright amen that's what the trim of the lamp is amen so they rose up the foolers said under the wise oh give us of your oil our lamps are gone out this is major this was major our lamps are gone out my goodness lebron says the first thing when he starts descending out of heaven he says there's a shout what is that it's a message to get the people together a message comes forth now lamp trimming time which we just talked about rise and trim your lamps what watch was that he said seventh which we just said behold the bridegroom cometh he said it's malachi 4 time it's luke 17 time all those prophecies that can perfectly set in order and this day in the scripture we see it living right there this is where we're at so where are we right here we're at the end ready those last prophecies being fulfilled and now the foolish virgins they say whoa we're out of oil and the y said not so not so lest there not be enough for us and you but go rather and go over that and go to them that sell them by yourselves i can't give you the holy ghost i can't this is i i got just enough for me i'm trying to live my life i'm trying to keep keep my lamp burning bright keep my family in order uh-huh oh you got to go to the source i can't give you my oil you go to the source of the oil nobody would want to wake up and find out that the only requirement that they needed when the bridegroom came was the oil and they didn't have it and when they went to buy they weren't already and the wise virgins went with him to the marriage and the door was shut preparation can be made right now right now say lord i don't got oil in my lamp i need oil in this lamp because when the bridegroom cometh i want to be able to rise up and meet him and go inside that door into the marriage supper and it close behind me and no it's all over it's all done we're talking in the office of just that what just seeing one of those resurrected saints i tell you that'll change everything you want to have oil at that time because i can assure you if you don't got oil by that time you've got a problem you want to make sure your lamp is trimmed and ready and burning but our brown says god raise up some preachers that'll go to trim and lamps i said lord i'll do that tonight i'll go out there and preach get ready warning and judgment but there is a place that you can prepare there's been a plan given this is what you must do and then you will be ready for the oncoming judgment i urge you tonight here there what are you preparing for as i asked i'm preparing as i've said over and over again i'm preparing i'm preparing to live i'm preparing to live this whole world is not my home i'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue they're all expecting me on heaven's open door sure because i can't feel at home in this world anymore i'll tell you you better not be feeling at home here because it is disaster disaster people are going insane just in our own little town train trains are wrecking and fires are burning and whatever else that happened pandemics happening something else happened on on monday that was catastrophic oh cable getting cut at our at the gondola it's crazy out there people must just be they're they're freaking out ah but i'm prepared to be out of here amen that's where we're gonna go right now okay hey man we got just a few more minutes butter bram says ah gotta skip it sorry my goodness at the beginning you thought well i just never have i have too much time and then you're like oh my goodness i got not enough time how things change well you know i just want to come to the end just a little bit at close here because we can talk a lot about the warning and the preparing and the the negative side of it or not i shouldn't say negative but the sobering side of it it is sobering because we're striving to ensure that you all make it we want to make sure that everybody because it's free it's god's but he didn't it's like well you know not for you but for you no no everybody god would that all would repent that's scripture but with preparation with preparation comes great peace preparation brings peace and i just want to just just touch on that touch on that just a little bit here because when all is ready and it don't matter it don't matter how crazy it is you can just rest because you've come into peace the storm could rage your anchor set and it's just i'm good he's in my life my oh my lamp is filled and i'm just i'm just going to coast those waves and man scripture says now i want to talk to this this is actually let's read ephesians 6 14 stand therefore we're talking about battle now ephesians 6 armor stand therefore having your loins gird about you with truth having the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation the readiness the preparedness of the gospel of peace this is part of your armor it's part of your armor your feet are shod you know i would hate to walk around without no shoes uh i'm a shoe guy in fact i'm a sock guy i hate bare feet hate it with passion i i can absolutely relate with this scripture 100 because little i did detest walking in bare feet i can't imagine battling in bare feet imagine your feet would just be a lump of mush because it had been stepped on and rocks and this and that and and poked and brambles and slip and slide in mud i was thinking about this i was thinking of brother dave we were fishing and he was in some certain boots and we were in mud and oh my goodness he was it was like he was skiing through the mud because his shoes weren't fit for the terrain it was quite comical but nonetheless your feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace shod preparation because when you have your feet your feet actually when they were in battle then they had their little sandals whatever they actually had little little studs and stuff on the bottom so that you could be there you're ready you weren't all over and someone comes to battle you no you actually had these little studs in your in their shoes so that you were ready you were prepared if satan came this way or this way you could move if he's here you can move you're not slipping all over and down and gone or maybe he's like i got no shoes i don't want to move and so you're stuck in place no your feet were shod with the preparation so you could be ready for the onslaught of the enemy no shoes you're toast it's not you can have your sword in shield and all that you're going to wage battle for a little while but if you don't got complete armor and god put into scripture your feet have something on them he actually shot it with the preparation of the gospel of peace it's to be prepared having your feet shot the gospel is the peace with god that comes through being reconciled to him through jesus christ that's what you're prepared with you're like i'm ready i'm planted i'm anchored you know exactly which way the devil's coming and so therefore you're content and at rest because christ lives rules and reigns and i i'm anchored in him and each win no matter which way he comes that's what's grounding me is my feet are ready and prepared with the gospel of peace and then it's just rest little bride fight away all you want devil but i'm ready i've got i've got my weapons but don't don't disregard the fact that your feet actually give you peace in the battle because that's what you're shot with peace you're prepared he gave that for your preparation it's a peace that passes all understanding because in him because you're in him and you look around you like i said you have those they're not they don't have christ their hearts are failing for fear as scripture says but you when you're shod with that when christ is in you and you've accepted his propitiation you should be at complete peace and rest in this time you're prepared you're prepared you're anchored in jesus amen in the cleft of the rock let's close with this brother branham about her dao i believe it was if i'm reading the right quote he says um you know brother brown he goes you know do you think i'm ready you know i think i'm ready to go because you know do you think i'm you think i'm saved he says brother brown says well let's have a heart exam he goes let's just let's just think about this he was in a heart exam with you you know i'd put your blood pressure put the cuff on you and we'd take your pulse and we'd take your respirations and all of that and we'd see how good you are you know how are you how you feeling he says that's what they do in a medical realm he says well as he goes let's do a soul examination so what he says he says let's do a soul examination because we only only has for the soul god has only one instrument he says that's his word it says john 5 24 he says he that hears my word now he says now that here doesn't mean just listen is that here means to receive he that heareth or receives my word who can receive my word he hears it amen he that hears my word uh-huh that's the word of jesus there you are if you can hear my word and believe on him that sent me he has passed from death unto life and he shall not come into the judgment but is passed from it and now he said how's your heart beating now and he says wow he says i believe it i've heard it and i've received it amen this is better dow's response he says well then according to the head specialist and the chief operator and the chief doctor he says of eternal life you pass from death unto life and shall never come into condemnation glory amen you do a checkup do a soul checkup you say you know what have i have i believed have i heard have i received it i believed i've heard it i've received it he says well then the chief doctor says you've passed from death unto life my that was simple it's not complicated it's a simple thing to prepare for this he says oh he says wow he says when i heard you preach in the name of jesus christ for water baptism i walk right in behind you and you baptize me that man i once was i'm not no more something happened to me i used to care nothing about it and went on the other way but i've turned and started back this way and my heart burns day and night to get closer to him here's a little evidence that something real happened my heart burns to get closer to him i started i was going this way man i'm going this way now there was a change that's how you know that little lamp of yours has got filled up with some oil and your flame starts to burn amen you are prepared every word of it i believe amen to every bit of it i don't care if it cuts me i want to measure right up oh my there it is right there's a soul examination and you see if you pass the test i want to measure right up to it he said i said brother branham said seems to me like your heart's beating pretty good how's your heart beating tonight is it beating pretty good he said man that's exactly me brother dao and my heart my spiritual heart is just a pumping just in good and fast hopefully not too fast he said well i wonder if there brother brown would be a rapture if the rapture comes can i go in it i said well i can't say he says well i'd like to be living i want to see the rapture so bad but her dad was an older man and i said well let's see what the science book says he says amen he says well ii thessalonians chapter 4 he says we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent which means hinder those that are resting asleep for the trumpet of god shall sound and those who are asleep or resting shall wake up first take on immortality and then we which are alive at that day at that time after they done raised up see they shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and meet them amen and then go up to meet the lord in the air and be caught up together with them whether you sleep whether you don't whether you do whether you don't whatever you're buried if you don't bury it at all you're coming anyhow brother dao and it don't matter you're going to be there if you've prepared you know whether you die whether you live whether you're there not there here when that happens you'll be there he said there's nothing can hold you you'll be there brother dao my goodness he said if jesus don't come until my great great great great grandchildren's grandchildren you'll still be there right on a moment just exactly and will be there before they're ever even changed hey man give me oil in my lamp keep me burning amen musicians you can come give me oil in my lamp amen a christian doesn't prepare for destruction he doesn't hunker down and he's not waiting for impending doom oh sir no sir but he's prepared to live not here but in eternity amen the gospel of peace are our preparation amen he said i've passed from death unto life i pray that just struck something watchmen what of the night well the scripture says the morning cometh in the night also if you listen read the scripture so what can i do have i made preparation if you have we're going to be able to sing this song together because when you have made preparation you can sing it as well it is well with my soul that first verse when peace like a river you can only have peace like a river

gideon the whole family is here tonight um the lord has been dealing with sister abigail for a long time we were speaking with the brothers even before winter camp sister abigail brother michael and i talked about this and brother daniel about how we had saw the lord back in february dealing in your heart and then in march we seen the lord continue to deal with sister abigail's life and then in march when the borders were shut down and throughout all these months when we've we've kind of had to been afar but we've observed the holy spirit just kept dealing with abigail we'd see her in the services and see her responding to the lord jesus and then just last week when bca started the school started and there was a fam uh family assembly the students were gathering sister abigail's is there lifting her hands worshipping the lord i could say the holy spirit is still on sister abigail last wednesday service um as the people were leaving and things and we were just in the back waiting uh sister abigail's brother left and her mother left and abigail came to the altar all by herself all by herself abigail the lord saw that sister abigail amen and we got the text the next day and we're so happy to be with her last friday to know that sister abigail's desiring baptism isn't this wonderful tonight when i was thinking of sister abigail about your baptism tonight 3rd john chapter 1 verse 4 says i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth and the very name of abigail means the father's joy and brother alex was just giving us a testimony when uh sister walkina was expecting sister abigail the ultrasound they were putting the ultrasound on sister walkina and the baby was just jumping and so happy there and there was something in brother alex and sister joaquin's heart this child is going to be one of joy and to know that john said in the bible i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth it's not just an event tonight that's just on a wednesday night it's the holy spirit that is blessing sister abigail and her family for all these years and to see that her walking in truth now sister abigail i went back to the old testament first samuel chapter 25 to the abigail in the scripture the bible says abigail was a woman of good understanding and of beautiful countenance and abigail acted in a good character even though she was married to a husband a neighbor who he was cheerless in his nature he was evil and hard and cruel she was married to a husband that was difficult and intense and stubborn and stiff-necked but abigail had good understanding she had good prudence she had insight this is the character of abigail in the scripture she had good sense and wise and gave attention to give peace she was always one of harmony and did not want to cause trouble but when mabel died immediately david took abigail to be his wife because of her good character and i just want you to notice this because it has to do with the time we're living in now that she became david's wife in a season of time that was very difficult some would say it was a bad time for david because he was extreme experiencing a difficult struggle he was like being a refugee like a fugitive he was wondering uh throughout a wilderness time of his life and so bringing it to now tonight for abigail in the scripture abigail's presence and her testimony in her life which is what we heard about tonight in the scripture abigail brought pleasure and joy and satisfaction before david even got to the throne abigail was someone that brought joy to david's heart and even in his desert experience the only thing david had to offer abigail was a promise and an anointing that one day one day it's all going to be different we're going to sit on the throne and right up till today 2020 today this abigail has received the promise of god and she's been born under the anointing of this message she's been called to bring joy to the soon-coming king in this difficult time and even in the time of global pandemic when the holy spirit seems to be like a fugitive in the world it's very scarce he's coming to his throne this is when this abigail is going to bring joy to the heart of god we are literally seeing a miracle tonight of a young lady that has a desire for god and last wednesday night when sister abigail i don't know if you saw it sister joanne all alone walked to this altar she didn't need the crowd she'd move beyond just the mother just be on the school teacher just beyond the father just beyond just ministry all being around and she came alone that was her moment when great joy bursted out in heaven and may tonight's service be a smile of approval even for our assembly the in the time of fugitive and it seems like david is on his way to the throne here in abigail the joy the joy of the father is being joined to jesus christ isn't that a wonderful thing as we pray with her tonight may this abigail's life bring pleasure and bring fulfillment to christ on the way to his throne amen hallelujah it brings us great joy tonight sister abigail amen let's all bow our heads together oh father our great king our great christ that has come in this day wooing hearts wooing lives bringing your predestinated sea to their place here we stand in the water tonight with sister abigail that for all these years she's been in the assembly she's been in a wonderful family she's been at the church school she's been to the camps but we've seen the holy spirit just wowing just cooing around abigail's life we we've had a witness even from afar even in the last months that your holy spirit has never given up on sister abigail her heart has stayed soft and tender and even in these last days lord for her to make such a stand for you may it bring you great joy and pleasure that one of your elected seeds one of your teenagers in this day is giving her life to you lord just thinking in the back room lord we can baptize sister abigail with water but only you can baptize her with the holy spirit so may the dove of god and the one that's been dealing with her heart very deeply and very sacredly may you bring joy to yourself by filling sister abigail as in the scriptures when they heard these things and they were pricked in their hearts they said what can we do and they said repent and be baptized every one of you and tonight sister abigail is here to be married to you our lovely lord jesus bless her life and may you feel her to overflowing to be a great testimony to others in jesus christ's name sister abigail it's so wonderful to be identified with jesus christ and as you desire to be identified with him may he fill you tonight and seal your life as we baptize you in the name of our lord jesus
