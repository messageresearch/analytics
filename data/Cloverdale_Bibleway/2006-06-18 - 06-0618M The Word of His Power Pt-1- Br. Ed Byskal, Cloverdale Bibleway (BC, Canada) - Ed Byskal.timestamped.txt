[14:12] [Music]
[14:13] Our gracious father,
[14:17] we want to thank you, oh God, for
[14:19] gathering us again here this morning.
[14:21] Lord,
[14:22] we know that this is the fulfillment of
[14:25] your word. This is your very desire.
[14:28] You admonished us, dear, Father, that
[14:32] as we see the day that will not forsake
[14:35] the assembling of ourselves.
[14:37] So this morning we come with open
[14:39] hearts, dear God, knowing that this is
[14:42] your will for our lives. This is your
[14:44] purpose for us this day. That you have
[14:47] something good in store for us, Father.
[14:50] We're so glad that you're not an
[14:52] historical God. We're so glad, Father,
[14:54] that you've been lifted out out of
[14:56] history, that you're alive and well this
[14:59] morning. Father alive, our hearts, our
[15:02] soul declare and testify that our God is

[15:46] That you move, oh God, freely from pew
[15:49] to pure, from believer to believer, dear
[15:51] God. As we have assembled ourselves this
[15:53] morning, we believe the great pillar of
[15:56] fire is here. And only five minutes in
[15:59] that presence, dear God, can address
[16:01] every need that our lives can have
[16:03] today. How we desire to capitalize on
[16:07] this sacred opportunity. Father, knowing
[16:09] that one of these day, dear God, this
[16:12] kind of gathering will be just history.
[16:14] Father, for you told us by a vindicated
[16:17] prophet that this place will be shut
[16:19] down, dear God. But while we have the
[16:21] opportunity, while we have this
[16:23] privilege, Father, how we want to make
[16:26] much of it, dear God, how we want to
[16:28] draw benefit from your presence that is
[16:30] here, dear God, that will not go empty,
[16:33] Father, that will receive that which you
[16:36] have in store for us, oh God. Remove
[16:38] every hindrance from the way. lay side,
[16:41] oh God, every sin, every contrary
[16:44] spirit, we bind it, oh God, in the name
[16:47] of Jesus Christ, that the freedom of God
[16:50] will be among the church of the living
[16:52] God. That your name once again can be
[16:55] worshiped this morning, that you can be
[16:57] lifted out, that you can be admired,
[17:00] that you can be praised, oh God, that

[17:39] find an entrance in every soul and every
[17:42] heart that something good will take
[17:44] place this morning. Father, we believe
[17:47] you here, Father, to work your will and
[17:49] your way to anoint your servant, to
[17:52] anoint your children, Father, that the
[17:54] word, oh God, can just minister to every
[17:57] life, oh Father, that when we come to

[19:49] [Music]
[19:51] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[19:52] [Music]
[20:05] Want to welcome all those who are
[20:06] visiting with us. Um Claude Leance,
[20:10] it's brother Gee from brother Fernandez
[20:13] Fern Ferdinand Fay Church in Quebec City
[20:16] are visiting with us. Could we get you
[20:18] to stand so we know who you are? Happy
[20:20] to have you. God bless you.
[20:25] And also I've got uh someone visiting
[20:27] from Barbados, Nicholas Critslow.
[20:29] Nicholas, we're happy to have you here
[20:31] this morning.
[20:36] Any other visitors? We're just uh we
[20:37] want to extend a real warm welcome and
[20:39] uh trust you'd uh enjoy yourselves this
[20:41] morning in the presence of God. We have
[20:44] um a baby dedication this morning. Uh
[20:50] the Walmans bring their little one and
[20:52] as they're coming um maybe we could sing
[20:55] this morning. He knows my name. I have a
[20:58] father. Amen.
[21:02] Knows the name of this little one even
[21:03] before they were born. Amen.
[21:07] And while brother Tom's coming, we can
[21:09] sing this.
[21:11] I have a father.
[21:17] He calls me his own.
[21:23] And he'll never
[21:26] leave me.
[21:29] No matter where I go,
[21:33] [Music]
[21:36] he knows my name.
[21:42] He knows my every thought.
[21:48] He sees each tears that falls
[21:53] and hears me when I go. He knows my
[21:58] name.
[22:00] He knows my name.
[22:06] He knows my every
[22:10] [Music]
[22:17] me.
[22:19] [Music]
[22:23] &gt;&gt; I think it's very appropriate on a
[22:25] father's day. We wish the fathers all
[22:27] the best today. And we have a special
[22:30] father here this morning. Dear brother
[22:32] Martin, Sister Diana Woman are are uh
[22:35] bringing their little baby to be
[22:36] dedicated to the Lord. And if there's
[22:39] anybody that is visiting here this
[22:42] morning, you might say, "Well, why
[22:43] aren't you baptizing your babies?" Well,
[22:46] we don't find them baptized in the
[22:48] Bible. Uh it says that they took their
[22:51] children and that they took them to
[22:53] Jesus and Jesus would bless them. But I
[22:56] don't know where they get water baptism
[22:57] for babies because the Bible says repent
[22:59] and then be baptized. The baby doesn't
[23:01] know how to repent yet.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; But we would uh
[23:06] have a responsibility as parents
[23:09] to bring our children to the Lord to
[23:11] have them blessed of God and dedicated
[23:14] to him. And this morning we have
[23:17] Philillip Alexi Woman.
[23:20] And uh it's powerful names. You know, I
[23:24] was thinking about names as as we've
[23:26] over the last months have dedicated
[23:28] quite a few children. And I was
[23:31] thinking, did our parents and parents'
[23:33] parents did they really uh take the time
[23:36] to sit down and find out, you know, uh
[23:39] why we've named it you so. And I think
[23:42] today as believers, it is something
[23:44] that's so important.
[23:47] And with Phillip it is um I thought well
[23:50] I I'll just take a look at Philillip and
[23:51] see you know how many times that even in
[23:54] the message brother Brandon mentions
[23:55] Phillip. Well it's 969 times. Uh that's
[24:00] a that's a good name that uh I I think
[24:02] you can hold to I looked up Thomas and
[24:04] it's only about 69 times. So just to
[24:08] give you some sort of uh plum line
[24:10] there. So that's a lot. and Phillip um
[24:15] Phillip is a if you took the name of in
[24:17] the Greek form which I'm sure mom and
[24:19] dad you've done that and uh it says a
[24:22] lover of horses.
[24:24] Well, I didn't know that um Martin had a
[24:27] horse ranch.
[24:29] So, uh and I don't know whether he ever
[24:31] will have one and I don't know whether
[24:34] Philip will ever come up and be a lover
[24:36] of horses. But if you take a a little
[24:38] bit deeper into it is a man that is full
[24:41] of passion.
[24:43] And if you take a look at Philillip
[24:45] throughout the scripture, whether he be
[24:47] the evangelist, whether he be the
[24:49] apostle, whether he was a deacon in the
[24:52] church, there was something about
[24:54] Philillip that is outstanding.
[24:57] It said he had a passion for the word of
[24:59] God.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; He had a love for the word of God. And
[25:02] the scripture starts in uh John 1:43
[25:05] says, "The day following Jesus would go
[25:07] forth into Galilee findeth Philillip and
[25:10] said unto him, follow me." Well, may
[25:15] that same son of man come down and find
[25:18] this Phillip. And may he have the same
[25:20] passion as the Philillip did in the
[25:23] scripture that he finally came to the
[25:26] place where he said Jesus show us the
[25:30] father and that will suffice me that
[25:33] will give me such great contentment and
[25:36] may that anointing that passion be on
[25:40] this Phillip that at a young age he
[25:42] could say show me God let me see you
[25:45] that will be sufficient for me and I
[25:48] tell Saints of God, that is a tremendous
[25:50] attribute and characteristic to have.
[25:54] Alexi, well, you start to follow that
[25:56] chain and that comes from Alexander,
[26:00] defender of men. Well, we just pray that
[26:04] he'll be a defender of the son of man.
[26:06] Stand for that which is true. Stand pure
[26:09] and hold the word of God up high. It's
[26:12] an incredible thing that you can see
[26:13] such a beautiful young couple this
[26:15] morning cradling a gift from God. May
[26:19] God give the parents also the wisdom
[26:20] that's needed to guide and lead this
[26:24] child that Philip would come to know our
[26:28] Lord Jesus Christ and have a passion for
[26:31] the things of God. Let's pray as we
[26:34] dedicate.
[26:39] It's called a chip off the old block.
[26:44] Let's pray.
[26:48] Heavenly Father, we're
[26:51] holding in our arms a gift from God.
[26:54] You've blessed this home.
[26:57] A young man one day dedicated his life
[27:00] to Christ. Something cried out and said,
[27:02] "Show me the Father. Show me a living
[27:05] God. I'll serve you and a mother the
[27:09] same. Lord
[27:12] &gt;&gt; and now they've given them this gift.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; I dedicate him to you this morning in
[27:19] the name of Jesus Christ
[27:22] &gt;&gt; that he would have a passion and a love
[27:25] for the things of God,
[27:28] a defender
[27:30] of the faith. Let him stand true
[27:34] &gt;&gt; to the word. Bless this son as we give
[27:38] him to you this morning.
[27:40] Give our dear sister wisdom,
[27:44] leadership
[27:46] &gt;&gt; as a mother. Let the fifth gospel ever
[27:50] shine through her life. We pray
[27:53] &gt;&gt; bless this child now as we dedicate him
[27:56] to you Lord in Jesus name.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] It's not.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; And
[28:19] we've got a song this morning from the
[28:21] Episcopal Sisters. And as the children
[28:24] are coming in and they're getting ready
[28:26] uh to sing for us, let's sing together.
[28:28] These are troubled times, my friend, but
[28:31] God is in his people once again.
[28:34] These are troubled times,
[28:37] my friend. So we must be faithful to the
[28:42] end, keeping perfect peace with our Lord
[28:48] and satisfying all his commands,
[28:53] striving till we reach our reward
[28:57] through the awesome power of his word.
[29:02] He's a trouble time,
[29:04] my friend. But God is in his people once
[29:09] again. Oh, God is in his people once
[29:14] again. Fulfilling all the promises he
[29:18] has said, the truth, the word, the life.
[29:23] Manifest
[29:24] the wonders of his glory again in flesh.
[29:29] Preparing for the day when we see no
[29:33] longer through this glass of self dark.
[29:38] God is in his people once again.
[29:43] So we must be faithful to the end.
[29:48] [Music]
[29:59] [Music]
[30:20] The Lord could see
[30:23] [Music]
[30:24] all the guilt in me
[30:29] for the sin that I'd carried.
[30:33] so long.
[30:36] It left a flaw
[30:39] dark as crimson
[30:42] within my soul.
[30:46] [Music]
[30:51] So in love he came
[30:55] and removed the blame,
[30:59] lifting the blemish
[31:02] away.
[31:07] And by his grace he has made me
[31:12] pure and whole,
[31:19] wider than snow.
[31:22] His blood has washed me
[31:26] wher
[31:28] snow
[31:29] with nothing to hide.
[31:33] For deep inside
[31:37] I have been cleansed
[31:40] in Calary
[31:42] soul.
[31:48] All of the sin
[31:51] that tainted my heart
[31:54] with such a wretched
[31:58] scarlet
[31:59] stain
[32:01] has been erased in Jesus
[32:06] name. And I'm wider than snow.
[32:17] [Music]
[32:25] Iniquity
[32:27] [Music]
[32:28] left a mark on me
[32:32] that my best efforts could not purify.
[32:39] But in his sight I am rightous
[32:44] for I believe.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; I believe
[32:53] that redeeming blood
[32:56] is more than enough
[33:00] to go beyond all the shame.
[33:05] [Music]
[33:07] I'm not the same since the Savior
[33:12] made me clean.
[33:18] Wider than snow.
[33:22] His blood has washed me. Wider than
[33:27] snow.
[33:28] With nothing to hide.
[33:32] deep inside.
[33:35] I have been cleansed
[33:38] in Calary
[33:40] Lord.
[33:46] All of the sin
[33:48] the taint in my heart
[33:52] with such a wretch and such
[33:57] name
[33:59] has been erased in Jesus
[34:04] name and I'm lighter than star and I
[34:10] shall be wider than snow.
[34:14] Wash me and I shall be wider
[34:20] deep inside.
[34:23] I have been cleansed in Calary soul.
[34:33] All of the sin
[34:35] that tainted my heart
[34:40] such a
[34:42] sky
[34:46] has been erased in Jesus
[34:50] name. And I'm quieter than snow.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Quieter than snow.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; You are quieter than snow.
[35:02] Wer than snow.
[35:06] Wer
[35:08] than snow.
[35:14] [Music]
[35:16] [Applause]
[35:28] What a testimony.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; What a joy.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to rejoice in that.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Appreciate that. Appreciate the song.
[35:39] Appreciate the all the effort and
[35:43] everyone who participated.
[35:46] I know the girls said they want to sing
[35:48] a song for Father's Day for me. So
[35:52] that's my Father's Day song and we
[35:54] shared it with everybody
[35:56] &gt;&gt; and we sang it to the glory of God.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; Whiter than snow. Hallelujah.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; That wonderful. Are you happy this
[36:03] morning?
[36:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Nice to see the church
[36:08] full. Came to church early ourselves
[36:11] this morning. Found
[36:15] probably 30 or 40 cars in the parking
[36:18] lot an hour before church. And
[36:21] I said, 'Well, I don't know why
[36:23] everybody's coming so early. I said,
[36:25] 'Well, to get a seat. That's why they're
[36:27] coming. And we're happy that you're all
[36:30] here. Thank you for your prayers. And I
[36:33] just uh have something on my heart I
[36:35] wanted to preach this morning. So,
[36:38] &gt;&gt; we're we're just believing God.
[36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Uh I want to say that brother John Tay
[36:45] from Ghana is going to be with us. He's
[36:49] going to be actually with us for about a
[36:50] week starting this Tuesday. He arrives
[36:53] on Tuesday. And so I don't know just uh
[36:57] what he may speak on Wednesday or take a
[37:00] service on Sunday evening. He'll be with
[37:02] us over this next weekend. And just want
[37:05] to he called almost a year ago and said,
[37:08] "I want to make certain that you're
[37:11] going to be home. I want to be there uh
[37:14] on this particular week in June." So,
[37:16] Brother John Tay will be with us. He's
[37:19] only been here once before and uh we're
[37:22] uh looking forward to being with him and
[37:25] speaking tonight. Uh brother Tony is
[37:28] going to be speaking. It's been some
[37:30] time since brother Tony spoke and so you
[37:34] come and be fully expect expecting to
[37:37] hear something that God has put on
[37:39] brother Tony's heart. always burdened
[37:42] for missions but always burdened also
[37:45] for God's people wherever they are.
[37:48] Missions are only God's people.
[37:51] There's really no difference that those
[37:53] are just sister churches around the
[37:56] world. I often am asked, "Are there
[37:58] other churches like yourself?" Oh, I
[38:00] said, "My goodness, we're just a we're
[38:03] just a small little group compared to
[38:07] what God is doing around the world, and
[38:10] we don't even profess to know what all
[38:12] he's doing. I've gotten I've gotten four
[38:16] or five emails this week of what is
[38:20] taking place in Siberia
[38:22] and even under severe persecution.
[38:25] But uh we're we're so grateful for what
[38:29] God is doing. This is his word
[38:32] &gt;&gt; and this is his work and if this message
[38:35] is a message he sent he's responsible
[38:37] for taking it to wherever it's supposed
[38:39] to go and we believe that.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] I believe in just another day or two
[38:47] meetings are also starting in Serbia and
[38:50] this is the second uh second annual uh
[38:55] convention that they've ever had there.
[38:58] uh and brother Milco was over there
[39:00] received a word from him also and so
[39:03] brother Vin is going to be speaking
[39:05] those meetings in Serbia and he said the
[39:08] people are filled with such expectation
[39:11] and of course you can imagine you know
[39:13] when something happens the first time
[39:15] it's really wonderful something happens
[39:17] the second time you never want to let it
[39:20] become just normal to you even you are
[39:23] here this morning some of you have been
[39:25] here for many many years but it should
[39:27] just be another special day.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Filled with expectation. And if you are,
[39:33] then God's going to just come and meet.
[39:35] If it's if you're just here to put in
[39:37] time, that's all you'll get is just put
[39:40] in some time. But if you're here to
[39:42] receive something, God will do it for
[39:44] you.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart.
[39:48] We're happy for all the godly fathers.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Well, that was a little sound. Sound
[39:56] like some of you fathers must be very
[39:57] strict or something.
[40:00] But we're happy for all the godly
[40:01] fathers,
[40:03] &gt;&gt; aren't we? Speaking about fathers, we
[40:07] have one that I'm very happy for.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father.
[40:13] I thought of it this morning early.
[40:17] Touched my heart.
[40:19] So glad I have a father like you. Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; So glad
[40:26] that I have this opportunity
[40:29] to try to be an honor to your name and
[40:33] be an honor to you. So thankful that
[40:36] I'll have the privilege to be with your
[40:39] children, your people, people that you
[40:42] thought so much of that you sent Jesus
[40:46] Christ and paid that supreme sacrifice
[40:50] and bought them. back to yourself. Oh,
[40:54] how I thank you. What a privilege that
[40:58] we can be together today. Tell you, it's
[41:00] a great honor. That's our father
[41:04] and every day is his day.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't it so?
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; But for you fathers, the world is
[41:11] remembering their fathers. And I just
[41:14] and and a father is not only someone who
[41:16] has brought forth children, but a father
[41:20] can be someone who
[41:24] is a role model. He's has leadership,
[41:29] someone that's an example,
[41:31] someone who has influence on others. And
[41:34] I trust that we will as men of this
[41:40] message will be that kind of an example
[41:44] and that you young men will be able to
[41:47] look up to that and look up to those and
[41:50] say that's a godly brother. You that are
[41:54] sons, you can look up to your father and
[41:56] say to your heavenly father, "I'm so
[42:01] thankful and I want to show my
[42:04] appreciation not just in a card or with
[42:07] a few words, but I want to show my
[42:10] appreciation by living an honorable life
[42:13] that'll bring honor upon my father's
[42:15] head, my upon my dad's life."
[42:19] I thought of Jacob when he called his
[42:22] sons before he was to pass away. It's
[42:26] it's a custom that is not kept today
[42:30] where a father will actually pass
[42:33] blessings that are literally prophetic
[42:37] upon his children, upon his sons. And he
[42:40] called all his sons. And he prophesied
[42:43] concerning each of them and blessed them
[42:47] with blessings. And even when Isaac
[42:50] blessed uh blessed Jacob
[42:54] and Esau cried out for a blessing, when
[42:58] he found that the blessing had already
[43:00] been passed to Jacob, he just cried out
[43:04] cried bitterly, "Isn't there a blessing
[43:06] left for me?" And but the blessing had
[43:10] already passed upon
[43:13] Jacob and his father could not withdraw
[43:16] it and draw it back. And I thought this
[43:19] morning that although we do not have
[43:22] that practice, I'm not sure that God has
[43:26] done away with it.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Just simply because we do not do it
[43:31] doesn't mean that it it went by the
[43:33] boards, that it doesn't exist. I believe
[43:36] that as fathers, godly fathers, we
[43:40] should be able to come to a place at a
[43:44] time in our life when we can say to our
[43:47] sons and and our daughters, I bless you
[43:51] &gt;&gt; in the name of God,
[43:53] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
[43:55] bless you and bless your life and what
[43:58] you shall do and what you shall be for
[44:00] the kingdom of God.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] Just a little personal note.
[44:07] Would you like to stand with me? And
[44:10] we're going to read out of Matthew's
[44:12] Gospel.
[44:17] And before we read, Brother Roy, I'm
[44:19] going to sing that chorus. If you would,
[44:21] please. We're going to I'm sorry. We're
[44:23] going to just sing this chorus. Father
[44:26] in Heaven,
[44:28] we thank you. Brother Rod, you'll lead
[44:30] it for us. 279
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Father
[44:39] in heaven,
[44:41] we love you.
[44:45] We lift your name in all
[44:49] the earth.
[44:52] May your kingdom be established in your
[44:57] praises.
[45:00] As your people declare your mighty word,
[45:06] blessing
[45:10] God
[45:11] mighty
[45:18] to
[45:20] bless
[45:22] the
[45:26] mighty
[45:29] who lives forever.
[45:32] [Music]
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord God. Blessed be the
[45:37] Lord
[45:39] God
[45:41] Almighty
[45:44] who are
[45:50] blessed
[45:53] God
[45:55] mighty
[45:58] who lives forever. ever
[46:05] &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed.
[46:08] Dear Father,
[46:10] how we thank you, how we love you, how
[46:15] privileged we are to be able to say that
[46:18] we are your children and that you
[46:21] brought us forth.
[46:24] You gave us birth into your family
[46:27] and we feel in very deeply honored. We
[46:32] come to you with respects.
[46:34] We come to you with love. And oh God, we
[46:38] know that what you began in our lives is
[46:42] just the beginning. And what you have
[46:44] begun, you have you will finish. You
[46:48] will complete it. And we realize
[46:51] according to your word, we're just in a
[46:53] little journey at this time. We're
[46:55] passing through this veil of human life.
[47:00] But Lord, we have another goal in our
[47:02] eyesight. We've got the prize of the
[47:05] high calling before us. And we will not
[47:08] be deterred from the direction. We will
[47:11] not be deterred from the pathway that
[47:14] you've set before us. I ask you to bless
[47:17] this people, oh God. And Father, if
[47:20] there's any way that I can influence
[47:22] them in a more godly manner, I pray that
[47:26] they will be lifted up into heavenly
[47:28] places. Lord, even today by your Holy
[47:31] Spirit, take control of the speaker and
[47:34] the hearers of the word. I ask, oh God,
[47:38] you will defy and deny the enemy at
[47:41] every corner and every junction. You'll
[47:45] bind his power. You'll cast him out, oh
[47:48] God, of those where he's tried to harbor
[47:52] and and hinder. I pray, Lord, the lives
[47:55] will be set free in the name of Jesus
[47:58] Christ that that lives will be healed,
[48:02] homes will be healed. Lord, I pray that
[48:05] minds and souls will be healed by the
[48:08] power of your word in the name of Jesus
[48:11] Christ. Bless all who are listening with
[48:15] us, all who are watching now on the
[48:18] internet. We say blessings upon them and
[48:21] may they revel in the glory of God today
[48:25] in Jesus Christ's name, Lord. We're
[48:29] depending entirely upon you now. Bless
[48:32] your word. Anoint me, I pray in Jesus
[48:34] Christ's name. Amen.
[48:37] Amen.
[48:40] Matthew the 12th chapter
[48:43] and we're going to begin reading at
[48:45] verse 33.
[48:52] If you had a Scoffield Bible,
[48:56] Scoffield
[49:00] gives uh like subtitles to various
[49:03] segments of the scripture
[49:06] and Dr. Scoffield has called this this
[49:09] portion starting verse 33 destiny and
[49:12] words.
[49:17] Either make the tree good and his fruit
[49:21] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[49:24] his fruit corrupt.
[49:27] For the tree is known by his fruit. Oh
[49:30] generation of vipers, how can ye being
[49:33] evil speak good things? For out of the
[49:36] abundance of the heart, the mouth
[49:38] speaketh.
[49:40] A good man out of the good treasure of
[49:42] his heart bringeth forth good things,
[49:45] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[49:48] bringeth forth evil things. But I say
[49:51] unto you, that every idle word that men
[49:55] shall speak, they shall give an account
[49:57] thereof in the day of judgment. For by
[50:01] thy words thou shalt be justified,
[50:04] and by thy words thou shalt be
[50:08] condemned.
[50:10] I'll have you turn also to Hebrews
[50:14] the first chapter
[50:21] and we're just reading one verse there
[50:25] and it's verse three.
[50:30] who being the brightness of his glory
[50:33] and the express image of his person and
[50:37] upholding all things by the word of his
[50:40] power when he had by himself purged our
[50:44] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[50:48] majesty on high. May God bless his word
[50:52] to our hearts as you have your seats.
[50:59] What I'm speaking to you about this
[51:02] morning is is in this third verse of
[51:06] Hebrews 1 and the text is the word of
[51:10] his power.
[51:12] I will just have you notice it does not
[51:15] say the power of his word
[51:18] but it says the word of his power. Like
[51:22] you to notice that. Now there was
[51:25] another instance in the scripture where
[51:29] uh the father of a son delivered a young
[51:32] man to Jesus
[51:35] and uh there was a demon spirit which
[51:38] was tormenting him and would cast him
[51:41] into the fire and so on and u when they
[51:45] brought him to Jesus they said we
[51:47] brought my son I brought my son to your
[51:50] disciples but they were not able to cast
[51:54] him out. And so Jesus, he uh uh he just
[51:58] said they were of little faith. And then
[52:01] the Bible says that he cast out this
[52:04] tormenting spirit. And the the Bible
[52:07] then says, "And they were all amazed at
[52:12] the power of God."
[52:14] Now that phrase, the power of God, we
[52:18] have the power of God and the word of
[52:20] his power. But that phrase, the power of
[52:23] God, those three words, that phrase does
[52:27] does only appear in the New Testament.
[52:30] There's no place in the Old Testament
[52:32] where you have those three words put
[52:34] together. The power power of God.
[52:39] And of course, I think that that is
[52:42] significant because Jesus Christ was the
[52:46] word made flesh and God used the word
[52:52] made flesh to demonstrate his power. So
[52:56] it was the power of his word. And so
[53:01] this this phrase now has some meaning to
[53:05] us because I I want to take this slowly
[53:10] just to begin with because I have some
[53:11] statements that I want you to think
[53:13] about.
[53:15] God cannot increase in power.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And God cannot decrease in power.
[53:25] God is absolute.
[53:28] absolute in his wisdom,
[53:31] absolute in his power.
[53:34] He's absolute in his attributes. He
[53:37] cannot diminish in mercy. He cannot
[53:40] diminish in love. He cannot diminish in
[53:44] any attribute and he neither can he
[53:46] increase in them. God is absolute. We
[53:50] agree with that. I'm sure that you do.
[53:53] Now the only thing we could say is that
[53:56] God has set certain laws
[54:01] in place that either control these
[54:04] attributes or control this power
[54:09] and or gives access to the power. He can
[54:14] say this is how you can have access to
[54:18] it and I will not regard anything else.
[54:21] Or you can access my power this way for
[54:25] this season. God arbitrarily can change
[54:29] that access and say now it's this way.
[54:33] I'm going to allow you to access this
[54:36] power by through just mercy. The Bible
[54:40] says God keeps covenant and mercy. There
[54:45] are his chosen way to access say his
[54:50] power and his mercy or his his uh
[54:53] healing power. His his chosen way is
[54:57] through the covenant through the word.
[55:00] God said it and I believe it and that's
[55:03] all finished now. That's his chosen way.
[55:07] But there are some who are of little
[55:09] faith. Some don't have hardly any faith.
[55:13] But they cry out to God and cry out to
[55:15] God, "Have mercy. Have mercy on me." And
[55:17] then God keeps mercy.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And he allows that as an avenue, as an
[55:22] access to his power. So God, he's
[55:26] sovereign. He can, he can determine how
[55:30] his power will be administered, how his
[55:32] mercy will be administered. And there
[55:35] was a time when he had administered it
[55:38] uh without a prophet prior to Moses.
[55:41] Then it came with Moses and he
[55:43] ministered it through the prophets. And
[55:45] then it came the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[55:48] ministered it through Jesus Christ.
[55:50] Jesus Christ departed and said, "Now
[55:52] it'll be through you. It's through the
[55:54] church." And then the church got all
[55:56] messed up and denominated and got their
[55:59] creeds and traditions and God bypassed
[56:02] them and and he would do it only through
[56:05] his chosen channel. And in the end time
[56:08] he said he would restore the word back
[56:10] once again.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And so that I just like to have that as
[56:14] a set as a to kind of set some uh basis.
[56:20] Now
[56:21] because God is absolute because his
[56:23] power cannot increase and because his
[56:25] power cannot decrease
[56:28] I will say that his power is always
[56:30] present. You will perhaps you that have
[56:33] been listening to the services over the
[56:35] last number of weeks uh you'll pick up
[56:38] on I have a bit of a theme. Forgiveness
[56:41] is always here.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; It's always here. Mercyy's always
[56:45] present. His power is always present.
[56:49] But it's just that we don't access it.
[56:51] Sometimes I his presence is here, but we
[56:55] don't we're not we're not we're not
[56:58] recognizing of it. And uh and so and God
[57:03] is always present because God fills all
[57:06] time and space. We can't do away with
[57:08] that statement. God fills all time and
[57:12] space. God can't be any more present.
[57:15] God can't go up and can't go down
[57:17] whatever more he can. He can show
[57:19] himself as Jesus was here and Jesus
[57:22] departed from them and went up. But God
[57:24] didn't go any place.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That manifestation of God. You
[57:29] understand? I think it's an important
[57:31] thing that we settle in our minds that
[57:34] God's not gone off someplace.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; He's not off some distant place. We
[57:39] don't have to bring him down. We don't
[57:40] have to call him up. He is here present
[57:42] with us. The only thing is that we we
[57:45] need to become conditioned by the word
[57:47] of God and by faith and by our own our
[57:50] own uh spiritual awareness.
[57:53] We have to give oursel to that. And
[57:55] Satan's job is to get you fully
[57:58] occupied, get your mind occupied, get
[58:01] your thoughts and everything just
[58:03] consumed
[58:05] with everything else. And you simply
[58:07] don't have time. It it does take time to
[58:11] fellowship with God.
[58:13] You believe that?
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[58:23] Jesus came and spake unto them. Matthew
[58:26] 28:18.
[58:27] And he said, "All power is given unto me
[58:31] in heaven and in earth." And that's when
[58:34] he said, "Go ye therefore and teach all
[58:37] nations. All power is given me in heaven
[58:42] and in earth.
[58:44] In John 7:46,
[58:47] the offers uh off the officers answered
[58:51] when they heard the words of Jesus and
[58:53] they saw his power demonstrated. They
[58:56] said, "Never man spake like this man."
[59:02] And proverbs
[59:04] by Solomon, who is the wisest of men,
[59:07] said, "Death and life
[59:12] are in the power of the tongue,
[59:16] and they that love it shall eat the
[59:19] fruit thereof."
[59:21] I want to just launch out by saying I
[59:25] seriously doubt
[59:27] that anyone here or within the sound of
[59:30] my voice realizes the power that they
[59:34] actually possess
[59:37] &gt;&gt; and the power of the tongue,
[59:41] &gt;&gt; the power of their words.
[59:45] I really doubt that we realize and can
[59:49] grasp
[59:51] the extent of that.
[59:54] I felt some inspiration
[59:57] in the last few days. Some special
[59:59] inspiration I felt and I wrote this and
[1:00:03] I'm going to it's not profound
[1:00:06] but uh it it kind of embodies where I
[1:00:11] want to go.
[1:00:15] Perhaps more than at any time in
[1:00:17] history, the world is filled with words.
[1:00:21] And I've simply titled this world of
[1:00:24] words.
[1:00:28] If the sound waves were open to our
[1:00:31] hearing,
[1:00:32] it would be a tower of babel once again
[1:00:36] on a grand scale.
[1:00:39] Then if it were possible to make an
[1:00:41] analysis of all these words,
[1:00:44] most would be without value.
[1:00:49] Much of it would have to do with the
[1:00:51] necess necessary issues of this life.
[1:00:55] However, lastly,
[1:00:58] there would remain the words of God
[1:01:00] spoken under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:01:03] Spirit.
[1:01:04] Words echoing throughout the vast
[1:01:07] reaches of time and space, repeated over
[1:01:11] and over by countless voices.
[1:01:16] These words cannot pass away
[1:01:19] but in fact they evolve
[1:01:23] and morphe
[1:01:24] from the sounds of words into a living
[1:01:29] form
[1:01:30] not found not bound by time or other
[1:01:34] limitations.
[1:01:36] These words of God are indestructible.
[1:01:42] Paul said,
[1:01:44] "The fashion of this world passeth
[1:01:47] away."
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Heaven and earth shall
[1:01:54] pass away, but my words shall not pass
[1:01:57] away."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; So now we have a distinction here. The
[1:02:02] fashion of this world shall pass away.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; But there are words that shall not pass
[1:02:09] away. And I suggest to you that those
[1:02:11] words do indeed evolve. They are
[1:02:14] transformed
[1:02:16] from mere words into a living event into
[1:02:21] a living. They become embodied in people
[1:02:25] that God has intended that these words
[1:02:27] will be embodied in and those persons
[1:02:31] repeat the same word that God spoke and
[1:02:35] those words never pass away. Amen.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And those who speak them shall never
[1:02:43] pass away.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; It's not just repeating and becoming
[1:02:47] repetitious and pariting
[1:02:51] the Bible. It's more than that. It is
[1:02:54] God with his initial intent coming and
[1:02:58] dwelling in a person by his spirit. And
[1:03:01] that person being not merely convinced
[1:03:03] but actually becoming one with the word
[1:03:06] that they have received. And thus that
[1:03:09] word now becomes an event
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; in the message. Christ is the mystery of
[1:03:18] God revealed. And incidentally, some of
[1:03:19] these things will be
[1:03:22] profoundly simple.
[1:03:25] And I think that's where we miss it.
[1:03:28] In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:03:30] revealed.
[1:03:32] Brother Brandham simply said, "Talk nice
[1:03:34] about one another
[1:03:36] and say nice things about one another."
[1:03:41] It's not only what we say,
[1:03:45] but it's who we say it to.
[1:03:49] The power of the tongue, life and death
[1:03:53] lay in the power of the tongue.
[1:03:57] Jesus said, "And whosoever speaketh a
[1:04:01] word
[1:04:02] against the son of man,
[1:04:07] it shall be forgiven him." That's right.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; But whosoever speaketh against the Holy
[1:04:14] Ghost,
[1:04:16] it shall not be forgiven him, neither in
[1:04:19] this world,
[1:04:21] neither in the world to come.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; The power that is in the word,
[1:04:28] you cannot
[1:04:30] circumvent or make that mean something
[1:04:33] else. It is exactly what it is. And the
[1:04:37] prophet took it and said to speak
[1:04:40] against what the Holy Ghost has done
[1:04:42] because this is the dispensation of the
[1:04:44] Holy Spirit. what the Holy Ghost has
[1:04:46] done in this age and through that
[1:04:49] messenger uh the the supernatural which
[1:04:52] was not a man could be nothing less than
[1:04:56] God himself using a redeemed instrument
[1:05:00] and bringing forth and showing
[1:05:02] demonstrating vindicating confirming
[1:05:05] proving and speaking to speak against
[1:05:08] that will not be forgiven
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; neither in this world or the world to
[1:05:13] come and Think about now the power of
[1:05:17] the word
[1:05:18] at just an individual at just a tongue
[1:05:21] like you have and now can form certain
[1:05:25] words and say things that are that are
[1:05:30] go out into the space and out into time
[1:05:33] and are not forgiven by God.
[1:05:40] And so
[1:05:42] in this age
[1:05:45] of people's rights, which is a Leodysian
[1:05:48] age, this age of people's rights, it's a
[1:05:51] time when people feel at perfect liberty
[1:05:55] just to say whatever they want to say,
[1:05:58] to say whoever they want to say it to,
[1:06:00] to say it about whoever they want to
[1:06:03] talk about, and say whatever their mind
[1:06:07] uh, you know, wants to generate.
[1:06:11] All I can say is that we are either
[1:06:14] perpetuating life or we're bringing
[1:06:17] death.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; One or the other. Or it could just be
[1:06:22] perhaps some wasteful wasteful
[1:06:24] conversation, which a lot of it is.
[1:06:28] On the other hand,
[1:06:31] I'm using this on a natural basis for
[1:06:33] just a few moments. On the other hand,
[1:06:36] there if we think for a moment that
[1:06:39] we're going to pass through life without
[1:06:42] having criticism,
[1:06:45] without attracting all kinds of nasty
[1:06:47] things being said about you and being
[1:06:50] said behind your back. If you think that
[1:06:53] we're going to pass through life without
[1:06:54] that, you are sadly mistaken. We are not
[1:06:58] only going to receive that, but we're to
[1:07:00] expect that. Jesus said, "Beware when
[1:07:03] all men speak well of you." Now, the
[1:07:06] only thing we want to beware of
[1:07:08] ourselves is that we don't uh that we
[1:07:12] don't bring it upon ourselves. Uh but if
[1:07:16] those that live godly shall suffer
[1:07:18] persecution and it's not that we go out
[1:07:21] trying to find it, but you will people
[1:07:24] will misunderstand you and people will
[1:07:26] say uh nasty things about you, but we
[1:07:30] must not allow ourselves to be adversely
[1:07:33] affected when those things are spoken.
[1:07:36] We when they're said, we should say like
[1:07:38] the prophet said, "Well, you know, that
[1:07:42] that's all right. that doesn't mean
[1:07:44] anything. That just had to be it' be
[1:07:46] wonderful just to be able to take that
[1:07:47] attitude.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Now if you know this is very very
[1:07:53] essential for a church
[1:07:56] because uh people today feel as I said
[1:08:00] and they do I do not want you to leave
[1:08:02] this service and forget this message
[1:08:05] today because it is something that's
[1:08:07] very deep on my heart. Uh talk is cheap
[1:08:13] and talk not only comes cheap but it's
[1:08:16] it it is either going to be productive.
[1:08:19] It's either going to advance somebody or
[1:08:22] it's going to degrade them and it's
[1:08:25] going to uh uh you know uh shall I say
[1:08:30] it can bring them into a into a state of
[1:08:33] uh being discouraged or you can
[1:08:35] encourage people and uh I'm going to I I
[1:08:39] I'm going to labor on this for a little
[1:08:42] bit but this is not the whole substance
[1:08:45] of my of my service.
[1:08:51] If what others say are untrue,
[1:08:55] if what someone says is untrue, let them
[1:08:59] be responsible for it.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; But why should it affect you?
[1:09:04] I always feel that if someone brings
[1:09:06] some kind of a accusation or says
[1:09:10] something about you as an individual and
[1:09:12] you will hear it, oh well I I heard this
[1:09:14] or I heard that. As soon as you respond
[1:09:18] to that or allow that to affect you, you
[1:09:20] are lowering yourself to that level.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; I this person wants to say something or
[1:09:27] that church wants to say something more
[1:09:29] and they've said nasty things about
[1:09:31] about the message and about the
[1:09:33] ministers of the message and about the
[1:09:35] believers of the message and whatever
[1:09:36] more. But but now for believer to
[1:09:39] believer, we are to be in support of one
[1:09:42] another.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that? We are to be in
[1:09:45] support of one another at every possible
[1:09:48] junction, every opportunity. We want to
[1:09:52] be strengthening one another. And we
[1:09:54] also want to be living a life that is
[1:09:56] not drawing fire.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; We don't want to. If somebody says,
[1:10:00] "Well, somebody says I'm sloughing off."
[1:10:02] Well, if you are sloughing off, sharpen
[1:10:04] up.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Well, that's true. I haven't
[1:10:09] been living where I'm supposed to be
[1:10:11] living, and I accept that." certainly
[1:10:12] have a right to say that even though it
[1:10:15] does trouble me. Well, then the thing to
[1:10:17] do is to live so that you're not drawing
[1:10:19] that kind of a criticism. That kind of
[1:10:22] criticism might be healthy.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Say, well, that is that is so I I heard
[1:10:28] this kind of rumble and I heard that
[1:10:29] this was said and so on so forth.
[1:10:31] Furthermore, it's actually true. I have
[1:10:34] not been just what I should be. I
[1:10:36] haven't been. And uh but on the other
[1:10:38] hand, regardless, I think the best
[1:10:41] position for a believer is not to
[1:10:44] respond. It's just not to respond
[1:10:48] because all kinds of things will forever
[1:10:50] be said. But it is for us as believers.
[1:10:52] I want to impose upon you today that the
[1:10:56] power of life and death is in your
[1:10:58] tongue.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible has said. And it's
[1:11:02] an incredible
[1:11:04] power that is invested within the
[1:11:07] believer. In fact, is so much so that
[1:11:09] it's impossible for me to convey it and
[1:11:11] impossible for you to grasp it. the
[1:11:14] things that God has said in the word of
[1:11:17] God.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; The devil,
[1:11:26] he's an expert at magnifying things
[1:11:31] to produce a negative effect upon God's
[1:11:34] people.
[1:11:36] Brother Brennham said in a message
[1:11:39] expectation, keep your eyes on the end.
[1:11:44] Jesus coming.
[1:11:46] What will it be then?
[1:11:49] Now, if I asked for you to raise your
[1:11:51] hands, I'm not going to do so. But if I
[1:11:53] asked for you to raise your hands, how
[1:11:55] many plan to go to heaven? whatever
[1:11:57] heaven means to you, uh, however you've
[1:12:00] been taught, whatever your understanding
[1:12:02] is, but I can tell you heaven is
[1:12:05] certainly
[1:12:06] a different place than what you live in
[1:12:08] right now.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; And I want to go there.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I plan to go there.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to live here as though I plan
[1:12:17] to go there. Right?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying you need to keep
[1:12:22] your eyes on that goal
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; because if you look too close around
[1:12:27] you,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; he said, furthermore, no matter what
[1:12:30] people say about you now and how you're
[1:12:33] persecuted, for all that live godly in
[1:12:37] Christ shall suffer persecution, being
[1:12:40] made fun of and mocked and so forth. But
[1:12:44] watch what it will be at the end. That's
[1:12:48] what where it'll pay off.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we're concerned about. It
[1:12:53] doesn't matter what people say about you
[1:12:56] at this time. What does that mean?
[1:12:59] That's irrelevant.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; You have your eyes on the ultimate goal,
[1:13:05] and that's how you should live. Live now
[1:13:08] with that ultimate goal always in mind.
[1:13:10] He said, "But watch what it will be at
[1:13:12] the end. That's what that's where it'll
[1:13:15] really pay off. and just hold steady and
[1:13:18] keep your eye on the end. He said
[1:13:21] that'll be good for you.
[1:13:24] I love the simplicity. That'll be good
[1:13:26] for you. You keep your eye on the end
[1:13:29] and don't worry what people say about
[1:13:31] you. Now
[1:13:33] I find that what things that are perhaps
[1:13:36] said
[1:13:39] are sometimes said in ignorance because
[1:13:43] uh I I'd like you to make aware make you
[1:13:45] aware of something. Not that you haven't
[1:13:46] thought of it. Not that this is some
[1:13:48] great deep truth but it's very very
[1:13:50] important.
[1:13:53] Sometimes you can hear something about
[1:13:55] someone
[1:13:57] and they failed God or they slipped or
[1:14:01] they fell spiritually, whatever more,
[1:14:04] and by the time someone else picks it up
[1:14:07] and repeats it to another person, it's
[1:14:09] already been forgiven and washed under
[1:14:11] the blood of Jesus Christ, and it's long
[1:14:14] gone,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and God can't even find it, but some
[1:14:17] person can.
[1:14:20] Then what kind of a state do we put
[1:14:22] ourselves in when we
[1:14:26] what power have we uh taken to ourselves
[1:14:29] to bring up something that the blood of
[1:14:32] Jesus Christ I don't want you to ever
[1:14:34] forget this
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; that the blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:14:38] already forgiven
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; and it has already been confessed and
[1:14:45] when it was confessed that drop of ink
[1:14:48] dropped into the bleach of the blood of
[1:14:50] Jesus Christ. And the prophet said that
[1:14:53] the properties, these are my words now,
[1:14:56] but the properties, the very chemistry
[1:14:59] of the ink dissipates into the bleach
[1:15:02] and you can't find it.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it can never come back
[1:15:08] to be ink again.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; In other words, that sin when it's
[1:15:12] forgiven by a confession, it can never
[1:15:16] become sin again.
[1:15:19] That is a powerful statement. It can
[1:15:21] never be. How many of your sins have
[1:15:24] been washed away, my friends? How many
[1:15:26] of your sins and your background have
[1:15:27] been washed away? It can never be sin
[1:15:30] again.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; It can never be a failure again.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; It can never come to the surface again
[1:15:40] because the very chemistry of the blood
[1:15:42] of Jesus Christ has dispensed and
[1:15:44] dispersed it. In fact is he says the ink
[1:15:47] becomes the bleach.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; You talk about powerful. That's
[1:15:56] powerful.
[1:16:00] What's a confession?
[1:16:04] What's a confession?
[1:16:07] Words.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Words.
[1:16:13] Just words.
[1:16:16] The power of life and death are in the
[1:16:21] tongue. And the tongue says, "Father,
[1:16:27] forgive me."
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And your sin and the darkness of your
[1:16:34] iniquity
[1:16:35] passes into the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:16:39] and cannot be found again. That's power.
[1:16:44] That's incredible power.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it
[1:16:51] in the spoken word, the original seed.
[1:16:56] Brother Bram said, "Someone came the
[1:16:58] other day
[1:17:00] and said somebody had said something bad
[1:17:03] about me and accused me of something
[1:17:06] that was wrong."
[1:17:11] Now,
[1:17:12] brother Brandham said three words.
[1:17:15] This person came to the prophet of God
[1:17:18] and said, "This is what certain certain
[1:17:20] person has said about you."
[1:17:25] And now it wasn't true in this case. It
[1:17:27] was actually wrong.
[1:17:30] And now the prophet has a response.
[1:17:33] Would you like to know what the response
[1:17:34] is?
[1:17:37] I would say it's a good example for your
[1:17:39] response.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Isn't that deep?
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Isn't that profound? I tell you, it's a
[1:17:52] revelation you all need.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation we all need.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Three words. Oh, forget it.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't it nice?
[1:18:06] I'm just preaching a simple message this
[1:18:08] morning,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; but it's deeper than a lot of us have
[1:18:11] ever gone.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Oh, forget it." He said,
[1:18:18] and the man responds, "How can you take
[1:18:20] it like that? That involves your
[1:18:24] family." So it wasn't just Brother
[1:18:26] Brandham, it involved his family, this
[1:18:29] accusation. How can you take it like
[1:18:31] that? And I said, "Oh my." I said that
[1:18:35] was predestinated
[1:18:37] before the foundation of the world to
[1:18:40] give me a trial.
[1:18:44] What he's really saying is this is a
[1:18:47] blessing.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; This is a blessing to me because it was
[1:18:51] predestinated to give me a trial.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something, friends. laying
[1:18:59] here is one of the greatest secrets that
[1:19:03] a Christian could ever have is how to
[1:19:06] handle and deal with these kind of
[1:19:08] things. People go sideways. People go
[1:19:11] downhill. People give up. People get all
[1:19:14] discouraged. Say, "Well, this one said
[1:19:16] this about me and that one said that
[1:19:18] about me." I've got the prophet's answer
[1:19:20] for. Forget it.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but they you don't know how
[1:19:25] nasty it is. Forget it. It's just been a
[1:19:28] predestinated trial. Just forget it.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:19:41] and they and the other gentleman said,
[1:19:43] "How do you do it?" And I said, "If I
[1:19:46] look right down this if I look right
[1:19:49] down this way, I'd be falling all the
[1:19:52] time." In other words, let me interpret
[1:19:55] it for you. It's not going to stop.
[1:19:58] You're always going to hear something.
[1:20:00] You're always going to have statements
[1:20:02] being made. You're going to hear things
[1:20:04] and and if and if you're going to just
[1:20:06] look here, and that's why I give the
[1:20:08] other quote, "Where are you supposed to
[1:20:09] be looking? You're supposed to be
[1:20:10] looking at the objective. You're looking
[1:20:12] at where you're going." He said, "Look
[1:20:14] at the end." And that'll hold you
[1:20:16] steady. You just keep looking at the
[1:20:18] end. I want us to have this congregation
[1:20:21] agree with me that you are you're
[1:20:23] determined to do that. I'm looking at
[1:20:25] the end. I'm not going to look here, you
[1:20:27] know, this little family matter and that
[1:20:29] little thing here and what my peers said
[1:20:32] and what my friend said at school or
[1:20:34] what what my fellow said at the at the
[1:20:37] uh uh you know at the workplace or what
[1:20:39] the lady said on the telephone, whatever
[1:20:41] more.
[1:20:43] It's not going to end.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And if you do that, you're going to be
[1:20:48] falling all the time. You just get up
[1:20:50] over this and say, "Oh, I got victory
[1:20:52] over this now." Oh, and you know,
[1:20:54] somebody said, "I'm sorry, da da da."
[1:20:56] And and next time you're going to run
[1:20:59] into it again. You'll be falling all the
[1:21:01] time. But the one the one that's an
[1:21:03] absolute victory, it says, "Oh, this
[1:21:05] came my way." Says, "Oh, forget it."
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That one comes broing in from that way.
[1:21:10] Oh, just forget it.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; If I look down here, I'm going to be
[1:21:13] falling all the time. Oh, just forget
[1:21:14] it. That's just a predestinated trial.
[1:21:19] And it makes no difference
[1:21:22] to what degree or intensity or how
[1:21:25] terrible or how horrible. It couldn't
[1:21:27] get bad enough. They couldn't say enough
[1:21:29] bad things you got victory over it
[1:21:31] because you just got the phrase, "Well,
[1:21:34] forget it."
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it can cut you so deep and
[1:21:40] hurt you so bad you don't know if you're
[1:21:42] going to survive. But if you take this
[1:21:44] attitude, oh, just forget it.
[1:21:47] You say, "Oh, brother Bisco, we came
[1:21:48] here for something a whole lot deeper
[1:21:50] than that." Listen, I'm going to give
[1:21:51] you something that you'll have victory
[1:21:53] this week over. This is something you
[1:21:55] can put into practice tomorrow morning.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; He says, and once again, he said, "Look
[1:22:02] out here to the end of the road. A man
[1:22:05] who looks like this, that is down here,
[1:22:08] he doesn't know where he's going. He's
[1:22:11] looking this way. But if you look out
[1:22:13] yonder,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; you don't care what's going on now.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; You know where you're going.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And that's it. Look where you're going.
[1:22:24] Stay lined up with the word. So, it's
[1:22:28] impossible, as I said a moment ago, for
[1:22:30] us to go through life without uh
[1:22:33] criticisms of some sort or some sharp
[1:22:37] thing said about us. But Jesus said,
[1:22:40] "Woe unto you when all men shall speak
[1:22:42] well of you." For so did their fathers
[1:22:45] to the false prophets. For so did their
[1:22:49] fathers to the false prophets spoke
[1:22:52] well.
[1:22:54] So we are well instructed what to do and
[1:22:57] what not to do.
[1:23:00] Now David, I'm going to read a a portion
[1:23:02] of Psalms here.
[1:23:05] David said in the Psalms,
[1:23:08] "Mine enemies speak evil of me." "Mine
[1:23:11] enemies speak evil of me." This is
[1:23:12] Psalms 41, starting at verse 5.
[1:23:16] "Mine enemies speak evil of me. When
[1:23:20] shall he die, and his name perish?
[1:23:24] And if he come to see me, he speaketh
[1:23:26] vanity.
[1:23:28] His heart gatherth iniquity to itself.
[1:23:31] When he goeth abroad, he tellth it. All
[1:23:34] that hate me, whisper together against
[1:23:37] me. Against me do they devise my hurt.
[1:23:42] All and an and evil disease say they
[1:23:46] cleaveth fast unto him. And now he that
[1:23:50] lith he shall rise up no more. I just
[1:23:54] want your attention for a moment. Can
[1:23:56] you grasp what these enemies were
[1:23:59] saying? of David himself
[1:24:03] that they whisper together. So there
[1:24:06] wasn't just one against me and against
[1:24:10] me do they devise my hurt and they say
[1:24:13] that evil cleaves to him.
[1:24:16] They say that and now he lith and he
[1:24:19] shall not rise up anymore. In other
[1:24:21] words, he's finished. See, he's
[1:24:23] finished. They're not going to rise up
[1:24:25] anymore. And that's the message that had
[1:24:28] come through to David. And he said, he
[1:24:32] went on further and he said, "Yay, my
[1:24:34] mine own familiar friend
[1:24:37] in whom I trusted
[1:24:40] which did eat my bread, they ate
[1:24:42] together.
[1:24:45] They went to McDonald's together.
[1:24:49] They were over at,
[1:24:52] you know, what's her name?" the Dutch
[1:24:56] mothers
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; in Lynden. They ate together.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; They were together. And he said, "And
[1:25:04] which did eat my bread." So they were
[1:25:06] over at his house
[1:25:09] hath lifted up his heel against me. said
[1:25:13] if if it been he said if it been my
[1:25:15] enemy that'd been one thing but it was
[1:25:17] my friend
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; my familiar friend and we went and ate
[1:25:22] together and we had fellowship together
[1:25:24] and he was at my place and ate my bread
[1:25:27] now the reason why I am speaking this
[1:25:30] you might say well is brother B is
[1:25:32] brother Biscll dealing with some problem
[1:25:34] in the church not not that any that I
[1:25:36] know I just feel this is on my heart
[1:25:39] because actually I'm going to another
[1:25:40] direction we're going to have to turn a
[1:25:42] sharp corner and might do it in another
[1:25:43] service. But this is so vital. This is
[1:25:47] so important because I am interested in
[1:25:50] the strongest possible spiritual body of
[1:25:55] people for I'm jealous over the bride of
[1:25:58] Jesus Christ. And if you take and put
[1:26:01] this into practice, you're going to be a
[1:26:04] powerhouse in your home, in your family,
[1:26:08] in the church of God, because you will
[1:26:11] be beyond offense.
[1:26:13] And we really need to be, we can't wear
[1:26:16] our nerves, you know, uh h and have them
[1:26:19] right on the on the top of our our our
[1:26:22] flesh as it were, hanging out here with
[1:26:25] uh all the sensitivities of what this
[1:26:27] one thinks and what that one said and
[1:26:28] what this one did and that one, you
[1:26:30] know, and I feel, you know, I I I feel
[1:26:32] uncomfortable. I feel intimidated. I
[1:26:34] feel that they don't want me. Da da da
[1:26:35] on and on and on. That's always going to
[1:26:38] be.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And we as believers, we far from us, we
[1:26:44] should say, "Far be it from me to be
[1:26:46] that one who's a familiar friend who
[1:26:49] would lift up my heel." But I want you
[1:26:51] to know that those words can exit our
[1:26:55] mouths that can be extremely hurtful.
[1:26:59] And these things should not be in the
[1:27:03] house of God.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Not amongst believers.
[1:27:06] In other words, to say what should I
[1:27:08] say? Nice things.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; That you say that's your prophet. He
[1:27:15] said say nice things.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know anything nice? That's what
[1:27:19] you want to say. What would you like to
[1:27:21] hear? You know, someone came and met him
[1:27:23] and somebody had got up and gave him a
[1:27:26] compliment and said, "I really enjoyed
[1:27:28] that service." And someone else came up
[1:27:30] and I, "Oh, brother Brandham, I really
[1:27:32] enjoyed that service. I was so blessed
[1:27:34] by that sermon this morning and so on
[1:27:36] and so forth and a man met him. He heard
[1:27:39] these two two persons say that and he
[1:27:41] met him and he and this man says he says
[1:27:44] uh I I don't believe you know he that uh
[1:27:47] person ought to have nice things said
[1:27:49] about them like that boast on them like
[1:27:51] that.
[1:27:53] Brother Bam said, "Well, the only
[1:27:55] difference between us is I'm I'm being
[1:27:57] truthful. I do.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I do." What he was telling is that the
[1:28:02] other man's not being truthful, but he
[1:28:04] said it in a nice way. The only
[1:28:05] difference is I'm being truthful about
[1:28:07] it. I like to have nice things said. All
[1:28:10] of us like to have nice things said
[1:28:11] about us. We'd like to have say, "Well,
[1:28:14] that's you know, honey, that's the best
[1:28:16] pie in in the world. I just that's the
[1:28:19] greatest pie. That's the greatest dinner
[1:28:21] or something else." Or, you know, just
[1:28:22] some little thing. And we like to have
[1:28:24] nice things said.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Of course we do. And if you don't like
[1:28:30] this service when I leave, don't say
[1:28:32] anything to me. Just walk out and shake
[1:28:35] my hand. At least smile.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Say nice things.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He didn't only say it once. He said it
[1:28:42] over and over.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; All right. No one's going to go through
[1:28:50] life without having that experience.
[1:28:53] and uh and perhaps the one that you
[1:28:55] thought was the closest is the one that
[1:28:58] may uh really disappoint you the most.
[1:29:02] Now
[1:29:05] I I return to the scripture where we
[1:29:08] said uh who being the brightness of his
[1:29:11] glory and the express image of his
[1:29:14] person and upholding all things by the
[1:29:16] word of his power. And just before I do,
[1:29:19] I'm going to I I'm going to give you the
[1:29:21] whole quote.
[1:29:23] Uh I have it on the screen and I'm going
[1:29:26] to give you the whole quote. Uh we'll
[1:29:29] probably what we'll do is just go go
[1:29:31] through it completely. Now,
[1:29:34] uh
[1:30:01] Now I want to go to the first one
[1:30:03] please.
[1:30:05] Second the first one up here.
[1:30:18] We can read it together.
[1:30:21] Who being the brightness of his glory,
[1:30:24] the express image of his person, and
[1:30:27] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:30:30] power, when he had by himself purged our
[1:30:34] sins, sat down on the right hand of the
[1:30:37] majesty on high. This Hebrews 1 and3
[1:30:43] death and life are in the power of the
[1:30:46] tongue and they that live it shall eat
[1:30:49] the fruit thereof.
[1:30:54] Now this is the beginning of this quote
[1:30:56] and I have broken it down into
[1:30:58] statements one after the other and so I
[1:31:02] didn't want to leave really anything out
[1:31:03] of it. Brother Bram starts out by saying
[1:31:06] you've got tapes on what we believe.
[1:31:10] You got tapes on discipline in the
[1:31:13] church.
[1:31:15] How we behave ourselves in the church.
[1:31:20] How we got to come here together and set
[1:31:22] together in heavenly places. Set
[1:31:24] together where?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Heavenly places. Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I can't believe a person comes and
[1:31:31] sits in heavenly places and then goes
[1:31:33] out and there's just, oh, some some of
[1:31:36] it's worthless chatter. That'll just
[1:31:38] dissipate anyway. But I wouldn't want
[1:31:40] you to bring condemnation upon yourself
[1:31:43] by saying or speaking something about
[1:31:45] someone else, another brother or sister
[1:31:48] or whoever, minister or deacon or
[1:31:52] whatever. Uh, we we wouldn't want you to
[1:31:54] I'm trying to protect you from that. how
[1:31:56] we got to come together in heavenly
[1:31:58] places. He said, "Don't stay at home."
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't
[1:32:07] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[1:32:10] yonder to get in there to fellowship
[1:32:13] with your brothers.
[1:32:15] If you don't feel that way, then I tell
[1:32:18] you it's time to you got to praying cuz
[1:32:22] we're in the last days where the Bible
[1:32:25] exhorted us to much more as we see the
[1:32:27] day approaching.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; To love one another with Christian love
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; and divine love.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; To love one another with Christian love
[1:32:39] and divine love. Listen friends, you'll
[1:32:41] never have a more vindicated instruction
[1:32:45] than you're getting right this moment
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; to assemble ourselves together in
[1:32:52] heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love
[1:32:56] one another.
[1:32:58] And by this shall all men know that you
[1:33:01] are my disciples if you love one
[1:33:03] another. Jesus said in John 13 and35
[1:33:10] said that's right stay right together.
[1:33:14] Didn't say stay apart.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Stay together.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Now you may have some friends that you
[1:33:21] feel closer to than others, but that
[1:33:24] doesn't mean that every brother and
[1:33:26] sister should have a place in your
[1:33:27] heart.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:33:32] If the brother you think he's a little
[1:33:34] wrong or sister, say, "Lord, don't let
[1:33:36] me ever have the root of bitterness
[1:33:38] spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll
[1:33:42] take the Christ right out of my life."
[1:33:45] Isn't that incredible?
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; That poison acids of malice and jealousy
[1:33:53] and hatred, that'll just take the Holy
[1:33:55] Spirit right away from you.
[1:33:58] It'll run him from the tabernacle here.
[1:34:02] It'll kill the spirit of God or drive it
[1:34:04] away from here, hurt your pastor. It'll
[1:34:07] do everything.
[1:34:10] Don't you do that.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; You just wax that much closer. Now he's
[1:34:20] he's he's described
[1:34:23] uh he's actually described a scenario
[1:34:28] uh in the earlier part. Now he's coming
[1:34:30] with the remedy.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; The remedy for that kind of a scenario.
[1:34:34] And the remedy is you just wax that much
[1:34:37] closer together. Take the buckle that
[1:34:41] buckles on the whole armor of God and
[1:34:44] just put it on. Tighten up. Amen.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Move right up close to one another.
[1:34:52] You know, I could stop right there. Love
[1:34:54] one another. There may be some that you
[1:34:56] hardly ever fellowship with or hardly
[1:34:59] ever get close to. It might be good to
[1:35:03] kind of break the, you know, the
[1:35:06] tradition that you have and actually
[1:35:08] mingle with someone else
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; that you haven't been near
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; and get to know them and get to feel
[1:35:13] their spirit and get to be with them. I
[1:35:16] think that that would be good. And love
[1:35:18] one another anyhow. You know the word
[1:35:21] anyhow.
[1:35:24] It's amazing. I don't know if you read
[1:35:26] the message like I do, but when he says
[1:35:29] love them, love one another anyhow, it
[1:35:33] indicates to me there could be some
[1:35:34] reason not to not to have that kind of
[1:35:37] feeling. But love them anyhow.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; It's more like a Wednesday night, isn't
[1:35:43] it?
[1:35:47] Talk nice about one another. This is the
[1:35:49] remedy. Talk nice about one another. Say
[1:35:52] nice things about one another. You just
[1:35:56] wax that much closer. Said take the
[1:35:58] buckle the buckles. Move right up close
[1:36:00] to one another. I guess talk nice one
[1:36:02] another. Say nice things to one another.
[1:36:05] And then there's the last line. And then
[1:36:08] let's say it together. God will bless
[1:36:12] you. Oh,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; father in heaven,
[1:36:16] bless me.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Have you ever said that? God, bless me.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; And maybe what God is actually answering
[1:36:29] back is say, "How about saying nice
[1:36:30] things?"
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet didn't say, "God will bless
[1:36:34] you. Say nice things about one another."
[1:36:36] He said, "Say say one say nice things
[1:36:38] about one another and then God will
[1:36:39] bless you.
[1:36:43] You going to try it this week?
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Going to try it today.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Just go out and start saying nice things
[1:36:48] about one another, good things about
[1:36:51] them.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; All right, we're over that part.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You can breathe easy now. We're over
[1:37:00] that part.
[1:37:03] Can I have another few minutes? Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:37:09] who being the brightness of his glory
[1:37:11] and the express image of his person and
[1:37:13] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:37:16] power.
[1:37:18] Now, we're just going to take right
[1:37:20] angles for a few moments and I'll
[1:37:21] probably have to finish this at another
[1:37:23] time.
[1:37:28] Not the power of his word, but the word
[1:37:31] of his power.
[1:37:33] The I'd like you to see the power of God
[1:37:35] as a great reservoir.
[1:37:38] Just a great vast reservoir.
[1:37:43] That's his power. But now he has
[1:37:48] he has determined in his sovereign mind
[1:37:51] and will that he will send out a word
[1:37:57] that is authorized
[1:38:02] to demonstrate
[1:38:04] this power.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:38:09] It'll be the word of his power.
[1:38:14] It'll be the authority by which the
[1:38:16] power is exercised
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and it will be that individual or
[1:38:24] individuals or whoever that has that
[1:38:29] access
[1:38:31] to that power.
[1:38:34] Now he says he's upholding all things. I
[1:38:38] need to take you just move you in if
[1:38:41] you'll stay with me please. very close
[1:38:43] in your hold hold your minds right up
[1:38:45] tight to the message if you would. He
[1:38:47] said upholding all things by the word of
[1:38:52] his power. And the upholding is that
[1:38:55] it's not just, you know, I'm I'm I'm
[1:38:58] upholding this this pullpit. No,
[1:39:01] upholding is that he's actually moving
[1:39:04] it. is to take take a hold of something
[1:39:06] and moving it and bearing it carrying it
[1:39:10] and moving it moving it from one
[1:39:13] junction to another from one point to
[1:39:15] another from point A to point B or shall
[1:39:17] I say in this reference he's upholding
[1:39:21] all things by the word of his power he's
[1:39:25] moving and as far as we're here
[1:39:26] concerned this morning he's moving
[1:39:29] mortals he's bearing them carrying them
[1:39:33] from mortal to immortality.
[1:39:37] He's taking us from a hellridden
[1:39:41] uh society,
[1:39:43] from something that's filled with
[1:39:45] impurities
[1:39:46] and violence and filth and injustice of
[1:39:50] every kind. He's moving us upholding it.
[1:39:53] How? How? How? By the word of his power.
[1:39:57] He's moving them from one point to
[1:40:00] another, from one place to another by
[1:40:03] the word of his power. The power is
[1:40:06] there, but he's got to give you the word
[1:40:08] to move you from that place or this
[1:40:10] place to another.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Have you followed that?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; He's carrying you, burying you.
[1:40:20] In the Ephesians,
[1:40:22] the message Ephesians parallels Joshua.
[1:40:25] He said that's Paul's writing.
[1:40:28] That's what he taught his church. The
[1:40:31] church positionally before the
[1:40:33] foundation of the world. He said when
[1:40:35] God, now I'm I'm I'm I'm still on this
[1:40:38] on on this thought of upholding you,
[1:40:41] burying you. He said when God in his
[1:40:44] labor pain, have you ever thought of God
[1:40:47] being in a labor pain? When God in his
[1:40:51] labor pain was bringing forth you
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do he position he
[1:41:01] knew you'd repent when the word came by.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; He knew that you would say Lord Jesus
[1:41:08] forgive me.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; He knew you would agree with the word
[1:41:12] and say I have sinned and come short of
[1:41:15] the glory of God. He knew one day you
[1:41:19] would say that trinitarian doctrine not
[1:41:22] in the scripture. I'm being baptized in
[1:41:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[1:41:27] knew you would come into alignment into
[1:41:30] an agreement with his word. And he knew
[1:41:33] you would repeat what he said. Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; And that's the key
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; to repeat what he said because once once
[1:41:43] you repeat what he said by the same
[1:41:46] spirit, that spirit of God when he sent
[1:41:49] that spirit into you and you repeated it
[1:41:52] and that spirit came to you and began to
[1:41:54] reveal it to you and you spoke it then
[1:41:58] then it went out into the airwaves, the
[1:42:00] eternal airwaves and now now it's there
[1:42:02] forever recorded and you have said the
[1:42:05] word of God.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said it.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous? Jesus said it and
[1:42:14] now you said it.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If we had the
[1:42:19] instruments and they tell me that we
[1:42:21] could be able to do it scientifically is
[1:42:23] to draw the very voice and hear Moses
[1:42:26] speak and hear Jesus speak." Wouldn't it
[1:42:29] be marvelous one day to discover that
[1:42:33] all of your denying and all of your evil
[1:42:37] things actually have been have been
[1:42:40] annihilated by the power of the blood of
[1:42:43] Jesus Christ. And the only thing that
[1:42:45] came through the filter is the things
[1:42:47] that Jesus said and you said.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; The things the prophet said and you said
[1:42:53] it.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; You think that's a fairy tale? That's
[1:42:56] exactly what it is.
[1:42:59] Exactly the truth.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; This isn't a fairy tale. This isn't a
[1:43:03] myth.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; My words today are going out and I
[1:43:07] cannot draw them back. They're going
[1:43:09] out.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad they are.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I'm glad they're recorded.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And the brother Brandham says that in
[1:43:21] the judgment,
[1:43:23] he says, "You you don't have to be
[1:43:26] judged. You will hear your own words.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; You'll hear your own voice.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something if they had a
[1:43:36] court of law?
[1:43:39] And when we think of all the twisting
[1:43:41] and the conniving and and all the
[1:43:45] things that are untrue, which are being
[1:43:47] declared in courts of law, wouldn't it
[1:43:50] be marvelous if they had the equipment
[1:43:52] said, "Just a second. We're going to
[1:43:54] flick enter here and we're going to hear
[1:43:57] your voice.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; We're actually going to hear what you
[1:44:01] said. Wouldn't that be something?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; But God in his labor pain because he was
[1:44:10] bringing you forth. He was upholding
[1:44:12] you.
[1:44:14] That was his and the and the purpose for
[1:44:18] it was that he might present you the
[1:44:21] scripture says faultless.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I know we're sitting here in a Sunday
[1:44:26] morning service but God's intent. I
[1:44:29] don't know what moved you to come to the
[1:44:31] service today. What caused you to be
[1:44:33] here or whoever is on the internet and
[1:44:36] caused you connect but God wants you to
[1:44:38] hear this. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; He wants to demonstrate to you the word
[1:44:43] of his power.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Not the power of his word, but the word
[1:44:47] of his power.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you access to that
[1:44:50] power. If you ever h have if you have
[1:44:53] something that's unforgiven, don't let
[1:44:55] it hang here. Unforgiven. Drop that
[1:44:57] thing. How? With your mouth by
[1:45:00] confession. I did wrong.
[1:45:03] Amen.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Incidentally, friends,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; just to say I'm sorry is not enough.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry is not repentance.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; If I offended you, that's not enough.
[1:45:21] That's not what we're talking about.
[1:45:24] Is to say so, well then what is it? Is
[1:45:28] to say I did wrong.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I sinned against you and I
[1:45:34] sinned against God. I did wrong. The
[1:45:37] word of God says I mustn't do that and I
[1:45:40] want forgiveness.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Then it's confessed.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Can you say amen?
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:45:51] And he that the whole thought is to
[1:45:53] present you faultless.
[1:45:55] Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said, "I'm jealous over you
[1:46:01] with a godly jealousy, for I've espoused
[1:46:03] you to one husband that I may present
[1:46:05] you a chasteed virgin."
[1:46:08] He said in Colossians, "In the body of
[1:46:10] his flesh through death to present you
[1:46:11] holy and unblamable and unreprovable in
[1:46:14] his sight."
[1:46:16] And in Jude, Jude said, "Now unto him
[1:46:19] that is able to keep you from falling
[1:46:21] and to present you faultless before the
[1:46:23] presence of his glory with exceeding
[1:46:27] joy."
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; So what God has promised, he's more than
[1:46:31] able to perform.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Now just for the next few moments and
[1:46:36] I'm going to close because I just will I
[1:46:39] will like to introduce where I'll go the
[1:46:42] next time, the Lord willing. And that is
[1:46:48] to
[1:46:50] uh to profess or to confess. And the
[1:46:55] scripture says he is the high priest
[1:47:00] of your profession or the prophet says
[1:47:04] it's identical to confession. And if you
[1:47:06] look it up, it is your profession or
[1:47:10] your confession.
[1:47:12] I won't give you the quotes right now.
[1:47:13] Perhaps I'll next time I'll be able to
[1:47:14] do it. We've had them here before. He
[1:47:18] actually said that he doesn't move.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Christ as high priest doesn't move
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; about the power of your word
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; until you confess it
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; in another realm that you can't see.
[1:47:37] You talk about
[1:47:39] the word
[1:47:41] of his power. Now, here's the reservoir
[1:47:45] of power.
[1:47:47] Here's forgiveness. Here's healing.
[1:47:50] Here's all the attributes of God. Here's
[1:47:53] everything you're going to need
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; from here to eternity.
[1:48:00] And it hinges on what comes out of your
[1:48:02] mouth. Amen.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; And here's the living Christ at the
[1:48:09] right hand of the majesty on high, ready
[1:48:12] to move, waiting for your confession.
[1:48:18] And if a person says one thing one time,
[1:48:20] now excuse the little uh uh maybe
[1:48:25] juvenile type of example, but if a child
[1:48:28] comes up, you know, you take them into a
[1:48:30] toy store. You take a child into a toy
[1:48:32] store and they say something, "Oh, buy
[1:48:34] me this. I want this." And then they
[1:48:37] forget in just a moment and you go on
[1:48:38] down. Oh, they want this, they want
[1:48:40] that. And it doesn't take long for you
[1:48:42] to decide they don't know what they
[1:48:44] want. You know, next thing they're just
[1:48:46] walking out of the store and they say an
[1:48:48] ice cream cone in the store went, "Oh, I
[1:48:50] want an ice cream cone."
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; So, they don't know what they want.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; You know, God's kids are that way.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; One day we say, "Oh, Lord, I need this.
[1:48:59] I need that." Next day, we've forgotten
[1:49:00] all about that. Now, I need something
[1:49:02] else.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; He just kind of wait till we settle
[1:49:06] down,
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; till we know what we really want.
[1:49:10] But when we come and and we've got to
[1:49:12] focus on what we want and the focus on
[1:49:15] what we need.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:49:18] the
[1:49:20] profession is and here's what it is to
[1:49:22] confess. And I want to I'm just going to
[1:49:26] convey this now. I'm going to be done in
[1:49:27] about another five minutes. to confess
[1:49:30] and you've heard us say it before and
[1:49:32] actually the Greek terminology is this
[1:49:35] is to say the same thing as another.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to remember that. Write it
[1:49:43] down. It's to say the same thing as
[1:49:47] another.
[1:49:49] There are
[1:49:51] many many believers of this message
[1:49:56] who will say I am a believer of this
[1:50:00] message. I believe that God sent this
[1:50:03] prophet confirmed message but on the
[1:50:07] other hand fail to say the same thing
[1:50:11] that he said when it comes to
[1:50:14] confession. And I'm going to give you by
[1:50:16] God's help, not today, the next time.
[1:50:19] I'm going to give you things that I
[1:50:21] think you need to repeat.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Things he said that we need to repeat.
[1:50:28] We need to say it again and again. We
[1:50:32] need to repeat it over and over.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; How can a person remain depressed?
[1:50:42] Have you ever found where the prophet
[1:50:45] said, I believe we should say we're
[1:50:47] depressed.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; I'm so stressed out.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Like one person said, that's Paul's
[1:51:00] letter to Deuteronomy.
[1:51:05] It doesn't exist. I'm so stressed out.
[1:51:07] I'm so this. And we go on and on. I
[1:51:11] think I'll throw in the towel. I can't
[1:51:13] go another day. Thus says who?
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; You're not repeating. And all that's
[1:51:20] gone into the air and it all is out
[1:51:22] there. But it it it's it's not any of
[1:51:25] the words of God. You're not repeating
[1:51:28] God's word. It is actually worthless
[1:51:30] chatter, but it's being destructive to
[1:51:33] yourself.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; You're defeating your own purpose.
[1:51:37] totally defeating your own purpose. Can
[1:51:40] this congregation say amen?
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Because now, and here it is. I'm closing
[1:51:48] with this.
[1:51:50] We didn't before this message come, we
[1:51:53] didn't know what to repeat.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; We didn't have anything worthy to
[1:51:59] repeat. People read the Bible but that
[1:52:02] there was no witness of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:04] of the truth and the reality of it. And
[1:52:07] then when a when a prophet come and the
[1:52:09] message is vindicated, thus saith the
[1:52:12] Lord, then for the first time you can
[1:52:15] say, "Thanks be to God. I got something
[1:52:17] I can repeat."
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An apostle Paul is saying by
[1:52:23] the confession of your mouth by the
[1:52:26] profession and the word is simply say
[1:52:29] the same thing as another person said
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; and they said and if he said thus sayeth
[1:52:35] the lord you have such and such a
[1:52:36] disease you come from such and such a
[1:52:38] place and so on and the person saying
[1:52:41] it's true it's true it's true that's
[1:52:43] fine then the next thing is comes to
[1:52:45] comes to the scripture
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; and the scripture says he's drawing out
[1:52:51] a bride
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; and this bride is a virgin bride and
[1:52:56] this bride is a spotless bride. Those
[1:52:59] are things worthy of repeating.
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; With a sense I am included.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; I am part of this company.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; He said he come to an elect group to the
[1:53:12] elect lady that Paul wrote about. You
[1:53:14] say the elect lady. The elect lady.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; I'm part of that group because he called
[1:53:21] me. I'm part of the elect lady.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Soon as you start feeling say I'm so
[1:53:26] stressed out. Change it.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Say I'm part of the elect lady.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Isn't that a whole lot better?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; I'm so despondent. I I think I need some
[1:53:36] anti-depressant. You need some gospels
[1:53:39] is what you need.
[1:53:42] We finally had we finally had uh some
[1:53:45] words now come the confirmed words by
[1:53:49] God himself that were worthy of
[1:53:52] repeating.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. I said I was a minister
[1:53:59] before I met brother Bradom. I was a
[1:54:01] minister and I didn't I had to baptize
[1:54:03] five people. I didn't know how to
[1:54:06] baptize them. One of them was Sister
[1:54:08] Cindy Bergen's dad.
[1:54:11] He was a deacon in our church and had to
[1:54:14] baptize him. I asked somebody, "Have
[1:54:16] you,
[1:54:20] do you know how brother Vandom baptizer?
[1:54:21] Do you ever know what he said?" We
[1:54:23] didn't have any tape or any any word on
[1:54:25] it at all. I mean, nothing. I said, "You
[1:54:29] know, I got to baptize these people."
[1:54:34] I had good friends who says, "It's Jesus
[1:54:36] name only." Just Jesus name. Here's the
[1:54:40] scripture. Here's this. Here's Okay. His
[1:54:43] name Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You
[1:54:44] don't do them. Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
[1:54:45] You're disobeying Jesus. I don't want to
[1:54:48] disobey Jesus.
[1:54:50] In the book of Acts, they did it in the
[1:54:52] name of the Lord. In the name of the
[1:54:53] Lord. Goodness. The name of the Lord.
[1:54:55] Got three recipes.
[1:54:57] Some says three times down went to South
[1:55:00] Africa. Said bury them for every time
[1:55:03] they every time you can remember a sin.
[1:55:06] They almost almost drowned one guy.
[1:55:10] They did. In fact, it was Sister Linda
[1:55:12] Marissa's dad that went down and says,
[1:55:14] "You're going to drown him."
[1:55:18] That every time he came up, he'd
[1:55:20] remember another sin.
[1:55:24] And so, what was I going to do? What are
[1:55:26] you going to repeat? What are you going
[1:55:28] to say? And finally, you have thus
[1:55:31] sayeth the Lord.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; And I heard I read it the other day. He
[1:55:34] said, "If you've never been baptized in
[1:55:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:55:40] you've never been baptized in the name
[1:55:41] of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
[1:55:43] Because the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:55:45] name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:55:48] Oh, didn't that come simple? Now, that's
[1:55:50] why we can go to the water all the time
[1:55:52] and repeat it.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad since then, I've been
[1:55:56] repeating it.
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:02] Well, I hope you take some of this meat
[1:56:04] and potatoes.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Sister Cindy Bergen's dad,
[1:56:10] she's a little bit like him, but he's
[1:56:11] even worse
[1:56:17] and he's big and tall
[1:56:20] and muscular
[1:56:23] and the water is ice cold. If it hadn't
[1:56:25] been flowing, I think it would have been
[1:56:27] frozen.
[1:56:29] Brother, you know the river Kiss Catnel
[1:56:31] River.
[1:56:33] I said, uh, and the water's muddy and
[1:56:36] flowing and cold. We set up two tents
[1:56:40] for the sister and the brothers to
[1:56:42] change her clothes.
[1:56:45] And so I I had I had to scheme this
[1:56:47] thing out. So I figured I got to put
[1:56:49] these and all them one was about 6'6
[1:56:52] and I have to put all these fellas,
[1:56:54] three of them over about 6'2. Had to put
[1:56:57] them down the water. So I I figure out
[1:56:59] my mind I'm going to lay them down
[1:57:00] upstream.
[1:57:04] So when I lift them up, Brother Randy, I
[1:57:05] have the stream to help me.
[1:57:09] And then I had another idea to make it
[1:57:12] even easier. I'm going to have these
[1:57:14] tall fellas kneel down in the water
[1:57:17] and it just be a little dip for me. So
[1:57:20] Tommy was the first one, Sister Cindy
[1:57:23] Bergen's dad. I said, and I just said to
[1:57:26] him, "Now, Brother Tommy, I'm going to
[1:57:29] baptize you upstream." So, I have the
[1:57:31] stream to help me. And we're going down
[1:57:33] to the water. And he says, "When I said,
[1:57:36] when we get down there, I want you to
[1:57:39] kneel."
[1:57:40] Oh, no. No. He says, "You're going all
[1:57:43] the way with me." He said,
[1:57:47] I said, "No." I said, "It'll make it a
[1:57:48] lot easier for me, Tommy, if you just It
[1:57:50] make a lot easier if you'll just kneel
[1:57:52] down." And he was a strong man. He
[1:57:56] worked on the heavy equipment. He put
[1:57:58] his fingers in my arm right here. And he
[1:58:01] was right behind me. And he just kept
[1:58:03] moving me right into the river.
[1:58:06] I wasn't leading him. He was actually
[1:58:08] carrying me in the water till I started
[1:58:11] to become buoyant. And I said, "Tommy,
[1:58:13] is it far this far? Not this far."
[1:58:17] He only had to go in the water once. I
[1:58:20] had to go in there five times. I went in
[1:58:23] one color and I came out purple. It was
[1:58:26] cold. But you know, God heard me
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; because I finally I had found out what I
[1:58:32] was supposed to repeat over those
[1:58:34] people. I was able to baptize them in
[1:58:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:58:39] someday
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; we'll hear those words again.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They'll never be lost.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Glad you're baptized, Brother Roger.
[1:58:51] You're glad you're baptized in his name.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we are so grateful. Our
[1:58:59] hearts are filled with a with a
[1:59:02] gratitude and a thanksgiving
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; that you have given us, oh God, a clear
[1:59:07] path
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; and a very clear sound, a voice that was
[1:59:14] so confirmed, so vindicated. and we're
[1:59:17] unashamed, oh God, of the word that you
[1:59:20] have given us. We thank you for it. I
[1:59:22] pray that you'll take these words that
[1:59:24] have been spoken today and these
[1:59:27] experiences and you'll make it a
[1:59:29] blessing to the people in the name of
[1:59:31] the Lord Jesus Christ. For your glory, I
[1:59:34] ask it. Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Is it all right?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers. I was able
[1:59:44] to preach this morning. Uh, I wonder,
[1:59:47] brother Rod, if you could come and help
[1:59:49] us with a song if you would please.
[1:59:54] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:01] Enjoy it.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; You got power in your words, friends.
[2:00:05] Absolutely. I hope you take it to heart
[2:00:08] to such a degree that it'll just be a
[2:00:11] seal upon your lips.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:14] Let's just stand to our feet.
[2:00:19] I'd like to just sing the song that we
[2:00:21] sang at the start. Father in heaven,
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; just lift it up now.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Father in heaven,
[2:00:31] we love you,
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Lord. We lift your name above all the
[2:00:39] earth.
[2:00:41] Oh, let your kingom be established
[2:00:46] in our praises
[2:00:49] as your people declare your mighty word.
[2:00:56] Blessed be the Lord
[2:01:00] God
[2:01:01] Almighty.
[2:01:05] who is and to God.
[2:01:11] Blessed be the Lord
[2:01:17] mighty

[2:01:28] Bless blessed beord
[2:01:35] mighty
[2:01:39] who was and is to

[2:01:46] the
[2:01:50] mighty
[2:01:52] [Music]
[2:01:54] who lives forever. ever.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to bow our heads,
[2:02:03] going to do business.
[2:02:07] I'm sure that every honest heart, every
[2:02:09] honest person would say, you know,
[2:02:12] Brother Ed, before God and in the
[2:02:15] presence of the Holy Spirit, I certainly
[2:02:19] have uttered things out from my mouth
[2:02:22] that I'm sorry I have. I really am
[2:02:25] sorry. And and God, you have spoken to
[2:02:28] me today. You've used this these simple
[2:02:32] truths. You've used these quotes. You've
[2:02:34] used these scriptures. And I want to
[2:02:37] drop this ink into the bleach at this
[2:02:41] moment. I want to drop it in. And the
[2:02:43] only way I can drop it in is make a
[2:02:45] confession. And I'm taking this time
[2:02:48] now, Lord. I'm taking this moment. And
[2:02:51] to you precious believers, my brothers
[2:02:53] and sisters,
[2:02:56] I'll give you that opportunity.
[2:02:58] We can just pray together. And I'm going
[2:03:01] to pray.
[2:03:03] I believe that God will bless you
[2:03:06] immensely for acting upon the word of
[2:03:10] God as the Holy Spirit is uh urging you
[2:03:16] to do so. Father,
[2:03:20] and I I I trust the people, you're not
[2:03:22] ashamed now. Just be open about it.
[2:03:26] Lord, I pray that you will
[2:03:29] see us now in this moment.
[2:03:32] We are now seeking to act. And not only
[2:03:34] seeking to act, we are acting upon your
[2:03:37] word. And Lord, I like all others
[2:03:41] have spoken things and uttered things
[2:03:43] I'm ashamed of. I don't want to say
[2:03:46] those things. And so I'm asking just now
[2:03:50] you'll take them as I confess them and
[2:03:53] put it and drop it down into the
[2:03:55] chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:59] And every sin I don't have to pray it'll
[2:04:01] be forgiven. I know it'll be forgiven
[2:04:04] and I know it'll be broken up. It will
[2:04:06] be taken us it will be taken and
[2:04:08] dispensed with. it will be annihilated
[2:04:11] and it can never never come back into
[2:04:14] the memory of God again. Father, let
[2:04:17] there be a mighty cleansing and sweeping
[2:04:20] throughout the whole audience. And
[2:04:21] wherever my voice is going or will go in
[2:04:24] the future, I pray it'll have the same
[2:04:26] effect. For I ask it in the name of
[2:04:29] Jesus Christ. Let the mighty Holy Spirit
[2:04:32] move and breathe now upon every life, oh
[2:04:35] God. And show your pleasure, show your
[2:04:38] good pleasure upon the people by
[2:04:40] blessing them immensely today for their
[2:04:44] for not only for their action, but for
[2:04:46] their obedience, Lord, to the to the
[2:04:49] compelling of the Holy Spirit and the
[2:04:51] urging of the Holy Ghost. And father, I
[2:04:54] pray that you'll bring sweet fellowship
[2:04:56] that perhaps didn't exist before. That
[2:04:59] you'll cause, oh God, to people to
[2:05:01] reverse their pattern and their way of
[2:05:04] life, uh, reverse their conversation.
[2:05:07] And, Father, you'll put a check upon it
[2:05:09] in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray
[2:05:12] you'll bring such a glory cloud upon the
[2:05:15] people at the service tonight. Lord,
[2:05:17] will be a be something where the
[2:05:19] minister can scarcely preach. Oh God, we
[2:05:22] want your presence and your nearness.
[2:05:25] And now I pray you'll go with us.
[2:05:29] Strengthen us as we dismiss from one
[2:05:33] another, but we're not dismissed from
[2:05:35] your presence in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:05:39] Amen. And just before you go, I want to
[2:05:42] sing pleasing. It's been one of my
[2:05:45] favorite courses, pleasing. And I trust
[2:05:48] that's exactly the word that's on your
[2:05:50] heart. Let's lift it up to him, shall
[2:05:51] we? Pleasing. And then we're all
[2:05:53] dismissed.
[2:05:55] Easing
[2:05:58] [Music]

[2:07:27] one another with a good godly handshake?
[2:07:30] Say the best thing that you can say.
[2:07:32] Lord willing, we say this evening. God
[2:07:34] bless you.
[2:07:36] Amen. God bless you.
[2:07:41] [Music]
