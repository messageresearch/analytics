[Music] There is faith in my prayer. [Music] There is rest in the storm. Oh, [Music] nothing can harm me standing here in his will.

Oh, [Music] thank you Jesus that there is rest in the storm. There is faith in my pray. [Music] There is rest in the storm. [Music] Hallelujah. There is rest in the storm. Hallelujah. Do you feel like an eagle this morning? &gt;&gt; You just want to press above the clouds. &gt;&gt; Get up there and set your wings this morning. And why don't we stand together as we invite our pastor to come sing together. Master of the wind. I know the master of the wind. The maker of the rain. I know the master of the wind. [Music] I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm and make the sun shine again. [Music] I know the master of the wind. I'm glad I know. I know the master of the wind. I know [Music] the sun shining. I know it just one more time. I know. I know. Heat. Heat. [Music] Make the sun shine again. I know the master of [Music] uh I I have some a few things to say just before we read the scripture. We don't have the faith challenge report available for everyone as yet, but it is printed and and uh some have gone down with brother Tim Dodd uh to the ministers. He's having not a minister's meeting, but a young men's meeting and with brother Barry Coffee and and however many gather there. They've had them for a few years. Uh so they're having that and then he will be in Murphy'sboro. But as soon as they're available, you want to have this copy. &gt;&gt; Pardon? &gt;&gt; They have. Oh, all right. I know they talked about them Wednesday. Yeah. All right. So, how many have their copy? The rest of you, be sure and get your copy and read it from cover to cover. Wouldn't you rather say so? Yes, sir. And uh it is it it's wonderful for a lot of reasons. It this is uh it speaks about the Bible. It speaks about the radio broadcast in Uganda and uh pictures of a number of people who have come to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Uh through the radio broadcast, it also deals with brother Danny Ferris. uh he's pastoring in uh Gintall, Manitoba and he's he's been going up and made several trips to Mongolia. So it it it covers the efforts of other people in the in the message and that is just really wonderful. So you want to be sure and get your copy of that. I want to thank you, brother Joseph Walner. Uh I I use that word when I say Joseph. It's very formal for the prayer. Thank you. I I was listening to the prayers you were praying and I want to thank you for that. Um I I wanted to catch uh first time I've ever done it. I wanted to run out and uh catch a deacon hopefully and so I could uh put my offering in the offering basket. And uh this also was the first time. Where's Brother David Law? I saw him. Brother David right there. Brother David, why don't you stand up, folks? There's Brother David Laws. Thank you, brother David. Uh because it this this doesn't happen every day, but uh I I came to put my offering in and I got rewarded by seeing brother David coming down the foyer and uh uh we just uh instinctively put our arms out and had a great big hug. And we're going to do that on the other side, brother David. Just before we sit down to the marriage supper. Amen. That was a really wonderful experience. Uh we have too much to say to talk about that. Met also brother Jerry Harter. Where's Brother Jerry? &gt;&gt; All right. Yes. Brother Jerry, you can you can stand now. The way I said it that way was because there was a time not too long ago he had a hard time standing and uh he's uh his hips are well and we're really happy over that. Brother Jerry, God bless you. God bless you. Nice to have brother Aaron and sister Jessica back. Uh I missed you, brother Aaron. My printer is not working. And uh he already knows that, so it wasn't a surprise. Brother John and Sister Sharon, it was nice to have them back. And I think was your father and mom with you? &gt;&gt; They weren't with you. Oh, that's too bad. Anyway, a he text that the hurricane was coming down in Mexico and I was saying, "Well, you don't want to go up in the rapture that way." Anyhow, we have it may be a whirlwind of some sort, but it won't be necessarily one that struck Mexico. uh this this morning I wish to uh provide you with quite a bit of material and there's one person you need to pray for and that is not only for myself but you pray for yourself and pray that God will help you to put everything together in a certain order. Thank you, brother, for the song. Brother Ryan, for the song and everything, and the musicians can have their seats. All right. Uh, I'm going to provide you with uh quite a bit of material and scriptures. And I I I want you to pray and pray earnestly that God will help you to uh that that God will assemble it for you and provide you with that portion of the word that will be eternal. I was thinking uh of the people that have difficulty with brother Brandham and the message. But you know, if I were you or if I were those that may be listening on the internet, I would consider this one thing that the God he was speaking of was pleased to come and be in attendance with him &gt;&gt; while he expressed those thoughts. And if there's any thoughts that uh you might have or that you might tend to have, I would certainly advise and counsel that we come into harmony with what God was not ashamed to come in behind. When he would come in behind and and and confirm those thoughts, you or you might say, "Well, I don't know if he was confirming it." Well, that's fine, too. That's a that's a a justifiable perhaps thought or question. But nevertheless, the fact is that God did come in behind it and did confirm it with supernatural. And if you believe in a supernatural God, I suggest it was best that we agree with what he agreed with and say, "Well, you were not ashamed of this. I better not be ashamed of it. You agreed in the order of what was being said. I think I will better I better I'd be best a agree with the order of it. I want to speak to you today uh Lord willing on good and evil and I have a double a double title and the second part of the title is beware the snare. Uh so if you wish to stand, I'm going to read out of Genesis 2 and we will read just three verses and then have prayer and you'll have your seat. H how many don't know what a snare is? Well, that's wonderful. Looks like 100% know what it is. You might not know the snare that uh say the trappers use up north. And I will just say a couple of things about it. They always put a snare in the path or in the way where an animal always goes, where he runs for his food or he goes down to the water or wherever he's got a well marked out pathway which is his regular thing. Uh that's where a snare is laid. A snare is quite often out of fine wire which is not really visible and then it's concealed or veiled or covered over with. So it looks just exactly like it's untouched and uh and that's where a snare is laid. Uh uh I I'll be coming to these points later on and and it may take a a trapper or a fowler which is called he will deliver me from the fowler. Same thing. Uh, it may take a trapper or a or a uh someone laying a snare may take them ever so long to determine where exactly how and then to fit it and lay it. In the scripture, we'll I'm going to read quite a few scriptures. In the scripture, you'll find that sometimes God allowed uh snares allowed the enemy to lay a snare. And to surprise you, God has even laid snares. Uh, and it may take centuries, may take months, may take years to lay the snare, but it only takes a second to snap it. &gt;&gt; And uh, so you want to be mindful of that while we speak about these things. I want to read this scripture. Genesis 2 7-9. And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils, the breath of life, and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, it's such a glorious and wonderful moment to be gathered with your people and those that have connected and those that are on the internet streaming, those that are gathered in other assemblies and wherever they may be on the earth and it may be in a different time zone, but I pray that the bride of Jesus Christ will be immensely blessed. Oh God, by the word that they hear from the men that you have directed to be there for them. And we hear, Lord, we need to hear your word. Uh we need to have the Holy Ghost. Place it in order and place it in our hearts. Do anchor something, Father, that will be spoken this morning and this evening with Brother John Andes. do anchor something in our hearts, oh God, as you did with myself, Father, as I listened to Brother Tom minister the last service. And and we just thank you, oh God, that we have the message and the messenger. We are we are not ashamed to say we thank you for standing and vindicating and being in full attendance and and demonstrating to us these supernatural things. And thank you for eyesight, Lord, that we're not blinded to these things. So many are, and we don't understand why, but we pray that you will give such clarity of sight, grant determination, and Father, strengthen any weak spot within our lives or testimony. And now anoint is each one, Father, myself, and the people that will listen in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. All right, I have some slides. I'll just going to show the first couple here. If we can dim the lights, please. There are two trees in Eden. Number one, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The good part in the tree of knowledge did not come from the tree of life. As I'll be dealing with, there are people that are fine, people that are good. There's good qualities. There's good character. There's good. Having hospitals is good. Having all kinds of things in life which are good. But it's not eternal life. &gt;&gt; We want to make that distinction. At this at all this present civilization came excuse the spelling from the tree of knowledge and therefore tends towards death. Only the Holy Spirit of God only the Holy Spirit of God can discern between the good and the evil. Good things very often develop into a snare unless a person is under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; A snare can be a long time in the preparation but suddenly trips at some point. I would like to also read some scriptures and have you read them with me. Thou shalt not these are just various scriptures throughout the scripture. I want I throughout the Bible. I want to leave these uh give these to you as bit of a foundation that we might draw on and some things I want you to notice. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods. They're not our gods. &gt;&gt; Never were our gods. &gt;&gt; It's their gods. &gt;&gt; But what God is speaking to his people is we don't bow down. And when you you you're not going to rid the country. You're not going to rid the population of their gods because they have the things. But you will not fall down or bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and uh quite break down their images. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me. For if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. Brother Brandham's ministry actually broke on the scene in what is commonly known as the um charismatic movement. How many have heard of the charismatic movement? Raise your hands once more all over. Good. Charismatic movement was when walls of denominationalism began to go down. And brother Brown speaks about even uh the pre his appreciation for the Christian businessmen international the Christian businessmen because they they disregarded any walls of denominationalism and people gathered and and brother Brandham was often with groups and people on the platform that were from all different you know shades of of denominationalism. and he appreciated that. uh but on the other hand there was a huge uh shall I say frailty amongst the people and that was that people who had a say a high standard of holiness and so on then they begin to see oh all these people are accepted they're coming in they're speaking in tongues and they're worshiping they're singing the same chourses and we all worship together and so on so forth that never I won't say it never, but it did not tend to lift those from, shall I say, lower spiritual experiences to a higher experience. Rather, it took those those that were uh of of, you know, maybe very very strict churches, etc., etc., if they didn't have it in their heart, they quickly went down. And and I saw that. I saw it myself. In fact is I I was in a church in Toronto and we just went there because it was one where things were really happening etc etc and when I came to the church there two of the ministers were standing on the on the backst step having a cigarette and uh I didn't know what was going to happen so I went in had some fellowship in the area and then we went into the sanctuary and those two men got up to give the people communion and I just said to my wife I said, "These men will never give me the Lord's table." And I said, "I'm going to walk out of here." And all five of us got up and walked out in the midst of their communion. And uh uh whatever it meant to them, that's between them and God. But I that was the end of it for myself. And I I was really startled that I people that I knew had such a a godly conviction. And then they saw, oh, you know, the women they they've gone back to their they I guess I can go back to my paint and my Max Factor and all of these things because God's accepting them. And that was a huge failing. &gt;&gt; Thou they shall not dwell in thy land. &gt;&gt; Lest they make thee sin against me. For if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee, and thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee, uh shall deliver thee. Thine eye shall have no pity upon them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, for that will be a snare unto thee. Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. That was into into Judges the second chapter. And Gideon made an Ephod, Ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ofra, and all Israel went thither a whuring after it, which thing became a snare unto Gideon and to his house. I just want to stop there for a moment. I would not have spoke I would not have even stopped here except last night we had just a quick invitation and we had to be ready in about 30 minutes and brother Mark and Sister Rachel Matul asked us if we'd like to just go out and have a bite and it was really wonderful and while we were speaking they said you know we've been reading in Joshua and then we finished Joshua and we went on into Judges and I thought oh boy I've been into Judge es and uh so I just thought I'd just let them talk about it and then they got into Judges and they said and then we we I said did you get to Gideon? Oh yes, that's where we are right now. And so I went to this scripture here and that Gideon made an ephon. She says well that's what we were just reading said Rachel. That's just what we were reading. So I thought well maybe I will say something about it because in in Gideon as you know Gideon was a mighty man of valor and he was visited by the angel of the Lord and uh and he he chose uh some men to go fighting with them. And he was he was the one that had incredible victories for God. And he was the one that went with 300 men and had them and defeated the Midianites. And when he had done that, after he had defeated the Midianites, they came back and all the people rejoicing and so on. So the people rose up and said, "We want you to be over us and your son after you and your household after you." They were so enthralled with this huge victory that was wrought by Gideon and his faith. And he said, "I will not rule over you and my son will not rule over you and my household will not rule over you. The Lord will rule over you." And then he said, "But I'll ask you, I'll make a request." And that's what he says. I request of you one thing. That is the the people that you take the earrings because the men wore earrings and you'll take the gold earrings from the prey, those that you have defeated and you break off those earrings. And the Bible says they spread out cloth and robes and uh they and and the people said, "Oh, they would willingly happily do that." And they broke off the earrings from their prey, their captives, and and threw them down also the great necklaces that were on the camels. And the war royal robes of the kings and princes, and they threw it all down, and the weight of the gold was 1,700 shekels. And I that then then Gideon took that and make made an aphod. Now an ephod in the Old Testament in the in Exodus and so on, the ephod was a magnificent shoulder type of garment that came over the shoulders of the priests and it had precious stones in it and so on and sometime was made out of gold thread and so on so forth. There's a difference of opinion uh as to what this ephod was. I couldn't find anything that brother Brandham said specifically about it other than that they were usually a robe. But this ephod must have been the thought is that this ephod must have been a an object or an idol of some sort or something because and he placed it in his city and the bible says the people came a whuring after it. Now he wouldn't rule over the people and his household. He said, "My household shall not rule over you. God shall rule over you." So the but the people came bowing to this and giving whatever kind of attentional and o obesence to it and uh and uh and and it was a a they were committing like an harlotry adultery with this thing. They were just giving it such a place in there and it became a snare. It became a snare because it took him away from God. And after that uh Gideon was he had a big family. He had 70 sons and he had one by a concubine. And the one that raised up by the concubine actually up as as soon as Gideon had passed away, the son that he had had by a concubine, he raised up and he went to his people, his mother's family and so on, and said, you know, we're brethren and so on. If you strengthen me, I want to go and slay the sons of Gideon. And the thing certainly became a huge snare because the very you know from then on they just had terrible turmoil. So so the fact the lesson here is that the fact that you know God does great things for a person and and opens our eyes and we have great victories and so on so forth. Don't ever forget we still need the leadership of the Holy Spirit. We cannot that's where it takes the Holy Spirit to guide an individual so that we have that leadership of the Holy Spirit so we don't allow something to become a snare to us or to our families or to our church or whatever more. Now I'm not dwelling I'm not dwelling so much on that even though it will sound that way. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence, David said, and he certainly knew what that was all about. Heaven and earth shall pass away, Jesus said, but my words shall not pass away. And take heed, this is the next verse, and take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged or overweighted. overcharged, overweighted with surfetting and drunkenness and cares of this life. And so that day come upon you unawares. Now I know that surfeting and drunkenness is not a problem amongst believers but the cares of life certainly is and there isn't anyone. So these things certainly fit into uh uh our realm and I'm going to try to make it very uh much alive into where we live today and and surfing and drunkenness and cares of this life. So and so that day come upon you unawares or suddenly. And the Bible says, "For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth." You know, the first computer, for example, and this is this will bring it right up to date. first computer I s saw a picture of it on Google and the thing looks like uh the they said it had about the intelligence and calculating ability of a brick and that was about it and uh the only thing I could recognize was some white keys on it and uh the first computer actually took up two entire floors I think of the Empire State Empire State Building in New York and it was made for military purposes That's what computers were originally made for, for for computer purposes. And it wasn't too too too too long ago that people never dreamed that they would be uh uh you know, you using one. But not only are you using one, children are using them. Your children are using them. All kinds of people. Were they good or are they good? Well, yeah, there are they are there is a you know I use one all the time. I use it to study. I am very very at the same time I'm very aware that Satan has certainly taken a hold of it and has captivated minds and people are tapping all kinds of things and all kinds of messages. It is uh it's a very evil device. It is also a very huge time waster. &gt;&gt; Now, if you want to say amen, go ahead. And and it is a valuable device. I'm happy I can go online and and book a flight and go on a jet, which has been all of these things actually came from the tree of knowledge. Civilization as we know it has come from the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; I wrote some things down at random. Uh the world the system of civilization uh what science and civilization have in store for you. Brother Brham asked what does science and civilization have in store for you? And he said, "More death." &gt;&gt; Uh, that's in things that are to be, &gt;&gt; things that seemingly we so enjoy. And I will read this quote a little later on. Things that seemingly we so enjoy and things that seem so needful. I have added civilization inventions uh and but civilization increases in pressures and softness of life. &gt;&gt; Is it true? &gt;&gt; Civilization has moved things and science has formed or fashioned designed that is a refinement and the refinement becomes a trap. You don't believe that or do you? &gt;&gt; Very few saw or put this put their hands on uh the first computer I have put here. Today everyone has one can tap out a text can do formulas in Excel etc. Uh makes younger people wise. The world is in a The world is in a trap. That's is that's in the Greek word for it for snare. Setting the trap or the snare may take uh but it's it may take a long time but it snaps suddenly and the world will develop something by science so needful and so attractive, so helpful and so timesaving, laborsaving. Yet the element of death is veiled behind the veil of its beauty. &gt;&gt; I believe that's true. &gt;&gt; I believe that was inspired. &gt;&gt; God also has taken years and even centuries to bring a savior attribute &gt;&gt; and then he came suddenly to his temple &gt;&gt; and he caught the people in a trap. He caught them right where they were &gt;&gt; and then they the trap was they had to deal with it &gt;&gt; and the world just moved along and moved along moved along and suddenly came the seventh messenger &gt;&gt; and broke on the scene and with with incredible things that were indisputable &gt;&gt; they had to be glad &gt;&gt; and when you hold a child and it's all crippled up and then it begins to crack and the bones begin to straighten out and the child becomes absolutely whole right there in front of the people. Who's going to deny that? &gt;&gt; And did it take a long time coming? No. It it just suddenly but the but the Christians or the believers or the whatever on Plymouth Rock, the early fathers that landed on Plymouth Rock or or arrived, they came for they came for Christian liberty. But now look how things had developed until and God laid a trap really for America and snap. &gt;&gt; And here it is. &gt;&gt; Now you have to make a decision. &gt;&gt; Is it of God or isn't it of God? &gt;&gt; And I've even said to people who want to be real doubters and find all kinds of problem. I said, "Well, look, look, be a real be a real man. Be a just say it's of the devil." No, no. Oh, no. They don't want to do that. Well, then what kind of person are you? It's either of God or it's not of God. If it's not of God, it's of the devil. &gt;&gt; No, they don't want to go that far. Then then the person should say it's of God. &gt;&gt; Can't be halfway in. It's not It's not a mix between the tree of knowledge and the tree of life. The tree of life is Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Thank you. For the day of the Lord will come suddenly and it will come as a snare upon all. I was reading where brother Brandham talked about the world council of churches and how they would swallow up the churches. When he was saying that they had very few members. The first meeting of the World Council of Churches was in 1948. It's a very significant year. The message was just breaking on the scene also at the same time while they were forming. How how perfect that is. And so I thought I would just, you know, go once on the on on Google and search out how many members they have uh today. When he when he was speaking that there was very few, but he said they're going to swallow up the world. These are the members. Page one that goes from A to S to C rather C to E. These are two columns on every page. All member. These are not churches. These are member groups. that goes to pee several hundreds of them and a man stands on the platform and says they'll all go there &gt;&gt; and I can tell you as I stand here they're about there &gt;&gt; and the same voice says repeating the words of Jesus and as a snare it'll come upon the whole world you thankful &gt;&gt; for a message to prepare our hearts and to caution us and that is different from the world. Aren't you thankful for something that's different from the world? I know that you are. God bless you. Now, I like to just carry on. Please, I'll be saying some of the same things. The uh you can take those off the slide now, please. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And uh I would like to just continue on to say that our civilization and standard of life that we enjoy is the product of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; We we're going to go out of the church. We're going to get in our cars. We're going to turn on the heater on or whatever uh defrost button and we're just you know this. It's so much a part of life. It is so infiltrated and and I will I would like to add this and I may not be able to make it as clear as I would like to but the good we need a a person needs the Holy Ghost. We need the Holy Spirit each day in our lives because what what what where the good begins to merge into evil, &gt;&gt; we need the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit right there to know a job is good. &gt;&gt; A job can become a trap. &gt;&gt; An education is good. And we may go in education for years. Education is good. But it will give you a better job, better position, whatever more. But an education can also be a huge trap. &gt;&gt; Uh let not the gods of the world be our gods. &gt;&gt; They have nothing to do with us. &gt;&gt; That's their gods. &gt;&gt; They serve them. all the pleasure and all the uh whether the sports world and the entertainment world and and uh I wanted to find out a few things about the good life. &gt;&gt; You know America is identified with the good life. uh that term is actually attributed to Aristotle who was be he was born before Christ. Uh the good life a philosopher a philosophical term for the life that one would like to live originally associated with Aristotle. Aristotle's philosophy not only provided man with a system of reasoning but also touched upon ethics. He prescribed a moral code of conduct for what he called good living. He asserted that good living to some degree defied the more restrictive laws of logic since the real world poses circumstances poses circumstances that can present a conflict of personal values. I'm not going to bore you just two three more lines. That said, it was up to the individual to reason cautiously while developing his or her own judgment. That's a winner. Then I just went to the end of the article. I wanted to know his death and legacy in 3:22 BC. just a year after he fled to a a city in Greece on an island to escape prosecution under charges of impiiety. And I searched to find out what his act of impiiety was, but it's I couldn't find where it was recorded. Aristotle contracted a disease of the digestive organs and died. That's the end of it. uh the 20th century. The 20th century in human history, now we're up to in more to our time, was dominated by World War I and World War II, nationalism and decolonization, the Cold War and the postcold war conflicts con uh cultural homogeniz homogenization through developments in transportation and communication. You know what? There's something good. I'm I'm sure that it's not going to be very long before one of you pick up a phone. Is it bad? Could be. What if we say, "Well, it's good." Well, where does the good end? &gt;&gt; And where does the evil begin? &gt;&gt; You're going to need the Holy Ghost. There's no way that you can sort that out &gt;&gt; outside of that &gt;&gt; and technology and world population growth, awareness of environmental degradation and the birth of the digital revolution. Uh it saw great advances in communication and medical technology that by the late 1980s de uh uh allowed for near instantaneous worldwide computer communication and genetic moda modification of life. And we're told that both civilization and culture are modern words. The two words are derived from ancient Latin. The word civilization is based on the Latin civus or inhabited in a city. Don't look at me like that cuz most of you live in some kind of a city or gathering. It says that this civilization in its most essential meaning meaning is the ability of people to live together harmoniously in cities or in social groups. And yet this civilization that we're in, I have a article here that says in the 20th century more people died. More people died in the 20th century than all the history of man put together. And you have a prophet standing and saying this civilization is death. &gt;&gt; And you could just sense people raise up and they don't like to hear that. That happens to be the truth. no matter how associated, no matter how much in love we are with uh you know whatever whatever and and and and I literally have dealt with people who worship the God of education &gt;&gt; and yet we're not against education because brother Benam would say and I will certainly say as well uh we we're not here in support of ignorance. We have a school and we're so thankful for Holy Ghost people &gt;&gt; that would give their lives and we're thankful for those that have home homeschooled and do homeschool. Uh I was thinking of the uh brother and sister Haynes. Uh God bless you. You raised a wonderful family and uh and I understand sister Haynes is homeschooled. I have not spoken to her directly about it but I believe that they have. I understand that brother Andy's son and his wife uh have a whole group, a homeschooling group that have gathered, you know, have some association together. And uh what what are people trying to do? They're trying to make their way through this civilization and hold a good standard. And we're not just talking about a good standard. Remember that is as good as it can be. It did not come from the tree of life. &gt;&gt; This message came from the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you have eternal life, it came from the tree of life. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't got it, I would toss everything aside to gain eternal life. &gt;&gt; As a young man said to Jesus, "What good thing must I do to inherit eternal life?" And the Bible says Jesus loved him. &gt;&gt; He come running to the master. What good thing must I do to inherit eternal life? You do this, this, this, and obey the do the commandments. All of these have I done. And yet what lack I sell all thou hast and give it to the poor. And he went away saddened because he had and brother Brandham says he turned down eternal life. A woman who perhaps you wouldn't want as your neighbor came to a well and met a man. And this woman did not have a good record in this community. She'd gone through five marriages and now was living with another that was not her husband. and she meets a man. But the one thing I want to take I could I you you can read it and you know it very well yourself. And here God himself directs a messenger in support of his own message to that very woman &gt;&gt; and began to speak to her and she had questions. We all have questions. &gt;&gt; And he had she had questions about worship. But he first he took the three steps through the body and the spirit realm and the soul. And then he said, "Give me a drink just for the body." That's as far as that goes. And she says, "What relationship should we be having? The Jews don't have any communication with the Samaritans." And she was a Samaritan. He said, "But if you knew who I was, you'd ask me for a drink." and she's still just using the natural well the well is deep and you don't have anything to draw with and you know and he said if you knew who it was you'd ask me for a drink I give you a wa I give you water you'll never thirst again and she's still into this water here how will you give me Jacob our father Jacob drank of this well and so on and he said you'd never thirst again she said sir g give me this water. And that's what brother Brandham says to us. Live salty. &gt;&gt; Live salty and make your friends, make your unsaved family thirsty. &gt;&gt; Just by your life. &gt;&gt; He wasn't there thundering out a big message to her. &gt;&gt; He was just living a life and telling her what it was he possessed. She said, "Give me this water." and she still is in the naturals that I never I I I don't have to come back here to draw. That wasn't it. And he ignored it. He said, "Go and get your husband." That was the key. I'm sure her eyes flashed because he just like a dagger went right to her problem. Sir, I perceive that you're a prophet. That was good. Not far enough. He said, "Go and get your husband." She said, he said, "In that you have said is true, and who you have now is not your husband." Who who which one of you would want her as your neighbor? But here's the Messiah himself desiring not this woman, but that eternal seed that was in her. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was moving from the spirit. Now he's in the spirit. She said, "The Jews say we should worship in Jerusalem and the Samaritans say we should worship in this mountain." And she just came up with the confusion. There's all kinds of confusion in this world. How many people in the churches? All kinds of confusion. This is what they believe and this is what they believe and this is what somebody else believes. &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; It's way beyond that. This message is way beyond that. And she said, "I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things." And he said, "I that speak to them, he'" He didn't have to explain a whole bunch of things and prove a whole bunch of things. She dropped her water pot, ran into a city, said, "Is this not the Messiah? &gt;&gt; Is this the Messiah?" The priests couldn't catch it. &gt;&gt; The priests couldn't catch it. the Sadducees and the Pharisees couldn't catch it. But here is a woman that that we in the natural would think really really has uh uh has failed in natural life. But I tell you what, in eternal life, she didn't fail. &gt;&gt; Isn't this the Messiah? &gt;&gt; And friends, today this message, isn't this Messiah? Isn't this Messiah who reveals the secret of your heart? Isn't this Messiah? Is this just some books? Is this just some translations or transcriptions that have been transcribed? Or is it something more? &gt;&gt; I'm asking you, is it something more? &gt;&gt; To me, it's been Messiah. And I thought today I'll stand here and declare to you who I believe this is. &gt;&gt; This is Messiah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And many want to say, "Well, I think that that's gone too far." Well, that's very fine. That's very fine. Go where you wish to go with it. But as far as I'm concerned, the woman at the well, she wouldn't have got what she got. And the and the prophet of God speaks about her and said she was elected and she had that predestinated seed. and the and and and when and when the priest was confronted with it, he said Belub. &gt;&gt; When she was confronted with it, she said Messiah. &gt;&gt; That's the difference, friends. &gt;&gt; There's no gray space here. &gt;&gt; It's either Belub or Messiah. &gt;&gt; I say that word, &gt;&gt; that word that God vindicated, the author of life, &gt;&gt; that has to be that has to be Messiah. &gt;&gt; He has sent a word to catch you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Said an Ephesian church age ever keep in mind and I'm going to try to be I'm not going to be long long. I'm going to go as far as I can and then just stop. Ever keep in mind that religion said spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as black and white. Religion and the spiritual world are made of those two trees which had their roots in Eden. Both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined with one another. He said further that Leodysian he said the name Leodysia the people's rights or justice of the peoples was there ever an age like the 20th century the 20th century church that has seen all nations rising up and demanding equality social socially and financially. This is the age of communists where all men are supposed to supposedly equal though it is only so in theory. The and uh one of the articles I read said that this the 20th century was the age of exceeding an explosion of wealth amongst certain wealthy nations. Genesis 4:17 said, "And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch, not the Enoch that was translated, Enoch, and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch." And that was the beginning. And brother Vanna refers to the science and the uh the the whole musical world. I was wanting to find out what I could find out about the good life. Are you weary? &gt;&gt; Can I carry on? &gt;&gt; And so I thought I would just Google Wikipedia is supposed to have everything. So you go to Wikipedia. Do you know what it starts off with? entertainment, movies, music, and I went through a whole big long list and came to the end and the whole thing was trash from beginning to end. &gt;&gt; The whole thing is lies from beginning to end. &gt;&gt; And that's what they started off as the good life. If that's a good life, they can have it. &gt;&gt; They can fill her belly full of it. &gt;&gt; I want nothing to do with that trash. You talk about a snare. &gt;&gt; Talk about a snare. Is this true, friends? &gt;&gt; And this kind of I'm not I'm I'm not even intending on stepping on on any toes, but if it does, just don't say out. Say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the God of this evil age is Satan, God of this age, by his knowledge getting the people to eat from the from his mixed his mixed tree of good and evil. His mixed tree &gt;&gt; of good and evil. Listen friends, this enemy is just too subtle, &gt;&gt; too deceiving. And if he would deceive the very elect, if possible, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Is a very cunning enemy. &gt;&gt; Don't ever think through our human intellect we can overcome that we need the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He says that he is building a greater Christian civilization by his knowledge of good and evil. a greater Christian civilization in redemption by now I want to move to living the good life and redemption by power in prayer brother Brandham says oh God this may be the last hour this may be the last chance that men will receive many no doubt are sitting here men and women who desired whose life who's lived just a normal good life but never have been born again doesn't know what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit a complete surrendered life with all the shame bashfulness taken from them and God's spirit baptize them into his mercy isn't that wonderful &gt;&gt; I say oh God that's what anybody would desire said you you say well I don't drink brother Brano I don't smoke. I don't gamble. I wouldn't run out on my husband or my wife. I live a good life. But the devil has perverted that. &gt;&gt; He lets you think to satisfy your guilty conscience that you join a church or you're all right. That's wrong. That's perverting. And then Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. This was actually in Grand Prairie, Alberta, and I happen to be sitting on the platform when this message was preached. I'm sorry I don't remember more of it. I'm actually ashamed I don't remember more of it, but I was sitting on the platform in Grand Prairie, Alberta. He said, "Today we go to a service. We act like we're going to a funeral service to pay honor to the dead instead of worship and hail a conqueror. &gt;&gt; You can say amen as I say this. &gt;&gt; Christ conquered death. &gt;&gt; He conquered hell. &gt;&gt; He conquered the grave. &gt;&gt; He conquered sin. &gt;&gt; He conquered sickness. &gt;&gt; We are hailing a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Not someone died thousands of years ago that lived a good life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like perhaps Mr. Aristotle did, I don't know, or Plato or someone else. And yet they will make those things and make them almost as idols and idolatry and you've got to study this. How come you don't have to study the message or study some godly godly? How come you don't have to study the Bible? Why isn't the Bible a key item in the UBC or in in in the Western University in in Bellingham or Seattle or the University of Miami where brother Toby came from? Why isn't it a key item? &gt;&gt; Some philosopher that died centuries ago whose body is nothing but a bunch of asses. Jesus never corrupted. His tomb is empty. I've been there. It's empty. He's a conqueror of death. &gt;&gt; Conqueror of hell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Could come and stand beside a man redeemed like you're redeemed like I've been redeemed by his grace and mercy and stand by him and do the supernatural in front of our eyes or in front of our ears within our earshot. You can hear it. You can hear him speak to my family friend uh Sister Clint. &gt;&gt; You can hear him say, "You're praying for a man. He's not from the city." You can hear it. &gt;&gt; Perhaps you need to hear it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bisc sitting on the platform right there while while she's standing and he's and the prophet's talking to her several feet away from her. And you're praying for a man. He's not from this city. He's from another another place. I believe it's called Fort St. John. It was like he was reading it. We drove past the man's house. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The next morning &gt;&gt; and as we were driving by, he said, "I believe there was a woman praying for a man dying with cancer here." And I said, "Oh," I was all caught up. I said, "Oh, Brother Brandham is a a dear friend of our family, very well known, our family." He never he never smiled. He never said anything. We were just driving past and as we were driving past the place was passing us. He said the man's put his hand behind my head. The man's in that house. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You can you can think what what maybe passed through my mind. I'm being very very honest. I thought, "How do I know he's in that house?" &gt;&gt; You say, "Did you think that?" No, the devil did. and he had access to my mind. So, he just let it shot through my mind. Then I get about 400 miles up the highway and I'm trying to tell brother Southwick all about, you know, this kind of ministry that this is, he doesn't know Genesis from Revelation. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to tell him about it. I said, you know, you know that big old white house just before you turn into Fort St. John. I said, you know, Brother Brandham says, the man's in that house. He says, well, I know him. He said, I've known him ever since I've been about 8 years old. He said, "And he is dying with cancer." Not too terribly long ago, I decided to Google his name and he died. This was in May. He died in July of that year. Brother Bram never said, "Thus said the Lord is healed." I was very, very alert, but I knew knew her so well. So I wanted to know what he did say and he just told her to go and believe and God bless you and the man died. It wasn't it wasn't it was it wasn't the case for him but there were others. &gt;&gt; There were others. There's a a man standing very very dignified Bible school teacher standing right beside me and uh brother Brandham had a whole row of people maybe 40 50 in front of him and he's standing there and just while he's standing there I'll just do what happened. He says the boy will be all right. while he's standing talking to people just cries out the boy will be all right over his shoulder like that and this man tall dignified Paul Cornish was his name he was a very very dignified man he was a pastor of the church right there and he just went like this like that and he was shaking and convulsing with tears instantly like he'd been hit with a hammer And I I I didn't know what was happening. All I hear is this voice and something power some force. I I I'm I'm in an absolute dilemma. I don't I don't understand what's happening. And here's this man who's a very dignified man folded right over and convulsing in tears. And when he straightens up, he stands beside me. He's a little taller than myself and a little older. And he touches me and he says, "Brother Eddie," he said, "You see down the prayer line way down towards the back?" Didn't look like they'd ever get there to him. He said, "See that young man there?" He said, "That's my son, and he's up for a serious operation this next week." And here, just caught like that, the boy will be all right. What am I supposed What am I supposed to do with those things? &gt;&gt; You tell me. What am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to declare them? Should I declare them? &gt;&gt; I'm happy to declare them. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to hear it? &gt;&gt; These things are true. &gt;&gt; How does a man from Jeffersonville know the boy's going to be all right? Right. &gt;&gt; How does he know the woman's praying for a man 40 40 50 miles up the road dying with cancer and he lives in that white house and brother Bud Southweight knows him and has known him since he was a child. Who knows that? &gt;&gt; I would say it would be good for us to be in tune with that kind of wisdom. &gt;&gt; It would be good for us to be in tune with that kind of thought. And that thought never came from the tree of knowledge. That thought never came out of a scholarship out of a university and never came out of a a seminary, never came out of a denomination. &gt;&gt; I would sooner have that man say a prophet never came out of a denomination ever came. &gt;&gt; He said, "And when they denominated, they died." And I would just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; I want to be tapped into life. And not only life, life is good. I'm alive now, but this body is dying. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to have eternal life through the knowledge, the tree of knowledge, &gt;&gt; even though it's good. &gt;&gt; And there's all kinds of And the good part of it simply relates to this life. &gt;&gt; That's all. It just relates to this life. &gt;&gt; And I'm not only interested in this life, friends. It passes too quickly. &gt;&gt; There's too much suffering. There's too much pain. There's &gt;&gt; too much trouble. &gt;&gt; Who wants this life? &gt;&gt; Is that not so? &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, well, let's it's it's good." Don't forget what's good came from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And anything that came from it and everything that came from it is perishing &gt;&gt; and will die. And will die. I'll say it one more time. And will die. &gt;&gt; So glad and so thankful we can be tied into. And behold, one came and said to Jesus, said unto him, Good Master, good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? And he said unto him, why callst thou me good? It's a question. Why callst thou me good? There is none good, but one, that is God. What is he saying? There's none good but God. &gt;&gt; And he's the source of eternal life. &gt;&gt; God that fills all time and space. I want that kind of God that's the fountain of all wisdom, divine wisdom. I want a God that's a fountain of all holiness. There's nothing much holy here, is there? And he said unto him, "Why callst thou me good? There is none good but one that is God. And if thou will enter into life, keep the commandments." And he said, "All of these I I've kept." Good in the Greek thought is that which is good, excellent, distinguished, upright, and honorable. And that is all fine. Those are all words which would describe this life. But I would say good needs to be eternal life. Oh, God is good. &gt;&gt; But we don't think of him in relationship to, you know, jobs and my bills are paid. And that's not the good we're talking about. We're talking about the good &gt;&gt; that when no one left on this earth can hold your hand or forgive your sins, you have met one. And the guilt is gone. &gt;&gt; Friends, that's what has to happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Born again. &gt;&gt; Can I take a few more minutes? If it is not understood, if this is not understood, believers can find themselves unnecessarily entangled or ens snared in many difficulties. And the reason why I said I was going to provide material because you can't define you know everybody's situation is entirely different and God will lead a person differently and you need the Holy Spirit to lead you in this life &gt;&gt; whether it be in job whether it be in education whether it be in uh success or whether it be in what the world may consider failure. Uh, you may be unemployed right now. That's fine. You can have I I think maybe the woman was unemployed. I don't know. She found a place with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; She had a conversation with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ stopped for her. &gt;&gt; Sat on the well for her. You don't ever find that happening with a queen &gt;&gt; or with royalty &gt;&gt; or celebrities &gt;&gt; or all these women that are made goddesses of Hollywood and are facing on all of the magazines when you come to pay at the cash register for your food. Listen friends, is this is this true or not true? &gt;&gt; That's what I want to know. Jesus, did Jesus have time? If if they would repent, he'll have time for them. But I don't I don't want to get into predestination. It is under if it is understood, this subject needs to be understood by believers otherwise they can find themselves unnecessarily entangled or ins snared in many difficulties. The good from this tree did not originate from the tree of life. And here's the quote. In this world that we live in, this education, science, civilization, when I say education, I am not anti-education. I believe in education, but I believe that a person needs the Holy Spirit to guide them. &gt;&gt; Some of you are in business. You need the Holy Ghost to guide you in business, to guide you in a job, to guide you in a marriage. cannot ever be a trap or a snare to guide you in your peers with your relationships and who you are with and who you are close to in this world we live in this education, science, civilization and all these things that we seemingly so enjoy today is of Satan. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And will perish. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You believe that? We need and we must have the leadership and discernment of the Holy Ghost to to discern between that which is good &gt;&gt; and that which is evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, and now I'm continuing on with the quote. You say, brother Brandham, civilization. Yes, sir. This civilization came by Satan. And that's why I said what I have said up to this time about civilization and all the things that we have and all the trappings that we have. Number one, I I hope you forgive me on one hand, but we have to have it. We have to have certain things. I've got to get out and I got to drive in my old car. You say, "Old car?" Yeah, it's an old car. I I need to drive home. I need to have a bite to eat and we'll need it to drive back to the service. And don't you? &gt;&gt; But is it is there anything eternal or anything that's going to gain you? No, I won't say it. I have asked I have asked people who had all kinds of degrees and we have people here that have all kinds of degrees and I honor them and I respect that. Don't ever think that I don't. I do. But I said to one person who actually was giving up the message to get all of this and I said once you achieve it I said are you going to paper your walls with the degrees and then I said the time will come now I'm across the desk from you. The time will come when trouble will come and you'll need to call upon God. &gt;&gt; I said, are you going to fall down before those degrees and those certificates and say, "Oh my gods. &gt;&gt; I need you now." &gt;&gt; Is that going to happen? That same person called me on the phone later and said, "I have a lump in my breast and I have cancer." I didn't want to be facitious and say, "Why don't you call to your certificates?" &gt;&gt; What's that going to do? And another time was even worse. You know, I'm I'm being honest and I'm being very very forthright. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what we achieve in this life. &gt;&gt; I know what I know what the world the world will throw promotions and throw degrees and throw things. That's fine. Get get them all. Get all that you can, but hold it under the leadership of the Holy Spirit. He's the only one that knows what to do with it. &gt;&gt; I'll just take a few more minutes and then I'm going to close. He says, "The kingdom of God will not have automobiles." Thank God. &gt;&gt; Thank God. Not have airplanes. Thank God. &gt;&gt; I'm sure there's a lot of people in Russia right now who would like to say, "Thank God." &gt;&gt; Won't have airplanes. There are they're in grief. They're in agony over the many over the hundreds, 224 that were killed on the Sinai Desert on a Russian airplane that went down yesterday. won't have airplanes or any scientific achievements. No, it won't have any education at all. It'll be an education so supreme to this &gt;&gt; that this won't even be thought of &gt;&gt; education, civilization, and all of this comes from Satan. And having said all of that, we not we are not opposed to the good and all that the good can be that good can be that you can attain to in this life. That's fine. Let God must be the head and the director and in control of all of it. &gt;&gt; You believe me? power of transformation. So God in this his great kingdom that is to come we will have we will have a civilization but it'll not be anything like this. It won't be by science. It'll be by faith. Civilization by the word. This scientific civilization we have is exactly Satan's trap. this church and all who hear my voice on the internet or ever will hear my voice needs to say amen in full agreement to that statement that uh uh it's exactly Satan's trap. &gt;&gt; And that's what he has that's what he has killed the people with. That's what he is killing us every day with. That's how as we eat uh each day instead of living we die. Is that true? &gt;&gt; At some point in time you know you're getting stronger and your youth and all all all those things. It doesn't need to be but it can be a trap. Young ladies born with beauty. Brother Brandham actually felt sorry for some said because there the beauty was given to you by God. Youth young men was given to you by God but it's fading away and over a period of time it'll vanish &gt;&gt; and you'll be like me or someone like that you know it'll change. Oh, thank God for eternal life. &gt;&gt; Thank God for eternal life. &gt;&gt; And he said, "They have so perverted everything to even take just so much of this and mix it with this and hybrid this and that till it's dying. It's a dying race." Now, the good from the tree. Are you still with me a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Paul said, Apostle Paul said, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part or we preach in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." When I was a child, when I was a child, I understood as a child that wasn't evil. When I was a when I was a child, &gt;&gt; I understood as a child. Maybe it was foolish. You didn't. Maybe. Hey, you're not even on the right planet, boy. Was it evil? No. No. He understood as a child. When I was a child, I understood as a child. And I spake as a child. I understood as a child. I thought as a child. And when I became a man, I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; The child part wasn't evil part. Wasn't evil. It was good. It was wonderful. We all had our youth and our childhood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad I was a kid. You get a big joke out of these things. You know, I I I was I was a boy when the war was on, and I thought, boy, you know, all I could think about was men in uniform and soldiers and guns and artillery and so on. They came into our town. I was just going down the down the alley and they came into our town, Brother John, uh with the big trucks pulling artillery weapons behind them and I thought the war had reached here. I went screaming home that they're here, the soldiers are here, and guns are here and everything. And so I was so obsessed with this. My dad had a pile of kindling. I've never told this, and I don't want you to ever repeat it. My dad had a pile of kindling. So I got out by the wood wood in the kindling and I started I took a axe or the hammer the head of the axe I can't remember which and I started pinging pounding one stick of kindling. Oh that looks so strong and I pile I drove down another one another one. I made it like a rug like a carpet out from the single just solid. It was so strong. I thought boy if the enemy ever drops a bomb here will it ever surprise them? It won't do a thing. When I was a child, I thought as a child, but when I put up I I'm glad I got to be a man could put away those things. I don't think that a few sticks of kindling are ever going to stop a bomb. But but I I I just I I felt so good that I had made this so protected. Wow. If the enemy ever comes here, won't they ever be surprised that drop a bomb here won't do a thing? Well, I finally have I finally have something with some authority behind it. Says they could drop an a bomb &gt;&gt; and won't do a thing before that first bomb drops. Bride's gone. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I sooner believe that. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said this, "Send your children to school and get education and so forth." But I'll tell you right now, it won't do them any good in the world that's to come. Well, I got a degree here. What have I got over here? Uh, how much faith do you have? &gt;&gt; How much faith did you exercise? He says it won't do them any good in the world that's to come because there'll be another civilization so far above this. He said education is all right very fine thing and we need it. God knows that. But we need salvation worse than we need education. &gt;&gt; You all agree with that. &gt;&gt; Get all that you can. But we need salvation worse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be sitting here today and you're concerned about, you know, your studies or where you're going to get. Just be concerned about your soul and &gt;&gt; where you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what I get troubled about is when I ask God for things and it doesn't seem to happen. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. and pray over things that seem desperately desperately needful. I didn't know that it was going to be this way, Brother David Law. I didn't know that you'd be sitting in this service, but the kind of intelligence and I'm going to say this publicly, our brother David Laws was dying and he was actually in the grip which wasn't known at the moment with flesheating disease. Is this all right, brother David? Have your permission. and his mother and dad came and were sitting in the waiting room because the hospital and medical people didn't expect him to live. Sister Violet, his wife who's sitting there now looking at me, she all remained such a stalart woman of faith. just continued on. And I went in and David's mother and dad were sitting there. He's in ICU. He's been unconscious and has not come to. And the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said, "Go and tell David that he shall rise and stand in the company of the saints and give glory to God." &gt;&gt; Now, I'll tell you this publicly because David is here to to confirm. Sister Violet is here to confirm. I couldn't go in till Violet came out. And she came out come into the little waiting room just a little we waiting room with just a few chairs and I see you and Langley and I walked in. I walked in beside David's bed and he has no remembrance or recollection of this that I he has told me. and I put my hand upon the stainless steel railing on the bed and he was laying there had never been awake. He opened his eyes, smiled, said, "Hi, brother Ed." I said, "How are you, Brother David?" We said, "I've been I was kind of wanting to see you." And I said, "Brother David, just a moment." I said, "I met you in the foyer of the church and I knew that your heart was heavy. I knew you wanted to talk to me, but I have a message for you." I said, "God has told me, you shall rise and stand in the company of the saints and give glory to God." That man rose. They sent him from that hospital downtown to one of the major hospitals because they couldn't do anything more for him. And that hospital said he just kept living and they might as well just send him back. They sent him back and four months later he stood behind this pulpit that you're looking at and gave glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of education. That's the kind of I don't know how, but that's the kind of God &gt;&gt; I want to serve. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God that deserves our all young men. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God. &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget it. That's the kind of God. Why does he do that? I don't know. But he does it for his glory. Brother David, Sister Violet, we're here to give him glory. Even if it is this last time, I want to give him glory. These things are from him. &gt;&gt; We've prayed for other things and and uh perhaps God doesn't do it and he can be silent and the prophet says even silence is an answer. &gt;&gt; God has a right to be silent. &gt;&gt; So he may not say anything but when he does things it's for his glory. &gt;&gt; It's not for the glory of any man or any preacher or anything else or not any church or any building or any other name. It's for his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Does this congregation say amen for that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of that's the kind of things that come from the tree of life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not the tree of knowledge. &gt;&gt; And with that, I'm going to close. Oh God. Oh God. We want more of it. Lord, &gt;&gt; we need more of it. &gt;&gt; We want to see your hand move. Oh God. &gt;&gt; We want to see. How many hunger for that? &gt;&gt; You hunger for that. eternal thing. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, there's friends, there is a supernatural aspect. I don't want it to miss us. I don't want to miss it. &gt;&gt; I want to say the supernatural &gt;&gt; in this congregation, &gt;&gt; the supernatural in your homes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, come on the scene. We want to see the supernatural in our lives. We have needs, oh God. We have needs, Father. We have needs for the supernatural. And we pray, oh God, you'll find it. you'll find us uh uh willing and surrendered and prepared to receive from you, Father, as I've taken and spoken of you and spoken of what your messenger has said and spoken, oh God, out of the scriptures and have talked to the people today from my heart. And now we have here, Father, and I did not expect it to be this way, but we have here our brother David Law. Oh God, I want to forever give you glory over what you have done. You had a purpose in doing it. And perhaps this was part of the purpose. I do not know. But let it anchor in the people's hearts. I pray for our young men and our young women, oh God, that you'll guide them by the Holy Spirit. And there'll be such a baptism of the Holy Ghost in in the individual lives. Father, let them hunger and thirst after you until, Father, they have the confidence, "My God shall lead me, and they might say with the with the King David, that he who he he shall deliver me from the from the snare of the fowler, the hunter might be in the in every area of life. the hunter and the fowlers in every area of life. But we defy that enemy. We defy his deceit. We defy of false and unbelief. We defy the doubt in the name of Jesus Christ. Grant faith, oh God. Make this people a people of faith. May they be stalwart. Father in uh in the supernatural things we ask for the perfect faith of Jesus Christ. Oh God. Oh God. I pray father that we might have the we might express oh God the simplicity and the faith of Jesus Christ. Come amongst them. Oh God. We can never be satisfied to drink to stagnation waters of stagnation. We will not live in the past. We will not live in history. We will not live in the ancients. Oh God, but we need a God that's a God of the current moment. A God that's a God with the children, with the teachers, Father, in this school of BCA, oh God, in the other colleges of higher learning where they may go, may they never have, oh Father, their faith diluted. I pray in the name of Jesus, you'll rise us up above being a church. May we be a Holy Ghost people, Father, in the blessed name of Jesus Christ. And to glorify that name is my prayer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amazing grace. Brother Derek, you can come please. Thank you. Amazing gra. [Music] I was [Music] I see.
