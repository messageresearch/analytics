TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Come by here my Lord. Come by. Let's make this our prayer this evening. Oh, come by him, my Lord. Come by him. Oh, come by here my Lord. Come by him. Oh Lord, come here. Someone pray Lord for pray Lord. Won't you come by here? Meet our needs, oh God. Oh someone praying, Lord, won't you come by? [Music] Oh my heart. Oh, come by here. Oh, come by. Speak to me, my Lord. Oh, sing to me my Lord. Come my [Music] to be my Lord. of my name. Oh, sweet my Lord, come by. Oh, come by. Blessing again. Speak to me, my Lord. Speak to me my Lord. [Applause] Speak to me my come by. Oh, speak God to me Lord come by. [Music] Oh Lord, come by. Hallelujah. This is what we want to have happen right now. Speak to me, Lord. Speak to me individually, oh God. Tell me the words I need to hear, oh God. Speak words of life and light and deliverance. Blessed be your holy name. Wonderful Lord Jesus. Why don't we all stand? We're going to be turning to the word right away. I failed to bring a request uh earlier. So we will pray for sister Una Featherstone just before we uh minister as well. And her mother is actually uh passing away pretty much at this time. And she's elderly, 89 years old. But of course, she doesn't want to see her suffer. And uh she's also praying concerning her granddaughter who she desires custody of so she can raise her in a spiritual atmosphere and that it's coming up on the 22nd 21st 22nd of this month September and uh we just want to pray that God will give her the strength and the wisdom and the spiritual fortitude. It takes real spiritual endurance these days. And so we're praying for that. Also, Brother Gido from Belgium who uh brother Richard Drake has been working very closely with brother Gido and Men of Vision been sending over a lot of materials and resources to Siberia. Uh and brother Gido has made many many trips to Siberia. I don't in fact say as he just got back once again. He makes several trips a year and he just got back and he called because he will be coming here to visit us uh November the 6th, Sunday, November the 6th. He'll actually be here Friday night. I'm not announcing it just yet, but we may well postpone the Wednesday meeting and put it up to Friday so we can have a couple of uh services with him. I know that you'll be keen to hear and the things that are happening and he has he has not been backward at all to put out on his email mailing which is very very extensive these uh work and the support that men of vision have done. Probably some of them know more about it than we do right here at your own congregation. But uh he said in fact that some of the directors of the orphanages and schools over there had said to him men of vision are the first group that have really stood behind and did what they said they would do. And so we're real thankful for uh brother Richard Drake's devotion and determination to see that uh his portion of this work happens. We're really thankful for that. And we want to be remembering also our brother Madden and his sister's father who's in the hospital. Did they give him a pacemaker today, brother Madden? Tomorrow, tomorrow. Uh they called the family yesterday morning to the hospital early, not knowing whether the father would make it. And uh they they gave him some examination. They thought his arteries were plugged and turned out his arteries were completely clear and so that is really uh a wonderful thing. So they they said they were going to give him a pacemaker cuz his heart is weak. There was a wonderful testimony. I I just said a little bit about uh Benjamin Dertie and is Benjamin here tonight? I imagine he is. But I gave a little bit. Yes. I I just gave a little bit of the testimony of what God did for brother Benjamin and uh a young man met me outside the in the foyer of the church at brother Ron Spencer's. He said that was such a blessing to me. He said uh and I could see that his speech was just just uh slightly tainted, you know, and uh slightly affected. And so he told me, he said, "I was I was away from God. I was running rebellious against God." And uh he said, "I I knew in my heart that I should be serving God. I wanted to, but I couldn't do it. I was just bound. I was just going." You just held bent. That's all. He just held bent. Had a mother and father praying for him. They were standing right there while he was telling the testimony. And he said, "I had an accident." He said in fact is that day I prayed and said God whatever it takes for me to make heaven my home. Whatever it takes do it. And that day he had an accident at a terrific speed on an on a motorcycle and broke over 20 bones in his body, including his neck and many other of his bones and shattered his backbone and all the rest of it. He was he was in such a terrible state and he was unconscious and they couldn't they couldn't do nothing for him. And the doctor said to the parents, "We're just going to we're just going to kind of tend to him and sew him up a little bit because we can't do anything. He's just in such a terrible condition. He's he's he he's as good as gone." And uh in about 3 days, he refused to die in 3 days. And when the doctors saw they had five doctors and the finest specialists in the country and all five of those doctors said he'll never live. Brother Joel heard the testimony in three days he still was breathing had not come to and they said he's not dying we better try to do something and they started to work on him and he came out of his coma came out of his coma and he knew that God had dealt with him and he was done with sin he was done with the world and that they said he'll will never work. He'll never survive. His his brain and everything has been damaged. Got three great big blood spots on his brain. And in sight of in sight of just a short period of time, there were just three pinpoints on his brain. And his neck was healed. His whole body is healed. But he still shows signs of it. Still showed just signs of it. And he went, they said, and finally they kept adjusting themselves. They said, "Well, he will never be able to work at least for a year." And he was back working 3 months. [Applause] Amen. So, you know, God's supernatural &gt;&gt; and he's doing these things and we're so happy for it. And I'm just hearing I just want you to know we're not going to we're not going to give up on this easy. I want you to know that I'm getting emails from pastors all over the country from different places that there are people who are either in the camp meeting or somebody has communicated with them and they're hearing what's happening and they're just saying let it break out all over. Amen. It's not for it's not isolated to one place or exclusive to one place. It's for it's for the bride of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once more. Speak to me, Lord. Speak to me, my Lord. Come to me, my Lord. Oh. Oh, God. [Music] My heart. Oh Lord. Lovely Lord Jesus, the reality of your presence is so wonderful. We've been reing in it today. Thanking you for your presence here now tonight. And we're asking, Lord, that you'll just do something special once again. Lord, touch our lives, touch our hearts. Let the wind and breeze of the Holy Spirit blow upon the flame, oh God. Let the flame remain strong and burning, oh God, that others may see it, and that it may catch a fire in someone else's heart. Lord, create a desire, oh God. I pray as we have contact with one another and look upon one another's face, we're so delighted to see the glory of God. Lord, I pray that you will cause me to say the words that need to be said tonight and you'll just convey, oh God, what thought that you would have conveyed. Bless the people, I pray. Lord, may the mighty wave of God just continue to roll us and straight on into the rapture. We pray. We sense it, Lord. We feel it, Lord. We sense that excitement and that move of God. Oh, Holy Spirit, take control. We haven't seen the end of this yet, Lord. Perhaps this is just the beginning of it. Oh, God. Do abundantly above all we could ask or think in Jesus Christ's name. We're praying for Satuna Featherstone, praying for the prayer request that she has made known, oh God, for her mother. Lord, we would pray above all things that the woman would speak to you concerning her soul, Lord, and receive you, oh God. I pray, Father, for her other burdens. I ask that you will meet them and strengthen her, oh God. Strengthen her faith. And may she stand stalwart for the things she knows true. Lord, I pray, oh God, that your service tonight, Lord, will be your service, your word, oh God, and make it known to us, Lord, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. as you take your Bibles, please, and turn to Genesis the uh 12th chapter. And it's just wonderful to see all you young people, these Bibles out. Praise the Lord. What good is a fighting army if they don't have any weapons? &gt;&gt; Amen. Nice to have brother Dalton back even though he says he's just here for a few days. Well, we don't know. We're not going to pray for the war to erupt again, but we'll be happy when he's here done his session over there. Amen. Andre and Rickart, because brother Rickart's right in uh Washington DC, so they got to come down and spend the time in the meetings and really really happy. And Nathan was in Florida and he came up and was in the meetings and God's moving. God's working. Hallelujah. All right, we're going to read. Thank you for standing and being patient. Genesis 12. We're starting at verse one. And the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great nation. I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him, and Abram was 70 and 5 years old when he departed out of Haron. Verse 7. And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said unto and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land, and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him. And he removed from thence unto a mountain in the east of Bethl, and pitched his tent, having Bethl on the west, and I on the east. And there he builded an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. Amen. You may be seated. Uh now I'm I'm carrying right on uh with the things that God has been doing. So all the the service is really a continuation from the camp time and prior to the camp time. And I feel that God is what God is doing. We haven't seen uh we haven't seen near of everything that he's that he's doing. And so the services are going to be very very much uh uh pointed in that direction. And Sunday, we're having the Lord's Supper and foot washing because I'm sure that there are some of the young ladies and young men who perhaps have not felt uh at at liberty to take the communion or the Lord's uh Lord's table, footwashing. Uh and perhaps you have, but it will it will mean something entirely different to you this time. It'll be different because we're building on your experience. We're building on what God has already done. And you're going to do it this time. And I want you to be saying even from tonight, Wednesday night forward, I'm I'm just looking forward to that because it will be different for me. I'm in a different status. I'm in a different place now and I'm going to be taking the Lord's communion at uh from the position and from the thing that God has done in my life. Now this evening I want to talk to you about speak to you about and preach if I do get preaching on pitching your tent at Bethl. Bethl the very word Bethl is the house of God. Pitching your tent. And you find in in also in another chapter that Abraham he went back to Bethl. And so I want while we are speaking tonight, I want you that have had uh an extraordinary meeting and God has touched your life. Uh I will tell you that God has touched mine. It doesn't we're not talking about young people. We're all the same age as far as our theophony body is concerned. God has touched my life and I will not only be mindful of what he's doing, I will return. I believe in returning to those places where you met God. Return back to them and re turn back often uh as often as you can. You turn return back to them. Remember what you prayed where God met you. Remember the promises that you made. Remember any vows if you made a vow. Remember the vow. Remember the promise of God. Remember how God touched you. And I'll tell you, the God that touched you, the God that spoke to you, he never changed his mind about that. &gt;&gt; It remains the same tonight as it did at the mightiest moment or the most emotional time you had because the emotion had nothing to do with it. That was only the uh result of what you were feeling inside. Now, the Bible says, and the Lord said to Abram, get thee out. I just want to register that those three words. Get thee out. Get out from thy country and out from thy kindred and out from thy father's house unto a land or unto a place where I will bless you. Now he had to have a physical movement but we may not have you know a geographical movement but there isn't a person there isn't a person who's come to serve God but what God required of them that they get out they get out of the situation they're in. They get out of the relationship they're in. They get out of the company of friends that they're in. They get out of the association and whatever. They get out of the things that they're doing. Get out. Hallelujah. And then God is very, very keen on what your response is. And he loved Abraham's response because Abram responded right away. So he departed. You've heard me say this before. So he departed. I can tell you Jesus talked about two two brothers, two sons, and uh and they were required and asked to do a certain thing. And one said, "I'll do it." But he didn't do it. And the other one said, "No, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going there. I'm not going to camp. I'm not going to pray. I'm not going to the front." But in the end, he did do it. Hallelujah. And they said, "Which one did the father's will?" And I said, "The one that did do it." Even though he said, "I won't do it," he did do it. And we got a whole bunch of people here who said meeting after meeting and year after year, I won't do it. I'm just not going to do it. I don't feel anything. I'm not inclined. I don't hear God, but in the end, you did do it. Hallelujah. And God's pleased with that. And he's pleased with a person doing it quickly, doing it suddenly. It gets the attention of God. It gets God's eye. When a person moves and moves quickly in a positive direction, don't forget that because that's not the first and last time that it ever will happen to you. And when God touches your heart about something, answer it quickly. Do it quickly. Even to such fundamental things as reading your Bible or or you just may feel at a moment, you just feel enter into prayer. Do it. &gt;&gt; Do it right then. &gt;&gt; I was in midst of my studies today. I was in the midst of I've been sitting at the uh doing my work all day. Harley just got up a couple of times and and uh I was just reading a certain something I don't know if I will touch on it something that was taking place in the prophet's life and ministry. It was very touching. It was in life story and I just felt the presence of God come and I just didn't want to sit there anymore. I didn't want to I didn't want to talk to anybody. I just got up right away and I just said to my wife, I'm I'm I'm going out for a walk. I just wanted to be alone with God and I just go out just talk to him, walk and talk and he talks back and he lets you know. He lets you know, you know, and he's pleased with that. We want to respond quickly to him. So now God called Abram uh on a journey and I want to talk about this journey tonight because when you pitch a tent, usually you're in a journey. I want to speak about the journey because what a lot of people have been in the baptismal tank of 42 now you have started a journey your journey is going to be different and some who have been on the journey for a while we're all at a different you know we have we're in a different position we're at a different uh location perhaps in our journey but we're all on this journey Everybody is on a journey and I know that you have a deep desire within your heart. You want your journey and your pathway to end up in heaven's door. &gt;&gt; And you want to hear, do you not? Well done, &gt;&gt; good and faithful servant. You want to hear that, don't you? &gt;&gt; There's nothing else in the world that even counts. Tell me. Here's the scales. over here. You're there because everybody's going to stand one day. Everybody's going to want to enter one day. And they Well done. Enter in to the glories. Enter in to your reward. Enter in over there on this side of the scale. Is that over here? What are you going to put to offset that, my friends? or some enjoyment or my sports or my talent or something else. So, I'm going to have some fun. You're going to put fun on on a scale with this. There's nothing There's nothing on the side be on the side of that scale. Isn't that right? That's the only thing that counts. There's only one thing that counts and that's it. You want to tell the Lord that that's that's all that counts for you. Amen. So, we're on this journey. Some are further down the road than others, and some are just starting out, but God's God's fundamental uh dealings remains the same. So, I just want to reestablish number one is when he speaks, he wants a clearcut decision. He found the same thing and brother Brandham brought it out in the message thy seed shall possess the gate. Rebecca going to be a part of Isaac and we've heard this many times but when Eleazar went and he wanted to return with her when she was put to the trial brother Brandham said those are his words and when it came to the trial and her trial was will you go that was the trial will you go you know just stepping back a moment to when so many so many times when it comes to that that moment of surrender. Oh, that's a tough one. I tell you what, there's a supreme trial because I think every devil in hell is against a person yielding or surrendering to God's will. And it doesn't matter. We can be way down the road. It doesn't it makes no difference how long you have been serving God or when it was you gave your life to Christ and how much you know about the message. I can assure you when some comes in something uh uh something comes into your life and uh and and God is telling you lay it down. &gt;&gt; Just forget it. Lay it down. Uh leave that. you'll go through the trial &gt;&gt; just when you're going to do it and then all hell just comes against that. &gt;&gt; And so she said, "Will you go with this stranger or will you stay with us?" He said her decision was quickly made clearcut and that's the way God likes it. And I don't want you to ever forget it. He doesn't like any other waffling around and you know weighing it out and reasoning it out. A clear-cut decision. Now some people are they are seem to be made up. They're physically made up. So a clear-cut decision comes easier for them. And uh I'm not that way. I'm one that I weigh everything out way back and think about it and so on so forth. Brother Vince said that was because I was born under that kind of a sign. I don't know. He was the first one to ever say that you're, you know, you're born under a certain sign, born at a certain time. And I'm in that I'm in that. I weigh it all out. Weigh it out. Weigh it out. Don't tell anybody, but I just weigh it out and weigh it out and think it out. Think it out till it till it's just a bunch of fine powder and scraps. And finally then I have a decision. So, okay, let let's do this. But, you know, you you get tired of it. Get tired of it. And you know the trouble? You know what the problem with that is? Quite often it's between 2 and 3 and 4:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; And that's just terrible. I try to say it. David spoke to his soul. I speak to my mind. &gt;&gt; Shut down &gt;&gt; and go to sleep. &gt;&gt; This is nighttime and this is when you're supposed to be resting. How many others here have that problem? Oh my, what a bunch of friends I have. Well, God bless you all. And may tonight your mind shut down and may you have the rest of the uh of a babe is my prayer. I know what that's all about. But you're there weighing it out, weighing it out, weighing it out. And I don't know whether it does any benefit. But sometimes I try to satisfy myself that I sorted things out at night and in the morning even though I'm still uh uh you know only half there, I figure got it figured out at least. Will you go out into uncharted waters? See, now I can tell you for those of you that have you you made a real surrender to God and you determined my life by God's grace shall be different from this moment on. You don't know how different and you don't know what those waters are. They're uncharted for you. But God knows exactly where he's leading you and where he's directing you. And this is what's important because even if a person chooses not to walk in God's way, even if you choose not to walk a surrendered life, you still you still the future is still unknown. &gt;&gt; There's nobody that knows what their future is. Nobody. In Kinsman Redeemer, he was brother Brandon was speaking about Ruth. He said, "Oh, what a clearcut decision for a believer. What the Bible says, I'll do it. So, he's not talking about Ruth now. He's talking about a believer. You're a believer. What the Bible says, I'll do it. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. I'll do it. &gt;&gt; 42 said, "I'll do it." &gt;&gt; I doubt if there's any of the 42 that regret that they said, "I'll do it." &gt;&gt; Ruth never regretted, "I'll do it." Rebecca never regretted saying, "I'll go." &gt;&gt; And you will never regret saying, "I'll give my all to Jesus Christ." You'll never regret that. I've stood by the bedside of quite a few people that have been dying. I have never stood by a believer who ever even gave a twins, they regretted serving Christ. They're so happy they gave their life to Christ. If anything, I wish I'd started earlier. I wish I'd started as a young person. Isn't that so? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's exactly so. I'll do it. Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. He said, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; And I feel that that is, you know, what God is doing now, friends, believe me, is not ending here by people coming and just sitting at church. This testimony is not merely going to echo out, but I look for some of these young men and young women to make known what God has done in their lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And be a witness. &gt;&gt; Says, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel." What's the response? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; I'll do it. &gt;&gt; I'll do it. Not I'll just think about it, but I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When? Tomorrow morning. When you're speaking to somebody, say it and let them know what what what your uh what your testimony is. He says Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Whatever it says for me to do, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; He says, "And the church is taking its orders from the word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The church is taking its orders from the word, &gt;&gt; not from any man. or any other person. And so the scripture says, and I thought this was very interesting. The scripture says, "Get thee out." And I just want to stop on the word get because I found it very, very interesting. Says, "Get thee out." And the Hebrew for get is to go, to walk, or perhaps even to come. But it's more than that. Get is to live to have life. Get it. That's what God when God simply said get to Abraham in God's mind he had walk you'll walk with me. You'll live you'll be blessed. And that's why he went on and described it further on. &gt;&gt; It's a matter of life. And so I want to say to all that that were moved upon during these last few weeks, everything that you felt in your heart, God talking to you, God moving upon you, I want you to know that God's intention with that, even though you may have said just a few words, even though you may have just felt, I need to surrender. I need to I I need to I need to turn aside. I need to stop resisting. I need to or whatever it is, whatever it was he was speaking and and you were and you just gave yourself and surrendered to that. But in God's mind, he has a he has a basket full of blessing. &gt;&gt; He has a lot more in his mind to pour out because you do that. He I'm going to bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bless you. He can bless you. We're not We're not just thinking of material things. We're think blessing. People today, they do everything in the world to try to be happy. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be just marvelous if you knew tonight, and I'm telling you tonight, on the authority of God's word, when you acted as a res as a response to his call to you, he's so pleased with that. I'm going to bless them. That pleased me. I'm going to bless them. Hallelujah. Jesus said, and he said to them, "If any man," notice now the same thing going from the Old Testament to the New, "if any man will come, if will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me." And there's just four words that you need to remember. Come deny, take and follow. Come deny, take and follow. Come after me. Deny yourself and take up his cross daily and follow me. Now, God always prepares the people for the events that are about to happen. Now, I'm I'm talking to you some very deep things that are on my heart. When I see God do something sovereign, there isn't a person in this congregation that that were able to manipulate or generate or do what God did. See, you can be a little quiet tonight. That's perfectly fine. That doesn't mean anything to me. I know what God did, &gt;&gt; and I know that that was sovereign God. And I saw lives that completely changed. And will everybody remain that way? That's God's business. As far as I'm concerned, not only everybody can remain that way, but you can add a whole lot more to the Lord. This thing's not over. This thing's just starting. Hallelujah. It's just starting. And what I want to what I want to announce to you tonight is God have something further in his mind. when he did this act, he's preparing us for another event. &gt;&gt; And that event may well be the rapture. &gt;&gt; It may well be the rapture. &gt;&gt; And you, the results of what's happening here may well be God saying, "I must answer the prayers of these uh bride people, these believers, these mothers, these fathers that have prayed because there's a great event coming." And I must bring them in. [Music] &gt;&gt; I must bring them in. I can't leave them out there. I can't leave them bound. I can't leave them in sin. I can't leave them under the power of Satan. I must bring them out &gt;&gt; because there's another event happening. &gt;&gt; Listen now to this principle. How wonderful and simple. And this is in the message preparation. Because if you're going to go on a journey, you've got to prepare for that journey. There's only a certain amount that you can do. But God has made preparation for you in this journey. But you also have to make preparation. And in the message preparation, he talked to a mother laying in a stretcher because this was a healing line. And now mother you here in the stretcher and this dear loving person mother here and here and all around there are all kinds of people there. He says I I want to do tonight by God's help if he will let me is to speak his word to you that'll prepare your heart for a healing service. Now those people it was no secret they were sick. &gt;&gt; It was no secret that the woman on the stretcher perhaps was dying. That wasn't a mystery. There they were. But now a prophet is saying, "I want to and will God help me. I want to be able to speak. I want to be able and he wanted that service to prepare their heart for a healing." &gt;&gt; That was preparation for an event. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if and if you can prepare for a healing, how much more can we prepare for the rapture? How much more can we prepare for whatever God has? We don't know, but God has things in his mind. And I say he's got things in store for this church. He's got things in store for the bride. And even the testimony, you know, sometimes it has to break out one place. And I don't know, I'd be thankful to God if it was his choosing that it broke out here, &gt;&gt; that something broke out. And you young people, what happened to you? It spreads and someone else's heart is ignited and they say, "I heard my friend back in Cloverdale. I heard what happened. I heard that Wesley was baptized the other night. That blessed me the other day, Wes, when I heard that you were baptized. I'm missing all these wonderful things." You folks here don't know it. And when my wife and I just decided right after camp we just would need three four days to catch our breath and we just drove up the canyon up over here hope just up the canyon little ways and decided to pull in. We have a a hamburger or something and we just pulled in. We just just left home like 2 and 1/2 hours ago or something and we're just walking walking past just one vehicle in front of us and I hear brother Ed thought can I get away from it anywhere and I turned around there was Wesley Calder sitting in the truck he and his dad were going up country and so happy to hear and the next time you're in the tank Praise the Lord. I'm talking now to you people. I'm talking to you fellas. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just don't even know what's in my heart. But he's preparing you. That wasn't just, oh, you know, I heard God speak and I answered and I said yes and I went and I was baptized and so on and we had some exciting services and had some long services. That's just the beginning. That's just the beginning. Like I said to you, like I said to you the last Sunday I was here, this is exactly what happened at Cloverdale Bible Way House about 33 years ago. It just started to sweep and they came and there was just eight and then there was 10 and then there was 15. And finally they were sitting up the stairs and there was no place for them to sit and when the meeting was over they didn't have any interest in going home because all they wanted to talk about is what God had done or what he was just going to do or who they were praying for. and then they spill out into the street and uh and uh and and witness to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll's really taken up now with a whole lot of other things. I went out on the streets many times and went out to little places where uh some of the young people were meeting and I talked to them and looked at them in the face and oh, they were so lost some of them, but God saved some. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And are still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother John Alexander, one of your deacons. He's one one of the first brothers to come. No wonder he can sing, you know, a song about the little Bible way house. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And he's not alone now. &gt;&gt; And his wife soon came and someone else came. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it works, friends. And God has something in his mind and he was preparing these people for for a healing. Listen now when he just continued on a little bit. He said before we go and fight a war first we have to prepare for that war. If you're going to get married you have to prepare for that time. And you have preparations. And before you come to church you made preparations. An ambulance. You're talking to sick an ambulance to bring you or your loved one to bring you and you had to go to a certain amount of money and be ready for you to come that you can come. preparations and God always prepares the people for the events that's just about to happen and I don't know what's just about to happen but I can assure you that what God has done and I want you to get fully into anticipation and say oh God do with me whatever you desire to do what let me be in the right place let me have the right attitude let me think the right thoughts Let me say the right words. Don't let me Don't let me be a millstone around anybody's neck. Let me be right in tune with what you're doing. Oh God, can the congregation say amen to that? Nothing is impossible with God. You believe that? Nothing is impossible with God. Thus sayith the word of God. I don't care how impossible it looks. Nothing is impossible with God. Hallelujah. So, you want to believe for the impossible? I don't know what it is that God has in his mind. I'm just a little puny insignificant human and we don't know what God has in his mind. But God has something in his mind. &gt;&gt; He didn't do this just for, you know, entertainment. &gt;&gt; And I have too many things that are powerful indicators because God started this wasn't a camp thing. This wasn't some excitement at camp. This is something that started long before camp, weeks before camp, even before you knew it. God was already moving you. God was already tenderizing your heart. God was already speaking to you in the rapture series. I knew that God was speaking to you. &gt;&gt; More certain than you're sitting here tonight, more sure is that eternal realm. More real is it just beyond your eyesight. Your eyesight, your physical eyesight can fool you. Your physical hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hear ear hearing hearing can fool you but I tell you that eternal realm is absolutely precision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is I felt so compelled tonight to say to you one thing is certain God is preparing you for something. &gt;&gt; Let it be Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let it be me. &gt;&gt; Let me be right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brand was talking to a man. This really moved me. Well, dear brother, you are suffering. I could have said a few weeks ago, dear young man, dear young woman, you are suffering. You're suffering with a tortured mind. You've wrestled back and forth. You've debated back and forth. You've weighed things out and God is strimming with you and you have resisted it and and so on. times not only for young people but all of us we go through those times and this poor man and he was so nervous he said you're awfully nervous and it's caused his nervousness was not something mental but it was something physical said you have a prostate trouble now I want you to catch the principle here and you have a weakness in the kidneys also and I see a doctor before you and you're you've just been examined and I believe you're up for an operation. Isn't that right? And you're figuring on an operation right away. Listen to this. Listen to this marvelous thing that happened. He said, "I feel though you've made preparations for something." And I felt to say that to all of you here this evening. you've made pre preparations for something because you've made the same preparations this man did. And he said, "You've just been saved, too. &gt;&gt; Just converted." &gt;&gt; That be marvelous. &gt;&gt; And I'm here tonight and I'm going to stand in brother Brandhamstead and say to you, &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God &gt;&gt; that was there is here tonight at this platform. the same God, not one bit different. Now I and I see that you've made preparations and you made preparations to be converted, to be saved and give your life to Christ. You made that preparation. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he said, it's been recently. Listen to this. It's been recently because you had on the same suit of clothes. &gt;&gt; Here he is, a prophet seeing him having just given his life to Christ. You've just been converted. It's just been recently because you're wearing the same suit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think God doesn't know us? &gt;&gt; And then and then wow, it just gets better. Oh, it just gets better, friend. He said, you're wearing the same suit. Isn't that right? He said, don't you fear. And I say to you, don't you fear. Don't you fear about the future. Don't you fear about uh the college or the school or whatever. Don't you fear about your job or about your work. He said, he said, don't you worry about it because Jesus Christ, the son of God, has made preparation for you with his blessings. Amen. You made preparations for him. &gt;&gt; You made preparations. You prepared your heart. You listened. You respected. And you heard the word of God. And now because of that, God has made preparations for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You made preparations. &gt;&gt; Oh God, what grace is this? What little thing I could do and you've made preparations for me, &gt;&gt; how blessed, &gt;&gt; how wonderful it is. And there is no way for you or I to be able to even begin to explore or understand what God has prepared for his children. &gt;&gt; He loves you with a never dying love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love that Jesus has made preparations for you. I wonder what is taking place and what it is that he's prepared on a journey. It's a tragic thing if you're illprepared. It's no surprise and most people have been quite caught up in the news of the recent days and the hundreds and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of people that have been left in such an awful awful state. I heard brother Tom, I guess it was from brother Tim about the family in Bloxy, isn't it? Yeah. A family of believers in Baloxy. And if you had seen any pictures, that town was leveled. I believe it had 7,500 people. There's a a family of believers and their house is completely untouched and everything around it is absolute desolation. Hallelujah. Glory. Praise the Lord. I'm God. He's the same God. Hallelujah. He's doing the same thing today that he done in say how did that happen? That question doesn't even come to my mind. I don't care how it happened. The thing is it happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It happened. The same God just a few days ago. And the people are left in such desolation and datitude and they and and the whole uproar now is because they've been saying they're illprepared. They're not ready. They They couldn't respond. See, Homeland Security and FEMA and all the people were supposed to be ready. They weren't ready. They said at least they weren't ready. I'm not anybody's judge. I think they were working under very, very difficult, very, very difficult conditions. But it's getting more difficult all the time. Now comes body counting time. It's just tragic. 10,000 people still don't want to leave, but they don't have there's no preparations. They're telling it's going to be masked. I heard a reporter and he said the whole city of New Orleans is literally being poached in a toxic waste chemical and sewage and dead animals and bodies and rats and snakes and whatever more. And a lot of people don't want to leave, but those people are still there. And a lot of people, I mean, there's no schools and there's no jobs and they don't even have families. Like one man said, and he speaks for tens of thousands. He said, "I don't even have an identity. I don't have an address anymore. I don't have an address." For the first time, I don't have an address. It's gone. &gt;&gt; People are in an incredible state. I'll tell you something, friends, that didn't escape God's eye. God knew what was happening. And furthermore, he knows why it was happening. And I can assure you, it's not the last. This world is in for a very dismal time. And the scripture tells us clearly, things shall wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; I have seen in my lifetime a deterioration of the quality of life. &gt;&gt; It's not better. Not at all better. People are teed up. They're right up at the very breaking point. It's not a better quality of life. It's a lesser quality of life. You young people had a lesser quality of life than I did as a young person. Oh, you say, "Did you have the quads and you have all this?" No, I didn't need them. &gt;&gt; I was happy without it. I see all kinds of people have toys today, but they're not happy. They got every gimmick and everything else, but they're not happy. I was happier in an old house than a lot of people are. I can just go my way and I didn't have to worry. We never locked our doors. We live in a city of 6 8,000 people. We never even thought I thought people were nuts if they locked their doors. &gt;&gt; What do you lock your door for? Nobody's going to steal anything. &gt;&gt; Today, you know, punch the alarm. Even you just go out for coffee, punch the alarm. You don't know when they're going to come and take all the stuff out. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; It's true. We ought to have the policeman at least say amen. There he said amen. It's true. You will need the right kind of equipment and the right kind of equipment is lot lot more than just coming say to the house of God. And I have found as time has gone on just in this meeting we were in I don't know how many people were there possibly 300 at brother Spencer's church and quite a few visitors and I asked because I was relating some things that I had experienced with brother Brandham and I asked how many people here have been in a meeting you've been in one of brother Brandham's meetings there were seven hands including my wife and myself and I that It was a shock to me. Seven hands that have seen with their eyes. And I begin to tell them just a few things of things that I saw with my eyes that I saw happen. I told him what the blind girl saw with my eyes. I saw the nature of a horse changed instantly. an animal, his hor he's trying to kill a man in one moment and a been destructive and and frightening powerful horse trying to kill a man one moment and inside of I would say inside of two minutes he become a kitten. And when I turned around, Brother Brandon was just putting his hat back on his head, he just finished praying. And that horse remained a kitten from that day on. and we packed him and did absolutely everything with him and he was like another animal. I saw that with my eyes. I lived with that for a number of days. I can tell you God has control of the animals. God has control of everything. We still have the word nothing shall be impossible with God. If you believe nothing is impossible with God, that's our God. We've got to shake off this lethargy from this age that we're in and and and confess what it is that we believe. I want you to confess it openly with your mouth. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And how long do I confess it? Confess it until you're certain you do believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers. You may not feel it. You're sitting here on a soft seat tonight, but I can assure you, you wrestle against principalities and powers. And Satan's going to do everything he can to move you off your testimony. He's going to do everything he can to rob you of the blessedness of the things that you've experienced in Christ. And when you feel that sleuth come around, you say, "You have no right. You have no right in my yard. And you have no right in this vessel." And I can assure you, I will give you no room. I will assure you that I will use my sword on you in the name of Jesus Christ. You have no place in my heart and no place in my life. And you shall not control my emotions. You shall not control my actions. And you have no place in giving in in in giving any words to my ears because I'm not going to think about them. [Music] Say, "What should you do if you get to something like that?" &gt;&gt; Have your Bible, have your sword nearby and say, "Here, devil. Just come along and I'll read you some scripture." &gt;&gt; I will read to you, "It is written." &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil &gt;&gt; and what is it? He shall flee from you. Say that again. Resist the devil and he shall flee from you. Hallelujah. You believe that? &gt;&gt; That's not just a lesson for young people. That's a good lesson for me and everybody. He shall flee from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand therefore, having your loins gird about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able, you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. Isn't this marvelous? Isn't this positive? It doesn't say you shall you shall quench all the fiery darts if &gt;&gt; if this or if that or if something else. This is not ifs and may and and hope so. This scripture is so positive. Stand therefore and have your groins loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness. How would you have your loins g about with truth? I would say the simple statement of the prophet. Read your Bible. Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Have your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel. And above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplications for all saints. Now when God called Abram as I be as we began at the first reading tonight and he began his journey of faith the only thing he gave him to hang on to was his promise. You know, I I want to just alert everyone here because we are a generation that we do want instant results &gt;&gt; and we want to see something tangible. &gt;&gt; We want to see and we and let's face it, we get discouraged if we don't see it. But a but God when he called Abram, he said, "Get thee out &gt;&gt; from your kindred from your father's house to a land that I'm going to show you." &gt;&gt; No, no way to waver there. Just get out. So he departed and I'm going to give you a land and I'm going to make you a great blessing. I'm going to make you a father of nations. But you know, he walked and walked and walked and never did see physically what God was telling him. And that was a marvelous thing. He did not see the land as his own inheritance. Neither did Isaac and neither did Jacob. And we need to come to the place and say, and I want the young people especially to come to the place and say, if I never see tangible, you know, the thing that I really would like to see because, you know, I know that that starts to press down as being, ooh, that isn't really what I want to hear. But that's where your faith needs to be. Your faith needs to be at that level. If I never see it, if I never see the answer, what God promised me still holds true. And then when God sees that kind of faith, then he begins to move in. He begins to bring in blessings one after the other. All kinds of blessings. And Abraham became a mighty man of uh of stature and respect. Even of nations had to respect him. And he was still a man, still a wanderer. And the Bible says that he pitched his tent and he came he came to Bethl. He he he did build an altar earlier than that but he didn't pitch his tent there. But when he came to a place said this is the house of God and Bethl has a wonderful place through the scriptures. The Bible says he pitched his tent. I feel that many of you young people actually came like Jacob did when he went to sleep and God came and talked to him and he said, "I'm going to call this place Bethl. This is the house of God." And what I want to tell you is that when you're in this journey and you don't feel all that bliss and all that joy and oh we had such an exciting time and at church or we had the young people said oh we sang and we clapped our hands and all that. There'll be as as you heard at church, I believe it was brother uh brother Diddy that said there'll be the Monday morning &gt;&gt; and there might be weeks of Monday mornings, but you want to go back and pick your tent at Bethl once again. So, I'm going to go back and pick my tent. There is a place God, you spoke to me so clearly and I know it. So everything else seems to be crowding in right now. It seemed to be a great uh uh cloud of gloom right now. Don't have any fear. &gt;&gt; Bethl is still there. And he went back and he and and he didn't just visit it, but he pitched his tent there. Said, "I'm going to take my stakes out." And when he had to pitch his tent, he had to unpack animals. He had to do something. He had to he had to make a conse concentrated effort. I'm going to pitch my tent here. Say, "What would you do if you're going to pitch your tent?" Well, I tell you what, I'd begin to surround myself with things that I know would bring the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit, that dove of God. I'd be listening to the kind of music that I know that God would love to hear. If you have any question about it, brother Brandham listen to some music. You know, I I was at I was with one brother and he had brother Brandham singing, you know, and brother Brandham is not what we call a great singer, but it was sweet music &gt;&gt; because you never found anybody sing more sincerely than he sang. &gt;&gt; It was just something I would create. I would build myself a a cocoon of spiritual things. Uh, I'll I'll pack I'm just trying to give you some I'm trying to give you some lessons. I'll pack a message book and I'll pack it to my bed even though I'm so exhausted. I know I'm not going to open it up. I know I'm not going to read it, but I pack it there anyway. I pack my Bible and a message book there. And I'll keep a tape right beside the bedside because if the devil wakes me up, I want him to wake me up for a good reason. I if I got something to worry about, then I'm going to plug in a tape and put my headphones on. And one brother says he said he said that that's how he said the devil's afraid to wake me up now cuz he knows if he wakes me up, I'm just going to be listening to a message. He said, "That's the best way to assure that he's he's going to sleep through." I don't know. I get woke up lots of times and I don't know why I'm saying this, but I I say you need to surround yourself and keep yourself in a cocoon, a spiritual cocoon, as it were, and you listen to the right thing and you read the right thing and you stay in that kind of atmosphere. And maybe you're busy, you can't get away and pray formally as such, but there's nothing preventing you from talking to God. You can walk down the street and talk to God. Hallelujah. You can be washing dishes and talk to God. God's not limited &gt;&gt; to any certain certain spot. And it won't be very long before you start telling him. You start relating to him. When you met me, when I when I when I got to that place where I will call my Bethl when I was there and you just said, God doesn't have to say read uh volumes of books to you. That's not it. He just speaks few words. &gt;&gt; Sometimes just a sentence, but you know it was God. Remind God what he said. Remind God what the Holy Spirit spoke in your heart and it will not be long and you'll begin to feel another presence move in. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true, my friends. It's absolutely true. If I can pass off any of these secrets to you, I will. And that's exactly what I'm doing. And you can also sense when an evil presence comes. &gt;&gt; You can just feel you can feel it. It's a it's a gloom. &gt;&gt; It's a heaviness. It's a darkness. You don't know what it you may not have not know what it is whatsoever, &gt;&gt; but it just moves in. I've had it. I've had it just as real as real as if I could see it just come in. just a depression. When you feel that, some people are kind of given over to it. I say the moment you feel that cloud come in, that discouragement come in, just say, "I've got your number. &gt;&gt; I've got your number. &gt;&gt; And I'm resisting you right now. Right at the very beginning. I'm not going to wait till the day is shot. And while you've clouted me all day, I'm going to get right on your case right now." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It works, friends. I'm telling you, it absolutely works. &gt;&gt; It absolutely works. How many of young people believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just just a few more minutes. I'm going to close. I'm not going to keep you late. He says, and I just love I don't know whether brother was talking to a bunch of young people at this time or not, but it was at Jesus Christ the same yesterday in hot hot springs, Arkansas. And uh he's talking about Simon Peter and he said he knew what the sign or the identification of the Messiah would be. And uh Philip was standing there and uh Philip was listening and he sees and he hears Jesus this young prophet from Nazareth and he's saying you're Simon the son of Jonas and uh when Philillip heard that your name is Sim Simon the son of Jonas and he saw quickly and it comes to his mind he said that's truly him for I know the scriptures. The man never seen that man before. And how would he know who he was? That's the prophet. And he and he took out after a friend. He took out after a friend that he'd been having Bible studies with. See, he he just took out after this friend, Philillip. He had a friend whose name was Nathaniel. And he took out after Nathaniel because he'd had Bible studies with him. Well, the devil hates that. So when you get together, you know what you want to talk about. Said he was about 15 miles from there and he went around the mountain and he said, "Oh, how it should start our hearts. how it should start our hearts around the hillsides, around the prairies, down through the fields, down the alley, and across the street, and over across the nation somewhere, he found something. And I say, I don't know who all I'm talking to. I'm going to say to you in the name of the Lord, you found something. &gt;&gt; You found something. You don't know what the full purpose is, but you found something. You want to focus on that. I found something. What did he hear? You're Simon. &gt;&gt; The son of Jonas. &gt;&gt; And he was on his way. &gt;&gt; He didn't say I got a great big blessing and he has a great big camp meeting and all that. He just said that's it. &gt;&gt; This is the message. &gt;&gt; This is God's prophet. &gt;&gt; And I'm on my way. This is the identification of the Messiah. And you've heard more than he ever will hear. You've heard more &gt;&gt; already. &gt;&gt; See, you've heard more. You've heard the quotes. You've heard it that is that it has happened. And all you need to do is confess. You need to confess. I've heard it. And this is him. &gt;&gt; This message is him. &gt;&gt; Nobody can do this. No man can do this. And he was on his way. And he said it should start it to start our hearts around the hillsides. I'll give it our language. It's a start a great sweep in Lyndon &gt;&gt; or Bellingham &gt;&gt; or Cloverdale or Suri or Langley or wherever you are or Seattle or throughout the Pacific Northwest in the streets &gt;&gt; and in the alleys in a restaurant &gt;&gt; or in a mall. &gt;&gt; What's the difference? And why not? [Applause] So he had this friend and he said maybe the conversation listening close now maybe the conversation is your conversation this was Philip's conversation maybe the conversation was something like this see time to say how's the olives getting along or how's your wife in the head. He didn't have time. Say, "How's the olive orchard? Have you got a good crop this year? What's happening in basketball?" Or, "What courses are you taking in school? How are things going?" He said he didn't have time to say all of these things. He said the message was urgent. We don't know what the purpose of God doing this is. Why did he do it? &gt;&gt; To did it to make me feel good? No, I don't believe that. He did it to have us exciting time. To make us clap our hands. I don't believe that. Why did he do it? I don't know. He's got something in his mind and I'm going to say, God, whatever you have in your mind, do it. Do it. And he said he didn't have he said and he seen something. He'd seen the scriptures identified and that's what they looked for for years and years. And some of you even young men, I know you've sat here in the services and you've heard messages and you've actually looked for something real for years perhaps since you were a lot younger. And now you want to be able to say, and I'm encouraging you to say, "I found him." &gt;&gt; You didn't find a message. You didn't find a good speaker. I found him. It was Christ that spoke to me. I I wasn't even looking for this. I didn't even want to come. I found him. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you fellas, I was your The reason why I feel it real strong is I was just the age of some of you when I found him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's never been the same since. And he is real. &gt;&gt; He's more real than the person sitting next to you. He's more real than me standing here speaking to you. He's more real. And this is what he said. And I'm putting words in your mouth. This is what you want to say. Come and see who I found. &gt;&gt; Come and see what I found. &gt;&gt; Come and see what I found. I said to Brother Ron Spencer, we're getting ready to leave. He said, "The meetings have been a blessing." I said, "Brother Ron, you got so many good preachers around here. The country's full of them." Cuz he he got up to the pulpit and said, "I'm going to do what Brother Biscll did to me at camp." Said, "What are you doing next year?" And I was I was a little bit koi. All I did was smile. I never gave any commitment at all. But I said, "You've got so many good and youthful and young ministers here." He said, "Brother Biscoll," he said, "Right in the middle while you're speaking, and then you can just begin to bring an experience and say, I was there." He said, "You don't know what that means to us. You just don't know what it means to our people. Young people and older people alike, you don't know what it means. You can say, "I was there. I saw it." Now, you can say something. I was there. I wasn't even looking for it. He found me. And he did something that is real within my life. And I can say, "I found him. Come and see him. Come and see who I found." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I can assure you that God is so blessed with that. And I think that's the that's the thing I want to leave with. I have a I have probably a whole another service here, but I'm not going to take it. That's the thing I want to leave. God called Abram. I'm just rehearsing it now. And he got up quick. He answered the call. And I say I've seen a lot of that in the last few weeks. I've seen it happen. I've seen it happen in meetings. Seen it happened for baptism. Seen it happen for a lot of a lot of things. And you parents how something should go very very deep down within our hearts. Very very deep down. I'll tell you why. Some people have prayed for years &gt;&gt; and saw their young people go into the world and be very marred and very wounded and all the rest of it. And for this that we have seen here, I say this is a this is a not only a victory, this is glorious beyond all words. And when you can see your children or your young people and you can see that their lives have been preserved from the entanglements. Oh, I would like to take every one of you, every one of you young people especially, and let you sit in my office and see brother Biscoll weep and cry with the people who are sitting there who had your chance but didn't take it. &gt;&gt; And then it got so messed up and so entangled and was just fearsome. It's so dreadful and so sad. I can do nothing and my hands are tied. Even God can't untangle it. It is such a horrific mess. You've been spared all of that. And the demons are screaming, "I don't have a chance at these people. I don't have a chance because God came down on them." Hallelujah. And God has preserved you and kept you from it. And you got a little preacher getting old tonight, but I'm preaching the same thing. God has saved you from it. He preserved you. And God has something in mind for you. &gt;&gt; That you can't even imagine. You can't even imagine. You want to say, "Oh, God, tonight, take me to that further step. Take me what for what you have prepared." For whatever reason, you did this. Number one, I acknowledge you did it. And number two, I acknowledge what brother Bis was preaching tonight. You have something in mind for me. And what you have in mind for me is sure going to be a sad day for the enemy. It's going to be a sad day for the devil. I'm giving my life over to this gospel. Hallelujah. Bless the Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, heavenly father, I just feel so consumed. Seems like I would like to say to these young people and the adults alike, oh God, that they would just keep adding wood to the fire, add encouraging words, add prayers, add a spiritual atmosphere, oh God, that they'll deny anything that's that's uh negative and deny anything that would be a hindrance and deny anything that would be a cloud. Oh God, that they would just encourage the people, encourage their neighbor, encourage their friend, their loved one, whoever it might be to encourage them. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you will come amongst us and for whatever purpose, whatever purpose you have done, what you have done, we say move on, Lord, move on. Here we are, oh God. Move on, oh God. Blessed Lord, you have a plan. You have a program for each one of our lives. And I don't know exactly what it is. I don't pretend to know. I don't even know fully what you have for me, but I say, "Oh Lord, take my hand. Be my guide and lead me on this journey. I don't know what what's around the next corner. Lord, I may be climbing a steep side of the mountain or I may come to a glorious, beautiful valley. Lord, I don't know what it is that you have, but here we are tonight to give ourselves and say, "I'm going to walk with you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, bless your name, Lord. Bless your name." I wonder if we could sing, Brother Ryan. Let me walk with you, Jesus. Let me walk with you Jesus. Leave me alone. Oh boy without you. Never, never, no, never make heaven my home. Once again, let me walk with you. Oh, let me walk with you, Jesus. [Music] Leave me alone. or without you. I would never. No, you never make heaven my home. I've been on the mountain. Yes, I feel the mountain and I feel this valley. Oh, listen to the next line now. But never, not one time and he failed me. Amen. Turn to him with my trouble. I go home. So let me be walking in Jesus. Oh my go. [Music] Oh, far without you would never could never would never make heaven my home. You found me. You found me when I was alone. Jesus found you when I was remember when he found you. You found me when no one loves me. And no one just But there's one. There's one old man. Only one. [Music] Let me give you the words of Jesus. Now let me stand in hisstead as a servant of Christ. His words now. I will never leave you nor forsake you. [Music] I will never leave you. There's no friend like this. Amen. [Music] I'd like to sing that chorus of a song that a 12-year-old girl wrote. I'll say yes. Uh yeah, [Music] [Music] sorry to hinder me for someday. his blessed face and what to see. It makes no difference what the cost or how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing here to hinder me. I don't want nothing here to hinder me for something blessed. Oh, it makes no difference what the cost or how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing. One day I heard a voice. He said, "If you make me your choice, I'll wait your every care and set you free." How many are free? Praise God. To him that day and he took my sin away. Now I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Oh, I don't want nothing here to hinder me. Oh, [Music] his blessed face I want to see. It makes no difference what the cost or how heavy the cross. I don't want nothing here. Now, we're going to sing. Now, someday when I get home, I'm going to say all you young people, if it should happen, it's going to happen. And you probably won't recognize me. I should maybe send a picture around. I'd like to have a picture when I was about 19, 20 years old. How skinny is a race, just like Michael Ray. Almost had to have two of me so he could see me. Those things have changed. But whatever God had in his mind, that's exactly what it'll be. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to come along and say, "Hi there, Caleb. This is Brother Ed." You're going to say, "You're kidding. No, I don't think you'll say that. You'll just say, "So glad you made it and so glad I made it." We're going to rejoice. You think it's You think it's going to be a quiet moment? We're going to shout and sing and dance about. Hallelujah. Glory. You believe it? Amen. That's exactly what we're going to do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to just close with one other chorus instead of singing the last verse. Going to sing. When we're inside the gates of pearl, we're going to learn a lot of things. We'll have a harp. Now, we don't know if everybody's going to have harp cuz brother Brandon said, "Then all the musicians would have it on us." I don't know how to play a harp. I know one of the one of the snow girls plays a harp. beautiful harp, but uh I don't know anything about a harp, but I should know a lot about rejoicing and singing and shouting and dancing about it. And the lamb will dry our tears. And that's not just a course we're singing down here. That is a reality. And you're going to know it's a reality one day cuz you're going to be there. Amen. When we're inside the gates of we're going to learn a lot of things. We'll have a heart of gold for the singing and the land will dry our tears. You have a plan on coming to 10,000 years old. [Music] We don't have a heart made of per [Music] I tell you what, when the Holy Spirit comes down, whatever you do, don't say, "I'll never do that." Because God for sure will make you do it. I've had people say, "Oh, I can never I can never raise my hand. I can never shout. I can never clap my hands." They come around, see the believers do it, and say, "Oh my goodness, I can never do that. I know one old fellow. He was British. He was just as British as he could be. He was just as conservative as he could be. And he saw all these people. He said, "I can never Oh my goodness. That was that was just terrible." He couldn't imagine doing that. And the Holy Spirit struck him. And the next thing he was doing, he was standing on a pew. He's standing right on the seat rejoicing. He didn't know what happened to him. Sometimes God needs to shake us up. Hallelujah. Oh, when we're inside the G, we're going to have a lot of things. Yes. Oh down the last [Music] one. The world learning [Music] with 10,000 years we'll smile. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Well, we're back in school again and you've got school tomorrow. So, we're going to stay on the good side of teachers and your parents and let you get home and get some rest. But this isn't ending. Friday night, so all the young people, Brother Jonathan Berken's going to lead song service and some of the young people are going to sing and come with a song in your heart. Brother John Andy's is going to speak I believe the first part is going to speak about how God led him and I remember him from 15 years about about 15 15 years old. So all you fellas you have a real good example here. One of brother Aaron Hardy. Brother Aaron if you would come please ask God's blessing upon the people upon the service in Jesus name and dismiss us. God bless you brother Aaron. Gracious Father, we know you've met us this evening. You spoke to our pastor. Pray you just restore him, Lord. Let these things sink in our hearts, oh God, and just be with the young people as they go to school, Lord. Ask, Father, that you would just turn their schools upside down, Father. Set us a fire, Lord. Ignite our hearts for you, Lord. We're just awaiting you, Father, to come and take us away. We just commit everything to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, brother Aaron. You're dismissed in Jesus Christ's name. And Lord willing, we'll see you at their prayer service on Friday night as well. We're going the young people are going to be in the fellowship room, so I won't disturb the prayer service whatsoever. And uh uh we just we we just see God leading us in different ways. And we're we're determined. I can tell you from the pulpit, we're determined to move on with this thing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says that when this puts out another bud, and no one put this bud out, God did it. And when the Holy Spirit puts out another bud, it'll be a book of Acts. Hallelujah. God bless you. You're dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
