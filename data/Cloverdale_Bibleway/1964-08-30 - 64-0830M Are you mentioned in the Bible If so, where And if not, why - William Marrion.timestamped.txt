[0:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[0:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[0:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[0:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[0:08] servants the
[0:10] prophets brother Brandon um someone
[0:13] wants to know why you were not uh I mean
[0:18] mentioned in the
[0:21] Bible I believe you are HCA 214 get that
[0:26] brother HCA 21-4 let them read this and
[0:31] study it
[0:34] third chapter think name on types of
[0:39] four
[0:40] chapters uh believe I believe is
[0:44] you uh while he's hun it's albeca uh 2
[0:49] 1:4 um uh brother a sister every ask the
[0:54] questions no name that's fine I like to
[0:56] you ask those things I know what's on
[0:57] your heart see and then uh I tell you
[1:00] no see you wouldn't have to necessarily
[1:03] have your name in the Bible see but you
[1:05] see as long as you're in the Bible there
[1:09] as long as you're in Christ you are in
[1:11] the Bible you're in him you see in the
[1:13] Bible see as long as you are in Christ
[1:16] then you are in the fullness of the
[1:18] Bible see you are in your full position
[1:21] when you're in Christ all understand
[1:23] that um do you have it brother Neville
[1:26] what uh hcaa I haven't read it this just
[1:30] put in here I guess this morning uh
[1:32] habca 2
[1:34] 1:4 that's
[1:36] see habca 2 Rebeca 2 and um 1 to4 I will
[1:42] stand up on the watch and set me upon
[1:44] the tower and will watch and see what he
[1:47] will say unto me and what I shall answer
[1:50] I I am when I am reproved and the Lord
[1:53] answered me and said write the vision
[1:55] and make it plain upon tables that he
[1:58] may run that it for the vision is yet
[2:01] for an appointed time but at the end it
[2:04] shall speak and not lie though it t wait
[2:07] for it because I will surely come and I
[2:10] will not t behold his soul which is
[2:13] lifted up is not upright in but the just
[2:17] shall live by his faith
[2:21] well uh I'd imagine this dear person
[2:24] that ask this you see it's somebody that
[2:26] loves me or they wouldn't write that see
[2:29] now I could not say my the Bible doesn't
[2:32] call my my name William brandom or call
[2:34] your name whoever it is but we are in
[2:37] him anyhow and these and now you see
[2:40] some familiar places that refer to in
[2:43] the Bible it says certain things see now
[2:46] if you'll watch History repeats itself
[2:48] in the Bible see now let's just give you
[2:50] a scripture for one I see many of
[2:52] writing it down now in third chapter of
[2:54] St Matthew it said and when God called
[2:58] his son out of Egypt that it might be
[3:00] fulfilled which is spoken out of Egypt I
[3:03] call my son now if you got a Scofield or
[3:06] any other reference Bible if you follow
[3:08] that reference there that Marg reading
[3:09] he'll bring you back to where he called
[3:12] Jacob Israel out of Egypt see but Jacob
[3:16] was his son that he called out of Egypt
[3:19] also Jesus was his son that he called
[3:22] out of Egypt so see the word of God is
[3:24] never ending see we identify ourselves
[3:27] in the Bible with different how many
[3:29] remembers my m message on identifying
[3:30] yourself with Christian characters
[3:32] Phoenix Arizona whor preaching yeah many
[3:34] of us got on the tape SC identify with
[3:36] Christian character see you can identify
[3:39] yourself anywhere you want to in that
[3:40] scripture if you are a Christian and if
[3:42] you're not a Christian you can identify
[3:44] yourself in the Bible see so I think
[3:47] maybe that would help
