[20:13] It's a testimony.

[20:19] Almighty God for his mercy towards me
[20:21] during a car accident. His protective
[20:23] mighty hand is always ready. Keep his

[20:28] the church for the prayers this
[20:31] difficult time. And thanks to everyone
[20:33] for your visits, the phone calls and the
[20:35] emails and the words of encouragement.
[20:37] Just want God to bless each and
[20:38] everyone. It's a request this morning
[20:43] uh that we
[20:47] pray for sister Patricia Briner. She's
[20:49] got a stomach flu and very sick this
[20:52] morning. So, we want to pray for her

[21:24] Derek,
[21:25] [Music]
[21:29] let's bow our hearts and our heads. Pray
[21:32] together. Heavenly Father,
[21:35] what a solemn time it is, Lord, to enter
[21:38] into your presence.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; That presence where a dry stick could
[21:45] bring forth a bud blossom.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, not stop there would bring forth
[21:51] and manifest fruit.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the life that lays within.
[21:54] Father, this morning we're coming
[21:57] through the blood of Jesus,
[22:00] &gt;&gt; desiring, Lord, that you would have your
[22:02] divine will and way accomplished in this
[22:04] service this morning. Lord, as the songs
[22:07] of Zion have been sung out by your
[22:09] people, your name has been lifted up on
[22:11] high, Lord, not to just sing a song,
[22:14] Lord, but that we may create an
[22:16] atmosphere, Father, that you would be
[22:18] able to sweep down into this building,
[22:20] Lord, that you would be able to take
[22:22] control of the lives that have come into
[22:24] this little sanctuary, Lord. Lord, those
[22:27] out on the internet, Lord, could sing a
[22:30] song, Lord, and forget about the place
[22:32] that they're in.
[22:34] Lord, if there would be one this morning
[22:38] that would be in a pit of despair,
[22:40] Father, Lord, that would be maybe a
[22:43] weward sheep caught in a thicket this
[22:45] morning. Father, would you reach down
[22:47] your hand this morning, Lord Jesus?
[22:50] Lord, draw us back onto that highway,
[22:53] that great highway that you have made
[22:55] for us, Lord,
[22:57] that leads into glory.
[23:00] Father, this morning we bring the needs
[23:02] before you that have been spoken out,
[23:05] Lord. The testimonies that have been
[23:07] uttered in your presence to bring glory
[23:10] unto your name.
[23:12] We see the mighty hand of Jehovah
[23:14] working amongst your people.
[23:17] Lord, we see the spiritual blind eyes
[23:20] coming open.
[23:22] We see the lame halt and the withered
[23:25] receiving back their strength.
[23:28] Lord, you know each and every life that
[23:30] is here and what we have come through.
[23:32] How we we how we can scream out in
[23:35] praise and thanksgiving for what you've
[23:37] done for us, Lord. For certainly there's
[23:39] no shortness of strength within us,
[23:43] Lord, to give you praise.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, our lips are certainly not feeble
[23:47] this morning. Our tongues are not
[23:49] swollen up in our mouths. But we can
[23:51] lift up our voices, lift up our eyes,
[23:55] from which cometh our strength.
[23:57] We give you praise this morning, Lord
[23:59] Jesus. Let us forget about the one who
[24:02] is standing beside us and focus our eyes
[24:04] upon you this morning.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; We'll be sure to give you all the praise
[24:09] and the glory and the honor. Lord, be
[24:11] with our ministering brethren this
[24:13] morning, Lord. Our pastors, he will come
[24:15] and stand behind the sacred desk. Lord,
[24:18] not desiring to speak something that he
[24:21] has concocted in his own mind. But Lord,
[24:23] we know that the burden of the word lays
[24:26] within the man. But it is responsibility
[24:28] of your people that set present this
[24:30] morning to pull upon the gift to
[24:33] activate the gift within the man. Lord,
[24:35] that we may receive the nutrients that
[24:37] we have need of for it. It is truly an
[24:39] individual walk. And we cannot glean
[24:42] that from which our neighbor has, but we
[24:44] must receive personally what you have
[24:46] for us this morning. Be with the
[24:49] remainder of the service, Lord. the
[24:50] songs that will be sung, the specials
[24:52] that will be lifted up to praise you and
[24:54] glorify you. We love you this morning,
[24:57] Father, from the depths of our heart.
[24:59] For truly, where would we be if it were
[25:02] not for this wonderful gospel that had
[25:04] come by our way?
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We give you the praise and
[25:09] the glory in Jesus name.
[25:12] Amen.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; You have your seats. God bless you. just
[25:19] going to make a short announcement
[25:21] because we're coming into a great time
[25:23] and that's called camp
[25:25] camp time. Bible camp time.
[25:28] So, um I would like to uh clarify a few
[25:32] points here uh this morning so that
[25:35] you'll be well aware of the time and the
[25:36] schedule starting next Sunday. And uh
[25:40] next Sunday morning um is only one
[25:42] service, an AM service here. And we
[25:45] would like all the children uh that are
[25:47] in for junior camp to be at the camp no
[25:50] later than three o'clock on the
[25:52] afternoon on Sunday. And uh counselors,
[25:55] if you can be there around 2:30, that
[25:56] would be great. We'd like you a little
[25:58] bit ahead of uh your campers coming in.
[26:01] Then on Tuesday and uh Monday and
[26:04] Tuesday will be just for the uh junior
[26:06] camp. Wednesday morning, the juniors
[26:09] leave and the seniors come in and we'll
[26:12] be having an evening service just for
[26:14] the seniors. That will be their evening.
[26:16] Then we'll be starting our uh meetings
[26:18] with brother Ron Spencer at 7:00
[26:22] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
[26:25] morning at 10:30. And I'm I'm really
[26:29] looking forward to a tremendous time.
[26:31] And it just seems the uh level of
[26:34] anticipation and speaking to the young
[26:35] people, speaking to the different
[26:37] counselors that uh God's going to do
[26:39] something very special this year. And
[26:41] I'm I'm looking forward to that. Also,
[26:43] in conjunction with that, next Friday,
[26:46] um brother Tom Frey is in charge of
[26:49] course over of uh raising the tent. And
[26:51] so next Friday, he'll be uh needing uh
[26:54] about six volunteers around 5:30
[26:58] uh on the guide meridian. uh I guess
[27:00] where you best say is um at the minute
[27:03] of vision uh part of the building there.
[27:06] If you are available Friday at 5:30,
[27:10] next Friday, six brothers that are on
[27:12] the US side, that'd be great. They're
[27:14] going to be loading loading up the tent
[27:15] on the trailer and the equipment that
[27:17] will be needed to put um put the tent
[27:19] up. Then we're going to need 16 to 20
[27:24] volunteers on the Saturday. That's the
[27:27] Saturday um before camp starts. And
[27:31] we're going to target the time at 400 pm
[27:33] US Canadian just hey if there's 25 or 30
[27:37] that's great. It's a it's a labor of
[27:39] love let me tell you to put that tent
[27:41] up. Everybody comes they enjoy the
[27:43] services and you know and they sit under
[27:45] a a tent but it takes a lot of grunt
[27:48] work to put that up and uh a lot of
[27:51] dedication. Teresa, she's shaking her
[27:53] head because Dalton did it for a number
[27:54] of years. So, we know what it takes.
[27:57] More hands make light work. If you're
[27:59] available on on the Saturday at 4:00,
[28:03] make your way down to the campgrounds
[28:05] and uh we'll be putting up the tent. And
[28:07] you can see brother Tom Frey right after
[28:10] the morning service in the fellowship
[28:11] room if you're available for the Friday
[28:13] night at 5:30 and the Saturday at 4:00.
[28:17] God bless you.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Tom. Um, Brother Jeremy,
[28:25] Brother Aaron, and Brother Jonathan have
[28:26] a song for us this morning while they
[28:28] come and get ready. Um,
[28:32] we want to welcome all those who are
[28:33] here visiting with us. Um, and a
[28:35] particular welcome to uh, Kevin,
[28:41] Mr. Kim, Michaela, and Megan Wall who
[28:43] are down from uh, down from Edmonton.
[28:47] And maybe we get them to stand. And I
[28:48] think a lot of people know them. And you
[28:49] can stand up. So just so that everybody
[28:51] see gets to see who you are.
[28:54] There they are. God bless you. Happy to
[28:56] have you here.
[29:00] Um
[29:02] there is a choir practice for the young
[29:05] people at 3:00 today here in the
[29:08] sanctuary, I think. Um
[29:15] and uh there is no senior choir practice
[29:19] tonight after the service.
[29:22] Um
[29:23] the deacons are requesting that the blue
[29:25] house. It's vacant. It's very dangerous
[29:28] and out of bounds. So parents keep your
[29:31] kids out of the house. Okay. So I know
[29:34] we got a lot of kids running around.
[29:36] kids, you know, I remember being a kid
[29:39] and if somebody says, you know, you
[29:40] can't do that, it meant that I just made
[29:43] sure that I did it. So, if you parents,
[29:46] you know, your children and you know, if
[29:47] they're that way inclined, you just put
[29:49] a leash around them. So, uh,
[29:52] appreciate that. And, uh, I think that
[29:55] is it, brothers.
[30:00] [Music]
[30:15] We hear about the wars and see famine in
[30:20] the land.
[30:22] There's questions in the children's
[30:24] eyes. Trouble in the east again.
[30:29] The whole world is shaking.
[30:32] There's no sure place to stand.
[30:36] And mournful sounds are heard throughout
[30:40] the land.
[30:47] &gt;&gt; I keep listening for a different sound.
[30:54] The sound of the sea that John saw
[30:58] coming down.
[31:01] The sound of the bride being united with
[31:06] the groom.
[31:08] I keep listening.
[31:12] I keep listening.
[31:15] I keep listening for a different
[31:21] sound.
[31:22] [Music]
[31:27] Well, we've heard the prophet say,
[31:30] "And it shall come to pass there will be
[31:35] a generation,
[31:37] and this one's the last." Well, I
[31:41] believe we're standing here at the end
[31:45] of time with a prophet's voice echoing
[31:50] in
[31:52] our mouth.
[31:58] And I keep listening for a different
[32:02] sound.
[32:04] The sound of the sea that jumps all
[32:09] coming down.
[32:11] The sound of the bride being united with
[32:16] the groom.
[32:18] I keep listening.
[32:21] I keep listening.
[32:25] I keep listening for a different
[32:30] sound.
[32:32] [Music]
[32:36] I keep listening for a different sound.
[32:42] The sound of a city that jumps all
[32:47] coming down.
[32:49] The sound of the bride being united with
[32:54] the groom.
[32:55] The sound of the chorus singing glory to
[33:00] the lamb.
[33:02] I keep listening.
[33:06] I keep listening.
[33:09] I keep listening.
[33:12] I keep listening.
[33:16] I keep listening for a different
[33:21] different sound.
[33:24] [Music]
[33:26] [Applause]
[33:29] I keep listening for a different sound.
[33:35] The sound of a city that jumps are
[33:39] coming down.
[33:41] The sound of the bride being united with
[33:45] the groom.
[33:47] The sound of the chorus singing glory to
[33:52] the lamb.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; I keep listening.
[34:07] I keep listening for a different
[34:11] [Music]
[34:12] different sound,
[34:25] &gt;&gt; man. Have you heard that different
[34:26] sound?
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[34:29] It's not an uncertain trumpet. Amen.
[34:32] We've heard
[34:36] voice of God in this day. I trust your
[34:40] listening this morning, you'll be able
[34:42] to hear that different sound again as
[34:43] our pastor comes to speak. And as he
[34:46] does, let's uh turn to number 2545
[34:50] on the screen. You are my strength when
[34:52] I am weak. You are the treasure that I
[34:55] seek. Amen. Where your treasure is,
[34:59] Amen, that's where your heart is also.
[35:01] Amen. I trust you're laying up treasure
[35:03] on the other side.
[35:11] You are my strength when I am weak. You
[35:16] are the treasure that I seek. You are my
[35:21] all.
[35:24] [Music]
[35:28] Seeking you as the precious Jew. I want

[36:28] Lord, when I fall down, you lift me up.
[36:33] When I am dry, you fill my cup. You are
[36:38] my all and all.
[36:43] Oh Jesus,

[38:33] God

[38:41] [Music]
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:48] Lord,
[38:50] [Music]
[38:52] unlikely.
[38:56] Lovely Lord Jesus.
[38:59] Lovely Lord Jesus.
[39:02] [Music]
[39:09] Let's just bow our heads before we open
[39:11] the word
[39:13] once again.
[39:15] Oh, dear heavenly father.
[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] You're the author of this word that we
[39:23] have before us, the author of this book.
[39:26] And as your prophet has said, any man
[39:28] with strength may turn its pages, but
[39:33] only you can open up what is locked
[39:36] inside.
[39:38] And so we ask earnestly that you would
[39:41] send the Holy Spirit
[39:44] to each one.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; We are individuals.
[39:48] And as your prophet said also, we all
[39:51] have that human spirit, that individual
[39:54] spirit. We all have that spirit. But
[39:57] Lord, we pray and I ask now that the
[40:01] Holy Spirit will come and take dominion
[40:04] over every human spirit in the name of
[40:08] Jesus Christ and a control, oh God,
[40:11] every mind and every human spirit for
[40:14] the glory of God. We ask it for the same
[40:18] purpose, Lord. That the messenger asked
[40:20] it. That the name of Jesus Christ might
[40:24] be glorified amongst the saints, Lord,
[40:27] in this community of believers, Father.
[40:30] And not only those visible, but those
[40:32] that are connected with us now, oh God,
[40:35] from whatever country, whatever time
[40:38] zone, whatever place they are in, I pray
[40:41] that you will fill the atmosphere of
[40:45] every place. Oh God, and throughout this
[40:47] building here, be it the nursery or the
[40:50] fellowship room, I pray that you will
[40:53] fill, oh God, this sanctuary also with
[40:56] your divine nearness and your divine
[40:59] presence, your personal presence.
[41:03] Lord, you're doing wonderful things and
[41:05] we are so thankful for that.
[41:08] We pray now that you will be honored and
[41:11] glorified. We're asking especially for
[41:14] the upcoming meetings. We call it family
[41:18] camp, but oh God, every service is a
[41:21] family camp. We are here for the entire
[41:24] family of God and for our families,
[41:28] Father, we are brothers and sisters in
[41:31] Christ. I pray for any weak one, Lord. I
[41:34] pray for any that may be afflicted and
[41:37] sick, any that may have an infirmity.
[41:40] May Satan be defeated at this moment and
[41:44] in your presence where the supernatural
[41:47] is happening. Not has happened or will
[41:50] happen but is happening. May it take
[41:53] place even now Lord as the believers
[41:57] believe upon you. Oh Lord Jesus. Oh Lord
[42:03] Jesus.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; Lamb of God, sacrifice of Calvary.
[42:09] Hallelujah.
[42:10] Hope of the world. Our blessed bride
[42:14] crew.
[42:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[42:19] Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
[42:23] I'll have you open your Bibles
[42:26] immediately to Luke the 24th chapter,
[42:29] and we're going to read some verses. God
[42:32] bless you, Brother Matthew. Nice to have
[42:35] you all here. While you're turning in
[42:38] your Bibles, I would ask this
[42:40] congregation to
[42:43] hold the uh meetings up in prayer that
[42:45] we're going to be having, the entire
[42:47] family camp. It's always such a blessed
[42:50] time. I have uh just so enjoyed over the
[42:55] years the the services even for the
[42:59] junior camp and the presentations and
[43:02] the impact
[43:04] uh scriptural and spiritual impact upon
[43:07] the young people. It's been marvelous.
[43:10] And we've just had too many in the tank
[43:14] at bapt for baptism requesting baptism
[43:17] who when they arrived to 12 and 13 and
[43:20] 14 years old they their testimony was
[43:23] that God spoke to them at camp. It's
[43:26] just been so powerful and uh so we want
[43:29] to pray for those that are participating
[43:32] and there are so many uh I think of
[43:35] brother Tom Frey he's been scurrying
[43:37] around putting up the tents and enormous
[43:40] responsibility and all of you brothers
[43:42] who assist God bless you those that are
[43:46] connected and having to work with the
[43:48] sound and the lighting uh so we have
[43:52] lights and getting the chairs and
[43:55] everything put in. There's a lot that
[43:57] goes behind the scenes. The sisters that
[44:01] care for the kitchen. We are maxed out
[44:03] completely. Can't handle any more in the
[44:07] in in in the as far as feeding the
[44:09] people is concerned. That that doesn't
[44:12] disappoint me. That thrills me. I just
[44:15] max the thing right out, you know. And
[44:17] uh can we put one more in? I don't know.
[44:20] But we'll if they want to sleep on the
[44:22] floor, that might be a possibility. But
[44:24] it's maxed right out. That's what I like
[44:27] to see.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; That's what I rejoice in.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; And to have a speaker, Brother Ron
[44:35] Spencer, coming. Uh, Brother Ron has
[44:39] been raised in the in the message. And
[44:43] uh he has a long
[44:46] uh I would say long time having lived
[44:50] and seen what God can do. His father is
[44:54] a pastor and I'm a real man of faith and
[44:57] I have I respect him. I have never been
[45:01] to his church to preach but I went to a
[45:03] church in 1978
[45:05] and spoke at that time he was an
[45:08] associate minister in that particular
[45:11] church and now later many many years ago
[45:14] now uh has a church in another city. I
[45:18] can't even tell you the city at this
[45:20] moment. But uh we just appreciate
[45:22] brother Ron and uh he is preparing. He's
[45:26] speaking in Edmonton today. He'll be
[45:28] returning home and he's taking the rest
[45:30] of the week to rest and just prepare
[45:34] himself for these meetings. And then
[45:36] just after I believe August the 26th,
[45:39] Brother Zephaniah Peters from Tanzania
[45:42] is going to be spending several days
[45:44] with us. I have been to brother
[45:45] Zephaniah's church. Brother Zephaniah
[45:49] lives on the old family farm and many of
[45:52] you no doubt have heard of Mount
[45:54] Kilimanjer,
[45:56] very famous mountain in in Africa and
[45:59] Tanzania. Well, brother Zephaniah Peters
[46:02] lives at the foot of that mountain. And
[46:05] so we we were up close to it. It's still
[46:08] a rugged country and uh but he is a man
[46:12] of the word and man who loves this
[46:14] message has been very instrumental in
[46:16] spreading it throughout the area of East
[46:20] Africa. So we just are thankful that
[46:23] they'll be able to share some things
[46:24] with us.
[46:26] We'll turn in our Bibles to Luke the
[46:28] 24th chapter which is the uh text once
[46:33] again for modern events made clear by
[46:38] the prophecy. So we are reading uh a
[46:42] portion of this prophecy going to start
[46:44] reading at verse
[46:47] uh verse 13 which is the beginning of
[46:51] the text I believe brother Brandham
[46:53] read.
[46:54] And behold, two of them went the same
[46:57] day to a village called Emmus, which was
[47:01] from Jerusalem about three score
[47:03] furlongs, something over six miles. Some
[47:06] say it's about seven miles. Brother Bram
[47:08] said it's about six miles. And they
[47:10] talked they talked together of all these
[47:14] things which had happened. And it came
[47:17] to pass that while they communed
[47:19] together and reasoned, Jesus himself
[47:23] drew near and went with them, and their
[47:27] eyes were holden that they should not
[47:29] know him. That's the sovereignty of God.
[47:32] And he said unto them, "What manner of
[47:35] communications
[47:36] are these that you have one to another
[47:39] as you walk and are sad?" And one of
[47:42] them whose name was Cleopus answering
[47:45] said unto him, "Art thou only a stranger
[47:48] in Jerusalem, and hast not known the
[47:51] things which are come to pass there in
[47:53] these days?"
[47:55] And he said unto them, "What things?"
[47:59] And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus
[48:01] of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty
[48:04] in deed and word before God and all the
[48:07] people, and how the chief priests and
[48:09] our rulers delivered him to be condemned
[48:12] to death, and have crucified him. But we
[48:15] trusted that it had been he which should
[48:19] have redeemed Israel. And beside all
[48:22] this, today is the third day since these
[48:25] things were done. Yay. And certain women
[48:28] also of our company made us astonished,
[48:32] which were early at the seere. And when
[48:35] they found not his body, they came,
[48:38] saying that they had al they had also
[48:41] seen a vision of angels, which said that
[48:44] he is alive.
[48:46] And certain of them which were with us
[48:49] went to the sephiler, and found it, even
[48:51] as the women had said, but him they saw
[48:55] not. And he said unto them, "Oh fools
[48:58] and slow of heart to believe all that
[49:00] the prophets have spoken, ought not
[49:03] Christ to have suffered these things,
[49:06] and to enter into his glory?" And
[49:09] beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
[49:13] he expounded unto them in all the
[49:15] scriptures the things concerning
[49:18] himself. May God bless his word. And you
[49:21] may have your seats. Keep your Bible
[49:23] open if you would, please. Just uh a few
[49:26] comments before we turn to the content
[49:30] of the message. The scripture tells us
[49:33] that they talked together.
[49:36] I'd like you to pay strict attention to
[49:40] who it was that Jesus himself drew near
[49:46] and what it was that they were doing and
[49:50] what it was that they were speaking
[49:52] about. The scripture says that they
[49:55] talked together of all the things which
[49:59] had happened and communed together and
[50:02] reasoned. When Jesus asked them, "What
[50:07] are these communications?" In other
[50:09] words, what is what is your confession?
[50:12] What is the manner of communications?
[50:15] What are you talking about? Now, they
[50:18] could have been talking about Judas and
[50:20] his betrayal and what a terrible thing
[50:23] that was. They could have been talking
[50:25] about Peter and his denial and what uh a
[50:29] weakness that seemed to be. They could
[50:32] have been talking about the apostles and
[50:34] those that were supposed to be ministers
[50:37] and they were hiding in a locked room
[50:40] someplace. They could have been talking
[50:42] about all kinds of things of the church,
[50:45] but that's not what they were talking
[50:46] about. They were consumed with the
[50:49] scriptures and the things that had taken
[50:51] place and where they were presently in
[50:54] the word. Now, that is your that is uh
[50:58] uh your example of where we should be
[51:01] and what we should be doing and what we
[51:03] should be focused on. Their focus was on
[51:06] what was happening, but they couldn't
[51:08] see it. their eyes were holden. And I
[51:10] think it's a marvelous thing that God in
[51:13] his sovereignty, even though he was
[51:15] holding that back from them, yet he knew
[51:18] that he was going to reveal that to
[51:20] them.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus himself, the scripture says, went
[51:25] with them. That was unexpected,
[51:28] unplanned by them, unplanned by us. You
[51:32] don't know but what. And I'm not going
[51:35] to say but what that same Lord Jesus. I
[51:38] want to say to you in all authority that
[51:42] same Lord Jesus Christ has been proven
[51:46] resurrected
[51:48] &gt;&gt; in the evidenced by this message that we
[51:52] stand and are identified with
[51:56] &gt;&gt; and he went with them. They didn't know
[51:59] it but he went with them.
[52:02] He is he has gone with us so often when
[52:06] we didn't realize it. He went with you
[52:10] and while you were speaking about all
[52:12] kinds of things now
[52:15] they they were talking about what had
[52:18] just happened and Jesus was going to
[52:21] unfold to them what was actually
[52:24] happening at that moment and that's a
[52:26] very very important key
[52:30] the manner of conversation but they said
[52:33] in verse 21 but we trusted this is where
[52:37] they're trusted We trusted that it would
[52:39] have been he who would have redeemed
[52:42] Israel. And that is why I am I'm not
[52:46] wanting once again to speak of some
[52:49] sermon. I am dwelling in the last four
[52:52] services that the prophet of God left
[52:55] us. And as far as I am concerned, they
[52:59] are prophetic. They were actually
[53:01] prophetic. And this is his second last
[53:04] one from this one. The next night was
[53:06] leadership. And I've said and I'm
[53:09] repeating it. I know that you that catch
[53:11] on and you have good retention, mental
[53:13] retention, you must not be bored because
[53:16] this is not something that we merely say
[53:19] again because we think that you're not
[53:21] getting it, but because it needs to
[53:23] become a part of us. He is talking about
[53:25] the change of a destination, which is
[53:28] the rapture from December the 4th to
[53:30] December the 7th leadership. And in
[53:32] leadership, one man ends up in hell and
[53:35] one man ends up in heaven.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And those are the two destinations. And
[53:40] that's what we're talking about. And as
[53:42] far as this congregation is concerned,
[53:44] that's what's going to happen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Some are going to end up where Moses
[53:48] ended up. And some are going to end up
[53:49] where the rich young ruler ended up. And
[53:51] we're here to preach one gospel that we
[53:54] might end up in a rapture.
[53:58] Amen.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you this morning as
[54:02] you sit and are attentive to your
[54:06] identification
[54:07] for rapture. Your personal ID,
[54:14] your personal identification for
[54:17] rapture. Now Jesus when he was walking
[54:21] with these, the scripture says where we
[54:23] concluded and beginning at Moses and all
[54:28] the prophets, he expounded unto them in
[54:32] all the scriptures the things concerning
[54:36] himself
[54:39] himself. He identified himself in the
[54:44] scripture. Not what he had been
[54:49] or something in the future, but he
[54:53] identified himself as to what had just
[54:56] was taking place at that moment. Now,
[55:02] even in my short lifespan,
[55:04] identification has become a very very
[55:06] important thing.
[55:10] You people that are here today, many of
[55:12] you have crossed the border and I can
[55:15] assure you, you that have traveled and
[55:17] many of you have come from other
[55:19] countries, you do not do so without
[55:23] identification.
[55:25] You've got to carry that with you. Now
[55:28] today in the banks it's important all
[55:31] kinds of uh your driver's license all
[55:34] kinds of things even for children and
[55:36] for babies and infants we have to have
[55:39] some ID. I want you to think about a
[55:42] spiritual identification. We won't
[55:44] travel very far or transact very much
[55:48] business until we have not only
[55:51] identification but they want to have a
[55:53] picture ID.
[55:56] They want to know that it is you that
[55:59] they're talking about and looking at.
[56:03] Now,
[56:06] we could have identification. You know,
[56:09] there's uh we're we're all identified
[56:11] with a a nation or a country or a
[56:14] citizenship.
[56:16] Is this working here? All right. Thank
[56:18] you. Uh but you know, there are some
[56:22] countries that don't exist anymore.
[56:25] Uh, what would you do if you had a
[56:27] passport for Abdon
[56:30] or a passport for Edron Edosia
[56:35] or Olympia, which of course I'm sure
[56:37] you're acquainted with the name. What
[56:39] about Prussia? Where my grandfather came
[56:42] from? It doesn't exist anymore because
[56:44] the borders have shifted all over. He
[56:46] was in the Austrian Prussian uh uh
[56:49] kingdom and that doesn't exist anymore.
[56:53] Uh we have brother brother Milco here.
[56:56] He had a has a a Yugoslavian passport
[56:59] and uh Yugoslavia is no more. It's a
[57:03] bunch of other countries that have been
[57:05] all divided and have become individual
[57:07] sovereign states. And so there is no
[57:10] such a thing. all kinds of uh uh
[57:12] Rhodesia of course became uh uh uh Mos
[57:17] not Mosmbique but Z uh Zimbabwe and
[57:21] nations have changed. Southwest Africa
[57:23] became Namibia and Southwest Africa
[57:26] those passports you may have your
[57:28] picture you may have your identification
[57:30] in there and so on but the country is no
[57:32] more
[57:34] &gt;&gt; doesn't exist.
[57:36] So although they did exist at one time,
[57:39] you cannot be identified merely with
[57:42] history.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; And spiritually it's the same way.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; We belong to something and God long left
[57:48] the thing. The identification just
[57:51] doesn't work.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Now what is identification?
[57:57] Identification
[57:58] and it's a very important that you grasp
[58:01] this for the whole rest of the service
[58:03] is the act or the process of showing to
[58:08] be the same.
[58:11] The act or the process of you being able
[58:15] to show that you are the same.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[58:19] It is also the state of being shown or
[58:23] proved to be identical.
[58:27] Jesus was showing these men on the way
[58:31] to Emmas that he was in fact the
[58:36] identical one who was spoken of in the
[58:39] scripture.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Not like it,
[58:42] &gt;&gt; not merely a fulfillment of the type.
[58:46] While those were maybe in types and
[58:48] shadows, but it's more than just types
[58:50] and shadows, friends. It the life that
[58:53] he was now living and walking before
[58:56] them was the identical one that was
[58:59] spoken of in the scripture.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Not just a picture, not just a fuller
[59:03] meaning. He was that one. Yes.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like I'd like if you would go
[59:10] to your uh across the border here and
[59:13] try to go go into the states or come
[59:15] back and forth across the border and
[59:17] have your baby picture.
[59:22] You're smiling cuz none of you look like
[59:24] your baby picture. Very few carry that
[59:28] resemblance. But you are that one. You
[59:31] are in fact that identical person. You
[59:33] could say this is me
[59:39] but it won't work. Why? Because
[59:41] identification is also timesensitive.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Scriptural identification is time
[59:48] sensitive. You can't identify with
[59:50] history. You can't merely go into the
[59:52] back and say way back in history or
[59:54] sometime or or 20 years ago or 10 years
[59:56] ago or whatever more, well that was me
[59:58] back there. No, they want to see
[1:00:00] something current. They want to see a
[1:00:02] current life that's being lived right
[1:00:04] now.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And
[1:00:10] it is the state of being shown or proved
[1:00:14] to be identical. And identical is
[1:00:18] according Encyclopedia Britannica is
[1:00:20] absolutely
[1:00:22] the same.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The very same. This is not merely my
[1:00:27] likeness. This is me.
[1:00:30] This happens to be a current photograph
[1:00:33] of me.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I was getting
[1:00:39] a card, a nexus card
[1:00:42] and uh
[1:00:46] it got all bungled up in the office
[1:00:48] somehow
[1:00:49] and uh I got grumpy about it
[1:00:53] and it delayed and back and forth and it
[1:00:56] was just like the fine. give me that
[1:00:58] card. They said, "We have to take
[1:01:01] another picture." Well, that picture is
[1:01:04] so bad. I always put my wife's in front
[1:01:06] of it. I don't like them to see that
[1:01:09] unhappy unhappy scene. And and I I
[1:01:13] because I don't like to think that
[1:01:14] that's the way I'm looking right now. I
[1:01:16] walk up smiling to the or drive up
[1:01:18] smiling to the officer. I don't want him
[1:01:20] to see this. Very unhappy, but he
[1:01:23] doesn't know the background. I also was
[1:01:25] having some communications that wasn't
[1:01:27] very uh pleasant at the time. Why can't
[1:01:30] these people have their office in order
[1:01:32] and why do they have to take another
[1:01:33] picture and why do they have to drag
[1:01:35] this thing? Give me that card. And so
[1:01:38] it's not a very nice picture. Uh I know
[1:01:40] that a lot of you, you know, you get
[1:01:41] your passport picture and whatever more
[1:01:43] and it is your ID and when you look at
[1:01:44] it says, "Oh, wow." You know, isn't
[1:01:47] there some touchup artist here?
[1:01:51] I know one of our young couples that got
[1:01:53] married and you know by the time they
[1:01:55] get all the photograph touched up,
[1:01:57] somebody looked at the photograph of the
[1:01:59] groom and says, "Hey, this wasn't a
[1:02:02] photographer. He was a plastic surgeon.
[1:02:07] He had so fixed it up. They'll take that
[1:02:09] wart off and fix my hair, replace that
[1:02:13] tooth, and all the rest." And they'll do
[1:02:15] it.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; They'll do it. They'll fix you up. And
[1:02:18] when it gets all doctorred up, all you
[1:02:21] know, manufactured out, you look at it
[1:02:23] and you just smile. That's me.
[1:02:28] That's you after a lot of work is what
[1:02:30] it is.
[1:02:32] But we want our our ID. And there's a
[1:02:36] spiritual identification. So to be
[1:02:39] identical is absolutely the same. And to
[1:02:42] identify and brother Brandon spoke
[1:02:44] hundreds of times about a being
[1:02:46] identified. It is to assert or prove to
[1:02:50] be absolutely the same to join or unite
[1:02:53] with. That is what identification is all
[1:02:56] about. Now
[1:02:58] uh
[1:03:01] we were the same when we were babes,
[1:03:06] but we're much further down the road.
[1:03:09] And Apostle Paul said, and just bear
[1:03:11] with me as I lay a bit of a foundation
[1:03:13] here. Apostle Paul said, "When I was a
[1:03:17] child," he was a child. "When I was a
[1:03:20] child, I spake as a child and I thought
[1:03:24] as a child, but when I became a man, I
[1:03:28] put away childish things." He didn't
[1:03:30] cease being the same person. He was
[1:03:32] still absolutely the same. And he could
[1:03:35] identify with, "I did those things." Uh,
[1:03:37] you know, we did maybe childish and
[1:03:39] foolish things. There was a time when
[1:03:41] God could even wink at the ignorance of
[1:03:43] man, you know. But then when the season
[1:03:45] came when he provided them with enough,
[1:03:48] no more winking at their ignorance. You
[1:03:50] know, we're far down the road now. The
[1:03:52] message that we have, I I say the
[1:03:54] message that we have today and the
[1:03:56] maturity of the word should bring us to
[1:03:59] such a maturity that we're not back
[1:04:02] there in in childish spiritual things
[1:04:05] any longer.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:04:09] He said, 'I understood or my mind or the
[1:04:12] faculty of perceiving and judging. It
[1:04:15] was as though we were just children in
[1:04:18] the message things are to that things
[1:04:20] that are to be. Brother Brandon refers
[1:04:22] to when we were children. But he said,
[1:04:24] "So it is in your spiritual growth or
[1:04:26] your spiritual birth in things that are
[1:04:28] to be." I'd just like to remind you once
[1:04:30] again in throughout that message the
[1:04:32] prophet is taking from the natural to
[1:04:35] the spiritual says our lives were
[1:04:37] pre-planned. I guess you understand that
[1:04:40] he goes to the natural gene and it goes
[1:04:43] to the spiritual gene. The gene being
[1:04:46] the uh biological unit that carries the
[1:04:50] character of the parent. And he goes
[1:04:52] from that to the spiritual, from the
[1:04:54] natural conception to the spiritual
[1:04:57] conception, from the natural birth to
[1:04:59] the spiritual birth and and all through
[1:05:02] from the natural life and how things
[1:05:04] were prepared for you when you came and
[1:05:06] how when you were being conceived that
[1:05:08] your mother would crave for certain
[1:05:09] things because your body was calling for
[1:05:12] it. And he brings it right into the
[1:05:13] spiritual that that your body your your
[1:05:17] body that theophony body that one
[1:05:20] Apostle Paul talks about if this body be
[1:05:23] dissolved if this tabernacle be
[1:05:24] dissolved. It does not say we will have
[1:05:27] another one. We have another one. We
[1:05:31] have another one eternal in the heavens.
[1:05:35] Hallelujah.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And you have descended down here. You
[1:05:40] have descended and as far as the
[1:05:42] believer is concerned, your descent
[1:05:45] ended on earth and from here you will
[1:05:48] ascend to the unbeliever. His descent
[1:05:51] has not his or her descent has not
[1:05:54] concluded yet because there is a region
[1:05:56] below this one. And oh, I don't want to
[1:05:59] go any further than this. This is where
[1:06:02] this is a this is the stopping place as
[1:06:04] far as I'm concerned. From here it's on
[1:06:07] up higher and higher and out of here in
[1:06:11] from this body into another body and
[1:06:13] from that body into a glorified body
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; and from that realm to where as the
[1:06:20] prophet went beyond the curtain of time.
[1:06:22] I want to see Jesus. He's just a little
[1:06:24] bit higher.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go there too
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; by his grace.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; That's the hope of the believer.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; This is what we have trusted in. We have
[1:06:35] trusted that he would be the one that
[1:06:38] would re do full redemption and he has
[1:06:41] done so.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; And so he goes on in this message
[1:06:46] and said that uh so is your spiritual
[1:06:50] birth. You do things that you don't
[1:06:52] understand.
[1:06:56] You do things that you don't understand.
[1:06:59] when you were a little baby
[1:07:01] uh came to the altar speaking about a
[1:07:04] spiritual baby now came to the altar
[1:07:07] give your life to Christ you do such
[1:07:10] strange things you wonder why you did it
[1:07:13] but after a while when you mature as
[1:07:16] mature Christians then you understand it
[1:07:20] there's something picks up and you see
[1:07:23] why you had to do it I'm sure that
[1:07:26] everyone here can go back in your
[1:07:29] spiritual experience and say that was
[1:07:31] strange. That was really unusual. I
[1:07:35] don't even know why I did that. But you
[1:07:37] had to do it. It was just something that
[1:07:39] you had to do it. Your your your
[1:07:41] spiritual birth, he said your natural
[1:07:44] birth types your spiritual birth, how it
[1:07:46] fitted to you in this life as you grew.
[1:07:50] Everything fitted right in because you
[1:07:54] were made for that.
[1:07:57] Hallelujah. You don't understand and you
[1:08:00] will not understand everything. But he
[1:08:02] says, "Wasn't it strange? Wasn't it a
[1:08:04] strange thing the night that you
[1:08:06] staggered into the mission at the tent
[1:08:09] meeting or the little church somewhere?
[1:08:11] I hope someone staggers somewhere to a
[1:08:15] chair or a seat today and finds God in
[1:08:18] another way." Or you might say, "I'm a
[1:08:20] believer, but you can have the same
[1:08:22] experience that Cleopus and his friend
[1:08:24] had. They didn't know. You may be a
[1:08:26] believer, but you don't know. You don't
[1:08:28] recognize who's walking with you now at
[1:08:32] this time at this season of your life
[1:08:34] and what you may be going through. And
[1:08:36] yet, he went with them and he went with
[1:08:39] you and he is with you. But he's
[1:08:43] interested in knowing what are you
[1:08:44] communicating about? What are you
[1:08:46] speaking about? What is your focus? That
[1:08:48] depends on who it is, who he makes his
[1:08:51] self known to. What is your what are you
[1:08:54] consumed with? Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; And so it says that they uh and fell
[1:09:00] right at the altar. He said, "God knew
[1:09:02] before the foundation of the world." He
[1:09:04] said, "It seemed strange to you. It
[1:09:08] seems strange to you why you did it
[1:09:10] then, but now you understand.
[1:09:16] I've prayed with a lot of you that are
[1:09:17] seated here.
[1:09:19] I've been at at the chair or the bench
[1:09:24] or the car when you gave your life to
[1:09:27] Christ.
[1:09:28] I talked to you in perhaps a room and
[1:09:32] you sat on a sofa and before long or a
[1:09:34] restaurant and before long the Holy
[1:09:38] Spirit came upon you. It seems strange
[1:09:41] now. Seems strange now. It seemed
[1:09:45] strange then, but now you understand why
[1:09:48] that had to be. It had to happen that
[1:09:50] way. It had to happen that a certain
[1:09:52] person come by your way, said certain
[1:09:55] things to you, put a certain message in
[1:09:56] your hand. It had to happen that way. It
[1:09:59] all seems strange then, but it's not
[1:10:01] strange now because we've grown up from
[1:10:03] them.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "And you know what happened,
[1:10:11] and it's so fitting to you in this life
[1:10:13] and will also be in the life that is to
[1:10:17] come." Will also be in the life that is
[1:10:21] to come. The world and its life seems to
[1:10:25] advance as you mature. Everything seems
[1:10:28] to go right with you.
[1:10:30] I was talking to someone here just uh
[1:10:32] just this last week and they have small
[1:10:36] children
[1:10:37] and at 2 and a half years old less than
[1:10:40] three years old they've deter they've
[1:10:42] known how to take the mouse of a
[1:10:45] computer and to click it and to
[1:10:47] doubleclick it and to move it around and
[1:10:49] get what they want up on the screen. My
[1:10:51] goodness, that took me 15 years to learn
[1:10:55] how to do that.
[1:10:57] You said, 'Well, everybody's not exactly
[1:10:59] where you are, Brother Biscll. I'm glad
[1:11:02] or we wouldn't advance very fast in this
[1:11:04] world. But what is it? It is that
[1:11:06] everything has moved along with them and
[1:11:10] they have moved along with it. But we
[1:11:13] have moved along spiritually. I'm glad
[1:11:16] for the spiritual advancement that we
[1:11:18] have experienced. I'm glad to testify to
[1:11:21] you. I've had a spiritual advancement
[1:11:24] even in the last few weeks. Hallelujah.
[1:11:28] And you want to be able to say the same
[1:11:29] thing. I've been mulling these things
[1:11:31] over. I've been speaking about them.
[1:11:32] This is my communication. This is the
[1:11:34] thing I'm speaking about. This is what
[1:11:36] I'm hearing. This is what I sense in my
[1:11:39] spirit.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; What is a congregation experiencing? We
[1:11:44] need to experience this message is an
[1:11:46] ascension message. This message cannot
[1:11:50] leave you. This word cannot leave you in
[1:11:52] one place.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; You're either going forward and moving
[1:11:55] constantly up. It has a constant upward
[1:11:59] thrust.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And so it is spiritual.
[1:12:10] Spiritually.
[1:12:13] Now, it's good that we can identify
[1:12:19] Jesus Christ in the Old Testament
[1:12:23] and we believe that these certain
[1:12:25] scriptures have been fulfilled. It's
[1:12:26] good that we can identify John the
[1:12:29] Baptist.
[1:12:31] We know that he's spoken of in Isaiah.
[1:12:33] We know that he's spoken of in Malachi.
[1:12:37] And when he was asked, "Who are you?"
[1:12:41] He didn't say, "Gentlemen,
[1:12:46] friends, you know my parents, you know
[1:12:50] Elizabeth, Zachcharias,
[1:12:52] you know my background. I've lived here
[1:12:55] amongst you." No. No.
[1:12:59] That was not his ID.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; That was not his identification. Who are
[1:13:04] you? He said, "I am not I'm like. I am
[1:13:10] the voice of one crying in the
[1:13:12] wilderness. I'm exactly the same. I am
[1:13:15] that is my identification.
[1:13:18] When you read that, you are reading of
[1:13:22] me
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; specifically of me. Not one like me. I'm
[1:13:26] not one like that. That's not just a
[1:13:28] type.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Now watch. I want to put a I want to
[1:13:32] connect this. The God, listen to me,
[1:13:35] friends. the God
[1:13:38] who by his own life and spirit moved
[1:13:42] through Isaiah and then caused him to
[1:13:45] say the voice of one crying in the
[1:13:49] wilderness. That was not Isaiah's words.
[1:13:52] That was God's words.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And it was it was timesensitive for
[1:13:57] another season. And when the man came on
[1:14:01] the scene that was he was not just he
[1:14:04] was not merely the son of Elizabeth and
[1:14:06] Zachchariah he was in fact ordained of
[1:14:10] God to bear the life that would be this
[1:14:14] voice. So indeed he was that person.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; He was not just like it. He was that
[1:14:21] person.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Now it's good for you to be able to
[1:14:24] identify that. That's not sufficient.
[1:14:28] You've got to be able to you must be
[1:14:30] able to identify your own person and
[1:14:34] recognize fully that that's not just a
[1:14:37] type of me but in fact they lived that
[1:14:41] life that portion of their life. Listen
[1:14:43] now they in the past lived that portion
[1:14:46] of their life as a prophecy that would
[1:14:50] be fulfilled in me
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; in others like me.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; We'll get into that. I don't want you to
[1:14:57] think about that for a moment.
[1:15:00] You see, it's not sufficient
[1:15:03] for us to recognize that when Jesus
[1:15:07] spoke to Cleopus and his friend, it's
[1:15:10] not sufficient for us to think, oh, this
[1:15:12] is a an account of the resurrection,
[1:15:14] etc. That's all interesting.
[1:15:17] But now comes a prophet messenger.
[1:15:22] I want to nail this down. I want you
[1:15:24] branded with this that this is a
[1:15:28] prophecy. And if something is a prophecy
[1:15:32] that only speaks of another event that
[1:15:34] is forward, that event must be indeed
[1:15:38] lived out by another group of people or
[1:15:42] some other men, some other women. Are
[1:15:45] you listening to me?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And this prophecy which God God is only
[1:15:51] the true spirit of prophecy. And so God
[1:15:54] now causing the event to take place,
[1:15:58] causing Luke 24 to take place, causing
[1:16:02] two men who were not hiding in
[1:16:04] Jerusalem, two men who were not running
[1:16:08] to the tomb yet to see if what the women
[1:16:11] said was correct. They were walking down
[1:16:14] the pathway to uh to Emmus. And in their
[1:16:18] sooing, they were actually laying down a
[1:16:22] prophecy.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; They were living out a prophetic word
[1:16:31] because it's here.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But I declare, you never knew it was a
[1:16:36] prophetic word till a prophet comes in
[1:16:39] his second last service and says, "This
[1:16:42] is a prophecy." If it's a prophecy, I
[1:16:44] want to ask you, who's going to fulfill
[1:16:46] it? Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Where are the people?
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Who's the person?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Who's the person?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Who's the individual that's going to
[1:16:57] fulfill it? If this is a prophecy, who's
[1:16:59] going to fulfill it? Do you dare have
[1:17:01] the nerve, have the spiritual uh
[1:17:04] fortitude to say, I am going to fulfill
[1:17:06] that prophecy?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; That prophecyy's been laid down for
[1:17:11] myself.
[1:17:13] Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I see some of you aren't ready yet.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to get you ready.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; You're not ready to lay hold of that
[1:17:21] promise yet. You need to rise up
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; out of your doom and your gloom. You
[1:17:26] need to rise up out of your spiritual
[1:17:29] ignorance. You need to rise up out of
[1:17:31] your doubt and your fears. You need to
[1:17:33] rise up and shake yourself loose and
[1:17:36] say, "That is me." Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not say to the men these are
[1:17:44] know these are uh the these stories and
[1:17:47] these accounts if you look at them and
[1:17:49] you think about them then you'll see me
[1:17:50] in it. No
[1:17:53] twice now it says and he went into all
[1:17:55] the scriptures and the psalms and the
[1:17:58] prophets and spoke to them out of all
[1:18:02] the scriptures the things concerning
[1:18:04] himself.
[1:18:06] He did not speak about the things
[1:18:08] concerning you
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; because I declare I wasn't there but I
[1:18:15] have what the messenger has said he
[1:18:17] spoke about.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I got those scriptures. We'll go over
[1:18:21] them. He did not refer to Sarah
[1:18:26] and the feminine
[1:18:28] uh element of the Old Testament. He did
[1:18:31] not refer to Rebecca or Esther or Rahab
[1:18:36] or Ruth or these because they're left
[1:18:40] for another p another person another
[1:18:42] time.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; They he referred to the groom the things
[1:18:47] concerning himself, not herself. But
[1:18:51] there are scriptures here that are about
[1:18:54] herself.
[1:18:56] and it would wait for another time and
[1:18:58] wait for another season because it
[1:19:00] didn't fit then.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The picture ID didn't fit
[1:19:05] then. But it does now.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; It now fits.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Now there's come a woman on the scene.
[1:19:14] Now there has come a church on the
[1:19:15] scene. Now there has come a bride on the
[1:19:17] scene who's got the right kind of ID.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; A time sensitive
[1:19:26] We could not fit that if we just showed
[1:19:28] the babe of the church born at
[1:19:30] Pentecost. We could, it doesn't fit.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Read Corinthians and they had all kinds
[1:19:36] of immorality taking place and so on.
[1:19:39] Apostle Paul didn't ditch them. He knew
[1:19:42] it was just an infant church and they're
[1:19:44] doing all kinds of foolish sinful things
[1:19:46] and that God by the Holy Spirit would
[1:19:48] clean it up. He had confidence that God
[1:19:51] was going to uh take this church which
[1:19:53] he had given life and birth to and bring
[1:19:55] it to where it is today.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And beginning at Moses and all the
[1:20:03] scriptures, he expounded unto them in
[1:20:07] all the scriptures the things concerning
[1:20:10] himself. He didn't expound to them all
[1:20:12] the scriptures
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; because there's all kinds of scriptures
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; that have to do with other things other
[1:20:19] than himself even though he's in all
[1:20:21] those scriptures.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:20:28] this may be interesting for some of you,
[1:20:29] maybe for not all, but I will give it to
[1:20:32] you anyway because it's it's very very
[1:20:35] it's been impacting me. My wife even
[1:20:38] says just yesterday she said and I don't
[1:20:41] mind just telling you it's a little
[1:20:42] private conversation but she said you
[1:20:46] are having a different approach
[1:20:49] to the message. It's impacting you. It's
[1:20:51] it's having a different effect upon you
[1:20:53] and you're you're seeing it entirely
[1:20:55] different. And I said I was appreciated
[1:20:57] that because I know that it was nice to
[1:21:00] have someone who just seeing you from
[1:21:02] the exterior seeing that what is
[1:21:05] happening on the interior is having that
[1:21:08] kind of uh manifestation outwardly.
[1:21:14] I've been observing
[1:21:17] what this messenger has spoken
[1:21:22] and when he begins to emphasize it as he
[1:21:25] begins to introduce it in the message
[1:21:27] like the gene for example I won't go
[1:21:30] over it but the gene I think he talks
[1:21:33] about the gene 22 times
[1:21:36] once in 19 the gene of God in 33 years
[1:21:40] of ministry
[1:21:42] 1120ome
[1:21:45] messages. He speaks of the gene of the
[1:21:49] of of the body
[1:21:52] 22 times I believe it is once in 1964
[1:21:56] and 21 times in 1965
[1:22:00] and most of those 18 or 19 of them is in
[1:22:03] the last four services. I say to you,
[1:22:06] you want to mark that down. You want to
[1:22:09] make a mental note. God did not have an
[1:22:11] Elijah prophet on this scene to start to
[1:22:14] talk about the gene of God, the
[1:22:15] spiritual gene, the gene of God that
[1:22:17] that that biological unit in the that
[1:22:20] that he has sent forth into the world to
[1:22:22] carry his character.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; A messenger is just saying the gene the
[1:22:27] gene you're in a gene of God. You're in
[1:22:29] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:22:31] world. And what have you done? You've
[1:22:32] descended down here for a certain
[1:22:34] purpose to achieve a certain a certain
[1:22:37] objective, a spiritual objective. And
[1:22:40] when he's done, he sent the same power
[1:22:42] to take you back on up.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham uses the word
[1:22:51] identified with.
[1:22:55] He spoke it 125 times. That term
[1:22:59] identified with. He is identified with
[1:23:02] and we are identified with and you are
[1:23:04] identified with. But he phrased it in
[1:23:06] such a way 125 times from 1959. Nothing
[1:23:11] from 1947
[1:23:13] to 1959.
[1:23:16] From 1959 to 1965,
[1:23:20] 125 times. 77 of those times is in 1964
[1:23:26] just by itself. That one year. You don't
[1:23:30] have to be a very smart person to say
[1:23:33] God. Depends who you think was talking.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; If you think it's just a somebody from
[1:23:39] Kentucky speaking, then you've lost it
[1:23:42] already.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; But when you realize that God was making
[1:23:46] utterances
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; to me
[1:23:50] and he's trying to say something,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; we're identified with identified with.
[1:23:56] he's identified with. I don't often do
[1:24:00] this here.
[1:24:06] What was happening in Luke 24? What was
[1:24:09] happening? Nothing really happened until
[1:24:13] a stranger
[1:24:15] stepped onto the pathway and identified
[1:24:19] himself with two men.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. There was a lot of
[1:24:23] men walking on that pathway. A lot of
[1:24:25] people, a lot of men, women, I suppose,
[1:24:27] going back and forth, walking on that
[1:24:29] pathway. But this stranger, the
[1:24:31] resurrected one,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; identified himself with two men who
[1:24:38] couldn't recognize him yet. Hallelujah.
[1:24:42] And he has identified himself with this
[1:24:45] congregation of believers. And the
[1:24:47] believers of this message, they have
[1:24:49] been identified by the resurrected
[1:24:52] Christ. I'm going to prove that to you.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Before they knew who they were being
[1:25:00] identified with, he first identified
[1:25:02] himself with them. And by identifying
[1:25:06] himself with them, he automatically
[1:25:09] identified them with him.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; We have been identified with Christ.
[1:25:17] Whether you know it or don't know it,
[1:25:19] whether you have a revelation or whether
[1:25:21] your mind is still darkened, I can tell
[1:25:24] you we have been identified with him
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; because this message packs his personal
[1:25:31] presence.
[1:25:36] He said we should be identified with
[1:25:38] him. How? By living for him, not just a
[1:25:41] confession. And since he's our
[1:25:43] identification, then we should be
[1:25:46] identified with him by living for him.
[1:25:48] Again, the believing worshipper was
[1:25:51] identified with his sacrifice
[1:25:54] by the token. This book's already open,
[1:25:57] just waiting for the seventh seal to be
[1:26:00] identified with the coming of Christ.
[1:26:04] If you've lived in the days of Jesus or
[1:26:07] one of them, whatever it is, just think
[1:26:10] what group you'd be identified with. He
[1:26:12] said, "Think of it tonight." And I'd
[1:26:14] say, "Think of it this morning." In
[1:26:16] other words, put yourself back. And who
[1:26:18] would you be identified with?
[1:26:23] He said, "I'm happy today to be one of
[1:26:25] them being identified with the word
[1:26:27] which is Christ,
[1:26:30] identified with him, being baptized into
[1:26:32] him, we become identified." Have you
[1:26:36] been baptized?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; You have been identified with him.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Your identification,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; we become identified. Identified in his
[1:26:47] likeness, identified with his word,
[1:26:49] which is him. I am in Christ. I am his
[1:26:53] word.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; You need to say that to yourself. I am
[1:26:58] in Christ. I am his word.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just speaking about me. It's
[1:27:03] not something that's like me. This is
[1:27:05] absolutely the same.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; There is no difference.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; This is not poetic language. This is not
[1:27:12] something that is uh some mental, you
[1:27:15] know, exercise. It is the truth of God's
[1:27:19] word. It's something that an individual
[1:27:21] must come to.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; It's the word that's ascending.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; And the word becomes you.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Not only in you, but you become it.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; And that is why a prophet would go as
[1:27:35] far as to say she is him.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She is him. Why? Because
[1:27:44] there is not a even a a degree of
[1:27:47] difference between the life that he had
[1:27:49] and the life that she had. The life that
[1:27:52] the bridegroom had, the life that the
[1:27:54] bride has.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now
[1:28:06] I'm just I'm I'm actually taking you on
[1:28:08] a journey.
[1:28:12] We're moving on.
[1:28:14] We're going down a path today too.
[1:28:17] One day he said there was a man came up
[1:28:21] to him. He knew his name. He said, "Your
[1:28:24] name is Simon."
[1:28:25] Came up to Jesus. A man came up to Jesus
[1:28:29] and Jesus said, "Your name is Simon, but
[1:28:32] you will be called Peter from
[1:28:34] henceforth."
[1:28:36] A woman one time pressing the crowd,
[1:28:39] touched his garment, went her way back
[1:28:42] into the crowd. But Jesus had a way of
[1:28:44] knowing.
[1:28:46] Jesus had a way of knowing.
[1:28:49] He looked around and he saw the woman
[1:28:51] that had the blood issue and he said,
[1:28:54] "Thy faith has saved thee." That's what
[1:28:57] he did. He said these things, listen
[1:29:00] close now, these things did Jesus
[1:29:05] at AD33.
[1:29:09] The Jesus of 1954
[1:29:12] does the same thing and he is the
[1:29:16] resurrected one.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Prophet was speaking it was 1954. He
[1:29:21] takes a quantum leap from AD 1933. He
[1:29:25] said that was Jesus AD1 1933 and it's
[1:29:29] Jesus the same Jesus in this time at
[1:29:33] this meeting.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And it was the same from AD.33
[1:29:38] to 1954. I declare it's identically the
[1:29:41] same from 1954 to 2005. Here
[1:29:53] he is in Phoenix in 1954.
[1:29:56] We see if this Jesus is the same.
[1:29:59] Your house number is 11:54
[1:30:03] on McKinley Street
[1:30:05] and your name is CB
[1:30:09] Dwitt. Is that right? Go home
[1:30:14] and be made well
[1:30:18] and lay your hand on your wife in the
[1:30:20] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:24] Also in Phoenix, how Phoenix was blessed
[1:30:26] and how much they have to answer for
[1:30:30] in 1954. The first thing I say that
[1:30:34] you're not from this city, it's number
[1:30:36] one. You can count if you wish.
[1:30:39] Who's saying it? Jesus is saying it.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; William Brandham doesn't know these
[1:30:45] things.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying it.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; The same Jesus.
[1:30:52] The same Jesus
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; that we read about in Luke 24.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Not one like him. the same Jesus
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; resurrected and proving to this poor
[1:31:07] darkened
[1:31:08] lost Leodysian age that he's the same
[1:31:12] one
[1:31:14] once again.
[1:31:18] You're from a place called Burr Burgess
[1:31:22] or Burggon or Burgess. Yes, it sounds
[1:31:24] like he spelled B something. All right.
[1:31:27] You're fixing to go home tomorrow.
[1:31:30] You're going by bus, aren't you? Number
[1:31:33] one, you're not from this city. You're
[1:31:37] going home by bus.
[1:31:40] You're going home tomorrow
[1:31:42] and your name is Julia Majors or
[1:31:45] something like that. Is that right?
[1:31:48] You're suffering with a hernia. You have
[1:31:51] something on your left ankle. It's a
[1:31:54] growth. It's Is that right? not showing.
[1:31:59] The growth isn't showing, but it's on
[1:32:01] your ankle.
[1:32:06] Now, is this some man guessing at
[1:32:08] something
[1:32:10] or is this Jesus?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; How do you do, sir?
[1:32:22] Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:32:25] We are strangers. Are we sir? I don't
[1:32:29] know you. Never seen you in my life.
[1:32:31] Know nothing about you. Only God alone
[1:32:33] knows. Is that right? Just a moment. So
[1:32:37] to strengthen your faith.
[1:32:40] You do as I tell you. Will you do it? By
[1:32:44] the way, your name is Michael.
[1:32:47] They call you Mike. Your name is Pete.
[1:32:50] Your name is uh Peter. You'll be called
[1:32:54] Peter. You're Jonas, son of Jonas. Bar
[1:32:57] Jonah, but you'll be called Peter.
[1:33:01] They call you Mike, don't they? And your
[1:33:04] last names Jordan. Is that right? And
[1:33:08] don't you live at 718 Garfield Street?
[1:33:13] Go back there and rejoice. Jesus has
[1:33:17] honored you, making you well.
[1:33:20] in life story. I see you coming through
[1:33:24] some kind of a place where they're
[1:33:26] checking up on you or something. Oh,
[1:33:29] it's the immigration.
[1:33:31] You're from Canada. You're from Windsor,
[1:33:35] Ontario. Is that right? And you are an
[1:33:38] evangelist, a minister. Isn't that
[1:33:42] right? And your name is JW.
[1:33:45] Your name is Price Reed. JW Reed, I see
[1:33:51] it on the mailbox there where you see
[1:33:55] you taking the mail out.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Well, you're going home to be well now.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Who is that? William Brham. I say not to
[1:34:04] Jesus.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; The same one that said to Nathaniel, "I
[1:34:10] see you before Peter called you.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I see you under the tree.
[1:34:16] I see you getting the mail out of the
[1:34:18] mailbox.
[1:34:20] Your name is Eva
[1:34:23] and your last name is York
[1:34:25] and your house number is 6136
[1:34:29] Street. Is that right? You're going home
[1:34:32] to be well in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:35] May she go home and be made well
[1:34:40] out of Chicago. How do you do, sir?
[1:34:43] you're conscious that something's going
[1:34:45] on. That is, sir, the anointing of the
[1:34:49] Holy Spirit. And I claim that that is
[1:34:53] the power of the Lord Jesus that's
[1:34:56] raised from the dead. A man is
[1:34:59] approaching and he senses something. You
[1:35:02] sense something. He didn't tell him,
[1:35:04] "I'm sensing something." The prophet
[1:35:06] told him, "You are sensing something."
[1:35:12] That is absolute knowledge.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; That is absolute God sent knowledge.
[1:35:18] That's not a gift.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; That's not merely a gift. That's a man
[1:35:23] that's taken up and operating into
[1:35:25] another realm. Listen now friends. this
[1:35:28] generation and you people are
[1:35:31] responsible for what you do with this
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; and how
[1:35:39] you react to it
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; will actually have a great effect upon
[1:35:44] where you go spiritually now
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; and where you go eventually.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; If you think it's from God, you'll
[1:35:53] receive your benefit from him. If you
[1:35:56] think it's of Satan, you will get your
[1:35:59] benefit from there.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; I claim it's the power of the Lord
[1:36:08] Jesus,
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Christ that's raised from the dead. You
[1:36:12] believe that? Do you, sir?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I believe that. He said, "I've noticed
[1:36:17] you with an examination over the heart.
[1:36:21] You have heart trouble. It's a bad case
[1:36:24] blocking in the heart." And then another
[1:36:26] thing, you have a companion, a wife, and
[1:36:30] that wife is suffering and she has
[1:36:32] cancer. She has cancer. She's sitting in
[1:36:36] the audience now.
[1:36:38] Her spirit is moving in here and
[1:36:41] pulling.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; I want you serious people who know me.
[1:36:50] What am I supposed to do with that? And
[1:36:53] what are you supposed to do with that?
[1:36:56] And this mouth
[1:36:58] spoke a message.
[1:37:01] And this mouth said Luke 24 is a
[1:37:06] prophecy.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Now what are we supposed to do with
[1:37:10] that? We are supposed to confess it is a
[1:37:13] prophecy. Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, a prophecy which we
[1:37:20] would have no way of knowing. It was a
[1:37:22] prophecy. Listen, until God would send
[1:37:26] this kind of a ministry, this kind of a
[1:37:29] prophet to be able to go back and pick
[1:37:31] up those seed promises,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; rapturing promises,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; promises that now are not speaking of
[1:37:41] him, but promises that speak of another
[1:37:44] age and another group of people.
[1:37:47] Promise. and he would reserve it and
[1:37:49] hold it till one would come on the
[1:37:51] scene. And just before his lips are
[1:37:54] sealed, they're going to be sealed in
[1:37:56] about another two and a half hours.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; And just before his lips are sealed, he
[1:38:03] tells you this is a prophecy
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; said, "I declare that same Jesus
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; that was there that day is here that
[1:38:13] this day
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; and he is the same. He cannot change.
[1:38:18] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:20] forever. But those those phrases and
[1:38:22] those scriptures, they just run off our
[1:38:25] lips like so easy.
[1:38:28] It's a shame. Really
[1:38:31] ought to come from the very bottom of
[1:38:33] our soul.
[1:38:35] He's the same. Yes.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "Your wife
[1:38:48] has got cancer and her spirit is moving
[1:38:50] in here pulling." That is true.
[1:38:54] And you are a minister.
[1:38:56] You've preached the gospel
[1:38:59] and you're longing even at your age to
[1:39:02] be well and go back and preach the
[1:39:04] gospel again. Yes, sir. That is true.
[1:39:07] And your name is Reverend Robert L.
[1:39:12] Atkins.
[1:39:14] Is that right? Never seen you in my
[1:39:17] life. Go home, Mr. Atkins. Lay hands on
[1:39:21] your wife. Your heart trouble has left
[1:39:24] you
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; and your wife will be healed.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your heart trouble has left
[1:39:33] you and your wife will be healed. Oh my
[1:39:36] brother, my sister, how we need to be,
[1:39:38] we need to be precise. We need to be
[1:39:40] careful how we read it.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; This was a a divine a divine mind that's
[1:39:49] being uh made known and speaking and go
[1:39:51] and preach the gospel in the name of the
[1:39:54] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:39:58] Now,
[1:40:01] because that was not merely a man, I'm
[1:40:03] going to ask you, what am I? What are
[1:40:06] you supposed to do with this kind of
[1:40:09] identification?
[1:40:15] When I read Luke 24
[1:40:18] and Luke has said that this is what
[1:40:21] happened and Jesus walked with these two
[1:40:23] men and this is what they said and this
[1:40:25] is what he said.
[1:40:28] There isn't even a remote there's not
[1:40:30] even a remote twinge within me to lessen
[1:40:34] the uh effect of that or to lessen its
[1:40:38] its uh importance or to say well you
[1:40:40] know yeah well I know maybe it was the
[1:40:43] same uh no that was the resurrected
[1:40:46] Jesus Christ and I say with the same
[1:40:49] effect with the same pronunciation that
[1:40:51] this is the same Jesus Christ and until
[1:40:55] we get a hold of that until we grasp
[1:40:58] that it won't have its uh it won't have
[1:41:00] its full effect upon you. This is not
[1:41:02] merely a church, my brother, my sister.
[1:41:05] This is not merely another message as
[1:41:07] such. This is not merely a message that
[1:41:10] came to correct some certain doctrines
[1:41:12] and and to have some more groups around
[1:41:14] in the world. This is a message that God
[1:41:18] has sent for a specific purpose. And
[1:41:20] that purpose is to take a group of
[1:41:23] people that will defeat death. who's the
[1:41:26] last enemy to be destroyed is death. And
[1:41:28] a prophet comes and says, "This is a
[1:41:31] prophecy.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; A modern event made clear, not left
[1:41:39] foggy, not left fuzzy, not left clouded,
[1:41:42] not left veiled, unveiled. This is an
[1:41:46] event. It's been made clear. And it's my
[1:41:49] responsibility to make it clear to you,
[1:41:51] my brother, my sister. your
[1:41:52] responsibility to pray and say, "Oh God,
[1:41:55] open my eyes. Open my understanding.
[1:41:58] Help me to grasp
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; the hour I'm in.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Help me to see who I'm walking with."
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I attend Cloverdale Bible way, you
[1:42:11] know, I believe the message, etc.
[1:42:12] Malachi 4 and so on. It's much more than
[1:42:14] that.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's an idea you may have had 10 years
[1:42:18] ago.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You got to get a current picture. of
[1:42:22] what's happening now
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; and how you look now and how you fit in.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; We can identify
[1:42:36] with the unmistakable works
[1:42:40] of the resurrected Jesus Christ in his
[1:42:42] prophet and messenger.
[1:42:44] I just read these
[1:42:46] because you might say, "I believe it in
[1:42:48] Jesus.
[1:42:51] I want everybody's attention.
[1:42:54] I believe it in John the Baptist.
[1:42:59] I believe it in
[1:43:01] Wesley or Martin Luther, whatever more.
[1:43:04] I see where Luther was absolutely
[1:43:06] consumed and gripped with the just to
[1:43:07] live by faith. I I believe it. We hear
[1:43:10] of a shining angel that you know come to
[1:43:14] one of the messengers whatever Columbus
[1:43:16] I believe it was or Columba.
[1:43:19] We believe it. I believe that was Jesus
[1:43:22] Christ
[1:43:24] in 1954 and 1963
[1:43:27] and 19 I believe that the angels came.
[1:43:30] You will have to believe further than
[1:43:32] that.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; This did not happen. This did not take
[1:43:37] place. This laid down to prove the
[1:43:41] identity
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; of the messenger. And now it is up to
[1:43:46] you to grasp and lay a hold with
[1:43:49] everything that's in you of what was
[1:43:50] spoken concerning a bride, a woman.
[1:43:53] Because that's the whole purpose. That's
[1:43:55] the whole objective of the ministry is a
[1:43:57] wife for Jesus Christ.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; A wife
[1:44:08] for Jesus Christ.
[1:44:12] And that is the main purpose of this
[1:44:14] ministry.
[1:44:18] Now
[1:44:21] my
[1:44:25] he said when he was with them,
[1:44:30] brother Brandham says it so clearly. He
[1:44:32] was not telling that that was him.
[1:44:37] He said,
[1:44:40] "Let's go back a few moments and listen
[1:44:43] to the words quoted from himself."
[1:44:47] Now, you see, you can go from here and
[1:44:49] consider me a fanatic, that's perfectly
[1:44:51] fine. But I believe any servant of God
[1:44:56] that is lifted up into a prophetic
[1:44:58] office and passed through into an
[1:45:00] eternal realm and tell people what they
[1:45:03] did. I see you
[1:45:06] taking the mail out of your mailbox that
[1:45:08] happened in the past and he's standing
[1:45:10] there telling him in the present and
[1:45:13] also telling him what he will do.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; You go home and now you'll find it this
[1:45:19] way.
[1:45:22] And so he goes back and he says, "Watch
[1:45:24] here." The word itself, he was the word
[1:45:29] quoting the word of himself.
[1:45:33] The word itself quoting the word of
[1:45:36] himself. He said it twice. Not telling
[1:45:40] that he was that. He wasn't telling
[1:45:42] them. Listen, you you men are slow of
[1:45:45] heart, fools, and slow of heart to
[1:45:47] believe all the prophets. That's me. He
[1:45:50] didn't say that.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; He just quoted the scripture.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; And the scripture, when he quoted the
[1:45:57] scripture,
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; it finally came through. That was him.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He's identical with that scripture.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He has he was identifying himself in the
[1:46:08] scripture. You don't have to go out and
[1:46:10] say, "I'm bride." Mhm.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; You only have to quote the scripture
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; and people will see that you are that
[1:46:17] scripture.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; They know you're different,
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; but they don't know why you quote the
[1:46:24] scripture.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; And those that are ordained to life
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; will see it.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't know who I'm preaching to
[1:46:34] today, but I'm preaching to somebody.
[1:46:43] Not telling that he was that,
[1:46:47] but just let the word speak for itself.
[1:46:51] Then they know who he was. The letter of
[1:46:56] the word quoting he said the word in
[1:46:58] flesh quoting the word of the letter.
[1:47:02] Amen.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Now, we here today, there's perhaps not
[1:47:06] all, but a good number of you would have
[1:47:09] the courage, the spiritual courage and
[1:47:12] the spiritual revelation, personal
[1:47:15] revelation to be able to say, I am the
[1:47:18] word in flesh today.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I am the promise of God. Now, you all
[1:47:24] you need to do is quote that word.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You quote it and it identifies who you
[1:47:30] are. You don't even have to go right out
[1:47:32] and say it.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Anybody say, "I'm a Christian." They're
[1:47:37] not much showing on the outside. They
[1:47:39] ought to be able to come up to you and
[1:47:40] say, "I see you're a Christian. I see
[1:47:43] you're different. I know a lot of
[1:47:45] Christians, but you're different."
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is it? It is the word
[1:47:51] in flesh giving testimony to the written
[1:47:54] letter.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; They know the letter. Brother Benham
[1:47:57] says, "These men, they knew the
[1:47:59] scripture. They knew all about him. But
[1:48:01] is when he began to quote
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; the scripture, certain scripture
[1:48:08] concerning himself.
[1:48:16] I'm going to pass by some of this.
[1:48:20] He says he goes straight to the word of
[1:48:22] prophecy about himself.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; About himself.
[1:48:28] Now, there's a prophetic word that's
[1:48:31] laid out for us. I'm interested in in
[1:48:33] the word that's laid out for you.
[1:48:38] the prophetic word seed that's laid out
[1:48:42] see
[1:48:44] the church world today and Christianity
[1:48:46] today and even within the message we can
[1:48:49] get consumed with taken up and and
[1:48:51] trying to instruct the people about your
[1:48:53] life right now and and your you know to
[1:48:55] have things better socially or have
[1:48:57] things better financially or all kinds
[1:48:59] of counseling that way I'm interested in
[1:49:01] one thing I'm interested in finding
[1:49:03] those seed promises which have been
[1:49:07] identified by this messenger for this
[1:49:10] hour for my ascension. I want out of
[1:49:13] here.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Do you want out of here?
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that that ministry was sent to
[1:49:21] identify those specific scriptures that
[1:49:24] are to be laid a hold of by the
[1:49:26] believing bride of Jesus Christ. And
[1:49:28] that power has the word to ascend you
[1:49:31] out of here.
[1:49:33] The same God that brought you here in
[1:49:36] this descent is the same God that's
[1:49:38] going to take you out of here. And he
[1:49:40] already laid everything out.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; He laid the vegetables out. He laid all
[1:49:45] the fruit out. He laid everything out
[1:49:47] that you need to sustain this body. And
[1:49:49] he laid everything out here.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; That you need for that body.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And for that that next realm, that next
[1:49:59] life, that next place.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. that he spoke so much about.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Now, let me go quickly because I've got
[1:50:09] to bypass some for our our limitation of
[1:50:13] time.
[1:50:16] David,
[1:50:18] he said,
[1:50:20] and it was Christ. Now, notice, please,
[1:50:23] it was Christ in David. It wasn't David
[1:50:27] going through a dark spell. It wasn't
[1:50:29] David. God may have allowed
[1:50:31] circumstances to come and he what is
[1:50:34] happening in my life etc etc and then
[1:50:36] something comes over me he cries out all
[1:50:38] my bones they stare at me
[1:50:44] him
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; he thought it was personal but it was
[1:50:48] Christ in him speaking a prophecy of a
[1:50:52] future age
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; and Jesus went back
[1:51:01] to those and gave. Are you with me?
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; He went back to those and the prophet
[1:51:06] brings all kinds of he said in
[1:51:08] Zachchariah he was forsaken of his
[1:51:10] disciples in Psalms 35:11. He was
[1:51:13] accused by false witnesses. David
[1:51:16] thought he was speaking of himself.
[1:51:19] He said Isaiah 53 and7 he was dumb
[1:51:23] before his accusers. Isaiah 50 and6 they
[1:51:26] scourged him. The prophet said Psalms
[1:51:29] 22, he was to cry on the cross and and
[1:51:32] here is Psalms 22. David saying, "My
[1:51:35] God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?
[1:51:39] Me." He thought it was him. It was a
[1:51:42] prophecy for another time.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Two men on the way to Emmas. They're
[1:51:50] going through a time of questioning what
[1:51:52] we've believed and what we have
[1:51:54] happened. And we're communing together.
[1:51:56] and were speaking about these things. It
[1:51:58] wasn't them. They were speaking of
[1:51:59] another time.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; And then the same David
[1:52:07] in and he in in the 27th chapter, he
[1:52:11] says, "Oh, one thing I've desired of the
[1:52:14] Lord."
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He was speaking prophetically of another
[1:52:20] people that were to come in this time.
[1:52:23] And God would send a prophet and go back
[1:52:25] to that prophecy and say, "That's you."
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in
[1:52:36] his pavilion.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble, that was Christ
[1:52:44] in him answering in prophetic way,
[1:52:48] answering to the to the fulfillment now
[1:52:51] that's in you.
[1:52:57] He gave the prophecy Christ in him.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; In the time of trouble,
[1:53:06] he'll hide me.
[1:53:08] In Psalms 22, he's speaking of the
[1:53:11] bridegroom.
[1:53:12] In Psalms 27, he's speaking about his
[1:53:15] wife.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:20] Jesus on the way to Emmas did not go
[1:53:22] back to Psalms 27, I guarantee you
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; and say to them, "In the time of
[1:53:27] trouble, he'll hide me in this
[1:53:29] pavilion." That wouldn't have fit.
[1:53:33] That would not have fit. They'd look at
[1:53:36] it and say, "That's that somehow that's
[1:53:38] not the same identification."
[1:53:41] But when he spoke to them of the
[1:53:44] prophecies concerning himself,
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and their eyes were opened
[1:53:57] in the time of trouble.
[1:54:00] And in the secret of his tabernacle
[1:54:03] shall he hide me.
[1:54:05] He shall put me upon a rock.
[1:54:09] speaking of his wife.
[1:54:17] The message is full
[1:54:20] of prophecies.
[1:54:22] Enoch.
[1:54:23] Enoch.
[1:54:25] I don't care what church you came from.
[1:54:28] I don't care what background you have. I
[1:54:33] will say presumptuously and with great
[1:54:36] confidence, you never had another person
[1:54:40] except this messenger tell you Enoch
[1:54:44] spoke of you.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; You never had another messenger take his
[1:54:49] life and tie it and say and tie it up
[1:54:51] with Jude and say the seventh from Adam.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; That starts to speak to us. The seventh
[1:54:59] from Adam. And the same messenger says,
[1:55:02] "You're in the seventh church age.
[1:55:03] You're the seventh from the second Adam,
[1:55:05] Jesus Christ."
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; By faith, Enoch was translated. But
[1:55:14] before he was translated, he had this
[1:55:16] testimony that he pleased God.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; And we have one now. He could only do
[1:55:25] that by God's. There was nothing in his
[1:55:28] flesh. Nothing in the flesh of Enoch. He
[1:55:32] was Christ and Enoch.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And Enoch was not speaking of the groom.
[1:55:37] He was speaking of the bride of the
[1:55:38] wife.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And so it's Christ and Enoch. And when
[1:55:44] Christ came,
[1:55:46] God
[1:55:48] signified by a voice from heaven, "Thou
[1:55:51] art my beloved son in whom I am well
[1:55:55] pleased.
[1:55:56] Hallelujah. In whom I'm well pleased.
[1:55:59] And the Apostle Paul, his messenger, oh
[1:56:02] my, I have so much to say. Help me out.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; His Apostle Paul comes after he met him
[1:56:08] on the road to Damascus and tells the
[1:56:10] Ephesians, what is Ephesians? Our
[1:56:12] inheritance book. Our inheritance is
[1:56:15] your inheritance. Are you going to claim
[1:56:16] your inheritance? You are accepted in
[1:56:19] the beloved. Hallelujah. And he was well
[1:56:23] pleasing. Amen. It's not what you can do
[1:56:26] or what you can achieve. Your
[1:56:28] righteousness is as filthy rags.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You can do absolutely everything right
[1:56:32] that will not please God. And this is no
[1:56:35] allowance for sin. I'm not saying that.
[1:56:37] But there's no way you can achieve it.
[1:56:39] We are accepted in the beloved. He's
[1:56:42] already been accepted. God has already
[1:56:44] accepted you.
[1:56:49] Hallelujah.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And so Enoch,
[1:56:56] he walked with God. I'd like to just
[1:56:58] bring a little something out before we
[1:57:01] go on. Enoch had two life test. He
[1:57:05] testified of two lives.
[1:57:08] He had a he had a natural life force in
[1:57:11] him that gave birth
[1:57:16] to Methuselah.
[1:57:19] So the life that was in him,
[1:57:22] one life that he testified to was not
[1:57:26] going to break could not break the 1,000
[1:57:29] day
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; season.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; But he had another life in him
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; that could break it.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; We have a life. This mortal life, it
[1:57:42] cannot break it. Methuselah lived 969
[1:57:46] years but could not break the thousand
[1:57:48] year. Uh God in the day thou eatest in
[1:57:51] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[1:57:53] shalt surely die and no man could live
[1:57:56] beyond the thousand-year day. So he got
[1:57:59] near to it and it was Methuselah who
[1:58:01] gave expression of that life. Methuselah
[1:58:05] gave the seed that brought for I'm
[1:58:07] sorry, Enoch brought forth the seed that
[1:58:09] brought forth Methuselah. And the year
[1:58:12] Methuselah died, the flood came.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God testifying that even
[1:58:18] that life that come out of him is not
[1:58:20] going into judgment.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; It's not going into judgment.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; We're giving testimony to two lives.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; If the Lord Jesus doesn't come and
[1:58:32] change these bodies by a transformation
[1:58:35] of changing the atoms and changing this
[1:58:37] body, we'll go to the dust of the earth.
[1:58:40] But we shall not come into judgment.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on him is passed.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; From judgment unto life.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; And the bride.
[1:58:53] Enoch was prophesying of the bride
[1:58:56] that would be changed and and and
[1:59:00] pleasing to God and would be caught up.
[1:59:04] And God, the scripture says, and God
[1:59:08] took him.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] a prophecy.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; He was laying down a prophecy with his
[1:59:16] life and it would lay sealed up. Oh my.
[1:59:20] I'd like to just get so he could almost
[1:59:22] shake everybody see it. Do you see it?
[1:59:24] Look into your eyes. Are you getting it?
[1:59:27] He was laying out a prophecy in his life
[1:59:29] and it laid sealed for all these
[1:59:32] centuries until the end time. No
[1:59:34] preacher, no theologian, no Bible
[1:59:37] school, nobody could ever uncover. And
[1:59:39] then comes a messenger and says, "This
[1:59:41] is you."
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; It's not like you. It's not just a type.
[1:59:47] This is you.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That was Christ in him in prophetic
[1:59:52] form. It's Christ in you in fulfillment
[1:59:55] form.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, you think I'm
[1:59:59] excited? How you want to see me on the
[2:00:02] streets of glory? I tell you, I'm going
[2:00:04] to sing and shout and dance about.
[2:00:06] Hallelujah. And the lamb will dry our
[2:00:09] tears.
[2:00:10] Oh, surely we have something we can be
[2:00:13] enthused about and rejoice over.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; You have to help me out. I'm not near
[2:00:25] over, but I'm going to close. Brother
[2:00:28] Lance is preaching tonight. Amen. I want
[2:00:31] to
[2:00:33] give him all the time and give you time
[2:00:35] to rest. Let him come on this evening
[2:00:38] and preach what God has laid on his
[2:00:40] heart. I've got great confidence in the
[2:00:42] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; And I'll just close with this because I
[2:00:49] I did make a small reference to it.
[2:00:57] Abraham
[2:00:59] and Sarah.
[2:01:01] Now, I said I'd like to have taken you a
[2:01:04] few moments ago. Now, I really would
[2:01:06] like to just shake you as I have I got
[2:01:08] your attention.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's so many. I'd love to talk
[2:01:18] about Rahab and Ruth and some of these,
[2:01:21] but I'm going to talk about Abraham and
[2:01:23] Sarah just as I come to a con
[2:01:25] conclusion. To me, it's so marvelous. No
[2:01:28] one ever before. I heard all kinds of
[2:01:31] preachers. I've heard hundreds. I've
[2:01:32] heard thousands of sermons. I never
[2:01:35] heard anybody.
[2:01:37] Just take from the scripture and it
[2:01:38] shows so clearly.
[2:01:40] Abraham and Sarah
[2:01:42] were made youthful again.
[2:01:45] Youthful be able to bring forth the son.
[2:01:48] The son was him.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; But there is another son, the same son
[2:01:58] that is to return. He says, "I won't
[2:02:01] leave you comfortless. I will come to
[2:02:03] you." Jesus said in John 14, I like to
[2:02:07] take these scriptures now. I like to
[2:02:09] take them in the context of the last
[2:02:10] four services.
[2:02:12] He said,
[2:02:14] we're in Luke 24. He said in last
[2:02:17] night's service.
[2:02:19] Last night he said in my father's house.
[2:02:24] Now just so it comes down real tight. I
[2:02:29] might overemphasize it but the same one
[2:02:33] almost 2,000 years ago.
[2:02:36] 2,000 years ago. This Jesus. Brother
[2:02:38] Brad said he's the same one 1954. I say
[2:02:41] he's the same one 2005.
[2:02:43] And 2,000 years ago, he said to his
[2:02:47] little group of disciples, "In my
[2:02:48] father's house are many mansions, if it
[2:02:52] were not so, I would have told you. I am
[2:02:56] going to prepare a place for you, and I
[2:02:58] will come again and receive you to
[2:03:01] myself."
[2:03:04] Not coming the next day or not coming
[2:03:06] just after the resurrection. I will come
[2:03:08] because he's looking on down the road to
[2:03:10] Luke 17:30.
[2:03:12] In the day when I, the son of man, will
[2:03:14] be revealed, I'll come again
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; and I'll receive you to myself. Not that
[2:03:20] I will come to yourself. I will come
[2:03:23] again to receive you to myself.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; I've come this time to be here and back
[2:03:29] over here. He's only got a few hours and
[2:03:31] his lips are going to be sealed and he's
[2:03:33] going to go to the cross
[2:03:36] and he's not going to speak anymore. And
[2:03:38] he's in he's actually in the Passover
[2:03:40] chamber right now. He's just saying his
[2:03:41] last words.
[2:03:45] I'm going to prepare a place,
[2:03:48] but then I will come again and I'll
[2:03:51] receive you to my place.
[2:03:54] And 2,000 years later, here comes one
[2:03:57] saying,
[2:04:00] "I'll prove that he's resurrected
[2:04:02] tonight.
[2:04:04] You're JW Reed
[2:04:06] and you come from a certain city and
[2:04:08] you're a minister and your wife is
[2:04:10] sitting out here in the audience and
[2:04:12] she's dying with cancer.
[2:04:16] Proving the identification that it's not
[2:04:20] another one. It's not a seventh grade
[2:04:22] hillbilly from Kentucky. He's proving
[2:04:25] he's the same identical person.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And the life that was there is now here.
[2:04:32] Amen.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; And now we have moved a little further
[2:04:37] in the message. We've moved a little
[2:04:39] further realizing it's coming on us. I
[2:04:41] feel like I feel like Cleopus. It's
[2:04:43] dawning on us.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; He's speaking about me.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; He's speaking about us.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] We've moved just a little further
[2:04:59] and we're the ones that have been
[2:05:02] walking
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; and reasoning and communing and not
[2:05:06] realizing who is with us.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; But he indeed
[2:05:14] must make it known to us.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:05:19] 2,000 years ago. And now
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; and now it's dawning on us. We are the
[2:05:25] fulfillment. They laid out that
[2:05:28] prophecy. And I'm I I'm I am coming to a
[2:05:30] close. And now here's here's Sarah. And
[2:05:34] here's Abraham. And they've been waiting
[2:05:36] for 25 years. They're not 2,000 years
[2:05:38] ago. They're maybe 4,000 years ago. And
[2:05:41] Abraham's body is dead. And Sarah's womb
[2:05:45] is dead. Milk veins all dried up. And
[2:05:49] one
[2:05:51] comes.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; One comes to him. One comes to him in
[2:05:59] the form of a man.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; But it was Elohim.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; And Abraham had the revelation, Lord.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; See three, but he says, Lord,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; my Lord, don't count on stop here. He
[2:06:17] had the same Oh, listen to me. The same
[2:06:21] character. He didn't have a whole lot to
[2:06:22] offer. He had the same character that
[2:06:25] the two men on the way to Emmas said
[2:06:27] when Jesus was going to pass by and go
[2:06:29] on by. Don't go. It's evening. Stop in
[2:06:32] and stay.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; And they and they communed with them.
[2:06:38] And 4,000 years ago, the same one,
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came walking across the sand
[2:06:46] in another body at another season to
[2:06:49] another man, the father of the faith.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I feel beside myself, friends.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; And God himself came down from the
[2:07:05] eternities. Are you listening? God
[2:07:08] himself came down from the eternities to
[2:07:12] lay down a prophecy
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; For you.
[2:07:23] You should look up and say, "Oh, Elohim,
[2:07:27] Almighty God, you mean you came down
[2:07:31] from the eternities
[2:07:34] and laid out a prophecy so that you
[2:07:36] would send a prophet in my time and
[2:07:38] reach back there and take that seed word
[2:07:41] and bring it forward and say to you,
[2:07:43] "Believe.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Believe." All you need to do is believe
[2:07:48] it
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; and you shall go into this ascension
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; and God himself laid out a prophecy.
[2:07:59] Then came a prophet in the end time and
[2:08:01] interpreted the prophecy
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; so you could believe the interpretation
[2:08:07] and receive what was intended.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Oh friends.
[2:08:13] Oh friends, I tell you, I'm ready to go.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to leave.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; these bodies shall be changed.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My precious brothers and
[2:08:31] sisters in Christ, my precious ones that
[2:08:33] we've walked together with, don't get
[2:08:35] too attached to this because it's
[2:08:38] passing away. And it's passing away very
[2:08:41] suddenly. But we have a kingdom that
[2:08:44] shall never pass away.
[2:08:46] [Applause]
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; And God has already sent the
[2:08:51] oh already sent the camels.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; I won't get into Rebecca.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; The messenger Eleazar
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; already came with the word to take you
[2:09:02] back.
[2:09:06] Eleazar brought the camels
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; to ride her back
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; right into the presence of her Isaac.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet messenger came with the
[2:09:17] word.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; The interpretation of the prophetic word
[2:09:22] that camel's a power a power. It's a
[2:09:24] beast. It's a power only a power. And
[2:09:27] the prophet came with the word that has
[2:09:30] the power
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; to take you back to Isaac.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Once again, he said, "I'll come and take
[2:09:38] you to my place."
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; The scriptur is perfect.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Isaac didn't come to her place. She went
[2:09:45] to his place.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; It just seems like revelation just
[2:09:50] coming. Oh, my brother, my sister, isn't
[2:09:53] it wonderful?
[2:09:56] Oh, how we thank him.
[2:09:58] Glory to God.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; This is a word in our season.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced of that. It's a word in
[2:10:05] our season.
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; It's for you where you are today.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; July the 31st, 2005. This word is for
[2:10:14] this congregation and all who may hear
[2:10:16] it today.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; This is where we're at.
[2:10:22] Amen.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; I just feel beside myself.
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; I just feel I caught away in heavenly
[2:10:31] places.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Don't know how to end a service. Don't
[2:10:34] know how to bring it to a close. Maybe
[2:10:36] we shouldn't bring it to a close. Maybe
[2:10:38] ought to just go on and go on.
[2:10:40] Hallelujah.
[2:10:42] Hallelujah.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just stand. Let's just worship
[2:10:46] him, shall we? I'd love for you just to
[2:10:48] take your liberty and and uh
[2:10:52] make love to him and thank him for this
[2:10:56] glorious thing that he's done.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, how marvelous, how wonderful
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; is my Savior's love to me.
[2:11:06] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; How marvelous, how marvelous.
[2:11:16] How glorious, oh God, is your works.
[2:11:19] To the children of men.
[2:11:23] Oh, how you knew them and you knew us.
[2:11:25] You know us. You know me.
[2:11:28] You know each one. You know each person.
[2:11:32] Blessed be your name.
[2:11:35] Blessed be your name. Could we sing? I
[2:11:38] will praise him. I will praise him.
[2:11:40] Praise the lamb for sinner's name. I
[2:11:45] will praise him. Oh, I
[2:11:50] will praise him.
[2:11:54] Praise
[2:11:55] [Music]

[2:12:01] [Music]

[2:12:08] him glory.
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:11] be
[2:12:15] for his blood has washed away
[2:12:21] each day. Let's lift it up to him once
[2:12:24] again. Oh, now I
[2:12:30] will praise him. Yes, I
[2:12:35] will praise him.
[2:12:38] Praise
[2:12:41] The lamb for sinners slain
[2:12:48] and
[2:12:51] glory
[2:12:53] all be
[2:12:58] for his blood has washed away.
[2:13:03] [Music]
[2:13:09] Hallelujah.
[2:13:11] Hallelujah. Praise God. I love
[2:13:14] worshiping.
[2:13:16] I love singing about him.
[2:13:19] Oh my.
[2:13:22] Glory.
[2:13:24] Do you want to hurry home or you want to
[2:13:26] just stay in his presence a little bit?
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[2:13:34] Jesus.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it once again, shall we?
[2:13:39] I
[2:13:42] will praise him.
[2:13:46] I
[2:13:48] will praise him.
[2:13:51] Praise
[2:13:54] the lamb for sinners.
[2:14:03] Give
[2:14:05] him glory
[2:14:07] all
[2:14:12] for his blood.
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:24] Hallelujah.
[2:14:29] Wonder if we can just sing

[2:20:31] [Music]
[2:20:33] for thou art
[2:20:38] [Music]
[2:20:47] me.
[2:20:55] Let's just close a word of prayer.
[2:21:02] Lord, our hearts are stirred.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; For we can truly say like those that
[2:21:07] were on the road to Emmas, our hearts do
[2:21:10] burn within us. Lord, there's a burning
[2:21:13] taking place. But not just a burning.
[2:21:16] There's a yearning, a yearning for more
[2:21:19] of you, Lord, to come to Father's house,
[2:21:22] to be like Rebecca of old, Lord, to come
[2:21:25] into the presence of Isaac. There's
[2:21:27] something moving, Lord. And father, if
[2:21:29] there's those here that haven't
[2:21:31] experienced that, I say move on their
[2:21:33] soul. Move on their soul, Lord, this
[2:21:36] morning. Let the word of God have that
[2:21:38] effect. Move us, Lord. We feel that
[2:21:41] we've heard the voice of God saying,
[2:21:43] "Come up higher." We feel it within our
[2:21:45] own hearts and our own lives. There's
[2:21:47] something taking place and we love you
[2:21:50] for it. We thank you for your servant,
[2:21:52] Lord. We pray, God, that you'll pour
[2:21:54] back the strength, Lord. It takes a lot,
[2:21:57] Lord, to unbburden a soul. But God, I
[2:22:00] pray, Lord, whatever's been poured out,
[2:22:01] you'll pour back abundantly upon his
[2:22:04] life. Father, Lord, we're just asking
[2:22:06] that you'll go with the saints
[2:22:08] individually. May they realize the
[2:22:10] presence of God has not departed, but
[2:22:13] Lord, it's even naive even in thy mouth
[2:22:16] as they will speak upon these things.
[2:22:18] And as they return, speak again through
[2:22:21] our dear brother Lance. Lord, love the
[2:22:23] gift, love the vessel. We pray God
[2:22:26] you'll anoint it and Father that you'll
[2:22:28] have your way within our lives. We pray
[2:22:30] bless your people. Bless them abundantly
[2:22:33] as they go their way now in Jesus name.
[2:22:38] Amen.
[2:22:40] God be with you saints. You're dismissed
[2:22:41] in Jesus name. Amen.
