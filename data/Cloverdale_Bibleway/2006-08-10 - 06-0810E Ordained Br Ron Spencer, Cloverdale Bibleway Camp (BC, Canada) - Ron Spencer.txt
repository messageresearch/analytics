And now, Father, we've come to this time. And Lord, one time you said, "The hour has come and now is glorify thy son." Lord, we're in that hour of perfection. We've come At this time, we're asking, Lord, that you will move in a very special way, Lord, not only upon the young people, but adults alike. We're looking for that hour, the capping of the headstone coming down, of people coming to the very image of God. Lord, that is the deep that is calling to the deep within our hearts and our souls. Tonight we say, "Oh great baptizer, would you come, Lord, and baptize your people once again and let the fire fall and let your glory be seen in this little tent, Lord, as we have consecrated it, we've dedicated to you, we're asking, Lord, for our young people, Lord, that you will move especially, Lord.

Good to see everyone else this evening. Those visiting with us join us. For those who sometimes can't even cross the border, Seattle area few of you here. It's good to have you. God bless you. We have uh a group of sisters who are going to come and sing for us a special thing to come and get ready at this time. Let's sing hallelujah all the time. Hallelu Hold your head up high. Hallelujah. Find It's hard to take to walk by. But you made me a pro. I do believe I will go. You have me. I will answer. Your plans for me are perfect. My heart is falling to take my hand and I follow the Hallelujah. I will have I will answer me. me. I will. You have me. I will leave. I will call me. I will take you. Leave me alone. I will Jason's already given you a warm welcome. You know you're welcome. We had a glorious time first part of this week. Junior camp last night. Having our brother Ryan Jones, his wife, Sister Channy, with us been a special treat. And I know that everyone that was here really did immensely enjoy it. We appreciate that. We want to be thankful that we can gather like we are this evening. We were really shocked and saddened a few days ago to hear that our brother Roy Shrew's church burned to the ground. And some of you may have heard that by now, but uh a brother from the church had been to the building just before about 30 minutes before the fire uh has started and turned on the air conditioning for the meeting that was going to take place, a prayer meeting that night. And about 30 minutes later, uh a lady came to his said the church is on fire and uh it burned very suddenly. They found some doors that were open. So they do not know what took place. They don't know exactly what the cause is. The only reason I'm giving these details is so that there isn't all kinds of stories going around that are not accurate. And uh the uh church, brother Shrewsbury has said burned right to the ground. They had another building uh next to it which was like a fellowship hall and that has been preserved. So uh they're having meeting there I believe tomorrow night and they were just getting ready for three week meeting with a brother that was coming up to preach for them and uh I believe they to continue and use the other building. They are setting it all up. So, I can say and ask this congregation that you would join us in your individual prayer time. This is not something you just pray over in a request time and then forget it. It's something I'd like you to have on your heart. Uh, Brother Shrewsbury is not a young man. His wife is not a young woman. and they have had this church established there for very many years. A nice congregation and for them I was in brother as soon as I got the news and the phone call came here. Brother Tom even while the church was on fire and they gathered some of the all the people that they could just around here on the campgrounds and began to pray for them pray over the situation. I was just a short time ago, probably five weeks ago, I was sitting in that office in that church and I looked around. Uh I just would be observing some of the uh not pictures but the poems and different things, gifts that had been given to brother Shrewsbury for his many many years of service to the Lord. And for me to realize that they were all in ashes now, it just brought a heaviness to my own heart. And those are things which are lost and can never be regained. So we are asking that you remember him in prayer. Will you do that? I'm sure this congregation will remember our faithful brother in prayer. And uh I've delivered a message that is going to him uh tomorrow that our church here will be praying for them. We're going to take up an offering tonight uh tonight, tomorrow night, and Saturday night because you may not have come prepared, but we're taking up offerings for the expenses of the of the camp uh while the those that are here as campers and they are they're paying their fee for their overnight stay and for the meals and so on. There are many many expenses that are not included in that and uh we need to take care of those. So if you will open your heart and just give according to as God has uh provided supplied you then we'll uh it will be sufficient and we are serve that. Uh also on Sunday uh because we're going to be having our Sunday service here at 10 a.m. we'll be the offering then for your tithes. At that time, I would like to just make mention while the deacons get ready to take the offering that if you deacons would please be just uh sensitive to the uh once the sun goes down and it gets sometimes it gets cool quite quickly and if there's a cool air cool draft moving in from the back we'd like to just I know you're very faithful to drop the uh aprons down, but we'd like to make sure that the people that are sitting at the back are not uncomfortable. So, we would just ask the deacons to be conscious of that. I wonder if the deacons would come forward, please. And those that are assisting to take the offering, like to ask blessing upon the offering and we want to also be remembering our brother Shrewsbury at this time in prayer. How many who have been here at the camp? How many How many were here last night? Let me see your hands raised. Oh, all right. How many were not here last night? All right. Uh, you want to be sure and get the DVD? That was special for you, Brother Gary. I told our brother Brian, we got a lot of wilderness people in this church and he'd be right at home. I think he felt right at home, too. How many enjoyed it last night? And now we're commencing towards the supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. Supernatural. We want to see the almighty hand of God. I don't know about you individually, but I for one person am saying I want to see in in certain areas that I am interested in and I am personally praying about I want to see the supernatural. I've already prayed here on the platform for two supernatural things to happen. And I believe if we you know what the scripture says, ask. &gt;&gt; And then what's the next part? &gt;&gt; Let me hear it. &gt;&gt; And you shall &gt;&gt; receive. Isn't that good news? &gt;&gt; Ask and you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're asking for the supernatural tonight. Gary, would you ask We do. Yes. Amen. 49 hearture. Jip set free. Oh glory glory glory hallelujah. Oh blessed be in holy the bra and the song and I was I helpless. The singing sheer me and you to my father. Oh, glory, glory, glory, hallelujah. Blessed is all for the great and the glory. I was great in the standing she found me and to my father. Oh glory, glory, glory hallelujah. Blessed be his holy name. He the great man the song of glory. I want to know tonight whether you put your order in. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, where are you? We're going to invite you to speak to us this evening. I don't know about you, but I know I know the church uh that I'm associated with or the people that I've been around with for 30 going on 31 years. I know that they're great eaters. &gt;&gt; It's true. Look at us. You know, you see different photos of us when we were 21 and 25 and now we're 40 and now we're 50. We're going on and there's just more territory. &gt;&gt; I know that if we were that in the natural, I know we're there in that in the spiritual. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't know about you, but I've I've been under so, you know, since the end of camp and brother Ron had had graciously accepted the invitation when brother Visll said, "Brother Ron, next year would you be our speaker?" From that moment on, &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to this night. &gt;&gt; From that moment on, &gt;&gt; and now I'm I'm saying that time has come and now is. &gt;&gt; We're here. &gt;&gt; We've got nothing better to do. &gt;&gt; We want God, don't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that the man of God has done his part. He's waited on God. Now, let's do our part. &gt;&gt; That is the pull on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we desire that the Holy Spirit would come and whatever your need is that he would come and meet you sovereignly and specially by the word of God. Welcome. Welcome, Holy Spirit. We welcome thee tonight. Let's sing that as we invite our dear brother Ron Spencer to come and minister the word of God to us this evening. How well we welcome thee. Come in this very hour. We will stand well. Every great I am power this very hour. Holy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It is certainly good to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon. &gt;&gt; I trust that you're under expectation for the Lord to do something incredible in this meeting. Yes, &gt;&gt; I know that we're living in incredible times &gt;&gt; and you were ordained &gt;&gt; to be at this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I certainly did appreciate brother Brian &gt;&gt; I told my wife last night, how in the world am I going to follow that? I certainly believe that we're living in the time God has allowed us to see a man that can communicate with nature &gt;&gt; as the world is growing. And so we're certainly glad that we can be here. Let us speak. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you all. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're under expectation that you would come. &gt;&gt; For if you don't come, it will be just and people that have gathered together. But even as we study this afternoon, we can feel the supernatural power of God. &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you would come and I know you have been invited. &gt;&gt; We have sung the songs of Zion to Pararts and we ask you that just now that you would just come and captivate this entire congregation. &gt;&gt; You know our every need. You know every situation tonight. &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you would anoint lips of clay. &gt;&gt; And may you drive back every demon and principality and foul &gt;&gt; that would try to hold us captive &gt;&gt; and set us free to ask him. &gt;&gt; For we know that we are built for this hour. &gt;&gt; We were predestinated for this planet &gt;&gt; and we have been chosen by you before the foundation of the world. And we ask you that you would anoint us for service. We pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And anoint this congregation as we put our fire together. Father, &gt;&gt; oh God, help us tonight. We pray. &gt;&gt; And may we sit in heavenly places in this first evening in the name of Jesus Christ we ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. If you will turn with me to Genesis 37 this afternoon, &gt;&gt; Genesis 37. And Jacob dwell in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. And the lad was with the sons of and with the sons of Zela. And the father's wives and Joseph brought under the father their report. Now, Israel loved Joseph more than all of his children because he was a son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colors. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peacefully unto him. Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren, and they hated him. the more. And he said unto them, "Here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed. And behold, we were binding sheav in the field, and lo, my sheep arose, and also upright, and behold, your sheav stood round about and made obesence to my sheep." And his brethren said unto him, "Shalt thou indeed reign over us, or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?" And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and his words. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; I believe this is the first evening for the senior. I believe sitting before me tonight is the pre-planned purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that when God was like a contractor unfolding the earth and he was laying out your seeds and you were in his mind, Brother Brandham said like laying out two befores of a of a housing project. He knew exactly who would be in what day and at what time. And he knew even your genetic makeup and your genetic code. He knew the weaknesses that he was going to allow you to have. He knew the situations that you were going to come in. He knew the valleys that you were going to have and the mountains that you were going to climb. And God orained you to live in this day. &gt;&gt; Joseph was a young man that was just like you. &gt;&gt; He was born in a message home. He was born as a son of prosperity. He literally did not have no choice of what God called him to be. &gt;&gt; You see, God placed even before his birth a special blessing upon his life. &gt;&gt; Just like every one of you sitting under the sound of our voices this evening, God gave you an opportunity to hear the gospel of eternal life &gt;&gt; and the greatest message that you that the world has ever heard. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A word that will change your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And transform you in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, &gt;&gt; maybe Joseph, as he be to grow a little older and as he be to notice how his father took special favor and special care of him, maybe he be to notice his brethren of of their little hatred and their jealousy and their envy. and and he began to notice as how they conducted themselves around him. And but you know this gift be to develop in his life and it be to be pulled out of him because GOD HAD PLACED INSIDE of him the potential. &gt;&gt; This was not going to be just another son but this is going to be a man that is going to transform history. He is going to be ordained of God to be the fulfillment of the word of the hour. And literally, as he has talked to Abraham through Melazdc, how that the children of Israel would sojourn in a strange land, there has to be a man ordained of God to turn THE CORNER &gt;&gt; AND CAUSE them to go to Egypt. &gt;&gt; And God has to have someone that is there in power and position. Now, a lot of times we don't understand maybe the pre-planning of God or even why that we're going through the processes that we're going through. But God has to develop us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has to He has to be perfect IN HIS TIMING. A LOT OF TIMES WE don't understand even the purpose of what we're even doing here THIS AFTERNOON. BUT GOD IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT process and he has the purpose of you and his mind before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Random makes a couple of statements and I'll go there. He says, HE SAID THE LAST PROPHET THAT THEY HAD AND DR. MOSES, HE SAID THE last prophet they had was Joseph. And Joseph was a man born in the world by God to do a certain things and to fulfill the word of God. Gifts and callings are without repentance. So, you s JUST SIMPLY CAN'T PUSH something into somebody that isn't there to push. A man can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph meeting his brethren, he said, NOTICE DOWN THROUGH THE ages when Jesus comes, never did he consult with any theologians, BUT HE CALLED A BUNCH OF VIPERS AND CALLED THEM A BUNCH OF VIPERS and snakes in the grass. Never did the the DISCIPLES EVER COPE WITH ANY OF THE DENOMINATIONS. They were on THE SIDE. THEY WERE ON THE SIDE. AND HE SAYS, NEVER DID JOSEPH EVER COPE with them. HE WAS HATED AND REJECTED FOR THE SAME PURPOSE THAT THE REST OF THEM WAS BECAUSE GOD WAS IN HIM IN A supernatural way and in a different way that he was in the rest of them and they hated him without a cause. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RHONDA, WE'RE SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD. WE WERE ORDAINED TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; WE ARE A SEPARATED PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD CALLED YOU A SUPER RACE. MAN DIDN'T CALL YOU THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE CALLED YOU A SUPER CHURCH. &gt;&gt; MAN DIDN'T CALL YOU THAT. GOD CALLED YOU THAT. &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGED ABRAHAM'S NAME. Abraham didn't change him. &gt;&gt; You can DO ALL THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO CHANGE YOURSELF and turn over NEW LEAVES. YOU CAN MAKE PROMISES. YOU CAN IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND I'M GOING TO BE A BETTER PERSON. YOU CAN JOIN EVERY SOCIAL CLUB IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN JOIN CHURCH AFTER CHURCH. BUT IF GOD YOUR LIFE, YOU'LL NEVER be the same. &gt;&gt; He said, "Joseph, when he was born, he was loved of his father, hated of his brethren, a perfect type of Christ. He was a blood brother TO THEM, THE SAME FATHER. But the reason they hated him without a cause is because God made him a prophet, &gt;&gt; a spiritual a seer and they hated him for that very purpose. BUT JOSEPH COULD NOT HELP IT BECAUSE GOD MADE HIM that way. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WATCH THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN JOSEPH. WATCH WHAT HE DID. HE HE even acted THE PART OF CHRIST. HE was hated of his brethren, loved of his father BECAUSE OF THE SPIRIT MADE HIM THE DIFFERENCE." He said he was a spiritual man. He saw visions. HE INTERPRETED DREAMS. HE DID NOT DO IT. FOR HIS OWN GLORY. HE DIDN'T. HE DID IT BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING in him. Let me JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. GOD PUT THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; You didn't put it there. &gt;&gt; YOU DID NOT. YOU HAD YOU LITERALLY YOU LITERALLY THERE'S PEOPLE THAT LIVE BESIDE OF YOU, THE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU MAY GO TO SCHOOL WITH, PEOPLE THAT YOU WORK WITH, AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE, BUT LITERALLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WAS CALLING TO YOU &gt;&gt; AND THEY MAY LITERALLY HATE YOU. THEY MAY LITERALLY TURN AGAINST YOU WITH EVERYTHING THAT IS WITHIN THEM AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY THEY DO IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOOD PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SCHOOL THAT CAN PRODUCE CHILDREN LIKE YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. BUT THERE YOU'RE HATED WITHOUT EVEN A CAUSE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A PILLAR OF FIRE FOLLOWS YOU AND LIVES INSIDE OF YOU AND he quickens you to life and Satan HATES IT WITH EVERYTHING THAT is within him. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Brandon was quoting a scripture. He said, you know, the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the Lord. He said that gives us ministers a chance sometimes to kind of catch our breath when we think we've made a wrong move. &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES GOD'S JUST MOVING WITH us and we think that we're wrong, but maybe it's God's moving. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says this. He said, "Your birth year was pre-planned." HE SAID, "I GUESS YOU BELIEVE THAT. Everyone you knows that our birth was pre-planned. Did you know that your being here never originated in just a myth OR A THOUGHT. EVERYTHING WAS PRE-PLANNED BY GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE world &gt;&gt; that you're here. &gt;&gt; THE INFINITE GOD KNOWED. AND TO BE INFINITE, HE HAD TO KNOW EVERY FLEA that would ever be upon the earth and how MANY TIMES IT WOULD BAT ITS EYE. HE SAID THAT'S INFINITE. YOU'RE HE SAYS he said YOU'RE OUR LITTLE MINDS CANNOT FATHOM WHAT INFINITE MEANS. THE INFINITE GOD, HE KNOWETH ALL THINGS. THEREFORE, THERE'S NOTHING OUT OF CATER. AND HE SAYS, "IF WE KNOW THE WORD OF GOD, WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE LIVING. WE KNOW THE HOUR THAT we're living in. We know what lays ahead. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORLD IS LITERALLY IN CHAOS RIGHT NOW. BUT WE KNOW WHAT LAYS AHEAD." &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Ron, I'VE HEARD THAT QUOTE A LOT OF TIMES. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. I WANT YOU TO PLACE THAT IN THE WOMB OF YOUR SOUL. BECAUSE EVERY TIME THE enemy comes to you and HE SAYS YOU'RE A BACKSLIDER, YOU'RE NOT A CHRISTIAN, YOU'RE LOOKING RIGHT SQUARE IN THE eyes and say, "I WANT TO REMIND YOU GOD FOLLOWED ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION. &gt;&gt; He pre-planned me. HE NEVER LOOKED AT MY FAILURES. HE NEVER LOOKED AT MY MISTAKES. He never looked at the situation that I had. He knew what I was about to do." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH FOUND HIMSELF. SO, &gt;&gt; and I'm I TRULY I'M TRULY CAN BELIEVE TONIGHT HE WAS A HUMAN BEING AS WELL. HE WAS HURT. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY NEIGHBORS AND BY FRIENDS AND EVEN PEOPLE THAT SIT ON THE PEW AND YOU GET HURT. &gt;&gt; YOU GET WOUNDED. &gt;&gt; BUT YET, HE WAS NOT FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT WERE AROUND HIM. HIS ANCHOR WAS IN GOD. &gt;&gt; HIS ANCHOR WAS IN THE SUPERNATURAL POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; He went found himself in qualifier's house. I want you to know I want you to know this. No matter where he was at, God was with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to just notice he was blessed. no matter where he was at. &gt;&gt; You have a covenant with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That everything that you put your hands on is blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And we operate within his covenant. &gt;&gt; Now, I want YOU TO JUST NOTICE HERE'S SOMETIMES WHERE THE ENEMY COMES IN. He comes in and he BEGINS TO SAY, "WELL, I'LL GET HIM TO WORK." And as he begins to work, IF HE'S NOT CAREFUL, HE BEGINS TO LOSE HIS FOCUS BECAUSE REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS TOUCHED IS BLESSED. &gt;&gt; And you may START OUT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE LADDER. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE COVENANT OF GOD THAT IS WITH YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU IMMEDIATELY START TO CLIMB AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU IMMEDIATELY START TO FLOW UP INSIDE OF A COMPANY AND YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND AND GOING, I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT I'M MOVING UP. I'M MOVING PAST OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE QUALIFIED THAN MYSELF. &gt;&gt; They're older than myself and they're MORE THEY'RE MORE STUDIOUS AND THEY'RE THIS AND THEY'RE THAT. THEY'VE GOT HIGHER QUALIFICATIONS. BUT SATAN CAN SEE THE LIGHT AND HE CAN SEE HE CAN SEE THE PLAN OF GOD THAT IS INSIDE OF YOU. AND SO HE BEGINS TO USE THAT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFER. AN OFFER THAT LITERALLY IN YOUR FLESH IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR YOU TO REFUSE. &gt;&gt; HE MADE JESUS AN OFFER. &gt;&gt; If you'll remember, HE OFFERED JESUS KINGDOMS WITHOUT A CROSS. &gt;&gt; HE'LL OFFER YOU A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. without a new &gt;&gt; birth. &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THE MESSAGE, HE'LL OFFER YOU AN INTELLECTUAL experience &gt;&gt; where you CAN QUOTE EVERY QUOTE AND DOT EVERY EYE AND CROSS EVERY CAVE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU WANT TO GET TO THAT NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; WHEREVER IT IS, whatever it takes, you cannot have a new birth. BROTHER, WHY DO I NEED IT? THE SCRIPTURE SAID THAT YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; BEING BORN IN A FAMILY DOESN'T MAKE YOU SAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I BELIEVE ALL THE MESSAGE. So does the devil. &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL WAS BAPTIZED WHEN JUDAS WAS BAPTIZED. THAT'S what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; But he CAN'T GET THE HOLY Ghost &gt;&gt; or he'd be our brother and not our enemy. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, HE WILL COME AND SIT IN PEACE RIGHT BESIDE YOU. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBOR JUST NOW, BUT HE'LL HE'LL TELL YOU. HE WILL TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE IN A STATE OF SATISFACTION. YOU DON'T NEED TO PRESS. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO PUSH. YOU DON'T NEED TO PULL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT IT MADE. YOU'RE SITTING IN A QUEUE. I WANT YOU TO KNOW JOSEPH, THE FIGHT WAS ON WHEN HE ARRIVED AT &gt;&gt; YES. HE WAS BLESSED. YES, HE RECEIVED A HIGH JOB, BUT THE ENEMY WAS CREEPING IN LIKE A CREEPING PARALYSIS. &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS PROBLEM AT? HE LOOKED AT ALL THE POSSIBILITIES. &gt;&gt; May maybe I'm out of place right here, but I want you to KNOW SATAN MANY TIMES WILL OFFER YOU JOBS THAT TAKES YOU OUT OF CHURCH. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; He will want to MOVE YOU TO TIMBUKTU. AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT'S AT, BUT HE WANT TO MOVE YOU TO TIMBUKTU. &gt;&gt; MAYBE WHEN YOU COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I want YOU TO KNOW GOD BELIEVES IN GOING TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; SCRIPTURE SAYS, "FORSAKE NOT THE ASSEMBLING OF YOURSELVES THE MORE YOU SEE THAT DAY APPROACHING." AND LISTEN, IF YOU HAVE GOT YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND, YOU NEED TO GET IT OUT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; I NEED EVERY SERVICE THAT I CAN GET MYSELF INTO. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, we need the strength. WE NEED THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; NEVER SETTLE FOR A SECONDHAND EXPERIENCE OR A LITTLE STORY OF THE BIBLE. AND ONCE YOU KNOW, MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THE GOD OF THIS WORLD. Joseph was incredibly moved. &gt;&gt; All of our's wife came to him and told him, I'm just moving through this. All of our's wife went came to him said, "You're in charge of this whole house. Come lie with me." Nobody would have known. But you know, &gt;&gt; but you know, &gt;&gt; many times, and I'm going to go here, and I'm going to only spend just a couple of moments. Many times, Satan will come to you in the privacy of your home. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking to young people now, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And cause you to compromise, if you're not careful, &gt;&gt; your standards &gt;&gt; because if you're in a private moment, and and and you know where I'm at because you know your situation. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to go to the wrong kind of pornographic sites. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to go to the wrong sites. Period. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's to just just TO SPEND YOUR TIME IN AN UNWISE WAY. &gt;&gt; Wrong kind of music. the wrong KIND OF THE WRONG KIND of an influence THAT COMES THROUGH. LISTEN, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO contaminate our soul. &gt;&gt; That's Paul is preaching that we need it. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID WE NEED A PENTECOSTAL REVIVAL IN OUR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; WE NEED A REAL REVIVAL OF SHAKING NOT TO BRING IT INTO MORE PEOPLE, BUT WHEN THE WIND HITS THE WATER AND IT WASHES THE TRASH OUT OF OUR LIVES. YOU SEE, THERE'S A PURPOSE. AND NOT ONLY IS JOSEPH, THERE'S A PURPOSE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; And Satan wants to thwart and derail THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE AT A YOUNG AGE. SO, AS YOU BEGIN TO GET OLDER, IT CAN BRING BACK THE CONDEMNATION OF WHAT YOU DID AS A CHILD. &gt;&gt; Parents sitting ALL OVER THIS BUILDING, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT JUST NOW. AND IT REMINDS YOU MAYBE A NIGHT MANY YEARS AGO &gt;&gt; THAT HE CONSTANTLY YES YOU'VE BEEN CLEANSED BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST BUT THROUGH THE MEMORY CHANNEL AND THE AFFECTION CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH GOD GAVE HIM THE ABILITY TO WORK THROUGH HE BRINGS BACK THE MEMORIES OF YESTER YEAR. BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S THEREFORE NOW NO condemnation &gt;&gt; to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Friend says this. When God speaks to a man, he has faith. He has ambition and he has purpose. &gt;&gt; And when God speaks TO A MAN, HE GIVES HIM A PURPOSE. WHEN GOD speaks to a man, HE GIVES HIM AMBITION. WHEN GOD speaks to a man, HE GIVES HIM FAITH TO DO IT, TO ACCOMPLISH OR TO ACHIEVE THE PURPOSE IN HIS LIFE AND WHAT GOD CALLED HIM TO DO. HE'S CALLED US TO BE OF THE CHURCH OF GOD. AMEN. You believe that? &gt;&gt; HE SAID GOD SETS A TIME AND HAS A PURPOSE for everything that he does. NOTHING HAPPENS ACCIDENTALLY TO THOSE WHO LOVE THE LORD, WHO ARE CALLED ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. WE ARE PREDESTINATED AND EVERYTHING WORKS JUST RIGHT FOR THAT. HE cannot lie. He said IT WAS SO. AND EVERYTHING HAS its time and its season &gt;&gt; AND IT HAS TO BE THAT WAY. GOD IS BEHIND EVERY MOVE. SOMETIMES YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING'S GOING WRONG AND IT'S ALL UP TO US. BUT THOSE THINGS ARE PUT ON US, TRIALS AND WANDERINGS, AND IT'S TESTING TO SEE HOW THAT WE REACT TO THAT kind of an action. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, GOD SOMETIMES TAKES THESE PEOPLE OUT LIKE THAT AND SHAVES THEIR WHEELS OFF, THEIR OWN WHEELS OFF. HE SHOWS THEM THAT THEY CAN'T DO JUST WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. GOD HELP US RIGHT THERE. Every one of us have to wrestle with our &gt;&gt; self-will. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK JOSEPH HAD TO WRESTLE WITH HIS? ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; When he's reaching a level HE'S HE'S OVER AN ENTIRE CAPTAIN'S HOUSEHOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT'S SURROUNDING IT LOOKED GOOD, BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A PHASE. IT'S ONLY FOR A SEASON. IT IS A TRAINING PART OF HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I seem like I'M DOING NOTHING. YOU'RE IN TRAINING JUST NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I I'M JUST GOING TO SCHOOL. YOU'RE IN TRAINING JUST NOW. &gt;&gt; EVERY SCHOOL PAPER THAT YOU'RE DOING, GOD IS TRAINING YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY JOB. MAYBE YOU WORK AT MCDONALD'S. GOD HELP YOU. MAYBE YOU WORK AT MCDONALD'S AND EVERY BURGER THAT YOU MAKE. OH, BROTHER RON, I'M IN A DEAD END JOB. THAT MAY BE YOUR THOUGHTS, BUT IN THAT SITUATION, THERE'S A PART OF WHAT GOD IS TRAINING YOU FOR A GREATER ARE YOU WITH me now? &gt;&gt; FOR A GREATER JOB. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S NOT FOR IT'S NOT JUST FOR THIS HUMANITY, BUT IT'S THE SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; There's just so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of a purpose in their life. &gt;&gt; Why didn't they do that? They lose their focus &gt;&gt; and it becomes such a distraction &gt;&gt; when everything Oh, brother Ron, listen. Satan desires to get you to work 12 and 15 hours a day and before long you're home, you're you're you're just you're you know, when you go home, you're literally a zombie. &gt;&gt; You come to church, you're literally a zombie. &gt;&gt; You know, if you're not careful, the world will literally try to consume you. It will literally try TO DEVOUR EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand, we must keep our focus in all things. &gt;&gt; WE MUST BE TOTALLY DISCIPLINED TO ALL OF THAT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? WE MUST BE TOTALLY DISCIPLINED TO THE WORD and make sure no matter what phase that GOD HAS ALLOWED US TO BE IN, WE MUST BE TOTALLY DISCIPLINED TO THAT WORD BECAUSE THE REMEMBER THE ENEMY IS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE US &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LAYING INSIDE OF YOU IS AN ETERNAL PREDESTINATED sin &gt;&gt; and HE ONLY HAS YOUR FLESH TO WORK THROUGH. So he will INTIMIDATE YOU AND TELL YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED. YOU'RE NOT BIG ENOUGH. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT HANDSOME ENOUGH. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T HAVE THE MILITARY TRAINING ENOUGH. LISTEN, HE DID THAT TO DAVID. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BYPASSED BY A PROPHET OF GOD. AND THAT PROPHET OF GOD WOULD HAVE CHOSE ALL OF HIS BROTHERS RATHER THAN HIM. &gt;&gt; You think that didn't wear on his mind? &gt;&gt; EVEN THE PROPHET COULDN'T PICK ME OUT. REMEMBER, WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS HERE. &gt;&gt; REACH OVER, TAKE RIGHT HAND, PUNCH. CAN'T PINCH. I'M NOT GOING TO DO THIS TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; But remember, WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE FEELINGS. &gt;&gt; WE TABERNACLE. WE'RE THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT LITERALLY, Satan will WEAR ON OUR FEELINGS. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But the only thing THAT HE HAS TO WORK WITH IS TO TRY TO WEAR ON OUR FEELINGS AND REMIND US AND INTIMIDATE US &gt;&gt; AND TRY TO PULL THE CONFIDENCE AWAY FROM US. &gt;&gt; Jesse sent David to the battle. When he got to the battle, what did they do? They disained him. &gt;&gt; He was going through the some of the same things that Job went through and Joseph went through. And even Ezekiel and Jeremiah went through it. Listen, and you go through it. &gt;&gt; HE GOES TO THE BATTLE AND HIS BROTHERS WHO ARE HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE HIM. BROTHER SAID HE WAS A POOR EXCUSE ON THE THRILL FOR A SOLDIER &gt;&gt; AND HE WAS THERE AND EVEN HIS BROTHERS SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO TAKING CARE OF PAPA?" &gt;&gt; But he had a testimony. THE MAIN THING IS YOU HAVE A TESTIMONY NO MATTER WHAT OBSTACLE COMES UP YOUR WAY. &gt;&gt; AND HE BEGIN TO HEAR GOLIATH SCREAM. AND WHEN GOLIATH SCREAMED, HE WAS CURSING THE GOD OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; LISTEN. GOLIATH WAS IN GOOD SHAPE UNTIL DAVID SHOWED UP. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? WHY, BROTHER ONE? HE KNEW THE GOD OF JEHOVAH. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THAT God very personally. IT MAKES AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU KNOW THAT God &gt;&gt; and it's MORE THAN A QUOTE. IT'S MORE THAN A PICTURE ON YOUR WALL, BUT IT'S A LIVING REALITY. &gt;&gt; It isn't daddy's experience and your mama's experience in YOUR PREACHER'S EXPERIENCE, BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; I was in the field, HE TELLS SAUL. I WAS IN THE FIELD and God gave me a bear and God GAVE ME A LION. He had a testimony. BROTHER, WHY DID HE GO BACK AND TELL THAT TESTIMONY AGAIN? LISTEN, HE NEEDED TO BUILD THE FAITH INSIDE OF HIS HEART AND REMIND THE ENEMY, GOD DID THAT FOR ME. HOW MANY TIMES does brother IN A PRAYER LINE GO BACK AND TELL STORY AFTER STORY AFTER STORY IS TO REMIND THE ENEMY OF WHAT GOD HAS already he &gt;&gt; you he may look at YOU AND SAY YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST you're you're not you know you FAIL AND YOU FALL LISTEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU REMIND HIM &gt;&gt; LISTEN LAST YEAR &gt;&gt; accountmen amen THE ANCHOR SETTLED INSIDE MY HEART &gt;&gt; AND GOD CAME TO me and he spoke to me. THE ANCHOR WAS TIED DOWN AND REGARDLESS OF HOW THE WIND FAILS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW GOD LIVES INSIDE of &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; Those testimonies build the faith inside of your life. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Scripture says all the all that live godly in Christ shall bear persecution &gt;&gt; the reproach of the word. &gt;&gt; He said you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see. Every man that comes up to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained for him you for. And remember, if you could just keep quiet, remember he's if he's called you for this, there's nothing to keep it from happening. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DEVILS AND TORMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT GOD'S WORD WILL be made manifest. YOU ARE BORN FOR A PURPOSE AND NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He said, "YOU MIGHT HAVE IMPERSONATORS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, but there'll never they will never they will never take your place." &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER RON, I'M AFRAID SOMEBODY'S GOING TO TAKE MY PLACE OR SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET WHAT I'VE GOT." NOBODY'S GOING TO GO WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH to get where you're at &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD HAS SINGLY DEVELOPED YOU WITH THE TRIALS OF YOUR LIFE AND THE TEMPTATIONS OF YOUR LIFE and the PROBLEMS OF YOUR OWN NATURE TO DEVELOP YOU HOW HE WANTS YOU TO BE. &gt;&gt; BOY, IF I WAS TALLER, LISTEN, IF I WAS IF I WAS MORE HANDSOME OR IF I WAS BUILT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY, I COULD BE A BETTER CHRISTIAN. GOD KNEW BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD BE. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE ENEMY INTIMIDATE YOU &gt;&gt; TRYING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; You can catch that. DON'T LET HIM INTIMIDATE YOU TRYING TO BE SOMEBODY ELSE. GOD WANTS YOU &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE YOU ARE. said this. He said, "God promised tonight when you come up out of the world, you separate yourself from all your earthly associates and all the old parties that you used to go to, the worldly amusements and drinking and smoking and gambling and all those things are separating and you're walking among a strange people that you haven't known before that say amen." spiritfilled, believing in all things, hoping in all things, waiting for the coming of the Lord, professing to be pilgrims and strangers and nothing that this world they don't desire. THEY'RE JUST FALLING AWAY from the things of the world. You see what I mean? You say, "Oh, brother Juan, BUT I'M AFRAID I'M AFRAID MY FRIENDS, I'M AFRAID I'll have to lose my friends." I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, IF YOU GET CHRIST, YOUR WORLDLY FRIENDS WILL LEAVE YOU. If they're influencing ME THE WRONG WAY, I DON'T WANT NOTHING to do with them to start off with. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT HE SAYS. BELOVED, NOW ARE WE THE SONS OF GOD, AND IT DOES NOT YET APPEAR WHAT WE SHALL BE, BUT WE KNOW WHEN WE SHALL WHEN HE SHALL APPEAR, WE SHALL BE LIKE HIM. BROTHER SAID, "WE ARE INVITED TO SHAPE OUR CHARACTER TO HIS CHARACTER." &gt;&gt; FOR WE SHALL SEE HIM AS HE IS, AND EVERY MAN HATH THIS HOPE IN HIM AS PURIFY HIMSELF, EVEN AS HE IS PURE. NOTICE THIS SCRIPTURE. 1 Corinthians 15. AND WE WERE BORN IN THE IMAGE OF THE EARTHLY, AND WE SHALL ALSO BEAR THE IMAGE OF THE HEAVENLY. NOW THIS I SAY, BRETHREN, THAT FLESH AND BLOOD CANNOT INHERIT THE KINGDOM OF GOD, NEITHER DO CORRUPTION INHERIT CORRUPT INCORRUPTION. BEHOLD, I SHOW YOU A MYSTERY. WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED IN THE MOMENT, in the twinkle of an eye, at the last trump. FOR THE TRUMPET SHALL SOUND, AND THE DEAD SHALL BE RAISED INCORRUPTIBLE, AND WE SHALL BE CHANGED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; For this CORRUPTION MUST PUT ON INCORRUPTION, AND THIS MORTAL IMMORTALITY. AND WHEN THIS CORRUPTIBLE SHALL HAVE PUT ON INCORRUPTION, AND THIS MORTAL HOUSE HAVE PUT ON IMMORTALITY, THEN SHALL BE BROUGHT TO PASS THE SAYING THAT IS WRITTEN, DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP IN VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 3 says, "Brethren, be followers together of me. Mark them which also walk you have an example for many walk of whom I told YOU OFTEN AND NOW TELL YOU even weeping that there are enemies of the CROSS OF CHRIST WHOSE END IS DESTRUCTION WHOSE GOD IS THEIR BELLY WHOSE GLORY IS THEIR SHAME WHOSE MIND WHOSE MIND EARTHLY THINGS FOR OUR CONVERSATION IS IN HEAVEN &gt;&gt; FROM WHENCE ALSO WE LOOK FOR THE SAVIOR OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHO SHALL CHANGE OUR VILE BODY THAT IT MAY BE FASHIONED AFTER HIS OWN GLORIOUS BODY ACCORDING TO THE WORKING WORD OF LIFE. HE IS ABLE TO EVEN SUBDUE ALL THINGS UNTO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; Notice the scripture. FOR HE THAT HATH BEGUN A GOOD WORK IN YOU. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD LIKES PROJECTS. &gt;&gt; And I want you TO UNDERSTAND, HE WON'T QUIT. &gt;&gt; HE WON'T QUIT. HE'S NOT THE KIND OF BUSINESSMAN THAT JUST TAKES ON A JOB AND HE LEAVES THAT JOB AFTER A LITTLE WHILE. HE WON'T QUIT. LISTEN, WHEN JOSEPH WAS IN A DUNGEON, GOD WASN'T FINISHED. &gt;&gt; JOSEPH WAS STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THERE. HE EVEN PROSPERED IN JAIL. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, IF YOU'RE A PREDESTINATED STATE, HE'LL PROSPER YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'LL WATCH OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; I'm in the valley of the SHADOW OF DEATH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE HE WANTS YOU TO BE. HE WANTS YOU TO BE RIGHT THERE AT THAT VERY MOMENT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A TESTIMONY ON THE EARTH &gt;&gt; OF THE GREATEST THAT HAS EVER BEEN ON THE FACE of the earth. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, ENDURE THAT TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for getting excited. This excites me. &gt;&gt; It so excites me tonight TO KNOW THAT I AM STANDING AMONG people that are of eternal value. YOU'RE LIKE FLY BY NIGHT PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT THINK THEY'RE WORTH SOMETHING. THEY STICK THEIR NOSES IN THE AIR. &gt;&gt; THEY CALL THEMSELVES WEALTHY. I'LL TELL YOU THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE WORLD EXCEPT for me. &gt;&gt; I don't have a DOLLAR TO MY NAME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWES. YOU OWN IT. BROTHER, I'm so consumed with everything around me. I want you to understand Joseph. He looked at walls. He looked at bars. &gt;&gt; He looked at guards every day. &gt;&gt; Laid in the back of his mind was a vision. &gt;&gt; In the back of his mind, HIS BRETHREN WERE GOING TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM. And he kept THAT VISION IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND &gt;&gt; AND HE KEPT WORKING TOWARD THAT VISION. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU SAY, "BROTHER, I HAVEN'T SEEN A VISION." GOD SHOWED YOU A VISION. &gt;&gt; He took A PROPHET OF GOD. HE SHOWED YOU YOUR FUTURE. &gt;&gt; HE NOT ONLY SHOWED YOU YOUR FUTURE, HE SHOWED THE DEVIL HIS FUTURE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE. YOU'RE GOING TO ENJOY ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO HOLLYWOOD STARS, &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO KINGS OF THE EARTH, &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO SPORTS STARS, &gt;&gt; when there's no AMBASSADORS OF THE WORLD, YOU'RE GOING TO STAND THERE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU SERVE THE purpose of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, you're standing HERE AS A PROJECTION OF GOD'S MIND. &gt;&gt; MICHELANGELO WORKED ON THAT STATUE 44 YEARS. THERE WAS A LOT OF REMOVING OF THE EXCESS. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I go to CHURCH AND THE PREACHER HITS ME. SOMEBODY MUST HAVE CALLED, "NO, IT'S JUST A REMOVING OF THE EXCESS." &gt;&gt; HE'S JUST WORKING ON YOU. YOU'RE A PROJECT AND IT'S rocking and it's trailing and it's fading and it becomes personal when it comes to your household. YOU SEE, IT'S GOD THAT'S IN THE PROJECT. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PROJECT MANAGER. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I PLAY PAUL WITH I PLAY I PLAY VOLLEYBALL WITH WITH WITH BROTHER TOM. HE'S OUR BROTHER. HE'S JUST A GUY THAT'S AROUND, YOU KNOW. BROTHER VISTOL, YOU KNOW, I'VE KNOWN THEM FOR YEARS. LISTEN, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU BECOME SO FAMILIAR. BUT THEY'RE GOD'S AGENTS ON THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM'S WICK WAS DIPPED INSIDE OF THAT, SIR, &gt;&gt; ALONG COMES A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY AND DIPPED IN THAT same &gt;&gt; and IT TAKES THE MYSTERY. ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? IT takes the mystery of that WORD AND THEY'RE ANOINTED TO PREACH THAT WORD TO YOU TO DEVELOP YOU to express the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN PAUL'S DAY OR PETER'S DAY OR JOHN'S DAY. YOU'RE LIVING IN PRIDE. &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the When the Holy Spirit begins to beat on us with the gospel hymn &gt;&gt; until all things of the world is beaten out &gt;&gt; and we reflect the image &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus then I believe we become Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For the word Christian means to be Christlike. That doesn't mean that we have to grow a long beard AND AS AN ARTIST PAINT pictures him having AND NEITHER DOES IT mean that we grow long hair as the artist pictures him having or the robe that he wore. For we're living in another DAY. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO reflect the physical image, but we must IN OUR SOULS REFLECT THE HOLY SPIRIT and his manner of life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You believe that tonight? man makes a statement so love it. HE SAYS, "GIVE ME A PREACHER. GIVE ME A CHRISTIAN. GIVE ME A HOUSEWIFE THAT'S A CHRISTIAN." &gt;&gt; Give me a farmer. GIVE ME A FACTORY WORKER THAT'LL PUT GOD FIRST IN EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I've got God first in my life. IN EVERYTHING, YOUR FRUITS WILL PROVE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT. &gt;&gt; COME SUNDAY MORNING, IT'LL PROVE WHETHER YOU DO OR NOT. COME WEDNESDAY NIGHT, it'll prove whether you do OR NOT. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS FIRST PLACE. HE DON'T WANT SECOND PLACE. HE DON'T WANT THIRD PLACE. IT'S WHERE YOUR ENERGIES ARE SPENT at &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll show you a man." This goes back to the covenant. I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him. &gt;&gt; He seeks God first. He said the word has always bore a reproach. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't get bored with these quotes. &gt;&gt; He said all through the ages God anointed his word has been a reproach. But that's the reason it's so hard for people who doesn't understand how to accept that reproach. Can you remember the disciples returning back and rejoicing because they figured out THAT THEY WERE COUNTED WORTHY to stand as a reproach now. But all that live godly IN CHRIST SHALL BEAR PERSECUTION. &gt;&gt; LADY JOSEPH WONDERED IN HIMSELF, "WHY AM I HERE? &gt;&gt; WHY AM I IN A DUNGEON?" HE WAS EXACTLY WHERE GOD WANTED HIM TO BE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER ROD, WHY IN THE WORLD AM I GOING THROUGH THIS? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE EXACTLY WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE. HE says you always have to stand this reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to Christ &gt;&gt; must be child trained &gt;&gt; for THE PURPOSE OF GOD HAS ORDAINED FOR YOU. And remember, if you COULD JUST KEEP QUIET, REMEMBER IF HE'S CALLED YOU TO THIS, THERE'S NOTHING. &gt;&gt; There's nothing &gt;&gt; that keep it from happening. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I FEEL SO BLOCKED. LISTEN, IF GOD HAS ORDAINED YOU &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS CALLED YOU, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT THE DEVIL CAN DO, &gt;&gt; can hold a &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Notice what he says, and you forgive me. I just I just want to lay this down. He said, "HEAVENS AND EARTH IS MET. GOD AND MAN IS RECONCILED. A restored Eden has ALREADY BEGUN. ALL THE CURSE IS GONE. JUST LIKE THE CURSE OF SIN. WHEN THE HOLY GHOST ACCEPTS YOU, HE SAYS YOU DON'T ACCEPT IT. IT ACCEPTS YOU BECAUSE IT'S GOD'S ATTRIBUTE. AND IF IT'S THE HOLY GHOST, IT MEANS GOD'S SPIRIT. IT'S ATTRIBUTE. THE THOUGHT OF GOD HAS ACCEPTED YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE ORDAINED FOR THAT PURPOSE. And yet you WERE BORN IN SIN. BUT GOD HAD THAT ATTRIBUTE. AND HERE YOU'RE EXPRESSED YOURSELF ON THE EARTH. AND HE COMES DOWN AND HE GETS YOU. AND YOU'RE BACK HERE. AND HE'S and he hears WHERE YOU BELONG. SIN LOST ALL OF ITS POWER. THE DESIRE OF SIN HAS GONE FROM YOUR HEART WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES IN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU'RE A RESTORED PERSON &gt;&gt; AND when the earth is restored at by THE SAME TIME HE SAID THERE CAN BE NO MORE CURSING, NO MORE STORMS, NO MORE WINDS, NO MORE TYPHOONS, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE RECONCILED. God and man has met. &gt;&gt; Where did that take place? IT HAPPENS RIGHT HERE. MOVING. &gt;&gt; He says this. He said, "We want to draw this first into our mind that there is not one thing that can destroy us &gt;&gt; until the purpose for he &gt;&gt; who created us has been fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, why did THIS ACCIDENT HAPPEN? WHY DID THAT situation happen? LISTEN, THE DEVIL CAN'T TOUCH A HAIR OF your head &gt;&gt; until he goes AND GETS PERMISSION FROM PAPA. WHERE YOU FEEL AT SATAN? OH, I'VE BEEN GOING TO AND FRO IN THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; WHERE AT? I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH CLOVERDALE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I'm down in plain THIS WEEK. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? I'M TRYING TO DESTROY YOUTH CAMP. &gt;&gt; NOT A CHANCE. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to rock their worlds. &gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO CAUSE THEM TO MAYBE GET DISTRACTED FROM THE NO SIR. No sir. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Ram said before HE CAN SICK THE ENEMY ENEMY ON YOU, he has first had fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What has he done, Brother Ron? HE'S WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN THE CAR WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'S BEEN IN YOUR BEDROOM. &gt;&gt; HE'S WATCHED YOU ON YOUR KNEES PRAYING. &gt;&gt; HE'S WATCHED YOU IN THE SACRED MOMENTS WORSHIPING THE LORD. AND NOBODY WAS INTERFERING. YOU WERE JUST IN A SHINE OF GLORY WITH THEM THAT INTERVAL. AND HE WAS HAVING FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. BUT THERE'S A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING. BUT SOMETIMES HE COMES TO YOU PERSONALLY. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; And before that, he can sick THE ENEMY ON YOU. HE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE IN YOU &gt;&gt; that when you go through the trial &gt;&gt; when you go THROUGH THE TRIAL, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THAT. &gt;&gt; He's got confidence. &gt;&gt; Many times we WANT TO TESTIFY WHAT GOD DID FOR US AND I'M TRUSTING GOD. I'M THANKING GOD. BUT LISTEN, WHEN THE DE WHEN GOD WANTS TO TESTIFY, HE CALLS HIS ENEMY UP AND SAYS, "COME HERE. I WANT TO HAVE A TESTIMONY SERVICE. &gt;&gt; He don't CALL THE ANGELS TOGETHER. HE SAYS, "COME HERE, SATAN. I WANT TO HAVE A TESTIMONY SERVICE." &gt;&gt; Have you CONSIDERED EDIS? &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU considered Tom Ray? &gt;&gt; Have you considered Ron Spencer? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I consider them, BUT THERE'S A PILLAR OF FIRE ALL AROUND THEM. THERE'S ANGELS in amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A MESSAGE, THIS ALL-ENCOMPASSING MESSAGE. LISTEN, THEY they can believe THAT THEY'RE A SUPER RACE, A SUPER CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE BONE AND THESE BONES ARE LIFE OF HIS LIFE. THEY BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL THEIR HEART, &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU CONSIDERED THEM? OH, YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THEM. And then comes your testing and you feel like an orphan child &gt;&gt; and Satan whispers into your ear &gt;&gt; that God don't love you. And you know right there he just crossed the line. &gt;&gt; Cuz he loved you when you were yet A SINNER. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; For God so loved the world that HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH. &gt;&gt; LET'S HAVE eternal life in the house. IF NOBODY ELSE LOVES YOU IN THE WORLD, BROTHER, I'VE NEVER HEARD I LOVE YOU FROM NOBODY IN THE WORLD. GOD SENT YOU A LOT. &gt;&gt; HE SENT you a lot, I love you. &gt;&gt; On my purpose, my purpose is kind of like just I just don't know. All I do is come to church and clap my hands. That's a victory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's incredible victory. &gt;&gt; All I do is I just come and I sit and I worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's incredible. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're one in a million people. &gt;&gt; THERE'S PEOPLE AROUND YOU THAT HAVE absolutely no desire. THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DESIRE TO EVEN SPEND 10 MINUTES in this tent. &gt;&gt; Now, IN THE REGION OF HELL, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE TONIGHT &gt;&gt; CUZ THEY MIGHT PASS THEIR OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; BUT LISTEN, YOU PASS PEOPLE ON THE STREET THAT WOULDN'T GIVE $10 TO SIT IN THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; They don't care. THEY HAVE NO DESIRE. BUT GOD PLACED THE DESIRE DOWN inside of you. &gt;&gt; God put that thing. &gt;&gt; And God KNOWS WHERE HE PUT IT. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL GO OUT OF HIS WAY &gt;&gt; TO GO GET YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER ON OUR RUN. JUST GO AHEAD. &gt;&gt; HE CAN FOLLOW YOU TO THE EDGE OF THE EARTH. HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND HIS WAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I say this from personal experience. I ran. I grew up in the message. I was brother's funeral. I grew up in the message. I heard I heard brother's voice every day. I didn't hear I didn't hear television. I heard brother every day. There came a time that I ran I ran from the Lord. &gt;&gt; But in his loving care and grace, he knows how to follow you. &gt;&gt; And he tries to bury. You say, "Brother Ron, I'm running even sitting in this building tonight." He knows how to follow you. and he don't mind allowing you to grow old. &gt;&gt; He's not in a great big hurry. &gt;&gt; You're the one that's aging. &gt;&gt; You're the one THAT'S GETTING GREAT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GETTING STOOPED SHOULDERS. &gt;&gt; WHY NOT SPEND THAT ENERGY FOR JESUS CHRIST? YOU SEE, GOD IS eternal &gt;&gt; and he KNOWS HOW TO FOLLOW YOU. GO TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. GO TO ALASKA. GO WHEREVER. HE KNOWS HOW TO SEND A PREACHER RIGHT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HOW TO SEND A WORSE WOMAN TO YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'LL CLEAN OUT A STABLE. &gt;&gt; HIRE A PREACHER. AND MAYBE ONE BOY GETS SAVED IN THAT ENTIRE MEETING. THAT'LL LEAD 500 500,000 SOULS TO JESUS CHRIST. GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT. &gt;&gt; Joseph was down there &gt;&gt; with a butler and a baker. Weren't exactly credible human beings, but they were spiritual enough to have a dream. They were quarreling amongst him. And so he just simply expressed the message of the hour to them. Even in a jail, he expressed the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; He expressed the life. &gt;&gt; There was something about him. NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS, HE GLOWED. &gt;&gt; The presence of God just glowed in his life. &gt;&gt; It was JUST LIKE A SHAKINA GLORY. NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS AT, you can you CAN SELL HIS COAT. YOU CAN THROW HIM IN A HE THROW HIM IN A DUNGEON. NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS AT, GOD WAS THERE. &gt;&gt; And he SPENDS ALL OF THIS TIME AND HE WAS IT WAS IN THAT CONDITION. And listen, IT LOOKED HORRIBLE for him. BUT NO MATTER WHERE HE WAS AT, HE SIMPLY WAS FULFILLING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, HE WAS ON HIS WAY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HE KEPT GOD'S VISION IN HIS MIND. LISTEN, HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW IT WAS ALL GOING TO COME TOGETHER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE REMEMBER, IF GOD IS THE ONE THAT'S PROVIDED THE VISION, &gt;&gt; he's more THAN ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RON, HOW'S THIS ALL GOING TO WIND UP WITH ISRAEL AND THE HASPEL? &gt;&gt; I was talking to a man the other day that just came to our church and he was a denominational man and he said, uh, I asked him, I said, You ever read much about the image of the beast? He said, "Oh yeah." He said, "My former pastor taught me that the Hezbollah is the image of the beast." I just I just kind of amused and I thought, you know, thank God for truth. &gt;&gt; Thank God for truth. &gt;&gt; When I begin to just spend maybe 10 minutes with him, his eyes begin to open up. That's how it all works. You see, you see here we're sitting tonight and the whole world is shaking. &gt;&gt; They're in a turmoil. How is this going to happen? An analyst are saying this and saying this and saying this and you're in the ark of safety. &gt;&gt; You don't need to build a bomb shelter. &gt;&gt; You've already had an INOCULATION OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; You're under a token &gt;&gt; that IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPLIED TO YOU. IT'S ALREADY BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. &gt;&gt; YES, WE MAY FEEL PRESSURE. YES, WE MAY HAVE FEEL SOME SQUEEZE, BUT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED THE GRACE &gt;&gt; TO HELP US MAKE IT THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT JOSEPH KEPT HIS MIND ON. YES, THIS IS PRESSURE. YES, THIS IS DARKNESS. YES, THIS IS PERSECUTION. THIS ISN'T WHAT I LIKE. BUT HE KEPT HIS MIND ON THE FOCUS OF THAT VISION. And one DAY HE WAS INVITED TO THE KING'S CHAMBER AND HE SHAVED AND HE CLEANED HIMSELF UP. &gt;&gt; AND HE STEPPED BEFORE THE KING EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS ORDAINED TO STAND. &gt;&gt; EXACTLY WHERE HE WAS CALLED TO STAND. IT HAD BEEN A LONG ROAD. &gt;&gt; It been a long ROAD COMING UP TO THIS POINT. HE HAD A LOT OF TESTIMONIES GETTING TO THIS SPOT, BUT HE was standing EXACTLY &gt;&gt; EXACTLY where God or you stand. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been a LONG TIME IN THIS ROAD, BUT YOU'RE STANDING EXACTLY WHERE GOD HAS ORDAINED YOU TO STAND. &gt;&gt; Remember what God has ordained or what God has imagined in his heart. He's going to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; How many were born after 1977? Raise your hands up high. After 1977, some of you trying to figure out when you were born. I could speak in Zul. You were born in total darkness. &gt;&gt; The wickedest world there's ever been. &gt;&gt; Even a prophet could see over into it. You were ordained. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You were called before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Just take just a moment here. Listen, when God in his infinite mind was looking over who all was going to be on the earth, &gt;&gt; he chose you &gt;&gt; to be one of the men to fulfill the purpose of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose you. Oh, brother Ron, nobody even knows my name. Don't matter. He knows your name. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm insignificant. I I'm a nobody. LISTEN, WITH GOD, YOU ARE SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; You are somebody. AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOUR PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE TO THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; You're his worst nightmare. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER, BUT THE DEVIL TORMENTS ME SO BAD. YOU'VE GOT IT WRONG. YOU'RE TORMENTING THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; Your life is tormenting the enemy. &gt;&gt; Your victory is tormenting the enemy. And just AS MUCH AS ISRAEL HAS PUT IT IN THEIR GOD HAS PUT IT IN THEIR HEART, DRIVE BACK THEIR ENEMIES. I'm not giving up. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; He's put something IN YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; I will not accept compromise. &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT STEP BACK. I WILL NOT TURN AROUND. &gt;&gt; I will be a liar. I am really power. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I am his victory. &gt;&gt; I am the vic. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; WHO BROTHER RON? YOU &gt;&gt; I AM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER. I I DON'T DO MUCH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STANDING HERE TONIGHT, YOU'RE SITTING HERE TONIGHT, YOU ARE A VICTORY. BROTHER Brown was preaching Garnet Pete's funeral. He makes this quotation. He said, "I am so happy as far as I know within the reach of my understandings by the word of God, by the witness of his holy spirit." This boy met that condition. He was born of the spirit of God, a changed man. The spirit of God was upon this little fell. He was a staunched Christian. &gt;&gt; He served God's purpose. &gt;&gt; What if he would HAVE WOULD HAVE DIED BEFORE THIS TIME? POLIO DROVE HIM TO GOD. &gt;&gt; He was TO BE A TOBACCO AUCTIONEER. THAT'S WHAT HE HAD IN HIS MIND. &gt;&gt; THAT WASN'T HIS PURPOSE AT ALL. HE KNEW THAT HIS PURPOSE WAS TO BE A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; NOW A TOBACCO AUCTIONEER, SOMEBODY SAID MAYBE 75 YEARS FROM TODAY IF THE WORLD SHOULD STAND THAT LONG, GARNET WAS A GREAT AUCTIONEER. MAYBE THAT'S ALL A MINISTER COULD HAVE SAID AT HIS FUNERAL. HE WAS A GREAT AUCTIONEER. BUT WHAT CAN WE SAY TODAY? HE'S A CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; AS AN AUCTIONEER WITHOUT THE GERM OF LIFE, JUST A MEMORY OF A GENERATION, HE'S GONE from among a few men. BUT NOW HE'S AMONGST IMMORTALS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You just have a little sister THAT PASSED BEYOND THIS ROUND. SHE SERVED GOD'S PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; SHE'S STANDING amongst immortals. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. She's waiting on you. &gt;&gt; She served the purpose. &gt;&gt; Oh, WAS A DEFEAT. NO, WAS A VICTORY. &gt;&gt; SATAN SWORE HE WOULD GET, BUT GOD TOOK CARE OF IT ALL. YOUR ENEMY HAS SWORE THAT HE WOULD GET YOU. HE SWORE WITH everything you need, HE WOULD BOMBARD YOU WITH EVERY ROUND OF TELEVISION, with every realm of music, every round THAT HE COULD BOMBARD YOU WITH A MESSAGE protecting you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, &gt;&gt; I can hear. &gt;&gt; Watch what he says here. The Lord hath this day to for his people to be a particular people &gt;&gt; as he promised them that thou should keep thy commandments. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12, he says, "NOW ARE WE THE BODY of Christ members in particular?" Ephesians 5:33, nevertheless, let every one of you in particular, he says, and he begins to come down, excuse me, EVEN AS HIS WIFE THAT is her husband. Titus 2:14, WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR US THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM US FROM ALL INIQUITY, PURIFY UNTO HIMSELF A PECULIAR PEOPLE, ZIOUS OF GOOD WORKS. FIRST, FIRST PETERAP 2:9. BUT YOU ARE A CHOSEN generation &gt;&gt; and Royal preach. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't Roy? I'm sitting with them tonight. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; No matter where you're at, &gt;&gt; the ground was just going to mail some mail. &gt;&gt; His plane had been grounded. &gt;&gt; Said, I believe I'll go mail some mail. And he starts going down the road. The Lord says, "Come with me. &gt;&gt; Now, another one of the pray &gt;&gt; she was not a part of the who's who. She didn't know the name William Brown, &gt;&gt; but she said, "I'd be like the shootite woman." &gt;&gt; I'd be like the shootite woman. Where is my life at? &gt;&gt; SHE SIMPLY WAS FULFILLING HER POSITION AND her purpose of life. &gt;&gt; Listen, her testimony WILL GO AROUND THE world many times. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE WAS IN CONTACT WITH GOD. THREE HEBREW CHILDREN WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF JOB THEY HAD, HOW MUCH FAMILY THAT THEY HAD. BUT WE HAVE A TESTIMONY THAT THEY FULFILLED THE PURPOSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; They would not bend. They would not bow. They would not defile theirelves. &gt;&gt; They went to THE FIERY FURNACE. ARE YOU WITH ME TONIGHT? YOU WILL STAND IN THAT &gt;&gt; JALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to us? When a man once catches that vision of the invisible God and know that he's he's always present, there's something that stabilized that man's thinking. It stabilizes his action, his action. And in the time of distress or trouble, it'll still make him look upward. &gt;&gt; Listen, you can't lose. &gt;&gt; There's no way that you can lose &gt;&gt; when you're looking upward. Brother shar something in my heart to witness to one person about this message. Now after you after you witness to all your your neighbors and your enemy, you begin to run out of people. Lord, I need to witness. Listen, in your homes are some of the greatest missionary journeys that you can be in. &gt;&gt; I might get called from heaven, but I want you to understand, God, how do I do this? I witness in my own neighborhood like I should friend of mine said I went home and told my wife I was expecting no from her she said oh that'd be great you know I walked to a door knocked on the door and got those doors slammed in my face with wanting to hand them a track. I knocked on their door and I told them I said Spencer's chief sweetheart bucks over THE ONE. YOU SEE, YOU SIMPLY FIND THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN your life &gt;&gt; and you catch THE CATEGORY THAT GOD WANTS TO BLESS YOU IN. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Listen, I I I I stood before some some HOLLYWOOD STARS AND WITNESS TO them the message &gt;&gt; as a chimney sweep. I stood before mayors and governors and witness to them as a chimney sweep. I'm just dropping this to you. This is free. &gt;&gt; I'm done. &gt;&gt; I STOOD BEFORE JUST A LATE I STOOD BEFORE THE THE THE PRESIDENT OF AN ENTIRE COLLEGE. I SAT AND DRINK HIS COFFEE AND I WITNESSED THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. AND HE AND HE SAID TO ME, "YOU KNOW, IF YOU'D HAVE KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND TOLD ME YOU WANTED TO WITNESS WITNESS THAT TO ME, I WOULD HAVE NEVER let you in." HE SAID, "BUT God Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He looked at me AND HE SAID, "GOD KNOWS HOW TO DO HIS BUSINESS." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I don't want you TO BE A KID TONIGHT. BUT LISTEN, YOU FIND YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; MAYBE IT'S NOT TO BE A PREACHER. MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN TO BE A SINGER. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not to DO A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS. BUT IF YOU FIND YOUR PURPOSE OF LIFE AND YOU BECOME a witness, and you BECOME A WITNESS OF A LIVING LORD JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE A LIFE THAT COMES FORTH FROM YOU. &gt;&gt; But before you CAN BE A WITNESS, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE INSIDE of you. &gt;&gt; That this BOOK HAS BECOME A LIVING PERSON TO YOU. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN JUST BOOKS, QUOTES, AND TAPES. &gt;&gt; But it lives in life. I'm a young man. I'm a young lady. I'm not trained. He don't need you to be so trained. &gt;&gt; Heard you heard a man today found his flesh. He said he preach a fine job of preaching with this job. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm a sister. I'm not a preacher. You do a fine job of preaching with your life. &gt;&gt; When you walk through Walmart, I'm sure you've got at least two here. When you walk through Walmart, you're a light to the entire world. &gt;&gt; They may hate just like just like they hated Joseph and they hated Jesus. They may literally hate the ground that you walk on and don't even know why. &gt;&gt; But you walk as a victory &gt;&gt; that somebody's still living. &gt;&gt; Because remember, WE'RE NOT HERE FOR VERY LONG. &gt;&gt; WE'RE PILGRIMS AND STRANGERS IN SEARCH OF THE CITY. &gt;&gt; We're not going to be HERE FOR MUCH LONGER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHY YOU SPEND SO MUCH ENERGY, BROTHER? LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE very much longer. I'm going TO SPEND EVERY MOMENT THAT I can Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When a RACER COMES ACROSS THE END OF THE race and he falls against AND HE'S IF HE HASN'T SPENT ALL of it, HE HE'S REALLY JUST WASTED IT. BUT WHEN HE'S GIVEN HIS ALL &gt;&gt; AND HE FALLS ACROSS THAT FINISH LINE, YOU CAN SAY THAT man has given everything. &gt;&gt; I pray when I fall into his arms &gt;&gt; in a rapture in a grave, I FALL WITH NO ENERGY AT ALL IN my one. &gt;&gt; Listen, this message is for you. Joseph had his turn. &gt;&gt; Whenever he was bowing to it, &gt;&gt; he was standing. He was revealing himself to his brethren. One day you will reveal yourself to the whole world. &gt;&gt; ONE DAY YOU'LL REVEAL YOURSELF TO THE WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; I'm a PART OF THAT RAPTURE. YOU THOUGHT I wasn't. You thought I was a fanatic. &gt;&gt; But I want to &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'M THE CAUSE, THE PREDESTINATE, &gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; I want you to reveal. I WANT TO REVEAL TO YOU THE REAL JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You know, this is the first I really don't know my own purpose. I don't know. I just kind of drifted along and kind of banged against the rocks and banged against my own ambition. I've been my own greatest secret. You're not the only his father's control. I want to invite you. conversation. I want to ask you sort out your own direction. I want to serve his purpose, not my ambition. &gt;&gt; Even my parents purpose. A lot of times parents live their lives through their children. This has to be personal to you. looking for supernatural things to happen. We're not necessarily looking for emotion, but we're looking for something that happens eternally. A preacher didn't lay his hands on me. There's a greater than a preacher in this greater than Solomon in this. He simply asked him to be the king of the control room of your heart. He's asking that can I be your guide? Can I be your direction? Can I spend a few moments with you in your day? Can I show you my word in a reality form? &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, tonight you see every young man and every young lady that has walked to this altar tonight. &gt;&gt; Lord, we have invited you and you're here. &gt;&gt; These are your children. Maybe they've wandered and kind of lost their way a little bit. Maybe they sat on A PEW AND IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE JUST GOING THROUGH THE motions of it. But oh God, TONIGHT MAY WE GRAB A HOLD OF THE PURPOSE OF GOD IN THEIR LIFE. &gt;&gt; And it's more than going to church. &gt;&gt; It's more than listening to a tape. &gt;&gt; It's more than just singing a song. &gt;&gt; But it becomes a living reality in our eyes. Oh, come rude over our soul tonight, oh God. &gt;&gt; May we step within the veil tonight. May this kind of glory of God just be like a column that comes down over top of us. Oh God, &gt;&gt; may we just simply lose ourselves. &gt;&gt; Oh God, YOU KNOW WHERE WE'VE BEEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE SITUATIONS in our lives. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND US. You know the dungeons that we've lived in. You know our private ambitions tonight. WE GIVE IT ALL TO you in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We want to serve this message in Christ with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; We want the significance of your word of your vision to become a living reality in our hearts. &gt;&gt; Oh God, COME FILL US NOW WITH YOUR PRESENCE. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, you see this many people tonight. Oh, how they need you. Oh God, you made us a promise that you would come. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, won't you just move with us tonight? &gt;&gt; We lay aside every weight and every sin that's just easily beset us and we're going to run like never before in our lives. &gt;&gt; Forgive us, oh God. We need &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Won't you pray with your lips? &gt;&gt; Just my Jesus, come to me right where I'm at. You know my situation. You know my condition of your life. Oh God, would you just come now? &gt;&gt; Oh God, hear my humble cry. Hallelujah. Hallelu Christ. Savior is thou. Oh, God. Say you are saveior my cry. The sound are the &gt;&gt; We believed. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We believe God has spoken. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How many can testify that God has spoken to them? &gt;&gt; Young people, how many could say God has spoken to them? &gt;&gt; Our dear brother Ron never realized what we did in junior camp. He didn't know we did two nights of Joseph and the Holy Spirit has come behind that to confirm &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; This is not the orchestration of man. This has been the orchestration of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And saints of God, you should be spiritual enough that you can say, "God is doing something new." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to say to you tonight, if you are still in your prison, &gt;&gt; if you are still in your prison, &gt;&gt; the God that got Joseph out of that prison &gt;&gt; is the same one that is here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need business tonight. You say, "Well, I haven't made a move." Make a move now. &gt;&gt; Show God you mean business. &gt;&gt; This is God made. This is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And who wants to be loosed? &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Pass me, oh gentle God, &gt;&gt; loose me &gt;&gt; from myself. &gt;&gt; My worst enemy, myself." Yes, &gt;&gt; God is here tonight &gt;&gt; to punctuate, to tell you that you're free tonight by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if you want to be free tonight and get that devil that has been driving you down off your back, why don't you reach out to him and say, "Pass me." &gt;&gt; And I said, "God bless you." Maybe there's still another young person that says, "I'm going to make a move tonight. I'm going to make a move." &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, you made a move one night and God's done great things and he's willing to do more great things. Don't look around. Look up. You're redemption from God. &gt;&gt; Who wants to be free tonight? He cried out, "Brother Brandon, free us from this house of hell. Free us from this prison house." He looked at his arms. He said, "I'm not strong enough. How will I do it?" Then that purifier said, "Say it in the name of Jesus Christ." And those bars started to pump. &gt;&gt; Those walls gave way. &gt;&gt; We believe the prison bars are made loose tonight. The walls be ready in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Ask me Lord. Hear me tonight. The halls are full. Don't look around. Look up. Look up to him. &gt;&gt; This is on the move. We're in the vision. We're in the vision. We see ourselves in the vision. We're free. According to the vision, &gt;&gt; we are liberated people.

Many of you were not here. Monday night. I wasn't here, but I want to see it as soon as I can. And Tuesday night, Monday night, they put on a for the young children, the juniors.

Joseph cast into a pit. screaming and crying at Hebra, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't hold this against you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Joseph going to the Piper's house and Piper on the platform. &gt;&gt; Joseph stolen in the slave and in prison and Joseph going to the right hand of Pharaoh.
