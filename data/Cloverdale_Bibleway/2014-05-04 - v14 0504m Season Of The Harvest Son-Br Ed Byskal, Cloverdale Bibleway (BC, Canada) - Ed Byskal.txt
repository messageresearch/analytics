Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Why don't we just sing He is here. Hallelujah. He is here. I'm going to ask if the brothers if they would just prepare for the morning offering this morning. We do have a number of prayer requests, but maybe we could just sing this as a confession as we just prepare to go to prayer this morning. Amen. He is here. You can touch him. Amen. And you'll never be the same. &gt;&gt; Oh, and he is here. Hallelu. Oh, he is here. [Music] Is he here?

Children's family is asking that we would please remember brother Elass's dad Eddie. He was taken to the hospital today for small seizures and being dehydrated. just asking for a touch for him. Also, brother Hugh was just asking we'd remember Sister Sylvia. She's hurt her ankle and is in pain. And Sister Shenise is asking we please pray for her dad. He's in the process of trying to come here and join us in church. So, please remember him. If there's something on your heart that you'd just like to let be known with an upraised hand. Amen. I believe God sees that even that is an act of faith as you raise your hand saying, "God, remember me this morning." Amen, brother Tim. [Music] Amen. Let's pray together as we lift our hearts before the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful redeemer. We're so thankful. We're so grateful that we can not just sing that song, but believe that song. You are here. Wherever two or three are gathered in your name is, you're in the midst of them. And that's not just another saying or another scripture to us, oh Lord. And Lord, it causes us to desire to sensitize ourselves to the moving of your Holy Spirit this morning. We believe that you have a special service for us this morning. That Lord, it's good for us to be here and to be in your presence, to be ready to hear the word, to be receptive and have open hearts. And for that cause we do lift our hearts before you desiring oh Lord that you will come in a special way today. Lord may you move upon brother Biscll as he has labored in your word. Lord once more we pray that you will take the gift and minister to the need of the body of Jesus Christ. Whether it be here in the local assembly or out over the internet or somebody that might watch it in the days ahead. We believe that you're able to sovereignly direct the gift according to your perfect will in mind today. And Lord, we're needy this morning. Lord, as long as we're on this earth in these mortal bodies, we will have needs. We remember brother Ricardo this morning who's injured. Oh God. Lord, we remember the children's dad. We remember Sister Sylvia, oh God. We remember the others, oh Lord, that are held before us. Sister Chenise's father, oh God. Some have physical needs. Some have spiritual needs. Some, Lord, have financial needs. There's hands raised before you. And you are a great God, a personal God that knows each and every need. Lord, it does not need to be made known before the congregation. But Lord, we come to you with our request this morning believing that the blood of Jesus Christ has paid for every redemptive blessing. We count the blood as sufficient this morning. &gt;&gt; And we give our knees. We lay our burdens at your feet. &gt;&gt; Asking Lord not our will but thy will be done &gt;&gt; in earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just surrender ourselves to you. Bless Lord the remainder of the song service. Bless Lord the ministry of the word. And as we give this offering unto you, we give it as a form of worship this morning. And we ask you Lord to receive our worship. Bless the offering and may you use it for the glory of the kingdom of God. We commit all to you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I forgot to mention our brother Ricardo had also had a a fall off of a ladder and was taken to the hospital and I thought how fitting the same morning we had a prayer request that we had a testimony from a brother Vile for the same type of thing. Amen. God knows. God bless you. As you have your seats, why don't we sing There is none like you. As we take up the morning offering. Amen. Oh, there is none like you, Lord. No one else can touch my heart like you do. And I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find. There is none like you. There is none. There is none like you, Lord. No one else can touch my heart like you. And I can search for all eternity, Lord. And there is none like you. Sing it out to me again. There's none, Lord. Lord, there is none like you. [Music] No one else can touch my heart like you do. [Music] And I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find. There is none like Hallelujah. Once more, there is none like you, Lord. Yes, there is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you. And I could search for all eternity, more and there is none like you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I believe brother Mike Ray has an announcement for us. Maybe he could just come uh have that right now. And as he's coming, we have a thank you from our sister Barb and the Drake family. We would like to thank everyone for their labor of love and support for Levi and Karen's wedding. May our Lord bless you richly. Amen. And we also have many visitors here still from Florida. We just want to greet you all. Brother Danny Stevens going to be speaking this night, this evening, excuse me. Amen. So all those who are visiting with us, all brother Shannon, sister Angela, God bless you. Nice to have you here with us. Many others have made their way here for the service. I believe in Brother Timothy was here. God bless you. Amen. It's going to be a wonderful day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Though, if your license plate is AMY4456, it might be a little less wonderful if you don't go turn your lights off. So, it's a Washington plate Thunderbird. So, you might want to take care of that. Mike, you ready? And God bless you. Good morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, take a wild guess what I'm going to announce this morning. I didn't hear the wild guess, but I'm going to tell you camp registration is ready and open. But it is very important this year uh more than really every other year. We've already had up towards to uh 40 uh people from out of town already um on the wait list and that's from Philippines and Switzerland and Poland and uh and many other places. And so of course our local assembly is first but uh we're going to we give you the period of time to register and after that your spot gets put to someone else. All right. So who here plans to come to camp? Wow. I'm scared. Um so it is it is available June 24th is the deadline. So, if you can please register and uh or for families, please email the the email address is on the website as well. So, just send an email to to Abigail and we'll start planning for that. It's a few short weeks away really. It's the first uh well the end of July, 1st of August. So, it's one week earlier this year and it seems it seems almost like a month that one week seems to shift us. But so, we're uh already geared up and going. Bless you, Shannon. And uh so, please do me a favor. sign up early and uh here we go. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to invite I believe the group from brother Danny's church is going to come and sing for us. So maybe why don't they come as they come. Let's just sing I want what you want for me, dear Lord. Oh, I want what you want for me to whatever wherever it may be. Cuz I know that you know what's best my Lord. Oh, I want what you want for me. Yes, I want what you want. And once more, I want what you want for me, Lord. I want what you want for me, dear.

[Music] No one on earth could fathom how wonderful you are. Your glory fills the heavens. My heart longs to respond [Music] before your throne. One day I'll bow. With each glimpse, Lord, even now I am overwhelmed by who you are. singing, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty. My heart is cry worthy is a lamb upon the throne. Holy, holy, holy. How your glory keeps unfolding. All the honor, thanks and praise are yours alone. How holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. [Music] Creations bringing praises, thanksgiving to your name. Multitudes of angels surround the throne of praise. So I will join you chorus strong. Lay my life down every crown. For all you've done in everything you are.

Thank you very much. Why don't we just invite our pastor, brother Bisl, is going to come now as he comes. Why don't we sing? We are standing on holy ground. Amen. Do you believe there are angels all around you? This morning, Brother Brandham said, "If we could just see into that other dimension," Amen. I've often thought about how he would talk about the black streaks from one to another. But I believe that on the flip side, there must be streaks of light going back and forth. Amen. Hallelujah. Anointing our faith, preparing us to receive the word. Hallelujah. Why don't we just prepare our hearts now as our pastor comes and we are standing on holy ground. We are standing on holy ground. [Music] And I know that there are angels. [Music] [Music] Oh Jesus. We are standing in his presence on holy ground. I know you like to stand as we sing it again. We're standing. We are Hey, [Music] [Music] Jesus now for we are standing in his presence on holy ground. This once more lift your voices again. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Jesus. [Music] We are [Music] his presence. [Music] Amen. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be gathered in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or I thought of house of prayer, house of worship. And it's so nice to see you all here. I'll just have you have your seats for a few moments. I' I've also requested that brother Ryan and uh the choir group will sing the fourth man in the fire. I want to glorify him. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; The living word of Christ. &gt;&gt; And they didn't that was a surprise and they didn't expect to see one like under the son of God in the furnace. But he was he's in our furnace. Amen. Um, I want to thank brother Jim Hayes for the email yesterday and um, he stayed here for the service and rather than take a flight overseas and I started I'm just going to give you a couple details that have made me feel very very humble and uh, said that he was going to bring his brother I believe that's brother Henry. Is brother Henry here? Could you stand so I can see you there? God bless you. Thank you. And they've made such an effort. Thank you, brother Jim. The other night, I thought I was just making a rather casual announcement for everyone. I'd like everyone from the assembly to be here. And uh brother Timothy Anoco was streaming the meeting in Johannesburg. And uh and when I said, "I'd like to have everybody here at church on Sunday morning as I thought I had something, you know, I wanted everyone to hear." And so he said, "Well, yeah, you know, within himself, he said, "Yes, I I I'll be there because I'll be streaming." He said, "And just as I said that in my heart," he said, "and you said, "And I don't want you staying at home streaming." And he just said, "Oh, well, that's it." So he picked up the phone and called the airlines, called his travel agent and they said, "There's no flights." He said, "Just keep trying." And they finally found a seat on Air France and I picked him up the next night and Brother Timothy Anatogo is here. I said, "I've never had anybody." You stand, brother Timothy. I picked him up at the airport and I said, "I've never had anybody fly 15,000 kilometers to come to church, but now we have it." So I I think we set a record this time as well. So God bless you, brother Timothy. Brother and sister Poacher are here from Montana. Did we have Did you have them stand? &gt;&gt; Uh I'd like to have them stand. Brother Shannon, God bless you. We've had some nice times of fellowship and we look forward to more. Then the family and friends of the uh uh of the family of brother Levi and sister Karen Drake, who I now call Karen Drake, uh from the wedding yesterday. and we've heard some of the singers and brother brother Danny Steam the pastor down in Sarasota will be speaking tonight &gt;&gt; so we're looking forward to that and his wife Michelle with him and he rather than sit on the platform he thought he'll sit down in the seat so anyway brother Danny and we get to go to Sarasota then you'll let me sit down there and the group in church in Reton and brother brother Peter, God bless you, met brother Freddy and some of those from the uh from the church down in Seattle Tacoma which meets in Reton at the church in Reton. They canled their service today to be with us and we really appreciate that. That's just really special to have you. We we love that fellowship. &gt;&gt; Some of the ministers will be arriving in the next few days that will be coming. Some ministers are coming in for brother Tim and sister Sarah's wedding, which is the following week on the 17th. But I wanted to say that brother Steven Abali from Uganda is one of the ministers that is coming. And for those young people's group that went to uh Uganda, you remember him well. And he will be speaking on Sunday the 18th, May the 18th. So, we're happy. Uh I've asked if brother Ryan and the group could could sing. So, I wonder if the singers could come and uh join Brother Ryan to sing Fourth Man in the Fireplace. And then we're going to go right into the word of God. Will that be fine? We'll just take an extra few moments to concentrate as they sang about this one unexpected. They didn't fast for him. They didn't do any long prayers for him. He was just there. &gt;&gt; And at the moment, &gt;&gt; the moment we need him the most, &gt;&gt; he will be there. And that's what we want to be able to say this morning freely. The light's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I say it again? The light is here. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I should say something inspired by the Ryan. He wrote this song, but it's one of our favorites. [Music] The moment now has come. There's nothing to be done. My accusers stand before me and there's nowhere left to run. And so it ends this way. There's nothing more to say. I will pay the price and give my life for the choice that I have made. [Music] Oh, but suddenly, [Music] what is this I see as I'm cast into the fire? There is one who stands by me. I saw the fourth man between the flames and night. When there was no hope at all, he saved me just in time. pulling back the forces that press on every side. I am saved by the voice in the fire. I am saved by the fourth man in the fire. [Music] And now the test is passed. But it was not the last. For my accusers seek to find me weak and constantly attack. They're searching to and fro. Constantly they go and in my desperate hour seek to devour and strike the fatal blow. But I am not afraid. Oh, and they are much dismayed. For between a stand, the son of man and the standard he has raised. I saw the for between the night and there was no s [Music] By the fourth man in the fire, I saved by the fourth man in the fire. [Music] Jesus for me. Jesus Christ for my hour of &gt;&gt; in my desperate hour [Music] at my side. at my side. &gt;&gt; The time was at all. He saved me just in time. I saw the for between &gt;&gt; between the and there was no battle. He saved me just in time. Nothing else can harm me with Jesus. Jesus. I say by the fourth man in the army. I am I save by the fourth man in the fire. [Music] I am saved by the fourth man in the fire. [Music] [Applause] If you've never met him, if you've never met him, I don't know how he might meet you. I can tell you once, once you meet him, your life is never the same. &gt;&gt; Never the same. I have you stand with me if you would please, and we're going to read in the scripture in Matthew the 13th chapter. And I'll also read Isaiah 61 or rather 60 and one and two just two verses. Matthew is going to be the 13th chapter and we will begin reading at verse 24. But just before we read, we'll ask the Lord's blessing upon our gathering. Dear heavenly father, we are so so grateful. Our hearts are filled with thanksgiving. You are the author of salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we came into the world as sinners born in sin and shapen in iniquity. &gt;&gt; But your cleansing was more than sufficient. &gt;&gt; You have cleansed us, oh God. Not merely forgiven, but you have cleansed us, oh God. You brought forth a virgin bride to Jesus Christ. This one was has been sung about the fourth man in the fire. You've been all down through the generations, Lord. And we did not leave you in the past. We do not leave you in history. We believe that you are present. &gt;&gt; You are here in this uh in this sanctuary. You are where each one is gathered, whether they be streaming or in some hospital bed or some room. We pray that you will meet with us, oh God, in a special way. We give ourselves to you unreservedly, Father, to the Holy Spirit's leadership and guidance. Be glorified for you are the only one that is worthy. No flesh shall glorify be glorified in your presence in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; We thank you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Reading from Matthew. The kingdom of heaven. Verse 24. Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field. But while men slept, the enemy came and swed tears among the wheat. But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tears also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, "Sir, did thou not sow good seed, good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tears?" He said unto them, "An enemy hath done this?" The servant said unto him, "Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest ye gather up the tears, lest while you gather up the tears, ye root up also the wheat with them. But let them grow together until the harvest. And in the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tears, and bind them into bundles to burn them. but gather the wheat into my barn. And then if you want wish to read in Isaiah chapter 60 two verses, shine for the light has come in the glory of the Lord. Lord has risen upon thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; For behold, the darkness shall come, shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. But the Lord shall rise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, &gt;&gt; and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and the and the kings and kings to the brightness of thy rising. You may be seated. I want to more clearly define verse 30 which we read on the screen. Please, if you'll put it up, that's the verse 30 of Matthew. And I'd like to define it a little more. You young people are accustomed to this. Let them both grow together. until the harvest. until the harvest. And in the time of harvest, I will I will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tears, and bind them in bundles to burn them. But gather the wheat into my barn. While those are still there, a prophet of God has spoken of gather first the tears and bind them into bundles to burn. I want you to remember that. And he said also that the gospel, the preaching of the gospel blind some. And the two messengers were actually angel messengers went to Sodom &gt;&gt; and they were beating at the door of Lot &gt;&gt; but they were struck with blindness. &gt;&gt; So the preaching of the gospel blinds here here in the physical earth. We may see people as being very popular and and uh and they are messengers of God and the world may take them wrong and may you know uh Billy Graeme was one of those messengers. All right. &gt;&gt; Uh he consorted with the presidents and many presidents and that might give a wrong impression to us. But whether they saw something or whether they were blinded, that's up to God. That that's not up to us. &gt;&gt; So I just want you to see that we can we can uh then go on to the next uh the parable. the parable of the Lord Jesus Christ uh when he said that the kingdom of heaven was like unto a man who sowed good seed only to have an enemy come and plant tears uh amongst those good seeds. God did not plant the tears. &gt;&gt; Satan planted those tears right amongst the good seed of God. Those two kinds of plants or people from two different seeds grew up together. &gt;&gt; This is what I want you to notice. They partok of the nourishment in the same earth. &gt;&gt; They shared in the same sun, &gt;&gt; rain and other benefits &gt;&gt; and both were harvested in their turn. Uh this was this has special meaning for me because when I actually had met brother Brandham this was one of the one of 10,000 questions I guess at least a thousand questions in my heart. How could we gather together and fellowship and sing the same songs and weep over the same preaching and be affected emotionally. I was affected others were affected and then I would hear some rank story. right &gt;&gt; uh out of a minister's mouth. I and I was struck &gt;&gt; how could that come out of the same mouth. I just was thanking God a few moments ago &gt;&gt; and and and I just saw things in a spiral &gt;&gt; going down. And that was one of the things I asked him that how could they I said I know what the anointing is and I know they're anointed and they're incredible preachers. How is this happening? And he asked if I had heard his service, false anointed ones. He hadn't preached it yet for four years, but he asked me if I'd heard it. See, in the you you you as as individuals, we as individuals must realize we're here in a physical body that's not going to last all that long. &gt;&gt; But our souls is from another realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the souls of a believer of God's seed that he sowed, &gt;&gt; he's going to, he said, he will not lose one of them. &gt;&gt; And no man, Jesus said, can pluck them out of my hand. &gt;&gt; That's something you have to remember. &gt;&gt; I know that you do. &gt;&gt; All right. I'd just like to leave that for now. uh then uh I want to make some points here that you can remember please. Light is by the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; In other words, the manifested word of God, the word of God identified is light. &gt;&gt; The most intense heat &gt;&gt; from the sun is at the harvest time. The most intense sen light is when the spoken word or prophecies are being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ was a time of rapid fulfillment &gt;&gt; or I should say bright sunshine or harvest &gt;&gt; uh harvest sun. The intensity of harvest sen brought an entire group or crop of individuals both for and against the living revealed word. &gt;&gt; And we've just come through the uh through the resurrection uh Easter time. And so some of these comments now I'm going to tie it all together as we as we move forward. We can shut those off now, please. Thank you. Now there is a I just have you listen to this out of the message shalom and two or three of you or some of you have asked which message you should read for today's service but in the message shalom and going to be turning some corners here so I hope you just stay with me you'll have to ponder this service arise and shine 9 in the message shalom. For the glory of God has come upon you. He's quoting Isaiah 60. The light is here. And then the very next verse says, gross darkness is upon his people or this people. And then when we are in a mixtury of light and darkness and I just like you to notice a word that there is it's not in any dictionary but whoever invented words we have new words that come up every year every new year they always give the new words that have come up that year but they don't say who invented them they just kind of evolve and people start using new terms and new terminology and new words. Well, this is a word and as far as I'm concerned, the prophet used it and it had some meaning. So, we have light. Arise and shine. The light has come and then there's darkness and gross darkness upon the people. So, we have light and darkness. But now he introduces and then when we are in a mixtury of light and darkness and if you googled that word you would find that it has been used and is being used with uh one gentleman who's using or orchestra uh live orchestra. He's putting he's putting and blending the instruments and the instrument sounds together in such a way that they actually use the word mixtury there. and and so it has been it has been used by the world but there's no terminology for it but today uh I want to use it quite freely uh when and then when we are in a mixtury of light and darkness and then my address to the church is shalom peace &gt;&gt; my address his address &gt;&gt; to the church is shalom you can take it from William Brandham or you say he was speaking by inspiration &gt;&gt; speaking as a servant, a prophet, messenger, &gt;&gt; my address. So I receive that from the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I'm using I'm looking upon him as a vessel. &gt;&gt; I'm saying as he said it already in the scripture, &gt;&gt; my peace give I unto you. &gt;&gt; I would say that we're in a mixtury. &gt;&gt; I don't think there's anybody here that wants to say that there's no darkness in the world. Uh when there seems to be such neurotic insanity everywhere and governments and and people of stature making uh making statements and making promises that uh are not being kept or we we find things taking place today literal genocide almost happening within countries talking about such violence and yet great powerful leaders with nuclear power at their disposal and all. Not that they should use it, but to say that they've got sophisticated power and all the rest of it and tremendous uh tremendous persuasion in the world and yet nothing can be done and you have a million or more Syrian people and children. Do those children earn that? Do those children do anything for that? or you find other places within Africa or Asia, other parts of the world and it just seems like uh in in most incredible and and indescribable pain and slaughter taking place and the world seems helpless to put an end to it or to stop it. You have to say this is not a uh this is not a world of peace. &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of that, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; there's one who is the prince of peace. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not something that you are to enjoy on a Sunday morning service &gt;&gt; or on the Lord's day or at any other evening time, but there's this is something that's supposed to work &gt;&gt; in your day-today life. &gt;&gt; This is something in the darkest moment &gt;&gt; somehow there's a a a peace. &gt;&gt; And so I want to speak about that. But I also want to bring to you the this bright light that is shining as a harvest light and probably in a way that many of you have not uh perhaps thought of but I've been speaking a number of services here and so if I repeat some things to the congregation you'll understand why. And further in shalom he said uh that's him among us his word being identified. And for those of you that may be visiting and so on when I make these statements and make them strong &gt;&gt; and make them very very clear. &gt;&gt; You listen close because further on I'll be evidencing that. &gt;&gt; I'll be addressing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's him among us. And may I say I have been in the services where he said that's him among us &gt;&gt; and then go into the supernatural realm and prove it was him &gt;&gt; because he proved it was beyond a human &gt;&gt; ability. And I will I will refer to some of that and quote some of that and I will give you one experience one in special that that you can go to the office and get the get the interview. I interviewed the ma'am. No prayer cards, nobody on the platform. Called right out of a car like this. And I know the man very very well. Personally interviewed him on a at a television station and uh down in Ron Oak, uh Virginia, I guess it is Ron Oak. And uh and uh and the whole staff invaded us. &gt;&gt; They were so moved by that testimony. And brother Brandham is calling him out. That's what I am referring to. That's him among us. His word is being identified. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; That's when you get shalom. &gt;&gt; The darkness is separating itself from the light. And I'd like you to know that in the messages I haven't got time, but he he talks about the darkness at 1958. He talks about the darkness and the light and it's there. And now 1964 he says the darkness is separating itself from the light. And he takes that process. So we all agree I'm sure that there's plenty of darkness. He says God's causing it and the light's doing it. &gt;&gt; I even know I know for many believers that's that's a stickler. We want to think about it. &gt;&gt; The darkness God's causing it. &gt;&gt; The separating &gt;&gt; and the light's doing it. See, he said the light's pressing itself &gt;&gt; in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together. &gt;&gt; And I want to say this that the to the I have Jewish friends and they have said to me openly that uh because they do not believe in Jesus Christ as we do but they have said they feel that they what about all the scriptures that have been fulfilled? Well, they felt that the uh the disciples did certain things to create the event &gt;&gt; so that you know him riding on the donkey and the f of an ass and coming into Jerusalem, they thought that was kind of a put up. It was kind of done. And then at the time of the crucifixion, they said they they they offered the chief priest offered money and said that, you know, if he's if if if he's taken down from the cross or if he's they'll say that he's risen out of the tomb, if his body is not there and we'll give them money. And they said, well, we'll we'll even secure you the soldiers. And they gave them large money, the Bible says, because they said, then the first first error will be worse than the second, I guess it was. and and here they're making all kinds of things but they were thinking that the people were engineering the fulfillment of scripture &gt;&gt; but if you look carefully God does it in such a way and I'm coming to a point that point is that that we must be able to identify scripture &gt;&gt; that interprets and identifies perfectly clearly events in our time &gt;&gt; otherwise this is only a book of history &gt;&gt; we're Not just studying history. If we're studying history, you might as well lock the doors up and go home. We need something that's relevant. &gt;&gt; We need something that is relevant to not only youth, but families, &gt;&gt; something to seniors. We need something that's relevant &gt;&gt; that that interprets the day that we're in. &gt;&gt; And that is the purpose of of the service this morning. And he said, "So the light is pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together." &gt;&gt; And they had a chance to accept it. They wouldn't do it. So it's condensed itself. The darkness has condensed itself. And they do that by putting the church together and the council of churches that the council of churches was being congregated at the at the time these messages were being spoken. But now we're in another season. And uniting it with the pagan darkness when they so firmly disagree with one another. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You'll find out out in the darkness, they completely disagree with one another, but they will join forces against the word, revealed word. Yes. &gt;&gt; And when they so firmly disagree with one another, but yet they had to go together to make the night come upon the people. &gt;&gt; So there's innocent people that find themselves in darkness, find themselves in utter confusion and they don't know exactly why. All they know they've come under the influence of something, but it's not it's not for the believer. Light is by the spoken word of God. as we just had up a moment ago. And the most intense heat is the harvest sun. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, and there's a man that can turn on the light. It's the same sun, but each day it brings forth its strength a little stronger to ripen the grain uh for the harvest. Each day now they'll get a little stronger, a little stronger until finally the wheat that's laying there, it'll go to taking life. &gt;&gt; That's a wonderful and strange statement. The wheat laying there will go to taking life. &gt;&gt; All the life that was in the root, all the life that was in the stock, all the life that was in the head, and all the life that was in the shock, &gt;&gt; all that life will now be in the wheat. That's not so with the weeds. &gt;&gt; The just and the unjust are having the same nourishment, the same rain, &gt;&gt; the same benefits, &gt;&gt; the same sunshine, everything the same, but are coming to a different a different conclusion &gt;&gt; at the end. And the sun comes a little stronger each day, each day. And the grain should be a little more matured to receive the sunlight. I expect I'm speaking to some mature people. &gt;&gt; Now, the intensity of the harvest son, I want to take it at the time of we just came through the crucifixion and the time of uh the time of the cross, the judgment, the crucifixion. Listen to these words. And now we in this context that the son is the word manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the scripture says, Jesus speaking in John 13:18, I speak not to all. I know whom I have chosen, but that the scripture might be fulfilled, &gt;&gt; but that the scripture might be fulfilled. The fulfillment of scripture &gt;&gt; is sunlight. It's heat, &gt;&gt; it's intensity. Now watch in the rapid. There were so many scriptures that were being fulfilled right at the time &gt;&gt; of the crucifixion. and the resurrection &gt;&gt; one after the other. And so he said, "But that the scripture might be fulfilled. He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me." &gt;&gt; Now listen real close. Listen real close. We say, "Well, that it might be fulfilled for Jesus." It also had to be fulfilled. This occasion had to arrive and the sun had to shine with this intensity to fulfill the scripture to give the opportunity to the one who was going to lift up his heel. &gt;&gt; It was the sunlight that caused the darkness &gt;&gt; to make darkness to be what it was. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he'd have never had anybody lift up his heel against if the sun hadn't shone. And the sun shone said, "I'm going to fulfill that scripture. It must be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Matthew 26:54. But then how how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that it must be? &gt;&gt; It must be the sun must shine, &gt;&gt; but also uh the weeds must grow. &gt;&gt; Matthew 26:56. But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. The scriptures of who? You mean these men? You mean these men that were killed? These men that were slain by righteous people or so-called righteous were killed because they said those things. And now here they are being fulfilled &gt;&gt; and being manifested and God supernaturally is saying that it's his word. &gt;&gt; These scriptures must be fulfilled that the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Right &gt;&gt; now, they were in darkness, but they were caught in that. &gt;&gt; They were caught in uh an unsuspecting, shall I say, an unexpected event. &gt;&gt; There's good people, &gt;&gt; good believers &gt;&gt; that get caught in a in a moment &gt;&gt; that they did not anticipate &gt;&gt; and they said, "I didn't know that this was going to happen in the message. &gt;&gt; I didn't expect this." And so they uh then all the disciples forsook him and fled. Why? Because the sun was shining in greater heat. They hadn't fled from him before. &gt;&gt; They didn't run from him on the mount uh on the mount of transfiguration. They didn't run from him when he was speaking uh on on the mount, the sermon on the mount and saying all those wonderful things. They never ran. Now they did. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sun is rising and shining at a different intensity. And then in Mark 14:49, I was daily with you in the temple teaching. He's talking to all the people. &gt;&gt; I was daily with you in the temple teaching and you took me not &gt;&gt; but that the scripture but the scripture must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's shining. It's a different season. &gt;&gt; And then they took him. that gave them the opportunity &gt;&gt; for the darkness to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; Mark 15:28, "And the scriptures was fulfilled." And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, "And he was numbered with the transgressors." Now, I just I I just gave you those so I could come back to this. The intensity of the harvest sun fulfillment brought an entire crop of individuals both for and against the living revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Caiaphas was able I will say that the sun shining in its intensity &gt;&gt; I'll have to listen very close. Don't be distracted. The sun shining in its intensity gave Caiaphas opportunity to make the decision. The chief priests &gt;&gt; brought them to their harvest time. &gt;&gt; The Pharisees, &gt;&gt; Judas the son of predition, &gt;&gt; captains of the of the temple, &gt;&gt; Pilate, &gt;&gt; and his wife to have her dreams. &gt;&gt; What caused that? The sun was shining. &gt;&gt; Herod, &gt;&gt; the mocking soldiers, &gt;&gt; the crowd wagging their heads. &gt;&gt; The soldiers casting lots for a garment. &gt;&gt; They might have done it before, but not this garment. &gt;&gt; What allowed all this to happen? The sun was shining &gt;&gt; and there was a harvest &gt;&gt; and the harvest was the son of God. Not three died at Calvary, four. &gt;&gt; The son of God &gt;&gt; took one thief. &gt;&gt; And the son of predition took the other. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he might go to his place. &gt;&gt; That's right. But Jesus died that he might go to his place. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he wasn't telling a lie when he said, "I go to prepare a place for you." &gt;&gt; That where I am, there you may be also. &gt;&gt; That's not a myth. &gt;&gt; That's not a story. That's not church annity. That's not religion. You don't have to go to church to find that out. But Jesus said that the sun shining &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; said that. &gt;&gt; And the son that he was speaking to, perhaps they didn't regard that at all because they said he he's a blasphemer. &gt;&gt; We we we've got accusers that have come in here that have heard him and they said he said he's going to destroy the temple. And he didn't say that. He said to them, "Destroy this temple." And the word that he used there in the Greek is not is not to destroy, to annihilate, which he used that he did use that word with that meaning before. But when he said to the Pharisees and the leaders, "Destroy this temple." In other words, do what you're going to do. &gt;&gt; Get it over with. &gt;&gt; But when he used the word destroy this temple and I will in three days I'll raise it up, it was loose me. &gt;&gt; Loose me. loose me from this uh body &gt;&gt; and in three days I'll raise it up again. &gt;&gt; But they had false accusers that come in just change one word. &gt;&gt; They said, "Well, we heard him." And the government listened to him. &gt;&gt; The government took it down in their records &gt;&gt; that he had said this, that he had blasphemed, that he came against us. And then they used politics and they said, "Shall I crucify your king?" He's not our king. &gt;&gt; We have one king. It's Caesar. &gt;&gt; Can we imagine them choosing Caesar over Jesus Christ, the son of God? &gt;&gt; You talk about being deceived. &gt;&gt; And so there was a harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the son of God, &gt;&gt; and one thief. And the son, Judas, the son of predition, took his own life, and one thief went his way. He railed on Christ. If you're the Christ, deliver us. &gt;&gt; The sun was shining. false accuser said, "We found this fellow perverting the nation &gt;&gt; and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a king." Find that scripture. &gt;&gt; These people said they heard it. There's people today saying they've heard things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just wonder and I would like to ask you reverently. Do you think these people would have made a website if they'd had the opportunity? &gt;&gt; I thought I should ask that question. Do you think that they would be on Twitter? &gt;&gt; Would they would they use emails? &gt;&gt; Now you know. Now you know who's doing it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Also there had the sunshine brought out &gt;&gt; Barabus. &gt;&gt; Barabus a murderer, a known murderer, noted murderer in prison for murder. &gt;&gt; But the sunshine &gt;&gt; brought him a deliverance &gt;&gt; and an acquitt of a sort. Simon the Serene. Simon of Serene. &gt;&gt; He had an opportunity to carry a cross. &gt;&gt; He would have never had that opportunity if the sun hadn't been shining. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the scripture to be rejected. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And soldiers casting lots for his garment. Let us not ren it but cast lots for it. &gt;&gt; Whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled? Yes. &gt;&gt; That the light might shine. &gt;&gt; We have to do this because this is causing the light is causing us to do this. &gt;&gt; Oh friends. &gt;&gt; And they parted my raignment among them. And for my vesture did they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did that the scripture might be fulfilled. Right? &gt;&gt; I'm giving you this variety &gt;&gt; because there's a host of things &gt;&gt; that will take place in your day, &gt;&gt; in my day, &gt;&gt; in this season, &gt;&gt; and you have to make the discernment &gt;&gt; whether it's light or darkness. &gt;&gt; And if it's darkness, it has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; Absolutely nothing. &gt;&gt; People say to me, "Have you heard this? Have you heard that?" No, I said, "I haven't heard it. I feel like an ignoramis. Did you read this? No, I haven't read it. &gt;&gt; Why should I? &gt;&gt; It It's not of my kingdom. &gt;&gt; It's not of my It's not of my realm. &gt;&gt; It has no interest whatsoever. &gt;&gt; I haven't hardly got enough time to read the scripture. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Don't forget this Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Don't just say amen and nod to it. &gt;&gt; You go home and practice it. Because I can tell you there's spirits with that stuff. &gt;&gt; And they are spirits of darkness. &gt;&gt; They're spirits of heaviness. &gt;&gt; They want to they want to fasten themselves. &gt;&gt; And once you hear something, &gt;&gt; sometimes a moment later, you're sorry you ever heard it. The harvest son. &gt;&gt; It was the harvest son. Don't forget that also shone upon Peter even though he denied even though he wept bitterly &gt;&gt; at just the view of the Lord. Even though it is weak moment and we do things often that we may be very ashamed of &gt;&gt; he wasn't the only one that wept. &gt;&gt; Judas wept &gt;&gt; bitterly &gt;&gt; but found no no no repentance. &gt;&gt; He the prophet said he didn't expect it to go that far. &gt;&gt; So I don't want nothing to do with this. &gt;&gt; Say I'm sorry I put that website up. No, &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to do with that. &gt;&gt; They'll say exactly the same spirit that was on the leaders. Then we'll be on the leaders today. Say that has nothing to do with us. &gt;&gt; You say whatever you say, take whatever stand you want to say, blasphe, do whatever, but it come back and repent. It has nothing to do with us. &gt;&gt; And it had nothing to do with them. And Judas did not find it. He was repenting to the wrong people to begin with. Repentance is very specific and repentance furthermore is a gift of God. &gt;&gt; It's the goodness of God. And sometimes because I'm so so I cut so accurately to the scripture, people sometimes feel it's it's kind of overboard. No, it's not. If anything, it's probably less than it ought to be. &gt;&gt; But the scripture says uh it it says if somebody did you wrong. No, it doesn't say that. &gt;&gt; The scripture says it's the goodness of God that bringeth a man to repentance. &gt;&gt; That's the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; And godly sorrow &gt;&gt; workketh repentance. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've had people come over to my house and said, "Well, if I did anything wrong," I said, "Why'd you come here? I mean, you know, not if you did. &gt;&gt; Did you &gt;&gt; or didn't you? &gt;&gt; Did you say it or didn't you say it?" &gt;&gt; Then you find people start mumbling around. Well, well, maybe I Well, you know, I I I'm not interested in that kind of thing. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in the truth. &gt;&gt; Says godly sorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And it wasn't in Judah's case, it wasn't godly sorrow. And don't forget also that after the body is long gone, the spirits still around. &gt;&gt; Those spirits don't die. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The spoken word is the light of the hour. Now, I'm coming down, moving down into our time. Come on. &gt;&gt; So don't forget that also the shining of the light that had to shine for Peter. &gt;&gt; Peter had to experience what he experienced. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It had to shine for John &gt;&gt; being fulfilled. He had to resurrect. You might think this is Easter. No, we're past Easter. But there's another resurrection &gt;&gt; and we want you to know about that. had to shine for James and Andrew and Thomas. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to say to Thomas, "Stretch forth thy hand &gt;&gt; and feel the prince." &gt;&gt; Thrust your finger into the prince. He had to experience that &gt;&gt; cuz the sun was shining &gt;&gt; to eliminate any doubt &gt;&gt; to invalidate it &gt;&gt; and remove it permanently from him. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what friends, some of us need something more than we have yet. &gt;&gt; Even in this message, we need something more. You might say, "Well, that's almost like fanatical." Well, it perhaps has to go there and maybe even further. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be left. &gt;&gt; Hearing what you've heard and preaching that has been preached and you don't want to be standing on the sidelines. &gt;&gt; You want to become I believe that this congregation and all who hear my voice even after this service or I I trust from the preaching of the brethren the kind of services that I've heard. I heard brother John Andy's the other night as a masterpiece of a service and it was really up to-date. &gt;&gt; You especially to the young people, you want to take and absorb those things. &gt;&gt; Don't go out like this is some school class and you just wait for the next one. Not that &gt;&gt; you want to absorb these things. &gt;&gt; And so Thomas needed that. The other disciples needed it. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary Mary Magdalene who maybe you wouldn't want as a neighbor who had seven devils cast out of her. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what friends, I'm so humbled &gt;&gt; at the mercy and the longsuffering and the greatness &gt;&gt; of our Lord Jesus Christ. He even in his death and resurrection &gt;&gt; shawn to fulfill the scriptures in such a way that Mary Mary Magdalene mentioned twice at least and and the other Mary &gt;&gt; coming to the tomb and finding it unsealed. They had to have that. &gt;&gt; They weren't part of darkness. They were part of light. But they needed that experience. &gt;&gt; And children of light, the scripture says you're the children of the light. How come your children are light? Because you believed. You have to believe the manifested word of God, &gt;&gt; the vindicated word of God. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be deathbed earnest. I don't understand everything. &gt;&gt; How how's this going to happen? Or how's that going to happen? Or why did the prophet say that? I don't know why he said that. &gt;&gt; I know one thing that I've seen too much vindication to deny that. [Applause] And those that want to question, they don't want to even look at the vindication. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they're they're nice people. &gt;&gt; They're good people. He said something just &gt;&gt; something just seems to come over them. They they want to take it, but they can't take it. &gt;&gt; They want to live it, but they can't live it. &gt;&gt; I may have that a little later on. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand if the message is little uh chopped up. Cleopus had to have Cleopus had to have his his time of such terrible sorrow and and and disappointment. He had to have this his friend with him. They had to walk. Otherwise, listen to this. Those two men back there, those brothers back there, they had to have that. And they only had that by the sunshining in resurrection power. Now, &gt;&gt; it was fulfilled. It was fulfilled. It was fulfilled. That it might be fulfilled. That it might be fulfilled. Every time you hear that, you just got to think the sun is shining stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger. &gt;&gt; Not shining for the weed, shining for the weak. &gt;&gt; There's a life there. And I'm preaching today because I believe there's a life there &gt;&gt; that's greater than all of the conflicts and the darkness of this world. I don't care anything about the darkness. People will have to do what they have to do. Family will have to do what they have to do. Unbelievers will have to do what they have to do. And it's the sun that's shining &gt;&gt; that's causing the darkness &gt;&gt; to congregate &gt;&gt; to congregate. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely bizarre. I mean I find it absolutely almost almost uh unbelievable who joins together. People joined together have absolutely nothing in common. in fact is they bitterly oppose one another, but they will join forces against this word. &gt;&gt; Isn't it amazing? They don't join forces against some of the dark godless &gt;&gt; countries and and and people that don't even believe in God, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Why don't they take up to talk about that? &gt;&gt; Talk about a godly life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; A flawless life, a pristine life. Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; The only way in the message shalom, the only way as God was, Jesus Christ was the manifestation of God's spoken word, &gt;&gt; the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Glory. &gt;&gt; There's a man who can turn on the light. He says, "Now great light the Gentiles who sat in the regions of the shadows of death. Great life, &gt;&gt; great light sprung up among them &gt;&gt; in Zabilon and Nephilim sir &gt;&gt; by the way of Galilee of the Gentiles. Great light. They saw a great light. &gt;&gt; I'm a Gentile and I'm so glad I saw a great light. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that the light came across my way." And what happened in the darkness? It congregated and fled someplace. &gt;&gt; Jesus moved steadfastly to Calvary &gt;&gt; and to the transition from son of man. Now, here for some of you that perhaps are visiting or some that are uh on the internet and have not heard, I want to I want to have you have a paradigm shift. The account of the crucifixion, the account of the crucifixion and the death and the burial of Jesus Christ and the resurrection that's so fixed in the minds of Christianity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; As being that's what it was. We have Easter and so on so forth. &gt;&gt; That was even much more than just the death. That was a transition &gt;&gt; from mortal to immortality [Applause] &gt;&gt; to lay out a pattern &gt;&gt; for the believers &gt;&gt; that this is how it happens. And then when a prophet comes in the end time, &gt;&gt; his second last message, &gt;&gt; just as he's getting ready those lips to be sealed, &gt;&gt; the second last message, &gt;&gt; he goes to that Luke. Now, many of you have heard me say this, but it not enough times. He goes back to Luke 24. If it was enough times, you'd go and read and study Luke 24 carefully. and Luke 24 and he says modern event not historical event &gt;&gt; modern event &gt;&gt; this is going to be a modern happening &gt;&gt; modern event made clear why made clear because it's not clear &gt;&gt; by the prophecy [Music] &gt;&gt; it's a prophecy &gt;&gt; you'll have the same circumstances the same thing happening what will be happening the sun will shine again &gt;&gt; and there will be a time of rapid fulfillment of scripture. &gt;&gt; There will come an end time when the scripture starts being fulfilled so fast &gt;&gt; that there will be a bewildered people. &gt;&gt; There might be a disappointed people. There might be a people who say what what's all this darkness of all the all this government and all the institutions and all these organizations against us and and all these in all these things happening and people who were our friends and people who are believers and or we thought they were believers. We don't know. And then we'll finally find out the sun shining will determine who's a believer, who's not a believer. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the sun shining will cause the darkness to congregate. &gt;&gt; The sun being spoken for the sun the s o the s u n is the result of the spoken word of god. And when the sun begin to shine darkness was pressed to the other side of the world. &gt;&gt; And when the sun arises in your life darkness went. &gt;&gt; How many can say that happened in your case? Darkness went. &gt;&gt; I can raise both hands. &gt;&gt; Darkness went &gt;&gt; when the sun shone. &gt;&gt; When the son of righteousness arose &gt;&gt; in your personal life, &gt;&gt; the darkness was banished &gt;&gt; and went to the other side. &gt;&gt; You can't even find it. And in this age, &gt;&gt; in the harvest time, &gt;&gt; and this is the harvest time. Why is it the harvest time? Because the scriptures are being fulfilled and in the message uh there's a not there's a man who can the flashing light of his coming. I believe was the flashing light of his coming and they were and the people and he says what was all that movement? What was all that noise down there? What was all the noise when they saw this light? What was all the noise? because it was the scriptures being fulfilled &gt;&gt; and that's what's caused the stir. What's caused a stir? Even in this congregation, people are discovering scripture in their time is being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That's their scripture. &gt;&gt; And when you realize that scripture speaks of me, then you can say my light has come. That's my light &gt;&gt; that came to give me make me alive &gt;&gt; in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Young men, this isn't just a sermon. This is for you &gt;&gt; young ladies. This is for you. &gt;&gt; This congregation is for you. &gt;&gt; When you see that the word of God has come and made alive in your heart and you can say, "That's my light &gt;&gt; that came to give me life. And that light is shining to press the darkness back. &gt;&gt; I don't need to participate in darkness. What's all this nonsense about? I don't have any part of it. It has no part of me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The intense harvest son. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Incidentally, that is the title of my message. &gt;&gt; The season of the harvest son. &gt;&gt; The intense harvest son brought all a ll the seeds to their maturity. Whether it be a Caiaphas, as I said, or a Herod or a Judas. And the Bible, your Bible says that Caiaphas and or rather Pilate and Herod had been enemies up to that time. &gt;&gt; They even found their friendship. &gt;&gt; They could find they found that they had a common a common cause. &gt;&gt; And they joined together. Think of that &gt;&gt; enemies. And that'll be a game. &gt;&gt; And it is even now &gt;&gt; when people have absolutely no agreement with one another, but they will agree on one point that we're opposed to this word. &gt;&gt; And I say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; That's the greatest evidence of the truth. &gt;&gt; They always did it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, hold in your heart and hold in your mind this transition from one office to another &gt;&gt; because there's a multitude of people serving a historical Jesus that doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; He's not someone walking in the sands on the shores of Galilee &gt;&gt; with the flowers touching his feet. That's just &gt;&gt; some emotional &gt;&gt; who knows what &gt;&gt; whimper weepy nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He came first as a prophet and they crucified him. &gt;&gt; His own crucified him. &gt;&gt; He came as the son of man. &gt;&gt; The son of man. &gt;&gt; The fourth man in the fire. &gt;&gt; He was before that. Then after the Holy Spirit came, he was then the son of God. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; He was the Holy Spirit, son of God. &gt;&gt; He lived through the church ages. &gt;&gt; As the son of God &gt;&gt; and in the millennium, &gt;&gt; he'll be son of David &gt;&gt; sitting upon the throne of his father David. &gt;&gt; He is the son of David. &gt;&gt; And remember between &gt;&gt; the son of God. and remember. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's going to be people that would be after this that would hear this and read this and he's saying and remember &gt;&gt; between &gt;&gt; the son of God &gt;&gt; in the Leodysian church age &gt;&gt; they put him out &gt;&gt; and Luke see now you may think this is a little overboard but I don't think you will. They put him out. That is why they had to close all the doors on William Brandham. &gt;&gt; I perhaps haven't told this church maybe once or twice, but when I'm away in the conventions quite often I do, and I did in Switzerland just a few days ago, and brother Brandham told me that he was off the he was in a side room at a Christian Businessman International convention. He was the speaker. They would use his name to get crowds. &gt;&gt; So, they have a big crowd. They go on with their singing and they go on with how how God made them rich and how much money they're giving and all the things that they're doing and and and he's sitting there waiting to come to the platform. The doors open. He's looking right at the man at the at the podium. And the man at the podium says, "I'm very sorry, ladies and gentlemen, to announce tonight that Brother William Brandham's not able to be with us. He'd been called to the bedside of his either sick brother or somebody. Brother Brham was sitting there looking at him. Billy Paul said to me, I he said, "I can tell you the man's name." And I'm stunned. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was telling me this and I said to Brother Brandon, I said, "Brother Brand, because this is what I would have done." I said, "Why didn't you walk out on the platform? &gt;&gt; Why didn't you just walk out on the platform and say, "Hi, folks. Now you know what he is." &gt;&gt; And when I said that, he said, "Oh," he put his head back. He said, "Oh," he said, "I could never do that." &gt;&gt; And right away, I said to myself, "That's why I'm not a prophet. I could do that and and and and probably a lot of you folks would too. &gt;&gt; You'd come jumping out and said, "No, I'm I'm here." He wouldn't put them in bad light. Said, "I couldn't do that." That kind of a person. And yet yet they can find no squeeze around to find some thing. And remember between and in the Leodysian church age they put him out. And in Luke he said he would be revealed again. In Luke 17:30 he would be revealed again as a son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it. Listen friends this is what this messenger left. &gt;&gt; He left not so he not for somebody to build some organization on &gt;&gt; but it is that because there were things that were spoken that would pertain to days ahead. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are in those days. &gt;&gt; We're in these times. &gt;&gt; And and and I can understand amongst believers saying, "Oh, it's going to be this way or it's going to be this way. It's going to be that way." That's fine that, you know, I I don't know. I I would take a hard look at it and and see how it's going to be because Jesus said all kinds of things they didn't understand. What could be difficult about saying, "Uh, the son of man is going to be killed, going to be crucified, and after three days he'll raise again." &gt;&gt; And they were saddened by it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he'll be revealed again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they said the scriptures tie perfectly together. Son of man, son of God, son of David. What was it? &gt;&gt; It's the same God &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; Just changing his form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Morphe, he just changed it. &gt;&gt; It's a great drama to him. He's acting it out. And so now I want to take the entire crucifixion and resurrection scene &gt;&gt; and say to you it's changing its form. &gt;&gt; That's really what's happening. &gt;&gt; Did he change his form? &gt;&gt; He went in a bleeding. &gt;&gt; He stood and he stood out and talked to Mary. &gt;&gt; He went in mutilated. &gt;&gt; But now he's in a different form. &gt;&gt; And in that form it's it's it's it's hazy. &gt;&gt; Yes. It's not clear. &gt;&gt; Uh he said things but we we don't understand it &gt;&gt; and now he looks like the gardener. Sir, where did you take him and that I may go to him and they're talking to him. &gt;&gt; He changed his form &gt;&gt; and all these things happen. You've got at because the sun is shining so strong. You have believers and they don't quite understand perfectly everything that's happen but they're believers. Wherever he took him, I'll go to him. &gt;&gt; Where there was spices, he didn't need the spices, but but he knew what was in their heart. &gt;&gt; They were believers. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. This one was cast out seven demons out of her, but she was free. &gt;&gt; Mary Magdalene &gt;&gt; and the other Mary &gt;&gt; and the other women that were there, they were believers. The sun had to shine on them. They had to see the resurrection had happened. They couldn't understand the resurrection. We don't understand it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand everything. You have to believe it. &gt;&gt; You have to believe what you can't understand. &gt;&gt; We're not here interested in anybody's opinion because your opinion is going to be wrong. What if it's wrong? What if I put my faith in your opinion and it doesn't happen? You say, "Well, well, I'm sorry." No, that's not good enough. God's not going to say, "I'm sorry." He doesn't have to say that. He just says things and we believe it and we just go on and move and say, "Father, I'm not too sure what's happening, but I'm a believer." &gt;&gt; And I know one thing that this was your vindication. No man could do these things. &gt;&gt; And that's what was in John's gospel &gt;&gt; when when Nicodemus came to Jesus. &gt;&gt; No man can do these things. We know you're of God. [Applause] [Music] He was a leader. &gt;&gt; Dramatic events take place &gt;&gt; at the change of form because it's also a change of administration. &gt;&gt; It's a change of order. &gt;&gt; And in this time, friends, you're all it's a mixed audience here. But let me tell you something. that many of you know and I just want to say it to impress myself even further. This is a different season. &gt;&gt; Jesus is not coming in flesh as a lad. &gt;&gt; And don't forget that these process sometimes things people think oh they just happen you know bang and it's all over. No, no. Jesus, his first coming, the season of that son began to come, began to happen when John the Baptist was conceived. &gt;&gt; And then maybe nine months later, he was born. &gt;&gt; And during that time, Jesus is conceived. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, the Messiah is on the road. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't deny that. The Messiah is on. &gt;&gt; We can say Jesus is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he was born, we can say Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt call his name Jesus &gt;&gt; for he'll he'll he'll save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; Who is it that was born? Jesus was born. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Messiah was born. &gt;&gt; 30 years later, during that time, John the Baptist has his head cut off. Right. &gt;&gt; What a record. &gt;&gt; The great the great the one to forun the one that Isaiah prophesied about. He's got his head cut off. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. That must have been for a just cause. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah. Was that a great spiritual cause? Well, a little girl danced. &gt;&gt; Oh, must be something wrong with that. Maybe he wasn't the person we believed he was. Maybe he wasn't the spirit of Elijah. &gt;&gt; Well, that's a that that's what Zachchariah said. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but you know, he's just a priest anyway. &gt;&gt; Is there any reason to doubt? Well, yeah, we have a lot of reason to doubt. Was there anybody recorded it? No. Well, nobody really recorded it. &gt;&gt; Oh, well then, you know, &gt;&gt; then it puts doubt, cast doubt on any everything. Then I'd turn around and say, "Well, who are you?" &gt;&gt; What What's your vindication? &gt;&gt; I h I have a prophet. And you got you got something problem with something that he said. I happen to be I happen to be with the man who works for a mining company. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I was introduced to him by brother Ernest Phil Fulture. &gt;&gt; Yes. and and I was introduced to this man and I heard that he had uh he'd been to brother Ernest Fulture took him to one of William Brown's meetings. He never knew the man, never saw the man, never heard the name before and they go and find out where he's having a meeting and go into the meeting and he's just sitting in the congregation. He's waiting right now for an operation. At that time he was waiting for an operation because the the mining company he worked for had discovered a big tumor the size of a man's fist in his left lung and they they sent him to three hospitals around at Bristol in Tennessee Bristol and Kingsport and another one because they wanted to find out what is the degree of their uh liability to this man who's now been not given too long limit. And that hospital said, "You got to have that out within within the next month. We got to take that out. We're going to book a hospital for you right away." And he said, "Well, just hold off." And and his pastor, who was his pastor then, Reverend Ernest Fulture, drove him to Brother Brandham's meetings. He's sitting in the service and brother Brandham says these words. I'm kind of ahead of myself, but that's all right, I suppose. And if you want to hear it, we have it we have it uh on a disc. And he said, "Let the God that wrote the word, if he is God, &gt;&gt; let him come." Now, uh I I thought I just I I know that now I'm going to come across it when I Anyway, I'll I'll come across it and I'll read it for you if we have time. And he says, "Let the God that wrote the word, if he is God, let him come now &gt;&gt; and show himself or prove that he's God. &gt;&gt; The God that wrote the word, &gt;&gt; let him come now." &gt;&gt; And he and he stands and he says, "There's a man in big audience." He said, "There's a man out here." And he calls out a minister. And he said, "You you've got a bad throat and you're under pressure because you have to get out of here because you have some appointments. Reverend Smith, go your way. And then he says, "Now this other man," he said, "and you have you've been examined. You have a tumor and it's in your left lung and you're up for an operation right away." He said, "You have been a mine worker." &gt;&gt; And the reason why he said, "I have been a mind worker." He never went back to be a mind worker. He became a pastor. and he pastored for many years in Virginia. And uh he said, "You have been a mine worker and you're up for an operation right away." And he says, "Mr. Mitchell, go home to Virginia &gt;&gt; and be well." &gt;&gt; And he went right back to the same hospitals where he had to have this operation. And they took it. They took another X-ray and could not find the tumor. It was not there. And he and he and he lived many years. I know him very well. And we went right to went right went right to the uh uh uh the Ron Oak television studio. They charged us $120. Never forget it. And it was the best best 120 we ever spent. And we had an engineer and cameraman and all the rest of it and told the story. And when we're done, one of the men, one of the directors come down. He's already crying. He said, "My" He said, 'I want you to pray for my brother. He's got cancer. And another another the director came down and he said, he said, 'You know what? He said, I can't believe I can't believe he said, you men sat here and we did 20 minutes, over 20 minutes without stopping the cameras once. He said that only took us 20 minutes. He said, I had the governor of the state here doing a 4-minute advertisement and took us a half a day. But he said the difference is you fellas are telling the truth. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Those are his words &gt;&gt; and we were telling the truth and you can still hear it and it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; And the one who spoke it through the messenger &gt;&gt; is still the truth. &gt;&gt; It's the fourth man in the fire. The fourth man in the fire stood for brother Mitchell &gt;&gt; between him and the flames &gt;&gt; and him and this killer and him between him and this demon and delivered him. We're not just talking about a God now. Now we're talking about a God changing his form. &gt;&gt; And in this end time, this is where it has to shine. This is where these scriptures, these fulfillment, that's where the intensity &gt;&gt; we talk about Luke 17:30, but no, no, in the revealing of the son of man, there was a lot of scriptures that had to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Please let me carry on. And the reason I'm being so precise is I I do not want to leave anything out if too possible in the message convinced and concerned. Then two men, brother Brown calls it an oral Roberts and a Tom and a Billy Graham and went down and preached to Sodom to Lot. That was a nominal sleeping virgin, a representation of it. And they preached repentance and never done that much of a miracle. They blinded the people. Of course, preaching of the gospel blinds the unbeliever. And the greatest news flash, they had they had their messengers and their eyes were blinded to the door. &gt;&gt; But the elected group saw God manifested in the flesh. Isn't that the most incredible thing? The elected group because one of the messengers stayed back with Abraham. &gt;&gt; One of the messengers turned his back, which we have seen happen, and you have had it on record many times as well. But the elected received God in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Is that too strong?" &gt;&gt; You have to be deity in flesh. &gt;&gt; Did not Jesus is Jesus deity? You say, "Well, yes, he's deity." Jesus said, "I will be in you." &gt;&gt; How's that? &gt;&gt; I will be in you. &gt;&gt; You will be in me. &gt;&gt; I will be in the Father. Is that so? &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture says? &gt;&gt; It's time to believe it. People say, "Well, I haven't got I I didn't get anything. I don't get it." Maybe you maybe your believing needs to increase. &gt;&gt; Maybe the son &gt;&gt; and the revealed word &gt;&gt; has to take a hold in your life &gt;&gt; and you'll start seeing God do things. You know, we're of the we're the kind of people, well, you have to try it out and test it and prove it and all these things and finally come to a general consensus and this one found it. So, that one found it so. I like what our brother Steven, brother Steven, you're sitting right here. He he just got introduced to the message. He doesn't know volumes of what the message perhaps doesn't know volumes of the scripture. But when he found out God sent a proven vindicated messenger, a prophet, &gt;&gt; he just said, "I don't care whether they agreed with it. I don't care whether they could prove it or not." The prophet said it and that was enough. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we we people, civilized and cultured people, we need to understand what a prophet is. &gt;&gt; You need to go into the Bible and find out what a prophet is. instead of having a bunch of scarecrows. &gt;&gt; There's false prophets. There's all kinds of them &gt;&gt; because I have no no proof whatsoever. &gt;&gt; I have a very very dear lovely friend, a Catholic friend. We're very close. In fact, as I saw him for the first time in many many years just a week or two ago, we were listening to a tape. I was listening to he was in my car and we're riding in my car and I had on one of brother Bham's tapes and he comes to the discerning of the people and and telling the secret of their heart one after the other after the other and I said call him by name. I said did you ever have a pope do that? &gt;&gt; I just said very lovingly, very respectfully, &gt;&gt; have you ever had a pope do that? He looked down. And he just thought for a moment. He said, "No, I don't think so. I wanted that to speak to him." &gt;&gt; You call a man a holy father &gt;&gt; and all kinds of Protestants aren't even troubled with that. &gt;&gt; They talk about the immaculate conception &gt;&gt; of Mary and all kinds of absolute blasphemous stuff. &gt;&gt; And no, nobody's in an uproar over it. But when I talk about William Brham, &gt;&gt; who had all this vindication, &gt;&gt; year after year, meeting after meeting, I've been in I've been in over 30 services myself, over 30 meetings, and just saw it again and again and again. I said, "How can anybody?" &gt;&gt; Nobody with a seventh grade education out of Kentucky ever could even begin to do this. &gt;&gt; And he would even even ask the ministers behind him, would you like to do that? Now, after he told a prophet can't say something that's not so or not true, I'm off on on another subject. But I'll tell you what, friends, I was convinced. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad you're convinced. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They had their messengers. And then this day is the scripture fulfilled. He says it, and here here's where it is. If you preach anything and here's what h exactly what happened and you can hear it this day is the scripture fulfilled. If you preach anything and it's the gospel truth then God is obligated to vindicate it vindicate that. Is that true? Now if that be so let the God that wrote the word, let the God that made the prophecy, let the God who is God of the word come forth and prove that he is still God. &gt;&gt; How's that? &gt;&gt; That sounds good, doesn't it? And a few lines later, a little just a little bit later, he says, "There is a man sitting right back here. He is suffering. He's got a tumor on his left lung. He isn't from here. You have been a mine worker. That is right. I'm a total stranger to you. If that's right, shake your hand. The tumor is in your left lung." If you like to see it, get the DVD from the office. The tumor is on your left lung and you're up for an operation right away. That's right. You're not from here. You're from out of town. You're from Virginia. That's right. You believe God knows who you are, Mr. Mitchell. That's right. Go home and be well. Jesus Christ makes you whole. Ask the man. Never seen him in my life. He was sitting there praying. This day, this scripture &gt;&gt; is fulfilled. What kind of intelligence would want me or you to put that aside &gt;&gt; and say, "Well, we're going to tinker with something else. &gt;&gt; We're going to listen to somebody who hasn't got one scratch of vindication, not one ounce of vindication. And we're going to take time and take it into our brain and listen to that." No. Why are these things happening? Or why what what kind of season are we in? This is a this is a time when everybody has a right to say something. Well, because of the season that we're in. That's that's the reason for it. Everybody should be heard. And the whole thing becomes a community, a community thing. &gt;&gt; The Lord God identifying, vindicating his word and showing that's exactly and never let nothing be said unless it comes to pass perfectly. Now he's describing and now uh think of the word mixtury &gt;&gt; and people sit and look at that and continue right on in their same condition and they're good people. &gt;&gt; They're fine people. &gt;&gt; But yet it seems like that they can't understand. Look like they can't get it. He asked why. He said, "Here's a sister once had lovely long hair and she cut her off. Here's a man that once looked like looked like he took a stand and went out for the thing that was right. He's right back in it." He said, "Like a dog to its vomit, &gt;&gt; a a hog to its wallow." He say, "Well, that's strong." Well, that's a scripture. &gt;&gt; He's just saying what's written in the scripture. This what's happening &gt;&gt; and people hear it and they look at it and they're fine people. They're good people. He said they're sociable people. You like to have them. You like to talk to them, but it seems they can't take it. &gt;&gt; It seems that they can't. They want to, but they can't. And he talks about sisters and caught in the web of fashion. &gt;&gt; Listen, young ladies, caught in the web of fashion. &gt;&gt; I'll read it for you. &gt;&gt; And he says that and he feels so sorry for them. He said, "I feel sorry for them." &gt;&gt; He said, "They're such nice people and they seem to be caught in this web. and and I feel so sorry for them. And so he says, and here's a sister and here's a man. And he says, uh, yeah, I I says, it seems like there's something that has struck our people. It struck the world that they don't seem to have the understanding there's something wrong. And the preaching of the gospel, if it's not received, blinds the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; See, listen. Now, we're down where the rubber hits the road, folks. Uh, I'll be glad, of course, when the service is over because I just have to I have to say some things that they're they're not hard, but they're I believe that they're true. &gt;&gt; There there's something people come in, they're baptized, they want to, &gt;&gt; they see the light, &gt;&gt; and they're influenced &gt;&gt; somehow. And there's a mixture. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through family. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through education. &gt;&gt; People sell out to it. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through business. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the mixtury comes through opportunity. Now, just so you don't think I'm going overboard, I'm going to talk about a man. He wasn't next to William Brandham. He wasn't next to Jeremiah or Isaiah. He was next to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He was his right-and man. &gt;&gt; He was involved. He was there when they sent him out. &gt;&gt; He was there when when they fed the people. He He saw the bread multiply &gt;&gt; and the fishes, cooked fishes, he saw it happen. &gt;&gt; He was right next to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. And uh and then when the light began to get shine in its intensity, harvest light, he was in all of that light, &gt;&gt; but now the light is shining and the word is fulfilled, fulfilled, fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And he hears the light say, "One of you will betray me." &gt;&gt; And good believers are saying, "Is it me, Brother Tom? Is it me, Brother John? Is it me? Is it me, Brother Tim? Who who is this? Put everybody under a a shadow of question and they're asking one another. And and Judah said, "Is it me?" And Jesus, the light said, "Thou sayest." &gt;&gt; And the others are others are saying, "Who's now? How did all this happen? &gt;&gt; We we've had Passover for 30 years. We've had Passover for 30 years. &gt;&gt; How did this This was a little different because he took a towel this time and washed our feet. &gt;&gt; How How did this happen? &gt;&gt; The sun was shining, folks. &gt;&gt; It wasn't, "Oh, I feel the glory." No, no, &gt;&gt; no. the sunshining sometimes can cause very different an examination inside &gt;&gt; where do I stand and oh I don't want to be that and and finally Peter says though I die with you um I won't surrender Jesus said well before this is over &gt;&gt; before all this before the intensity of this son you're going to deny me three times You know, it's amazing. Jesus didn't have to preach a big hard sermon and get them to repent. All Jesus had to do was just &gt;&gt; look over at him. &gt;&gt; When those two eyes caught, &gt;&gt; the sun was shining. &gt;&gt; But what's it do for Peter? &gt;&gt; It put more life into the wheat. &gt;&gt; He went out and wept bitterly and repented. That's what the sunlight, that's what the fulfillment does to wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And finally, the prophet in this age says, "The wheat &gt;&gt; has come back to wheat again." &gt;&gt; He knew what it was. &gt;&gt; The wheat's come back to wheat again. &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, &gt;&gt; praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, believers, I'm so glad that you're here. &gt;&gt; And when I shake your hand and say, "I'm glad that you're here. Glad to hear it. I I I just want you to be under the effect of what is happening. And and the word is at opening up. And we need it. We need we need this sunshine. &gt;&gt; We need this light. This isn't some gibberish. &gt;&gt; This isn't some light frivolity and frothy stuff. &gt;&gt; We know it's heavy duty. &gt;&gt; And people come and go. &gt;&gt; But we'll keep going. I can't do anything else. &gt;&gt; Just can't do anything else. &gt;&gt; Sometime you're almost, you know, I can't I can't help it. I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. I I just I can't help I can't get rid of it. &gt;&gt; I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what happens. Doesn't matter who comes or who goes or what anybody says or what kind of lie is propagated or somebody says, "Did you see what's on the internet?" And now I haven't got I've got time for the word. I haven't seen what's on it. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You understand where I'm coming from? &gt;&gt; Friends, the darkness is congregating &gt;&gt; because the light is shining. &gt;&gt; And I'm not rejoicing that the darkness congregates. I'm rejoicing that the light is shining. &gt;&gt; The light is my kingdom. &gt;&gt; The word is my That's my world. This world's not my home anyway. &gt;&gt; Now, folks, don't go home and slip back into an old mold or something. If that's been part of your diet, put it away. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And today, the light &gt;&gt; I'm trying to watch my time. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Am I all right for a few more minutes? And today, the light of God is the word of God made manifest. &gt;&gt; And that's the light made manifest. The light is the works of God spoken by the word of God brought to life. And it's a greater light. Listen to this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Everyone's attention. It's a greater light &gt;&gt; than it was at the dawn of creation. &gt;&gt; So, I'm so glad I can go out and get a suntan. Be glad that you got a light that'll take you to another earth, &gt;&gt; another world, &gt;&gt; a new heaven &gt;&gt; and a new earth. &gt;&gt; And the mixture now is between mortal and immortality. &gt;&gt; And that's where we're at. &gt;&gt; That's why he preached this. &gt;&gt; You might say, well, that that's 30, 40, 50 years ago. They could have said that of Jesus when he was crucified. said, "Well, this was, let me see." John talked about him and he was here ministering. He was here living with us 30 years and now ministered 33 30 another three years, three and a half years. And now, now we're on into Pentecost. And Pentecost just started. Let me let me just see here from Pentecost uh according to Scoffield, the book of Acts. And we have Pentecost happening around 33. We have uh we have John or Paul rather being converted about a year later or so. And then towards the end of the book of Acts, that's another about another 30 years. So it's been about 60 years and you're still reading it in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, that was 60 years ago." That doesn't mean anything to God. Talk to God about 60 years. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You understand? We don't understand that dimension. &gt;&gt; We don't understand that timeless place. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't understand a prophet standing at the pull pit. uh this I gave to the people in Switzerland and he says uh now and he talks to he talked to two individuals and I read the quote and he says now you've been to a doctor and and they're consulting together and they want to remove an organ out of your body. Where is he? Tell me. &gt;&gt; I'd like some of the smart people to put websites together. Tell me where he is. Tell me, where is that man standing on the pullpit in front of in front of this man? &gt;&gt; I ask you as a congregation, where is he? &gt;&gt; Oh, he's seeing a dream. No, he's not seeing a dream. He's seeing a vision. He's He calls it a vision. He's actually in another realm. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you now, explain this one. He says, "I'm in two worlds." Amen. &gt;&gt; And what was happening at the crucifixion, please now catch this, &gt;&gt; is the merging of those worlds. &gt;&gt; Here's Jesus Christ in another world. &gt;&gt; Walking in the same dust. &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's some things we need to learn about the resurrection that's going to take place &gt;&gt; because it's not going to be the way most people think. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be the way most people are taught. &gt;&gt; And there he is in another world. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the two worlds are merging. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand what I'm saying. And once again for the first time in history actually have a messenger a prophet messenger standing on the earth in another world in this one and in that one and telling you this person's life that person's life in another world. What they did last week and what they did then and stands here preaching the word and telling us what the serpent did and how he looked 6,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; How come? Well, anybody that can hear a doctor that speaks a a week ago can certainly tell what what Adam said and what Adam did 6,000. What's the difference in eternity with 6,000 years one day or a multi-million years &gt;&gt; and to have that same messenger with that kind of indication? Are you listening to me students? Say what God had in the back part of his mind. That's this. [Music] And when he says my peace, that's why I'm talking to you today. That's why I'm speaking. &gt;&gt; I give you I give you peace. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Who's talking? &gt;&gt; You tell me it's a man. That's fine for you. That that that's what you get. He says to someone standing in front of him, if you think that if you think this is of Satan, that's where your reward will come from. If you think this is of God, that's where a reward will come from. Either come from the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom of light. Make your choice. I say it's God speaking to me. God using the vessel. God speaking. God has said to this people, "Show &gt;&gt; God's peace." &gt;&gt; Not as the world gives it. &gt;&gt; You go out there, you're in a bunch of mystery. &gt;&gt; You don't know if you have it or you do have it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's an age of mystery. &gt;&gt; And the mystery is between the mortal and the immortal because we're moving in that room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I didn't quite want to get there." Well, do you want to go or don't you? &gt;&gt; You want to go to heaven or don't you? &gt;&gt; You want to go into an immortal life. Thank God. Thank God for a messenger that will announce to us. It's a time of mystery, but breaking. He said it's a new day breaking between mortal and immortality. Oh, I want the sun to shine on me. Shine on me. Shine on me. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; From an all, he said sick bound world. All the sickness and the affliction and the trouble and the sickness that is right here in this congregation. The sun is shining, friends. The sun, &gt;&gt; the sun is rising &gt;&gt; with healing in his wings &gt;&gt; for these mortal bodies &gt;&gt; and the sun is is is rising. &gt;&gt; It is. It's not. Is it the rising of the sun? He said it is the rising of the sun. Good morning, bride. &gt;&gt; Shalom, bride. &gt;&gt; God's peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] In this day, the Janice and the Jambers have to come. &gt;&gt; Not because we're going to say, "Oh, this one is that that none of my business." The sun does it all. &gt;&gt; The fulfillment does it all. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm announcing to this congregation, you don't have to do a thing. You don't have to do a thing. &gt;&gt; You just believe. &gt;&gt; Make yourself yielded to the word &gt;&gt; and leave all the rest up to God. &gt;&gt; The son will do it. &gt;&gt; The fulfillment will do it. &gt;&gt; You live the life. &gt;&gt; You live the message. You live the sermon and the son and the fulfillment in you will do the rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that the sun will do. &gt;&gt; And this great darkness that's swinging over the earth now is 58. It's swinging over the earth now is nothing but to declare that the light is pressing its way down. Friends, when you read that when you read this message, you need to read it more than just a book. &gt;&gt; You have to read it with a concept. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is a prophet speaking &gt;&gt; and much of this is from another dimension. When I say much of this, &gt;&gt; because certainly it's a man, &gt;&gt; he might say, you know, I got a flat tire. That isn't thus sayith the Lord. That's thus said the flat tire. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So, I'm tired. You know, I need to have a rest or something. You know, I was with him for many, many days at a time. And we'd rest and talk about things and have be in a restaurant and have lunch and whatever, just talk about. And he said, "I like being with you, brothers." Said, "You treat me like a man. That's what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Place where he could relax and get his mind free. But now he says the light is pressing its way down. He said if death is hanging so close, what is it doing it? It's life like a coming. The resurrection, the Easter for all of God's children is hanging low. It's pressing. The angels are coming down. The Holy Spirit's moving in. Darkness is taking its last toll. &gt;&gt; For light will soon be here. &gt;&gt; Listen to this announcement. Christ will come. The joy and the hope of the ages. A real resurrection for all believers. For we will share with him in his resurrection as we have shared with him in his suffering. Then in 64. Now we've gone from 58 to 64. The hour is upon us. Darkness grows. Darkness grow darkness upon the people. That's what it is. What does it all mean? Where where are we standing? The hour. What hour are we in? How close are we to the coming? Fear not little flock. &gt;&gt; It's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. What does it mean? God has be to separate the light from the darkness. Not the darkness is coming. He said, "Now God's be to separate it, &gt;&gt; pressing it behind &gt;&gt; like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of a new day." That's what's happening. &gt;&gt; And and and the church ages are fading out. God is pressing the darkness into a place. It has to do it to fade out the church organization and fade out the world. You are not. You are not of the world, little children. &gt;&gt; Who's talking &gt;&gt; to me? It's a God's authorized voice. &gt;&gt; You are not of the world, little children. You are of heaven, and this is not your home. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to rejoice over that. &gt;&gt; Not a preacher telling you, &gt;&gt; not just a prophet, not a minister telling you, &gt;&gt; not a musician, not a ortor telling you God speaking. &gt;&gt; You're from heaven. is not your home. And then in further on in that same he said that's him among us &gt;&gt; who not not not the man not the messenger said that that's him among us his word being identified shalom in this congregation we ought to be able to well I'm sure that you can I say to you &gt;&gt; on the basis of this word shalom &gt;&gt; peace go out these doors with peace. &gt;&gt; Peace that passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; Peace in the midst of gross darkness on the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not here to trouble you. &gt;&gt; It's here to bring peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The great day is fixing to break. When the morning breaks eternal bright and fair, when his chosen ones will gather to their home beyond the sky. When the role is called up yonder, I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Our names are on his book. &gt;&gt; Our names are on his book. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You're my friends. &gt;&gt; You come to the congregation. &gt;&gt; You serve God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What more what more blessed thing could we say? Say your name &gt;&gt; is on the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; How are you ever going to be lost with your name on the book? &gt;&gt; Well, if I turn away and if I backslide, you just try to backslide. If you're a wheat and the life has come and the wheat can't become a weed, it can't become a weed. Let's hear it. &gt;&gt; Let's hear it. &gt;&gt; When the role is called up yonder, I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Our name, &gt;&gt; our names are on the book. &gt;&gt; Would you care to say that, please? &gt;&gt; Our names are on the book. &gt;&gt; And say the next one, we'll be there. &gt;&gt; We'll be there. &gt;&gt; We'll be there. &gt;&gt; We'll be there. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Peace to you. Peace unto you. &gt;&gt; The darkness is separating itself &gt;&gt; from the light. &gt;&gt; Not the darkness is pressing down or the darkness is leaving, but the darkness is separating itself from the light. &gt;&gt; That's where you live. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's causing it. &gt;&gt; Shalom. &gt;&gt; God's causing it. &gt;&gt; The lights doing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The light's pressing itself &gt;&gt; in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together. &gt;&gt; The lights doing it. &gt;&gt; Friends, we're in this season. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People hear this messenger's voice &gt;&gt; and it so aggravates and irritates the spirit that's in them. They have to congregate together &gt;&gt; and they don't agree, but they have to congregate together. And God doesn't want any of his children lapping it all up and they say what they say and hear what they said about us or or about me. Who cares? &gt;&gt; Can you picture wheat laying there in all of its beauty? and the shock is pulled away and the weed is standing there in all its beauty and says, "You know what? I feel a little discouraged. Look at this weed over here." What kind of nonsense is that? Well, you know what? I I grew up a wheat and I grew right next to a stingweed. Now, don't get too serious. That's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's what that's the term he used. I didn't have the bravery to use it in in guest meetings, but I thought I could use it at home. &gt;&gt; He said, "The wheat rejoices &gt;&gt; and says hallelujah." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the weed rejoices and says hallelujah." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Anyway, do you believe it? Amen. &gt;&gt; The congregate together. &gt;&gt; They had a chance to accept it and they wouldn't do it. &gt;&gt; So it's condensed itself. &gt;&gt; Darkness can never stand. And I know my redeemer liveth. Can never stand in the presence of light. It cannot do it. Light is 10 million times stronger than darkness. So light and dark cannot dwell together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the end. The wheat has come back to wheat again. The wheat has come back to its grain and the shuck has pulled away from it. And the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened. Oh God, &gt;&gt; let the sun shine on me in all of your intensity. Whether I agree with it, whether it brings hardship, whether it brings a delusionment, whatever, shine on me. Bake the greenness out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. John 1 and5 says in him and this is the message &gt;&gt; which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all &gt;&gt; to you French people to &gt;&gt; that's the end of it there's no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do we love it? Yes, we love it. Do we love him? Yes, we love him. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wonder if we could sing. Brother Ryan, if you could help us or Linda, whoever is playing, Shine on Me, Shine on Me. &gt;&gt; And tonight, friends, Brother Danny Stemon will be here. &gt;&gt; Put the icing on the cake. Brother Danny, God bless you. We've been to Brother Danny's church and his wife, Sister Michelle, is with him. Others of his congregation. Brother Danny's mother is here. &gt;&gt; I'd like her to stand. &gt;&gt; Sitting. No. I'd like if sister Sister Steam, if you could just stand for another moment, please. I just need her to stand. Look how young she looks. &gt;&gt; After raising people like Danny, I tell you what, and the rest of the family, I'm sure she prayed many prayers. Her and her husband, her husband, Brother John, has gone on to be with the Lord, but he pastored, they pastored in uh Sarasota, Florida for many years. This is special special meaning. Brother Danny's daddy and this woman you see standing, sister Steven, sister Diane Stemon was sitting in the house of brother Tom Browns and I was there I and my wife and her husband was not saved yet and he told me I wish you could to meet him is to love him And he says, "I drive I drive past." He knew his wife was in the house. And he said, "I just shake my fist at that house." He was so upset. You know what that is? That's like Paul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Paul was so angry with these believers. So angry. And finally, he became a fanatic of one. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what her husband did. &gt;&gt; Brother John. And we're so happy, Sister Dan, to have you here. God bless you. Thank you for standing. [Music] Why don't we all stand? And could we sing this? Help us out. We give him some power there, please. Oh, shine on me. Let the light of the light shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Sh. [Music] Shine on me. Shine on me. Let the light shine on me. I asked the Lord just simply not knowing how the service was going to go and I asked the Lord to help me to convey one thing to the people and I I prayed that there would be one result at least one main result and that is that all of us all of us would become more fervent &gt;&gt; in everything that we do everything we do more fervent in our conversation with one another more fervent in our prayer more fervent in are singing and worship to God. Let's just be so fervent. What's wrong with being fervent? Let's just be in simple faith and so fervent to God. I'd sooner be that way than any other way. Let's just be so in intent and intense with serving God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing it once again. Shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Let the light [Music] shine on me. Let your heart shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Let the light come on. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord our God, how great thou art. Sing the sing the chorus. and see my soul, my savior to how great. [Music] How great are [Music] my [Music] how great [Music] how great this is amongst his hands. This is him who changes this mask from season to season. This is him who brought us into this transition period and he sent this sign of Messiah, sign of the resurrection for the sheep, for the elected. I hope it means something to you. I have been sent a sign by my father. &gt;&gt; Is it yours? My sign? I've been sent a sign by my father. This a resurrection time. [Music] &gt;&gt; The prophet said a sign point someplace. &gt;&gt; It's just pointing. &gt;&gt; We've been in the transition time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't lose it in the transition time. Don't lose sight of it. God will bring you around to it. And I pray he will use this service. use these words and even if there's one phrase or one quote that hangs in your heart, &gt;&gt; oh God, &gt;&gt; oh Lord my God, how great thou art, &gt;&gt; then sings myior to thee. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] How great are [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to ever lose sight of this. Something just came to my mind while I was singing that. [Music] I said a word while we were speaking. said, "Sometimes darkness can creep in through opportunity. Opportunities are wonderful and we need opportunities." But the Bible says this of Judas. And let me, you know, emphasize to you that spirit is not dead. &gt;&gt; I today have spoke this message in the name of Jesus Christ. I come against that power of darkness. &gt;&gt; That betrayal spirit. I come against it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible and the Bible says this that he went to the Caiaphas. He went to the chief priest's palace and he consulted and talked with some people. And then the Bible says from that time, &gt;&gt; yes sir, &gt;&gt; he sought opportunity &gt;&gt; to betray him. Can you imagine what he must have been like &gt;&gt; when he was with them at the last supper and in his heart he's actually seeking opportunity and opportunity then the opportunity came and everything worked out. Tell you what, all opportunities are not necessarily of God. We want to examine opportunities in this time of mixtury. We want to examine our future in this time of mixtury. &gt;&gt; We want to examine all of these things in this opportunity of mixtury. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; And I don't feel him being, you know, easy or passive &gt;&gt; with these spirits of the world. Kick them out. &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with them. &gt;&gt; Reject them &gt;&gt; completely and fully say, "I'm a I'm a son and daughter of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; uh we've been long this moment and this morning and the people have been so kind and attentive. I pray that you'll bless those, Father, that perhaps some have appointments or whatever more and they've driven long distances. I pray that you will bless them, oh God, and be with them. I ask your blessings upon this congregation. I pray your blessing upon every man and woman that's sat in the audience and has listened, those that have been streaming, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, may your spirit reach out to them. And may each person receive their portion, oh God. We're here, oh Father, not to just hear sermons. That's not the point. We're here, oh God, that we might be introduced to truth that the light may shine even more intensely upon us. Oh God, I pray, Father, you will just deal with each one of us in your own sweet and wonderful way. And we'll thank you. I pray you'll dismiss now the people in Jesus name with your blessings. And may they return tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh God, hear our brother Danny Stemon. The only service he'll be able to preach at this time in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you each one. You're dismissed in Jesus name. We send you with God's blessings. [Music] God bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] very easy. [Music] Just remember [Music] Here [Music] we go. [Music]
