TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the the only limit really is the number of translations that's in that language. We have a desktop version of the message hub. Now, this is a a CD that's taken a snapshot of what's available online. They can log on to that uh website. they could download that message that you submitted within the previous uh let's say 24 48 hours and they could print off that book and have that book in their hand to read and study. Well, the message hub is um u a place where a person can uh that's translated the message can put the message online and then someone elsewhere who wishes to uh read or or uh hear that message. They can then log on onto the internet and download that uh that message. Do you need any special privileges to log on and download? &gt;&gt; No privileges whatsoever. You just you you just log on to the u uh message uh hub uh website and uh you will come to the homepage and it'll list all the languages that the messages are um are available and you click on the language that you desire. It will then take you to uh those messages and you can select whichever one you wish. You uh click on that you can download it and print off a booklet. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So is there any limit to the number of books that I can print with that? &gt;&gt; There's there's no limit whatsoever and uh uh the only limit really is the number of translations that's in that language. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; So in you know in the present uh time we have something like 363 messages in Spanish. Uh we have uh uh 844 English books uh available for printing off the internet. uh we have uh uh 300 and some French uh books as well uh quite a number of of Finnish and and so on. So whatever languages uh that you know you have you can you can print off. &gt;&gt; Great. So let's talk about translators for a moment. Uh, let's say I'm a translator and I I'm working in a particular language and I've got a handful of translations and I want to be able to make those available to other people that speak my language around the world. What's my process? What do I do? Well, the first thing you would do is is uh um you know, if you're working together with a local ministry, you would contact uh uh contact us and uh you could submit the uh the files directly to us or you could have uh a contributor login status and and in that case, you can upload them yourself and then from the upload uh state and then then uh they're uh reviewed and approved and they'll be online probably within 24 hours. So now my translations as a as a translator in some part of the world um my translations are available to anybody anywhere in the world now &gt;&gt; anybody anywhere if if people from your uh country or speaking the language that you're translating into or or or clean you know on the other side of the world they can log on to that uh website they can download that message that you submitted within the previous uh let's say 24 48 hours and they could print off that book and have that book in their hand to read and study. &gt;&gt; To me, that's very exciting. &gt;&gt; That is very exciting. &gt;&gt; That's great. So, now we have how many languages on the website? About 40. &gt;&gt; We have 40 languages represented on the website. And uh the total number of of books available in those 40 languages amount to 3,225 at this time. &gt;&gt; That's fantastic. And in all of the books that are printed around the world, you have different countries that uh are represented by people that come and log onto the website. Are there some statistics that you have on that? Uh the last I checked uh uh over a twoe period, we had uh 706 different cities that uh we had uh uh visits from uh representing uh 85 different countries and in 35 different languages. &gt;&gt; Well, that's fantastic. And the downloads, the total downloads were over 5,000 over the past 2 weeks. Uh, of which, uh, 2,000 were in the Spanish language. &gt;&gt; Tell me a little bit about the desktop version that you have available. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, the problem with, uh, as you know with the internet, it's not available in all places of the world, right? and and a lot of the demand for for books in in different translated languages are in countries where uh internet access and you know it's just not reliable. So what we have set up is print stations in in different uh areas and um we have a desktop version of the message hub. Now, this is a a CD that's taken a snapshot of what's available online at a particular time and then sent to these uh different print stations and then they can uh access the files and print off the books. &gt;&gt; So, they in they in essence are loading the message out directly on their computer &gt;&gt; directly onto their computer. Now we uh on on the desktop version there's 34 different languages uh represented uh because the the only files that are on there are the book files. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great. So we have &gt;&gt; and of course we with that we we don't know the number of books printed from them because we have no access to those stats. So, you know, having in the past 2 weeks those 5,000 uh downloads from the various print stations, uh you know, we're sending out uh 60 different uh uh discs to different locations around the world right now. So, there's a lot of books being printed. &gt;&gt; So, there's a lot to be done. &gt;&gt; There's a lot to be done. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of uploading to be done by yourself and various people that you're in touch with. And there's 6,000 languages in the world. There's 40 available on the hub. There's a lot of work yet to be done. &gt;&gt; There's there's there is a a lot of work. The uh one thing I might mention is on those countries represented uh uh logged on, there was uh the latest stats showed that every country except for just a few in the central part of Asia had somebody log on to the internet to view that site. And that is amazing really. I mean, we're we're virtually covering the whole world. Well, the message hub has only been available for less than a year. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Since uh uh June, I believe, was uh I came on board in in first part of December and uh June, I think, was the uh the beta version of the of the hub. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ken, we certainly look forward to another update and another report and more statistics on where around the world the message hub is being accessed. Well, we're we're uh we've got some exciting things happening and we're looking for uh some more exciting things and and I'll be happy to give an update in the future. Wonderful. Thanks for being with us today. Thank you. All right. God bless you. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God bless you all this evening. Wonder if we could sing number 667.

It's done something in your life and they have this on the verses. We we'll sing some of the verses eventually.

He set me free. Jesus died on Calary for the whole wide world to see. It was a great thing and he did for me. The Lord has brought me through all my soul. And when I did, it didn't turn me away.

Let's just praise him and thank him for what he's done. for so much that you've done for us. Father, we just come to worship you this evening. Glory to your name, Lord. You are great, wonderful savior. We're going to sing, you are great. You do miracles so great. And then I'm going to ask brother Bob Hansen if he'll come and lead us in prayer just after this song. Amen. He's great. He does miracles. So great for each one of us. I was watching this just recently. What the church has done here, put together something was called the Beth Dingwall miracle. I hadn't seen it for 10 years since we had it here. It's a miracle. And if you haven't seen it, you might want to see it again. And Beth's my sister-in-law. And some of that stuff I didn't I didn't remember. I didn't know or just want to praise God for what he's done when he does a miracle. Want to praise him. And there was something in there that she said, I saw myself sitting on a green couch. Maybe some of you remember this. And there was a doctor and he was dressed a certain way and he said certain thing. And then brother Kim on the on the on the video said, "You know that green couch when Beth saw that that green couch wasn't there. They'd remodeled the hotel and when it actually or the hospital and when it actually happened just as she saw it, then it all came to pass. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, that sounds pretty familiar to some stories I've heard. Something that I've heard brother Brandham say it's the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we believe that. &gt;&gt; And if that God isn't here tonight, then what are we doing here? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is real. Then &gt;&gt; he's great. &gt;&gt; He does miracles so great. So let's sing it to him tonight. Oh, you are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. There is no one else like you. You are great. You do miracles so great. There is no one else like you. [Music] There is no one else like you. Oh, you deserve the glory and the honor.

We want to come into his courts with thanksgiving and praise. We have some requests, different folks. They're sick. They're needing salvation. They're needing healing. A man we want to pray for needs to be healed of liver failure as well. Brother Bob [Music] Father, you do miracles so great. Father, as we look upon this audience, we look upon miracles.

All right. And before uh we read the scripture, I'll just allow you to have your seats for a few moments. Oh, there's our brother Joe Riley. God bless you, brother Riley. You know he's up here for his 90th birthday. [Music] Now you stand brother stand up. It's wonderful to be uh a seasoned senior and still have all the mobility to drive or get on planes or whatever more. And uh my wife and I just driving to church night and we were talking about your brother Joe and she looked at me she says she said to me you're a young man. Well I I started doing some mathematics and yes amen. We're all young &gt;&gt; by faith and according to the word we should have the substance &gt;&gt; substance faith. Well, I just want to give you a little bit of a not a report as such, but to just let you know a wee bit of the things that are taking place just now. Uh the uh the message hub, it's just remarkable. Our brother Ken Buckles, uh he has been working very very diligently and loading up the messages as they come in. And uh and uh I just wanted to have these statistics so I could give it to the people in Germany this weekend at their they have their Pentecost convention. Brother Gear Roald has his down in in Beaslesburg and then uh brother deer and brother Pankin and another brother uh the three churches have come together and they will have one just out of doozled where the Lord willing I will be with them. So, we just wanted to let them know uh as of May the 24th, we the books that were available are a total of uh 3,299 books which are available. And then, of course, there's quite a few that are available for MP3 downloading as well. um in the uh Spanish this is in the period of time of May 1 209 to May 24th 209 we just took about three four lang languages uh 4,399 books were printed in uh I mean these are individuals this isn't mass printing 4,399 in the Spanish language Spanish people pulling it down. English 2948, French 285 and uh then uh on down less and less because we have less and less messages and when you realize this has only been known for about a year and some of these countries are just hearing about it right now for the first time and some uh Prince stations have just gone into Ghana and brother DJ was there. Uh some more are going into Tanzania. Brother Barry Coffee just returned from being with brother Zephaniah Peters and uh they had a a a meeting with the different translators. So I just thought I would give you that. And then uh MP3s that were downloaded was over 2500. We're talking about 3 weeks. Uh over the past 30 days, there have been 7,495 visits to the website and 3,140 of those are absolute unique visitors. That is that's a a uh one address. Even if that address was on that that uh computer address, even if that address was on many times, it would only count for one time. uh 3140 absolute unique addresses. Uh there's uh 241 visits per day and the average time that people are staying on is is uh over about five almost 5 and a/4 minutes and the number of page views was over 103,000. So I think that was really remarkable. And here here's what is really outstanding. If you were, brother Ken Buckles was telling me if you saw the entire globe and it it's colored where visits have come from and so on the countries there's only a small round spot in way up in central Asia and China that has not been receiving hits from the hub. And uh of the of the 7,495 visits, they came from 1,14 cities and they came from 107 countries and they used 41 different languages. We're talking about three weeks. I think that's really quite remarkable. I thank the Lord that we're allowed [Music] And we thank God for people that are translating and people who are proofreading and all the many many hours that are going into this and the people here who have worked labored real hard. Brother Kim and brother Darren and brother especially our brother Kent Buckles who has taken over the whole pretty much the administration of it. We're really thankful for that. I got an email yesterday. Uh, brother Murphy just heard from the interior part of China. You remember about, let's say, a week and a half ago. You remember the pictures we showed? We showed the pictures of the brothers and they Well, it's the same brothers now and they're on the move again. And uh, God did some God works in strange ways. There's one of the brothers whose father is not a believer and his father uh has a bit of an alcohol problem. So he was caught driving while he was drunk and he got his sus license suspended for 4 months. So his son who works with brother we and they go out and deliver message books and and and tapes and all the rest of it. He asked, "Well, can you know, can I use your SUV for nice four-wheel drive SUV? Can I use it for 4 months?" Well, what he says, "Well, what can I do?" So, they they gave him the SUV to use, and they they took off right away. And they were way up in the interior, way into the rural area of China to some of the tribal people. And uh and up there there was a brother that wanted to be baptized and when I got there there were six more and he was not baptized yet and he came to the message from the internet and so he thought that the internet was such a tool. So he started using the internet and started reaching these other people with the message and so then they wanted to be baptized. So these brothers that went up there they had to baptize all of them. And I we've got pictures of them, but I just haven't got time tonight to put it all together. And uh and then there was a a a woman from uh from a a a home church, and I don't know whether that's a government church or what it is, but she uh she asked the brothers to come there, and they had left some books there before, and they wanted some more and more contact with the message. And all I can tell you is that uh God knows how to find the elect wherever they are. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; And to think we can sit here and just be a part of it somehow. Be a part of it regardless of how small or how big it is. And all you young people, the senior young people who've been engaged in getting those uh books done off of the tapes so they can be loaded. Uh, it's a marvelous thing. Whatever you do, don't slow down. &gt;&gt; That's good. Sounds Sounds good. Thanks, brother Isaac. Uh, and we have I know that Brother Mark and Sister Debbie already been welcomed, but they've come home at least for a visit. We're pulling on them real hard. and we've got different ways of to do things. Brother Mark said to Debbie, we love you both and so happy that you're here and I trust you have a wonderful time while you're staying here. And take our greetings back to Brother Prader and the and the church there and the saints and your parents, Sister Debbie. We just have so much affection for them. Well, we are going to get right to the word now. And if you'll stand, thank you. That'll be sufficient. And just before we read, I'm going to be reading in the book of Numbers, but we'll have a prayer and then we'll turn to the word of God. Gracious, loving heavenly father. It's just such a wonderful atmosphere this evening, Lord. And we are so conscious and aware of your presence. We're thankful for that, Lord. We pray your blessings, oh God, upon the people that have gathered this evening. We've gathered here, Father, sincerely. We've gathered here seriously. We're here because we want to hear words by the Holy Spirit. Bring it down to the innermost region of our being into our soul. Oh God, I pray that if there is uh those here that may just have a ember burning, I pray that the wind of the Holy Spirit will blow upon those embers and cause it to burst into a flame. Oh God, let it be like fire that he that Jeremiah experienced and had in his bones and he couldn't keep his mouth quiet anymore. He had to speak. Oh God, may the witness of your people go far and wide, I pray. And may the word this evening, Lord, burn in the hearts of the people. Let it burn in my own heart, oh God. And as I pondered and prayed about these things, I pray Lord that you will make it just such a reality to the people this evening. And bless us as we dwell together and rejoice in unity, Father of the Spirit. For when they were in one accord, in one place, that's where the Holy Spirit was so pleased to come. Come, oh God, come and be pleased to be amongst us. Now take control, I pray. Father, may I speak just what you have in mind and the people will receive it. I know in Jesus Christ's name and for his glory alone. Amen. Amen. And all the people said, "Amen." We'll turn to Numbers the 14th chapter and beginning to read at the first verse down to verse 9. And all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried, and the people wept that night. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt? Or would God we had died in this wilderness? And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be prey a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? And they said one to another, let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. And then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jeffona, uh, which were of them that search the land, rent their clothes. And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land. If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and giveth us a land which flowth with milk and honey. Only rebel not ye against the Lord. Neither fear ye the people of the land. For they are bred for us. Their defenses departed from them and the Lord is with us. Fear them not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. Uh I want to move along real quickly and I thank you for your kind attention. Now last Wednesday, brother John Andes was speaking. I believe it was Wednesday or was it Sunday? I lose track of things but and he was speaking from Numbers 13, the 13th chapter and went over into the 14th chapter. Of course, what brother John did not know is that I've been studying and looking to the Lord for perhaps the last three weeks on chapter 14 because I was impressed to speak about a new generation. And so I'm taking a subject tonight so that you can remember uh the content uh a new generation is rising. Uh, and I really I I really do believe that now this place where they were at here is at Kadesh Barnea. And brother John had a very fine map up and to show you for those of you that were here, you'll benefit from having seen the map to see where their wanderings were. And uh then when they uh refused to go into the land which was just a very short distance uh then they h they wandered for uh many years. Actually it is said uh it is thought that uh that they looked upon Kadesh as perhaps a like a headquarters because they spent largely 38 years at uh at Kadesh Barneal before they went in. And I think from the time they came out of Egypt to the time that they arrived at Kadesh was about 13 months. If you look on uh on uh Scoffield uh in his uh he has the the years of the of of the books where and the events that are happening and it shows that it's about a year's time from so the children of Israel spent about a year and I'm not into all the statistics as such but uh and then they spent the rest of their time mostly at at Kadesh Barnea. So Kades Borne is a very very significant uh part of the scripture a very significant part because of the events that took place and the events that took place there have a great deal of importance to us as individuals. Brother Brandham said uh concerning this he said perfect of the church today today in our journeying we're journeying up till I believe that the church is standing today at Kadesh Barnea judgment I hope God will help me to get this it'll sink in good and deep and remember they had come this far because God had promised them and all along the line they had signs and wonders and miracle miracles. Of course, the prophet of God is simply paralleling that with his own ministry. It's right here. It wasn't just back there, but it was right here. And so, they had signs and wonders and miracles, and now they're right up to the borderland. Now, Brother Brand, I'm saying that because the people he was talking to were exactly there. &gt;&gt; They're right at the borderland also. And the reason why he said kades barnea judgment because if they didn't go in it was only death because they don't go in because of unbelief. And I can say to you very few of you perhaps even I knew about brother Brandham and the prophet's ministry and the message uh not very many years ago. And the multitudes that were there and the multitudes that did hear and the multitudes that did see didn't go in &gt;&gt; for the most part did not go in. And so uh so what was it? It was Katie's Barnea judgment is what it was. And where are they today? &gt;&gt; Gone. &gt;&gt; Just gone. The world has swallowed them up. The earth has swallowed them up &gt;&gt; exactly as it was. So there's two things of great significance that results from Kadesh Barnea. I want to follow what I have written down here uh just to lay a good foundation for you. And the first one there's two things and the first one is it was here at Kadesh Barnea that God made a distinction of those that would go in and those that would not go in. &gt;&gt; And he used the term from 20 years old and upward. uh from 20 years old and upward and 20 years old and downward they would they would go in and those are 20 years old and upward uh would not go in. I I I I got thinking the way my mind goes. I was just wondering about the fellow who turned 21 a week before this was said. But anyway, we leave that there. I that'd be kind of unhappy experience, wouldn't it? He just say, &gt;&gt; "Oh, now in the first chapter, uh you won't have to turn to it, but if you care to look at it, it's just uh uh God tells Moses in the first chapter numbers." He tells them to number the children of Israel. And what he tells them to do is take the take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel after their families and by the house of their fathers uh with the number of their names every male by their poles from 20 years old up at 20 years old and upward. All that are able to go forth to war in Israel. Thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. And so this is what happens in numbers the first chapter and this is where the 20-year-old figure comes that where that number comes from. So you'll number all the 12 tribes and you'll you'll uh take a a tally of them all and all the men that are 20 years old and upward who are who are able to go to war. We we want an account of those. And so they were the ones who were given the privilege. I want I want to it's not drafting them into the army because the word of God had given the promise. &gt;&gt; You shall have the land. &gt;&gt; I am giving it to you. And these are the first people that had the honor, &gt;&gt; the privilege of going in and taking it. And listen, you've got a message that you're rejoicing in. You've got a land that you're rejoicing in. You've got benefits that you have and this was offered to people years ago and they turned it down. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; There were others. It's exactly this this instance this those events these events are replicated today. And these people were given the privilege and and given the honor and the commission to go in and there's wonderful benefits. Yes, there's there you're going to have battles, but you're going to have victories. &gt;&gt; And you're going to be led by Joshua. You're going to have uh uh Joshua and Caleb, the two spies that came out, and you'll go in and you'll win this and you'll take possession. They were the first ones given the privilege to have a their portion of the inheritance. And they turned that down. And so when they turned God's promise down, turned God down, then God just said, "Well, now you've said that your children and your wives are just going to be pray for the enemy. Now you will not go in." &gt;&gt; And that's why the 38 years of just uh milling around there because they stayed there till they all died. &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus referred to there, everyone dead. And brother Brandham repeats it dozens of times there everyone dead and this is where it all happened and that's why it was judgment for one but what a blessing for others now it was 20 years old and upward and so the 20 year old so I say a new generation is rising that's my text my title but I want to say very very quickly that I'm not speaking of a new generation as as it was here in a in an age group. I want to speak about a new generation as an experience. What uh what a group is experiencing. You might be you might be 50, you might be 80, you might be uh you might be 10. So it's not an age group. It was here an age group because the the those that had complained and murmured and so on and we'll come to that. God left them to perish in the wilderness. So it said from 20 years old and upward all that are able to go forth to war. So this generation that the generation that was 20 years old and younger, I need to establish this now. Listen very close. They experienced all the things that the older people 20 and above experienced. &gt;&gt; They heard the murmuring. They heard the complaining. They saw the failures. They saw all the things that their parents had had seen. And maybe the they a lot of them weren't parents either. They might have been unmarried, but they were 20 and older. And all of those perished or they they died in the wilderness. So they saw and heard the same things. And that's what's important really important. Now, I really felt I felt on my heart at the beginning of this year that I would seek to invite uh a new generation of ministers and I didn't have any specific plan. I didn't have any it was just in my heart and and there were some ministers that were had taken over churches and they were pastors now and and I thought to invite them and so I'll just bring it to your attention. We've had brother Jason Jackson. We've had brother Danny Stevens. We've had brother Joseph Green. We've had brother uh what was the last one? We've had brother Joseph Green. And uh any anyway, there's one more. And pardon &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Dwayne. Yeah. Right. That that' be number five. So we've actually had about five. And this is just we're just in May. Uh and and and it just so happens that the churches that I'm going to be with in Germany, these are there's two of the pastors that have passed away and younger men have come up and become the pastors of those churches. And uh and the third one is a younger man as well. Brother David Iverson, brother Nathaniel's brother, who's just been ordained into the ministry officially and formally in in Gent. He he knows these brothers and he's very he says we're all kind of peers together and uh and and he just gave me a little bit of insight. Uh he said that you know they're just desiring they didn't have such close unity before but they're just working so close together and they and they have treasured and cherished their unity above little doctrinal differences. &gt;&gt; I say praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, that's exactly what we have right here because we'll get into it. They had all kinds of little reasons for, you know, grumbling and complaining about this. And I'd like to just ask this congregation, when in this world and when in this life and when and what churches are in the world that won't have reason for a complaint &gt;&gt; are you ever going to have that? Never. You even have it in your homes. &gt;&gt; There's always reason you have it in your job. &gt;&gt; So, it's it's it's actually a mindset. &gt;&gt; A person either looks for that or they look away from that &gt;&gt; and they say, "Well, this is part of life. This is what happens." But we go on because we've got our eyes set and fixed on the on the on the goal. &gt;&gt; And I'll say more about that as we come on. So, a a new generation. Why? Why a new generation? Well, for those of you that have a few years under your belt, I can tell you and those that that are younger here, and we have a a very large contingent of young people here, but I'll just tell you something. So, if time should go on for a little while, you'll find out what Brother Bis said tonight is absolutely correct. &gt;&gt; You pick up baggage. And sometimes you wish you didn't pick up baggage, but you do. &gt;&gt; And you accumulate disappointments. &gt;&gt; And you accumulate things that you hear and you wish you didn't hear it. &gt;&gt; And you accumulate little reversals. &gt;&gt; You accumulate these things whether it is from home or from church or from the job or just just out there. That's right. &gt;&gt; You just accumulate it. &gt;&gt; And it and and if you if you meditated and gave your time and your mind and your energy to ponder and chew over that, it'll wear you down. &gt;&gt; It it's it's it's made that way. Satan's planned it that way. So, you become weary with you can become weary with life and you'll pick up baggage. And these people had picked up baggage. Now for whatever reason God ordained it and he said 20 years old and upward and 20 years old and downward they will remain and and there's something about uh young people actually in I'm talking now about age group there's something about young people that have a resilience and uh uh if you get to very very small children you know that they can forgive in an instant &gt;&gt; they can forgive just like that and that is one of The reasons why Jesus said unless you become like that, &gt;&gt; you cannot enter the kingdom of God. You've got to have that kind of purity of spirit that you can you can hear something that can be very offending to you, but somehow you have the capacity to overcome that. &gt;&gt; You you can have somebody offend you, but you have a you have a capacity to forgive them. and not just forgive them, but forget it. &gt;&gt; I want this congregation to say amen to that because you need to be able to do that. That is not an option. That's a requirement. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you don't forgive, you're not going to be forgiven." &gt;&gt; And that to me is very dangerous words. &gt;&gt; That's very dangerous words. I think about it on a fairly regular basis. And I think of it in this light. I need forgiveness. &gt;&gt; I need forgiveness on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; And I want to be in a place where I have a repentant heart before God. We say things or we think things and we do things and so on and so forth and we have attitudes and all kinds of and when when we think oh if we we if we do it in if we think of ourselves in relationship to what's around us maybe it's okay or but that's not it. This is a holy God. And I think so often where brother Brandham preached on influence and and the and the saraphims, holy, holy angels, all they could say was holy, holy, holy, holy. Our God is a holy God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that together? Our God is a holy God. &gt;&gt; He's a holy God. &gt;&gt; Holy, holy, holy. There's no no one like Jehovah. No God like Jehovah. He's a holy God. And I'm glad that the blood stands here tonight for me. The blood stands here for you and I. Hallelujah. And God can only look at us through the blood. &gt;&gt; And without that, we're sunk. &gt;&gt; Thank God &gt;&gt; for the blood of the Calvary, the lamb of God &gt;&gt; that stands for us. But this new generation, there's a there's a certain capacity within young people that they haven't experienced so much stuff and they haven't picked up so much baggage in life and they they they're more resilient and ready and gung-ho and okay, let's go and do it. And so that is what Joshua had to work with. We say and we sing the song, precious memories, how they linger. Well, I tell you what, folks. I got a lot of memories aren't very precious. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got some company here tonight. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of memories that I have. I wake up 3:00 in the morning or 4:00 in the morning. And this might seem this probably seems strange to you. I've missed my mother who passed away when I was six and a half. I've missed her more in the last two years than I missed her in all the rest of my life. I would think. You say, "Why?" I don't know why you just start thinking about all of those things and thinking about, you know, all the years you could have enjoyed and the things you would have uh done together and whatever more and how it would have loved to been able to help her or whatever more and and you just miss them. And and when I think back on that, on one hand, it's it's a bittersweet because it's a it's a precious memory, but on the other hand, there's so much that uh isn't very &gt;&gt; wonderful about it. So we have those memories. Memories can get a person into difficulty. &gt;&gt; Over time memories can accumulate which they do. &gt;&gt; And that's why I think Apostle Paul said forgetting those things that are behind because he knew a bit about it. memories of the of the bondage of Egypt became distorted &gt;&gt; and became glossed over &gt;&gt; and they were thinking of the cucumbers and the melons and the oh how wonderful it was back in Egypt. Hello. &gt;&gt; Do you remember the whip on your back? Do you remember the slavery and how people uh my memory I remember people who sat and fellowshipped? people who took the Lord's supper with me. People who we washed feet together and somehow something just flipped and away they went. &gt;&gt; And you know what? When a when someone who has confessed Christ, when they depart, they never seem to go just where an average unbeliever goes. They seem to have to go to the very depths. I don't know whether they're trying to prove something or what it is, but they go and they just go out to the very depths of of sin and perversion and whatever more. I say what a sad thing. But these people they wanted to go back uh wanted to go back and uh and and God kept telling them you know and when we think about the past now and and uh memories like I said they can become very very distorted and actually very twisted because we we can think of them in terms of of you know h how how wonderful it was back there. See, people get talking. I don't want to spend too much time in this, but get talking about the old days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The old days. You just That's all I want to do is think about them because I don't want to be back there. I don't want to be driving across the roads that I drove when I was in my 20s over the gravel and and so much dust coming into the car. I could hardly breathe and could hardly see the road because of the dust. It would just hanging in the air. You don't know what that is. Or or or go to school on a horseback or or walk and 20 below or 25 below. No, thank you. Help yourself, but I don't want to be back there. And but those are memories. Oh, the old days. And you ladies don't want to be sitting there scrubbing on a scrubboard. And God said, now listen, I've got a ways to go and I'm going to go as quickly as I can. And thou shalt remember that thou was the bond man in the land of Egypt. And he kept saying that. This is what God God didn't say. Thou shalt remember the melons and the garlics. &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou shalt remember that you were bond men in Egypt." And it's good for us to remember. We were slaves back there. And we can say today, "I'm free. &gt;&gt; I'm free indeed. Whom the sun sets free is free." &gt;&gt; It wasn't a nice life back there. It was terrible. We couldn't free ourselves. &gt;&gt; I prayed. I pounded the chair, the table. Oh God, I want to get delivered from this thing. Want to get delivered from this habit. And then one day, God comes in. Praise God. And it's over. &gt;&gt; And even at that time, your eyes are still blinded to many, many scriptures. And you try to I I I wrestle so hard with the Godhead and and the baptism, not so much a baptism, but the Godhead and just trying to understand the Godhead. Didn't realize that the baptism even just interpreted the Godhead. They're so connected together. And then just a a few scriptures out of the prophet's mouth and all the questions became answered. Thank God for the light of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if we were to sit here and we allow our minds to think about past failures, unanswered prayers. Some have trusted in men. Some have trusted in men's doctrines only to find out that it fails them and fails &gt;&gt; fails the test. when the test really comes and those things become part of the package, part of the baggage. Even the two men on the way to Emmas, they said this, "But we trusted, we trusted that it had been him that should have redeemed Israel." &gt;&gt; And that's why they were sad. They said all of our confidence, all of our trust, this great ministry that had come, this God prophet, and they believed he was the Christ, and we trusted this was our answer for redemption of Israel. And now it's all fell apart, and it's all disappeared. &gt;&gt; And there he was walking right with them. In the message, the greatest battle ever thought, brother Brandham said it must be accepted in the mind and then it's believed with the heart and then the word of God becomes a reality and then every senses of soul and body is just scoured out with the Holy Spirit and then you're a sense of God. You're a conscience of God. Everything that's godly flows through you. There's not a doubt anywhere. There's nothing can rise up. There's nothing, and I have this highlighted. There's nothing can come up in the memory and say, "Well, I remember Miss Jones tried to trust God. Miss so and so, Miss Doe tried to trust God for healing one time and she failed." And that's what the prophet is giving a warning here. You don't allow those things in that memory channel. You say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, it doesn't make any difference. Somebody prayed and didn't get it. What about the person that prayed and did get it?" That's where we want to concentrate and focus on. There's always going to be those that pray and don't get it or whatever more. And I'm not here soon as I get people I've had quite a number of people over my life who receive Christ. And one of one of the first things some of them say, "Well, what about all the people that never hear about this? What about all the people that don't know about Jesus or and never hear the name of Jesus Christ? What about them?" They don't. that they just haven't got a concept of the greatness of God that it's not our business. &gt;&gt; That's God's business. &gt;&gt; And those kind of thoughts come your way, that's not for us to occupy our minds with those kind of things. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And so he said, "But but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the Holy Spirit that don't even come in memory, no matter what about Miss Jones or what she did, it's you and God together &gt;&gt; and nobody else but you two." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there you are. He says, "That's the battle in the message." convinced then concerned. He said, "Now this falling away is a lack of concern for the body of Christ. I believe that maybe the right thing that has been presented." And I might just say here very very quickly, I've seen people fall away from following the Lord Jesus Christ, following the the uh the message. And you know what I find that people that they become disenchanted. They become very selfc centered. It's me, &gt;&gt; my situation, my job, my body, my this, my that. I say forget it. &gt;&gt; How I'm feeling. Who cares how you're feeling? We all We all have, you know, those kind of times. We all have them. Hope you don't mind me saying this. I'm going to say it anyway. We need to move away from, you know, my little world and how I'm feeling and all my little things. Why don't we think about the kingdom of God? Why do we think about the believers, the body of Christ at large? Why don't we think about what's on God's heart? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "And so many young students that would take a call in life see so many failures out there and really see that the order and program of the day has failed. Christ hasn't failed. &gt;&gt; Your job might fail. &gt;&gt; Your economics might fail. Your health might fail. All kinds of things. Your friends might fail. The pastor might fail, but Christ won't fail. &gt;&gt; So, you have to have your faith, trust, and confidence anchored in the right object. And he is the object. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ's program hasn't failed. &gt;&gt; I've heard the thing, "Oh, this this message is a mess." I disagree with that. This message is a beautiful message. This message is Jesus Christ and he's never been a mess &gt;&gt; and everything's right on target. Nothing's out of cater. Everything's moving exactly as God has ordained it to move. And it's important for me to be in that program. Christ program has never failed. &gt;&gt; Mine might, yours might, but his has not failed. But the people system has failed. But now Christ has a program that we must enter into. we must enter into. &gt;&gt; I just want to say quickly here so you can get where I'm going. The people here, the children of Israel had a kadesh Barnea. But when Jesus came, he also led the children of the children of Israel. He led them up to a kadesh Barnea, &gt;&gt; which actually was the third pull, the opening of his of the word. It was the opening of his ministry and brother Brandham ties it right to except eat my flesh and drink my blood. &gt;&gt; You have no life in you. &gt;&gt; And in the prophet's ministry, all the people that were gathered, he led them right to Aadesh Barnea. And in Jesus' time, now in Moses time, it was at age 20 years old up and upper and and beneath that. In Jesus' time, it was not an age. It wasn't who's 20 and who's above 20 or below 20. It was what exper what they were prepared to experience because now he had Jesus as Moses sent 12 spies in. Jesus had 12 disciples. &gt;&gt; Only two of Moses 12 came back with a good report. Jua and Caleb. And only one of Jesus 12 was a devil, Judas himself. But the other 11 and they're all different age groups as far as age is concerned. It it now Kadesh Barnea is not an age thing. It's an experience. &gt;&gt; And here tonight now in the message of this hour, it's not an age thing either. It is an experience. &gt;&gt; A kadesh. Every person has their kadesh baria. It's a time when God moves on you and shows you your inheritance and says, "Here it is. &gt;&gt; Move on into it. You don't pull back. You don't draw back. You don't put your eyes on all the problems and the complaints and the failures because that will always be. You don't put your eyes on the world or elsewhere. You don't put your eyes on what this world can provide for you. You look at what God has opened up to you and it will open up first from the word. The message will open up the word and you'll say how glorious, &gt;&gt; how wonderful this is. &gt;&gt; And it's an utter simplicity. &gt;&gt; So often you know with a man or a woman, either one. Some of the things that brother Brandham speaks about it seems so simple. say, well, how we need to act, how we need to speak, how we need to dress, how we need to do these various things. And we think that is so simple. Listen, friends, it's part of your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You don't realize it. Maybe you don't realize it, but by doing and obeying that little simple thing is protecting you and keeping you from the evil. Right. &gt;&gt; As a young lady, you might say, "Well, you know, I hear it pounded over the pulpit and and and what kind of what's the difference of how how I dress?" Well, I'll tell you how important it is. That prophet's message is going out and protecting you from being a prostitute in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; That's how important that is. &gt;&gt; That's how important it is. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. And what does the what does the line say? Lead us not into temptation. And that's exactly what God is doing through the word. He's he's he's protecting the people from temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they said, "And the people, and God said, 'But your little ones which you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land, they shall know the land which you have despised." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I call this a place called Kadesh Barnea. So the children of Israel had theirs under Moses. And brother Brandham said, Joshua and Caleb said, "We're more than able &gt;&gt; to do it." And God made the promise. &gt;&gt; He says that was Kadesh Barnea. And they turned back and became wanderers in the wilderness. And every one of them died and lost eternally. Jesus said so. He said, "Don't cross the separating line when you know to do good and doeth it not to you it is sin." in the thirst message in Tucson in 65 he said how that Moses a prophet came down into Egypt to fulfill the word of God listen how it's phrased now I just wish I had enough time how Moses came down into Egypt to fulfill the word of God to bring the evening light to them &gt;&gt; he's paralleling it completely to the evening light that was right at this time and how they seen the great miracles as they did in this time. And how they followed him at as they did in this time and how they crossed the Red Sea and were baptized unto him and went into the wilderness and eat angels food that fell from heaven and then refused to take it to take all the word. when they come back to Kadesh Barnea from the promised land and said that was the spies and they said they're like giants we can't do it when God said I've already give you the land &gt;&gt; borderline Jesus said they're everyone perished &gt;&gt; and Moses and and Apostle Paul speaks about them and I thought it was really really uh striking listening just listen to this moreover brethren I would not this is to us. I would not that you would be ignorant how that and notice the word a ll all. How that all our fathers were under the cloud. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be nice to be under the cloud and all passed through the sea? &gt;&gt; And all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea. and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ. &gt;&gt; They drank of Christ. They ate angels food as the prophet said. But with many of them God was displeased. God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Yes. &gt;&gt; And now these things were written for our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted. Neither be idolattors as they as they were some of them. As it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play. And if you take the word play in the Hebrew, it is that they became they, you know, they they became humorous and joking and light and frivolous and so on and so forth. And brother Brandon said, "It's the spirit of this age. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of America and everything. I remember a few years ago when you know because I was very keen on on advertising and I needed to have it in my in my in my work as a young man and they were saying even back then that if adverti advertising by radio and by television especially by television if they didn't get a humorous content and make ads funny they weren't going to get anywhere they weren't going to sell their product they weren't going to get the attention of the people. And today, you don't have to be very smart to say that the whole thing is a joke. &gt;&gt; They just put it in everything has to be uh uh a a big a big laugh and everybody's got their mouth wide open and whether they're selling condominiums on the road or whatever. Everybody's having a great time. They don't tell you what's going on inside the condo, &gt;&gt; fighting and the warfare and all the rest of it. Well, we'll get off that subject. In Jesus' time, he brought them up to their their kades barneia in the ministry of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he came to his own and his own received him not. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and the wedding and they would not come. &gt;&gt; This is the this is the experience Jesus was having having. And and I I know that we would feel within our heart, well, I would never want to be in that company. He came to his own, his own would receive him not. And then he went on in and the one that brother Brandham mentioned so many times, and he that eateth my flesh and drinkketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him, that's the land. And the living, as the living father hath sent me, and I live by the father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. See, he's talking about he's talking right now about Kades Barnea. He that eateth this bread shall live forever. These things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum. And many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this, they said, "This is a hard saying." his disciples now called out ones is a hard saying who can hear it and when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured same thing they murmured back there now his disciples murmured at it and said unto them this offend you what if you should see the son of man ascend up where he was before he said it is the spirit that quickenth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not. Here he is. He's coming down to it. Some believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed who believed not and who should betray him. And he said, "Therefore I say unto you that no man can come to me except it were given him given unto him of my father." And from that time from that time many of his disciples went back &gt;&gt; and walked no more with him. It didn't say that they went back and eventually came back and returned. They went back and walked no more with him. Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's hard to even comprehend that people could turn away from the words of Jesus. And those words don't sound that strong to me. &gt;&gt; I don't think that that is I don't think that that is some insurmountable thing. and and what he's saying that no man can come unless it's given to my father. I would want to say well praise God. &gt;&gt; I I pray the father will give it to me. &gt;&gt; And from that time what in other words he brought them to the kades barnea and they went back. They turned back and they died. And that's exactly the scripture that he is using is referring to. And then he said in the unveiling of God, which I read just a couple weeks ago or so and didn't know I was going to come to it again, and then he had 12 left. He chose 12 and one of them was a devil and he said he turned to them and there's no one could explain what he just said. How are they going to eat his flesh and drink his blood? And how did he come down when he was born right here on earth? They couldn't understand it. And then he turned to the apostles and said, "Do you want to go also?" And that's when the apostle Peter made that great statement, Lord, to whom would we go? And this is what I have red and yellow underlined. For we are satisfied, and we know as surely that you and you alone have the word of life at this hour. And we're satisfied of that. and they couldn't explain it. And a little further on, brother Brandham asked the question. He says, "And what could they do? Go back to the cold formal churches that they came out of." Said, "Where would we go?" &gt;&gt; And that question is a reality to us. &gt;&gt; Where would we go? &gt;&gt; Would the people from the colony go back to the colonies? Would you go back to your churches, your denomination? Go back to your Lutheran Salvation Army Pentecost Cath Catholic. What would we do? Go back. Can you imagine going back in there? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going back and listening to some rock band &gt;&gt; on the platform &gt;&gt; or going back and kissing some metal or some statue or going back to where we were? &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, that's a serious thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say thank God. &gt;&gt; And it's obvious that it's a reality to you or you wouldn't be sitting here. &gt;&gt; You're here because it means everything to you. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Where would we go? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't turn back. And we have our own Katish Barneo. And when I think of the people, I'm talking about my baggage, my memories, and I think of those. And I'm baffled. I'm baffled. I'm dumbfounded. I'm speechless. And to think that people could turn aside and be lured aside, enchanted. How deceitful, &gt;&gt; how deceiving Satan is. And I don't want to even go back and say, "Well, I like the best of both worlds." There is no such a thing. We need to be sold out &gt;&gt; to the gospel of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; body, soul, and spirit. &gt;&gt; I say to you, young people, with no hesitation and no apology, you'll never regret giving every ounce of energy and strength and resources to the gospel of Jesus Christ. You'll never regret it. I said, "Driving into the into the parking lot tonight, I just wish I I'm happy for the years God's given. I wish I had more." &gt;&gt; I stand here tonight saying, "I wish I had more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You think it's easy? I invite you to follow me the next five days. &gt;&gt; Turn a U-turn, fly overseas, and be right with the ministers the next morning. and uh and service that night and service the next day. Two services on Sunday and service on on on Monday and and on a plane Tuesday morning. So, I want to be back here, Lord willing, for not to speak, but I want to be here in the in the service and do everything we can for the kingdom of God. And I feel a real burden. I'm going to speak this message, the Lord willing, because that's actually where it started to burn. God is raising. A new generation is rising. Men are not interested in all the quibbling. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, you can quibble. &gt;&gt; You can carry on and complain and murmur and all that. And that's exactly what the murmur is. In the Old Testament, it was grumbling. &gt;&gt; You can grumble your whole life away. And that's why the young people, the young people, they didn't have all that baggage, but the parents, you know, they had that to think about and they thought about that and turn this over and turn that over. When's it going to go away? Never. &gt;&gt; It's never going to go away. You fix that and then there's something else to fix. And you fix that and there's a there's three more things to fix. We're not here just to fix. That's not my ministry. I I was called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm not here to put out a little uh a brush fire here and a brush fire there and this person's got a complaint and that person's got something. That's not what the minister's called for. He's called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. And you're called to hear it &gt;&gt; and do it. &gt;&gt; That's the thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if you hear it and do it, you'll find your life prosper. And when your life is prospered in Christ, you don't have to worry about anybody else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Today we have Arcades Barnea. when the word has been presented to us &gt;&gt; in the message adoption. Let me go quickly now please. He says God by he said remember God predestinated you by fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; I wish I could relate some things to you. It's going through my mind right now. that you were coming to this God by fornowledge predestinated you to come to the promised land. What is the promised land for the Christian today? The promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are a far off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's been those even within the message that want to take away and dilute the the the uh power of the Holy Spirit. I believe in the Holy Spirit. I believe in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I believe there's a ceiling. &gt;&gt; I believe there's an experience when it's when you've had it, it's over. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I believe. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; And God's provided a place of worship. He said, if you bought, he said, you say, "I bought a piece of ground. It isn't yours yet until you got an abstract. We don't have abstract in Canada, but it's a abstract. And he he he speaks what it is. It's traced right back to the very beginning. He says, "But if you got an abstract, it shows that everything was ever against that piece of ground has been stricken off." &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you've become a Christian and accept Christ as your savior, then when God sends down the abstract, it shows that no matter what your father did or your mother did or what anybody else did, your mother, daddy might have been drunkards and prostitutes, whatever it was, every sin is stricken off and you've got an abstract title and there's nothing can put you off of it. He says, "And look, everything that was on the ground belongs to you." &gt;&gt; And when you're in the Christ Jesus by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, every gift of God belongs in the church. &gt;&gt; And it's an abstract title deed. It's yours. It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; And I'm just not going to allow anybody to take that away from me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was away a day last week and I was awake very very early in the morning and I said, "God, I need to hear from you. I've been speaking to you and I don't have an answer. I've been speaking to you and I've been asking you. I need an answer. I need to hear your voice. Don't remain silent." And I read in the Psalms. I've been reading it for some weeks and reading in the scriptures wherever I felt directed and just seeking God, listening to the messages, listening to the tapes and in the wee hours of the morning, I just came to realization and God God spoke and gave me an answer. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful when you know that he says it. &gt;&gt; It's such a restmen, &gt;&gt; such a peace. as God speaks. We need those. &gt;&gt; We need those moments. And you know what, friends? It's worth waiting &gt;&gt; with a baited breath, &gt;&gt; with your mouth open. &gt;&gt; Speak. &gt;&gt; Speak. Father, I'm waiting. &gt;&gt; It's worth weeks. It's worth months. &gt;&gt; It's worth even years. It's worth everything. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have to speak. But oh when he speaks &gt;&gt; it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; I can say isn't he lovely? &gt;&gt; These things belong to us. If Satan has robbed you, this is Wednesday evening. I'm speaking like it would be a convention. If Satan has robbed you of the privilege, and it is a privilege, those men that were 20 and over, and we don't have an age group now, but we have the same devil that caused them to doubt is the same devil that would want us to doubt. &gt;&gt; I believe that there's waters to swim in in this message. Yes, &gt;&gt; I don't think we should be satisfied with where we are and just what we have. But we should say, I know that there is infinitely more for me and I cannot be content till I have that and I'm participating in it. I want to walk in the glory of it. This land is mine. &gt;&gt; This inheritance is mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether it be a healing or whether it be a deliverance or whether it be an answer to prayer, it's ours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And he's robbed you. If he's robbed you of that privilege, we have a right this morning and I'll say we have a right this evening by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God. &gt;&gt; Bring them back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have a right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, you wrote this word. We have a right. &gt;&gt; Bring them back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Rick Hart and Sister Andrea came by our house today. They had just been to Children's Hospital to to have Ella Joy have her checked from the last report from the last time. The last time they were there, they had her all hooked up with all kinds of wires and to check the muscles and the movement and the strength and had everything and put it on a on a computer. And they had a specialist today that had all that data and everything. And he just said, "I don't even need that." He said, "She's doing so well." He said, "She'd be walking in a year." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And I just said, "I've never doubted that. I've never doubted. I can't doubt that. &gt;&gt; Give it back. &gt;&gt; This land is ours. And it's not just with the force of preaching or the or the volume of my voice. It is the promise of God. &gt;&gt; Give it back. &gt;&gt; It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; This is the enemy &gt;&gt; and our children and grandchildren and our inheritance, our families, your sons and your daughters. They're gods. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say and I say with you in the name of Jesus Christ, give it back. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching not for a sermon. I'm preaching for the reality. Give it back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everything this word has promised, the harmony and the unity and the peace &gt;&gt; that must prevail &gt;&gt; in our lives &gt;&gt; and in our homes. &gt;&gt; Give it back. &gt;&gt; If you have a home tonight that's filled with distress and turmoil, you should say with me, Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ, give it back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I claim it. &gt;&gt; I claim my loved one. &gt;&gt; I claim it in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I claim my grandson. &gt;&gt; You claim your loved one. &gt;&gt; Claim him in the name of Jesus Christ. And don't doubt. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says when you rise in the resurrection and you have not doubted, he has to answer to that faith. &gt;&gt; And God cannot lie. He must bring them back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My dear children, &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's no message like this message. &gt;&gt; You won't find that in some other theology. &gt;&gt; You won't find that in some book. And the Holy Spirit is here giving witness to your soul saying that is the truth. [Music] &gt;&gt; Give it back. that belongs to me. &gt;&gt; This is my land. This is my inheritance. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And don't be moved on that faith. &gt;&gt; I don't know how. I don't know when, but I know it shall be. &gt;&gt; And now you see now I'm I'm I'm giving you a little preview of the land. And I know that even in this congregation at this minute, there's twinges &gt;&gt; of doubt. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they did &gt;&gt; in Kades Barnea. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what they did when Jesus brought them to Kades Barnea. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where we are in Aades Barnea. Because we're not here with the prophet of God standing and revealing the secrets of the hearts and people criticizing it and saying and and and here the other day it should have made the people so ashamed they should have been at the altar in full repentance. But he said and he's just saying you got a backachche or you got some like this and he said I didn't guess that. He said why do you do that? &gt;&gt; Why why why do you why do you say that? He said he just says this. Let's just see if I was guessing it. And he calls a woman and he begins telling her everything. Things that are so so in detail you could never never dispute it. &gt;&gt; And he's just proving and making making a fool out of the devil. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And I say that we ought to as believers make a fool out of him. He is a fool. &gt;&gt; Believe. Yeah. &gt;&gt; With everything that's in you. &gt;&gt; And don't take that in your mind. What if it doesn't happen? &gt;&gt; Say I'm believing it. &gt;&gt; You can't believe and say, "What if it doesn't happen?" &gt;&gt; Believing it is believing it's already done. &gt;&gt; God already gave it to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to give him praise and glory. It's a finished work. It's a finished work. It's already done. The prophet says it's substance faith. &gt;&gt; I have a substance &gt;&gt; and I cannot doubt it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes and I've got to abstract. Every bit of it belongs to you. the open word today and it's so full of promises. The open word today is our we're at our cades when it's been been open to us. Says there's the land. And so there's people that are in the land. There's people that are rejoicing. And don't think that the land is just where you're going to sit down, smell the roses. The he said it's your life in the Holy Ghost. And if you don't think that there's war, just get full of the Holy Ghost once and you'll find out you're in a battle. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but there's a victory. &gt;&gt; You don't read and Joshua was defeated and Caleb was defeated and these men were defeated. Now, they were victorious. &gt;&gt; Walled cities, men violent and waring waring nations, but they were victorious. And and and here you're sitting today and the same thing's happening right this minute while we sit here in Israel. The Pope's trying to trying to entice them out of it. and the uh the president of the United States trying to entice them out of it. And I thought it was so so really wonderful the other day uh President Obama and and Prime Minister Netanyahu sitting there and all the all the people from the about 30 minutes you can see it on MSNBC news on the on your television on your computer. To me, it's like a television you're seeing, but you see it on your computer. I listened to about 30 minutes of it. And uh they're sitting there and they said in the little news article that's beside it that that Prime Minister Netanyahu actually pulled a coup because President Obama had already said that, you know, the real key subject had to be the two states and the Palestinian state and the and the state of Israel had to be a two-state settlement. And Netanyahu, he just turned it around and made it an Iran nuclear right &gt;&gt; threat and United States problem. &gt;&gt; And that took up the whole 30 minutes pretty well. That's what they talked about was Iran and the United States and Iran and the United Nations and Iran and the threat that it is. And he says if it's threat to us and we're your greatest friend over there, which was exactly the truth, but all the nations, can you imagine that little sliver of land? &gt;&gt; Those few people still fighting for their existence. trying to get them off the land, trying to get them to settle land, strip away land. You think that we do that in in Canada, United States, or any other country? Well, listen. If you want peace, because we're a waring people, and if you want peace, you know, you got to just give off this whole chunk of the West Coast or give off British Columbia or give off Washington, California, and Oregon. You think they're going to settle for that? And I thought it was so proper for they finally the president of the United States said of course you can't really have a meaningful discussion when there when you have rockets raining down on the head of your innocents &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because because Mr. Netanyahu had already said the first basic fundamental the foundation the beginning ground zero has to be that we are recognized as a legitimate state &gt;&gt; ourselves but until that happens and they don't plan to let that happen I mean you know it's like saying Satan we can coexist if you agree that this land in the Holy Ghost is mine and belongs to me. He's never going to agree to that. &gt;&gt; Try it. &gt;&gt; He's not going to agree to that. He's never going to agree to that. So, you have to just say, "We're at war &gt;&gt; and you're defeated. &gt;&gt; And I point you to Calvary. And I point you to the blood of Jesus Christ, the new creation. And I point you to the second Adam who purchased back everything the first Adam lost. &gt;&gt; And I'm not under the first Adam. I'm under the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we don't want a spiral. I'm going to close without going into this part, but we don't want to spiral in a downward spiral because defeat can come very very simply. And the first the first the Bible says this and here's the sequence. They cried and the crying wasn't crying like we understand crying. The word actually in the Hebrew has that they they they set like a they be they came to a mindset. They came to a certain you know they they determined something in their mind. In fact is the word was that they they reported or they mention it or they publish it or they utter it or they assign it. So they came to a place where they looked at all these things that were happening and they determined that this is the way it is. And when they determined that then the Bible says then they wept all night &gt;&gt; and that was they wailed. Because that's what if you get the wrong thought, &gt;&gt; if you get that and let that negative thought rule in your mind, it will bring you down into a pit of despair. &gt;&gt; And they wailed and wept all night. And then that led, watch, watch the spiral now. Then they began to murmur &gt;&gt; and they began to grumble because that's how it started. They got a negative mindset. And then they became very sad and wept over it. And then they then they began to murmur. And they didn't just murmur and grumble. They began to murmur against Moses and against Aaron. The the objects of leadership. But God God when he answered, he never said, "You murmured against Moses." He said, "You murmured against me." &gt;&gt; That's very interesting. You murmured against me. and he mentions it several times in that same chapter. And then it didn't end there. Then they began to text one another. &gt;&gt; They began to phone one another. They began to speak to one another. And you know what? When they're in that mindset, they weren't they didn't they didn't get in touch with one another and says, "Oh, I just had such a wonderful victory. Hallelujah. Isn't this wonderful? Isn't this life wonderful?" No. No. They communicated all their grumbling. &gt;&gt; They communicated all their negative stuff. And then that began to spread throughout the whole congregation. The whole congregation of the people. And God just said, "That's it. 20 year old and up, 20 year old and under, they're going to inherit it and they're going to go in." And I spoke to a group of young people. I'm just finishing now. I spoke to a group of young people while I was away in some meetings and I spoke about those. That was my whole service on the 20 year old and under. And what I said, they heard all the same things. They experienced all the same things. They saw all the same things. But somehow it didn't have the same effect on them. &gt;&gt; They heard the grumbling. They even saw, listen, Kora and Nathan and 250 princes. And you imagine the thousands that died. And even here in this plague, the some people think it's a a misquote or a error in the scripture. It's not. Paul says there was in one day 23,000 perished in the plague. And if you go to numbers, it says 24,000, but it does it doesn't say in one day. It says that 24,000 died because of the plague. And Apostle Paul says 23,000 died in one day. &gt;&gt; So that was that that was the difference. But that's what it brought them to. &gt;&gt; It just brought them to a massive defeat. I thank God. &gt;&gt; No, I'm done. But I thank God &gt;&gt; that we can have this kind of word &gt;&gt; and this kind of thought and this message. People think it's it's a judgmental message. I say it's so positive. &gt;&gt; It is such a wonderful message. It is the first message I've ever heard that told me who I am and the victory I can enjoy. and I have the abstract and I have the whole inheritance. It belongs to me. There is no other message like that. Friends, we ought to we ought to rejoice. We ought to embrace it. It's Christ. We ought to say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me? &gt;&gt; Balcony. You agree with it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I see some of you and I know that you've even you've even put into practice. You have even brought into effect that kind of faith and you have the results of it sitting right here amongst us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are not of those that draw back. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not of those that draw back, but we are those that have entered in, are entering in. But we're all at different stages of entering in. But those of you, and there may be those of you here today and you've not come yet to your Kadesh Barnea. Don't forget, it's your Kades Barnea, your personal Kadis Barnea. And when you arrive there and you see this is what really belongs to me, don't pull back. Don't pull back. Don't say, "Well, it it's it's too big a thing. It's too great a giant. Too hard for me to hold my testimony here at this job." Milk of Revar is not here. So, I'll just say this. When he came into this message and it it was so quickened to him. It was it was such a living. It was such a joy. He was so thrilled out of what God brought him out of and he can tell you that if he wants to. But I have a little Italian barber I go to and he knew Milco from many years ago in the airline industry and he says to me on a regular basis, "Oh, Mr. Biscll. Oh, Mr. Biscll. He said, "You've done You don't know what you did for Milk." I said, "I didn't do it. It was Christ that did." I know. I know. I know. But, but if you only knew what you did. If you only knew what he was. Well, I knew a little bit what he was, but when he came in and he got and and he came to the knowledge of the message. Actually, he came to the church, a little log church to get somebody out of the church. That was his intent. I got to get him out of this cult. And he says that night, he just got like a bullet right between the eyes and that was the end of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he's in he's a purser on the airlines, you know, he's he's top guy there in the in the cabin. So the girls are coming in and those were the days where I know the girls had their tight curls that looked like he said look like a dog that just got washed. So he told them, he said, "You look just like a dog that just got washed, you know." And they were offended. And so they tried the union and everything else. And they tried to fire him and they couldn't fire him. And the union leader says, "Milco, you just have to stop. You have to stop speaking like this." He says, "I'm trying, but just show me the stop button. If you can show me the stop button, I'll push it, but I can't find I can't find the stop button." &gt;&gt; Amenise God. &gt;&gt; And finally, you know, I mean, they're they're serving the liquor and everything else. And he found everything in this message was coming right in conflict with his job and everything that he was called to do. Well, he wasn't going to give up the message. So, you know, he just had everybody else do all the all the work he didn't want to do. And then finally one day he said, "No, I can't. I just can't I can't stay with this. I just got to check out." &gt;&gt; Go and ask him when he gets home. Ask him if he's ever sorry he checked out. Now he's not sorry he checked out but the message run in conflict with it &gt;&gt; and you find it but if you looked at it and said what am I going to do without this job what am I going to do without this salary what am I going to do this is a giant well for him it was that I'm not advocating that for you but you know we all run into our giants &gt;&gt; and don't don't think you're going to have this land and all of this don't think you're going to have it without a struggle &gt;&gt; you're going to have battles and when you face a battle say God gave me this land &gt;&gt; and I'm not stopping. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give it up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Well, let's stand and I want to sing in the city where the lamb is the light. &gt;&gt; In the city where there I wonder, brother Jonathan, if you'll come out and give give me a hand, please. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember to pray for the folks in China, will you? &gt;&gt; Pray for these ministers. Pray for them earnestly because quite frankly, uh I think that they're going to get the attention of the authorities and they really need God's wisdom and guidance. They need it very much. They need our prayers and our support that way. Amen. All right. There's a country on the starry sky. There's a city where there never comes a night. If we're faithful, we shall go there by and to the city where the lamb is alive. Oh, in that city where the land is alive. In that city where they're coming now. I'm a man over there. And when to [Music] where is life? Here we have our days of sunshine. But we know that the sun which shines upon us now so bright will be you [Music] see where I see [Music] Where the lamb is alive [Music] and the day shall be one eternal day without our tears shall be forever. In that city where the lamb is alive. Oh, we can see where the lamb is. We can see where they come. I'm a man over there and we care. I'm aware. [Music] Here we have our disappointed all the while and our fondest hopes but with bitter by night we make the morning r. [Music] In that city where the land is alive. In the city where they're coming over there and went free to not going where we're just going to take that last verse once more, but I want to I want to say this as a in a concluding thought. You know, you're sitting here today seated in this service and we look way back there to the people that were under Moses and we think, well, you know, the things that I face are are they're real things. Hey, they were real things back there. They said our children's going to be killed. Our wives are going to be killed. That was a real problem. &gt;&gt; They had real justifiable problems. and they were confronting it &gt;&gt; right then and there. &gt;&gt; So don't think for a minute that what we have is real problem. What they had is just kind of up here someplace. They had real problems. Our choice is you can focus all your attention on that &gt;&gt; or you can decide I'm not going to let that occupy me &gt;&gt; because when that's done there'll be something else &gt;&gt; to occupy me. There'll be something else to consume me. I'm not going to allow that to consume me. I'm going to What am I going to allow to consume me? What God has said is mine. What God has declared, this is yours. You have a personal victory. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan take it away from you. &gt;&gt; You have a personal promise. You have a personal Kades Barnea and say, "I am going to I'm going to inherit everything that God has promised me." I'll tell you what, friends. &gt;&gt; The word is completely open. &gt;&gt; The seven seals are open. The word has come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word has come. And it's not just a bunch of phrase, nice phrases. It's a reality. And that is our land. That is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; And Satan will come. He's come your way. He's come my way. You felt it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like the songwriter says, "I can feel the hand of Satan as he's tried to press me sore." He has been before the father asking him to press me more. Hallelujah. But God had confidence in Job. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has confidence in the bride of Jesus Christ. And I bring it down to you individually. God has confidence in you. &gt;&gt; Would you accept that? &gt;&gt; Elijah said that. Not brother Ed. Elijah said that. God's got confidence in you. &gt;&gt; I say thank God. &gt;&gt; I accept that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; In that city where the lamb is the light &gt;&gt; in that city where I went through to I lamb is alive. [Applause] Brother David, Adam, I'm going to have you come and ask God's blessing on the people. Dismiss us in and a word of prayer. God bless you, brother David. Our dear heavenly father, it's a privilege once again, Lord Jesus, to be found in your house. And father, we know, dear God, that it's it's only by your grace that we can stand here, Lord. Father, from many walks of life, from many experiences, from many different things, Lord, but you brought us together in you. And we're very grateful, Lord Jesus, that we've we're able to stand here as one body, as one people, oh Lord God, &gt;&gt; Father, saved by grace, &gt;&gt; washed by the blood of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; kept by the word, Lord, and Father, led by the Holy Spirit. Father, we want to come before you, Lord, as one body to ask for your forgiveness, to ask for your mercy, Lord, to ask, Lord Jesus, that you would wash us from every ailment. &gt;&gt; As we've heard your word, Lord, we're reminded of the scripture that Father, you have sent your word and you've healed the people. &gt;&gt; We're also reminded, dear God, that without vision, the people perish, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, you're so merciful to preach your word and declare the victory and declare what you have ordained for us. But father, we know that we cannot attain it in ourselves, Lord. We can try and try in our human minds, in our in our in our efforts, Lord God. But we know that it takes the quickening of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray tonight, Lord Jesus, is that as your word has been preached, Father, we present it back to you, dear God, knowing that you cannot lie and you cannot fail. And we pray, dear God, let the Holy Spirit take these words, bring it to each heart, oh God. Make it a reality, Father, from the youngest to the oldest, Lord Jesus. As we've heard tonight, Lord, it has nothing to do with age, Lord, but it has to do with the commitment of each individual, the resolve down in our hearts to believe your word, dear God, and go forward. &gt;&gt; We know the enemy will try and fight and present what he may. But Father, we are just committing ourselves into your hands, dear God, just asking, dear God, that you will protect your people, that you will protect your word. For we have believed your word, Lord. And we have confidence in you. Take control, dear God. Bless your minister. Bless all your ministers, Lord, who who walk with the burden of the word, Lord Jesus. Father, bless your people who receive your word, dear God. And Father, let all the glory and all the praise bring be brought back to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. uh you'll greet one another and give them a a handshake that'll be an encouragement to them. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Thanks Jonathan.
