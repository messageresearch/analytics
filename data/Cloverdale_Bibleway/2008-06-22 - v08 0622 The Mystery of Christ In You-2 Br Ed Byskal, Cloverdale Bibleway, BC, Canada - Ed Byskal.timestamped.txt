[0:17] Heat. Heat.
[0:33] God, you are worthy.
[0:37] Worthy is your name.
[0:46] Oh Jesus, the lamb of God.
[0:54] is your way
[1:01] and taking my sin, my cross, my shame,
[1:06] rising again, I bless your name. You are
[1:11] my holy
[1:13] Lord.
[1:19] And when I fall down, you lift me up.
[1:23] When I am crying,
[1:27] you are my
[1:32] Jesus.
[1:36] Jesus.
[1:46] your name.
[1:49] Oh Jesus.
[1:52] Jesus,
[1:54] you're the lamb
[1:56] of God.
[1:59] Worthy.
[2:02] And let's sing that last verse again.
[2:05] Taking my sin.
[2:08] Taking my sin, my cross, my shame.
[2:13] Rising again, I bless your name. You are
[2:17] my holy
[2:20] one.
[2:22] Oh,
[2:25] and when I fall down, you lift me up.
[2:29] When I am cry, you fill my cup. You are
[2:34] my holy
[2:39] Jesus.

[2:44] forever.
[2:52] your name
[3:02] of God.
[3:10] Oh Jesus.
[3:12] Lord Jesus.
[3:30] Jesus,
[3:34] lamb of God,
[3:38] worthy
[3:40] is your name,
[3:48] man.
[3:51] Brother Ryan, Brother Ken are going to
[3:52] help me sing this song. We've sung it
[3:53] before. You sing along with us.
[4:06] So many times I've questioned
[4:10] certain circumstances,
[4:14] things I could not understand.
[4:21] So many times in trials,
[4:25] weakness, my visions,
[4:29] my frustration gets so out of hand.
[4:36] Instead, I am reminded
[4:39] that I've never been forsaken
[4:43] and I've never had to stand one chance
[4:47] alone.
[4:50] As I look at all the victories, then the
[4:54] spirit rises up in me and is to the
[4:59] fire. My weakness is made strong. Oh,
[5:06] he never promised that the cross would
[5:09] not get heavy
[5:12] and the hill would not be hard to find.
[5:20] He never offered
[5:23] our victories without fighting. He said
[5:27] we're always
[5:33] just remember
[5:35] standing in the valley of decision
[5:40] and the adversary say
[5:46] just
[5:50] my Lord will show up will and he will
[5:54] take you through the dry again.
[6:02] I know within myself that I will surely
[6:06] perish.
[6:08] But if I trust the mighty hand of God,
[6:11] he'll shield the flames again.
[6:20] Oh, he never promised that the cross
[6:24] would not get he
[6:27] and the hill would not be hard to
[6:35] he never
[6:38] victory without fight but he said help
[6:42] would always
[6:48] just remember We're standing in the
[6:52] valley of decision
[6:55] and the adversary
[6:57] say
[7:08] and he will take you through the fire
[7:12] again.
[7:16] He never promised that the cross would
[7:20] not be
[7:34] without.
[7:42] Oh, just remember where standing in the
[7:47] valley of decision
[8:00] will show up
[8:03] and he will take you through the fire
[8:07] again.
[8:15] I am redeemed
[8:20] by
[8:22] the price.
[8:25] Jesus
[8:26] has changed my whole life.
[8:39] who I am.
[8:43] Tell me
[8:45] I am
[8:49] where
[8:52] I am.
[8:56] I
[9:00] will Jesus
[9:03] has my life.
[9:10] If anybody
[9:15] just
[9:16] I am
[9:18] will tell them
[9:21] I am.
[9:24] Thank you Lord
[9:27] that I am redeemed
[9:33] by the way of Christ.
[9:36] Will Jesus
[9:38] has changed my life.
[9:45] If anybody
[9:48] tells you
[9:50] just who I am,
[9:54] will tell them
[9:57] I am redeemed.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[10:16] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We worship you
[10:18] this morning, Lord. We're so thankful
[10:21] for what you've done in our lives, Lord
[10:22] Jesus. Glory to your name, Lord.
[10:25] Hallelujah.
[10:28] Amen.
[10:30] Want to go to prayer at this time and
[10:31] I'm going to ask our brother John
[10:32] Andy's, Brother John, if you'd come and
[10:35] open the service in a word of prayer.
[10:38] I want to remember uh Brother Kim
[10:40] Dingwall. Uh I believe brother Michael
[10:43] Ray is there as well over in the
[10:45] Philippines and uh
[10:49] they're setting up uh the saints there
[10:51] with uh a local printing operation. So
[10:54] we want to remember them. God would just
[10:56] have his perfect way. I want you to
[10:59] continue to uh remember the uh testimony
[11:03] that's going out on Believe the Sign.
[11:05] We've had uh looking at the numbers the
[11:08] other night, 21,000 visitors in the last
[11:11] 6 months.
[11:13] We're getting 150 to 200 people every
[11:15] day. And uh I had a request come in uh
[11:20] on Thursday from a lady by the name of
[11:22] Barbara who lives in Green Bay,
[11:24] Wisconsin. and uh just say just asking
[11:28] that we would pray for her for personal
[11:31] situation for her health and also for uh
[11:34] spiritual guidance. So I want to
[11:35] remember her this morning. If you've got
[11:37] a need, if you're listening on in on the
[11:39] internet, you've got a need, you just
[11:42] take it before the Lord as we go to
[11:43] prayer. Brother John.
[11:46] Amen. Let's pray together.
[11:50] Lord, it's good to be in your house
[11:52] today, Lord.
[11:54] We can lift up our hands and lift up our
[11:56] hearts. Know that there's a living God
[11:59] that's present.
[12:01] Not a million miles away or behind some
[12:03] cloud somewhere. He's in this building.
[12:06] He's in our hearts. You're present,
[12:09] Lord. You're closer than if we could
[12:12] even touch your skin. You're within us.
[12:15] You're in our souls.
[12:17] You're in our lives, Lord. When we
[12:18] speak, it's you coming through us. Our
[12:21] burdens are your burdens. Our desires
[12:24] are your desires. We're your people.
[12:27] We're your sheep. We are your children.
[12:30] We just want to open up our lips and
[12:32] praise your name. Shout hallelujah.
[12:36] Give you glory. Give you honor. If we
[12:39] can lay down on our faces, we'd sing
[12:41] praises. Hallelujah.
[12:44] Oh, for a thousand tongues. Oh, for a
[12:46] 100 hands. Oh, for lives to spend poured
[12:49] out at your feet, Jesus. You called us
[12:52] to be alive at this hour. You knew the
[12:55] political pressure. You knew the demonic
[12:58] pressure. You knew the economic
[13:00] pressure. You knew the darkness we would
[13:02] live in. And you knew that there would
[13:04] be lives of men and women alive that you
[13:07] would anoint and you would fill and you
[13:10] would live through them. And Lord, we
[13:12] want to confess that we are those
[13:14] people. We are your family. We are your
[13:17] wife. We are your bride. We are your
[13:20] chosen ones. You have redeemed us. You
[13:24] have saved us. You have called us.
[13:29] Thank you, Jesus.
[13:31] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord.
[13:35] Hallelujah, Lord. Blessed be the name of
[13:38] the Lord. For you have triumphed
[13:40] gloriously, Lord.
[13:44] There's miracles here, Lord. Lives of
[13:47] men and women. You have redeemed.
[13:50] You've saved our souls. We were lost. We
[13:53] were bound. We were in trouble.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; And you delivered us. You have healed
[13:59] us. You have filled us with the Holy
[14:01] Ghost. We are born again by your power,
[14:04] Lord.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; This day is an opportunity
[14:10] for us to be at your feet, Lord. You
[14:13] know our needs even before we open our
[14:15] mouths.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; You know our burdens, God,
[14:19] are so small when we even think about
[14:22] your greatness and your power, Lord. And
[14:25] that just in a moment, we could be in a
[14:27] new body. Be on the other side.
[14:31] Be in that other place that we've grown
[14:33] for for many years. Lord, may every life
[14:36] this morning be under the impact of your
[14:39] nearness. Your word Christ unveiled in
[14:43] our lives. So wonderful. You're so
[14:46] precious. You're so lovely.
[14:50] Father, take each heart that's here. We
[14:53] place ourselves on the altar. There's
[14:56] hands lifted up all throughout this
[14:57] building. There's unspoken requests on
[15:00] the internet and some have been spoken.
[15:04] We know the challenge of the hour, Lord,
[15:06] to go into the all the world. And
[15:09] sometimes we can't go, but there's some
[15:11] that aren't here with us this morning,
[15:13] but you have sent them from our midst.
[15:16] Our brother Kim Dingwall, our brother
[15:18] Michael Ray, brother Ernie Villanoeva.
[15:21] We hold them up, Lord.
[15:23] That you would bless the works of their
[15:25] hands and the brothers and sisters. This
[15:28] is your vision. This is your word. These
[15:30] are your thoughts. Bless them today,
[15:33] God. And may the things that need to
[15:35] come into place come into place, Lord.
[15:38] Unspoken requests. This sister from
[15:41] Wisconsin wrote in to believe the sign.
[15:43] And other written requests and hands are
[15:47] lifted up. Some are silently standing in
[15:50] your presence. And throughout this
[15:51] meeting, they need a miracle, Lord. But
[15:54] we believe you're a miracle worker,
[15:56] Lord. We believe that healing is present
[15:59] here in this service. By your stripes,
[16:02] we've already been healed. And we want
[16:04] to claim that for our loved ones and for
[16:06] those around us. Salvation is free.
[16:11] Deliverance is available.
[16:14] Counsel is here. Your heart is here. So
[16:17] this morning we just reverence ourselves
[16:20] in your presence and pray your blessing
[16:22] upon the meeting. Brother Rod and the
[16:24] singers and every activity, the prayers,
[16:26] the hearts that are being lifted up, our
[16:29] pastor. May you anoint the word that it
[16:31] would come to our souls that there would
[16:34] be answers coming through the word. And
[16:36] Lord, we we must just be at that moment
[16:38] of crossing over. May we're attentively
[16:42] hearing your voice. May you speak to us,
[16:46] God, today. And may you show yourself
[16:49] mighty in the sanctuary, in the
[16:51] fellowship hall, and the nursery,
[16:53] throughout the service, out through the
[16:55] internet lines, and the hundreds that
[16:56] are with us. Oh, Father, may you just
[16:59] fall down among us, Lord, and your
[17:01] spirit would just bring us to a
[17:03] spiritual awareness, Lord.
[17:07] Have your way this morning as we as we
[17:09] continue to praise you, Lord. as we
[17:12] continue to honor you as as there be
[17:14] love services going on throughout this
[17:16] day. Lord, may you receive our lives and
[17:19] we thank you, Lord Jesus, our heavenly
[17:22] father that's brought us forth out of
[17:24] your mind to be living expressions. We
[17:27] thank you for the family of God. Have
[17:30] your way in this meeting. Break down
[17:32] every stronghold. May the enemy be bound
[17:35] today. May darkness leave. May the light
[17:38] be turned on. May revelation flow freely
[17:41] and inspiration
[17:43] in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank
[17:46] you Lord. Amen.

[33:45] my life was in his hand.
[33:53] He knows my name.
[33:59] He knows my every thought. He sees. He
[34:06] sees. He fears that fall
[34:11] and hear me when I call.
[34:19] And I have a father.
[34:26] He calls me his own
[34:32] and he'll never leave me.
[34:38] No matter where I go,
[34:45] he knows my name.
[34:51] He knows my every
[34:57] sear
[35:01] that falls and hears me.
[35:06] Oh, aren't you glad that he knows he
[35:11] knows my name
[35:15] and he knows
[35:19] my
[35:21] heart and he sees
[35:24] See each teen.
[35:31] Sing it once again. He knows my name.
[35:38] I am
[35:41] He knows he knows I am. He thought and
[35:48] said to her
[35:52] and
[35:55] me when I
[36:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Does it ever occur to you where do all
[36:07] those children sit?
[36:10] That was the first question came into my
[36:12] mind. And the second one was, is the
[36:14] lineup ever going to quit coming down
[36:16] the aisle?
[36:18] It just marvelous.
[36:20] Uh this is the closing of uh
[36:25] most of the school activities
[36:28] uh different schools whether be high or
[36:30] middle school or uh US or on the
[36:34] Canadian side.
[36:36] the school term is closing at this time
[36:38] and so there's been it's been a busy
[36:40] time with you know graduations and
[36:42] various ceremonies. I never knew that
[36:45] they graduated out of kindergarten but
[36:47] they do if you folks don't know that
[36:50] they do they graduate out of
[36:51] kindergarten and then they start with uh
[36:56] one and then they graduate at grade
[36:58] seven and then they're going into middle
[37:02] school I guess. And uh so they have all
[37:04] kinds of graduations. I just give up. Uh
[37:07] all we can do I think we need to start a
[37:09] printing press and print cards,
[37:11] graduation cards. Every time I turn
[37:13] around, my wife is buying cards for some
[37:17] graduation at some level. And uh I
[37:20] thought it would be appropriate this
[37:22] morning to give a special thanks to our
[37:28] brother uh Timberman's, Mr. Randy
[37:31] Timberman's
[37:33] and to his teaching staff, the teachers
[37:37] of the school that have contributed so
[37:41] so much to the children of this
[37:45] congregation.
[37:47] only eternity will
[37:50] actually reveal or we won't be able to
[37:53] tally it up in this life what has been
[37:56] contributed to the to the students to
[38:00] those that are Sunday school teachers as
[38:02] well uh you have such a valuable time
[38:05] with them such interesting time but the
[38:09] school especially because it's here
[38:11] every day and I would like uh to really
[38:16] have your attention for a moment. There
[38:18] are those of us here who uh we do not
[38:22] have children in our home. They're
[38:25] perhaps like myself, what they call
[38:27] empty nesters.
[38:29] Uh there are others who are single uh
[38:33] perhaps single parents or single
[38:34] unmarried throughout the congregation
[38:38] and uh uh all various status and levels
[38:43] of of life. But I can tell you that the
[38:46] school is an incredible investment for
[38:50] us as believers. Just an incredible
[38:53] investment. Now, I know that uh many of
[38:57] our students are in a uh regular school
[39:01] system and so be it. It needs to be uh
[39:05] on on occasion. It has to happen that
[39:08] way. That's the decision of the parents
[39:10] and we we just don't get involved with
[39:12] that. That's up to you. But I can say
[39:15] one thing. This is a marvelous,
[39:18] marvelous atmosphere.
[39:20] Uh and and we're very very committed to
[39:23] the school. The Lord willing. There will
[39:26] be turning sod for the new school
[39:29] building which was going to be on the
[39:31] far corner of the property. It'll be two
[39:34] stories. It is going to house up to 225
[39:38] students. And when you have as many as
[39:41] uh maybe 20 students joining this year,
[39:45] it's going to be a considerable
[39:48] uh uh complement to uh to to the number
[39:53] of students that are coming. Now we have
[39:57] a we have a very special and very unique
[40:00] situation in that we are both a Canadian
[40:04] and American congregation. that just
[40:07] happens to be the fact and we will
[40:10] probably continue to be that for uh the
[40:14] foreseeable future. Uh and and and as
[40:18] time has gone on, the reality just
[40:20] simply is that the congregation has
[40:23] become more merged with uh young ladies
[40:27] and young men becoming married,
[40:29] sometimes from both sides of the border,
[40:32] sometimes internationally from other
[40:34] places overseas and whatever that might
[40:39] be. We have some special challenges with
[40:41] the school and with the with the uh
[40:45] level of teaching, the number of
[40:47] teachers that are needed, the the
[40:50] facility that is needed. We are not able
[40:52] to accommodate it here in the Sunday
[40:55] school rooms anymore. We've we've done
[40:57] everything that we can. We've adjusted
[40:59] office space etc. But we find that the
[41:02] we believe and this is my personal
[41:05] unequivocal conviction that the school
[41:08] is a valuable valuable compliment and
[41:12] asset to our spiritual life and
[41:15] well-being of of this church of the
[41:18] message and I believe it with all my
[41:20] heart with the rising costs with the
[41:22] fuel. Uh do you know that uh uh uh one
[41:26] of the brothers I was just talking to
[41:28] told me that it was 10% of his entire
[41:32] gross salary is going to the is going to
[41:37] the fuel just to bring the children back
[41:40] and forth to come to the church and
[41:42] bring them every day. Now, I don't know
[41:44] what the whole answer is, but I'm
[41:47] feeling that I may have to meet with the
[41:49] uh with the school staff and the and the
[41:52] teachers because I do not want to see uh
[41:56] young people and parents who have
[41:59] children who want to be desperately want
[42:02] to be in the school and maybe just
[42:04] cannot afford. They might be able to
[42:06] afford a portion, but they can't afford
[42:08] the whole amount. And we have had a a
[42:12] program over the years of sponsoring
[42:15] children. And it might be that you're
[42:17] here and you don't have any children.
[42:19] You're single. You're not even married
[42:21] perhaps yet. But you may see if I ever
[42:24] do have children, I want them in that
[42:26] school. And uh I think that I would like
[42:29] to uh see the the congregation take it
[42:33] upon themselves as the Holy Spirit would
[42:36] burden your heart and say, you know, I
[42:38] want to make a contribution towards
[42:41] these children. I want to invest in the
[42:44] children. And we're not taking any
[42:46] offering. You you know that. But yet, I
[42:48] don't apologize. I don't back away from
[42:50] making this known. It's a challenge that
[42:52] I think we need to rise and meet. And uh
[42:56] I would like to see that we would have
[42:58] uh that we would have a fund that we
[43:00] would have adequate uh adequate funds
[43:03] available and that the uh parents who
[43:07] simply who who who would qualify for it
[43:11] uh would would be able to have their
[43:13] children in the school. And then uh I I
[43:17] would just like to see also that if God
[43:19] and we really need to pray
[43:22] uh because the the border is uh
[43:25] difficult. It's increasingly difficult.
[43:27] Uh quite frankly, I would like to see
[43:30] them be able to pull pull the children
[43:32] to the border and have them walk across
[43:35] and have a have a van on this side pick
[43:37] them up and bring them to school. That's
[43:39] what I would like to see. I don't know
[43:41] if the border would allow that. Uh, I
[43:44] know you should be able to walk across,
[43:46] but I mean if they came up from the
[43:48] Lynen side, it came up from the Blaine
[43:50] side, it would only take two two
[43:52] vehicles to pull them and bring them to
[43:54] the border, let them walk across and
[43:56] have them picked up here. Then it would
[43:57] involve so many less people and uh
[44:00] parents wouldn't have to be driving back
[44:02] and forth and back and forth every day,
[44:04] especially when we have these huge costs
[44:06] of uh fuel the way it is right now. I
[44:09] thought I would just say that. And uh
[44:12] but if you wish to contribute uh you
[44:15] could do that any time. You could do
[44:17] that immediately for the next year
[44:19] because the tuition costs must increase
[44:23] in order to give them the kind of
[44:25] facility that they need. And your gift
[44:27] would just be an assistant to them. If
[44:30] you want to uh sponsor a child, that's
[44:33] also possible. You can just call the
[44:35] call the school or call the church
[44:37] office and we would just do what you
[44:39] can. I believe in it with all my heart.
[44:41] I really, really do. And I see and
[44:44] sometimes there's children and they just
[44:45] get a hold of my heart and I can't let
[44:48] them go. I have personally sponsored
[44:51] children who grew up and they have gone
[44:53] away from God. Uh they have gone away
[44:56] from following the Lord in the light of
[44:58] the of this message. Uh but I have never
[45:02] regretted putting that young man through
[45:05] school.
[45:06] I never regretted it because I know one
[45:09] thing. He heard things. He saw things.
[45:12] He saw an example in the in the
[45:15] teachers. He was in church. He was part
[45:17] of these things. You can never get away
[45:19] from it.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Never never get away from it. And what
[45:23] we do, friends, is not for time.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; It's for eternity.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:29] While we are seated here today, our
[45:31] brother Ernie, brother
[45:34] uh Kim and brother Michael are in the
[45:36] Philippines. And just to give you a bit
[45:39] of an idea uh uh from brother Kim, he
[45:43] just said uh we have arrive we have had
[45:46] several meetings this week with the hub
[45:48] team and are appointed and moving and
[45:51] are appointed and moving. We arrive on
[45:54] Friday and we'll be setting up equipment
[45:56] on Friday. Saturday will be spent
[45:59] training brothers Vernon Rex and a few
[46:01] IT volunteers available to us. Sunday is
[46:05] uh is service and resetting equipment in
[46:07] the evening. Monday we will be training
[46:10] ministers and their assistance in the
[46:12] operation of printing many books. There
[46:15] will be about eight sites represented at
[46:18] the Monday meeting complete with their
[46:20] computers. So we won't have to travel to
[46:23] those sites. Tuesday to Thursday, we
[46:26] will be traveling throughout the
[46:27] Philippines, uh, setting up print
[46:29] stations. We expect to complete about 11
[46:33] in total while we are there. And this
[46:35] leaves brother Rex to set up the
[46:37] remaining four and outlying areas. Uh,
[46:40] the portion of this project should be on
[46:43] cruise control at this time and I would
[46:45] like to discuss the future direction.
[46:48] I'd like to just say to the congregation
[46:50] this last week, you did see the website
[46:53] and uh brother Kim displayed it u uh
[46:56] went through it with you, but they have
[46:58] already it was just I didn't bring it,
[47:00] but they just arrived and and and
[47:03] brother Dingwall sent me a a manual, an
[47:06] operating manual. I don't know how in
[47:08] the world it was 22 pages. Uh I was
[47:11] told, you know, brother Ernie sent an
[47:13] email. They they picked the brothers up
[47:15] at the airport after that very very long
[47:18] flight. They left here at 2 2:00 a.m. in
[47:20] the morning. Had to be to the airport 3
[47:22] hours ahead of the flight. So they had
[47:25] to be at the airport at 11:00. They left
[47:27] out at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. Flew to
[47:29] Taiwan. Had a layover uh 3 to four to 5
[47:33] hours. Caught another flight and then
[47:35] flew directly to Manila. Arrived at
[47:38] Manila. They picked him up at the
[47:39] airport and took him right to the Bible
[47:41] believer's office. I I say that's
[47:43] without mercy.
[47:46] And then they start this kind of a
[47:48] schedule because they only have like
[47:50] about one week. In the meantime, the
[47:52] devil is working overtime
[47:55] and the printers are caught in Los
[47:57] Angeles. And for some unknown reason, if
[48:00] you've ever heard anything like this,
[48:02] the forwarding agent who's supposed to
[48:04] forward all these printers from Huelet
[48:07] Packard gets these printers and refuses
[48:09] to accept them.
[48:12] And we get into a great big kaibosh.
[48:14] Don't even let me get into trying to
[48:16] explain this and FedEx delivers them the
[48:20] second time to the forwarders and the
[48:22] forwarders refuse to accept them. Says,
[48:24] "Well, there's something here and
[48:26] something there." And so right now there
[48:28] that whole thing is kind of up in the
[48:30] air. Brother Derek has been working
[48:32] night and day on this situation. So,
[48:35] let's play that pray that God will blast
[48:38] through uh with a victory for us and get
[48:41] these. Couldn't be anything simpler.
[48:43] You're just shipping a bunch of
[48:44] printers, but they're not going to get
[48:46] over there. If they don't go right away
[48:48] Monday morning, they won't get over
[48:50] there in time. But you can see how God
[48:52] has prepared. Uh uh Michael told me in a
[48:55] text that the young men are in their
[48:58] late teens and early 20s and they're
[49:00] just caught onto that hub like that. I
[49:03] took brother Dioa into my office here
[49:06] and I I went through the hub with him
[49:09] and I can tell you he caught he caught
[49:12] the vision. He could see putting these
[49:15] into various places and brother Gary I
[49:17] was encouraged that you had gone on to
[49:19] the internet and tied into it. Do you
[49:22] realize that these various stations that
[49:24] are going to the different uh pastors
[49:27] and different works and individuals, do
[49:29] you realize that anybody with a computer
[49:32] may be able to print their own mach
[49:34] print their own book? And and and when
[49:36] these brothers gathered in the
[49:37] Philippines, they they just said, you
[49:41] know, what book do you want to print?
[49:43] The the brothers here, not brother, not
[49:45] brother Kim, not brother Ernie, not
[49:47] brother Michael. They just had one of
[49:48] the brothers there that they had just
[49:51] gone through the whole thing and
[49:52] complete the manual and showed them how
[49:54] to set the whole thing up. Had the
[49:56] brother right there. He goes on the
[49:58] internet, pulls down the message he
[50:00] wanted to pull down, printed it right
[50:02] there at the printer, stapled it and
[50:04] folded it and had held a book in his
[50:06] hand. He says, "I I tell you what." Then
[50:08] they got excited.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Then they got excited. And each one of
[50:12] these will serve all the smaller works,
[50:15] smaller churches. So you could take you
[50:18] say well 20 printers that doesn't sound
[50:20] like a lot but when you when you say 20
[50:23] maybe each one of them handling 10
[50:25] little groups of churches you suddenly
[50:28] have 200 churches
[50:31] &gt;&gt; when you talk about 40 for India which
[50:33] is the next thing the next project is 40
[50:36] for India you're talking about
[50:38] approximately 400 churches and maybe
[50:41] more then it becomes very very
[50:43] substantial so I can tell you that that
[50:46] work is uh I believe it's actually going
[50:48] to revolutionize the way people uh look
[50:50] upon receiving the message. Going to
[50:53] completely revolutionize it. Amen.
[50:57] Have I said enough? No, I haven't.
[51:01] Couple more things.
[51:05] Oh, you're so nice and
[51:08] respectful.
[51:10] I appreciate it.
[51:12] Beginning next Sunday,
[51:14] you all listening? Beginning next
[51:17] Sunday, June the 29th, if that's a long
[51:20] weekend here, we're going to be
[51:22] commencing one service on Sunday.
[51:25] Commencing June the 29th. That's next
[51:28] Sunday. We'll just be one service here.
[51:31] And then through July and August will be
[51:34] one service on Sundays here.
[51:38] Besides what is going on at the border,
[51:41] we need to really pray that there won't
[51:43] be any unnecessary
[51:46] uh uh hold up. Uh the there are some
[51:50] union problems on the amongst the
[51:52] Canadian border uh officers and while
[51:56] the officers themselves are not
[51:58] permitted to to uh walk off the job uh
[52:03] they can slow things down even further
[52:06] and that's not nice. So uh we're not
[52:10] bowing to that but that's just some of
[52:12] the realities that may take place.
[52:14] They're trying to prevent it and but we
[52:17] don't know and we we need to pray that
[52:18] it will be prevented. The borders enough
[52:20] problem but there will be one Sunday
[52:23] service starting June the 29th for and
[52:26] then continuing through July and and
[52:28] August it's about 10 weeks. July the 5th
[52:33] we are going to have a camp fellowship
[52:35] day. Uh a lot of folks said well we
[52:38] don't know a lot about it. Well you
[52:40] don't really need to know a lot about
[52:41] it. It's just going to be a day we're
[52:43] inviting you to come out to the camp uh
[52:46] about noon or if you want to come just a
[52:48] wee bit earlier that's fine but uh
[52:51] starting about noon and till 6:00. It'll
[52:55] be like an open house. Now it's not
[52:59] there's not a service as such. It's
[53:01] going to be just an informal time of
[53:03] fellowship. We plan to have a a a large
[53:06] barbecue and uh just so we can have some
[53:10] lunch. brother Raymond, who we know is
[53:13] our devoted and very very busy chef.
[53:16] He's going to be there and barbecuing
[53:19] some roasts for us and uh have some
[53:22] maybe some baked salads, etc., etc.
[53:24] We'll speak to the sisters. Uh and it's
[53:27] just going to be a day like that. Some
[53:29] of the perhaps the folks who have play
[53:32] guitars or something may bring their
[53:34] guitars and have some time of
[53:36] fellowship. But what we really want to
[53:38] do, we're going to have some of the
[53:39] senior young people designated as tour
[53:43] guides and they are going to be uh
[53:47] they're going to be informed ahead of
[53:49] time. So they'll be perfectly educated
[53:52] in what what has taken place at the camp
[53:56] so they can answer your questions and
[53:58] takes groups of maybe 15 to 20. Now
[54:01] listen folks, I have several from this
[54:04] congregation who went there year after
[54:07] year to the to the meeting. They arrived
[54:10] there at the meeting night, went into
[54:11] the tent, were part of the thousand
[54:13] people that were there in the tent, came
[54:15] back out to their car, drove out and
[54:18] never did know that there were other
[54:20] buildings up the up the hillside. Never
[54:22] knew anything about the cabins. Never
[54:24] know knew anything about how the camp
[54:26] functioned, how it operated. Perhaps
[54:29] never were in the dining room. Well,
[54:31] this the tour guides, these young men
[54:34] and young ladies are going to take
[54:36] groups of say 15 to 20, whatever is
[54:38] comfortable, going to be able to take
[54:40] you through and show you everything that
[54:42] has happened in the last 6 8 months. And
[54:45] I can tell you then you will appreciate
[54:48] uh a much much have a much greater
[54:51] appreciation for what our brother Chris
[54:54] Peterson and brother Randy Snow have
[54:56] been doing. They have been working very
[54:58] very hard at that camp and then all the
[55:01] others that have been there. So this is
[55:03] for everyone. We want you to see what
[55:05] this is. We want the church and every
[55:08] congregation as it is your life, your
[55:12] contribution that has made this possible
[55:15] and we want you to be able to
[55:17] emotionally take ownership of it sort of
[55:20] thing. We also want to be able to
[55:23] introduce to you that this camp is going
[55:25] to be operating also on a on a like a
[55:29] retreat basis. Everybody tries to get
[55:32] some time off and get away someplace and
[55:35] go over to the island or go to the San
[55:38] Juans or whatever more just to get a
[55:40] place of, you know, where you can
[55:43] kind of catch your breath and whatever
[55:45] more. Well, we want to turn the camp
[55:47] into that kind of a place also where
[55:49] you'll be able to go online and book
[55:51] some days and and and occupy some of
[55:55] these buildings. So, we'd like you to
[55:57] see what the what the buildings are like
[55:58] and what is there. So, uh that's part of
[56:02] what this day of fellowship is going to
[56:04] be. Just going to be a free open time
[56:06] and you can come and go as you wish. If
[56:09] you need to leave, we will be eating
[56:11] probably between 2 and 3:00 in the
[56:14] afternoon. And you may wonder why I'm
[56:16] making this kind of announcement is it's
[56:18] kind of uh kind of my idea. I wanted as
[56:21] a pastor to invite you as a congregation
[56:24] to come out and just spend some nice
[56:26] time together.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, and I and I know I know this I
[56:33] know this congregation very well because
[56:35] I've been here a long time. And soon as
[56:37] they say, "Well, aren't we going to have
[56:38] a service?" No, we're not going to have
[56:40] a service because soon as you say that,
[56:42] that means somebody's got to study and
[56:44] preach.
[56:47] And I'm going there to relax, too.
[56:50] Is that all right?
[56:52] &gt;&gt; All right. I think I've said everything
[56:56] except preach.
[56:59] No, I didn't say everything. I got email
[57:02] first thing I got email from from New
[57:05] Zealand. God bless you that are
[57:07] streaming in New Zealand. I got email
[57:09] early this morning from Switzerland. God
[57:12] bless you that are streaming from
[57:13] Switzerland. And they said, "We just
[57:15] tied into the hub." They did what you
[57:17] did, Brother Gary. We just tied into the
[57:19] hub. We think this is marvelous. We want
[57:21] to send an offering to set up some print
[57:23] stations, some hub print stations. So,
[57:26] we just got to say, God bless to the
[57:28] people that are streaming and in in the
[57:30] UK and in Norway and all over Europe and
[57:34] down in Switzerland. some people there
[57:35] just faithfully over in India streaming
[57:38] all the time. Uh over in Africa,
[57:41] different countries in Africa. Uh so we
[57:45] just say God bless all of our friends
[57:47] that are streaming. Can we say God bless
[57:49] you?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Amen. Let's stand and
[57:52] sing. We're standing on holy ground and
[57:54] I'm going to have you open your Bibles
[57:56] if you would. Uh we're going to read out
[57:58] of Second Corinthians where we read last
[58:01] Wednesday. 2 Corinthians 5 just verses
[58:05] 17 to18 and then we're going to read
[58:08] also out of Colossians the first chapter
[58:11] starting at verse 18. Amen.
[58:15] We are standing
[58:21] on
[58:23] ground
[58:28] and I know
[58:35] all around
[58:42] Praise
[58:47] Jesus.
[58:49] Now
[58:53] for we are standing
[58:57] in his presence on holy
[59:02] ground.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Let's just unite once more with our song
[59:06] please. We are standing
[59:13] on holy
[59:15] ground.
[59:20] And I know that there are angels
[59:29] around
[59:34] us. Oh, let us praise.
[59:37] Let us praise
[59:40] Jesus
[59:42] now.
[59:46] For we are standing
[59:50] in your presence.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Just before we read, we'll pray. Dear
[1:00:00] heavenly father, you've been so kind to
[1:00:02] us. How can we ever return thanks? How
[1:00:05] can these lips speak the words we ought
[1:00:07] to speak? How can our hearts express
[1:00:10] what's in them? Oh God, now as we thank
[1:00:13] you for the opportunity to be together,
[1:00:16] thank you, dear Lord, that you ever
[1:00:18] called us or we wouldn't be able to come
[1:00:19] and worship. We are worshiping today in
[1:00:22] spirit and in truth. We thank you, oh
[1:00:25] God, that you have delivered word to us,
[1:00:28] vindicated
[1:00:29] message for this hour and we are able to
[1:00:32] worship you in spirit and in truth.
[1:00:35] Praying now that the Holy Spirit will
[1:00:37] give us insight. May we be revelated, I
[1:00:40] pray, by the Holy Spirit. For these
[1:00:42] things are not understood by the natural
[1:00:45] mind. We cannot put it through our
[1:00:48] natural thinking process and come up
[1:00:50] with the correct answers. Teach us, I
[1:00:53] pray. Guide us, oh God. Bless this
[1:00:56] people abundantly and all who are
[1:00:58] connected with us, Father, through the
[1:01:00] internet and whatever other means. We
[1:01:02] pray that you will bless them. Anoint us
[1:01:04] each one for service now. And as I
[1:01:08] speak, the people listen attentively. I
[1:01:11] ask your blessing on them in Jesus
[1:01:13] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to read now uh from
[1:01:19] Corinthians 3:es 2 Corinthians 5:17-19.
[1:01:24] Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he
[1:01:27] is a new creature. Old things are passed
[1:01:29] away. Behold, all things are become new,
[1:01:33] and all things are of God, who hath
[1:01:35] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[1:01:38] Christ, and hath given to us the
[1:01:40] ministry of reconciliation,
[1:01:43] to which that God was in Christ,
[1:01:45] reconciling the world to himself, not
[1:01:48] imputing their trespasses unto them, and
[1:01:51] hath committed unto us the word of
[1:01:54] reconciliation.
[1:01:56] If you'd notice that 19th verse to that
[1:01:59] God was in Christ. Now Colossians the
[1:02:02] first chapter verse 18.
[1:02:06] And he is the head of the body, the
[1:02:08] church, who is the beginning of the
[1:02:10] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[1:02:12] things he might have the preeminence.
[1:02:15] For it pleased the father that in him
[1:02:17] should all the fullness dwell. and
[1:02:19] having made peace through the blood of
[1:02:21] his cross by him to reconcile all things
[1:02:24] unto himself. By him I say, whether they
[1:02:28] be things in earth or things in heaven.
[1:02:31] And you that were sometime alienated and
[1:02:34] enemies in your mind by wicked works,
[1:02:37] yet now hath he reconciled in the body
[1:02:40] of his flesh through death, to present
[1:02:42] you holy and unblameable and
[1:02:44] unreprovable in his sight. If you
[1:02:47] continue in the faith grounded and
[1:02:49] settled, and be not moved away by the
[1:02:52] hope uh away from the hope of the gospel
[1:02:55] which you have heard, and which was
[1:02:58] preached to every creature which is
[1:03:00] under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a
[1:03:02] minister, who now rejoice in my
[1:03:05] sufferings for you, and fill up that
[1:03:07] which is behind of the affliction of
[1:03:10] Christ in my flesh, for the body's sake,
[1:03:13] which is the church, whereof I am made a
[1:03:16] minister according to the dispensation
[1:03:19] of God, which is given to me for you to
[1:03:23] fulfill the word of God.
[1:03:26] Even the mystery which hath been hid
[1:03:28] from ages and from generations, but now
[1:03:32] is made manifest to his saints, to whom
[1:03:35] God would make known what is the riches
[1:03:38] of the glory of this mystery among the
[1:03:42] Gentiles, which is Christ in you. uh the
[1:03:46] hope of glory. God bless you as you have
[1:03:49] your seats.
[1:03:52] For those of you that were here
[1:03:53] Wednesday evening, there will be
[1:03:56] considerable
[1:03:58] uh comments that are made, but I really
[1:04:01] felt I need to establish that message uh
[1:04:05] in your hearts. And uh to me, it's been
[1:04:08] a very outstanding time. And I pray that
[1:04:11] it will be something that will be a
[1:04:14] milestone in your own uh spiritual life
[1:04:16] and walk with God. Now the two
[1:04:20] scriptures, one from the first scripture
[1:04:22] reading, God was in Christ
[1:04:25] and the second one is Christ in you the
[1:04:29] hope of glory. So God was in Christ and
[1:04:33] Christ is in you. And there is a there
[1:04:36] is a process by which God is bringing
[1:04:39] himself
[1:04:41] into the individual. We've spoken on
[1:04:44] that considerable in the past. Paul said
[1:04:47] in Ephesians, he said, "From whom the
[1:04:50] whole body fitly joined together and
[1:04:53] compacted by that which every joint
[1:04:55] supplieth according to the effectual
[1:04:58] working." that which every joint supply
[1:05:02] that's every joint that includes
[1:05:04] everyone here who is a believer and a
[1:05:07] member of the body of Jesus Christ. It
[1:05:10] says that every joint supplieth but
[1:05:14] that's according to or uh relevant to
[1:05:19] the effectual working. Another word in
[1:05:22] the scripture says the operation of God.
[1:05:26] God has uh he he has a design. He has a
[1:05:31] plan. He has a program. He has an
[1:05:35] operation. He has put into motion
[1:05:39] certain certain things and and how
[1:05:42] things function. For example, we receive
[1:05:45] healing. We know comes by faith. Uh
[1:05:48] revelation uh faith is a revelation
[1:05:51] prophet says. So there are things that
[1:05:54] you can receive by faith. The prophet
[1:05:56] had uh people in front of him and and
[1:05:59] some were actually ranked sinners, but
[1:06:02] they had faith and they believed the
[1:06:05] word. And so that law is in place. And
[1:06:08] while and while a godly sister may miss
[1:06:12] what she needed from God, what she was
[1:06:14] asking God for, she would miss it
[1:06:17] because she was not there on the basis
[1:06:19] of faith. She didn't have faith for
[1:06:22] whatever reason to believe it. And here
[1:06:24] comes someone who knows nothing about
[1:06:26] the gospel said even just a prostitute
[1:06:28] off the street and would believe the
[1:06:30] word. And God has a law. If you believe
[1:06:33] it, you'll have it. Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; So God has a he has a system in place
[1:06:41] whereby
[1:06:43] uh we are
[1:06:46] we receive what God had intended
[1:06:51] to send out of himself
[1:06:56] and we and the and the term is Christ.
[1:06:58] It is the anointing. It is the word. Uh,
[1:07:02] and uh, now Christ in you
[1:07:07] by the Holy Spirit. I've been very
[1:07:09] careful to word this, so I want you to
[1:07:11] catch it the way I have taken the time
[1:07:14] to set it out. Christ in you by the Holy
[1:07:19] Spirit is the designated chosen
[1:07:24] power of God sent to the believer or
[1:07:28] sent into the believer to accomplish or
[1:07:32] to fulfill
[1:07:34] that portion of the promised word for
[1:07:38] this day.
[1:07:40] So now Christ in you and as I said
[1:07:44] earlier I'd like to repeat it also from
[1:07:46] Wednesday. We have the terminology which
[1:07:49] we use which we should use
[1:07:54] of Jesus Christ or the Lord Jesus
[1:07:57] Christ.
[1:07:59] And Jesus is his name. That's his given
[1:08:02] name. Christ is a title.
[1:08:06] Lord is a title. And Jesus has many,
[1:08:09] many, many titles and I wouldn't even be
[1:08:11] able to take time. I have columns of
[1:08:13] that. He's the righteous branch. He's
[1:08:16] the He's the cornerstone. And we could
[1:08:19] go on and on and on of the titles of
[1:08:21] Jesus Christ. He's all of that. But for
[1:08:24] the purpose of the service, we want to
[1:08:28] I I want to focus once again that he is
[1:08:30] the Lord, which is Adoni or Adoni.
[1:08:35] uh the existing one,
[1:08:38] Lord Jesus, his given name. For he shall
[1:08:42] save his people from his sins. I shall
[1:08:44] call his name Jesus. And Christ the
[1:08:47] anointed one. But men were anointed.
[1:08:50] Prophets were anointed. Kings were
[1:08:52] anointed. You can be anointed. And
[1:08:55] people who are false can be anointed.
[1:08:58] And the prophet said the anointing is
[1:09:00] absolutely the genuine anointing.
[1:09:03] But they have ulterior motives. The
[1:09:06] rain, for those of you that don't
[1:09:07] understand, the rain falls on the just
[1:09:11] and the unjust.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; The rain falls on the just and the
[1:09:17] unjust. Peter said by quoting from the
[1:09:20] prophet of the Old Testament, "In the
[1:09:23] last days, says God, I'll pour out my
[1:09:26] spirit upon all flesh, but not all flesh
[1:09:30] is saved." So, the the anointing is
[1:09:33] something that has come out from God.
[1:09:36] And I'm going to be able to give you
[1:09:38] quotes because I actually want to have
[1:09:40] you see some of this visually. So now
[1:09:43] there have been times when the season of
[1:09:46] the word has not been as as uh clearly
[1:09:50] identified as this season or I would say
[1:09:54] there there have been seasons I would
[1:09:56] say in Martin Luther's time or in the
[1:09:58] time of the martyrs in the time of
[1:10:01] Wesley in the time of the messengers as
[1:10:04] they came as they came forward it seemed
[1:10:06] that a season had arrived when it was
[1:10:09] very clearly defined what the message
[1:10:12] was what? There was there was a new
[1:10:14] surge. There was a new move. There was
[1:10:17] something happening. There was a stir.
[1:10:19] And the stir was because God was on the
[1:10:22] move.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That was the stir. And if there ever was
[1:10:26] a time that it should have been more
[1:10:29] clearly visible of what was taking
[1:10:32] place, it should have been at at those
[1:10:34] seasons.
[1:10:35] We have arrived at one of those seasons.
[1:10:38] Even even men who are are not religious
[1:10:41] as such, they realize there's been uh
[1:10:44] like uh uh David Edwin Harrell who has
[1:10:48] uh written his book. He was professor of
[1:10:50] of history, religious history at
[1:10:53] Birmingham, Alabama University, and he
[1:10:56] flew up here and I spent a whole day
[1:10:57] with him. He was very very interested in
[1:11:00] uh brother Brandham's ministry because
[1:11:02] he said we recognized that it that it
[1:11:05] was that he was the first of a of of
[1:11:09] many and that it caused a a stir and a
[1:11:12] wave to sweep across America that has
[1:11:15] changed the face of America. And he's
[1:11:18] written his written his book on it. And
[1:11:20] and so we are living in a time that is
[1:11:24] that is really quite unique. And I'm I'm
[1:11:26] going to just say a few more words on
[1:11:28] that. Today
[1:11:31] we have an abundance. Now you people are
[1:11:34] sitting here worshiping in a church and
[1:11:36] there are many many churches that have
[1:11:37] less people and many churches have more
[1:11:39] people. But that is irrelevant to me.
[1:11:43] It's what the people believe in that
[1:11:46] church and that makes it all together
[1:11:49] different. What they actually what has
[1:11:51] been revealed to them. So, you'll just
[1:11:54] have to hold your seats while I move
[1:11:56] through this uh subject today. It's very
[1:11:58] very uh uh it's very clearly set in my
[1:12:02] heart and I'm just praying that God will
[1:12:03] give me the ability to convey it to you
[1:12:06] and God will give you the ability to
[1:12:08] receive it. But today, we have an an
[1:12:11] abundance, listen closely,
[1:12:14] of infallible proofs.
[1:12:18] I want to put you on people on notice
[1:12:20] that just a short time ago they didn't
[1:12:22] have,00 tapes
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; with a man standing there declared by
[1:12:29] the Christian world as God's prophet
[1:12:32] calling people out and telling them
[1:12:37] uh
[1:12:38] with with irrefutable perfection
[1:12:42] actually divine perfection one after the
[1:12:45] other after the other over year in and
[1:12:48] year out, never in secret, but always in
[1:12:52] public. Why am I why am I emphasizing
[1:12:55] this this uh uh fundamental which is
[1:12:59] just fundamental to all of you that are
[1:13:01] believers, but you need to hear it also.
[1:13:04] God's not going to take back his word.
[1:13:07] God's not going to say, "Excuse me, for
[1:13:09] that." God did that with a divine
[1:13:12] purpose in mind, and that was to put
[1:13:14] this generation on notice. I have done
[1:13:17] something here I have never done before.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I should have heard something more in
[1:13:23] response out of that. I've done
[1:13:25] something now. And when God does
[1:13:26] something, there's a responsibility that
[1:13:29] comes with it. There's a very serious
[1:13:31] responsibility. He's saying now here it
[1:13:34] is. Now, what are you going to do with
[1:13:35] it?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Are you going to regard it for what it
[1:13:38] is or you just pass it off? like Jesus
[1:13:41] when he was here. And and that was God's
[1:13:44] manifesting himself. He they said he's a
[1:13:47] good man. He's a great teacher. He's a
[1:13:50] he's he must be one of the prophets.
[1:13:52] Maybe he's John the Baptist that came
[1:13:54] back that has risen from the dead. And
[1:13:56] they had all kinds of ideas. He may be
[1:13:58] Isaiah. Maybe he's Jeremiah, Elias, or
[1:14:01] one of the other prophets. He may be
[1:14:02] this, maybe the other. And some others
[1:14:04] said he's Beloveub. He's prince of the
[1:14:06] devils. Now, isn't that isn't that and
[1:14:09] and and
[1:14:10] isn't that a great span?
[1:14:13] Right from the prince of the devils to
[1:14:15] one of the prophets and still they all
[1:14:17] missed it.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Every one of them missed it. And there
[1:14:21] were a few that saw the manifestation.
[1:14:25] They all saw the manifestation. And so,
[1:14:28] it's not merely that God manifest
[1:14:30] himself. It's what do you do with that
[1:14:32] manifestation?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And if you just sit and say, "Well, I
[1:14:36] saw the manifestation." So, I go to
[1:14:37] church at Cloverdale Bible Way. That
[1:14:39] doesn't mean a thing.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; I saw the manifestation and and I've
[1:14:44] been stirred in my heart and and I'm I'm
[1:14:46] I'm you know, I'm going to do this. I'm
[1:14:48] going to do that. I'm going to be
[1:14:49] baptized. Fine. Wonderful. I'm baptized
[1:14:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:54] That's all wonderful. But what are you
[1:14:55] doing? What does this manifestation mean
[1:14:57] to you?
[1:14:59] This manifestation means to me that God
[1:15:02] himself because God was in Christ,
[1:15:05] Christ is the word and God sent that
[1:15:08] word to the earth through that
[1:15:10] anointing. Anointing happens to be the
[1:15:13] process happens to be what God has
[1:15:16] chosen to use. It is the it is his
[1:15:18] method. It is his operation. It is his
[1:15:22] it's his effectual working. And when God
[1:15:25] says it's his effectual working, I can
[1:15:27] tell you if if a million miss it and
[1:15:30] only one catches it, it's still God's
[1:15:33] effectual working.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; God's not out to sweep multitudes and
[1:15:37] multitudes, God's out to retrieve and
[1:15:39] recover his children. And he's going to
[1:15:42] get every last one of them. I announce
[1:15:44] to you there will not be one that he
[1:15:46] will lose. He will lose none of them. He
[1:15:49] will call them. He will call them by
[1:15:51] name. They will hear his call and they
[1:15:55] will respond to it. Whether earlier or
[1:15:57] later, but at some time they will
[1:16:00] respond to it. And Jesus said, "My sheep
[1:16:04] hear my voice and another they will not
[1:16:07] hear." Aren't you thankful for that? My
[1:16:10] sheep hear my voice and they will come.
[1:16:13] If you're one of his, you will come.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, if you're not one of his,
[1:16:19] it's impossible for you to come.
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; We have to be honest.
[1:16:27] And I trust that even what's calling you
[1:16:30] and drawing you in your heart is
[1:16:32] witnessing to you today. I'm one of his.
[1:16:35] There's something about his voice. I
[1:16:37] don't understand everything, but there's
[1:16:39] something about this call. You may just
[1:16:41] be a young person. You may just be a
[1:16:43] child. You may be in your senior years.
[1:16:46] But you may be saying, "There's
[1:16:47] something about this that I can't let go
[1:16:49] of." And I can tell you if you're one of
[1:16:51] his, it's not what you let go of. It's
[1:16:53] and and what you hold on to. It's the
[1:16:55] fact that he's holding on to you and you
[1:16:57] can't get away. You can go into sin. You
[1:17:00] can get into debaucher uh into life of
[1:17:03] debauchery. God will not let you go.
[1:17:06] You'll come easy or you'll come hard,
[1:17:08] but you will come.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's my confidence. And today we have
[1:17:13] an abundance of these infallible proofs
[1:17:16] and signs and wonders, miracles, the
[1:17:19] supernatural in healing and
[1:17:22] manifestations of God. There has been a
[1:17:25] public display of the personal presence
[1:17:28] of God. So now I'm moving away, listen
[1:17:31] closely, I'm moving away from just signs
[1:17:34] and wanders and so on because that can
[1:17:36] take place in many places and amongst
[1:17:39] many different kind of people. But the
[1:17:41] public display when the when the prophet
[1:17:44] of God uh brought the people before him,
[1:17:47] they and this is very significant
[1:17:49] friends. It's not just something that's
[1:17:51] in my mind, but he the the people were
[1:17:54] actually brought into the personal
[1:17:56] presence of God. I cannot generate that
[1:17:59] for you. I cannot duplicate that for
[1:18:02] you. But God by his own sovereignty and
[1:18:05] grace could bring you into that
[1:18:06] presence. If you want to and have not
[1:18:09] heard deep call to the deep or you have
[1:18:11] and it's been a long time ago, it would
[1:18:13] be good for you to hear it again and see
[1:18:15] the woman that comes standing there just
[1:18:17] before the secret of her heart is
[1:18:19] revealed. And she stands there and and
[1:18:21] and she she's a little bit nervous. So
[1:18:24] she reaches out to steady herself on the
[1:18:27] corner of the pull pit. And when he and
[1:18:29] she reaches out her hand like that,
[1:18:31] Brother Brandham speaks to her and he
[1:18:33] says, "You don't don't fear that. That's
[1:18:36] not me. That's him.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Because she had come into and he said
[1:18:41] many times, you know that you're not
[1:18:44] standing in the presence of a man. Now,
[1:18:46] we've had all kinds of others that
[1:18:48] prayed for the sick and those things.
[1:18:49] I'm not talking about television
[1:18:51] evangelist and all the rest of it and
[1:18:53] falling forward and backward and all
[1:18:55] this kind of emotion. Not talking about
[1:18:56] that at all. I'm talking about an
[1:18:59] individual coming into the presence of
[1:19:01] almighty God. And that's what for you of
[1:19:03] the believers, that's what this message
[1:19:05] came for. And I, as I said, Wednesday
[1:19:08] night, the the apex of God's visitation,
[1:19:12] the apex of his uh manifestation, the
[1:19:15] apex, the absolute pinnacle of it was
[1:19:20] when he would come with his own personal
[1:19:23] presence to the earth, almighty God, in
[1:19:27] in in such a way that had that he had
[1:19:30] ordained. And that is why the first
[1:19:33] coming of Christ and the second coming
[1:19:36] of Christ are so significant. And there
[1:19:39] is a third coming of Christ. He comes to
[1:19:43] pay the price to die on the cross as a
[1:19:46] sacrifice for to purchase his people,
[1:19:51] his bride. Then he comes to take her and
[1:19:55] catch his people away. And the third and
[1:19:58] it's all clearly in scripture. And the
[1:20:00] third time he comes is with his saints.
[1:20:03] So he comes to purchase his saints. He
[1:20:05] comes to take his saints. And the third
[1:20:08] time he comes with his saints.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; And I suggest to you that we are right
[1:20:16] in the crux. The reason why for this
[1:20:18] personal presence of God, this was an
[1:20:21] apex. This was a pinnacle time. You have
[1:20:24] lived in the era of the time of the
[1:20:27] messenger of Malachi 4.
[1:20:31] the forerunner with the sign of the
[1:20:35] resurrection,
[1:20:37] the sign of the Messiah.
[1:20:40] And those that receive the true
[1:20:43] revelation
[1:20:44] of the meaning of this event,
[1:20:47] they become the voice. Now, this is
[1:20:50] actually I'm just giving some
[1:20:52] preliminary statements here because now
[1:20:54] I want to go into some details and have
[1:20:57] you see some quotes on the screen. Those
[1:21:00] that receive the true revelation of the
[1:21:02] meaning of this event are the voice. You
[1:21:05] see, in the time of Jesus in his first
[1:21:08] coming, there were multitudes that saw
[1:21:10] the vi saw the manifestation,
[1:21:13] but there was a few that received the
[1:21:15] revelation.
[1:21:17] And I was saying to you on Wednesday
[1:21:19] that there is a distinction between
[1:21:22] Jesus and Christ,
[1:21:24] not different persons. And Jesus isn't a
[1:21:27] different person in the Godhead. He is
[1:21:30] another manifestation of that Godhead.
[1:21:34] But there is a difference. There's a
[1:21:36] distinction between Christ because
[1:21:38] that's a title and Jesus. Jesus is his
[1:21:42] given name. And Christ is
[1:21:46] identifying him as the anointed one.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And that is why when you speak to Jews
[1:21:52] today, you talk about the Messiah, they
[1:21:54] have a lot of different ideas about the
[1:21:56] Messiah. Uh Gerson Solomon, I talked to
[1:22:01] him about it and he said, uh, I said,
[1:22:04] "How is it when the Messiah comes?" He
[1:22:06] says, "The Messiah is going to come
[1:22:07] riding on the front end of an Israeli
[1:22:09] tank."
[1:22:11] I said, "Well, it's not the one I read
[1:22:13] about."
[1:22:16] Rabbi Richmond would have a different
[1:22:18] concept of how the the Messiah is going
[1:22:23] to be. And they read the same scriptures
[1:22:25] you and I read, but see it quite
[1:22:26] differently. But the Messiah, Jesus, is
[1:22:29] called the Lord because he is we regard
[1:22:32] him as the anointed one. Jesus is his
[1:22:36] name and the Lord. the Lord Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ, the anointed one
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; who was sent. Now, the disciples who
[1:22:47] received him and who received the
[1:22:49] revelation,
[1:22:51] please understand and don't don't think
[1:22:53] that I'm just be be, you know,
[1:22:55] belaboring this point, but multitude saw
[1:22:58] the manifestation.
[1:23:00] You understand? Only a handful caught
[1:23:04] the revelation of what that
[1:23:06] manifestation was all about. And the
[1:23:08] revelation was expressed and that's why
[1:23:10] it's in the Bible by by Peter. Who do
[1:23:14] men say that I am? You're Isaiah,
[1:23:17] Jeremiah, or one of the other prophets.
[1:23:19] Who do you say that I am? That was the
[1:23:22] question. Brother Brandham says that was
[1:23:23] the real question. Who do you say I am?
[1:23:26] Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:23:29] living God. Blessed art thou, Simon
[1:23:32] Barjonah. Flesh and blood hath not
[1:23:34] revealed this unto you, but my father.
[1:23:37] That's what separated.
[1:23:39] Everyone saw the same manifestation. But
[1:23:42] now here was an individual who had the
[1:23:44] revelation. It wasn't just some mental
[1:23:48] concept. But he he recognized he
[1:23:51] recognized to such a degree that the
[1:23:54] same one said later on to whom can we
[1:23:57] go? when Jesus when the when the even
[1:23:59] the ministry was leaving the 70 were
[1:24:01] leaving and and the people departed and
[1:24:05] the Bible says there was five about
[1:24:07] 5,000 people and now he was left with
[1:24:10] just his 12. Here's Jesus Christ the
[1:24:12] greatest minister that ever stood on
[1:24:15] earth losing 4,988
[1:24:18] people.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Now that by your standard would not be a
[1:24:23] successful campaign.
[1:24:27] And he spoke in such a way so that many
[1:24:29] were offended and many left. But there
[1:24:32] was a handful that could not leave
[1:24:34] because they finally said, "To whom
[1:24:36] shall we go?"
[1:24:40] The prophet said they couldn't go back
[1:24:41] to their old formal churches. They
[1:24:43] couldn't go back to that old doctrine.
[1:24:46] They couldn't go back and said, "Who to
[1:24:48] whom shall we go? Thou art the Christ.
[1:24:51] They're the son of the living God." And
[1:24:53] even though Peter did some cursing in
[1:24:55] denying the Lord Jesus in his hour of
[1:24:59] during the passion and the crucifixion,
[1:25:01] he denied him that he was even with him.
[1:25:03] Denied him three times. But yet he could
[1:25:06] not let go.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And God would not let go of him.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation.
[1:25:17] And that separates those that saw the
[1:25:19] manifestation from those that got the
[1:25:22] revelation. And now on revelation in the
[1:25:25] scripture,
[1:25:26] there are many, many, many times where
[1:25:29] God refers to his revelation. He
[1:25:33] revealed he revealed. He revealed to the
[1:25:37] people. Listen close. It doesn't mean
[1:25:40] the people saw it. Doesn't mean the
[1:25:43] people understood it. God revealed it.
[1:25:46] God made it clear. If you take the words
[1:25:48] revealed, revelation, uh, revealing the
[1:25:52] manifestation, making known, showing
[1:25:55] himself, he did all of those things. Who
[1:25:58] Who could have been more visible than
[1:26:00] Jesus Christ?
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Who could have been How could God have
[1:26:06] done that in a more clear, precise way
[1:26:09] than to send Jesus Christ?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; He was born of a virgin, but they didn't
[1:26:14] believe it. That's exactly right.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; He did miracles and in spite of his
[1:26:19] miracles, they were prepared to kill him
[1:26:21] and crucify him.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; He raised from the dead and they lied
[1:26:25] about his resurrection.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; The whole country was given over on one
[1:26:31] on one weekend. They want to make him
[1:26:33] king and they lay down and tear their
[1:26:35] clothes off and wave their uh and cry
[1:26:38] out hosana and wave their palms before
[1:26:41] him as he rides into Jerusalem. and the
[1:26:43] very next week they're killing him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Now people are fickle
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and they haven't changed.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; So there's a big Did those people see
[1:26:55] the manifestation? Absolutely.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Saw the manifestation but didn't receive
[1:27:00] the revelation.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; And we can say God revealed himself.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:27:07] to himself. God made himself known. God
[1:27:10] made himself visible. But the people
[1:27:12] didn't see it yet
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; because of a blindness. Listen, this
[1:27:17] world, if there ever was a blind
[1:27:18] generation, it's this one. We're blinded
[1:27:21] by Hollywood. We're blinded by soft
[1:27:23] living. We're blinded by all kinds of
[1:27:26] stuff. We're blinded by religion. We're
[1:27:28] blinded by our own thoughts and our own
[1:27:30] reasoning. And man has elevated himself
[1:27:33] with all of his learning and all of his
[1:27:35] places of higher education. Higher
[1:27:37] education got higher and higher and got
[1:27:40] further away from God. Yes.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; You want to thank God if God has given
[1:27:48] you eyes to see in this generation. Oh
[1:27:52] dear. How blind this age is. Young
[1:27:55] people don't trust. Get all the
[1:27:57] education you can. But remember one
[1:27:59] thing, education is blind a person.
[1:28:03] Wealth and business will blind a person.
[1:28:06] Just soft living will blind a person.
[1:28:08] cares of this life will blind a person.
[1:28:11] The only thing that will give us insight
[1:28:13] is the word that came from God.
[1:28:16] And thus sayith the Lord that came from
[1:28:18] God is the only thing that'll give you
[1:28:20] vision, give you insight, and be able to
[1:28:23] give you balance in your life.
[1:28:30] And those that believed then I haven't
[1:28:32] even got through my introduction yet.
[1:28:34] But those that believed, they became the
[1:28:38] effect of that anointing coming upon
[1:28:41] them. The effect of the creative power
[1:28:43] of the logos which came out from God.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And that was the that was the the
[1:28:50] method.
[1:28:51] Brother Brandon said it was a part of
[1:28:53] God. You see that little light that
[1:28:56] little halo of light had come and and
[1:28:59] then here it come and it it was it was
[1:29:01] something coming out from God. He said
[1:29:03] it was coming out of the bosom of God.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; It was the logos, the Greek word for
[1:29:10] word. It was the anointed word. He said
[1:29:13] it was the anointing. It was the son. It
[1:29:17] was Christ.
[1:29:23] Then Christ was in Abraham. Christ was
[1:29:28] in Isaac. Christ was in Joseph. Christ
[1:29:31] was in Moses. Christ was in David.
[1:29:33] Christ was in all reflected. It was
[1:29:36] Christ that was in them.
[1:29:39] And then I read for you
[1:29:44] where Elohim met Abraham. And brother
[1:29:46] Bram said that wasn't Jesus.
[1:29:49] Jesus hadn't been born yet. And that's a
[1:29:53] key phrase. You need to remember that
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; it was Christ.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I thought they're the same."
[1:29:58] That's correct. Because Christ, he
[1:30:02] became Christ Jesus because it was this
[1:30:06] plan of God that was unfolding. that
[1:30:09] part of God that came out and came out
[1:30:12] and and and and in types and shadows
[1:30:14] until finally the son of God himself
[1:30:17] stood on the earth.
[1:30:20] And those that believed
[1:30:22] John was the voice in the wilderness.
[1:30:24] John the Baptist says he was the voice
[1:30:27] in the wilderness.
[1:30:29] Jesus Christ was the voice in the
[1:30:31] streets
[1:30:33] of Jerusalem.
[1:30:35] The Bible speaks of those that will be
[1:30:37] the voice of many waters. And the
[1:30:40] prophet said, "What is his voice?" It's
[1:30:43] the judgment. It's the voice of
[1:30:44] ministers through the Holy Spirit that's
[1:30:47] cried out to the people in every age.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters in Christ, I will
[1:30:57] announce to you according to that word,
[1:30:59] you are hearing the sound of some of
[1:31:02] those waters this morning. Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; You're hearing the very manifestation of
[1:31:08] Christ, Christ in a people.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I believe that I'm standing here
[1:31:13] solemnly today to fulfill part of that
[1:31:17] scripture.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; This happens to be part of the voice of
[1:31:20] many waters. You have heard it over this
[1:31:23] pullpit time after time. Not just
[1:31:26] preaching, not sermonizing, but the
[1:31:28] voice of many waters by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:32] to attract the people
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; to catch their attention.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Not only that something is said that
[1:31:39] their mind can turn around and say,
[1:31:41] "Well, that's different. Oh, I think I'd
[1:31:43] like that church." Has nothing to do
[1:31:45] with that. We're not here to offer
[1:31:46] programs. We're not here to entice
[1:31:49] people. We're not here to build a
[1:31:51] kingdom. We're here to We're here to on
[1:31:54] behalf of the kingdom of God which is
[1:31:56] not established in material things.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "My kingdom does
[1:32:01] not come by observation."
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; The voice of many waters. And the
[1:32:09] prophet said, "God still has a voice." I
[1:32:12] say to you this morning, God still has a
[1:32:14] voice for the people of the world, for
[1:32:17] the people of Vancouver, for the people
[1:32:20] of Seattle, for the people of the
[1:32:22] Pacific Northwest, God still has a
[1:32:25] voice.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And for for the people of the world,
[1:32:29] even as he has given a voice, a voice to
[1:32:33] the bride. Hello bride. Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; The called, the elect of God. God has
[1:32:39] given a voice to you.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; And it's his voice.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are the voice of the
[1:32:53] message.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We are the voice of the resurrection.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; We are the voice of the rapture. Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; God has to have a voice
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; saying the season has arrived, world.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; The season has arrived.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And part of the evidence that the season
[1:33:20] has arrived is Malachi 4 came streaking
[1:33:23] across. The messenger of Luke 17:30
[1:33:28] revealing Jesus Christ himself. When you
[1:33:31] see the days of Noah, have we seen them?
[1:33:33] Yeah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Sodom and
[1:33:35] Gomorrah, have you seen them
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; even so
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; shall it be? That is the voice of many
[1:33:41] waters speaking. I can pick up the echo
[1:33:44] of that same thing because my God said
[1:33:46] there's still a voice in the world. That
[1:33:48] voice has been given to the bride of
[1:33:50] Jesus Christ. And he said, "When you see
[1:33:51] the days of Noah and you said they're
[1:33:53] here,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; and you said and you see the days of
[1:33:56] Sodom and Gomorrah and you say that
[1:33:58] they're here, then then it's incumbent
[1:34:00] upon you to to to admit and to confess
[1:34:04] that Malachi 4 has come."
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Malachi 4 has come. The messenger has
[1:34:11] sounded.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; And what does that mean? That means that
[1:34:14] there'll be great manifestation.
[1:34:16] And in the manifestation, some will
[1:34:18] catch the revelation. Now, that is God's
[1:34:21] revelation. Please get this. God can
[1:34:24] reveal himself. Doesn't mean that the
[1:34:25] individual caught the revelation.
[1:34:32] That's God's sovereign grace to you
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; that you actually catch the revelation.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] I've seen people walk in companionship
[1:34:43] with the word of God, with the message
[1:34:45] of the hour. I've seen them walk in
[1:34:47] companionship
[1:34:49] and then and then depart. As far as I'm
[1:34:52] concerned, they never got a revelation.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; They became emotionally involved. They
[1:34:58] needed a church. They needed the school.
[1:35:00] They needed this. They needed that. They
[1:35:02] needed some marital assistance. They
[1:35:03] needed some help. They needed some
[1:35:05] guidance. whatever more. That's not what
[1:35:07] the church is here. We're not here as a
[1:35:09] social enterprise. We're here to get men
[1:35:12] and women born again by the spirit of
[1:35:15] God, birthed into the kingdom of God,
[1:35:17] and so that they will be in a position
[1:35:19] to receive the revelation that comes
[1:35:22] from God. And once that revelation sinks
[1:35:24] into their soul, there's no changing
[1:35:26] them.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] We are the voice of the message
[1:35:40] and we are the manifestation of these
[1:35:42] things and once fulfilled
[1:35:46] one will require a revelation. Then
[1:35:50] Jesus as I said earlier
[1:35:56] and I'd like to just show you some
[1:35:58] slides. Now we can we're going to read
[1:35:59] some slides.
[1:36:10] The titles Lord and Christ are intended
[1:36:13] to convey a specific aspect of the plan
[1:36:16] of redemption. Christ is a title and
[1:36:20] Jesus is the name. Jesus was given was
[1:36:25] his given name. Christ was his title of
[1:36:28] what he was. He was the Christ. was the
[1:36:31] anointed of God when he was born.
[1:36:35] Now, the origin of the anointing, the
[1:36:37] anointing is the process
[1:36:41] that God chose to send out his creative
[1:36:46] power and plan of redemption for a
[1:36:50] fallen creation.
[1:36:54] the logos went out of God which was the
[1:36:57] Christ the anointing
[1:37:00] that went out. Now the reason I'm giving
[1:37:02] the quotes to you is because I've spoken
[1:37:05] them now I want to just substantiate
[1:37:07] them. In the beginning the Bible says
[1:37:11] was the word and the word was with God
[1:37:14] and the word was God.
[1:37:18] Paul said in Colossians, "Now whereof I
[1:37:20] am made a minister according to the
[1:37:22] dispensation of God, which is given to
[1:37:24] me for you to fulfill the word of God,
[1:37:28] even the mystery." I want you to hold on
[1:37:30] to that. Even the mystery which hath
[1:37:33] been hid from ages and from generations,
[1:37:37] but now is made manifest to his saints.
[1:37:39] I want you to stop there for a moment.
[1:37:41] It's now made manifest, but that doesn't
[1:37:43] mean you see it.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:37:47] It's now made manifest. It doesn't mean
[1:37:49] that the Colossians saw it.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He was simply saying this is made
[1:37:53] perfectly visible. God has made it
[1:37:56] visible, but it doesn't mean that the
[1:37:58] people even in this day 2,000 years
[1:38:00] later doesn't mean at all that people
[1:38:03] see it. God has ma God has been made
[1:38:05] manifest, but now it's made manifest to
[1:38:08] his saints. And if you read Colossians 1
[1:38:12] and1, you'll find out it is just to the
[1:38:14] saints. Before I go any further, just
[1:38:16] listen. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:38:19] by the will of God, and Timoththeus, our
[1:38:23] brother, to the saints. The book of
[1:38:25] Colossians isn't to the world. It's to
[1:38:28] the saints and the faithful brethren in
[1:38:32] Christ, which are at Colasse. Grace be
[1:38:35] unto you and peace from God our Father
[1:38:38] and the Lord Jesus Christ. This is who
[1:38:40] it's to. It's to the faithful brethren,
[1:38:42] to the saints that are there. And that
[1:38:44] is why I'm preaching this to you this
[1:38:46] morning. I preach to you as saints of
[1:38:48] God, called of God. But you may have
[1:38:50] been raised in a Christian home. You
[1:38:53] need to be very very fervent young
[1:38:55] people. You need to be very very
[1:38:57] fervent. Even parents, you need to be
[1:38:59] very very fervent to the entire
[1:39:01] congregation that if if there is a a
[1:39:05] shadow of doubt or question in your
[1:39:07] mind, you need to say, "God, grant to me
[1:39:11] by your sovereign grace, a revelation of
[1:39:14] what has happened. Not in the past, not
[1:39:16] Calvary back there, not back John the
[1:39:19] Baptist, but what happened in my time.
[1:39:21] Give me a sovereign revelation of who
[1:39:24] this is." And I know that it's God, but
[1:39:26] let let me let let it be ingrained
[1:39:29] within every fiber of my body.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; God in my time.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Notice the next verse. Now, to whom God
[1:39:40] would make known to whom? To the saints
[1:39:43] and to the faithful. He would make known
[1:39:46] what is the riches of the glory of this
[1:39:51] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[1:39:54] Christ in you the hope of glory precious
[1:39:59] friends Christ people quote that
[1:40:02] scripture but Christ in you happens to
[1:40:06] be a mystery
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; and it is such a mystery that we
[1:40:11] ourselves humanly speaking have a good
[1:40:14] deal of difficulty fully identifying
[1:40:17] God in our lives. Sometimes I sit down
[1:40:20] with people and they say, "Brother
[1:40:22] brother Biscoll, this is this is what's
[1:40:24] happening. This is happening. This this
[1:40:25] this." You know what? I don't know
[1:40:28] whether it's God or whether it's just me
[1:40:31] or whether it's the devil.
[1:40:36] Hey, you're all quiet because most
[1:40:39] everybody gets there sometime or other.
[1:40:41] Is this God in my life? Did God bring
[1:40:43] this up or is it just my own desires? Is
[1:40:46] it my own just, you know, something that
[1:40:47] I want or is it the devil that's that's
[1:40:50] leading me into a trap? It's very
[1:40:52] important to know.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And I would say the best guide say what
[1:40:56] do we do at a time like that? Don't
[1:40:58] leave us hanging out on a limb. If I
[1:41:00] were you, I would do what I do and that
[1:41:03] is that I go to the message and I absorb
[1:41:07] the prophet's message because that's the
[1:41:09] message for this hour. the end time
[1:41:12] message meets the end time conditions.
[1:41:15] Can you say amen to that? And we have
[1:41:18] end time conditions today that didn't
[1:41:20] that didn't exist here not very long
[1:41:22] ago. But we need a message for this
[1:41:25] hour. A message that gives us insight
[1:41:28] what to do and a message that meets the
[1:41:30] end time conditions.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Christ in us is indeed a a a mystery.
[1:41:37] Now in Christ is the mystery God
[1:41:39] revealed. I'm going to It happens to be
[1:41:42] a a key keynote milestone message
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; and I can tell you I've been through it
[1:41:48] many, many times
[1:41:51] in my life. And brother Brandham says
[1:41:53] more there in the first 20 pages than
[1:41:57] you'd hear in years of Bible school.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Fact is, you'd never get it there.
[1:42:05] God's secret mystery that he had before
[1:42:08] the world began. And now I ask for your
[1:42:10] undivided attention.
[1:42:13] The secret mystery that he had before
[1:42:15] the world began. In the back part of
[1:42:19] God's mind, there was something that he
[1:42:21] was trying
[1:42:24] and was going to achieve.
[1:42:27] And he had a motive in doing it. This is
[1:42:30] the motive. in order to let himself be
[1:42:34] expressed.
[1:42:36] Now, just for a moment, here's a great
[1:42:39] self-existent one. Let your imagination,
[1:42:42] your mind go in this direction. The
[1:42:45] great almighty ex self-existent one who
[1:42:48] fills all time and space. Could not even
[1:42:51] be defined, could not even be described.
[1:42:54] It would be far too mysterious. He fills
[1:42:57] all time and space. and and and he said
[1:43:00] if you went on into the infinite into
[1:43:02] the trillions and trillions of light
[1:43:04] years of space,
[1:43:06] you still couldn't discover him. This
[1:43:08] kind of a God, this kind of a being. So,
[1:43:10] we're not here to try to figure out what
[1:43:13] he's like. We're here to acknowledge
[1:43:16] that there is a God
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; and this is what he's like and he fills
[1:43:20] all time and space, but in him
[1:43:25] we're attributes. In him,
[1:43:28] we're qualities. in him
[1:43:34] was a determination.
[1:43:39] And believe me, friends, maybe God
[1:43:41] expressed parts of himself in the
[1:43:44] universe,
[1:43:46] I don't know. But in him,
[1:43:49] and brother Brandham describes it so
[1:43:51] clearly, and I mentioned Wednesday, but
[1:43:54] I want to really emphasize it. He wanted
[1:43:57] to express himself.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; And you may want to express yourself,
[1:44:03] but there's a certain spec specific type
[1:44:06] of expression.
[1:44:09] He wanted to be a father.
[1:44:14] I want to be a father.
[1:44:20] And brother Brandham goes on to say,
[1:44:21] "The only way the only way that he could
[1:44:25] do that is that he himself became a son
[1:44:29] of man."
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; He knew all about the fall. He knew the
[1:44:34] fall would take place.
[1:44:37] He knew the world would come into the
[1:44:38] corruption that it has. He knew how it
[1:44:41] would fall.
[1:44:43] And so he would come and begin to
[1:44:46] create. can imagine. Brother Brandman
[1:44:48] says that God's greatness is not because
[1:44:51] he can do great things but he can become
[1:44:54] so small.
[1:44:57] And it is amazing, is it not, that
[1:44:59] science today, they're trying to find
[1:45:03] the the smallest, the most uh the
[1:45:07] tiniest uh even microscopic and beyond
[1:45:11] that if they feel if they could get to
[1:45:14] to quarks and beyond that and they said
[1:45:17] they haven't been able to maybe they
[1:45:19] have now, but last I read they hadn't
[1:45:20] been able to actually see visibly a
[1:45:23] quark, but they can see its effect and
[1:45:25] they're causing it to to to to its
[1:45:27] effect on other material things. And so
[1:45:30] they know that that power exists there.
[1:45:32] They said if they could just break the
[1:45:34] secret of the tiniest thing. They feel
[1:45:36] it will unlock the entire universe.
[1:45:40] If they could just find the smallest
[1:45:42] secret. Well, I tell you what,
[1:45:44] God became so small
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; and he and he had to begin a new
[1:45:50] creation
[1:45:51] and he came he he became a cell. And you
[1:45:54] have you have hundreds of millions and
[1:45:56] perhaps billions of cells in your body.
[1:45:58] God became a cell
[1:46:01] and he began a new creation. And because
[1:46:04] sin had come through a sexual
[1:46:08] transgression, the original sin, he's
[1:46:12] going to reverse it and come by a a cell
[1:46:16] lodged in the womb of a woman that
[1:46:18] believed. Be it unto me, as the angel
[1:46:21] told her, and you're going to conceive,
[1:46:23] and that thing that is in you shall be
[1:46:25] called the son of God,
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; a new creation, and lodged to the and
[1:46:31] and and lodged to the womb of that
[1:46:33] woman, and a child was born
[1:46:37] called Jesus.
[1:46:40] And he shall be called Jesus, the
[1:46:42] Christ, for he will be the anointed one.
[1:46:45] Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Because God will pour all that he is
[1:46:49] into that one
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; and he shall be he shall be the complete
[1:46:54] godhead bodily.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; He shall walk among men and manifest God
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; in such clarity.
[1:47:03] It's
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; true.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Irrefutable proof he will do that.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Follow me.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; But then amongst all of the things he
[1:47:11] did and I don't want to enlarge on that.
[1:47:13] He comes to towards the end of his
[1:47:15] ministry
[1:47:17] perhaps. I wish I was standing there
[1:47:18] that day. I wish you could have been
[1:47:19] also. Maybe he just looked over the
[1:47:23] people that were with him or his
[1:47:24] disciples. And he said,
[1:47:28] "When you see the days of Noah
[1:47:31] again, and when you see the days of
[1:47:34] Sodom and Gomorrah again on the earth,
[1:47:37] even so will it be when the son of man,"
[1:47:40] and they knew that he was the son of
[1:47:42] man. Now listen, stay back now to the
[1:47:46] quote.
[1:47:48] He loved fatherhood.
[1:47:50] God, he he the secret that was in the
[1:47:52] back part of his mind. I I'm I must
[1:47:55] express myself and the only way I can
[1:47:58] express myself fully is through a son of
[1:48:02] man.
[1:48:04] And the apex, oh, I don't know if you
[1:48:07] see it as I'm saying it. God help me.
[1:48:10] The apex, the pinnacle of that
[1:48:12] expression that was in the back part of
[1:48:14] God's mind is that he in his personal
[1:48:17] presence personal presence could embody
[1:48:20] himself and stand here God almighty on
[1:48:24] the earth
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; in a man called Jesus Christ. And this
[1:48:30] man said
[1:48:33] because he had a very local ministry
[1:48:36] in Palestine, even said to his
[1:48:38] disciples, don't go to those other
[1:48:40] places.
[1:48:42] Go to the lost sheep of the house of
[1:48:44] Israel. But when you see these
[1:48:46] conditions
[1:48:48] all over the earth, even so shall it be,
[1:48:52] when the son of man, when I again will
[1:48:54] be revealed.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. Don't let it just go off
[1:49:00] your lips lightly. What Jesus is saying,
[1:49:03] there will be another manifestation
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; and this manifestation will be the
[1:49:08] manifestation of the son of man. And I
[1:49:10] am that son of man. They knew he was
[1:49:12] that son of man. I am that son of man.
[1:49:16] And when you see these conditions, this
[1:49:19] same work will be taking place again.
[1:49:22] And it will not be a man, but it will be
[1:49:24] God through the man because God was in
[1:49:28] Christ and Christ was in the church.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; God is in Christ and Christ is in you.
[1:49:36] And this is the great mystery that
[1:49:37] apostle Paul is speaking about this
[1:49:40] great mystery which is Christ in you.
[1:49:43] The hope of glory
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; and incidentally that's the only hope of
[1:49:47] glory.
[1:49:49] And furthermore, he even identified the
[1:49:51] people that this would happen in. He
[1:49:52] said it would be the Gentiles.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; The last was the Jews, but this was the
[1:49:59] Gentiles.
[1:50:01] This great mystery amongst the Gentiles,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; which will be Christ in you,
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory. And we go through all
[1:50:08] of this.
[1:50:10] Read your history, friends. You and I
[1:50:12] are going to stand before God of
[1:50:13] judgment.
[1:50:15] And I'm going to give account of what
[1:50:16] I'm speaking. And you're going to give
[1:50:18] account of what you're hearing
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; and how you're receiving it.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; And if it's false, then I'm going to be
[1:50:27] judged. If it's true and you've refused
[1:50:29] it, you're going to be judged.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You want to hold very, very closely.
[1:50:33] Amen.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; And God determined
[1:50:38] that there would be another period of
[1:50:40] time when the world would have evolved
[1:50:43] and have come to a place of its
[1:50:45] sophistication, its culture, its
[1:50:48] learning, its power, when superpowers,
[1:50:51] when have we had superpowers like this?
[1:50:53] When has man come to a place we can
[1:50:55] destroy the very earth he stands on?
[1:50:57] When has he gotten this hydrogen and
[1:50:59] this nuclear power? When has he gotten
[1:51:02] all of this and and and such divisive
[1:51:04] things and such devious minds when Satan
[1:51:08] himself has come to the earth as it
[1:51:10] were? When perversion is absolutely
[1:51:12] everywhere.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And speaking about perversion,
[1:51:17] you might speak about the streets of
[1:51:19] Seattle or Vancouver, Bellingham. I'll
[1:51:21] tell you where the greatest perversion
[1:51:23] is.
[1:51:28] Do you know why brother Brandham
[1:51:29] preached why I am against
[1:51:33] organized religion
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; is because that happens to be the
[1:51:37] greatest act of an illicit affair.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus the man Christ
[1:51:47] was also the seed. Jesus was the word.
[1:51:51] Jesus
[1:51:53] is this word. He is the word.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Are you right?
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word and that word is the
[1:52:02] seed and the called out, the elected is
[1:52:05] the woman who receives the seed, becomes
[1:52:09] pregnantated with the word and receives
[1:52:12] and brings forth life according to this
[1:52:14] word.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; That is a true relationship. But now
[1:52:20] there became a proliferation
[1:52:22] of organized church from a mother
[1:52:25] church. The first one to break away
[1:52:27] which happened to be the Roman Catholic
[1:52:29] Church. I won't say Roman. It was the
[1:52:31] Catholic Church which was universal
[1:52:33] became Roman nicely of Rome and invented
[1:52:35] the trinity.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You can find it. You can't find the word
[1:52:39] trinity in this book.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; You come and find the word trinity in
[1:52:43] this book. I'll give you a half a
[1:52:44] million dollars for every time you find
[1:52:46] the word trinity spoken in the
[1:52:48] scripture. It is not there. I defy
[1:52:52] anybody to find it. Furthermore, there's
[1:52:54] not one single time anybody between this
[1:52:57] cover and this cover ever been baptized
[1:52:59] in water in the name of the father, son,
[1:53:02] and holy ghost.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Because the father is not a name, the
[1:53:06] son is not a name, and the holy ghost is
[1:53:09] not a name. And that's why in the
[1:53:11] scripture in Revelation, they took away
[1:53:13] the name. They took away the name from
[1:53:15] the people. Do you know that the church
[1:53:17] of Jesus Christ is Mrs. Jesus?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; And if there's a woman that if I if I
[1:53:22] had a woman that would stand here at the
[1:53:24] altar and say to me, I'll take you as my
[1:53:27] husband, but I will not receive your
[1:53:29] name. I say you're not receiving me
[1:53:31] either. I am my name. That is who I am.
[1:53:35] That is my person. If you won't receive
[1:53:37] my name, you're not receiving me. And
[1:53:40] people say, "We won't take his name."
[1:53:41] Oh, I love Jesus. Oh, yeah. I love
[1:53:43] Jesus. Will you be baptized in his name?
[1:53:45] No.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; You know what he says? And I don't
[1:53:49] receive you.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You got to be baptized in his name.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; There's not one person in this cover.
[1:53:56] And I've asked these trinitarians,
[1:53:58] "Where did you get that?" Well, they
[1:54:00] said it was a an a an accumulation. I'll
[1:54:04] call it a conglomeration.
[1:54:06] of man's thoughts, man's idea, and they
[1:54:09] kind of got I said, "Where do you see a
[1:54:10] trinity?" Well, Jesus was standing on
[1:54:12] earth. Yes, he was. And and and a dove
[1:54:15] from heaven. You're going to call the
[1:54:16] dove. The dove The Holy Spirit descended
[1:54:19] as a dove.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; And the dove is not the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:23] That form, that's not the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:26] He He descended as a dove.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; And the father spoke out
[1:54:36] one God manifesting himself. He can
[1:54:39] manifest. I can show you in the Old
[1:54:41] Testament where he manifested himself.
[1:54:43] He manifested himself as Elohim in a
[1:54:45] body to Abraham. And Abraham our father
[1:54:48] in the faith said, "Lord,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Lord," and it was God.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Not the fourth person.
[1:54:58] And then Gideon saw another one and knew
[1:55:00] it was God. He said, "I'm going to die
[1:55:03] because I've seen God." It wasn't the
[1:55:04] fifth person.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know where this service is going
[1:55:12] to go. You understand? I don't know how
[1:55:15] many places or times that it'll be seen
[1:55:17] or heard. But I can tell you friends,
[1:55:20] it's time that we just really, really
[1:55:22] know
[1:55:24] what we believe, but why we believe it.
[1:55:27] You hear the serpent seed, you want to
[1:55:28] know why you believe the serpent seed.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; And and a denominational
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; we just say, well, denomination, a lot
[1:55:37] of a lot of folk even right here, you
[1:55:40] don't even know why that's an issue. Do
[1:55:42] you know why it's an issue? Is because
[1:55:45] the doctrine, hear me close, the
[1:55:48] doctrine of the church is the seed
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; which he has received.
[1:55:56] And as the seed which she has received,
[1:55:59] that's the only life that she can bring.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; And so the church is the woman and the
[1:56:04] seed is the man.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; This church, we've been asked even just
[1:56:10] recently for our articles of faith. I
[1:56:12] said it's between two black covers.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; This is our articles of faith. We don't
[1:56:17] have any articles of faith. Any other
[1:56:19] articles of faith? This is what we
[1:56:21] believe from cover to cover.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; But if you have a articles of faith or
[1:56:29] the creed of the apostles or or the
[1:56:31] creed or the traditions and the dogmas
[1:56:33] and everything else is a great big
[1:56:35] article of faith, that thing actually
[1:56:37] turns the church into a prostitute.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Because it's a seed.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; It's a perverted seed. And that's what
[1:56:46] would take place in this generation.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; It has to be that way, friends. It has
[1:56:55] to be. That is why even when a messenger
[1:56:57] come out there's about 900
[1:56:59] denominations. Why is there a
[1:57:01] proliferation of denominations? Because
[1:57:03] number one, the spirit of Leodysia is
[1:57:06] the spirit of people's own rights. We'll
[1:57:07] believe what we want to believe.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Even people in the message say, "Well, I
[1:57:12] don't agree with that. I I'm off on my
[1:57:14] own. You can collect a handful of people
[1:57:16] around you or a whole bunch of people
[1:57:17] around you. Doesn't doesn't bother me.
[1:57:19] One iota. People have to have their own
[1:57:22] diet and eat what you want to eat. But
[1:57:24] as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to
[1:57:26] eat the entire council of the message of
[1:57:28] word of God without any slant, without
[1:57:31] any special uh a special doctrine to it
[1:57:34] or teaching or anything else. I want to
[1:57:36] receive the pure seed.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; Help me out for a few moments.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] in order to let himself be expressed.
[1:57:48] The secret is hidden or masked in the
[1:57:52] expression. In other words, it can be
[1:57:54] expressed but it's still not clearly
[1:57:56] seen. It's not visible.
[1:57:59] Now, if he had this three-fold,
[1:58:02] we want to find out what is this
[1:58:05] three-fold purpose. The first thing was
[1:58:08] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:58:12] people. It sounds repetitious, but it's
[1:58:14] not. God had a purpose and a hidden
[1:58:18] mystery. And that's what I want to speak
[1:58:21] on to the church this morning for those
[1:58:23] of you believers of the message. Listen
[1:58:25] now, the hidden mystery of God that he
[1:58:28] had in his mind before the world ever
[1:58:30] began. Follow very closely, please. and
[1:58:33] how that it what the mystery of God has
[1:58:40] unfolded
[1:58:42] right down to this present hour.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:47] and that that we're living
[1:58:51] then you will understand clearly then on
[1:58:53] I believe what is being done
[1:58:57] God's great mystery of how it's a secret
[1:59:01] and he kept it a secret
[1:59:04] now this these are not just words to
[1:59:07] keep things vague
[1:59:11] nobody knew nothing about it
[1:59:14] even the angels didn't understand it.
[1:59:17] He didn't reveal it. And that's the
[1:59:19] reason under the seventh seal, those of
[1:59:22] you are believers of the message, the
[1:59:24] seventh seal is his coming.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; And so he said even under the seventh
[1:59:29] seal, when the seventh seal was opened,
[1:59:32] there was silence. So even when the
[1:59:35] seventh seal, you read it in the
[1:59:36] scriptures, was opened, it was silent.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But of that day, and I read the
[1:59:41] scripture now, Jesus speaking of that
[1:59:43] day and hour, knoweth no man, know not
[1:59:47] the angels of heaven, but my father
[1:59:49] only. The reason I put the scripture,
[1:59:51] inserted the scripture in here is
[1:59:53] because this is the scripture that
[1:59:55] brother Brandham is referring back to.
[1:59:57] This is the secret. What is the great
[1:59:59] secret? It the secret is the coming.
[2:00:02] Amen.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now, this may shock you a little bit and
[2:00:08] I don't want you to take and jump off a
[2:00:11] deep end.
[2:00:14] But if Christ's first coming could come
[2:00:17] happen, he's birthed, supernatural, a
[2:00:21] new creation of God, God himself
[2:00:24] becoming a cell in a womb of a virgin
[2:00:26] woman. And he's born and he lives his
[2:00:28] life. He lives for 30 years. He starts
[2:00:31] calling people. He begins to do
[2:00:33] miracles. He heals uh Peter's uh
[2:00:35] mother-in-law of a fever. Turns the
[2:00:38] water into wine. Begins to send his
[2:00:40] word. And the Bible says healed all of
[2:00:42] them. Even pl people in distant places
[2:00:45] and the centurion and the woman that
[2:00:47] touched the hem of his garment and the
[2:00:49] blind man standing crying. If thou wilt,
[2:00:52] thou can make me whole. I will be thou
[2:00:54] whole. casting out the demons out of the
[2:00:57] out of the maniac of the gatherines and
[2:00:59] in a small area just a profusion of the
[2:01:04] power of God concentrated what was it
[2:01:06] the personal presence of almighty God
[2:01:08] having visited a place and to come and
[2:01:11] offer the body as a redemption for the
[2:01:14] lost world
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; and all of this could take place you
[2:01:18] talk about manifestation
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; but they didn't catch
[2:01:24] And then the disciples,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; they became, listen now, part of the
[2:01:30] first coming.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; They became an actual part. They became
[2:01:36] a voice.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; This is our voice.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; We witness to you that he rose from the
[2:01:43] dead.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; This is the witness of his resurrection.
[2:01:47] Did the whole world hear it? No. No,
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; but they were actually a part of they
[2:01:53] were giving evidence to the resurrection
[2:01:57] of Jesus Christ. Are you with me?
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to drop a bomb right here.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; The second coming of Jesus Christ
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; could be in process right at this
[2:02:07] moment.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; And the world wouldn't know it.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, drop a second bomb. The
[2:02:14] resurrection's going to take place and
[2:02:17] they're still going to have their
[2:02:18] problem with their gas and their taxes
[2:02:21] and their government and the highways
[2:02:24] and all the rest of it and their unions
[2:02:26] and the unemployment and all the rest of
[2:02:28] it. But it will already have happened.
[2:02:31] the re the resurrection and the rapture
[2:02:33] can be taking place and there'll be men
[2:02:35] standing behind the pullpit preaching
[2:02:37] and having people coming forward to
[2:02:39] receive Jesus Christ and have no idea
[2:02:42] and they'll be weeping and confessing
[2:02:43] their sins and thinking the prophet said
[2:02:46] that they're getting saved and it'll all
[2:02:48] be over.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm at.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm coming to.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what this message is
[2:02:57] all about. the great secret that God had
[2:03:00] in his mind and and and he said that
[2:03:02] even the angels didn't know anything.
[2:03:04] What was it that the angels didn't know
[2:03:06] anything about? That's that's exactly
[2:03:08] and here's this here's this messenger
[2:03:10] with this kind I I'm not here to make
[2:03:12] somebody big or make somebody small.
[2:03:15] But if there's anybody in this
[2:03:16] congregation or anybody streaming this
[2:03:18] service that can bring another ministry
[2:03:22] that even even remotely resembles that
[2:03:25] of William Brham, I challenge you to
[2:03:28] bring it to me.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I challenge
[2:03:35] you to bring it to me. I don't say that
[2:03:37] presumptuously. I don't say that with
[2:03:39] any pride. I don't I say that because it
[2:03:42] hasn't happened. And if it has happened,
[2:03:44] I want to know.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Historians can't find it.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Great people can't find it. They can't
[2:03:50] find it because it doesn't exist.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; It was God
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; who said, "I'm coming with my personal
[2:03:56] presence.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Not through not through a virgin-born
[2:03:59] son, but through a redeemed son.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come through a redeemed
[2:04:04] son.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And he's going to live in another
[2:04:06] dimension. This dimension will be in
[2:04:08] that world, this world at the same
[2:04:09] time."
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the people, he has to be
[2:04:13] in that dimension. He has to live
[2:04:16] between the two, between the seen and
[2:04:18] the unseen. He must live there because
[2:04:20] he's ministering to a group of people
[2:04:22] that are going to believe that message
[2:04:25] and go to that other dimension. He must
[2:04:28] He must express it. He must live it. He
[2:04:30] must show it.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; He must stand before them and see even
[2:04:35] see multitudes of the individuals. See,
[2:04:37] when you were young,
[2:04:40] says one woman, you're not here for
[2:04:44] yourself. You're here for your brother.
[2:04:47] Actually, it's not your brother. It's
[2:04:48] your brother-in-law.
[2:04:51] And just down specific.
[2:04:54] Get one woman. You can hear it all. This
[2:04:56] isn't private. This is all on tape.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; One woman. Oh, a poor woman.
[2:05:03] you've been before doctors and doctors
[2:05:05] and they haven't been able to find out
[2:05:07] what's wrong.
[2:05:10] And then he speaks to her privately. He
[2:05:12] says, "Can I tell them?"
[2:05:16] She said it was all right. He said,
[2:05:18] "When you were a girl, you fell down a
[2:05:22] well.
[2:05:24] When you fell down a well, it loosened
[2:05:26] your organs.
[2:05:28] tore your organs from where they are
[2:05:30] lodged
[2:05:32] and the doctors haven't been able to
[2:05:34] discover that.
[2:05:37] Who Who say that?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Who say that?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] Well, if it was a man, just say so.
[2:05:52] I'm throwing out a challenge to this
[2:05:54] church. If it was just a man, stand up
[2:05:55] and say so. Right.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; It was the devil to stand up and say so.
[2:06:03] If it was God,
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You need to stand up and say so.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:06:16] God.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; That same Christ in you, the hope of
[2:06:24] glory. Amen.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Not another one, but God himself.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what you would need a
[2:06:33] revelation on.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; You need a revelation that's God in me.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; It was God in me that saw that. It was
[2:06:39] God in me that could acknowledge it. It
[2:06:42] was God in me.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; That allowed me to embrace it.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you for standing.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Give me another few minutes, would you
[2:06:53] please? I'm going to close.
[2:06:59] But of that day, and that hour knoweth
[2:07:00] no man, not the angels which are in
[2:07:03] heaven, neither the son, Jesus was
[2:07:05] saying in his earthly ministry, he did
[2:07:08] not know.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; It was a secret so kept to God himself.
[2:07:14] Jesus when he was on earth, they
[2:07:16] wondered, they wanted to know when he
[2:07:18] would come. going on now in the message.
[2:07:20] He said even the son himself doesn't
[2:07:22] know when it's going to happen. God has
[2:07:25] this all to himself. It's a secret and
[2:07:28] that's the reason
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; there was silence in heaven for the
[2:07:32] space. You read the scripture says and
[2:07:34] they open when he opened the seventh
[2:07:35] seal. There was silence in heaven for
[2:07:37] the space of a half an hour. People say
[2:07:39] what is that? Why did he do that?
[2:07:42] Messenger told you why? Because it was a
[2:07:45] secret
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; that God kept. God kept that secret from
[2:07:49] Jesus Christ in his earthly life. God
[2:07:52] kept that secret.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; To himself
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; and the secret was when I'm going to
[2:08:00] come with my personal presence and visit
[2:08:03] the earth.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And I won't tell anybody.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; I won't give any grand announcement.
[2:08:09] Right.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; In this first coming, angels came to the
[2:08:15] shepherds and said, "Go here." And the
[2:08:17] star to the the wise men and they went,
[2:08:20] "Where is he? Where is he that's born
[2:08:22] king of the Jews?" There will be no such
[2:08:24] a thing because it's kept a secret.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; And he tells his messenger, "Go to the
[2:08:31] wilderness. Go to the desert.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Go to Arizona." And he doesn't know why
[2:08:36] he's going.
[2:08:40] How infallible, how infallible the
[2:08:42] message is. Listen and and two months
[2:08:44] before he even goes, he preaches serious
[2:08:48] the time.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; And read it. And he announces
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; what is taking place, but he can't
[2:08:55] clearly define it. Says, I must go west.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; And he tells it specifically. And two
[2:09:01] months later, it's all happened.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's God's announcement from
[2:09:08] the heavens. The angels came in a split.
[2:09:11] He said from the eternities and they're
[2:09:13] coming. What is it? It's an announcement
[2:09:15] to the messenger that the personal
[2:09:18] presence of almighty God has come now in
[2:09:22] his second coming
[2:09:24] to initiate it, to inaugurate it, to
[2:09:27] tell the people about it, to get them
[2:09:29] believing the word that will take them
[2:09:31] out of hell.
[2:09:39] How else you going to get out?
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; How else do you expect to get out?
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; We got saved by the word, didn't we? We
[2:09:47] got healed by the word, didn't we? We
[2:09:49] get all the benefits by the word. If
[2:09:51] it's not in the word, we don't know what
[2:09:53] to believe. And it's the word that says
[2:09:55] we shall not all sleep,
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; but we shall all be changed.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I want to know if you're here. If that
[2:10:02] belongs to you,
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; we shall all be changed
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.
[2:10:09] Why do we rejoice? Because we believe
[2:10:11] the promise.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Not something just that Paul said, but
[2:10:16] something that's been fulfilled today in
[2:10:19] my hour.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; I have reason to believe it. Not merely
[2:10:26] that has been manifested. Not merely
[2:10:28] there's been a great ministry for 33
[2:10:30] years, but the ministry was the voice of
[2:10:32] God spoke something to me. I believed it
[2:10:35] and now I have become that voice.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; You become that voice.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And thus,
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; you are representative of the coming.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; You are
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; in part
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; the second coming of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; You are
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; in part the resurrection
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; because the voice of that resurrection
[2:11:02] is in you.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; You believed it.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[2:11:15] God help me.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; He's had the secret all to himself.
[2:11:23] I'm closing in just a moment. And the
[2:11:25] seven thunders uttered their voice. And
[2:11:28] and Jesus when he was here on earth,
[2:11:29] they wanted to know when he would come.
[2:11:33] He said, "Even the son doesn't know
[2:11:36] himself.
[2:11:38] God has this secret to himself."
[2:11:42] And that's why there was silence in
[2:11:43] heaven
[2:11:46] and the seven thunders. So they uttered
[2:11:48] their voices. They actually uttered
[2:11:50] their voices. And John was even
[2:11:51] forbidden to write. He was going to
[2:11:53] write and then the prophet just breaks
[2:11:55] it. He was going to write it. Write
[2:11:57] what?
[2:11:59] Prophet said so the coming the coming of
[2:12:02] the Lord.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; But because it had to remain a secret.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Even John the Apostle said was
[2:12:09] forbidden. Don't write.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Don't write because it's always been a
[2:12:13] secret. It's still a secret and it must
[2:12:16] remain a secret. But in the end time
[2:12:18] when the messenger comes I'll reveal it
[2:12:21] in that hour. And that's why he said
[2:12:24] it's unfolded. And then he says further
[2:12:27] it's unfolded slowly down through the
[2:12:29] ages. What let it unfold? The
[2:12:32] manifestation of God down through the
[2:12:34] ages. And people saw it but didn't
[2:12:36] understand what they saw.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; And so it is today.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; They saw it didn't understand fully what
[2:12:46] they saw. And when the seven thunders
[2:12:47] had uttered their vo their voices, I was
[2:12:50] about to write, this is the scripture.
[2:12:53] And I heard a voice in from heaven
[2:12:55] saying unto me, seal up those things
[2:12:58] which the seven thunders have uttered
[2:13:00] and write them not.
[2:13:04] And there's one thing there's one thing
[2:13:07] he hasn't revealed yet or how of how he
[2:13:11] will come and when he will come. It's a
[2:13:16] good thing he doesn't know. He has shown
[2:13:18] or revealed it in every type that's in
[2:13:20] the Bible. He hasn't. He said he hasn't.
[2:13:24] And people get up on this say, "Well,
[2:13:26] there's one thing he hasn't revealed
[2:13:28] yet." When he reveals it, the people
[2:13:30] don't see it anyhow. He can reveal it.
[2:13:32] He can manifest. It doesn't mean that a
[2:13:34] person sees it. He said, and then he
[2:13:37] went on to say, there's one thing he
[2:13:38] hasn't revealed yet of how he will come
[2:13:41] and when he will come. It's a good thing
[2:13:44] that he doesn't. No, he has shown it or
[2:13:48] revealed it in every type that's in the
[2:13:50] Bible.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the entire Bible, he goes on,
[2:13:57] is the revelation of God's mystery in
[2:14:00] Christ. So, he's telling where the
[2:14:02] mystery is. It is in Christ. And Christ
[2:14:04] is that power, that designated
[2:14:07] influence. It is that part of God that
[2:14:10] he he he poured out from himself.
[2:14:14] And the entire Bible is the expression
[2:14:16] of one goal that that God had. The
[2:14:19] purpose he wanted to achieve is in the
[2:14:22] entire in the entire Bible. And all the
[2:14:25] acts of the believers in the Bible has
[2:14:29] been in type and expressing what God's
[2:14:33] great goal is.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop there, but listen. I
[2:14:38] This is where I'd like to start
[2:14:39] preaching.
[2:14:41] All the acts.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; All the acts of the believers in the
[2:14:46] Bible.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Are you believers?
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; You are included in this.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; All the acts all your life
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; is an expression has been in type and
[2:14:58] expressing what God's great goal is.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; I'm closing.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Having a hard time closing.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; God was in Christ.
[2:15:10] The God that was in Christ and the and
[2:15:13] the and the and the Christ that was in
[2:15:15] Abraham. Christ was in Abraham. He says,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; "And the Christ that was in Abraham,
[2:15:21] listen to me now, was saying, I'm
[2:15:23] coming."
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; The Christ that was in Isaac was saying,
[2:15:28] "I'm coming."
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; The Christ that was in Joseph was
[2:15:31] saying, "I'm coming."
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; The Christ that was in David was saying,
[2:15:35] "I'm coming, and when I come, I'll be a
[2:15:37] king."
[2:15:38] And
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; the Christ was in Samuel was saying,
[2:15:40] "I'm coming and when I come, I'll be
[2:15:42] rejected." Hallelujah. The It was in
[2:15:46] Solomon. And the one that received peace
[2:15:48] and had all the intelligence and the
[2:15:50] wisdom. So the Christ all the way down
[2:15:53] was in coming. But when he and and those
[2:15:55] and those apostles, those believers were
[2:15:58] give evidence to the message for their
[2:16:01] season.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? But when Jesus
[2:16:04] came and was born, those that had the
[2:16:07] revelation that that was him, they said,
[2:16:10] "Come and see who we have found."
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Not one coming.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Not one of the past, but one that's here
[2:16:20] now.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; This is your message, folks. This is
[2:16:26] your message. We're not talking about
[2:16:27] one coming or one there. Our life is
[2:16:30] saying he's here.
[2:16:33] I can live the life I live because
[2:16:35] Christ is in me.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; In his second coming, in his resurrected
[2:16:41] power, in his life,
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; he's in me.
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; All the acts could only say what the
[2:16:50] word said for this. And the message I'm
[2:16:51] reading to you now is the word for this
[2:16:53] hour.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; And that's the only thing you can
[2:16:56] express.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; You can't express anything else.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; That's all you can express.
[2:17:03] Oh my
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my God help us.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; All the acts of the believers in the
[2:17:22] Bible
[2:17:25] has been expressing God's great goal.
[2:17:27] And now in this last day, he has
[2:17:30] revealed it and shows it.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; He has revealed it. Not everybody sees
[2:17:37] it. Not everybody catch it. Cuz God can
[2:17:40] reveal it. But you have to catch that
[2:17:42] revelation.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; And if you have not caught it, say, "Oh,
[2:17:46] God, something this morning, that
[2:17:48] preacher saying something. I need more
[2:17:50] of you. I need more." Send that Holy
[2:17:53] Spirit. One baptism, many filling.
[2:17:55] Reveal yourself. Reveal the God that's
[2:17:58] in me. Reveal why I'm here. Reveal what
[2:18:01] your purpose is in my life. Reveal my
[2:18:04] place in the body of Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, my folks, my dear friends, is
[2:18:11] going to be people just like you sitting
[2:18:13] here this morning going to step into the
[2:18:16] resurrected ones.
[2:18:18] Yes, sir. Many bodies of the saints were
[2:18:22] seen on the streets of Jerusalem.
[2:18:24] Did Caiaphas see it? Did Herod see it?
[2:18:27] Did the Romans see it? Did the Jews see
[2:18:29] it? Did the Samaritans see it? No,
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; they did not see it.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; But Matthew saw it because he wrote
[2:18:36] about it.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; And they were seen in the streets of
[2:18:38] Jerusalem.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; Many bodies. Not a few. Many bodies.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; And we've got a promise right here.
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; A promise that they shall rise. Those
[2:18:47] that are asleep in Christ shall rise.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the same group.
[2:18:53] the group that received the revelation
[2:18:55] that God was revealing. God was
[2:18:57] revealing it. God was manifesting it.
[2:18:59] But there have to be a reciprocal uh
[2:19:02] action on the other end that you must
[2:19:04] catch the revelation. And then you're in
[2:19:06] a position for all
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; of the benefit.
[2:19:12] Hallelujah.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Just as sure as I'm standing here
[2:19:15] speaking to you,
[2:19:17] there's going to be people, I believe
[2:19:18] there's going to be people right here.
[2:19:20] is not who he spooks any more than the
[2:19:22] resurrection of Jesus Christ was who he
[2:19:24] spooks.
[2:19:26] They're gonna be walking along like Mary
[2:19:30] in the garden looked on Jesus.
[2:19:34] Hey folks, you got good minds.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Catch this.
[2:19:40] The manifested word
[2:19:42] in Jesus Christ at that moment had
[2:19:46] overcome all the power of death.
[2:19:50] had already stripped Satan of the keys
[2:19:53] of death, hell, and the grave
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; and was standing there the victorious
[2:19:56] one
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; and looked like a gardener.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; So much so that the woman Mary
[2:20:11] sir,
[2:20:13] where have you taken him
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; so I can go to him? She in her sincerity
[2:20:19] and with the message she believed and if
[2:20:21] you'd have gone to her and said do you
[2:20:22] believe it I have believe every word of
[2:20:24] it you give your life I'll give every I
[2:20:26] give my life I give every ounce of
[2:20:28] strength I have to it well the thing is
[2:20:31] the manifestation of God in Christ has
[2:20:34] just changed
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; he stands here in front of you
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; sir
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; thank God he knows how to do something
[2:20:42] familiar
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; where have you taken him she wanted to
[2:20:46] go she wanted to bring spice says she
[2:20:48] wanted to do something. That was what
[2:20:50] was in her heart. It only took one word,
[2:20:53] her name.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; Mary.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to hear him.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; I want to hear my name.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's stand, shall we? Oh,
[2:21:05] thank you, Lord. We just want to hear
[2:21:08] our name, Lord. And we'll answer. As Job
[2:21:12] has said, you'll call and I will answer
[2:21:15] thee. Oh God, call our name. Somebody
[2:21:20] here, Lord, is in need, in need of the
[2:21:23] Holy Spirit to bring them a divine
[2:21:26] uncction, a divine understanding. Lord,
[2:21:29] don't let the atmosphere, don't let it
[2:21:31] wither away. I pray that it'll remain
[2:21:33] intense upon the hearts of the people.
[2:21:36] Father, I ask oh God that you will give
[2:21:39] them not only a desire but may they have
[2:21:42] such a hunger, such a thirsting after
[2:21:45] you that they may follow through. And
[2:21:48] Lord, if they don't receive today what
[2:21:50] they're to satisfy their hunger, may
[2:21:52] they be there on tomorrow. May they be
[2:21:54] with their Bible. May they be on their
[2:21:56] knees. May they be listening to this
[2:21:58] voice, oh God, and reveal yourself to
[2:22:01] them. I pray
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:22:06] in Jesus name. I wonder brother Rod if
[2:22:11] we could sing He knows my name.
[2:22:20] I'm good to remember. He knows my name.
[2:22:22] He knows why.
[2:22:31] I have a maker.
[2:22:38] He formed
[2:22:40] my heart.
[2:22:45] And before even time began,
[2:22:51] my life was in his hand.
[2:22:59] He knows my name.
[2:23:06] He
[2:23:10] thought
[2:23:13] he
[2:23:15] each
[2:23:17] fall
[2:23:19] and hear me
[2:23:22] I call
[2:23:26] and I have a father.
[2:23:31] What a loving father.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; He calls me his own.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you. He'll never leave me. He'll
[2:23:43] never leave me. He never leave. No
[2:23:46] matter.
[2:23:54] He know
[2:24:00] he know
[2:24:07] he sees each tears that fall
[2:24:12] and hear me.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; I have a father. I have a father
[2:24:20] and I have a father.
[2:24:25] his dear lovely father. He calls me his
[2:24:30] soul. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:24:33] And he'll never leave me.
[2:24:38] Glory.
[2:24:51] He knows. He knows my
[2:24:56] thought. And he sees he sleep
[2:25:02] that falls
[2:25:04] and hear me when I go.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; He knows your name.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; He knows your name. He's your father.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Father.
[2:25:27] how our Lord Jesus taught us also to
[2:25:30] pray by beginning to say, "Our heavenly
[2:25:34] father,
[2:25:36] we are here, Lord, because you love
[2:25:38] fatherhood."
[2:25:40] We're here because you sent and made a
[2:25:42] way for us and you didn't want to see
[2:25:44] us.
[2:25:46] He didn't want to see us to be
[2:25:50] in such a a turmoil and see Satan taken,
[2:25:57] so abuse.
[2:25:59] And we see people today so abused.
[2:26:02] Their minds are torn and twisted.
[2:26:06] There's great fear that dominates them
[2:26:09] and controls them.
[2:26:12] You came so they can be free from that
[2:26:14] fear.
[2:26:16] There may be someone here today or more
[2:26:18] than one that is needing a healing in
[2:26:21] their mind.
[2:26:23] Lord, I pray that you'll send that
[2:26:25] spirit that I have sent so powerfully
[2:26:28] here today. That you'll confirm this
[2:26:31] word to them. Oh God, perhaps someone
[2:26:34] else may be doubting their position,
[2:26:37] their sunship, or their place as a
[2:26:39] daughter of Christ.
[2:26:41] Oh God, Satan has no right to bring that
[2:26:44] kind of fear and doubt to them because
[2:26:47] we have a message that has come to
[2:26:49] remove and lift the fear off the people.
[2:26:52] And in the name of Jesus Christ, Satan,
[2:26:54] I rebuke you. Command you to have no
[2:26:58] place, no right, no foothold. This is
[2:27:01] the purchase of God through the blood of
[2:27:03] Jesus Christ.
[2:27:05] Lord, I pray that there will be such a
[2:27:08] presence, your personal presence to go
[2:27:11] with the people. May they ponder what
[2:27:14] they've heard. May they get rest to
[2:27:16] their bodies and come and hear what the
[2:27:18] servant of God shall speak this evening.
[2:27:21] Lord, this is your day and we give the
[2:27:24] whole day to you. I pray you'll watch
[2:27:26] over. Father your word now that it may
[2:27:29] bring forth, bring forth a hundfold
[2:27:34] in Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us, I
[2:27:37] pray. Amen.
[2:27:41] God bless you. May God's love be upon
[2:27:44] you and his face shine on you. Lord
[2:27:47] willing, we'll see you this evening at
[2:27:48] 5:00. Come early for a good seat. You're
[2:27:51] dismissed. God bless you.
[2:28:18] Heat. Heat.
[2:28:57] Oh
[2:29:05] yeah. Heat. Heat.
[2:29:52] Hallelujah.
[2:29:57] We don't
[2:30:22] precious.
[2:30:44] God
[2:31:10] Dear
[2:31:20] Glory
[2:31:21] to you.
[2:31:40] Jesus
[2:31:56] The seasonal
[2:32:28] We are
[2:32:49] glory.
[2:33:56] Do you ride?
