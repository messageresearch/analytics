TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Just one quick announcement. Uh it's a car Washington plates 144 RFL. Your lights are on. Amen. Can we surrender our lives to the Lord this morning? Man, I was reading this morning, brother Brandham said, I'd say this very day that Jesus has been turned away from tens of thousands of doors. &gt;&gt; And if the world stands before day breaks in the morning, he will be turned away from tens of thousands of other doors. The Lord Jesus, the only thing that he wants in for is to do something good for you. &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you, take away your evil, give you righteousness and goodness and mercy. You might say something like this to me, but just a minute, brother Brando. I already done that. I let Jesus in a long time ago. Well, there's no way for me to express to you how grateful I am for you letting my savior come into your heart. But is that all you did? Just let him come in. Now, what if you let me come in and said, "Now, brother Brandham, I'll let you in. I'll take your gifts. That's fine. Thank you, but I don't want you to go any farther than this door." Now that's the attitude of many Christians. You see inside the heart coming in is one thing. And after that you get into that first door in the human heart. There's other little compartments. Got little doors in there. Also, many people will let Jesus in for the sake of not being lost, but they won't let him in to be their Lord. When Jesus comes in, he wants to take control. The world's full of people that wants to let Jesus in, but then they don't want to let him in on his own basis. If they'll take his gift, sure, eternal life. You want to heal me, that's all right, Lord. I appreciate that if you heal me, but don't go messing around with me. Said, that's the way we got to let Jesus in so he can just take control. He wants to be at home with you. He wants to be welcome. He wants all you are. He wants to be your Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You prepared to hear his word this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. And more importantly, are you prepared to do what he says to you this morning? Amen. We want to prepare our hearts now. That's the reason we sing these songs, to hear the word of God. Amen. And we want the Lord to have his perfect way in our midst this morning. Let's stand as we sing. Uh may we turn to number 6:18, My Wonderful Lord. Trust you can sing these words with all your heart. Amen. is a real testimony. I have found a deep peace that I never had known and a joy this world could not afford.

We have a lot of people who are sick with the flu. Uh there's a number of requests here for uh for people who are sick with a flu. So we want to remember them this morning. And uh the Lord would just reach down to where they are and touch them. Um also uh Sister Amanda Drake has been having disc problems in her back causing uh pain, a lot of pain. We want to remember her this morning and we want to particularly remember our brother uh Edwin Dodge this morning. um apparently had a stroke and is in very serious condition in the hospital. So I want to remember our brother Dodd this morning. Amen. If you have a need, just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. Amen. If you're listening in on the internet and you've got a need, just take it before the Lord now as we agree together. Brother Kim. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, we bow in your presence this morning. Lord, it's so wonderful to be able to come into your house this morning, Lord, and let off the pressure, raise our hands to you this morning and worship you, oh God. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for your grace and your mercy that you've shown in our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, I was sitting in service this morning, Lord, thinking of the first time I came into your presence, Lord. How wonderful it was, Lord. And it's just continued to grow sweeter and sweeter since that glorious day, Lord. And Father, we come into your presence this morning with confidence, Lord, knowing that you're able to meet every need in our presence this morning. Father, you're the God that heals all of our diseases, takes away all of our infirmities, and binds up every broken heart. Oh God, we have that confidence before you this morning, Lord Jesus. We ask, Lord, that you'd move up and down every aisle. Father, may you stop at every seat and speak to every heart. Lord, each one of us as individuals has a need in our heart this morning for you, Lord. And Father, we pray Lord that as your word would come forth this morning, oh God, that it would come in such power, Lord, that it would just drive back the enemy, Lord. Father, your servant taught us that as the word comes forth, demons scatter. And Father, we just pray that the servant of the Lord this morning would just have such boldness and rest in your word this morning to be able to deliver that which you've put on his heart this morning, Father. And now, Father, we just want to take a little time this morning to worship you, Lord. Lord, to tell you how much we love you and how wonderful you've made life for us this morning, oh God. We love you this morning. We worship you. We honor you, oh God. We thank you for your grace this morning. Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Have your way in our midst this morning. We pray, Lord Jesus. May you bless each one this morning, Father. Hallelujah. Jesus, we ask these mercies in your name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. [Music] want to welcome all those who are visiting with us and uh happy to have you here with us. Special welcome this morning to Andre Chambers who's uh living down in Lyndon. Happy to have him this here this morning. Also, we want to welcome uh Junior's dad, Ernie Mandel, and uh cousin David. They're visiting from Manitoba. We're really happy to have you here as well. and any others. Want to welcome all those who are listening in on the internet. Um, I want to particularly say thank you to brother Martin Top and their family. They sent me this tie now. It's somebody I've never met before and uh, you know, it's I I it is amazing. science. You don't know how many people I put a little thing up on Facebook so I can I do travel a lot and so I I take pictures for my grandkids so they know all you know different places I'm at and so I can keep in touch with them when I'm away and so we've kind of had fun with that and you know I start getting something from somebody saying are you the song leader in Cloverdale? Yeah. and some brother from Kenya, somebody from South Africa, somebody from New Zealand, somebody from Norway, from Sweden. And and my wife says, "Do you know all these people? You got all these friends." I said, "I don't know any of these people, but they know me." And so, we want to greet you this morning. And we just, you know, the family of God, it's a big family. &gt;&gt; Amen. And don't you love the family of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. people around the world that have the same spirit that we do. Amen. One of these days, we're going to be able to fellowship with each and every one of them. Praise God. We're looking forward to it. Amen. Our brother uh Jonathan has a song this morning. Brother Jonathan, you could if you could come. And then we've got a baby dedication. Um we have one announcement this morning. The American donation receipts are available to be picked up at the office after the morning and evening services. If you don't pick it up, then it will be put in the mail on Monday. So, um can do that. I'll uh maybe we could sing one chorus while brother Jonathan's getting ready. Let's sing Above all powers, above all kings. I'm thankful the king of kings became our savior above all powers above all kings above all nature and all created things. It's the call [Music] and all the way back. Oh, you hear me and above all kingdoms. Oh, and above all thr and above all wonders the world has ever known. above all and treasures of the earth. Oh Lord, there's a way and to [Music] you be my soul. When you make you die on the ground, you fall and of the Lord. [Music] The sun is slowly sinking. The day is almost gone. Though darkness falls all around us, still we must journey on. The darkest hour is just before dawn. The narrow way leads home. Lay down your soul at Jesus feet. The darkest hour is just before dawn. Like a shepher out on the mountain, watching the sheep down below. He's coming back to take us. Will you be ready to go? The darkest hour is just before dawn. The narrow way leads home. Lay down your soul at Jesus feet. The darkest hour is just before dawn. The darkest hour is just before dawn. The narrow way leads home. Lay down your soul at Jesus feet. The darkest hour is just before dawn. Lay down your soul at Jesus feet. The darkest hour is just before dawn. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Jonathan. Thankful we have a shepherd. Amen. That watches over us. We're going to have a baby dedication at this time. and brother Ivan, Sister Asenth are going to bring their little one as they come. Let's sing uh song we learned last Sunday. Uh may we sing the first verse in the chorus, Unseen Hand. Man, I'm glad for that unseen hand. Man, he protects me, protects our children, leads us and guide us. I remember almost 20 years ago driving down the hill right here. Car came through a stop sign and I had Jake in the car in the seat beside me. T-boned us, hit Jake's side. Car starts spinning around and I just just holding on and guy ran a stop sign, hit us and lady come out of the car after we come to a stop, she said, "That's the best driving I've ever seen in my life." I said, "Wasn't me driving." So I had the pilot driving. Amen. An unseen hand can guide you wherever you are. Let's just sing this as brother Ivan, Sister Asenth comes. There is an unseen hand to me that leads in ways I cannot see. While I'm going through this world of hope, this hand still leads me as I go. Well, I'm trusting to the unseen hand. this we land some sweetening. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I feel enthused and happy and excited for brother Ivan, sister Azeneth, and their little one been added to their home. And I'm sure that this child is going to bring a lot of joy to them. Uh, Sister Asanth has been a privilege to have her mother and father here and uh, they've been here for I think close to a month. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Their grandparents and your parents as well. Brother Ivan's parents. Wonderful. Well, uh, this is just glorious. And it it's uh because having brother Ivan and Sister Asenth here, it only reinforces the connection of this body of believers here with China. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we we so love what's happening in China and the people in China. And brother Ivan has been he's been one of those that Jesus called. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he will send laborers &gt;&gt; into and brother Ivan has been a laborer &gt;&gt; into the harvest field. I was uh meditating about this dedication and this is a a little girl of course which you all can see that the Lord has given and they have called her Karita which is from charity joy beloved and ye which is joy. So it's it's uh and I pronounced that right I'm sure my my lesson in another language karita y uh the Bible says brother Ivan when they brought the children to Jesus and we refer to it so many many times but the the word of God is so rich we see something different in it all the time and the Bible says and and then when Jesus Jesus. They brought the children to Jesus and he took them up in his arms and put his hands on them and and blessed them. And I have thought so much of this word of being blessed or blessed in the Old Testament and being blessed in the New Testament. It's it's kind of a strange word with reference to a dedication because the word blessed is actually eulogy. And whenever we speak of eulogy, it's almost always at a funeral service. And at the eulogy, because eulogy is to praise and to but also to invoke blessings, but you can't do that at a funeral service. Now, these comments may sound strange, but they're not. A eulogy is speaking of the things of a person's life. And in a funeral service, they always are speaking of the things past. But today, I'm going to bless this child for its future. &gt;&gt; Not its past. Not at what it has done because it hasn't got a track record yet. It hasn't had an opportunity to come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ yet. Hasn't come to the age of accountability yet. Hasn't had the hasn't had the privilege of witnessing for Christ yet. But we're going to pray now a blessing on this child that this child will have just such a life. &gt;&gt; And that is a eulogy. And Jesus blessed the children. And I know that when he laid his hands on them and blessed them, it wasn't for their past. It was for what they were going to be in the future. And I would like to have seen and probably will never have the opportunity until we cross over to the other side. And I'm sure that we will meet some of those that he laid hands on and blessed. We will see the life that they that they lived and the and the consequence and result of that blessing. And I believe that we have been instructed and empowered. I'm a poor representative for Christ. But in hisstead, I will take this child Karita ye and bless her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I know that God who wrote these words in the scripture is here present by his holy spirit to confirm that that is exactly what's going to happen. And you as believers, brother Ivan and sister Aanth, you have given yourselves, you've separated yourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, to this message that's been revealed to you. God is making your lives fruitful. And I pray now that this child that God has given you is as your heritage and that that will be a testimony to others also. And so this is what we are going to uh pray for this child for Karita Y and that her life will indeed be a life of joy to the family and an expression of love, charity from our Lord Jesus Christ to you, brother Ivan and Sister Asenth. There's only one God that can hear us. There's only one God that can speak and there's only one God that can fulfill our prayer. Amen. Now we take Karita ye the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh how lovely this is Lord. How wonderful this is to hold this child in my arms father and in the name of Jesus Christ to bless her. I bless her with the blessings of the almighty God through Jesus Christ. I pray father now that you will hear my voice. You will give her father good health. Give her I pray oh God the testimony that when her ears hear the name of Jesus that she will respond to it. Father, I pray, oh God, that you will just uh give her, Father, the a spirit that will be so joyful to the home. I ask, oh God, that you will cause a special wisdom to be given to our sister Asenth and brother Ivan and that they will train her and instruct her in the things of God and that she may grow, dear Lord, to be a child to be a witness to be to be a real example to others. Father, now as Jesus blessed the children, I bless her with the blessings of the Almighty God and may the Holy Spirit abide upon her in Jesus Christ's name. We dedicate her to you now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you, brother Ivans. Amen. God bless you sister. God bless you. It's always a privilege. These are the heritage of the Lord. Amen. Well, welcome to everyone. all of those that are on the internet and connected by telephone or however God has allowed you to be fellowshipping with us today. We are uh we are just our hearts are thrilled at what God is doing. Uh I will be sharing some things even after the message of what God is doing, things that we're not able to show on the streaming. So we have to wait until that is over. Show you some recent things in the great nation of China. How wonderful. We have some announcements. I have been uh twice now to the sites of the seven church ages which are in Asia Minor which today to the surprise of a lot of people are all in Turkey. And uh we've had the same uh the same guide. God arranged the first time and that was when you the church sent I and my wife to Israel and then from Israel we came back through Turkey to the seven church ages, seven church age sites. Uh God arranged that the guide which we had which was just it was just marvelous. here this guide took just I and my wife the two of us and here's other big groups of people you know and milling around and I thought it was just so wonderful and here we are walking just the three of us and having you know firsthand instruction then I learned that this guide his name is Erdin he actually was a an instructor of guides for the government to instruct other guides and to his his knowledge just seems infinite and he's so uh he's just so casual and so comfortable and so easy and and almost felt like a brother right away. Uh and so then I went we went the second time last year with a family and I contacted him. He now has become vice president of a of a company uh tour company and I prevailed upon him to take us just as a family and he consented to do so and he really goes the extra mile and he he flew from his city as into Istanbul and spent almost a week with us there and so so so respectful of of our uh of our belief and faith and and uh So I spoke to him about coming here perhaps to the church and uh uh we could take uh space in the fellowship room and there might be I said there may be some people from the church that would like to at some time in the future they may not at at the same time of course but they it'll be good if you could just tell them about the seven church ages and the seven churches rather and and make a presentation and this is exactly what he's going to do and I've arranged he's going to come here and he'll be here the same weekend that uh brother Joseph Green from North Carolina is going to be here. So he is actually arriving on the 4th of February and uh we haven't uh I'm giving these dates out now. So please bear them in mind. He has enough material for two presentations. And u uh this is only to wet the appetite for those of you that at some time, it may not even be this year. It might be another another year if the Lord carries, but uh it will give you a good insight of what you could expect if you were to make a tour. Some of you young people, there may be a a young people's group that may want to go or there just may be a mixed group that may want to go. Uh there could be 25 in a group. They can take 50. They could even take more. But u he will be here uh arriving on the 4th. The first the first day that you want to leave open is the 5th uh which is Thursday the 5th. Leave it open. We haven't got the set time yet. And then we would just be you know gathering in the fellowship room and hope we have enough room for everyone. Uh, so leave the 5th open. The 6th, Friday the 6th is our first meeting with brother Joseph Green. And I wanted him to be here at the same time because I think he, Brother and Sister Green will be here. And Mike Orders, uh, their song leader for about 35 years. Uh, Brother Michael orders and his wife are also going to be here. Incidentally, just as a side issue or as a side point of interest, brother Michael Orders, if you look orders, sister orders in the if you did a search in the message, you'll find out that brother Brandham called out Michael's aunt and spoke some incredible things to her about uh about her child. And so um uh they are going to be here on the 6th, Friday the 6th. The 7th, which is Saturday, is the second is the next date you want to hold open the 7th because that would be the only second day. And then Sunday is services and Monday uh the uh 7th, 8th, 9th. So it'll be Monday the 9th. So those are the 5th and the 7th and the 9th are the three days you want to hold open because uh that up till now that appears to be the only time that Erdin will be available uh to have a presentation and uh and we might use up two of those. I have emailed him back this morning and told him that there was a pretty tight schedule and he should try to free up another couple of days. So I don't know if that's going to be possible or not, but it may well be possible. So, he's a he's a very outstanding person and uh he's uh uh someone I think that you would enjoy. And not only that, I'm anxious that he will be able to be here and be in the services because we've spoken to him very much about uh about the message and and the Lord Jesus Christ. Uh also like to make an announcement about the camp. It's not really an announcement and yet I I think I hope I'm not stepping out of line here. Uh brother Chris, but uh brother uh brother John and sister Marie Lei are going to be taking over the as um as management of uh Bible way Mount Baker Bible Way camp. And this is what we have uh this has been the vision, you know, kind of from day one that that the camp would just become a a retreat for believers. That is still my vision, &gt;&gt; a retreat for believers, a place that would be used all year round for the families of believers. Now, I took Brother Benny Perry, his wife, and the whole group out there. And when they saw when they saw the camp and the facility and saw the vision, Brother Benny said, "I'll be back. When is your camp?" I said, "Well, our family camp's in August." He says, "I'll be here for that." I said, "This can be used anytime." I said, "You folks can come if you wish." And I said, "The the you know, the buildings, we call them cabins. They're not cabins. or residences. I said, "They're all here. They're available." And it's just remarkable how, you know, you see uh you have a vision and then God just brings the people uh capable people, burdened people to to do the work and to implement, you know, his will. &gt;&gt; It's not my plan, not my program, not a church program. This is God's doing. And uh I can tell you it's just remarkable. And so under the leadership and direction of brother Chris Peterson who is a church trustee and he's been uh the one that has been taking such a senior role and now he has brother John and sister Marie Lei and they're beginning on officially on February 1. But I'd like to I just mentioned this a day or two ago and I think I think it's worth mentioning twice &gt;&gt; here. Brother John lays down Louisiana having a holiday and he just feels a witness as a spirit. Go back. Go back home and give a month of your time to the camp. His business and his whole his whole, you know, all his skills are in uh renovating and fixing things up. And if anything breaks, fix it. And he if it needs painting, paint it. And if it needs a roof, put a roof on. And oh, hey, we love those kind of people. And so he he he comes to me and he says, "The Lord laid it on my heart." And he's even identified the building. It's the biggest building there. He said," he says, "I want to gut that place." Praise the Lord. Go to it, John. It needs it. and uh and and then he gets there and then others get inspired and they all get in there and start doing it. I I had to go out and see it last week and it was uh it was just it's a new building. It's just a new building and it is so wonderful. I thought, you know, who we doing this for? He's not doing it for himself. He's not doing it for me. He's doing it for people who otherwise wouldn't even be able to afford perhaps to go there. He's doing it for them. doing it for our young people, doing it for your kids, maybe doing it for you. You might want to go there, maybe doing it for other believers, maybe doing it for some weary, weary preacher of the gospel to come there and to be able to sit and look at the trees and the woods and the forest and rest his soul. Let's go aside a little while for believers. There's not a whole lot of places that you can actually go like that. And so this has been the this has been the purpose. Brother Jack Aguary has been doing a wonderful job. Sister Karen Hendrickson in the in the kitchen and for the food and and a host of volunteers. And I just want to say that uh God bless them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother John Lei and the group. I just when I went there the other day, uh he said, you know, he said uh someone donated some doors. I heard about a place. I believe brother Madden uh let him know that there was a place that was closing down and they manufactured doors. And uh so he went there and this company this company gave gave us $20,000 worth of brand new doors. $30 wooden doors. Beautiful. I'm talking about solid wood doors, oak and all kinds of wooden doors. And I couldn't believe my I couldn't believe my ears. And he said, "They gave us all kinds of woodworking equipment." And he started naming off the woodworking with radial saws and joiners and planers and this and that for $400. And he says, "And then we have two 9 and 1/2t wide by 9 1/2t high vans that are arriving." And uh my wife and I drove out on our way home and I I said he said, "These vans are large enough to drive a forklift in." And he says, "We've been given so much stuff and and a downturn in the economy and the building places have uh surplus and they're they're willing to give." And I I just couldn't tell you. They got enough stone to go around this stone to go around fireplaces to do about nine fireplaces and and flooring for I don't know how many buildings at at flooring that's only less than 10% of what it was costing. And this is durable stuff. It's like God opened up the storehouse and says, "Here it is." &gt;&gt; And and we had to have a place to put it. And he says, "Now we got these two vans coming and they're like 48 or 50 foot long vans." And I my head is spinning. But anyway, my wife and I, we drive out of the yard and and and and we haven't gone 5 minutes and here comes a great big highway truck with this great big beautiful Allied furniture moving van on the trailer. And it looks like it just came out of the factory. It's all painted. this beautiful Allied van. And my wife says, "Well, there's one of the vans." I says, "No way. You know, this is a this allied furniture van. These things got hardwood floors in them." Yep, that was one of the vans. And the second one just like it. And they're already sitting there and uh and filled being filled with stuff. Well, I think that this congregation ought to if you're not thankful, don't come to the camp. That's the way I feel about it. I feel that God has done this. We didn't go looking for it. &gt;&gt; It was just dropped down into our lap. And so I'm I'm happy about that. &gt;&gt; I've taken a few minutes and now we're going to go to the word. And uh are you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, if we just stand and we'll just sing welcome, welcome, welcome, Holy Spirit. We welcome you. Let's make him welcome, shall we? I'll come well. [Music] Holy [Music] Ghost, we welcome you. [Music] This very power. [Music] &gt;&gt; Just before we turn to the word, let us pray once again. Dear Father, we just feel such a need of you. And yet there's such a desire, such a hunger. We can say today, Lord, and I know that I speak for many, if not all that are here, we hunger after you. We're thirsting after the waters of life. We're desiring that you will be pleased, Lord. That you will be pleased. We're not we're not attempting to please any man or any person, but we want you to be pleased. We pray that your sanction will be upon this entire day. Especially take your word. May it be your hands that take it and break it to the people. May it be your lips, oh God, that will speak and utter words that describe the very heart and bosom of Almighty God. and let the Holy Spirit deliver it to every man and woman. I pray give us revelation. Give us insight. I pray Lord the name of Jesus Christ. We're so thankful today that we know you as the author of the book. Although we may not understand every word, every scripture, but we understand what is the motive and the heart of the author. And while we're praying, Lord, I'm remembering once again our brother Edwin Dods, Sister Sally, his wife, and his their family. I'm praying for supernatural strength to come to them. I'm praying, oh God, that you will bring a deliverance to our brother Edwin, that you will cauterize the bleeding, Lord, and may it cease, Father, and may the may he be raised up again to your glory. This is our prayer. Let us touch your heart now, Father, with a simple faith. The faith of a little child in Jesus Christ's name. This would not be for anyone's glory, but for your glory. I pray that you will just hover nearby and let the supernatural atmosphere which is pregnantated with the attributes of Almighty God, may it be his portion now in Jesus Christ's name. Now anoint us to hear. Anoint me to speak for your glory. Amen. I want to read from the book of Amos. The Old Testament considered one of the minor prophets. Prophet said he was called a minor prophet but he was a rugged a rugged prophet of God. And you heard uh on Sunday, I'm sorry, on Wednesday, you heard uh the way of a true prophet. That's I did I was not feeling real well. And so I called and brother John graciously took the service uh and I wanted this tape played and I've had so many already comments from the congregation of what a blessing it was. Uh, so I'm reading the same scripture text out of the third chapter of Amos. Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken against you, oh children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, You only have I known of all the families of the earth. Therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities. Can two walk together except they be agreed? Will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he hath taken nothing? Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no jin is for him? Shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all? Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it? Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets. The lion hath roared, who will not fear. The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you'll just turn to the seventh chapter, I have one verse I would like to read from the seventh chapter. It's verse 8. And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seeest thou? And I said, a plum line. Then said the Lord, "Behold, I will set a plum line in the midst of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them anymore." May God bless his word. You have your seats. I'm sure most all of you are familiar with what a plum line is, but in case you aren't, a plum line is simply a line with a heavy weight on the end. They may use it and drop it into water to measure the depth of water, but it's most commonly uh used to to uh to line a wall or to line something up vertically. If you put a weight on the bottom of a line and then the line will remain straight and uh and and and then they they build to a plum line. And so God uh showed Amos a plum line. Said, "What do you see?" In fact is in verse 7 said, "Thus he showed me and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plum line." I should have read that verse because it kind of explains the next one. The Lord uh stood upon a wall made by a plum line with a plum line in his hand. And the Lord said to Amos, "What do you see?" And he said, "I see a plum line." And then God was saying, "I've set a plum line in Israel." uh to be uh to to just set your mind in the correct direction. Amos himself really was the the word of the Lord in Amos was the plum line. &gt;&gt; That was the plum line that God was setting. &gt;&gt; Th this is the standard. This is what we build to. &gt;&gt; And in this generation, the word of God revealed in the bride of Jesus Christ is the plum line for this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what God God is going to hold the world accountable to. Said, "You saw it. You viewed it. You saw what the line was. You saw what the standard was." And so that's God's plum line. the conditions that were existing at the time when God was showing Amos this uh Israel had actually arrived to its zenith. It had come to its place of glory. Brother Brandham calls it glamour. It was a prosperous nation. It had prospered under an idolatrous king whose name was Gerobam II. And uh Israel had prospered very much under him. Uh and the people they had a completely different standard of living than they had had in the past. Uh they they were doing well. They also were at peace with their neighboring nations. And things were going good. We're having the good life. &gt;&gt; We haven't got a lot of things to be afraid of. and uh and uh the future looks you know bright. Maybe have our ups and downs and we still have our troubles but things are okay, things are good and people could almost relax and they had become uh lovers of pleasure. Uh and this was the generation that they were in. And so uh God is saying to uh to Amos, what sayest thou? And that's my title to you today. What seeest thou? What do you see? Uh it's amazing how conditions that are around us, things that we see around us actually condition our vision. &gt;&gt; And vision I mean this is such an enormous subject I couldn't even begin to approach it hardly today. But when you when you see a certain thing, then you have a certain perception. &gt;&gt; You gain a certain understanding. That's why they say knowledge is light because when you receive knowledge, you know, you you you have understanding uh discernment uh you have direction. Decisions are made based on what we see. Now, you know, that is why the first thing that God said in the beginning, let there be light. Because God knew the creation that he was going to make. He was going to make all kinds of uh animals and fishes and fowls of the air and all kinds of creatures and then make man in his image. When he made man in his image, he had eyes &gt;&gt; and he had eyes. He needed to see and he had to have light in order to be able to see. And so there are a lot of things today that are around us that we could say are light. knowledge is light and and uh we have uh opportunities that come before us all kinds of things uh you know we that's why we go to school we go to education we have training all because we learn we learn and and that that is light to us and often that that causes us to make our make our decisions. So now there is different kinds of light and there's different kinds of seeing. And the big question today is not only what do we see but how do you see it? Uh there was a a book that was written by a a very well-known I I believe it is if I'm if I'm remembering remembering correctly uh by a very well-known speaker. He speaks to uh uh corporate uh uh corporate executives etc etc but he was talking about you know uh knowledge and so on so forth and he he talked about a and and word that maybe these are things you've heard but I just want to use it this morning a paradigm shift how that we have a paradigm shift and he told a story of a a man that was riding on a on a subway or uh or a train in New York or some big city and he's riding on this train and a man comes on the train with some small children and he sits down and this this fellow is trying to read a newspaper and the man who sits there and he's got these three small children and and they're just uncontrolled and they're all over everything and uh and causing all kinds of disturbance and the train goes on and this man's trying to read the paper the the man he keeps looking at the father of these children and he seems to be just it totally totally uh he's unaware. He's he just isn't there. He doesn't he doesn't hear his kids. He doesn't see them running and climbing all over the seats and causing a big disturbance and he just he's just not there. And and this man is just he's ready to give him a piece of his mind. He just ready to blast him and finally he says sir he says uh you know he address he says your children are are you know rather unruly etc you know and he came rather mild and a man kind of come oh he said I I'm sorry I I'm sorry he said uh uh he said you understand see he said I just came from the hospital he said and the children and my wife just passed away and the children's 's mother has has passed away. Well, just those words caused a cataclysmic paradigm shift. And then the people around that heard it and immediately they had compassion. Oh, we're so sorry. Can we help you? Can Now, a moment ago, they're ready to pound those kids. See a moment ago their their whole emotion that was caught up in the way they were seeing things. Now the scene didn't change. The scene was exactly the same. The children were exactly the same. There's the same man. Everything in the car was exactly the same. But what changed was them. &gt;&gt; The way they saw it. &gt;&gt; And this is so striking today. You know, I began to uh I I've I've thought about this for a very long time. So, I want to take my time and convey it to you. We we we see the world that we live in and the job and the places where you work and the schools that the our young people go to and the associations that we have and the the friends and good people and nice people that we know in the world and the stores you shop in and the fashions you buy and the restaurants you eat in and all of these things which are just a part of this life. But I wonder if we're seeing it through God's eyes &gt;&gt; or I wonder if we're seeing it through eyes that have become conditioned by the age &gt;&gt; until it was in the time of Amos when he had to come and blast out the vision of God till he could tell him, "I've set a plum line &gt;&gt; and the word is my plum line &gt;&gt; and I'm going to hold the nation. But I'm going to hold my people accountable to the plum line. And they've gone away. They've disregarded. And the thing that had influenced them was the good life, the generation, because things become acceptable. It's acceptable for women to walk down the street the way they walked down. It's acceptable for men and and women alike to make some uh uh unkind to say or to curse in public. Didn't used to be that way. What's changed? &gt;&gt; Prophet said if a grandmother had dressed the way they dress today, some of the young ladies that walk and serve you in the in the restaurant, it's absolute shameful. &gt;&gt; It's absolute nakedness. But you become accustomed to it. We need a paradigm shift. &gt;&gt; We need a Holy Ghost paradigm shift. &gt;&gt; We need to see things as God sees them. &gt;&gt; And so there are different kinds also of light. And the Bible says of Christ, "Then this this then is the message which we heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all." Now, the reason why that's a different kind of light than just the light we have here today. And the reason why we have light is so that we can perceive, so that we can see, so that we can direct ourselves, so we can make our make an appropriate decision. You had to see to come into the church. We couldn't we'd had a confusion if we had zero light. So we've got electricity. Outside, we have daylight. And we do things in the daytime that we can't really do at night simply because we need the light. You need the light. But I can tell you one thing, friends. If you plan to get to heaven, you're going to need another kind of light. &gt;&gt; In him was light &gt;&gt; and no darkness at all. And we need that light. &gt;&gt; And he he determined he would convey the light outside. He's got a certain scientific way of doing it. Man and his ingenuity has devised a way to bring this light to us. And we don't understand everything. We don't understand all of the all of the cables and all of the substations and all of the generating units and whether they're gas or hydro or coal or what they are. We don't pay any attention to it. We're sitting here directing our affairs because we have light that man has made. But God has got light and he determined he'd convey that light to you by by word &gt;&gt; and that you could only understand his word not by learning but by revelation. You can't even get it by me standing here preaching. You need to be praying today. Oh spirit of God, reveal to me. Author of this book, come to me by your Holy Spirit and reveal to me what I need to know. I desire to make heaven my home. &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of light. In him was life and the life was the light of man. John said again, "And this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and man loved darkness rather than light because his deeds was evil." We're requiring a different kind of of faculty for that light. Brother Brandham says spiritual things are spiritually discerned. There's a sp there's a natural sight and there's a spiritual sight. &gt;&gt; And we need desperately need spiritual sight. &gt;&gt; The fact that we may have it at one time doesn't mean that we have it all the time. We need to keep our vision cleared. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We got these glasses and first thing I do every morning is I clean them because they get dirty and I don't want an impaired vision. &gt;&gt; We need spiritual eyesight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, have you ever prayed that God would give you clearer sight, eyesight, because it doesn't mean, you know, just because we see things and and also uh I want to say to this congregation, you may see things even in one another, &gt;&gt; you may not have a real true vision of it. &gt;&gt; You may not have a real understanding. You may need a paradigm shift by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Sometime we need to walk in the next person's shoes. We need to feel the next person's burden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we need to really learn to direct our own affairs. Direct our own affairs and pray for the affairs of others. Pray for the lives of others. Amen. &gt;&gt; That which was from the beginning, which we've heard, which we have seen with our eyes, and which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. John has said this, listen very closely. that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, speaking of Christ, which we have seen, he saw him with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the for the life was manifested, and we've seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father, and was manifested unto us. He said, we we seen it. We didn't only see it. So did a lot of other people see it. Pilate saw it. Herod saw it. Caiaphas saw it. The Pharisees saw it. Sadducees saw it. Herodians saw it. The whole public saw it. But they didn't see it like John saw it. &gt;&gt; All kinds of people have saw the prophet of this day. All kinds of people were healed in the ministry. Millions heard the word, but there's a few people that heard it different &gt;&gt; and they saw it different. They had a different view. They had a different understanding of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we talk about a message or a message book or a message tape or whatever more. Let me say to you, that's God's eyes &gt;&gt; on this generation. &gt;&gt; That's what God thinks about this generation. If you want to look for God through God's eyes, next time you pick up a book, next time you read a message, &gt;&gt; don't forget that's not outside of this book. &gt;&gt; What it is, it is the focusing, &gt;&gt; fine-tuning, &gt;&gt; focusing in on this age &gt;&gt; of what God said in here about this age. This book covers the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; But the message is that segment for our day. &gt;&gt; If you want to say it, your glasses will be shined up when you read a message. &gt;&gt; That's God's idea. &gt;&gt; That's God's plum line. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So there's two main ways of seeing things. What sayest thou? Two main ways. And the one way is to see things as God sees them. To see things as Jesus saw them. The Bible says, "But when he saw the multitude, when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they were scattered as sheep without a shepherd." Hey, the disciples didn't see that. &gt;&gt; They were believers. They didn't see that. All kinds of people were around there. They didn't see that. &gt;&gt; And what he saw moved him. &gt;&gt; He saw the people saw that they were fainting. Maybe they didn't even feel they were fainting, but he saw the true picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw them fainting. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If he looks today, you were fine. You're all look fine. You've washed yourselves up and had your morning abolution uh you know washings and so on and dressed and came to church. But there's one here &gt;&gt; that sees right down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sees the burden of your heart. &gt;&gt; Sees what you've carried. Sees what you can't even express to somebody else. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's somebody here. I want to introduce you to him. If you haven't said hello recently, &gt;&gt; Rod sang our wonderful Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is wonderful. &gt;&gt; He is lovely. &gt;&gt; I'd like to bring you back in tune with his loveliness. &gt;&gt; One that sees exactly what you're going through. Sees exactly what beats in your heart. and he's the only one. &gt;&gt; And he sees it the way it really is. &gt;&gt; He doesn't see it all entangled in all of the politics. &gt;&gt; He doesn't see it all messed up in family affairs and what someone else thinks. He sees it the way it really is. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad for that, friends. &gt;&gt; I intend to preach this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have one here, &gt;&gt; who sees it really the way it is. &gt;&gt; Sees people when they're faint. Sees people when their heart's broken. Sees them when they're weighted down. Sees them when sees you when you think there's no answer or what is the solution or nobody knows me. I think about our young people here. Do you know that up in the up in northern Canada and uh you know that there's crisis in some of our villages and cities and there's crisis amongst the teenagers. Do you know that the country has a dilemma with 15 year olds and 16 year olds committing suicide? &gt;&gt; Because they've come to a place they haven't even they haven't even had an opportunity to really break out into life and already they see such a there's it's hopeless &gt;&gt; to them and it's more desirable to end life than to go on. Isn't that tragic? Do you think that God doesn't see that? God sees that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I'll say like brother Benny Perry, are you listening? &gt;&gt; No one else saw that. Jesus saw that. &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this because I believe this congregation needs a paradigm shift. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe we need the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to wash our minds and wash our thoughts and to give us a give us the very mind of Christ, the very the very plum line of God. &gt;&gt; And this isn't something that happens in an individual service. This is something that a whole person's life is set in another direction. And I can preach that because I'm experiencing it &gt;&gt; and I'm happy &gt;&gt; to be able to think that God has mercy enough &gt;&gt; to give us a paradigm shift &gt;&gt; so we see things we can see things as God sees them. The Bible says of the woman, one more example, when Jesus was speaking to the woman at the well in John's gospel, the fourth chapter, the one scripture that the prophet mentions probably hundreds of times. And Jesus said unto her, I'm just giving these words. And Jesus said unto her, now it's just Jesus and this woman speaking. She said, 'I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all things. And Jesus said to her, I that speak unto thee am he. Now, she had a major m paradigm shift. &gt;&gt; She had a major shift. I want this congregation's full attention. I want you to look beyond the physical well, the physical woman and the physical man, Jesus Christ. I want you to look now into the realm of the eternities where beyond beyond and before the foundation of the world, it was determined that this woman would be born. &gt;&gt; It was known by God that she would live a life unclean. And then she would come to the well alone because she doesn't want to be identified or seen by the other women. &gt;&gt; That's the reality. &gt;&gt; And before the foundation of the world, a lamb was slain for her. &gt;&gt; And now here was Christ himself, &gt;&gt; God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Coming to that well. Just think, he could have been in palaces. He could have been in big congregations. He could have been speaking to multitudes. He could have been with his disciples. But he decided and he went there and he needed to be at that well speaking to that one woman. &gt;&gt; He could have been persuading thousands or multitudes into the kingdom of God, but he determined to be there for one woman. &gt;&gt; That's the way he saw it. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way God saw it. &gt;&gt; Oh, this congregation, if we could just shake ourselves away from our human reasoning and our human thoughts, this is the way God saw it. &gt;&gt; She said, "I that speak to thee." She said, "I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all things. I that speak to thee am he." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And at that moment, the prophet said, "The light struck the seedl." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in another realm &gt;&gt; beyond beyond electric light beyond the outside light in another realm. &gt;&gt; The light &gt;&gt; from eternity struck the seed. &gt;&gt; And she was birthed into the kingdom of God. She passed from darkness to light. &gt;&gt; She passed from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom. She passed from harlotry to innocency. [Music] Hallelujah. Say amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; What a moment. &gt;&gt; And at that moment, the mighty apostles came. The believers, &gt;&gt; the believers of the message arrived. &gt;&gt; They saw the same woman. &gt;&gt; Saw the same man. their Lord. Are you believers? Yes. Who's your Lord? This is our Lord. Who are you following? We follow him. &gt;&gt; We believe him. He's God's the God prophet. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; What sayest thou? &gt;&gt; Well, quite frankly, the Bible says it. They marveled &gt;&gt; that he was talking with the woman. Here comes the mighty apostles and they're marveling. &gt;&gt; Yes, we're believers. We will go to Cleverdale Bible way. We've been here for years. I had a mighty experience. We've had this. We've had that. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; And I'm not belittling that at all. But you need to be at the current moment. What is it that you see? &gt;&gt; I see God doing things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have a vision &gt;&gt; for what God wants to do. I believe we're in the winding up time. And if you believe it, I tell you what, my brothers, my sister, we're ready to give up. &gt;&gt; And we have a complete different thought in our minds. &gt;&gt; And we truly believe we're heading right into that rapture age. We're not going to go along just sitting on our laurels. We're not going to go on without a burden in our heart. We're not going to go long without a vision. It will be burning hotter than it ever has in our lives. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach a sermon. I'm here to tell you exactly what's in my heart. &gt;&gt; What sayest thou? &gt;&gt; What sayest thou, bride of Jesus Christ? What sayest thou? How do you say it? The apostles come and so affected me. A woman a woman had just passed from darkness to light. &gt;&gt; Just passed from her harlotry to the perfection of innocency. &gt;&gt; And the believers are wondering what's going on here? Why is he talking? So human, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So connected. &gt;&gt; So connected. &gt;&gt; They were so connected to just what their eyes were telling them that they were missing what God was doing. &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation, don't miss what God's doing. &gt;&gt; If you ever prayed for anything, pray that you'll have eyesight that peers into the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Perry was preaching what he was preaching because I already been studying this for some days and I told you here I want to preach on what seeest thou and furthermore I was ready to preach Wednesday and I was at my computer and I was just making my notes and getting ready and I just felt exhausted. I mean beyond exhausted. I thought, well, this will pass in a few minutes. I'll just lay down. And I start feel a little upset to my stomach. I thought, I'll just wait a couple of hours. I'll be okay. Didn't happen. So, I called brother John. I said, "Play the tape, wave a true prophet, and tell the people that I believe that this is what needs to be heard." And as I laid there in bed, the Holy Spirit spoke to me. said, "I've set you aside. I want the people to hear this." &gt;&gt; I said, "Thy will be done. I'll just lay here." And hey, you heard it pure. &gt;&gt; What seeest thou, Amos? I see a plum line. What seeest thou bride? I say to the young people, what do you see? You really see a plum line. You see a plum line for your life, a plum line for your time, a plum line for everything that God has for you, a plum line in this generation, a plum line for your dress. &gt;&gt; A plum line for your conversation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A plum line for your business friends, &gt;&gt; a plum line for your job. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell you what, there's nothing in this world that's worthy of being set on the same scale with this word. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world that's is worthy of being set on the same scale. &gt;&gt; I've talked to people and I've said on this side, on this side of the balances, you have, you know, you have eternal life and you have the fellowship. You have the blood of Christ. You've got the blessings of God. You got a voice of a sentent to you. You've got a prophet's message over here on this side. On this side, what are you going to what are you going to offset by it? What are you going to trade for it? &gt;&gt; In a message he cares to you, he said. He says, "But look at that little immoral woman. When the light struck her, there was something laying there to take care of her condition. And this is what Jesus saw. &gt;&gt; That's what he saw. Disciples didn't see it. No one else saw it. And I I say, God, give this congregation insight. When we look at people, when we look at a someone else, when we look at some effort that somebody's making, let's be able to look beyond the human, the natural, the material. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some may come in and say, "Oh, they got a new speaker." or oh, they got a new this or they got that's not the point. &gt;&gt; It's what is the purpose? What's the objective? &gt;&gt; Just trying to have things pretty. Not at all. &gt;&gt; Just trying to have things better. No, that's not the point. The point is God help us somehow to reach further. &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of uh uh nasty things said because we've put them brother's messages on the hub. I tell you, I I can't even I can't even comprehend what kind of spirit it is that wants to prevent somebody from having the message in their language. &gt;&gt; I can't even I can't even bring it into my mind. It doesn't even come within the scope of my reasoning. &gt;&gt; I would think that everybody would say, "Go for it. Go for it. Do it. Do it. Can we help? Can we do something? [Music] You don't know what we go through. I've been accused in the last few weeks of stealing translated messages. I have I don't even got anything to do with it. Never laid hands on them. Don't even know. Don't even know the people. Never met the people who gave them. Never met the translator. Nobody here in the church even had a physical hand in in putting them on the hub. &gt;&gt; But I guess they have to have somebody. Does it hurt? Yeah, it hurts. Good people. So you remember me. You preached in our church. You did this. You did this. What would ever possess you to steal the messages? I'm not a duck that has water just run off his back. &gt;&gt; And I think, why wouldn't somebody be able to see beyond that? &gt;&gt; Say, I'm rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Go for it. Go for it. Let somebody hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let it go. Let Let it go. Let it be released. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And he set his face toward Jerusalem and Calvary." The Bible says, "And it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem." What was he saying? &gt;&gt; What was he looking at? And the Bible tells us in Hebrews of prophet uh Paul speaking now. He says, "Looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God, he who for the joy that was set before him." What was the joy that was set before him? &gt;&gt; Who was the joy? &gt;&gt; He went there for you. &gt;&gt; He saw you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not just a story. He saw you, young people. He saw you. &gt;&gt; He actually looked and saw you. &gt;&gt; He saw this host of people. &gt;&gt; He saw his bride. &gt;&gt; And it was the joy that was set before him. And the joy was so great. He knew he knew that the that the lashes were going to come. He knew the mockery was going to come. He knew the beating. He knew the cross. And he despised it. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; Oh, what he was seeing. &gt;&gt; Oh, I could say, "What seeest thou, Jesus?" &gt;&gt; I see the redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What seeest thou, Jesus? I see the redeemed. I see the millennium. I see my wife. I see my bride. I see the saints. &gt;&gt; What seeest thou, Jesus? I see the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I see them coming. What sayest thou Jesus? I see death defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What seeest thou Jesus? &gt;&gt; I see my joy &gt;&gt; that's set before me. &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm speaking for to you for uh speaking this to you. There were so many others. All the disciples were there. But say thou, Peter, I say Malcus, I say these high priest servants, and I'm not going to let them take him. &gt;&gt; I got my sword on my side, and I'm ready to protect him. I'll he these guys to pieces if they come and try to take him. What sayest thou, John? What sayest thou? &gt;&gt; And they follow him into his judgment and into his crucifixion, bewildered, &gt;&gt; seeing the demise of the kingdom, seeing the power gone. What happened to the message? Message lost its power. No, it's just that they couldn't see what they're supposed to be looking at. He had to remind them the son of man will go to the grave. All kinds of things are happening. &gt;&gt; You know in this land today we get all consumed with different things and the economy and the elections and this president that president this prime minister whatever more it's going to come and it's going to go. &gt;&gt; But we have a we have an eyesight. &gt;&gt; We have a plum line. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Martin Luther had his vision and others have their vision. But we have a vision. &gt;&gt; And it's a vision that's been given to us by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And I say to you that love the message, you that read it, you that hear it, do you have the eyes of the message? &gt;&gt; That's God's eyes &gt;&gt; on this generation. &gt;&gt; God looked through that prophet. God looked through Amos's eyes. And &gt;&gt; so we don't want to have eyes that are conditioned &gt;&gt; to this age. So we see things and I can't hardly speak about them because we see them every day and this just looks normal. This just looks ordinary and there are times that are things that are appropriate. I believe that when we come to the house of God, we should come respectful. We should come clean, not not because that's acceptable of somebody else. It has to do with us individually between you and God. when there's something to do. If we could see the vision and have eyes that looked into eternity, say, "Oh, God, Brother Ed, Brother Tom, Brother Lance, Brother John, Brother Ernie, is there something I can do? Can I help you?" I appreciate there's there's things that's taking place here that you don't even realize. &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, we I was going to have a brother Jake Dick. Brother Jake Jr., where's Brother Jake Jr.? Oh, yeah. Right there. Brother Jake just made a trip here short time ago down into Mexico. I don't want to distract you, but he goes on a trip. This is kind of his vacation. He goes into Mexico where the family once lived and he goes to this group and he goes to some of the old Menanite people and he gives out some message books and he speaks to them and he makes another trip another time and made trips in the previous time and now he takes pictures and he get amongst some believers and and while while the church goes on, you come here, we sit there, we hear the music, hear song, hear brothers sing and so on and so forth. But in another in another realm, there's people that's Why am I saying this? To make you feel bad? No, not at all. You said I want I want to inspire you. &gt;&gt; I want to be a spiritual motivational speaker for a moment. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you you can do it. &gt;&gt; You got a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can also ask someone else. You can talk to them about the word. You can talk about and there's a whole host of witness. I started counting the countries that this church has touched in a direct way. I'm talking about a direct way. Not only with ministry, but with assisting them to get the word and to get the message out to the countries. I started to count the countries and I just give up &gt;&gt; this morning. I just give up. And do you think I regret any one of them? Do you think I regret a single offering? Do you think I regret a single thing? Do you regret it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We don't regret it. &gt;&gt; What do we say? Lord, strengthen us. &gt;&gt; Let us do more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I have a just a little more time, please? The Bible says uh that rather I'm sorry that in the message Christ is a mystery. He said notice the anointed man the Christ himself here through God is made known. He has the preeminences God fully manifested in Jesus Christ. God's great secret of his revelation. This great light of revelation has always blinded the wisdom of the world of this world. Now friends, here's a condition, a spiritual condition that exists at this time right here in our day. God God decided that he would shine a great light in this last last age. &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach now. I want to talk to you. And the reason why he determined to do that and prophesied that he would do that is because this would be the age that would be called to judgment. And I don't know whether you can see it. I'm sure that you can. You realize that the world and the smartest men in the world and the greatest and most influential men in the world do not have any answers for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't have the answer for the politics and peace. They don't have the anti- answer for Iraq or Iran or Afghanistan or Pakistan or India or Israel or the West Bank or Kazakhstan and all the other stands. There's no answer. We're living in a almost an an illusion that somebody's going to come. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think that the enormous popularity of the president that's just been elected in the United States, actually, people say, "Well, the first black president." No, it's not that. It's not that at all. It's that the people are weary &gt;&gt; and the people are looking &gt;&gt; for an answer. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God put it in the proper language. He said, "Everybody's looking for a Messiah. &gt;&gt; Somebody to lead us out &gt;&gt; of this dilemma. &gt;&gt; Somebody to show us the way. of the United Nations. And then you hear the Secretary General of the United Nations making a statement, and I'll quote him, "Israel shall withdraw from Gaza, even if Hamas doesn't stop firing missiles &gt;&gt; into Israel." You heard it. You read it. What kind of intelligence is that? &gt;&gt; It's like saying you shall not protect your home. You shall leave it unlocked even though these people are going to come and steal everything. &gt;&gt; Leave it unlocked. What kind of advice is that? &gt;&gt; I'm not here. We're not here. We're not interested in politics. All I'm saying is that the world will never raise. No man shall ever rise. that shall be a messiah to show the world out of this mess. &gt;&gt; There's one, &gt;&gt; none other than Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he will set up a kingdom of righteousness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He is called the prince of peace &gt;&gt; and he and he alone will bring peace. &gt;&gt; This is who has been revealed to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there wasn't enough amens on that. &gt;&gt; This is who it is who descended in Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; None other than the prince of peace himself. &gt;&gt; And I say to this people, what seeest thou? &gt;&gt; When you read Revelation 10, what seeest thou? &gt;&gt; A scripture that has a lot of debate. It has no debate for me. This is none other than what the prophet has declared. Christ himself descending at this time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's only him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of this turmoil, he brings perfect peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have that yet, I'm here to declare to you in the name of that one Jesus Christ, it is your portion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not to be here to be in a constant upset and a constant turmoil and constant distress and constant anxiety. That's not our portion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's your portion. My peace. &gt;&gt; Give I unto thee. &gt;&gt; Not as the world giveth, &gt;&gt; but I give it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the midst of defeat, in the midst of the sinful age, in the midst of all of the environment we're in, &gt;&gt; my peace. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time staying on this message because another message I have is crowding in on me. &gt;&gt; We can see all kinds of things. Young people, you can see opportunities. &gt;&gt; You really need to see them for what they're worth. measured with eternity's values, &gt;&gt; mental perception, all these things. How do we see? And not only how do we see, but what do we see? I read the scripture this morning concerning Amos's time. And just here, give me a few moments to relate what brother Brandham says about Amos. Said Israel was backsliden, backsliden condition. Her preachers, her priests, and also her government had all left the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know what he said? They didn't believe that. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; They didn't believe that. You couldn't convince them they believed that. And he says now they didn't believe that. He said they believed that they were with the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can imagine the kind of situation, the kind of uh struggle it would be for people to live. It's difficult to live when when when there are those that are completely given over to religion. I am I'm just going to drop something in because it's bothering me so bad. One of the things I just want you to be thinking this is what I'm going to preach about going to preach on this. One of the things that Satan has almost perfected in this generation in this of Satan's Eden. God came to a perfection in his time. But something that Satan has almost perfected is that he has taken the science and the inventions and one of the greatest uh one of the greatest avenues and channels to reach down into the inner part of a human is by sight. And when when the cinema when movies and Hollywood and that is why when the prophet says Hollywood he just brings that all together but when Hollywood came and don't ever think for a moment because I know you'll agree with me. It is like that received some kind of infusion of some supernatural anointing. Not from God, &gt;&gt; but it just exploded. &gt;&gt; And the whole entertainment world and what you see today has such an impact. &gt;&gt; Such an impact. And it shapes people's thinking. &gt;&gt; It changes how they want to look. It comes down and transforms him into another kind of an image because young men, young women, people, mothers, they see that and they see and he's put before them that the women can rise and uh be CEOs and be all of these things. Fine, they can. And as soon as someone says, "Well, no, it's not their place." They say, "You're anti. You're against it. You you want to keep us restricted. You want to keep us tied down to the kitchen." &gt;&gt; Come on. and Satan put before them and tantalized the world. And then that began to permeate every area of life, &gt;&gt; the home, &gt;&gt; the children, &gt;&gt; the education, &gt;&gt; the business place, &gt;&gt; the workplace, all positions. &gt;&gt; We know &gt;&gt; we know it's it's it's counterbalance. &gt;&gt; It's not correct. It isn't what God wanted. It's not building a nation according to the plum line. &gt;&gt; And then as a master stroke, he permeates into the church &gt;&gt; and into religion &gt;&gt; and he brings it because that plays so completely, God help me. I don't want to take the thunder out of the message, but this is really the heart of it. It plays so much onto the emotional realm. so much &gt;&gt; it catches a hold of you and you see some film or some something happening, some tragedy and they can sway the people however they want. They can put whoever they want in a position or they can take a good person and tear them to shreds and make them a a nasty no good person. Amen. &gt;&gt; It has such power. &gt;&gt; And and what it really what it was now, it was a homogenizing. Listen close now. It was a homogenization, a homogenizing of the realm, &gt;&gt; of the spirit &gt;&gt; and the body and the senses. until until people were absolutely absolutely convinced that when they feel something in that emotional realm, it's God. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; and it wasn't God at all. &gt;&gt; It hasn't even reached the soul. &gt;&gt; It's not even near the soul. And so it came permeated and was pregnantated in every part. And people were moved and and Satan knew that the churches wanted numbers and they knew they wanted greatness and they knew they wanted popularity and they knew they wanted numbers and and and and money and power. And so here was the tools. &gt;&gt; And so they begin to use all of that &gt;&gt; as a tool &gt;&gt; to further their ambitions. &gt;&gt; All right. And he knew also that there would be a bride called out. Oh my. &gt;&gt; He knew also there would be a bride called out. And so he tried to make the lines fuzzy. &gt;&gt; That if you feel it, you got it. &gt;&gt; Stay with me. &gt;&gt; If you got moved like you do in the world or like you did before, you got moved. I'm moved. I I I I feel sorry. I'm I'm crying, aren't I? is here to tell you that's not it. &gt;&gt; That can be part of it, but that's not it. &gt;&gt; Until I travel and I'm amongst believers, all kinds of churches. &gt;&gt; And that's not it. &gt;&gt; I cry. I shed tears. And I'm glad that I do. I get happy. I clap my hands but that's not it. &gt;&gt; That is not it. And it became now listen closely. It has become so so homogenized is the best word for me that they can't separate even believers can't separate what is actually word from uh a a a feeling or an emotion or some sense or some something that happens inside. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay on this just a moment. Are you with me? Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a scripture and this is a scripture you that have search programs, you can go and search it in the message. This is one brother Brandham uses all the time. And don't don't don't forget what I'm saying right now. If I passed away this afternoon, this is probably one of the most important things I could say to you. This is something that he has achieved in this generation. And the scripture that brother Brandham uses to counter that. And this scripture will mean more to you than at any any time in life your life. For the word of God is quick and powerful &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword, &gt;&gt; piercing even even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. There is only one thing that you have access to. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That can reach within your being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Reach within your decision making, reach within your life, your daytoday life. There's only one thing that has access to be able to divide between soul and spirit and that is the word of God of the hour, the message of the hour. It isn't only eyesight, but it's the only thing that can actually divide between so that you can look at it and I say, "What seeest thou bride?" And so you're faced with a decision and you just begin to weigh things out and well it will improve this and it'll make that better and I can do this and etc etc. You know what you need to do? You need to take the binoculars of the message &gt;&gt; and look upon your life and upon your decision and upon upon every part of your life. &gt;&gt; I might make some enemies here, but I say to you young men and women or not necessarily so young men and women that are unmarried, I would say to you, don't go hunting on a computer for your mate. I've had people call me and say, "Will you marry us? I found my husband. My relatives go to your church. I found my husband on the on the internet." And I said, "No, I can't because I can't marry you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." What do you know about that man? What do you know about that girl? How well do you know? Have you seen them go through thick or thin? Have you seen a man that has has lived for God and has been an example and has gone through thick and thin, has gone through discouragement, has I've seen him in warfare. I've seen him in battles and I've seen him stand steadfast for the things of God. And that's the kind of person that can be a a priest in our home and can be an example to our children. &gt;&gt; They don't do anything about that. and then come back and say, "We got problems." Of course you have problems. &gt;&gt; Say, "Amen, folks." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who designed the problem? It was designed by Satan himself in the pits of Hollywood. &gt;&gt; Love him. I call them gum wrapper. gum wrapper uh marriages and engagements. &gt;&gt; They say had it just the other day call. I get calls from overseas. I get called from all over the place. Says, "Well, this girl said she'd marry him." I said, "They don't know nothing about marriage. They know nothing about engagement." Well, I said, "No, she's married to him." Brother Brandham says, I said, "You're jumping into the middle of the pond. You're jumping into the middle of the stream. Go back to the beginning." He said that the young lady and the young man, they ought to be uh even the parents should be involved. It was the old eastern custom. I said, "You're not going. You're jumping in the middle of the stream with a western custom. &gt;&gt; Made in Hollywood custom. That's not what he's talking about. Talking about two people. Don't let me get into this. &gt;&gt; This a kind of teaching that the congregation needs. And it it it it's become a whole realm of nothing more than in the spirit &gt;&gt; in the spirit. People feeling things in their in their whole and and I don't want to just call emotion because I believe in emotion. But it's in that realm where I was touched and oh I feel things and oh whether it is this or whether it's that or whether it's my affection or my love or something. I can't serve God because my my I I'm connected to my children. You need the eyesight of the message. If God calls you, there's no reason why a man and a woman don't become separated. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Is this too straight? &gt;&gt; This message and what it speaks is the eyesight of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you men, women, anyone, home, family, feel drawn and pulled and persuaded and there's there's some there's something that's exciting about it. There's something that's enthuses you. There's something be sure and go back to the message and see how God looks on it. &gt;&gt; Where's it going to take you? &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Yet I'm not ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the generation, don't feel me, just an old square. But he says the generation was a glamorous. This is the word he uses. Israel was at its height and it was very glamorous and the women were dressed to the spot and the men and they were pleasure stricken and running races and Olympics and everything going on. I've been on to some of the sites of the young people of this church &gt;&gt; and the internet hears it now and are so excited and all enthused about what the Conucks are doing and I just love the hockey and I just love the NHL or I love the NBA or something else. &gt;&gt; And I I look at it and I say, "Why aren't they saying I just read the scripture and I just I fell in love with the scripture and God just spoke to me." Oh, &gt;&gt; aren't you with me? &gt;&gt; You're not looking through the eyes of God. I say, young people, what seeest thou? &gt;&gt; You just gone through the seals. What seeest thou? &gt;&gt; And then he said, if you ever see him, if you ever see him, You can never be the same. &gt;&gt; That's the vision I wish that you'd have this morning. &gt;&gt; If you ever see him, you'll see him from inside. &gt;&gt; You just won't see a man like others. I could be greatly misunderstood, but I'm going to say it anyway. I've said it before. I think I consider to be highly privileged to have been able to know brother Brandham Fine. I don't try to make that and make that to impress anybody. I feel it's a great weight and responsibility on me that I would convey the right thing to people. But when I sat on that log, yeah, one minute we can just be joking and, you know, laughing and talking about things and then next moment and we're just and I'm I'm so crushed. I'm so burdened because at that time you have to forgive me. But I'm almost today where I was back then. I'd become saddened with the people. I became heavyhearted. You preached and it didn't seem that it really sunk in. Don't get me wrong, the people of the message today are completely different. But yet on the other hand, I could see that there was something lacking, really lacking. And yet I could see the anointing would come on and they could anoint and they were anointed and preached like a house on fire and pray for people and see healings. And yet I saw lives that didn't measure to the word of God. And more than that, they weren't that concerned about it. We're okay. As I looked at brother Brandham's face and it seemed that he wanted to just turn to turn the conversation a little bit spiritual and I was seeking that opportunity. So I said, "How is it, Brother Bradam, that people can get anointed and I know what the anointing is, but they get anointed and yet their lives don't match the word of God." He said, "Well, Brother Eddie, did you ever hear my message on false anointed ones?" For those of you that haven't heard it, that was May, last two weeks of May 1961. He did not preach false anointed ones until 1965. So he's asking me if I heard a tape that he hasn't even preached for over three years into the future because he was already touching something in my heart that is just personal to myself. Have you heard my tape the message on false anointed ones? And I said no. And I hung my head down because I was a little ashamed. I didn't brother Brandon. And then he just went to the scripture and he went to four scriptures. The rain falls on the just. And he said to me, I said, "The unjust." Right. He said, "What's the rain, brother Eddie?" I said, "It's the Holy Spirit." Exactly. The rain, the Holy Spirit falls on the just and the unjust. The tears and the wheat, they grew in the same field. He said, "You tell me what the wheat rejoiced in, and I'll tell you what the tears rejoiced in. You tell me what nourished the wheat and brought it to its fullness and I'll tell you what brought the tears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "Okay, now they're starting." In the last days, Seth God, I'll pour out my spirit upon &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what I said. He stopped upon and I said all he said a ll all flesh but not all flesh is saved. Right. &gt;&gt; And by that time, and he took me to one more scripture, and by that time I could see the whole church world and a thousand of my questions and what was in my heart, it just began to melt. &gt;&gt; And his face is about here. And I look up. He said, "Brother Eddie," he said, "we were I was riding behind Brother Bud Southwick." Brother Buddy just said on a mountain, I believe it's this mountain he pointed to. Said, "I was just riding along behind him and he said the sun was shining down warm." He said he he came to me there. I knew right away because I I'd been on the platform. I'd heard him say, "He's here." And now he just said, "He came to me there." And at that moment with Roger, I just looked right into his face. I looked into his eyes about that far. I saw something entirely different. Don't mistake me. I looked into his eyes and the scripture came to me because as I looked into his eyes, I became naked before God. I became absolutely transparent. There wasn't a thing in my life hidden. And I knew from my earliest memory nothing could be concealed. &gt;&gt; Right? I knew for the first time what the judgment was all about. God's not having to ask for a confession. It will be completely exposed. &gt;&gt; And that's why when you hear a tape and you hear him say, "You couldn't hide anything from me now. You couldn't hide anything in your life from me now." That's exactly where that person is. And now I'm there. And I look in those two eyes and the scripture came to me. the ancient of days that Daniel describes. He's describing Jesus Christ even before Jesus Christ was born. He's describing him and he says his eyes were as candles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And candle I don't mean in terms of dim light. I mean candle that was not shining, glittering, flashing, none of that. just two candles and they just burned two holes down into the very depths of my soul. And I thought, I am naked. I'm naked before God. What seeest thll? I saw Jesus Christ. Not the man, &gt;&gt; not the person, &gt;&gt; not William Brandham. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. That presence. &gt;&gt; Do you understand me? &gt;&gt; I'd be so delighted if someone could go out of this service today and say, "Brother Biscll, I was at church this morning and the presence in the atmosphere overwhelmed me. It absorbed me. It penetrated me until I saw Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This wasn't just a Sunday morning service. And when I looked into his eyes and I knew nothing could be hidden, he said, "How gracious he is, how gracious the Lord Jesus is. I believe you have three questions you want to ask me. And the first one is on the baptism and the second one is on the gohead and the third one is on the serpent's seed. And I said that is true friends that was the beginning. But if you ask me today what what seeest thou? What did you see? Brother Ed Biscll from that day from that day to this day I can say I've seen Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I feel them. I sense him. And you can know I believe in emotions because I'm I have some emotions now. But I can't control these emotions. I say, "Isn't he lovely?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh people, this one you can know this is not church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what God came to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To come and unite with you. &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about. &gt;&gt; If you've never known him, if you've never given your life to him, &gt;&gt; I would do so. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't hesitate recommending him. &gt;&gt; And I don't hesitate for a minute saying sell all. Give yourself unreservedly to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Dear father, your plan of redemption, your plan of salvation is so glorious and so wonderful. &gt;&gt; Yes. and to think that you've sent the kind of word that you've sent &gt;&gt; and how you have made known and brought to life certain scriptures that apply to our time and apply to us personally. I'm praying for these very dear precious friends, brothers and sisters in Christ. Oh God, oh God, take us out of take us out of just this little realm. Don't let us ever slip into just mere religion, oh God. But let us be that fervent. Let be that fervent first love bride of Jesus Christ. Oh God, I pray for everyone. I pray for this congregation and those that are perhaps uh with us in the internet, Lord. Go into the rooms, go into the homes, wherever they might be, into the little churches, wherever they might be. Into the fellowship room, into the fellowship room. Lord, I pray that in the into the nursery, I pray, oh God, that there will be a a a great sacredness it'll come. And may the Holy Spirit just in such a sweet and marvelous and mellow way come, I pray, Lord, and take a hold of the hearts now. Take a hold of the hearts, Lord, and let there be a response. I pray coming out of the very depths of the soul. We want the word, the two-edged sword to come and divide between the soul and the spirit. And bring this message to the soul. Lord, this is my prayer today. Bring this message to the soul. And may there be an immediate response within every heart and say, "Yay, Lord. I I give you all of myself. I give you all. I surrender all that I might be yours, Lord. that I might be not only yours but a surrendered one to you. We love you, Lord Jesus. We love you with all of our heart. I would like to just sing I love him. I love him because he first loved me. I love him. I love you. &gt;&gt; He first. &gt;&gt; You want to express it to him? Lift your hand to him. Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; And just shall be [Music] Just once again, maybe you want to stand while we sing. And don't move. We're not through the service yet. [Music] &gt;&gt; But just let that atmosphere come down now. I love me and my salation. [Music] To start us off, let's have every voice once again. Then we'll ask the musicians just to cease so they can sing it also. I love &gt;&gt; from the depth of your heart. I I love him [Music] because he love me [Music] shall Sal, [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] &gt;&gt; I seek to bring you into the same atmosphere where that was being sung once and God's prophet says, "Do you love him? and then cries out, "You will not commit suicide, soldier boy."

And I will say to you while we are singing in the event that something going on and a struggle is going on, I will say to you, that's the devil talking to you. He's still here. &gt;&gt; Don't let anything prevent you &gt;&gt; from receiving the full benefit of what God has for you. How many here in this congregation believe that God has something for every single person. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil talk to you. Don't let the devil try to hold you.
