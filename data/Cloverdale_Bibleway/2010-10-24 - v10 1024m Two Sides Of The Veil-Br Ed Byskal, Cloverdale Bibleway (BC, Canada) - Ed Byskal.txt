Why don't you have your seats this morning? We're just going to have the choir come and get ready. They're going to sing a special for us this morning as the Sunday school children are coming in and finding their seats. Why doesn't the choir just come on up? And uh we do have a quick announcement from brother Matthew Redell. There's a project taking place in the fellowship room today to organize and count all of the message books that we have in stock. That's going to take place between the uh morning service and the evening service. And then we'll continue after the evening service whatever else has to be done. Please help out. And as the old saying goes, many hands make light work. Amen. Makes the work much lighter, less heavy. Doesn't mean that there's less work. Makes it easier on everybody. Praise the Lord.

The choir's been working on it. Blesses me very much. Amen. Are you ready? All right. [Music] It's hard to take the first step when I don't know the way. Each turn is so uncertain.

You have called me. I will answer. Lead me Lord. I will go. &gt;&gt; Your plans for me are perfect. I never need to fear. For though at times I feel alone, I know that you are near.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's that not only your confession but your attitude &gt;&gt; this morning. Lead me Lord in your word. I promise to follow. We don't just want to be hearers but we also want to be doers of that word this morning. Amen. Are you in anticipation? Heightened expectation on the edge of your seat. &gt;&gt; Pull on the gift this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that the Lord has something great in store for us this morning. Our pastor has made himself available to the Lord to be used as a vessel this morning for our benefit for he's a gift that's given to us &gt;&gt; as a body. Amen. Why don't we just invite brother Biscll this morning to come take his liberty. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Isn't it wonderful to be a believer? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful to be dwelling in the promises. I'll just uh allow you to have your seats for a few moments. I want to bring you greetings from a number of brothers we just been in touch with in the last few days. Brother Ron Spencer spoke to him last night, he wants to be remembered to you. He just uh said once again, he said that the meetings for him this year, it's one thing for us to say, "Well, those the best meetings," but meetings for him, he said they were just the best meetings that he's had. And we're It's wonderful when a preacher can come and get blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's really special. So, we're thankful for our brother, uh, Ron Spencer, and he certainly has a pretty heavy schedule. He just came back from Saskatchewan, and in another week or two, he's going to be in Calgary. So, I told him if he keeps that up, we're going to have to get him dual citizenship. So, he'll be at home in Canada as well as the United States. So, God bless him. And we want to pray for these ministers, you know, that are out and they're going from early morning to late at night a lot of these places. I uh also had a email from brother Dioa and he's some distance right now from Kenshasa having having rest after the convention and the meetings that they've been in. And I can tell you it's uh you know we don't have the same conditions there aren't the same conditions in so many of these places that there are here and people are under uh under extreme you know physical endurance. Uh brother Murphy I can just well imagine I know what it is a wee bit and I'm glad I'm not there because it takes someone his age to be able to get up and go from early morning till late at night day after day after day. That's why when you see these brothers come back, brother, brother brother Timothy Maw, he'll be in the middle of it right now, having left last Monday. And I can assure you that these brothers certainly uh just for them to know there's a congregation of people praying, somebody is speaking their name before the throne of God, it just does something. So will you do that? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have an opportunity to read at least part of the faith challenge report? &gt;&gt; Oh, that's wonderful. Wonderful. Those of you that haven't yet, you want to be sure that you just take it and when you do, read it prayerfully and pray for those that are, you saw quite a number of people there. Those are people who are are burdened for the Lord's work and for God's people. and were burdened for other people just like you. If they were sitting right with you today, you'd feel just you'd feel so happy that you'd have such brothers and sisters. And if you had somebody sitting beside you that walked all day yesterday &gt;&gt; to come to this service and you drove up in your nice warm car, air conditioned and all the rest of it, you'd say, "What a privilege." this sister, this brother, they they spent all day yesterday walking to get here. And uh and God's got those people and we are what we are. We're living where we live, but we want to be dedicated people to the Lord. So, we're thankful for these uh for these different ones. Also, Brother Jacques from Poland and uh we're Lord willing, we're going to join with him. Brother Kim has already been in contact with him and we're going to get him a printer just as quickly as possible. There's a convention taking place in u in either uh Holland or Belgium uh very soon and we want to get a a print station there and then they will send somebody up or have some people coming up and we'll be able to pick it up. So, there just so many different unique and wonderful ways to to be able to make these provisions. Um, Brother Kim had a had a wonderful thing happen this week and just telling us a little bit of the testimony. Brother Kim, you're the only one that can tell that testimony. So, I want you to come up and and just tell the folks what happened. Amen. I know Kim loves being called up, so well, I appreciate all that have been helping at the school next door working. And uh those of you who worked there, it's it's a simple little testimony, but it meant something to me yesterday. Um those of you that were working there knew that about three weeks ago, I had a drill that was taken from the job site. It was quite an expensive tool about $600 or $700 and about three weeks ago went missing on the job site and I was quite disappointed and I talked to brother Randy and he got a quote how much it's going to cost and it's almost $700 and I just couldn't bear to part with $700 to buy a new tool. So I've been doing without. Yesterday, uh, my son and I, Ben, were working just to finish off the plumbing on the on the basement. And each day I've been taking my shoes off and leaving them in the truck, Milco's truck, that that he's left for us to use. I use it like a tool cabinet. And uh, so all day long we're going back and forth for parts. And at the end of the day, Ben left a little earlier than I did. At the end of the day, I go to put my shoes back on. And there's my drill sitting right on top of my shoes. Whoever took it brought it back yesterday. &gt;&gt; So, if you're here, I want to say thank you. And if you're not here, well, we'll pray for you that you will be. Amen. Who says conviction doesn't work? Fact is, Brother Kim, maybe we could just, uh, go to prayer. Whoever prayed, maybe we should go to prayer a second time, have that person come back and work. We could probably use it. Well, uh, praise the Lord. Now, just a couple more items. Next Sunday, Brother Peter Ivanko is going to speak next Sunday evening, and you want to all be here and and just make an effort. All all the folks that sometime don't come on Sunday evening, you just make an effort. I know you can come. Amen. And uh if you're not laying at death's door, be here. And even if you are laying at death's door, come and we'll pray for you. Amen. Uh and and we're really happy. And then because all the saints from Seattle are going to be up for the Sunday morning service and stay through the day and uh so some of you also can be prepared if you want to make some arrangements or put on an extra uh pot of soup or something. I know that it's nice for the people to be able to just go and put their feet up and and be in a home. It's really wonderful. And then as we did make announcement, uh we're making it well ahead of time. Uh brother brother Tim Dodd will be here the 19th, 20th, and the 21st. That's a Friday, uh Saturday, and Sunday. Two services. That'll be four services. And it is a special series. And I heard just a small part of it and the and a few of you were able to hear a part of it and it was really remarkable. It is it's a real indepth study uh along the lines and I would say what what I've been speaking on regarding the soul and the spirit uh he's done an in-depth study and it's really wonderful. It it's beneficial. It's something that I think will benefit absolutely everybody. There will be no Wednesday service that week uh which will be 19th 7 19th 18th 17th uh and then we'll be going four week four services on the weekend. Amen. All right. Uh I I would like to sing that chorus. Brother Ryan, uh he's the only one. No one else. I have no one else will do. Can't you read my mind? Uh there is no one. &gt;&gt; There never is no one like you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Let's just stand as we sing it together. &gt;&gt; Like you Jesus. No, no one else can touch my heart like you. I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. &gt;&gt; Once again, a prayer. Now the prayer. There is none like you. [Music] No one else can touch my heart like you do. I can search for all eternity and find there is [Music] our precious Lord Jesus. as shepherd of the flock, the good shepherd. We want to say collectively today, there is none like you. You have led us into shady green pastures. You've led us by still waters. Our souls have been refreshed, oh quad. You've been so good, wondrous, and wondrous you are, Lord, to us. We just feel our words fail us. Our thoughts even fail us in trying to express to you how wonderful you are. Glory, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Worship and honor. &gt;&gt; We exalt your name &gt;&gt; the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess. And we're here, Lord, willingly confessing. &gt;&gt; And willingly bowing before you. Father, I pray that you will send now forth your Holy Spirit in a special measure upon speaker and hearers alike, upon those on the internet, oh God, wherever the service at this moment is being heard. Bless, I pray, and fill every place, oh God. May there be a special portion as the people surrender and give themselves to you. anoint oh God and may your words be transmitted Lord through yielded and human vessels I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you. If you'd like to turn in your Bible to Hebrews the 10th chapter, we're going to read a number of verses starting with verse five. Hebrews 10 starting with verse 5. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice an offering, thou wst not, but a body hast thou prepared me? In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God, above when he said, sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldst not, neither hast pleasure therein, which are offered by the law. Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. by the which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering off times the same sacrifices which can never take away sin. But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God, and from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified, &gt;&gt; whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us. For after that he had said before, "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord. I will put my laws into their hearts." And the people can say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in their minds &gt;&gt; will I write them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; Uh now where remission of of these is, there is no more offering for sin. Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. So now you're sitting as recipients and we'll sit if you would please just as attentive as you can because sometimes it's hard to convey uh in in continuity what we'd really like to convey. Amen. Amen. I want to speak to you on something that I've been thinking about and this is uh more or less an extension as I spoke a number of weeks ago. I spoke on the book of life and the lamb's book of life and how one folds out to the other. I I want to speak on the two sides of the inner veil. And for those of you that have uh never read the inner veil, I urge you to do it this week. Those of you that have read it and read it many times, I urge you to get it, obtain a copy and read it very very slowly and prayerfully. Uh the two sides of the inner veil. Now we know that in the tabernacle there was an outer court. There was actually two veils, but there was an outer court and then there was a inner court and then there was the holy of holies. And there was a veil between the the inner court and the holy of holies and the outer court. And and actually God was describing when he told Moses to make this, God was actually describing and having Moses make a replica of what God had already made when he made Adam. He made him with a body which was the outer court. He made him with a spirit and that whole emotional realm which was the inner court. And he made him with a soul. And those are the three realms. Now, uh the the outer court and the inner court and the holy of holies. But now there's a veil between the that veiled God. And it veiled the Holy of Holies. And in the holy of holies was the ark of the covenant which had only the word of God in it on two tablets of stone. Later they put the ma a a golden pot of mana in that uh beside the uh word and Aaron's rod that had budded. And of course there's a significant reason for that is because the mana outside now the mana is is essentially the word and the mana outside that fell and they gathered in the morning God also gave commandment don't carry that over don't try to store that up and have some for the next day because it stank and bred worms and so it is it's very evident that this this is the word of God but if you try to live by the law. Uh it won't be a fragrant life &gt;&gt; because you can't live by the law. &gt;&gt; And so it also indicates you see there's just layers of meaning and depth in the word and and so the manner refers to the word but you cannot as as the prophet said Moses couldn't come with Noah's message and Jesus couldn't come with mo Moses message and we can't come with Luther's message. We have a message for this hour. &gt;&gt; And so when when God also told Moses to gather some mana and put it in a golden pot and put it in the ark, then that mana it remained good &gt;&gt; in the presence in the presence of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Nothing nothing deteriorated. It always remained sweet and and and good. and the and the rod of uh Aaron, which was just a stick when they had a when they had an uprising, they took all the chiefs uh and the rods of the princes uh of the leaders of the 12 tribes and said, "Bring those and lay it before the word and the one that has buds and the one that is different than all the others." Uh that's the one I'm speaking with and that was Aaron's rod. But we don't want to get into that. But we want to think uh for a a few moments now of the veils. I gave a list of things that were veiled uh in the message and in the word of God last time, but I just want to focus on on a few. So I will I will uh give it in this order. God was veiled, excuse me, in a pillar of fire. He was veiled in a whirlwind. He was veiled in the veil veil behind the temple in the veil in the temple. The the it speaks of the veil of the shikina glory. Uh brother Brandham said God was veiled in Moses. He was also veiled in all of the prophets &gt;&gt; because they had the word. The word comes to the prophet and the word is Christ &gt;&gt; and the prophet was the veil. And brother Brandham says that very clearly. The prophets's the veil. &gt;&gt; And he said the veil has always been the problem. &gt;&gt; It's not the God behind the veil, but it's the veil. Because if you don't understand the veil, you'll never you'll never you'll never understand God. And so he was veiled in the prophets. He's veiled in human flesh today. &gt;&gt; And that's still the problem &gt;&gt; because we have a hard time recognizing that. So he's veiled in human flesh. He's veiled in the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, God was hid when he was on the mercy seat. He was hid by a veil. He said that there he would meet and speak with the people. In the New Testament, the Bible tells us that the Greeks wanted to see Jesus. And they came to the disciples, I believe, to Philillip and said, "We would see Jesus." And brother Bram speaks on it so many times because it has direct reference to his own life and ministry. &gt;&gt; The Greeks wanted to see God. And brother Brandham said, "And here he was, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't see him because of the veil. Jesus was masked to the Greeks." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "We'd like to see God &gt;&gt; and he was right there, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't recognize him in that form &gt;&gt; because of the veil. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, such utter humility and such utter uh simplicity. &gt;&gt; They just couldn't grasp that God, the creator of heavens and earth, is standing there in a body, &gt;&gt; eating like they eat and prospiring when it gets hot and get tired when he got when he was weak and and and uh so they just couldn't imagine that. &gt;&gt; He says also there stood a man. They came to see God and they seen a man. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see God because God was veiled to them. &gt;&gt; Now keep that on your mind. He said God was veiled in a man. &gt;&gt; And I think we need to keep it in our mind. God. This God that we speak about, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has determined that a part of himself shall be veiled in a people that are called out in this hour. They will be called the bride of Jesus Christ. But God will be in them. &gt;&gt; That's what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's nothing. That's not such a mystery. God wants to do that. That's the purpose of redemption. That's the purpose of of the whole creation. &gt;&gt; And then I'm going to just read, if you want to follow along, you can uh turn into Hebrews the 10th chapter, the next chapter, and also starting at the fifth verse. Now the apostle Paul notice please I'm doing just a little teaching to begin with this the book is to the Hebrews. &gt;&gt; This is not the Romans or the Corinthians or the Ephesians. This is to the Hebrews. &gt;&gt; So Paul goes into details in the Hebrews concerning things that they know and have been taught about since childhood. So he goes in the ninth chapter, he goes in the 10th chapter, and he's referring back and relating back to the tabernacle and to Moses and to the law because they know it well. &gt;&gt; So he's telling them and seeking to advance it and move it forward in their thinking so they can see that Jesus Christ was the fulfillment of so many of these things. So he said, "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice an offering, thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me &gt;&gt; in offerings and sacrifices?" I'm sorry. Uh that is that's the reading we had. I I I want to go back now to the to the ninth chapter. Ninth chapter in the first verse. Then verily the first covenant. Now he's speaking of the tabernacle. The first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary. For there was a tabernacle made, the first wherein was the candlestick. Now he's talking about the outer court and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary. And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holiest of all, which had the golden sensor, and the ark of the covenant overlaid around with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had mana, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant. So that's what was essentially in there, those three items. and over it the cherubams of glory overshadowing the mercy seat of which we cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were thus ordained the priests went the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of God. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; They went into the first tabernacle. That's where the congregation went. The priest went into the first tabernacle uh accomplishing the service of God. But into the second went the high priest alone once every year &gt;&gt; not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people. The Holy Ghost, thus signifying, the Holy Ghost was signifying that the way into the holiest of all, was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing because it was in washings and in sacrifice of animals and blood of animals and so on. So the the holiest of all which was which we will come to now in Paul's writings which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience. So man, if you and I were standing back there in that court in the outer court and the high priest was going into the Holy of Holies, which you were not allowed to look into, it was secret. In other words, it was a mystery. &gt;&gt; And and the high priest would go in and he could only tell them what was going what what was happening in there. But he was going in to get to get make sacrifice for the people that their sins would be covered. not removed but just covered. And and it was a figure for the time then present uh which were verse 9 which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make uh not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and cornal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation. But Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building, neither the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood. He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained, not trying to obtain, he had obtained eternal redemption for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can the people say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; He has re He's obtained eternal redemption for us. &gt;&gt; We have it. &gt;&gt; He obtained it. &gt;&gt; He didn't obtain it and hold it. He obtained it and gave it. &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me hath eternal life, &gt;&gt; having obtained eternal redemption for us. So now I want to take and speak of the two sides of this veil. The veil of the temple. The veil. And while we are speaking of this because there are layers of it. If you catch please these next four items. We speak of the veil of the temple, the veil of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, the inner veil within each one of us that is between the human spirit and the soul. and the veil between the learned word of religion or denomination or traditions and the revealed vindicated word. &gt;&gt; So I want to see if I have time to address those. On the one side, on the one side of the veil, we have the people with their priests, with their ministers, with all of their sins, all of their mistakes, all of their weaknesses, all of their human weaknesses and frailties, &gt;&gt; all of their debates and discussions &gt;&gt; and they were just like us. &gt;&gt; And that's on one side of the veil. &gt;&gt; And I'd like you to notice that everyone that stood there, there was the good and the bad and the indifferent. &gt;&gt; Those really desiring, those were very good people. There were bad people also on that side in the outer court. I'll I'll prove it to you in a few moments. And there were those that were indifferent. You know, they didn't really care. Is it all that important? I don't know what's behind that veil. And is it really important to us? On this side of the veil, on the outer side was Joshua, &gt;&gt; Caleb, &gt;&gt; the Levites, Miriam, Moses sister, Aaron's four sons. They were there dressed in their coats and their special sashes called girdles and and and their bonnets or the special headdress. Very elaborate. &gt;&gt; They were there. They were there right beside Kora &gt;&gt; and Dayathan &gt;&gt; and Aubri. Kora happened to be Moses' cousin, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Dayan and Aubra, they were chiefs of uh of the Reubenites. These were important guys &gt;&gt; and they were all there. &gt;&gt; There was a whole assembly of there. And the scripture tells us, "And of the office of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, pertainth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense." I'm just putting some emphasis. These people weren't just average people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the sweet incense and the daily meat offering and the anointing oil and the oversight of all the tabernacle. That was Eleazar. But he was standing out there also. He's standing there with and all that crown there. &gt;&gt; There's those that are going to die in the wilderness and there's children there are going to go into their inheritance. &gt;&gt; They're all there. &gt;&gt; The sons of Aaron, the priests that blew the trumpets, they were the sons of Aaron. They're there. &gt;&gt; The sons of Aaron sh that offer sacrifices, they're there. And yet all of these stood on the one side of the veil. Brother Brandham said in the Revelation series, that's the flesh, the outer court &gt;&gt; is the flesh. &gt;&gt; He said that's the things that we can't depend on. And we have that because I said I was going to speak on four on that temple back there on the veil of Jesus Christ on the veil of our human flesh between the between the the spirit and the soul. And you have a human spirit &gt;&gt; and it has all the attributes that God speaks of and that the prophet of God actually detailed very very clearly. We have all of that. And if and if you were here and brother Brandham was here and you were before him with some uh in need or something that was the most important thing in your life right at that moment whether it was a loved one that was sick and dying, a wife, a husband or whether you were there with some kind of illness or something that had plagued you for so many years and you were there or you were there in needing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or or you were there because you weren't a a a Christian, you'd be standing there and and and he might speak to you for a few moments until He would say, "I'm trying to contact your spirit." &gt;&gt; And in contacting your spirit, he would do exactly as he did to the woman at the well where she had five husbands and the one that she was with now was not her husband. &gt;&gt; And that was all standing on the on the other side in the outer courts. But and we all have that the things of the flesh. That's the flesh. the outer courts. That's the things you can't depend on because it's flesh &gt;&gt; and the flesh is weak. &gt;&gt; In the inner veil message, brother Brennham, he gives further description. And that's why when you read the innerval message and while you study it, keep it in this context if you would because he keeps detailing those things in modern language in our language today of the things that uh identify the outer court or this side of the veil. And he said uh they're tossed about. This crowd here that's on this side, they're tossed about, they have ups and downs. &gt;&gt; I have to put up both hands. &gt;&gt; I have ups and downs. &gt;&gt; He said they have deep desire. These people have a deep desire. those that are even tossed about. He says, "And they're seeking God, but they never really come to a settlement is his words." Never really come to a settlement. I want to say this congregation and all that are listening on the internet, that is this generation &gt;&gt; and that's why the prophet of God brought this to us. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to stay where we have been, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those of you that may be up in the balcony or in the back or in the in the cry room or in the nursery, uh I'm speaking directly to us all. We want to have a a a a greater and a higher level of commitment &gt;&gt; than we have had in the past. &gt;&gt; We want to move to a different level than we've lived before. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they have a deep desire but they have no they never seem to come to a settlement. There's no anchor he said in Christ. There's in other words they haven't anchored themselves in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said they have a mental conception &gt;&gt; by knowledge of what God is is &gt;&gt; and they're like the priest which I'll describe later on. Brother Brown describes the priest compares her him with the woman at the well. He says uh she come up with a different conclusion than he did because he learned &gt;&gt; that God was God and he learned that this way was right. &gt;&gt; We have learned many people in the message have learned the message is the truth. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take it doesn't take a Philadelphia lawyer to understand that the message is a million miles from everything else out there. That's great. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take any smart person to listen to a tape and have a prophet of God reveal the secret of the heart and say this to this person that to the other person and see see the supernatural take place. It doesn't take a brilliant man or woman to say that's different. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even take a lot of intelligence when you hear the serpent seed explained from Genesis through to Revelation to say that's plain as can be. Do you believe that or do you believe an apple? &gt;&gt; What do you think we are? &gt;&gt; It only makes sense. I had a whole group of university from University of British Columbia in my front room and I went through the serpent seat with him. One one one young man, he's in his 20s. He's so transfixed. He just kept sliding down, sliding down. Pretty soon he slid right off the sofa and was on the floor. He just totally transfixed. We had some young men from a Pentecostal church over in New Westminster. And when we went, two or three of them went through the serpent seed with them because it is so ironclad in the scripture, it's absolutely unmovable. And by the time I was finished and clenched every nail, they said, "Oh, we're going to go to our pastor. He'll see this." I said, "Don't do it. God's dealing with you." &gt;&gt; Oh, they said, "Anybody can see this." They walked out and we never saw them again. &gt;&gt; What was it? There's other, you know, smart intellectuals that take the seed and take it away. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what Jesus said. They'll take the seed and take it away. If God speaks to you, it's for you. &gt;&gt; It's not for the whole family. It may not be for the whole country. May not be for all your friends, but it is for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there is a group of people that God's determined not to leave in the outer court. &gt;&gt; You may feel the effects of the outer court, but God's not going to leave his children in the outer court. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He paid the price. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To tear that veil in two &gt;&gt; and take us into the holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Said they have a mental conception. He said even those that are in the outer court, he said they're feasting on the mana. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't hold out. &gt;&gt; He even likened it to maybe, you know, they come to a revival meeting and oh, they're just, you know, dancing in the spirit and shouting, have all kinds of uh things happening, but then the next day, even the next week, it's all gone. &gt;&gt; The mana, the mana that they eat, it it just it vanishes. And that's what the mana was like almost like a horrost. They picked it up and it would only last while they were picking it up and and in a in an hour or two it was gone. &gt;&gt; And so the feasting they feast and they they want to feast on the word but the feast brother Brandham uses the terminology it doesn't hold out. I want to I want to bring something to your attention here which has bothered me for a lot of years and I'm just dropping these things and I hope that you will put that in your script bag and remember it. There are preachers there are preachers or uh people who have specialty doctrines, special revelations and they're also in the outer court because the whole congregation's there. Everybody's there. Like I said, the good, bad, the indifferent, and the opportunists are there, &gt;&gt; and you'll run into somebody, all of you will along the way. And and and they'll sense that you are one of those that's maybe just a little a little sense of insecurity. Well, you know, I really don't know where I stand. It's ah, &gt;&gt; have I got a message for you? &gt;&gt; You need this specialty doctor. Right. &gt;&gt; And we've had them even in the message and they come amongst a congregation and they start and and because they have a certain human uh ability, they're they're they're strong personalities and they come up and say, "Do you have the Holy Ghost?" And if you even hesitate to say, "Ah, see, you're not sure." And the prophet said this and the prophet said that. If you have it, you know that you have it and you haven't got it. You need this. and they're ready to slide in their doctrine. &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of doctrines that have been resident within the message. And don't think that I'm out of place by even mentioning them. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Some say, "Oh, well, you have to believe that brother Brandham's going to return and that he's going to do all of these things." And if you don't believe that exactly the way we believe it or the way I believe it, you're not in. But if you really want to get in, you want to believe this the way I believe it. Well, I want to believe it the way Brother Brandham said it. &gt;&gt; And others say, "Well, and we I even had it. We had it right here in the church." And and and some would come in traveling in and they'd say, you know, they always start out with that. Do you have the Holy Ghost? And if you hesitate, they say, "What you need is a revelation of the seven thunders." Right? &gt;&gt; Like that was the answer. You see, all we did was move up from a little bit ago because and brother Brandon deals with that when you read, please read in the in the inner veil. He'll say there's group of people and he says, "Oh, what you need you need to you need to speak in tongues." &gt;&gt; That's still around. &gt;&gt; Or others, they were so quiet. You need to shout. You need to get liberated. You need to You need to have the spirit of praise on you and that'll solve everything. But Brother Bram said, "I heard them shout &gt;&gt; and they didn't have it. &gt;&gt; I heard them speak in tongues and they didn't have it." &gt;&gt; In other words, I heard them speak in tongues. I heard them shout, but they weren't on the other side of the veil. They were still on this side. &gt;&gt; I heard them do all these things where they promised and said, "Ah, this is it. If you do this, Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I've been there and they've tooken them and shake them and and someone say, "Say this, say this, say this." Trying to get you. And if you just said a word or two, oh, they were just so thrilled. You have it. &gt;&gt; But you walked out and you know you didn't have it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And if somebody could just prove that you had two souls, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I say that's still on the other side of the veil. All those special doctrines are still on other side of the veil. &gt;&gt; But once you once you pierce through [Music] &gt;&gt; and get on the other side of the veil, &gt;&gt; and I'll tell you friends, there's no excuse for us not to have the benefits of the inner veil. There's no excuse for us not to have the full benefits &gt;&gt; of the Holy of Holies &gt;&gt; because that has been purchased for us. &gt;&gt; So preachers have taken advantage perhaps of the of the insecurity that of some that some may feel that they have. Listen, it's it's not a it's not a sin or a crime to feel that we, you know, I don't really know or uh we we get to a place where things we're going through a difficult time and we don't really know where we stand, but hold steady. &gt;&gt; Just hold steady. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go out and and approve anything. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to approve. Just hold steady. Even if you just get to a place where say all I know &gt;&gt; is I love this word. &gt;&gt; That's all I know. I do know I love this word. &gt;&gt; I've gotten to the place at times in my life where I've said I know one thing. This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm not comfortable with this world. &gt;&gt; I have no desire for the way that they go. I have no desire for their entertainment. have no desire for the things that occupy them. &gt;&gt; I have no desire for their religion, &gt;&gt; but I do know there is a presence. &gt;&gt; I know there's a real person &gt;&gt; called Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I've tasted of the good word of God. &gt;&gt; And you hold steadfast on that, I tell you, he'll come through. This is a different message but like to think this whole crowd that I described. I put us all there and I thought so close &gt;&gt; and yet so far. There they are with all of this whole shamzle and mixture of everything and the curtains right here. Or maybe we're just looking at it just up there. So close. And the high priest, he's just the other side. And I can imagine he's got the basin because I saw him go in with the basin. He's got blood. And I can hear the bells because around his garment was pomegranates and a bell. Pomegranate and a bell. They could hear the bell. He was walking because if he was accepted, we were accepted. &gt;&gt; And if he was rejected, he was slain. And they had a rope tied to him and they drag him up because no one else could go there. &gt;&gt; So they'd listen. Yeah. The bells are still tinkling. Yeah. Yeah. And he's making his way out. &gt;&gt; Oh, he came out and we're accepted. &gt;&gt; Oh. &gt;&gt; So somehow God has acknowledged us and we're accepted. But into the second went the high priest alone, alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, cuz he also was like those on the outside &gt;&gt; and for the errors of the people. &gt;&gt; So when that high priest died, there had to be another one raised up &gt;&gt; because he had to keep going in. It had to happen every year &gt;&gt; and one would die and it was there there was another priest that would enter. &gt;&gt; But then one came along. &gt;&gt; It was that Melzdc that met Abraham. &gt;&gt; And we heard of him in the Old Testament. But then that Melzdc the prophet said became Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So on the other side, we're talking now about the inside. Can I describe it for you for a few minutes? &gt;&gt; On the other side, it was so close and yet so far. &gt;&gt; But just on the other side was the total answer. For all the problems that existed out here, the answer was just the other side of the curtain. &gt;&gt; Your problem, my problem, her problem, your problem, their problem, this family's problem, all the answers &gt;&gt; that you might even have today. All the answer laid just the other side. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. Either this thing is true or it's not true. The answer for every person, for every family, for every home, &gt;&gt; for every nation. The answer laid just the other side of the curtain. &gt;&gt; The complete answer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A holy God. &gt;&gt; All the holiness of God, the pillar of fire over the tabernacle, the mercy seat. Who doesn't need the mercy seat? It was just the other side. So close, but it was there. &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandon said is on the other side. Over here are aliens, foreigners, and strangers to the kingdom of God. But just the other side of the curtain is sons and daughters and the aliens no more. When once you become a son and daughter of God, you'll never be an alien again. [Music] &gt;&gt; Whoso eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will raise him up at the last day. &gt;&gt; I was I smiled and yet it was it was kind of strange. Uh, brother John and sister Leah's young one Isabelle, she was praying and uh I don't know where she is just now, but she's different and I see the little smile on some of your faces. You you've run into her and she's in she she's getting into serious things in her prayers. And she's praying, Jesus, how how do how, you know, I want to drink your blood. How do I drink your blood? And show me how to drink your blood. I don't know how to drink your blood. I thought, what simplicity? &gt;&gt; And you think a little one like that never hear such a thing. &gt;&gt; That that never entered their mind. But it is incredible. &gt;&gt; There are things that we don't know what to do or how to do. We read it, but we don't know exactly how to do it. &gt;&gt; That's what we need. We need that kind of simplicity. I don't know exactly how. And there's people who are adult that don't know how to drink his blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Very true. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; I was thinking today about the about the humility and about the spirit of reconciliation and about the things of that are so clear in the scripture and so clear in the message. I think I read it uh not able to really obtain it. But show me how. &gt;&gt; How do we do it? Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever had an upset in your home and you need to say, "Forgive me," &gt;&gt; but you really didn't know just exactly how to say it. &gt;&gt; Now you're also nice and quiet. I know you've never been there. &gt;&gt; Well, that's fine. I know you've been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said something. Now, how do I retract it? It's almost impossible. It's already gone out. How do I change it? How do I rectify this? &gt;&gt; We know what we should do, but we don't know how exactly to do it. &gt;&gt; So now he says, having therefore, brethren, boldness, and that happens to be the text to the message, uh, intervail. Having therefore boldness, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ. All right, there it is. How do we affect that? How do we do that? &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it's written right there. And if it's written right here, it must be for the people of God. &gt;&gt; And you might say, I'm not an alien. I am I am uh uh but but yet I have so many of these other things of these confusions and these the different things that happened there. How do I enter into that place? And then when brother Brandham when you get into the inner veil, he says talking about the other side, did you ever meet a person that's been in there and has tasted and is living on this mana. That's the mana that's on the inside. Not the mana outside, the mana that's on the inside. &gt;&gt; You can meet him on Monday, Tuesday, &gt;&gt; Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Cloudy, cloudy day, bright day, gloomy day, things going right or things going wrong. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Do you have things going wrong? But if you meet a person that's been in there, &gt;&gt; somehow &gt;&gt; the atmosphere &gt;&gt; from in there &gt;&gt; invalidates the atmosphere outside of there. &gt;&gt; And we can say, well, it's a nice sermon, but I'm saying this is a reality. &gt;&gt; Either this belongs to us or don't belong to us. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't belong to us, we should shut the doors and go home. It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; And the devil would like to get us to believe, well, that's just, you know, an intermediate feeling because he's an expert outside, &gt;&gt; but I can tell you he's never been inside there. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery to him. &gt;&gt; He hasn't been in the holiest of holies, &gt;&gt; but you are invited into it. &gt;&gt; You have been in there. You've tasted of it. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think that we've been at the curtain and we bit in and we tasted of it and we got the atmosphere of it and we thought, "Oh, this will last forever." And then something happens say, "Oh, I think I heard something out here and get out here and hear a little bit of gossip." &gt;&gt; Or we get feeling some kind of stirred up within ourselves. friends, what we're doing, we're peeking on the other side. &gt;&gt; Things are going right or wrong, he's always sweet. When I read that, I have plenty of trouble because just all too often I'm not always sweet. And yet I read that and this is absolute truth &gt;&gt; and that is my confession &gt;&gt; that is not there like it's some pie in the sky available to me. It's right here. &gt;&gt; Always full of love. &gt;&gt; Never to talk or do anything wrong. He's living under the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Listen folks, I'm not preaching to you. I'm preaching for us. &gt;&gt; I'm part of this. &gt;&gt; He never gets hungry. He never has to go to church to get built up. &gt;&gt; He's just always full of God. Hallelujah. Inside there is the two tables of stone with the commandments written which no man could keep the mercy seat a shakina presence of the Almighty. And here's here's here's how brother Vanom describes it inside. You ceased to be an alien. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you are a child. You know, friends, I know that's taken place. I know that we're not aliens and strangers to the kingdom of God. I know that we are children. But then we should we should drive our stakes down. We should make the announcement. We should let the enemy know that we're making a declaration. This is my home, &gt;&gt; not here. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what I will live in. &gt;&gt; And this is what I'll deny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "You're not an alien." Can you say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "I'm not an alien. &gt;&gt; I'm not an alien. &gt;&gt; I'm a child &gt;&gt; of God." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You need to be able to be, you know, bold enough to declare that. And then he goes, and here's where I see the veil. From death to life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; From darkness to day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Roy. &gt;&gt; From mortal to immortality. [Music] &gt;&gt; From corruption to incorruption. &gt;&gt; From weary to joy. &gt;&gt; From death to life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello, folks. &gt;&gt; Which side of the veil? &gt;&gt; This is not just a church service. This isn't a Sunday service. It's for you to make a declaration on which side of this veil you are. &gt;&gt; I am not here in confusion. I am in I'm in I'm in uh absolute peace. &gt;&gt; My peace give I unto you. Not as the world giveth. I give you my peace. &gt;&gt; That's our high priest. He's gone in there. &gt;&gt; Is that your portion? &gt;&gt; You want to say with me? I'm I want to get this right down. I'm not an alien. &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; I'm not living in that weary state. &gt;&gt; I refuse it. &gt;&gt; And even Satan tries to impose it upon you. Why? Because you have you possess you're walking with both sides of the veil. &gt;&gt; You have a flesh as well. But God has ordained that that flesh should veil God. &gt;&gt; Not upon feelings. &gt;&gt; Now he's referring to the other side. Not upon emotions. &gt;&gt; Right. Not upon theory, &gt;&gt; not upon some unknown something that somebody has said to you that has no basis. &gt;&gt; Upon someone say, "Well, you come and join our church and it'll be finished." And upon the word of God, uh, but upon the word of God, the human soul rests solid, God said. And that settles it and makes it real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So geographically it's like saying well if I if I move from this place if I move from this seat to this seat over here it'll be changed. That that's not it. It is something that has happened within. And when it's happened within, you'll have it wherever you are and wherever you go. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, the word of God and access to the word was sealed and shrouded in mystery. I want to follow you. Follow me very very close. Don't be don't presume you know where I'm going. So in the Old Testament in that veil the word of God which was the two tablets which were inside which they couldn't keep to begin with &gt;&gt; even if they saw them and were able to read them. They couldn't keep it. &gt;&gt; In fact is they would only condemn them. &gt;&gt; How would you like to read the Bible every day and just be condemned &gt;&gt; and condemned? They they would read the Old Testament. They were condemned. That's right. &gt;&gt; So the access to the word was sealed and shrouded in mystery. And in the New Testament, the word of God in Christ was so close yet it was sealed in shrouded in mystery. It was so close. The I have I have quite a bit to say, so listen close. Many times we read the Bible, we think, "Oh, if I'd only been back then." No, if you'd been back then, it might have been even harder than it is right now. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I would have just loved him." I doubt it. Unless it be the grace of God upon you &gt;&gt; because you'd be looking if you dare look at the outside now. If you're caught with emotions right now or if you're caught in that other realm the the outer side of the veil you you are on the other side of the veil. &gt;&gt; He was the veil. &gt;&gt; His body was the veil. &gt;&gt; And the people were on the outside &gt;&gt; and I'm going to come quickly because I've got to move along. And so Jesus walked. He he he he he saw people along the way and the and the Greeks said we would see Jesus &gt;&gt; and Jesus said except a corner of wheat fall in the ground it abides alone and so on. So he just added mystery to mystery. &gt;&gt; But then Jesus in his humanity he comes to a well and he's wearied. He's weary. Hello, church members. Cloverdale Bible Way. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't portray to me that you'd have been there and you'd have had something great. You'd have been beyond the disciples and the and the apostles and you'd have figured it all out. No, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't figure this one out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because we spend too much time on the other side of the veil. And so he he he was wearied and he sat down on the well and a woman comes to get water. Now he wasn't just a man, but he was God. &gt;&gt; Woman, give me a drink. He says, "How is it that you being a Samaritan ask of me a drink?" the Jews, they don't have it. We don't have any dealings. We got segregation. He said, "If you knew who it was that was talking to you, you'd ask me for a drink, &gt;&gt; and I'd give you water. You'd neither come here to draw, and you wouldn't be thirsty again." Says, "Are you greater than Jacob who gave us this well, and you have nothing to draw with?" And he and that's when he said if you knew who it was and she said he made her thirsty said give me to drink give me this water and now he reaches to the realm of her emotional realm go and get your husband said I don't have a husband Jesus said you answered the truth You've had five and the one you have now is not your husband. What's he doing? &gt;&gt; He's bringing her closer to the veil. &gt;&gt; He's bringing her closer closer &gt;&gt; because now she sees that there's something beyond what I'm looking at &gt;&gt; that. What is this that knows me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is this that knows me? &gt;&gt; And now her mind isn't on the water. Now she says, uh, the Jews say we should worship in this city of Jerusalem and the Samaritans say we should be on this mountain and she becomes religious. And that's always the case when you're talking to people and they start getting close, they become religious. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said where should we worship and then Jesus is really tester. He says you Samaritans you worship you don't know what salvation's of the Jews. Hello Bible way. In this sad Leodysian age, I would hate to think, but there may have been people here in this audience that may have said, "That's enough for me. I'm out of here." Anybody that's going to run my religion down, run me down as a Samaritan. I was born a Samaritan. How can I help that? &gt;&gt; No. There was no such a reaction from her. right? &gt;&gt; Said you don't even know, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham. Thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet to give us an answer. &gt;&gt; He said she knew one thing. &gt;&gt; Can anybody tell me what it was? She knew one thing. I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things. &gt;&gt; That was the only thing she knew. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "When she said that, &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us all things." And then that opened the door and the Holy Spirit of God ripped that ripped that curtain, that veil from top to bottom. And he said, "I'm heal." [Music] The veil was tore from top to bottom and she looked straight into the holy of holies and saw the Messiah and it changed her entire life. She left her water buck. She left her plan and pro what she was going to do that day and she ran into the city and became an evangelist of a sort said come and see a man that told me all that ever I did. Is not this the Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; She never had another day like that one. [Music] &gt;&gt; Suddenly church meant nothing. Samaritans meant nothing. Jerusalem meant nothing. The mountain meant nothing. Where and how and all all this uh confusion. She left the confusion &gt;&gt; and came into the settlement of mine. &gt;&gt; She left a place that she had no anchor and she became anchored in Christ the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says they uh he said that light struck the seed &gt;&gt; and pierced even her own flesh. [Music] We need it, friends. &gt;&gt; We need it. &gt;&gt; This church needs it. &gt;&gt; Believers everywhere need it. &gt;&gt; And we need people. &gt;&gt; We need people who have pierced through this old carnal flesh. &gt;&gt; And have nothing more to do with just a bunch of emotionalism and and all full of victory one day and down in the dumps the next day. and I'm on fire today and now I'm not tomorrow. Forget that life. &gt;&gt; It's not for us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Once again, she wasn't only close and so far, but she was close and came in. God failed. Brother Brandham says about this woman in the future home. He said this little woman, her first life up here, she was a prostitute. She was all marred up, but way down in here in her &gt;&gt; was just a little bit of understanding. &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah cometh, he said that was there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came and manifested the word, because the word discerned the thoughts that was in her heart. Hebrews 4:12, the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. &gt;&gt; And he came as the son of man, the prophet. What happened? The priest with only intellectual learning said, "It's a devil." &gt;&gt; Because that's what his denomination called it. &gt;&gt; What did he do? What did it do? He had no representation. So it blacked him out. But this little woman, &gt;&gt; had nothing to present. &gt;&gt; She was as filthy and dirty as she could be. But notice way down in her, she's got representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be made flesh. She had representation. She was looking for it. That's why she said, "I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us all things." And when she went into the city, that's exactly what she said. Come see a man that told me all things. &gt;&gt; He only told her, "You're not with your husband." &gt;&gt; And you've had five. That's all he told her. But to her, it unveiled everything. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And when he said that, she said, and she said, "You're not Belub. No, I perceive that you're a prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know. Now we know where the Messiah which is Christ he will come and when he does he will do this &gt;&gt; and he said I'm he. &gt;&gt; No more doubt. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to explain it. &gt;&gt; She saw it. &gt;&gt; We don't need a lot of explanation. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, as simple as I'm preaching this morning, you don't need a bunch of teaching on this. All you need to do is say, "Brother Biscll, that's the truth. &gt;&gt; I believe that." That's right out of the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet of God has said. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's for me. &gt;&gt; You'll find yourself inside. [Applause] &gt;&gt; She believed it &gt;&gt; and away she went. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did it do to her? &gt;&gt; It redeemed her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We must not be those &gt;&gt; that have merely learned the message. Please. Right, &gt;&gt; friends. I want to spend eternity with you. I desire it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I find within the message, there's too many that have just learned it. &gt;&gt; They've learned that the message is true. &gt;&gt; And and he said concerning the priest, he said, "And there was a priest representing the light." We can say we're believers and we represent the message. &gt;&gt; But he learned it from the Bible. He learned that God was God. &gt;&gt; He learned that holiness was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He learned that there was a law of God. &gt;&gt; And he learned it because of intellectual conception. He can understand it. He could grasp it. Don't learn anything from this message this morning. Let the Holy Spirit take the truth some just a phrase or a sentence and drive it down and anchor your soul in it. &gt;&gt; Life will be completely different. &gt;&gt; He said he was born of the right lineage. Some of you young people, you've been born of the right lineage because you were born into a certain family. You find yourself here in the house of God hearing things that multitudes of others in other churches are not hearing. And he was born of the right lineage. He was a Levite. But the only he only knew it intellectual conception. And when the light of the hour, he learned it by what had happened. &gt;&gt; He said he had learned it by what had happened. Not what was happening. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening, his denomination said nothing about it. And that's why he discredited. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says to this woman, I want to move along as quickly as I can. Please help me. &gt;&gt; He said she could teach a lot of people a lot of things. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was preaching in Birmingham, Alabama. He said in Birmingham, Alabama happens to be where uh Professor Harold, David Edwin Harold, that's where he he wrote the book All Things Are Possible. And he's the one who puts Brother Brandham at the front page of his book, the first chapter. He also flew up here. He heard me use his name over the radio many years ago and he was going to San Francisco to speak and he flew up here and we spent a day with him. Brother Lonnie Jenkins was here at the time we spent a day with and he was in Birmingham. I don't know he may well have been there in 1964 when brother Brandham this man is a professor. He's a professor of history, religious history at the University of Birmingham, Alabama. He may have been there when the prophet of God spoke these words and said that this woman at the well could teach Birmingham something. &gt;&gt; She could teach the rest of the world something. &gt;&gt; She could teach those theological seminaries something. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; sir. I perceive that you're a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. He read the thoughts that was in her heart. &gt;&gt; I've heard of it and we're looking for a Messiah &gt;&gt; to come right away. He said, "I'm he that speaks to thee." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And when the Greeks said we would see Jesus, Jesus was there. &gt;&gt; And when the disciples wanted to see God, God was there. &gt;&gt; And even the disciples and the apostles couldn't grasp it. &gt;&gt; They couldn't even grasp that Elijah had already come. And it was that Lord had to work with them and work with them, but he did work with them because they were elect. And he's here with us today working with us because we are the elect of God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say that with no apology. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's children are his elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the str when the light struck the seed, she immediately went &gt;&gt; into action. &gt;&gt; Can I have just another few minutes, please? &gt;&gt; I want so urgently to tell you about the veil between the church ages and the seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I also say without apology, if God had not sent a prophet, &gt;&gt; we'd still be out there in the courts &gt;&gt; and using his words, probing &gt;&gt; and assuming. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know. What does Revelation 12 mean? I'm not too sure. What's Revelation 10 mean? What's the great angel, the mighty angels come? Well, who who knows? uh you know uh Armstrong says this or Shambach says that or or Robert says that and and we we maybe have our heroes that and other people that are outside but we we didn't have anybody in the crowd that could go in &gt;&gt; the one that could go in now Christ had already gone in but now is a vessel here on earth that is to reveal Christ &gt;&gt; and he can't reveal him in the outer court he has to reveal him as a high priest And that's why he preached. Who is this Melzdc? Melazedc wasn't out there. Melzdc's inside. &gt;&gt; Melzdc's a high priest. &gt;&gt; And thus, thus you had to have a vessel who said, now I don't know what he said. Why? It's his voice speaking. The human flesh is speaking. Listen to me close now. The human flesh is speaking, but the one that's motivating them is not from the human the human element. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's the voice from inside the inner court that's speaking to people that are on the outside. [Music] &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet is. Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet didn't have his own thoughts. &gt;&gt; A prophet hasn't got his own thoughts. &gt;&gt; God simply takes hold of him and bypasses the mind and makes his lips and tongue speak. &gt;&gt; Things that come from heaven &gt;&gt; are things that come from the holiest of holies. And so the high priest, &gt;&gt; take your take your &gt;&gt; take your computer and put it in the high priest. She touched the high priest. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? How did he know she touched the high priest? How did he know that a man out there touched the high priest? Because he's the representative of the high priest. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he knew who was touching. He even knew the exact person. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That man, &gt;&gt; that woman, &gt;&gt; this person, &gt;&gt; you have touched the high priest. &gt;&gt; How did he know she he they touch the high priest? Because he was the representative &gt;&gt; on earth. &gt;&gt; And then he would speak not his words, not William Brandham's words, the high priest's words. You're healed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You desire the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Who would know that? The high priest knew that because he's the baptizer. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And what has happened is that the holy flame of almighty God has pierced through the veil of his flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. to penetrate the veil of your flesh &gt;&gt; and invite you into the holiest of holies. [Music] &gt;&gt; And for those who went in, &gt;&gt; it was over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's all over. &gt;&gt; Bad times come. &gt;&gt; Good times come. It's all over. &gt;&gt; It's cloudy. &gt;&gt; It's miserable. It's shiny. It's sunny. It's all over. &gt;&gt; People say this or people say that or your family thinks you went over the end. &gt;&gt; Family thinks you're nuts. &gt;&gt; It's all over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I've tasted it enough of it to tell you it's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can become numb to the world. &gt;&gt; Say they don't accept you or they reject you or this or that or the other thing or they think this about the message. You become numb to it. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. &gt;&gt; And were multitudes. Multitudes. &gt;&gt; Yes. They came by the tens of thousands and by the hundreds of thousands. They were so close. &gt;&gt; They were so close and all he needed to do is recognize what it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just had to recognize. I think of that woman that was her her nephew is down I think in I think he's in brother Jason Jackson's church and brother Jason Jackson a pastor down Arkansas I he streams almost every Sunday. Brother Jason, if I don't have the story exactly right, then you can correct me. I believe the nephew of this woman or and but it was it was uh no, the son I believe of this woman, the son. Anyhow, they were in a car accident and she was paralyzed. She's been paralyzed for some time. She's laying in bed and the father, God bless her husband, God bless him, picked up the phone. He called through to brother Brham's phone number and caught him on the phone. That was a miracle and he told Brother Brham of his wife and she's laying in the bed. She's paralyzed from this accident. And brother Brham said, "Is she there?" said yes. Said let me speak with her. Gave her the phone. Brother Bram said these words as I understand it as accurate as possible. Sister, do you know who's speaking? She said, yes, you are William Brham, God's prophet. And he said, "Do you really believe that?" She said, "I certainly do." And he said, "God will honor that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she was instantly healed. &gt;&gt; She threw the cur the covers back and got up and cooked her husband's supper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She just recognized she was speaking to one directly into the Holy of Holies. &gt;&gt; All things are possible to them that have entered in. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; That is why friends now having having the Holy Spirit kind of deal with me the way that he has with this, I've decided to go through the seals again. &gt;&gt; We're going to read the seals because That's what was sealed and shrouded. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That these were mysteries. &gt;&gt; They were mysteries. But finally, &gt;&gt; we had a vessel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he had to go into a special place. &gt;&gt; He had to he had to have it confirmed to him in a special way. &gt;&gt; Talk about a special way. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How'd you like to have seven angels &gt;&gt; come from the eternities in a split &gt;&gt; to tell you where to go and what to do and to have a message? It wasn't for him, friends. It was for you and me. &gt;&gt; We can't leave that book lay on the shelf. &gt;&gt; We can't lay those things where you say, "Well, I get lost in the things that he talks about, oh, the Roman church and all the history and how it came on down in the great harlot church." You ought to thank God he saved you from that. You've been delivered from that. &gt;&gt; He's exposing your enemy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And there'll be more on that. But now I close with this. Go home if you have time also and take the message. It's volume 91 I believe. The mighty God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends be in a quiet prayerful attitude when you read that. It is so powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He talks about God being veiled and he go, "Oh, he's been veiled all this time." But when he gets to the end, he said, "Now, &gt;&gt; he's veiled in you." &gt;&gt; You are his veil. &gt;&gt; And that's where it really gets sticky. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can say amen all the way. He was veiled in a pillar of fire. Amen. He was veiled in Moses. Amen. He's veiled in the prophets. Amen. He was veiled in Jesus Christ. Amen. He's veiled in the apostles. Amen. But now it comes down. We have a prophet come unlike any that has ever ever lived since our Lord Jesus Christ. And he came here with a message. &gt;&gt; He came with a message and not not only a message but a manifestation showing that how God can function and work through a human vessel. &gt;&gt; And we can we can fully say amen and regard God was veiled in William Brham. But God always raised up prophets to demonstrate what he wanted for the people of that time. &gt;&gt; God is in God is in Christ. &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ was poured into the church. &gt;&gt; The bride of Jesus Christ is God being expressed on the earth at this time. It's the only body that he's got to work in. You're God in the flesh to the people. &gt;&gt; And you're the only God they'll see. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're the only God they'll hear. &gt;&gt; And for some, it'll be so close &gt;&gt; and yet so far. &gt;&gt; But when you realize who's in you, &gt;&gt; you can be like Christ was at the at the well. You can speak to them, &gt;&gt; make them thirsty, &gt;&gt; and somebody will finally come around your way and say, "Give me this water." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Linda, I thought of the songs to your the words of your song and I have a couple here. But here's the words, and they're really marvelous. I don't know exactly when, but I think it's on the last record the girls sang. Let the curtain fall behind me, placing me within the inner veil &gt;&gt; where the Lord is my soul companion. &gt;&gt; In his presence, peace and rest prevail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no need for the voice of another. &gt;&gt; There's no need for a comforting hand. In his strong arms of love, I'm unfolded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hidden from the world and its demands. &gt;&gt; Let the curtain fall behind me. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's brother Brandham's phrase in the inner veil. &gt;&gt; Placing me within the inner veil &gt;&gt; where my soul can receive a refreshing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the world outside has grown pale. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here in silence, &gt;&gt; the bread is broken. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Here in quiet himself, he reveals. &gt;&gt; All alone in the light of his presence. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My life in communion. He seals. &gt;&gt; There's a holy fire that is burning. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a flame that is touching my soul &gt;&gt; face to face with my friend and my savior &gt;&gt; here inside the inner veil. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; I pray I pray that you and I will dwell there." &gt;&gt; Friends, we say this message. Let me close by saying the inner veil has been made available to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We talk about a message that's why it came. Girls, families, boys. You don't want to stay outside. You hear this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and I think this and I think that. You know, when we get all exercised about things, I invite you because I am thoroughly convinced it has been made available to us in this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't have this 100 years ago. &gt;&gt; Didn't have it in previous ages. It's been a ma available to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I invite you to come into the inner veil. &gt;&gt; Just inside the inner veil, there's a chorus we sing. And I wonder if we can sing it together. Just inside the veil. I long to see your face. [Music] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me? [Music] I long to see your grace. Just to see your beauty there. Just beyond the ve just beyond the veil. I long to see your face. Just to see your beauty there just beyond the first place. You're the prince of peace. You're the prince of peace.

How beautiful you are. just beyond the bl [Music] just to see your beauty just beyond the &gt;&gt; I want to say to every man, woman, child. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Within the sound of my voice, what I've spoken today, and I feel that God wants me to tell you, is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; What I've spoken today belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Don't stay out in the cold. Don't stay out because everything happening outside this veil, it's going to continue. &gt;&gt; It'll be that way and worse next year. It'll be that way and worse in the future. Just say what the what the pastor has spoken today is for me. &gt;&gt; What the prophet of God, oh father, what your prophet brought is for us. And I can tell you friends, I wished I had more time, but I can tell you when when the seals were open, he spoke of the holy fire of God coming on the day of when Christ was was uh crucified. And he said, "And the holy fire of God toward that temple veil from top to bottom &gt;&gt; and the mercy seat was brought into plain view." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he says he's done the same today. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? He's done the same. If he's done the same, who did he do it for? &gt;&gt; Me. &gt;&gt; You. &gt;&gt; It's your portion. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan rob you of it. Say, "That's my portion. &gt;&gt; And I shall pursue that &gt;&gt; and make changes." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Make a plan to change &gt;&gt; to obtain it. &gt;&gt; Have time with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it. I I I want to just sing a verse. I think it's the last verse of u I believe the true report. And then I'm going to ask brother Roy Floren if you'll prepare to come up and pray. Last verse. I'm within the holiest pale. I want you to sing it. &gt;&gt; Like you believe it. And if you haven't felt it, I don't care about this flesh. &gt;&gt; I want to know what the soul is saying. &gt;&gt; My soul is saying I'm within. Not I will be I'm within the holiest pale. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; to the lamb. [Music] Hallelujah to the lamb. I have passed. Oh glory to God. Sanctified to God by the power of the blood.
