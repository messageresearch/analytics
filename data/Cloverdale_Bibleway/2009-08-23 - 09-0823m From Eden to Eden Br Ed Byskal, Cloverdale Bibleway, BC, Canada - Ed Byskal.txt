We want to remember her sister Jennifer and her family that God would intervene and make himself known in their personal matter but also for their salvation. So we want to remember Sister Snow's sister Jennifer. Amen. If you have a need on your heart, just raise it as we go to prayer. Brother Tom, [Music] precious Lord, what a wonderful chorus and song we've just sung. I claim the blood, Lord. A blood that can cleanse, a blood that can deliver, a blood that can set free, a blood that can heal, a blood that saves, a blood that washes us. Lord, how thankful we are for the blood of Jesus Christ this morning. That is not something in our imagination, but we can say this morning, I've experienced the blood, Lord. I felt the power of that blood. It has redeemed me. It has changed me. It is molding me. It is shaping me. Oh, the blood shall never lose its power this morning. Lord, as the redeemed stand here washed in the blood of the lamb, surely there could be something within our lips that shouts out and proclaims precious blood. Lord, how thankful we are for the washing of the water, of the bleeding word this morning that has come through a mouth of a prophet, Lord, that is washing a bride, cleansing of people, Lord, doing an eternal work within the hearts and lives of your children. And as brother Jason has read this request, I believe there's many requests that are here this morning on the internet that have joined with us this morning. I have a need this morning. I can say by the assurance of your word, there is wonderful working power in the blood of the lamb. It's still in effect, Lord. And we're looking to you to touch lives this morning as the pastor will come and minister words, not words of man, but words of life. We pray that you'll anoint him mightily, that you'll anoint our ears to hear, eyes to see the glory of your word as it passes by our way. Lord, meet every need in divine presence. And may God, you minister from the to the youngest and to the oldest of us as we lift up our hearts in adoration and praise of the goodness of God. Bless your children now. Breathe upon us. Let the Holy Ghost fall. Let lives be changed, Lord. Let those that are bound be set free by the word of God. Let there be liberty in the camp of God. For where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. And the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing. Bless your children now, Lord. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's &gt;&gt; wonderful to be found in the house of God, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Just a couple of announcements.

Amen. Brother Elvie, Lord willing, will be ministering on Wednesday &gt;&gt; with Brother Murphy. &gt;&gt; I don't know if that came as a surprise or not, Brother Alvie, but we're looking forward to a wonderful time in hearing what God is doing over in China. God bless you. Also, we've invited Brother Caillumi to speak next Sunday. He's out and ministering and um we just trust that uh he makes it back safe and sound.

Oh, &gt;&gt; I tell you what, &gt;&gt; it's just marvelous to think that he could look upon us. Sometimes I and I've said here before, I marvel that he ever found us little specks. Uh what size can we be when even the world itself we sit on that we dwell on is just a a grain of sand or dust in space. And this great God that fills all time and space, as the prophet said, they'd be too mysterious to us. But he came down, made himself known. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord Jesus. Amen. While you're still standing, we're just going to uh I'd like to just mention that we received a letter from brother Louis's father who was here and he said at the the last of his letter, a very lovely letter, let all the brethren of the church uh he wanted me to express his gratitude for their wonderful time that they dedicated to And with all my gratitude, I send them all my affections. I only want to ask, brother Biscll, that you pray for me so I would be able to be a Christian worthy to consider myself a son of God. &gt;&gt; And I thought that was a wonderful last statement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To a letter. May God uh bless our brother and and fulfill that desire, that request. Uh this last week uh I was saddened to hear brother Roger through you that uh John Vertasic who was not a attending here at the church and not a believer uh of the message that we have but he was such a good man and such a uh considerate uh he was one that was calm. He was one that was free with his time and all these baffles that you see here across the building. That was John Vertasic's work and he had a has a website uh and uh he has worked for a lot of very notable people in the music industry and has worked along with our brother Roger Monk for many years. He passed away this uh last week and uh he was just 61 years old. And I just think that it would be uh only correct that we return our thanks to him by praying for his family and praying for you also, Brother Roger. I know you're very very close to uh John and uh we we we knew him for many years and he helped us out many many times. He was a absolute expert, one of the finest in the industry. And so to think that he would take time, he came came here to the church and helped us work through problems and and uh if you enjoy the sound and say, "I really enjoy hearing the service. The sound is excellent." Well, then we have thanks to uh John Bertasic. And so God uh be with his family and I wonder brother Roger if you'd convey that for us. We're going to remember them in prayer in in just a in just a moment as well. So I want to thank each of you for coming for your prayers for those of you that are visiting. God bless you. And uh let us pray that God's will will be done uh in the service this morning. I don't think we've gathered in vain, have we? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; We've gathered with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Have you gathered with an expectation? I have. And I thank all of you and the ministry and and uh we're just in great expectation. Mostly thankful for the presence of the Holy Spirit with us. Amen. Let's just bow once more before we go to the scripture. Father God, our father, we are so grateful today that we can address you, that we can speak to you this way, that we can approach you, and you have given us the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the name that's lifted up above every name, the son of man, the redeemer of the world, the sacrifice of God, God's lamb, our advocate All that we can uh we could express today is just so feeble in trying to speak and trying to verbalize what's in our hearts. But today we give you praise. You are indeed the almighty. You are indeed the redeemer. You have purchased us and we are not our own any longer. We pray, oh God, that you will uh be uh present to not only feed the sheep, but we have needs amongst us. Lord, I know of some myself that are in great need physically. They have not made their requests known, but they've made them known to you, made them known to myself and perhaps some others. I pray that you'll come down, oh God, and that you'll send virtue into their bodies. Send virtue into their souls, Lord, and into their spirits. For you have paid the price. And when you said, "It is finished." That indeed was true. So true. And we accept that. And then as you came and manifested yourself in this generation, Lord, how thankful I am for your prophet's voice and for the true to being true to the message and delivering us a word, oh God. And that word is Christ living in our time. Lord, I pray that you'll minister to each one, those that are streaming in whatever part of the world or this globe that they are in. I pray that you'll reach out into the room. Reach out into the building where they are and minister to them in a very special way. I pray. And now, Father, anoint us with your own spirit. How I think of the words of that inspired song, consecrate me now to thy service now, Lord. Oh, how we wait upon you, Lord. Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer to thy precious side. I want to remember John Vertasic's family today, Lord. And I pray that you will strengthen, oh God, and comfort them. We do not know, but their their soul. We do not know anything of them. We have not met them. But we thank you, Lord Jesus, for the time that John Vertasic spent here and the contribution he made and how willing he was to work and how freely he was able to work for us. I pray that you'll bless his family now. Uh Lord Jesus, I believe that's our responsibility to pray for all men, oh God. Pray that you'll give Brother Roger words of wisdom, Lord, words of comfort. he may convey the feeling that we have for him in Jesus Christ's name. Now I ask that you will take each one and anoint oh God my lips father might speak what you have on your heart to say to your children and all that may be visiting today for we know that there no there are no accidents with you everything is ordained and we believe that with all of our heart in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to take your Bibles, I'll invite you to turn to Genesis the 3 chapter and would appreciate your full and kind attention. We have uh some distance to go, but I I won't delay. I'll try to move as quickly as possible. I would like to have had some uh some slides and PowerPoint for you today, but it just didn't have sufficient time to do it. So, I trust God will give you the uh alert mind to uh follow and retain as we speak. And Genesis 3 uh starting with the first verse down through six. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made. And he said unto the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden." And the woman said unto the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, you shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die." And the serpent said unto the woman, "Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as God's, knowing good and evil." And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired, to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. I would like to have a second reading in Revelation the 12th chapter and we'll just start with verse 7 and read the three verses down through verse 9. So we've read in the first book of the Bible and now we're in the last book of the Bible. the two books that Satan hates the most &gt;&gt; because one tells of all his treachery in the beginning and one tells of his penalty at the end. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be standing on the sidelines shouting glory. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to see him go down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't look like I have too many here that are joining me. Are you all joining me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right. Let let the believer stand on the sidelines and shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. when he goes down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You think that I'll shed a tear when I see cancer go down? &gt;&gt; Not for a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just let this pale horse rider ride on his trip &gt;&gt; right into the flames. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all who love him. &gt;&gt; Might as well declare themselves. &gt;&gt; All right. Sorry for getting started here. And there was war in heaven. Verse seven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not. Neither was her place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out. That old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. Amen. God bless you as you have your saints. Now, if you'll stay focused, please. Whatever Satan introduced in Eden has been personified and magnified in Satan's Eden in this Eden. And so I wish to speak to you on the subject from Eden to Eden. his approach, his tactics, his device, uh his purpose, his method. All that he used in Eden has only been magnified perhaps millions of times. And science has provided him to be able to approach the human humanity with such subtility and such cunning that we could say today outside of the grace of God it be impossible to escape. &gt;&gt; Absolutely impossible to escape. That's right. &gt;&gt; We also have in Genesis God's promise of the ultimate redemption when God spoke to the serpent himself and said that the woman's seed shall bruise the serpent's head. &gt;&gt; Said you'll bruise his heel, but he will bruise your head. Brother Brandham speaks of the book of Revelation and he says this. This is the most official book of any book in the Bible. This is the only book that Christ put his own seal upon. It starts off with a blessing and ends with a curse. Blessed is he that readeth and cursed is he that takes anything out of it. It's the only book that Christ wrote himself of the whole Bible. The Ten Commandments he wrote with his fingers. That's right. The Jews held on to that. And today it's the Revelation. And if Satan hates any book in the Bible, it's the Revelation. There are two he hates of all scripture. He hates all scripture. And it's Genesis tells the beginning and revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last days. He's going to be bound a thousand years. Then him and the false prophet and the beast is going to be thrown alive into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; And he'll attack the book of Genesis upon it being authentic. And he'll say it's not authentic. and he'll stir the minds of people. Watch where the devil lays that book of Genesis or the book of Revelation, the first and the last. The reason of course he already gives it because one is speaking of how he made his approach. Uh, I've said I've said this in just a very very brief sequence and you've heard it perhaps many times, but I'll say it for those that may not and for those that are new and young and haven't heard it before. Satan was cast out into the earth. Why did he go to Eden? Why didn't he go to some other continent or some other place? Why didn't he just remain in the wilderness? Why did he go to Eden? Because he wanted to get to Eve. &gt;&gt; Now, he said in I, it's spoken in Isaiah by the prophet, I will ascend to the throne of God. I will ascend to the mount of the congregation, to the sides of the north. That entire scripture fits the doctrine of the serpent seed precisely because he will ascend. He will ascend to a mount. He will actually ascend to the congregation which refers to an appointed time, an appointed season. You see, uh when God took Eve from Adam, that was the first time that an appointed season came because prior to that, there was no place for Adam's seed. Right? &gt;&gt; That was the first time in all of creation that there was something a there was a a creature, a vessel that was so designed by God himself. And God, a father, God, one who has seed had come to the earth. And that's why there's nothing that man has ever discovered that resembles the earth because the prophet calls it a womb for God's seeds. And then God filled the earth with creation and multitudes of species which are already vanishing off the face of the earth into extinction. But God the creator had created a vast array of life. Let the earth bring forth. Let the waters bring forth. And it all brought forth. It was life. Life. All varieties of life. All colors. All types of all types of creation because God is a creator. And no doubt you have looked at the aquariums or different places and different species of life and looked at and said who who who what kind of mind could create this? &gt;&gt; Only God. &gt;&gt; And he created all of these things because he's a creator. And the prophet has said Satan is not a creator. He can only pervert what God has created. So hold that in your mind. So God has created all this uh in incredible uh species of of creation and Satan he cannot create these things. He can only pervert them. &gt;&gt; And Satan came to that Eden, God's Eden, and there he began to speak. I want you to watch very very closely. In that Eden, Satan through the instrumentality of the serpent began to speak. He began to speak not to Adam but to Eve. Why did he want to come to Eve? Because he wanted to get into humanity. &gt;&gt; Why did he want to get into humanity? Because he wanted to get into Israel. Why did he want to get into Israel? Because he wanted to get into the church. &gt;&gt; Why did he want to get into the church? Because he wanted to get into the bride of Jesus Christ that would be called out from the church. But why would he desire to get into the bride? Because she was destined for the throne. And there he said in through the prophet Isaiah, God speaking and revealing the secret of Satan's heart, Lucifer's heart, I will ascend to the throne of God. &gt;&gt; That's what was in his heart. And iniquity was found in his heart. And he was cast out to the earth. And that's why he that's why he ended up in Eden. And he didn't appear. He didn't appear. And he used the instrumentality of a serpent, not a snake, an upright being who could talk intelligently to God. who could talk to the woman, who could reason, who had all perhaps the closest thing there was to Adam, the missing link, if you would. &gt;&gt; And he's the one. And God spoke more to him than he did to Adam. &gt;&gt; And told him, I'll put enmity between thy seed &gt;&gt; and the seed of the woman. A woman doesn't have seed. The only woman that ever received seed aside from a man was Mary, &gt;&gt; a virgin. And she received seed, the creation, the second creation, the second Adam. And the prophecies that spoke of this one coming, the Messiah. Those prophecies, the prophet said, lodged in the womb of Mary. And that's how Jesus Christ came on the scene. He was the second Adam spoken by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And came into the earth as a kinsman redeemer. And without that, we're all lost. &gt;&gt; You're lost. I'm lost. Without that, the world lies in its darkness and sin and confusion. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said in questions and answers, "Satan was literally cast out of heaven by Michael, the archangel of God, and he was cast to the earth, came to the earth, got into the serpent, deceived Eve, and then has got into men, women, all down through the age on the same thing he started at the beginning a great big kingdom, prettier than the other fellows, uh to be a governor over all to know it all. That is why he he so brazen, so so crass, he would come to Jesus Christ himself and say, "If thou be the son of God, make these stones bread." Jesus answered him with the word. Brother Brandham said, "Of all the marvelous and glorious gifts what Christ was endowed with, he only answered Satan with the word." And because you have access to that word, you have access to the same authority. We don't have power, but you do have the authority. &gt;&gt; You have the same authority that Jesus Christ used. It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; And every time it defeated him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; In the greatest battle ever fought said, "This great battle that was ever fought, the great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels. The first battle was in heaven. So sin did not originate on earth. It originated in heaven. That might jar some minds because sin is not just a whole lot of immoral living. Sin is unbelief. &gt;&gt; And Lucifer committed that sin and that's what brother Brandon refers to. And then it was thrown down from heaven, cast out of heaven to the earth and fell on human beings. You're well familiar with this quote, but listen closely. Then the battle from angels became human battles. It's your battle. &gt;&gt; The battle that angels fought one day is your battle. &gt;&gt; And Satan came to destroy God's creation. What God had created for himself. Satan had come to destroy this. That's what his purpose was was to destroy it. When Satan came and approached Eve, his purpose was to destroy creation. And the destructive thing in our world today all began there. &gt;&gt; Every grave, &gt;&gt; every hospital bed, every prison cell, every insane institution, and every insane person walking on our streets. And there's many. Right. &gt;&gt; There's many. I'm saying &gt;&gt; you see it every day. &gt;&gt; You look at it and you say, "How can that person be in their right mind?" They aren't. &gt;&gt; I'm not judging them. &gt;&gt; They judge themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, friends, don't be people of the 21st century. Be people of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If you be with a modern mind of the 21st century, you're you won't be in the same bracket that I'm speaking to today. &gt;&gt; So then the battle began here on earth and began in us and it's been raging ever since. He said another place I'll probably read it. We're not here in a picnic. He says, "We're not here to eat cookies. &gt;&gt; We're here to fight a warfare &gt;&gt; and we're in the middle of a warfare." And if you find yourself in the middle of a conflict, a battle, and I said it's in your mind, it's that's the first battleground was chosen there. Said the first thing in heaven was a battle and Lucifer was kicked out and came to the earth. Then he polluted Eden. I'm reading some of these. They sound similar but they are there are different wording which I want you to get. He polluted Eden. &gt;&gt; Then he's been polluting ever since. I just thought of how this world today in this generation is fighting pollution. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't build too near that little trickle of water because there might be a salmon someday that wants to I'm not making fun of it. I'm just saying how extreme it's gone. a friend of mine who's actually given an offering to this church. He's never been a member of this church, never come, but a friend of mine who owns a lot of property and he was planting trees and he planted I think like about 50,000 trees on this property and the and the and and the parks department came after him. The fisheries department of fisheries because there's a little stream and said, "You planted these trees too close to the stream. I don't want to even get time." and took him to court and held up a little minnow fish that was dead as evidence. And he said, "I don't know of any fish in there." But he said, "If there is," he says, "you're the one that killed it to bring in here as evidence." And they had to admit that they killed it to bring it in as evidence. the only fish that they found a little minnow. They killed the fish to bring in as evidence that it a man has actually beautified hundreds of acres of land and then they brought them in. Well, you know, I understand that we don't want to pollute the water. I understand. But you can kind of go too far, can't you? &gt;&gt; I understand that we want to recycle everything. &gt;&gt; I guess I'm maybe the only one who recycles here. I don't know. At least I try. Fighting wars, fighting pollution, fighting wars, fighting drugs, fighting depression, fighting inflation, fighting poverty, fighting pollution again, fighting non-believers, fighting technology, fighting for the common good, fighting churches, religion, everybody's fighting at war. You talk about being at war, isn't that right? That's the world we live in. &gt;&gt; We'll never clean it up or we're going to clean it up. We're not going to clean it up. It's going to be a holy fire &gt;&gt; come from God. &gt;&gt; Going to clean the air, the sea, the land, and the whole earth and make it fit for God and his children. &gt;&gt; And by his grace, I I desire and and plan to be there. &gt;&gt; By his grace, you plan to be there. Do you not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "And every from the battle in heaven, it's come to the battle of earth and it's to be finished on earth at the end time in a battle called Armageddon." Started in heaven. Angels was kicked out. He says, "And when they did, they dropped right down to Eden. And here started the battle down on earth. So we read in our first scripture. Soon as I say first world war, you'll think of 1919 or someplace in there. No, I read about the first world war this morning. &gt;&gt; When Satan came to Eve, &gt;&gt; that was the first world war. &gt;&gt; Truly world war. The first war was not fought in Europe. &gt;&gt; The first world war was fought in Eden. &gt;&gt; The first war was fought in heaven. &gt;&gt; But the first world war was fought in Eden. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he didn't prevail in heaven. &gt;&gt; And I will tell you to my dying day, he will not prevail on earth. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's fighting. He's using every device, every possible tactic, every lie, every doubt, every disease, every sickness, every hatred, everything. We don't have time to name it, but I will say in simplicity, he shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; And that ought to make every son and daughter of God stand up and shout, hallelujah. He shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; He shall not prevail. That's right. &gt;&gt; I think it would be good for you to say that. He shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; You've been sick, but he shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We've been tormented and all kinds of things have come your way and financial distresses, but he shall not prevail. &gt;&gt; He cannot use that to defeat you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel like shouting hallelujah &gt;&gt; to our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Someone from the College of the Atlantic, a professor or a educator, notable person. He said, "Since I've started paying attention to environmentalism in the United States, I felt that the movement has been fighting a losing battle. Environmental laws are rolling backwards. Pollution is increasing and the public seems less and less aware. Man is not in his own ability going to conquer. this battle. &gt;&gt; I haven't lived that long, but I lived long enough to tell you people that when I was a young man working, I got paid very little money. But it was good money. The coins were silver. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Pure silver. &gt;&gt; You don't have a silver coin in your pocket. &gt;&gt; That's true. And we paid cash. I didn't have any credit cards. I got a bunch of credit cards now. Got reward cards and more cards and travel cards and air mile cards and all kinds of cards. Do we live better? When I went to the store and bought a strawberry, do you know what? It tasted like a strawberry. not sawdust &gt;&gt; or some tasteless pulp. &gt;&gt; When I had a peach, it wasn't all rotten in the middle. &gt;&gt; I didn't have bananas and oranges that had to be gassed to be ripened. &gt;&gt; They didn't look as nice, but they tasted a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Isn't it strange? all this technology and all this, you know, the civilization that we've cultivated. Isn't it incredible? And we live poor and we eat poor. &gt;&gt; I didn't even dream of going to a hospital and waiting. Never entered my mind that you'd have to wait. Line up. We didn't know anything about lineups. They just walked into the hospital and went to the emergency or went wherever. who we didn't have a Isn't it amazing that we have developed all this society and all this great intelligence and now you wait maybe you'll die before you get in. I have serious doubts about some of our people. Yeah, I only made just a few dollars a day, but my goodness, the economics were great. I paid a dollar a day for my children to be born. No, it wasn't in the dark ages. It actually was in modern times. My kids cost me 15 bucks. Go ahead. It's all right. That's what it cost. So, are we better off? You young people, don't look at me sideways now when you think, "Oh, he's from way back there." I'm from the good old days. &gt;&gt; Emphasis on the good. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Adam and Eve lost their first war. But we didn't lose the war. Adam and Eve lost the first war. Says Satan, he said in conflict between God and Satan. Satan in this time set up uh the same system that he did in the garden of Eden, reasoning against the word of God. And in the breach, he said when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding to God's word, that's what made Adam sin, his wife reasoned with Satan and then produced the product to Adam. And Adam turned loose the word and sold out. And he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life. And this produced Cain and Abel. There were and then and then came after that Seth. But Cain and Abel twins. Now here's something shocking. He said by by physical death in the uniting of of mother Eve and Satan together by disbelieving God's word they united and brought in the product of death. Death is a product of uniting Satan and Eve together. In the day you eat thereof, in the day you partake thereof, in that day you'll die. and the uniting of the two. It wasn't an apple or an apricot or anything else. It was a sexual act. And and and Cain was the product. I even asked Rabbi Richmond. I said I said, "Cain, how can you ever attribute Cain who lied to God, was a liar, lied in the face of God, murdered his brother?" How do you attribute those attributes to having come from Adam who was a son of God? And of course, he was quite in agreement that it couldn't possibly have come from God. It didn't. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says in the New Testament, not as of Cain who was of &gt;&gt; the wicked one. &gt;&gt; Never says that of Abel, but of Cain was of he was a product of. I'm just establishing that it's elementary perhaps to quite a few of you. But then in a in a revelation series once again and and please don't tire of my reading because I have uh considerable but stay with me. Our kinsman is handed a seven seal book of redemption from the original owner. When we lost it in the garden of Eden, we lost the book of redemption through Adam. It went back to the original owner. But there's been a poacher on the land, a squatter. That's Satan. &gt;&gt; He's a squatter. &gt;&gt; He's a poacher. &gt;&gt; He's come over. He's a poacher. The earth doesn't belong to him. It belongs to God. But he's a poacher, a squatter. And it the title deed of our redemption. This seven sealed book. It's it is the title deed. and he breaks the seals and reveals gives us his inheritance to his people. He gives the inheritance that he inherited by becoming the kinsman redeemer. Oh, I just want you to stay with me. So, so very very close. And freely gives it out to us. It all belonged to him. He was the one who redeemed. But instead of keeping it to himself, he gives it back to the people. And that's his love for us. &gt;&gt; So Satan become a squatter. &gt;&gt; He become a poacher. It doesn't belong to him. &gt;&gt; The prophet said many places he possesses it. He's possessing the earth, but he doesn't own the earth. And he makes it very specific. I want you to understand that he possesses it. He's filled the earth, but he does not own the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's people who he has purchased with that virgin blood of Jesus Christ are the rightful owners to the earth and they shall have that earth. &gt;&gt; We will live here. You're going to come back and live here. Even if you die before the time of promise comes, you will come back in the resurrection and you will live here. And your death won't change anything. It only changes like from the interior to the exterior, from the mortal to the immortal. That's all it is. It's like going through the door. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He says, "What did we lose?" Well, it was given to Adam to have eternal life. As long as he ate from the tree, he had eternal life. I want you to watch that very closely. As long as he ate from the tree, he had eternal life. Adam was like an amateur god over the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The earth was his. &gt;&gt; Everything was given into his hand. &gt;&gt; He could do with it whatever he wanted to. He named it and called it and done whatever he wanted to. He was truly the son of God. It was Adam who named the serpent. &gt;&gt; And he named things after their nature. &gt;&gt; He named a lion a lion because of the nature of the lion. And the eagle because of the nature of the eagle. He had such comprehension, such knowledge. He had he was a son of God and he called all the he gave names to everything. God stood by while he Adam named the creatures. &gt;&gt; God created them. His son named them. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; I can just see when the serpent come by, he probably said, "You could be dangerous. I'll call you a serpent &gt;&gt; and whatever that connotation would reflect &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. He said in the fall Adam forfeited the title deed to that he forfeited it to Satan and Satan took the title deed. Adam was very slothful and he did not redeem his right for he could not redeem it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He could not redeem his right. He says, "But Satan, which does not rightfully own it, but he possesses that." He does not own it. &gt;&gt; Remember, when he comes to you, now I want you to be mindful. When he comes to you, he doesn't even own the ground you stand on. &gt;&gt; He does not own it. He possesses it. And he acts in a in a brazen way like saying to Jesus, "See all these kingdoms? I'll give them to you." The kingdoms were his &gt;&gt; to give. But the earth that they stood on was not his. &gt;&gt; And Jesus had the blood in his veins that was going to drop onto that earth and claim the earth because it was his. &gt;&gt; And to redeem is to buy back. &gt;&gt; Sin was everywhere. Sin had polluted the earth. But Jesus Christ was declaring, "I'm going to buy it back." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the worthy one. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He became worthy." Oh, I had had almost a whole service on this. He became worthy by the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; Think of it. He he although he was equal with God, he he found himself in the form of a man and became he became willing to go even to the death the death of the cross. &gt;&gt; But the scripture tells us that he found himself in the form of a servant. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And he gave himself freely as a sacrifice saying to Pilate, "No man takes my life from me. I give it. &gt;&gt; I lay it down." What's the next line? And I will take it up again. &gt;&gt; See, a man can say, "I will lay it down." You can say, "I'll lay my life down." You can say, "I'll go and fight for my country." You can say that. But you cannot say of your own self, "And I will take it up again." But the prophet said, "You can say that &gt;&gt; by the word of God &gt;&gt; because the very the very Christ that you've received, the very eternal life you have received cannot stay in a grave." &gt;&gt; So it's not rightfully his, but he possesses it. He is the God of this earth, the Bible said. So he possesses that not because that he really rightfully gets it, but he possesses it. Satan possesses that. He holds it into his hand. Death is in his hand. The earth is in his hand. The world belongs to him. Every nation belongs to him. He governs and controls the whole world and everything in the world. But he says Satan is a squatter. &gt;&gt; He doesn't legally own this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's had 2,000 years of fuss whether he owns it or somebody else owns it. Right? &gt;&gt; He's had 2,000 years to fuss about it. &gt;&gt; But Christ came &gt;&gt; as the kinsman redeemer &gt;&gt; and he redeemed it back to us. But Satan possesses it. But you know, after a while, this great fight's over and he'll be cast into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; He'll be done away with, and all of them who worship with him, and the heirs of salvation will come with Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God be to show a Abraham what the plan was that was held in his mind. That the unbelief of Satan and the unbelief of Eden would be defeated by the faith of Abraham. &gt;&gt; What was lost is given back. And you, he said, on the other hand, you'll fight for every inch of it. So, we're not here on a on a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; He said, speaking of God now saying, "I swore to Abraham 400 years and something some years uh that I was going to give it to him." And he said, "Now I said, it's yours." He's speaking now of Moses and Joshua. It's yours. I give it to you to this to his seed and said, "I give it to you." He said, 'Now, here's where I want you to see, and I would like to bring this to you. The prophet trying to bring it to the people. He said, 'Isn't it strange? He said, ' It's yours, but it's just full of Hittites &gt;&gt; and Jebusites &gt;&gt; and Canaanites and all kinds of enemies. &gt;&gt; This life that he has promised you is yours, &gt;&gt; but it's filled with every kind of an enemy. &gt;&gt; But yet, that does not change. Even though it's filled with every kind of enemy, doesn't change the word of God. I have given it to you. I gave it to your father Abraham. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And I've given it to you. He says they're all walled up. He said, "It's yours. Go take it. It's yours. I give it to you, but you go get it." &gt;&gt; God just didn't sit up there and take his brush and sweep them all out. He said, 'Now you come on in. Here you are. Sat down. Never did God do that. He's not going to do it even even with regards to anything that we ask for. We may ask for, you know, we may ask for a miracle. We may ask for healing. We may ask for something special from God. But it seems that God for whatever reason seems to delight and sit back to see you exercise your faith &gt;&gt; that you actually believe the promise &gt;&gt; that you believe the word. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground tow the mock with Satan." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, he said, "This is not a picnic. &gt;&gt; This is a battle ground, &gt;&gt; and we never come here to eat cookies." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're in a battle." &gt;&gt; I think the sooner we recognize that, &gt;&gt; the better we'll understand the rest of my message today. We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be a picnic. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be simple. You kids in school, you just resolve right now. It'll be a battle &gt;&gt; to hold your testimony &gt;&gt; and to not succumb to whatever might be said about you or against you, excuse me, &gt;&gt; but we're in a battle now. Now he said before any battle can be put in array they first have to choose a meeting ground &gt;&gt; or a meeting place where the battle is to be fought a selected place. There's a battle front where they meet and test their powers. Now think about this closely where each enemy tests its strength against the other. Now, here comes the serpent into Eden. And they're selecting. He's been cast out of heaven. Lucifer is cast out of heaven. And in God's Eden, in God's Eden, he finds an instrument that he can use. Even when the serpent was created, God had looked on everything and said, "It's very good." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I know that you might be puzzled with some of my statements, but I want you to hang on to them. &gt;&gt; God said it's very good, &gt;&gt; and the sat and the serpent was there and created, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God said it's very good. But Lucifer, Satan, got a hold of that vessel &gt;&gt; in God's Eden &gt;&gt; and began to use him as an instrument to point Eve to the one tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just so you can see where I'm going. In Satan's Eden, in the end time, when the earth was literally polluted &gt;&gt; in every sense of the word, God came down &gt;&gt; in Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; and found a vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was born in sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; And shapen in iniquity &gt;&gt; and come into the world speaking lies as he said that the scriptures. I haven't found that scripture exactly that way. But born in sin and shaping iniquity and came to redemption through the kinsman redeemer. And God takes that vessel &gt;&gt; and begins to speak to a group of people &gt;&gt; telling them about the other tree. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Christ. &gt;&gt; And pointing them away from that tree to this tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And what the serpent said to Eve concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil was false. Thou shalt not surely die. But when this servant came in Satan's Eden and turned our attention to the other tree, that statement became true. Thou shalt not surely die. &gt;&gt; Look. And the serpent was saying to Eve, "Look on this tree." And this servant was saying, "Look on this tree." &gt;&gt; And she looked and desired and died. &gt;&gt; And now this woman, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, the bride of Jesus Christ in the midst of Satan's Eden looks on this tree and lives. looks on this tree and she's a virgin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; This Eve became, this Eve became pregnantated &gt;&gt; with a false seed. &gt;&gt; And this Eve, this bride becomes pregnantated &gt;&gt; with the true seed of God. &gt;&gt; That Eve doubted. This bride believed. Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference was which tree are you actually looking at &gt;&gt; from Eden to Eden. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now you have the substance of the message &gt;&gt; that I want to build around. &gt;&gt; That's why the battle rages today. &gt;&gt; Both trees are here. And we're fast coming to a time, let me announce to this congregation, if this would be my last breath, we are going to a place where the tree of good and knowledge doesn't exist anymore. &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation, you do not find the tree of good and knowledge. You find him in that Eden, but you do not find him in this Eden. You do not find them rather in the restored Eden. There's only the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Only the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of this just so it doesn't sound repetitious, but God spoke about Lucifer in through the prophet Ezekiel and he said, "Thou has been in Eden &gt;&gt; in the garden of God." That's right. &gt;&gt; Every precious stone was your covering. the sardis, the topaz, the diamond, the burl, the onyx, the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and the gold, and the workmanship of thy tabs, and of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou was created. Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth. That's why Satan, do you know what? He's not afraid of this church. &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of worship. &gt;&gt; He's not afraid of programs. He's not afraid of denominations. He's not afraid of traditions and creeds and how you fashion and do things. He's not afraid of it. He wants to be there. &gt;&gt; Fact is, he knows more about worship than most of us. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he was the right-hand man of God. &gt;&gt; A co-equal with everything except creation. He could not create. Hello. &gt;&gt; That was the one thing he couldn't do. That's the one thing he wants to do. &gt;&gt; And the closest he can get to it is to take creation &gt;&gt; and pervert it and twist it a little bit. &gt;&gt; That's the closest he can get to it. Thou art the anointed cherub that coverth all. I have set thee so. Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God. Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in all. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee. Brother Brand says concerning this watch the evil controls of this world. Now as we read it in Ezekiel 38 and he turns to it rather 28 and 12 thou has been in Eden. He says now you know because this was addressed to King Tyrus and he said and you know that the king of Tyrus at that time could not have been in Eden for it was 4,000 years from that thou has been in Eden. Who's he talking to? He's talking to Satan in that king. Right. &gt;&gt; He said there's He said there's Lucifer. He once dwelt in Eden. The devil was kicked out of heaven. And the very purpose that he tried to purpose in heaven, he came right down through here on the earth and is trying his best to fulfill what he had purposed. What he had he purposed. What had he purposed? He purposed that he might get a a child of God and get her to believe his words. So he appealed to her mind. &gt;&gt; And he appealed to the eye gate. Now I'm just starting to open up to a whole another area. So I want you to stay very very focused. So he appealed to the eye gate. The prophet of God says and we know also scientifically that the body has five gates or channels seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling. And that the spirit has five channels which I help myself to remember. I simply call it my car memory. imagination, conscience, uh, affection and reasoning. And at least four of those are certainly centered in the mind. Your conscience and your affection, your reasoning, and your imagination, your memory. I want to for this morning's service, I want to refer to them as kingdoms. So we have the kingdom of sight. Oh, what would we do? You talk about you talk about tantalizing &gt;&gt; the human psyche, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; By sight today. &gt;&gt; We talk about television. What about computers? &gt;&gt; What about text phones? &gt;&gt; What about all this technology that we have today? What about all of this stuff? What would you do without sight? And then you get on there and and and with sight and you begin to see some. What do you think Satan's using it for? Just so that we end up they call it a couch potato. Excuse me. He he inspires all kinds of traps and sin from that. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And then that kingdom, the king of the eye kingdom, the king, the king of the sight merges, merges with the king of the affections &gt;&gt; and begins to pervert &gt;&gt; that whole thing. Or he merges with the king of the imagination or merges with the king of the memory &gt;&gt; and then doubles his power. says, "Remember remember when that person did that to you? Remember what that person said to you?" And then it begins to generate within you some reaction, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's looking for a reaction. And Eve looked and the scripture says, "When the woman saw &gt;&gt; the tree, &gt;&gt; she saw it was good for food. It was pleasant to the eyes. It was something to be desired. You know, the only problem was she's looking at the wrong tree. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Ernie, we have a prophet messenger. And I just want to make sure I don't get ahead of myself. I have much to say. He revealed Jesus Christ. That was his whole mission. That's why God raised him up. That's why God endowed him. That's why the pillar of fire stood with him. That's why he would not lay any of his words fall to the ground. That's why when he revealed the secrets of the hearts not hundreds, thousands of times, it never never missed. Not one time. Who's speaking? I'll tell you who's speaking. The spirit of truth. Not a man from Indiana, the spirit of truth that chose the vessel in Satan's Eden and said, "Speak this, &gt;&gt; say this." &gt;&gt; And that turned the people's attention to Christ, the tree of life. &gt;&gt; And he began to tell them things about this tree that they did not know. They didn't learn it in a Bible school. They never learned it in theology. They never learned it in philosophy. They could not possibly know these things. And he's speaking it from a divine source &gt;&gt; and opening up the secrets of the scripture &gt;&gt; which would go sideways and conflict with what man had learned. We're not trying to weigh it out against what man taught. We are hearing it from God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; And he's pointing to the tree strange things, things we hadn't heard before. And he's not saying you have to understand this, &gt;&gt; you have to do this, you have to do that. He simply says this, and I say this to this congregation, look on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Satan cannot create. &gt;&gt; He didn't create the iron, &gt;&gt; the steel. &gt;&gt; He didn't create fabric, &gt;&gt; right? But he began to take it out of the earth and he developed fabric. Oh, we look at it. I like that. The eye gate. &gt;&gt; Gets a hold of it. And your friend or your wife says, "Oh, you look good in that." I do. &gt;&gt; Oh, sets up an imagination. Maybe I'm going to impress some people. I have to have a certain body language. I have to I have to, you know, make a certain statement. Come on, folks. Don't sound like you've been back in the, you know, back in some previous age. You know, that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; And we go into a restaurant. What do you What do you like to drink? Let me see. What do I want? Do you have this kind of lemonade? No, not that. That's too sweet. Do you have this other kind? Do you have this? Do you have that? Is we want to, you know, we want it just to be just right for how we feel, right? Then &gt;&gt; Oh, I know you're going to get quieter yet. &gt;&gt; And then the food comes and say, "Oh, that's presented so nice." When you've ever heard presented, I mean, when I was a kid, presented, there's your potatoes. There's your beef. Eat it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't really care. Click. Do &gt;&gt; you ever have it? Eat the broccoli. Eat that stuff. Eat it. Well, I didn't have too much trouble. I I enjoyed most of everything. But and that was a problem, too. But now it's it's presented nice. &gt;&gt; Well, isn't it nice the way it's presented? So now you know so we eat and we eat and we Why do we continue to eat? Because it tastes good, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And maybe all you skinny people, it's not a problem for you, but for me it's a problem. &gt;&gt; I look at it and oh and I can't have that. I'd love to have that. Why? Because the flesh is calling for it. &gt;&gt; That's the age we're in. When have you had an age that was so consumed with what you eat &gt;&gt; and what you drink &gt;&gt; and how it looks &gt;&gt; and the appeal and and and then all this fabric and here here's it's not it's not just man that does it. Satan's inspired it and they pull out all this fabric and now it just can't be fabric. It's got to be the right color. &gt;&gt; It's got to be the right color for this age. And he's got some demonpossessed people in there that are doing all the design work for men and women. Well, this will accentuate, you know, the right part of the body. This will accentuate the legs of the lady. This this this kind of heel or this kind of shoe or this kind of, you know, whatever more, you know, I'm speaking the truth &gt;&gt; and it's going to accentuate. And here comes a believer sister and well, haven't you got anything else? Well, what do you what do you think you What are you going to try to do? Cover your shoulders or cover your elbows or something? You know, this is what people wear today. This is You mean you don't want this? Is this This is as skinny as a uh Well, I use Brother Ben's language. It's a wiener, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's a skin over a wiener. &gt;&gt; And this is just a this is just a stocking. Hey, I see I see women dressed in stuff today up and down the street. Thousands of them. And my socks are thicker than their tops, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; it's true. &gt;&gt; Don't act like a bunch of Presbyterians now. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to believe the message. Is that what the message says? Is that what it says? &gt;&gt; What has he done? He's managed to dredge up out of the earth. He does He can't create a color. He can only develop one. Right. &gt;&gt; And then what do you think this whole auto industry is? Oh, we just went through a terrible meltdown and General Motors went into bankruptcy. You're you're going to think, you see, maybe I was too deep and now I'm too shallow. But we got people that got to paddle around the in the shallow end, too. All you men. Come on. &gt;&gt; All you men, come on. &gt;&gt; You you you look at the newspaper. I do. And I don't think I'm a freak. I look and say, "Wow, that car looks nice. I wonder what it drives like. I wonder what it feels like." You know, and you you look at it what it it's appeals to you. &gt;&gt; And pretty soon you you know, you see yourself maybe driving, is that the vehicle for you? And does that make the kind of statement and all you know who's inspiring that? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost isn't worried about how you look coming to church. &gt;&gt; That's right. He's not so worried about that. And then so we're we're we're we're enticed by it. I'll say enticed. Maybe you say, "Well, okay, we we desire it." Be careful. We're not looking at the wrong tree. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, I have to have wheels." That's fine. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about wheels now. We're talking about being enticed and being enchanted beyond even your means. &gt;&gt; That's right. Preach it. &gt;&gt; He's like, "Well, you don't you don't have to put anything down. Zero financing and zero payment down. Don't worry about it till 2010. &gt;&gt; Don't fall for that. &gt;&gt; I'd like to stop preaching right now, but I think I should carry on." And then you sign on the dotted line and you find out on down the road someplace that you know you've been kind of brought in. Now here's here's my point. Here's a very important point. The reason why and I hope you can follow me now. The reason why I'm stressing this and I'm going from, you know, maybe one extreme to the other is that there is there is a line there's actually a line where uh necessity we have necessities and where we may have wants and desires. Well, I'll go to the scripture. Now, this may sound like it's completely off the subject. It's not. It connects directly. Brother Brandham is standing and revealing and a now no one notice a pillar of fire is moving out over the people. So it's over this man. It's over this woman and he speaks and reveals the secret of the heart. Pentecost and the church world and the religious world which Satan had already deceived thought that he was just a gifted man and that was a gift of discernment and they were missing it. So he said not a few times perhaps hundreds of times this scripture for the word notice closely the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing a sunder of soul and spirit. never said dividing a sunder between body and spirit. &gt;&gt; Not between those 10 kingdoms, but between spirit and soul. &gt;&gt; And soul only has one channel which is made for the word of God. &gt;&gt; And you have your free will to either doubt it or believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And so here we have now these 10 kingdoms of the body and the and of the spirit, all those five channels of each and we see things, we hear things, all the sights and the sounds and all the design and the civilization. Friends, that is why he was saying in one sentence, this civilization is of the devil. &gt;&gt; True. He doesn't speak against wearing clothes. We have to wear clothes. &gt;&gt; But it's what kind. &gt;&gt; There's a line. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you need to look at the one tree which is the tree of life. To know how we should dress, how we should speak, how we should act, how we should worship, how we should do everything, you must be looking at the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. Are you being helped? &gt;&gt; I just have to speak pretty much from inspiration. &gt;&gt; Now, here comes this messenger, Brother DJ, in the end time, and he has an experience And a man, another minister has a dream and tells him the dream and says, "Brother Brandham, this see this mountain and people are gathered around and a sharp object comes into your hand and you cleave off, remember mountain is very important. You cleave off the top of this mountain and there's white rock, granite rock, and there's writings, but the sun, the sun, not the su n, but the s o n Christ has never shone on that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for those of you, there's a little bit of swimming water. when Jesus stood here on earth a little over 2,000 years ago and he said to the people when you see the days of Noah again when they planted and they built and they did all this e economic thing was happening when you see that happening not locally but globally when you see that happening and you see the days of Noah and you see the days of Sodom the days of Lot once again when you see those globally then Even that will it be when the son of man speaking of himself it will be even that when you see those conditions let it be known that that is the time that the son of man I I the son s o n will be revealed I'll be revealed up there I'll be revealed and so when Satan's Eden has finally developed oh the culture and the scientific achievement and the advancement and the technology and the knowledge that has been gained and universities and places of learning all over the globe and and according to Daniel going to and fro throughout the whole earth. &gt;&gt; We're there, friends. &gt;&gt; Even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man I will be revealed again. In other words, it will be held a secret until that time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. Very good. And now he calls a man and and and and and he's gifted in a special way and I don't have to go into the details and he even William Brando himself wonders about his life and others see certain traits and gifts and so on in him and and he see that he's a gifted person a very gifted person and then God begins to confirm with supernatural crippled twisted up child jumping out of his out of his arms in a meeting. He He's not trying to bring this on. This is just a local service. And the news goes and spreads all over the world. And a dead boy raised in Finland killed in an auto accident. And I spoke to the wife of the man who drove the car that killed the boy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So I'm here as a witness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things happened not in a corner. The Mormons have a prophet and I don't know where his prophecies were. I'm talking about a prophet as Jesus said, "I've said nothing in secret. &gt;&gt; I've said it in public. &gt;&gt; Token toilet. Go and ask them. I didn't say anything in secret. He didn't say anything in secret. This isn't some secret thing. This is on tape. &gt;&gt; This is for you to hear. &gt;&gt; Be diligent. And I will say to you in the name of the Lord, look on this. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he cleaved off the top of the mountain. And then he said when he gave that, oh my, you have to help me. He said when he uh at that at that time notice in ser is this a time listen very close don't miss this he said notice in the writing that was on the rock I was interpreting it for them &gt;&gt; they were elated that's the mystery of God that's been not understood for years &gt;&gt; that's part one &gt;&gt; he said Could that be? Could that be that? He's saying, "Sir, is this the time?" &gt;&gt; Could that be that? He said, "And then notice, in some mysterious way, we picked up &gt;&gt; out of the air a sharp tool that opened up the top." Now, he's talking just from the dream. &gt;&gt; Sharp a sharp tool that opened up the top. In there was white granite, &gt;&gt; but it wasn't interpreted. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no letters. &gt;&gt; I didn't interpret that. &gt;&gt; I just looked at it &gt;&gt; and said to the brethren, look on this. &gt;&gt; He said, "And that's fulfilled tonight." &gt;&gt; I didn't interpret it. &gt;&gt; That's fulfilled tonight. &gt;&gt; And serves as this the time. But then the next year, the seals are open. the seven angels have have attended and have commissioned him and goes back and preaches the seals 569 pages I believe and never went back and enlarged or or change the paragraphs or anything said there it is and at the end of it that's thus sayeth the lord when he comes to the seventh seal he said and notice the next thing now a time has gone by and the and this dream has now happened Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the next thing now," he said, "I took some kind of a bar and cut it off." Talking about the same thing, "And on the inside was white rock that had nothing wrote on it." And at that time, I started to the west, which is where I went, and the fulfillment of it was in the visitation of the angels. And I told them all, I said, "Don't go out west. people wanted to follow him. He said, "Don't come out there." Because he knew he was going out &gt;&gt; for a special meeting with God. And he said, "Stay here &gt;&gt; and look on this till I return." &gt;&gt; He said, "Went for the blast. Return back &gt;&gt; to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting the unwritten word." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he said, "It can't be anything new. It has to be in the Bible." &gt;&gt; But it was in the Bible, but it had not been interpreted. &gt;&gt; And in the dream part, he said that was fulfilled tonight. It's not been interpreted. When he comes in the seventh seal, he said, "Now it has been interpreted. The Holy Spirit has interpreted it. [Music] You see the thing is you can't write a revealing. &gt;&gt; So the dream you can write the dream but when it's revealed it must be spoken. &gt;&gt; So it's spoken out &gt;&gt; and becomes a spoken word &gt;&gt; for the spoken word. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's the spoken word that's the original seed. &gt;&gt; And so it becomes spoken. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the spoken word is taken in faith in the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; Not through the eye gate or the hearing gate, but through the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; down into the soul. &gt;&gt; And even against the human mind sometimes say, "I'm having trouble with that." But something in your soul is saying, "I believe that." Right. &gt;&gt; I'm looking down into this audience &gt;&gt; and I see men and women of all stations of life. Some have been looking down here. I see a brother that was a leader of the communist rebels in South America. I look down, I see businessmen. I see men that are workers and laborers. I see farmers. whatever more and you sisters but there had to come a time &gt;&gt; when the word &gt;&gt; came into your hearing yet &gt;&gt; but it did not go into just an imagination or reasoning &gt;&gt; that kingdom did not join a force with another king &gt;&gt; it went down from there into the soul &gt;&gt; and something within said I believe that &gt;&gt; something inside said I can't let Oh, &gt;&gt; your parents, your friends, your religious associates may have said, "You're crazy. You've gone off the deep end. &gt;&gt; You're going insane." But something inside said, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; And it cost you friends. It cost you family. It cost you jobs. It cost you money. It cost you everything. But your soul said, "I believe that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he cleaved off the top and there's groups of ministers around him and he went out. Then he left and they said he went down a little dip and over a little knob and down a little dip and got smaller and smaller and disappeared. Just before he left he said look on this &gt;&gt; in this Eden Over here in another Eden was another vessel controlled by Lucifer who was cast out of heaven. And he's saying to another virgin, look on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she looked. And when she saw it, something set up in the next kingdom of the the imagination. You'll be like gods. You'll know things. You'll become wise. Things that are secret to you. You'll understand them. You'll know them. And she partook and was pregnantated with his seed. And that's why God cursed him and changed the structure of his body. Right. &gt;&gt; And said, "The seed of the woman is going to crush your head." &gt;&gt; You can't you can't make that an apricot or a banana or an orange. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth two children. And one is a liar. One's a hater of God. One's a deceiver. One took the even energy that God gave him and slew his brother. and murdered him. The first murder death came and the Bible says that then Adam knew her again. Only two acts, three children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth Seth. &gt;&gt; And she said, "For God hath appointed me another seed &gt;&gt; instead of Abel who Adam who Cain slew." &gt;&gt; And now here's another vessel, a different kind of a vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he is he is possessed &gt;&gt; of the very god that cast Lucifer out. [Music] &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; Expose this tree. &gt;&gt; Speak with such force. It will cause the people to turn from their reasoning and from their religion and from their history in their memory channel to a revelation of Jesus Christ in this day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; And he says to the people, look on this. &gt;&gt; That's all. Look on this. &gt;&gt; Didn't say you have to understand it. didn't say you have to figure it out. Just look on this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing. Listen, close. I'm closing now. Dividing a sunder of soul and spirit. And so here's this world and hey friends, why did this Elijah speak so much about the fashions and the way people dress? Because he's going to the most fundamental &gt;&gt; part of our human living where Satan he he he has he cannot create something. So he takes what has been created and he refineses it and designs it and fashions it and molds it in such a state until we are hey when you go to a mall what do they call window shopping we are looking everywhere and his he he what he's saying is we're looking at it we're looking at this we look at the car we look at that we look at it all all its eye gate High gate. I gate. The kingdom is there. And then as soon as you feel attracted, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Whether it be a a dress or a suit of clothes or a boy or a girl. Just take a breather &gt;&gt; from that view &gt;&gt; and have a look at the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Just look on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just look on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look on this word that has come. &gt;&gt; Look on the revelation of this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see what kind of a feeling that brings. &gt;&gt; Oh God. My God. &gt;&gt; How great thou art. How great thou art. Thanks, brother Larry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; From Eden to Eden. &gt;&gt; That's the only way we're going to get to this next Eden. &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said when that top was cleaved off and that writing was there. He can't write it out. Had to speak &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit takes what is spoken and reveals it to you. &gt;&gt; You can't write the revelation. &gt;&gt; It comes to you one way to you brother Roger another way. Brother Tony another way comes to me another way. We all but it will reveal Christ. It will always be Christ, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We can never reduce our spiritual life down into some reasoning process or some religious process. &gt;&gt; You talk about war, all the wars are religious wars. &gt;&gt; Even in the east today, it's all religious wars. Iraq, that's a religious war. what took place in second world war and all the rest all religious war if you read anything about it or see anything about it you'll see the Vatican come into view the Eastern Orthodox Church come into view why it's all religious things that's happening brother Brandon made a statement actually didn't make a statement he was an act he did. And I want you to think about it. I sat in the meetings and I heard this and I've listened to the tapes and I've marveled how one man I've never heard anyone else, neither have you, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; stand and say he's here. I take I take every spirit under my control &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not every soul &gt;&gt; and not every body &gt;&gt; but every spirit. In other words, I take your affections under control. I take your imagination under control. I take your conscience out of under control for the glory of God. And then when that pillar of fire would move over one person, he would tell him clearly like the woman, if you haven't seen deep, called the deep and we just talked about it, I think at brother Deepac Titus's the other day. And when he stood in front of that woman, brother Deeppac was saying, well, there was a woman that had been called a witch. I said, "That's on deep call to the deep." And that woman is standing there and she's trying, she's just to balance and settle herself. She's nervous. And he says, he says, he said, "You got a nervous nervous heart. You're nervous. Very nervous." He said, "That's because there's been a lie told on you." And he goes just like that. A lie has been told on you. Said, "Isn't that right?" Yes. He says he you it been you were said you are a witch. And they said, "That's right. And it was a preacher that said that." And said, "That's right." You see, he now they heard that. She heard that. She didn't know where to put it. Now it's in her thoughts. It's in her mind. And it goes actually into her merges one kingdom with the other one. She heard it with the eargate went down and became physical in her body. And she become a nervous woman, a nervous wreck. But the word, the word coming out of this other messenger, speaking the truth to her, set her free from that thing. My brother, my sister, we haven't got time for the devil's lies. We haven't got time for all of his reasoning. We haven't got time for all of his temptation. And I'm saying to you today as I close, don't look at that tree. Don't look at all the glamorous things the world produces for us. Don't look at what you know what your position, your job, or anything else. Look to this tree. &gt;&gt; Look to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Say, look on him. &gt;&gt; Look on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my message to you today. The scripture says of this day, of this time, they overcame him. In fact, is I I thought a good deal of what brother Tim Tim how God used him for us in the camp meeting. But he say he spoke and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their life unto the death. Those three things. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says to him that overcomemeth in each age to him that overcomemeth to him that overcomemeth &gt;&gt; in the leodyian age the age most treacherous age of all. Listen friends things are moving so fast so fast. so rapid it's bypassing. Even some of you young couples that have your family and have your children, I can tell you without even sitting down and talking to you, you almost feel like an antique beside your teenagers because they are so, you know, they're they're so fitted and and suited to this generation. Hey, I see great grandchildren, &gt;&gt; not grandchildren, great grandchildren, and they get a mouse in their hand. They know exactly what to do. They know exactly how to click it, when to click it, and what to do. I say, "I can't believe this." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's just moving so fast, &gt;&gt; so quickly, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's the age. But the scripture says to him that overcomemeth, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, please take this home with you. There is no way to overcome this age by looking at this tree. &gt;&gt; If we look at the tree and what this what the tree of knowledge is, don't forget it's good &gt;&gt; and evil. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; What I preach today is to alert you that only by looking at this tree here will we know where the line is between good and evil. &gt;&gt; You have to wear clothes. You do drive a car. You have to do these things, etc. But there's a line between what is good and evil. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; And only by looking to the tree of life will we be able to discern &gt;&gt; because it divides between the spirit and the soul. &gt;&gt; He won't leave us in the dark. &gt;&gt; We all need we need supernatural wisdom in this time. &gt;&gt; We're facing decisions. We we have to make our way through life. So I say to you friends, children of God, the God that called you. &gt;&gt; May he go with you. &gt;&gt; May he prosper you in your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May he ever be with you. &gt;&gt; You're his. I know he loves you very deeply. &gt;&gt; That's why he gave himself for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He called you because you were his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you heard him because you were his. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And another they will not follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I trust that the word today will be food for your soul. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And guide you in this way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My last phrase to you is look on this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's just stand. My dear Lord Jesus, I so crave and yearn to be a disciple, a faithful disciple. &gt;&gt; I know that that is in the hearts of the people that are here. I see it on their faces. I see a deep yearning. When we sing the course to be like Jesus, to be like Jesus, it's not merely some word set to a melody, but it expresses something within our being. Oh lamb of God, glorious one. I think so often, Lord, and you bring it to my mind how the saraphims in the prophet Isaiah speaking and they cried, "Holy, holy, holy, holy." Lord, my soul today cries out, "Holy, holy, holy." A Holy Ghost, a holy message, a holy word, the Holy Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. a holy people and a holy prophet and a holy prophets, the holy one, the Lord Jesus Christ. All we can say is holy, holy, holy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I pray that you'll fill not only the few, but that you would fill those that are gathered here today. &gt;&gt; Fill and refill &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost. baptized, Lord, and refill those that are craving and desiring. And if there if there's not sufficient hunger, I pray, Lord, you'll cause them to thirst after you. Create within us a clean heart, oh God. And I pray, Father, that you will do uh the extraordinary, do the beyond our expectation. I pray father that you will come amongst us and meet every need that may be here present amongst us now in Jesus Christ's name. Oh Lord, we want to worship you &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; I'd like to have sing if we would please. I worship you in spirit and truth. And I felt I felt this morning and while I was in the study, there may only be one. There may be more than one. There might be several. I don't want you just to come for, you know, pain in my arm or something. But you have a a craving. You have a need, a great need in your in your being and you would like to be prayed with. There's ministers here and we will just pray for you if you want to come forward and stand here. You might just have something that you're looking to God about. But it's something that's been it's very very I'll say it's very special, very serious. It's something you're at that point where you need God to come on the scene for you. And there's brothers here in a congregation that would pray. And you're welcome to come while we sing. We worship you in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Brother Andes, would you come together?

And as we go from this place, &gt;&gt; let us have one thing in our minds. I shall look to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; In him alone will I keep my eyes fixed upon. Glory. May the congregation say, "Glory to God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Dier, offer thanks for the to our Lord Jesus, please. God. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, great heavenly father. We appreciate you this afternoon for your goodness, your kindness, your divine provision that you made to us by your word, oh God, that we can assemble under the banner of the Holy Spirit and look to you, the lamb of God, the one alone who's worthy of all thanksgiving, of all adoration and all praise. I we thank you for the word that means everything to us Lord for the tree of life that is blooming again in this hour father that for your invitation that you have given to us to come back to take to eat oh God and to be changed and transformed and to stand and be made every with hole in the sire dear Jesus we thank you that you restoring us back to that Eden oh God and that his word has come to accomplish this very purpose in the midst of your church in this dark and dismal all day. I pray that you'll cause our attention, our focus to be, oh God, entirely upon you, oh God. Even when the enemy comes as a flood to try to distract us, to remove us uh from the objective that have been set before us, Lord, I just ask that you keep each one of us uh with our eyes fixed upon you, oh God, refusing to compromise, refusing to let go of you, oh God, putting a firm grip upon you and your promises, knowing that they're here and amen, and that they're going to bring us to the expected end. for you promise us uh a shalom, a millennium, a place of peace where sorrow and pain and suffering will no longer be in existence. Lord, that's why we want to thank you this day for reminding us Lord Jesus of your great plan that you have for us and for assuring us of the victory regardless of all the opposition. You have given us victory through the blood of Jesus Christ. Uh and by the testimony of our mouths that you made we have been made more than conqueror and that the enemy has no power even as his head was crushed. Uh we know that father under this bride you say that a god of peace who br Satan under his feet. Oh God, that's why we thank you today for coming amongst us, Lord, for giving us liberty to worship you today and to give you thanks and praise for the things that you have done.

We give you praise and glory and honor. We just thank you this day for coming again. For ministering to us, Lord, for taking our hearts and setting them, oh God, in a channel of faith to believe that his things are true.
