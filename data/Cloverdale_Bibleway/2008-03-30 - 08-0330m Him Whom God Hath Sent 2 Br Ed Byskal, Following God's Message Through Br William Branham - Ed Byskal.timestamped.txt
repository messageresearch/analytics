[1:54] the well.

[2:53] is passing this way.
[2:58] Just like I'm going to hear the sermon
[3:03] preached on the mount.
[3:08] Just like I'm coming to hear the prophet
[3:13] call my name out.
[3:18] I've come here expecting.
[3:23] I've come to receive.
[3:28] And the same pillar of fire is here. I
[3:34] believe
[3:37] he's passing this way.
[3:42] He's passing this way.
[3:47] So, lift up your hands. Lift up your
[3:51] voice. Hold at a place.
[3:57] It's not just a story we all know. It's
[4:02] not just a distant future hope. But the

[5:25] King of all kings right here and today
[5:29] is passing this way.

[5:45] [Music]
[5:46] But the king of all kings right here and
[5:50] today
[5:51] &gt;&gt; is passing this way.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; This way.
[6:00] [Applause]
[6:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[6:09] Let's sing. Think about his love. Think
[6:11] about his goodness. Let's turn to the
[6:14] word.
[6:19] Think about his love.
[6:24] Oh, think about his goodness.
[6:28] [Music]
[6:30] I
[6:31] [Music]
[6:39] for
[6:41] [Music]
[6:45] me.
[6:52] Glor.
[6:54] [Music]

[7:23] [Music]
[7:33] So great.
[7:40] Oh my god.
[7:43] [Music]
[8:00] [Applause]
[8:01] [Music]
[8:14] Great.
[8:19] [Music]
[8:23] It's
[8:24] &gt;&gt; measurless.
[8:26] &gt;&gt; Boundless.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Wonderful to have you all here this
[8:31] morning and all who are live streaming
[8:35] or will stream the service. We say God
[8:38] bless you each one and uh we're
[8:42] expecting great things from him. Uh the
[8:47] devil's a great adversary. He's a good
[8:49] adversary.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Uh but greater is he that's in you
[8:55] &gt;&gt; than he that's in the world.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; And that'll be almost some of the focus
[9:00] uh in this morning's service as well. Uh
[9:04] we're just really thankful for
[9:07] what the Lord is doing day by day. It's
[9:11] marvelous just to sit on the sidelines
[9:13] and watch him work.
[9:15] Uh he never tires.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; He never sleeps. He's always true.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; We fail. He never fails.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Our words fail. His words never fail. We
[9:29] don't quite live up to all of our
[9:30] promises, but he lives up to everyone.
[9:33] Isn't he wonderful?
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to have you stand
[9:39] and excuse me, just before we read
[9:42] scripture, I want to sing that chorus.
[9:44] All that I have and all that I am and
[9:48] all that I ever can be. And I'd like you
[9:50] to lift your voice and from your heart.
[9:54] Sing it as a prayer of worship to God
[9:58] with all the meaning that you can muster
[10:00] within yourself. All that I have and all
[10:04] that I am.
[10:08] All that I am.
[10:13] All
[10:15] I am.
[10:18] All
[10:20] I shall never
[10:24] [Music]
[10:34] [Applause]
[10:37] [Music]
[10:39] surrender
[10:41] to thee
[10:44] once again.
[10:47] Heat. Heat.
[10:57] I shall ever
[11:02] [Music]
[11:18] surrender
[11:20] to thee.
[11:22] [Applause]
[11:24] Oh, we love you, Lord.
[11:27] We want to stand as uh as individuals
[11:29] and stand as a company of people today.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; We want to give you our deepest thanks,
[11:38] our appreciation, our worship.
[11:41] Receive, oh God, as we worship you in
[11:44] spirit and in truth.
[11:47] We want now, Lord, to come to the word
[11:49] and worship you in truth. And let that
[11:52] sharp two-edged sword just sever
[11:56] anything of the world that would hinder
[11:58] us, oh God. Anything of self, anything
[12:02] of our complexes, Lord. Anything that we
[12:06] would have of any question or doubt,
[12:09] sever it from us. Remove it from us, oh
[12:12] Lord. And I pray that you will brood and
[12:15] breathe upon us, oh God. May it be felt
[12:19] in every room, in every place,
[12:21] Lord. Father, where the service today is
[12:24] going, let your spirit and word
[12:27] penetrate our hearts with the changing,
[12:31] transforming power of the Holy Spirit.
[12:35] We trust you, Lord. These are your
[12:38] sheep, the sheep of your fold. You
[12:40] bought them, Lord. You've bought us. We
[12:43] are your purchase. You have redeemed us.
[12:47] The debt has been paid and Satan has no
[12:50] claim on your people. Pray that you'll
[12:53] heal the sick, deliver the bound, oh
[12:56] God, and do all manner of glorious
[13:00] things that your name may be praised and
[13:02] glorified in Jesus Christ's name. Now
[13:05] Lord, as I stand here at the post of
[13:08] duty, I pray that you will take my lips
[13:10] and use them as a tool,
[13:14] the hearts and minds of the people to be
[13:17] surrendered to you completely
[13:20] and take full control in the name of
[13:23] Jesus Christ for your glory. Amen. Amen.
[13:29] We're conscious this morning of the many
[13:32] that are
[13:34] uh actually joined with us here in
[13:36] service
[13:38] and and it's really a a blessed thing. I
[13:41] hear from them regularly on emails and
[13:44] this last this last week
[13:48] uh there was
[13:52] nine under to 300 over 270
[13:56] other locations
[13:58] that were live streaming the service.
[14:01] And within about three or four days,
[14:03] there was another 433
[14:06] not individuals locations
[14:09] that were had uh had streamed the
[14:11] service. And uh so you know this is not
[14:15] a man's doing. This is not our doing.
[14:18] This is just God's doing. And we just
[14:20] want to be what we're supposed to be.
[14:22] And everybody contributes
[14:24] uh their own part. And that's that's
[14:26] that's what is wonderful that God allows
[14:29] us to have a part. Amen. So I want to
[14:32] thank you for your uh not only physical
[14:35] support, your financial support, your
[14:38] emotional support, your words of
[14:40] encouragement, and your spirit of unity.
[14:43] It's a powerful force. Just a powerful
[14:47] force. And we want to I want to express
[14:50] my thanks on behalf of God to you
[14:53] because I know it's pleasing in God's
[14:55] sight.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you'd like to follow along in
[14:58] the scripture, turn to uh Romans the 9th
[15:03] chapter
[15:05] and we're going to be reading from the
[15:08] 8th verse.
[15:11] For those of you that were here last
[15:13] Wednesday,
[15:15] uh it will be a benefit I believe to you
[15:18] to have had that service
[15:26] starting with verse 8.
[15:29] That is that which are children of the
[15:33] flesh. These are not the children of
[15:36] God. But the children of the promise are
[15:38] counted for the seed. For this is the
[15:42] word of promise. At this time will I
[15:44] come and Sarah shall have a son. Not
[15:48] only this, but when Rebecca also had
[15:50] conceived by one, even by our father
[15:52] Isaac, for the children being not yet
[15:55] born, neither having done any good or
[15:58] evil, that the purpose of God according
[16:01] to election might stand. not of works,
[16:05] but of him that calleth. It was said
[16:08] unto her, "The elder shall serve the
[16:12] younger." As it is written, Jacob have I
[16:15] loved, and but Esau have I hated. What
[16:18] shall we say then? Is there
[16:20] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
[16:24] For for he saith to Moses, I will have
[16:28] mercy on whom I will have mercy and will
[16:31] have compassion on whom I will have
[16:33] compassion. So then it is not of him
[16:37] that willth nor of him that runth but of
[16:41] God that showeth mercy.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And turn quickly if you would
[16:46] please to John's gospel the sixth
[16:48] chapter while we read the verses we read
[16:51] on Wednesday as well.
[16:55] John 6 and we're reading from verse 26
[16:58] down through verse 29.
[17:11] Jesus answered them and said, "Verily,
[17:13] verily, I say unto you, you seek me not
[17:15] because you saw the miracles, but
[17:18] because you did eat of the loaves and
[17:20] were filled. Labor not for the meat
[17:23] which perisheth, but for that meat which
[17:26] endureth unto everlasting life, whom the
[17:30] Son of man shall give unto you, for whom
[17:33] hath for him hath God the Father sealed.
[17:38] Then said they unto him,
[17:41] What shall we do that we might work the
[17:44] works of God? And Jesus answered and
[17:48] said unto him, unto them rather, "This
[17:51] is the work of God that you believe on
[17:54] him whom he hath sent."
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats.
[18:10] This is the work of God.
[18:14] This is the work of God.
[18:17] that can be taken a a number of ways.
[18:21] This is the labor that God does. This is
[18:23] God's labor and I'll touch on that. And
[18:27] this is what God would have us do.
[18:31] This is the work of God that you believe
[18:34] on him whom he hath sent. There's a lot
[18:37] of activity today around uh in religious
[18:40] matters. Lot of activity. people wanting
[18:44] to do something for God. And the thing
[18:46] that we could best do for God is believe
[18:48] on him whom God hath sent.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of people think that's just
[18:54] believing on Jesus Christ. That's not
[18:56] so. Uh in the Old Testament, Moses
[18:59] reflected Jesus Christ. He was a part of
[19:02] Jesus Christ in that he reflected Christ
[19:04] and they in that day had to believe on
[19:06] him.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; That's just clear and simple. Had to
[19:09] believe all the way through the
[19:10] scriptures. And so we will enlarge on
[19:13] that. And the apostle Paul said clearly
[19:15] that I had to believe on him as he
[19:19] followed Christ so follow him. So
[19:22] there's a believing on on him that God
[19:25] hath sent and uh that uh that is to be
[19:28] enlarged on as we go along.
[19:31] Apostle Paul in the first uh scriptures
[19:34] which we read he said that uh that in uh
[19:38] verse 11 of uh Romans 9 says for the
[19:41] children uh being not yet born neither
[19:44] having done any good or evil thing that
[19:48] the purpose of God
[19:51] according to election that God's purpose
[19:56] the purpose that he has and that purpose
[19:58] is according to election ction and the
[20:03] that election is uh very interesting and
[20:07] I'm going to just show it to you here on
[20:09] the slide.
[20:11] Uh
[20:13] it was uh
[20:17] it is the one before that I'm sorry.
[20:24] All right. Election.
[20:26] The act of picking out or choosing
[20:30] the act of God's free will
[20:33] by which before the foundation of the
[20:36] world he decreed his blessings to
[20:39] certain persons. The decree made from
[20:42] choice
[20:44] by which he determined to bless certain
[20:48] persons through Christ by grace. And we
[20:52] hear a great deal about a man's free
[20:55] will, our free will. You know, if we
[20:58] could see ourselves alongside of God, we
[21:00] just fail fade off into absolute
[21:03] insignificance.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Uh we shouldn't even talk about our free
[21:08] will till we think first about God's
[21:10] free will.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; God has a choice in things. And the
[21:14] Bible is clear that God chooses to use
[21:18] whomsoever he uses. He chooses actually
[21:21] to save. And the Bible even tells us
[21:23] that that uh those that believed. Those
[21:26] were the ones that had already been
[21:28] called.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; They already been called of God. And I
[21:31] know that you understand that. But the
[21:33] act of God's free will by which before
[21:36] the foundation of the world, he decreed
[21:39] his blessings to certain persons. The
[21:42] decree made from choice by which he
[21:45] determined to bless certain persons
[21:48] through Christ by grace. This is God's
[21:52] choosing. And God anoints whom he will,
[21:56] sends whom he will, talents whom he
[21:59] will, and he raises them up whom he
[22:01] will, and he puts down whom he will. And
[22:04] it's all God's doing. He's the absolute
[22:08] sovereign God
[22:10] &gt;&gt; and there's none beside him. There isn't
[22:12] a whole lot of gods and other religions
[22:15] and they see God this way, that way. You
[22:18] know, it's uh uh there's only one God,
[22:21] one creator, one eternal God.
[22:24] And to believe on him whom God has sent.
[22:27] And the Bible tells us also that the
[22:30] word of God comes to his prophets. I I
[22:34] just want to take you through a little
[22:35] quick process in about four points
[22:38] because this is kind of a summary of
[22:39] where we're going. The word of God comes
[22:43] to the prophet
[22:46] in its season.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Secondly, the elect believe
[22:53] the sign and the message. Amen.
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Number three, then the life and the
[22:59] character of God because it's not the
[23:02] man's words.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; The life and character of God then is
[23:07] transmitted
[23:10] transferred
[23:11] &gt;&gt; to the believer and that's the elected
[23:14] one. is transmitted to them. And now the
[23:17] believer has the life of God by the word
[23:21] of God through the channel of God in
[23:25] them.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; And now it is Christ in the person, the
[23:31] hope of glory.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Christ in the person. We can then say,
[23:36] "Greater is he that is in me than he
[23:40] that's in the world."
[23:41] Now, anyone can read that scripture.
[23:45] Anyone can quote that scripture and it's
[23:48] very common. Greater is he that's in me
[23:50] than he that's in the world. No, not not
[23:52] so only if you have heard him whom God
[23:58] hath sent.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Because that is the that is the channel
[24:03] through which that the the the very
[24:07] thing that is carrying the nature and
[24:09] the character of God. There's only one
[24:11] way to obtain it.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; There isn't a whole multitude of ways.
[24:15] It's not all roads lead to Chicago.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; This is one way. Amen.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; God's way
[24:23] &gt;&gt; and that's the only way that it can be
[24:25] had. God chooses whom he will.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; He endures them and he sends them and he
[24:31] gives them his word.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Then he also elects those that will hear
[24:36] that voice. As Jesus said, "My sheep
[24:41] &gt;&gt; hear my voice
[24:43] &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow." Which
[24:46] simply means there's other voices.
[24:50] my sheep. As Jesus said, I have chosen
[24:54] you.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; You've not chosen me, but I have chosen
[24:58] you. And we'll read those scriptures
[25:00] perhaps a little later on. And so now
[25:03] then Jesus is saying to believe on him
[25:07] whom he hath sent.
[25:12] I have that scripture for you. Jesus
[25:14] answered and said unto them, "This is
[25:17] the work of God, that you believe on him
[25:21] whom he hath sent."
[25:29] &gt;&gt; The work of God,
[25:31] we can call it a real labor of grace.
[25:35] A real labor of grace to get us to
[25:39] believe.
[25:41] I think God has a I think that's
[25:44] probably one of the
[25:47] uh
[25:48] probably one of the greatest things that
[25:50] God has to work on
[25:52] &gt;&gt; on us as individuals to get us to
[25:54] believe.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's so simple to believe, but
[25:58] other times it's so difficult to
[25:59] believe. As I've said before, uh when we
[26:02] try so hard to have faith or we think we
[26:05] have faith and uh doesn't seem to be
[26:08] there and then the next time it it seems
[26:11] like it's almost effortless, you've just
[26:12] accepted something and uh and God just
[26:15] does it almost does it and takes you by
[26:17] surprise because you've believed and it
[26:19] just happens and say my and we shouldn't
[26:22] be surprised at that. In the message
[26:24] Jehovah Gyra, brother Brandham said
[26:27] this. God sends someone that people can
[26:31] have confidence as a point of contact to
[26:35] contact him. We're thankful for a father
[26:38] like that, aren't we? Children, he asks
[26:41] all of us. Loving and kind, trying to do
[26:46] everything that lays within his power.
[26:50] Now, speaking of God, trying to do
[26:53] everything that lays within his power to
[26:57] get us to believe and to accept him on
[27:02] his term of love.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; I'd say that's a kind heavenly father.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; He hasn't wearied. He's doing it this
[27:11] morning
[27:12] &gt;&gt; in this service.
[27:14] He's doing it in your life,
[27:16] &gt;&gt; doing everything that he can.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. to get us to believe.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he'll send us gifts
[27:25] and he'll send his servants and he sends
[27:28] everything that he can and he'll send
[27:30] something else and he'll send something
[27:32] more and greater and and more intense to
[27:36] get us to believe. Say, God help us to
[27:39] believe.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this is the work of
[27:46] God in the Greek urggon.
[27:49] This is the work of God or in other
[27:51] words this is the labor of God. I said I
[27:54] would like to look at that two ways and
[27:57] brother Brandham has just referred to it
[27:59] now. This is a God does everything that
[28:02] he can. In other words, he he labors
[28:05] if we can use in that sense. So you can
[28:07] just see it.
[28:09] And that word also is that's what he's
[28:12] occupied with also. It has reference to
[28:15] us is I used it on Wednesday. That's
[28:18] what this is the work of God. This is
[28:20] what we should be occupied with.
[28:23] Believing on him whom God hath sent.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; And you just have to determine who that
[28:29] is.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Believe on him whom God hath sent.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; And I don't want you to just isolate,
[28:35] you know, any one single person at this
[28:37] time. But to believe on him whom God has
[28:40] sent. God may you know in a home
[28:44] &gt;&gt; I think that a husband wife should
[28:46] recognize and it would do us a whole lot
[28:48] of good to realize God has sent my
[28:51] partner to me
[28:53] &gt;&gt; God has sent this one to me
[28:56] &gt;&gt; and I recognize that and I claim all the
[28:59] benefits of almighty God
[29:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care where that partner is today
[29:03] but we claim that
[29:06] &gt;&gt; God have sent you shouldn't be in this
[29:09] church if you don't feel God has sent
[29:10] you here
[29:11] &gt;&gt; and I shouldn't be behind this pulpit if
[29:13] I don't feel God sent me here.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; It gets down to that.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; And you're sent to where you are and
[29:21] where you're working. You're sent.
[29:23] You're a messenger to somebody. You're
[29:25] there to influence somebody. It gets
[29:27] down to the personal level. And we
[29:30] believe that God sent all the saints
[29:32] down through the ages and the apostles
[29:34] and the kings and the disciples. They
[29:36] were sent men. When Jesus came, he
[29:39] called certain individuals. He didn't
[29:42] just make a mass call and say, "Whoever
[29:44] would like to come and follow me, stand
[29:46] up." That isn't what he did. As he
[29:49] traveled and as he walked, he said to
[29:51] Peter, to James, to John, to Andrew, to
[29:55] Philillip, to to Matthew, he called his
[29:58] disciples
[30:00] to come and be a part of of his ministry
[30:03] at that time. And so God labors. I just
[30:07] want to I I want to dwell on that for
[30:10] just a a moment.
[30:13] It's not what
[30:16] necessarily what we believe just at this
[30:18] moment.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; But the question I would like to ask and
[30:22] I just pose it. What is it that God
[30:24] would like us to believe?
[30:29] &gt;&gt; What would God like you to believe this
[30:31] morning? Hallelujah.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; We might be saying, "Well, uh uh I I'm
[30:36] I'm believing for something. I just
[30:38] really need something. I I need, you
[30:40] know, I need a different job or I need I
[30:42] I need some uh I need my income looked
[30:45] after. I need this. I've got some
[30:46] physical things. I got some uh you know,
[30:48] physical things uh in my family, my
[30:51] children, whatever more. My wife, my
[30:52] husband, we just need this healing."
[30:54] Maybe we ought to get our mind off of
[30:56] that just for a moment. And I would
[30:57] encourage you to say, "God, what do you
[30:59] want me to believe? Amen.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; What is it that you're presenting to me?
[31:06] &gt;&gt; And give me a heart to believe that
[31:11] &gt;&gt; this is the work of God. So, we should
[31:14] ask him what it is that he would have us
[31:16] to believe. Now,
[31:21] uh I have a slide here also.
[31:32] out of a message. Ephesians parallels
[31:35] Joshua.
[31:37] Now, brother Bram starts out. Now, who
[31:40] could doubt that? That's what Paul said.
[31:43] That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's
[31:46] writing.
[31:48] That's what he taught his church. The
[31:50] church positionally before the
[31:53] foundation of the world. When God in his
[31:56] labor pain was bringing forth, bringing
[32:00] forth you knowing what you would do, he
[32:04] positionally placed you into his own
[32:06] body to be a housewife, to be a farmer,
[32:11] to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be
[32:14] this or to be that. He placed you
[32:18] positionally. And I think we could say
[32:20] amen to that. Amen.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; But now I want you to uh I'd like to
[32:23] draw your attention to the words God in
[32:26] his labor pain.
[32:30] I'm talking about the work of God. Now
[32:32] God in his labor pain. You know that God
[32:35] strives. God deals. God is constantly
[32:39] bringing us into situations, facing us
[32:42] with things. And we may think this is a
[32:45] disaster. when in fact God is laboring
[32:48] to bring you to a certain place, seeking
[32:50] that you would believe, seeking that the
[32:53] inconsistencies in your life would be
[32:55] gone. He's seeking to build character in
[32:58] you. He's seeking to and he moves in
[33:01] close to you by the Holy Spirit with his
[33:03] presence and you become maybe
[33:05] emotionally involved and and maybe tears
[33:07] come to your eyes when God's God's
[33:09] trying to say, I I I wanted to go beyond
[33:12] tears. I wanted to go beyond good
[33:14] feeling. I wanted to go beyond just
[33:17] being happy. I wanted to go beyond just
[33:19] clapping our hands. I wanted to go
[33:22] beyond, oh, we're so blessed right
[33:24] today, but tomorrow it's something else.
[33:27] God's trying to bring his men and women
[33:29] to places of real character, sunship, as
[33:33] the prophet said, to bring you
[33:34] positionally. And it and and you as a
[33:37] father or or mothers as parents and you
[33:40] have uh your children and and you can
[33:42] see that they have a uh they have a
[33:45] capacity, they have an ability, they
[33:47] have something, oh, they could go so
[33:50] much further than they than they're
[33:52] going right now. And you you can see
[33:54] some objectives for them. and and you do
[33:57] everything in your power to to nurture
[33:59] that and put them in in in contact with
[34:02] the right kind of friends, the right
[34:04] kind of atmosphere. Bring them
[34:06] spiritually. Put the scripture. Maybe
[34:09] lay a Bible there. Buy them something
[34:11] for their birthday that they will you're
[34:14] doing everything. Make sure that they
[34:16] have a a tape or a message close by so
[34:19] they can feed on the word. Why? Because
[34:21] you know what will cultivate that. You
[34:24] know it's in them. You've claimed them.
[34:27] And what are you doing? You're laboring.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Is it a one-shot deal? No. No. You're
[34:32] laboring today. And you work tomorrow.
[34:35] And you work this year, next year, while
[34:38] they're in their childhood and up into
[34:40] their youth and into their teen years.
[34:42] Do you ever quit? You never quit. You're
[34:45] laboring to bring them forth into sons
[34:48] and daughters of God.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; That's what God does. This is the work
[34:54] of God.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; I just wanted you to see that part. God
[34:58] is working also.
[35:01] How that God has set some in the church
[35:04] through the labor pains.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] When a church is groaning under the
[35:11] persecution of the outside world,
[35:14] believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[35:16] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[35:19] real as it was to Pentecost. how they
[35:22] groan and cry under the labor pains.
[35:27] But when they are born and positionally
[35:29] born into the kingdom of God, then the
[35:32] Holy Ghost has set in the church some
[35:34] apostles and some prophets, some
[35:37] teachers and some evangelists,
[35:40] some pastors and some evangelists. Then
[35:43] he's given uh then he's give into there
[35:47] speaking with tongues and interpretation
[35:49] of tongues and knowledge and wisdom and
[35:51] gifts of healing and all kinds of
[35:55] miracles that God has set some in the
[35:58] church through his labor pains. So I
[36:00] want to extend the labor pains not just
[36:04] uh in him bringing us individually but
[36:07] then it's a as a labor of him when he
[36:11] gives into the church apostles and
[36:14] prophets and pastors and teachers and
[36:16] evangelists. That's all part of his
[36:18] work, bringing in those that because he
[36:22] has a desire for building up and
[36:25] nurturing his uh sons and daughters into
[36:28] a place that he's trying to position
[36:30] them into their right rightful place.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Believing on him whom he has sent
[36:41] initiates the process whereby the very
[36:45] life of Jesus Christ is transmitted into
[36:49] the individual. I want to say that
[36:51] again. I want you to memorize it if you
[36:54] need to. Believing on him
[36:58] whom he hath sent initiates
[37:03] the process
[37:06] the very whereby the very life of Jesus
[37:09] Christ is transmitted into the
[37:12] individual
[37:14] &gt;&gt; in natural life. You came here by a
[37:16] process. You came here by a process of
[37:19] of conception
[37:22] &gt;&gt; and uh through birth.
[37:25] And since you were born into this world,
[37:27] you have gone through a process of
[37:30] development
[37:32] uh of maturing. It's all a process. You
[37:36] have you that have uh entered into a
[37:38] marriage relationship, you surely know
[37:41] that's a process. And you didn't reach
[37:44] some point and say, "Wonderful, it's all
[37:47] over.
[37:48] We understand each other perfectly and
[37:51] we never have another question." No, you
[37:53] don't quite arrive there. Uh, you never
[37:57] arrive there.
[37:59] I'm discovering new things about my wife
[38:01] and we've been married almost 54 years.
[38:03] We just keep discovering. You say, "Is
[38:05] my is there that many uh, you know,
[38:08] things to learn?" Yeah. And probably
[38:10] we'll learn we learn a lot of things
[38:12] about you know our spiritual walk. We'll
[38:15] never learn it all down here. It's going
[38:17] to take eternity.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; And so that initiates the process. Our
[38:23] spiritual birth and our life is a
[38:26] process. The Bible says as newborn babes
[38:31] desire the sincere milk of the word
[38:33] doesn't end there. That you may grow
[38:37] thereby.
[38:39] It's a process. Desire the sincere milk
[38:42] of the word that you may grow thereby.
[38:46] Paul said in in his letter letters to
[38:48] the Colossians, "Let the word of Christ
[38:51] dwell in you richly in all wisdom,
[38:54] teaching and admonishing one another in
[38:57] psalms and hymns." This is what
[38:59] individuals do. You're encouraging one
[39:02] another. You're teaching and admonishing
[39:05] one another in psalms and in hymns and
[39:08] in spiritual songs, singing with grace
[39:11] in your heart to the Lord. Let the Lord
[39:13] dwell in you richly. That's all part of
[39:16] it. And further in in Colossians 1:27,
[39:20] to whom God would make known what is the
[39:22] riches of the glory of this mystery
[39:25] among the Gentiles, which is Christ in
[39:28] you. It's not just a, you know, just a
[39:32] flash in the pan, something that
[39:34] happens. Oh, Christ's in me. No, it's a
[39:36] process.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And the process is initiated.
[39:42] That's the beginning place
[39:46] by believing on him whom God hath sent.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; This gets very very serious.
[39:53] Anyone
[39:55] with an intelligence of reading can read
[39:58] the scripture,
[40:00] &gt;&gt; but if you don't believe on him whom God
[40:03] hath sent, there isn't even a starting
[40:06] spot.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Bringing the literal life of Jesus
[40:15] Christ into a person is a process.
[40:18] Talking about the literal life. Greater
[40:21] is he that is in you than he that is in
[40:24] the world.
[40:26] It's a process and it has to start by
[40:30] believing on him. This Jesus said this.
[40:35] You know what the word this means?
[40:37] There's nothing on this end of it and
[40:38] there's nothing on this end of it.
[40:40] There's nothing before it and there's
[40:42] nothing after it. this
[40:47] &gt;&gt; maybe you heard one time I've related
[40:50] this a number of times
[40:53] but early in our ministry and had a
[40:56] radio broadcast
[40:58] and uh uh
[41:01] someone was questioning on the serpent's
[41:03] seed and so
[41:06] uh I like where Genesis the 5th chapter
[41:09] said this is the generations of at him.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; So I walked in the door and I said to
[41:17] one of the secretaries, I said, "Would
[41:19] you please go and get me the most most
[41:23] exhaustive and most definitive
[41:27] uh meaning of the word this?" And she
[41:29] said, "This?" I said, "Yeah, just do
[41:33] it." So she disappeared. She left the
[41:36] office and I was out for a while. came
[41:39] back in and she was sitting at her desk
[41:42] and I said, "Well, what'd you find out?"
[41:44] She said, "You know what? There's pages
[41:46] on the word this." I said, "Well, I
[41:48] haven't got time for pages. Haven't got
[41:51] a lot of time. Just tell me what it" She
[41:53] said, "Do you want to just in brief?" I
[41:55] said, "Yeah, just tell me conc precisely
[41:57] what it is." Well, she said this.
[41:59] There's nothing here and there's nothing
[42:02] on this end. This is it.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said that's good. This is the
[42:08] generations of Adam.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And when you read chapter five there,
[42:15] you can't find Cain there. He's not part
[42:18] of the generations of Adam because this
[42:21] is the generations of Adam.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; I'm glad God means what he says
[42:29] &gt;&gt; and he says what he means.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; And that's the beginning place.
[42:45] Believing on him
[42:47] whom God has sent initiates the process
[42:52] whereby the very life of Jesus Christ is
[42:56] transmitted into the believer. I'm going
[43:00] perhaps laboriously but so you can take
[43:03] this and it's it's a much more effective
[43:05] when a person can read it and see it
[43:08] visually. You are of God little children
[43:12] and have overcome them because greater
[43:15] is he that is in you than he that is in
[43:20] the world. Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Now I want the the message also will
[43:24] encompass God's sovereign grace in
[43:29] choosing an individual
[43:33] especially those that are fulfilling I
[43:36] will say a major role in the plan of
[43:39] redemption. That's why when we read the
[43:41] scripture, you know, these aren't the
[43:43] only people God used, but these are the
[43:45] people God chose to be inserted in the
[43:49] cannon of scripture. And so that we have
[43:53] we have the principles laid down, how
[43:56] God chooses, how God speaks, how God
[43:59] broods, how he sends his Holy Spirit,
[44:02] how the people responded. And when we
[44:04] see it written in the scripture, we know
[44:06] that the unchanging God, that's the way
[44:08] he works. He may use a different
[44:11] scenario. He may use a different person.
[44:14] But God works the way he's worked in the
[44:17] Bible. God never changes his mind about
[44:20] how he does things.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; And he certainly never changed his mind
[44:23] about his work. So, especially those
[44:25] that are fulfilling a major role in the
[44:28] plan of redemption, then I want to have
[44:31] you think about the how he prepared the
[44:34] preparation of those individuals, the
[44:37] elected ones. And many times in uh in
[44:42] our lives and as we read in the
[44:44] scripture
[44:46] how God what he used to prepare his
[44:51] people, we never grasp it with human
[44:54] reasoning
[44:55] just never will.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; God uses a he works in strange and
[45:00] mysterious ways. But if we just will rem
[45:04] remain in one place and that is entirely
[45:08] open entirely surrendered when I say
[45:11] open I don't mean gullible
[45:14] &gt;&gt; but entirely open completely believing
[45:19] &gt;&gt; sincere not only sincere because
[45:21] sincerity won't do it but believing
[45:24] people say well I believe the Bible says
[45:27] believing on him whom God hath sent.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; I can assure you, unless people believed
[45:36] in Moses, they certainly weren't going
[45:39] to get out of Egypt.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; He was the one who had been sent at that
[45:44] time. And the prophet of God in this
[45:46] generation had been sent. Every me every
[45:49] messenger has been sent. And I believe
[45:51] that that that's that's critical.
[45:55] And then those people, there's the
[45:58] preparation of these men.
[46:00] Then there is the empowerment,
[46:04] we can say vindication
[46:06] and the message that God sent through
[46:09] them. We're just speaking yesterday. We
[46:12] had some guests at the house
[46:14] and and I I I want to be very
[46:19] uh
[46:20] precise this morning as just as precise
[46:23] as I can be. But brother Brandham says
[46:28] regarding and because at that time that
[46:30] he even spoke it, there was a a
[46:33] proliferation
[46:35] of all kinds of supernatural and
[46:37] miraculous things and people have it
[46:39] today. Oh, we're not talking just about
[46:42] healing. All kinds of healings and
[46:44] different things that take place. We're
[46:46] not talking about that. But he said
[46:48] this, if the sign if the sign doesn't
[46:52] have a voice that comes behind it,
[46:54] That's right.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "You just forget it."
[46:57] &gt;&gt; So what what he's really saying is that
[46:59] there will be signs. There will be
[47:01] spectacular things. There will be things
[47:04] that would, you know, catch your
[47:06] attention. Said, don't pay any attention
[47:08] to it if there's not a voice coming
[47:11] behind it. If there isn't a message that
[47:13] comes behind it. And so I'm glad that we
[47:17] can say today that we have both of those
[47:20] that have united together. We had the
[47:23] supernatural and the phenomena and the
[47:27] voice that came behind it.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there are those that
[47:32] believe on him that God hath sent.
[47:40] They've followed this progression of
[47:42] events. They've identified
[47:44] perhaps perhaps we're attracted by the
[47:47] phenomena or the spectacular or
[47:50] supernatural. Even today, I'm I'm very
[47:53] very
[47:55] careful when I see people being
[47:58] attracted to what we might say, well,
[48:00] attracted to the message or attracted to
[48:02] the congregation or attracted I want to
[48:04] find out right away who or what they're
[48:07] attracted to.
[48:10] say, "Oh, I see people where I've walked
[48:13] into this church with a lot of people
[48:15] walk in says, "Oh,"
[48:18] you know, they go up in the video room
[48:19] and see all the technology and says,
[48:22] "Oh, you you guys are, hey, you're
[48:26] connected. You're set up and all this."
[48:30] I don't let that phase me one bit.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; If you get a compliment, say, "Well,
[48:35] it's fine. Thank you."
[48:37] And then they maybe want to know
[48:38] something. What do you believe? And so
[48:40] forth. I'm very very cautious because I
[48:43] don't want to be asked what we believe
[48:45] because someone got impressed with the
[48:47] technology.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; I don't get into a big big a big subject
[48:54] about what we believe because someone
[48:56] someone says, you know, they got their
[48:57] belief and and maybe they look around
[49:00] say, "Hey, I wish we had young people
[49:02] like that."
[49:04] What do you believe? Well, I tread very
[49:07] carefully. I want to find out why do you
[49:09] want to know what I believe?
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Some handsome young fellas walk in here
[49:17] and look around. See these lovely young
[49:18] ladies and girls say, "H, what do you
[49:20] folks believe?" Said, "Never mind what
[49:22] we believe. Go hunting someplace else
[49:31] &gt;&gt; or vice versa.
[49:38] The Bible says, "Buried with him." Now,
[49:42] I'm I'm just putting throwing a lot out
[49:44] here, but I hope hope by God's grace to
[49:46] be able to pull it together in just a
[49:47] little bit. Buried with him in baptism,
[49:52] wherein also ye are risen with him
[49:55] through the faith of the operation of
[49:59] God, who hath raised him from the dead.
[50:02] And I want to focus for a moment on the
[50:04] operation of God. There's something that
[50:07] is God's doing.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; The operation of God. So this is
[50:13] something that this person has done.
[50:16] They conceived this. They laid it all
[50:19] out. They drew up the plans. This is
[50:22] their doing. Well, now I'm talking about
[50:24] something that's God's doing.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; This is God's operation. This is the
[50:30] operation of God and it starts by him
[50:33] choosing
[50:36] &gt;&gt; who he chooses.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That's that's one of the first
[50:40] fundamentals. God chooses whom he will
[50:44] choose. In other words, he exercises his
[50:46] own free will.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; And as I said Wednesday, that is where
[50:51] the world becomes irritated. It become
[50:54] they become uncomfortable. Even perhaps
[50:57] as I'm speaking this, there may be a lot
[50:59] of people that they don't like that. So
[51:01] what about my choice? My right to
[51:03] receive Christ or my right to accept
[51:06] God. You could you only have that right
[51:08] if he chose first that you could do
[51:11] that.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; And that's a tough one for a lot of
[51:14] people. That happens to be the truth.
[51:16] And I've said to people uh often when
[51:19] they said well this business of
[51:21] predestination and so on and so forth
[51:23] and that God chooses and they don't want
[51:26] God to have the freedom to choose who
[51:28] will be his wife his bride
[51:31] &gt;&gt; but they want to have the right to
[51:32] choose who theirs is.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Say you you want the right to choose
[51:37] your husband or your wife. You want that
[51:39] right and you don't allow God to have
[51:42] that right. Of course God has that
[51:44] right. He chooses whom. This is the
[51:47] operation of God. In other words, God is
[51:49] saying, "I'm going to become the
[51:50] operative here.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to become the operative. I'm
[51:54] going to choose who I'm going to use.
[51:56] I'm going to choose what capacity
[51:58] they're used in. I'm going to gift them
[52:01] and talent them with whatever they have
[52:03] or whatever they don't have. And if they
[52:05] don't have it, that's the way I want it.
[52:07] I'm operating this thing.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; I'm operating this whole redemption
[52:12] plan.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And it may be mysterious. So be it. And
[52:16] men can't understand it. They can't they
[52:19] can't figure it out by reading. And I'm
[52:21] going to just hide it and veil it in
[52:24] such in such mystery that it can only
[52:27] come ah let's see the operative is
[52:30] working. Uh how will it come? Oh, I'm
[52:33] going to send my Holy Spirit and I'm
[52:35] going to reveal it. But I'm going to put
[52:38] something within the individual, my
[52:40] elect. I've chosen to put something in
[52:43] them that will respond to my spirit. And
[52:47] they are predestinated to have that
[52:50] seed. And then one day along the way,
[52:54] I'm the operator. I'm the operative
[52:56] here. I'm going to bring them to a
[52:59] certain place in contact with a certain
[53:01] person to put a certain book or to have
[53:04] a certain voice that they will hear. and
[53:06] that and immediately that thing that's
[53:09] in them is going to spark to life.
[53:11] They're going to say, "This is for me."
[53:15] &gt;&gt; See,
[53:16] &gt;&gt; those elected ones, they didn't have to
[53:19] be impressed.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to be impressed with a
[53:23] nice church or good people or anything
[53:25] else. They didn't have to be impressed.
[53:27] They heard the voice of the shepherd and
[53:30] the spark and the Holy Spirit struck
[53:34] light to the seed
[53:36] &gt;&gt; and that was it.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That's God's choosing.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Don't ever forget that.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; We're coming down to little swimming
[53:47] water here in a few minutes. Amen.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; And they're believing
[53:53] believing on him that God has sent. The
[53:56] the God is the operator, the operation
[53:59] of God. So he sends whom he sends.
[54:03] And the scripture says, "And his word
[54:06] comes to the prophet.
[54:08] His word come to the prophet." He chose
[54:11] that a prophet would be the carrier of
[54:13] his word.
[54:16] He chose even in his labor pains. He
[54:19] brought forth in New Testament apostles
[54:22] and prophets and teachers and
[54:24] evangelists and pastors and and they
[54:27] were his gifts. Now I don't want you to
[54:30] separate for a moment. Don't separate
[54:34] the ministry from the person. They are
[54:37] one and the same.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; You can't separate the message from the
[54:41] messenger.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; They're one and the same.
[54:45] So the gift is actually the person.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Him
[55:00] whom God hath sent. The gift
[55:03] whom God hath sent.
[55:10] God sent has sent some marvelous
[55:12] marvelous gifts to the world
[55:15] and he didn't wrap them up fancy.
[55:19] He didn't put nice ribbons and bows on
[55:21] them. Maybe just sent them ordinary
[55:24] workers, ordinary men and women, maybe
[55:28] with not a great education,
[55:30] disciples of Jesus Christ that couldn't
[55:32] sign their own name. They weren't
[55:34] wrapped up the way the world would like
[55:37] to have had him. Jesus was not presented
[55:40] the way the world would expect the
[55:42] Messiah to be presented.
[55:46] And then this generation, this gentile
[55:49] age, expecting Christ. Oh, if exactly a
[55:53] duplicate of what the Jews the Jews
[55:55] expected some carpet to come out of the
[55:57] sky, some rolling down and he's going to
[56:00] come and and the Messiah is going to
[56:02] come to the temple and walk and address
[56:04] the high priest in all of his robes and
[56:07] this is going to be a a spectacular
[56:10] event
[56:13] and said he was
[56:21] over some
[56:22] straw.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And God was presenting
[56:28] greatest gift this world's ever seen.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; A lamb born in the stable.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:36] a man who was associated with the
[56:39] Galileans,
[56:41] who spoke a very flat and guttal
[56:45] language,
[56:47] not some beautiful
[56:50] melodic language,
[56:53] was kind of just short flat.
[57:02] associated him with that with the poor.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he was associated with.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; And that was not a a popular thing. Are
[57:12] you listening to me?
[57:16] &gt;&gt; But salvation came
[57:19] in the person of Jesus Christ. And I
[57:22] have called this message today the same
[57:24] as part two of him whom God hath sent.
[57:28] But the subject also this morning which
[57:31] I'm moving towards slowly the subject
[57:35] the person
[57:37] revealing the son of man.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that.
[57:45] Luke 17:30
[57:48] in the day when the son of man will be
[57:51] revealed. And I'm not changing the
[57:53] scripture, but for the purpose of the
[57:55] service this morning, I want you to be
[57:58] thinking the person
[58:01] in whom the son of man will be revealed.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; And you aren't going to get it any other
[58:12] way than the way God ordained it to be.
[58:16] You won't get it through any other
[58:18] channel than the one God ordained it to
[58:21] come through. It just won't happen. You
[58:24] can twist and turn and the world could
[58:27] agonize and have all kinds of nasty
[58:29] things. They had nasty things to say
[58:31] about Moses, the men of renown, the men
[58:34] that were gifted, the talented men. They
[58:36] had all kinds of things and raised up
[58:38] against Moses. They raised up against
[58:40] Samuel and rejected him and said, "Give
[58:42] us a king." And he told them all that
[58:44] would happen. He's going to tax you and
[58:46] he's going to take your young men. He's
[58:48] going to take them to war. They're going
[58:49] to fight. They're going to be killed.
[58:51] He's going to take your young women. No,
[58:52] we don't care anyway. We just want And
[58:54] he was rejected.
[58:58] And he mourned over it. Not that he was
[59:00] rejected. He mourned over what was going
[59:03] to happen. And God told him, you know,
[59:06] don't mourn anymore. They haven't
[59:07] rejected you. They rejected me. Who?
[59:11] &gt;&gt; They didn't reject you. They rejected
[59:13] me.
[59:15] They rejected God.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Lost. They lost the concept
[59:22] &gt;&gt; that God was in this man.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; God was speaking to.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the creator of heavens
[59:29] and earth embodying himself in such a
[59:32] way so that you say, "Well, no, God was
[59:35] in Christ. God was also in Samuel.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; God was in Moses.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; That's why his face shone because his
[59:42] word was in Moses.
[59:51] in the person
[59:53] of God's chosen men or God's chosen
[59:56] people
[59:58] and I refer to Moses now and the Bible
[1:00:00] says this Moses whom they refused
[1:00:05] saying who made thee a ruler and a judge
[1:00:09] the same did God send to be a ruler
[1:00:13] ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the
[1:00:18] angel which appeared to him in the bush.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Put yourselves all down in Egypt. Put
[1:00:26] yourselves all down in the in the mud
[1:00:29] pits of Egypt. Put yourselves all down
[1:00:32] under the under the whip of the cruel uh
[1:00:35] task masters. Put yourself there in your
[1:00:37] imagination. Put yourself there. And now
[1:00:40] here comes a man out of the wilderness.
[1:00:43] a shepherd for the last 40 years had
[1:00:46] murdered a man and all the rest of it.
[1:00:48] But God spoke to him and he came with
[1:00:50] vindication
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; who I say sent me. Tell him I am has
[1:00:56] sent you
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; and it became evident soon that God was
[1:01:01] with him. and you're down in the mud
[1:01:03] pits and your children and your families
[1:01:06] and whatever more and your your young
[1:01:08] people, your mothers and your fathers
[1:01:10] and you see them under steaming, under
[1:01:12] that heat and under that cruelty and no
[1:01:15] doubt would look up and say, "Oh God,
[1:01:17] where's the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:01:19] Jacob?
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; He's coming
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; in a man,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; and there isn't another man. They're
[1:01:28] coming in this man." And deliverance of
[1:01:32] the people came in the person of Moses,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; not some other good people, not some
[1:01:41] other educated people. It came in the
[1:01:43] person. It says you got to get it and
[1:01:46] get it good. It came in God's choosing.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; That's who God chose.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; And if the people then say, "What can I
[1:01:55] do, Lord? What can I do? An hour has
[1:01:58] come. I see these great miracles. If if
[1:02:00] anybody had asked that, God would have
[1:02:03] said to them, "My work, I'm laboring now
[1:02:07] to get you to believe on him whom I have
[1:02:11] sent."
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's my biggest chore right now.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He would say, is to get the people to
[1:02:18] believe on him,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; whom God has sent.
[1:02:23] The Apostle Paul, I think of him now.
[1:02:26] I'm jumping around. The Apostle Paul,
[1:02:30] the person
[1:02:32] turning law to grace.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "If anyone else come
[1:02:40] and preach another gospel
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; than I have preached,
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; let him be accursed."
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; What kind of man is this? What kind of
[1:02:48] statement is that? Who does he put
[1:02:50] himself to be? He knew who he was. He
[1:02:53] knew that God had called him. God chose
[1:02:55] him. God elected him and God empowered
[1:02:59] him. God gave him the words and he knew
[1:03:01] he was writing those letters not from
[1:03:03] his education under Galia but by the
[1:03:06] revelation of Jesus Christ and he wrote
[1:03:09] those letters.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; And I can say the whole doctrine of
[1:03:13] turning law from from law to grace was
[1:03:17] in the person of Apostle Paul by the
[1:03:20] choosing of God.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; You might say are you elevating these
[1:03:24] people? I'm elevating them to the degree
[1:03:26] that God chose them
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; and that God elevated them to. And God
[1:03:31] elevated him to a position that only one
[1:03:33] in that generation
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; wasn't another one. It wasn't a whole
[1:03:38] group.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; One man
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; the person
[1:03:48] Luther
[1:03:50] and now I just quote and just stay with
[1:03:52] me real close please. In modern events,
[1:03:55] one of the last messages
[1:03:58] brother Brandham spoke, he said talking
[1:04:00] about the church and how it had to die
[1:04:02] in the dark ages and then come back up.
[1:04:06] And he says it came forth in the person
[1:04:10] of Martin Luther, the reformation. And I
[1:04:14] found this a very astounding statement
[1:04:18] which actually has given rise to the
[1:04:21] last two services, the last Wednesday
[1:04:23] and this service.
[1:04:27] So if you want to know how God deals
[1:04:29] with me, here it is here that the
[1:04:32] church, he refers to it, the New
[1:04:35] Testament church, it had to die
[1:04:38] and it had to come forth so it could
[1:04:40] come forth in the reformation again.
[1:04:44] Then he stops. It came forth.
[1:04:48] Now he's talking about the reformation.
[1:04:50] It the reformation came forth
[1:04:54] in the person
[1:04:57] of the reformation
[1:04:59] Martin Luther.
[1:05:03] We are here today. We can say that
[1:05:05] justification
[1:05:07] by faith came forth out of the dark ages
[1:05:12] in the person
[1:05:15] of Martin Luther.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:20] See, it wasn't it wasn't the selection.
[1:05:23] They didn't have the cardinals and the
[1:05:24] pope making a selection. They didn't
[1:05:26] have they didn't even have the people
[1:05:29] say, "Well, you know, the people can
[1:05:31] vote and select on who it's going to
[1:05:32] be." I say, "Forget the people for a
[1:05:35] moment. It had to be God's choice."
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; God chose that man.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; God endued him. God empowered him. God
[1:05:43] gave him a certain kind of a nature. He
[1:05:45] wasn't the kind of a person who was weak
[1:05:47] in his knees. He wasn't the kind of
[1:05:49] person who cowered.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He was a kind of person who was
[1:05:53] absolutely sold and and convinced of his
[1:05:56] conviction in God. And I wish there were
[1:05:58] more people like that.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God, let us be men and women of
[1:06:03] conviction.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Not opinionated,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; conviction
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; of what God said,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; believing on him whom God has sent.
[1:06:19] And then he talks about just coming from
[1:06:21] a stock. And then he goes on in
[1:06:24] leadership, the last message ever
[1:06:26] preached as a message. This is not
[1:06:29] Luther's age. This is not Pentecostal
[1:06:33] age.
[1:06:34] This is the bride age.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; People in the message have trouble with
[1:06:39] that.
[1:06:41] I wish they would hear this service
[1:06:45] and simply catch these words. This is
[1:06:48] the work of God. Believe on him whom God
[1:06:52] has sent.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what he said. It's not
[1:06:56] Luther's age. And we can say amen. It's
[1:07:00] not a Pentecostal age seeing where
[1:07:02] Pentecost has gone. I have nothing to do
[1:07:04] with that.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; This is the bride age.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; This is the bride age.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And God sent to you a gift.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the gift that the people who
[1:07:20] sat around thought it was, "Oh, he's got
[1:07:22] the gift of the word of wisdom." Such
[1:07:24] nonsense.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's got the gift of healing. Not
[1:07:28] that at all. It was the sign of God's
[1:07:32] choosing.
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to you today? Say to
[1:07:41] hear the words.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; That's not that's my voice, but that's
[1:07:45] not me speaking.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; And you can say who's speaking,
[1:07:50] thus saith the Lord.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you mean you have a vessel?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Say, wow. Everybody can say that. Go
[1:07:59] ahead and say it
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; and say something prophetic and see what
[1:08:03] happens.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; I like what brother Gunther said. Oh, he
[1:08:06] said, "You don't believe the seals are
[1:08:07] open. You don't want to believe that."
[1:08:08] He said, "You know, why don't you go off
[1:08:11] and why don't you go off into Arizona?
[1:08:14] Why don't you go stand in the desert and
[1:08:16] see what happens?"
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hot sun.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You go stand there. But I know one that
[1:08:27] was chosen to go stand there and seven
[1:08:29] angels come,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, and thunder out of the sky
[1:08:32] and a cloud with the head of Jesus
[1:08:35] Christ. You go and do it
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; and see what happens.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; God's choosing.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Now I turn it around. Say, what does
[1:08:47] that mean to us? Oh, how I thank you
[1:08:51] Lord Jesus that this is in your
[1:08:53] revealing that you chose a man in whom
[1:08:57] the revealing could take place and
[1:08:59] remain humble.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Remain in utter humility.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Remain kind
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; and yet unairring with the word,
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; uncompromising with the word. So the
[1:09:13] word could come down to us
[1:09:14] unadulterated.
[1:09:18] You think I don't have something to
[1:09:19] preach about? We have something to
[1:09:20] preach about, friends.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And you need to be really thankful. I
[1:09:25] want to try to generate within your
[1:09:26] heart a thanksgiving
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; to the message that came and the
[1:09:31] messenger that came that God sent. The
[1:09:33] thanksgiving goes to God.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You didn't send yourself. William
[1:09:38] Brandham didn't send himself. Luther
[1:09:40] didn't send himself. These men were sent
[1:09:42] of God.
[1:09:44] And as I said Wednesday, to try to
[1:09:46] circumvent the one that God sent is to
[1:09:50] say to God, uh, you made the wrong
[1:09:53] choice.
[1:09:55] You chose the wrong person.
[1:09:57] You didn't really endure him
[1:09:59] sufficiently.
[1:10:01] At least he didn't convince me.
[1:10:04] You're circumventing God's chosen one.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And they circumvented Moses. They
[1:10:10] circumvented Elijah. They circumvented
[1:10:13] Daniel. They circumvented David. They
[1:10:16] circumvented Apostle Paul.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; They went around them,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; but they're not in the record,
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; they vanished off the scene.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; But then those that believed on him who
[1:10:33] God has sent.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what's happening? Let
[1:10:36] me speak to you directly. Do you
[1:10:38] understand what's happening? You are
[1:10:40] reversing the whole process by believing
[1:10:44] him whom God hath sent who has the words
[1:10:47] of God in his mouth. By believing on
[1:10:49] him, you are reversing what your great
[1:10:52] four mama did. Eve.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; She refused what God had sent.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; She refused and denied the word and
[1:11:03] listened to reasoning. But now there's a
[1:11:05] people on the earth that are believing
[1:11:08] the message that has come and literally
[1:11:11] reversing the process.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; We're here today
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; reversing the process.
[1:11:21] God has empowered us to reverse the
[1:11:23] process that started in Eden.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; And by her decision, death came. And by
[1:11:30] our decision, by God's choosing, life
[1:11:33] has come.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now to refuse that person
[1:11:45] that's doing the calling, Christ,"
[1:11:49] see how he puts it. Now to refuse that
[1:11:51] person who's doing the calling Christ,
[1:11:55] no matter if you're Pentecostal,
[1:11:57] Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you
[1:12:00] go to, he said, this age, nothing
[1:12:02] against them. Not at all. Isn't that
[1:12:05] kind?
[1:12:08] But in this age now, you've got to
[1:12:10] accept like they did in that age, the
[1:12:13] person of Christ, which is the word.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; And the word comes to
[1:12:20] The word comes to
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Christ comes to
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; who did Christ come to when the word
[1:12:27] when when the prophet and former John
[1:12:30] the Baptist standing in the water and
[1:12:32] Jesus John didn't go and find Christ.
[1:12:35] Christ the word came to him.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's the pattern.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's the principle and that's always
[1:12:43] the principle. Moses and Moses didn't go
[1:12:46] hunting for the bush. The bush attracted
[1:12:49] him. God came to him. God came to
[1:12:52] Elijah. God came to Elisha. And even
[1:12:56] before, he said to Jeremiah, "Before you
[1:12:58] were born,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; before you were conceived in your
[1:13:02] mother's womb, I chose you."
[1:13:09] I'm looking down this congregation right
[1:13:11] now
[1:13:13] and I can say to you
[1:13:16] as a people of individuals, I want you
[1:13:18] to think about your own life,
[1:13:22] before your father came to your mother,
[1:13:25] and before that sperm was even lodged in
[1:13:28] her womb,
[1:13:30] God chose exactly which germ
[1:13:34] would be conceived
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and bring you into this life
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; because God had a plan.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; God had a choice.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And you're not sitting here by your
[1:13:44] choice.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here by God Almighty's
[1:13:47] choice.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; His choice. He knew every footstep.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I see you come from many, many different
[1:13:56] places and even different countries and
[1:13:58] you sat and maybe wrestled with it and
[1:14:00] said, "Oh my, what am I going to do? how
[1:14:03] what God I don't know why God attracts
[1:14:06] and brings a certain people together in
[1:14:08] a certain way, but it's it's in God's
[1:14:10] choosing.
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's God's doing.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You people here from so many many
[1:14:18] different countries and see you, Sister
[1:14:20] Lesanne, God knew exactly what was going
[1:14:24] to happen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You that here from the Congo, God knew.
[1:14:28] and from China. Think of Murphy. Brother
[1:14:31] Murphy that's up there right now behind
[1:14:32] the window. A nerve center for China
[1:14:35] translating what I'm saying right now.
[1:14:38] And he and he, for those of you that
[1:14:40] don't know, he sang in a certain choir.
[1:14:42] And the choir, the government church,
[1:14:44] Three Self Church there in China, which
[1:14:46] doesn't really have any any any belief
[1:14:48] of any kind, but he sang in the choir.
[1:14:50] And there was a a brother that was a
[1:14:52] leading that choir. And then they didn't
[1:14:54] see each other for years.
[1:14:58] And by a series of supernatural events,
[1:15:02] Brother Murphy got
[1:15:04] he got his visa to come to Canada to
[1:15:07] immigrate to Canada.
[1:15:10] And he thought he would go and see his
[1:15:12] old choir leader as he's leaving.
[1:15:16] And as they're speaking together, he
[1:15:18] finds out the choir leader doesn't
[1:15:20] believe because he didn't really have
[1:15:22] any belief, but he's got a whole new a
[1:15:24] whole new belief now. starts speaking to
[1:15:27] him about baptism in the name of the
[1:15:29] Lord Jesus Christ. Brother Murphy wants
[1:15:31] to know where well my you know he could
[1:15:34] say it where can I be baptized because
[1:15:36] I'm leaving. He and his young wife we're
[1:15:38] leaving. He said well they were on their
[1:15:41] way to Toronto to set up a business. Had
[1:15:43] the plan all in place. Had the money in
[1:15:46] place. Had everything in place on their
[1:15:48] way to Toronto to set up a business. He
[1:15:51] said his his old friend said, "Well,
[1:15:54] stop in Vancouver. your plane will stop
[1:15:56] in Vancouver and and there's a a man
[1:15:59] there that we know there's a church
[1:16:00] there and they will baptize you in the
[1:16:02] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; He stopped here went into that tank and
[1:16:08] went up to that office.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Been here ever since.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] What does that accident?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's by God's choosing.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; God chose.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; I want you to see God chose. Actually,
[1:16:23] in the mind of God, he knew before the
[1:16:25] foundation of the world, you're going to
[1:16:26] be sitting right where you're sitting
[1:16:28] today. He knew exactly what I was going
[1:16:30] to be saying. He knew exactly what was
[1:16:32] going to be going on in your heart cuz
[1:16:33] he chose it to happen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; He ordained it to happen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I could do a dance.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; I'm so enthused and enthralled with my
[1:16:45] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said you must accept the
[1:16:54] person. To refuse the person is to
[1:16:57] refuse Christ.
[1:16:59] And then he ends up that paragraph in
[1:17:01] leadership. You must accept the person
[1:17:04] of eternal life. The message, he that is
[1:17:06] in you. I I'm going to just close it a
[1:17:09] little bit, but I have to I have to make
[1:17:11] a wee bit of distance. Help me out.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; He said, if if we could only receive
[1:17:15] this truth,
[1:17:19] all your attention, please.
[1:17:22] If we could only receive this truth,
[1:17:26] if we could only realize what this
[1:17:29] scripture means,
[1:17:31] he that is in you
[1:17:35] is greater than he that is in the world.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; He said, we can't understand that. Yet
[1:17:43] we say we believe it,
[1:17:47] and you is greater than he that's in the
[1:17:50] world. And we know that it's true,
[1:17:54] but we really don't understand it.
[1:17:56] Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:17:59] that is in the world. What is in you?
[1:18:05] This isn't a little sermon. Now, this is
[1:18:08] prophet's words to you quoting out of
[1:18:11] the scripture.
[1:18:13] What is in you?
[1:18:15] He said, he asked the question, what is
[1:18:17] in you that's greater?
[1:18:19] It's Christ.
[1:18:22] It's the anointed.
[1:18:24] God that was in Christ is in you.
[1:18:28] Greater is he that is in you than he
[1:18:30] that is in the world. Then, and here I
[1:18:33] have it highlighted, so it must be
[1:18:34] highlighted for you. Then if he is in
[1:18:38] you, it's not you anymore living.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; It's him living in you. Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; It's not your thinking
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; and what you would think about this.
[1:18:56] It's what he said about it.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Then if he's in you,
[1:19:02] he absolutely would not deny what he
[1:19:05] said.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; If he's in you, he would not deny what
[1:19:09] he said. Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And he's trying to find that person
[1:19:21] now.
[1:19:23] I'm trying to bring something to you.
[1:19:27] And when I sit in my study and naturally
[1:19:29] have many more hours than perhaps you do
[1:19:33] to hear and to absorb and to ponder the
[1:19:36] message,
[1:19:38] it's just like it is in the scripture. A
[1:19:40] prophet will take uh he'll take a
[1:19:43] scripture and he'll begin to expound and
[1:19:47] ext expand on it like he's doing right
[1:19:50] here. And then he just inserts a line
[1:19:54] and that line has reference to what he
[1:19:58] was saying but he extends the reference
[1:20:02] and in this and in many cases it becomes
[1:20:05] singular from the plural to the singular
[1:20:09] from the whole congregation to the one
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; and I'll just read it now for you.
[1:20:18] Then if he's in you, he would absolutely
[1:20:22] absolutely would not deny what he said.
[1:20:24] He couldn't do it. But he would keep
[1:20:27] what he said. He would he would keep
[1:20:30] what he has said. And he's trying to
[1:20:33] find that person
[1:20:37] that he can vindicate himself through.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now friends,
[1:20:44] he was saying that because the believers
[1:20:47] who believed the message knew that he
[1:20:50] was that person that God was
[1:20:53] vindicating.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody here, there isn't
[1:20:59] any minister I know, there isn't any
[1:21:02] other minister I've ever heard that
[1:21:04] stood at a pullpit, not once, but over
[1:21:07] and over and over again, said it to the
[1:21:10] world. Now, if he doesn't come
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; and prove what I've said as being the
[1:21:19] truth, then I am a false prophet.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Just a just plain I don't have that
[1:21:26] courage.
[1:21:28] My my highest
[1:21:31] calling would be to repeat and to echo
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; what he whom God hath sent has said.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And your greatest honor is to be able to
[1:21:46] believe
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; on him whom God sent. I don't care what
[1:21:51] kind of a problem you have.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of a at what
[1:21:56] station you are in life. This message
[1:21:58] has the answer for it.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Absolutely has the answer for it.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I was just relating last night and I'm
[1:22:08] sure
[1:22:10] It will be all right.
[1:22:12] I never forget the day Sister Janet
[1:22:15] Maloney came and stood right here
[1:22:22] and the police force who her husband was
[1:22:24] a part of the RCMP
[1:22:28] were going to be engaged
[1:22:31] in the next few hours in a 12week
[1:22:35] standoff
[1:22:37] with the native population at Gustoson
[1:22:40] Lake. And you can read about it.
[1:22:44] And it was a completely secretive
[1:22:47] affair.
[1:22:49] And the thing became so delicate they
[1:22:52] even called in military vehicles to go
[1:22:56] in essentially on the to to
[1:23:00] conquer this situation.
[1:23:04] And she sat she stood right here.
[1:23:08] and and I repeated it last night in
[1:23:12] testimony and I'm repeating it to you
[1:23:14] and Sister Janet, I saw a woman of
[1:23:17] faith.
[1:23:18] I saw as it was a woman out of the Old
[1:23:21] Testament or the scriptures and you
[1:23:24] looked straight ahead and said, "Brother
[1:23:27] Ed, they're going in tomorrow morning."
[1:23:31] And I'm standing here to pray and want
[1:23:35] you to pray that none of those men will
[1:23:39] be killed and none will be wounded.
[1:23:44] And I didn't know how many men, but
[1:23:47] that's what she said. And she said,
[1:23:48] "Those policemen have wives
[1:23:52] and have children." And I said,
[1:23:54] "According to your faith, they both sit
[1:23:57] here."
[1:23:59] Brother, brother Shawn, Sister Janet,
[1:24:03] and we prayed, had a simple prayer. It
[1:24:06] wasn't me. It wasn't the prayer. It was
[1:24:07] her faith.
[1:24:10] And that was 12 weeks from that time. 12
[1:24:14] weeks.
[1:24:16] I think it would be all right, Brother
[1:24:17] Sean, because it's become public
[1:24:18] knowledge.
[1:24:20] They counted over 6,000
[1:24:24] rounds of ammunition that had been fired
[1:24:27] at the place. 6,000
[1:24:30] rounds by marksmen
[1:24:32] with very good weapons
[1:24:38] over a period of 12 weeks.
[1:24:43] I'm here to tell you, you read in the
[1:24:44] Bible, you read in the book of Acts, I'm
[1:24:46] going to tell you this is the book of
[1:24:48] Acts.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Not one police was wounded
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and not one policeman was killed.
[1:24:56] and they can say all they wish to say
[1:24:58] about the newspapers and everything
[1:25:00] else. I'll tell you about what's written
[1:25:02] in heaven.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; There was a woman who heard him whom God
[1:25:08] hath sent
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; and her faith was anchored in that God
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; and spoke the confession of her mouth.
[1:25:20] And I would like anybody here or anybody
[1:25:22] in Canada to explain to me how 6,000
[1:25:26] rounds, more than 6,000 rounds of
[1:25:29] ammunition are fired with men with
[1:25:32] accurate weapons and men who make their
[1:25:34] living hunting.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And not one
[1:25:42] is wounded or slain.
[1:25:45] I say God and you people ought to be
[1:25:49] privileged. You're the only people that
[1:25:51] can fully understand that.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; We live in it. We're living in a
[1:26:00] miracle.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; We're seeing it all the time.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; This message has the answer
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; to this generation for your families,
[1:26:09] for your children. Greater is he that's
[1:26:11] in you than he that's binding the son or
[1:26:13] the daughter or the husband or the wife.
[1:26:16] Greater is he that's in you.
[1:26:28] slip ahead because there's something I
[1:26:29] want to come to.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Do I have your attention?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; In this mind of God
[1:26:49] at an appointed time, he said,
[1:26:53] "Let us make man.
[1:27:00] And we'd have to go in the scripture
[1:27:02] which we don't have the time to what was
[1:27:04] in his mind when he said let's make him.
[1:27:09] And then last Wednesday
[1:27:11] just brought out how God made Adam. It
[1:27:15] was Adam
[1:27:17] and then God chose Noah.
[1:27:21] God chose Abram who became Abraham.
[1:27:26] and out from his seed. It's not the
[1:27:28] children after the flesh, but the
[1:27:29] children of promise because he had
[1:27:31] Ishmael and others as well. But out came
[1:27:34] the son of promise, Isaac, and it was to
[1:27:36] be Abraham and Isaac. And God chose
[1:27:40] Jacob, Esau. Jacob I loved, Esau I
[1:27:43] hated. Don't try to wrestle with it.
[1:27:45] That's what that's what God's messenger
[1:27:47] said.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; That's what the Apostle Paul said. Don't
[1:27:51] wrestle with it.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; That's God's free will.
[1:27:55] God chose.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Don't think for a second it's unfair.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; God chose that.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to it?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; That's God's choosing. So he chose
[1:28:07] Abraham. He chose Isaac. He chose Jacob.
[1:28:10] He chose Joseph to fulfill their role in
[1:28:13] life.
[1:28:16] He chose these individuals. It was his
[1:28:19] choosing.
[1:28:24] And then
[1:28:25] out from them comes a people. And of all
[1:28:28] the peoples and tribes and nations and
[1:28:30] so on, God chose Israel.
[1:28:34] You know, Israel's had so much trouble.
[1:28:38] And the elect of God are not are not
[1:28:41] guaranteed that you're not going to have
[1:28:42] trouble. You know, we had a Jewish lady
[1:28:44] say to us, an Orthodox Jewish lady from
[1:28:47] Israel. You know, she said to us, "How
[1:28:49] can we become unchosen?"
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; In other words, how can we get rid of
[1:28:58] all this trouble?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; How can we get rid of being hated? How
[1:29:01] can we get rid of all of this animosity
[1:29:04] in the world? How can we become
[1:29:05] unchosen?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Well, quite frankly, there's no way to
[1:29:09] become unchosen. And I thank God,
[1:29:11] whatever comes, let it come. We don't
[1:29:13] want to be unchosen. We want to be the
[1:29:15] chosen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And then God began to build with out of
[1:29:22] the foundation. I just go quickly
[1:29:24] because I've got to I got to have about
[1:29:26] five minutes to conclude this now. And
[1:29:28] and and I described out of the
[1:29:31] foundations of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
[1:29:33] and Joseph, he began to build
[1:29:37] men. And because it was the word that
[1:29:39] was going to come in its fullness, these
[1:29:42] men had to be part of the word. And so a
[1:29:45] prophet actually had like a dual
[1:29:47] purpose, had like a dual ministry. He
[1:29:51] would prophesy to the people that were
[1:29:52] there. And yet he lived out part of the
[1:29:55] word and also prophesied about that
[1:29:58] which was yet to come because his life
[1:30:00] reflected the greater meaning in Christ.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me that far?
[1:30:05] So he had a dual purpose. And so but
[1:30:08] when they lived it, and here's what I
[1:30:09] want you to see now. When they lived it
[1:30:11] and they lived out their portion,
[1:30:15] then that was laid down. That was done.
[1:30:17] And then that was fulfilled. That part
[1:30:20] of Christ's coming
[1:30:23] was over.
[1:30:25] And it kept that way all the way down.
[1:30:28] And then finally,
[1:30:30] finally one would come Malachi
[1:30:34] 3 and he'd say, "Behold, I send my
[1:30:36] messenger
[1:30:38] before thy face to prepare the way
[1:30:40] before thy face and begin to describe
[1:30:44] John the Baptist."
[1:30:48] And then Malachi laid that down and that
[1:30:50] just remained a finished part until then
[1:30:53] John would come. and Malachi 4 and
[1:30:57] speaking of Christ and his first coming
[1:30:59] and second coming. And when it was done,
[1:31:02] it was all laid down. It was 400 years
[1:31:04] of silence.
[1:31:06] Then rises one comes
[1:31:09] out of the womb of Mary.
[1:31:12] And she also had to say what she said.
[1:31:15] And everything, all those segments of
[1:31:18] Christ were now embodied in this one.
[1:31:22] And he became the fullness.
[1:31:25] And he was the fullness of all things
[1:31:27] that had been and the fullness of all
[1:31:29] things that would be.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Right? And he's standing here
[1:31:34] saying
[1:31:37] looking back,
[1:31:40] when you see the days of Noah again,
[1:31:46] and when you see the days of Sodom
[1:31:48] again,
[1:31:50] even thus shall it be when the Son of
[1:31:53] Man will be revealed
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and laid it down.
[1:32:01] And then he ascended, blessed the
[1:32:02] church, and the church was born. And now
[1:32:06] we didn't understand that. Then a
[1:32:07] prophet comes and says, "But that like
[1:32:10] the husband, the bride had to die, and
[1:32:14] she went into the dark ages and came out
[1:32:16] in the person of Luther
[1:32:20] and justification and sanctification in
[1:32:23] the person of Wesley
[1:32:26] and the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:32:29] and the Pentecost." And he doesn't refer
[1:32:31] to a person. But then came the day of
[1:32:35] this age of his revealing. And now he
[1:32:38] has to have a selected one, a person who
[1:32:44] he will reveal himself through. And
[1:32:47] because he was a prophet as a son of
[1:32:49] man, this man must be a prophet. He
[1:32:50] cannot be a reformer. He must be a
[1:32:52] prophet
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; because the son of man is a prophet. So
[1:32:56] he has to come with that.
[1:32:58] And because he came out of nowhere, he
[1:33:01] came without an education. He has to
[1:33:04] come without an education. Because he
[1:33:06] spoke the language of the lowly, he has
[1:33:08] to speak the language of the lowly. He
[1:33:10] has to speak the hints and the canaints
[1:33:12] and the was and the comes and the born
[1:33:15] again.
[1:33:17] He has to speak that because that's
[1:33:20] going to stumble some people
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; and other people. That's not the issue.
[1:33:25] Right?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; The issue is what is being said and the
[1:33:28] issue is who's moving me and the issue
[1:33:30] is who's speaking to me.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And the learned and the educated and and
[1:33:36] the theologians and the great people
[1:33:38] just, oh, that's just going to pass
[1:33:40] away. This is just like, you know, this
[1:33:41] is kind of a bad dream. This isn't going
[1:33:43] to amount to anything. Oh, who could
[1:33:45] follow that?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And it just gathered.
[1:33:51] And the people that it gathered, it
[1:33:53] gathered them from the streets. It
[1:33:55] gathered them from the homeless. It
[1:33:57] gathered them from the death beds. It
[1:34:00] gathered them from the wealthy. It
[1:34:03] gathered them from presidents. It
[1:34:05] gathered them from all kinds of
[1:34:07] professional. It gathered them from
[1:34:09] workplaces. It gathered them as
[1:34:11] children. It gathered them and begin to
[1:34:13] gather them. And all of those who said,
[1:34:15] "It's going to pass away. This thing is
[1:34:16] just like a bad dream. This thing's
[1:34:18] going to pass away. Who's going to
[1:34:19] follow that? Listening to a bunch of
[1:34:21] dead men's tapes and all kinds of nasty
[1:34:23] things that they could say. Oh, he went
[1:34:24] off in the end and they just fought and
[1:34:26] they just nasted at it with their teeth
[1:34:28] and went against it. And in in in spite
[1:34:30] of that, it just kept to grow. It kept
[1:34:32] to grow. And the people that were
[1:34:34] denying it couldn't help but look on and
[1:34:36] secretly in their heart kind of wish
[1:34:38] they could live that kind of life. Wish
[1:34:39] that they could have that kind of
[1:34:40] victory. Wish that their young people
[1:34:42] were that kind of young people. Wish
[1:34:43] their wives were those kind of wives.
[1:34:45] Wish their wife wish their young ladies
[1:34:47] were those kind of young ladies. And
[1:34:48] they didn't realize it was a choice of
[1:34:50] almighty God.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; It was the consequence of hearing him
[1:34:56] whom God has sent.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; And if you're here in some other church,
[1:35:02] some other denomination, and you look
[1:35:04] around and you have to admit within
[1:35:05] yourself, within the honest of your own
[1:35:07] heart, say they got something I haven't
[1:35:09] got, then you need to ask yourself, why
[1:35:11] don't you have it?
[1:35:17] It's plain and simple.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; You've not heard
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; him whom God hath sent.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; And the people within the message maybe
[1:35:27] don't have exactly what you ought to
[1:35:28] have. I say you need to hear.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; And by hearing is doing.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; It's not just having it go in one ear
[1:35:35] and out the other. It's not just going
[1:35:36] and having it tickle you over a service
[1:35:38] and say, "Well, that was a good service.
[1:35:39] That's not it." You take it and lodge it
[1:35:41] in your heart and go out the doors. And
[1:35:43] before you go out those doors, you say
[1:35:45] that is truth.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That is what the word of God says.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; That is what the messenger has sent. And
[1:35:52] I simply go out of here with a resolve.
[1:35:54] That's what I do.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; That's what my home does.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; That's how I live. And God will honor
[1:36:03] that.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says,
[1:36:10] and I'm going to close. Just give me
[1:36:11] five minutes. I'm going to do everything
[1:36:13] I can to close in five minutes.
[1:36:20] I'm interested in this word and to make
[1:36:24] I'm going to make a man. And I wrote in
[1:36:28] my notes, what is it that makes a man?
[1:36:33] What is it, God?
[1:36:35] What's in your mind when you say let us
[1:36:39] make
[1:36:41] a man
[1:36:43] or a woman?
[1:36:48] What kind?
[1:36:50] What did you have in your mind? I can
[1:36:52] tell you that God just didn't, you know,
[1:36:54] grab a bunch of dirt and punch it a
[1:36:56] couple of times and blow into it and
[1:36:58] say, "There you are." That isn't it. And
[1:37:01] if I take just little items, allow me
[1:37:03] just a few minutes. Can I may have just
[1:37:05] a few minutes? And and brother Brand
[1:37:07] talks about he goes into the solar, he
[1:37:10] goes into the planetaries and and and
[1:37:12] and this old star of the earth and it's
[1:37:16] spinning and this clinker comes off and
[1:37:20] it smolders and it drops for millions of
[1:37:22] years etc. God stops it and and then
[1:37:25] different uh elements start coming and
[1:37:28] he say, "What's he doing?
[1:37:31] says he's making you.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; That's just this part. That's just this
[1:37:36] decaying part.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He's putting some elements in the earth.
[1:37:40] He took millions of years
[1:37:43] to bring this apart.
[1:37:46] But inside of you, oh, hear me. Inside
[1:37:49] of you, he says, I I'm going to put
[1:37:51] myself in them without beginning and
[1:37:55] without ending of days. I'm going to put
[1:37:57] myself eternal life in them. I'm going
[1:38:01] to put it in that body. And when that
[1:38:03] body is long gone back to ashes, they'll
[1:38:05] be with me.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of man I'm going to
[1:38:09] make. That's the kind of woman I'm going
[1:38:10] to make.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I want a family.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And so in the word
[1:38:18] make, here's what it is to make. I'm
[1:38:22] going to make. Let us make.
[1:38:25] That is, I'm going to prepare this
[1:38:27] person. I'm going to prepare this
[1:38:30] individual.
[1:38:31] Think it not strange. The scripture says
[1:38:34] concerning the fiery trials.
[1:38:37] They're only working out, he says, for
[1:38:39] your for our good and to perfect us and
[1:38:43] bring us into that place. These great
[1:38:47] deserts of experience
[1:38:50] where righteous men are molded into
[1:38:52] saints. And he says in prayer, "We thank
[1:38:55] thee for these experiences."
[1:38:59] We've experienced
[1:39:01] as a congregation
[1:39:04] and as individuals
[1:39:06] and as families, we've experienced some
[1:39:10] very, very difficult moments
[1:39:15] in the last couple of weeks.
[1:39:18] And I'll say to some, it may well have
[1:39:22] been a desert,
[1:39:26] a howling desert.
[1:39:30] Oh, we would have done anything to
[1:39:32] escape this experience.
[1:39:35] I received a little criticism, but very,
[1:39:37] very little.
[1:39:41] How can you say certain things? And how
[1:39:44] can you forgive?
[1:39:46] How can you tell those people to
[1:39:48] forgive, which I didn't, but I was
[1:39:50] misqued?
[1:39:53] But I will say about the experience, I'm
[1:39:55] speaking about a God that knows all
[1:39:58] things.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; He knows every second of your life. He
[1:40:01] knows the time certain things are going
[1:40:03] to happen. He knows who's involved. He
[1:40:06] knows what kind of a network he's going
[1:40:08] to cast. He knows who he's going to
[1:40:10] bring in contact with you. But that
[1:40:12] experience comes your way for your
[1:40:15] better man to turn you into a different
[1:40:17] kind. He is making a man.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; He's making a woman.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; He's making men of faith then women of
[1:40:28] faith that can face the storm and look
[1:40:31] straight into the sky and say, "I have
[1:40:33] heard the voice that you sent
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and I have believed it.
[1:40:40] I've reversed by your grace that which
[1:40:42] my fore mother has done and disbelieved
[1:40:46] you and I have believed your word
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; that you sent me.
[1:40:52] Let us make a man. Let us prepare.
[1:40:56] Let us make a man.
[1:41:00] To make is to put him in order. To put
[1:41:02] it in order. Not just to put the cells
[1:41:04] in your body and attach your your your
[1:41:06] your joints together, your knee bone to
[1:41:09] your leg bone and so on. As Ezekiel
[1:41:10] says, that's not the order.
[1:41:14] But an order to our lives in a day,
[1:41:19] if you can say amen, you can may go
[1:41:21] ahead. But in a day when things are
[1:41:23] disjointed,
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; in a day when things are pulled apart,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; families are pulled apart, they're rent
[1:41:30] aart in cruelty, men and women, wives,
[1:41:34] husbands and wives and families and so
[1:41:36] on. This message,
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, came
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; to put it back in order again.
[1:41:44] [Applause]
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] And you have a right to believe on him
[1:41:52] whom God has sent because this is not
[1:41:54] and that is why the scriptur is telling
[1:41:56] us apostle Paul saying I have much more
[1:41:59] to say to you concerning this mazec.
[1:42:02] What is it? Because Jesus did not come
[1:42:04] from the levitical priesthood. He he and
[1:42:07] there was nothing said apostle Paul says
[1:42:09] in Hebrews there was nothing said of the
[1:42:12] tribe of Judah. But but the scripture
[1:42:14] had said earlier that he would come of
[1:42:17] the tribe of Judah. The Messiah would
[1:42:19] come of the tribe of Judah. He'd be the
[1:42:21] lion of the tribe of Judah. But there
[1:42:24] had been nothing said that any high
[1:42:26] priest would come out of that line. But
[1:42:28] here comes the Apostle Paul and he takes
[1:42:30] a scripture one verse out of the Psalms.
[1:42:33] Thou art a priest forever after the
[1:42:36] order of Melzdc.
[1:42:38] We're not under the priesthood of Levi
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; because that priest died every year.
[1:42:44] Every every year there had to be another
[1:42:45] high priest or when that priest died,
[1:42:48] another high priest. And once a year he
[1:42:50] would have to go in for the sins of
[1:42:52] himself and the people. But now we have
[1:42:54] a high priest after the order of Melzdc.
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; A different order.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. I don't care what your
[1:43:03] experience has been. I'm telling you
[1:43:04] what the word has said. And the word
[1:43:06] declares that he's a he's a priest after
[1:43:08] the order of Melzdc. And the order of
[1:43:11] Melzdc was he who without beginning of
[1:43:14] days nor ending of life.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Believe me,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; and my time of life, I thank God that I
[1:43:22] have I have a high priest with that kind
[1:43:25] of order. It's eternal life order. I
[1:43:28] don't want the order of this life, my
[1:43:30] breath failing me, my body failing me,
[1:43:33] my life going from me. I don't want that
[1:43:35] order. I say come, oh high priest.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Come, O Mazdc.
[1:43:43] Come. He who gave bread and wine to my
[1:43:46] forefather Abraham, come. We're ready
[1:43:49] for the rapture. We're ready for the
[1:43:52] change of the body. He who appeared to
[1:43:55] my father Abraham in a theophony and
[1:43:57] came and met him on when he come back
[1:44:00] from the slaughter of the kings. He's a
[1:44:02] reality.
[1:44:04] And the messenger that stood here when
[1:44:06] brother Brandham stood here and the
[1:44:08] people become all all gripped in the
[1:44:11] atmosphere and the feeling that was
[1:44:13] taking place he say that's not me
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; that's him
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; and then look out and say who did he
[1:44:20] touch who did she touch not me we're 30
[1:44:24] feet away touch the high priest
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; didn't touch Aaron
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; touch Jesus Christ
[1:44:31] the high priest after the order of
[1:44:32] Melkazedc And so in the revealing of the
[1:44:35] son of man, it had to be in the order of
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; MelzDC.
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; You've heard me preach on it
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; and he look at a person. There might be
[1:44:45] somebody here with cancer.
[1:44:48] And here now is the word of God in a
[1:44:51] vessel revealing the son of man. And
[1:44:54] there's an individual with cancer. The
[1:44:57] first thing is the cells are out of
[1:45:00] order. That's right.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; The cells have gone wild.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; And the word of God would come out of
[1:45:07] him because greater was he that was in
[1:45:10] him than he that was in this person.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; And greater was he than he that was in
[1:45:15] the cancer.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; And he knew it was a demon spirit.
[1:45:18] Rebuke the demon spirit. Come out. And
[1:45:20] the cells come back in order.
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; What are you and I doing? We're aging.
[1:45:29] as we're aging, our cells don't work the
[1:45:32] same. And I've listened to scientists,
[1:45:34] medical scientists, who said that they
[1:45:36] they they gain strength, etc. And
[1:45:38] brother Brandham, he he uh he he he
[1:45:41] makes reference to it. He says, "Well,
[1:45:43] how how come, doctor, when I was young,
[1:45:45] I ate meat and potatoes, and I I grew
[1:45:48] into my strength, and now I ate exactly
[1:45:51] the same meal, and I'm diminishing."
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Well, it's the secret of the selves. And
[1:45:57] this medical scientist said that the
[1:45:59] cells come to a certain time in your
[1:46:01] life and he said for some unexplainable
[1:46:04] reason they just cease to replicate and
[1:46:08] then they begin their downward trend and
[1:46:11] you're on your way
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; to the grave. All right.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; The high priest
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; after the order of Melzdc, he the person
[1:46:22] who was sent to reveal Jesus Christ to
[1:46:25] you said this. Hear it because you're
[1:46:27] going to the you're going to the grave.
[1:46:29] Every one of you outside of the rapture,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; you might as well hear something
[1:46:33] worthwhile. Might as well hear something
[1:46:35] of hope. This isn't something you're
[1:46:37] going to play on the jukebox or
[1:46:38] something on the iPod. These are words
[1:46:40] of eternal life. And furthermore, I know
[1:46:43] I've been sent here today to say these
[1:46:46] things
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; and that's necessary.
[1:46:51] [Applause]
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; "A sweep will go over you.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; There isn't one.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; You young fellas are heading for my age
[1:47:00] and you're heading for a casket. Every
[1:47:03] person here is heading for the same.
[1:47:05] We'll find all common ground regardless
[1:47:07] of how you lived in life. will find all
[1:47:09] common ground in the on the slab someday
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; outside of the outside of the rapture
[1:47:14] and the change. But that messenger said
[1:47:17] there will be a sweep. There will be a
[1:47:19] sweep. There will be a sweep go over you
[1:47:22] and you will be changed in your Adams.
[1:47:26] That's the order of Melkazedc.
[1:47:29] That's a different order.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Your mom and dad gave you one order, but
[1:47:34] your heavenly father has given you
[1:47:35] another order.
[1:47:37] Hallelujah.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Your mom and dad did everything they
[1:47:40] could to bring you and to nurture you
[1:47:42] up. But now the Holy Spirit through the
[1:47:45] messenger and through the message of the
[1:47:47] prophet is echoing it now. Is seeking.
[1:47:49] He's working. He's laboring to get you
[1:47:51] to believe.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And you cast that doubt behind you. You
[1:47:58] say, "Satan, get behind you. Get behind
[1:48:01] me in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I deny you.
[1:48:11] I'm looking down seeing Sister Beth. I
[1:48:13] was asked about you this last week.
[1:48:14] Stand up. Sister Beth Dingwall
[1:48:17] on her way to a grave as a girl with
[1:48:19] cancer for how many years? About 8 years
[1:48:22] or thereabouts. Her medical hert.
[1:48:27] And if you haven't seen the video and
[1:48:29] got the video go of the of her dad and
[1:48:31] mother sitting here, I tell you what,
[1:48:33] it's a testimony gone around the world,
[1:48:35] Sister Beth. And God almighty in his
[1:48:38] choosing
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; wouldn't allow you to wouldn't allow
[1:48:42] that demon to take you.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He chose that you'd stand
[1:48:46] here today as a witness against him.
[1:48:50] Greater is he that's in you than he
[1:48:52] that's in the world.
[1:48:56] Greater is he.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; People say, "I want to see a miracle."
[1:49:00] You're living in miracles. They're
[1:49:01] everywhere around you.
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; It's a miracle that Brother Sam is here.
[1:49:11] Brother Steve Stevens, uh, Brother Luke
[1:49:14] Stevens is here. It's a miracle they're
[1:49:15] here. And it's a miracle God took.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Silence.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Do you know something Brother Brandham
[1:49:23] said?
[1:49:26] that's not spoken of very often.
[1:49:29] He's going to put the bride
[1:49:31] on display.
[1:49:35] Do you realize
[1:49:37] that in the last 10 days,
[1:49:40] millions upon millions of people across
[1:49:44] North America saw into your lives, heard
[1:49:48] your words, saw God on your face, and
[1:49:52] saw the bride on display. And one thing
[1:49:55] for sure, God's going to hold this
[1:49:57] nation and all who read and saw. I went
[1:50:00] over the over the pages and newspapers
[1:50:03] across six or seven websites of pages
[1:50:06] and pages and pages where the testimony
[1:50:08] has continued to go. And there's one
[1:50:10] thing that is absolutely outstanding. It
[1:50:13] is the strength and the beauty of the
[1:50:15] people and of Christ in the people. And
[1:50:18] where does this faith come from? Where
[1:50:20] did the stability come from? I say it
[1:50:22] comes from a people that heard him whom
[1:50:25] God has sent.
[1:50:29] and you're on display.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're on display.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; So he said he prepared the people. He
[1:50:38] prepared the man.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And he put them in order.
[1:50:47] I got two pages on that.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And in making the man, this is
[1:50:53] beautiful, friends. I just can't I got
[1:50:54] to have another few minutes. In making
[1:50:56] the man is let us make the man. It is to
[1:50:59] prepare him to put him in order but now
[1:51:03] it's to observe him.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Messenger come said God looking for you.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; God looking for Adam. Why? Because he
[1:51:15] made the man and he was observing the
[1:51:18] man. Where are you? Where are you Kyle?
[1:51:21] Where are you boys? Where are you? Where
[1:51:22] are you brother Roger? Where are you?
[1:51:24] Where are you? I'm looking for you. Why?
[1:51:27] Because in making the man, he has to
[1:51:29] observe the man.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous, Michelle?
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; If he hadn't come,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Michelle would probably still be
[1:51:44] slinging booze.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; As a bartender,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; oh, God's got a sense of humor.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Michelle came here to the
[1:51:54] church. Came to the church and and uh
[1:51:58] took him in the back and gave him a cup
[1:52:00] of coffee. He thought, "Hey, this place
[1:52:02] is okay."
[1:52:04] Came and sat down and sat in the front
[1:52:06] as a cup of coffee waiting for the
[1:52:09] service to take. And one of the deacons,
[1:52:11] real sweet brother, just came up and
[1:52:13] said, "You know what? I take that and he
[1:52:15] said, "Wow, it's really good. We get
[1:52:17] refills also."
[1:52:21] Well, it was a refill, but it wasn't the
[1:52:23] time you were expecting. Hallelujah. God
[1:52:26] filled him.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't it time to rejoice, friends? Isn't
[1:52:31] it time to thank God? He observes us. He
[1:52:33] watched over us. He cared for us.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And then he says to making a to making a
[1:52:40] man, I'm going to appoint him. He's must
[1:52:42] be appointed. And Jesus now because he
[1:52:45] was the revelation of God himself, he
[1:52:47] said, I appoint unto you. Yes,
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; a kingdom.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; I appoint it to you.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And friends, there's no getting out of
[1:52:56] it.
[1:52:58] [Applause]
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; He's making a woman for the man.
[1:53:04] Hallelujah. He's observing her. He's
[1:53:06] watching over her. He's caring for her.
[1:53:09] Oh, how wonderful it is.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; And we're seeing her. We're able to
[1:53:13] fellowship with her.
[1:53:16] You think I'm just shouting out of
[1:53:19] excitement. I'm shouting out of absolute
[1:53:21] spiritual enthusiasm.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; How happy we are.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for you. And I thank God
[1:53:28] for a people that believed on him.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Whom God has sent.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's just thank him with
[1:53:35] our heads bowed a moment. Oh God, we're
[1:53:38] here to thank you.

[1:54:15] us. Receive our thanksgiving throughout
[1:54:17] this day in the praise that is offered
