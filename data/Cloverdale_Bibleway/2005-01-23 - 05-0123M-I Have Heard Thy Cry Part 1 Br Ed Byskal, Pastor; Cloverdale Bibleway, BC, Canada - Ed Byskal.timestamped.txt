[15:07] a year ago I submitted a prayer request
[15:09] concerning an ungodly neighbor who had
[15:11] been harassing us for three years with
[15:13] lawsuits and threatening even more. He

[15:24] mountain. Amen. Lord will meet all our
[15:27] needs. Amen. Brother Alex, as a quick
[15:29] testimony, my son Matthew and I would
[15:31] like to thank the Lord Jesus for healing
[15:33] us of the flu and affected throat and
[15:35] high fever. It came so bad that Brother
[15:38] Alex could hardly just swallow a drink
[15:39] of water. But we have a heavenly father
[15:42] who cares for us and fights our battles.
[15:43] We thank him with all of our hearts.

[20:49] mystery.

[20:57] would leave it all to come for one like
[21:01] me.
[21:08] If I started writing now and wrote
[21:13] forever,

[27:56] Praise God for that grace.
[28:01] I have uh a number of things I need to
[28:04] mention to you before we get to the
[28:08] message this morning.
[28:11] uh
[28:13] brother Wolf Ram
[28:17] Hornshade of uh Narramata.
[28:20] Uh they come here to the service
[28:23] whenever they were able. Always sat over
[28:26] here right against the wall. Some of you
[28:28] no doubt met them. His wife, Sister
[28:31] Laura, passed away a night before last
[28:35] 6:00 in the evening. And uh the service
[28:40] is going to be this Thursday at 11:00
[28:43] a.m. in the Park View Funeral Home in
[28:48] Pentictton, which is on the it's on the
[28:51] main street of Pentictton.
[28:54] So those of you that
[28:57] uh remember shaking their hand and maybe
[29:00] greeting them at least uh we will hold
[29:04] them up in prayer as we have uh family.
[29:07] There's a daughter that I know of and I
[29:10] don't know if there's more family as
[29:12] well. I don't know her age or if she's
[29:16] married. I don't know a whole lot about
[29:19] her. But uh
[29:21] we want to be remembering our brother
[29:23] Wolfra in prayer. And those of you that
[29:26] are able to go or wish to go, it will be
[29:29] in Pentictton Park View Funeral Home
[29:33] 11:00 on Thursday.
[29:37] Our our sister suffered with a liver
[29:40] ailment for quite a number of years, but
[29:42] it seemed that she was gaining strength
[29:45] just right here at the end. and uh and
[29:49] yet God allowed her to
[29:52] uh come home. It was uh brother Wolram
[29:56] said something that was very really
[29:58] quite remarkable.
[30:00] He said she can't go unless she passes
[30:04] before God. And I thought that was a
[30:07] nice way to put it. She's unable to go
[30:09] unless she passes right before God. And
[30:12] that was really wonderful.
[30:16] Uh, brother Darren
[30:19] Danbrook. I have not spoken of brother
[30:21] Darren in public because I was asked not
[30:24] to, but now there are so many here that
[30:27] have been writing him and and uh this
[30:31] church holds secrets like a sie. So I
[30:35] want to compliment you on that.
[30:38] Uh
[30:42] we do try to do things undercover once
[30:44] in a while and the tighter I hold them
[30:46] the more suspicious
[30:48] I the I get suspicious looks at me like
[30:52] I have done something evil. You are
[30:55] holding something back from us and we
[30:58] are not accustomed to that. We have a
[31:00] very open, transparent congregation and
[31:03] you are obliged to let us know so that
[31:07] we can let everybody else know.
[31:11] And the reason I don't tell even some of
[31:14] my dearest friends when certain things
[31:16] are happening undercover is because I I
[31:18] know in all good conscience what you're
[31:20] going to do because you have somebody
[31:23] that you're going to confide in. And in
[31:26] a close family congregation such as we
[31:28] have, we all have a few of those friends
[31:31] who we can confide in and before long uh
[31:36] the whole church knows because we we
[31:38] confide in one another.
[31:41] But brother Darren Danbrook
[31:44] before he was saved and before he was
[31:46] delivered
[31:49] he was excuse me in his previous life
[31:53] and uh
[31:55] didn't do anything as far as the
[31:57] Canadian laws concerned that was an
[32:00] infraction of the law but was engaged
[32:03] with some other people in some
[32:05] activities that the uh uh uh American
[32:09] authorities did not feel or at least
[32:12] they certainly wanted to question him
[32:15] and uh for that reason he wasn't going
[32:17] across the border. But one day he
[32:19] decided he would go across the border.
[32:21] He needed something for his car or
[32:23] whatever it was had something to do with
[32:24] his wheels and they nabbed him at the
[32:27] border and he has been in uh
[32:30] incarcerated ever since. Uh, of course,
[32:35] you know, that was a very low point for
[32:39] him and we did everything that we could
[32:42] and he's caught in the jaws of the law
[32:44] and between, you know, this ruling and
[32:47] that ruling and all the rest of it. They
[32:49] actually wanted him to plea bargain and
[32:51] he didn't want to do that. And I'm
[32:52] probably telling you more than I should,
[32:54] but anyway, I don't know. Once you're in
[32:56] the grasp of the authorities, it's it's
[32:58] pretty difficult, you know. And so he
[33:02] shuffled from here to there, this
[33:03] detention center to that one, but he's
[33:05] in uh in a Los Angeles facility,
[33:09] but he just decided that uh and in the
[33:12] brief conversations we've had that he
[33:15] was there for a purpose. So he began to
[33:17] witness and he began to go to all the
[33:20] chaplain's meetings and he began to
[33:23] before long, of course, he was having
[33:24] little Bible studies almost by himself
[33:27] because there were so many interested in
[33:28] what he was saying. And I don't care
[33:31] what kind of uh chaplain's service you
[33:33] go to, any believer is going to be
[33:35] saying something that the chaplain
[33:37] certainly isn't saying. And uh uh you
[33:41] start talking to people about, you know,
[33:43] the original sin and baptism according
[33:45] to the word of God, and you're bound to
[33:47] get some people saying, "Hey, that's
[33:49] right. You know, let me hear more about
[33:51] that. Where did you get that?" So, he's
[33:54] been having a stream of church age books
[33:57] and uh seals books and they've got about
[34:01] 20 messages in now and they have started
[34:04] to get some videos of the services here
[34:07] and they had just received the last five
[34:09] and u uh chaplain said no more. this
[34:13] five, that's the last of it for whatever
[34:16] reason. But they have quite a bunch and
[34:18] they have about six or seven uh men in
[34:21] the prison that have been gathering.
[34:24] It's it's on a regular basis. They
[34:26] gather steady for for Bible study and
[34:29] for meetings. So, uh he he said he told
[34:34] me yesterday, "Yeah, go ahead and tell
[34:36] the people. You can tell them." So, uh
[34:40] we don't know just how long he's going
[34:41] to be in there. They have nine videos,
[34:44] he said, alto together. And today they
[34:46] received uh uh today they received one
[34:49] that was very appropriate
[34:51] in one place and in one accord
[35:00] whether you want to be or not.
[35:05] Remember brother Darren, would you pray
[35:07] for him? his uh mother and father are
[35:10] going to are going down to see him uh on
[35:13] the 30th of this month and that'll be
[35:15] the first time he's had visitors. Um I
[35:19] just want to say that uh you know sister
[35:20] Lana had had witnessed to brother Darren
[35:24] and it was just wonderful. I know that
[35:26] from the very very beginnings she met
[35:28] him in a store and and from there on
[35:30] just began to witness to him of Christ
[35:33] and uh she has written sister Lewan I
[35:36] don't see her just now but she has
[35:37] written if you see her writing notes
[35:40] that's what she's doing in church those
[35:41] notes sometimes go just the way she's
[35:44] written them right from this service and
[35:46] are mailed down to him so he can get
[35:48] what was what was said in the last
[35:50] service and we appreciate everybody's
[35:52] effort just wonderful
[35:55] Well, are you happy to be in the house
[35:57] of God?
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Lance is going to be preaching
[36:00] tonight. And this morning's service is
[36:03] probably going to be really quite
[36:05] different. Uh
[36:08] I've got some things that I want to say
[36:11] from my heart. And uh uh I feel that I
[36:16] feel that the church here has a has a
[36:21] mission within the confines of the
[36:24] message.
[36:26] Uh every church, every minister, every
[36:29] believer,
[36:31] they are geographically located where
[36:34] they are
[36:36] by I want to believe by God's design.
[36:40] And if God has a purpose in us being
[36:43] here together,
[36:45] uh that we interact with one another,
[36:48] then I believe that God has a a purpose
[36:51] that goes far beyond
[36:53] your individual life, my individual life
[36:57] or your home or my home or your loved
[37:00] ones and my loved ones. I believe it
[37:03] goes far beyond that
[37:05] to whatever is the mission
[37:09] and the vision that God has given to the
[37:13] congregation, the assembly here in the
[37:15] ministry.
[37:17] And I want to say from the depths of my
[37:20] heart that I appreciate and love you for
[37:25] the support,
[37:27] the
[37:29] spiritual support. It's in your
[37:31] handshake. It's in your voice. It's in
[37:34] your smile. It's in your willingness,
[37:39] your readiness to serve God at any
[37:42] level, at any capacity.
[37:44] And I appreciate that. And I believe God
[37:47] appreciates that. I don't feel that our
[37:51] mission is through.
[37:53] I believe that it's uh perhaps has a has
[37:58] a a great distance yet to go.
[38:03] And uh
[38:05] when I was just on my way to Ghana,
[38:09] uh I had some questions about going to
[38:12] Ghana because it was a rather sudden
[38:17] uh trip
[38:19] and uh I had had, you know, I'd had some
[38:23] phone calls and some counsel about
[38:26] uh what I might meet up with over there,
[38:28] but I felt directed to go.
[38:31] And while I was just either on the way,
[38:36] uh I might have been on the plane or
[38:38] just before I left, I opened up my Bible
[38:41] and I don't recommend this. I didn't
[38:43] open up my Bible to see anything. My
[38:45] Bible just opened and I looked down not
[38:49] even knowing where I was reading and I
[38:50] looked down but I but this was this was
[38:53] cons not consuming me but it was very
[38:55] very much on my mind about going and the
[38:58] different voices that I'd heard and a
[39:01] minister or two had called me and so on
[39:03] and I looked down and read these words
[39:07] now also when I am old and gayheaded oh
[39:10] God forsake me not until I have showed
[39:15] thy strength unto this generation and
[39:18] thy power to everyone that is to come.
[39:23] And then that spoke directly to myself,
[39:25] to my own heart, that I knew that God
[39:28] was going to work this scripture out in
[39:32] my own life for those that I was
[39:34] supposed to meet in this generation and
[39:37] those that are to come. And I realize
[39:39] that I have some to meet and I have some
[39:41] to be responsible for. And as we all do,
[39:45] that's why you're here this morning. You
[39:47] reach people who I will never see. And
[39:51] the ministers will never see. They'll
[39:53] never contact. They'll never never shake
[39:56] the hands that you will shake and
[39:58] they'll never speak to the people that
[39:59] you'll speak to.
[40:02] So, uh I believe that we do have a a a
[40:05] mission and and as a result, there are
[40:09] things that happen and and you get led
[40:11] into a certain direction. You don't even
[40:13] know why. Uh, and I I have referred back
[40:17] many times and I'm sure you won't mind
[40:19] me repeating when Sydney Jackson who had
[40:22] been with brother Brandham in the great
[40:23] meetings throughout South Africa came I
[40:26] believe it was his first it was his
[40:28] first visit as I recall to the little
[40:31] log church and we probably had maybe 60
[40:35] 70 80 people at the time as a
[40:37] congregation might have been a hundred
[40:40] and uh he wrote me a letter. He was on
[40:42] his way home to South Africa. He'd been
[40:44] in Tucson, I believe, and he wrote me a
[40:47] letter from South Africa and uh he said
[40:50] in that letter, "Brother Eddie,
[40:53] uh for some reason known only to God
[40:57] himself, God has overshadowed Cloverdale
[41:02] for a purpose." He said, "For a purpose
[41:05] that's known only to himself." And that
[41:08] really lodged in my heart. And I
[41:10] wondered what this elderly man who was
[41:12] about 76 or 77 at the time, what it was.
[41:16] I know when I traveled into South
[41:18] Africa, the people there had regarded
[41:20] him uh very highly and and because God
[41:24] used him in a in a prophetic way in some
[41:28] times. And so I wondered whether he
[41:30] there was something that he was, you
[41:33] know, seeing that I as a younger man was
[41:36] not seeing. And then since that time
[41:39] I've seen that uh God has led you know
[41:43] you as individuals
[41:45] families they have grown they have
[41:48] you've married you have children
[41:51] uh people have come from so many many
[41:54] places we brother DJ wrote a letter we
[41:58] were writing a letter to a mayor of a
[41:59] city in Poland David about three days
[42:02] ago and it was a surprise to me he
[42:05] listed down we have 37 37 nations
[42:10] represented in this congregation.
[42:14] And that in itself is really startling
[42:17] when you think of it. 37 nations. Then
[42:21] you'd say, well, how is that or why is
[42:23] that? That's all part of God's great
[42:26] mystery. That's part of God's doing. But
[42:29] I trust that you feel that you are here
[42:31] in God's program.
[42:35] I want to just sing before we read the
[42:37] scripture. He hideth my soul. Let's just
[42:41] sing the first verse and of course would
[42:43] you stand please and we'll sing it
[42:45] together.
[42:54] A wonderful
[42:57] Savior
[42:58] is Jesus my Lord.
[43:02] A wonderful
[43:04] savior
[43:06] to me.
[43:09] He hideth my soul in the cliff of the
[43:15] rock.
[43:17] Deliver
[43:19] measure my sea.
[43:24] He hideth my soul in the cliff of the
[43:31] rock that shadows
[43:34] a dry
[43:37] land.
[43:40] He hideth my life in the depths of his
[43:46] love and covers me there with his hand
[43:55] and covers me there
[43:59] with his hand.
[44:03] Our gracious and loving heavenly father,
[44:06] this is the Lord's day and we've set it
[44:08] aside for you
[44:10] in the service this morning, the service
[44:13] this evening. The word that you've laid,
[44:16] oh God, upon the hearts of your
[44:18] servants, I pray that it will be
[44:22] ordained
[44:24] that we may be just oracles. And this
[44:27] morning, Lord, I pray for the
[44:29] congregation. I pray for myself. I ask
[44:32] Father that you will take me in your
[44:36] control and under the dominance of the
[44:39] Holy Spirit and may everything that is
[44:41] said and done be to the glory of the
[44:44] name of Jesus Christ. We pray father God
[44:49] of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, God of the
[44:52] prophets, God of the apostles, God of
[44:54] the messengers. You certainly are the
[44:57] God that stood by the prophet of God in
[45:00] this generation. Lord, we are unashamed
[45:05] of the great things that you have done.
[45:07] We are unashamed of the things that you
[45:09] are doing even at this time. And we pray
[45:12] that you will visit us in a very special
[45:15] way. Make our lives a blessing. We pray
[45:18] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:22] I would like to read from the Old
[45:24] Testament from Exodus the 3 chapter
[45:34] starting at verse two.
[45:38] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[45:40] him, which was Moses,
[45:42] in a flame of fire out of the midst of a
[45:45] bush. And he looked, and behold, the
[45:48] bush burned with fire. and the bush was
[45:51] not consumed.
[45:53] And Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[45:56] and see this great sight why the bush is
[45:59] not burned." And when the Lord saw that
[46:03] he turned aside to see, God called unto
[46:07] him out of the midst of the bush and
[46:09] said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here
[46:12] am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh
[46:15] hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy
[46:19] feet. for the place whereon thou
[46:22] standest is holy ground. Moreover, he
[46:25] said, I am the God of thy father, the
[46:27] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
[46:30] the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
[46:32] face, for he was afraid to look upon
[46:35] God.
[46:37] And the Lord said, I have surely seen
[46:40] the affliction of my people which are in
[46:43] Egypt, and have heard their cry by
[46:45] reason of their task masters. For I know
[46:48] their sorrows, and am come down to
[46:51] deliver them out of the hand of the
[46:54] Egyptians, to bring them up out of the
[46:58] out of that land, unto a good land and a
[47:02] large, unto a land flowing with milk and
[47:05] honey, unto the place of the Canaanites,
[47:08] and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and
[47:10] the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[47:13] Jebusites. And now therefore, behold,
[47:16] the cry of the children of Israel is
[47:19] come unto me, and I have also seen the
[47:23] oppression wherewith the Egyptians
[47:26] oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I
[47:29] will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
[47:32] mayest bring forth my people, the
[47:35] children of Israel, out of Egypt. God
[47:38] bless you. You may have your seats.
[47:43] Not to distract from the scripture, but
[47:45] it's nice to see Michael and Lysa back
[47:49] from a rather brief honeymoon, but nice
[47:53] to see you in church. This is the best
[47:54] honeymoon.
[47:56] And for all the rest,
[47:59] uh, I got word from Rabbi Richmond this
[48:02] morning and his wife that their son, I
[48:05] believe it's their second eldest son,
[48:07] they wanted to share their joy. He has
[48:09] become engaged to a lovely young lady
[48:12] and they will be married this summer. So
[48:15] those of you that communicate with them,
[48:17] you can at least know now that I have
[48:20] informed you and they're so happy about
[48:22] that.
[48:25] Um, I want to speak uh this morning
[48:30] and move as quickly as I can
[48:33] out from this scripture
[48:36] uh titled
[48:39] I'm titling this message I have heard
[48:42] their cry
[48:44] but uh for a subject I want to speak on
[48:47] signs.
[48:49] Now,
[48:52] this scripture which we just read, we're
[48:55] all very very familiar with it. God
[48:59] uh arresting Moses at the burning bush.
[49:04] Uh this is certainly one of the great
[49:06] events in history.
[49:10] Everything
[49:12] continued on. I'd like to have you think
[49:16] in a certain line just for a few moments
[49:18] now.
[49:20] One of the great events in history. Yet
[49:24] everything continued on. You know, the
[49:27] Hebrews still made bricks. The task
[49:29] masters were still at their jobs.
[49:32] Everything in Egypt was continuing on.
[49:34] But God had already moved on the scene.
[49:37] Said, "I'm going to. I've come down."
[49:41] Something was moving now. But yet the
[49:44] world was just going on. I want you to
[49:46] just notice that because I have I want
[49:49] to make reference to it in our present
[49:51] time. We could speak of other great
[49:54] moments in time. Uh Mount
[49:57] Transfiguration,
[49:59] Moses, Elijah, Christ, uh Peter, James,
[50:02] and John on the mountain. Such an
[50:05] incredible experience happening. But
[50:08] everything just continued on. People
[50:11] were in their markets. They were buying.
[50:13] They were selling, they were trading. Uh
[50:15] young people were getting old and old
[50:17] people were getting older. Everything
[50:19] was happening. It is as it was
[50:23] just continued on. Uh the resurrection
[50:27] of Jesus Christ, greatest event perhaps
[50:32] that we can speak of and it is recorded.
[50:36] It is absolutely recorded not by a not
[50:39] by a handful of people but by many. and
[50:42] and uh as the prophet said, he proved
[50:46] that day who he was. He proved it. He
[50:49] had spoken it, but now he proved it. But
[50:51] the world went on.
[50:54] The Roman kingdom went on. Government
[50:57] went on. Their they had their
[50:59] parliamentarians that went on. They had
[51:01] their senates and it went on. They had
[51:03] their dignitaries. Everything, the
[51:05] workers, the average person, the woman
[51:08] who just gave birth to a baby, it just
[51:10] continued on. It went on. Life went on.
[51:13] And that's a very important point this
[51:15] morning because I want to make this uh
[51:18] uh indelibly mark your mind that God in
[51:23] his economy can do outstanding
[51:27] outstanding things. He can even change
[51:29] the course of his direction from what
[51:33] had been happening for 400 years to
[51:36] something that was going to change. And
[51:39] yet the the people were not really
[51:43] conscious of it. They're not aware of
[51:45] it. And I say that because I personally
[51:49] believe there are there are outstanding
[51:53] things that are happening around us. And
[51:58] I'm afraid that we are perhaps uh blind
[52:02] to it or we're numb to it or we're
[52:06] uninformed. And that's why I feel it's a
[52:09] great responsibility upon the ministry
[52:12] not just to preach sermons but the the
[52:15] to bring the word to where we are now.
[52:18] That is outstanding thing of brother
[52:20] Brandham's message his message not
[52:22] sermons but his entire message. He says
[52:25] in one place that that that he spoke of
[52:28] and he just used this term the position
[52:30] of the nations now because that had a
[52:34] that had where the nations were now had
[52:37] a direct reference to the scripture and
[52:40] the message and what he was bringing at
[52:42] that time. And of course the the
[52:45] position of the nations at that time is
[52:47] very different from the position of the
[52:49] nations today. But that but it has not
[52:52] changed the principle. If it was
[52:54] important back then, it's also important
[52:57] today. But if we think, well, the world,
[52:59] you know, it has nothing to do with me.
[53:01] It just goes on, just goes on. But that
[53:03] is not the case. God is dealing in the
[53:06] affairs of men. And it's God who's in
[53:09] control. And he allows powers to rise
[53:12] and to fulfill certain promises, and he
[53:16] allows them to fall. He He allows men to
[53:19] rise. He allows them to be removed off
[53:21] the scene when they're done. And he does
[53:23] not do it according to our agenda or
[53:26] according to what we think is the right
[53:28] thing to do. God does it. He's
[53:31] sovereign. He just does it in his own in
[53:33] his own way. And so we have, you know,
[53:37] the opening, Brother Brandham refers to
[53:39] the opening of the seals, a great event.
[53:42] Well, to an awful lot of people, the
[53:45] most the public uh on the face of the
[53:47] earth, it was no event at all because
[53:49] they don't know anything about it. And
[53:51] even amongst those who call themselves
[53:53] as believers, uh, a lot of them have
[53:55] never even touched the book. They they
[53:57] wouldn't even know. Uh, so they don't
[53:59] know what that event was. He talks about
[54:01] it as a great event. And of course, the
[54:04] resurrection
[54:05] and the rapture, the catching away of
[54:08] the of of the believing church is going
[54:11] to be a great event. But even that,
[54:15] even that,
[54:16] as amazing as it might seem to you, and
[54:19] your mind might have a hard time to get
[54:20] around it, even that will be unknown
[54:24] to the general public.
[54:27] They may gradually become aware
[54:29] something has happened and so on and so
[54:31] forth, and you just wonder about it. But
[54:34] this church will still be standing here,
[54:36] I expect, if it happens in the time
[54:40] frame we think it's going to happen. And
[54:42] there'll be people who come here to this
[54:44] church. There will be people who will
[54:45] come and there will be people who will
[54:47] be expecting a a meeting. I want to
[54:49] announce to you, I won't be preaching.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to you, you want to
[54:55] make sure you're not sitting there.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; We're in that hour.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; We're in that time. Say, well, they've
[55:05] they've wanted this for generations.
[55:07] Absolutely true. But it is those who
[55:09] only have lived in faith in faith of
[55:12] that very moment. Their faith was
[55:14] vibrant. Their faith was believing.
[55:17] Their faith was it can be in the next
[55:18] moment, the next five minutes. That's
[55:20] the one. That's the believer.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Are you that believing people today? Are
[55:27] you in that kind of expectation?
[55:31] in a prophet like under Moses as we see
[55:35] the clock tick around the time clock of
[55:38] God's time piece all the prophets being
[55:40] fulfilled all the prophecies being
[55:43] fulfilled and sitting right up before us
[55:46] now for the coming Messiah we are
[55:49] certainly a happy people and should be
[55:52] that way
[55:55] &gt;&gt; for we're looking forward to the great
[55:57] event that ever happened in all human
[56:01] history or ever will the second coming
[56:04] of uh our Lord Jesus Christ the son of
[56:07] God to catch a church to himself and
[56:11] take her to himself what a glorious time
[56:14] that will be this was 1959 he was
[56:17] speaking and there's many great events
[56:20] has happened in the world many great
[56:24] things but nothing like that nothing
[56:28] like that nothing will compare with that
[56:31] now
[56:36] this this thought that all things
[56:38] continue as they are. I'd like to give
[56:39] you a scripture. Knowing this first that
[56:43] there shall come in the last days
[56:45] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[56:48] and saying, "Where is the promise of his
[56:51] coming? For since the fathers fell
[56:54] asleep, all things continue as they were
[57:00] from the beginning of the creation.
[57:03] That's what that is what so many say.
[57:07] And maybe it's undeclared, but that is
[57:10] why that is how so many live. And I'm
[57:13] saying this morning, we must not live
[57:15] that way. We must not live as though all
[57:19] things continue as they were. We go
[57:21] about and do our things and do our
[57:23] business and carry on our lives and get
[57:26] our education and go forward in life uh
[57:30] as though uh nothing's going to ever
[57:32] stop it. Well, the thing is friends,
[57:36] even if you lived your life out, your
[57:38] breath and life will stop it someday.
[57:40] And so it is absolutely imperative that
[57:44] you live in the expectation
[57:48] you live as though your your breath
[57:50] right now is your last one and say I'm
[57:53] going if I if God calls me, I will go uh
[57:58] in the faith. I will go with my heart
[58:00] filled with anticipation. I will go
[58:03] having been active for God. I will go
[58:06] with this Holy Spirit burning within me.
[58:09] That's how I will go.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Whether I go in a rapture, whether I go
[58:13] by the way of the grave, however I go,
[58:16] I'm going to go the right way.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't live as all things
[58:23] continue as they were
[58:25] in the world falling apart.
[58:31] He speaks of the last name that's been
[58:34] redeemed that was put on that book. And
[58:38] he says, "And it might be a strange
[58:41] time. Do you ever think people will go
[58:44] right on preaching?
[58:47] The church will go right on even
[58:49] thinking they're getting people saved."
[58:53] He said, "It's too late then.
[58:56] It's all over." And the message will go
[58:59] to the totally lost. So the message will
[59:02] be here as well.
[59:04] Even as the message of Christ which was
[59:06] rejected, the message continued on. Even
[59:09] though the world as as a as a whole
[59:12] rejected it
[59:14] &gt;&gt; and he says the message so this message
[59:17] that you have message books will be
[59:18] present. Message books will probably
[59:20] continue to be printed who knows what
[59:23] and it will go on and the message will
[59:25] continue on.
[59:28] And he said the message will go on to
[59:31] the totally lost. There will be people
[59:35] totally lost reading and hearing the
[59:38] message.
[59:40] He said just like it did in the days of
[59:43] Noah, seven days in the ark, it did in
[59:47] the days of Sodom, Jesus himself in the
[59:50] third stage of his ministry. Then I go
[59:52] on and we don't know what time these
[59:56] things might happen. And let's be
[59:59] warned, don't just stand around.
[1:00:03] Can we say amen?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Let's do something about it. And if
[1:00:08] we're not right with God, let's get
[1:00:11] right with God. And I say amen to that.
[1:00:14] If we're not right with God, let's get
[1:00:17] right with God. Don't just stand around.
[1:00:19] Do something about it.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] Now there was a very interesting uh and
[1:00:30] and moving phrase for me which I'm going
[1:00:32] to use this morning out of the message
[1:00:36] uniting time and sign.
[1:00:39] He said if you'll just watch nature and
[1:00:41] that's a marvelous message uniting sign
[1:00:44] and time.
[1:00:46] My subject is signs.
[1:00:49] If you'll just watch nature it does the
[1:00:52] same thing. He'd been going on on that
[1:00:55] subject. And here's the sentence.
[1:00:58] Nature
[1:01:00] is God's calendar of signs.
[1:01:04] Nature is God's calendar of signs. He
[1:01:10] asked, "Did you know that?" He said
[1:01:12] Jesus told them to watch nature.
[1:01:15] The sea would be roaring
[1:01:18] and there'd be different things.
[1:01:21] I'm going slowly on purpose. The sea
[1:01:24] would be roaring.
[1:01:26] That is certainly meaningful to us
[1:01:29] today.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; The sea has been roaring.
[1:01:34] I don't know if you are aware if these
[1:01:38] are quite well publicized things
[1:01:42] but in this last uh great earthquake
[1:01:47] and incidentally the 40 years is also
[1:01:51] very significant. I will be referring to
[1:01:53] it.
[1:01:59] the the ocean.
[1:02:02] Uh, one of the things, and this is the
[1:02:06] US spy imagery
[1:02:08] agency is working around the clock to
[1:02:12] gather information
[1:02:14] to warn mariners
[1:02:17] and begin the task of recharting the
[1:02:19] altered coastlines and ports throughout
[1:02:23] the region, which is a vast region where
[1:02:26] this tsunami took place. Officials at
[1:02:30] the Bethesda, Maryland based national
[1:02:34] uh agency
[1:02:36] say that efforts will take international
[1:02:39] cooperation over months and if not
[1:02:41] years.
[1:02:43] Thousands of navigational aids such as
[1:02:46] buoys were carried off by 50 foot to 100
[1:02:51] foot waves. Old shipwrecks marked on
[1:02:54] charts have been relocated,
[1:02:58] joined by new wrecks
[1:03:01] that will have to be moved or charted.
[1:03:05] And just how different the ocean floor
[1:03:08] looks remains largely a mystery.
[1:03:11] The bulk of the tsunami
[1:03:15] recovery has gone toward humanitarian
[1:03:17] relief.
[1:03:19] But gradually, however, attention will
[1:03:22] turn to what it will take to make the
[1:03:24] region's waters safe.
[1:03:27] The agency which analyzes satellite
[1:03:30] imagery and produces maps and charts for
[1:03:34] the defense department has sent out uh
[1:03:38] two tsunami related warnings and that
[1:03:41] ports of call may be heavily damaged
[1:03:45] and it it has changed the configuration
[1:03:48] of the ocean bottom.
[1:03:50] The agency has received two reports that
[1:03:55] in one area of the straight of Malaa
[1:03:59] which divides Malaysia from Sumatra
[1:04:02] that's very busy ocean
[1:04:05] uh traffic through those straits.
[1:04:09] That depth
[1:04:11] before the tsunami was 4,060
[1:04:14] ft deep.
[1:04:17] In just a moment's time, the earth rose
[1:04:20] and it's only 105 deep today.
[1:04:24] From 4,60
[1:04:26] feet to 105 ft, raised up a mountain
[1:04:31] there and displaced a massive amount of
[1:04:34] water.
[1:04:36] And another merchant marine ship
[1:04:40] has logged that the depth was cut in
[1:04:42] another area from 3,855
[1:04:47] ft to 92 ft.
[1:04:52] Brother Brandham said waves roaring and
[1:04:56] different things
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to be ignorant of
[1:05:02] these things. And that happened just in
[1:05:04] a moment of time.
[1:05:10] There was another article. I'm not going
[1:05:12] to make reference to it, but brother
[1:05:15] Brandham said in India before that
[1:05:16] earthquake, an earthquake that took
[1:05:18] place there, how the birds left the
[1:05:21] rocks and came and sat in the trees that
[1:05:23] were in the middle of fields and the
[1:05:25] animals who were getting shade against
[1:05:27] walls and and of barns and walls of
[1:05:31] stone walls came and stood in the middle
[1:05:33] of the field, gathered in the middle of
[1:05:34] the field. The earthquake struck and the
[1:05:37] people were destroyed, but the animals
[1:05:39] weren't. And they got the big article
[1:05:42] here. What did the animals know?
[1:05:45] Because they haven't found animals in
[1:05:48] the destruction of this tsunami. The
[1:05:51] animals departed.
[1:05:54] They said even small animals and
[1:05:56] rodents. They haven't found them to any
[1:05:59] any degree. I haven't read where they
[1:06:01] found any, but that's beside the point.
[1:06:03] Brother Brandham said, and one place it
[1:06:05] says, did they have a sixth sense?
[1:06:10] And they certainly obviously did have
[1:06:13] with the message that we have.
[1:06:17] Uh
[1:06:18] it should be abundantly clear to us as
[1:06:22] believers that God has sent us
[1:06:24] sufficient
[1:06:25] so that we do not need to be uninformed
[1:06:28] or ignorant. And neither do we need to
[1:06:31] be dull spiritually. We should be our
[1:06:33] expectation should be so heightened and
[1:06:36] the message didn't come to bring fear.
[1:06:38] It came to take the fear off the people
[1:06:41] and we thank God for that.
[1:06:46] said to scientists
[1:06:48] uh that the earth is ringing like a bell
[1:06:53] because the earth they said it's
[1:06:54] actually vibrating and on a scale of I
[1:06:57] don't know what scale they would use but
[1:07:00] if the scales say that the they said the
[1:07:02] earth does that normally anyway because
[1:07:04] it has got it quaking and moving and so
[1:07:06] on constantly moving the uh the plates
[1:07:10] are moving and they said if it was on a
[1:07:13] scale say of two for example, it's
[1:07:15] presently still at about 20 and it was
[1:07:19] uh you know far more than that of course
[1:07:20] during the actual uh happening of the
[1:07:24] earthquake. But that earthquake and they
[1:07:27] go back always to say that it was the
[1:07:29] greatest since uh Alaska and Alaska is
[1:07:33] the one that the prophet of God
[1:07:35] predicted would happen, prophesied would
[1:07:38] happen, that judgment was going to
[1:07:39] strike the west coast and happen in just
[1:07:42] a few days. and with the men that were
[1:07:44] there as a witness
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; who he spoke to and said there was a
[1:07:48] sign that whirlwind that came down as a
[1:07:51] sign and judgment is going to strike the
[1:07:53] west coast. But they say also that the
[1:07:56] earth and you've no doubt heard some of
[1:07:58] these things and it's not in my message
[1:08:00] as such but I I want to say it because
[1:08:02] it's part of the reference points that I
[1:08:05] want to make that the that the earth
[1:08:07] it's actually changed its rotation and
[1:08:10] that it has sped up slightly just a a
[1:08:14] very very slight amount and that it
[1:08:16] changed its axis a wee bit. the the
[1:08:20] blast was so great. And so uh
[1:08:25] now a prophet says that nature is God's
[1:08:28] calendar of signs and a sign can be a
[1:08:34] signal like a flashing red light.
[1:08:37] Perhaps a sign can also be a warning and
[1:08:42] a sign can also be a token. It's a sign.
[1:08:46] You possess a sign. He said, "You carry
[1:08:48] the token with you." So, I need to
[1:08:50] announce to you, you have a sign.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You have a sign that's in you. And the
[1:08:55] only and he said that token could only
[1:08:58] come in the evening time.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It could only come in this day. It had
[1:09:05] to arrive at this time because there
[1:09:08] would be certain individuals who by
[1:09:11] God's forordination in his plan because
[1:09:14] he can't learn anything. God is
[1:09:16] absolutely infinite in his knowledge. He
[1:09:19] knew you were going to be here. He knew
[1:09:22] who you would be in touch with. He knew
[1:09:25] every word that your ears would hear and
[1:09:28] that one day you would hear something. A
[1:09:30] lot of what you hear is really
[1:09:33] meaningless. And some of us have heard a
[1:09:35] lot of trash and it doesn't do us any
[1:09:38] good whatsoever. But God knew that you
[1:09:40] would hear something that would actually
[1:09:42] respond to a seed down in your soul and
[1:09:46] it would it would ignite that to to to
[1:09:49] life. Not merely life, but to eternal
[1:09:52] life. God knew that would happen. And so
[1:09:55] he sent the token which is the the token
[1:09:59] that a sign that you were redeemed. You
[1:10:04] are in the redeemed class of people and
[1:10:08] we don't have a right to say you know uh
[1:10:11] do I have any choice in that God
[1:10:14] arranged that you would meet who you
[1:10:16] should meet. You would hear what you
[1:10:17] would hear. You would hear exactly what
[1:10:20] the soul needed to hear and it would be
[1:10:23] like the woman at the well. It has
[1:10:25] nothing to do with your past, nothing to
[1:10:27] do with chance, has nothing to do with
[1:10:29] luck. It was God's election. Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And by God's election, you heard what
[1:10:34] you heard. By God's election, not by uh
[1:10:38] uh um your mother and father bringing
[1:10:39] you into the world, but by God's
[1:10:41] election,
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; he brought you forth, gave you life so
[1:10:45] that you would hear what you would hear
[1:10:46] so you would be the kind of person that
[1:10:48] you would be. And so he'd have a vessel
[1:10:50] to manifest himself through. That's why
[1:10:53] you're here. And so he gave you an
[1:10:56] evidence by a message, a token in the
[1:10:58] end time that you would carry that token
[1:11:01] with you. It's token time, which was a
[1:11:05] the token of course was the shedding of
[1:11:07] the Passover lamb.
[1:11:09] And so the a sign is a flashing red
[1:11:13] light. A sign is a warning and a token
[1:11:17] is a sign.
[1:11:20] There are many signs that are taking
[1:11:23] place.
[1:11:26] God's time piece.
[1:11:28] I notice once in a while people look at
[1:11:31] their watch while they're in church. And
[1:11:33] I do also. Uh I'm glad this church
[1:11:36] hasn't put a big clock at the back. That
[1:11:38] would be rather unnerving for me. But
[1:11:42] anyway, I have been lots of churches
[1:11:45] that have a big clock at the back. Uh,
[1:11:48] and uh, and I can say that there isn't
[1:11:51] anyone here, unless they're too small to
[1:11:54] read one or too young to read a watch,
[1:11:57] that doesn't look at their watch many
[1:11:59] times in the day. And if you didn't look
[1:12:01] at your watch, you'd be rather
[1:12:04] uninformed
[1:12:06] about what is happening. You wouldn't
[1:12:08] know whether you missed appointment,
[1:12:09] whether you're early, whether you're
[1:12:11] late. There's a lot of things that you
[1:12:13] would be ignorant of if you didn't look
[1:12:15] at your watch. I want to say something
[1:12:18] not to be uh
[1:12:24] not to be critical but I am really
[1:12:28] astounded
[1:12:30] at ministers in this message
[1:12:33] who are satisfied to remain ignorant
[1:12:37] about looking and refuse to look at
[1:12:40] God's time piece which their prophet who
[1:12:43] they say they love and they hear and
[1:12:45] they listen to says that Israel is God's
[1:12:49] time piece
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; and well they haven't got any time
[1:12:52] Israel you know and I've even heard
[1:12:54] comments they don't wonder what in the
[1:12:56] world that brother Biscll is doing
[1:12:58] having anything to do with the Jewish
[1:12:59] people
[1:13:02] excuse me
[1:13:05] where are you coming from
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; do you read the same message I read
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; this is the nation that is God's time
[1:13:13] peace and I think that we need to on a
[1:13:16] regular basis. Have a look at it and see
[1:13:18] where we are.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that you
[1:13:25] say that.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; It gives me a a a warm feeling because
[1:13:33] you don't know some of the criticism
[1:13:35] which perhaps I face as I don't tell you
[1:13:38] about it.
[1:13:40] But many times it's just incredible.
[1:13:42] Absolutely unbelievable
[1:13:46] that people within the message are
[1:13:49] satisfied to remain absolutely
[1:13:52] ignorant about what is happening within
[1:13:56] Israel.
[1:14:01] He was asked a question way early
[1:14:04] in 53. Do you believe that the Jews
[1:14:07] return to Palestine is a fulfillment of
[1:14:09] Bible prophecy? said, ' If you want to
[1:14:12] see what time of the year it is, now
[1:14:15] don't think that you know just exactly
[1:14:16] what these quotes are because I want to
[1:14:18] emphasize some very important things in
[1:14:22] light of what's happening even now. If
[1:14:25] you want to see what time of the year it
[1:14:27] is, look on the calendar. If you want to
[1:14:30] see what time of night it is, look at
[1:14:32] the clock. If you want to see what day
[1:14:35] you're living in, look where the Jews
[1:14:39] are.
[1:14:40] didn't only just say look at Israel but
[1:14:43] look where the Jews are.
[1:14:47] It's God's time piece.
[1:14:50] In the mark of the beast
[1:14:53] talks about the hearts that he hardened
[1:14:56] Hitler's heart, Mussolini's heart,
[1:15:00] Stalin's heart, all the different hearts
[1:15:03] of the nation. Now we are a
[1:15:06] multinational
[1:15:08] congregation here and yet I want to be
[1:15:11] very very quick to announce to everybody
[1:15:14] in the under the sound of my voice that
[1:15:17] we are actually one nation
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and we need to we need to for the sake
[1:15:23] of our spiritual life forget
[1:15:26] that we are American,
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; forget that we are Canadian. forget that
[1:15:32] we are British or that we are German or
[1:15:34] we are Russian or we are congalles or we
[1:15:37] are French or we are whatever we are we
[1:15:40] are a holy nation separated to God
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; and what the world has done what the
[1:15:47] world has done what evil men have done
[1:15:50] that's up to them
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make some references to the
[1:15:55] Holocaust and what is happening right
[1:15:58] now but I want our our people from
[1:16:01] Europe and our people from Germany and
[1:16:05] perhaps from Poland so on. I'm from the
[1:16:07] Ukraine
[1:16:08] and during the Second World War when the
[1:16:13] Nazi forces were moving at such a pace
[1:16:16] they were not able to fulfill their plan
[1:16:20] of genocide of the Jewish nation. And so
[1:16:24] they employed the people uh the police
[1:16:28] captains and the police of the various
[1:16:30] nations to actually do a lot of the
[1:16:33] work. And I have a picture of a
[1:16:36] Ukrainian um a Ukrainian man with his
[1:16:39] gun uh shooting and executing some of
[1:16:42] the Jewish people. Well, he he's a
[1:16:45] Ukrainian. I'm full-blood Ukrainian.
[1:16:47] That doesn't affect me whatsoever. I
[1:16:50] have nothing to do with that demon
[1:16:52] spirit. absolutely nothing to do with
[1:16:54] it. And it doesn't bother me to say
[1:16:57] that's that's up to him and that's up to
[1:16:59] his leaders and that's up to those that
[1:17:01] gave him the authority to commit such
[1:17:04] atrocities. So it has nothing to do I
[1:17:07] want the congregation to know that has
[1:17:09] nothing to do with our people. It has
[1:17:12] nothing to do with the believers.
[1:17:14] Hallelujah. Some of the most blessed
[1:17:17] friends that I have are from Europe
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and from Germany and it has nothing to
[1:17:23] do with it. It it can't have nothing in
[1:17:25] our mind whatsoever. And I'm saying that
[1:17:28] because it's absolutely the truth. The
[1:17:31] scripture says that we are one nation
[1:17:33] and we have been born again by the
[1:17:36] spirit of God and God only ordained in
[1:17:40] fact is God ordained that you should be
[1:17:42] born where you were born because he
[1:17:45] wanted you there.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; You didn't plan it. God planned it.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Wherever you come from, wherever your
[1:17:52] background is, we'd say this is what God
[1:17:54] has done. God ordained it.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandt said concerning America,
[1:18:05] he said, "I'm identified with her glory
[1:18:07] and I'm identified with her shame. I'm
[1:18:10] identified with the shame. I'm
[1:18:13] identified with the shame of this own
[1:18:15] our own country, which I think so many
[1:18:18] of their things that twists me all up
[1:18:19] inside what they do." But nevertheless,
[1:18:22] God has us here to be a certain voice to
[1:18:26] be uh he he's got us here in his
[1:18:28] program. And all I'm interested in is
[1:18:30] seeing that we fulfill our place. Does
[1:18:33] the congregation understand what I'm
[1:18:35] saying?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; You say, "Amen."
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; So now the Jews are the calendar, God's
[1:18:41] calendar,
[1:18:47] God's time piece.
[1:18:52] He said, "If you want to see what day or
[1:18:54] month it is, look at the calendar. If
[1:18:57] you want to see what day in the season
[1:18:59] it is of the coming of the Lord, watch
[1:19:05] where Israel's setting."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Look where the Jews are in one
[1:19:13] place and then watch where Israel's
[1:19:16] setting, looking at God's clock.
[1:19:20] I found something that I thought was
[1:19:21] quite interesting. Not any big doctrine,
[1:19:25] but in the greatest battle ever fought.
[1:19:28] Now,
[1:19:29] 1962, now don't think I'm just going
[1:19:32] back, but 1962
[1:19:35] was uh I believe that was the time
[1:19:39] when Pope John the 23rd.
[1:19:45] Now, if you those of you like to do any
[1:19:47] research, I'm not expecting that you
[1:19:49] will, but if you want to do any
[1:19:51] research,
[1:19:53] I I have uh I have some comments about
[1:19:56] him here, but he was the one who called
[1:19:59] Vatican Council 2. There has only been
[1:20:02] 20 councils called in 2,000 years.
[1:20:07] So, it was a very significant, it was
[1:20:09] the most significant, only 20 called.
[1:20:12] That's when they called the hierarchy of
[1:20:14] that church together. Now, don't forget
[1:20:17] that your prophet of God said that that
[1:20:21] church was more dangerous than the
[1:20:25] nations with their shiny missiles in the
[1:20:28] silos.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; They've only had 20. and when they call
[1:20:32] it and he was a a remarkable person as a
[1:20:36] pope uh he initiated the gathering of
[1:20:42] the of the brethren back again. So now
[1:20:46] watch the sign 62. 63 the seals are
[1:20:51] open. 63 God releases a great revelation
[1:20:56] of himself in the opening of the word,
[1:21:00] the opening of the seals, the third pull
[1:21:03] of the prophet's ministry because it
[1:21:06] would take that to gather the bride. And
[1:21:09] he says, "And the bride is being united
[1:21:12] with the groom so that she can go in the
[1:21:16] rapture."
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, my brother, my sister, when you
[1:21:18] hear the message, it's not whether you
[1:21:21] wish to receive it or don't wish to
[1:21:22] receive it. If you are bride, you will
[1:21:24] receive it and you will be absolutely
[1:21:27] united with it. It isn't something that
[1:21:29] will go in one ear and out the other. It
[1:21:31] is something that will sink down into
[1:21:33] the deep recess of your heart and you
[1:21:36] will feel you'll feel a union with the
[1:21:39] word of God. It's an actual happening.
[1:21:41] You'll be united with the word and the
[1:21:45] word is the bridegroom Jesus Christ. And
[1:21:48] that is a sign that you're going.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You can't be disassociated with him. You
[1:21:54] can't just live a nonchalant life as far
[1:21:57] as the message is concerned and expect
[1:22:00] to that you're going to go in a rapture
[1:22:01] because one is tied to the other.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; In 1962 in the message
[1:22:09] greatest battle ever fought and I think
[1:22:11] it's it's appropriate.
[1:22:14] Are you following me?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I think it's appropriate to notice even
[1:22:20] what he preached.
[1:22:23] said, "Did you hear the news this
[1:22:24] morning, Mrs. Kennedy?" There's
[1:22:27] President Kennedy's wife, going to see
[1:22:30] the Pope and what the Pope said,
[1:22:34] all the religions of the world. And then
[1:22:36] he just breaks. Oh, well, maybe we get a
[1:22:40] little more of that next Sunday.
[1:22:44] But he made this statement, just part of
[1:22:46] a statement. all the religions of the
[1:22:48] world
[1:22:50] says. And in a a news item at that time
[1:22:54] on her way to India and Pakistan in
[1:22:57] 1962,
[1:22:59] the first lady stopped in Rome for a
[1:23:01] private audience with Pope John the 23rd
[1:23:06] where she dismissed interpreters
[1:23:09] and spoke in French with the pontiff and
[1:23:12] wore a long black silk dress reminiscent
[1:23:15] of the 17th century
[1:23:19] uh
[1:23:20] Spanish I guess dress at that time
[1:23:26] in 1962 also
[1:23:29] this is what is said about the and I
[1:23:32] want you to listen very very carefully
[1:23:34] because I won't read this again
[1:23:38] it is quite possible that in
[1:23:41] uh
[1:23:44] speaking of the Roman Catholic Church
[1:23:46] movement it is quite possible that in
[1:23:48] her the church's vision 1962's most
[1:23:53] faithful rendevous took place in the
[1:23:56] world's most famous church having lived
[1:23:59] for years in men's hearts and minds that
[1:24:03] event was the beginning of a revolution
[1:24:06] in Christianity
[1:24:08] the ancient faith whose 900 million
[1:24:12] adherence
[1:24:14] uh make it the world's largest religion
[1:24:16] and then they go on others are Islam and
[1:24:19] so on, Hinduism and so on. Pope John the
[1:24:22] 23rd
[1:24:24] who by convening the ecumenical council
[1:24:27] now the next time you're in the messages
[1:24:29] and you see brother Brandham refer to
[1:24:31] the ecumenical movement or the
[1:24:33] ecumenical council or the council of
[1:24:36] churches he's making a direct reference.
[1:24:38] Now there is also the world council of
[1:24:40] churches but that that is one and the
[1:24:43] same really. And so he says that the
[1:24:47] ecumenical council called, this is what
[1:24:50] was called Vatican 2, set in motion
[1:24:55] ideas and forces that will affect not
[1:25:00] merely Roman Catholics,
[1:25:02] not only Christians, but the whole
[1:25:06] world's ever expanding population
[1:25:12] long after some of the other things that
[1:25:15] were concerns at the time.
[1:25:19] So rare are these councils 20 in the
[1:25:22] last 2,000 years. And it says Pope John
[1:25:26] made the biggest individual imprint on
[1:25:28] the year by revolutions in Christianity.
[1:25:33] Uh but revolutions, I'm sorry, in
[1:25:35] Christianity are even rarer. The
[1:25:37] reformation, speaking now of Luther,
[1:25:39] they make direct reference back to
[1:25:42] Luther. Reformations.
[1:25:46] The Reformation was 400 years ago. And
[1:25:49] John's historic mission is fired by a
[1:25:53] desire to endow the Christian faith with
[1:25:57] a new Pentecost,
[1:25:59] a new spirit. It is aimed not only at
[1:26:03] bringing the mother church of
[1:26:05] Christendom into closer touch with the
[1:26:09] modern world but at ending the divisions
[1:26:13] that has dis uh dissipated the
[1:26:16] Christians message for four centuries
[1:26:21] now. That's what was set in motion.
[1:26:24] That's what he was I would say inspired
[1:26:28] to do. And friends, since that time,
[1:26:33] since that time it has moved in that
[1:26:36] direction.
[1:26:42] Just looking at 40 years for a moment.
[1:26:47] Now we go. That was 1962,
[1:26:51] 63, 64,
[1:26:54] 204. Now we're at to 205.
[1:26:59] on the 6th of this month.
[1:27:02] Now we take a quantum leap
[1:27:06] of little over 40 years, a generation
[1:27:09] and the Bible.
[1:27:11] January the 6th.
[1:27:18] This is on behalf of the Italian Prime
[1:27:21] Minister's Office.
[1:27:25] The pope invokes peace with 160 rabbis
[1:27:31] in the Vatican.
[1:27:36] Vatican City.
[1:27:38] emotional meeting began or between Pope
[1:27:42] Paul II and 160 rabbis from the the Pave
[1:27:48] the Way foundation
[1:27:51] given an audience gives given an
[1:27:53] audience for the first time.
[1:27:56] The Pope greeted them with warmth
[1:28:00] in reply to the triple which they
[1:28:04] 160 rabbis
[1:28:07] said the triple. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:28:10] Thank you. Is it the trinity?
[1:28:14] And the triple. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom.
[1:28:18] offered to him by Gary Kroo, president
[1:28:22] and founder of the Pave the Way, an
[1:28:24] organism that unites rabbis from all
[1:28:28] over the world. In his brief speech, the
[1:28:32] Pope reminded that this year will be the
[1:28:36] 40th anniversary of the declaration of
[1:28:39] the Council, Vatican Council 2.
[1:28:43] A prophet was screaming out
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; against this council
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; before it was even conceived.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And he said they will do it.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He said it may sound strange in the
[1:28:57] church ages towards the end. It may
[1:29:00] sound strange but he says and they will
[1:29:03] speaking of the mother harlot church.
[1:29:06] They will take control
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and they will at first they will suggest
[1:29:14] we have dialogue.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And in the first world council which
[1:29:20] began in 1948
[1:29:23] as just a uh infant organization.
[1:29:28] The Catholic Church had nothing to do
[1:29:30] with the Vatican had nothing to do with
[1:29:31] but they sent representatives
[1:29:34] as observers and that's what they were
[1:29:37] and they met every six years world
[1:29:39] council of churches they had an observer
[1:29:42] just every every time they were
[1:29:44] observing but from that from that
[1:29:48] observation in 1948 they actually took
[1:29:52] control of it until uh the power of that
[1:29:57] system which is the mother of them all
[1:30:00] began to dictate come back to mother
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; and now the pope is invoking peace to
[1:30:08] these people now I just there's
[1:30:10] something you have to please just pray
[1:30:12] that you know God will help us to get
[1:30:14] this out I don't want to delay the
[1:30:16] service but I but there's a a a a
[1:30:19] massive paradox which is happening right
[1:30:22] at this time and I just want to get it
[1:30:24] across to you but he said that
[1:30:28] uh the pope reminded
[1:30:30] reminded that this year will be the 40th
[1:30:32] anniversary of the declaration of the
[1:30:35] Vatican Council 2 and he wanted to
[1:30:37] underline how significantly
[1:30:40] uh contributed
[1:30:42] how it cons significantly contributed to
[1:30:45] dialogue between the Jewish people and
[1:30:48] Catholics. Here a prophet declares that
[1:30:53] they will come together that they will
[1:30:56] not only have dialogue but they will
[1:30:58] come into an agreement. They will come
[1:31:00] into a union.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't happen just overnight. But
[1:31:05] you brothers, you could carry on doing
[1:31:07] your everyday work, but you do need to
[1:31:10] know. We need to know where the Jews are
[1:31:12] at this time.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; What is it that they're doing at this
[1:31:16] time? because it ought to send shivers
[1:31:19] down into our spine and into our soul to
[1:31:22] think the hour that we're living in.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; While you're having your daily meal and
[1:31:27] having your daily responsibilities,
[1:31:29] these things are moving and the world
[1:31:31] continues as it is, as it was, as it
[1:31:35] were. But nevertheless, God's word
[1:31:38] continues to be uh to to be fulfilled.
[1:31:42] It just keeps rolling, steamrolling on.
[1:31:45] Hallelujah. One event after another,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; nations rise, nation falls, agreements
[1:31:51] are made, agreements fail, uh men rise,
[1:31:55] men pass away, but the word of God
[1:31:58] abides forever.
[1:32:03] And he wanted to wanted them to know how
[1:32:07] significant this Vatican council to
[1:32:11] 40 years ago was so important between
[1:32:14] the Jewish people and the Catholics. And
[1:32:17] he expressed
[1:32:19] that this be an occasion to renew the
[1:32:22] effort and increase the understanding
[1:32:25] and cooperation in the service to build
[1:32:28] a more solid world based on respect for
[1:32:31] the divine image in every human being.
[1:32:35] He also invoked on members of the
[1:32:38] foundation that reunites that reunites
[1:32:42] rabbis in the world to abundant
[1:32:44] blessing. the abundant blessing almighty
[1:32:48] and the gift of peace.
[1:32:52] I tell you what,
[1:32:55] he's placing himself in a position to
[1:32:57] bless
[1:32:59] even those people.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, that which God has
[1:33:06] cursed
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; is trying to bless God's people
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; or a representation of God's people.
[1:33:18] One of the things that made
[1:33:21] has made just now and this was announced
[1:33:23] on the 7th of January.
[1:33:28] One of the greatest
[1:33:30] of the Jewish
[1:33:33] uh sages and theologians.
[1:33:40] He his name was Mo Moses or they would
[1:33:43] say Moa
[1:33:46] Mammonites.
[1:33:49] Mammones. He was Spanish
[1:33:52] but Rabbi Richmond for example refers to
[1:33:55] him all the time.
[1:33:57] And the Vatican will loan
[1:34:00] the works of Moses Mammonades,
[1:34:03] one of Judaism's most celebrated rabbis
[1:34:07] and sages to Israel this year is in a
[1:34:11] gesture meant to improve relations
[1:34:14] between Catholics and Jews. Can you
[1:34:17] believe
[1:34:18] this system?
[1:34:22] this harlot system
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; has the most treasured manuscripts
[1:34:30] of the Jewish people
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and are for the first time in history
[1:34:35] are going to allow them to see them
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; and they have they have no belief in the
[1:34:43] Jewish belief.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; They have resisted it for 2,000 years
[1:34:48] but hold those things almost like an ace
[1:34:51] card.
[1:34:52] and now are going to allow them to see
[1:34:54] nine manuscripts or six manuscripts and
[1:34:58] to show that they
[1:35:01] uh that uh that they are they want to
[1:35:06] strengthen they say which will
[1:35:10] strengthen
[1:35:11] the bonds between the Jews and
[1:35:14] Christians
[1:35:17] and the delegation this delegation of
[1:35:20] 160 rabbis eyes worldwide
[1:35:24] will meet the Pope John Paul II this
[1:35:27] month to thank him for his goodwill,
[1:35:32] including working out an agreement to
[1:35:35] display the priceless Jewish artifacts
[1:35:40] for the first time in Israel.
[1:35:46] Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jesus said,
[1:35:51] which klest the prophets and stoneest
[1:35:53] them that are sent unto thee. How often
[1:35:56] would I have gathered thy children
[1:35:59] together as a hen doth gather her brood
[1:36:02] under her wings, and you would not
[1:36:05] listen close. Behold, your house is left
[1:36:09] to you desolate.
[1:36:12] And verily I say unto you, you shall not
[1:36:15] see me. I'd like to break this down.
[1:36:19] I'd like to preach
[1:36:22] on a subject, a desolate house.
[1:36:26] But you wouldn't be able to stand it. If
[1:36:29] I were to show you a desolate house, I
[1:36:32] would show you what happened to the
[1:36:33] Jewish people as a people.
[1:36:37] They're suffering
[1:36:40] not only by one nation or two nations or
[1:36:42] three nations. It has been from the
[1:36:45] Inquisition
[1:36:47] and into France and into Europe and into
[1:36:51] Russia and into Germany and all over the
[1:36:53] world. They have been because they their
[1:36:57] name is associated with the testimony of
[1:37:00] the word of God. And the souls under the
[1:37:03] altar cried out, "How long? How long?"
[1:37:06] They had not it it they had not stood
[1:37:08] for the for the name of God. Brother
[1:37:10] Brandham says not for the name of God
[1:37:13] but for the word of God.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; They're responsible that the oracles of
[1:37:17] God have come down to us. In fact is the
[1:37:21] New Testament. As I said to one of my
[1:37:23] Jewish friends, Matthew a Jew, Luke a
[1:37:26] Jew, there's some question about that.
[1:37:28] Mark a Jew, John a Jew, Paul a Jew.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; All of them.
[1:37:35] I said to him, "You gave us the New
[1:37:37] Testament,
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; not just the Old. You gave us the New
[1:37:40] Testament.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; You're responsible." It was Jews that
[1:37:44] reported that Jesus Christ rose from the
[1:37:46] dead, not Gentiles. Jews reported it.
[1:37:49] Jews recorded it. Jews said it's a part
[1:37:52] of history.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Your house is left to you
[1:37:59] desolate." Right.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I have the pictures
[1:38:10] on the 27th this coming week.
[1:38:14] Thursday
[1:38:16] is the 60th anniversary
[1:38:21] of the liberation of Awitz.
[1:38:28] All through Europe, Eastern Europe, all
[1:38:30] over Europe,
[1:38:32] I have a map that identifies over 1,000
[1:38:37] killing locations.
[1:38:40] Over 1,000.
[1:38:43] I have also
[1:38:45] one of the official reports.
[1:38:50] Just this one single report reports the
[1:38:54] location of the town, how many were
[1:38:56] slain
[1:38:58] and at the bottom they total up 363,000
[1:39:02] I believe 211.
[1:39:05] The military
[1:39:07] hierarchy was reporting
[1:39:10] to their seniors
[1:39:12] how many they had slain
[1:39:15] in those places.
[1:39:18] Now it's not even within the human
[1:39:21] capacity of our minds to grasp what
[1:39:26] could possess
[1:39:28] a leader Hitler himself or Stalin
[1:39:31] whatever. Now we talk about the
[1:39:33] Holocaust. Let me just tell you friends,
[1:39:37] there were more Ukrainians
[1:39:41] more Ukrainians were starved to death
[1:39:45] by stalling than died of the Jewish
[1:39:48] people of the six million in in Europe.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; But you never hear about it. You never
[1:39:55] hear about it because they don't have
[1:39:56] the same drive. They don't have the same
[1:39:58] capacity. They don't have and why I
[1:40:01] would say because they are not
[1:40:02] responsible for having brought the word
[1:40:05] to the world. That's why the world
[1:40:07] they're hated of the world and because
[1:40:09] they had a rejection of Jesus Christ. He
[1:40:12] came to his own and his own received him
[1:40:14] not. And because Jesus said, "Your house
[1:40:17] is left to you desolate."
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And desolate means uninhabited.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You will not be identifiable as a people
[1:40:26] anymore.
[1:40:28] When Jesus just spoke that little phrase
[1:40:30] and how I spoke to you here not long
[1:40:32] ago, God doesn't have to say very much
[1:40:34] before it ripples out through all of
[1:40:36] history.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; And he just said, "Your house is left to
[1:40:40] you desolate and it's been 2,000 years
[1:40:43] of desolation, but in the end time I'll
[1:40:46] gather you back again. In the end time,
[1:40:49] I'll do certain things and no nation
[1:40:51] will be able to stop it.
[1:41:01] On this Thursday, the 27th,
[1:41:06] leaders from around the world are going
[1:41:10] to be gathering
[1:41:13] at a celebration
[1:41:15] of the liberation
[1:41:17] of those people.
[1:41:21] I wouldn't want to distract you, but I'd
[1:41:24] like you young people. I'd like you to
[1:41:27] have seen the pictures I have on my
[1:41:30] PowerPoint
[1:41:32] of the boys and girls
[1:41:35] behind the barb wire that managed to
[1:41:37] survive. They're some of the survivors
[1:41:41] in their strip uniforms.
[1:41:45] And I wouldn't show it in church,
[1:41:48] but they have the bodies stacked like
[1:41:51] just so much wood,
[1:41:55] piled high
[1:41:57] of bodies
[1:41:59] of men and women,
[1:42:01] mothers.
[1:42:04] I have the witness of one woman speaking
[1:42:07] in front of the camera
[1:42:10] who was taken and she had her child
[1:42:12] about three four year old girl and when
[1:42:16] she came the officer separated her from
[1:42:18] the child she went and stood over there
[1:42:19] and they shot her child right here in
[1:42:22] front of her.
[1:42:26] But while that was happening,
[1:42:30] the Pope
[1:42:32] in the Vatican knew it was happening. In
[1:42:36] fact is they proved that some of it was
[1:42:37] happening within 200 yards of the
[1:42:40] Vatican.
[1:42:42] But he was silent,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; never said a word. All that power.
[1:42:49] Furthermore,
[1:42:50] other nations
[1:42:52] also became aware. America become aware,
[1:42:57] Canada become aware, other nations
[1:42:59] become aware, but there was no voice
[1:43:03] raised up.
[1:43:05] No voice. They remained silent
[1:43:10] and never said anything.
[1:43:13] But 60 years down the road,
[1:43:17] they all are congregating there.
[1:43:21] dignitaries and monarchs. President
[1:43:24] Putin will be there. The armies of the
[1:43:28] Soviet Union arrived to Awitz first.
[1:43:32] And now there's going to be an intense
[1:43:34] celebration
[1:43:37] on Thursday.
[1:43:43] And of course you know
[1:43:47] that the Vatican must be represented
[1:43:51] because
[1:43:53] of this great force that is bringing
[1:43:56] about the unity. They must be
[1:43:59] represented.
[1:44:03] A harlot system
[1:44:06] that held their peace
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; now is going to celebrate while they
[1:44:11] held their peace back there. Now they're
[1:44:13] going to revel in the liberation.
[1:44:17] That's not the paradox. Are you
[1:44:18] listening to me?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Are you following my thought?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing it from a spiritual
[1:44:26] perspective?
[1:44:29] A prophet declared that they would that
[1:44:33] they would indeed bring this unifying
[1:44:36] force. This force is so powerful.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; It's a beast system.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; And so the Vatican is sending a
[1:44:51] cardinal.
[1:44:53] The cardinal happens to be Jewish.
[1:44:57] He was converted to Catholicism when he
[1:45:01] was 15.
[1:45:05] He has named
[1:45:07] Cardinal Jean Marie Lustiger of Paris as
[1:45:13] a special envoy
[1:45:16] to the commemoration of the 60th
[1:45:18] anniversary of the liberation of Awitz
[1:45:21] Burkanau death camp in Poland.
[1:45:27] and he is born in 1926 to a Jewish
[1:45:30] family
[1:45:32] of Polish origin.
[1:45:35] His mother was deported during the Nazi
[1:45:37] occupation and died in Awitz. A convert
[1:45:41] to Catholicism in 1940. He's a
[1:45:44] well-known of promoter a well-known
[1:45:46] promoter of dialogue between Catholics
[1:45:49] and Jews. About 10,000 people
[1:45:55] will attend on January the 27th.
[1:46:02] Former deportes from all over the world
[1:46:06] will be present, especially from Israel,
[1:46:09] Russia, Ukraine, Bellarus, and Hungary.
[1:46:12] And some 30s 30 countries will be
[1:46:15] represented at the ceremony.
[1:46:18] 14 heads of state
[1:46:21] from from Russia,
[1:46:25] from Israel,
[1:46:28] from Germany, from Poland and on and on.
[1:46:33] And two monarchs will attend.
[1:46:43] Here's the paradox.
[1:46:46] Massive paradox
[1:46:51] here. All these nations are gathering to
[1:46:54] celebrate
[1:46:56] that all these people were liberated.
[1:47:01] The world sat in their little enclave
[1:47:04] and said,
[1:47:06] "All right." They tried to go back to
[1:47:08] their own land and those same nations
[1:47:12] wouldn't allow them to go back
[1:47:15] and held them off the shores of their
[1:47:18] own land and sent them into another
[1:47:20] concentration camp. Right.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; I I need you to see that these people
[1:47:29] suffered not because
[1:47:33] they were bad people, but because they
[1:47:35] carried a certain testimony.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; They were accountable. They suffered
[1:47:40] just because they were born Jews.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; But they suffered also because it's
[1:47:48] written here
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; that it would be
[1:47:53] your house will be left to you desolate.
[1:47:58] I would like to
[1:48:00] I feel so
[1:48:03] exercised and so energized. I'm trying
[1:48:05] to contain myself. But if you could see
[1:48:07] the pictures that I have seen over the
[1:48:09] years and have in my files and on the
[1:48:15] one hand I would take the words of the
[1:48:17] son of man Jesus Christ and say show you
[1:48:22] a picture
[1:48:24] of utter desolation and say your house
[1:48:29] is left to you desolate. And then I
[1:48:31] could come over here quickly to the
[1:48:33] voice of the same son of man through his
[1:48:37] prophet messenger and say tender hand of
[1:48:42] Jehovah
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; and show you another slide and say your
[1:48:47] house is left to you desolate and on the
[1:48:51] same slide say tender hand of Jehovah
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; and you couldn't I had difficulty I
[1:48:58] looked at it myself
[1:49:01] and said, "Tender hand of Jehovah."
[1:49:06] Tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:49:10] And to look at those scenes, I could
[1:49:12] say, "Your house is left to you
[1:49:15] desolate."
[1:49:16] But it was hard to say, "Tender hand of
[1:49:21] Jehovah."
[1:49:22] to look at those emanciated bodies and
[1:49:25] say, "Tender hand of Jehovah,
[1:49:31] I was going to do it for you,
[1:49:34] but I didn't think it was appropriate."
[1:49:43] And the world went on
[1:49:46] as nothing happened.
[1:49:49] it continued on and say, "Oh, we're way
[1:49:52] back there." Yes, but let me tell you
[1:49:54] what's happening right at this very
[1:49:55] moment. Those same nations that will be
[1:49:57] gathered there at this present time,
[1:50:01] while they say, "Oh, we celebrate your
[1:50:04] liberation." Liberation to go where?
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Liberation to do what? I have no farm. I
[1:50:12] have no business. I have no family left.
[1:50:16] What have you liberated me to? to go
[1:50:18] where? We don't have a land. We don't
[1:50:21] have a place.
[1:50:27] Some of the survivors
[1:50:31] that just sit in front of a camera and
[1:50:33] it's called witness.
[1:50:35] They said one of the hardest things is
[1:50:37] when they were liberated, they went back
[1:50:39] to their towns in various places in in
[1:50:42] Poland.
[1:50:44] Some of them talking about going back in
[1:50:45] Poland and the town's people who've been
[1:50:47] their friends, who they went to school
[1:50:49] with and were raised with and worked
[1:50:51] with and were their associates and was
[1:50:53] their neighbors said to them they should
[1:50:56] have finished their job.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Said we couldn't believe that we weren't
[1:51:02] received home.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; This is our home. Because God has spoken
[1:51:08] through the mouths of Jesus Christ, your
[1:51:10] house has left you desolate,
[1:51:12] uninhabited. You have no place.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; I'll scatter you to the four winds. I'll
[1:51:19] scatter you to the four corners. And he
[1:51:21] did.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; But I'll come to the paradox. Those same
[1:51:25] nations are exercising all of the same
[1:51:29] demonic power upon that little homeland,
[1:51:33] saying, "Give it up.
[1:51:38] We set you free, but give up what you do
[1:51:41] have.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Don, do we just have that?
[1:52:06] I wanted just to show you
[1:52:10] just the land in relationship. You all
[1:52:12] know this, but I thought it would be
[1:52:15] perhaps fitting at this moment. And I'm
[1:52:17] not going to be much longer.
[1:52:25] Can we dim the lights, please?
[1:52:37] This is Egypt. The size of it, Jordan,
[1:52:42] Iraq,
[1:52:45] Syria, Lebanon,
[1:52:48] Saudi Arabia. There's Israel.
[1:52:52] 20,770
[1:52:54] square kilometers.
[1:52:58] They're saying give it up
[1:53:02] these nations
[1:53:04] that are there celebrating.
[1:53:11] I suppose trying to make a statement we
[1:53:13] had something to do with liberating you,
[1:53:17] sending you back.
[1:53:19] But at the same time, while the one
[1:53:22] event is happening, the other is also
[1:53:25] taking place.
[1:53:32] didn't shut it off. Thank you.
[1:53:35] When I was in Israel,
[1:53:38] I found that the people's hands were
[1:53:39] hanging down.
[1:53:42] And while we were there, there was a
[1:53:44] blast
[1:53:45] and two policemen were killed. Young men
[1:53:49] like you young men that are here. And
[1:53:52] the one policeman, he suspected the girl
[1:53:55] coming,
[1:53:57] had a pack sack on.
[1:54:00] He knows he's walking right to his
[1:54:02] death.
[1:54:03] He walked up to her and would before she
[1:54:07] could come to the bus waiting station
[1:54:11] and said, "Can I see your identification
[1:54:14] papers?" She became agitated,
[1:54:17] said, "Open up your bag." And when the
[1:54:20] other young policemen saw that he was
[1:54:22] having a little bit of difficulty, they
[1:54:24] expected trouble. And they know what
[1:54:25] happens every few days. So he ran up to
[1:54:28] be buddy to his friend and help him. And
[1:54:31] she blew herself up, killed him. And the
[1:54:34] other one was rushed to the hospital and
[1:54:35] he died as well.
[1:54:38] Say, "Well, this is
[1:54:41] rather gruesome."
[1:54:43] Let me tell you what, friends.
[1:54:47] I decided that today this congregation
[1:54:50] was going to have another look at the
[1:54:51] time clock
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; and that this congregation is going to
[1:54:57] see where the Jews are
[1:55:01] where they are right now. They're not
[1:55:04] merely a distressed nation,
[1:55:06] but they're almost being dispossessed
[1:55:08] again.
[1:55:10] And the whole world needs to turn
[1:55:12] against them. And the whole world has
[1:55:14] turned against them. And even within
[1:55:17] themselves, for the first time, they
[1:55:18] admit within themselves, they've got
[1:55:20] such division and strife within
[1:55:22] themselves. They've become enemies with
[1:55:24] one another. And Rabbi Richmond, whose
[1:55:27] young son, I was going to show him on
[1:55:29] the screen. They sent us a picture. He's
[1:55:32] he's on a special forces in the IDF, the
[1:55:34] Israeli Defense Forces.
[1:55:37] And they said that
[1:55:40] he's going to disobey the orders.
[1:55:43] And there's a lot of them. They just
[1:55:44] can't because they're of the initial
[1:55:47] spirit that gave the nation birth. We
[1:55:49] cannot
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; accept that we're going to tear our own
[1:55:53] people off of their own homes and
[1:55:55] they're going to destroy them. They're
[1:55:56] going to explode them and blow them up
[1:55:58] and bulldoze them down. Where people
[1:56:00] with their bare hands
[1:56:03] etched out a little bit of a life on the
[1:56:07] desert to claim and they what they
[1:56:09] believe is they believe what is in the
[1:56:11] scripture concerning that basin. They
[1:56:14] believe it and they're going to tear the
[1:56:16] believers off.
[1:56:18] Going to haul them out of their place
[1:56:20] and off of their own inheritance. I can
[1:56:24] tell you friends, we're at a very, very
[1:56:27] strange hour that we're in.
[1:56:30] And I don't know exactly how I heard it
[1:56:33] was one week ago tomorrow that I heard
[1:56:37] that this event was taking place.
[1:56:43] I let it rest for a day
[1:56:47] and then I said
[1:56:49] uh to my wife,
[1:56:53] I need to go to that celebration.
[1:57:01] I immediately began myself. I didn't ask
[1:57:03] anyone. I began to see if there's any
[1:57:07] possibility of flights
[1:57:10] and more impossible yet would be a room
[1:57:13] and I'll be very very quick with you.
[1:57:15] And I began to email I emailed the
[1:57:18] authorities and told them what we were
[1:57:22] and just a little bit in a few lines.
[1:57:24] Please help us if you can. I emailed
[1:57:28] into Israel to Colonel Yen Vered.
[1:57:32] Colonel Yen Vered had introduced me. I
[1:57:34] just want you to see some years ago to a
[1:57:37] man by the name of Ari Shibi.
[1:57:40] Ari Shibi was the head headman. He was
[1:57:42] the consul for the state of Israel's
[1:57:45] tour office of tourism in Toronto a few
[1:57:48] years ago
[1:57:51] just prior
[1:57:53] about two weeks ago has no connection to
[1:57:56] what I'm speaking to you and no
[1:57:57] connection with this celebration. I had
[1:57:59] gotten a call here at the office from
[1:58:02] the uh Department of Tourism for the for
[1:58:06] is government of Israel from Toronto and
[1:58:09] from a man by the name his his secretary
[1:58:11] Ellen was calling and said she'd like to
[1:58:14] make an appointment for the consul of
[1:58:18] tourism who's now in Toronto. His name
[1:58:20] is Danny Shahal. He's coming to
[1:58:23] Vancouver and he'd like to meet with uh
[1:58:26] Reverend Biscoll.
[1:58:28] would that be possible? That was this
[1:58:30] last Wednesday. So we said, well, yes,
[1:58:32] that will be possible. And they phoned
[1:58:35] back and said, are there some others?
[1:58:37] And I said, yes, we can have some others
[1:58:38] from the office and brother Tony and my
[1:58:41] brother Dier and so on, brother Tom and
[1:58:43] whoever is here. We'll just sit down
[1:58:45] with him and we don't know what he
[1:58:47] wants. So in the meantime, then this c
[1:58:51] this liberation anniversary came. So I
[1:58:55] called him. I had never talked to him. I
[1:58:56] called him. I said, "We need your help.
[1:58:59] I feel to go and I want to be there."
[1:59:03] And uh the website was not even
[1:59:05] accepting any more invitations. I called
[1:59:08] brother John Briner who has some
[1:59:10] connection with some publications and I
[1:59:12] said, "Can you get me a press ID so I
[1:59:15] can get up close to some of these
[1:59:17] events?"
[1:59:18] and uh uh and then when we went and
[1:59:21] discovered that that it had been closed,
[1:59:24] applications have been closed on the
[1:59:26] 10th of January. You haven't got any
[1:59:28] possibility. So, we heard that uh uh
[1:59:32] that the one hotel I called one of the
[1:59:35] head officers of the hotel. They said,
[1:59:36] "Well, has this got something to do with
[1:59:38] the celebration, the anniversary?" I
[1:59:41] said, "Yes, it does." So, they said,
[1:59:42] "Oh, then we can give you rooms." And I
[1:59:45] was so happy that we got rooms. and I
[1:59:47] got rooms that was going to take brother
[1:59:49] Michelle to do uh video and also brother
[1:59:53] Tony I felt it needed some help and so
[1:59:56] then they phoned back the next morning
[1:59:58] the same hotel and said you can't have
[2:00:00] the rooms because you are not you must
[2:00:04] you must submit a document that you're
[2:00:06] part of the official delegations
[2:00:08] and then I called Mr. Shahal back Danny
[2:00:13] Shahal and I said the head the head man
[2:00:16] is in Moscow. Uh will you phone him? And
[2:00:19] he said well uh he said okay if you want
[2:00:21] me to phone him I can try to phone him.
[2:00:24] And uh uh he didn't phone him. Tony
[2:00:26] phoned him and he didn't really want to
[2:00:28] even help us or talk to us and he did
[2:00:30] take our name but he said there's no
[2:00:32] possibility. So then I was led to the
[2:00:35] head of the Jewish Congress here in
[2:00:37] Vancouver and he says,"Well, we're
[2:00:39] having a meeting on Tuesday night. Can
[2:00:41] you come?" So we It was an information
[2:00:44] meeting, but it didn't have anything to
[2:00:45] do with this this c this celebration,
[2:00:48] this anniversary, but I he made me to
[2:00:50] believe that it was. It could have been
[2:00:51] my mistake. And we went and uh uh you
[2:00:55] know, we we we met some people and so on
[2:00:57] so forth, but they're not attending
[2:00:59] this. They're not part of this
[2:01:00] delegation in the meantime. And this now
[2:01:04] I just jumping back and forth that I
[2:01:05] hope you're able to follow with me. In
[2:01:08] the meantime,
[2:01:09] I was in I got email back and forth with
[2:01:12] Colonel Yen Vered. He said, "I've been
[2:01:13] in touch with Ari Shib and Ari Shib's
[2:01:16] very close friend. Ari Shibi has moved
[2:01:19] up now in the office of the tourism
[2:01:21] department for the state but his friend
[2:01:23] is actually the minister in the Chiron
[2:01:27] government and he is uh he's in charge
[2:01:30] of tourism for the state and so uh Ari
[2:01:35] Shibby when he was here something
[2:01:37] happened which I'll just explain to you
[2:01:39] now some of these things happen which we
[2:01:41] uh don't feel to say much about but he
[2:01:45] he called me it was after our trip to
[2:01:47] Israel the when 116 of us went and he
[2:01:51] called me he says I'm going to I'm I'm
[2:01:53] going to go to Vancouver and we're
[2:01:55] having maybe about 200 people and these
[2:01:58] are leaders and churches and pastors and
[2:02:00] so on I would like you to uh speak about
[2:02:03] your trip there so it was fine so he
[2:02:06] said just ask for me Ari Shibby when you
[2:02:08] come to the hotel bank banquet room and
[2:02:12] I walked in and the girls were there
[2:02:14] registering I said where's Mr.
[2:02:16] Aribby. He Oh, he says, "I'm Ari." And I
[2:02:19] said, "Well, I'm Pastor Bisco." And oh,
[2:02:21] he says, "Here, here, I'm I want you to
[2:02:23] sit at the head table with us." And uh
[2:02:26] so Tom and Joanne were there and and uh
[2:02:29] I he said, "You can bring it bring
[2:02:31] someone else if you want." And so we sat
[2:02:33] there uh at the head table and there was
[2:02:36] the head of LL Airlines and uh uh one of
[2:02:40] the senior executives from Air Canada
[2:02:42] and so on so forth.
[2:02:44] So then I got another call from him and
[2:02:46] he says, "I'm going to be in Vancouver."
[2:02:47] He said, "I'd like to just have lunch
[2:02:49] with you." So I went into Vancouver and
[2:02:51] I had lunch with Ari Shibby.
[2:02:54] And then some time went by and he called
[2:02:56] me again. He said, "I'm going to be in
[2:02:58] Vancouver." He said, "I just have a I'm
[2:03:01] going to be there for a short time, but
[2:03:02] could we have lunch together again?" I
[2:03:04] said, "Well, it'd be I'd be very happy
[2:03:07] if we can." So I went into Vancouver and
[2:03:09] it just the two of us. Now it was
[2:03:10] unofficial. Now, it was like a friendto
[2:03:13] friend basis. And I began to speak to
[2:03:16] him out of my heart
[2:03:19] about Israel.
[2:03:21] What God? and he looked across that
[2:03:23] little table and his eyes just become
[2:03:27] not filled with tears but his eyes
[2:03:30] became watery as I spoke to him of God's
[2:03:33] promise and our faith and our absolute
[2:03:37] irrevocable in assurance that God will
[2:03:40] keep his promise to Israel. He said,
[2:03:42] "You don't know what that does. You
[2:03:44] don't know what that means." He said,
[2:03:45] "You speak even like Jews don't speak."
[2:03:47] You know, he said something along that
[2:03:48] order.
[2:03:50] And he said, I I wanted to let you know
[2:03:52] I'm leaving Canada and I'm going back to
[2:03:54] Israel. Said, oh, but he said, you know,
[2:03:58] and now he became he came out. He began
[2:04:00] to speak out of his soul. He said, I I
[2:04:02] want to live in Jerusalem. Oh, I just
[2:04:05] want to live in Jerusalem. My wife wants
[2:04:06] to live in Tel Aviv, but I want to live
[2:04:09] in Jerusalem.
[2:04:12] And uh he moved to Jerusalem, but I
[2:04:15] didn't know he went higher up in the
[2:04:17] department. And here we are these years
[2:04:20] later
[2:04:22] and Colonel Yenv who's a very close
[2:04:24] friend of his called him and now he's a
[2:04:27] close friend with the minister in within
[2:04:29] the government and the minister in the
[2:04:31] government called the embassy in Warsaw
[2:04:35] who's his name is Yasi that consulate is
[2:04:38] Yasi Levy and said these people they
[2:04:42] they need some assistance when you get
[2:04:44] there they want to travel there and he
[2:04:47] called uh a doctor Rousk
[2:04:51] who is a he's a excuse me a director of
[2:04:56] the Judeica Foundation in Krakow and
[2:04:59] said these people are friends of Israel
[2:05:03] and we we need we need you to meet them
[2:05:07] to help them and to put them in contact
[2:05:09] with survivors and he said I'd just be
[2:05:12] more than delighted to do that and then
[2:05:14] he emailed me and I emailed him back and
[2:05:17] that is all of that happened within
[2:05:20] about 3 days
[2:05:22] and I thought that the congregation
[2:05:24] should know I wasn't going to say
[2:05:25] anything to I decided I wouldn't say
[2:05:27] anything and I had the rest of my
[2:05:29] subject from last Sunday to speak and I
[2:05:31] felt so compelled that we need to look
[2:05:34] at the time piece we need to have a look
[2:05:37] and I felt so burdened for so many in
[2:05:39] the message that don't look at but
[2:05:42] listen friends whether whatever you
[2:05:44] think about me is irrelevant But I feel
[2:05:47] that that's the mission.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's one of the mission of this
[2:05:51] congregation
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; is to hold forth this message to whoever
[2:05:56] whoever God sends before you or whoever
[2:06:01] God puts in contact with me. I believe
[2:06:04] we need to hold forth this message
[2:06:05] before them. And so what the rest of
[2:06:07] this next week, we're going to go out uh
[2:06:10] tonight and we'll be there this week and
[2:06:14] then brother Andrew Novakowski.
[2:06:18] He said, "A friend of mine has become a
[2:06:21] mayor of a city nearby."
[2:06:24] And he contacted him and the mayor of
[2:06:28] that city.
[2:06:29] Uh
[2:06:31] he said, "Brother Andrew said, this is
[2:06:33] my pastor and he's taking some
[2:06:35] associates. They need to be there. They
[2:06:37] need to have some official status so
[2:06:40] they can get in." And that man when I
[2:06:44] walked into the church this morning,
[2:06:46] they have a they have a small delegation
[2:06:49] of about six or seven people and he's
[2:06:52] requiring that at least one of them give
[2:06:55] up their invitation for the official
[2:06:59] status and that they give it to myself.
[2:07:02] And I tell you what, I don't know if I
[2:07:04] want to do that to that person.
[2:07:06] But that that was just in fact as
[2:07:09] brother Andrews just been interpreting
[2:07:11] it, translating it. That and that
[2:07:13] invitation just came on the facts when I
[2:07:16] came into church this morning. You say,
[2:07:19] "What is God doing?" I don't know. But I
[2:07:21] can tell you one thing. God has put us
[2:07:24] very close to what our prophet said was
[2:07:28] God's time piece. And quite frankly, I'm
[2:07:32] quite happy to be close to the watch.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Quite happy. I'm quite happy to be
[2:07:38] having another look at the clock.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; And I'm quite pleased because it just
[2:07:43] tells me, it tells me that he won't
[2:07:46] leave us alone. He won't leave us on uh
[2:07:49] uh he he won't leave us in ignorance.
[2:07:51] And as brother Brandham said to the
[2:07:53] people, I he wanted the people to be
[2:07:55] informed. And I feel that that's the
[2:07:58] very least that I can do. And I hope
[2:08:00] that you're able to understand. I think
[2:08:02] that God has just given us the right
[2:08:04] kind of people. We became so concerned
[2:08:06] about security. They said that uh
[2:08:09] there's going to be 3,000 extra police
[2:08:12] that have been employed to handle the
[2:08:16] security for all of these dignitaries
[2:08:19] and these uh heads of state. And I felt,
[2:08:24] well, we got a staff sergeant of the
[2:08:27] RCMP here in the congregation. Let's use
[2:08:29] him.
[2:08:32] Not like that. Brother Sean, we
[2:08:34] appreciate Everybody has a a place. I
[2:08:37] said to Brother Shawn, can you give me a
[2:08:40] letter?
[2:08:42] Can you give me I wanted to have it on
[2:08:44] RCMP.
[2:08:46] I haven't read it yet, but he wrote it
[2:08:49] to me and handed it here. I might have
[2:08:51] to use that. Brother Sean, carry that
[2:08:54] right in front of me. Say, I've already
[2:08:56] got some clearance
[2:08:58] from someone in good standing.
[2:09:01] I expect, I don't know, we might just
[2:09:04] come back and say all the doors were
[2:09:07] shut. But I can tell you one thing, God
[2:09:10] was in control, is in control, and will
[2:09:13] be in control. And I felt I needed to
[2:09:15] ask you for your prayers
[2:09:18] such as never before.
[2:09:20] We don't know who we're to speak to. But
[2:09:22] I became very conscious.
[2:09:25] So these survivors, some that have
[2:09:27] survived, they're not going to be here
[2:09:30] in just a very short time. They won't
[2:09:32] live probably for another celebration of
[2:09:35] any kind. And when I begin to see
[2:09:41] I don't know, friends, brother Brandham
[2:09:43] said God's in nature. Can I have just
[2:09:45] about two minutes? Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And this may not have any relationship
[2:09:50] whatsoever. I wouldn't make a doctrine
[2:09:52] out of this. And I hope the people on
[2:09:54] the internet understand.
[2:09:59] The scripture says that God has no
[2:10:01] pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[2:10:04] But nevertheless, the wicked do perish.
[2:10:08] And good people perish.
[2:10:13] But I I just couldn't help but put a
[2:10:17] couple things together.
[2:10:20] 40 years
[2:10:22] 40 years since this great mo monstrous
[2:10:28] organization called the Vatican
[2:10:32] who was silent silent
[2:10:35] while they piled the bodies like
[2:10:38] cordwood
[2:10:40] and never said a word. And now they're
[2:10:43] going to be there to at this great
[2:10:46] celebration
[2:10:48] and not enough to stick the dagger in,
[2:10:50] but now twist it. We'll send a Jew
[2:10:54] who has become a Catholic to represent
[2:10:57] us. We'll twist the dagger and show you
[2:11:01] that one of your own has come to the top
[2:11:04] within the system.
[2:11:08] And then while the world is
[2:11:10] commemorating
[2:11:12] a pagan
[2:11:14] Christmas
[2:11:16] celebration
[2:11:18] in the world
[2:11:20] 40 years
[2:11:23] from an earthquake that Elijah had
[2:11:25] fortold would happen. 40 years later God
[2:11:30] rocks and vibrates the whole earth. And
[2:11:33] while they're celebrating the liberation
[2:11:36] and the stacking of those corpses, on
[2:11:38] the other side of the world, they're
[2:11:40] stacking corpses
[2:11:42] by the thousands. And Indonesia just
[2:11:45] said the 70some thousand that we have as
[2:11:49] missing, we have put to the
[2:11:52] list of those dead, putting the total up
[2:11:56] around 220ome
[2:11:59] thousand that are gone. And the whole
[2:12:02] world is all tsunami humanitarian aid.
[2:12:06] The whole world the whole world
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; and that whole world remains silent.
[2:12:14] What a paradox. I can't I are are you
[2:12:17] thinking are you following my thought
[2:12:19] here? They are over there celebrating
[2:12:21] you. You were free 60 years ago while
[2:12:25] corpses were being. Why don't they
[2:12:28] repent
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; and said, "We repent for our silence.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; We grieve for our silence.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; You've suffered enormously. What can we
[2:12:39] do for you now? Take away your land?
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Can we help you?"
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; No, it can't be because your prophet
[2:12:50] declared, "Every
[2:12:52] government is of the devil. That's
[2:12:56] right.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; And they can't be loyal to God's promise
[2:13:01] and God's word.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; And while those nations did not and
[2:13:06] refuse to hear their cry, God said, "I
[2:13:11] have heard their cry."
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what that's what moved me.
[2:13:17] That's what inspired me. I said, "God
[2:13:20] heard their cry. The man did not hear
[2:13:22] their cry, but God heard their cry." And
[2:13:26] God said, "I have come down to deliver
[2:13:29] them."
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's uniting time, my
[2:13:32] brother, my sister. Nations are uniting.
[2:13:35] And that great harlot system is uniting
[2:13:38] her daughters together. And na and
[2:13:40] Israel's back in her homeland. We see
[2:13:42] that. Oh, we've heard that years ago,
[2:13:45] but we never had ever in history 160
[2:13:48] rabbis coming back to the mother church
[2:13:52] and and and tell them thanks.
[2:13:55] Thanks for what?
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Thanks because you held your peace.
[2:13:59] Thanks because you allowed millions of
[2:14:01] us to be slaughtered. Thanks for what?
[2:14:04] Thanks that you're giving us some
[2:14:05] scrolls that belong to us in the first
[2:14:07] place. Thanks because you've got our
[2:14:10] artifacts that you stole out of our
[2:14:12] temple.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Wretched thieves.
[2:14:16] [Applause]
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Wretched they are. And God's going to
[2:14:20] destroy her.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; And the Holocaust will be kindergarten
[2:14:26] stuff to what's going to happen to her.
[2:14:29] And the angels of God and the sons and
[2:14:31] daughters of God are going to rejoice
[2:14:34] when this wickedness is done with.
[2:14:38] It's going to happen.
[2:14:39] [Applause]
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen exactly as the word
[2:14:44] of God has said. So,
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; you believe it?
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in thanksgiving.
[2:14:56] Father,
[2:14:58] we're filled with thanksgiving that you
[2:14:59] have given us such a word.
[2:15:03] Yet, you have made it so quickened to
[2:15:05] us. Lord, I don't even know what's
[2:15:07] happening. things are happening. It's
[2:15:09] taking place so quickly and thoughts are
[2:15:11] passing through my mind. Events and your
[2:15:14] prophet said, "You watch nature and
[2:15:16] we're watching it." And you watch this
[2:15:18] and we're watching it. We're watching
[2:15:19] the events and we're watching it in the
[2:15:21] light of the word that you sent. Lord,
[2:15:24] you've given us a church full of people
[2:15:25] here today. And I pray that each one of
[2:15:28] them will be nipped with the vision, oh
[2:15:30] God, that you have given. Not my vision,
[2:15:32] but the vision that comes from the
[2:15:34] message of the hour. Oh Lord, let us not
[2:15:37] be satisfied to live out our little
[2:15:39] lives in a comfort zone. But may we come
[2:15:42] forward and say, "Oh God, use me.
[2:15:45] Whatever I can do for you and for the
[2:15:47] kingdom of God, use me. Use our
[2:15:50] resources. Use our energy. Use our
[2:15:52] life." Lord Jesus, as I felt this
[2:15:55] morning in prayer to offer this
[2:15:58] congregation
[2:16:00] and myself in a new dedication
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; as a sacrifice.
[2:16:06] Will you receive the sacrifice? Lord,
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; we offer ourselves.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Let us all stand.
[2:16:13] And if you feel that way in your heart,
[2:16:16] say, "Lord, my life, whatever value
[2:16:19] there is to it, I want to offer it as a
[2:16:22] sacrifice. May it be a sweet smelling
[2:16:25] savor in your nostrils, I offer it as a
[2:16:28] sacrifice to you right now. And I'm
[2:16:31] seeking to realize the hour that we're
[2:16:33] living in. Oh God, help me to catch what
[2:16:36] has been spoken today. Let it be a
[2:16:39] reality to me, oh God. Oh, Father, the
[2:16:43] signs are all around us. The signs are
[2:16:47] everywhere. Truly, nations are breaking
[2:16:50] and Israel's awakening. These are the
[2:16:53] times that the prophets are foretold.
[2:16:55] Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll take and
[2:16:58] illuminate every heart, illuminate every
[2:17:01] mind.
[2:17:04] May we be so conscious throughout this
[2:17:06] day, oh God,
[2:17:08] as our brother Lance comes this evening,
[2:17:10] Father,
[2:17:11] anxious to hear your word, Lord, what
[2:17:14] you've laid on his heart over these
[2:17:17] weeks.
[2:17:18] Oh God, we need to hear from your
[2:17:21] throne. We need to constantly be moved
[2:17:26] and moving by the fulfillment of your
[2:17:29] word.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll bless all
[2:17:33] that are within the sound of my voice
[2:17:34] today, the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:39] Amen.
[2:17:49] Nations
[2:17:51] are breaking.
[2:17:53] Israel
[2:17:55] awaking.
[2:17:57] The signs that the prophets
[2:18:01] foretold.
[2:18:05] The Gentiles
[2:18:07] days number
[2:18:09] with horrors
[2:18:11] and cumber.
[2:18:13] Eternity
[2:18:15] soon will unfold.
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:21] The day of redemption
[2:18:25] is here.
[2:18:28] Men's hearts
[2:18:30] are fed
[2:18:36] [Music]
[2:18:38] with the spirit.
[2:18:40] Your laps trained and clean.
[2:18:45] Look up. Your redemption is near. The
[2:18:50] course once again.
[2:18:52] The day of redemption
[2:18:57] is near.
[2:19:00] Men's hearts
[2:19:02] are failing for fear.
[2:19:07] Oh, be filled with the spirit. Your
[2:19:12] laugh and clear.
[2:19:17] Look up. Your redemption is here. Oh,
[2:19:24] the day of redemption is here.
[2:19:30] Hallelujah.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Men's hearts
[2:19:34] are failing
[2:19:36] for fear,
[2:19:39] but be filled with the spirit. Your lamp
[2:19:44] send.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, look up. Your redemption
[2:19:52] is
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; And I say to this congregation in the
[2:19:55] name of the Lord, look up.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Your redemption isn't only near. is
[2:19:59] here.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Your redemption is here.
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; And life went on.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; But don't forget what was spoken today.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; You'll go to work. You'll go to your
[2:20:14] places of responsibility, but don't
[2:20:16] forget where the Jew is.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; You'll go to school, but don't forget
[2:20:24] they were going to school when these
[2:20:25] great signs were taking place.
[2:20:30] They were having further education. They
[2:20:33] were having church services. They were
[2:20:35] feeling the spirit and the anointing and
[2:20:37] all these kind of things. Right? While
[2:20:38] God was sending his great signs upon the
[2:20:42] earth, I say to your church, don't be
[2:20:46] don't be in darkness. Don't be ignorant
[2:20:50] concerning these great things that are
[2:20:52] happening. And I believe as we look to
[2:20:54] the nature and as we look to Israel and
[2:20:58] as we look to what's happening in the
[2:20:59] bride of Jesus Christ, all I can say it
[2:21:04] must be the time for us to look up. Our
[2:21:07] redemption is even nearer than it's ever
[2:21:10] been before.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; So what if it goes on? So what if it
[2:21:14] does? People lived their life out while
[2:21:18] the signs were happening and they fell
[2:21:21] like rats. They fell like just animals.
[2:21:25] They felt like just flesh in the fields.
[2:21:30] But the believer,
[2:21:32] there's some that died in the faith.
[2:21:36] And the scripture says those that are
[2:21:40] asleep in Christ
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; shall awake.
[2:21:46] Hallelujah.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If I never come behind
[2:21:50] this pulpit again, I want to declare in
[2:21:52] the name of Jesus Christ by his grace,
[2:21:55] the amazing grace which the girls, the
[2:21:57] sisters sang about by us unmarited
[2:22:00] favor. But we're not worthy. I'm not
[2:22:02] worthy to even be called a servant or a
[2:22:05] son of God. But by his grace, he elected
[2:22:08] it.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; And that's the only thing I can stand on
[2:22:11] is his election. Amen.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; He chose it.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; He chose you.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; The day of redemption is right here upon
[2:22:23] us.
[2:22:26] The day of redemption
[2:22:31] is near.
[2:22:35] Men's hearts
[2:22:37] are failing for me.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, be filled with the spirit
[2:22:47] [Music]
[2:22:48] and clear.
[2:22:52] Look out, your redemption
[2:22:56] is near.
[2:22:58] Let's offer ourselves. I wonder, Linda,
[2:23:01] if we could sing All That I Have.
[2:23:04] all that I ever will be.
[2:23:10] You might want to raise your hand,
[2:23:13] represent what's in your heart,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; just in sweetness to him now. And we'll
[2:23:21] close
[2:23:23] all that
[2:23:29] All
[2:23:31] I am
[2:23:34] all
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:23:49] the
[2:23:55] I
[2:23:57] surrender
[2:23:59] Our
[2:24:00] [Music]
[2:24:05] blessed father
[2:24:08] God,
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:11] by your grace we stand here.
[2:24:14] By your grace we have been
[2:24:17] gathered and united
[2:24:20] to yourself.
[2:24:23] By your calling,
[2:24:25] by your predestination,
[2:24:29] by your predestination and by your own
[2:24:31] calling, we have been justified
[2:24:35] and sanctification. Lord, you have set
[2:24:37] our mind in order for sanctification.
[2:24:41] You have sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[2:24:44] promise
[2:24:46] each of your own, each of us that stand
[2:24:49] here today.
[2:24:51] You're the one that baptizes with the
[2:24:54] Holy Ghost and with fire.
[2:24:57] Continue to move in each of our lives.
[2:25:00] Oh Lord, continue to move upon the
[2:25:03] heart,
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; upon all who are now under the sound of
[2:25:09] my own voice. Lord, wherever they may
[2:25:13] be, whatever country they might be. But
[2:25:16] for us that stand here today, oh Lord,
[2:25:18] we're just setting aside this entire
[2:25:21] day,
[2:25:23] making ourselves ready, oh God, for what
[2:25:26] further you would say to us this
[2:25:30] evening. Refresh us, Lord. And Lord, we
[2:25:33] sang all that I have and all that I am.
[2:25:37] From our heart,
[2:25:39] take us, oh God. There's nothing in this
[2:25:42] world worth serving. There's nothing in
[2:25:45] this world worth living for, but we give
[2:25:47] it to you now unreservedly.
[2:25:50] I ask your blessing upon each one and
[2:25:53] dismiss us now in the grace and in the
[2:25:57] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:26:01] Amen. God bless you. I just dismiss you,
[2:26:05] encourage you to refresh yourself and be
[2:26:08] back in good time this evening for the
[2:26:12] message that our brother Lance will have
[2:26:14] for us. God bless you. You're dismissed.
