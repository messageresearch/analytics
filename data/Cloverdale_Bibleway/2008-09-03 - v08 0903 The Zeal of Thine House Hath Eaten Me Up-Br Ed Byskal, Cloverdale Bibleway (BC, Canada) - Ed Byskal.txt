I'm asking Brother Tom Frey, Brother Tom, if you'd come just open the service in a word of prayer. We have no prayer requests here or prayer cloths. If you have a need, just raise your hand as we go. If you're on the telephone or on the hookup, just raise your hand as well. Tom, bow our heads, please. Precious Lord, we want to come into your presence, Lord. Father, we know that Lord, in this day and age, oh God, Satan is your enemy. He is our enemy, Lord. And Lord, there's not one thing he'd like more than to ruin our fellowship tonight, Lord. Lord, he'll use the memory channel. He'll use mistakes that we made today and things that we've done, Lord, to get in the way. And we just want to, Lord, each one lay those things on the table, Lord. We don't want nothing to come between you and us, Lord. Father, we want to be free to worship you, Lord. Free to give you glory and honor and praise. Lord, you're the alone, the only one that's worthy, oh God, of any praise that we might have. Lord, Father, if our thoughts have been on things of today and things of yesterday and things of tomorrow, Lord, we just lay them down as vain, Lord, and empty, Lord, we know that only you can satisfy those things we need, Lord. Father God, there's not a person in this room that doesn't have a need, Lord. Father, whether it be in in their physical life, Lord, whether it be spiritual, Lord, whether it be mental, Father, I just remember my wife at home sick, Lord, and and one of my children, Lord. Father, I know you're the healer. Lord, and and just so many more things that we can say tonight, Lord, that are needs, Lord. But Lord, we know that you paid the price on Calvary, Lord, so that we wouldn't have to to fight the battles, Lord. You said that you'll take up arms for us, Lord. Lord, you said to just stand still. And Lord, that you would move. And so, Lord, we lay everything right on this table, Lord God. Father, that the man of God would not be hindered, Lord. That there be nothing, oh God, that would hinder the word that's to come forth tonight, Lord. Father, we don't know what you have prepared for us, oh God. But we're willing, oh God, to lay everything down that you can give us, oh God, what you desire. And we just pray for the man of God for strength, Lord, that as he stands behind this pulpit, oh God, he might have freedom and liberty, strengthen his body, oh God, to just get himself out of the way, Lord, that you might receive all the glory tonight. Bless everyone that hears this service, Lord, whether they're in this assembly, whether they're on the internet, or whether they hear it months away. Lord, may you just bless the word that goes forth from this desk tonight in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may move your seats. Amen. God bless you. It's good to have everyone here this evening. As I mentioned earlier, if you're on the telephone hookup or on the internet, we want to say God bless you. It's good you could join us.

Every promise. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Of course you do. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Every promise. Maybe you're going to hear about some tonight. Promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line. I am trusting in his love. Every promise in the book is mine. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line, I am trusting in his love divine. Every promise in the book is mine. &gt;&gt; Now, we're just going to loosen up. We're going to believe for every word that we have need of. We want to make it personal. Now, in preparation for the word, I look across the congregation, even though I've been gone for some days, I know there's needs and you know that there's a need. And so, I just want you to not only lift your heart, maybe you want to just lift your hand, say, "Every promise I need, I have something I'm here for tonight. I'm here for a spiritual purpose and I'm claiming the everlasting word of God. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every I am trusting his love. Every promise in the book is mine. &gt;&gt; Oh gracious heavenly father, how lovely you are. How wonderful is your presence and the and that we can come and are invited to come into your divine majesty, Lord, into the presence of the eternal God, the only true and living God. There is none other beside you. You're the God of Israel, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that sent him as a propitiation for us. You're the God that stood by your prophet in this generation. And you're alive tonight. &gt;&gt; You're You have ears to hear and a mouth to speak, eyes to see. Look down, oh God, into our hearts and see our individual cry in need and hear our cry. And now, Father, as we approach the word, I pray that you'll bless this gathering of people. We've gathered to meet with you, not to hear man or not to see one another, but we've gathered to hear from you. May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was so nice to see on the screen see our brother, I believe, Walder Hilderbrand singing with Nathan and Jonathan. God bless you. So nice to see and have you here. Also, Brother Tom and Sister Marilyn Brown are here visiting. Very, very short. One thing, they they're truly like the wind. They come in and barely get to shake their hand. They're gone. I guess they're leaving tomorrow. But Sister Marjorie Miles was so kind and had us over and we were able to reminisce. And believe me, we have a lot to reminisce about. We We've got a long long history. And it' been just wonderful to to you know what's you know what's wonderful to talk about it is because you just keep confirming how faithful he is. He's faithful. &gt;&gt; He's faithful. Amen. Good see, brother Ken. Sister Jillian, God bless you. God will honor that. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, it's good to be back and we're not going to delay the service, but you know, God is God just a wonderful God. I wouldn't want to serve anyone else. &gt;&gt; Some years ago, I had a call from a pastor He said, "My son is just in total rebellion and he's against me. He's against what we stand for. He's against what we preach. He's against everything." He said, "Uh um I'm going to put him out of the house." He said, "I I'm calling you to just see what you think." I said, "Don't do it. Don't do it." I said, "You know, where might you put him?" And I said, "He he needs to respect the Christ, which is this gospel. He needs to respect Christ, but I wouldn't cast him out onto the street or wherever." Anyway, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. He said, "Would you talk to him?" I said, "Yeah, I sure will." So, I had a had a long counseling time with him and I just told him, I said, "Listen, you know, you we're not trying to make you be a believer. We're not trying to make you a Christian. We're not trying to give you a revelation. We can't. God has to do that. But you need to honor the faith of your mother and father. You need to respect them. And they will always be your mother and father. If you get married, they'll be your wife's mother and father-in-law. And if you have children, they'll be your grandpa, their grandparents. And I said, "You'll never change that." So I said, "You better just, you know, have to come to terms with that." Make a long story short, that was some years ago. And God God, he's not interested in five minutes or just what happens tonight. He's interested in your life. He's interested in where you're going. He's prepared a place for us. And uh the pastor told me, he said, "I I I I just came to the point." I said, "He's coming 21 years old. When he comes 21, I'm going to put him out." Two days before he was 21. Just two days before he had hooked up with a girl. This girl was from overseas from Europe here like exchange student and got work and got immigration and they got together and they were you know really thick together and the pastor told me he said you couldn't have put a tighter pair of pants on anybody than that girl wore and just everything that we're opposed to she was. And two days before he's going to put them out and he just hated to do it. The boy walked up to him and says, "I'm getting married and I want you to marry us." He said, "Wow." He said, 'You know how I was going to do that? And so he called he called another pastor. He said, "What should I do?" That pastor said, "Marry him. You're the best one to do it. You know, you're the only one that can really do it." &gt;&gt; So he married him. And now she came in the environment of of the Holy Holy Spirit and the word of God. And uh they decided to come to church and he came to church and that pastor's son God got a hold of him. He'd been raised in it since a baby and God got a hold of him. He hit the platform and started sobbing his soul out. And this unsaved girl who he just married came up and laid her hand on him and started praying for him. And the pastor, you know, we know we know how everything's supposed to go, right? &gt;&gt; He said, "This isn't right." You know, and here she is praying her heart out for for him and she need prayer. Well, they just make it all short. In a few days, they baptized her. &gt;&gt; And in the last service I spoke, they sat right there, &gt;&gt; both of them, right in front. and he wanted to see me and we went into study and he said I never had an opportunity to formally thank you but he said when you had that talk with me said that helped me a whole lot so sometimes it can just be a simple a few words but if God's behind it &gt;&gt; amen hallelujah and I just want to tell you one more thing too because I know it'll be a lot of interest to you brother Ron Spencer I didn't know but brother Ron the doctors had told him medical people had told him that he had damaged his lungs and I had said here that he to my knowledge he had not damaged his lungs but they said that he had damaged his lungs and had lost I think don't quote me but I think it was around 60 or 70% of the use of his lungs and he said that in normal daily life he was just very very short of breath he would have to stop and sit down and he couldn't manage and and on a Friday night I believe it was in North Carolina in the meeting in North Carolina. Uh the the the atmosphere, the people responding to the word atmosphere just turned electric and uh I called on anyone to stand at that moment and he stood he responded immediately. He said he said, "Brother Biscuit," he said, "I threw both hands into the air." He said, and I said, God, I believe it's the same God speaking that spoke in creation and is speaking here and I receive this. He said, I open my mouth to take a breath and he said it was like a force, a force, a physical force came down like a wind and filled his chest and his lungs. He felt like he was going to burst. And he says it left him at that instant. His his father-in-law said to me, his father-in-law said he came over to me on the platform. He said, "He's a different man since that since that last Friday. He's a totally different man." And you know what, friends? I hope you come expecting tonight. God is real. We don't serve a God of dead wood, stone, formal doctrines of something. We have a living God. This is a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Amen. and we're thankful for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're just so thankful and uh I I want to announce that uh I and my family going to be away for some vacation time and some rest just now and then I have to go on and we'll be speaking in in uh Ukraine and in Switzerland. But, uh we're going to have uh uh we're going to begin with two services on se on September the 28th, Sunday the 28th. as we'll begin on two with two services again and on on that day we're going to have the Lord's supper and communion as well and so we want you to be looking forward to that and praying towards that. Brother Lance Laru and brother John Andy's will be taking the lion's share of the ministry uh while both brother Tom and I are away. And if you have any spiritual need, I tell you these brothers know God. They know how to pray. We have other ministers that are here as well. But they will be giving themselves to the word, to the ministry, and the care of the church, the people. You've been well cared for. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I want to have you turn in John's gospel if you would please. And I'm I'm going to watch the time. I realize that the school has just started once again. Sorry I missed the opportunity to pray with the children, but uh I know God will be with them. In John's gospel, the second chapter, please, we'll start at the 13th verse. Oh, I have friends. There's just so much that's been happening of a supernatural nature. Just believe. &gt;&gt; Will you just have faith and believe? God is doing far more than I could take and relate in the next couple of hours literally both home and abroad. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we want it to continue tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; I didn't come here just to take fill in a Sunday evening service. &gt;&gt; I mean, or Wednesday evening service. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Starting at the 13th verse. And the Jews Passover was at hand. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting. And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple. and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers money, and overthrew the tables, and said unto them that sold doves, take these things hence, make not my father's house, and house of merchandise. And his disciples remembered that it was written, the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in 3 days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, 40 and 6 years was the temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But he spake but he spake unto the uh he spake of the temple of his body. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I want to I want your attention and just as little movement as possible, please. I want to speak to you on the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. It's quite a quite a subject. The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. This zeal can be both negative and positive. Can be indignation, can be envy, can be jealousy, something that's eating a person up. But zeal on the positive side, can be a fervorance of spirit, of earnest, sincerity, desperation, all of these things. pursuing, defending anything is a zeal on behalf of something. And I think of today that people have uh goals and they have they have objectives. They have uh a cause and uh it it's everything to them. I think of the Olympics that just uh concluded and I was trying to conceive in my mind. I read a little article that a a a person reported and and they said, you know, one thing that we don't have to watch this for, you know, however many uh uh sessions they have or or games they have of of the NBA or hockey or something else. At least we don't have to watch this, you know, day after day after day. Of course, we don't have to anyway, but that's what she was expressing. And this uh sports reporter, she said, you know, they just come and they're here for uh two weeks uh for and then we don't see them again. They pass off the scene and we don't see them for another four years. And then they're there for two weeks and they all pass off the scene and they're they're we don't see them or hear of them hardly for another four years and then they reappear. these all of these uh uh o Olympic you know the athletes and I got thinking of I've been pondering about that just a little bit thinking just think four years but I tell you what they don't forget it &gt;&gt; they're remembering it every morning &gt;&gt; when it's over they're up the next morning maybe at 5:00 or 6:00 and they didn't change their diet they're staying right with that diet cuz they've got four years down the road they're going to be there again. I was just bronze this time or maybe I came sixth this time. I'm going to make it next time. I'm going to stand on that podium next time. And they they're you talk about a cause. They're absolutely fanatically dedicated and given over to it for what? Just a few moments standing there with a piece of metal around their neck. And I'm not I'm not degrading them. I'm not diminishing them. That's that's their life. That's their cause. If they can do that &gt;&gt; for that kind of crown, that little fading thing and they may fade off and not even be there four years later and the world will forget them unless they're, you know, somebody of an outstanding uh world record or something. But to think that it is within a person, they have the wherewithal and you have it &gt;&gt; for a much different cause and a much different purpose in life. And and we I if they should if they should settle back, they certainly aren't going to stand on any podium and win anything, win any prize. They they have that we we have also, you know, we may be having an election. They they they talk about it in Canada and they're in the midst of one in the United States. They're they're going to be choosing a new president in November. And you talk about a cause. You talk about people crossing the country, campaigning, wearing themselves out. You think my voice is horse? They lose their voices. They're screaming. They're yelling. They're they're trying to uh win votes over. They're trying to talk to people. They're they're committed to it to what? a political party. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron Spencer, I think he shocked his people and all. He said, "Just think." He said, "The people were up this morning at early 4, 5:00 in the morning already lining up to hear someone stand up and speak and tell them a bunch of lies." &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And not that they intend to do it, but even the prophet, he tells it very, very clearly. good men. Even priests go priests, he says, they go into the priesthood not to be bad people, to be good. And none doesn't go in to be a bad woman. Goes in to be a good person. But the system corrupts them because the systems are corrupt &gt;&gt; because man is at the bottom of it. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. I want you to respond then if you really believe it. You say sickum tonight and I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; And people are people have good intentions, but they have a cause. I'm talking about a cause. If anybody has a cause, it's the believers of this message. We have a cause. We have a purpose in this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not here to be idol. We're not here to just ride the wave. We're here to be aggressive. We're here to be zealous. &gt;&gt; We've got something to be zealous about. &gt;&gt; I don't have to pump you up. The Holy Spirit will pump you up. He'll make real to you. Just yield yourself to him &gt;&gt; even now. Don't wait for tomorrow. Even now, &gt;&gt; if you happen to need that, and I believe we all do. &gt;&gt; We all do. &gt;&gt; To be fervent. People get, and I'm just going to take a moment with this, but they get so fervent with their campaigning and their politics and their volunteering programs and community projects and and we get a little rag paper comes to our desk, our door rather, a couple times uh a week and and I leaf through the thing and and I'm just amazed how people get so engaged in community projects and what they will do and how hard they will work and how they give themselves to it. And I just think, you know, some of that's not even in in believers. &gt;&gt; They don't work at this. They don't come just a, you know, on a Sunday or something. They're working at this all the time and giving themselves of every every bit of time they may have. They squeeze that time. They sacrifice. &gt;&gt; They sacrifice themselves. Nobody has to beg them. They want to do it &gt;&gt; because they believe in a cause. So, it really boils down, do we believe in this? Do we really believe in this? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that we do. &gt;&gt; And we live, we live at this at this time. All of us have become accustomed, I believe, one way or another. But we are living in a world that is under a cloud of paranoia. &gt;&gt; Amen. You young people are being reared in a &gt;&gt; in a society that's already filled with fear &gt;&gt; and you're you're accustomed to it. You become accustomed to it. I can't get accustomed to the fact when I go through uh uh go through an airport and I've said it here before. Go through an airport and I tell you what, you're just so many cattle going down the chute. &gt;&gt; Take your belt off. Take your shoes off, you know. Take your jacket off. Put it there. No, don't put it there. Take your computer out and do this. What is that? Have you got anything? Got anything sharp? We got a little razor like this. Hardly cuts my beard. Take it out. You can't take that. This is fanaticism. &gt;&gt; How many people have they caught? Listen. &gt;&gt; 19 men change the whole world. &gt;&gt; 19 men change the world you're living in. &gt;&gt; 19 men are forcing you to do a whole lot of things and will continue to do a lot of things you never dreamed you'd ever do. 19 men who believed in a cause &gt;&gt; invented the world word terrorism almost every day you hear it everywhere you hear it and it's infiltrated every aspect of your life your home &gt;&gt; true &gt;&gt; your countrymen &gt;&gt; my life every country every person 19 men did it I know of the 11 men &gt;&gt; that changed the face of the world. &gt;&gt; Zeal, &gt;&gt; commitment, &gt;&gt; you can call it fanaticism if you want. I call it the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They got full of the Holy Ghost and they did what they could where they could. Amen. &gt;&gt; It didn't have to have a big title. Some of them didn't even get included &gt;&gt; hardly in the scriptures of what they did, but they believed in what they were doing. They believed in it. &gt;&gt; We believe in this message, do we not? &gt;&gt; And that happens to be an earmark of the believers all down through history. If they if they really believed it, they were committed to it, they were given over to it, and they wouldn't allow anything to take it out of them. &gt;&gt; You think that these Muslims that are so fanatically given over, you think these suicide bombers, you think they You think that you could convince them otherwise? Never. &gt;&gt; Never. You couldn't convince them any other way because they're more committed than you that than perhaps you are to get them out of it. &gt;&gt; Even if you had the opportunity to try to talk them out of it, you can't persuade them out of it because they're completely given. So you can just say, "Oh, it's a spirit." Oh, that doesn't work with me because we have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We are to have the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit's more aggressive than that spirit. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the Holy Spirit and he's called baptized with the Holy Ghost and &gt;&gt; fire. &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; Fire. &gt;&gt; Fire can be a a a burning blaze that catches the attention of the people. Fire can also be a quiet, unheard, almost un unseen, almost invisible, but it's a burning ember &gt;&gt; and it'll remain hot. Some substances remain hot. Just hot. Just white hot. &gt;&gt; They don't have to have a whole lot of, you know, fuel to them. They just remain hot. I can tell you some believers are um perhaps, you know, they're more uh uh demonstrative and and others are quiet. Some burn real fast and others burn slow, but they burn long and they're faithful. You see them year in and year out and nothing changes. What is it? It's a fire. &gt;&gt; It's a flame. It's an ember. &gt;&gt; And you can see it all through the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you read when we read uh Hebrews the 11th chapter, you can't read Hebrews the 11th chapter without feeling the burning devotion of those heroes of faith. &gt;&gt; Your heart must be stirred when you read and hear. And what shall I say more? Paul says, what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeffy and of David also and Samuel and the prophets who through faith they subdued kingdoms and wrought righteousness, obtained promises and stopped the mouths of lions. I don't think what Paul is writing here and what God thought of these people that wasn't the headlines in the newspaper. They weren't saying it from the from the public or from the reigning kingdom at that time or from the political system. They weren't saying these people have these people have wrought righteousness. These people have done they said these are a bunch of fanatics. &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Ben used many times these are holy rollers. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of some reproachful sentence &gt;&gt; or claim upon you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they quenched the violence of fire and escaped the edge of the sword. And out of weakness was made strong. And they waxed valiant in fight and turned to flight the armies of the aliens. &gt;&gt; You know, you're quiet. I'm going to preach till I've got the flames going burning, burning high and burning hot until some zeal is I'm going to stoke some fires tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah, and I'm just going through two or three of these examples. Jeremiah, he found that the word of God in him. And we are the people who go around saying we're the word made flesh today. &gt;&gt; All right. If that is the truth and that is the case, it will definitely show. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was one. And he even said he said to the Lord, you you I've been deceived. You know, he felt he'd been brought into something and led into a certain way. And he he he kind of predicted he thought which direction it was going to go and how it would be in his life. And then he found it was going to be different because he found it brought such reproaches and brought such hardship upon him. And then he decided I won't speak of this anymore. I won't speak of it. I won't say it. And he said then I said I will not make mention of him. I'm just not going to make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name. I'm not going to do it. But I'm not going to declare this word of the Lord anymore. He says, "But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones." &gt;&gt; It's the same word. &gt;&gt; The same word that had that was in Jeremiah. It's the same word. Same God. You believe it? Same God that's here tonight. Exactly. Don't put him back there. He's here right now. Don't say I will be. Say I am. I am that word. I can't shut it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got to allow God. Let the breeze and the wind of the Holy Spirit Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that we ought to agree here tonight. our services. We're not just here for one service, but our church, the services, and the brother next to me and the sister next to me, it's going to be different &gt;&gt; because by the power of by the power of our own faith, we're going to change one another. &gt;&gt; We're going to have an effect, a positive effect on one another. &gt;&gt; Because we're not content to be where we are. You know what we're preaching for? What I'm preaching for is that a whole body of people moves higher, moves to another level. I heard brother John Andy say that quite some time ago, maybe two, three years ago, and it never left me. That's what we're here for, to move people to a higher level, to another plane, not to settle back down higher and higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what this whole message is all about. &gt;&gt; And you can find it in Apostle Paul. You just can't find these people as normal individuals with a normal job and a normal calling. These people had a cause. &gt;&gt; And perhaps it wasn't all flamboyant. No, some of them have a quiet burning flame. But they were always the same. And they were constant. Wherever they were, they were had an effect upon the community or upon their area, &gt;&gt; upon the people that were around them. Apostle Paul said in the book of Acts, he said, "None of these things move me." &gt;&gt; Listen to me tonight. There are things that are out here that are trying to move you. &gt;&gt; There are things I'm going to come on it a little bit further down in the message. There's things out there, and brother Brandham says, "Why do you hunger, church?" &gt;&gt; I'll give the quote later on. Why do you hunger, church? Are you church? &gt;&gt; Why do you hunger? &gt;&gt; And why do you thirst? Because it's God's wanting to reveal these secrets to you. &gt;&gt; But he says, "But you let &gt;&gt; you let this the world get it out of you." &gt;&gt; Didn't say sin, but just the world. You let your job get it out of you. you let your wife or your husband or your family or somebody get it out of you. See, I'll just leave that there because I want to come back to it. But Paul went on to say, "None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God." And in Corinthians, he went on to say in Corinthians, for though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of, for a necessity is laid upon me. Yay, woe unto me if I preach not the gospel. This a man is a driven man. &gt;&gt; It's not just some history. This are this is our brother &gt;&gt; serving the same God we're serving. He's the first church age messenger. And thank God he had others coming in behind him burning with the same flame and the same fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he went on to say, "For if I do this willingly, I have a reward. But if I against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me." He said, "What is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself, yet have I made myself servant unto all. &gt;&gt; You know, this preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ is not just something. It's not something that maybe sitting out in the audience people think, oh, you're on a platform or you're behind the pulpit and it's it's all it's all, you know, you're before the people. I tell you what, it's a service. &gt;&gt; You have to be willing to serve. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not here to talk about myself, but most of the days that I was away, I would maybe have breakfast and maybe some cheese and crackers after the evening service back in my room. And Sunday, they had a picnic and everybody was there and everybody's invited and said, "You never saw so much food." And oh, I would have liked to have been there not for the food, but to just to be with the brothers and sisters and get to shake their hand. I never even got to shake most of their hand because I just went from the service directly home. Went to my room already thinking about the next service. But Sunday morning, I just stayed from morning right till the evening service time. And God gave us a gracious time. Friends, we're here to serve. I don't say the ministry. We are here as a church, as a body of Christ. We're here to serve. We've got a call on our lives. We've got a commission and we are those that have been sent here. &gt;&gt; We didn't we weren't birthed here by accident. We have been sent here. &gt;&gt; And that whatever skills you have, God gave it to you. Whatever talent you have, God gave it to you. The person you are, God brought you here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And surrender and yield up what you have, who you are to him. And he will use it. &gt;&gt; Say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants that fire kindled. &gt;&gt; And so, Apostle Paul goes on. He says, "And unto the Jews, I became a Jew that I might gain the Jews for them that are under the law." And he says, "To them that are without the law, as without the law, that I might gain some, gain them. And to the weak, I became as weak that I might gain the weak. I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some. You know, friends, we're not here to live our own lives. We're not here just to be individuals and a little in a little orbit of our own. We're here if they're weak, we became weak, and to those that are those that are Jews or those that are this, we became that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize, so run that ye may obtain. Others in the scripture have had a real purpose in life. And the Bible is a record of zealous people, &gt;&gt; zealots, &gt;&gt; zealous people &gt;&gt; that were gripped with zeal. Brother Brandham said in the manifestation of the spirit, he said, "I may not have much knowledge of the word and so forth, but in my heart I have a love for him that I can't express. He's more than life to me. &gt;&gt; Just a short statement, but he wasn't just saying something flowery. He was saying absolute truth. I may not be able to express it, but down in my heart is a love so great. He said, I cannot express it and it means more than life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to come down to our address. more than our job, &gt;&gt; more than our education, &gt;&gt; more than our own little way of life, &gt;&gt; more than uh you know, more than maybe uh what what we possibly could do. I can do it. I I know I can get there. I can achieve this. I maybe that's not the goal that God wants you to achieve. &gt;&gt; May have something else in mind for you. Let him do the molding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, when we read of him, he preached with such force as the Holy Spirit poured through him the fulfillment of Malachi 3. He preached it with such force and it caught the attention of the people. I'm mentioning quite a number so that you can just identify with them. And then it said of him, "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in. Behold, he shall come," sayth the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And who may abide his day? Who may be the who may abide the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appearth? For he is like a refiner's fire and a fuller soap, speaking of Jesus Christ. He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver. And he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering of righteousness. And I would suggest tonight that possibly and most likely that there is an area in every one of our lives that this refiner of fire that there's some dross that there's something there that he could burn and we could walk out of this place a pure people for God. I'm not talking about sinful things. I'm not talking about iniquity or disobedience. I'm talking about simply having the dross burned up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is doing things even when we don't realize it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's word is going forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We may not even realize it &gt;&gt; during a service. He's a refiner of fire. And it speaks of John the Baptist then in Luke's gospel. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias. And he'll shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient uh to the to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. And he said, "I indeed baptize you with water under repentance, but he that cometh after me, he's mightier than I, whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear, and he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. this zeal. Not just zeal. I'm going to shift a wee bit. Going to shift gears. Not just zeal, but the zeal of thine house. &gt;&gt; Not the zeal for my job has eaten me up. Not the zeal for this sport. Not the zeal for this goal that I have. Not the zeal for something else in life. &gt;&gt; But the zeal of thine house. hath eaten me up. You as a body of people are the house &gt;&gt; and you as an individual is also the house. And Satan will use and is using and contriving every possible thing he can to do damage to the house &gt;&gt; and to fill it with all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; And the one I'm representing is here tonight to get it out &gt;&gt; of the house. That is why when the prophet came, he came and his message was a delivering message. &gt;&gt; But it was a delivering message because it was liberating us and it cast things out of this house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many of you here can rejoice over that? &gt;&gt; This message is a liberating message, a delivering message. And sometimes it comes as one of our brothers of brother uh Richard Drake's dad. He said, "It tore strips off me, but it sure felt good." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a a purifying purging. Sometimes we get things, you know, little things that we hold it kind of dear to ourselves and it's not it's not being a benefit maybe even to others or to your own self and God has to get shed of it and get rid of it. The intense desire was for the house or the dwelling place of God. And it's very much a part of the character of Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul writing to the Corinthians said, "I'm jealous over you." Same word, zealous. I'm jealous over you, but it's with a godly jealousy. I'm going to say tonight publicly to you that know me so well, I'm jealous over the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When I see things that creep in, whether it be in a family or an individual life, I say I'm on a war path. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to do war with this spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not going to have something bind people and hold them back. This is a liberating message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a message of uh uh this we are baptized with this message. It's a message of fire. &gt;&gt; Not just excitement, not just something for a moment. It's not just for this Wednesday evening. &gt;&gt; This whole message is it sets the course of our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to go through this world. We are going through this world like a uh like a comet through the sky and leave a trail of fire behind us. &gt;&gt; The son of man, I say Jesus Christ said to those spirits, listen what the scripture said here. And when he'd made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables. And he said to them that sold doves, "Take these things hence." &gt;&gt; Make not my father's house a house of merchandise. People might think, "Oh, people talk about selling things in the church." It's way beyond that. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us when it speaks of the oh my speaks there's of another cleansing and I haven't got time to go into it, but there's a cleansing. And brother Brandham speaks of the cleansing of this this earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He's going to burn it with a fire &gt;&gt; to make it a fit dwelling place &gt;&gt; for Jesus Christ and his bride. &gt;&gt; And part of that cleansing, I haven't got time, but when you go home, you can read it tonight or tomorrow in chapter 18 of of Revelation. And it talks about this Babylon and the kings of the earth and who committed fornication and lived deliciously with her. And they shall bewail her and lament her. For when they shall see the smoke of her burning, standing a far off for the fear of her torment, saying, "Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, the mighty city, for in one hour is thy judgment is thy judgment come." And listen to this. And the merchandise of gold, and of silver, and of precious stones, and of pearls, and of fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all the thine wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble, and of cinnamon, and odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine. Think of this. This is what he's he he's purging it out. Amen. &gt;&gt; These things these things were objects of of such a they were so glamorized the people blinded the people and oh they were so taken up with all of these fancy and wonderful things and meant nothing to God. &gt;&gt; And he drove it out of the earth, the whole earth to make it a place that was fit for the believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and find flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and listen to the last line. And slaves &gt;&gt; and the souls of men. &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are, but one day you were held by that. &gt;&gt; We all were held &gt;&gt; under the power of this system and God came and drove it out. He made a holy scourge and came with a prophet's voice in our day &gt;&gt; that was s that was successful that was essential that was sufficient is the word I'm looking for sufficient to loose us and the oxen and the doves and the changers of money and all the things in other words all the things that occupied that temple &gt;&gt; said take it out cuz that's not what this temple's made for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're not going to develop a develop a a a system within a message that, you know, just become something that's acceptable. This is just a level that we are. We're not at any particular level. We're here at the at the uh at the bidding of the Holy Spirit. Whatever he says, we will do. &gt;&gt; What he wants of us, we will give. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of our time, of our being, of our families, of whatever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want the service tonight and I thought about it earlier. This is my eighth service since I've been gone as a number eight. But I feel more I feel more committed because I'm here home with our own people. But I thought of this service and I thought I want God grant by the Holy Spirit that you will take and into the hearts of the people you'll rearrange our agendas. You'll rearrange our priorities. And may I may I be rewarded when this service is over that the message itself will have a different a different location in your agenda. &gt;&gt; Amen. I asked the people when they were away, how many people perhaps had read or heard or read the seals or people hadn't even read the seals? Might be some sitting here. You need how can you have the fire of God &gt;&gt; when the very voice of God that he sent? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he exposed in the seals this Babylon, &gt;&gt; he exposed them &gt;&gt; to their destruction. Satan hates this book of Revelation, which I do. He hates it. And you're sitting here. You love it. &gt;&gt; This is to be your focus. &gt;&gt; This is your focus, friends. My brothers, my sisters, this is our focus. &gt;&gt; This is our daily food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is something we give ourselves to. &gt;&gt; This isn't a sideline. This isn't just an optional thing to my life. This is to be the focus of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't don't sit there and just say, "Well, that's the way you see it, Brother Ed. That's the way the Bible teaches it. That's the way the message. You can't find anything else in the message." Then it should be number one. Is the message Christ? [Applause] &gt;&gt; What place is Christ to have? &gt;&gt; He's to be number one. &gt;&gt; He'll never be number two. He's number one. &gt;&gt; We must allow that. We must say tonight, that's truth. I accept it. Even though you may not know how things are going to be arranged, just say, "God, take control of my life. Take order of my affairs." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not what I want. It's what he wants. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Faithfulness. Was he faithful? Is he faithful? He expects us to be faithful. &gt;&gt; He came and delivered you for a purpose. He cast all those things out. Satan would make a merchandise of your life. He is today. He's making merchandise of the souls of men. &gt;&gt; Just for a few minutes now, I want to speak about the burden of the word of the Lord in this generation. And this will take a quite a shift perhaps for you. It'll come in a way that maybe you didn't expect. But one of the things that jealousy does, it's protective. A husband for wife and a wife for husband. parents over their children or brother to sister just as members of a congregation in the church. We're not to see some fall and say, "Ah, look at that. Expect that. Look at they think they're a believer. Look at that." You you're not helping them. &gt;&gt; That's not lifting them up. Oh, I hear this or I hear that and I'm not speaking about anything specific because I haven't heard about anything. I'm speaking what's on my heart by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, brother Ed, it's kind of on my case." I don't know anything about your case. I only know what the Holy Spirit is telling me to say. &gt;&gt; We are called on &gt;&gt; We are called on to benefit the house &gt;&gt; of Quad. If we say we must speak with our Lord Jesus Christ, make not my father's house a house of merchandise, I won't allow it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where have I got power? I may not be able to speak, but I got power in prayer. &gt;&gt; I got power with my uh uh relationship. I got power. I can visit. I can speak. I can do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I just told you the little account. It's not just a part of life. Years ago, speak to a young man, never see him for maybe five, six, seven, eight years. And next time you see him sitting right on front &gt;&gt; with his wife &gt;&gt; serving God. &gt;&gt; It so helped me. &gt;&gt; It just so helped me. &gt;&gt; We're not there to destroy people. We're there to encourage them. Say you can do it. I say to you young people, you can do it, but you do what? You can be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; It's for you. &gt;&gt; It's not for people to say, "Oh, um, you know, uh, come breath, go breath." That'll never get you there. You think they're going to You think that God's going to have people stand on a stand on a athletes uh podium at some world Olympics and then uh and have Apostle Paul say every all people run but one wins the race. Right? &gt;&gt; He knew what the Olympics was. &gt;&gt; And now we had one and the Bible speaks Malachi 1 and1 says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi twice in Zachchariah says the same thing. The burden of the word of the Lord. Do you know it might help you to understand when a minister comes and stands behind the pulpit here and you see it like it's a groaning. It's a it's an urging that's beyond their physical self to express. It's not it's not their excitement. It's not that they want to, you know, raise their voice or or or thunder out, but it is a groaning &gt;&gt; from within. It's a it's a great thrust that's coming from deep inside because it's the burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not the burden of the man. It's a burden of the word of the Lord. And you need to be spiritual. Sometimes when a minister stand behind the pullpit, remember it's a spiritual ministry. It's a spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; And Satan, look at how brother Brandham has to say to the people every once in a while. He says to them, he says, you know, I'm not just preaching to you here because they're coming so cutting sometimes so hard, but they know that it's going says these tapes, he said, go worldwide. &gt;&gt; He was ministering not just to the people there, but he's ministering to more that was beyond that. And I am too through you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This word lives on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this is very essence of the entire message that we have the message of this hour the end the very essence of it is one of I'm taking now beyond zeal to travail. I spoke here some time ago, touched on it, the breath of God and how the the the the depth of that the breath of God. The last explanation to that phrase is as a woman in travail panting in travail panting. And it came to me with such force while I was away begin to see. I said to the people, you know, in North Carolina, we're just no distance at all from Spindale. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Where's Spindale? Who's ever heard of Spindale? called that because it was a cotton place where they spun yarns. Spindale here. The prophet God in his extraordinary measure of grace sends that kind of a voice and ministry to Spindale. &gt;&gt; I said to the people here, I'm going to read you what he said in Spindale. Here it is. &gt;&gt; Here's who he called out. Here's the names he called. Where are these people? Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are all those thousands that were there? &gt;&gt; Anybody here that was there? And and and I called out maybe one or two. They're not there. &gt;&gt; You'd think, "Oh, what a loss. What a what an exercise in in vain to send a mighty voice to spin nail. It's it's not over. &gt;&gt; I was still able to be there to echo it out. And God has a voice there in that whole area. &gt;&gt; A mighty voice. &gt;&gt; I didn't know that brother Kim was going to come down. Brother Kim went and maybe doesn't want me to say this. Brother Ben is here. And he also uh went with his mom and they they met their dad down there. And and brother Kim, he went and he he had had a plan and he bought a car, but he had he had the printer. He took the printer with him and the and the stapler and the cutter and everything else and and brother Joseph Green who is now the pastor there. There was about a thousand people that night I would think and and he said I want on the last night I want him to put that on the platform and so brother Kim just stood there and pulled it down on the internet. It was actually internet. It wasn't wasn't you know it wasn't just on a disc. Pulled it down in the internet and and and said okay we'll go here. We'll we'll go to Spindale. We'll just go on a we we'll just go on a search and we'll search Spindale. Okay, there's there's the messages he preached in Spindale. So, we'll just choose this one right here. And click. And here here's another one. Click. And by the time he was done speaking, both of them were off. And another brother came up and just stapled them both and trimmed them both and and within about two and a half minutes had both of the messages out. And I just said, "Who wants these messages?" Brother Joe Green. Just went like that, you know. So I turned around, presented them to him. He said, "These are messages that nobody's ever read." &gt;&gt; I won't say nobody's ever read. Perhaps somebody has read it on the on their on the on the internet, but you know what I mean. The people were gripped by that. But you see one of the things and I'm now going to tell you and you can think what you wish of me. But one thing that I see creeping in amongst the message is actually a a Catholic spirit. Oh, you say you're not serious, brother Ed. What are you saying? Yeah. Yeah. You know what the Catholic spirit is? The priest will tell me. The priest reads the book. &gt;&gt; The priest does it. I don't have to do it. &gt;&gt; I just go to church and the priest tells me &gt;&gt; whatever he tells me. How many Catholics are here saved all across the congregation? Staunch Catholics. My father was an alter boy. Brother Lance Laroo was an alter boy. My father stood behind the pullpit, the little podium, and would look at the Bible, and he's not a kid. He's a young man, and his soul yearned to see what was in that book. If I could just put my hands on it and read that book, but it's not for me. It's just for the priest. And the danger within the message is that they're just content with what they got. &gt;&gt; And Satan's trying to pull one over on you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And some of you young people, the messages are lined up in your mother and dad's shelves. you haven't you can read good and you go and you study hard and you write exams and all the rest of it and to get good marks great get good marks what's that going to do for you &gt;&gt; might give you better place in life but it's not going to do anything for you eternity &gt;&gt; unless the good marks and what you do here is devoted to Christ devoted to God I'm going to learn this I'm going to I'm going to uh seek to give myself I've got certain skills certain things and for the kingdom of God but I lay it all before the kingdom of God all for the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Am I speaking in tongues or foreign language or something? You understand what I mean? &gt;&gt; I told part of your testimony, Sister Lewan, and I told how sister Marjorie Miles heard the prophet's voice. It wasn't CK&W or it wasn't some other radio station. It wasn't Soft Rock and it wasn't 102 Christian station. She heard a voice &gt;&gt; and she wondered, "Where in the world is that voice coming from?" and dial the television channels to try and find to get it to match and tried the radio station to try to get it to match and now I don't know all the details but the end of that is sister Lana's here and sister Marjory's here two souls &gt;&gt; I say glory to God hallelujah let's give him praise hallelujah he's worth it I told her testimony, brother Darren, of God's mighty power to take the scourge and drive out every binding force. Oh, I just want to give glory to him tonight. &gt;&gt; Tell your friends, you're not going to stop me. I'm going to have a jubilee here this evening. &gt;&gt; I want you to continue with it. Change your whole focus, your whole attention from the youngest who can understand me to the eldest here. Change our priorities. &gt;&gt; Start your day. Have the word of God. &gt;&gt; Make it a diet. &gt;&gt; A diet. &gt;&gt; If you don't get the message, don't have breakfast. &gt;&gt; If you don't have the message, don't eat that day. &gt;&gt; And you'll find yourself in the message &gt;&gt; being dictated to by the flesh. Say, "Oh God, create in me a great hunger. &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness. &gt;&gt; The zeal of thine house. The zeal of thine house. The zeal. God put a zeal in you for this house. &gt;&gt; I need this word. &gt;&gt; I need this. I need it today. &gt;&gt; I need this instruction today. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, if we don't take that, I can tell you that Satan has uh he's a cunning cunning enemy. And this is a whole another service and I can't even begin on it now, but I'm going to introduce it. Hollywood. When you think of Hollywood, you think of movies and actors. And just forget that for a moment. Hollywood is a spirit. Hollywood is a spirit that has permeated &gt;&gt; your home, &gt;&gt; this church, &gt;&gt; your school, &gt;&gt; your own individual life. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, whether you want me to say it or not, you can't prevent it by yourself. &gt;&gt; It fashions the way you think. Hollywood has made mockery of what they call love. &gt;&gt; Hollywood has made a mockery and a joke out of marriage. &gt;&gt; Hollywood has permeated every area. Hollywood has permeated the pulpit &gt;&gt; and religion &gt;&gt; and worship &gt;&gt; until they don't know what worship. The thing of worship is a hype up the people and put on a production. That's not that's not worship. Worship is when you get lost in God and you're just saying, "Oh, glory to God." Something's rising within you and you can't keep it down. That's worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hollywood's made a mockery of prayer. &gt;&gt; People don't know how to pray. &gt;&gt; Even last service I was in And I'm not making any reference to brother Ron Spencer church, but people today I said you can't keep it out anywhere. Let's pray. Raise your voice to God. Begin to pray. Hear pin drop. 300 people praying. &gt;&gt; 500 people praying. Well, I can't. I'm afraid somebody might listen to me. I'm afraid that a nonsense. You're not afraid somebody might listen to you. You get on the phone, you're gonna yap somebody's ear off. &gt;&gt; It's just where your priority is. &gt;&gt; The problem is you haven't talked to him. Come on, rise up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's the same son of man &gt;&gt; that's here tonight that's trying to drive out the stuff that's been making a merchandise of your life, trying to hold you back, trying to hinder you, trying to bind up your family, bind up your own life. God is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is here this evening. The same son of man that was here on earth in that temple is here now in this temple. &gt;&gt; The same son of man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same one and the same voice is going to purge the whole earth &gt;&gt; and make it ready. &gt;&gt; They've tried to take the souls of man and make them slaves. &gt;&gt; Make merchandise of the souls of men. I tell you what I announce to Satan today. He's not going to have this soul. Not going to have your soul. You agree with me. You agree with God's word. Not going to have my soul. I give all that I am and all I ever can be to him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Son of man is here. &gt;&gt; Same son of man. &gt;&gt; Only he's in another temple. And that's a more important temple. It's the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That word came by burden and I'm going to close with this. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came into a institution. It was an insane institution. Said it was psychopathic institution. He came there and all insane people. And there was a very lovely young lady in her 20s sitting there and brother Bham is looking around. The young woman spoke up and says sir, would you start with me? He said you are you what are you doing this place? They said I'm insane. It was in Flint, Michigan. And he went into the room and there was a man with him. Beautiful young woman. Looked about 22 to 25 years old. 20 to 25 years old. She said, "How do you do?" Said, "If you don't mind, sir, I'd like you to start with me." Now, as I'm going through this, will you please bear in mind this is not just a man from Jeffersonville, Indiana that wandered into an insane psychopathic institution. This is God Almighty, veiled in flesh of a prophet messenger walking into a place that is invaded by every spirit. And there was almighty God &gt;&gt; ready to speak a word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's only to elect. &gt;&gt; We don't know who it is. Oh, if you only know how privileged you are that he came your way. &gt;&gt; Thousands, millions may be better, &gt;&gt; but he came your way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She said, "If you don't mind, sir, could you start with me?" She said, "I wonder." And said, "Could you listen to my story just a moment?" She said, "I was reared in a good home." And my mother taught me not to do wrong, to shun the evil, and embrace the right thing. I got mixed up with a young man. It caused me disgrace. I just started to throw myself away and I became an alcoholic. Then they picked me up and sent me to a Catholic institution called the Good Shepherd's Home. There I was under correction for a number of years and then they released me and as soon as I got out I started drinking again. And she said, "Then I served a year or two in a woman's state prison." And said, "Then I changed from Protestant to Catholic." See, she's trying. Then during this time, I changed back to Protestant again from the chaplain talking to me. The chaplain persuaded her in the prison that she should be a Protestant again. and said, "I came out and tried again, but she said I went right back into it again into prostitution and drinking." And I said, "Brother Bren speaking, and your mother, she's dead. Father, he's dead." And I said, "What do you think they would think about you now?" She said, "Oh, if I could only go back again." And I said, "Now listen, friends. Brother Brandham isn't taking three pages &gt;&gt; to bore you because this is nothing less than the Holy Spirit of God speaking to a whole generation." And I said, "A lovely young woman like you. Don't you desire to be married and have babies like all mothers do and so forth." And she said, "I would love to, sir, but look at me. What What could I offer anyone?" I said, "You've got one thing you could offer." And she said, "What's that?" I said, "Your soul to Jesus Christ." And she said, "Sir, he wouldn't receive me." And I said, "Oh, yes, he will." She said, "How do you know he would? I tried." And I said, "Yes, you're just turning the pages, but you really come to him." She said, "What could he do with me?" I said, "Make a lady out of you." &gt;&gt; She said, "Not me. I'm too far gone &gt;&gt; now. Listen to the breath of God &gt;&gt; listen to the breath of God. Listen to the groaning now of the Holy Spirit to woman in this state. I said he can take you back from the time when you was a virgin &gt;&gt; innocent girl. The blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient and powerful to transform the vilest sinner to a bloodwashed saint guilless before God. &gt;&gt; That wasn't just a statement to her. That was God's breath. &gt;&gt; That was God's breath. That was God's creative word &gt;&gt; to create her back into her innocence, into her virginity again. Do you believe that or do you think that's over the edge? That's absolutely the truth. &gt;&gt; That was the power of Almighty God coming through a vessel to take her back to the state of her innocence again. &gt;&gt; And the people said, &gt;&gt; we should say, "Praise be to God." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's my God. &gt;&gt; He loosed you. &gt;&gt; He set you free. He didn't just do that. He created you as a new creature in Christ Jesus and takes you back to your innocence again. &gt;&gt; That's the travail of the Holy Spirit. That's the travail of God. &gt;&gt; That's what the Apostle Paul was saying. I travail again in birth for you. That's why the prophet spoke birth pains. He said, "Israel entered into birth painans under every prophet's message." &gt;&gt; Listen friends, &gt;&gt; this earth is going to be born into a perfect place fit for Christ and his bride and his wife. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon went on to say, she said, "I've tried so many times And he said, "Well, I want to tell you, I believe your case has never been diagnosed, right?" And I said, "You don't want to be like that." And she said, "Certainly not." See, God was in the desire. &gt;&gt; God was in her desire. That's why she tried. That's why she changed to Catholic. That's why she changed back to Protestant, because she was trying. It's not trying. &gt;&gt; And I know we've just come through camp and we've had young people say, "Well, I've tried." That's not it. &gt;&gt; It's not it. It's selling out. &gt;&gt; See, I can't get that across. Selling out. &gt;&gt; Parents need to be sold out. Give an example to the young people &gt;&gt; need to be sold out for God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful on a Wednesday night we have a crowd like this that's here and that is evidence that you have something in your soul towards the message. But don't come here just so as a a gathering place or this is my social circle. It's not a social circle. &gt;&gt; We're here because of the fire of God. And if you're not here because of the fire of God, go get entertainment somewhere else. We're not here to entertain. We're here to preach and take the gloves off and preach the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This flowery just, you know, we're not here just to be flowery. We're here to preach the truth. &gt;&gt; And if there ever was a day that we needed, it's now. So he asked her to get down to pray. She said, "What you said a few moments ago is exactly what I want to be. I want to be a mother with a husband and babies, someone to love and someone that loves me." And she said, "I'd never spoil a man's life like I am." Says, "You don't have to." And he had her get down and pray. And she prayed for a while. And she looked up at him. He said, "It's over." &gt;&gt; He said, "No, it's not. &gt;&gt; You're just going to get up and be exactly the same. You stay right there." &gt;&gt; And she began to pray. And he began to pray. And they prayed and they prayed and they stayed there. And finally, he said, with the tears streaming down her face, she looked up at him. He said, "Said, brother Brandham, something's happened." He said, "That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's over now. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to be able to stay there till something happens. &gt;&gt; Stay there till the Holy Spirit baptizes you. I still believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. With the demonstration and power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We believe in it, do we not? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God's cleansing his temple. &gt;&gt; He's cleansing his temple. Don't you dare stay where you have stayed. If you've been in a state of backsliden or playing with the message, don't you stay there. Don't you stay there. Satan is a vile, cruel taskmaster and nobody can handle him. Humanly, you can't handle him. Say amen if you agree with that. &gt;&gt; You know you we can't handle him. He's a slicker. He knows more about the scripture than you do. &gt;&gt; You can't debate. You can't argue with him. What's the solution? Simple. You give yourself to God. &gt;&gt; You pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stay on your knees till something happens. &gt;&gt; This woman got up and he said she's married now. &gt;&gt; Lovely Christian woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got her children and her husband. Amen. &gt;&gt; What did it? &gt;&gt; Creative. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Power. &gt;&gt; The third pole of Brother Bram's ministry was create. &gt;&gt; Create. God is creating his bride right tonight. He's creating it. There is no other word. That's the only word. That's the only word that's creative. &gt;&gt; And that's why I have I'm so gripped and so so not sold on it. I'm so committed to it. The only word that this world has that we have in this world rather is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And there doesn't happen to be another message. God doesn't send two that go contrary one from the other. We have thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; I should have brought my while I was just getting ready for service. I got an email from Sister Janet Maloney and she said Saturday night and the atmosphere just turned into electric in the tent and brother Ron Spencer was preaching and caught away as he was. I hope you don't mind Sister Janet. Sister Janet had been praying. She'd been under a crushing crushing burden for a nephew, I believe it is, whose name is Raymond. And if you could picture a hopeless person, that's this man. and she had to come to a most difficult, most crushing of a decision concerning this man. And she counseledled with me some months ago about him. He's like he's like the woman. He's he he's the male of this woman. &gt;&gt; Sister Janet, I gave the testimony twice and she walked into the tent. She had a second thing on her heart, two things. And she walked into the tent and she prayed and had her head down said, "Cod, cause brother Spencer to speak to me directly." And she raised her eyes and Brother Ron was right there in the platform looking straight into her eyes and he says, "Raymond." And what was else he said? He said to your don't worry or he's &gt;&gt; poor poor boy. &gt;&gt; The poor boy free something like that. The poor boy spoke directly to her. &gt;&gt; I said to brother Raymond I said to brother Spencer do you remember saying that? He said no I have don't remember it at all. &gt;&gt; That's one. I have a second one. I won't tell you about it just now. Both on that same night. We're all sitting there maybe oblivious to how real God is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How how powerful he is and maybe reaching out maybe a thousand people there. But there's one woman that walked out of there and said, "Thank God. &gt;&gt; He she touched the hem of his garment." My brother, my sister, I say to you tonight, don't miss it. &gt;&gt; Don't just sit here on Wednesday evening saying, "Well, we're just here." Don't miss that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the reality of God. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything less. Why settle for less when the heavens are full of the real? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The zeal. And I pray that God will baptize you with a fire of zeal for the house of God, for the temple of God. Not a bunch of stones in Israel. This temple, this bride. Hallelujah. This bride of Jesus Christ is the temple of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Satan's working feverishly with merchandise to, you know, the tradeoff deal and the barter thing and and you know, with our I know we get nervous. We start talking about our time. I'm talking about not your time. I'm not talking about your money. I'm talking about you. &gt;&gt; You as an individual. We you as an individual, young or old, you give yourself say, "Well, I'm a farmer. I'm a I'm a carpenter. I'm a plumber. I'm a I'm I'm a a skilled technician." Fine. Carry on. But the whole thing is sold out and given over to God. Whatever you want me, I'm eager. &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay with it, friends. I'm over time, but I'm going to stay with it because God wants this message down in your heart tonight. &gt;&gt; He wants this congregation, he's calling out the congregation to be sold out to God with zeal. And I pray that Sunday morning when you come here and Brother Lance is speaking that you'll have a fire in your bones. You won't come here late. You won't be visiting out in the fellowship room. You'll be here. You'll be in the Bible. You'll have the message book open. You'll be in prayer sing, "Oh God, speak to me." &gt;&gt; And you come here and it'll be different over this pullpit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I have the confidence tonight that the Holy Spirit has given me the confirmation that this is the message for this group of people that's here tonight for this congregation and that you're going to receive it and you're going to move on with God at a different level than you ever have before. And then we say amen. &gt;&gt; That is so be it. And that is it shall be so. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Why don't you offer your prayer to God? &gt;&gt; Why don't you tell God what's in your heart? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And hear me now, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak to us now, Lord. Thank you for speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Thank you for stirring my soul. Thank you for moving my heart. Oh, spirit of God. Oh, spirit of God. Have your own blessed way. Hallelujah. Thank God for honesty. Just lift your hearts to him. Lift your voice to him. &gt;&gt; He's here to hear you. &gt;&gt; He's listening. He's listening. &gt;&gt; Just say it to him. &gt;&gt; Let your words match what's in your heart. Just tell them what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God, I've been cold. I've been away. I've been a drift. &gt;&gt; I want to feel that zeal now tonight. &gt;&gt; But fire of God. &gt;&gt; This is what the people need. &gt;&gt; This is what the bride of Jesus Christ needs. Oh God, the zeal of thine house has eaten me up. &gt;&gt; Oh God, something going Sense it, don't feel it. Oh, burn on, burn on, burn on, burn on, oh fire of God, burn on, burn on, burn on, oh Holy Spirit, burn on, burn on, burn on, burn on, oh God, till all the dross is burned away. Oh, fire.

Oh, draw me nearer, nearer, here near here near here near here near here near here near here near here near here near here near [Music] the cross [Music] Oh, draw me nearer, [Music] nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord [Music] to thy preious. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know friends, from my heart to your heart, I've been singing this verse. I am thine, oh Lord. It's been such a truth to me. It's been part of my life, part of my testimony. I've heard thy voice. We've heard his voice. And it told his love to me. But I long to rise. I have a zeal tonight to rise. A hunger and a thirst eating on me to rise so this temple could be more given over. &gt;&gt; Yes. Do I have you as my friends, my brothers and sisters in Christ joining in oneness with that? But I long to rise. Let us sing that verse again. I need to close because we've got a young people. I realize don't want to keep you overly, but I want you to be able to leave here. I say, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; as the people leave this place, may they leave with a longing. I long to rise in the arms of faith and be closer drawn &gt;&gt; to thee. [Music] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy voice. and for I love to be. I want to rise in the arms of faith and be closer. Draw to thee. Oh, draw me nearer, nearer, nearerless to the cross [Music] Lord drawing nearer [Music] nearer blessed Lord to thy preious. [Music] We're going to sing consecrate me now thy service. I want to give one word to the young men. Do you know why you struggle so much? Do you know why Satan works on your case so much? young men, not ignoring the young ladies, but you young men, is because God has ordained that you should be spiritual leaders. &gt;&gt; And Satan hates that &gt;&gt; and he wars against that and he tries to occupy and fill you with all kinds of other things and you're energized to do all kinds of things that set the world on fire. Set it on fire, but set it on a godly fire. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've got patterns. you've got. And that's why that's why maybe one or two of you, maybe a whole bunch of you are getting the message tonight. That's why Satan works on young men so much to distract them and fill your life with everything else cuz you're ordained of God to be a leader, &gt;&gt; to be an example. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And so when we sing this, I don't have to preach a long message. Just say that's for me. &gt;&gt; Thanks, brother Ed. You've now given me you've given me some you've given me some insight. I'm called of God by the word to be a leader and that I will be. I'll give myself to that in the name of Jesus Christ. Consecrate me now to my ser [Music] and let my soul come with A steadfast [Music] and my will be lost in love. Oh, draw me nearer, [Music] nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to the cross where th Oh, draw me nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to thy presence. [Music] &gt;&gt; As we close the service, we don't dismiss you from his presence. Those of you that need to slip away, you just slip away as you need. If you wish to remain and be in prayer, continue to do so. Just mind God, my gracious, loving, kind heavenly father, full of longsuffering and mercy, full of grace, full of love. You've shown it to us, Lord, tonight. You've shown it to us in our lifetime when we think of where we were in the darkness in the pit we were in and that how you loosed us. Oh, we're so thankful you came into the temple with a cord with a scourge and drove all the merchandisers out. Hallelujah. People are making merchandise of our lives and you set us free. And here we are now in a liberated place, in a liberated atmosphere. Oh father, I pray that every every person, oh God, as they have resolved and dedicated themselves to you, you will receive them. You'll receive this dedication. I'm thine, O Lord, and I've heard thy voice. You'll receive this dedication. Consecrate me now to thy service, oh God. Don't let me just be an idol one, but let me be a useful joint. That which every joint supply, let me be a supplying joint in the name of Jesus Christ for this temple of the Holy Ghost. Father, bless your people as they drive the highways. Keep them safe. Watch over them. I pray until we'll at the next appointed time we meet at your feet. Hear and hear your good word of God from your servants in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Draw me near. [Music] to the cross where thous [Applause] has done. Oh, come here.
