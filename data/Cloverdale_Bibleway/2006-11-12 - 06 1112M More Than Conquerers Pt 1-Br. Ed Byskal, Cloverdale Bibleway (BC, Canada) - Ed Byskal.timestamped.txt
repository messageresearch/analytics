[11:12] Lord, we worship you this morning,
[11:14] Father. We give you glory, Lord Jesus.
[11:17] Lord, we thankful we could come into

[11:45] Amen. I'm going to ask our brother
[11:46] Nathaniel Law to open up in a word of
[11:48] prayer this morning. We've got a
[11:50] testimony for brother Alex. Said, "For
[11:53] some time, I've asked our Lord that when
[11:54] sickness would come to me that I would
[11:56] be able to overcome the enemy, the
[11:58] devil, just by taking God at his word
[12:01] with nothing else, just the word by
[12:03] itself would be sufficient for me to
[12:05] have the victory." Sure enough, the
[12:07] trial came and I started to have a cold
[12:08] that developed into some kind of
[12:10] pneumonia. Constantly coughing,
[12:12] struggling to keep breathing properly.
[12:14] Said, "I started the battle by
[12:16] confessing by his stripes I am healed
[12:18] and saying, "Thank you, Lord, for
[12:19] healing me." It's a hard battle. The
[12:22] devil tempted me to quit confessing, but
[12:24] as I kept thanking the Lord for healing
[12:25] me, day by day, I was doing a little
[12:27] better. Amen. It's completely cleared
[12:30] up. We're just thankful to know that by
[12:32] his stripes, I am healed. We're thankful
[12:35] for that. Let's sing together. Be it
[12:37] unto me according to your word. And
[12:40] we've got a number of requests we'll
[12:41] take before the Lord.
[12:45] Be it unto me
[12:51] according to your word.
[12:57] According to the proises
[13:03] I can say
[13:06] you
[13:08] just call upon
[13:14] the truth that sets me free

[36:35] testify
[36:37] my redeemer
[36:40] days
[36:45] for you and me once again.
[36:49] And so I'm casting all my cares on you.
[36:55] I know you love me.
[37:01] redemption my love.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Redemption by
[37:08] the story

[37:19] That's what angels.
[37:25] My redeemer is no longer dead.
[37:31] is coming back for you and me.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful the tomb is empty
[37:44] &gt;&gt; and our redeemer is not in the tomb
[37:48] but coming back for us.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:52] Well, I'll let you have your seats.
[37:54] Thank you, choir.
[38:01] I need to make some announcements.
[38:06] So, if you give me your kind attention,
[38:10] you might even want to or need to jot
[38:12] some of these down.
[38:15] Now, if you have a good photogenic mind,
[38:17] you probably don't need to, but uh I
[38:21] wouldn't trust don't trust everything to
[38:24] your me mental powers.
[38:27] When you do, we generally get phone
[38:28] calls to the office saying, "What was
[38:31] that date again? What are we doing
[38:32] then?" This way, you'll be able to know.
[38:36] Uh tonight, Brother Tony and Brother
[38:39] Murphy
[38:40] have uh been preparing a uh a service
[38:44] for us having to do with a great deal of
[38:48] what has been taking place right up to
[38:50] this current moment in China. Of course,
[38:54] we can't tell you everything
[38:57] uh because just so much of it can't be
[38:59] made public, but for those of you that
[39:02] are here and have followed the work, at
[39:05] least you can read between the lines and
[39:08] you'll see
[39:10] uh the results of the work that has been
[39:13] taking place. I think brother Murphy
[39:15] just returned last Friday after about uh
[39:19] I mean a week ago this Friday after
[39:22] about two months there in China. Brother
[39:25] Timothy Ma, we want to be remembering
[39:28] him.
[39:30] He's been in Vietnam for over a month
[39:33] now and uh is continuing. He's planning
[39:37] to be away maybe as much as 3 months. Uh
[39:41] part of that he wants to go to certain
[39:43] areas of China and uh as as you know he
[39:47] is Chinese but spent 11 years pastoring
[39:50] in Vietnam under the severe strict
[39:54] communist regime. So he's very very
[39:57] acquainted with uh how things operate
[40:00] there and he does certainly move about
[40:03] differently than say we would or anybody
[40:06] from United States or Canada or Europe.
[40:10] Uh he can move about. He has relatives.
[40:13] He has friends and he knows how to deal
[40:15] with those the people. And so we're
[40:18] happy for the work and the progress, the
[40:22] number of books that are being
[40:24] translated, message books into the
[40:26] Vietnamese language and into the Chinese
[40:28] language. And I can say for my own part,
[40:32] I'm I'm most happy to see what is
[40:36] happening in Asia because this is a as
[40:42] far as population is concerned, it's the
[40:44] giant of the world. really is and we're
[40:47] really happy about that. So that's
[40:49] tonight. You won't want to miss that.
[40:52] Now, our special Thanksgiving services
[40:56] are going to be on Friday,
[40:59] November the 24th,
[41:01] and then Sunday,
[41:04] November the 26, Sunday morning at
[41:06] 10:30, Sunday evening at 5:00 p.m.
[41:11] Uh, Brother Tim Puit will be the
[41:13] visiting minister,
[41:15] and we've had him most of the times that
[41:18] he has been here. He's been here for a
[41:20] camp speaker, but we just felt I really
[41:23] felt led to have him at this time. I
[41:25] don't know what all God has in store,
[41:27] but I believe it's going to be a really
[41:29] a wonderful weekend. And we're just
[41:32] going to turn him loose. Let the Holy
[41:36] Spirit do what he wishes to do. There
[41:39] will be no service on Wednesday the 22nd
[41:43] because we'll be going on the 24th with
[41:46] the Friday service. And we want you to
[41:48] be well prepared and ready on Sunday,
[41:52] December the 24th.
[41:55] Uh that will be one service on December
[41:58] the on December the 24th.
[42:02] One service that's a Sunday. Next day is
[42:04] Christmas.
[42:06] And many many of our congregation which
[42:08] are from European descent as was my own
[42:12] parents and my family. their their
[42:15] gathering for their families was always
[42:18] Christmas Eve and so we want to give
[42:22] opportunity
[42:23] uh many of the people are here of the
[42:25] church they have they'll be with their
[42:28] families many of them unsaved many of
[42:32] them just from perhaps some church
[42:33] religious denomination and we want you
[42:36] to be a testimony at that time so Sunday
[42:39] December the 24th will be one service on
[42:42] Sunday December the 31st First, there'll
[42:45] be a morning service at the usual time
[42:48] of 10:30 and then the evening service
[42:51] will be our uh New Year's Eve watch
[42:55] night service which will begin at 9:00.
[42:59] So, that is the uh
[43:03] the immediate uh announcements. Then I
[43:06] want to say a word about the 207
[43:11] uh international internet convention
[43:14] which is going from July the 1st to July
[43:18] the 8th 8 days. It's the longest that
[43:21] we've ever had and I just felt inspired
[43:25] to do that and Lord willing we are we've
[43:28] already had the first initial meeting of
[43:32] tying together assemblies and
[43:34] congregations
[43:36] in different places around the globe
[43:38] where they will be able to the time and
[43:42] schedule permitting they'll be able to
[43:44] live stream uh a service and perhaps
[43:48] their pastor may be here and they will
[43:51] be able to live stream the service over
[43:54] in other countries. Now, as far as
[43:56] Europe and Eastern Europe is concerned
[43:58] and much of Africa, they will be able to
[44:01] get the morning service here in the
[44:03] evening over there. So, congregations
[44:06] will be seated in many different places
[44:09] in the world and actually participating
[44:11] in the service along with us at that
[44:14] time. It's the first time that I know of
[44:18] it happening at the certainly the first
[44:20] time happening here and God has given us
[44:23] very very skilled and qualified people
[44:26] to uh to be able to put this thing
[44:29] together. So we're trusting the Lord to
[44:32] help us. That is our goal. July the 1st,
[44:36] 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, that is Sunday,
[44:39] Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we'll be
[44:42] here in the church. And we'll be having
[44:45] uh uh we haven't got a schedule as
[44:48] exactly as yet because we want to tie
[44:50] ministers meetings in and have foreign
[44:53] brothers speaking from other countries.
[44:56] We will also tie in uh something for our
[45:00] young people. We will uh perhaps
[45:03] emphasize the youth one day and uh and
[45:08] and then and then we're going to have
[45:10] the services from Thursday, Friday,
[45:13] Saturday and Sunday will be in the
[45:15] Shandis auditorium which is at the
[45:17] Pacific Academy uh school. So that's the
[45:20] Shandis auditorium which will be
[45:23] Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday
[45:25] and those will be evening meetings over
[45:27] there. anything that takes place those
[45:29] days in the afternoon or morning will be
[45:32] taking place here.
[45:34] Now, the reason I'm going into this much
[45:36] detail at this point and for those of
[45:38] you that are on the internet streaming
[45:41] at this time,
[45:43] uh it is imperative
[45:46] and if you have relatives or friends or
[45:49] ministers that you think may want to
[45:53] come and attend, it's imperative,
[45:57] absolutely critical that they apply for
[46:00] visas now. At this time we have had
[46:04] brother Tony was uh relating to me one
[46:07] brother uh was waiting 6 months for visa
[46:11] from India and I don't know did he
[46:14] finally get it brother Tony or did a
[46:16] time pass something like that it did it
[46:20] didn't happen I understand so uh that's
[46:23] number one and those you that are
[46:25] streaming now if you are wish to come or
[46:29] plan to come you must apply for your
[46:32] visa immediately
[46:34] and and uh contact us. Now also we want
[46:38] any who are planning to attend to
[46:41] contact us because
[46:44] there's two reasons. Number one, it's
[46:47] the highest uh tourist
[46:51] week of the year. July the 1st the
[46:54] holiday here in Canada. July the 4th the
[46:56] holiday on the US side. So that's the
[46:58] highest uh um occupancy in the hotels
[47:04] during that week. That's number one.
[47:06] Number two, this area and the city of
[47:09] Suri is hosting some kind of a worldass
[47:13] ball uh tournament and everything is
[47:17] being booked up and much of it has been
[47:19] booked up. So you must those are that
[47:23] are streaming and if you may have a
[47:26] minister or a pastor uh that you want
[47:30] you can contact you must uh contact us
[47:34] immediately. Contact us now. send an
[47:36] email if you would this next week and so
[47:40] that we will have some idea as to how
[47:42] many are going to actually be attending
[47:46] because we need to block off the rooms
[47:48] as of as of this next week. And uh for
[47:53] we only found one hotel that will allow
[47:56] us to block off the rooms with a
[47:58] cancellation privilege uh down the road.
[48:02] One hotel wanted 100% of the payment
[48:05] made right now and other hotels wanted
[48:09] 50%. So we have to know how many rooms
[48:12] we're going to block off and we are
[48:13] going to be be blocking them off because
[48:15] we know that a lot from uh states in
[48:17] Canada are going to be coming to attend
[48:20] the the services. And lastly, I would
[48:23] like that the church members here who
[48:27] have a a a space available, if you would
[48:31] please contact the office. See, we need
[48:34] to do this way up front. We only have 7
[48:36] months and that's not a long period of
[48:38] time for what it is we're wanting to
[48:39] achieve. If you have a room that's
[48:41] available, phone the office if you would
[48:44] this next week and let them know that I
[48:46] have a room for a couple or I have a
[48:48] room for a a a sister. I have a room for
[48:53] couple men whatever it is and let us
[48:56] know so we can begin to uh put this
[48:59] together and we'll be having team
[49:01] leaders people who are in charge of
[49:02] billeting people who are in charge of
[49:04] transportation people who will be in
[49:07] charge of giving uh uh immigration
[49:10] information. We're not going to try to
[49:12] be immigration people but we will have
[49:14] questions and we're going to have people
[49:16] who will be in charge of those things.
[49:18] And the other thing is as you you that
[49:21] are part of the assembly, you well know
[49:23] we have we want the people who are
[49:27] coming here uh to be able to also have a
[49:30] US visa so that because they may be
[49:33] bilited on the US side and so we've
[49:36] we've gained this experience from some
[49:38] of the problems we've had in the past.
[49:41] And uh you don't know what it's like to
[49:42] have someone come from overseas and they
[49:44] have a US visa and come to the border
[49:45] and they won't let them come over for
[49:47] the special meeting or they come here
[49:50] for the special meeting and then I want
[49:52] to take them down for dinner someplace
[49:53] and oh they don't have a US visa. And so
[49:56] we've always had that for years and
[49:58] years and we've got a lot of experience
[50:00] but we have found that the uh we found
[50:05] that homeland security and the Canadian
[50:07] immigration are quite inflexible.
[50:09] We haven't found them too cooperative
[50:11] when it comes to those kind of things.
[50:13] And I think you know what I'm talking
[50:14] about. And so, well, one day there'll be
[50:18] no borders in heaven either. Amen. Isn't
[50:21] that wonderful? Praise God. Nice to see
[50:25] you, brother Paul. Sister Jerry. Amen.
[50:28] And I got your letter. And we'll we'll
[50:31] do your your wish today. our brother
[50:34] Paul Hlet. He's pastoring in Boisee,
[50:37] Idaho, and the work is growing. He drove
[50:41] all the way up from Boisee and his wife
[50:44] because he desires
[50:46] to be installed into the ministry
[50:49] formally and ordained to the ministry.
[50:52] And we'll we're going to do that.
[50:56] I'd like to
[50:59] have you stand if you would and I'd like
[51:02] to sing that chorus.
[51:04] Uh we worship you in the highest place.
[51:08] Would you do that? Help us, brother.
[51:14] We worship you
[51:17] in the highest place
[51:21] for you.
[51:25] I high
[51:29] we praise you
[51:31] [Music]
[51:40] for all
[51:43] [Music]
[51:44] and we come to you
[51:49] and worship
[51:51] at your feet.
[51:59] We place you
[52:02] in the highest place
[52:07] for you.
[52:10] I high
[52:13] [Music]
[52:21] Oh,
[52:24] [Music]
[52:29] and we come to you
[52:33] and worship
[52:35] at your feet.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Paul, would you please
[52:43] come? We're going to have you come and
[52:46] stand here. Brother Tony, if you would
[52:48] join me, please. Also,
[52:54] as a prophet of God has said, we do not
[52:59] and are we are unable to give any man a
[53:04] gift. The gift is something that's born
[53:06] in him. If you just come and stand here,
[53:09] brother Paul, please.
[53:12] And what we are doing now as a
[53:15] congregation,
[53:17] we are acknowledging before God the gift
[53:21] that God has placed in our brother.
[53:25] We don't do this lightly. I've known our
[53:27] brother Paul Haylet and his wife Sister
[53:29] Jerry for many, many, many years.
[53:33] I've seen a stability. I've seen a
[53:35] burden even when he was not aware that
[53:38] he should be taking this responsibility.
[53:41] And sometimes it has to take uh certain
[53:44] events that evolve and then the people
[53:47] themselves become aware. We need some we
[53:50] need a shepherd and and and by the time
[53:53] that awareness comes on them they
[53:56] realize we have him right here. And I
[53:59] really like to see what has taken place
[54:02] in Boisey in that the people come to
[54:05] that awareness. they come to that uh
[54:09] realization and at the same time here's
[54:12] one that's been right amongst them and
[54:14] they've all been together like a family
[54:16] and the realization comes upon him that
[54:19] the burden that he's had
[54:22] is the burden of the word of the Lord
[54:25] and those are the two realizations which
[54:28] have to take place and brother Paul even
[54:30] though I have not been there but I've
[54:32] been in such close contact with you and
[54:35] with others from the assembly, but
[54:37] particularly yourself. And I realize
[54:39] that this is what has happened. And so,
[54:41] as we come and lay hands on you, we are
[54:44] we are acknowledging the gift that God
[54:47] has placed within you and ordain you to
[54:51] the ministry of the Lord's work.
[54:55] There will be difficult times as there
[54:57] has been. There'll be heavy burdens as
[55:00] there has been and there'll be more. But
[55:03] there'll be grace. there be special
[55:05] wisdom and there is a special anointing
[55:08] that goes with it. And I have noticed
[55:10] that it's it's just as true true to
[55:14] pattern as can be. When someone is
[55:17] ordained into the ministry, there is a
[55:20] special anointing that comes upon that
[55:22] individual. And I'm going to ask you all
[55:24] to bow your heads with us as we pray and
[55:26] lay hands upon our brother.
[55:31] God bless you, brother.
[55:37] Heavenly Father,
[55:40] we are standing on sacred ground.
[55:44] Our brother Paul Haylet has
[55:47] not only served you, but he's lived for
[55:49] you even before he perhaps even dreamed
[55:53] of having a ministry such as you have
[55:56] opened the door and made a way. And
[55:59] sometimes, as your prophet has said, a
[56:02] minister runs from it. But yet, there's
[56:05] a time when he cannot run any longer.
[56:08] The burden overtakes, oh God. Overtakes
[56:11] and consumes the individual. And I know
[56:13] that the burden has consumed our brother
[56:15] Paul, oh God, and his wife also sharing
[56:20] in that being a helpmate to him. I pray,
[56:23] Father, that you will bless her in her
[56:24] place and her post of duty. But now as
[56:27] we lay hands upon our brother Paul, we
[56:31] ordain him to the calling and separate
[56:35] him to the purpose for which you have
[56:38] had for him. And you have done this,
[56:41] Lord, not just at this moment, but
[56:43] you've had this in your mind. You have
[56:46] called him from his youth, oh Lord. He
[56:49] was birthed with this gift. And I pray
[56:51] now you'll use this gift mightily. Give
[56:54] him wisdom, Lord, at the times when he
[56:57] he's in decision making. And may he
[57:00] truly be the ox of the team. As your
[57:03] servant, your prophet has said, the
[57:05] pastor is the ox of the team. He just
[57:08] has a way to bring people together. Oh
[57:11] God, I pray that you will use him and
[57:13] prosper the work in Boyisey and give
[57:16] this message a mighty voice there. I
[57:18] pray we send him, oh God. We send him
[57:22] with the blessings of God upon his life
[57:25] and upon his work and upon his ministry.
[57:28] We ask it in the almighty name of the
[57:30] Lord Jesus Christ. Glory to God
[57:33] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit shall abide in him
[57:37] oh God in a in a overflowing measure.
[57:41] And I pray the people will be
[57:42] strengthened and blessed under his
[57:44] ministry
[57:46] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[57:48] Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you, Paul. God
[57:54] bless.
[57:58] [Music]
[58:01] Amen.
[58:03] Hallelujah.
[58:06] I'll invite you to take your Bibles if
[58:08] you would please turn to Romans the 8th
[58:11] chapter.
[58:18] Sorry to take up so much time with the
[58:21] announcements, but we some these things
[58:24] are just necessary.
[58:28] I'm going to begin to read
[58:31] at the 35th verse
[58:34] down to verse 39.
[58:38] Who shall separate us from the love of
[58:41] Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or
[58:45] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[58:49] peril or sword?
[58:51] As it is written, for thy sake we are
[58:53] killed all the day long. We are
[58:56] accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[58:59] Nay, in all of these things we are more
[59:02] than conquerors through him that loved
[59:05] us. For I am persuaded that neither
[59:08] death nor life, nor angels, nor
[59:11] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[59:14] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[59:18] nor depth, nor any other creature shall
[59:21] be able to separate us from the love of
[59:24] God which is in Christ Jesus. Just
[59:27] before you're seated, we'll pray.
[59:31] Father,
[59:33] I stand here today, oh God, at the post
[59:36] of duty and have no desire whatsoever to
[59:41] impose man's thoughts or man's words
[59:45] upon this congregation of people because
[59:49] man's words will fail and they are
[59:52] limited with time, Lord. But your word
[59:56] is eternal. They are indestructible.
[1:00:00] Your word will produce life. Your word
[1:00:03] will change lives. Your word will break
[1:00:07] feathers and bondages. Your word will
[1:00:10] defeat Satan every time. Your word will
[1:00:13] heal the sick. Your word can cast out
[1:00:17] cancers and change the cell and the
[1:00:19] molecular system within a person's body,
[1:00:22] the chemistry. Your word will heal
[1:00:25] diabetes. Your word, oh God, will clear
[1:00:28] the mind of those that have been
[1:00:30] afflicted. Your word will heal the
[1:00:32] emotional individual. Oh God, I pray,
[1:00:36] Father, that your word now will come
[1:00:38] forth and that you will be the speaker
[1:00:41] and let my lips now just be separated to
[1:00:45] your service to be an instrument in your
[1:00:48] hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Let
[1:00:51] that name be glorified. Amen. Amen. You
[1:00:54] may be seated.
[1:01:00] For those of you that have been
[1:01:02] following in the services and we've been
[1:01:05] taking uh in the seals, taking subjects
[1:01:09] and thoughts from the seals and even
[1:01:12] though these may not it may not be
[1:01:16] in absolute continuity, yet if you
[1:01:19] listen very closely, you'll see that
[1:01:22] they do tie together very very much. So,
[1:01:25] for those of you that are here that have
[1:01:27] not been in the other services, but
[1:01:30] we've been speaking as a result of the
[1:01:32] seals, uh I'm very much
[1:01:36] I'm very much consumed by
[1:01:39] uh and determined to bring some of these
[1:01:42] things to you and I pray they'll be a
[1:01:44] great blessing.
[1:01:46] There is one thing that I like to make
[1:01:49] and preface my remarks this morning in
[1:01:52] the message by a statement that I would
[1:01:55] like you to remember. And that is that
[1:01:59] any revelation of God
[1:02:04] or revelation of a divine nature
[1:02:08] will translate into a into a a change
[1:02:13] within an individual's life. And that
[1:02:16] change will cause that person to be more
[1:02:20] Christlike.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; If it's a true revelation
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; I have had over the years
[1:02:27] all too often and even a few times would
[1:02:30] be too many those that have come to me
[1:02:33] and and sometimes they're just enthused.
[1:02:36] They're inspired about a certain thing
[1:02:38] that they came across or a certain thing
[1:02:40] that they heard and they're really
[1:02:42] caught up with it. And I can see that
[1:02:44] almost every time you meet them that
[1:02:47] they're on the same subject and it just
[1:02:49] seems so they seem so quickened by it. I
[1:02:53] do two things.
[1:02:55] I I just listen
[1:02:59] and the second thing I do is watch.
[1:03:02] I watch to see what this truth or this
[1:03:06] revelation or this inspiration I watch
[1:03:09] to see what it's going to translate
[1:03:11] into. And if it doesn't start
[1:03:13] translating into a deeper walk with God
[1:03:17] and more of the life of Jesus Christ
[1:03:19] being expressed in them right away, I
[1:03:21] put a big question mark over what the
[1:03:23] inspiration was and where it came from
[1:03:26] and what it's all about. I I I don't
[1:03:28] have to make a decision on I I just back
[1:03:30] away. I don't chew over it. I don't get
[1:03:32] into any debate about it. It might be
[1:03:34] something perhaps I don't clearly see,
[1:03:37] but it's such a reality to this
[1:03:39] individual and I just back away. But
[1:03:41] every real true revelation will produce
[1:03:45] the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And that is an absolute.
[1:03:53] Brother Brandham has said in a message
[1:03:55] from that time, he said, "When a man
[1:03:58] meets God,
[1:04:00] he's changed from that minute. When a
[1:04:04] man meets God, the rest of his days,
[1:04:06] he'll never be the same because he's got
[1:04:10] eternal life. He's a new creature and
[1:04:13] old things have passed away and all
[1:04:15] things have become new and he looks new.
[1:04:19] So when a man or a woman or a young
[1:04:22] person meets God
[1:04:24] and he said another place that you'll
[1:04:28] never be the same once you have become
[1:04:31] an associate
[1:04:33] I like that an associate of Jesus Christ
[1:04:36] you'll never be the same. I pray God
[1:04:40] that that will be our portion and that
[1:04:42] is why we're preaching the things that
[1:04:44] we are preaching so that you will have a
[1:04:49] lifechanging experience.
[1:04:52] Now the scripture which we have read in
[1:04:56] verse 37 of of the 8th chapter of
[1:04:59] Romans. Nay, in all these things we are
[1:05:03] more than conquerors through him that
[1:05:06] loved us. Now the the subject of
[1:05:09] conquering
[1:05:11] uh it's uh it occurs many times. It's
[1:05:17] the word is used to o to overcome or to
[1:05:21] conquer. It's used in the scripture uh
[1:05:24] many times and it has the same the same
[1:05:27] meaning but in the last time that it
[1:05:30] appears in the Bible it says he that
[1:05:35] overcomemeth
[1:05:37] that's the last time this Greek word
[1:05:39] appears in the Bible he that
[1:05:41] overcomemeth
[1:05:43] shall inherit all things and I will be
[1:05:47] his god and he shall be my son the first
[1:05:52] seal opened up.
[1:05:54] And the first seal said, "And I," this
[1:05:57] was Roman, uh, Revelation 6. "And I saw,
[1:06:00] and behold, a white horse, and he that
[1:06:03] sat on him had a bow and a crown."
[1:06:07] Brother Brandham makes note, a bow, but
[1:06:09] no arrows.
[1:06:11] He said it's a he's a bluff.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; And a crown was given unto him. He
[1:06:18] didn't have a crown, but a crown was
[1:06:19] given unto him. and he went forth
[1:06:22] conquering and a conqueror. Now, just
[1:06:25] having read those three scriptures, it
[1:06:28] is clearly evident that whatever takes
[1:06:31] place on the face of the earth, there's
[1:06:34] going to be a group of people that are
[1:06:37] going to be more powerful than this
[1:06:40] fellow who rode out conquering.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And he does conquer
[1:06:46] and to conquer. That is his objective.
[1:06:50] He is antichrist. He's anti-word. He's
[1:06:53] in opposition to all that is godly and
[1:06:56] righteousness. He's in opposition to
[1:06:59] God. He is none other than Lucifer who
[1:07:01] was cast out of Satan. Cast out of
[1:07:04] heaven. The first the first war that
[1:07:06] ever took place was in heaven. And I
[1:07:08] want to touch on that as we move
[1:07:10] through. Not where God dwells. Because
[1:07:13] it was Lucifer who said, "I will
[1:07:15] ascend." He never got there. He wanted
[1:07:18] to, but he never got there. And he was
[1:07:20] cast out. But his purpose, his whole
[1:07:23] ambition is to conquer. And you don't
[1:07:26] have to go very far today as you walk
[1:07:28] around in your place of work or school
[1:07:31] or wherever and you'll find out that he
[1:07:33] has succeeded in conquering the minds
[1:07:36] and the lives of multitudes of people.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Prophet said this was Satan, Superman.
[1:07:46] And I want you to listen very carefully
[1:07:48] because I have some things are really
[1:07:50] heavy on my heart and I want your full
[1:07:52] attention. He said this is the Satan
[1:07:56] superman with education with wisdom with
[1:08:00] church theology of his own word of his
[1:08:04] own making and he rides his white
[1:08:06] denominational horse to deceive the
[1:08:09] people. That's his purpose. That's his
[1:08:11] intent is for deception. In the first
[1:08:15] seal, he went on to say, "And the writer
[1:08:17] has no name, but Christ is called the
[1:08:20] word of God." This guy isn't called
[1:08:22] anything, but he's on a white horse.
[1:08:25] Because the scripture also speaks of
[1:08:27] Christ coming on a white horse. That is
[1:08:29] a power. White uh a a a horse in the
[1:08:33] scriptures always a power. And the rider
[1:08:36] has no arrows for his bow. He had a bow,
[1:08:40] but there's nothing said about him
[1:08:41] having any arrows. So he must be a
[1:08:44] bluffer. And this guy can't smite
[1:08:47] nothing. But he's playing the part of a
[1:08:51] hypocrite. He's going forth riding on a
[1:08:54] white horse going out to conquer.
[1:08:58] Now the word I just want to give it to
[1:09:00] you the so that you'll get the whole
[1:09:03] context of this. He going out to conquer
[1:09:05] and to conquer. But the scripture has
[1:09:08] said that you are more than conquerors.
[1:09:11] And I I I've it's going to be wonderful.
[1:09:15] We are more than conquerors. I just
[1:09:17] throw it out to you just a a moment for
[1:09:19] your to think about while we're moving
[1:09:21] through this subject. If you had an
[1:09:23] enemy and you conquered him, he's
[1:09:26] already conquered and you already have
[1:09:29] victory. What is the purpose of being
[1:09:31] more than a conqueror?
[1:09:35] I leave you with the question.
[1:09:40] To conquer
[1:09:42] is to prevail.
[1:09:44] To get the victory. Oh, these are all
[1:09:47] lovely.
[1:09:49] To carry off the victory. Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; To hold fast to the faith at all cost
[1:09:57] even to death to have victory because
[1:10:00] even the believer all the martyrs they
[1:10:03] went down in death but they actually had
[1:10:06] victory in death. Look at Jesus Christ.
[1:10:08] His greatest victory wasn't when he cast
[1:10:11] out a thousand demons out of the maniac
[1:10:13] of the gatherines. That wasn't his
[1:10:15] greatest victory. His greatest victory
[1:10:17] wasn't doing as the scripture said and
[1:10:19] he healed all of them. That wasn't his
[1:10:21] greatest victory. Or turning the water
[1:10:24] into wine or the loaves and the fishes.
[1:10:27] That wasn't his victory. Feeding 5,000.
[1:10:30] That wasn't his greatest victory.
[1:10:33] but on the cross.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Giving his last breath
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; and saying, "Father, forgive them.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they do." And he he
[1:10:43] gave up, the scripture says, he gave up
[1:10:45] he gave up the holy he gave up his
[1:10:48] spirit, the his and died the death. That
[1:10:53] was his greatest victory.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Then he rose
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; from the dead.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:02] So we are not uh unacquainted with the
[1:11:06] phrase and perhaps you have used the
[1:11:08] phrase
[1:11:10] life is a struggle.
[1:11:13] Life is a struggle and I think we all
[1:11:16] have experienced it and the scripture
[1:11:19] tells us that we do wrestle against the
[1:11:22] powers of darkness and wickedness in
[1:11:26] high places as every believer. If you
[1:11:29] don't have a struggle, I'm not talking
[1:11:31] about just life's struggles living in
[1:11:33] life, but if you don't have a spiritual
[1:11:36] conflict going on, then then I would do
[1:11:39] some checking up because if you are if
[1:11:42] you're having a spiritual struggle, we
[1:11:45] do wrestle, not part-time, it's a
[1:11:48] full-time job. We wrestle against this
[1:11:51] powers of darkness and wickedness in
[1:11:53] high places. And the wrestling is a
[1:11:56] contest between two
[1:11:59] in which each endeavors to throw the
[1:12:02] other
[1:12:04] and which is decided when the victor is
[1:12:07] able to hold his opponent down with his
[1:12:10] hand upon his neck. And so in this
[1:12:13] struggle, even one of the words is like
[1:12:15] to vibrate because if you've seen those
[1:12:18] that wrestle are trying to throw their
[1:12:20] opponent down and it's going this way
[1:12:22] and that way in a movement, all these
[1:12:24] different movements and finally one gets
[1:12:26] the other offbalance.
[1:12:29] I can tell you as I thought on this and
[1:12:31] study this earnestly that and
[1:12:33] prayerfully this week, I can see in my
[1:12:36] own experience, my own lifetime, those
[1:12:39] that I've sought to counsel and maybe
[1:12:42] young people or families or whatever
[1:12:43] more. And you can see Satan buffeting
[1:12:46] them. You've heard the word buffeting
[1:12:49] them. And the scripture tells us that
[1:12:51] the Apostle Paul, a messenger from
[1:12:53] Satan, had come to buffet him. Well,
[1:12:56] that buffeting is to cause someone to
[1:12:58] shake. And if Satan can continue to
[1:13:01] buffet a person, if he gets them off
[1:13:03] balance, and often often it's too late
[1:13:07] for that person to regain their balance
[1:13:09] because they've been pressed too far off
[1:13:12] off their off of their spiritual
[1:13:14] balance.
[1:13:16] He said, "We look at the world
[1:13:19] and its corrupted state."
[1:13:22] Just having a look at the world this
[1:13:24] morning and its corrupted state to gain
[1:13:26] some appreciation
[1:13:28] of what we have been saved from
[1:13:34] and the keeping power of God
[1:13:38] that has been released and sent to us as
[1:13:42] believers causing us to be conquerors.
[1:13:46] I'm talking to this audience today
[1:13:49] because conquering is more than
[1:13:52] attending this church.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Conquering is more than just a certain
[1:13:57] code of dress.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Conquering is more than just having a
[1:14:02] certain kind of phraseology that is that
[1:14:05] is understood and accepted by my
[1:14:07] neighbors and my peers and those I go to
[1:14:09] church with. That's not the conquering
[1:14:11] I'm talking about. I'm talking about a
[1:14:14] conquering that is conquering the evil
[1:14:17] and the darkness and the temptation of
[1:14:20] the world because every person undergoes
[1:14:23] those kind of tests and to have
[1:14:25] conquering power over that and yet
[1:14:27] that's not being more than a conqueror
[1:14:29] that is conquering
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; and we're interested in that.
[1:14:38] I gave some deep deep thought, prayerful
[1:14:41] thought
[1:14:42] to the permeating
[1:14:45] effect of evil that's in the world. It's
[1:14:49] troubling,
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; but it's so pervading,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; so permeating,
[1:14:58] invading
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; the minds.
[1:15:02] And and and I can tell you, Satan, he's
[1:15:05] so brazen. If he would come before Jesus
[1:15:08] Christ, the very son of God, and come
[1:15:12] right to him and say, "If you be the son
[1:15:14] of God," let me tell you this morning,
[1:15:17] he's not afraid of any one of us,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; he'll come to you at any time. He
[1:15:23] doesn't care whether you're tired. He
[1:15:25] doesn't care whether you're busy. He
[1:15:27] doesn't care whether you're rich or
[1:15:29] whether you're poor. He doesn't care
[1:15:31] whether you're healthy or whether you're
[1:15:32] sick. He doesn't care what your status
[1:15:35] of life is. He is on the job and he and
[1:15:38] 24 hours a day he intends to invade
[1:15:41] every area of your life, your home, your
[1:15:44] work, your place, your mind to try to
[1:15:47] throw you off balance.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; We're in a wrestling match.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; And God has given us, now this is not
[1:15:58] just some mental thing.
[1:16:00] It's got to be reality. God has given
[1:16:04] and made available
[1:16:06] to the believers, to his children. He's
[1:16:09] made available to them a power that can
[1:16:12] conquer that enemy.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; And make you more than a conqueror.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And the more I'll just drop this in. The
[1:16:21] more than a conqueror is because Satan,
[1:16:25] our warfare with him is at different
[1:16:27] levels.
[1:16:29] It might be physical
[1:16:32] in sickness. It can be emotional in that
[1:16:35] whole realm. Do you know some people war
[1:16:38] with their memories?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Some people have very very very
[1:16:44] terrible memories in their life. They're
[1:16:48] not pleasant. In fact, they're they're
[1:16:52] very distressing and and and many people
[1:16:55] have that.
[1:16:57] Some uh have
[1:17:00] perhaps relationships that they're
[1:17:03] struggling with. They may have ambitions
[1:17:07] that and opportunities
[1:17:09] being presented to them. And Satan is
[1:17:12] per permeating every one of those. He's
[1:17:14] worked through this opportunity. He
[1:17:16] works through this promotion. He works
[1:17:18] through this relationship. Works through
[1:17:20] this uh uh peers, your friends. He's
[1:17:23] working in every area that he possibly
[1:17:26] can to entice, to coax, to enchant, to
[1:17:29] get the people and and he knows that,
[1:17:31] oh, it might look so wonderful, but he's
[1:17:33] getting them off balance.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; And he wants to get them so far off
[1:17:37] balance that they can't recover.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; They can't get their stand again. And to
[1:17:45] say, well, uh, what what is our, uh,
[1:17:48] what is our remedy? God has given us a
[1:17:50] remedy and it is as we hear the word of
[1:17:53] God as we surrender to it then then that
[1:17:57] overcomes that we get our balance back
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and then there's another aspect and this
[1:18:04] is where more than the conqueror comes
[1:18:06] in and I'll just sew it now even though
[1:18:09] it's very early in the service
[1:18:12] to conquer we conquer these things that
[1:18:15] are on the exterior
[1:18:19] we got a difficulty with our job. We got
[1:18:21] a difficulty with a person. We got a
[1:18:23] difficulty in our home. We got a
[1:18:25] financial difficulty. We got a physical
[1:18:27] difficulty. And and and somehow we're
[1:18:29] able to grasp a hold of the word and the
[1:18:32] promise and overcome and have victory in
[1:18:35] this exterior part of our lives.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; But then we still have another area
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; and it is the greater victory.
[1:18:46] It is where we are more than a conqueror
[1:18:49] when we can conquer our own selves.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said his greatest his
[1:18:57] greatest battle, his greatest enemy was
[1:19:01] William Brham.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Your greatest
[1:19:06] problem is not somebody sitting near
[1:19:09] you,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; but it's within your own self.
[1:19:14] And for a person to be able to conquer,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; their own ambition, their own desire,
[1:19:21] their own whatever it might be within
[1:19:24] themselves, able to conquer and wrestle
[1:19:26] it down and cause it to be surrendered
[1:19:29] to the will of God. And that's why
[1:19:32] Jesus, I tell you, there's no place
[1:19:35] where it says that he that he sweat as
[1:19:38] it were great drops of blood, but one
[1:19:42] place he did, Gethsemane,
[1:19:46] it's where his spirit and his will, he
[1:19:49] didn't want to die.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go through the agony.
[1:19:53] He didn't want to go through, he wasn't
[1:19:55] saying, "Oh, glory. I'm going to be I'm
[1:19:57] going to be marred more than the visage
[1:19:59] of any man.
[1:20:01] my visage will be marred more. He become
[1:20:04] unrecognizable.
[1:20:06] This isn't something that he was
[1:20:07] gloating in. It was something he was
[1:20:10] trying to escape.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; But he went to and as a prophet and I
[1:20:15] love it. You never hear it any other
[1:20:17] place. He went to Gethsemane alone
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; where the spirit left him and he went
[1:20:25] from there to the cross as a man like
[1:20:28] you
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; and like me
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; with the weight of the sin and the
[1:20:33] darkness of man's
[1:20:36] unbelief and the world unbelief on his
[1:20:40] shoulders.
[1:20:41] Tell you what, friends,
[1:20:46] that's where
[1:20:48] the the inner self was laid down and
[1:20:52] surrendered
[1:20:53] to the plan and will of God.
[1:21:01] Satan throws some into a bed of ease.
[1:21:05] Fleshly pleasure, they get taken up with
[1:21:07] it. There's people today that are
[1:21:09] probably professing to be believers of
[1:21:11] this message that are at home watching
[1:21:15] some sports event
[1:21:19] rather than than I won't say here in
[1:21:21] church, but in a church in a believer's
[1:21:24] church.
[1:21:26] I've talked to people that have been
[1:21:28] absolutely
[1:21:30] bound,
[1:21:32] literally bound, and I will say probably
[1:21:35] possessed with a sports devil, if there
[1:21:38] is such a thing.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; But they're sure demons of pleasure.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people. I prayed for
[1:21:45] them. They're absolutely bound. They
[1:21:47] have to see. They can tell you. They can
[1:21:50] tell you every sports star in in their
[1:21:53] particular field. Some of it was the NBA
[1:21:56] and others it is in the football and
[1:21:59] others it's in the hockey and others
[1:22:01] it's in something else and absolutely
[1:22:02] consumed with it. I will say Satan has
[1:22:05] got them teetering way off
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; and if they continue to teeter one day
[1:22:10] they'll wake up and they will have
[1:22:12] fallen. Oh my.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; There's a whole array of things.
[1:22:22] Some of you that are sitting here, I'm
[1:22:24] getting right down to your address.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; And you can say amen or say ouch,
[1:22:28] whatever you want to say.
[1:22:31] But some of you have friends.
[1:22:34] And a friend, a real friend
[1:22:38] must be someone
[1:22:41] that thrust you more Godward,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; that you can fellowship with at a
[1:22:48] spiritual level.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; And when you left them, you're stronger.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You are more strengthened.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; If you have a friend so-called, and when
[1:23:01] you leave, you feel a dark cloud. You
[1:23:04] feel a heaviness. You feel as though you
[1:23:07] have not been really encouraged forward
[1:23:10] in a Godword manner. I would limit that
[1:23:13] kind of friendship. I'd put real strict
[1:23:15] boundaries on it.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "How are you? How are you doing
[1:23:19] today?" Fine. You know, I'm on my way.
[1:23:22] People say, "Well, I have friends and we
[1:23:24] got to go over and do a certain certain
[1:23:27] thing." And why don't you tell them I'm
[1:23:28] on my way to a prayer meeting and see
[1:23:31] how long the friendship lasts
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; or I'm on my way to church.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Others he throws
[1:23:40] in a place where they become consumed
[1:23:43] with the lure of wealth or a multitude
[1:23:48] of other good causes. And there's
[1:23:50] nothing wrong with say, you know, people
[1:23:53] serve on hospital committees, people
[1:23:55] serve for the Red Cross, people do their
[1:23:59] with the care agencies or whatever more
[1:24:02] or social agencies. And there's nothing
[1:24:05] wrong with that. It's good. I would
[1:24:07] think that that person is doing a lot of
[1:24:10] good for the community. But on the other
[1:24:12] hand, to have a life consumed with that
[1:24:16] and yet
[1:24:18] no real spiritual walk with God, I would
[1:24:22] say that the one is displacing the
[1:24:24] other.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; And in that it can be very very
[1:24:27] dangerous. You know, it's not the drunk
[1:24:28] or the street or the or the prostitute
[1:24:31] in the red light district. That's not
[1:24:33] what I'm talking about. Those people
[1:24:34] aren't going to be surprised with their
[1:24:36] with their uh conclusion at the end
[1:24:39] because they know
[1:24:41] They know where they are. They know who
[1:24:43] they are. They know what they are.
[1:24:45] They're not trying to put on any
[1:24:46] pretense, but it's people that are taken
[1:24:48] up and and and and faithful in a service
[1:24:52] and faithful in a church and perhaps
[1:24:54] there this morning and giving their best
[1:24:56] and giving of their resources and their
[1:24:59] finances and of their time and
[1:25:00] everything else. and then to wake up and
[1:25:03] find out that they were consumed with
[1:25:05] something that did not really bring them
[1:25:08] into a personal a personal revelation of
[1:25:11] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And that revelation of Jesus Christ is
[1:25:16] the only purpose I'm here.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the first great
[1:25:22] battle that was ever fought began in
[1:25:25] heaven when Michael and his angels
[1:25:27] fought against Lucifer and his angels.
[1:25:31] It first started and the first battle
[1:25:33] was in heaven.
[1:25:35] As I said, in heaven, but not in God's
[1:25:37] dwelling place.
[1:25:40] We hear of modern wear warfare.
[1:25:44] And we have no knowledge of the kind of
[1:25:47] weaponry that was used in this fierce
[1:25:51] struggle that ensued in heaven. We have
[1:25:55] no knowledge of it.
[1:25:58] The battle took place in a region that
[1:26:00] God permitted it to take place in the
[1:26:03] fourth seal.
[1:26:06] He said, "What is all what is this all
[1:26:09] coming to?"
[1:26:11] Said, "It's going back the way that it
[1:26:13] did. It started in heaven. It's coming
[1:26:16] to the end time." The end time battle.
[1:26:20] You know, here we are. We're in 206.
[1:26:23] We're soon coming to the end of this
[1:26:24] year.
[1:26:26] And I'm not a young man anymore, but I'm
[1:26:28] going to make some suggestions to you
[1:26:31] that may start your thoughts in a little
[1:26:34] different direction.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; People and a many, especially in the
[1:26:38] message as itself,
[1:26:41] I find that many people are waiting for
[1:26:43] some great destruction to come. And it
[1:26:46] may well be that way. But I'm suggesting
[1:26:50] to you today that
[1:26:53] the great destruction may all may
[1:26:55] already be here.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I was thinking
[1:27:02] just in the last few hours
[1:27:06] and I want to sing if the Lord allows us
[1:27:08] at the end of the service. I want to
[1:27:10] sing, "Oh my loving brother, when the
[1:27:13] world's on fire, don't you want God's
[1:27:16] bosom to be your pillow?
[1:27:19] I'd like to suggest, you know, they're
[1:27:22] waiting. Brother Brandon said he saw
[1:27:23] America just smoldering tree stumps.
[1:27:29] I don't want to be dramatical,
[1:27:32] but I suggest to you that that's already
[1:27:33] the case.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Trees being humans.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I have some statistics here from the
[1:27:42] National Health Council of America.
[1:27:48] I have it right here. I'll be reading it
[1:27:50] and I'll be putting some on the screen,
[1:27:53] but just to get your mind where mine is
[1:27:55] this morning.
[1:27:57] The statistics for United States is one
[1:28:01] in every four people have a mental
[1:28:04] disorder,
[1:28:06] have mental illness that is it it's ill
[1:28:10] to the point they can actually diagnose
[1:28:12] it and identify it. There are and what
[1:28:15] they're saying is there are those that
[1:28:16] cannot be identified
[1:28:19] and they're not counting that but that
[1:28:22] which can be identified and they have a
[1:28:25] variety of them different areas of
[1:28:27] mental illness. Mental illness a prophet
[1:28:31] 25 30 40 years ago said the time will
[1:28:35] come when there'll be imbalanced and
[1:28:38] neurotics filling the streets. The
[1:28:41] statistics I have here today say one in
[1:28:45] every four persons in the United States
[1:28:48] for a total of 57.7
[1:28:51] million
[1:28:53] of America
[1:28:55] is mentally ill
[1:28:58] and you get out of this church this
[1:29:00] morning and walk and Canada is
[1:29:02] absolutely no different and you can walk
[1:29:04] down the street and say one two three
[1:29:06] four one two three four one two three
[1:29:10] four.
[1:29:12] I hope you can't sit in the church and
[1:29:14] say 1 2 3 4.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; 1 2 3 4
[1:29:22] mentally ill.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; And the Malachi 4 speaks of the earth
[1:29:30] being burnt like an oven. From God's
[1:29:34] perspective and where he's looking, I
[1:29:37] can tell you the nation
[1:29:40] is smoldering stumps.
[1:29:45] People whose minds
[1:29:48] and whose lives have been reduced,
[1:29:51] they don't think they're capt. They
[1:29:53] don't maybe feel that way,
[1:29:56] but they have every kind of of crutch.
[1:30:00] They talk about religion being a crutch.
[1:30:03] What about all their drugs?
[1:30:06] What about all their pleasure? What
[1:30:08] about all the, you know, this mental
[1:30:10] exotic
[1:30:12] uh uh educational thing that's consumed
[1:30:15] people and they'll give up their
[1:30:17] families and give up their children?
[1:30:19] What about all this business that give
[1:30:21] up families, give up children, destroy
[1:30:23] homes? You know what I call it? A
[1:30:26] smoldering stump.
[1:30:28] Amen.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; The leaves of fellowship have been
[1:30:32] burned off.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; The joy has gone. They're being hyped
[1:30:38] on. Something is they have to be ppped
[1:30:40] up. Maybe not a a
[1:30:46] pill, maybe not a pill, maybe not a
[1:30:49] prescription, but something to entice
[1:30:52] them, to keep them moving, to keep them
[1:30:54] going forward, and to motivate them. and
[1:30:58] energize them.
[1:31:05] I think there's a great battle going on,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; a great struggle going on
[1:31:11] and there's there's only one there's
[1:31:13] only one remedy that I know
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; that is a message that has come and
[1:31:17] pulled the covers off of him, exposed
[1:31:20] him, exposed his methods, exposed
[1:31:23] everything about him so that there is a
[1:31:26] people who by virtue of the message have
[1:31:28] the eyes of Christ can look straight
[1:31:30] through and say, "You're not bluffing
[1:31:32] me. You might bluff a lot of people, but
[1:31:34] you're not bluffing me. I can actually
[1:31:38] see you. I see your tactics. I know your
[1:31:41] work. That's been right from the
[1:31:42] beginning, and it doesn't move me. You
[1:31:45] can't buffet me with that stuff.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just show you some slides
[1:31:55] and then we'll move forward.
[1:32:20] All right.
[1:32:25] Excuse me.
[1:32:33] Well, the brothers told me there's going
[1:32:35] to be an arrow here, but there is no
[1:32:37] arrow.
[1:32:43] All right. Thank you. Isn't this
[1:32:46] technology wonderful?
[1:32:54] So, we can perhaps dim the lights a
[1:32:55] little bit.
[1:32:57] Now we have received not the spirit of
[1:33:00] the world.
[1:33:03] That should be that first statement
[1:33:06] should be something that we feel good
[1:33:08] about. We have not received the spirit
[1:33:10] of the world. There is a spirit of the
[1:33:12] world and we have not received the
[1:33:14] spirit of the world.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; But the spirit which is of God. Why?
[1:33:19] That we might know the things that are
[1:33:22] freely given us of God. Why? Why? Why do
[1:33:25] we need to know the things that are
[1:33:27] freely given us of God? So that we will
[1:33:29] not be affected or afflicted by the
[1:33:31] spirit that is in the world.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:33:40] cannot receive because it seeth him not,
[1:33:43] neither knoweth him. But you know him,
[1:33:46] for he dwelleth with you, and shall be
[1:33:49] in you.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] where in time past you walked according
[1:33:54] to the course of this world, according
[1:33:57] to the prince of the power of the air,
[1:34:00] the spirit that now workketh in the
[1:34:03] children of disobedience. Listen
[1:34:05] friends, the environment that you and I
[1:34:07] are in every day, the environment that
[1:34:10] you are in contact with is an
[1:34:13] environment where the spirit that now
[1:34:15] workketh now workketh in the children of
[1:34:18] disobedience.
[1:34:21] Revelation 12 and 11.
[1:34:25] And you'll you'll recall this from the
[1:34:28] last couple services. And they
[1:34:31] I hope you can say and I overcame him
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; and by the word of my testimony
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and I love not my life unto the death.
[1:34:48] Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; And that's total surrendering.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Christians, brother Brandham says, are
[1:34:55] influenced from above. The Holy Ghost
[1:34:58] influences his church in this in this
[1:35:01] realm of mortal. The devil by these
[1:35:05] spirits influence man. Man, the next is
[1:35:08] angels and the next is God. Now, he said
[1:35:11] every mortal here is influenced by one
[1:35:14] of these two worlds. I'd like this
[1:35:16] congregation to uh in unison repeat that
[1:35:20] last line. Every mortal here is
[1:35:24] influenced by one of these two worlds.
[1:35:27] And I trust you can say from the very
[1:35:29] depths of your heart, I am influenced
[1:35:32] from the realm of a heaven from eternal
[1:35:35] realm. I'm influenced by a holy realm.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I'm influenced by the Holy Spirit and
[1:35:42] I'm under that influence today.
[1:35:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The devil
[1:35:47] doesn't want you to rejoice in that. You
[1:35:49] need to rejoice in that. You need to
[1:35:51] say, "Hallelujah. I'm influenced by the
[1:35:53] Holy Spirit of God.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Not just something in your mind, but a
[1:35:58] reality." And that influence changes my
[1:36:02] life. I have a life transforming power
[1:36:05] within me. And I feel it. I sense it. It
[1:36:08] happens in reality.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; It corrects me before I even make a
[1:36:12] wrong decision.
[1:36:14] Do you have that? Thank God for that.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You prayed and you felt
[1:36:19] moved to do one thing rather than
[1:36:21] another. You were going to do something
[1:36:23] and you felt a check. That was him. Oh,
[1:36:26] thank you, Lord. We have the spirit not
[1:36:30] that's in the world, but we have the
[1:36:32] spirit that is of God. You felt
[1:36:34] discouraged. You wanted to give up, but
[1:36:36] there was something inside of you that
[1:36:37] urged you on. Thank God for that spirit.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] Every mortal, every mortal, mortals are
[1:36:48] influenced from an outside world. I
[1:36:51] should understand by the grace of God, I
[1:36:54] deal with spirits. Those of you familiar
[1:36:56] with brother Brandham's ministry, he was
[1:36:59] in that realm almost all the time. He
[1:37:01] said, "I should know what I'm speaking
[1:37:03] of."
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And I look along through this dark mass
[1:37:07] of ga.
[1:37:09] Every once in a while you'll see a
[1:37:11] little light burning. Lights a burning.
[1:37:15] That's Christians in the darkness giving
[1:37:19] light.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You walk down the street in
[1:37:23] this dark mass of gaity and you'll see a
[1:37:26] little flicker,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; another little flicker. Have you been in
[1:37:30] a mall lately and on down you see a
[1:37:32] flicker and you know it's not the rest
[1:37:35] of the world. They're entirely
[1:37:37] different. They're like someone from
[1:37:39] another planet. They are. They came from
[1:37:42] God and they'll go back to God.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're from another place.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; We're not at home.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; We don't feel at home.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; We feel unwelcome.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; As Marilyn's song goes,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; I feel unwelcome.
[1:38:01] Not welcome
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; in this cold atmosphere.
[1:38:06] And I don't try to warm up to it.
[1:38:14] The sinner is influenced by a spirit
[1:38:16] because he is a he has a spirit and the
[1:38:19] wrong gives influence and the right
[1:38:22] gives influence and those who are uh
[1:38:25] dominated with blackness and separation
[1:38:28] are dominated from the underworld
[1:38:32] of devils. This age boasts of its
[1:38:36] tremendous stores of worldly goods.
[1:38:39] These are some selected
[1:38:41] statements out of the church ages now.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; And this 40 years ago was like it was
[1:38:50] written this morning.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And then I will go just into what the
[1:38:58] government has said.
[1:39:00] Here's a prophet's quote and then the
[1:39:03] government's quote. This age boasts of
[1:39:06] its tremendous stores of worldly goods,
[1:39:09] but the people are less happy than ever.
[1:39:14] This age boasts of its spiritual
[1:39:16] attainments, but the people are less
[1:39:19] sure of themselves than ever.
[1:39:22] This age boasts of better moral values,
[1:39:25] and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:39:28] since the flood. It talks about its
[1:39:32] knowledge and science, but it is
[1:39:34] fighting a losing battle in all fields.
[1:39:36] For the human mind and soul and spirit
[1:39:39] cannot comprehend or keep a breast with
[1:39:42] all the changes that have come upon the
[1:39:45] earth.
[1:39:47] In one generation, we've gone all the
[1:39:49] way from the horse and buggy age to the
[1:39:52] space age. And we are proud and boastful
[1:39:54] about it. But inside is a dark void
[1:39:57] cavern that is crying out in torment.
[1:40:02] Without a known reason, men's hearts are
[1:40:05] failing for fear. And the world is so
[1:40:07] darkened that this age could well be
[1:40:10] called the age of neurotics. It boasts
[1:40:15] but it cannot back it up. It cries peace
[1:40:17] and there is no peace. It cries that it
[1:40:20] has a greater amplitude
[1:40:23] of all things but it keeps burning with
[1:40:26] desire like an unsatisfied fire. There
[1:40:29] is no peace, sayith my God, to the
[1:40:32] wicked.
[1:40:36] Mental disorders are coming in the
[1:40:39] United States and internationally.
[1:40:42] And here's the government statistics. An
[1:40:45] estimated 26.2% of Americans
[1:40:49] aged 18 and older,
[1:40:52] about one in four adults suffer from a
[1:40:56] diagnosible mental disorder in a given
[1:41:00] year.
[1:41:02] When applied to the 204 US census
[1:41:05] residential population estimate for ages
[1:41:09] 18 and older, this figure translates to
[1:41:12] 57.7
[1:41:13] million people. This is the National
[1:41:16] Institute of Mental Health. 57.
[1:41:22] You might say, "Well, brother Biscll,
[1:41:23] are you trying to startle us?" No, I
[1:41:26] think we need to be awakened.
[1:41:29] that happens to be more people than we
[1:41:31] have in this country called Canada.
[1:41:34] That's almost double our entire
[1:41:36] population.
[1:41:38] And when you've had a prophet say, "We
[1:41:41] boast of this, but inwardly we're that.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; We've got all this spirituality and all
[1:41:47] this, you know,
[1:41:50] attainment."
[1:41:53] And you think that it isn't
[1:41:55] the evangelistic in evangelism and
[1:42:00] fundamental evangelism and and politics
[1:42:03] have become so homogenized. In fact is
[1:42:05] as of this last week
[1:42:08] they said that Hollywood is just having
[1:42:10] a whole awakening that they they they
[1:42:12] feel that they must make movies that are
[1:42:14] religious movies spiritual movies.
[1:42:18] They've got a whole movement called, you
[1:42:20] know, Hollywood stars that are born
[1:42:22] again and you can get their names
[1:42:26] and it's becoming just totally
[1:42:28] homogenized with the whole the whole
[1:42:31] spiritual uh television evangelism etc.
[1:42:36] this last two weeks before the elections
[1:42:41] uh the Senate and the House of
[1:42:43] Representatives elections here the whole
[1:42:46] country they're so they're so on edge
[1:42:49] and one of the leading
[1:42:53] pastor 14,000 people
[1:42:57] and you are well aware of it I'm not
[1:43:00] here just to bring these things to the
[1:43:01] service that happen to be reality
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; and living an unclean life with another
[1:43:07] homosexual
[1:43:09] and buying drugs,
[1:43:13] adamophines,
[1:43:16] and then the government gets worried
[1:43:18] because this may taint the election and
[1:43:20] have a negative effect on election. I'm
[1:43:23] not spending my time on these things. I
[1:43:25] just say that's the spirit of the world.
[1:43:27] And I don't care what label. They can
[1:43:29] call it Calvary this. They can call it
[1:43:32] redemption that. They can call it Holy
[1:43:34] Ghost this or whatever more. It's
[1:43:36] corrupt
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; to the core.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; A Catholic nun has just been sentenced
[1:43:44] to 30 years in prison for her direct
[1:43:48] participation in the genocide that took
[1:43:51] place in Rwanda,
[1:43:53] neighboring Congo, where many of our
[1:43:55] people come from, and actually had
[1:43:57] people reserved and and turned them
[1:44:00] loose to the people that were going to
[1:44:01] destroy them. And before her is two
[1:44:04] other nuns and another priest. They've
[1:44:06] all they're already in prison.
[1:44:11] People who trusted their lives have
[1:44:12] trusted their souls. You know what,
[1:44:14] friends? We're in another world.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; As believers, we're in another world.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; In all truth, they don't even belong
[1:44:23] here.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; We're not at home.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; This world's not my home.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to get better. Amen.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to burn, as the prophet
[1:44:33] Malachi says, as a fire.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And it'll be nothing but ashes under the
[1:44:38] feet of the righteous.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; And it is today. It's not going to be
[1:44:43] those are ashes. I see the things
[1:44:45] already burned. There's lives
[1:44:47] everywhere. Lives everywhere. Oh, they
[1:44:50] look physically better than I do. They
[1:44:52] may they may uh be prettier. They may be
[1:44:55] more handsome. They may be more
[1:44:57] educated. They may be more whatever.
[1:44:59] They may be more wealthy. They may be
[1:45:01] more who who knows what. And they can
[1:45:04] speak and meet you. But inside,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; it's a dark void. Inside there's no
[1:45:11] flickering light inside. There's no
[1:45:13] pillar of fire.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and put on as though you
[1:45:20] you don't know any of these things.
[1:45:21] You're in touch with it all the time.
[1:45:24] This happens to be the reality. And we
[1:45:26] have a prophet's voice that has already
[1:45:28] declared thus sayith the Lord. The whole
[1:45:31] thing, the whole church movement is
[1:45:33] going back under the federation of
[1:45:35] churches. Whether you know it or whether
[1:45:37] you see it or not, it's already been
[1:45:39] spoken. And thus it shall be.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; It'll all be tied together in one great
[1:45:44] big movement, one great big massive
[1:45:47] political and religious.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; And it's designed by devils.
[1:45:54] Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; And he who wrote out on the white horse
[1:45:57] is he who accomplished it because the
[1:45:59] scripture says all whose names are not
[1:46:03] in the book will actually worship him.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; They're not going to come to some image
[1:46:07] and bow down to an image. They're going
[1:46:09] to give obesence to him because he
[1:46:12] permeates. He came into the college. He
[1:46:14] came into the university. He came into
[1:46:16] the business. He came into the store. He
[1:46:19] came into the fashion industry. He came
[1:46:21] into the sports. He came into all kinds
[1:46:23] of things that were not evil in
[1:46:25] themselves, but he made them evil
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; because he threw the people off balance.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Good people.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; People who wanted God.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; What do you think about the people the
[1:46:44] masses that heard the Lord Jesus or the
[1:46:46] masses that came to the prophet's
[1:46:48] ministry? What do you what do you think
[1:46:50] about the people in the masses that came
[1:46:52] to the Lord Jesus and heard him? And the
[1:46:54] Bible says they marveled
[1:46:56] at the gracious words that came from his
[1:46:59] lips. But where were those people that
[1:47:03] marveled at the gracious words when they
[1:47:05] were when they were taking him to the
[1:47:06] cross? And the crowds, the same crowd
[1:47:08] said, "Crucify, crucify, crucify him."
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Because it never struck the soul.
[1:47:16] They were gone this way and then they're
[1:47:17] gone that way and then they're buffeted
[1:47:19] this way and buffeted. They got this
[1:47:21] idea then they got they they're into
[1:47:23] that inspiration into this thought.
[1:47:26] The stuff that takes place in churches
[1:47:29] today
[1:47:30] is just absolutely
[1:47:34] it's bizarre.
[1:47:36] You know, come and start with your
[1:47:38] coffee. They wanted us to right where
[1:47:40] the stairs go up to the balcony there.
[1:47:41] They wanted us to have a like a
[1:47:43] Starbucks in there.
[1:47:46] when we designed the church
[1:47:49] and one of the people who were designing
[1:47:50] the church said, "Yours is the only
[1:47:53] church I'm doing three.
[1:47:56] I'm doing three churches and yours is
[1:47:59] the only church that's not a gymnasium.
[1:48:03] The first thought is not a place to
[1:48:05] worship. The first thought is a place of
[1:48:07] sports. Right.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Where is the where is the uh uh you know
[1:48:14] where's the basketball hoop going to be
[1:48:15] on this end? Where's it going to be?
[1:48:17] Where's the marks in the floor going to
[1:48:18] be and where all these things? Then
[1:48:20] we'll work the church and the worship
[1:48:22] around that
[1:48:26] burning stumps
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; might be religious but it's burning
[1:48:31] stumps. And when a prophet, he said, you
[1:48:34] know, I've talked to people and they're
[1:48:36] kind of anxious that America will fall
[1:48:39] and be destroyed. They'll say,
[1:48:43] "When do you think it's going to be just
[1:48:45] burning stumps?"
[1:48:47] I just saw it smoldering. When do you
[1:48:49] think it's going to be? Cuz our mind is
[1:48:51] on some big atomic, you know, horrific
[1:48:55] thing. What's happening right now is
[1:48:58] worse than any atomic thing that can
[1:48:59] happen.
[1:49:01] Because men are and men and women both.
[1:49:04] They're dead while they still live.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; There's no hope.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching this not to give you a
[1:49:12] dark picture of what's out there. But
[1:49:13] you might as well realize it. That is
[1:49:15] what's out there. And that should give
[1:49:17] you more thanks, more thanksgiving of
[1:49:19] what it is you possess.
[1:49:22] We have not the spirit of the world,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; but we have another spirit that came
[1:49:26] from God and now is making known a word,
[1:49:29] revealing a word to you that makes a
[1:49:33] people not conquerors
[1:49:35] but more than conquerors. I hope I can
[1:49:38] get to it. Give me a few more minutes if
[1:49:40] you will please.
[1:49:43] Research suggests that mental illnesses
[1:49:46] are the result of a complex interaction
[1:49:48] of gen genetic, biological,
[1:49:52] personality and environmental factors.
[1:49:55] However, the brain
[1:49:57] is the final common pathway for the
[1:50:02] control of behavior,
[1:50:05] cognition, mood, and anxiety. And if you
[1:50:08] want to read
[1:50:10] brother Brandham's message, and you
[1:50:12] ought to, when you leave here,
[1:50:15] greatest battle ever fought, he said,
[1:50:17] "For every battle,
[1:50:19] there has to be a place chosen
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; by the opponents
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; for this battle to take place.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And there was a ground." He said, "It's
[1:50:29] called a no man's ground." and and
[1:50:31] between God, Michael and his angels
[1:50:34] fought with Lucifer and his angels. And
[1:50:37] they Lucifer was cast out of that level,
[1:50:40] that region, cast out to the earth. And
[1:50:42] he's here,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; absolutely here.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; There anybody who would deny that that
[1:50:48] Lucifer hasn't been cast down to the
[1:50:50] earth is themselves insane.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He's here. You see it everywhere.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Absolutely everywhere.
[1:51:01] And there had to be a place chosen. So
[1:51:04] there was a place chosen. They said it
[1:51:06] was the human mind. Brother Brandham
[1:51:09] says the human mind. The national
[1:51:12] statistic health of United States says
[1:51:14] there one pathway was the mind
[1:51:20] and that's where it is and he gains
[1:51:22] entrance into that mind.
[1:51:25] And they said
[1:51:27] the pathway, it's the final
[1:51:31] common
[1:51:33] pathway
[1:51:34] for what? The control behavior.
[1:51:38] You have a message. I'm bringing it to
[1:51:40] you this morning. We have a message. We
[1:51:42] have a prophet who uncovered him,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; uncovered his tactics, uncovered
[1:51:48] everything about him, exposed him, and
[1:51:49] says, "Here's how he moves.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; The battle's in your mind."
[1:51:54] And he went further than that. He says
[1:51:57] that's not the control tower for the
[1:51:59] believer. The control tower for the
[1:52:01] believer is in the soul.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. I'm going to
[1:52:06] preach straight and preach hard. We have
[1:52:09] good music, but it doesn't reach the
[1:52:11] soul. We have good singing, but it's not
[1:52:13] made for the soul. We have we have the
[1:52:16] Bible and the Bible and don't get me
[1:52:18] wrong now just reading the Bible doesn't
[1:52:20] necessarily go to the soul but the
[1:52:23] revelation of the Bible
[1:52:26] spoken by God
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; is made for the soul and then the soul
[1:52:32] becomes the control tower
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; and he says the the control tower in the
[1:52:39] soul it moves up through the five senses
[1:52:43] of the spirit which is memory,
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; imagination,
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; conscience,
[1:52:50] affection, and reasoning. And four of
[1:52:53] those five are all in the mind.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; And he says from the soul who's received
[1:52:58] the word of God, it goes up through
[1:53:00] those channels and takes control of your
[1:53:03] emotional realm.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; And then the emotional realm moves up
[1:53:09] through the five channels of the body.
[1:53:11] You're seeing, you're hearing, you're
[1:53:13] smelling, you're feeling in those five
[1:53:16] channels and takes control of them. Then
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; the man has become more than a
[1:53:23] conqueror.
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; We're not interested just conquering,
[1:53:31] you know, our little physical ailments
[1:53:33] or little things that bother us from day
[1:53:35] to day in work and whatever more. That's
[1:53:38] not what we're interested in conquering.
[1:53:39] We're interested in getting that
[1:53:41] revealed word down into the soul so it
[1:53:44] rises up and takes control of the spirit
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and then up and controls the body.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And now you have become more than a
[1:53:53] conqueror through Christ Jesus.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:06] At this time, the links between specific
[1:54:10] brain dysfunction and specific mental
[1:54:12] illnesses are not fully understood.
[1:54:18] Excuse me.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; We've been on the road a long time.
[1:54:23] Excuse me. We got a lot of very
[1:54:25] intellectual bis people and we have a
[1:54:28] lot of very sophisticated equipment,
[1:54:30] measurement equipment, but it's not
[1:54:32] completely known. And I'll say with what
[1:54:36] what they have in this world, it'll
[1:54:38] never be completely known.
[1:54:40] But God
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; who knew and knows you and knows every
[1:54:45] part of you. He knows how your mind
[1:54:47] works. He knows how your spirit and your
[1:54:50] your your inner being works. He knows
[1:54:52] how all the emotions work. He's given us
[1:54:54] a remedy.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Don't be too stiff and formal. I'm going
[1:55:06] to start dancing up here.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I'm so full of joy today. So thankful
[1:55:12] that before I was even born, God planned
[1:55:15] a message that would cope with this
[1:55:17] generation.
[1:55:19] And he says, "The end time message, the
[1:55:21] end time message has the answer to the
[1:55:24] end time problems and the end time
[1:55:26] conditions." We have the answer.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have the answer. You have
[1:55:31] the answer.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; You have the answer, friends.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching here to make you
[1:55:38] enthused, but I hope you do get
[1:55:40] enthused. I hope you get beside
[1:55:42] yourself.
[1:55:46] Just imagine if somebody here had just
[1:55:48] won, you know, some
[1:55:52] great prize or something. We'd all
[1:55:55] rejoice with them.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Well, we've won the prize.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; We've already got the prize. We've won
[1:56:01] the prize, friends. We've got the word
[1:56:04] that comes to the soul of the
[1:56:07] individual. The soul, the word that'll
[1:56:09] control every part.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:13] Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Are we what we want to be?
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:56:22] brother Ed, are you what you want to be?
[1:56:24] No.
[1:56:25] No. I'm still on my way.
[1:56:28] But I can tell you one thing. If this
[1:56:31] message hadn't come our way or my way,
[1:56:34] my home wouldn't be what it is. My
[1:56:37] family wouldn't be what it is. This
[1:56:39] church wouldn't be what it is unless the
[1:56:42] word had come your way. You where would
[1:56:44] you be? Where would your life be? You
[1:56:47] certainly wouldn't be here. Where would
[1:56:48] you be, Brother Michael? You'd still be
[1:56:52] beating your drums in the rock band.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; You might already be in a grave. Who
[1:56:58] knows? We certainly wouldn't be here.
[1:57:01] But here we are loving this
[1:57:03] righteousness, loving this holiness.
[1:57:05] Here we are rejoicing at this word. Oh
[1:57:08] my prophet said, "If if if I'm out of my
[1:57:12] mind, leave me this way."
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I think we're at the end here.
[1:57:35] Yes.
[1:57:37] even shut it off.
[1:57:43] All I can say to you friends
[1:57:56] is that there's coming an hour.
[1:57:59] I wasn't thinking what to say. I was
[1:58:01] thinking how to say it. There's coming
[1:58:03] an hour. And if all these other things
[1:58:05] have been prophesied and they if they've
[1:58:07] come right on quue,
[1:58:10] then this other will also
[1:58:13] and brother Brandham goes and I won't
[1:58:15] take the quote. We'll start this another
[1:58:17] service in the next service.
[1:58:20] He goes to the place second Corinthians
[1:58:23] I believe, I'm sorry, 2 Thessalonians 2.
[1:58:29] And maybe I'll just read it for you so
[1:58:32] you can go home with it.
[1:58:36] 2 Thessalonians 2 and I'll close with
[1:58:40] this
[1:58:44] verse 7.
[1:58:47] For the mystery of iniquity
[1:58:50] doth already workmen was already
[1:58:53] happening when Paul wrote this. The
[1:58:56] mystery of iniquity doth already work.
[1:59:00] Only he who now letth will let. And he
[1:59:05] who letth, he said, is the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; That is he who letth will now let
[1:59:14] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:59:17] way. And then
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; shall that wicked be revealed.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; In other words, he'll be made known.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; He'll be he'll be so exposed everybody
[1:59:28] will know it. Then the wicked will be
[1:59:30] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:59:32] with the spirit of his mouth, which is
[1:59:34] his word. And I can tell you, he's being
[1:59:37] consumed right now. He's being defeated
[1:59:40] right now. As you believe the word that
[1:59:42] comes to you, Satan is being defeated.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; And he's he's being rendered helpless.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; I would like everybody in the whole
[1:59:49] congregation to at least believe that
[1:59:51] with all your heart. He's being rendered
[1:59:53] helpless.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; You have the tool.
[2:00:00] You have you have been equipped.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:00:06] [Music]
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; And he says when he who now letth
[2:00:13] be taken out of the way,
[2:00:17] brother Raptize that to the church going
[2:00:19] home, the bride going home. you will go
[2:00:23] when he who's allowing and permitting.
[2:00:33] I expect that many of you
[2:00:37] I trust also that I will live for that
[2:00:39] time.
[2:00:42] But you will see a time.
[2:00:44] Look at look at the scene. I described
[2:00:46] it a wee bit today. I spent quite a bit
[2:00:48] of time describing. You might think that
[2:00:49] was a very negative service for brother
[2:00:51] for brother Biscll to preach. No, it's a
[2:00:53] very real service. Those those
[2:00:56] conditions are real. Now, I want I'm
[2:00:59] going to take it a step further with
[2:01:00] you. Everything I've described and I
[2:01:02] couldn't even scratch the surface.
[2:01:06] We should have our staff sergeant,
[2:01:08] Brother Sean Maloney,
[2:01:11] stand
[2:01:14] to maybe deal with just last week
[2:01:18] and every week. and I don't think I'll
[2:01:19] be out of place. He says, "Right here,
[2:01:21] just in an area of this city, there's
[2:01:24] several stabbings,
[2:01:25] shootings, several bank robberies
[2:01:28] happening every week
[2:01:31] that they have to deal with."
[2:01:34] Now,
[2:01:36] these things are happening
[2:01:39] with even the restraining force of him
[2:01:42] who's still letting.
[2:01:44] Amen.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; But when he who letth
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way,
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; you know what? You will have 100% hell.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Hell on earth.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; And he who's been cast down. He wanted
[2:02:02] to ascend and he has ascended thus far
[2:02:06] into the earth
[2:02:08] until the language of the people is just
[2:02:13] unbelievable and indescribable and
[2:02:15] cannot be repeated. And if their
[2:02:17] language is that what about their
[2:02:19] thoughts?
[2:02:23] My neighbor
[2:02:26] supposed to be a
[2:02:28] they're wealthy.
[2:02:32] Big rock star
[2:02:36] live in a mansion.
[2:02:40] Big mansion.
[2:02:42] His wife curse my wife out.
[2:02:47] Imagine my wife. Who could be more
[2:02:49] timid?
[2:02:51] who could be more, you know, just kind,
[2:02:55] she hadn't got a got a mean streak in
[2:02:57] her body
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; and have, you know, a woman.
[2:03:02] Of course, little later they once they
[2:03:05] came over and brought a bouquet of
[2:03:07] flowers, but that was because they
[2:03:09] wanted to have a movie. They sorted they
[2:03:12] they uh had decided on using their home
[2:03:17] for a movie which was just shot here
[2:03:20] last year and they were they they want
[2:03:23] to let us know that the lights are going
[2:03:24] to be blazing all night all night till 7
[2:03:27] in the morning and so on and so forth.
[2:03:28] It was fine. There was there was no
[2:03:30] noise. There was no problem for us. But
[2:03:32] then for for that, you know, they wanted
[2:03:34] to bring over a nice bouquet of flowers.
[2:03:37] When I saw the flowers, I said, 'Well,
[2:03:40] something's happening.
[2:03:43] You know, I don't know what's happening.
[2:03:45] Oh, she says they're shooting a movie
[2:03:46] over there, so that's it. Now we know
[2:03:49] what it's all about.
[2:03:51] But but but you know, there's no cause,
[2:03:53] there's no nothing. You say, if that
[2:03:55] comes out of a person's mouth, what's in
[2:03:57] their mind?
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; What's in their heart?
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And you know what it is?
[2:04:03] Ashes.
[2:04:05] Malachi's prophecy and the messenger of
[2:04:08] Malachi here come told us gone.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends,
[2:04:18] my closing comment just now to this
[2:04:20] congregation.
[2:04:22] There will be a moment
[2:04:25] when he who's still led
[2:04:30] will be taken out of the way.
[2:04:32] the Holy Spirit of God.
[2:04:36] What you see and what you're in contact
[2:04:38] with that is existing with with even
[2:04:41] under the restraint
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit of God. But when he
[2:04:47] is taken out of the way, what will you
[2:04:49] have? I'll say to this congregation, oh
[2:04:51] God may go down into eternity, you do
[2:04:54] not want to be here.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; You want to be gone. Amen.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; And that is my stern, solemn
[2:05:06] counsel to you today. Let not a man or
[2:05:09] woman or young person or child
[2:05:13] be caught here when he who now letth
[2:05:18] will let until until he be taken out of
[2:05:22] the way.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; I'd like the musicians to come, please.
[2:05:28] I want you to think soberly, not as a
[2:05:31] song.
[2:05:33] Oh my loving brother,
[2:05:37] when the world's on fire, I changed that
[2:05:40] a wee bit. Oh my loving brother,
[2:05:44] the world is on fire.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Don't you want God's bosom
[2:05:51] to be your pillow?
[2:05:54] Oh, hide me over
[2:05:58] in the rock of ages.
[2:06:01] Rock of aes
[2:06:03] cleft for me.
[2:06:06] Oh my loving brother and sister. When
[2:06:10] the world's on fire,
[2:06:14] don't you want God's boo
[2:06:18] to be your pillar?
[2:06:23] Hide me over
[2:06:27] in the rock of aes
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:32] rock of aes
[2:06:35] [Music]
[2:06:39] and that rock of revelation is the rock
[2:06:41] of ages. you maybe need to say this
[2:06:44] morning.
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:50] If you're sitting here and you're
[2:06:51] saying, you know, I didn't quite
[2:06:53] understand it all, but there's a
[2:06:56] sobriety. There's a seriousness that has
[2:06:58] come upon me.
[2:07:02] Surrender to that.
[2:07:04] That's him. That's he who's still
[2:07:07] letting he's allowing all these things
[2:07:09] to take place. and you're going to be in
[2:07:11] contact with it tomorrow and maybe yet
[2:07:13] today. You may go to a restaurant,
[2:07:15] you'll hear the booming.
[2:07:17] Young ladies walking around
[2:07:20] exposing their bodies
[2:07:23] to good serious believers can't even go
[2:07:26] to those places anymore. Isn't that a
[2:07:29] tragedy? Isn't that a tragedy? Appealing
[2:07:32] to offbalance somebody.
[2:07:35] Oh,
[2:07:37] what a time we're living in. if they
[2:07:40] only knew
[2:07:42] and they haven't heard maybe what you've
[2:07:44] heard this morning.
[2:07:47] I say to you in the name of the Lord,
[2:07:48] you do not want to be here
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; when he is lifted from the earth. And
[2:07:54] quite frankly,
[2:07:56] it seems to me that he is lifting.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; The restraints have been let go.
[2:08:06] There are no bars held.
[2:08:10] How else do you
[2:08:15] How else do you interpret? How can you
[2:08:18] even begin to determine what is taking
[2:08:21] place?
[2:08:26] I don't know. I don't even know how to
[2:08:29] say it. But Satan is making more access
[2:08:32] and more access
[2:08:35] Brother Brandham said
[2:08:37] the people were saved from movies so
[2:08:41] they would not think of going to a
[2:08:43] theater. said, "The devil pulled one
[2:08:45] over to you and brought it into your
[2:08:46] home by way of television." And sitting
[2:08:50] there,
[2:08:51] a leader of the of the government of the
[2:08:54] United States stood up and I heard or
[2:08:57] read his his article or heard him, I
[2:09:00] can't remember just now. And he said,
[2:09:03] "For us to believe, for us as leaders to
[2:09:06] believe that we can subject our young
[2:09:09] people." And he began to name it off to
[2:09:11] how many thousand murders and how many
[2:09:14] thousand adulteries and how many
[2:09:16] thousand divorces and broken homes and
[2:09:19] all of this violence. He said to believe
[2:09:21] that we can expose them to that and have
[2:09:23] them mentally healthy is to believe that
[2:09:26] we send healthy people into contaminated
[2:09:30] physically contaminated with all kinds
[2:09:32] of virus and sickness and disease and
[2:09:34] have them go in there and come out
[2:09:35] healthy.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Does that take a smart person? Can
[2:09:40] anybody figure that out? We can figure
[2:09:42] that out. Our great leaders can't figure
[2:09:44] that out.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; They can, but it's money.
[2:09:49] It's the wealth. It's the taxes. It's
[2:09:51] the pressure. It's all the rest of it.
[2:09:53] This world is designed for the burning
[2:09:56] friends.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; And it will. And he that letth will let
[2:10:00] until he be taken out of the way.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; And when he's taken out of the way, my
[2:10:06] precious friends, those that I've
[2:10:08] journeyed with for a long time, I do not
[2:10:11] feel worthy, but I want to go also. I
[2:10:14] want to be out of here when it's when
[2:10:16] it's left this way. I thank God for this
[2:10:18] glorious message that we have.
[2:10:22] Let's stand.
[2:10:24] We'll sing the first verse, please.
[2:10:28] Oh, the judgement
[2:10:33] days coming.
[2:10:38] I am
[2:10:41] [Music]

[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:36] for
[2:11:37] Listen to the words in these next two
[2:11:39] verses. and the sound
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:48] and I
[2:11:53] might
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:04] be Heat. Heat.
[2:12:16] Heat. Heat.
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:28] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:38] Es
[2:12:45] for me.
[2:12:49] [Music]
[2:12:52] I'll sing it. Poor lost sinners
[2:12:57] [Music]
[2:12:59] will be crying
[2:13:05] for the home
[2:13:08] they'll never see
[2:13:14] but they're ransomed.
[2:13:18] They will be singing.
[2:13:22] Oh rock of aes
[2:13:25] [Music]
[2:13:27] cleft for me.
[2:13:30] Oh my loving brother. Sing it with me.
[2:13:35] When the world's on fire,
[2:13:40] you are God's
[2:13:50] mighty
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:14:00] God
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:05] for me.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; You know, we have quite a few people in
[2:14:09] this church, but I've got to ask you to
[2:14:12] take these things so seriously that you
[2:14:14] don't lose yourself in the crowd just
[2:14:16] because you're one of a big group of
[2:14:18] people. Don't lose yourself. You are an
[2:14:20] individual before God.
[2:14:23] And I was giving so much thought to
[2:14:24] this, I got thinking about the
[2:14:27] the rich man. I don't know how rich he
[2:14:30] was, but he had Lazarus begging at his
[2:14:33] gate.
[2:14:35] And we we had it at the at the at the
[2:14:40] family camp,
[2:14:42] but it was all fresh to me again. I have
[2:14:44] him here in my notes.
[2:14:47] I thought, how much awareness is there
[2:14:48] after this? He who letth will let until
[2:14:52] he be taken out of the way. How much
[2:14:54] awareness is this after a person departs
[2:14:58] and comes into a place? And this is what
[2:15:01] he said. He remembered he had five
[2:15:04] brethren.
[2:15:05] I got five brethren. I got five
[2:15:08] brothers. He says, "And they're all
[2:15:10] still at my father's home. They're in my
[2:15:12] father's home." And he knew the answer
[2:15:14] was I need somebody to go to them.
[2:15:18] And if I can't go back,
[2:15:21] please send Lazarus. Send him back
[2:15:26] and let him go and tell my brothers.
[2:15:29] So he said, "So they won't have to come
[2:15:30] to this place of torment." He had his
[2:15:33] full mental capacity.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; He knew the answer. He knew what he had
[2:15:39] missed. He knew where he had missed it.
[2:15:42] And he knew who had the answer. Send
[2:15:44] Lazarus back. And all of that
[2:15:47] consciousness,
[2:15:50] all that awareness came back to him.
[2:15:54] But it was too late. It's late. Jesus
[2:15:57] did not tell that to tell some little
[2:16:00] mystical story. He told her because it
[2:16:03] was absolute truth. That's right.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "My brother, my sister, take this
[2:16:09] message more serious after today than
[2:16:11] you've ever taken it.
[2:16:13] Set your life in a certain direction so
[2:16:15] this becomes your daily diet.
[2:16:18] Feed upon this word. Feed upon this
[2:16:20] message. Hear it. I say hear it.
[2:16:24] [Music]
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're here
[2:16:30] and God's dealing with you. I wouldn't
[2:16:33] dare close this service and just dismiss
[2:16:35] you and tell you to shake hands and go
[2:16:37] home when you know perhaps in your own
[2:16:40] self.
[2:16:41] This is my time and God's dealing with
[2:16:44] me
[2:16:46] and I'm determined I'm not going to miss
[2:16:48] it. I may be played around a wee bit,
[2:16:50] but I determined I got to be serious
[2:16:52] with this. I want you to do it today.
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:01] We'll sing the last verse.
[2:17:04] who are lost sinners.
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:09] They will be crying
[2:17:14] for the
[2:17:16] world.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Evercy was a wonderful place he went to
[2:17:22] prepare. under
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:32] Christ
[2:17:37] for me.
[2:17:39] [Music]
[2:17:40] Oh my brother,
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:49] our fire
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:55] to the
[2:18:00] higher
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:04] of the
[2:18:09] rock of
[2:18:14] for me.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; I've done my part, people.
[2:18:21] And now there's two others that will do
[2:18:23] their part. One is the Holy Spirit and
[2:18:26] the other one is you.
[2:18:28] Whatever he's saying to you,
[2:18:32] don't deny him.
[2:18:34] Don't deny this lovely Lord Jesus.
[2:18:38] Give yourself to him. so completely, so
[2:18:40] unreservedly.
[2:18:42] You may want to kneel and pray. You may
[2:18:45] want to come forward and pray. You may
[2:18:47] want to give your life to Christ
[2:18:50] if you have not already done so.
[2:18:54] If you've been here in the church and
[2:18:56] you've grown up here and
[2:18:59] it's just been kind of a put on and
[2:19:00] you've just but it hasn't been real to
[2:19:03] you inside.
[2:19:05] [Music]
[2:19:07] Why don't you surrender to him now?
[2:19:10] Your altar is the heart or your heart is
[2:19:13] the altar.
[2:19:16] You can raise your hand.
[2:19:18] Do whatever you think you should do.
[2:19:22] But at this time it's between you and
[2:19:24] him.
[2:19:26] And I'm going to pray for you. Everyone
[2:19:29] who wishes to become a part of this
[2:19:32] prayer say, "Oh God,
[2:19:34] I want to be identified with this
[2:19:36] prayer.
[2:19:38] Father, throughout this week, as I was
[2:19:42] so moved,
[2:19:44] as I pondered these things deep within
[2:19:46] me and seeking to break through the
[2:19:50] tradition of what the what we've been
[2:19:54] taught or what we've learned to believe
[2:19:57] to really hear exactly what your prophet
[2:20:00] messenger has said and what the word of
[2:20:03] God declares
[2:20:06] and much of it, Lord, is difficult. ult
[2:20:08] perhaps to understand clearly but the
[2:20:10] time comes the season arrives and one
[2:20:14] thing we do know oh God we know that you
[2:20:18] have been present with us in the service
[2:20:20] today that you have reached out and you
[2:20:24] have sent your spirit you've dispensed
[2:20:26] him and he's touching the lives and
[2:20:30] speaking and his voice is heard and it's
[2:20:33] being very clear Lord and you're calling
[2:20:37] some Say, "Come to me.
[2:20:40] Come to me
[2:20:42] with all your heart.
[2:20:44] I'm calling for your heart. I'm calling
[2:20:48] for you to come and follow me. Follow me
[2:20:50] and I'll make you pissards of men."
[2:20:54] Lord, I thought so much about your
[2:20:56] footsteps,
[2:20:58] those
[2:21:00] blood stained footsteps,
[2:21:02] and desiring to be a true disciple,
[2:21:05] Lord, and have everything that would be
[2:21:08] hindering
[2:21:10] removed out of the way. I pray that
[2:21:13] well, I prayed for myself. I pray for
[2:21:15] everyone that is here under the sound of
[2:21:17] my voice and those that may be in other
[2:21:19] countries around the world, Lord, and
[2:21:21] streaming at this moment. Step into that
[2:21:23] room. Step into that building where
[2:21:25] they're gathered. Step in, I pray,
[2:21:27] further than the building, but into
[2:21:29] their very hearts, into their lives,
[2:21:31] into every soul here, oh God. Not just
[2:21:34] in the mind, and not just in the ears
[2:21:36] and not just in their emotional realm,
[2:21:38] but down into the soul. Reach down
[2:21:40] there, oh God. I cannot do it, but you
[2:21:43] can do it.
[2:21:44] I pray that you will change lives,
[2:21:48] transform them by transforming power,
[2:21:51] and may this service be a preparation
[2:21:55] for the next one to come. Oh Lord, take
[2:21:58] this church as I heard our brother
[2:22:00] Nathaniel pray for a revival. I pray
[2:22:03] you'll move it in a mighty sweep of the
[2:22:06] Holy Spirit of God. We love you. We love
[2:22:09] your message. We love the way you speak
[2:22:12] to us and deal with us, Lord. We're here
[2:22:15] now, Father. And I commit this word to
[2:22:19] you. And I pray that as the people feel
[2:22:22] to be dismissed, they may be dismissed
[2:22:25] with your grace
[2:22:27] that you will go with them. May the
[2:22:29] words and the atmosphere of the service
[2:22:31] linger long in their heart. And Lord,
[2:22:35] may we make no excuse for ourselves, but
[2:22:38] may we face your word straight in the
[2:22:41] face, oh God. And may we make our
[2:22:43] declaration and our confession. We ask,
[2:22:47] Father, you forgive us in our failings,
[2:22:51] in our wrongs, and whatever we have done
[2:22:53] or said or committed. Forgive us, I
[2:22:56] pray. And as we confess now, the wrong
[2:22:59] is sent down into the bleach of your
[2:23:02] blood and it is annihilated and
[2:23:04] forgotten into your sea of
[2:23:06] forgetfulness. And take this people, I
[2:23:08] pray, to another level of spiritual
[2:23:11] living. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[2:23:15] ask it. Amen.
[2:23:18] [Music]
[2:23:21] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy
[2:23:29] voice and
[2:23:33] I love to be.
[2:23:38] Here's the desire
[2:23:43] [Music]
[2:23:46] of
[2:23:48] every
[2:23:50] [Music]
[2:23:59] [Applause]
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:02] near
[2:24:06] to the Oh,
[2:24:18] here
[2:24:20] [Music]
[2:24:23] Lord
[2:24:26] to thy preious.
[2:24:36] Hallelujah.
[2:24:38] [Music]
[2:24:39] I'm going to dismiss you in the name of
[2:24:40] our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:24:43] Just ask you to you obey the Lord and
[2:24:47] when you leave, please don't visit out
[2:24:49] in the foyer. We like to leave it quiet,
[2:24:52] Reverend. And this is where people pray
[2:24:54] and God speaks to them. And if you feel
[2:24:57] that you want to find a place and
[2:24:59] meditate and have prayer or need prayer,
[2:25:03] you may come forward. That would be
[2:25:05] fine. But you're dismissed in Jesus
[2:25:08] name. God bless you.
[2:25:11] Draw me nearer,
[2:25:14] nearerless
[2:25:21] to the cross
[2:25:23] where throwing
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:31] nearer,
[2:25:34] nearer,
[2:25:36] nearer. Blessed Lord
[2:25:41] to thy preious.
[2:25:45] [Music]
[2:27:01] Thank you for
[2:27:15] Jesus.
[2:27:20] [Music]
[2:27:32] word of God.
[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:39] That is how we receive our overs.
