[13:31] Jesus

[13:36] to me.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is he not faithful? He said,
[13:44] "Where two or three are gathered in his
[13:46] name, there we are. There he is in his
[13:49] in our midst." Brother Lair, I was
[13:51] thinking of you and your prayer request
[13:52] and the song. Brother Larry Codle has a
[13:56] prayer request here for his mother in
[13:58] Florida who's in the hospital this
[14:00] morning with dizziness and blockage. But
[14:03] Larry, he's faithful. He'll meet your
[14:04] need. Amen. I I truly believe that as a
[14:06] witness on my heart. And uh Brother
[14:10] Weathers has a prayer request here for
[14:12] his daughter in Louisiana.
[14:14] She's in the hospital. She has been in
[14:16] the hospital for 3 days with an
[14:18] intestinal virus. She's not able to keep
[14:21] any liquids down. if things don't
[14:22] improve, uh, she'll have to go back into
[14:25] the hospital. So, we want to remember
[14:29] remember these needs. If you've got a
[14:30] needs on your heart, why don't we stand
[14:32] as we go to prayer, brother Kim, if you
[14:34] would come. He is faithful. Amen. Do you
[14:37] believe that?
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's let's go to prayer, brother
[14:41] Kim.
[14:44] [Music]
[14:51] Father, we bow before you this morning,
[14:53] Lord. So thankful, Lord, to be able to
[14:55] come into your presence,
[14:58] Lord. You've been so faithful, Lord.
[15:02] You've been so good, Lord. Lord, even
[15:04] when we ourselves have failed in our
[15:06] hearts, Lord, but yet you are faithful,
[15:09] Lord.
[15:10] Lord, you've carried us through so many
[15:12] things, Father. You've kept us in the
[15:15] valley. You've kept us on the mountain.
[15:18] Father, we're so thankful for your grace
[15:21] this morning and your keeping power.
[15:24] And Father, we have needs among us this
[15:26] morning. And we pray, Lord Jesus, that
[15:29] you would move up and down each aisle,
[15:31] Lord. Stop at every seat, Lord. You know
[15:35] the very meditation of our heart, Lord,
[15:37] and what's on our hearts this morning.
[15:40] We ask for brother Codle's mother, Lord
[15:42] Jesus, that you would touch her, Father.
[15:44] Have your way in her life, Lord. We pray
[15:48] for little sister Lily this morning,
[15:50] Lord, and asking, Lord Jesus, that you
[15:53] would touch her, Lord, that you would
[15:55] curse that virus that's within her, Lord
[15:57] Jesus. And we'll just wait to hear the
[16:00] testimony of the wonderful things you're
[16:02] doing in her life, Lord Jesus.
[16:05] And now this morning, Father, we just
[16:07] want to quieten ourselves at your feet.
[16:09] this morning and hear your instruction,
[16:11] Lord, to know better how to come out and
[16:14] how to go in and how to serve you and
[16:16] how to please you, Lord Jesus. May you
[16:19] anoint the minister, Father, as we know
[16:21] you will. May you just completely set
[16:23] them to one side that you can speak to
[16:25] us this morning, Lord Jesus. Bless our
[16:28] time together. We pray in Jesus name.
[16:31] Amen.
[16:32] [Music]
[16:49] Amen. God bless you. We've got some
[16:50] visitors, out of town visitors we want
[16:52] to make mention of. We've got uh Lydia
[16:55] Isabelle from Florida and also Linda
[16:58] Wood from Ohio. May we get you to stand?
[17:01] just recognize you. God bless you to
[17:04] have you.
[17:09] And uh BCA has an annual spring event
[17:12] coming up in May. Information for uh
[17:16] both is on the uh bulletin board. So you
[17:19] can get that in the back. And also we
[17:20] want to make mention only one service on

[17:25] of your Bible May 18th and May 25th
[17:29] because of the uh Victoria and Memorial
[17:31] weekends and due to borders and such. So
[17:34] that's May 18th and May 25th. We're only
[17:37] going to have one service. We're going
[17:39] to turn the service immediately to
[17:40] Brother Red as he comes. Let's sing that
[17:43] little chorus. I just want to please the
[17:44] Lord.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; I just want to please
[17:53] the Lord.
[17:58] Be his will in every way.
[18:05] to be lost in his presence.
[18:09] [Music]
[18:11] Found in his likeness
[18:14] to hear say well done
[18:18] someday.
[18:22] If I want to
[18:28] [Music]
[18:31] be his inst
[18:37] [Music]
[18:39] I see his presence
[18:43] now in his likeness.
[18:49] [Music]
[18:52] Let's just sing it once again.
[18:55] I just want to be
[18:59] the Lord.
[19:04] He is will
[19:10] be lost in his presence.
[19:16] found in his likeness.
[19:21] [Music]
[19:26] Actually, I requested that we would have
[19:28] this course sung because uh because of
[19:31] the line lost in his presence and found
[19:35] in his likeness because that's what I'm
[19:37] going to be coming to in a little bit.
[19:40] Uh maybe we'd just uh let's just sing it
[19:42] another uh time or two because the uh
[19:45] children are coming in getting settled
[19:47] and then I I don't want any disturbance
[19:50] or as little as possible because I want
[19:52] to show you uh video and some slides a
[19:57] PowerPoint uh what we just received from
[20:00] China and uh it is just so moving you
[20:05] want to see it. You want to see it
[20:07] prayerfully and quietly.
[20:10] Uh and I pray that the Holy Spirit will
[20:12] make it such a reality to you. Uh it's
[20:15] almost as though it's overtaking us,
[20:19] the move of God in that in that country.
[20:22] It's just phenomenal. Absolutely
[20:24] phenomenal. And I want to I want to
[20:27] share that with you because we are such
[20:29] a a part. We're one. It's one body.
[20:33] Amen.
[20:36] That's good. I'm just looking for that
[20:39] response. All right, let's just sing it
[20:41] again. Brother Jason plays
[20:49] [Music]
[20:54] his will every way
[21:00] to be lost in his presence.
[21:05] out in his likeness
[21:08] to hear him say, "Well done."
[21:14] Once again,
[21:16] I just want to be my Lord.
[21:22] [Music]
[21:25] Be in his will every way. every way
[21:31] to be lost in his presence.
[21:36] Found in your likeness
[21:39] to hear
[21:41] well done.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; All right, we can just have the lights
[21:50] dimmed and we're going to see about a
[21:52] six minute portion of what we just
[21:56] received from China.
[21:59] You may want to see it.
[22:09] [Applause]
[22:22] Wonderful, isn't it? Amen.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; Uh
[22:27] I'm sure your heart is moved and as mine
[22:29] is. That's receiving the word of God in
[22:32] simplicity.
[22:34] That's the way we want to keep it.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way we need to keep it.
[22:42] And so I just feel so honored, so
[22:45] privileged.
[22:47] And actually
[22:49] uh I'll just share something personal
[22:51] with you. I feel just a a wee bit
[22:54] deprived
[22:56] because they won't take any help from
[22:58] us.
[23:01] They said the Chinese Chinese
[23:05] print the books for the chi for China.
[23:08] They're just now having a meeting in a
[23:11] few days in May.
[23:14] They're expecting about 30 ministers.
[23:17] Hey,
[23:18] &gt;&gt; just short time ago we couldn't find
[23:19] one.
[23:21] They're expecting 30 ministers and
[23:24] they're not wanting Brother Murphy.
[23:26] They're not wanting anyone else. They
[23:28] Nobody from oversees this is Chinese for
[23:33] China. We have the burden. And all the
[23:36] renovations that went on there, they did
[23:38] it. They provided.
[23:41] And uh
[23:44] I think I can just tell you that uh I
[23:47] was I was
[23:49] asked
[23:51] uh what should we do? Because the
[23:55] Chinese people themselves have out of
[23:58] their poverty
[23:59] have given funds and have given their
[24:02] offerings to spread the message. They
[24:05] want to spread the message in China so
[24:08] urgently and so such a great burden on
[24:11] their heart. They have pulled together
[24:14] over $20,000 US
[24:18] and they just want to know how is the
[24:21] best way and look looking for some
[24:23] guidance from us. We've been doing it a
[24:26] long time and uh I just say
[24:31] God bless them.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; My prayers are with them. Our prayers
[24:36] are with them and I know that as your
[24:38] heart is touched and moved, you won't
[24:40] forget tomorrow to pray for them in the
[24:43] coming days and they don't know when
[24:47] the authorities or
[24:49] difficulties will come. They already
[24:51] have financial difficulties, all kinds
[24:53] of things like that, but they don't know
[24:55] when they may, you know, be uh even
[25:00] taken or imprisoned or whatever more.
[25:03] and that and and so while we sit here in
[25:05] this freedom and comfort, let's not take
[25:06] it for granted. Let's thank God we can
[25:09] hear be here and do this. Can you say
[25:11] amen to that? Let's stand and let's
[25:15] let's let's sing what they were singing.
[25:17] Uh
[25:19] &gt;&gt; true.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. God ever true. Let's just
[25:22] join with them and sing that
[25:30] changing me.
[25:32] changing you.
[25:35] We have love with open heart.
[25:40] Oh, let the word of God.
[25:46] Word of God
[25:48] ever.
[25:51] Changing me,
[25:53] changing you.
[25:56] We have come with all their heart. Oh,
[26:01] let the word of God.
[26:06] Let's just bow in prayer. Our heavenly
[26:09] father, you are indeed our father and we
[26:13] have been uh instructed by our lord
[26:16] Jesus Christ to come and we approach
[26:20] you. Our father which art in heaven,
[26:23] hallowed be thy name. Thy will be done
[26:26] on earth as it is in heaven. This is our
[26:28] prayer. We pray you'll forgive us our
[26:31] wrong. Forgive us our failings. Forgive
[26:34] us our sin or anything that may stain
[26:38] the garment of righteousness. Remove it
[26:41] from us. I pray by a supernatural
[26:45] cleansing. May the washing of the water
[26:48] of the word remove anything that would
[26:51] prevent you or hinder you or grieve you.
[26:54] remove it from us, oh God. And I pray
[26:57] that you will move upon with a sweep, a
[27:00] fresh sweep of the Holy Holy Spirit of
[27:04] God within the congregation. Oh God, I
[27:08] pray that they will receive instruction
[27:10] and we will receive it with open heart.
[27:12] Oh God, speak, Father, and we're
[27:15] prepared to say, and now and thy servant
[27:19] heareth it. You speak and we will do.
[27:22] For your prophet has said, "If we do not
[27:24] do the word, if we do not do it, then we
[27:27] don't believe it." We are here as
[27:29] believers, oh God, to believe your word,
[27:33] use, oh God, I pray, the vessel now as I
[27:36] stand behind the pullpit to deliver what
[27:39] you have placed upon my heart and may it
[27:41] be received into good ground and bring
[27:44] forth a hundfold. I ask in the name of
[27:47] Jesus Christ.
[27:49] Amen. And amen. Amen. God bless you. If
[27:53] you'd like to take your Bible and read
[27:55] along uh with me, please. I'm going to
[27:58] be reading from Genesis the first
[28:01] chapter, very familiar, verses 26, 27,
[28:07] and then into the second chapter. We'll
[28:10] read a few selected verses as well.
[28:18] May God bless us as we read.
[28:22] Genesis 1:26. And God said, "Let us make
[28:25] man in our image, after our likeness,
[28:29] and let them have dominion over the fish
[28:32] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[28:34] air, and over the cattle, and over all
[28:37] the earth, and every creeping thing that
[28:41] creepeth upon the earth."
[28:43] So God created man in his own image. In
[28:48] the image of God created he him.
[28:51] Male and female created he them.
[28:56] Genesis 2. Then in verse 7.
[29:00] And the Lord God formed man out of the
[29:02] dust of the earth of the dust of the
[29:04] ground and breathed into his nostrils
[29:08] the breath of life. and man became a
[29:11] living soul. Verses 21
[29:15] uh down to 24.
[29:25] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[29:28] fall upon Adam, and he slept, and he
[29:32] took one of his ribs and closed up the
[29:35] flesh there instead thereof. And the rib
[29:38] which the Lord God had taken from man
[29:42] made he a woman and brought her unto the
[29:45] man. And Adam said, "This is now bone of
[29:48] my bones and flesh of my flesh. She
[29:52] shall be called woman because she was
[29:54] taken out of man. Therefore shall a man
[29:58] leave his father and his mother and
[30:00] shall cleave unto his own wife, and they
[30:03] shall be one flesh." May God bless his
[30:07] word as you have your seat.
[30:16] The Bible is a really a sphere. It's
[30:19] more than a sphere. It's also a it's a
[30:22] spiritual
[30:26] uh it's a spiritual universe.
[30:30] If you took your Bible and joined the
[30:33] front and the back together such as I
[30:36] have, you have in the beginning a
[30:40] creation of a heaven and an earth. And
[30:43] in the back you have a creation of a
[30:45] heaven and an earth. In the beginning
[30:48] you have a garden with a river flowing
[30:51] down through it. And then the in the end
[30:53] you have a a garden as it is a new
[30:57] creation with the river of life flowing
[31:00] down through it. In the first in the
[31:03] Genesis you have the tree of life in the
[31:06] midst of the garden. And in Revelation
[31:08] you have the tree of life again in the
[31:11] midst of the garden. In the in the
[31:15] beginning of the Bible, Genesis, you
[31:18] have man in the image of God. And in the
[31:23] end of the Bible, you have man once
[31:25] again in the image of God.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; You have man united with his wife, his
[31:31] bride, in the beginning of the word, and
[31:34] you have man with his wife, his bride,
[31:38] in the end of the book as well. Jesus
[31:40] Christ and his bride. And so it is
[31:44] completely a cycle. It's a circle. It's
[31:48] a universe, a spiritual universe within
[31:51] itself.
[31:52] And then you have Satan using the
[31:56] serpent in the beginning.
[32:00] So he uses that serpent which God had
[32:04] created
[32:05] uh a creature
[32:08] and Satan using him and through that he
[32:12] destroyed the image of God.
[32:16] And then then you have God destroying
[32:20] the image that Satan used because the
[32:23] serpent was not found anymore.
[32:26] The missing link if you would. So,
[32:29] brother Brandham said, "Changed his
[32:30] entire structure. You can't find him
[32:32] anymore because God destroyed that
[32:36] image." Satan had d is set out now to
[32:40] destroy God's image and and that was the
[32:44] beginning of it. Then in the end in the
[32:46] book of Revelation, you'll find the
[32:49] beast and the image to the beast. And
[32:54] then the scripture speaks of that God
[32:56] takes that and destroys it completely
[32:59] and casts it into a lake of fire
[33:03] &gt;&gt; and it'll be no more.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; He says Satan took advantage
[33:13] of the serpent's physical
[33:16] uh characteristics to use him to beguile
[33:20] Eve.
[33:22] Then God destroyed the pattern of the
[33:24] serpent.
[33:26] No other beast can co-ingle with man but
[33:30] the affinity is there. That's a very
[33:33] very interesting
[33:34] part in the it's a paragraph 102 in the
[33:37] church ages and it describes how even
[33:41] the cells in the human body
[33:45] they can take a I don't want to really
[33:47] get into this but some of you may have
[33:49] been wondering about it has been
[33:50] mentioned over the pulpit before they
[33:53] can take the cells of a of a unborn
[33:56] fetus from an animal
[34:00] if they take the cells from the stomach
[34:04] or from uh the bladder or from the liver
[34:08] and they take those cells because
[34:10] they're pure and they're strong and
[34:12] they're healthy and they can inject them
[34:14] into a human being and the cells from
[34:18] that part of the body of the animal will
[34:21] go to that part that very organ of the
[34:24] human being
[34:26] and they have done it. And furthermore,
[34:29] brother uh one of the pastors
[34:33] our our brother Nelson Guy his wife was
[34:37] very very sick and uh and there was a in
[34:42] just across the border in Mexico.
[34:44] There's a hospital that was uh that was
[34:49] originated with a German scientist
[34:52] doctor and they practice that very
[34:54] thing. Many of the wi rich and the
[34:57] wealthy go there and if cancer is not
[35:00] too far gone they will take an inject.
[35:04] They take them through a procedure and
[35:06] inject the cells
[35:08] uh where the cancer is and they take the
[35:12] cells from even an animal unborn fetus
[35:16] and inject them into human and those
[35:18] cells will go to that part of that body.
[35:21] And brother Brandham in that paragraph
[35:23] 102 you can read in the church ages he
[35:26] speaks specifically of that and he says
[35:28] and he proves that there is an affinity
[35:31] between animal life and the human life,
[35:35] the the man life. There's an affinity
[35:37] between the two because there was an
[35:39] intelligence in it in the first place.
[35:42] And so God destroyed the serpent which
[35:46] Satan had used because now he attacked
[35:50] the very image of God and the and the
[35:53] whole plan and program of God. So I want
[35:56] to speak to you today on the restored
[35:58] image of God. Brother Brandham says that
[36:02] God would not leave his masterpiece
[36:06] laying there in the dirt and the dust.
[36:09] But he began immediately to begin to
[36:12] rebuild his image once again.
[36:15] Hallelujah.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; What a sculptor we have.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; What a artisan.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; What a glorious thing that God is doing.
[36:25] And so Eve because she doubted one word.
[36:29] She doubted one word and he says Satan
[36:32] misrepresented it to Eve caused her to
[36:36] doubt one word and threw the whole human
[36:40] race into fallen chaos. And although
[36:44] we're in the midst of that chaos today,
[36:47] I can tell you that we are also in the
[36:49] midst of the complete restoration of the
[36:52] image of God. God cannot be defeated.
[36:56] His program cannot be derailed. Whether
[36:59] you see it or whether it is happening
[37:02] according to the way you have set things
[37:05] out, that's irrelevant. I can tell you
[37:07] that God's word will not fail.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; God's program is right on track.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; And I want to be part of it
[37:17] &gt;&gt; sincerely. We want to be part of it.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have church service.
[37:23] We're here to move forward in this great
[37:26] plan of God
[37:27] &gt;&gt; from the youngest to the eldest that's
[37:29] in this building and hearing my voice
[37:31] today. That's why we're that's why we
[37:34] have been caught by the Holy Ghost, by
[37:37] the spirit of God in this day because
[37:39] we're part of a larger program. And this
[37:42] is what is taking place
[37:45] in the message. All things are possible.
[37:48] I'm on this this part. Eve doubted one
[37:50] word. He said Eve doubted the word of
[37:53] God. And when Satan and when Satan met
[37:56] Jesus said offspring of Eve, the woman's
[38:00] seed, not that he was direct offspring
[38:03] of her physical seed, but it was the
[38:07] promised seed where God said the seed of
[38:10] the woman. and he used the same
[38:13] technique as he did to Eve when they
[38:15] when Satan approached Jesus in the
[38:19] wilderness and uh tried to get him to
[38:22] doubt one word of God.
[38:25] Now then uh I'm just giving a a number
[38:27] of quick quotes also out of the
[38:29] Ephesians church age. He said God
[38:32] destroyed the pattern of the serpent. So
[38:34] he destroyed that image and uh and uh
[38:38] eliminated it from uh from the entire
[38:43] creation. It doesn't exist anymore. Now
[38:47] he began immediately to restore his uh
[38:50] image and the crowning act of God. The
[38:53] crowning act of creation in the
[38:56] scripture is God
[38:58] making man in his image. I want to just
[39:02] we read it so often. I want you to
[39:04] ponder this very very deeply and I would
[39:07] like to impress it upon you as I felt it
[39:09] impressed upon myself.
[39:13] Let us make man in our image.
[39:16] uh in a very early service, brother
[39:19] Brandham makes reference that I've often
[39:21] wondered about that scripture, but he
[39:22] makes reference to that very uh phrase
[39:27] and he goes back to God, a great being
[39:31] in the beginning and out from him came
[39:34] the logos
[39:36] which was the son which was the
[39:38] anointing which was the became the son
[39:40] of God eventually in flesh. And he said
[39:43] it was he said it was after that logos
[39:46] came out that the logos proceeded from
[39:49] God. He said let us make man in our
[39:52] image.
[39:55] So God created man
[39:59] in his image. In the image of God
[40:03] created he him. He was in the image of
[40:07] God.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; He bears his image. I'm not talking
[40:12] about five fingers on each hand and 10
[40:16] toes. That's not what I'm talking about.
[40:18] Ears and a nose and so on. That may have
[40:22] certainly something to do with that. But
[40:24] the image of God because Adam was not
[40:27] formed out of the soil of the earth, out
[40:30] of the dust of the earth when this had
[40:33] happened. So God created man
[40:38] in the image of God created he him. So I
[40:41] will just say he is the image.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; The man is the image. The man in this
[40:47] form is the image. Male and female,
[40:51] masculine and feminist created he them.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; They are in the image of God.
[41:00] and that trace and even though after
[41:04] this crowning act of God having man in
[41:07] his image,
[41:09] then the fall,
[41:12] then the chaos,
[41:14] the sin, the hatred, the murder, and man
[41:19] began his his his
[41:23] journey into darkness.
[41:27] But he could not lose that trace.
[41:30] He could not lose that essence of that
[41:32] stamp
[41:34] regardless of where he went. Now,
[41:38] I'm going to say some things that maybe
[41:40] you just have to think about because I'm
[41:41] thinking about them myself.
[41:47] God is not responsible
[41:50] to have everything that came forth now
[41:55] through the natural process of human
[41:59] reproduction.
[42:03] When a person is born, a child is born
[42:05] into the world and takes that breath of
[42:09] life, that is not the breath that God
[42:12] breathed into Adam. Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; That breath that breath of life
[42:20] that is a spiritual and I'm going to now
[42:22] give some quotes on it in a few minutes
[42:25] that that he became a living soul. He
[42:28] was already brother Brandham says
[42:30] clearly he was already breathing before
[42:32] he breathe breathed them. He was already
[42:35] breathing. He was already a living being
[42:38] before but he was a spirit. God is a
[42:41] spirit.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Right? and Adam with masculine feminine
[42:47] uh qualities. He was a spirit man.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; He said there's only one form of eternal
[42:57] life. This is in leadership, his last
[43:00] service.
[43:02] And it's very I'm very impressed by
[43:06] brother Brandham's last services. And I
[43:08] guess you know that the rapture things
[43:11] that are to be modern events made clear
[43:14] by the prophecy and leadership.
[43:17] In leadership he began to speak in uh in
[43:21] in 1965 and in these last services is
[43:24] where he emphasized re-emphasized the
[43:28] gene of God.
[43:30] The gene because you are a gene of your
[43:32] father. the gene that you came from
[43:36] which is a carrier of the uh
[43:39] characteristics and perhaps the nature
[43:41] and certain instincts but he said here
[43:44] that there's only one form of eternal
[43:47] life and that comes from God
[43:52] and he forained every creature that
[43:55] would ever have it. So not every
[43:57] creature has it but every creature that
[44:01] would have it. It came from God.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, these things are
[44:05] fundamental, uh, Brother Biscll." Well,
[44:08] that's fine. But I want to put it in the
[44:10] order that he put it in because it
[44:12] clears up a lot of questions for us. So,
[44:15] there's only one form of eternal life.
[44:17] Not just one form of life, but only one
[44:19] form of eternal life, and that comes
[44:22] from God.
[44:24] He forained every creature that would
[44:27] ever have it. That was for ordained. So
[44:31] not everyone that would come into human
[44:33] existence and have human life and
[44:35] natural life has that life.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; He said just as you were now here's the
[44:44] example just as you were that's all of
[44:46] us and that's every person
[44:50] were the gene of your father you were a
[44:53] gene of God as you were a gene of your
[44:56] father you were a gene of God.
[45:00] one of his attributes to begin with or
[45:03] you'll never be there.
[45:07] You come forth in the bedding ground of
[45:09] your mother. So he's going from the
[45:11] natural to the spiritual and from the
[45:13] natural to the spiritual. You were you
[45:16] came forth in the bedding ground of your
[45:18] mother. Your father didn't know you. You
[45:22] were in his loins.
[45:24] And when you came forth in the bedding
[45:26] ground of the mother, then you became a
[45:30] human being and you are made in the
[45:33] image of your father. Isn't this
[45:35] marvelous? Is the last servicemen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't this fantastic?
[45:40] &gt;&gt; He's he's going to be leaving now. And
[45:42] he's telling the people, you are a gene
[45:45] in your father,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; humanly speaking. But as you were a gene
[45:49] in your father, you were a gene in God.
[45:52] Yeah.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Your father didn't know you. Our
[45:55] heavenly father did.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; He designed us.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what we would be like.
[46:02] Our earthly father didn't. And the seed
[46:04] had to come into a certain bedding
[46:07] ground. And then we came forth of our
[46:09] mother and we were in the image of our
[46:12] father.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? Yes. Hallelujah.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now you can fellowship
[46:18] with him." And the same thing and the
[46:21] same thing by God if you've got eternal
[46:25] life.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; And if you have that eternal life, that
[46:29] imprint of God, that image, that
[46:33] determination by God that you will be
[46:36] part of the image of God. You'll be part
[46:40] of this restoration. There's no devil.
[46:43] There's no darkness, not even Satan
[46:46] himself can stop that from happening.
[46:50] There is no way. You may not understand
[46:53] the the sculpting work or the molding
[46:56] work of God. You may not understand what
[46:59] happens in your life because there isn't
[47:01] a human. I began to have became uh much
[47:04] more uh you know self-discovery and all
[47:08] of these things which take place today.
[47:10] people trying. I don't care how old you
[47:12] are or how intellectual or how keen or
[47:16] how sharp or how whatever you are.
[47:19] There's no one that can really fully
[47:22] understand their own selves.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; You can't sometimes you can't even sort
[47:27] out your own feelings. You can't sort
[47:29] out what your plan is or what you should
[47:31] be doing in the future. you you're
[47:34] you're you're having to exercise some
[47:36] faith and trust in somebody and somebody
[47:38] calls it fate and somebody calls it you
[47:41] know they don't have any uh they don't
[47:43] have any program just take it as it
[47:46] comes uh that all of that is irrelevant
[47:49] to me but the believer God who gave
[47:53] eternal life to every son and daughter
[47:56] of his he knows everyone
[47:59] &gt;&gt; he knows every single one And he will
[48:04] not lose one.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; He will bring everyone.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter from what country you are
[48:11] in, what culture you have come from or
[48:14] where you may be. He doesn't. It makes
[48:16] no difference. Irrelevant. It's totally
[48:18] irrelevant what the conditions of the
[48:21] nation is or the economy is or the
[48:24] wickedness it's in. There isn't enough
[48:26] wickedness to cover the seed of God.
[48:30] There's not enough darkness that his
[48:32] word cannot dispel.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; There isn't enough false doctrine,
[48:37] whether it be a Hutterite colony or a
[48:39] denomination or anything else, can hold
[48:42] back God's life from coming for.
[48:47] Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Regardless of where you were born or the
[48:52] kind of family you came in, there's not
[48:54] enough complexes
[48:56] &gt;&gt; that you can acquire
[48:58] &gt;&gt; that can hinder. It may hinder, but it
[49:01] cannot hold back the program of God.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; There's not enough reversals in life.
[49:07] There's not enough disease. There's not
[49:09] enough sickness. There's not enough uh
[49:12] uh of any form of trial or persecution
[49:16] that can stop the word of God from
[49:18] bringing forth the full image of Christ.
[49:21] Once again,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; he said the life that you came in, the
[49:31] natural life, physical life, that was by
[49:33] your father. The only way you can come
[49:37] born again is the only way it is. It has
[49:42] to come from the heavenly father. His
[49:45] attributes. Then he quotes the
[49:47] scripture. All all that the father has
[49:51] given me will come
[49:55] &gt;&gt; to me
[49:58] &gt;&gt; he said you are here because your name
[50:01] was placed on the lamb's book of life
[50:05] &gt;&gt; before there was even a foundation of
[50:07] the world and that's exactly right
[50:11] &gt;&gt; you're a spiritual jane
[50:15] &gt;&gt; it would be good if you could confess
[50:17] this publicly.
[50:21] Even though it may sound strange,
[50:23] I am a spiritual gene.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; I've come out from my heavenly father.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; You came here to give light to the word
[50:39] &gt;&gt; because you are a word person.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; You are a word being. And you've come at
[50:44] this time to manifest and give light to
[50:48] the word that you're part that you're
[50:50] allotted. You have been allotted. And
[50:53] that is the forming and the fashioning
[50:55] of God making his own image. Creating
[50:59] his own image.
[51:02] To make let us make man
[51:06] is to not only to fashion but is to
[51:09] accomplish it. In other words, God's not
[51:11] going to leave this half done.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; He's not going to leave this just
[51:15] partially finished. He's going to
[51:17] complete it.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And I want to move you away far from
[51:22] your own thoughts and your own
[51:24] estimation of where you are and who you
[51:27] are and how you think you're doing and
[51:28] so on because you haven't even got a
[51:31] clue whether God considers it being
[51:33] successful or not. I can give you this
[51:35] Bible is a record of a lot of people who
[51:38] thought things were going backwards. It
[51:40] was right on God's program. People
[51:43] thought they were in the depths of
[51:44] famine, in the depths of despair. They
[51:47] were facing death, the cruelty,
[51:49] imprisonments, and all kinds of things.
[51:52] And they were right in God's program.
[51:54] And on the other hand, Moses was in the
[51:56] palace of the Pharaohs. Daniel was next
[51:59] to uh Nebuchadnezzar. Others were in
[52:02] great high places. But and and you might
[52:05] have think, well, what am I doing here
[52:07] when my brothers and sisters out here
[52:09] dying in a famine or under persecution?
[52:12] They were both right in God's program.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; The people in China, they may be out of
[52:18] their meager, very little meager
[52:20] existence, but the spirit of God is in
[52:22] them forming the image of God. And you
[52:25] may be here sitting on plus seats and
[52:27] fine and uh air conditioning is just
[52:30] fine and you're baptized in water that's
[52:32] just the right temperature and they're
[52:34] in zero uh uh being watched and and
[52:38] whatever more. But all I can say is
[52:41] we're in God's program
[52:43] &gt;&gt; and we're to be what we're to be to help
[52:45] who we can to send the light wherever we
[52:48] can. And that's why God has given you
[52:50] what he's given you. It's not just for
[52:52] us to sit on and us to enjoy and have a
[52:56] great big old high life. That's not the
[52:58] plan. We're in the kingdom of God. We're
[53:00] here with God's program.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And we're God's program is I'm going to
[53:06] build up and present my image again.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even without the deterrence
[53:14] of this flesh anymore.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Let this flesh pass off the scene. And I
[53:20] say even while we're here in this body
[53:22] of flesh, let the Holy Ghost take
[53:24] control.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost in the soul. Let the
[53:31] word this morning come to the soul. Rise
[53:34] up through the channels. Take control of
[53:36] the spirit, your emotions, your
[53:38] reasoning, your memory. Oh, your memory.
[53:41] Let the Holy Ghost take charge of your
[53:43] memory.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Some of us need a Holy Ghost watching of
[53:48] your memory.
[53:50] It's plaguing your spiritual life.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost wash out your memory,
[53:57] &gt;&gt; your conscience,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; your reasoning,
[54:01] &gt;&gt; your imagination.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Don't imagine where you are spiritually.
[54:05] Move there in reality.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; To fashion and to accomplish, to produce
[54:16] it. Let us make man and to attend to it.
[54:21] Not just to do it and leave it and and
[54:23] move away from it, but to attend to it.
[54:26] Oh, I love thinking about how God gave
[54:28] promise to his first his first man that
[54:32] he gave promise to Abram.
[54:35] And then Abram for 25 years he went. But
[54:38] you know where God was? Right with him.
[54:40] Amen.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; I've mentioned this a number of times
[54:44] before, but you know that during that 25
[54:47] years, nations rose and kings rose and
[54:50] kings died and great armies came and
[54:54] moved over the earth and faded away
[54:58] and the Bible doesn't even speak about
[55:00] it.
[55:01] Economies went this way and that way,
[55:03] went sideways and whatever more. Rich
[55:06] man came, rich man disappeared, kings
[55:09] came, kings fell away and and and yet
[55:13] the Bible talks about Abraham that he
[55:15] moved over here
[55:18] &gt;&gt; and every little every little thing that
[55:21] happened to Abraham. God details it and
[55:23] he moved over there for 25 years. All
[55:25] God did was just follow Abraham.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; What? He's following his promise.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; He's following the man who's holding it.
[55:31] He's following the man who believes him.
[55:33] Yes,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; this man believes me.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's always it.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; The image was destroyed by doubt.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And now the image is being built up by
[55:45] believing.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; And that's why it's critical. If you
[55:49] believe today or if you only take a
[55:51] haphazard, well maybe so it won't work.
[55:54] But you must believe
[55:57] &gt;&gt; with all your heart. You must believe
[55:59] the word
[56:01] &gt;&gt; as it's presented to us. And then God
[56:03] attends to it. He puts it in order. He
[56:07] ordains it. He says in the in the image
[56:10] of God created he him. And the word
[56:13] creation in the Hebrew is of new
[56:16] conditions and new circumstances,
[56:19] something new. That's why it's called a
[56:22] new birth because you come into a whole
[56:25] new realm. the things you used to do and
[56:28] live for and the things that were so
[56:31] important to you disappear because a new
[56:35] creation. You're a new creation.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; I wish I could stand on the rooftop and
[56:43] maybe I don't need to. It's probably
[56:44] just as well here.
[56:47] Let the internet be the rooftop.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Take it off wherever it's supposed to
[56:51] go.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the things we used to be
[56:56] right,
[56:56] &gt;&gt; you might say, "Well, I got some of
[56:58] those things still hanging on to me."
[57:00] Well, I'm going to give you a remedy
[57:01] here in a few minutes
[57:04] &gt;&gt; towards the end of the service.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; So, the first man that was perfectly
[57:13] created in God's image, and I will say
[57:17] the image was him.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; He was the image.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to announce to you,
[57:24] you are packing the image.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; You may feel that you fail miserably at
[57:32] times, whatever more. Everybody goes
[57:34] through that, but you are packing the
[57:36] image.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; God's not going to put the image there,
[57:39] take the image out, put the image there,
[57:41] take the image out, work on it a while,
[57:42] so it's not working.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; That's not what he's going to do.
[57:47] Wherever he put that image, where that's
[57:49] a part of his that's a part of his own
[57:52] being, a part of his own life, part of
[57:54] his own breath, part of his own genes,
[57:57] however we want to say it. There's a lot
[57:59] of words we can use that really all are
[58:04] on parallel. All say the same thing.
[58:07] You're predestinated. How can you be
[58:09] predestinated if you haven't got a a
[58:11] gene of God,
[58:13] &gt;&gt; a gene of his spiritual life?
[58:16] If you have that, are you convinced you
[58:18] have it?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; There's no way you can lose. There's no
[58:21] way. That's not me saying that. That's
[58:23] the Bible saying God's not going to take
[58:25] it back.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; The image of God is an intrinsic. It is
[58:36] a uh an act of God that has become a
[58:41] part of you. You were born with it.
[58:44] Yes. Amen.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; You're born with it. Not in your natural
[58:48] human birth.
[58:51] But when you came forth in the natural
[58:54] human birth, you possessed it
[58:57] &gt;&gt; because of God's forordained
[59:00] program.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, are some born without
[59:03] it?" God's not under obligation
[59:07] to answer us or to answer to anybody
[59:10] else.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, what about these poor
[59:13] people? What about Okay, what about the
[59:15] people that reject God? What about them?
[59:20] Is it Is it wrong that God could know
[59:23] before the fact or does God Almighty
[59:27] What kind of a God does the world have
[59:29] that only discovers after the fact? To
[59:32] me, that's not God.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Says people, they die rejecting God. And
[59:38] God is grieved and he's sorry.
[59:41] What? Now, I found out that they they
[59:44] died doubting me. They died rejecting
[59:46] me. They refused my salvation. And and I
[59:49] had to wait until they died to find out.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's not my kind of God.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; So God knew by the it says by
[59:59] fornowledge.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that word. By fornowledge
[1:00:03] he predestinated. So he knew what a
[1:00:06] person was going to do.
[1:00:09] And he knew who was going to receive
[1:00:12] him. He knew who was his. So he put that
[1:00:16] seed there. He stapped that image there.
[1:00:19] And there's no way it can't happen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; That is more certain than the fact
[1:00:26] you're breathing air at this moment.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; God's image is more certain than your
[1:00:31] human image. Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; and the first man that he created was
[1:00:44] spirit man
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; and he was in the image and in the
[1:00:48] likeness of God
[1:00:50] and then he put this man in flesh
[1:00:54] and man fell. So then God came down and
[1:00:58] become the image of man. Isn't that
[1:01:01] wonderful?
[1:01:02] that he might redeem the fallen man.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And that's the real gospel story. He
[1:01:08] said to my opinion
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; in blasphemous names. He said, "But what
[1:01:15] God did, listen to this very closely
[1:01:17] now. But what God did,
[1:01:21] he breathed the breath of eternal life.
[1:01:26] Then he become a living soul,
[1:01:30] a soul that can't die.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Notice breathe the breath of eternal
[1:01:36] life into his nostrils.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; And he became, that's Adam, he became
[1:01:42] a an eternal soul because God breathed.
[1:01:47] He said, "Not what nature done,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; not what nature, not what came by
[1:01:55] nature, but but what God did."
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Breathe the breath of life into his
[1:02:04] nostrils and he became a living soul. So
[1:02:07] I am making a very clear distinction
[1:02:10] between what God breathed
[1:02:14] and what nature did. You come naturally
[1:02:19] into the world and a human spirit. A
[1:02:21] human spirit contacts. A human spirit
[1:02:25] enters that body and when it takes his
[1:02:27] last breath the human spirit departs.
[1:02:30] Where does it go? I I don't know. Maybe
[1:02:33] suppose God receives it. goes back to
[1:02:35] God who perhaps gave that spirit. I
[1:02:38] don't know. But I do know one thing that
[1:02:40] the human spirit because
[1:02:44] now the people that stood in front of
[1:02:46] the prophet of God just to show you that
[1:02:48] God's in control of all things, he would
[1:02:50] say, "I'm trying to contact your spirit.
[1:02:53] I'm trying to contact your spirit."
[1:02:55] Never said, "I'm trying to contact your
[1:02:56] soul. I'm trying to contact your
[1:02:58] spirit." and he would make contact with
[1:03:00] that spirit. But that does not mean that
[1:03:03] that spirit was the result of the breath
[1:03:05] of God
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; because multitudes of those people
[1:03:09] rejected the very word of God,
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; rejected the Holy Spirit, rejected the
[1:03:15] presence of the pillar of fire. They
[1:03:17] were interested in being healed. They
[1:03:18] were interested in having some benefit
[1:03:20] from God, but they rejected the word of
[1:03:23] God and they rejected the author.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:03:28] So the the the spirit of God can't
[1:03:31] reject the very word he wrote.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And that was the conundrum. That was the
[1:03:37] the irreconcilable thing in his ministry
[1:03:40] because there were people speaking in
[1:03:42] tongues and having a great time and
[1:03:43] having all kinds of you know uh spine
[1:03:46] tingling experiences and oh God spoke to
[1:03:49] me and I saw a flash of fire and I had
[1:03:51] this kind of experience and so on and
[1:03:53] then speak the word of God and they deny
[1:03:55] it. So, it's not it's not that their
[1:03:58] spirit wasn't anointed. Their spirit was
[1:04:01] actually anointed and they did actually
[1:04:04] receive gifts gifts of the Holy Spirit,
[1:04:07] but it did not it does not confirm it
[1:04:11] does not declare that their spirit was
[1:04:14] the breath of God. What I'm saying is
[1:04:17] that the breath of God is eternal life.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that?
[1:04:25] The breath of God is eternal life.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; God breathed in eternal life. He won't
[1:04:31] take it back.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; So it isn't that he breathes eternal
[1:04:37] life into all humanity and then they die
[1:04:40] rejecting him and he takes it back.
[1:04:43] That's not the plan. That's not the
[1:04:44] program. Never has been, never will be.
[1:04:50] male and female created he them.
[1:04:56] Then he said he breathed into them. And
[1:04:58] he goes on in blasphemous names and says
[1:05:01] the church is the mystical body of
[1:05:04] Christ.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Born of the breath of God.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Who's born of the breath of God? The
[1:05:10] church. The body of Christ. The mystical
[1:05:13] body of Christ. Why is it mystical? This
[1:05:16] isn't mystical. We that are all seated
[1:05:18] here because we can see one another and
[1:05:21] there's no mystery to it. But that which
[1:05:23] you cannot see in one another.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; That's what bears the image of God, the
[1:05:29] imprint of God. And that's what God is
[1:05:31] cultivating. That's what he's working
[1:05:33] on.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he's still working on me.
[1:05:37] [Music]
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's the mystical body of Christ born of
[1:05:43] the breath of God. And the church of God
[1:05:46] is born of the breath of God. God
[1:05:48] breathed into the nostrils spiritually.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; He says, of Adam, spiritually of Adam.
[1:05:59] And he became a living soul.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, Adam, it's not good that
[1:06:06] he should be alone. I will make same
[1:06:10] words as he did for the man. I will make
[1:06:14] for him and help for him.
[1:06:18] Same as was spoken for Adam. And the rib
[1:06:21] which the Lord God had taken from man,
[1:06:24] he made a woman and brought her unto the
[1:06:27] man.
[1:06:29] And when it uses the word now he made,
[1:06:33] I will make for him. He used the same as
[1:06:35] he did for Adam. Let us make man. Now he
[1:06:39] uses the same for the woman. I will
[1:06:42] make. But then he says, so he made. And
[1:06:45] the word made is quite different. This
[1:06:48] is to build,
[1:06:50] to rebuild,
[1:06:51] to establish, to cause, to continue. I
[1:06:56] will make him a wife to reestablish, to
[1:07:01] rebuild, to restore, to bring back.
[1:07:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. to bring back a
[1:07:08] a people in whom will be the imprint of
[1:07:13] the image and I'll build again. So
[1:07:16] through that he brought people who
[1:07:18] believed.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Enoch believed God.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Moses believed God.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Joshua believed God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Caleb believed God.
[1:07:36] Samuel believed God.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; David believed God.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; The prophets believed God.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And God was building his image back
[1:07:47] again.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know how you can sit there
[1:07:52] without rejoicing.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; The apostles believed God
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; and by believing the image kept coming
[1:08:01] up and kept coming up. Some of them were
[1:08:04] foundation stones as Abraham, Isaac,
[1:08:07] Jacob, and Joseph. Foundation stones to
[1:08:10] the masterpiece.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says God believed his
[1:08:16] own word.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; The messengers believed God in in spite
[1:08:23] of the opposition.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; In spite of the persuasion and the
[1:08:27] pressure. Can you imagine the pressure
[1:08:29] the messenger came under in this day?
[1:08:32] pressures of finance
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; here. He's got, you know, we've got a
[1:08:36] little church here to uh to be concerned
[1:08:38] about and they're having tens of
[1:08:40] thousands of people. How are you going
[1:08:42] to pay the bill? How you going to
[1:08:44] continue with this? I I I'm glad, you
[1:08:46] know, I learned a few lessons from
[1:08:48] brother Brandham and one was this is
[1:08:51] God's work.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He's got to support it.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't support it, then it's not
[1:08:56] worth being supported.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; And then ministers were saying if I
[1:09:01] preached that I' I'd be uh uh they
[1:09:04] kicked me out of my church, said I'd
[1:09:06] sooner eat crackers and soda water
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; and crackers than to have a good
[1:09:11] position or a good church and and not
[1:09:13] preach the full council of the word of
[1:09:15] God.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They say you'll ruin your
[1:09:18] ministry. I heard it just the other day
[1:09:20] where he was quoting, "You'll ruin your
[1:09:22] ministry." And I have a good idea who it
[1:09:24] was that was counseling. Brother
[1:09:25] Brandham says you've been called to pray
[1:09:27] for the sick. people consider you a
[1:09:29] prophet and you'll ruin your ministry.
[1:09:32] He said if preaching the word of God
[1:09:34] will ruin a person's ministry, that
[1:09:36] ministry needs to be ruined.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; And after the fall and through the
[1:09:50] through the serpent coming to the woman,
[1:09:52] after the fall, the image was shattered,
[1:09:55] was broken. But yet God could never be
[1:10:02] uh deterred from his program. Does God
[1:10:05] ever change his mind about his word? In
[1:10:08] that message, he says just like at the
[1:10:10] beginning,
[1:10:12] it was not God's perfect will. The
[1:10:14] reason I'm going back and forth, maybe
[1:10:17] move forward and then I come back and
[1:10:18] and and catch a little bit more and
[1:10:21] repeat the same things is because I'm
[1:10:23] coming to perhaps certain quotes.
[1:10:24] Sometimes brother Brandon will cover
[1:10:26] several things that uh I want to bring
[1:10:29] to you but then it comes in I want it in
[1:10:32] his order. So he said uh just like at
[1:10:35] the beginning it was not God's perfect
[1:10:37] will
[1:10:38] for children to be born on the earth
[1:10:41] through sex.
[1:10:43] So we all came here that way.
[1:10:47] Not God's perfect will.
[1:10:50] That is why God's not obliged
[1:10:54] or obligated to breathe eternal life
[1:10:59] into children that came not by his
[1:11:02] perfect will.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; He allowed it. He permitted it. But it
[1:11:07] was not his perfect will.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:11:13] one person can sit and hear that word
[1:11:16] and they say that's life. Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Another person hears the same word and
[1:11:20] says, "Oh, I can't I can't go with
[1:11:23] that."
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; One person hears it and it's from God.
[1:11:29] Next person hears it, he said, "It's of
[1:11:30] the devil."
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; You can't get further apart than that. I
[1:11:34] trust you're here because you believe
[1:11:36] this message came from God.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that's why you're here. I have
[1:11:41] confidence in you. You're here. You
[1:11:43] stuck it out. You stayed with it. Things
[1:11:45] have gone sideways perhaps for you, gone
[1:11:48] in reverse. All kinds of things have
[1:11:50] happened, but still you held to it. It
[1:11:52] wasn't you holding to it. It was God
[1:11:54] holding on to you.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; God will never let you go.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So it wasn't his perfect will. They
[1:12:06] said, "God created man out of the dust
[1:12:08] of the earth, breathed the breath of
[1:12:11] life into him, and he became a living
[1:12:15] soul.
[1:12:16] He took from that man a helpmate
[1:12:20] and made him a wife to him." That was
[1:12:24] God's first and original will. But when
[1:12:28] sin came in and did the thing that it
[1:12:31] did, then he permitted man to marry a
[1:12:35] wife legally and have children by her,
[1:12:38] multiply and replenish the earth if
[1:12:41] that's the way you're going to do it.
[1:12:44] But you see, it never was his perfect
[1:12:46] will. So I think that's clear. Yes.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And I have here
[1:12:55] there's not enough fallen angels
[1:12:58] because there was
[1:13:00] untold numbers of angels that fell
[1:13:05] and they became disobedient
[1:13:07] and they followed Lucifer and they're
[1:13:10] present today.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; They're here in the Pacific Northwest.
[1:13:18] Right. Right.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; They're in all the cities of the world.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They're in every educational
[1:13:26] institution.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; They're in every government.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; They're there to influence
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; to make suggestions, to have political
[1:13:37] power.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; That wasn't enough. Then it would get
[1:13:41] into the church and those angels that
[1:13:44] knew everything about worship would get
[1:13:46] into the word and began to teach and
[1:13:49] interpret the word to people and to
[1:13:51] ministers and to leaders and to whatever
[1:13:54] more in order to make and mastermind the
[1:13:58] greatest deception that ever was on the
[1:14:00] earth. But in the midst of all of that,
[1:14:03] there's a group of people that could not
[1:14:05] be deceived. There's a group of people
[1:14:07] who took the stand and said that's not
[1:14:09] right. That is not according to the
[1:14:11] message of the hour. And that group of
[1:14:13] people, God keeps forming and molding
[1:14:16] them. And the image of God keeps coming
[1:14:19] up right in the midst of Satan's Eden.
[1:14:21] The image of God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where Satan began to rear up
[1:14:27] his his image in God's Eden. Now God is
[1:14:31] rearing up his image in Satan's Eden.
[1:14:34] and nothing can prevent it.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; I don't care what state a person is in.
[1:14:40] If they're a solid believer, God's image
[1:14:44] is imprinted upon you and you can never
[1:14:47] escape it.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; That's why believers that backslide,
[1:14:54] they're the most miserable of people
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; because you can't fit in the world.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Have you been there?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; I have.
[1:15:03] can't fit.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; You cannot fit in the world.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; You can't even fit with your peers.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You can't even feel at home.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And you go into a bar or you go into
[1:15:14] some place of worldly entertainment and
[1:15:17] you say, "What am I doing here?"
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You can try to immerse yourself in that
[1:15:22] dark world and it won't work. because of
[1:15:25] you have the imprint of God upon your
[1:15:27] life. There's only one place you can go
[1:15:30] and that's only one place you can go is
[1:15:32] come back to the very word of God
[1:15:35] because this is what's in you.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; You might as well say amen. That is
[1:15:40] God's truth.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; God's familiar with darkness.
[1:15:49] The earth was covered with darkness that
[1:15:52] never stopped. didn't even for a moment
[1:15:55] stop the word of God from coming and the
[1:15:57] spirit of God moving over on and and and
[1:16:01] saying let there be light
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; and light came
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; and light is more powerful than darkness
[1:16:07] and darkness began to dissipate. You
[1:16:10] came into the world in a darkened state,
[1:16:13] but the son of righteousness rose with
[1:16:16] healing in his wings and cast light upon
[1:16:19] your soul and dispel the darkness and
[1:16:23] all that it brings.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:31] I remember some years ago
[1:16:34] when they had a
[1:16:37] lot of the hippie movement and uh drug
[1:16:40] world was becoming very popular and
[1:16:47] people
[1:16:48] especially young people were tired of a
[1:16:51] powerless religion.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; They were tired of what materialism had
[1:16:57] done. So they rebelled against
[1:16:58] materialism.
[1:17:00] So we don't want anything to do with it.
[1:17:08] I'll tell one on a good friend that's
[1:17:11] sitting here in the congregation today.
[1:17:15] He won't mind. And if he does mind,
[1:17:16] he'll have to forgive me.
[1:17:20] Brother Don Alexander.
[1:17:23] I don't know if you know, I understand
[1:17:24] he actually worked in a bank one time.
[1:17:27] He's a teller in the bank or worked in
[1:17:29] the bank
[1:17:32] and uh Brother Roger Smith was and we
[1:17:35] were just in the house and and the young
[1:17:38] people would give their offering. I
[1:17:40] don't even know how we handled it then.
[1:17:41] We may have had a box at the back. I
[1:17:42] don't even know. It wasn't a big issue.
[1:17:45] And uh Brother Roger came to me one day
[1:17:47] and he says, "Uh,
[1:17:50] brother
[1:17:51] Don needs $5."
[1:17:55] Okay. What? What's he need? $5 for?
[1:17:58] Well, he says he needs a I think he
[1:18:00] needs a cap and a pair of socks or
[1:18:02] something.
[1:18:03] I said, "Well, he's working. Why didn't
[1:18:05] he just go and buy it?" No, he said he
[1:18:07] doesn't he just can't stand having any
[1:18:09] money. He said, "When he gets his check,
[1:18:11] he just throws it in the offering. Then
[1:18:13] when he needs anything, he comes to me
[1:18:15] and says, "I need $5."
[1:18:18] Is too big a hassle to worry about the
[1:18:21] money and everything. They just kicked
[1:18:23] it over. All kinds of young people. We
[1:18:25] would have a c we'd have a crowd and
[1:18:26] there was three cars in the parking lot
[1:18:28] and two of them were mine.
[1:18:34] And some of the stuff I don't think I
[1:18:36] don't think the scrapyard would accept
[1:18:38] it
[1:18:40] cuz they rebelled against it. You know
[1:18:42] why? They said doesn't work. Materialism
[1:18:44] doesn't work.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Politics doesn't work.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Money doesn't work.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Religion doesn't work. We've had enough
[1:18:52] of it. Had it right up to here. But then
[1:18:54] the word came.
[1:18:58] Oh, the word came. Hallelujah. No wonder
[1:19:02] the messenger could announce it is the
[1:19:05] rising of the sun.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day. He said that first
[1:19:10] rising was wonderful. But this rising,
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; this dual rising, when the son of son of
[1:19:16] God came out of the tomb and you and I
[1:19:19] with him,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; if you just say Jesus rose, that's only
[1:19:24] part of the story.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; If you're going to say everything, say
[1:19:27] everything he said. Jesus rose, but you
[1:19:30] rose with him.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; You were there in the genes of God, and
[1:19:36] your body was laying on the earth at
[1:19:38] that moment.
[1:19:40] Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; You were there, young fellas.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Your body was laying right in the dust.
[1:19:45] This body is sitting here in this seat,
[1:19:47] young ladies, brothers and sisters, the
[1:19:50] body you're sitting in, the body you uh
[1:19:52] dressed up this morning, that body was
[1:19:54] laying in the earth,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; the day the son of righteousness, Jesus
[1:19:58] Christ, rose out of the tomb. Why?
[1:20:01] Corruption couldn't take him.
[1:20:05] [Applause]
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he was the perfect image of
[1:20:08] God.
[1:20:09] [Applause]
[1:20:13] in bridegroom form.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And in him yet
[1:20:18] was a bride.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And her spirit, the spirit of her was
[1:20:24] separated, literally separated from him
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; at Calvary.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And that spirit came down into that
[1:20:31] first believers on the day of Pentecost.
[1:20:34] And the church was born.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. the church was born. Why
[1:20:40] were they there? They were believers.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was seen of above 500.
[1:20:47] Above 500, more than 500. He was seen of
[1:20:51] more than 500 to be a good part of this
[1:20:54] congregation this morning. And Jesus
[1:20:56] showed himself by many infallible proofs
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; that he was raised from the dead. He who
[1:21:03] suffered and hung on died upon Calvary
[1:21:07] and the people saw him and everybody in
[1:21:10] Palestine knew it
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; and now he was seen alive by over 500
[1:21:17] and he told them to go to Jerusalem
[1:21:20] Terry in Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:21:23] with power and go and wait there. Don't
[1:21:26] go don't dis be dispersed and don't go
[1:21:29] preaching this excited excitement
[1:21:31] message but go and tarry
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; 120
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; 120 were numbered
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; I ask how in the world did 380 miss that
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; how would you like to have been one of
[1:21:53] the 380 on the day of Pentecost when
[1:21:55] They came out staggering like drunk men
[1:21:59] and women and uttering and speaking in
[1:22:02] other languages, not just unknown
[1:22:04] tongues. That's not correct. They the
[1:22:07] Bible says, "How hear we every man in
[1:22:10] our own tongue." Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Anybody that comes to you with the
[1:22:17] Pentecost that they impose upon the
[1:22:19] people today that speaking speaking a
[1:22:21] lot of unknown things there is perhaps
[1:22:24] those uh tongues of men and of angels
[1:22:26] but that what they're saying is what
[1:22:28] happened on the day of Pentecost is not
[1:22:30] so on the day of Pentecost how here we
[1:22:33] every man in our own tongue and listen
[1:22:35] to this now because brother Brandham
[1:22:38] related to me and really cleared up a
[1:22:40] lot of things for himself.
[1:22:43] He said they were Galileans.
[1:22:46] Most of the people there who spoke, they
[1:22:49] spoke Galilean.
[1:22:51] He said if it was here, it would be
[1:22:53] English.
[1:22:55] And if the Holy Spirit, let's say maybe
[1:22:58] they came from Russia, they came from
[1:23:01] Germany, they came from uh Brazil, they
[1:23:04] came from Africa, and they spoke
[1:23:06] different languages.
[1:23:08] And they were all gathered for this
[1:23:10] great feast. But most of the people were
[1:23:13] Galileans.
[1:23:14] And here they came out speaking in these
[1:23:17] languages. They were all filled with the
[1:23:20] Holy Ghost. And brother Brandham said to
[1:23:23] me, "Did anybody who spoke Galilean
[1:23:26] hear
[1:23:28] in their own tongue?" And I said, "Well,
[1:23:31] yeah, there would have to be in order
[1:23:32] for the scripture to be correct. How
[1:23:35] here we every man in our own tongue." So
[1:23:38] he said they were all Galileans who were
[1:23:40] filled with the Holy Ghost. Did the
[1:23:42] Galileans hear in their own tongue? I
[1:23:45] said yes. He said they also were filled
[1:23:47] with the Holy Ghost. There could be
[1:23:49] people speaking English and they come
[1:23:51] out preaching English. I'm preaching
[1:23:53] English. If I spoke in some unknown
[1:23:55] tongue now, as Apostle Paul said, your
[1:23:57] mind would be unfruitful. You wouldn't
[1:23:59] know what I'm saying. But God by the
[1:24:02] same Holy Spirit can takes the
[1:24:04] individual and fill them with the Holy
[1:24:07] Spirit
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; and they speak the word of God.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But where were the 380?
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't want to have been one and
[1:24:20] stand on the sidelines and say, "My
[1:24:22] goodness,
[1:24:24] what in the world was I doing for the
[1:24:27] last 10 days?"
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:24:31] What was I doing the other day when the
[1:24:33] Holy Spirit came down and and licks a
[1:24:36] fire appeared upon them? I was out
[1:24:40] fixing my car.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; I was out scrubbing my camel.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I thought it was so important.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; My wife was busy doing the laundry,
[1:24:53] cleaning the carpet because it was just
[1:24:56] bothering her so bad. The house is in
[1:24:59] such a mess. the tent, wherever it was,
[1:25:02] and somehow our priorities got twisted.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; You see, you hear me preaching and you
[1:25:09] think, "Oh, but if I heard it out of the
[1:25:11] lips of Jesus Christ, don't you fool
[1:25:13] yourself."
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You could hear William Brham, you could
[1:25:18] hear uh uh Apostle Paul, you could hear
[1:25:22] Moses, you could hear Jesus Christ
[1:25:24] himself. And there are some people it
[1:25:27] wouldn't click with them. It wouldn't
[1:25:29] make any difference with them. They go
[1:25:31] out and live exactly the same. I say to
[1:25:33] you, in the name of the Lord, it's not
[1:25:35] Apostle Paul or William Brham or Jesus
[1:25:39] Christ. It's that you recognize
[1:25:42] God has unveiled his word for the
[1:25:46] purposes of building up and molding my
[1:25:48] life into the image of Jesus Christ,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; into this image of God. That's the
[1:25:55] purpose. and everything else should come
[1:25:58] subject to it.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just go on just a
[1:26:04] little bit a little bit uh shorter and
[1:26:06] then I'm going to I'm not going to keep
[1:26:08] you late
[1:26:13] in the masterpiece message.
[1:26:19] Well, let me just go back because I said
[1:26:22] that uh
[1:26:25] that Adam and Eve then in the fallen
[1:26:27] state began to bring forth children. And
[1:26:30] the Bible says that
[1:26:32] that Adam knew his wife again, and she
[1:26:34] brought forth a man and called his name
[1:26:37] Seth.
[1:26:39] For God said, she hath appointed me
[1:26:42] another seed instead of Abel whom Cain
[1:26:46] slew.
[1:26:47] And then it says, "And to Seth, to him
[1:26:50] also was born a son." You see, now the
[1:26:53] the human not according to God's perfect
[1:26:57] will, but God permitted it.
[1:27:02] And to Seth was born a son, and they
[1:27:05] called his name Enos.
[1:27:08] And then began man to call upon the name
[1:27:11] of the Lord. Something happened
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; when Enos came. Then man man began to
[1:27:18] call on the name of the Lord. In the
[1:27:20] masterpiece message, brother Brandham
[1:27:22] says, "But the great sculptor when he
[1:27:24] seen the fall of his family,
[1:27:28] the masterpiece, he wasn't willing just
[1:27:30] to leave it lay there face down in
[1:27:34] ruin." He went immediately to build it
[1:27:37] up again.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He wasn't willing that it should perish.
[1:27:41] lay there like that all the time because
[1:27:44] he's God and he will not be defeated.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; I know that you agree with that and I
[1:27:51] know that you say
[1:27:54] uh in agreement amen. Remember that amen
[1:27:57] tomorrow. Remember that amen when
[1:28:00] everything goes so in reverse you
[1:28:03] wonder. remember it when Satan comes
[1:28:06] your way and asks you if you're even a
[1:28:08] believer
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; because I know he does.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; If you think that you're actually going
[1:28:12] to go in the rapture because I know that
[1:28:15] he does say that. And when you become
[1:28:18] like it's overwhelmed with a wave of
[1:28:22] this modern society,
[1:28:25] say, "Oh God,
[1:28:27] help me to find my balance.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Help me to keep on course. Yes.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Help me to stay away and shun these
[1:28:37] things that try to deter me and distract
[1:28:40] me and derail me.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Help me, oh God.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; I want to make a statement to you in a
[1:28:47] few minutes. I want to enforce it. And
[1:28:49] that is God, listen closely now. God
[1:28:54] does not expect you
[1:28:57] to mold yourself. That's right.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; He is the potter.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; We are the clay.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Well, what do I need to do then? Brother
[1:29:10] says, "Man is always wanting something
[1:29:12] to do." The only thing that the
[1:29:14] scripture really calls on you to do is
[1:29:17] resist the devil.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Resist the wrong and yield to the spirit
[1:29:25] of God. Yield to the service you're
[1:29:28] hearing this morning. Yield to the Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost. Yield to the word. And he will
[1:29:34] speak. It may be a still small voice as
[1:29:37] I spoke on a few weeks ago, but he will
[1:29:40] speak. And he will say the same thing
[1:29:43] every time. Then you yield to that. And
[1:29:47] as you yield, then the potter takes
[1:29:50] over.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; As you submit yourself and surrender
[1:29:54] yourself. Are you with me? Are you
[1:29:57] listening?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; As you surrender, God does the molding.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; He does the shaping.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And you'll find that things that
[1:30:09] were not pleasing to your inner self, to
[1:30:14] your soul. You'll find that those things
[1:30:16] are being formed out of you. And the
[1:30:19] image of God is coming forth.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] I'm not just preaching to you. I've
[1:30:29] experienced these things
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; and many of you have as well.
[1:30:39] I say to this congregation in all
[1:30:40] respect
[1:30:43] and with a great deal of sincerity.
[1:30:50] You need
[1:30:54] to be certain
[1:30:57] that when you have a desire that leads
[1:31:00] you to a decision,
[1:31:05] when you have uh something that may be a
[1:31:08] conviction to you, real strong
[1:31:11] conviction,
[1:31:15] when you determine I need to say
[1:31:17] something, I need to speak it. I need to
[1:31:20] say it. I'm going to go to that person.
[1:31:23] I'm going to say something. You want to
[1:31:26] make absolutely certain
[1:31:29] that the pattern that the pattern is a
[1:31:32] pattern of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. True.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; You know, I I get I get letters, I get
[1:31:40] emails, I get phone calls,
[1:31:43] and generally when people I'm not even
[1:31:45] speaking to this congregation at this
[1:31:46] moment, but I get them from all over
[1:31:50] and they say, "This has happened, that
[1:31:51] has happened, etc., etc., and I'm I'm
[1:31:53] thinking about doing this or I'm making
[1:31:55] a decision to do that." Sometimes it's a
[1:31:58] physical movement. Sometimes it's, you
[1:32:01] know, I'm in a kind of a marital
[1:32:03] situation. and I think I should do this,
[1:32:05] I should do that. And the one thing that
[1:32:08] I do is make absolutely certain not only
[1:32:13] that brother Brandham said it, because
[1:32:15] often I will have people say, "Well,
[1:32:17] Brother Brandham said this and then he
[1:32:19] said this and he said that." And so when
[1:32:22] they tie these things together, they
[1:32:25] come up with an obvious conclusion of
[1:32:27] what they should do.
[1:32:29] But when when I examine what it is
[1:32:33] they're going to do,
[1:32:35] I say that's not something that brother
[1:32:38] Brandham ever did.
[1:32:41] You might So it's not to put it simply
[1:32:43] to you, this is this is one of my f
[1:32:46] foundation criteria for my life. It's
[1:32:49] not only what he said, but it's what he
[1:32:51] did.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Gen.
[1:32:56] You may come to a conclusion or even
[1:32:58] belief.
[1:33:00] I've listened to brothers that have put
[1:33:02] together the message and so articulated
[1:33:04] the word. So the prophet said this and
[1:33:06] this quote and this and connect them all
[1:33:08] together and and when they finally get
[1:33:10] out to the end, this is the obvious
[1:33:13] conclusion. And that conclusion is what
[1:33:16] becomes their pillar doctrine.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:23] and they spend all of their time and all
[1:33:25] of their energies preaching that
[1:33:27] conclusion. And I talked to some
[1:33:30] brothers and I'm glad to say they've
[1:33:32] actually turned away from that. But I
[1:33:34] spoke to them and I said, "The only did
[1:33:37] you ever read this?" He said, "Did you
[1:33:39] ever read this uh track that I put
[1:33:41] together?" It was all quotes. And I
[1:33:43] said, "Yes." And the first thing I did,
[1:33:45] I said, "I put the dates of everything
[1:33:48] that was said beside it." And I said,
[1:33:52] 'You know as well as I do that the
[1:33:54] message was a progressive message.
[1:33:56] Brother Brandham said in the seals, he
[1:33:58] said, oh, he said, I was in some old
[1:34:01] notes. He said, if I would have said,
[1:34:03] you know, if I would have said that, he
[1:34:05] said, I would have been so wrong, but
[1:34:07] today that pillar fire came. Today, Holy
[1:34:11] Spirit came. Aren't we thankful for
[1:34:12] that?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a progressive message.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; He said, I was, you know, going even by
[1:34:17] some notes by by some that he had read
[1:34:20] and whatever more. It was a progressive.
[1:34:22] He said, "You watch that thus sayeth the
[1:34:24] Lord."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not opening the door and
[1:34:26] saying, "Oh, that we have to, you know,
[1:34:29] be a law unto ourselves." That's not
[1:34:31] what I'm saying. But I'm saying the I
[1:34:34] believe that the Holy Spirit, you see,
[1:34:37] even now you as parents, you may you may
[1:34:40] come to a decision with your children
[1:34:43] that's not exactly correct. It may not
[1:34:46] be a a a precise word conclusion. It may
[1:34:50] not be a it may not be the best
[1:34:54] decision, but you make it as a mother,
[1:34:57] as a father. God sees that. And then,
[1:35:01] you know, on down the road, you you
[1:35:03] might say you you and your wife say,
[1:35:04] "You know what? That wasn't the best
[1:35:06] thing. That that's not the best for that
[1:35:08] child." So we God gives you and gives
[1:35:12] you instruction, gives you guidance and
[1:35:14] you change that and you readjust things
[1:35:16] and you you make it uh you make a
[1:35:21] correction.
[1:35:22] But God doesn't discount you
[1:35:27] and do away with you because as a parent
[1:35:30] and we're many parents here and if
[1:35:33] you're honest with yourself, you've made
[1:35:35] wrong decisions sometimes.
[1:35:38] But God does not put a black mark in his
[1:35:41] book and say, "Ah, you made a wrong
[1:35:43] decision." No, what he does says,
[1:35:45] "You're a father. You're a mother. You
[1:35:48] were honest. You loved your child. You
[1:35:50] did everything. You did what you felt
[1:35:52] was best for it. And so, uh, you just
[1:35:55] move on.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. You just move on. What are
[1:35:59] you going to do? Stay there with your
[1:36:01] mistake? Stay there with your error?"
[1:36:02] No, you move on.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Or the brothers sitting here too. So
[1:36:11] I'll uh you know we were just in
[1:36:14] discussion the other day and and this
[1:36:17] sometimes this happens. I never never
[1:36:19] dreamed I would get onto this subject
[1:36:21] but this part of it at least. But
[1:36:23] sometimes this happen. This is like some
[1:36:25] real good instruction. We're here. I'm a
[1:36:28] daddy and I've been a father to a lot of
[1:36:31] you that have come into the knowledge of
[1:36:33] the message. But if you have children,
[1:36:36] you have a son or a daughter and they've
[1:36:39] got a certain trait
[1:36:42] and you see that that trait
[1:36:44] is not taking them in the right
[1:36:46] direction.
[1:36:51] You can do one of two things. You can
[1:36:53] ask for guidance from the Holy Spirit
[1:36:56] how to deal with that and expect that
[1:37:00] God will direct you in that or you can
[1:37:04] go another direction. You can you can
[1:37:06] just harp on it all the time. You can
[1:37:09] just get on their case all the time.
[1:37:11] You're always doing that. What's the
[1:37:13] matter with you? You know why? Why don't
[1:37:17] you change? Maybe the child can't
[1:37:19] change.
[1:37:21] Come on.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Now I really get personal and probably
[1:37:26] the whole world will hear it.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; But one day before
[1:37:33] Joanne married Tom
[1:37:40] and I noticed she was such a good girl.
[1:37:42] She'd come and sit in church but there
[1:37:44] was just like a blank there. Dear, you
[1:37:47] can forgive me.
[1:37:51] and she's up into that mid- teen time.
[1:37:53] You know, Brother Bram talked about
[1:37:54] Becky. He says she's sitting at the back
[1:37:57] chewing gum. You know, he's just doing
[1:38:00] what girls that age do. And we were in
[1:38:04] the house and we were having four
[1:38:05] meetings a week.
[1:38:07] And I noticed that Joanne just sat there
[1:38:10] and just a a dead pan stare just
[1:38:13] straight ahead.
[1:38:16] There's only one of my messages that's
[1:38:18] ever been printed that I know of, and
[1:38:19] that's sinners die alone.
[1:38:22] And that I preached that the very next
[1:38:24] Sunday
[1:38:28] because I called her down to my office.
[1:38:32] And if you want to see the chair she sat
[1:38:33] in, it's in my office here almost like
[1:38:36] 40 years later,
[1:38:38] 35 years later.
[1:38:41] And she sat in that chair. I just I want
[1:38:44] to talk to you a minute.
[1:38:48] And I said,
[1:38:51] Joan, dear, I said, I see you sitting in
[1:38:53] the services and you're you're there all
[1:38:55] the time.
[1:38:58] I said, do you ever feel God touching
[1:39:00] your heart?
[1:39:04] And she went
[1:39:06] just pursed her lips a little bit
[1:39:09] and shook her head.
[1:39:12] It was like someone drove a dagger to my
[1:39:15] heart
[1:39:18] and I said, "Don't you have the least
[1:39:21] desire for God? Don't you have the least
[1:39:24] desire?" And her lips were still pursed.
[1:39:33] I didn't know where to go.
[1:39:36] I said, "Dear,
[1:39:40] you're sitting in the chair
[1:39:43] that dad prays in."
[1:39:47] And I said, "And he talks to me."
[1:39:51] And I said, "I've noticed this little
[1:39:53] twist
[1:39:56] in your nature and your character."
[1:40:00] And I said, 'If that doesn't change,
[1:40:04] it'll cause you a lot of heartache and
[1:40:07] trouble. Perhaps when you get married
[1:40:10] and you get older,
[1:40:13] that'll just continue.
[1:40:16] And I said,
[1:40:20] I encouraged her then.
[1:40:23] I said, I you know, I've prayed and I
[1:40:26] believe that God wants to do something.
[1:40:28] The next service, God laid in my heart.
[1:40:33] When the beggar died, the angels were
[1:40:35] there to take him.
[1:40:39] And when the rich man died,
[1:40:42] no one was there. Sinners
[1:40:46] die alone.
[1:40:50] And I just got to the end of that
[1:40:52] service and I was weeping now.
[1:40:56] And I cried out, Joanne, it's you.
[1:41:00] And it was like electric power in her
[1:41:04] chair. She leapt up out of her chair and
[1:41:08] surrendered her life to Christ. And it's
[1:41:11] that's the Joanne that you know
[1:41:14] from that day I can say with the prophet
[1:41:17] from that time
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; could she mold her life? No. She even
[1:41:25] wept and said I've tried. I've tried.
[1:41:28] Did you? I've tried.
[1:41:30] I've tried so hard. Maybe that's you.
[1:41:35] I've tried. I've tried so hard.
[1:41:40] What can you do? Only one thing. Just
[1:41:44] surrender all.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Then the potter comes in.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; The potter takes a surrendered life.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The potter takes that molded life.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; The potter takes that life when the
[1:41:57] coming out of the lips is saying, "Yes,
[1:41:58] Lord. Yes. Yes.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Take me. I give you all."
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here. You've experienced
[1:42:07] it. You look back. You remember that
[1:42:08] time when you just gave it all
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; and then the potter took a hold of the
[1:42:14] clay
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; and he began to mold it and shape it
[1:42:18] into the kind of vessel.
[1:42:21] You know what he was doing?
[1:42:24] It so pleased him because he was
[1:42:25] bringing his image beginning to see
[1:42:27] himself
[1:42:29] building that image up. Oh my friends,
[1:42:35] God is taking this service in a
[1:42:36] different direction.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; than I had planned.
[1:42:42] But I did have a weight in my heart. I
[1:42:45] wrestled all day yesterday till I was
[1:42:47] exhausted. And I was I've never even
[1:42:50] experienced a time like that. I said,
[1:42:52] "I've got to just go out and drive out.
[1:42:54] I've got to get some fresh air." And I
[1:42:56] and I went out to go for a walk. I
[1:42:58] didn't have the energy to walk. I didn't
[1:43:00] have the strength. I got depressed. I
[1:43:02] said, I can't imagine that me, Ed
[1:43:04] Biscll, doesn't have a generally so full
[1:43:06] of energy. I haven't got the strength to
[1:43:08] even walk. I was so exhausted from from
[1:43:11] this message. I've never had it in my
[1:43:12] life. Not on a single time. I laid back
[1:43:15] and I didn't have the energy. I even
[1:43:17] thought about walking and I was
[1:43:19] depressed. I thought, why I haven't even
[1:43:21] got the energy to walk. But I was
[1:43:22] wrestling over one thing. How will I
[1:43:25] tell the people
[1:43:27] that they have the image in them? That
[1:43:30] imprint is there. How will I tell this
[1:43:33] congregation that that image is in you
[1:43:36] and God will not take it back
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; and it's better to surrender sooner than
[1:43:40] later?
[1:43:52] The Holy Spirit
[1:43:55] is so patient and long-suffering and so
[1:43:59] if I could describe to you how desirous
[1:44:01] he is
[1:44:04] to have you just
[1:44:07] brother Brandham said Jesus came to the
[1:44:09] cross and he just climbed on his altar.
[1:44:13] They didn't have to take him and throw
[1:44:15] him down on the cross. He was made for
[1:44:18] it. He knew he was a perfect image of
[1:44:21] God and he laid down on that cross. They
[1:44:24] nail him. I say to you,
[1:44:27] just climb up on the potter's wheel.
[1:44:31] Let yourself be there today as just a
[1:44:33] lump of shapeless clay
[1:44:36] and let him do the molding.
[1:44:40] and he'll begin to fashion you and stay
[1:44:43] in that condition. Stay in that
[1:44:44] atmosphere.
[1:44:46] Don't forget it tomorrow, the next day,
[1:44:48] the next week, and set it as a course
[1:44:50] for your life. I'm thine, oh Lord. I've
[1:44:52] heard thy voice.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; And at thy love to me, but I long to
[1:44:59] rise on the arms of faith and be closer
[1:45:04] drawn to thee.
[1:45:10] Have thy own way, Lord.
[1:45:13] Have thy own way.
[1:45:16] Thou art the potter.
[1:45:20] I am the clay.
[1:45:23] Mold me and make me
[1:45:27] after thy will.
[1:45:30] While I am waiting,
[1:45:34] yielded
[1:45:36] and still
[1:45:46] burdened.
[1:45:50] God is wanting to do.
[1:45:53] He's striving. He's wanting to do things
[1:45:56] in us as individuals and in this
[1:45:58] congregation.
[1:46:01] And perhaps we've been taken up with too
[1:46:03] much of just life,
[1:46:06] essential things, necessary things.
[1:46:13] Don't miss out
[1:46:16] whatever you do. Don't be one of the
[1:46:18] 380.
[1:46:22] be one of the 120.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; God did not
[1:46:31] speak against them. There's no scripture
[1:46:33] that chastises them.
[1:46:37] Nobody came forward and said, "You
[1:46:40] foolish, silly people. How did you miss
[1:46:42] that?"
[1:46:44] No, it just says
[1:46:46] he was seen of above 500 and 120 were
[1:46:50] filled. Say, "Oh God,
[1:46:53] don't let don't let me miss I'm speaking
[1:46:56] on your behalf. Don't let me miss this
[1:46:58] ceiling.
[1:47:00] Don't let me miss this birth.
[1:47:04] Don't let me miss this great
[1:47:05] opportunity.
[1:47:07] We're not here in an upper room to be
[1:47:10] filled. We're here in preparation
[1:47:15] of a change.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Of a change. If it took faith for them
[1:47:20] to get into the upper room, brother
[1:47:22] Brandham speaks about faith for healing.
[1:47:26] I'm not I'm not so interested in faith
[1:47:28] for healing right now. I'm interested in
[1:47:30] faith for the rapture.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Are you?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; That's what we want.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; That's more than everything. That's
[1:47:39] number one in our lives.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm not even interested in
[1:47:43] preaching. I'm not even interested in
[1:47:45] how the service ought to end. And I am
[1:47:48] just keenly aware that the Holy Spirit
[1:47:51] is reaching down deep into our hearts in
[1:47:54] this church and in this congregation.
[1:47:56] And I'd like you to be able to yield
[1:47:58] while the Holy Spirit is moving and
[1:48:00] saying, "I'm thine, oh Lord. I'm here. I
[1:48:03] I'm here to be the clay. I'm here to
[1:48:05] climb up on the potter's wheel. I'm here
[1:48:08] for you to speak, my Lord." And you'll
[1:48:10] find somebody saying, "Yay, Lord. I will
[1:48:13] do it." Amen.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; I charge you before God.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Don't let this little preacher preach in
[1:48:27] vain today.
[1:48:34] this the very God that put that image
[1:48:37] and stamped that imprint
[1:48:41] before the foundation of the world and
[1:48:43] brought you here and mingled
[1:48:47] husband to wife for centuries and
[1:48:49] hundreds of years and brought you here.
[1:48:53] This may be one of the most important
[1:48:55] moments in your life.
[1:48:57] You're feeling and sensing the Holy
[1:48:59] Spirit speaking.
[1:49:04] I wanted to just sing
[1:49:06] prayerfully, have thy own way, Lord.
[1:49:10] Have thy own way.
[1:49:15] You may be here and have never never
[1:49:18] given yourself unreservedly.
[1:49:22] This is the time to do it.
[1:49:25] This is a time
[1:49:28] I prayed for this service this morning.
[1:49:34] I prayed that God would
[1:49:37] do something. I thank God for you.
[1:49:41] My mind, my eyes go over this
[1:49:43] congregation. I thank God for you
[1:49:49] and I pray in the depths of my soul the
[1:49:53] best for you and God's prosper
[1:49:58] prosper your spiritual life.
[1:50:02] Whatever you do, don't live in the
[1:50:05] shadows.
[1:50:07] Don't live in the sidelines.
[1:50:11] Don't live non-committed.
[1:50:15] Don't live without zeal.
[1:50:20] Don't seek the easy path.
[1:50:27] That God,
[1:50:30] we're in a very, very
[1:50:35] critical time.
[1:50:39] We're in a rapture moment.
[1:50:41] [Music]
[1:50:43] friends or

[1:57:31] Lord Jesus how lovely you are. That's
[1:57:33] all I can say. How lovely you are.
[1:57:37] I trust. I pray.
[1:57:39] I desire, oh Lord, as I speak to you,
[1:57:42] that all that have been within the sound
[1:57:45] of my voice today,
[1:57:47] [Music]
[1:57:48] that they may recognize, that they may
[1:57:50] know that it's God
[1:57:54] speaking.
[1:57:56] It's the Holy Spirit wooing.
[1:57:59] It's a still small voice that perhaps
[1:58:02] been covered up with all kinds of
[1:58:04] affairs of life. And this life is or is
[1:58:07] is has been organized by the enemy of
[1:58:11] our soul.
[1:58:13] He tries to bring so many things in and
[1:58:16] so many things oh God that is uh
[1:58:20] opposite that to works against what it
[1:58:24] is you're seeking to do in our life. I
[1:58:26] pray father that this congregation and
[1:58:29] every man, woman and child will, Lord
[1:58:32] Jesus, by your voice and by your power
[1:58:36] and by your uncction, may they resist
[1:58:39] the devil. May they refuse his
[1:58:42] intrusion.
[1:58:44] May they refuse his suggestions.
[1:58:48] May they refuse his influence.
[1:58:51] And may they say yes to you now. I pray
[1:58:55] that the angels of God who your
[1:58:58] messenger has said, we can feel their
[1:59:02] influence. We can feel the effect of
[1:59:05] them. And they are here by the Holy
[1:59:08] Spirit under the direction of Almighty
[1:59:11] God to increase our faith that we might
[1:59:15] receive the full benefit of your word.
[1:59:18] Oh God, don't let it be lost. Don't let
[1:59:20] it trickle out. Don't let it just
[1:59:23] dissipate. Don't let it evaporate but
[1:59:26] let it let me be impregnated with it. Oh
[1:59:28] God in the name of Jesus permeate your
[1:59:31] people I pray. Oh God grant it. I would
[1:59:35] like this congregation to stand. I would
[1:59:37] like everyone who claims to be a
[1:59:38] believer to enter into prayer with me
[1:59:41] for these that are and many that perhaps
[1:59:44] even are not raised their hand or are
[1:59:47] not standing at this time. But there are
[1:59:50] needy needy ones friends. There are
[1:59:53] needy ones. I'd like you to pray with
[1:59:55] me. Oh God. Oh God, I pray that you'll
[1:59:59] meet the need and the and the hungry.
[2:00:02] May the hungry be fed. Oh God, may feeds
[2:00:06] be broken.
[2:00:08] May the enemy's work be shattered in the
[2:00:12] name of Jesus Christ. Work with my
[2:00:15] brother, Lord. Work with my sister.
[2:00:17] bring them into that very place of a
[2:00:20] perfect harmony and and oneness with the
[2:00:22] Holy Spirit, oneness as a bridegroom and
[2:00:26] the bride. Oh Lord Jesus, our lovely
[2:00:28] bridegroom as I listened to your
[2:00:30] messenger and he said it was the most
[2:00:32] wonderful most wonderful thing of his
[2:00:34] life was to have fellowship with you. I
[2:00:37] pray that will be our testimony, oh God,
[2:00:39] this morning before we leave this place
[2:00:42] that we will be able to say, "We love
[2:00:44] you because you first loved us. We love
[2:00:47] you because you gave yourself to us. You
[2:00:50] gave yourself for us. We love you
[2:00:52] because you had us in your mind when you
[2:00:54] were on the cross when you died for us.
[2:00:56] We love you, Lord. We love you, Lord. We
[2:00:59] love you, Lord. Oh, we thank you, Lord
[2:01:02] Jesus. We're here to worship you. We're
[2:01:04] here to exalt your more most glorious
[2:01:07] name. We're here to yield ourselves to
[2:01:10] you. We're here to give ourselves to you
[2:01:14] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:18] I'm thine uh without one plea.
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:27] No.
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:31] Here's
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:38] the way. You don't have to fix yourself
[2:01:40] up, friends.
[2:01:44] You don't have to wait till tomorrow.
[2:01:47] And I think if I asked you as an honest
[2:01:50] congregation, do you believe that
[2:01:52] there's more for you?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; You'd say yes.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's where I'm pointing
[2:01:58] you to. That's what I'm directing you
[2:02:00] to.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; There's something former. Do you think
[2:02:03] that God could more perfect the image,
[2:02:06] his image in you? I say, "Yay." Release
[2:02:09] that. Release that in the name of the
[2:02:12] Lord. Do you agree with that? Just
[2:02:14] release that while you're here. That's
[2:02:15] why we're here. We're here to do
[2:02:17] business. You saw the people in China.
[2:02:19] They're just hugging one another and
[2:02:21] weeping over one another that in that
[2:02:24] first communion service. Oh, how
[2:02:26] precious it must have been to them. But
[2:02:28] you know what? Don't let Satan tell you
[2:02:30] any different. It doesn't have to be any
[2:02:32] different than that. Right this moment.
[2:02:34] Right this moment. You can have that
[2:02:36] love relationship with him. We just give
[2:02:39] ourselves just as I am without one plea.
[2:02:45] I am
[2:02:48] [Music]
[2:02:50] one
[2:02:53] of
[2:02:55] my
[2:02:57] [Music]
[2:03:05] thy
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:10] to the
[2:03:13] land
[2:03:16] of God.
[2:03:21] I
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:27] just as
[2:03:30] I am
[2:03:32] and waiting
[2:03:37] till
[2:03:39] my soul

[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:51] and bre
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:08] so often in brother Brown's messages and
[2:04:12] then After service, I just sang some of
[2:04:15] these old hymns and worship one after
[2:04:18] the other. Let us just enter into that
[2:04:20] worship. And yeah, I just want to
[2:04:23] encourage you just yield to him. You
[2:04:26] feel your spirit being broken? Say,
[2:04:28] "Melt me, oh God." Oh, this world, you
[2:04:32] know, we're almost case hardened. Can
[2:04:34] you agree with that? Almost case
[2:04:37] hardened with this. The world is so
[2:04:39] harsh. It's so cold. And his spirit is
[2:04:43] so tender and so warm and and so
[2:04:47] different from this world. It's so
[2:04:50] different.
[2:04:54] You've tasted of it at some time at some
[2:04:56] point. Say, "Lord, take me back to that
[2:04:58] moment." You're standing here desiring
[2:05:01] it. I want you to be expecting it. I
[2:05:04] want to sing, "Oh, to be like thee. Oh,
[2:05:06] to be like thee in this song, the course
[2:05:09] stamp thine own image. Yes.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to lift up your voice and
[2:05:15] let your lips
[2:05:17] speak these words. Stamp thine own image
[2:05:19] deep on my heart.

[2:11:17] [Music]
[2:11:24] heart.
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:11:36] I'd like to sing. Yes. I'll say yes.
[2:11:40] Yes.
[2:11:42] Yes. That's all this song says. Maybe I
[2:11:46] don't know. Maybe some of the young
[2:11:47] people
[2:11:49] you don't get a chance to maybe express
[2:11:52] it. If you want to express it
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:11:58] in a prayer or in a song, I'll say yes.
[2:12:02] I'll say yes.
[2:12:04] You'd like to just testify, not only the
[2:12:06] congregation, but to the people on the
[2:12:09] internet, I wouldn't ask you to come up
[2:12:10] and sing, but if you want to come up and
[2:12:13] just say, "Brother Ed, I'd like to join
[2:12:16] you and give this testimony
[2:12:18] to the people." I am saying yes. Here
[2:12:22] I am. I'm giving. I wouldn't do it if
[2:12:26] you didn't mean it from the depths of
[2:12:27] your soul. But if if you'd like to join
[2:12:29] me here on the platform, Brother Ed is
[2:12:32] saying yes. I'm saying that to this
[2:12:34] congregation. I'm trying to say yes to
[2:12:36] him.
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:41] But I want to do everything according to
[2:12:43] the word of God.
[2:12:46] Absolutely. They want my life to be
[2:12:47] lived out according to the word of God.
[2:12:51] So let's just sing the chorus and the
[2:12:53] young people. Some young men and women
[2:12:56] want to join me. You're not coming to
[2:12:58] sing. You're singing to make a
[2:13:00] declaration.
[2:13:01] I am saying yes.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; I'll sing yes.
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:15] I'll say yes.
[2:13:20] Yes.
[2:13:23] Yes.
[2:13:26] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:13:32] I'll say yes, Lord.
[2:13:38] I say yes. Yes.
[2:13:42] Yes.
[2:13:45] [Music]
[2:13:49] I'll say yes.
[2:13:54] Yes.
[2:14:00] [Music]
[2:14:05] Hey.
[2:14:09] [Music]
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:29] Yes.
[2:14:39] Yes, Lord.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; You young people that are standing here,
[2:14:47] you've got to take
[2:14:49] God is putting it on you on your
[2:14:51] shoulders in your heart.
[2:14:55] You're the only people that God can use
[2:14:57] are those who say yes.
[2:15:00] Whatever happens to you, be it good, bad
[2:15:04] or indifferent, whatever happens,
[2:15:08] God is looking.
[2:15:10] Only God can work with those people that
[2:15:12] say yes.
[2:15:15] And if you just lay everything down,
[2:15:18] take brother Biscll's counsel today.
[2:15:22] I felt
[2:15:24] the breeze and the of your passing by as
[2:15:28] I kept my eyes closed and I felt within
[2:15:30] my heart, this is them.
[2:15:33] This is the ones must carry this message
[2:15:36] straight through to the coming of the
[2:15:37] Lord.
[2:15:40] Determine within your heart, I won't
[2:15:42] allow anything to deter me, nothing to
[2:15:45] entice me. I won't allow anything to
[2:15:49] affect my life.
[2:15:51] I'm laying it down
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; as of this moment. I'm selling out to
[2:15:56] God.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Will you say amen?
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; You when you leave this platform say I
[2:16:09] am leaving with full expectations. One
[2:16:12] day,
[2:16:13] whether it's one day, one week, or 10
[2:16:15] years, one day, I will feel that sweep.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; And whatever, whether I live to see it
[2:16:21] or I pass and come in the resurrection,
[2:16:25] I'll be just ahead of you.
[2:16:28] And we'll meet
[2:16:31] around the supper table.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; And your name will be there. And you'll
[2:16:36] have a reservation.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; It'll be there. Amen.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm proud of you. I'm so thankful
[2:16:46] for you young people. You are the
[2:16:49] strength. You've got the strength of
[2:16:50] your youth. G youth. Give every bit of
[2:16:53] it, every ounce of it to Christ.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To the kingdom of God.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; You know that minister that was in the
[2:17:03] church from China?
[2:17:07] He'd been in the message two and a half
[2:17:08] years.
[2:17:11] and just God got him out of a Bible
[2:17:13] school.
[2:17:14] God doesn't have to get you out of a
[2:17:16] Bible school. You're here. You're in the
[2:17:18] message. You're grounded. You've got
[2:17:19] your parents and friends and your peers.
[2:17:23] Oh, say, "I'm going all the way."
[2:17:26] Hallelujah. If Brother Biscell at my age
[2:17:29] can just have that same kind of zeal,
[2:17:31] I'm passing it off to you in the name of
[2:17:33] Jesus Christ. You can have the same
[2:17:35] thing. Let the world throw all of all
[2:17:38] the pleasure in front of you and all the
[2:17:40] potential and possibilities and money
[2:17:42] and wealth and whatever thing. Don't let
[2:17:44] pay any attention. Don't pay any
[2:17:46] attention. It won't distract me.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; I've got one thing in my goal.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will be in that upper
[2:17:53] room. I'll be in that chamber. I will be
[2:17:55] in that rapture. I will be in that
[2:17:57] number.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[2:19:25] Dear heavenly father,
[2:19:28] my Lord and my God,
[2:19:33] in whom we trust,
[2:19:37] all of our confidence, all of our trust
[2:19:41] and faith is in you, Almighty God, who
[2:19:44] has created heavens and earth and all
[2:19:46] things that are therein. You've given
[2:19:48] life to us and thus we are here for this
[2:19:52] little short span of time. And I see
[2:19:55] this youth that's here on the platform
[2:19:58] and see their parents that are here and
[2:20:01] have been faithful. Oh God,
[2:20:04] bless them and reward them. I pray. I
[2:20:07] pray that you will direct every footstep
[2:20:10] Lord of this. We cannot be every place
[2:20:13] every all the time but you are there all
[2:20:16] the time. Direct their footsteps, Lord,
[2:20:19] of these precious young people and those
[2:20:21] throughout the building. Direct their
[2:20:23] footsteps. Direct their decisions. Many
[2:20:26] of them are coming into decision making
[2:20:29] time and important time of their life.
[2:20:31] Direct them, oh God. Oh God, keep them
[2:20:35] from entanglements. Keep them from the
[2:20:38] world. Keep them from impurities. Keep
[2:20:41] them, oh Lord, and reserve them unto
[2:20:43] yourself as a testimony.
[2:20:46] Reserve them to yourself.
[2:20:49] Preserve them, Lord.
[2:20:52] Reserve them.
[2:20:54] Keep them. Preserve them. Oh God.
[2:20:59] Preserve them. Oh God. Preserve them
[2:21:02] from the entanglements and the
[2:21:03] heartaches.
[2:21:05] Satan has tried to devise every kind of
[2:21:08] thing. But I stand here as a servant of
[2:21:12] Christ against every demon of hell. And
[2:21:15] I declare that these have been
[2:21:17] bloodwashed by the blood of Jesus
[2:21:20] Christ. The seed of the woman has
[2:21:23] crushed the serpent's head.
[2:21:26] I rejoice.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; I say glory to God.
[2:21:31] Your promise is yay and amen. The seed
[2:21:34] of the woman has crushed the serpent's
[2:21:37] head.
[2:21:38] His image is destroyed.
[2:21:41] in the image of the Lord God himself is
[2:21:45] being formed up. Oh, step thine in own
[2:21:49] image and deep upon our heart. Oh God,
[2:21:54] stamp thine image within this being
[2:21:57] filled with the Holy Ghost those not yet
[2:21:59] filled.
[2:22:01] Turn them, oh Lord.
[2:22:04] I pray that they will turn upside down
[2:22:07] their area, their place of work.
[2:22:11] In the name of Jesus Christ, raise them
[2:22:14] up as a mighty army. Lord, what you're
[2:22:16] doing in China, the same God is present
[2:22:19] here today. I pray you'll bless the dear
[2:22:22] ones in China. Oh God, many of them are
[2:22:25] young people as well. Bless them, I
[2:22:27] pray. Bless brother way, other brothers,
[2:22:30] ministering brothers in the name of
[2:22:33] Jesus Christ. Empower them, I ask. And
[2:22:36] now, Father, we wait on you further
[2:22:39] during this afternoon and for this
[2:22:41] evening's service. Give your servant, I
[2:22:44] pray, oh God, words of life and let them
[2:22:48] be anchored into our hearts. Speak to
[2:22:50] me, Lord. Speak to me, I pray. In Jesus
[2:22:53] Christ's name, I commit the people to
[2:22:55] you. Dismiss us with your grace now.
[2:23:00] Amen. Amen. Before you shake hands and
[2:23:03] while you shake hands, look for me
[2:23:08] for I will be there too. And you can
[2:23:11] greet one another and that'll also be
[2:23:13] part of your testimony. Look for me.
[2:23:17] I'll be there too.
[2:23:19] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:22] Going to be there, fellas. Hallelujah.
