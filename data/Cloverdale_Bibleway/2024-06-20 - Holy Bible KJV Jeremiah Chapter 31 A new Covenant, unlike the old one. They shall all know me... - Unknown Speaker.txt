Description:
A new covenant as fulfilled at Calvary by Jesus Christ, to the house of Israel, and to all the Gentiles thereafter, forever.

JEREMIAH 31:31
  31    Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:

JEREMIAH 31:32
  32    Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day [that] I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:

JEREMIAH 31:33
  33    But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.

JEREMIAH 31:34
  34    And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the book of The Prophet Jeremiah chapter 31 at the same time saith the Lord will I be the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people thus saith the Lord the people which were left of the sword found Grace in the wilderness even Israel when I went to cause him to rest the Lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yay I have loved thee with an Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee again and I will build thee and thou shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make Mary Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria the Planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things for there shall be a day that the Watchmen upon the Mount Ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord Our God for thus saith the Lord sing with gladness for Jacob and Shout among the chief of the Nations publish ye praise ye and say oh Lord save thy people the remnant of Israel behold I will bring them from the North country and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the Blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither they shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters and a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for I am a father to Israel and Ephraim is my firstborn hear the word of the Lord oh ye nations and declare it in the AES a far off and say he that scattered Israel will gather him and keep him as a Shepherd doth his flock for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow anymore at all then shall the Virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for I will turn their mourning into joy and Will Comfort them and make them Rejoice from their sorrow and I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the Lord thus saith the Lord a voice was heard in Rama lamentation and bitter weeping Rahal weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not thus saith the Lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy Work shall be rewarded saith the Lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy and there is hope in thine end saith the Lord that thy children shall come again to their own border I have surely heard Ephraim boning himself that thus thou Hast chastised Me and I was chastised as a bulock unaccustomed to the Yoke turn thou me and I shall be turned for thou art the Lord my God surely after that I was turned I repented and after that I was instructed I smote upon my thigh I was ashamed yay even confounded because I did Bear the reproach of my youth is Ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since I spake against him I do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him I will surely have mercy upon Him saith the Lord set the up way marks make thee High heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wantest turn again oh Virgin of Israel turn again to these thy cities how long wilt thou go about oh thou backsliding daughter for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall Compass a man thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel as yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof when I shall bring again their captivity the Lord bless thee Oh habitation of justice and mountain of Holiness and there shall dwell in Judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks for I have satiated the weary soul and I have replenished every sorrowful Soul upon this I awake and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me behold the days come saith the Lord that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of Beast and it shall come to pass that like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will I watch over them to build and to plant saith the Lord in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the the children's teeth are set on edge but everyone shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I was in husband unto them saeth the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more thus saith the Lord which giveth the Sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the Moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof Roar the Lord of hosts is his name if those ordinances depart from before me saith the Lord then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever thus saith the Lord If Heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done say the Lord behold the days come saeth the Lord that the city shall be built to the Lord from the Tower of Hanan unto the Gate of the corner and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb and shall Compass about to goth and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of kedron Unto the corner of the horse gate toward the East shall be holy unto the Lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down anymore forever
