TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] From this time on that, [Music] oh my hope is in the Lord forever more. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you all. Amen. I felt just to start maybe the service a little differently. Maybe we could just stand. I want to sing that chorus. I love him. I love him. I'm going to ask if our brother Tim Do would just come open the service in a word of prayer for us. Just praying in the study before the service, our brother Kyle prayed for us. He start out, "Lord Jesus, we love you." And I thought, "Yes, Lord. Maybe we could just sing that to him." The prophet loved this song. I thought it was so fitting. Almost every one of the seals messages, he ends the service with this song. I love him. I love him because he first loved me. Amen. So, why don't we just sing it as our brother Tim would come and just ask the Lord's blessing on the service this morning. Amen. Oh, and I love him. [Music] Oh, I love him. Be he first love me. Oh, and just my son. [Music] on Calary [Music] Calvary tree. Amen. Once more I love him. Oh, how I love him. Oh, I love him because he first loved me. [Music] When he purchases my salation, oh cal [Music] tree. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tim, would you come, please? Thank you. [Music] Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, our hearts ring out in love towards you. We love you because you first loved us. &gt;&gt; Your love was expressed to us. It found us in the different walks of life that we were in the muck and the mire of the clay. And Lord, you picked us up with your mighty hand. You redeemed us by your grace. You brought us to sit in heavenly places in Jesus Christ. Lord, truly, as the psalmist wrote, we will enter your gates with thanksgiving. We will come into your courts with praise. This is the day that you have made. We will be glad. We will rejoice in it. Lord, we come, oh God, to praise your name. We come to magnify you. We come to exalt you. This is the highlight of our lives that we could gather with saints of like precious faith. No matter what the week has had for us, no matter what has unfolded in our lives, Lord, we come into your presence and we shut everything else out. We are so happy to be in the presence of our father. We are so thrilled, oh God, to worship you and to adore you. And we want your presence to be here this morning in a mighty way. Oh God, we want you to anoint the songs. We want you to anoint the music. We want you to anoint every aspect of the service, especially as your servant comes behind the sacred desk. Father, may you move into the vessel once more. Get the man part out of the way. And Lord, use the gift once more for the benefit of the bride of Jesus Christ this morning, Lord. how we so appreciate your love gifts, Father. And Lord, we feed on them, everyone. You know the needs that are in our midst. May you touch the needs, Lord. May you, as you're in our midst, may you come by each and every way, Father. Each and every one, Lord, is important to you. And Lord, may you touch lives, &gt;&gt; Lord. May you lift up, may you raise up burdens, Lord. &gt;&gt; May sicknesses be healed this morning. Lord, the word does deliver. &gt;&gt; Great is your word that you send out, oh God. And we ask, Father, that you would bless each and every need that may those that came in needy go out whole. &gt;&gt; We ask it for your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless your name. &gt;&gt; And why don't you greet one another as you have your seats? trust you'll forgive me from straying from the normal order, but I felt that it would be good for us this morning just to tell the Lord we love him the beginning of the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, brother John. Thank you. Amen. How great thou art, Sister Leno. Oh Lord my God, [Music] when I in awome wonder consider all the world thy hands have made.

Hallelujah. It's good to be gathered this morning. Amen. I'm just going to ask if the brothers would come to take the offering at this time. We're just going to carry on in this atmosphere of worship even through the giving. Amen. We do just have two prayer requests. Maybe as the brothers would come, I would just ask our brother Glenn if he would ask the offering on the the blessing on the offering and on these prayer requests. Brother Milo was just asking that we would please remember our brother Roman and sister Sonia in Slovenia. They are translating the message into Slovenian. They're now working on the sixth seal and they're asking for guidance and wisdom for the translation and also for a job for brother Roman. And please continue to remember brother Rock also who is trying to establish himself in a small group in Slovenia. Amen. Let's just head back. God's blessing on the bride around the world. Amen. Also a request from the Revas family. Please pray for our neighbor Jerry Layman. He went in for surgery to clear a blocked artery in his neck and suffered heart failure. Just asking for a full recovery and return to strength. Amen. And may the Lord use this situation. Brother Glenn, would you just ask the Lord to bless the offering this morning? If there's a need on your heart that you just like to lift before the Lord this morning. Amen. We serve a great God. He still does miracles. Amen. Thank you, brother Glenn. Let's bow our heads and our hearts. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for the opportunity to be here, Lord, and to just bask in your presence, oh God. Just sensing your presence here from the outset, Lord, and as a brother Ryan said, we serve a great God. There's no God like you, Lord. And we're thankful for that, Lord, that we serve the only and living God, the one that manifests himself amongst his people, Lord. And we thank you for that, Lord Jesus. We just pray now for these needs, Lord, not remembering them all. The one with the artery, the uh sickness, Lord. We just pray that you touch him, Lord. And Lord, that he would realize that it was the God of heaven that touched him &gt;&gt; and he give give you glory, Lord Jesus. And &gt;&gt; Lord, for the service this morning, Lord, we just want to rest in you, Lord, but at the same time, pull on the word, Lord, as our pastor would come. We just pray that you'd get the man out of the way, Lord, and that he would speak your word, Lord, from your throne, Lord, to our hearts this morning, Lord, that our hearts would be changed. And also, Lord, for the the giving, the people will be giving of their substance. Oh God, we just pray you take this, multiply it for your kingdom, oh God, that this would be used for your glory and your honor. We pray. We just commit our lives now into your hands, oh God, for your glory and your honor in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Just as the offer is being taken, Sister Elena. Oh heavenly father, I appreciate you. Oh my heavenly father, I appreciate you, Lord. I love you. I adore you. I bow out before you. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Holy Spirit, you're a comforter. Oh, Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Oh, Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. [Music] Lead me. You guide me. I know you're dwelling inside me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort. And we sing that verse again. Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. You lead me. You guide me. And you're dwelling inside me. Holy Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Amen. And we want to greet each and every one of you the name of our Lord Jesus. And we do have a special maybe Sister Tiffany, Sister Elena, and Brother Caleb, if you can get ready for your song. We have a number of greetings we wanted to extend. Maybe rather than just have everyone stand, we'll just call out a number of names. We have our brother John and sister Eningga Hagenau here from Holland. Brother Es's parents are with us for a couple weeks. Oh, here. God bless you. Nice to have you here with us. Also, Sister Lisa St. John's mother, Sister Gene Watkins is here for a few weeks. Amen. Brother Murphy's nephew Franklin is here. God bless you. And also Sister Amanda Drake's family is here. I didn't see where where they were, but her sister Joanne and her brother-in-law Gard Kaiser from Saskatchewan. And also her parents, Jake and Emily Dick, and their daughter Bethany. Amen. We just trust that each and every one of you would feel welcome in the house of the Lord this morning. It's wonderful to be gathered together again in the house of the Lord. Amen. We didn't have a midweek service. Felt like a long time since we've been together, but I was looking forward to this morning. Amen. And I trust you've put your order in. Our pastor's going to come and speak to us. Amen. We do have a praise report from brother Matthew Redell. Thank you for all who attended the Lynon outreach in Tlea Reservation. God and truth was on display and thousands of tracks were given and spoken of eternal life. Amen. And now we leave it all in God's hands. Amen. Cast your bread upon the waters and after many days, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ready service today. Relax. Enjoy the presence of the Lord. Amen.

I lift your holy name for Jehovah. I [Music] over your [Music] I am. You are my [Music] king. [Music] The father has a plan, though it's hard to see it now. You feel you're walking all alone. But he is there, no doubt. When the storm around you rages and you're tossed to and fro, when you're faced with life's decisions, not sure which way to go, stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. [Music] When the enemy surrounds you and the walls are closing in. When the tide is swiftly rising and you wonder where he's been, friend, there never was a moment when his arms weren't reaching out. You can rest assured and be secure. God is moving right now. Stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. [Music] When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. Stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. The answer will come, but only in his time. Stand still and let God move. &gt;&gt; Stand still and let God move. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a good uh what a good in encouragement or instruction. Stand still. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I'm going to be standing here for a little while, but I won't be standing still. Exactly. But I am going to be standing still waiting for God to do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's uh it's just a marvelous thing to stand back and watch God do things, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It's been wonderful. Uh a lot of times we are the beneficiaries of of something that God has done and we don't even know it. So, part of my task up here is to let you know about some things that God does. God heals Sister Natasha, who you just heard singing. &gt;&gt; The sitter in the middle, she wasn't hasn't been able to sing for uh perhaps a month or more. And her voice was just in s cough and situation. And uh God healed her. &gt;&gt; God healed her. And I I didn't even really know what I was saying. I just shook hands with her and said, "When are you going to sing the other day and she sang at the camp and how thankful we are for that." Uh, and there's been an awful lot going on. I I think the uh uh the Lynen Fair has been on and and many of the congregation have been in attendance there to uh witness and that's been wonderful. We're happy about that. Brother Matthew Redell takes responsibility of organizing that and seeing that there's uh message books and other material that's available and we're really really thankful for that opportunity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said amen. &gt;&gt; That's good. Hey, we have we have souls that are worth 10,000 worlds. And we have uh uh Sister Sammy and brother Jason Kane. And they came as a result of last year's, wasn't it? Last year's sister or two years ago, was it two years ago? My time flies real quickly. Sister Sammy, why don't you stand up? Is Brother Jason there? All right, brother Jason. Here's two here as a result of the Lynen Fair two years ago. Hallelujah. Not members of the church, members of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They heard a sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then also uh there was a door opened to the uh a meeting taking place on the reservation at uh to to Tulip and Washington. and I think uh brother Roberto and uh sister Rosemary Valencia through their uh connection there they uh we found out about it and uh was given a invitation and I don't know how it all took place and brother Matthew Redell uh uh made arrangements etc and a number of group of people went down they were having a meeting there and brother Kenandes uh spoke some words brother Ken I'm going to ask you to come up in a moment and just give us a little summary and and uh how how you felt about it. Uh but before brother Ken comes, we also want to say that brother Ken and sister Linda Ordeal were able to go down and uh be with the Cobb family. Sister Cobb senior passed away and her funeral I believe was day before yesterday, wasn't it? And uh so uh they were able to give greetings. We we held them on our heart. And I mentioned also that she had passed away during camp. And uh brother Jeff and sister Debbie, sister Debbie's uh daughter of the Cobb family. So brother Jeff and Sister Debbie Jenkins from Limo, Ohio. They were there, of course, and many other family members and friends, and they were able to uh be with them and to have some fellowship with them. We're happy you were able to go, brother Ken. And Linda, God bless you. Uh we have greetings also from Brother Craig Boore, who was the speaker at the camp. And brother Craig felt that they were some of his best meetings that he's been in. Uh that's what brother John Andy's was saying that he made some comment about it I guess when he got home. But he sent me a text yesterday and wanted to be remembered to the church. So we just say God bless brother Craig. I can tell you he he gave it all he had and he allowed God to use him as a as a vessel and we're we want to be ready to hear that whatever whatever God has for us. Uh, brother Andy's, why don't you just come and give us a a brief of of the uh, what's taking place? I mean, things are taking place at Lynen Fair. &gt;&gt; You know, we don't know much about what's happening daytoday, what happened up at Talop, but I'm interested. &gt;&gt; Brother Ken, glad you were there and able to share something to them. God bless you. Well, as uh brother Ed has said, brother Roberto is was the contact to be able to put this together. And uh he had gotten permission and the pastor had allowed us to maybe have some specials, testimonies, and I was to speak 30 minutes. And the main speaker was going to be a pastor and Indian brother from Montana because they're coming together on a on a group uh fellowship from different uh reservations. Well, he couldn't come. There was some activity in Montana and he couldn't come. So, it was thought possibly uh speaking would be extended to maybe an hour or so. And the pastor was supposed to be there at 5 when they were going to eat. and we had eaten earlier. We were going to meet him at 6. Well, he showed up almost at 7 when the service began. So, when we met him, uh he said that he said that I could bring a a short testimony uh maybe 10 minutes and he was going to preach. So, uh brother Roberto said to me, he said, "Boy, that changed fast." But God has a plan and he was putting it all together. So as we approached and we had u uh had a special uh singing I believe the uh parises uh sang &gt;&gt; the St. John's and um and then brother and then I gave a very short testimony and then brother Matthew uh he spoke on uh it was it truth he read a verse spoke a little bit on truth for maybe about 10 minutes and then he sat down well at this point we didn't have any permission to do anything further although we thought we did and so brother Matthew He uh during the service as the pastor was preaching and getting near the end, Pastor Ron, uh, Brother Matthew uh went over to Brother Roberto and says, "Now, do we have permission to put our literature out?" And he says, "Well, no, not that I know of." So, Brother Matthew, he put the table up. Uh, he put the the literature out. And when he was standing giving his short testimony, he said, "We have some gifts for you. gifts for you when you leave and of course the material was the gifts &gt;&gt; and that was there. Now that what was surprising God putting it all together the pastor when he got up and he was speaking and preaching and and moving around and most of them had Indian uh heritages in their background. He said that God had revealed to his wife two two years ago by a dream that there was going to come three tornadoes out of the north and the pastor kept speaking of uh Canada and he thought we were all from Canada which I didn't say anything different and so he was looking upon us to bring something out of it was going to be a blessing it was going to be a power of God he said and it was truth going to come out of Canada and come down for them. &gt;&gt; So the God even two years ago was working in the hearts to even have that said then. And then the people come up and they got the material and some said, "Oh, brother Brandham. Oh yes, I just love him." You know the opposite that you get sometimes. So God was moving on their hearts although they sang songs that we sing but their temple was quite different. and their doctrine and teachings and dress manner and everything was really the opposite of what we are. But it just takes the word of God &gt;&gt; and the seed to go to the elect and we don't know who they are, who she or he is. And then God will quicken that &gt;&gt; and that's what we're going for. Not to convert the whole church and re and reservations, but for one soul &gt;&gt; and that's God's business. And once that revelation strikes, no one could shut them up. Nobody could change them. This message is what they want. &gt;&gt; God bless you. And we plan to go again. The pastor said he wants me to come down and speak uh maybe in September. So, we'll just see what God does. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, listen. Uh we're going to stand in a moment and read the scripture, but just before I do, uh how many have seen this book, Uganda 2013? How many have this book? A lot less. Well, I'll tell you what. Uh one was given to me. And so I looked through it and I I just thought, "This is fabulous. This is incredible. Who put this book out? Well, Sister Beth Dingwall uh took the responsibility who to put it together and it is there'sund and I just counted them. There's a 191 pictures with notes of the of the work that the 16 did. 12 of the students plus the others that went with them went to Uganda. uh adding a ceiling to a church, doing work on a church, sisters teaching others to sew, and they took five of the best sewing machines that you could find. Uh the the hub and and uh computers were taken and the hub was set up and training sessions were set up with the with the ministers. Then they were asked to go to a school and brother Tim was to speak there and uh they didn't know how many students there's 600 students there. Then brother Kim Dingwald found there's about 250 of those 600 that are orphans and have no one to support them. And this brother just has a burden to give them an education. And so, Brother Kim uh stood here and made uh we sent a letter out actually with a faith challenge report saying that if anyone wish to support a child, I think it's $30 a month. And that's not very much to give a child education and and care for them. And that turned out to I think there was about 30 that replied, but if you don't have this book, uh we're not selling anything, but it's not free. If you'd like one, I think that you could arrange to get one maybe from the office through the office. I have about 15, which I got. You can't have them. I just got those. You'll have to order your own. And anyone who wants one, I would suggest you put your name in quickly and find out how much they are. I don't know. Anything over the price of just getting them printed, uh, we'll will go to the school. uh the school can use uh brother Terry, is that all right? Uh so he he's he's agreeing. All right. Uh because we want to help our own school as well. But that's I'm not making a plug for our school. However, I'm a great supporter of the school. &gt;&gt; I believe to get our young people and children taught by those kind of students that we have and teachers that we have and staff that we have. I say God bless BCA. people can think whatever they want to think of that. I'm just glad I don't have to go to school anymore from the schools that I see around the country. And and then uh and and then there was a work done towards a radio broadcast in a tribal language and that is going to be happening very very soon. We've been getting all the information. So, if you don't want if if you'd like to have one of these, you call the office or see Sister Beth Dingwall or however she'll be the one who has to order them. And uh and I'm just enthused about what God is doing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you know what, friends? I I'm I'm passionate about God's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm enthused about God's work. And I don't care who does it or how it happens or who's at Tulip Tulip Tulip or who's speaking or who's witnessing or who's down at Lynen or uh for seven or eight years we were at the at the fair in uh in Vancouver the P& it was just great. uh in fact is my wife and I were on an airplane flying overseas and they decided to show a movie and we didn't have any headsets of course but uh the thing came on the screen you know and and here the movie was shot in Vancouver and uh part of it was uh they were doing at the pe fair fairgrounds and and and here they they they spanned our booth that truly Elijah shall first come. And I was sitting on an airplane, but I had to say amen. That sounds fine to me. And and God, I guess, just put them there for that reason. But we had we had souls out of that. And one soul's worth how much? &gt;&gt; Say it again. &gt;&gt; 10. And more. &gt;&gt; Eternal life. Aren't you glad you're saved? Let's let's stand and let's just sing. Uh I'm a new creation. Is that what I said? Oh yeah. There's been a change in me. That's about the same thing [Music] in me. Since Jesus set me free. I've been to Calary. I'm born again. I shall not turn around. Oh my solid ground. Someday I will crown. Oh, once more. Let everyone sing there's been a change in me. When Jesus set me free, I'll bring you to Calary. I am I [Music] someday I'll wear a crown. Oh, what a change. I'm going to like make it again. &gt;&gt; There's been a change in me since Jesus set me free. I've been to Calary. I'm born again. Born again. I cannot cannot turn around. My feet are on solid ground. Someday I'll wear a crown. Oh, what a change. With our heads bowed, heavenly father, how we thank you. There has indeed been a change, a transformation, transforming power by the power of the spoken word of God. We thank you that we have a thus sayith the Lord. And father, it has had such an effect. And we thank you for it. And we pray this morning that the Holy Spirit will come and just deliver the word to every single heart that is ready to receive. And I pray, Father, there'll be a moving of your Holy Spirit. May people hear your voice, not a man's voice. We're not here for that. We're not here for religion. We're not here for churchity. We're here, oh God, not just to attend a service, but may we receive something of eternal value. &gt;&gt; We pray in the name of Jesus Christ and for his glory alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll invite you to turn in your Bible if you would to Hebrews the 10th chapter. And I'll ask you to be very attentive if you would please. as little movement as possible because I'll need your you'll need your full concentration to follow uh the thoughts today because uh even in my own studies over the last probably three or more weeks on this subject. It's been a very uh very wonderful time. I want to start reading at verse one. Chapter 10, Hebrews verse one. For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect. For then would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. But in those sacrifices, there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come in the volume of the book, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God. Above then, above when he said, "Sacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings, and offerings for sin, thou wilt not, neither hath pleasure therein, which are offered by the law." Then said he, "Lo, I come to do thy will, oh God." He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often of times uh the same sacrifices which can never take away sin. But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for the sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foottool. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may God bless his word as you have your saints. For those that attend the service regularly, you will remember the last time uh that I ministered, I spoke on Elijah and the altar. And uh I want to speak on Elijah and the sacrifice. So this is part two of Elijah and the altar. Uh I read how Elijah was confronted by the 400 prophets of Baal and uh he had an altar. They had an altar. Uh but he rebuilt the altar. He rebuilt the altar. And I I did not just draw a like a p a mental picture, but in fact went into scripture to show very clearly and distinctly that the altar actually is your heart. And your heart is not just your muscle that's pumping blood. Your heart is that inner man, that inner person, that seat of emotion, that seat of uh the inner person in all of your uh which is even more than the mind. It's not the mind, but it's that the real you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Down inside &gt;&gt; and that it took Elijah. It took the word of God &gt;&gt; by a vindicated prophet &gt;&gt; to rebuild that altar and put the heart in position. &gt;&gt; Now an all an altar has a purpose and the altars are built for the purpose of sacrifice. And so in speaking of sacrifice now uh I want to say very quickly that the sacrifices of the entire Old Testament are rather difficult to relate to our life. But I want to tie it together where you will see it does relate very very uh conclusively to our present life. And I will say this just so you get a a good start that your heart is the altar. Without saying a whole lot of different words, but your heart is the altar. The altar can only be arranged and set in in the right place as Elijah was called. He's a restoring prophet. And Elijah, the spirit of Elijah bringing forth the word of God was to turn the hearts of the people. &gt;&gt; And even Elijah said, "And let the Lord let the people know that the Lord God has heard. &gt;&gt; Let fire come down and consume this sacrifice and let the people know that I have done all things according to your word." And their their hearts have been turned back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a rearrangement &gt;&gt; of their heart &gt;&gt; of their of their whole direction and their thought and their conviction and everything because up to this time Baal had become very prominent. But fire came down and consumed the sacrifice and the and the water that he had poured on it and all of those things. But now I have some very very unique things to say about the altar and about the sacrifice. We've dealt with the altar. Now we want to deal with the sacrifice. Altars are for the purpose of sacrifice. &gt;&gt; So your heart your heart arranged by the word of God. God so God made you. &gt;&gt; God sent you here. You're not here just to wander around aimlessly like a bunch of ants on an antill. We have a purpose. &gt;&gt; God has a purpose in you being birthed here. &gt;&gt; Now, some may not feel any purpose and maybe there is no purpose in their life. They live and die. We we we're not here. We as believers are not here just like animals. We've come and live and breathe and eat and so on so forth and die and and turn back to the soil. That's not our purpose here. God who created all things had a divine purpose and that purpose is not going to be made known to us by some institution &gt;&gt; or by some you know theological seminary &gt;&gt; or by some learned man or men or government or whatever more we can't entrust our soul to that you might say you that are visiting here might say well what am I doing I'm only going to echo what God has already confirmed with a supernatural vindication. &gt;&gt; Lots of people have, you know, they have their leaders and their apostles and their prophets and their whatever more. I just want one to step forward that had the vindication of brother Brandham &gt;&gt; for thousands of times times thousands &gt;&gt; publicly not in not in a corner publicly. &gt;&gt; No leader has done it. No pope has done it. No cardinal has done it. No bishop has done it. No overseer has done it. No man has done it because it's not humanly possible. It's not man. &gt;&gt; It's God in a man doing it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And this congregation who has that conviction and knows that that's the truth and your soul hangs on that truth. You want to declare with with joy in your heart, thank God. for the day that he caught a hold of me and I'm changed forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And your heart, your life has been made to be uh your heart has been made to be arranged by God himself. &gt;&gt; And for a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now the only life that was able to be the sacrifice was the life of Jesus Christ. And so I'm just trying to frame it just right to give you a give a give you a quick start. But the the all the sacrifices of the Old Testament, you'll have a hard time relating to them. So I didn't want to lose you with that. I'm going to name a bunch of them. and and but I have scriptures also where God says, "I'm not interested in your sacrifices. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in burnt sacrifices." And there's one phrase that we can all remember. Obedience is better than sacrifices. I've had people read the Old Testament and they said, "My, it is it is so gruesome." They were just killing and slaying and killing and slaying. That's right. But the scripture, it wasn't just that God wanted people to slay &gt;&gt; animals. It was that was a obedience &gt;&gt; to the word of God. That was demonstrating obedience to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And that's the key. And that's why he could say obedience is better than sacrifice. So with that then we will uh launch into launch into the scripture a little bit further in the message why it had to be shepherds. So we go I just go to the beginning of Eden's sacrifice at the beginning Adam and Eve standing there in the presence of God to hear his message to them. They had draped about them about their loins skin of sheep. The first message was ever heard was given uh over the top of a dead sheep skin that God had slew and wrapped Adam and Eve in after they had tried to make their own religion of fig leaves. It wouldn't work. Sheep sacrifice had been instituted for the atonement since the very beginning. He said sheep sacrifice. So that was the beginning sacrifice. And and and the word sacrifice and it's hundreds of times in the Bible. Sacrifice simply means slaughter or to kill. It is something. And when we think of sacrifice, we usually think of something that has died or expired and doesn't have its life anymore. I don't think there's anyone here. In fact, as I feel absolutely confident, no one here has slain an animal recently. And I can tell you, I've been to Israel a number of times and I've talking to Orthodox Jewish people and they also do not continue on. Even though they maintain 613 regulations and laws of the Old Testament, yet the main one which was to slay an animal, a Passover lamb, they don't do. And they have some other function and they've got some other explanation. And so we have a hard time, in fact, is almost an impossible time to get our minds around the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which is the centerpiece of the Old Testament. It is a bleeding animals and the and the various there was burnt offering. Here's just a few of them. There was burnt offering. There was sin offering. There was a guilt or trespass offering. There was peace offerings. There were thank offerings. There were free will offerings. And that's key. Free will offerings. There was a wave offering. There was a heave heave offering. And they all had significance and meanings. There was fire offering. There was a drink offering. There was a incense offering. There was a frankincense offering. There was sacrifice upon sacrifice upon sacrifice and yet we say well we believe the Bible which we do and yet uh we do not do any of those. So where is the answer? Of course, the answer is that Jesus Christ is the only one when God's word, think of it now, God's word, follow it. God's word became flesh. When it became flesh, God looked on that, lo, a body hast thou prepared me? in offerings of sin and so on. Thou wst not, but a body hast thou prepared me. God looked on that body because that was the embodiment of his word. And and Christ was obedient to every word. It was obedience &gt;&gt; to the word of God. And God looked upon that obedient one and said, "Thou art my beloved son." in in whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; I'm pleased. Now, here's come one. And he became the supreme sacrifice that was the embodiment and the fulfillment of he it gave meaning to all of those. Uh he is the trespass offering. He is the sacrifice offering. He's the sin offering. He's the guilt offering to remove your guilt. Anybody here suffering with guilt remaining on their mind, he is your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Anybody here packing sin, here's the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Anyone doesn't doesn't have peace with God, here's the peace sacrifice. The full fulfillment of all of those sacrifices is found in Jesus Christ. But don't forget, it's not Jesus Christ of history merely. It's Jesus Christ who is the living word of God in every season. &gt;&gt; The sacrifice lies in the message. &gt;&gt; I'll prove that to you. &gt;&gt; Outside of that, you say, "Well, all kinds of voices in the world." Well, I'd be very, very hesitant to hang my eternal eternal destiny &gt;&gt; on some man's voice or some church's voice or something else. I'd make sure that first it was a voice that came from eternity and was supported by the supernatural, &gt;&gt; not some emotional supernatural or something that appears supernatural, but something that you know that man cannot know that man could not do that. That is God's knowledge. That is God's word. That is God's mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; And hang your soul on that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Someday we'll all find, if time would go on, we'll all find some common ground in a funeral parlor &gt;&gt; or on a slab someplace. The rich, the poor, &gt;&gt; the fat, the skinny, &gt;&gt; the healthy, the sick. Doesn't make any difference. Everybody will find their place on a common piece of ground. &gt;&gt; You want to know you're not dead. Then &gt;&gt; as the prophet said that death is just a doorway going to go from the interior to the exterior, the exterior to the interior, going to go from one realm to another realm. And as the songwriter said, what then? &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. &gt;&gt; We're not here for a Sunday school picnic. &gt;&gt; We're not here to just have fun and games. We're here because this is serious business. &gt;&gt; This is your soul. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So all of these offerings, most of these sacrifices were not optional. &gt;&gt; They were required. &gt;&gt; Salvation is not an option &gt;&gt; to those who are elected and called. It's a must. &gt;&gt; I must go. &gt;&gt; I must surrender myself. And furthermore, from what Jesus said, all that the Father hath given me will come. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that they will come? &gt;&gt; If you're called of God, you're not going to stay where you are. You're going to come. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, he said, "And no man will pluck them out of my hand." There's nobody that can connive and get you out of your hand. This isn't something you just become convinced about. It isn't something you learn. is something that's revealed to you and you can't take that revelation away. &gt;&gt; So it was not optional. And while we cannot relate to the multitude of sacrifices that God required in the Old Testament, because there's really nothing in our daily life that is even remotely similar to the life that God called the children of Israel to live. There's just nothing. You read through, you can read through Exodus. You can read through even in Genesis uh Noah built an altar and slew animals and Abraham offered sacrifices and all the Old Testament the patriarchs and then you come up to uh Exodus and Exodus and God calls them out of out of Egypt and I tell you what, you think there's bloodshed over in Egypt right now? There was a lot of bloodshed in in in Moses time &gt;&gt; and there has to be something that answers to that. &gt;&gt; There has to be something in your faith that answers to that and said, "Well, I know that in whom I have believed. &gt;&gt; I know that the supreme sacrifice answers to that." And then we go on from there. And yet these sacrifices were of utmost importance and the centerpiece of their worship to God. They have more to do, and here's the key phrase, they have more to do with obedience than with merely slaying an animal. when you if you were just honestly reading the scripture without any religious background, you'd say, and I've had I've had people I went to school with and and uh I they started reading the Bible because they got they said, "Woo, that's gruesome." Well, just for the common mind or the natural mind, it is gruesome. He said they were just killing all kinds of animals and thousands and hundreds of them, etc., etc. And we don't want to dwell on that. But we could ask the question, why would God of eternity, why would God who created all things make such a requirement? It was obedience &gt;&gt; to see the supreme test whether they would believe that he spoke that. &gt;&gt; And so when Israel went away from God and continued with their sacrifices, they became it the sacrifice himself itself became a stench in God's nostrils. &gt;&gt; See just merely a religious life, &gt;&gt; God can't stand it. God can't stand just religious empty religious activity. And that's why the prophet said God hates a powerless church. &gt;&gt; Power to transform. &gt;&gt; Not power to reform, but power to transform. &gt;&gt; Transform. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, my father, I won't get into his testimony, but my father, they made their own home brew. My father drank till he would unconscious. My father loved to dance. He loved the things of the world. He did the things of the world. But one day, just like something smoked him in the field while he was plowing behind the horses, and he dropped to his knees in the sod, a fresh feral, threw his arms in the air. Now I'm talking about an altar, an alter young man, an alder boy in the Catholic church. &gt;&gt; And he drops to his knees and says, "Oh God, if there is a God, if you ever show me how I can how I can be free from this guilt, I will receive you that very day." How come the guilt didn't go away in the church? &gt;&gt; How come the priest couldn't take away the guilt? How come all the incense and all the ceremony couldn't take away the guilt? because it isn't empowered to take away the guilt. This is not by ceremony. It's not merely even by having a church building or preaching. This has nothing to do with it. This just accommodate you so that you can come and have fellowship with God and to hear God's word. &gt;&gt; And in a house in a house just a kitchen in a home that a woman asked him to make some kitchen cabinets if he could. and he'd seen two girls on the street. They looked like angels to him. And he had said some days before, "If I could only have what they have." And they happened to be in that house. And this woman asked my father, "Would you like to be saved?" He said just before he was leaving, he said, "I don't know what that means." Said, "You can be free from your sin, free from your guilt." He said, "Oh, if I ever could know that I'd be free from my guilt." And the woman said, "Well, we're having little meetings over in a house here and you could come on Sunday." He said, "I was plowing in the field and something came over me and I dropped to the my knees and said, "If there was a God, if he ever showed me how I could be free from my guilt, I'd receive it that very day." And she slid out a chair and he knelt at a chair and stood up. a transformed person. &gt;&gt; There's been a change in me. And friend, the old time gospel is still the new time gospel. It's still the gospel that works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe in that kind of gospel. I believe in that kind of sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're no longer there are no sacrifices for sin outside of outside of the one that was made, Jesus Christ. And so the scripture says, and I want to read a few scriptures if you just listen attentively please. In Jeremiah, now the prophet Jeremiah is speaking. He said, "For I spake not under your fathers, nor commanded them in the in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings and sacrifice sacrifices. But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice. &gt;&gt; Have you got that? &gt;&gt; Obey my voice and I will be your God and you shall be my people. &gt;&gt; Said now he gave all kinds of commandments, but he says, I didn't command you just in in offerings and sacrifices. That's not it, &gt;&gt; but I spoke to you to obey my voice. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's a lot of voices. What voice is it? And I have a lot to say about that. And get right home to where you live. And then he went on to say, "But this thing I commanded them." Then in Jeremiah 6, that was Jeremiah 7. And Jeremiah 6 says, "Thus say the Lord, stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths. Where is the good way? And walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls." I say, the old way is still a good way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The way God ever talked to a a man is still the way. &gt;&gt; And and repentance is still repentance. &gt;&gt; Whether you find it in Genesis or you find it in the Bible or you find it in 2013, repentance is still the same. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for my sin. I'm sorry that I turned away. I'm sorry that I was even in this state and I I I ask for forgiveness &gt;&gt; and receive me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I give you myself. &gt;&gt; That's oldfashioned, &gt;&gt; but that's still what works. &gt;&gt; And people want to make, you know, want to shine it up and and make it easy and just join a church or join a certain group or or say, "I agree." And and start to be able to repeat the things that maybe message believers say. That doesn't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; Preach it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Also I set watchmen over you, saying, hearken to the sound of the trumpet." But they said, "We will not hearken." Therefore, hear ye nations, and know, oh congregation, what is among them here, O earth, behold, I will bring evil up upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. And to what purpose cometh there uh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet uh canain from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifice is sweet unto me. I just want your attention for a moment. These are people that have rejected God's word, turned away from God's word, but still kept on a ceremony of of of religion and sacrifices, and that's what we used to do. So, we just keep on doing it. And God said, "It's a stench. &gt;&gt; I don't want your sacrifices. I I want obedience." &gt;&gt; But when the trumpet sounds, you said and it said to hearken, I I won't listen. I won't hearken. I won't do it. Say, there was an announcer yesterday, last night. My wife was just listening to the news for a moment and uh two two announcers are talking in the newscast and they said, you know, it's uh we have the NHL coming and that's kind of the only bright spot we can talk about the NHL, National Hockey League, but that's the only bright spot we can really talk about. And the other one said, "Yeah, it's hard to talk about the NHL when the world is going to hell in a basket. &gt;&gt; The rest of the world is going to hell in a basket. &gt;&gt; Even people who have no consciousness perhaps of spiritual things realize that there's just a a turmoil throughout the earth. How can you have hundreds being slain and thousands upon thousands being wounded? This is only hours away by jet travel in so many countries and oppression and dictatorships and people trying to shake it. We live we live here in a uh perhaps cloistered as it were. But don't think friends that we're out of reach &gt;&gt; of a lot of squeeze &gt;&gt; and a lot of misery &gt;&gt; and a lot of people have suffered economic disaster &gt;&gt; and have almost become a there's a lot of people and we don't have to talk about economics but we can talk about the pain within the soul of homes tore apart &gt;&gt; and the and the consequence of sin. It's severe, friends. It's severe. &gt;&gt; Let's not fool ourselves. &gt;&gt; We're not going to whistle in the dark or whistle in the graveyard that it's not coming. It's coming to our door. &gt;&gt; And the scripture foretell it that the whole world will be embroiled. Here's what the scripture says. Things shall wax worse and worse. &gt;&gt; That's not good news. I'm not here to be a have a popular by popular demand. I'm here just to say what the Bible says. There's hardship on every hand even in this country of America or Canada or the Western world. And and it's it's it's sitting in a crisis sitting in a crisis position. And but the scripture says it will. And and we're not just looking for a better life. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in a better life. I'm interested in knowing that I have personally the sacrifice that is pleasing to God because it's the only thing that when I cross over that God's going to look on and allow me to enter into the regions of the blessed &gt;&gt; in Amos just to make this point a little clearer. Though you offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them. Neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. See, they were being refused. Now, just to take a turn quickly in the token message, the prophet said these words, the token, and this is where I want to come to now. The token is a sign that the purchase the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't get a token from the railroad fair until you pay the price. &gt;&gt; So, it has to be paid for. And the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it. There's no other way. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "Believe it and paying it." He's referring to believe it. There's no other way to get the token but to believe it. &gt;&gt; Accept it. &gt;&gt; And full obedience to the whole word of God will entitle you to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The token. The token was a sign that an animal in the Old Testament had been sacrificed. And the Passover lamb was a and and they took the blood and put it upon the doorpost and the lentil of the door. And he says, "When I see the blood, I'll pass over you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the blood that caused him to pass over. It was the fact that obedience put the blood there. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's obedience to every word of God. &gt;&gt; And full obedience. &gt;&gt; He said full obedience entitles you to the token. &gt;&gt; He said full obedience not part of it as far as your denomination goes. &gt;&gt; And we as believers, I'll say not as far as say another message, church. It's so it is so incomprehensible that we would compare ourselves with ourselves. Well, so and so does it. What's that got to do with it? It's what does this say? &gt;&gt; What does the message say? &gt;&gt; It's not, well, they do it. Well, th those kids do it or someone else does it or their parents allow it. That has nothing to do with it or someone else is getting away with it. Who says they're getting away with it? &gt;&gt; Who says anybody? We don't get away with anything with God. want to say, "Well, are are you preaching a God of of uh love?" Yes, I am. And I'm preaching of a God of justice &gt;&gt; because there's no justice. There's no love without justice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Talked about Abraham. I want you to sit real real Canaan. Listen real close because I want to take a I want to take a little left turn here in just a moment. Abraham, he said, fully obeyed God. And the blessing never came until he fully obeyed God. &gt;&gt; So, so it's not just, well, I'm trying and I'm doing my best and I'm so forth. That's not it. &gt;&gt; It's full obedience. It's being sold out. &gt;&gt; You can call it a fanatical if you want, but I I'm a fanatic for this gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me? I'm a fanatic for the gospel. I'm a fanatic for this message. &gt;&gt; Because I have seen this message produce in the lives of people and in my own life &gt;&gt; all these years. It just it holds you. When everything else shake, it holds you. When you're a young man, it holds you. &gt;&gt; When you're young, it helps you to have the right kind of desires, the right kind of ambition, the right kind of direction. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching you young people now. &gt;&gt; I was once young. &gt;&gt; When I was a young person, had some of my first automobiles and I bought my first car, I wouldn't let them put a radio in it &gt;&gt; when I was young. And that was the big thing. That was the day of zoot suitors here in Vancouver and long chains down the side and and drugs were coming in the vogue and were popular and if you weren't into the drug scene, you were kind of nobody and they were slickers, you know, the ducttail and all the rest of it. And if you weren't part of that scene, you're just kind of nobody. But I I swam a different stream. &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy. &gt;&gt; You were the oddball. There has to be odd balls. &gt;&gt; You're the nut. There has to be nuts. &gt;&gt; And I decided then I would be. &gt;&gt; I didn't know all about the sports. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I almost got punched out in Pentictton. I drove into Pentictton with my car. Didn't have a radio in my car. Got into Pentictton to gas up and all these signs. Welcome home the V's. Welcome home the V's. the Pentictton V's. I drove up and rolled the window down. I said, "Who's the Pentictton V's?" The guy almost punched my lights out. He says, "The V's. The V's. The Pentictton Ves. We won the World Hockey Championship or something." Oh, I've just been in some meetings and seen souls getting saved. I wasn't interested in a Pentictton Ves or the hockey champion. You might say, "Oh, that's years ago. That's years ago. That's what the NHL was. That's what the famous basketball players was." We're not interested in them. &gt;&gt; They're man, they're flesh. They'll live. They'll die. Unless they receive Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; there's only heaven and hell. And when you have a radio announcer say it's hard to get excited about the NHL when the rest of the world's going to hell in a basket. &gt;&gt; He meant what he was saying. &gt;&gt; I I don't have to advance his words, but this is what the Bible tells us. And we've received a messenger that has told us and vindicated. We've heard you people have received the last message. &gt;&gt; There won't be another one. There won't be another denomination. &gt;&gt; They'll all try to merge together. &gt;&gt; Now, of all of these sacrifices and all of these offerings, they found their full meaning. And I repeat what I said earlier in Jesus Christ the supreme sacrifice who was don't think of him now just as a person who lived 2,000 or some years ago because that will displace it in your mind. He was the word then. &gt;&gt; That's what he was. &gt;&gt; And very few obeyed the sound. &gt;&gt; Very few. Multitudes heard his voice, but very few heard the sound or obeyed the voice. &gt;&gt; And as it was, so is it. &gt;&gt; They want the bread and the fishes. Oh, we want the fellowship around the message and all of those things. We want more than fellowship &gt;&gt; and we want more than bread and fishes. We want more than just a, you know, the econ economic things to happen right into things that run smooth in the home. We want more than just peace blessings. We want to know that sacrifice &gt;&gt; has been made &gt;&gt; for my soul. You say, "Well, it was on Calvary." Yeah, but that one on Calvary hung there because he was the word and he's still the word and he's still Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. What he was, he is. And what he is, he will be. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I heard him last night. He said that's humans just always make that mistake. They rejoice in what God has done. They will talk about what he will do and fail to see what he is doing. Friends, the critical moment is this morning. &gt;&gt; The critical moment is now here &gt;&gt; at 10 12 &gt;&gt; 2013. &gt;&gt; I think it's the 17th or something today. This is the critical moment, not what's going to happen. You don't even know if you're going to be here tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Nobody has any guarantee of tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We are what we are today. Amen. &gt;&gt; And his his word his word has always been the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Elijah comes to place the heart right so that the life by the Holy Spirit comes into you &gt;&gt; and then that life begins to be lived out &gt;&gt; and that is the sacrifice and God looks on that sacrifice and said I'm pleased. Amen. &gt;&gt; He can only be pleased with what he was pleased with when he saw that life in obedience back then and he sees that life now living in you. &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, I I don't know. I hear about people giving their lives and oh, forget that. &gt;&gt; Hear them about going over and, you know, going over to some far away country and doing." I said, "Forget that. Most of you aren't going to go there anyway. But you can live now &gt;&gt; a life in obedience &gt;&gt; to the word of God. &gt;&gt; A life a life that God looked on back then and said, "I'm satisfied. I'm pleased &gt;&gt; because this life is an obedience to my word." &gt;&gt; Some of it we have control of. Some of it we have no control of. Some of the life of Jesus he had no control of. He was born of a virgin. He didn't choose that as a man. He didn't choose that. He was simply born of a virgin because a prophet said it. &gt;&gt; Now, I hope this swimming water, but I hope it doesn't get too strong. I'm trying to preach it in simplicity. The prophets spoke the body of Jesus Christ into existence. &gt;&gt; Matthew 1, Matthew first chapter said this is the way the birth of Jesus happened. &gt;&gt; It tells about now the birth of Christ was on this wise. In other words, listen to me now you that are visiting. The birth of Christ happened on this wise. This is how it happened. And then it goes into detail how it happened, how the birth of Christ happened. And then it starts out with this verse along towards the end of the chapter. Now all this was done. &gt;&gt; What was done? All the details of his birth. All this was done that it might be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That was spoken of by of the Lord by the prophets. So it was the Lord himself that told how the sacrifice would come and the first Adam disobeyed but this Adam will not disobey. &gt;&gt; And that's why I say he was spoken into existence because had the prophets not said it, it wouldn't have happened. It wasn't the prophet. It was the God of the prophets &gt;&gt; causing them to speak. &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham said if they and how well he would know it. He said they would in no wise have said those things if they knew what they were saying. &gt;&gt; They spoke things they didn't know what they were saying. We even do things we don't know why we do it. We make decisions and the decision they're decisions of sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we don't even know why we make those decisions. &gt;&gt; The scripture says this. I must move along quickly because I'm coming right to a point I want to make very very strong. Paul, first church age messenger, he said, "Now I beseech you, brethren," and I like to say that to you this morning. I beseech you, brethren and sisters, therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing in the Old Testament. The sacrifice, even the word means slaughter, &gt;&gt; kill it. &gt;&gt; But now, Apostle Paul knowing that the supreme sacrifice and the and the fulfillment, not merely the fulfillment, but the uh composite, the the the end result of all of those sacrifices have been met in one person. Not just a person that we become affectionately known as to Jesus Christ. More than that, but we want to say the word, &gt;&gt; the living word. In other words, a sacrifice. Hear me now. The sacrifice changed form. &gt;&gt; Hey, I know something about changing form &gt;&gt; at my age. Some of you folks, you all know what about changing form as well. &gt;&gt; But you're still the same person. That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe you liked olives as a kid and you still like olives or you hated something at some time, you know, as a child and you still do. I've been having a bit of a struggle because I I grew up loving butter and honey. Oh, I thought people who didn't eat honey were some weird people from Mars or something. Honey is meant for the honey is meant for the good of the people. And and we in the northern Canada had honey almost as as white as that paper. And I thought the honey all over the world was like that. And uh so I packed that honey to South Africa. And when brother Willie Ratif got his jar of honey, he took it quick and disappeared. And that honey never reappeared again. I think it he he just went and kind of secretly had it. You know, maybe himself. I don't know. If Brother Willie hears this, he'll understand what I say. He loved that honey. Somebody down from Tennessee was up and I I gave him some of that northern honey. H honey requires I shouldn't get on this subject but honey requires a lot of good water, fresh water that is handy and close because a bee has to have water and they after they get nectar and uh and then uh up north they have a lot of clover and wild fireweed which grows high and they got that fireweed and it gives the most wonderful honey. I'm a connoisseur of honey. You have to understand that. Don't send me any honey because now the doctor says I mustn't have any. That's why I said I have a massive problem. I I thought the first thing you do in the morning is reach and get that honey and mix it with your cereal. Anybody doesn't do that is wacko. Well, I guess I've gone wackle because I can't do it anymore. He said you mustn't do that. Yeah. you know, cut it back. And so anyway, we we've done that, but I just thought that that was, you know, but we changed form. Say, well, you're the same as you were years ago, Brother Ed. Well, that's fine. No, some things have changed. And my system starts to say, you can't do that, &gt;&gt; but I I want to do it. I'm the same person. &gt;&gt; I'm the same thing. Now, I'm going to take it a little bit deeper. I understand from the DNA that we all have which is a unit of hereditary that come down and uh now we're get going to get in some swimming water so just hang on to it and that they connect those cells and they call it a chain. And I wanted to know if those chains ever break or if they get damaged. And I found that they could. And it would uh it it would it would indicate a sickness or a disease and could get more serious even if damaged. But if that chain breaks, it could get And then then I found where the prophet of God was speaking to someone and he was talking to a specialist in Mayo Clinic. And the specialist in Mayo Clinic said, "Well, you got that by hereditary." No, he said, "I have another father." Notice how quick. said, "I have another father." He's talking about a DNA and he's denying what came by through natural breeding and his natural what he inherited from natural birth. &gt;&gt; Said, "You have that because it's a you it was an you inherited it." Says, "But I have another father." &gt;&gt; Says, "But you're going to have this." No, I'm not going to have that &gt;&gt; because I have another father. &gt;&gt; And he's not talking about some poetic license. He's not talking about some He's talking about a chain that is stronger than this DNA. And so I'm here to say to you, you have inherited things. You have come by things by way of your natural birth. But the new birth has broken that link. The new birth has broken that chain and you need not be subjected. Say, well, I was born that way. I was born with this temper. We've got all kinds today that even publications are they're born homosexuals. No, that might be in their DNA. I don't know. I'm not here to discuss that. But I happen to know another DNA. I happen to know another chain that is greater than that one. and not only will break that one, but will give the healing that that person needs. &gt;&gt; My father may have been born with the weakness of alcohol. I don't know. He loved to dance. He loved the world. He was born with perhaps those things that was part of his culture. But he got connected to another father. And he found out that there was by revelation there was another DNA and there was another birth. And it broke this chain. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know you believe it &gt;&gt; and I know you've experienced it. But this morning I came with a heavy message on my heart and that is that I expect all of us at some point in time, you know, we have our our struggles and perhaps have come to the point where we feel I've tried so long. I've attempted so long. I've given it my best so long and I I have just finally given up &gt;&gt; and I I just succumbed to this. I guess I was born that way. No, there's a life that's in you by the new birth. &gt;&gt; And it happens to be a life of sacrifice. And God wants you to speak with the Apostle Paul and say, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; And yet I live, but I don't live. It's a Christ. It's the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; I should say the life of the sacrifice &gt;&gt; that lives in you. &gt;&gt; And you need to offer that upon your heart. &gt;&gt; And you need to say in your heart, I will do that. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. I will do that. &gt;&gt; And we've heard, have you heard the shout? &gt;&gt; Oh, we rejoice over that. We've heard the shout, but maybe the shout in the message has said even more than we've been able to assimilate into our system &gt;&gt; and we know and we have a witness and we have a little tinkling. And uh I'm going to give a an example that you'll remember. Marilyn had a a dog whose name was Tyson. He's a big boxer. Oh, I loved that dog also. He was just really a fine dog. But, you know, he he loved to go out for a walk. And all we had to do was I just had to reach up and get his leash and just rattle that chain a little bit. I just rattle that chain. man, he'd leap up wherever he was snoozing or sleeping and come around the corner just scratching the floor with his claws. He He just wanted to go for a walk so bad. &gt;&gt; He just wanted that release. What did he want? He wanted to feel that chain. He wanted me to, you know, snap it on. And he just wanted to feel that tug because he knew he was going outside and going for a walk. And he he knew that was some freedom and some liberty. I tell you what, friends, in this message today, I had this witness in my heart that God wants to tingle, tingle your chain and let you know it's a chain of love. &gt;&gt; Change of love. The apo the prophet of God said that apostle the apostle Paul, he became a prisoner &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ and to the word of God. Do you hear me? Up on the balcony, he became a prisoner. He became a prisoner bound. He said I I I He said that that I may apprehend that for which I'm apprehended. That I might lay hold. He's saying that I might lay hold upon it. That I might grasp it with the same intensity it has grasped me. &gt;&gt; I I I hear the chain. I hear the chain of love jingling. And I hear a chain. I hear a word that I can be released from this thing. This thing that has held on to me. This thing that has held me back from what I know God's full inheritance is. Listen, it's the chain of God's DNA. &gt;&gt; God's DNA. &gt;&gt; His love for you, his love for his child. &gt;&gt; His love for you is a daughter of God, a son of God. And the chain is saying you can be free. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in I'm not interested in just going on week after week or year after year. I'm here to tell you that there's a message that goes beyond this church. There's a message that goes beyond your understanding. And the Holy Spirit is jangling your chain this morning. &gt;&gt; And what a person needs to say is what the prophet said. I will. &gt;&gt; I will. &gt;&gt; I believe it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then a person is able to say that's behind me. &gt;&gt; And what are you? You're living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You're able uh the the order of your sacrifice rises to God and he says, "I'm pleased." And people, your brother, your sister, your peers, they look upon you and say, "There's somebody." Don't tell me it can't happen. &gt;&gt; I see it. &gt;&gt; I go to school with it. &gt;&gt; I go to church with it. I see people are different. I see homes that are different. Don't tell me that we can't be victorious in this age. I see young people that are completely victorious in this age. I see I see those I see men and women who've said no to the world. No to the entertainments of the world. No to the ways of the world. We're not interested in their ways. We're not interested in their philosophy. It has got them nowhere. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; not as though I already attained either. We're already perfect. We're not there. Amen. &gt;&gt; We haven't attained. This speaks to all of us. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul is speaking on our behalf. &gt;&gt; Because we haven't attained doesn't mean we reach out. We don't reach out. &gt;&gt; Don't sit back. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking a word of warning. Don't sit back. &gt;&gt; Don't expect to be just what you were last week. What has the word said about your cause and your case? &gt;&gt; What has the word said about it? &gt;&gt; Word said you can be free. &gt;&gt; God has to make that real to you. &gt;&gt; But if he's making real to you, I said tune your ear &gt;&gt; to the jingle of that chain, &gt;&gt; the chain of God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let it go over your head now, please. I'm getting This is the message. This where I'm at. This what God wants me to say. Not as though I had already attained either were already perfect. But I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I'm apprehended of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Such a powerful, potent scripture. &gt;&gt; I'm not perfect. I'm not mature. I'm not what I want to be. I'm not there yet. But I follow after it. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sit back and accept &gt;&gt; just where I'm at. &gt;&gt; I'm going to move forward. &gt;&gt; Young men, young ladies, I'm going to move forward. &gt;&gt; I'm in my senior years. I want you to say, "I will do that. &gt;&gt; I don't know what the cost. I don't know what it's going to be, but I will do that. &gt;&gt; I will believe that word of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'll follow after it that I may apprehend it. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's not today. Maybe it's tomorrow. Maybe it's next week. I don't know. But I'm reaching out &gt;&gt; that I may apprehend it. &gt;&gt; Every once in a while I see on the newscast somebody being apprehended. somebody who was wellto-do, maybe some guy that was rich and he lived in a castle, he lived in this home, he had a home in Florida, maybe a home over in Paris and whatever more. And finally, finally FBI or CIA or other agents come in and they put handcuffs on him &gt;&gt; and the next thing you see, he's in an orange suit &gt;&gt; and he walks away &gt;&gt; and he's got four walls. and a little toilet in one side and a little cot in the other side. And he's come from such pomp and glory and luxury and esteem of the people. &gt;&gt; He reduced to nothing. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's apprehended &gt;&gt; for his deeds. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you now. The Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; came upon you &gt;&gt; for the purpose of apprehending you. And thus a messenger could say, "You're not your own. &gt;&gt; You have been bought with a price &gt;&gt; by the precious blood of Jesus Christ." And that was the only life that could satisfy the judgment of God. And that's why when you receive that life by the Holy Spirit into you, God says to you, "You're free. &gt;&gt; You're free." &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But before I close, &gt;&gt; I can't close &gt;&gt; because I know that you have sat I'm going to prophesy now. I know that you've sat in many meetings and you've heard many of these ministers and I know that God has jingle the chain in your ear. Amen. &gt;&gt; And down in your heart there was a still small voice. &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. We probably won't come in there again. There's a still small voice saying, "This is for you. You don't have to have that control you. This is for you." You might say, maybe you said, "Well, I I'm just Irish or I'm just German or I'm just Ukrainian or I'm just whatever. I'm Ukrainian." Say, "Well, they have a weakness for something and then you find something to have a weakness for one thing and a weakness for another thing." Deny that thing. &gt;&gt; That voice is not God's voice. &gt;&gt; The still small voice keeps saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; You can be free. &gt;&gt; You can be free. This sacrifice was complete. This is not a sacrifice plus. This sacrifice was complete. And if you just say, if you'll just obey &gt;&gt; the voice, &gt;&gt; I got something for you. The shout is the message. &gt;&gt; The voice is the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I have some deep questions. Maybe because of my age, but if a person doesn't hear the voice of the shout, I'm talking about the whole voice of the shout. We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for some that follow on. &gt;&gt; I still continue. &gt;&gt; I'm not there yet, but I am following after it. I'm passionate about this word. I'm passionate about God's work. I'm passionate about People say, "Well, it's the church." No, it's not the church. I'm passionate about what God the direction God gives. I believe in the leadership of the Holy Spirit. I'm passionate about it. &gt;&gt; I've been humbled, terribly humbled by some of the people that come from Africa. And that's why I say God bless you and don't ever lose it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They have they've been birthed with such a respect &gt;&gt; and they put a connection very quickly from God from the supernatural to God himself. They can bypass a messenger. When I say bypass, not they don't by they don't they don't ignore them. They bypass it to get to the source. &gt;&gt; I've had that. Daniel, I'll take your hand. You can stand as brother Daniel. I've had people like brother Daniel, not him, but people like him take my hand and say, I just want to look into the eyes that the prophet of God looked into &gt;&gt; and I want to see the face that he spoke. I've read I've read the words, but I want I want to look into the face that he looked into while he said those words. And I just got reduced down. I felt so small and shake the hand that he shook and I felt so humiliated and so small. Thank you, brother Daniel. That kind of respect people, it's not respect for me. That kind of respect for God &gt;&gt; gets answers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; When you young people are thinking about marriage, the most important thing, you better talk to someone who hears from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before you get married &gt;&gt; or before you even think of a partner, you need to talk to someone. You need to have that kind of honor and respect. Not for the man. &gt;&gt; We don't care about the man. We care about the office. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A few presidents ago, there was President Bush and then there was President Bush. There was President Clinton and various presidents, President Reagan and so on so forth. When those men were in power, they could sign a declaration of war. The day they were voted out, their signature is worth nothing. &gt;&gt; Why? All the authority went with the office. &gt;&gt; People can talk about William Brandham say, "Well, I think he did this and I think he did that." They're missing it. &gt;&gt; They're missing it completely. all the authorities with the office. &gt;&gt; And God never changed. &gt;&gt; Moses had a temper. He had never changed his office. He was still the same prophet, do the same miracles the next day. &gt;&gt; He's supposed to strike the rock twice, struck it, struck it once, and he struck it twice. It's still brought forth. &gt;&gt; You understand? It's the office. &gt;&gt; And God does what he wants with the office. Then some will rise up and say, "Well, he spoke a certain me. He spoke a certain prophecy. It didn't happen." I can tell you one. His name was Jonah. &gt;&gt; Have you read about him? &gt;&gt; He prophesied yet 40 days. &gt;&gt; Very specific prophecy. 40 days and God's going to destroy this city. &gt;&gt; And they repented such as no city has ever repented. And it didn't happen. Right. &gt;&gt; And God didn't come down and say, "Sorry, Jonah. &gt;&gt; Sorry the people don't understand you. Some don't think you're a prophet anymore. I don't make any difference." God does what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God honors his word. &gt;&gt; And even the king and all of them repented in sackcloth and ashes. Amen. But when you hear and I'm closing now I had a witness in my heart in this study and before I came this morning that there's probably quite a few that you've heard that I thought of these various chains the chains of truth There's something in you says that's true. That is true. Why don't you hang a hold get a hold of it? Why don't you this morning say that is true? But then there's another chain says well you know you've tried before. So what? You tried before? You failed so many times. So what? Mayo Clinic said this. You inherited that. God was not and the prophet of God was not being disrespectful. I have to read that for you. Mayo brother said to me, "You can't get well." He said, "I got a right to." &gt;&gt; Now follow this. He says, "I have a right to." &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, you inherited it from your father." I said, "But my heavenly father redeemed me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm I'm out of the pawn shop now. &gt;&gt; So just move over, Satan." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll just pull I'll just pull some symptoms all around you." Now he's talking what the enemy is saying to him. That's coming. Now he's in a conversation. Is this all right, friends? &gt;&gt; Because he he he says the same things to you and me. But the symptoms say, and he says, uh, and he said, I'll just pull some symptoms all around you. And I said, stand around. Listen to me testify. I'd like I'd like for you to hear me. He said, I'll make you sick. I said, I'll testify that much harder. I'll make that much more testimony. If you want to hear me, praise God. Stick around a little while and you'll hear me. He said, "I just kept praising God and made it so hot for him he had to flee." &gt;&gt; If it happened then back then it happened the same thing today. &gt;&gt; whereby are given unto us. You say, "Oh, yeah. Well, I know that." No, you're on the wrong channel. whereby are given unto us, to every single person of you that are attending, and you that are streaming. This is given to you exceeding &gt;&gt; and great and precious promises &gt;&gt; that by these &gt;&gt; you might be partakers &gt;&gt; of the divine nature. And I say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God has provided a thus saith the Lord, a revealed truth word. &gt;&gt; And by this we can become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. &gt;&gt; Perhaps, Brother Ryan, if you could come, if you would, please. You've listened close. You've listened attentively. And I do not want to close merely to close. I'm not having a service just to have an alter call. That's not my purpose. My purpose is that you will listen once again. And I want to encourage you to attune your ear to that voice, to that little rattle of the chain to show that the prophet said, listen now, he said that there's a when Christ was at Calvary, it was hooked into earth and all the way and hooked into to the throne of God. And that was an unbroken connection. That's that's the lineage I'm connected to. That's the lineage you as a believer are connected to. &gt;&gt; That's your unbroken DNA. &gt;&gt; It is the God's promise, God's sacrifice. Oh friends, I started reading about sacrifices and the countries and the religions and the people that have sacrifices and that there's pages and pages and pages. I wearied I couldn't read it all and they sacrificed for so many reasons and so many religions all over the earth. All manner of people and cultures and so on have sacrifices. I was in Nepal and and and and there's a little hole, a small doorway in a wall and I could see that there was blood stain over it. And so I said, "What what does this represent?" And they said, "Well, they take a goat and they kill this goat and they put blood over it like this over this little entrance and people pass through it and so on and so forth and and I thought my you know and they don't know perhaps they don't know about the cross and the blood of Jesus Christ." Friends, listen close as I am concluding. I'm and concluding with some things that uh my mind had a hard time getting around when God I don't know how he slew animals and clothed Adam and Eve. There's some details he doesn't give us. But brother Brandham describes Adam walking and the loose hide flapping on his manly body and the trickles of blood going down. Trickles of blood that can't cleanse them from sin and his disobedience has just taken place. And the prophet said they can they can cry now. He said tears going down their face being being sent out from the presence of God. They can cry now. And I I wept. &gt;&gt; I wept at the description of this scene. But God made the sacrifice. Then Abraham made them and Moses made them. Listen now. When Moses Ma Moses was given instruction and they would make an altar and they would prepare the wood, they God's children prepared the wood, prepared the altar, and God's people then slew the animal. And God's priests took the blood and sprinkled it or poured it around the mercy seat and various things. Then Elijah came, the spirit of Elijah, and the altar was broken down. No one said to him, Elijah, the altar's broken down. He was the one who recognized &gt;&gt; they had their religion. We had our religion. When I met the prophet of God, I was just troubled about the way the direction things were going. I didn't know the altar was broken down. &gt;&gt; I didn't know my heart needed to be spoken to, but he uttered some scriptures. The false anointed, the rain falls on the just and the unjust. And said, that is true. That is true. What's happened? My young heart as a minister of seven years said, "What's going on? We preach with all of our strength, all of our might, and it just keeps getting worse. You give a scripture, give another scripture. It took Elijah to arrange the heart, the emotions, and the loyalty &gt;&gt; and the gravity of God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Back in Pentecost, they never gave the same importance. Look where they've gone today. &gt;&gt; It's just a It's just a promotional thing. &gt;&gt; And I wondered about that. Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; You are. And I I I I needed my heart arranged. And then I began to realize that the and he says the life of Christ, the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that the life of Jesus Christ comes into you. &gt;&gt; That was the sacrifice friends. &gt;&gt; That is the only sacrifice. And that is why people can do many good works beyond us, beyond what we would do. And he says, "Nuns don't go into the they don't go into the church and take on a ring of the church to be bad people. Priests don't go into the church to be bad. They go in to be good. They go in to give their lives. They sacrifice themselves in various countries and live in poverty, utter poverty to give their lives not to be bad, to be good people. &gt;&gt; And they perhaps exceed us or exceed you or I manyfold in what we would call sacrifice. That's not the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That is an honorable thing. But the sacrifice is none other than the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yes. &gt;&gt; You understand that? The life of Jesus Christ, the life that moved him through the pool of Bethea, Betheda, and stepped over those that were afflicted and sick and walked to a man that maybe wasn't that, but he could only do what the God had showed him to do. And here's a man been laying here 38 years, and he said, "Rise up, take up your bed." &gt;&gt; He said, "I have no one." right? &gt;&gt; Rise up, take your bed, and walk. And he's healed. And brother Brandham said that would have been questioned in that day and would be questioned today. &gt;&gt; What do you mean? You're a man, a man of compassion, a man that represents Jesus Christ. You pass over the sick and afflicted and take one maybe that's not that sick. That was still a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And he might by bypass many good people and come to some some drunkard or prostitute. &gt;&gt; Yeah. true &gt;&gt; and bypass a good person. We don't know that. &gt;&gt; But now I want to I want to conclude with this. Thank you for bearing with me. But then when that sacrifice came, I think that this is just my own thoughts now. I think that God in the beginning when he said, "Let the earth bring forth and it brought forth the herb and it brought forth the grass and brought forth the flowers and brought forth the trees." I believe that in the mind of God, he saw one tree coming. There would be an altar one day &gt;&gt; for his son. It would be a cross and it would not be his children. It would not be good people that cut that tree down. It would be wicked people that built this altar. &gt;&gt; Wicked people built his altar. And God's people would take their sacrifice and cause it to bleed and do what they wish with the blood. But not this one. It was a Roman spear. &gt;&gt; A weapon of war that was wet with his blood. The blood of the new creation of God. I don't I I hope you people are able to go where I'm going. It was wicked, vile men who spat upon him. &gt;&gt; It was not good men. It was not someone killing their sacrifice. It was acceptable. God took the vilest and the most evil &gt;&gt; and the rejecting nation &gt;&gt; and allowed them to make his altar &gt;&gt; and allowed them to crucify and kill his sacrifice &gt;&gt; because the sacrifice spoke out &gt;&gt; lay not the sin of their charge. &gt;&gt; They under do not understand what they're doing. Forgive them, Father. &gt;&gt; They know not what they do. &gt;&gt; That's the life that wants to live in us. &gt;&gt; That's a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Not some smart knowit all or somebody who can, you know, hammer everybody with doctrine and whatever more. Somebody who lives a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm sorry to be as personal as I am. &gt;&gt; I just spent a week with Brother David McGary, Pastor McGary and his wife and we went with them to Alaska on on a boat. You know why that happened? Marilyn, believe she's here someplace when she lost her husband. I was her daddy. And when we'd back out of her driveway at night and leave her alone, I it just my heart was just tore into thought somehow someway. And then I hear that Pastor McGary and he and I had never been close. I'd never preached in this church. and he'd only been maybe in couple of meetings of mine. And he sent a ticket to bring my daughter down and give her about a week with them in their home. And I just had just such a warm feeling. That was so kind. years later, I meet him and I said, "Why did you do that?" It had such an effect on me. Why did you do that? He didn't really know. I'll tell you why. This man, little man up here, needed to see that depth of compassion to somebody it's not in his church, a daughter of a minister he's not that close to, but there just something on their heart, you know, we just want to do it. Come into our home and be with us. Is the strangest thing, but I have never forgot it. You know, you might think, well, how do I give my life? No, you're giving it. You're giving it right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're giving it right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was sacrifice. Brother Matthew and Sister Rhonda and all of you that were at the camp and those of you at the at the booth and not only that, those of you that are here and you young people at home, it it's the life of Christ. And if the life of Beethoven and with this I close was in me or the life of Beethoven was in you, you'd write music. &gt;&gt; And if the life of Leonardo da Vinci was in you, you'd paint masterpieces. You'd have to because that's the life. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And when the life of Jesus Christ is in you, &gt;&gt; believe me, I see many things in my own life. I say, well, and I've asked myself in that last week, I've asked myself, would Jesus do that or would Jesus be here? And sometimes I think, no, probably not. And I feel bad about that. But you don't give up. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You don't give up. &gt;&gt; Because you see what there is. I was in Vancouver. Happened to be in Vancouver on on yesterday. Yesterday I worked down there, friends. In 40 years, in less than 40 years, it's turned into hell. &gt;&gt; Hell is on the streets. is just so vile. &gt;&gt; The whole atmosphere is so vile. You think it's going to get better? &gt;&gt; No, it's not going to get better. &gt;&gt; What am I saying? We are still here. We're here for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And that you people and the believers of this message is the evidence of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a privilege we've been called to live out the sacrifice &gt;&gt; of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. Let's just bow our heads. Father, I want to thank you. I ask you to hear me as I express myself. I'm thankful for this opportunity to unbburden my heart and speak things that you've been speaking to me. and perhaps things that I do not fully understand, but you understand to a congregation that have been so attentive and so respectful and I've held them, oh God, till I feel this burden lifting. But I know from the witness that you put in my heart and I know there's many visitors here. I've been told this morning many are visiting and perhaps perhaps they're not just visiting. Perhaps it's been your appointment that they should hear what has been spoken because perhaps, oh God, you have been seeking to have them hear your voice and and those of this congregation who come here, Lord, and we know very well. But there are those, no doubt, that you're speaking to right now. And if they will just listen, there's a still small voice saying, "This is for you. This is this is a moment for you. I'm talking to you. I'm speaking to you. And they hear that little they hear that little sound of the chain of God's love wanting to take them out from the situation they're in. Oh God, I'm going to ask just while I'm praying, are there some that want to stand and want to be identified in this prayer? I'll give you a moment. Father, I do not know what it is you are speaking. I do not know the heart conversation that's going on from the heart of God to the heart to your people. But you are looking upon the heart. You even said in your word, you spoke to Samuel and you said that you look upon the heart. Man looks on the outward, but you look upon the heart. God, you're looking upon the heart of your people, both seated and standing. And those that are standing are giving evidence to something that they are giving evidence. And I've heard the voice. I've heard this still small voice. And now I want to I want to take another step. I want to make a declaration that I I am moving forward. I perhaps I have not attained and I have not apprehended it but I I will move forward and I press on. I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus. Father come by the Holy Spirit I pray in the quietness of this moment oh God in the solemnity of this moment and Father let them each one in their own way make their own declaration as your prophet messenger said as he made the the declaration. I believe it and I accept it in the name of Jesus Christ and for the glory for his glory and his glory alone I commit them to you now. Amen. Let everyone stand please. Let the uh voice of the shackled in the of time. Yeah. What was the name of that? Worthy. I'd like to have you sing worthy. Worthy before we offer prayer and closing. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Lift it up now. &gt;&gt; There's no See the tears falls the broken, the cries of the slaves. Is there no one worthy to set us free? Listen now. Then the crying is still as the chorus rings out. The shackle released from their chain. And thousands of voices are swelling the song be worthy. The lamb that was worthy. [Music] He's worthy. So worthy. Worthy. The lamb that was slain. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; Want to sing that first verse once again. You on the shackle. Thank you for your soul. &gt;&gt; Be thankful for him. [Music] There's no [Music] tears broken and the cries all the way. Is there no one worthy set free? But then the cry as the chorus like your voice is lifted out from the tree. Hallelujah. [Music] the song. [Music] Worthy. So worthy. Worthy. Worthy. That was sweet. He's worthy. So worthy, worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. And all the archangels [Music] all time their [Music] fall before joining the Oh [Music] my [Music] Worthy, worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing that chorus, that verse. I love him. Love him. I love him. Love him. That was slain. I love him. I love him. I love the lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; We'll just bow in prayer. Oh God, almighty one, how worthy you are. There's none like you. You took our place and you've come, Lord, this morning. This morning you are speaking. We that have heard the shout, there are some that are sleeping to hear the voice. And we are in tune to the trumpet. &gt;&gt; We are in tune to these sounds. We're acquainted with this voice. Thank you, Father. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you will take this congregation. Bind your arms around them. Unstop any ears that may be closed and may they hear. We want to hear you, Lord. We are just saying, "Speak, Lord, and we will hear. Speak, Lord, and I will answer. Speak, Lord. We're ready to hear your voice." I ask you, oh God, as you embrace this congregation of people and that your voice may be heard long after they've left this building. Let the voice sound within them. Oh God, almost an imperceptible response, Father. Let it be a willing response and ready response. Yes, Lord. Speak on. Speak on. Oh God, how glorious is your voice. How wonderful it is to hear it. Thank you for ever calling us, Lord. I pray that you'll dismiss us from this place, but not from your presence. Bless every person, every visitor in our midst, all that are streaming wherever they might be in the world. Bless, I pray, oh God, those that are away. There are a good number of our people still on vacation. I pray that you will present yourself in their room and perhaps they're even streaming at this time. Oh God, oh God, we want to be with you so much. There such a desire in our heart to be with you, to cross over. We yearn for that rapture moment. We yearn for the change of these bodies, oh God, the promise of God. We pray that you will bless the people as we anchor our faith in the spoken word of God. And that spoken word will give us faith, more faith. Dismiss us now with your glory and your fullness, the fullness of joy and satisfaction. I pray and I'm asking, Father, that you will cause this word to linger on in the ears and the hearts of the people. I thank you for their kind attention in Jesus Christ's name's blessing upon them we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Why don't you turn around, shake hands with some that are near. Sister Clemens, it's nice to see you. I heard you've been very sick. Amen. He said you're sick and you said I'm healed. Amen. God bless you, sister. You're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. Bless you. Bless you, brother John. Bless you. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Data. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Okay. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Good day. [Music] Hallelujah.
