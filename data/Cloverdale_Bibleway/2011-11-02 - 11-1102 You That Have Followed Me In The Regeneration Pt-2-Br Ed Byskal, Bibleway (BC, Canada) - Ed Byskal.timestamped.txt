[6:08] Bless you all. Happy to be here once
[6:10] again this evening. Amen. Want to greet
[6:13] you all in the name of our Lord Jesus
[6:14] Christ.
[6:16] And we're just going to stand and sing
[6:18] Arise My Soul Arise. We haven't sung at
[6:20] him in quite a while. These are
[6:22] wonderful words. Amen. Let's just give
[6:24] extra thoughts to everything we sing
[6:25] tonight and just welcome him into our
[6:26] midst in preparation for the word. We're
[6:28] going to hear from our pastor. I'm
[6:30] certainly looking forward to what God
[6:31] has for us. Amen. Let's sing. Arise my
[6:34] soul, arise.
[6:37] Arise, my soul, arise.
[6:41] Shake off thy guilty fears.
[6:45] The bleeding sacrifice
[6:49] in my behalf appears.
[6:54] Before the throne, my shorty stand.
[6:58] Before the throne, my shorty stands. My
[7:03] name is written on his hands
[7:10] and he ever lives above.
[7:15] for me to intercede.
[7:19] His all redeeming love.
[7:23] His precious blood to clean.
[7:27] His blood atone for all our race. His
[7:32] blood atone for all our race and
[7:36] sprinkles now the throne of grace. Five
[7:42] bleeding wounds and five bleeding wounds
[7:46] he bears
[7:49] received on Calary.
[7:53] They pour in effectful prayers and they
[7:57] strongly plead for me.
[8:01] Forgive him all. Forgive their cry.
[8:05] Forgive him all. Forgive their cry. For
[8:10] let that ransom s
[8:14] die.
[8:16] [Music]
[8:18] The father hears him pray.
[8:22] his dear anointed one.
[8:26] He cannot turn away
[8:30] the presence of his son.
[8:34] His spirit answers to the light. His
[8:39] spirit answers to the light and tells me
[8:44] I am born of God.
[8:51] Oh my God is reconciled.
[8:55] His pardoning voice I hear.
[8:59] He holds me as his child.
[9:04] I can no longer fear. As with confidence
[9:10] I now draw. With confidence I now draw.
[9:16] and father ever.
[9:20] Let's sing the last verse once again. My
[9:22] God is reconciled.
[9:24] My God is reconciled.
[9:28] And in parting voice I hear.
[9:33] He owes me for his child and I can no
[9:38] longer fear.
[9:41] With confidence I now run out. With
[9:46] confidence I now run up and father ever
[9:54] cry with confidence.
[9:57] Oh as with confidence I now draw n with
[10:03] confidence I now draw out. Father,
[10:10] sing that one more time. With
[10:12] confidence, oh, with confidence
[10:16] I now
[10:19] with confidence I now
[10:23] father and father
[10:27] cry.

[14:17] &gt;&gt; We're just going to open the service in
[14:18] a word of prayer. Brother Luis, would
[14:20] you come open the service for us? I do
[14:22] have one prayer request from our sister
[14:23] Kalista. Please pray for my mom Melina.
[14:26] As a little girl, she had asthma and it
[14:28] has reoccurred. Just want to pray that
[14:30] God would step in and do work on her
[14:32] behalf. Also, a testimony from my
[14:34] brother Norm. A week and a half ago on
[14:36] Sunday, I had a strange sick feeling. It
[14:37] continued on and off through the
[14:39] following Monday. And Monday night while
[14:41] he was working at the school, it got
[14:42] worse. He decided it was best to go home
[14:44] and have the brothers pray for him. He
[14:46] says, "I started feeling better at home
[14:47] and was back at the school working
[14:48] Tuesday night. I thank God for his grace
[14:50] and healing." Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[14:51] brother Norm. Amen. If there's something
[14:53] on your heart you just like to hold
[14:54] before the Lord as brother Louise comes.
[14:56] Amen. He still answers prayer. God bless
[14:59] you, brother Louis.
[15:06] God bless you. Let's bow our heads and
[15:08] our hearts to the Lord.

[18:19] the presence of the Lord as we invite
[18:20] our pastor to come. God's just been
[18:23] speaking to my heart out of the Psalms.

[23:16] evening. And those that can't come, I'm

[23:32] ground.

[23:47] in, it's like you're getting
[23:48] turbocharged.
[23:50] the afterburners.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to have some spiritual
[23:55] afterburners one of these days and go
[23:58] straight up. Nice to see you, brother
[24:01] Arie. Know you weren't feeling too well
[24:03] for a few days and feeling better now.
[24:06] Good. Good.
[24:09] All right, let's just sing now. We're
[24:10] standing on holy ground.
[24:16] We are standing
[24:19] [Music]
[24:22] on holy
[24:24] ground
[24:29] and I know that there are angels
[24:37] around
[24:38] you.
[24:40] Oh God
[24:42] of
[24:45] [Music]
[24:48] Jesus.
[24:54] We are
[24:57] in his presence
[25:00] of holy
[25:02] ground. God with all your heart with all
[25:06] your heart.
[25:09] [Music]
[25:12] You are my
[25:18] [Music]
[25:24] angels.
[25:30] [Music]
[25:38] Jesus
[25:40] Christ.
[25:44] We are standing.
[25:49] [Music]
[25:57] Amen. I'll have you take your Bibles and
[26:00] turn to John's Gospel.
[26:03] the seventh chapter.
[26:17] For those of you that were here uh last
[26:20] Wednesday and Sunday
[26:23] uh some of the things I'm going to
[26:26] going to rehearse going to cover over
[26:28] some of the things because there was I
[26:31] just realized you know and sometimes I
[26:34] apologize but I realize there was just a
[26:36] lot of material and u uh we want to make
[26:41] sure that everyone has opportunity to
[26:44] absorb
[26:46] uh I I feel for myself. I just want to
[26:48] be very honest with you. I It's like a
[26:50] turning point for me.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; It was like a key that opened up. I I
[26:57] never had experience quite like that.
[26:59] And it just opened up from Genesis to
[27:02] Revelation. Just it began to affect
[27:04] everything. And we know that the
[27:06] prophet's message is sent here to reveal
[27:09] Christ. And when something really uh is
[27:13] inspired, it should open this up. Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; It should tie it together,
[27:18] &gt;&gt; things you've wondered about and things
[27:20] that were maybe loose ends should just
[27:23] all start coming together. And so I was
[27:26] having an experience like that and I
[27:29] just want to be able to share it more
[27:30] with you
[27:32] uh in John's gospel the
[27:36] 7th chapter. I'm just going to read two
[27:38] verses.
[27:41] In the last day, this is verse 37:38.
[27:45] In the last day, that great day of the
[27:47] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[27:52] If any man thirst, let him come unto me
[27:55] and drink.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me, as the
[27:59] scripture hath said, out of his belly
[28:02] shall flow rivers of living water.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; I'd like to have been there that day and
[28:07] heard him.
[28:09] I'd like to have heard Jesus lift up his
[28:12] voice on the last day, the great day of
[28:15] the feast. It was a special time. It was
[28:17] also a special feast. And that's when he
[28:20] was crying out. Just while you're still
[28:23] standing, we'll just bow reverently for
[28:26] a moment together. Father,
[28:30] we're standing here together in this
[28:32] sanctuary.
[28:34] And as we have sung a course, we believe
[28:37] the words. There are angels all around.
[28:40] And your prophet has said who he was so
[28:43] connected with the invisible. And he
[28:46] said that they are here. They're here to
[28:48] influence. You can feel their influence.
[28:52] May we, oh God, and all who may be
[28:54] connected and listening by the streaming
[28:57] wherever they might be. May we all feel
[29:00] the influence of the heavenly beings.
[29:04] May we be under the direct influence of
[29:06] the Holy Spirit from within, oh God, and
[29:09] around us, Lord. And if the enemy has
[29:12] come in like a flood, then raise up a
[29:14] standard against him, oh God. I pray
[29:17] that you'll cleanse the minds of all the
[29:19] busy thoughts of the day, for they are
[29:22] not as important as your thought. We
[29:24] just pray your blessing, oh God, not
[29:26] only blessing but inspiration upon the
[29:29] speaker and the hearers alike in the
[29:32] name of Jesus Christ and for his glory
[29:35] alone we ask it. Amen.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your
[29:40] seats.
[29:47] The scripture which we just read said
[29:51] that Jesus stood and cried saying.
[29:58] There's been a lot of uh great things
[30:00] that have been spoken
[30:03] and there have been what the world has
[30:05] said or considered at least they've
[30:09] considered great men have spoken
[30:13] and things which they have spoken have
[30:15] been recorded
[30:17] remembered
[30:19] for even centuries.
[30:21] people who have been considered
[30:23] philosophers,
[30:25] wise men. And whenever we think of that,
[30:29] just remember that the wisdom of this
[30:31] world is foolishness to God.
[30:36] And you can take something that is so
[30:39] simple that God has spoken. It may be
[30:44] ultra simple and yet it keeps it keeps
[30:48] expanding and it keeps getting deeper in
[30:51] its its depth and you'll find out that
[30:53] it begins to connect with other things
[30:56] and it it has a profound effect upon
[30:59] your life and uh those of us who perhaps
[31:03] have remembered
[31:05] uh remembered something that's been said
[31:07] to us. I remember when brother Benny
[31:10] Perry was here uh ministering some years
[31:13] ago and uh and and his mother was taken
[31:19] and uh from them and uh he said and and
[31:24] left the children. There was a four of
[31:26] them I believe and she talked to the
[31:30] those boys and talked to him and his
[31:34] brother and she said don't you ever take
[31:38] drugs
[31:40] and she had to talk with man don't you
[31:42] ever take anything that doesn't belong
[31:44] to you. Now that's not very profound but
[31:47] that kept two sons out of a whole heap
[31:50] of trouble because that was what they
[31:52] remembered that mama had said. don't you
[31:55] ever take anything that doesn't belong
[31:57] to you and don't you ever take drugs and
[32:00] they stayed away from it
[32:02] &gt;&gt; and God bless them for it.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; So I think that that is wonderful.
[32:09] Uh now we want to speak about I want to
[32:14] turn your thoughts to the things that
[32:16] Jesus said. And on uh on Sunday we we
[32:21] took the scripture.
[32:24] Um
[32:26] and Jesus said unto them, "Verily I say
[32:29] unto you that you which have followed me
[32:33] in the regeneration,
[32:35] when the Son of Man shall sit on the
[32:37] throne of his glory, you also shall sit
[32:40] upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[32:44] Israel." What a statement.
[32:46] What a thing to be spoken. Now,
[32:50] for those of us uh the day that we're
[32:53] living in today,
[32:56] uh God has again spoken.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; You realize that we've had hundreds and
[33:04] hundreds and hundreds of years and even
[33:06] into a couple thousand years since Jesus
[33:09] was here. And then he prophesied.
[33:14] He said it very briefly. When you see
[33:16] the days of Noah again and when you see
[33:18] the days of Sodom again, even thus shall
[33:21] it be when the Son of Man who he had
[33:24] made himself known as the Son of Man is
[33:27] revealed. He didn't say how he would do
[33:29] it. He didn't say right then, I'm going
[33:31] to send the Spirit of Elijah. He didn't
[33:34] say then who he was or anything. And and
[33:36] the scriptures never identified. They
[33:38] said to John the Baptist, who are you?
[33:40] He said, "I'm the voice of one crying in
[33:42] the wilderness as the scripture said."
[33:44] Well, the scripture could have been more
[33:45] specific, but God chose not to be
[33:48] specific. John could have been more
[33:50] specific, but the Holy Spirit led him
[33:52] not to be so specific because we don't
[33:55] need to catch it by learning. We need to
[33:58] catch it by a a divine revelation. We
[34:02] have to know that a thought is being
[34:04] injected into not our mind to turn over
[34:08] turn over and and to uh but but our into
[34:11] our inner being into our soul. And so we
[34:15] are living in a day when God has spoken
[34:18] his own word through his own messenger,
[34:22] his own elected one. And these are days
[34:26] which we can identify as the spoken
[34:28] word.
[34:31] So now I have a question perhaps two
[34:34] questions but the question is
[34:37] is the word of God only uh is the word
[34:41] of God only expression of God's
[34:43] knowledge of a situation and certain
[34:46] conditions or is the word of God
[34:49] something that is pregnantated with with
[34:54] creative
[34:56] powers
[34:57] &gt;&gt; that's very very important for usmen So
[35:00] is the word of God only an expression of
[35:03] God's knowledge?
[35:05] Is God just expanding our knowledge?
[35:08] Getting a greater understanding?
[35:11] You know, I have uh I have several
[35:13] volumes, four of them, four volumes
[35:17] of the what is called the Bible
[35:19] encyclopedia.
[35:21] And it's really fine print. You need to
[35:23] have good eyes. And they are literally
[35:26] about uh 2 and 1/2 3 in thick each. They
[35:31] cover about that much of my bookshelf
[35:35] and all fine print and there'd be
[35:37] thousands of pages. And if you had it in
[35:40] normal print, it would be many hundreds
[35:42] of more pages. And when I read it, I
[35:45] just marvel that there are men that can
[35:48] be so analytical and put everything
[35:51] together and they they go on and on and
[35:54] on on certain subjects and other
[35:57] subjects which really the message
[35:59] considers them very important. They'll
[36:00] just have a small paragraph, but then
[36:02] they'll get on to other things like they
[36:05] go for pages on the Trinity. And of
[36:07] course, the Trinity needs pages because
[36:11] they're trying to explain it.
[36:14] They really need a lot of space.
[36:17] But then other subjects which I have
[36:19] found extremely important in the
[36:21] message. It'll just be a paragraph. But
[36:23] they did pretty good on the
[36:24] regeneration. But then they go on and
[36:26] what what it was in the Old Testament or
[36:28] what it was in the New Testament and how
[36:30] the apostles look at it. and they focus
[36:33] everything down just to u uh just to I
[36:37] won't say just to but to salvation and
[36:40] that is the regeneration that is when a
[36:42] person has a new life etc etc and of
[36:45] course uh I marvel that they you know
[36:48] they can tie all the scriptures together
[36:50] and all of these things but what I
[36:52] really marvel at brother Brandham can
[36:55] take a few paragraphs
[36:57] and just I tell you what blow all of
[36:59] that to pieces
[37:01] &gt;&gt; you know I I don't say that dis
[37:03] disrespectfully. I say blow it to pieces
[37:05] cuz they haven't even caught that.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; They have they don't even think of that.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; And then I was reading back and Brother
[37:12] Vam starts talking about the cell of the
[37:14] body and I will I'll be going into it. I
[37:16] have a quote. I want you to read it with
[37:18] me and and he'll go into the cell of the
[37:21] body and how we're structured and put
[37:22] together and all of those things and
[37:24] then project that into into the
[37:27] supernatural and into the spiritual. And
[37:29] if we came out of if we came out of our
[37:31] earthly father, then we came out of our
[37:33] heavenly father and and the thing just
[37:35] becomes so one wonderful and it's it's
[37:38] just a it just is a so mindblowing
[37:42] really. I mean I run out of mental
[37:44] space. I run out of mental space all the
[37:46] time and I guess you probably know that.
[37:49] But anyway,
[37:51] my question is, is God when he speaks
[37:54] his word, is he only giving them or
[37:57] giving the people or giving us a greater
[38:00] knowledge of situation of conditions of
[38:04] the world or or is there something
[38:08] further? And I and and I'm going to say
[38:10] that I firmly believe and I'm absolutely
[38:12] convinced that God's words are
[38:15] pregnantated with a creative power.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; God can take control of a situation and
[38:22] heal a person.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; But that same word can take control of a
[38:26] person and create something.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; And it has to be creative power. Now I'm
[38:34] just jumping way ahead so I can come
[38:36] back.
[38:38] If you read uh we know that the breach
[38:40] and revelation the fifth chapter and the
[38:44] the book that was sealed and no one was
[38:46] worthy to take the book or to even look
[38:48] upon it. We we know those those truths
[38:52] very well. I just want to point out one
[38:55] thing to you. In the fifth chapter, we
[38:58] have the angels singing and the elders
[39:01] and the living creatures crying out and
[39:04] saying, "Thou art worthy to take the
[39:06] book. Thou art worthy and because thou
[39:09] was slain. And and you have the angels
[39:12] singing and the people making these
[39:15] acclamations to Christ to the lamb, but
[39:18] you don't have there's no record that
[39:20] the lamb said anything.
[39:23] He was silent all through chapter 5.
[39:26] When you get to chapter 10 and the and
[39:29] the mighty angel which is Christ himself
[39:32] has descended
[39:33] and and the Bible says that he had in
[39:37] his hand now a little book that was open
[39:40] and now because the book was open and he
[39:44] cried
[39:45] &gt;&gt; with a great voice and seven thunders
[39:48] uttered their voices and so now we are
[39:51] having uh it it doesn't take a very
[39:54] intelligent person to determine that the
[39:58] opening of the book uh created and
[40:02] caused a voice,
[40:04] &gt;&gt; a great voice.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And I could take you, the Bible says on
[40:09] the last day of the feast, that was the
[40:11] feast of tabernacles.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; These are our tabernacles. At the feast
[40:18] of tabernacles, where there was a
[40:19] celebration, something is supposed to
[40:22] happen with your tabernacle. Let me tell
[40:24] you while you sit here. Some of you
[40:26] young, strong, handsome, beautiful, all
[40:28] the rest of it, but your tabernacle's
[40:30] changing.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; And it won't be the same next year that
[40:34] it is today or maybe even tomorrow the
[40:36] way it is today. Your tabernacle's
[40:38] changing. And you can do everything you
[40:41] want to keep it young, to keep the
[40:43] wrinkles away, to keep yourself strong
[40:46] and keep yourself nevertheless, you can
[40:48] run. You can do all of these things. But
[40:50] your tabernacles changing
[40:53] &gt;&gt; and we want it to change in the right
[40:55] direction.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; We are interested in a feast of
[40:59] tabernacles. I want a feast with you
[41:03] &gt;&gt; as being a younger person or a stronger
[41:05] person or an older person. I want a
[41:08] feast with you in being what God
[41:10] intended for you to be
[41:13] &gt;&gt; and the body he intended you to have
[41:17] &gt;&gt; the feast of the tabernacles. And no no
[41:19] wonder at that feast that Jesus cried
[41:22] with a loud voice if any man thirst let
[41:27] him come unto me.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; What was that? It was an invitation.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what Peter was saying. Now if
[41:33] you can just put the two together. Peter
[41:35] was saying, "We've left everything.
[41:37] We've left houses and lands and
[41:39] relatives and everything. We've left
[41:41] home. We've left father. We've left our
[41:43] our occupation. We've left everything.
[41:46] What shall we have?" Jesus said, "You
[41:48] that have been with me, you that have
[41:51] followed me in their season, they
[41:53] followed him." And that was in the
[41:55] regeneration. He was the beginning of
[41:58] the creation of God. And you've been
[42:00] with me in this time. Well, it's that
[42:03] was not allotted to us, but it's been
[42:06] allotted to us to be in this time
[42:08] &gt;&gt; when he has experienced the second
[42:11] crucifixion
[42:12] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ. When this word that you
[42:16] love and dearly love, people despise and
[42:19] say all manner of things. Doesn't bother
[42:22] me at all. Doesn't bother us,
[42:25] &gt;&gt; but it happens.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; And he was rejected
[42:29] &gt;&gt; because it's the same Christ. We're not
[42:31] talking about brother Brandham even
[42:33] though he had to suffer because he was
[42:35] the vessel.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; He said it's not me they hate us the
[42:38] message.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; But it has been given to us to be with
[42:45] him in this time.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; It's been given to us to be with him in
[42:51] the rapture season. What a wonderful
[42:54] honor. What a privilege it is.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and that and we were we were
[43:00] with him and what shall we have? We just
[43:03] hear his words.
[43:06] You'll not all sleep,
[43:08] &gt;&gt; but you will all be changed
[43:11] &gt;&gt; in a moment in the twinkling. You that
[43:13] have been with me in this season
[43:16] &gt;&gt; because that is this season.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've been with me in this
[43:21] season and this is what you'll have as a
[43:23] reward.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Take the whole world. Give
[43:27] me Jesus and that promise.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; We've been called of God to be partakers
[43:37] of the fulfillment of the scripture of
[43:39] this day. Father, as as Jesus prayed and
[43:43] we quoted it last Sunday, I will that
[43:46] they also whom thou hast given me. He
[43:50] didn't allot adjust to those that were
[43:52] there with him, but those that thou hast
[43:54] given me, that they be with me where I
[43:58] am, and they may behold my glory which
[44:01] thou hast given me.
[44:04] Perhaps I will just uh we will go over
[44:08] some of the
[44:12] slides because I have also some uh added
[44:16] one.
[44:17] And Jesus said unto them, you can read
[44:19] it with me. Uh Jesus said unto them,
[44:22] verily I say unto you, that you which
[44:25] have followed me in the regeneration,
[44:29] when the Son of Man shall sit in the
[44:31] throne of his glory, you also shall sit
[44:34] upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[44:37] Israel.
[44:40] and for regeneration. I want to take a
[44:42] little more time with this because
[44:46] uh it deserves more time
[44:50] to form again
[44:53] to bring something back to its original
[44:56] state.
[44:58] Anything that's just been before it
[44:59] hasn't been original
[45:02] to its original state.
[45:05] And the restoration of a thing
[45:07] regeneration is the restoration of a
[45:10] thing to its pristine state. Hence its
[45:15] renovation.
[45:18] It's the new birth.
[45:21] It's the restoration to the original and
[45:24] perfect condition of things which
[45:26] existed before the fall of our parents.
[45:29] And brother Brennham stated so much and
[45:32] it's in the seals and the breach
[45:34] especially. He said all that Adam lost
[45:38] Jesus Christ restored. He gave back all
[45:42] that Adam lost.
[45:46] Regeneration is from the word Genesis.
[45:50] It is uh the generation.
[45:54] Regeneration is a generation or the
[45:57] source or the origin, a book of one's
[46:00] lineage in which his ancestry or progeny
[46:04] are enumerated.
[46:06] And I brought out I've thought about it
[46:09] many many times and marveled at it and
[46:12] have spoken on it how the book of
[46:15] Matthew, it's so striking. The book of
[46:17] Matthew starts out the book the the
[46:21] generation of Jesus Christ and it does
[46:24] not does it does not make it plural. If
[46:27] you want to I'll just read it for you.
[46:32] The book of the generation of Jesus
[46:35] Christ the son of David the son of
[46:39] Abraham. Now just watch for a moment.
[46:42] You don't mind we take a little time.
[46:52] You don't you can just note it down if
[46:54] you want. But in Genesis 5, it begins to
[46:58] right starting with verse one. This is
[47:01] the book of the generations of Adam. Now
[47:04] that was the first Adam. This is the
[47:06] second Adam. The first Adam had
[47:09] generations. The second Adam has only
[47:12] one generation. Amen.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Everyone is a firstborn
[47:17] son or daughter of God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; And it goes on to say
[47:24] uh how long the days of Adam where. And
[47:27] it talks about the generations. You'll
[47:29] find it many places in the Bible, but
[47:31] this is just the book of the generation.
[47:37] There you have it. Matthew 1:1, the book
[47:39] of the generation of Jesus Christ, the
[47:41] son of David, the son of Abraham.
[47:44] In the Leodysian church age, we have
[47:46] this paragraph.
[47:48] He's the beginning of the creation of
[47:50] God. And how could God be created? That
[47:53] he's a spirit. How could he be? He is
[47:56] eternal. He never was created. He never
[47:59] will be created because he was God at
[48:02] the beginning.
[48:03] But he that is uh but he that is the
[48:07] beginning of the creation of God was
[48:09] Jesus Christ when he was made manifest
[48:12] when God lived in him. Now this is a a a
[48:16] new slide here. Now if I had to take one
[48:21] single little cell that every one of you
[48:25] come from one little teeny cell germ
[48:29] please notice where this is 1953.
[48:33] What is a germ? A germ is a little tiny,
[48:36] the smallest of cell. Well, what's after
[48:39] that? Now, I've took you down from every
[48:42] piece of you down to this one little
[48:46] cell, and I haven't found you yet.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; I just got your cells laid out.
[48:55] You can get you can get the string of
[48:57] the DNA and they can draw diagrams of
[49:00] it, but they'll they won't find you
[49:02] there.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Right
[49:05] &gt;&gt; now, you have a prophet that looks into
[49:06] the invisible, into the unseen, and he
[49:10] says, "I I broke it all down. I've got
[49:13] you down. You're you're sitting here
[49:14] with a somewhere between 10 and 100
[49:17] trillion cells. And now you've got one
[49:20] that's speaking on behalf of the creator
[49:22] says, "I've got you down to one cell."
[49:25] &gt;&gt; I've got you down to one cell. You can't
[49:28] even see it with your naked eye. I've
[49:30] got you down to one cell and I haven't
[49:32] found you yet.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; You talk about a creator.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:39] And I also emphasizing what kind of a
[49:42] messenger that God brought you and I.
[49:45] We're not we're we have no reason to
[49:48] feel like stuffed church friends.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; We're we ought to be very humbled people
[49:53] &gt;&gt; that God would send this kind of a
[49:55] messenger.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; So that you could understand things.
[49:59] You'll never hear this from Plato or
[50:02] someone else.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear it in Darwin's theory.
[50:05] You'll never catch it in a Bible school.
[50:08] That's right.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "And I have I just I've got
[50:13] your cells laid out." Well, then he
[50:15] said, "The next thing, blood cells and
[50:17] flesh cells and whatever they are,
[50:20] laying them all out here, but I haven't
[50:23] got you yet.
[50:31] He is God's creation." Speaking of Jesus
[50:34] Christ, the first and the last, the
[50:36] amen, the beginning of the creation of
[50:38] God. When God created himself a body, he
[50:42] came down and lived in it. And that's
[50:44] the beginning of the creation of God.
[50:48] Oh, isn't he wonderful?
[50:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[51:00] See that is
[51:14] okay. I want to go on to
[51:16] leadership here
[51:20] where there's only one form of eternal
[51:23] life and that life comes from God. and
[51:27] he for ordained every creature that
[51:29] would ever have it. And just as you were
[51:32] the gene in your father, you were a gene
[51:35] in God. Now, I uh I think it's
[51:39] important. I'm not trying to be uh I'm
[51:42] not that, you know, I'm not trying to
[51:46] get all technical, but I I've thought
[51:49] about it as I've read and done some
[51:51] studying. And the way brother Brennham
[51:53] has said it
[51:55] now he talks about the cells because
[51:58] the gene the gene is actually the
[52:01] nature.
[52:02] The gene is the it is the carrier of the
[52:07] character or nature of a person. The
[52:09] gene is not the cell. The gene the cell
[52:13] is your is the living organism as I
[52:16] understand it. And then but the gene is
[52:19] it is the the the makeup of the person.
[52:23] It is the carrier they say the unit of
[52:25] carrier of hereditary what you've
[52:28] inherited from your uh parents or
[52:32] greatgrandparents or whatever more. And
[52:35] so as you were a gene in your father you
[52:39] were a gene in God. One of his
[52:41] attributes. So now you're a carrier of
[52:44] his attributes.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His attributes. We speak
[52:48] about his attributes. His attributes,
[52:52] excuse me, friends, are your attributes.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; If you came from God,
[52:58] &gt;&gt; you you he has carried to you.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; He's conveyed to you his nature, his
[53:04] character.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And made us made it accessible to us.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; G.
[53:13] Have you ever had traits from your
[53:15] parents that you recognized and uh
[53:20] and then you you tried to control them?
[53:24] You tried to take mastery over them
[53:28] because you didn't really particularly
[53:30] like it when you saw it in your parents
[53:32] and you saw it as a child. You saw it as
[53:34] a young person. You saw it in your
[53:36] mother or dad. Saw them do certain
[53:37] things. You thought, you know, you know,
[53:39] I I And then you started getting up
[53:42] adult in your own life and found
[53:44] yourself doing the same thing. So, I'm
[53:46] going to I'm going to kind of master
[53:47] that. I'm going to squatchch it. I'm
[53:49] going to
[53:51] be like brother G Roald. Anyhow,
[53:56] I know what that's all about. You have
[53:58] that. I mean, little simple things.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Little simple things. You'll just put
[54:02] your hand up to your face just exactly
[54:04] the way dad did it. You'll just do
[54:08] something and exactly the way your dad
[54:11] did it or your mother did it or somebody
[54:14] in your family did it.
[54:17] We inherit it. I'm glad that we have
[54:20] that because it helps to bring home the
[54:24] truth
[54:25] &gt;&gt; that if I got that through a human gene,
[54:28] I certainly got something worth having
[54:30] from the spiritual father.
[54:32] [Music]
[54:34] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here on a Wednesday night
[54:35] because there's a certain attraction to
[54:37] the word of God. God loves his word.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; You've gained that.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; He loves holiness. You love that.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; His presence. Amen.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; He is God. He's worshiped.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; We love that.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; I could enumerate a lot of things
[54:59] were one of his attributes to begin
[55:01] with. You come forth in the bedding
[55:04] ground of your mother. Your father
[55:06] didn't know you. You were in his loins.
[55:09] And when you come forth in the be in the
[55:11] bedding ground of mother, then you
[55:13] become a human being and are made in the
[55:16] image of your father. Now you can
[55:19] fellowship with him. And the same thing
[55:22] by God. If you've got eternal life, you
[55:26] are here because your name was placed on
[55:28] the lamb's book of life before there was
[55:32] even a foundation of the world. You're a
[55:35] gene, a spiritual gene out of your
[55:37] heavenly father, a part of God's word.
[55:42] That be so, as I've said, then you was
[55:45] with Jesus when he was here because he
[55:48] was the word,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; and you suffered with him, died with
[55:52] him, buried with him, and rose with him,
[55:56] and now sitting in heavenly places with
[55:59] him.
[56:00] They that were with me,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; they that followed me,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; they that were with me,
[56:08] &gt;&gt; shall have this reward. And whatever the
[56:10] reward is, we are we're I don't say
[56:13] we're we care not because brother
[56:15] Brandham says we don't put enough
[56:16] emphasis upon rewards, but we're not
[56:18] living here for reward. We're we are
[56:21] living here because we love him and we
[56:24] and and I sometimes think the world is
[56:27] so kooky that I wouldn't want to live
[56:29] like the world if there was no heaven.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Sister Margaret.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; I feel happy about it, too.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody could have clapped
[56:40] at that one.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Even if there was no heaven, it's still
[56:45] the best thing going.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] Glory.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:02] So now your name was in the lamb's book
[57:04] of life before the foundation of the
[57:08] world.
[57:10] And when the lamb took the book,
[57:13] he didn't say anything.
[57:16] you don't find anything of him being
[57:18] spoken
[57:20] and uh I don't know if I can convey this
[57:23] to you but I will attempt to do so.
[57:26] I believe and this is my own personal
[57:29] belief but I believe that in the
[57:33] ministry of brother Brandham as as it
[57:35] was let me just step back in the
[57:36] ministry of John the Baptist his
[57:39] ministry bridged from the old testament
[57:42] into the new
[57:45] &gt;&gt; you follow that and in the old testament
[57:48] it was god above the people
[57:51] and now he bridged it to until he could
[57:55] say, "This is the lamb of God that takes
[57:58] away the sin of the world." So he
[58:00] bridged it from God above the people to
[58:03] God with the people.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; You follow me?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And from from God the Father to God the
[58:12] Son.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; He bridged that.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Please hear me close now. Brother
[58:19] Brandham's ministry
[58:21] bridged
[58:23] the manifestation of Jesus Christ
[58:26] from lamb
[58:29] to lion.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; The reason I say that is because
[58:36] he came and I'll say he came. But when
[58:41] Jesus came, and excuse me for going back
[58:43] and forth, but I need to in order to get
[58:45] the picture. When Jesus came, the Bible
[58:49] tells us that he went into the synagogue
[58:51] as was his custom
[58:55] &gt;&gt; and they they kept sacred the seventh
[58:58] day and he himself was the first day
[59:02] &gt;&gt; because he was the beginning.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; So he was actually spanning that period
[59:07] of time. John John the forerunner said
[59:11] this is the lamb. In other words, he's
[59:13] pointing forward. He's not saying
[59:15] something that he was prophecies from
[59:17] back here or whatever more. He's
[59:19] pointing forward. This is the lamb of
[59:22] God that takes away the sin of the
[59:23] world. They had no phrase like that.
[59:26] This was revolutionary. He's the lamb of
[59:28] God. What's the lamb of God? They knew a
[59:31] lamb dies, a lamb suffers, a lamb is the
[59:33] sacrifice. But here's a man and he's the
[59:36] lamb of God.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Still with me? Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham's ministry now
[59:46] he's uh he he's he's also prophet,
[59:49] priest, and king.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is all of them. He's
[59:53] prophet when he was on earth. And he's
[59:56] priest. He took his own blood and
[59:59] entered on in the scripture says on our
[1:00:01] behalf with his own blood
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; that the that the sin question was
[1:00:06] settled. Your sin question was settled.
[1:00:09] All right. And we've been sprinkled or
[1:00:11] washed by the blood of the lamb. Now, so
[1:00:14] he enters into the holy of holies. It
[1:00:16] says the scripture, he enters into the
[1:00:19] holy of holies with his own blood
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; once.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; It was all finished. There not going to
[1:00:25] be another sacrifice like that.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; All right. So, he enters in with his own
[1:00:30] blood. And for all of these centuries
[1:00:33] now, we have uh we have an era or a time
[1:00:37] of grace. And he's the lamb of God. The
[1:00:39] lamb of God. And uh and I'll say the
[1:00:43] religion has developed. And when brother
[1:00:45] Brennham came on the scene when he when
[1:00:48] his ministry broke on the scene is
[1:00:51] identical to Jesus Christ. When Jesus
[1:00:53] broke on the scene, he went to the
[1:00:55] synagogue as they did when brother
[1:00:57] Brandham's ministry broke on the scene.
[1:00:59] He broke he he came amongst the people
[1:01:02] and they were uh whatever it was that
[1:01:05] the the I should say the the churches or
[1:01:08] the last move of God or Pentecost and
[1:01:10] that he said it was the Pentecostal
[1:01:12] people that received him.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Did he not say that?
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; He said that because that was the last
[1:01:17] move of God. So he comes right with them
[1:01:20] and and they're speaking in tongues and
[1:01:22] manifesting all kinds of gifts and
[1:01:24] things like that. And it's just as
[1:01:25] though he just comes to with that first
[1:01:27] pull and just moves in that realm
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and they're just a, you know, they're
[1:01:32] not startled with the fact that he takes
[1:01:34] them by the hand. And I sat there as
[1:01:37] some of you young fellas, I sat there
[1:01:39] and watched as he took people by the
[1:01:40] hand and declared what their diseases
[1:01:43] were. And then they weren't startled
[1:01:46] when the second pull came and and he
[1:01:48] stood back and they stood there uh a few
[1:01:51] feet away and he began to reveal the
[1:01:53] secret of their heart. That didn't
[1:01:55] startle them. That was that was
[1:01:57] wonderful and they just wanted to have
[1:02:00] that and they wanted to see that and
[1:02:01] they wanted to stand there and they
[1:02:02] wanted their own heart to be revealed.
[1:02:06] But then when the when the book was
[1:02:09] opened
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; and the lion had to cry,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; now it had a different kind of a voice.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to hear that
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; because that wasn't just down in line
[1:02:22] with what they had taught all these
[1:02:24] centuries or all these years. It wasn't
[1:02:27] in line with that. It it that now now
[1:02:31] the creator was coming to correct
[1:02:33] things,
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; correct the home,
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; correct the church, correct our lives,
[1:02:38] correct our our our order, correct
[1:02:41] everything to put it in place.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And that's where it become very very
[1:02:46] difficult and people struggled with it
[1:02:48] and chafed after it and chafed under it
[1:02:51] and all the rest of it and then they had
[1:02:52] to walk away from it and finally have to
[1:02:55] say nasty things and crucify that word.
[1:02:58] not realizing they think they're getting
[1:03:00] out of ministry and but actually when
[1:03:02] the word when it when when the sound
[1:03:04] cried out
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; now this almighty God in the beginning
[1:03:11] God said let there be
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; and there was
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; are you are you listening
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; and there was why was there because God
[1:03:23] was in the word
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; God was in that word and In other words,
[1:03:28] the word was pregnantated
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; with life,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; pregnantated with power,
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; pregnantated with creative power.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; God was in his word.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And thus the word can say, "And in the
[1:03:43] beginning was the word of God, and the
[1:03:46] word was God."
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; It wasn't only God's voice,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; but the word was God.
[1:03:54] And now coming way to the end of time
[1:03:58] after the beginning of the creation, the
[1:04:00] new creation which Jesus Christ was that
[1:04:03] beginning. And then he prophesied that
[1:04:05] in the end he'll reveal himself again.
[1:04:08] And what does he do? He becomes word.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Now there he was the word. He was the
[1:04:15] word in the in the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:18] And God transmitted himself down. And
[1:04:21] the Bible says or I should say the
[1:04:23] prophet of God says that he materialized
[1:04:25] himself. He materialized himself
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; in the body and he became Jesus Christ.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; You following me?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Now in the end time he takes an adopted
[1:04:38] son. One that was born in sin shape and
[1:04:41] iniquity like you and I.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; But one that was called
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; to become a messenger to be the
[1:04:47] messenger of the age. born a prophet.
[1:04:50] Couldn't help it. And I tell you
[1:04:52] friends, I listen to it. I just marvel.
[1:04:54] I just marvel that God would even send
[1:04:57] this kind of proof to us. It must We
[1:05:00] must have been uh believers of the
[1:05:03] unbelievers of the utmost kind in this
[1:05:06] generation because anything less than
[1:05:08] this probably would have convinced us.
[1:05:10] But we we God was determined. I am going
[1:05:13] to show them. I'm going to vindicate it.
[1:05:16] I'm going to prove it. I'm going to go
[1:05:18] over and over and over again. I won't do
[1:05:20] it once or twice. I'll do it for nights
[1:05:23] at a time. I'll do it all over the
[1:05:25] world.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So that this unbelieving nation,
[1:05:30] unbelieving uh world can come to
[1:05:33] judgment.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:05:39] the same messenger takes it all the way
[1:05:42] from a first pull and a second pull when
[1:05:44] God is proving it into a third pull. And
[1:05:47] the third pull is a pull.
[1:05:51] It's a p u l a pull.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; And they wrote the song I feel the pull.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; When when when Jesus was walking, God
[1:06:00] was in him. God manifest in the flesh.
[1:06:02] He's walking along the shores of Galilee
[1:06:04] and he said to young men, "Come and
[1:06:07] follow me." I can tell you they felt the
[1:06:10] pull.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; They didn't feel a pull of a miracle or
[1:06:13] a sign in the hand. They didn't feel the
[1:06:16] pull because he revealed some secret to
[1:06:19] their heart. They felt the pull because
[1:06:21] just at his words, come and follow me.
[1:06:24] He didn't have to give them some great
[1:06:26] or uh you know uh oratory or some great
[1:06:30] speech or he didn't have to preach a
[1:06:32] sermon. He didn't have to convince them.
[1:06:34] He didn't have to try to force them.
[1:06:35] Just come
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; follow me. And they felt the pull.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; it's for you if you've never felt that.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I look around this room.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't live your life without
[1:06:50] feeling that pull.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I love your voice.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Let me hear your voice.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And you say, "What is it pulling me to?"
[1:07:00] Not pulling you into the church. Not
[1:07:02] pulling you just so that you have a good
[1:07:04] a nice service. That's not the pull. The
[1:07:07] pull is so that they would be
[1:07:10] transformed from their old nature to
[1:07:13] their new nature so they could bring
[1:07:15] forth what he had ordained them to bring
[1:07:18] forth. Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham could not bring forth Isaac till
[1:07:23] his name was changed. And in the
[1:07:25] changing of the name, the change of a
[1:07:27] character
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; and he became a different man.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Peter had his name changed because in
[1:07:34] his old nature, he could wield a sword.
[1:07:36] But in his new nature, he could take the
[1:07:39] keys and open up the kingdom.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Saul had to have a name change to match
[1:07:46] his new nature. Under Saul, he could
[1:07:49] take and throw people in prison. But
[1:07:52] under his new nature, he could take and
[1:07:54] give them the gospel.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; My brothers, my sisters, on this
[1:08:00] Wednesday evening, I'm not even I'm not
[1:08:02] even think I don't care how many are
[1:08:04] here. I preach like I preach to the
[1:08:06] world.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; This spoken word came with this kind of
[1:08:11] indication so that you could have the
[1:08:13] full affirmation.
[1:08:15] This word is cell upon self
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; to change my spiritual being
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; from the old nature to the new nature
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and in the new nature I don't even know
[1:08:27] fully what he wants me to do but you
[1:08:30] keep getting cell upon cell and you'll
[1:08:33] be built up into the man into the woman
[1:08:36] that God wants here on the earth
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; and then you can say I was with him
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and he will say you that were with me.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; In the regeneration because this is
[1:08:50] still creation.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; And that is why in the prophet's
[1:08:54] ministry, he had to have the proof. Let
[1:08:57] there be a squirrel.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And it was there.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It didn't jump off the tree. It was
[1:09:04] created.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Because the third pull came to us in the
[1:09:08] demonstration of creation.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; I am the amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. the first and the last.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; I am the true and faithful and true
[1:09:18] witness,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; the beginning of the creation of the
[1:09:23] beginning of the creation of God. Tell
[1:09:25] my last messenger
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; that's who I am
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; because it would be his portion of his
[1:09:31] ministry to demonstrate because you have
[1:09:34] to be created.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; When we say we got to be changed,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; you'll be changed. You'll go under a
[1:09:43] regeneration.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; You'll be recreated
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; from a dying person to a living person.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; From mortal to immortality,
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; from corruption to incorruption.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister, we need a
[1:09:58] renovation.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Complete renovation
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; from the old man that we were born.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, you got cells and they're dying.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, you got a nature by a gene and it's
[1:10:10] got to be changed. Hallelujah. I'm not
[1:10:13] interested in the old human nature. I'm
[1:10:15] not interested in the old human gene. We
[1:10:17] need to have the gene of God.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, let the Holy Spirit come
[1:10:23] to that gene, that spiritual gene that
[1:10:26] came from my heavenly parent."
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; How many people have I got here could
[1:10:32] say amen to that?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Let the spiritual gene, let the Holy
[1:10:37] Ghost come upon that spiritual gene.
[1:10:40] Hallelujah. manifest that life.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Manifest this eternal life.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're going to do
[1:10:55] tonight, but I'm going to have my own
[1:10:57] revival up here.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That old nature, I hate it.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Gets us in trouble.
[1:11:09] We're not interested in it.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; I thought much upon this prophecy and I
[1:11:22] just related the prophecy God gave that
[1:11:24] he'll put enmity between the woman,
[1:11:27] between the serpent, between thee,
[1:11:29] talking to the serpent and the woman,
[1:11:31] and between thy seed and her seed, and
[1:11:34] she shall bruise thy head, and thou
[1:11:36] shalt bruise his heel. And as a result
[1:11:38] of that, we all came the by the same
[1:11:40] way.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Might have been in a nice hospital,
[1:11:43] might might have been at home, might
[1:11:45] have been in a barn or wherever it was.
[1:11:47] It was a mess of birth. We all came the
[1:11:50] same way.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And that which came by the woman dies.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; We didn't only come by the woman, but we
[1:11:55] came by the word. Who is the man?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The man Jesus Christ.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by the man, we live.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; And he reversed things.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. And of any age ever needed to be
[1:12:09] reversed, it's this one.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a woman's world.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Sisters, I'm not talking about you. I'm
[1:12:15] talking about the whole spirit of the
[1:12:17] age.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Whole thing is just manned and
[1:12:21] manipulated by women. And and it it's
[1:12:24] it's Satan's Eden. Once again,
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; we don't need to say a whole lot about
[1:12:29] that.
[1:12:31] Now
[1:12:34] in Hebrews it says, "For it became him
[1:12:37] for whom all things and by whom are all
[1:12:40] things in bringing many sons unto glory
[1:12:43] to make them the captain to make the
[1:12:46] captain of their salvation perfect
[1:12:49] through sufferings. And again I will put
[1:12:51] my trust in him. And again behold I and
[1:12:55] the children which God hath given me.
[1:12:58] And out of the bosom of the father, God
[1:13:01] came the out of the bosom of the father,
[1:13:03] God came the son. And the very gene of
[1:13:06] the father, I'm wanting to bring this
[1:13:09] again to you. All the genes of the
[1:13:14] father, the life of the father was in
[1:13:18] the son. Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; My wife's dad was in the first world war
[1:13:28] and he was in a very very difficult his
[1:13:31] his brother also was in the war and he
[1:13:34] was at Vimemy Ridge and you've no doubt
[1:13:37] all heard about Vimemy Ridge
[1:13:40] and Lord willing sister Biscll and I
[1:13:43] will be in Belgium in the first part of
[1:13:46] December and Brother Nathaniel Iverson's
[1:13:50] brother David said that we can take you
[1:13:53] to a number of places and one of them is
[1:13:55] Flanders Fields
[1:13:58] and uh one is Vim Ridge and different
[1:14:02] places that have a lot of significance.
[1:14:06] Uh
[1:14:08] my father-in-law told me one one on one
[1:14:11] occasion that uh he had a buddy and his
[1:14:16] buddy just became very very he he became
[1:14:20] very I won't say despondent but he
[1:14:22] became very kind of depressed just like
[1:14:26] in a day or so something like that just
[1:14:28] came on him and he was saying he was
[1:14:31] saying to the his buddies and to my
[1:14:34] father-in-law I just feel like I'm I'm
[1:14:36] going to get it. I feel like I'm going
[1:14:37] to be killed. I feel like I'm going to
[1:14:39] be killed. He just kept saying that and
[1:14:41] they went into the trenches and he took
[1:14:42] a bullet right in the head and he was
[1:14:45] gone.
[1:14:47] And my father-in-law, he could have been
[1:14:50] he could have been there, but it was
[1:14:52] impossible
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; because my wife was still in him.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; That's that's the end of the subject.
[1:15:04] Amen.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; If somebody had to come in this life to
[1:15:09] represent something of the heavenly
[1:15:11] father,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; you can be right on you can you can have
[1:15:13] an atomic bomb fall and it won't do a
[1:15:15] thing.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; It just be a fizzle.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; I I believe that with all my heart.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And I've talked to a lot of people that
[1:15:24] have been right in the middle of the
[1:15:26] shells and the bombs falling and the
[1:15:28] artillery and everything else. And even
[1:15:30] the spirit that was in them, they had no
[1:15:32] fear
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; because something was telling them that
[1:15:34] nothing can touch them.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Who's that? Uh, one of the Bosnian
[1:15:39] brothers, the old man. What's his name?
[1:15:41] Brother Milco.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; The old brother.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yes. Neto. Brother Nato. He was
[1:15:48] driving a fuel truck
[1:15:51] in the midst of this war in Bosnia. He
[1:15:54] was driving a fuel truck. And he said
[1:15:56] the bullets were flying every direction.
[1:15:58] He is driving the truck. He didn't have
[1:16:00] a bit of fear.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Well, he hadn't come to the knowledge of
[1:16:03] the message yet. I think that that's
[1:16:05] what had to happen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I I I would have had a
[1:16:09] few second thoughts driving a fuel truck
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; while all that artillery and shelling is
[1:16:15] going on. Let's face it, we're all
[1:16:17] human.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Behold, I and the children you've given
[1:16:26] me.
[1:16:27] He couldn't say, "Behold, I Excuse me,
[1:16:30] father. There's three or four that are
[1:16:31] missing."
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He couldn't say that.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You're going to be there.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; You're going to be there.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; That to me is a wonderful confidence.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You're here because your
[1:16:46] name was placed on the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:48] Life before there was even a foundation
[1:16:51] of the world. And you're a gene, a
[1:16:53] spiritual gene out of your heavenly
[1:16:55] father. Now that book I haven't got time
[1:17:00] this evening but that book
[1:17:04] carried or was the story
[1:17:07] of the account of your spiritual jane.
[1:17:12] Brother Brandham said
[1:17:14] when you're reading the church ages, it
[1:17:16] will sound like there's two books,
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; but it's really only one,
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And the one is the book of your natural
[1:17:23] life.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; And it kind of flows out like wheat that
[1:17:27] would be growing. The life continues on.
[1:17:30] The stock of the wheat has no
[1:17:32] resemblance to the blade. The green
[1:17:34] blade is not the same color. It's not
[1:17:37] the same shape. is not nothing the same,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; but it's the same life
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; that came right from the seed that was
[1:17:44] in the ground till you have seed up at
[1:17:46] the head
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; in the fall time at the harvest time.
[1:17:50] You It's gone back to wheat again. And
[1:17:51] that's brother Brennham makes that
[1:17:53] statement. Those you I'm speaking to
[1:17:55] people I expect knows the message. He
[1:17:57] said it's back to wheat again.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; It's harvest time again. It's already
[1:18:02] arrived.
[1:18:05] Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And I say if you're a gene, a spiritual
[1:18:10] gene out of your heavenly father, a part
[1:18:13] of God's word, that's what it is, a part
[1:18:17] of God's word. And that be so. He said,
[1:18:20] as I've said, then you was with Jesus
[1:18:23] when he was here on earth, etc. So God,
[1:18:26] now I'm breaking in just a little bit
[1:18:28] different. G, give me a few more
[1:18:30] minutes. Now I'm reaching on beyond
[1:18:32] that. God thought of himself as being
[1:18:36] human in that great mind of God who
[1:18:40] created heavens and galaxies and
[1:18:42] universes. This God he thought of
[1:18:45] himself of being human and in the future
[1:18:49] home. He says now in the beginning was
[1:18:51] the word. Catch it. Don't ever tire that
[1:18:54] phrase. In the beginning was the word
[1:18:57] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:18:59] among us. He said the three stages. It
[1:19:02] was an attribute. It was an attribute
[1:19:04] first was in God
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; that he thought himself as being human
[1:19:10] and that transmitted him down
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; to be Jesus.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; The thought transmitted him down to be
[1:19:18] Jesus. And so thus Jesus possessed all
[1:19:21] the qualities of character of God
[1:19:23] because he was the gene of his father or
[1:19:26] the son of God. And all those seeds were
[1:19:29] resting in God's great providence in the
[1:19:32] rising of the sun. I quoted this Sunday.
[1:19:35] Then he said, "When he came forth on
[1:19:38] that morning, because I live, you live
[1:19:40] also." Not only was he the beneficiary
[1:19:44] of the resurrection, not only did he
[1:19:46] rise, but he says, "But all those seed
[1:19:49] that was resting in God's great
[1:19:52] providence was a benefactor of that
[1:19:55] resurrection life because he said,
[1:19:58] "Because I live, you shall live also."
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; That was the breaking of the seal
[1:20:03] because he was brought up. This is the
[1:20:05] breaking of the Easter seal on it was
[1:20:08] the secret. Yes,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; it was their life be beyond death.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; No one had had no one had come forth
[1:20:15] like this and proved
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; that he could raise himself up again and
[1:20:20] prove that he could live and eat as he
[1:20:23] did before he did. And he this is not a
[1:20:26] spirit. Have you any meat, brethren?
[1:20:28] Here's a fish and some honeycomb. And he
[1:20:30] ate it and vanished from the place. What
[1:20:33] a body.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Because I live, you shall live also.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You that have been with me,
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; you that have been with me
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; in this regeneration, in this part of
[1:20:45] the regeneration,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; this is what is promised to us.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And we must declare it in life and
[1:20:52] declare it.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; If God was taking us off the face of the
[1:20:55] earth, this should be something that we
[1:20:56] should be able to not only just hang on
[1:20:58] to, but also to declare.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; And because I live, you shall live also.
[1:21:04] And because he was brought up, so will
[1:21:07] everyone that's in Christ be brought up
[1:21:09] with him.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I say thank you, Father,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; that you sent Elijah to say that
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; everyone when he came up, everyone that
[1:21:21] was in him. So now it puts us to a test.
[1:21:24] Do you believe you were in him?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Everyone that was in him have to come up
[1:21:28] with him.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; If you're in the grave with him, you
[1:21:31] have to come out of the grave with him.
[1:21:33] Hallelujah. Of which baptism is just a
[1:21:36] signal signifies it. But if you were in
[1:21:39] the grave, you've got to come out of the
[1:21:40] grave.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; And if he ascended, you have to ascend.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have to ascend.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; And if he ascended to the right hand of
[1:21:50] the majesty of God, you'll be there with
[1:21:53] him because you were in him in the first
[1:21:55] place.
[1:21:57] There's no place
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; where somehow we dissipate or we
[1:22:02] disappear or somehow uh we're lost in
[1:22:05] the process. We're not lost in the
[1:22:07] process.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Nobody's lost in the process.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say glory to God in the
[1:22:16] face of every doubting devil.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:21] He won't lose a one. And that's why I
[1:22:23] can say I and the children.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Behold, I am the children.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I've lost none of them.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; I came forth from you a gene of your own
[1:22:36] nature. A cell of the almighty God.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you gave me a body and a
[1:22:43] life to live. And I lived a life. And I
[1:22:46] have those that were with me and still
[1:22:48] with me.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; There were some that were with me back
[1:22:51] then. And there's some that are with me
[1:22:53] in the end time.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; A lot of people want to ride along and
[1:23:00] be have have the benefits of of the
[1:23:03] healing and of the you know all the nice
[1:23:05] things while he was the lamb of God all
[1:23:08] this time 2,000 years as the lamb of
[1:23:11] God. But at the end time comes one and
[1:23:15] he comes to the synagogue or he comes to
[1:23:18] the churches as was his custom. Yes,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; he always did that. Sang the songs that
[1:23:24] they were accustomed to.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; But then Revelation 10 had to be
[1:23:29] fulfilled
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and he was part of that.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; And then that book,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that book had to be opened.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; And in the book was names or natures of
[1:23:39] life
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; of those that were struggling on earth
[1:23:42] who couldn't live it.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And now the lamb is going to call them
[1:23:46] forth.
[1:23:49] And I say to this congregation, I say to
[1:23:52] all who will ever hear this message or
[1:23:55] hear this service, have you heard the
[1:23:57] lamb call?
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Not a preacher called, the lamb call.
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; You've probably heard the ad. You know,
[1:24:08] you someone comes knocking on the door
[1:24:10] and they tell you who's calling. Amway
[1:24:14] calling.
[1:24:15] This isn't Amway. This is the living
[1:24:18] way.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the lamb calling.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Hello. This is the lamb calling.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I've been waiting to hear your
[1:24:27] voice.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; What can you tell me, oh lamb of God? I
[1:24:34] can tell you your old nature is gone in
[1:24:37] my blood.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And your new nature in Christ Jesus.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you a new nature. Peter, you
[1:24:46] couldn't open the keys to the kingdom
[1:24:48] until the very spirit is in me came in
[1:24:51] you and changed your nature.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul, you couldn't write the New
[1:24:55] Testament until your nature was changed.
[1:24:58] And so your nature has to your name has
[1:25:00] to be changed from Saul to Paul.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham, Abram to Abraham,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Sarai to Sarah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Glory. And he inserted some of his own
[1:25:12] life. And that was in the Old Testament.
[1:25:15] And I asked the Jewish rabbi, not Rabbi
[1:25:17] Richmond, but one here in town. I said,
[1:25:19] "Is there any significance to H, Abram's
[1:25:23] name being changed from Abraham, Abram
[1:25:25] to Abraham?" Oh, he said, "Very much
[1:25:27] so." He said, "You see, H in our
[1:25:31] alphabet is stands for divinity. It's
[1:25:33] associated with divinity."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And so that was what was inserted in
[1:25:38] Abram's name.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Divinity. divine
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; nature.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something that could bring
[1:25:45] forth Isaac.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Abram couldn't bring forth Isaac. You
[1:25:49] and I can't bring forth Jesus Christ.
[1:25:51] Tell this nature without the book being
[1:25:54] open.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you with me, friends?
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; That's why Pentecost was doing its best.
[1:25:59] And you can preach as hard as you want.
[1:26:01] You can preach what the people shouldn't
[1:26:03] do. That won't do it. You got to call
[1:26:06] their name forth out of the book.
[1:26:09] You got to say here you are children.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; The whole na the whole nature of God is
[1:26:15] presented to you.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; How is it presented? Word by word, cell
[1:26:21] by cell. And my brother, my sister, you
[1:26:24] that are here in this service, you maybe
[1:26:26] don't know what you don't realize what
[1:26:28] is happening service by service, but you
[1:26:31] are or or you hear a tape or a message,
[1:26:33] but you're hearing cell upon cell
[1:26:37] upon cell. And I tell you, I declare in
[1:26:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:26:43] that's thus sayith the Lord, that word
[1:26:46] will change you.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "If you're a son of God and I'm
[1:27:00] a son of God, we were a daughter. You're
[1:27:02] a daughter of God. You're in God at the
[1:27:05] beginning."
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came became the fullness
[1:27:09] of the of the word, then we were in him
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; in germ form.
[1:27:16] Germ form. When he was crucified, we was
[1:27:19] crucified in his body. Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; When he rose from the dead, we rose with
[1:27:23] him.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I've heard that
[1:27:25] before, brother Ed. You said it last
[1:27:27] Sunday." You said, "I tell you what, as
[1:27:30] long as we're alive, we want to be
[1:27:32] saying the same thing."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; You want to tell the devil that every
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; day,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; I'm in him who defeated you.
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Here's what they say scientifically. The
[1:27:46] cell is the functional basic unit of
[1:27:50] life. The cell, the C l is the
[1:27:55] functional basic unit of life. It is the
[1:27:59] smallest unit of life that is classified
[1:28:02] as a living thing. Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; So the smallest unit of life, the
[1:28:07] smallest thing that could be imagined is
[1:28:11] a a cell is the smallest thing that
[1:28:14] could be classified as a living thing
[1:28:17] and is often called the building block
[1:28:21] of life.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; And you have somewhere between 10 and
[1:28:25] 100 trillion trillion cells.
[1:28:31] Now, the real you. I'm going to close in
[1:28:34] just a few moments. The real you
[1:28:39] and where you live.
[1:28:43] You had a You talk about a prophet. I
[1:28:47] mean, friends, God in that messenger
[1:28:50] could just go through all of those
[1:28:51] cells. Now, I'm down to one cell
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; and I still can't find you.
[1:29:02] Because the cell is not you.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; The cells make you up this body.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; But the the you are the life of that
[1:29:12] cell.
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; And the messenger is saying now I've got
[1:29:18] down to one teeny cell
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; and I can't find you.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glad you couldn't find
[1:29:28] me. Amen.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Now he says if you notice the
[1:29:35] subconscious is where you live.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; He says that's where you yourself live
[1:29:42] in perfect faith. He said his spirit is
[1:29:44] here
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; and he knows you.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He knows what science can
[1:29:50] never find.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He knows you and you've got one thing to
[1:29:55] do and that's to believe it,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; to accept it. Yes,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; he knows you. Believe that. He knows
[1:30:02] what's in you.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; He knows what you are.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; He knows what your desire is.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And he knows what you have need of.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Can I say that again?
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He knows what what's in you.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; He knows what you are
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; and he knows what your desire is
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; and he knows what you have need of.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; The real you.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He said in things that are to be
[1:30:36] this old earthly tabernacle.
[1:30:39] You know what it is? This body is like
[1:30:41] an old coat that you wear. A coat that
[1:30:45] you once wore wear, but now you have one
[1:30:48] so much better. you don't use it
[1:30:51] anymore.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; You know, my wife,
[1:30:56] she one day she says, "I need a new
[1:30:59] coat."
[1:31:00] I said, "Yeah, okay." And it was just
[1:31:03] the right time. I said, "Okay, we'll go
[1:31:06] into town. We'll drive into Vancouver
[1:31:09] and shop for a coat."
[1:31:12] So
[1:31:14] I just hit the go button, play button on
[1:31:18] the tape machine and it just started out
[1:31:21] like this. He said, "This body is like
[1:31:24] an old coat and you wear and the coat
[1:31:28] that you once wear and now you've got
[1:31:30] one so much better you don't use it
[1:31:33] anymore. What do you do?" He says, "You
[1:31:35] hang it up in the closet for you've got
[1:31:37] a better one."
[1:31:39] My wife took that as a confirmation.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "You are the inside of that.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Remember that the garment only bore your
[1:31:52] image,
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; but you don't need it anymore now.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; You hung it up.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; It's a rag."
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And that's the way this old body is.
[1:32:05] It's bore the image of the heavenly. Yet
[1:32:08] it's not you.
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; It's not you. You are on the inside of
[1:32:21] that body.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; You, the spirit of God is on the inside
[1:32:26] of that body. He said you. And then he
[1:32:28] said the spirit of God.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; You're in on the inside of that body.
[1:32:33] And what makes the outside come into
[1:32:36] subjections? Because the inside is
[1:32:39] pulling it,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; bringing it in line with the word of
[1:32:43] God.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; You're inside you, yourself, your being.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, no science can
[1:32:52] ever find you.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon says quite
[1:32:55] frankly, you've never seen me
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; and I've never seen you.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; All we see is the old coat.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; And this body is just an old coat. And
[1:33:08] someday what you will do with it,
[1:33:11] someday it will hang in the earth's hall
[1:33:15] of memory of you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; And you'll put it out yonder in the
[1:33:18] grave and somebody will put a tombstone
[1:33:21] up. Here lies Reverend so and so or John
[1:33:24] so and so at so and so. He says it'll
[1:33:27] lie there as a memorial of you. just a
[1:33:31] memorial of you.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; The people just seeing you in this and
[1:33:36] what you was your real you was on the
[1:33:40] inside of that.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; You know that is so ultimately
[1:33:44] profoundly simple and yet it's so true
[1:33:47] because your your whole being answers to
[1:33:49] it just saying amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; And then he talks about your body,
[1:33:54] spirit and soul. He says, "Now the
[1:33:55] outside body is the five inlets, your
[1:33:59] earthly home that you taste, feel and
[1:34:02] smell and see and so on. The inside
[1:34:05] which is spirit, five senses, but he
[1:34:08] says but the inside of that the soul has
[1:34:11] one thing."
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Now he's talking to believers. I want to
[1:34:17] say this to this congregation. That's
[1:34:19] where you live.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; That's not a sermon.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's a statement.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; That's where you live.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's where we live.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; I claim that.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; And you and I need that.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; We need it. If you're going to get
[1:34:43] through this life,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; you sit in my chair sometime,
[1:34:50] you you wouldn't be so surprised why I
[1:34:53] hang on to this prophet's words like
[1:34:55] that because I've seen people go after
[1:34:58] education. I go after business, go after
[1:35:01] this or go after that and on down the
[1:35:03] road, the world and Satan takes his toll
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; on it. It's just unbelievable. Just
[1:35:09] takes his toll on that. That's not what
[1:35:12] this life is all about.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; You got one channel. It's down that
[1:35:16] soul. And God sent Elijah to point right
[1:35:18] to it and tell you that's where you
[1:35:20] live.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And every word." Now
[1:35:30] listen, this is not just a quote. That's
[1:35:32] where you live. And now when the word
[1:35:35] became flesh, it says, "And every word
[1:35:37] in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in
[1:35:40] seed form. And if received, if
[1:35:44] received." Hello.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; If received, do you receive it?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Let me hear all the young people say,
[1:35:52] "Amen."
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me hear them say it again.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; If you receive it, let's hear everyone
[1:35:58] say, "Amen."
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; I receive it.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; I receive it. And if it's received,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; If it's received, laid in seed form and
[1:36:09] spoke by the same thought, he said that
[1:36:11] materialize the Bible or brings things
[1:36:14] to pass.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; He said, and it he said an unveiling of
[1:36:18] God. Uh it's it's Elohim.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; it was Elohim, the eternal, but in him
[1:36:25] was thoughts and he wanted to become
[1:36:28] material. And what did he do? Then he
[1:36:31] spoke the word
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; and the word was materialized. And
[1:36:34] that's the whole picture from Genesis to
[1:36:37] Revelation. There's nothing wrong. It's
[1:36:40] Elohim materializing. And I say, "Oh
[1:36:43] God,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; almighty God,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; we've got a group of believers here
[1:36:48] tonight. More than two or three,
[1:36:50] materialize
[1:36:52] amongst us.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] In whatever fashion you desire to be,
[1:36:59] materialize.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:02] [Music]
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Let him hear. Let us hear him call our
[1:37:08] name.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; The books opened.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Hear the lamb calling.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; The words that we hear, the message we
[1:37:18] hear is the lamb calling. Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Not just some words on a tape or in a
[1:37:24] book,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; but as you read it, then the Holy Spirit
[1:37:27] comes
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; and you hear the lamb calling.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; You hear the great cry of the lion and
[1:37:35] he crying judgment and yet it's mercy.
[1:37:38] It's such a such an incredible time that
[1:37:42] you and I are living in. But God sent
[1:37:45] every one of us here. God sent that word
[1:37:48] to us in this generation. You're here.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; You're even a witness to it. You're
[1:37:53] sitting here in this service. You're
[1:37:55] here. You're part of this generation. I
[1:37:57] want to hear him say, "You that were
[1:37:59] with me,
[1:38:02] [Music]
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; this is what I'm going to give you."
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] I'm going to close
[1:38:21] and I'll just leave you with this
[1:38:23] thought
[1:38:24] as I thought it was very significant.
[1:38:28] You know, the the people, they heard God
[1:38:31] say, "And God said, and there was." And
[1:38:34] God said, "And there was." And God said,
[1:38:36] "Go up in the mountain and don't let
[1:38:38] anyone come near." And God spoke and
[1:38:40] they saw the mountain on fire and the
[1:38:42] horror of darkness come down and and the
[1:38:45] people became afrighted.
[1:38:48] And I want to say to you in this
[1:38:50] congregation,
[1:38:52] if God came, God could come so near that
[1:38:56] you that you would literally believe
[1:38:58] your next breath would take you out of
[1:38:59] this world.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that. Yes, sir.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in that presence,
[1:39:04] they said sometime they asked him, "Why
[1:39:07] don't you ask his name?" He said, "When
[1:39:09] you're in that presence, you don't say
[1:39:12] anything."
[1:39:15] I just heard I just read he was saying
[1:39:17] and he's talking to somebody and he's
[1:39:19] saying this trembling this trembling
[1:39:22] this shaking. He wasn't talking about
[1:39:24] them. I had to read on to find out he's
[1:39:26] talking about himself.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He was trembling and and quivering and
[1:39:30] shaking in the presence of that one that
[1:39:33] was there becoming weak speaking to
[1:39:35] them.
[1:39:37] Tell you friends, it's an incredible
[1:39:39] presence. this quad,
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; you're going to be in his divine
[1:39:42] presence.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; And we need to shed these old coats for
[1:39:46] that.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And when they saw this kind of God, he
[1:39:55] said, and it was, "Let there be and
[1:39:57] there was." They feared that. So they
[1:40:00] went to Moses and they said,
[1:40:04] "Ask him not to speak to us.
[1:40:07] Let him speak to you
[1:40:10] and you come and tell us what he said.
[1:40:13] And brother Bram said from that time.
[1:40:16] Now please catch just catch it as I
[1:40:18] close.
[1:40:21] The people saw it. Let there be and
[1:40:24] there was. Let there be and there was.
[1:40:25] Let there be.
[1:40:29] I tell you, you'd be impressed if God
[1:40:32] just took you up and allowed you to see
[1:40:34] and and know that the thought of the
[1:40:37] almighty divine one was going out from
[1:40:40] his being and you saw galaxies and stars
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; being birthed and the explosions in
[1:40:48] space and all these things. Even when we
[1:40:51] get the pictures, we are impressed.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; When we see the pictures, we're in awe.
[1:40:58] And that God would say to you,
[1:41:02] I'm calling you my son. I'm calling you
[1:41:04] my daughter.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I'm calling you as part of my family.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Then they said to Moses, tell him not to
[1:41:11] not to speak to us anymore. You speak.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram says from that time
[1:41:17] then he only spoke to the people through
[1:41:19] a prophet.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Let that be absorbed into your system
[1:41:25] tonight.
[1:41:27] I would be impressed
[1:41:30] in the presence of the almighty God.
[1:41:32] That God came and spoke through a man
[1:41:36] from that time on. And that is why in
[1:41:40] this generation we went for all those
[1:41:42] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:41:44] years. And there were times in the Old
[1:41:46] Testament, God let them go for several
[1:41:48] hundred years without a prophet. But
[1:41:50] then when the prophet began to come on
[1:41:52] the scene, he'd say, "Let there be." And
[1:41:54] there was. because it wasn't the man
[1:41:56] speaking, it was God speaking.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And friends,
[1:42:02] I don't think that we some may think I
[1:42:05] put too much emphasis
[1:42:07] on what this messenger said. I quite
[1:42:10] frankly, I don't think we can put enough
[1:42:12] on it. Amen.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; If that thought would even be in your
[1:42:23] mind, go home and before you go to bed,
[1:42:27] just listen to a prayerline tape.
[1:42:31] And when he speaks to one after the
[1:42:32] other, incidentally, that's not just
[1:42:35] going back to a first or second poll.
[1:42:37] That happens to be going back to the
[1:42:38] vindication. That's God vindicating. I'm
[1:42:41] vindicating. I'm proving I'm proving who
[1:42:44] this is. This is the proof. You're
[1:42:46] hearing the proof.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; When you hear it and when you're done
[1:42:49] with that, then you just say, "God sent
[1:42:52] him to tell me God sent him sent this
[1:42:56] mouth to call to speak a word that will
[1:43:00] bring forth and actually create the kind
[1:43:02] of nature, the kind of character
[1:43:06] speaking out from him is coming. The
[1:43:08] very cells of God coming out of this
[1:43:11] messenger is coming the cells that have
[1:43:13] the unit of hereditary with it. You mean
[1:43:17] I can actually hear this and receive
[1:43:19] right divine nature from almighty God?
[1:43:22] That's exactly right. It's man that
[1:43:24] spoke this.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Man spoke it, but it was God speaking.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Man was the tool.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That's what sets this church or the
[1:43:34] believers apart from everything else.
[1:43:37] Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; You have it available to you.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; It is absolutely yours.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what God thinks of you.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads in prayer.
[1:43:51] Father, we are indeed thankful.
[1:43:54] I'm so humbled.
[1:43:56] So humbled even to stand before this
[1:43:58] group of people tonight, Lord,
[1:44:01] and be allowed to declare things
[1:44:05] that are so staggering and so from a
[1:44:08] worldly position, unbelievable,
[1:44:11] but we have been made to believe. We're
[1:44:15] conquerors in Christ Jesus. Oh, we thank
[1:44:18] you, Father, for your eternal word that
[1:44:21] is forever settled in heaven. and we
[1:44:24] just want to bless your name tonight.
[1:44:28] Thank you that you have made us
[1:44:29] participants. You've made this available
[1:44:32] to us. And not only that, Lord, but we
[1:44:35] are able to be here tonight to partake
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; to eat of the body word of the Lord
[1:44:42] Jesus Christ. And we want to bless your
[1:44:44] name and give you praise and
[1:44:47] thanksgiving in Jesus Christ's name. I'd
[1:44:50] like everyone to stand if you would
[1:44:52] while we still continue to pray. And
[1:44:55] perhaps there may be some that you just
[1:44:57] want to be identified and say, "Father,
[1:45:01] I want to lift my hands to you. And I'm
[1:45:04] asking that you'll cause my soul to be
[1:45:09] able to grasp and to just revel in what
[1:45:12] you have, what you are speaking. Father,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; speak to my soul. Let me hear you, oh
[1:45:18] lamb of God.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Call forth this nature.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you that may be struggling with
[1:45:25] some weakness in your old nature, that
[1:45:28] old nature won't become stronger. Let it
[1:45:30] go. Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh God, bring me, I pray,
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; that I I covet and look after and hunger
[1:45:38] after, oh God, the divine nature
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; and cause me to feast on the promises of
[1:45:43] God,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; transforming power
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; into this vessel,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; oh God, I'll hang the old coat up,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; this only bearing the image, but let the
[1:45:54] new man, the inner man,
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; grow in the strength."
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How we thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:46:03] Your name we ask it. Amen.
[1:46:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that. We bless your name. We
[1:46:17] bless your name. We do that.
[1:46:22] [Music]
[1:46:32] We bless your name.
[1:46:38] I
[1:46:41] give you honor.

[1:46:54] the truth.
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:59] I bless your name.
[1:47:05] I bless your name. Let's just take a
[1:47:08] moment to praise his name again.

[1:47:16] I
[1:47:17] your name.
[1:47:21] I give you
[1:47:24] [Music]

[1:47:32] You are
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:37] the truth.
[1:47:43] I your name.
[1:47:48] I
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:52] worship.

[1:49:15] second verse says something about
[1:49:16] midnight. Well,
[1:49:19] how many here have trouble sleeping?
[1:49:22] Who wakes up at night and worries?
[1:49:26] Is that incredible?
[1:49:28] I do.
[1:49:30] I put up both hands
[1:49:34] and you can quote all the scripture you
[1:49:35] want but you just have trouble sleeping
[1:49:40] and small things become large and I keep
[1:49:42] telling myself
[1:49:45] laying here worrying about it won't make
[1:49:47] it any better just go to sleep you lay
[1:49:50] down
[1:49:54] doesn't work
[1:49:56] doesn't always work sometimes it works
[1:50:00] some midnight hour if you should find I
[1:50:04] sing this with all my heart because I
[1:50:06] have found that and yet the very things
[1:50:09] I can't preach anything different
[1:50:11] because what we're preaching is the
[1:50:13] truth of God's word and I just say that
[1:50:16] that nature of God I've got another I've
[1:50:19] got another gene
[1:50:22] and I want to focus on that nature of
[1:50:25] God of the new life.
[1:50:28] Hallelujah.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Some midnight hour.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:38] if I find
[1:50:44] you're in a prison, in a prison in your
[1:50:50] mind.
[1:50:59] And they
[1:51:04] and they will fall. They will fall in
[1:51:11] the name.
[1:51:14] I
[1:51:18] praise. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:51:23] [Music]
[1:51:36] Heat.
[1:51:39] Heat.
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:50] I bless your name.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; What do you think it did for people
[1:52:02] when he when he said, "Brother Pen would
[1:52:04] say, would it help you if I told you
[1:52:08] your name?"
[1:52:10] It helped him a whole lot.
[1:52:13] Just your earthly name because it put a
[1:52:16] connection. God knows who I am.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; God knows where I live. He knows exactly
[1:52:24] all about us. He knows the most minute
[1:52:27] thing.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; He knows all about your home, your
[1:52:30] family. He knows all about the finances.
[1:52:34] He knows all about all of these things.
[1:52:37] Does he care?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; I want to say, oh yes, he cares.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus cares.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; He knows all about it. And not only does
[1:52:45] he know about it, but if we could just
[1:52:48] grasp and exercise the faith, he will do
[1:52:52] the unexpected and do much more than we
[1:52:55] even thought he could do. I want to
[1:52:58] close this service with that cuz you may
[1:53:00] need a something in your life. You may
[1:53:02] need something a miracle of some kind or
[1:53:05] you may know someone that needs it and
[1:53:07] we want to hold out to him for that. I
[1:53:11] bless your name.
[1:53:14] Let's give him praise and glory now.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Let's praise him together.
[1:53:22] [Music]
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Give you honor.
[1:53:27] Give you praise.
[1:53:30] Give you praise.
[1:53:37] The truth.
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:53] Our loving Lord Jesus,
[1:53:56] I'm inviting your children, inviting
[1:53:58] these people, inviting others that may
[1:54:01] be in other places or other parts of the
[1:54:03] world, inviting them to now just take
[1:54:07] that measure of faith that you have
[1:54:09] given to them and to reach out, oh God,
[1:54:12] to you at this time, Father, for
[1:54:15] everyone that is here. Some with hands
[1:54:17] raised, with hearts raised, with needs
[1:54:20] bringing them up before you, oh God. And
[1:54:24] they know, they know with assurityity
[1:54:26] that yes, you do not only know, but you
[1:54:28] care. And you're prepared even now to
[1:54:31] reach down, oh God. Transform and bring
[1:54:34] change, oh God, where there needs to be
[1:54:36] brought change. I pray father in the
[1:54:39] name of Jesus Christ. You'll bring the
[1:54:41] curse upon the enemy. You suffered the
[1:54:44] curse at Calvary. Now let the enemy
[1:54:46] suffer his own curse in the name of
[1:54:49] Jesus Christ. Break those feathers. We
[1:54:52] defy them in the name the holy
[1:54:56] victorious righteous name of Jesus
[1:55:00] Christ. Oh yes, Jesus. Jesus. Glory to
[1:55:06] your name. Almighty one, mighty
[1:55:09] overcomer. Oh God, you're the conqueror.
[1:55:13] You raised even death couldn't hold you.
[1:55:16] Corruption couldn't set in. Oh father,
[1:55:19] now I pray for this congregation. We're
[1:55:21] in a corrupt generation. We're in a
[1:55:24] world that is sinking. Father in its
[1:55:26] darkness, in its terrible confusion, and
[1:55:30] in its sin. Oh, thank you, Father, that
[1:55:33] we can live above it.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll put such a strength
[1:55:36] within.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Every person that is here,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; every young person, every young man or
[1:55:42] woman, Lord, mothers and fathers, put
[1:55:46] something within us, I pray, a strength,
[1:55:49] oh God, and let us return, Father, on
[1:55:52] the Lord's day
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; with victories. Yes, Lord.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Victory is in our testimony.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Father, in Jesus
[1:56:00] Christ's name.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know who has tomorrow, but I
[1:56:09] know he holds it.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Going to dismiss
[1:56:14] you in Jesus Christ's name. Maybe we
[1:56:16] could just sing that little chorus. Many
[1:56:19] things about tomorrow I don't seem to
[1:56:21] understand. I like saying it quite often
[1:56:23] because
[1:56:25] none of us know about tomorrow.
[1:56:29] We're going to be in Murphy'sboro this
[1:56:30] coming weekend. Will you pray for us?
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; They're hearing from many, many places
[1:56:35] and brother Adam Moora is coming down
[1:56:38] and we're happy about that. Brother
[1:56:40] Milco, so they'll be able to tell about
[1:56:41] different places. Brother Murphy will be
[1:56:44] there as well and brother Tom and Joanne
[1:56:46] will return on on Friday. So you'll have
[1:56:50] a wonderful weekend. It's going to be
[1:56:52] baptismal. There's going to be four now
[1:56:55] baptized down in Seattle on Friday
[1:56:57] night. So anyone if you're able to go
[1:57:00] down, you wish to go down, be part of
[1:57:01] the service. Brother John is going down,
[1:57:03] can take the service down there and do
[1:57:05] the baptisms.
[1:57:07] So pray for us. Will you do that?
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, let's just sing it.
[1:57:12] Then we're going to be dismissed.
[1:57:23] I don't see
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:32] what I know. Yes, I know.
[1:57:41] And I know
[1:57:46] my hand.
[1:57:58] We praise you for Jesus. We praise you
[1:58:02] for Jesus.
[1:58:07] I know. Yes, I know.
[1:58:16] And I know
[1:58:21] my
[1:58:24] And I know
[1:58:28] he
[1:58:34] know.
[1:58:39] once more.
[1:58:42] And I know Yes, I know. He holds my
[1:58:48] hand.
[1:58:52] Praise his name. Yes, we do. Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] Greet one another. Shake hands with one
[1:59:00] another.
[1:59:01] [Music]
[1:59:04] God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus
[1:59:07] name.
[1:59:09] Hallelujah.
[1:59:11] [Music]
