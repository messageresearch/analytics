[0:47] that in disciples time he still have to
[0:51] walk a few steps to come to the boat of
[0:54] the front of the boat and to set it be
[0:58] still but here
[1:00] he said he just one move of your
[1:05] lips why because he's laid inside of
[1:11] you and all you need to do by faith to
[1:15] believe him said
[1:18] Jesus come to
[1:20] rescue Lord I want that Revival to
[1:24] happen in my

[2:03] called at any
[2:04] time not hard to our R but will come to
[2:09] our
[2:17] rescue Jesus as aov in himself is right
[2:21] in our boat too in this
[2:25] age let's see how he proved
[2:28] himself he said here is something here's
[2:31] a little girl sitting here on the front
[2:34] seat of just a child as soon as I spoke
[2:36] her name she started
[2:39] crying she said the little girl is
[2:41] seeking for something
[2:43] real her sister is a whipping behind her
[2:48] he said I don't know the child I never
[2:49] seen her in my life I said know of but
[2:52] she's a seeking the baptism of the Holy
[2:57] Ghost that is true is that right ELD
[2:59] girl
[3:00] that's right to raise up your little
[3:02] hand there you are she's not from here
[3:06] she's come from east of here she's a
[3:09] minister missionary's Daughter by the
[3:12] way her father is Desiring to see
[3:27] me it said it's the Father the Desiring
[3:30] to see me on a Christian he said I never
[3:33] see her in my life but that's exactly
[3:36] the truth don't fear honey you will
[3:40] receive the Holy
[3:45] Ghost he said your faith does it just
[3:51] believe he said
[3:54] remember she will receive the Holy
[3:57] Ghost she will receive
[4:01] it frankly is right by her right
[4:08] now what Christ has tried to
[4:11] do Jesus is in your
[4:15] boat if Jesus is that close to that
[4:18] little girl then the prophet said what's
[4:20] your desire he said I desire the baptism
[4:23] of the Holy
[4:25] Ghost if you're Desiring for the baptism
[4:28] of the Holy Ghost he's a still same
[4:30] yesterday today and
[4:32] forever and she said frankly is right by
[4:35] her right
[4:39] now and I'll say he right by you right
[4:43] now how to receive it by faith you
[4:46] receive it by faith you believe it she
[4:51] said that she's Supreme he said there's
[4:53] a lady sitting right here she's her
[4:55] praying for her husband also that's
[4:57] unsaved you believe was your heart is
[5:01] that you can receive what you ask for
[5:04] you're praying for your unsaved husband
[5:07] you're praying for unsaved wife you're
[5:09] praying for your unsaved children he
[5:12] that you can receive what you ask for
[5:15] what is Jesus try to do prove to you
[5:18] that he is right in your boat just by
[5:21] the move of your
[5:23] lips not me try to move your lips he
[5:27] tried to move your lips said Jesus you
[5:30] are in my boat that I believe what you
[5:33] have
[5:34] said and he said here a young
[5:38] woman sitting right back here in outside
[5:42] row she's got a female trouble you
[5:44] believe it was all your heart instead of
[5:47] you will be
[5:48] healed what Jesus tried to do not that
[5:52] the prophet tried to
[5:53] do but Christ tried to tell us he has
[5:58] been proved his in your boat when the
[6:01] prophet did all of that is to prove one
[6:04] thing he right in your boat the prophet
[6:09] coming is for you to let you look at it
[6:11] and to see through the prophet eye
[6:14] that's God's eye said I am in your boat
[6:18] it's so close to you just by the moving
[6:21] of your
[6:22] lips but you know
[6:25] what people fear it
[6:27] about the things that could rescue them
[6:31] but that's the thing that the people
[6:33] scared
[6:34] about we have to read through the true
[6:37] scripture this is the Jesus in the boat
[6:41] but on the other occasion Jesus walking
[6:44] to their
[6:45] boat and it was the
[6:48] disciples and when they're in the storm
[6:51] when they're roding their boat when they
[6:54] tried to get to their destination but it
[6:56] seemingly the destination become a
[6:58] farther and a farther away in a book of
[7:01] a John they said that they've been
[7:03] rowing the boat for almost an 8 hours
[7:06] and try to cross the lake that's only
[7:09] about 3 and a half a mile and because of
[7:12] the wind is are blowing the storm is
[7:14] just raising and they tried to use their
[7:17] own ability and they've been rowing
[7:19] they've been rowing they've been doing
[7:21] maybe the boat was a fi was in the water
[7:24] and the wind was the contrary and they
[7:26] try to blow them in under but then this
[7:29] time
[7:30] Jesus walk on the
[7:32] water Jesus walking for their rescue I
[7:37] was thinking why those disciples they
[7:39] don't remember this no matter Jesus is
[7:42] in the boat or Jesus walking through the
[7:44] boat Jesus still is the dynamic power
[7:48] and no matter how Wayward they might
[7:50] thinking no matter how that weak that
[7:53] the think no matter how the boat is
[7:55] seemingly to going to sink but that
[7:57] Dynamic power is walking to them the
[8:01] same Jesus can come to Sea the same
[8:04] Jesus can make their boat go to the
[8:08] destination they've be having a
[8:12] testimony but while they're having an
[8:14] testimon meeting on the sea the water
[8:16] start to come the wave is started to
[8:19] waving and I can imagine the bat is
[8:22] started to rocking and then the people
[8:24] they try to the disciple they do
[8:27] everything that they can but they find
[8:29] out their bat to start to just start to
[8:31] getting lower and the lower one of
[8:33] sinking into the water maybe they the
[8:36] bat to start to leaking the Water
[8:38] started to go in and then they try to
[8:41] use the bucket they try to use the thing
[8:43] to get the water out and I'll say
[8:46] sometime we're thinking our boat are
[8:50] leaking we're thinking our life started
[8:53] leaking we're thinking our pray life
[8:56] start to leaking we're thinking our
[8:58] family started leaking the world started
[9:02] sipping in the things started happening
[9:05] but don't worry the dynamic power still
[9:09] walking towards
[9:12] you and the Bible said he come onto them
[9:16] walking upon the
[9:19] sea Jesus walking on the same sea that
[9:23] they've been fighting with the wave was
[9:27] lifted it up they're fighting in with
[9:29] the wave but Jesus walking on that wave
[9:34] and Jesus walking to them if they see
[9:38] Jesus walking to them they should know
[9:40] no matter how big the waves are but the
[9:43] dynamic power is walking to me the wave
[9:48] might be high but Jesus walking on top
[9:50] of it the trial might be impossible to S
[9:54] but Jesus walking there why Jesus
[9:57] walking toward you Jesus walking toward
[10:00] of those the disciples and the scripture
[10:03] said and the would have passed by them
[10:08] Jesus looks like going to pass by them
[10:12] but Jesus will never pass by them he
[10:15] just look like he's passing by them when
[10:18] the disciples weing on the road and they
[10:21] M and there when Jesus was talking with
[10:24] them when they come into the as if Jesus
[10:27] want to go further want to go
[10:30] but he's just waiting for them to invite
[10:32] him to coming into the room and when
[10:35] Jesus walking on the water walking on
[10:38] the difficulty walking on the trial and
[10:40] walking on the Storm he's looking at
[10:42] he's passing you but he's not passing
[10:45] you he's only waiting for one thing come
[10:48] Jesus let a dynamic power coming in this
[10:52] sinking
[10:56] boat look like he's going to P them but
[10:59] it's only waiting for them to inviting
[11:02] him to come into the boat but you know
[11:05] what those disciples the things that
[11:08] come to rescue them but that's the the
[11:10] bo that's the thing they were afraid
[11:15] of but I'm so
[11:17] thankful there's one person though he
[11:21] was as afraid as he can be but this
[11:24] person also as bold as he can
[11:27] be and is name is a Peter when everybody
[11:32] else was feared about it Peter said to
[11:36] Lord if that's
[11:37] you let me do the same
[11:40] thing everybody said you are a spirit
[11:44] everybody said that's impossible but
[11:47] Lord if that's you let me walk onto you
[11:51] Lord I saw you walking toward me and I
[11:55] know you are that Dynamic power I know
[11:58] there's a re Revival possibility that in
[12:01] my life I saw you walking but I have
[12:04] been long lost that for so long I don't
[12:07] even know what Revival means I don't
[12:10] even know I don't even know what is the
[12:13] heart feeling religion really mean I've
[12:16] been hearing the mechanic I've been
[12:18] polishing the mechanic I don't even know
[12:20] what dyamic really is and everybody else
[12:24] said that's impossible for you to get
[12:27] but Peter said Lord I'm scared too but
[12:31] Lord though I'm scared but I saw you
[12:34] walking toward
[12:36] me I saw you walking toward me Lord if
[12:40] you have give me the message that shows
[12:42] that you walking toward me if you ever
[12:45] chosen me that shows you walking toward
[12:48] me if you ever elected me that shows you
[12:51] walking toward me Lord the storms are
[12:53] high though the waves are to high though
[12:56] the winds are blow but Lord if that's to
[12:58] you you chosen me if that's you elected
[13:02] in me if that you that healed me before
[13:05] if that's the you have saved me from The
[13:07] Trial now don't just let you come into
[13:11] to me but let me walk on the water let
[13:15] me walk to
[13:17] you when he started walking he was a
[13:20] stepping on the Storm he was over the
[13:23] trial it was a riding on the difficult
[13:26] it was a riding on the lukew
[13:29] but you know what when he keeps his eyes
[13:31] are looking he started thinking but he's
[13:35] a still believer and the Lord is the
[13:38] still Lord and that spirit that become
[13:42] so virtual so far away so
[13:46] intangible but that Spirit become a
[13:49] flesh and raise up a hand and pick up a
[13:53] Peter that his experience to be
[13:57] renewed now it's not him walking but
[14:00] Jesus walking with
[14:03] him is he in your trial in your storm
[14:07] it's seemingly every hope is gone but
[14:10] you make a
[14:12] move Lei prodical said I make a move I'm
[14:16] going to walking home I'm going to
[14:18] walking towards you that you walking
[14:21] even you fail but that spirit will not
[14:25] just a spirit anymore that spirit will
[14:28] become a physical will become a tangible
[14:31] will start ring his hand said to George
[14:33] I want to pick you up don't that out of
[14:36] condemnation condemn you anymore don't
[14:38] let an accusation the demon power try to
[14:41] overcome you now you walk with
[14:44] me let's walk back to that boat so that
[14:47] we can encourage other people that I'm
[14:50] not a spirit but I'm the same yesterday
[14:54] today and
[14:56] forever thinking about it that's the
[14:58] same Jesus
[15:00] Jus same
[15:02] Jesus still same robe still same
[15:06] physical but just because they walk on
[15:09] the water they never done before they
[15:12] afraid of
[15:14] him you maybe have some impossible
[15:17] situation you never walk home
[15:21] before it become a
[15:23] spirit but that's the same
[15:26] Jesus that's the same Jesus
[15:29] the people must say that's impossible
[15:31] for my situation but he's the same
[15:34] Jesus but this time he just walk on the
[15:37] things that had never done before but
[15:39] he's going to do that to you and they
[15:42] started walking on on the boat and he
[15:44] started walking with a Peter and Peter
[15:47] and Jesus they both walk under the
[15:50] boat and you know what when Jesus Come
[15:53] On A
[15:55] Boat Jesus never helped them to repair
[15:58] the boat
[16:00] Jesus never helped them to shuffle the
[16:02] water
[16:03] out Jesus never tried to solve the
[16:07] problem the Bible in the Book of John
[16:10] chapter 8 it said
[16:12] immediately immediately that boat landed
