You may be seated. want to welcome everyone this morning, all those that are visiting with us and uh I know brother Nathaniel's really happy to have his parents here from from uh Belgium and we're happy to have them as well. God bless you and uh happy to have you here. Um any others that are visiting with us, we uh really happy to have you here and those are listening in on the internet. Um I you know when you're away you just really appreciate how uh what the brothers have done and I just want to give a real thanks uh this morning to brother uh Darren Hoffman and other brothers that have uh helped um him put the uh take us up to another level on the on the video and uh they've got uh taken it up to 300 uh kilobits or whatever it is but uh it's uh tell It was nice sitting in the hotel Sunday morning and dialing in and seeing uh all your faces in a lot more clarity and uh not not blurry as it was before or as blurry as it was before. It was really wonderful and I really appreciate all the work that the brothers have done. Um, speaking about technology, uh, we have a couple of changes we want to announce and, uh, this shouldn't affect very many people, but if it does affect you, then find someone who is technologically literate and get them to help you, uh, into uh, the new century that we're in. Um, there's only one company in the world, excuse me, that is, uh, making cassette tapes any longer. So, we are moving from the old technology, uh, and leaving that behind. So, uh, as well, video tapes are being discontinued. So, we've discontinued making video tapes and audio cassettes. They're no longer going to be made. um it's really difficult to buy a cassette player anymore. So, um audio tapes are no longer going to be on loan out of the library. Um, and to take over from this, uh, MP3 CDs are now going to be available after every Sunday evening service, uh, for suggested donation of $2, but they will have Wednesday night service, Sunday morning, and Sunday night, an in MP3 on that CD if you want it. But having said that, it's way easier just to download it and doesn't cost us anything or it it cost us a lot less if you just get onto the internet and download whatever services it is you want to listen to. So, uh I know myself um downloading it, putting it on my iPod, and being able to listen to it on an airplane in a car is uh certainly a much better way to go. And I don't have to talk to anybody. I can just get on the internet and download it anytime uh I feel like it. So, we're going to post this up on the bulletin board, but uh if anybody is still in the old era, um you know, there are a number of very technologically literate who I know would be more than helpy. A lot of technologically literate people who would be more than help more than happy to help you. Sorry, having a hard time this morning. Must be the conversion to daylight savings time. Amen. Sister Marilyn has a song for us this morning. Sister Marilyn, why don't you come and uh uh while she's coming, let's sing uh let's sing your life. Love is life to me. my truest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Amen. Let's sing it together. Your love is life to me, my truest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is life to me. For your love is life to me. My truest longing, my deepest need. Without you one moment, I don't know where I'd be. Your love is life to me. Sing it again. Lord, your love is life to me. My trueest longing my deepest need. Without you know moment I don't know where I'd be. Cuz your love is life to me. [Music] I'm dedicating this song to my friend, Sister Marge Miller, who's streaming in this morning from the hospital. When I've surveyed all the good things that come to me from above. When I count all the blessings from the storehouse of his love, still I ask for one favor of him when I enter in. I'm sure he'll grant it again and again. I want to stroll over heaven with you some glad day when all the trles and heartaches have all vanished away. Then we'll enjoy all the beauty where all things are new. I want to stroll over heaven with you. So many places of beauty we long to see here below. But time and treasure have kept us from making plans to go. But on that morning of rapture together we'll surely be. It will be worth it when his face we see. I want to stroll over heaven with you. Some glad day when all the troubles and heartaches have all vanished away and we'll enjoy all the beauty where all things are new. I want to stroll over heaven with you. I want to stroll over heaven with you. Some glad day when all the troubles and heartaches are all vanished away and we'll enjoy all the beauty where all things are new.

We sense an atmosphere of the Holy of Angels energizing us, influencing us. As your prophet said, we can sense their presence. We sense the presence and holiness of our Lord Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. And oh God, as we have assembled today, not only with the visible audience, but assembled with all that are now with us, have joined with us in their places, in their countries, in their rooms, oh Lord, in their gatherings. And we have gathered that we might hear from you. We've gathered that we might worship you, Lord. We have gathered that we might affirm once again that we indeed desire to be your disciples. And as disciples, we wish to walk in your footsteps. Our Lord Jesus, when you were here, your movements were precisely the word of God in flesh, moving from place to place. We have come here Lord that we might be a real true genuine reflection of the word of God made manifest again in our time. Bless your people and I pray you'll bind every spirit oh God that would even seek to hinder in any way your children may every one that is present. I pray for them that they might be benefited, might be edified, lifted up, and may we be born upon the wings, oh God, of the eagle, and lifted up into the heavenlies. Father, I pray that you will touch each life, those that are especially in need of you, oh God. You know the heart, and now our hearts are open before you as an open book. I pray you'll minister to us each one. Anoint us. Anoint myself, Father, that I might be a living oracle of your word for you. And this entire day, oh God, and the service this evening, we dedicate it to you now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'll ask you to open your Bibles and we will turn directly to the word. I'm going to read out of Revelation the 21st chapter and we'll start reading at verse one down through verse 7. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. And I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And he said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." And he said unto me, "It is done. I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? He that overcomemeth, he that overcomemeth has a special place. He will inherit all things. All things. And I am speaking to you this morning on the home of the overcomer. Once again, home of the overcomer. Before you're seated, turn to chapter 22. And we'll just read two verses 14 and 15. Blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates uh into the city. For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoreongers, and murderers, and idoltors, and whosoever loveth, and maketh a lie, those are without, and cannot enter. God bless you as you have your seats. a prepared place for a prepared people. God is not going to prepare a place and have uh a group of people that weren't prepared. That's why we're here this morning. I didn't know the song that uh Marilyn was going to sing. I understood late yesterday afternoon she was going to sing and but she wouldn't tell us what she was going to say. And of course, I didn't tell her what I was going to preach on, but we'll walk over heaven &gt;&gt; together some sweet day. &gt;&gt; And you know, in this life, I believe that we need to have our focus. We need to have a a goal, a goal that needs to be before us all the time. And I think more so as we're living, if we if we become immersed in just all the events of the day and the things that are happening around us, it it gets it gets fairly dismal. But when you can continue to see the the goal and and the hope for which you are actually living here for, it's not a drudgery. We're not just, you know, uh, scraping by from one day to the next, from one day to the next. And when I say scraping by, I don't mean a financially as much as perhaps emotionally getting through and the pressure of the day and the pressure of the age. A lot of times we can come into a into the house of God and and become uh it it becomes as though the life here and the life outside are two different lives. And really that shouldn't be. We're just here to be strengthened and we're here to receive wisdom so that when we go out we continue with the same life only at a higher level and strengthened and that's what it's all about. So that's why we are here. I I don't believe that we can speak about that the other land and the life that we will and are enjoying now but will enjoy in its fullness. Uh I don't believe we can speak about it too much. I believe that we need to be reminded and we should allow and pray that the Holy Spirit will be able to quicken our minds so that we will see with greater clarity and with more reality what it is truly all about. And as we look into the face of Christ, as we look into the the uh uh promises that he has made, I go to prepare a place for you. You know, he didn't say that in on the sermon on the mount, but when the message part when his message was breaking forth and the multitudes were leaving him and he was making his way to the cross and to the Gethsemane, that is when he began to tell his disciples these wonderful things. I'm going to prepare a place for you. You know, those were precious words. And I'm sure that those those apostles did not forget those words. and they mean so very very much to us. I've been in the message of future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and my wife commented on my book is getting wore out but I I tell you what it's uh it just the pages may be getting wore out but what's written on them is just a greater reality all the time all the time as we see things and events moving in the way that they are. I would like to just go back and make some comments as we lay a bit of a foundation. We had a wonderful time. I enjoyed Wednesday night uh so much and uh even though it was more or less just foundational and the Lord willing, I probably will continue on with this uh at another at another service as well. But as we've been moving through this book uh this this message, and to me it's not a book, it's a message, the future home. I'm interested in the future home. I believe everybody should be from the youngest to the eldest that are here. We should be remembering. I want to draw your attention to uh this particular aspect and that is that God has made it so that uh at each stage of our I won't say our development but at each stage of of our existence he has made us with certain certain limitations and limitations in our surroundings and so on. And so for that purpose, I want to go back just a wee bit. It's a very wellestablished truth that we have come from an attribute of God. We have come from an attribute of God. However, the reason that we are here and the reason we are here as we are and we have a lot of limitations. I'm going to refer to that in a moment. But the reason we are here as we are is is in the divine purpose of God. We are here as we are this morning because God is what he is and he has us here the way we are in the condition that we are. We're in a physical body each one of us. We are made up of body and spirit and soul. God ordained that. There's no use becoming, you know, distressed or upset that we're made that way. We're made that way and we're made with certain uh idiosyncrasies. We're made with certain kind of uh an emotional makeup where even God never made a mistake in bringing us on down through the natural lineage. &gt;&gt; It was all in God's ordained plan. It's it it you say, well, you know, why do we why do I say it that way? Because so often Satan works on that human aspect. Oh, if I'd only been born this or if I'd only been something else or if I didn't have that or if I had this or if I had, you know, if I didn't have this thing to deal with or if I had that talent or if I and we envy someone else for the way they are. Oh, I wish I wasn't quiet. I wish I could express myself. I wish I was and the guy who does all the talking says, I wish I could shut up sometimes. and everybody wants to be something else. But if we can just finally say we are what we are by the grace of God, at least that's a starting point. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that we are what we're going to be, but we are what we are and then God can can continue to mold us and shape us. So now let's we came from the attribute. So we want to just refer back to God and some of these things are very fundamental for uh the most of you but remember we have a a continually uh maturing congregation. Young people are coming up and some of them need to hear these things perhaps for the first time or hear them again. Now the very name God which there are certain uh references that you are aware familiar with but we refer to him often as Elohim in the scriptures and uh and that refers to his attributes. Brother Brandham refers to God coming to Abraham when the three messengers came. Brother Brandham refers to him as Elohim and he manifested his attributes as certain attributes at that time. And in Genesis 1, it says, "And God created the heavens and the earth." Genesis 2, when man came on the scene in the physical form, then we have God as the Lord God or Jehovah. And this is the self-existent one. And Jehovah is made up of two words which means this the self-existent one that becomes or pointing that be that also uh let let me just read it here I the self-existent one and it's formed from another word that means to become to become something thus pointing to a continuous selfrevelation now That is that is the one we say we came from an attribute that was in God. So now we want to understand the very fundamental of that attribute is that God himself is made up. That is how he was. I won't say made up but his being that's the kind of being he is is one who is self-existent but also one who is self-revealing. And if we are made up of an attribute then that that very essence is within each one of us that is why we could say even in natural things for the if we see somebody and they don't have any they're just lethargic they have no desire to be anything no desire to achieve no desire to advance no desire we we think that's abnormal and it would be abnormal even physically ally if you have children and that child just has no ambition, doesn't want to em better themselves, doesn't want to learn anything, doesn't want to achieve, you say something's wrong with that child because it's just a normal thing that we believe in advancement, we believe in betterment, we believe in, you know, achieving things and that's the way we're made up. But spiritually, if anyone is here spiritually and we just say, "Oh, I'm just content where I am. I don't want to I don't want to advance anywhere." Then there's something wrong with us spiritually. Would you agree? I'm getting your thought. And so there is within everyone in fact is in some greater than others. There's just a driving force. There's an urge. There's a power. There's a zeal. You can name it whatever you want. You just want to be what God wants you to be. You want to grow. You want to mature. You want to be used of God. It's an everexpanding thing. It's within us. We want to be more like him. We want to speak. We want to have his nature. We want to have his character because that's the very essence of God himself. &gt;&gt; A self revelation. He wants to reveal himself and go and and and because you are an attribute of God, you have that essence, that character within you. That is one of I would say the main characteristics. Now, so the self-existent one who reveals himself. Now, brother Brandham makes some very powerful and glorious statements. He says now uh that God wanted to become material. He says in the future home God that he thought of himself as being human and that notice what he said. He thought of himself as because everything has to a we were a thought that thought became an attribute &gt;&gt; and it became a word. We're an attribute of God. And he thought of himself now as being human. And that that thought transmitted him down to be Jesus. &gt;&gt; You have to think about that for a while. He thought of himself, that great being filling all time and space, but he thought of himself as being human. And that thought transmitted him down to being Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; When God was speaking to Moses and Moses asked, he wanted to know more of him. He wanted to see his glory. He said, "Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see me and live." He was not permitted to see his face. And yet God wanted to be known. He he had certain things that uh he loved fatherhood. He was going to have a family. And so all of this is part of this process. And in the message identified Christ of all ages said in this great God Elohim was attributes. There was attributes in there to be God. See, in the beginning, he wasn't being worshiped because there was nothing to worship him. But there was an attribute in there to receive worship. &gt;&gt; So, he created angels and the angels began to worship him and he became God. Right? &gt;&gt; There is attributes in him to be a father, &gt;&gt; attributes to be a son, &gt;&gt; attributes to be a savior, &gt;&gt; and attributes to be a healer. That's just exactly the way brother Brandon puts it. All these attributes was in God. &gt;&gt; And if we've ever got eternal life, you were in God's attributes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you ever had eternal life. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was so marvelous. Uh I was thinking about naturally the whole world's focus is on uh this pope that has just passed away. Uh it's not our focus, but the world is very gripped in it. And I was just in the midst of this message and brother Brandham is bringing out how the difference between the priest uh theologian Pharisee and as knowledgeable and as intellectual as he was and as religious as he was and as careful as he was much more than I would say most of us here there we we we don't want to be encumbered with the kind of laws and restrictions they had I think of Rabbi Richmond has said several times and Gerson has said it as well 613 laws in the Old Testament that they keep and that would be very very difficult for the people of the Western world. 613 they're continually keeping some kind of a law. This Pharisee kept the law and he was uh he was an intellectual. Brother Brandham makes the comment in future home. Uh saying in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Talks about the three stages. It was an attribute. First uh was God that he thought of himself of being human and that transmitted him down to be Jesus. Now that's a quote I just made. And now he said, "If you'll ever be there, you were there with him then." &gt;&gt; For there's only one form of eternal life. There can't be two forms of eternal life. There's only one, and that's God. And you had to be a part of God at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. You didn't choose it. Not what you chose down here, but what he chose you. &gt;&gt; See, that's where he chose you. &gt;&gt; And that is something you have to have very clear in your mind. He and that it wasn't after you got birthed by a natural sexual birth into a family and into a home. And finally one day you heard the heard the gospel preached and then God chose you. That isn't where he chose you. It was back when he even thought of himself of having a family. &gt;&gt; And in his thoughts, he's thinking of having a family. And that is there then when he predestinated every son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Now, that's a tough one for a lot of people, but that's where he did it. And then the whole the whole uh economy of things began to unfold and people came onto the face of the earth and began to cover the face of the earth. But God had already predestinated in his mind and in his thought every last one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Now look at the priest." He said we find his uh he and he had drawn he had drawn uh uh some drawings on a on a blackboard and so he said and we find his priesthood at the bottom part here because he's referring to it and his back life back behind him his predestination back here here is sinful uh here's hell down here another place on his board now he said this little part here. He said it represents purity. He was a priest. He was an honorable man. That represented this. He also he said he had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest. But you see how he got it, how he got his goodness was with an intellectual learning. said, "Now this little woman, her first life here, she was a prostitute. She was all marred up, but a way down here was just a little bit of understanding. A way down here was just a little bit of understanding." And this was it. I know when the Messiah cometh, he will tell us all things. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The priest could lay it all out. &gt;&gt; The priest knew it. The priest was a good man. &gt;&gt; He had not broken a law. He had not committed adultery. He had not lived a life that would be sinful or disgraceful to his nation or his religion or his church or synagogue. He had not done that. He had he he he lived a very careful and precise life. But when the word was made manifest before him, his intellectual said it's Beloveub. &gt;&gt; Because and brother Brandham says why? Because his denomination said that &gt;&gt; and he was under that headship. So what they had told him is what he repeated. But within his realm of light living, he was a very very good man. But he when he saw the word manifest, he said that's Belub. Now the woman didn't have any that she didn't have that learning she didn't have that understand she didn't have those intellects her life was all marred all messed up just a terrible state of affairs and even worse now it had deteriorated she only knew one little thing I know when the Messiah comes &gt;&gt; I know when he comes he'll fix everything when he comes he'll tell me what it's all about &gt;&gt; and then when that line came told her, "You've had the one your husband you have now is not your husband. You've had five. That's right. But this one is not your husband, sir. I perceive you're a prophet." She was on her way. See, the priest perhaps perceived he was a prophet too in that second pull. But when he finally said, "I am he that speak to thee." And he says, and I thought this was so outstanding, the difference between the two of them was the difference between the two. The reason why one said it's Belobub and the other said it's Messiah. You couldn't get any further. One says that is prince of the devils and the other one said that is the Messiah, the anointed one of God himself. And the reason why they were so far apart is that when God thought within himself of having a family, he thought of her &gt;&gt; and she had representation. &gt;&gt; And he said the priest had no representation because he was never there in the thought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now we're talking about the plan a little bit. So you don't mind. I just kind of lay it out quietly without so much preaching it for the time being. The plan that God would become known by these attributes that would proceed from him and become his family and the faculty by which he would become known would be by revelation. All right. Now it would this was the plan that God who had this this the very nature the very essence of God is that he shall become known he shall increase in his revelation an everinccreasing revelation of him but I won't say the word revelation just yet he he was going to become known and but he chose the faculty by which he would become known and that would be not by a book, &gt;&gt; but by revelation. &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it, those of you that have been around many years, but others who have not, I've asked this question many times, and it's worth it's worth really pondering. Why didn't God have Adam write the book of Genesis rather than wait for centuries and have Moses right? Wouldn't Adam by our own thinking have a much better uh wouldn't it be much easier for him to tell exactly what happened in the garden and what the serpent did and how he came and how he approached his his bride and all of these things. Wouldn't it have been easier for him? You'd have thought so. But he but rather he does it by revelation and reveal to Moses all those things because revelation revelation is more accurate than what you see with the natural eye. Revelation can penetrate deeper than what you hear with your ear and pen and revelation can can make a reality within your soul much much clearer vision than your mind can think. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could ask why didn't Jesus when he called his disciples and he knew that apostle another another apostle by the name of Saul I have stood on the steps where they said that the that that Paul the apostle in Jerusalem was being taught by Galo and I can tell you that Jesus Christ walked walking in and and about Jerusalem had to walk past those steps many many times and may well may well I don't say that he did but may well have seen that group of people where where where apostle Paul was sitting at the feet of Galiel learning all of these things and Jesus allowing him to become stuffed full of doctrine and religion and learning the intricacies of all of the law Jesus allowing knowing that rather than teaching him lip to ear what he wanted him to hear, but rather he would meet him on the road to Damascus and say, "I'm Jesus." &gt;&gt; Why didn't Jesus walk up to him at those steps while he was being stuffed full of religion? Say, "I'm Jesus." He could have said it then, but he said it later and revealed to Apostle Paul. Paul said he received it by revelation. Why? because he could write by revelation more than what he could write from hearing it from the lip to the ear. &gt;&gt; We could say, why didn't Jesus tell John what he wanted to write for the book of Revelation rather than let him be isolated on the aisle of Patmas and there hear it I hear hear it in a in a different way through a different channel and wrote the book of Revelation which has held the world spellbound ever since. by revelation. Revelation that is the faculty and I can tell you there's there are people probably sitting here who understand mentally &gt;&gt; those things that have been taught in the message and but it has not become a revelation to them. And you say well how does a revelation come? By the spirit of God. It has to be something that comes from God. And then when it comes from God, it's so real to you. It doesn't matter what your friends do. It doesn't matter what they say. It doesn't matter how they act. That has nothing to do with it because you have not just a channel, but you have been taught by God on a onetoone basis. &gt;&gt; You have a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is the faculty by which God would become known is by revelation. It isn't even by by myself preaching here today. By the preaching of the gospel, people will be saved. That is true. But on the other hand, the Holy Spirit has to take what's being preached and bring it to you in a personal way, on a personal level. And when you catch it that way, that's why it's so important for people to come prepared to a service with our heart made ready. It's so important that the worship as we worship and our our spirits are quietened and we're made ready for the word of God. That's why it's so important that you are prayerful about coming to the house of God. say, "I'm coming to hear what I need to hear so that I can be I can be made uh more ready, more fit, more uh prepared for my life." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the agent that would cause revelation is the Holy Spirit. So number one, the very basic character or nature, the very name of God declares that he's a self-existent one who continuously reveals himself. Number two, his the faculty by which he has made himself known or will make himself known is by revelation, not by learning of the intellect. And number three, the agent who will cause the revelation is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember those three if you would please. Now, God, he I want I wish you're you're listening very very good, but I want to I just want to say this. I'll be making statements here. I want you to hang on to them because they'll have a they'll tie together and have a much deeper meaning when we get further on in the service. Now, brother Brandham says that God that sin never entered sin never originated on earth. He said it originated in heaven. Now, I'm just going to bring this out to you immediately because this is where we're going to. And yet there is a region within the heavenlies that sin cannot enter. Otherwise, it would be very confusing for me. I don't want to go to heaven where sin might come again. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in waiting through this life and fighting the battles and and and to live victorious to go someplace where sin might erupt again. &gt;&gt; And so this Bible is very very clear. That's why we read the scripture. There is a place where whorongers and murderers and dogs and the unclean can not enter. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The region where the angels were and the regions where Lucifer was, he he was able to rebel. He was able to declare war. He was able to rise up against God and have iniquity fill him and be cast out. And the region of the earth was open to him. He didn't go to Pluto or Mars or some other place. He was cast to the earth of all place. I wish he'd been cast into the sun, &gt;&gt; but he was cast to the earth. That also is part of the plan because this God who is ever increasingly unveiling himself and manifesting himself had attributes of being a savior. And so he said, "I'll let my enemy be a uh be a deceiver and I'll save them &gt;&gt; because my salvation is greater than his deception. &gt;&gt; My salvation is greater than his sin. My love is greater than his death. &gt;&gt; Though they would die in a physical, my love will raise them up in a resurrection. &gt;&gt; So he creating creating a Lucifer and allowing him the opportunity to rebel and to take with him a fallen host of angels. there was a a a region where that could happen. So I'm talking about places that have limitations and that could take place and it did take place and that's an integral part of the plan. Even today there is a place that you can't see. We are here in such a in such a limited way. You know, we can only see so much. We can only hear so much. We have the five senses which the prophet said we have them to contact this earthly world, this life. That's what we have them for. I'll I'll come back to that in a few moments. But even today, Satan can accuse you and does so before God. &gt;&gt; You don't see him. You don't hear him. But I I I assure you it is happening even this morning. He stands there and in Revelation 12:10, "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accuse them before God day and night." &gt;&gt; Amen. In a future home, prophet said, "Both the heavens and the earth now is contaminated with devils &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God &gt;&gt; right now. That is why the heavens are going to be on fire &gt;&gt; and the accuser is going to be done away with. &gt;&gt; They can accuse us before God." He said, "But Jesus is there. I can't see it. &gt;&gt; My human faculties don't enable me to see it or to hear it. &gt;&gt; But the scriptures telling me that prophet is telling me that he's there and there's accusations coming against you. &gt;&gt; Accusations. The accuser is accusing us before God. But Jesus is there &gt;&gt; in that realm also. And Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; But it's not limited to this. But we're limited to this. But he's not. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; I wish you could believe that. &gt;&gt; And he's there. And Satan is accusing you. And Jesus is there. And he says further, he intercedes for us. There's still a warfare going on and there's fingers being pointed and Satan is accusing you because he is that's his basic nature as an accuser and when you see it come down here then you know exactly where it originated and but Jesus is there interceding and he goes on to say while the accusers keep pointing a finger he said they did this, they did this, they did this, but the blood still covers. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem the elected that he foresaw. Now, God wanted to become material. Is it all right if I preach slowly? God wanted to become material. His objective was to become known in the unveiling of God. But in him was thoughts and he wanted to become material. See, I didn't just take one quote. And you'll see how this is so uh so fits your situation, our present life. He says then he spoke a word and the word was materialized and the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation said there's nothing wrong it's Elohim. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the language that brother Brandham used is absolutely precision. &gt;&gt; Even how he interchanged whether it was God or Elohim because it it he said it was God. All right. But it was Elohim because Elohim speaks of his attributes. &gt;&gt; It was Elohim materializing so he can be touched. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feel &gt;&gt; and in the millennium there's Elohim &gt;&gt; sitting on the throne with all of his subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world. You see the complete circle. There was God who was not God but the great being who would become God because in his thoughts he was going to have he was going to have worship and so he created those beings that would worship now in all and then he wanted to become material himself. He wanted to be so he could be uh felt and so he could be uh touched. And then this and then he goes on to say, "And in the millennium, there's Elohim with all of his subjects. It's gone through a whole cycle now." And there they are around his throne. That's what he had in his mind. And all this process going continual, continual, and all this warfare that took place and all of this sin and all of this uh world that we have right now. And it comes to a conclusion. And he has them those that he predestinated before the foundation of the world. The apostle John said of Jesus and we will say the apostle John is saying of that attribute of God that God projected down and he thought that he he would become human. So he transmitted that down to earth. This is what John said of him. that which was from the beginning which we have heard. Now I want you to focus on the senses, the human senses that God has given us. Five senses of the body and the five senses of the spirit that we hear, we see, we taste, we smell, and we feel. And Apostle John says, "Now you see God from the beginning. He thought of himself as being human. And so he transmitted himself down and became Jesus." When Jesus was here, one of his apostles said, "That which was from the beginning which we have heard." Because God gave the faculty of hearing to the human. And John says, "We heard him which we have seen. We saw him with our eye and which we looked upon." And he said, "And our hands have handled him. &gt;&gt; We saw him. We heard him. We handled him. We felt him. For the life was manifested, and we have seen it. and we bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was from the father and was manifested unto us. Now say okay that's why he was transmitted down. Why did we come? Well, brother Brown tells you why you come. You become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted. That's his statement. You become from the attribute to this flesh to be tempted. That should make you rejoice. Praise God. I came to be tempted right from the very attribute God transmitted you down to be tempted. This too is a part of God's plan. &gt;&gt; We were brought forth with senses of the body and the spirit. Each realm having its own limitations. I want you to think about those limitations for a moment. God brought us down into this realm and uh we have we have certain limitations. There's only so much that I can feel. There's only so much pain I can experience. When it reaches a certain level, I'll perhaps start passing out. There's only so much I can see. I can only see a certain distance. And it all has limitations. And mentally we have limitations. Uh and some have much more capacity mentally than another emotionally. Some can take a lot and some can hardly take anything. They don't have the same capacity. Some run into a little something and oh just just they start going to pieces. Next person can't understand it at all. They just keep plowing ahead going on going on. Doesn't mean it's limitless. They might reach their limit too. But we we are our bodies and our spirits have limitations. &gt;&gt; And God put us allowed us to come in this form to be tempted. And let me tell you, there isn't a person in this auditorium that isn't going to be tempted, isn't going to be tested to the very limits, one way or another. Because God is proving himself, and he's proving this attribute. Jesus was tempted in all points like we and yet without sin. And God is allowing, he allowed Job to be tempted to the very limits. And you would have thought he would have broke, but he didn't break. And God is going to allow the bride to be tempted to the very limit. He'll allow every kind of doctrine. He'll allow every kind of belief. He'll allow every wind. He'll allow every pressure. He'll allow every trial to prove that his bride is going to be victorious cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; It's going to prove it. &gt;&gt; Going to prove that this message that the world hates is the very thing that's going to give the body of Christ strength in this hour. Now, and who's this Melzdc? And I know it's hard when I read for you to just perhaps follow, but that's why I like to go a little slowly. He said, "Now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body. So we're in one form have not yet entered not yet entered into the word form body but a theophony. He said this body this body is subject to the word and waiting for the earnest of the change the change of the body. Now he said now the difference to bring a difference between us and Christ. The difference between him and you as a son he was at the beginning the word an amorph body. He came in and lived in that in the person of Melzdc. &gt;&gt; We never had no more Melzdc because he became Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Melzdc was the priest but he became Jesus Christ. And now you bypass that. &gt;&gt; So we got to come back to something we bypassed. &gt;&gt; You bypassed that because in that form it's another form. He knowed all things. In this form we don't know all things but in that form he knew all things and you and I have this in red so it it'll be I can emphasize it and you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me, you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted. He says it again. We We've never been in that form yet. &gt;&gt; We're going places, friends. &gt;&gt; We're going someplace. The unbeliever is not going there. The critic is not going there. The doubting and fearful is not going there. The believer is going there. Is this all right &gt;&gt; if I preach like this this morning? But but when life here is finished, if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting. That's where we go. My point this morning is we are going to a place that doesn't have the restrictions that we have right now. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have those limitations. We're moving towards that. And then he says then we can look back and see what we done. Now we don't understand it. We have never become the word. We've just become the flesh man, not the word. That's what he's saying. That doesn't take away from the fact he says that the word has become flesh in us. We're talking about this realm that we're in and the limitations that it has. Now, God gave us these five senses which I won't dwell on much much, but he gave us these five senses which he says was to contact this world. But he says, "But then your inward man is the spirit which has two senses which is faith and unbelief." In the message shalom says, "If you're blind, you can't see. Then you can feel one another or hear one another." And the earthly senses declare one another. So if I was blind, I couldn't see you, but I could feel you. And that earthly sense would declare something to me to declare that you are there. I might not be able to see you, might not be able to be very specific about your features, but I've lost sight. But I have a sense that will make a declaration to me. Here's a person. Here's an individual. But in this age that we're in and to me now, two things are coming together here. And that is the day. This day that you have been called to live in my friend, my brother, my sister, is so vastly different from any other age. This was the age that that if you go into the countdown and the message if you see for just a moment how this age would be rise higher and higher we can say in its industrialization or in its technology in its advancement but just as it has advanced I'm sure you'll agree with me as it's advanced the advancements have in so that they appeal to the flesh man, &gt;&gt; to the senses, &gt;&gt; you know, those of you that fly, you fly a lot here at the Vancouver airport, when you get your ticket and get your boarding pass and they have to go down, if you're going international, you have to go through immigration. You know where they send you? They send you through the dutyfree. &gt;&gt; I can tell that I'm coming to the duty-free long before I get there. Do you know why? It just has all kinds of marvelous odors that are coming out. It's all the latest perfumes. And you know, they have such seductive names to those perfumes. passion, you know, all these names of Why is that? Because it's tantalizing. It's appealing to the sense of the smell and you smell it long before you get there. They try to make it, oh, this will be so enticing. And you just put and you know I'm almost ashamed of myself but uh sometime I put on some shaving lotion. So sometimes I don't but I'll go and and so they say what kind do you want? I don't know what kind I want. I want some shaving lotion and they have some is just so powerful I don't like a be smelling it all day long. Get sick of that. I want something that's a little bit lighter than that. Okay, smell this. Okay, put that down. Smell this. Pretty soon they all smell the same. Well, let me smell that other one for a time. I was here here some time ago says, "Well, here let's let's just do this." And she was doing something. I said, "What does that do?" She says, "It kills all the smells because it kills all the smells. You can start all over again." Oh, boy. And says, "What kind of civilization am I in? Smell this one. Give it to my wife. You smell it. I know it's it's a little bit humorous. It happens to be our world. Has to be our world. Taste this. Oh, come on. Some of you folks I've eaten with you. Where are we go? Oh, we should go. Brother Rod Bergen knows all the best places. Whenever I want taste, I call Brother Rod. Where do we go? Oh, there's a place I know right now he's already tasting it. Oh, get this. Get this. It's got just a hint of curry. It's got a hint of this. It's got a hint of something else. Cuz we're all that way. We all think about it, you know, about what it tastes like and what it smells like and what it looks like. And we go to the market and everything's dazzling, you know, and all the colors and a new color and a new this and a new that just in this age. Oh, we could say, well, many, many centuries ago, you know, they had all the lovely fabrics of Egypt and all of these things. That is true. But in this age, the sounds and the sounds mixed with the lights and the beat. Oh, getting it all just exactly homogenized just right. And so what you're seeing and what you're hearing and and the whole atmosphere, what it's trying to do is to get an entrance to your spirit, get an entrance to to involve you. to captivate you &gt;&gt; to capture your mind and capture your thoughts. It could only be in this age and so that so that people then and then they began to get it with things that you could taste and you could get into the drug scene and the drug scene would do something with your mind and then you could see and you were so sensitized. I won't say you were but that is the age that we're in. So sensitized that they begin to drift off into another realm. that wasn't real. &gt;&gt; And finally, we had the whole drug culture that don't want the real. &gt;&gt; Let me just live up here in Lulu land someplace. I don't want the reality. I don't want the responsibilities. I, you know, and they get off into something that was unreal. But it was in this age that God, Satan had his had developed his Eden to such a place. But God, he's not going to be behind in the astronaut age. And he would send a messenger that would start to tell the people, you're locked into five senses. You got five senses to contact this world. But I'm going to tell you about a sixth one. I'm going to tell you about a sixth one that you have access to. I'm going to tell you about a sixth one that you don't feel, but it is here. I'm going to tell you about another dimension that you're not in, but you can tap into it, and it's a real one. I'm going to tell you about a dimension you can reach into by faith and bring a power out of there and heal your body &gt;&gt; and deliver you from the situation that you're in. I'm going to tell you about another one and you're going to rise up &gt;&gt; in a high place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're going to come in contact with the unseen world. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? going to tell you about senses that go beyond your five. And he did. &gt;&gt; Many are in this message that have never reached into it. But you need to. It's available to you. Don't live below your right. Don't live below the place that God has because that's just a stepping stone to go to the one that he has fully prepared for you. And I believe it's ready. &gt;&gt; I believe it's completed. I believe the only thing that's missing is the bride of Jesus Christ. That's what's missing. I believe the hosts of heavenly beings that are there are in anticipation perhaps even more than we are waiting for this group. Oh, when this redeemed group, imagine the angels talking to one another. Just think when we're going to see the redeemed, the redeemed of all the ages come through those gates of pearl. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, they're going to say, "We're going to see people that were born in sin. We're going to see people that Lucifer that Lucifer had under his control." And and our Lord Jesus, hallelujah, our God who created us delivered them. We're getting ready for the delivered people. &gt;&gt; We're getting ready for the resurrected people. &gt;&gt; That death swallowed up. &gt;&gt; We're getting ready to see resurrected bodies that were reduced to ashes and those that were burned at the stake. We're getting ready to see those atoms being called back by the great creator. My brother, my sister, if this is just a myth, we should shut the doors and go home and eat, drink, and be merry. But if this is a place you're going to, that's something you want to see and hold in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's age of heightened senses, an age of enchanted enchantment. It's also in the age where we're so susceptible. I feel I feel sorry a lot of times for young people and young couples and so on. The pressure of this age is so great and they make things to look so beautiful, so marvelous that they are, I can say, almost almost irresistible. And they say, "You can have this now. You don't have to pay for it. You don't have to put a penny down. We won't charge you any interest for a year." I marvel at those signs, too. I wonder how do they know in a year it's not in the Salvation Army. And I also marvel at some of the stuff would even last a year. But it's no wonder people, you know, just lay their cards on the line. If you put your cards down, you can get anything. You don't have any cards. You don't know what they are, credit card, Master, Visa, American Express. Got them all. Say, "Well, we won't take that one." Okay, I'll give you another one. Sorry, this comes up unauthorized. Okay, don't worry about that. Here, try this one. I can see some of you folks have experienced that. &gt;&gt; That's just life. &gt;&gt; Do you know when I started out working in the dark ages? We never even had one of these. Never saw one of these. I got a little we envelope about this big and it was a little bit of cash in there. Very little. I was paid good money but very little of it. is my father-in-law who later become my father-in-law. Some people think I was lucky to marry his daughter after what he paid me. It was amazing that I married her. Really? Anyway, I thought maybe that's the best way to get a raise. Didn't work. So anyway, we've been slugging it along, but that's that's what we have. We're we're faced with it. And it's not going to get less. &gt;&gt; It's going to get e even more so because that's the age that we're in. And it'll be an age and we'll find ourselves under that kind of pressure. That's what brother Brandon was talking about in the church ages. That's the pressure of this age to to be able to hold the line to live within our means to not be so encumbered so that we it starts to affect our spiritual life. And so this what this what we have to watch for you you you know I'll just tell you what you know uh I just say bit about these credit cards you know people get a little quiet on that. They're they're all right. But I tell you what, I found a lot of people in trouble over them. Say they start getting tens of thousands of dollars and they don't realize. They say, "Well, you know, I'm only paying 12% or 13 or 15%, but that's after you paid tax." Maybe you paid 30% tax and 15% there. It's 45% before you paid anything. And that's just a enormous enormous amount of thing. I'm not here giving financial advice because that's not my place. But that's the age that we're in. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the angels are going to rejoice. Say, "Here they come." Well, I want to get on with my message because I just about said something. It would be one of my thunder thunderbolts at the end. part and parcel of this declaration, the declaration I refer to in this consummation of the ages, we have a prophet messenger of Revelation 10:7. But let me say this, Revelation 10:7 would have nothing to say if Revelation 10:1 didn't descend first. If he didn't descend with an open book, Revelation 10:7 has no message. And so what was in the contents of the book? Listen now. This was Christ who fought this great warfare and defeated Lucifer. Lucifer is cast out. He does his job. Brings us to the age that we're in. I'm just taking quantum leaps now. And then Christ himself comes to those elected that were in the mind of God. this attribute, these attributes which are here. And he comes to begin to what shall I say not entice but to super heighten their expectations to give them an anticipation and to make it so real to bring it so close to speak of the rapture and to speak of the change and to speak of the resurrection. You know something? I've never heard I've heard messages since I've been a boy. I've never heard anybody speak of the resurrection the way Brother Brandham brought it up. I've never heard anybody speak of the change of the body the way he brought it. I never heard anybody speak about he'll call the Adams back. Never heard anybody say there'll just be a sweep that'll go over you. Never heard why are those things being spoken now? Why are they being declared now? Because this was the hour. This was the time. And you are the people. &gt;&gt; He's allowed you brought you to this place. You're the people that this is for &gt;&gt; to let you know you've been brought here into this. You've been brought here under the restriction of these five senses of the spirit and five senses of the body. But but he he brought you here and and God in the end time begins to open your understanding to another realm, another spirit. And it's something that it's not spiritualism, but brother Brandham says you anybody like that be called a mystic because you're it's not as though you're venturing into something that you're not supposed to. In the Old Testament, they weren't supposed to go to wizards and go to those kind of fortune tellers and things. We don't believe in it. We don't believe in it. Maybe Satan can inspire somebody. That has nothing to do with us. And that's why they called brother Brandham, they called him mind readading. And then he pointed back to Jesus knew their thoughts. &gt;&gt; You see, so it just depends what depends what category you're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. My oh my, how the time is slipping away on us in the message. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like you to notice, let's just talk about 107 for a moment. Notice what brother Brandham declares in the presence of the resurrected Christ. Now, could you believe for a moment? Now, I want to really pin this down because there may be some that really question about it. If a man stands here, and my physical senses says he's a man about 5'9, maybe 145, 150 lbs. His name is William Brandom. He's standing there and he says that there's a a light. It's the same light that was in the burning bush. And he says, "He who you see in this picture," there's the one with the not the cloud but the halo taken in the Sam Houston auditorium. At the day, now listen to his declaration. At the day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts are disclosed, you'll see that this is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not standing two feet from where I am right now. &gt;&gt; And I wish you could feel or know once the sense that sixth sense. Oh brother, sister, he's not standing a man born with five senses of the body and five of the spirit but built in a certain way. So the subconscious and the conscious come right together and doesn't go to sleep for this for this dream. It wasn't a dream. It was a vision standing right there saying he's about 2 ft from me now 24 in. And he's saying I wish you could feel. I wish you could feel. There is a feeling but the bodies we didn't have the capacity for it. But he is alerting us. We're being sensitized. We're being encouraged. We're being brought to an understanding. Something's happening in our minds. Oh, God. I would have known this before, but now I'm being told by a man that he's not two feet. There's another realm. He's calling it a sixth dimension or six sense. Oh, God. Oh, God. I I seek the Holy Spirit. I seek that the spirit of God will give me that that ability. Let my faith reach out at least I believe it. &gt;&gt; I can't see you with these eyes, with this limitation, but I believe you're right there. Oh, let me just reach through and touch you. &gt;&gt; Let something within my heart, something within my soul reach through and touch you. I know that you're right there. My brother, sister, that's where things start to happen in a church even this morning. That's where things start to happen when people say, "I believe what the pastor's saying. I believe it with all my soul. I believe that you are right here. My mind can't grasp it. My hands can't handle you the way Apostle John said, but I know that you're right here. And he says that six sense when you're breaking from one into another from one dimension from one category into another and you know the feeling now here here brother Brandham is entering into another realm of feeling and his feeling was absolute assurance of his resurrection. Oh, there was he was beyond any question. He was beyond anybody to raise a doubt. He was beyond any intellect. Beyond any any under religious denomination or there wasn't wouldn't be a theologian in the world that could cause him to doubt because at that moment there was a feeling coming within him and he said it was a feeling of assurance. of the resurrection. You see friends that what made him so absolute with his declaration and I like you to know of the resurrection and his power everything becomes little to you then his his glorious wonderful magnificent lovely Lord Jesus Christ praise notice what he's saying in his presence the feeling of assurance has come I wish you could see I wish you could feel what I'm feeling right now. There is a six sense. &gt;&gt; I say, oh God, I I glorify and praise your name for Elijah prophet that came and stood and made us to know these things. And though I have never seen it, I I believe it. &gt;&gt; And perhaps I have never felt it like he was feeling it right then, but I believe in it. And by believing in it, perhaps I can taste it also and feel it. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Everything becomes little. His glorious, wonderful, magnificent, lovely Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be unto him now and forever. The rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley, the morning star, the fairest of 10,000. He is the one. Notice what he's saying to him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand's not talking to the crowd now. He's talking to him. &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, I hope the Holy Spirit comes and even allows you to feel what I'm feeling, a sense of his presence, because I've been standing here declaring in front of you, I believe it. How many believe it? &gt;&gt; You declare you believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it is him. The lovely Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; the rose of Sharon, &gt;&gt; the fairest of 10,000. [Music] Hallelujah. Worthy of all praise. The magnificent one, the resurrected Christ. There's an assurance that comes into the heart. An assurance we know that he raised from the dead. and we know he's present. And in that atmosphere, he went on to say this with the one standing right there, not 24 in away. All other religions are bogus. &gt;&gt; All other religions are false. &gt;&gt; Only Jesus Christ has the right and he is the son of the living God. [Applause] And then you ought to hear what happens after that. &gt;&gt; Right in the presence of that one, the lovely one, the fairest of 10,000, the rose of Sharon. How beautiful, how lovely. And all other religions are bogus. &gt;&gt; All other religions are false. And here he comes and then unveils the secret of the heart. Who's speaking? that pillar of fire speaking through that human vessel. &gt;&gt; I hope you don't have any question about that, friends. I hope you have no question about that. God's messenger in constant contact with another dimension, another world. This service be a little bit different. be something for you to go home and think about. God is raising raising the level of our our our understanding. He's sharpening and honing our senses, our God-given ability to reach beyond the boundaries of this mortal life. There is a six sense that the believer is able to contact &gt;&gt; and to move into the realm of the supernatural. Now just to just to bring this to you and I'm going to close soon just to bring this to you in a very he said there is six senses but he said five senses really but faith makes the six sense and we live now in here what we will call the three dimensions. We know there's another dimension which is the fourth dimension because because science has probed have probed into it and found it and that fourth science is that fourth dimension is the sound waves and the radio and the television and access to that says it was here when Elijah was here. It was here when Moses was here. It was here. It's been here when Jesus was here. But science had not probed into it and not had and had not got into it yet. But he said they've probed into it and found it. He said and it's radio at that time. He says there there's no senses of our body. I'm going to go very careful. I'm not reading a quote. There's no senses of our body can detect radio or television over the ether wave. Yet listen now. Yet through us now is coming people's voices. &gt;&gt; Not through the building only. He says that other places but through you &gt;&gt; penetrating. Your body can't stop those kind of waves through you is going voices passing straight through you. Somebody on the other side pick it up. Say I don't know. Well, I do. That's exactly what he said. Think about that. Now, you have a limitation. You say, "I'd like to catch that. You haven't got the facility." But he says, "Science." Now, science science produced a crystal. Science produced a radio. Science produced an antenna. Science produced a tube and that catches that wave that even penetrates you and goes through you. And that's not just the place he said it. Right through here is coming television pictures. But we have nothing in us. No way at all to contact that in ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. talking about in us now, not out here someplace. Says it's passing straight through here. It's passing through you. But you don't have anything in you to catch that voice or that sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have anything in us. We can't catch that picture. It takes a crystal or some sort, a magnet to contact that. But it speaks that there is another dimension. It is only speaking that there is another dimension. &gt;&gt; And now that's four dimensions. I think in the fifth dimension is where the sinner goes. &gt;&gt; I'm just starting my service. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to keep you all that time, but I just we'll give give you an idea where we're going to go. Even the fourth dimension, it may pass through you, but you can't catch it because God in this life, in this mortal realm, has given you no ability to lay hold of it. And yet science has given that and you can go home and turn that radio on and it will pick it up and it doesn't startle you. It would have blown the minds of the earlier early saints. &gt;&gt; It would have shocked them. It would have scared them. Said what kind of magic is this voices? Where is it coming from? And if you tried to tell them this is coming from the other side of the globe said what what kind of thing is this? But now the prophet is saying he's brought all that in. Science has brought that. But there is another dimension. There is another one. You're not surprised there's radio waves here. You're not surprised there's television pictures going through here, that there's colors going through here, that there's voices going through here, and the prophet says bodies, &gt;&gt; images are going through here right now. You have no facility to contact it, to stop it, or anything else. And some of them we wouldn't want to stop. &gt;&gt; Let them keep on going. Let them go to their destination. But the prophet is saying there is another dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And science can't catch it. &gt;&gt; It can't catch it. It's a sixth dimension. It's a sixth realm. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you as we close says there's a fifth one. An unbeliever, the doubter, and the critic go to that one. They that make and love a lie, they can't enter. There's a realm they can't enter like we can't enter that where the voices are going through. We can't enter no matter how much you desire. You could fast, you could pray, you could do everything. You can't enter that fourth dimension. It hasn't been made for you. But and the fifth one you don't want to enter. And there are many. And the prophet says they are caught. &gt;&gt; He described it as a nightmare. &gt;&gt; He's he's in between. &gt;&gt; Amen. He he can't go back to life and there's no blood for him to go into the presence of God. And he's caught in the nightmare. And the encyclopedia says he's swallowed up &gt;&gt; into oppression. He's swallowed up into a terrible place in a nightmare and he can't wake up. And the prophet says they're caught in a nightmare. I know every funeral you go to, the preacher puts them in heaven, but most of cases they're a liar. &gt;&gt; He's not going to heaven. &gt;&gt; The Pope just passed away. I can assure you and they read they read John the 14th chapter. I can assure you this place that our blessed Lord Jesus made for the righteous and the redeemed. He's giving answer today perhaps for the multitudes and the millions that have perished &gt;&gt; under their cruel rule and under the lies of their system and their tradition. Oh, I tell you, they took the ring off his finger, call it the fisherman's ring. There's no such a thing. Peter never had a ring like that at all. He knew nothing about all that punk, all that tradition, all of that nonsense, all of that bondage, all of that fear. Thank God for deliverance. &gt;&gt; And he's caught. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the what our prime minister, the president, or the other kings of queens of the world say about his greatness and being the apostle of peace. I tell you, my brother, that was for a purpose. He journeyed indeed. He journeyed 3/4 of a million miles to bring people under the skirts of Rome. &gt;&gt; But there is a place &gt;&gt; and today he's caught &gt;&gt; in a nightmare. And every unbeliever will be caught in that nightmare. I plead with you. I intercede on your behalf. Whatever you do, if you've questioned it, don't you get caught. You hear, brother Biscll, today, don't get caught in that place where you can't go back to life because you've lived it out and you can't go into the presence of God because you have you have denied and disbelieved the word which he sent. But there is a land. &gt;&gt; There's a landlord &gt;&gt; and there's a place &gt;&gt; and there's many mansions. There's a body. There's a place that doesn't isn't restricted to these five senses. &gt;&gt; And I say run run for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Run for that place with everything that's in you. Don't let anything of this life hold you back or hinder you or restrict you. or deter you. &gt;&gt; It brings me almost makes me distraught when I think there's people that I've preached to, people I poured my soul out to and sit and become unmoved and won't let the Holy Ghost move them forward and make a confession out of their mouth. I need God in my life. I need a transformation. &gt;&gt; Don't get caught. &gt;&gt; You're moving through this life all too quickly. very very quickly. Young old were moving very very quickly, very quickly. And when the Christian dies, he goes into a sixth dimension. And to break it down, when a man has a nightmare, he's not altogether asleep, and neither is he awake. He's between sleep and awake. And that what may when I wake up that glorious realm or when by the change of this body we enter that glorious realm in this rapture. Just think he's caught in a nightmare. Let me close quickly. I have so much Jesus told and Jehovah's Witness tried to tell you it's a parable. It doesn't matter if it is a parable. Jesus said there was a certain rich man &gt;&gt; and there was a beggar and his name was Lazarus. That's why it's not a parable. He named the man. It was Lazarus. And he laid at the rich man's gate. And the rich man, he had feeling. He was dressed in glorious garments of fine linen. And he ate taste sumptuously every day. And uh beggar had sores feeling and ate tasted the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. And the dogs came and licked his wounds. And it happened that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man died also and in hell. And the scripture says he spoke. So wherever he went into that fifth realm, he could still speak and he could see. He looked across a great chasm and he actually saw the beggar in Abraham's bosom. He had the capacity to realize he is in the bosom of Abra. He's held in a marvelous place. Oh, and he yearned for Lazarus's position. and he could speak. Father Abraham, let Lazarus come. He had his intelligence. He had his voice. He had capacity after he died. And the people were saying perhaps accolades over his over his tomb and his grave. What a great man this was. How much he gave to the to the synagogue and the temple. And oh, he even put a pillar. We got his plaque at the bottom. This pillar was built by this certain rich man. And all the honor that they were giving him. And at the same time while they're giving him that, he's there in Hades screaming out. &gt;&gt; Send Elijah, I mean, send Lazarus. &gt;&gt; Just with a drop of water from my tongue. For I am tormented. and that torment I'd have to go into. He's swallowed up in torment, but there's no escape &gt;&gt; and he can't go back and he can't go. And Abraham said, "Son, when you were in life, you had all the luxuries and Lazarus had none. And besides all of this, besides all of this, there is a great gulf fixed. &gt;&gt; Fixed. That's right. &gt;&gt; So that those that are there cannot pass here and those that are here cannot pass there. &gt;&gt; It's fixed. &gt;&gt; And a prophet came in our language and says it's a nightmare. swallowed up, but he still could see. And I'll get to the sixth dimension at the next service. I'll tell you, there's a lot of feeling. There's a lot of sight. And this man could see and he could speak and he could feel in that realm he was in. But he had to be informed and he had intelligence that he could grasp what Abraham was saying. And besides all of this, there's a great gulf, a chasm, a great chasm that's fixed. The same God that set everything in motion, fixed a bor boundary between the fifth and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth and they are caught there. It's full and filling up &gt;&gt; with those that are denied had their opportunity. Well, then let Lazarus go. Somebody must go. He even had concern. The prophet said he even wanted to preach. &gt;&gt; Let somebody go and tell my brethren, tell my loved ones, don't come here. &gt;&gt; And Abraham spoke and said, "They have the prophets. &gt;&gt; They have." And today they would say they have the ministers. &gt;&gt; And someday if you end up there, God's going to answer you and tell you. You had brother Biscll, &gt;&gt; you had brother Lance Laroo, &gt;&gt; you had brother Tom Ray, &gt;&gt; you had brother Tony Abba, you had brother Dier, you had these others, and you had a host of those that sought to encourage you. You had godly parents. You had somebody You had people that have wept for you and prayed for you and and advised you and laid their heart out for you. They did everything. Don't get caught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not a fear trip. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; The devil tried to tell you, brother Bis trying to lay a fear trip. That's the truth. Don't you deny that devil's voice. You think this is fear that there's no fear like slipping into slipping into eternity knowing it's not right. Knowing you're not right, &gt;&gt; knowing you heard it over and over and I would appeal and plead to everyone. Don't go out of this service. Do you have that assurance within your heart and soul? All is well. All is well. Let us bow our heads. Oh God, my soul so moved. Lord Jesus, your Holy Spirit speaks. Your Holy Spirit cries out. and how you have told us your prophet declared. Death changes nothing. What we are right now, we would be on the other side. If it was not for your grace, oh God, and for your pleading and for your dealing with us, we would not even have opportunity. I pray father for all that are under the sound of my voice and all whose hearts are open now and all whose hearts are searching and those who know that they are not right with you. Those that know they have not surrendered. Let them know, oh God, now if the Holy Spirit is dealing with them, you are you are striving with them that they will not be one of that number caught in this awful nightmare. Father, I pray for the same purpose, Jesus, that you told it. For whatever purpose it was that you told it, I tell it again today. Pray you'll deal with every heart, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. I wonder who God is speaking to. And I wonder whether you want to come and stand for prayer, whether you want to stand where you are. And if you say, "Oh, brother Ed, there's been other times that I've felt moved, but somehow today it's a reality to me. Today, I want to I don't want to take any chance. Today I want to give my all. I want to surrender. I would just urge you, it's not complicated. Your heart is an altar. You can do it right where you are. But I believe it. I believe it's important to make a public declaration. Stand, raise your hand, do whatever you need, or come down here. There's nothing sacred about this place around the altar. Don't think you're getting something special here. It's just that people will more free and able to pray with you. I'd like to sing all is well. All is well. All in. [Music] All is well. We have heard. Shalom. All is well. [Music] There is a place a perfect resting inner veil. So rest little bride rest for all is well. Let's stand. All is well. We have heard the message shalom. All is well. There is a place of perfect rest [Music] in her veil. So rest little pride rest for all is [Music] going to sing I feel the pull. You know when a father or mother would instruct their child, son or daughter, let them know that there are certain dangers that they may confront. There is a danger in this message, a very grave danger. And the danger is that you hear the strongest preaching you'll hear anywhere. And you hear it again and again. You hear it over and over. And the danger is, lest you hear it and say, "Well, I you know, there'll be another time." I want to tell you that rich man wish he had another time. There isn't another time. There is another time. And furthermore, some have said, "Well, I felt this way before." And God, hear me, God has no obligation to ever speak to you again. He may not be speaking to you now, but if he is, if he is, that is the moment to move. And God intends you to move fast. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if he never if he never has spoken to you or if he has spoken to you in the past and you feel and you know within your heart, I say to you lovely people, people that I love with all my heart and soul, you and your you yourself only you know what's between you and God. Only you know that. But I would I would encourage those you that have heard maybe you're just living a life just holding a standard but it's not a real true shall I say of your own of your own desire. I don't know what you desire, but whatever you do, and you all know who you know in your own heart, cuz God is true. He'll witness. Whatever you do, don't ever get caught in that place. Don't get caught. How many of their way to the the other dimension, the sixth dimension, and you'll pray with me with these people here? I feel the hear the call [Music] and your spirit moving me. Give me my all. Speak to me. Glor. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're going to sing it just once more. I feel the Oh, God. hear the call and his me [Music] to [Music] I agree &gt;&gt; and take control. &gt;&gt; I feel the maybe right where you're standing, you'd like to raise your hands, raise your heart. I don't need your response. You need it. Whoever God is dealing with, you need it. Just remember, it's between you and him. And I am appealing to you with all that is in me. Hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. Not my voice, but the voice of the Holy Spirit. And I know that he's speaking because I know I had no intention of ending the service right here. I know that it is him. He's guided me to stop it right here. Let the people respond. Those I'm speaking to. Let me deal with them. Oh Lord Jesus, sending your holy, Holy Spirit, I pray you'll move, oh God, amongst the congregation, seeking out that one, Lord Jesus, not you are the shepherd. You're the great shepherd. It is not us who seeks them out, but you seek them out. And Lord, let the lamb cry out to the shepherd, save me. Oh, heal me. Deliver me. Bring me out of this steep place that I'm in. Bring me out of this terrible place. Bring me out of this bondage, Lord. Deliver me, oh Savior. I pray that you'll reach in, oh Lord, and loose the prison bars, burst the prison bars, and bring out the slave. Bring out the the one that's being held captive by Satan, in the name of Jesus Christ. I come against every demon force that would try to invade, that would try to accuse the brethren, that would try to hold captive the sons and daughters of God. May the son of God hear, "You are free." And whom the son sets free is free indeed. May every daughter of God hear the voice of the master saying, "You're free." May they hear the voice of the master saying, "Storm, peace, be still." Oh God, bring peace out of turmoil. Bring light to darkness and drive the darkness back. Bring healing, oh God, to those that are torn. Those that are that have been so wounded in this life. heal. I pray, Father, and may as a result of this service, I pray on behalf of all believers that are here, Lord, may as a result of the call of God in the lives of the people and in the message this morning, may there be someone, Lord, that'll be warned and they will escape that terrible place that you spoke about for you preached about it, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. us, Lord Jesus, by the faithful Holy Spirit who will convict the world of sin and of judgment to come. I pray, oh God, now that you will make make it clear, make a way clear. Give courage, Lord, to the weak one. Give courage to them, Lord, to take that stand in. Make this step, make this the day of their complete and total deliverance in Jesus Christ's name. as we linger in your presence and as the people will depart and be dismissed. Lord, I pray as they go quietly and go prayerfully and go reverently that they might not leave this place and forget those who are praying. May, oh God, this congregation bear up, Lord, under the burden of souls that are seeking to become established and seeking, oh God, to find their place in the body of Christ. We pray oh God this will be a burden of the congregation and all believers in Jesus Christ's name. In Jesus Christ's name. Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ's name. Just obey the Lord whatever he tells you to do. All those that are need to be dismissed, you're free to be dismissed. I would have you go quietly if you feel to linger. It'd be a good atmosphere to linger in. If you all would pray for someone else, &gt;&gt; oh God, hold them in your heart. Hold them in your heart, Lord. Hold them in your hand, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do what we cannot do, Lord. Do the exceeding abundantly. Above all, we can ask his name. [Music] &gt;&gt; Give your all. Yes, Lord. Yes. Oh, God. Oh, God. Be my brother, I pray, be my brother, I pray, oh God, meet my own sisters, oh God, needing you, Lord. Oh God, let them feel. Let them heal to that pull. I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I feel the pull. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I feel the &gt;&gt; down in our soul. We hear the call. The &gt;&gt; spirit moving me to hear my heart. to me and I agree. Come &gt;&gt; take control. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want you to sing it again. Not as a chorus, but I want every believer come and take control. That is a cry that's in my heart. Will you blend with me? Will you yield with me? Come and take control, oh God. Come and take control of every situation. Take control of every life. Wouldn't this church desire that? Take control of every family. Take control of every man, every woman, every child. Oh God, come and take control. I feel that pull. I know you do. Oh, let's focus our whole attention and thoughts upon him now. And we just sing it out to him in a prayer. Oh God, in the inspiration that God gave it. Let's find that channel and move into it. I feel the pull. [Music] I hear the call. [Music] And Your spirit &gt;&gt; is moving me. &gt;&gt; What is it you want? &gt;&gt; What is it you'd have me to do? Oh God, speak to me. Oh God, I am. Oh, come and take control. I've killed the Oh, come and take control. The last two verses. Oh, just the last two lines, would you, dear? Oh, come and take control. I feel the I believe the mind of the Holy Spirit. Oh come, please come. Control. I feel the dear. Oh, please come take control. I feel the [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have your way, Lord. Holy Spirit, why don't we lift our hands? Why don't we just yield our mouths and our voice, don't be ashamed. Maybe you've never done it before and say, "Oh, God, have your way. Have your way in my life. Lead me. Here I am, Lord. Speak and I will answer. &gt;&gt; Speak, oh God. Speak on, Lord. Speak out beyond our hearing of our ears and the senses of this body. Let men and women reach into that sixth realm with that sixth sense. Let them pull down the supernatural that they have need of just now. If you have a need in your life, don't leave it. Don't wait. Don't wait for another service. My brother, &gt;&gt; don't wait for another time, &gt;&gt; my sister. [Music] Oh God, [Music] &gt;&gt; come and take control &gt;&gt; in your name, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. I ask you just to mind mind Christ.
