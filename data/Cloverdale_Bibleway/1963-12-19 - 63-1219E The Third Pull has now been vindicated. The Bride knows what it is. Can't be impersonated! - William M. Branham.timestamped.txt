[0:00] I am going to say something to you now
[0:03] that I haven't said all along that is
[0:07] the thing that we have looked forward to
[0:10] for so long for at least many years four
[0:13] five years or maybe longer the third
[0:16] pull has now been Vindicated and I'm
[0:19] sure you all know what it is now
[0:23] remember there'll never be an
[0:25] impersonation of that because it can't
[0:27] be it cannot be now it's
[0:32] inexistence
[0:34] and I have I am warned of this that
[0:40] soon right at this time now it's just
[0:43] happened so it could identify its
[0:47] presence among
[0:48] you see but it will not be used in a
[0:52] great way until this Council begins to
[0:57] tighten up and when it does
[1:00] when that does the Pentecostals and so
[1:03] forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:05] can be done but when that time comes
[1:09] when the squeeze comes down then you'll
[1:11] see what you've seen temporarily be
[1:14] manifested in the fullness of its
[1:18] power
[1:20] now I must continue in
[1:24] evangelism just as I was commissioned
[1:26] first I must continue on therefore
[1:30] you've had the word and you know what to
[1:33] look for how to stand I must continue on
[1:37] in evangelism and friends of mine keep
[1:42] still and just keep moving on for the
[1:45] hour is approaching swiftly see that
[1:48] when something is going to be done but
[1:51] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:53] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:55] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:58] hath declared to his servants the
[2:00] prophets
