Want to remember Sister Grace Bey this morning. Pray for Daniel at home, sick, not feeling well. We just want to remember that need this morning. If you have a need upon your heart, maybe you want to just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer this morning. Brother Tim, if you'd come. Thank you. Oh heavenly father, author of life, you are alone are the giver of every good gift. Everything, oh Lord, that we have need of this morning is in you. And we come unto your throne of grace. We come, Lord, approaching your presence, knowing, Lord, that you're our father. That Lord, if we ask for a fish, you'll not give us a serpent. If we ask for bread, you'll not give us a stone. But Lord, you have promised to give us every good thing that pertains unto life and happiness. We look into your word and we believe those promises this morning. And Lord, no matter how much we need you, we know you're ever present to meet those needs. And Lord, as we stand this morning, the one thing we need is more of you, Lord. More of your love, more of your grace, more of your presence to fill us, oh God. overflow us, oh God, in this service this morning. We want you to take the divine preeminence over every part. Lord, may you anoint the speaker, our brother, our pastor. Lord, as he comes to bring the word, we're desiring, oh Lord, that you'll fill our hungry souls.

And Lord, may you be pleased to multiply it and use it to your glory and your honor. We commit all things to you, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning, each one, as you have your seats. Amen. We appreciate the presence of the Lord this morning coming and being with us. Amen. Where he is, great things are happening. Amen. Disciples were frustrated one day. They were on a boat fishing. Hadn't caught a thing all night pulling into the shore. The Lord Jesus was present. Great things had happened. Amen. He said, "Just drop your net on the wrong on the other side of the boat." Amen. He knew where the fish were. He knows where you are this morning. And I believe if there's one here this morning that needs a to be caught in the Lord's net. Amen. I believe he's here to cast the net this morning and draw us to himself. Amen. Our pastor is going to be coming in just a moment. We do want to make mention of uh a couple of those that are visiting with us this morning. Maybe we could just sing as they're uh preparing. Have you been beneath the fountain now? Number 934. There's a an American license plate ABC. I won't say the rest. That's pretty obvious. Uh your lights are on. It's a green Ford. So, make sure you take care of that. [Music] We have a visitor from uh the Iverson's, Simeon and Leah. Where are you this morning? I've been looking all over. There you are. God bless you.

We're just giving him glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, we'll have you have your seat and we're going to ask our brother Kyle Morton if he will approach the front here, the podium. We're going to have a ordination service &gt;&gt; for our brother Kyle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Kyle, we're um indeed privileged to have this time of this service and neither do we want to rush through it. The scripture said Isaiah 6:8 also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who shall go for us then said I here am I send me and I I would like to have the congregation join us and while we sing a verse or two and brother Derek you'll help help us Uh, hear the word, hear the Lord of the harvest sweetly calling. And the prophet of God sang this often. Who will go and work for me today? Who will bring to me the lost and dying? Who will point them to the narrow way? Speak my Lord. And that's for everybody. Speak my Lord. Lead me. This isn't for one person, but this is for all of us as a congregation and especially for you. When we sing, Brother Kyle, our thoughts will be directed toward you. When the coal of fire touched the prophet, making him as pure as pure can be. When the voice of God said, "Who will go for us?" Then he said, "Here am I, send me." And while we may not be prophets, but we have the message of God's prophet messenger. And in one of the services uh they were having a dedication and a men a man came forward and he wanted to be ordained just spontaneously and brother Brandham said I I don't know if I recognize you. And he said I come here to church. And he said where where are you from? He said, "I'm from the Salvation Army." He said, "Well, they've done a good work and uh we we appreciate that, brother, and we're going to ordain him," he said, "to the ministry." He said, "But but we have a message." And he was very clear, "But we have a message to that God has given us to give out." So, he was letting the brother know that's where he was being ordained to. But we would like to sing together. Why don't you stand one more time, would you, as our brother Kyle stands and then we will continue on with the we're going to just sing the two verses, the first and the second verse. Here the Lord of Harvest is sweetly calling, who will go and work for me today? Who will bring to me the lost and dying? Who will point them to the narrow way? Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Oh Lord, send me. When the coal of fire touch the prophet, making him as pure as pure can be. When the voice of God said, "Who go for us?" Then he answered, "Here I sent me. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will wait to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, &gt;&gt; congregation may be seated. The scripture speaks, brother Kyle, and to everyone. Ephesians, Paul said, "Wherefore he seth, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto man." And I've seen this gift in your life, Brother Kyle. Paul said to Timothy, "But continue thou in the things that thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Paul also said in Corinthians he said that now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit diver differences of administration but the same Lord diversities of operations but it is the same God that workketh all in all and here's one of my foundation scriptures of the foundation in in my life that I have used as guidance but The manifestation, that's verse 7 of 1 Corinthians 12, but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all. And I I have noticed throughout my life, there have been those that have been very uh energetic and happy and enthused about ministering. They wanted to preach and uh and I have seen them and they've had opportunity to stand up and preach. But I found that when they were done, the one that stood behind the pulpit was the only one that really got inspired. They got so excited and just happy and giggling and laughing and having a wonderful time, but the congregation wasn't getting it. I watched when brother Kyle got up and ministered in his unique manner which he has and sometimes would say things that kind of you know make a person think and go sideways and you know have to come from a different direction. Uh but I saw the people were benefited and the last time you spoke uh brother Kyle uh I heard before I got home I already had emails more than one and from uh I would say uh senior people uh that were benefited that disappointments are God's appointments and I can tell you that that is uh that is something that we could all do well to remember and put down in our memory bank disappointments are God's appointments. &gt;&gt; I mean then we exercise the scripture. &gt;&gt; So we have seen that ministry uh in you brother Kyle. So we're not doing this as a mere formality. Brother Kyle and Sister Christina his wife will be leaving uh tomorrow and uh they're going to be going east. They're going to be spending a little time going to go down to Jeffersonville. They want to visit there. Then there, Brother Kyle will be speaking at Bible believers of Lima at brother Craig Boore's church. Brother Craig Boore will be the camp speaker this year. Uh but he has asked, Brother Craig Bour has asked Brother Kyle. He heard him and he felt a need to have that kind of ministry amongst his young people and his people. So he will be going there. I thought it was kind of uh special. I didn't realize it until just the last minute when I was in my study, Brother Kyle. But brother Brham was ordaining uh brother a brother McKenna and I knew him. Uh brother McKenna was the pastor in Lima, Ohio. And here you're going to be probably preaching one of your first services down there and and some of the people that brother McKenna was pastor of will be sitting while you minister. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And here, brother Brandham ordained brother McKenna and he says he's got a little group in Ohio in Lime, Ohio. And here I am. And I felt honored to have you, Brother Kyle, and to know that in a few days you'll be ministering and speaking to some of the same people that Brother McKenna spoke to and pastored. and he he was hurt very seriously in an auto accident and never really fully recovered. Uh brother Brandham said now these outward expressions and we see brother McKenna who has who has seen the light of the gospel that we see represented and expressed in your life. Brother Kyle, we believe him. A lovely brother, got a nice family, and he's come to us and he's trying to hold a little group together there in Ohio with brother and sister Dao and the rest of the brethren there. And we love him and we believe him to be a man called of God. We bring them before this congregation, giving this testimony as like manner, as you've heard, laying hands on them that we believe that they're called of God and give our sanction to it and ask God's blessing to go with them. And that's what we are going to do now. Uh he said that's exactly the way they did it in the Bible was lay hands upon them in ordination. They laid hands upon the deacons. They and put them in the church. Everything was by laying on of hands. Not signing a bunch of papers and joining a certain creed or something like that. They laid hands on and turned them loose in the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and let them go. Amen. God led him the way he wants to and that's all that's the way we believe in doing it. Laying on of hands doesn't impart anything to our brother. It is the blessing of God. We are asking the blessing of God and we are recognizing what God has already given. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'll ask the brothers to come and we will uh turn and face the congregation if you would brother Kyle with uh other brothers. How many people have been blessed by brother Kyle's ministry? There we have the testimony. We believe him to be a man of God. And we'll just sing once more if we would please. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be waiting to answer thee. Speak my own. Speak my Lord. Speak and answer. And if everyone now would just bow your heads and we'll pray together as we lay hands upon our brother. [Music] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we're standing here in a holy sacred moment. &gt;&gt; We have seen truly your hand laid upon brother Kyle before we dare lay our hand on him. And we believe that your gift, oh God, when you ascended, you gave gifts unto men. We pray that you will take this gift, that you will cultivate it, that you will mold it, oh God, that your Holy Spirit will guide our brother Kyle, that you'll speak to him things, Father, that he has not thus far known. That it'll be a divine revelation, oh God. that your word will be so clear to him. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask that you'll make him unmovable. I pray that you'll give him boldness, Father. That he'll have no fear of man, but he'll say that which you confirm in his heart, that he'll speak with love and concern for the bride of Jesus Christ. And that he might realize he represents a vindicated message, not something learned in a theological school, but something that you will teach him. For you have said that the Holy Spirit will lead you into all truth. We lay our hands upon our brother Kyle Morton to ordain him, oh God, into this ministry. For that we have a message to tell to the world and a message to preach. I pray you'll bless his wife, Sister Christine. Pray, oh God, that she shall indeed be the encouragement and the helpmate for him. Bless his children, oh God. Let his home and family be an example, an example home, an example ministry, an example wife to the ministry, an example children in the name of Jesus Christ. We loose him, oh God, that the Holy Spirit may take his take him completely and use him. Thank you, Lord Jesus. You'll provide for him, oh God, according to his needs and according to your blessing, &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Kyle. Amen. [Music] Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Simeon and Sister Leah. My night, we missed you last time. Last time we were over there and realize I can't always be everywhere at the same time. God bless you. Happy that you're here. Would you stand with me and we're going to turn to the word right away and thank you. Turn in your Bibles if you would to Deuteronomy the 4th chapter, chapter 4. And we're just going to read three verses there 33-36. And we'll read one verse of Deuteronomy 32 verse 10. Happy to see you all here. Hallelujah. It's important to be here in expectation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee. And upon earth he showed thee his great fire. And thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. That's verse 36. So we start with verse 33. Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and live? Or hath God said to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes. Unto thee it was showed that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God. There is none other. There is none else beside him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee. And upon earth he showed thee his great fire that that and thou heardest his voice out of the midst of the heaven. If you'll notice just for a moment, he didn't say that you heard the voice out of Moses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Moses was not the origin. &gt;&gt; You heard the voice out of heaven. &gt;&gt; We've heard a voice. The voice uh did not did not originate in William Brham. &gt;&gt; Uh the voice of God originates in heaven. &gt;&gt; It's come from the throne of God. &gt;&gt; So we say, okay, now how do we know that that is God's voice? It comes first. it'll be vindicated or proven. &gt;&gt; And number two, the greatest vindication is the effect that that voice has upon the people. It doesn't merely make a good church or nice people. It makes people who become unmovable. &gt;&gt; As I said to the people down in Louisiana, just having returned from there, I said, "There are those that would that uh that can't go on and they let go. And there are those who want to let go but can't let go. And I'm glad I can say I'm in that number. &gt;&gt; I'm in that number. &gt;&gt; Even when things get going so hard, say, I'd like to let go, but you can't let go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so when Jesus said to Peter, "Wilt thou go?" He couldn't go. &gt;&gt; He couldn't let go. Amen. We'll read verse 32, uh verse 10 in chapter 32. He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness. He led him about. He instructed him. He kept him as the apple of his eye. Amen. And you may have your seats. You may want to keep your Bible handy. And I would like to say to the congregation uh and especially to the young people, senior young people especially, if you have a question, jot it down. If something comes to your mind, jot it down and so that we can come back to it. some of the comments. I have been asked by uh brother Tatch to make some comments at the graduation evening, the formal evening. That's not the dinner, but that's the formal evening I believe on Friday uh Friday night. And so this will be a leadin to that. It will give a foundation also to the comments I would like to make there. This will be coming from a spiritual perspective. Uh the title I would like to speak on is instruction brings change. &gt;&gt; Instruction brings about change. &gt;&gt; Not all change is is of God. Come on. &gt;&gt; Uh you don't have to do anything. If you just drift along and go with the movement or the crowd, you will experience change. I doubt if it'll be a godly change. &gt;&gt; Uh but it'll be change &gt;&gt; and you won't end up being exactly the same as you were. And and and furthermore, the change might even be imperceptible. You don't realize that, you know, it's just adjusting here and adjusting there. Maybe adjusting to a neighbor, adjusting to a friend, adjusting to a peer, adjusting to your own age, your own time. And so for the young people and especially the graduates that will be graduating, you've come to a time of of of significant change and I will be speaking about that. But what I have today coming from the scriptures will give you a good groundwork. So I want you to absorb the spiritual side of it today. Uh and the scripture which we read had said out of heaven out of heaven he made thee to hear the voice. It's very very significant that when you come to church that you realize you're not listening just to a minister &gt;&gt; or the man of God that stands behind the pulpit who has waited on God, but you want to say the source of these words &gt;&gt; have come from the throne of God. &gt;&gt; And there may be just a sentence or a line, but I will give myself to hear everything that is spoken. So I might absorb that which God is sending me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he made thee to hear. Not everyone can hear. He made thee to hear his voice. Number one, that he might instruct thee. That's why he allows us to hear his voice. That we might receive instruction. And this restruction isn't something that's just light and optional. &gt;&gt; This is instruction that God is requiring. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in the New Testament, he calls it chastisement. But chastisement doesn't always refer to a whipping. That's not what he's referring to. Words are to form and to change a person's way and mode of living. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And God imposes that upon. He said, "So I made you to hear. my voice. &gt;&gt; And the reason we heard it is so that you can change. &gt;&gt; Change doesn't good change doesn't come easy. &gt;&gt; Good changes often are very very difficult and it's hard to change old ways and old habits and things that we become so accustomed to. But there are some things that we need to change &gt;&gt; and we need to expect that change. And for those that especially that are uh coming to graduation now, you will you will have received a lot of instruction. And I'll probably repeat that phrase. Uh at the graduation, you have now come to a certain closure. Uh you have spent these years now in school and the prophet spoken leadership that you started out with your mother perhaps at your first step and you received some instruction. You you know your parents taught you what was hot and that you must not touch it or you get burned. And it's amazing how we learn things. I always am amazed when we go overseas and see children just very very young learning to speak and and they speak something I don't understand cuz they speak in another language and it's always been just such a marvel to me and uh uh brother Daniel Cen Bruner he has the cutest little daughter and and she'll she'll speak uh French for a bit and then she'll just cut off and speak in German and And when she when I speak in English, she smiles because she understands it, but she doesn't want to speak it. And and I just think she's so cute. I'd like to kind of steal her and take her away with us sometime. Uh, but I I I'm always so amused with that, the way she just, you know, speak that and then correct her father if he doesn't say it just exactly right cuz her father his mother language is German and her her mother's mother language is French in Switzerland. And uh and so sometimes if the father the brother Daniel was telling me if he doesn't just get exact pronunciation in the French you say no papa you know you need to say it like this and she has it so perfect but it always amazes me is how did they how how did they get it? Well by observation and by instruction and so on. So we've had a lot of instruction along these things. The scripture tells us in Proverbs, he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction. &gt;&gt; You want to remember that he is he is in the way of life that that keepeth instruction. &gt;&gt; But he that refusth repro reproof erth. That's very simple. You want to write that down. Proverbs 10:17. So now we have the opening pages of the scripture, the opening pages of the Bible, we have the fall in Eden. And in the closing pages of the scripture, we have another Eden where there is no effect of the fall. There will be no sin, no heartache, no tears, no death, &gt;&gt; none of that. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; That means that we are somewhere sitting right here today at this moment. We are somewhere between this Eden and this other Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are being instructed so we can get to this Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; And God is determined to bring his children to this &gt;&gt; Eden. &gt;&gt; And that's why he said, "You've heard the voice from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not from a man. You've heard it from heaven. &gt;&gt; Not from a Bible school. From heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; People want to know what school did you go to? Well, it it it would be better if you didn't have to say that it was to a certain certain uh theological school, but we learn the things in school. We learn things that are essential. We learn learn things that are necessary for this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the but the prize of this life is that life. &gt;&gt; The prize of being born in this world is to be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are somewhere I feel not near only the the garden, the Eden in the end, but I feel we're very near the entrance. &gt;&gt; I sincerely believe that. &gt;&gt; You know, just listen how far behind uh uh the the one that is has a forerunner. You have a forerunner and a forerunning message to achieve a certain goal that's never been never been vindicated, never been sent, never been spoken about this Bible like it has been spoken in this message by by this prophet of God. Never in history been spoken like that. And the proof of it is people always want to prove it. The proof of it is is that it actually produces what it says it will produce. And for people who will give themselves to it, it's not really that difficult. You yield yourself to it and it actually produces the life. It produces something the world doesn't produce it. &gt;&gt; There's no corporation out there to produce it. There's no school out there to produce it. There's no church to produce it. It is it is so disheartening and and it's more than disheartening if a person didn't know that you had a hold of something. If you look at what is what is represented as being uh you know Pentecost or that which is considered the the the uh peak you know it's the it's the apex of spirituality out there and some people that are sitting here in this service right now went to see some people that they had known years ago singers went there and could not tolerate what was going on and had to walk out Amen. &gt;&gt; In a big Pentecostal church &gt;&gt; right here, not far from not far from this church. What is it? That's that's they are what they're feeding on. I guess &gt;&gt; they are what they're feeding on. &gt;&gt; But you people and we we must uh uh give reverence and respect and thanksgiving that you know this message didn't originate with us. &gt;&gt; Doesn't belong to Cloverdale Bible Way. doesn't belong to any believer's church anywhere in the world. It it came from heaven. &gt;&gt; And we have to continue to hold fast that this originated in heaven. &gt;&gt; This message didn't. Anybody who thought it came from Moses, they they had problems. &gt;&gt; They said to Moses, "Are you the only holy one?" &gt;&gt; And and they stumbled over that. and and Moses he even he even uh you know he he intervened and he prevailed upon God don't destroy them &gt;&gt; even when they had sinned against God. So uh we have to keep that in our minds. Now in the in the revelation the prophet said this book that we're studying in the is the actual revelation of Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the church and his work in the future ages and I made I abbreviated and made some notes here which I'm going to have come up. It takes the Holy Spirit. Now, this is the prophet's words. It takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it. &gt;&gt; It's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. Now, we didn't make the class of people, and that's not our invention. &gt;&gt; That's not God's invention. Jesus said, and we'll read it later, other sheep I have that are not of this fold. Them also I must bring. But he had them. &gt;&gt; Other sheep I have. &gt;&gt; They are his sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was very clear. Said, "Why can't you hear me? Why can't you?" Because he said, "You're of your father, the devil." there were another another class. &gt;&gt; And so we just accept what he says. &gt;&gt; So this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. And it will take one with prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It will require the ability to hear from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will require supernatural instruction. Here's my message. It will require supernatural instruction. &gt;&gt; Not just how to, you know, add two and two or not just how to tie your shoes or not just to learn the basic things of home and not just to learn, you know, how to how to cook or how to sew or how to do these things. But this will require supernatural instruction. Not just a student comparing verse with verse, though that is good. &gt;&gt; But a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. &gt;&gt; People can see it and they can see and they can have assumptions about it and presume things and miss and hit and so on and so forth. But this friends, this can only come through a prophetic message. That's the only way it can come. And you ought to everyone say amen to that. &gt;&gt; How we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open. &gt;&gt; This is the key now. How we need to hear from God. Number one, and two, lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know. &gt;&gt; I thought that was so good I needed to put it so you could read it. That'll be fine. You can take it off now. In speaking to Joshua, God said, "Be strong and of a good courage, for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them." Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do, observe to do, not merely now, observe to hear, but observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Now, here's God telling them how they're to hear it. And turn not from the right hand or the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. And I think most of us here are interested in success. And he goes on to say, "This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, we don't have flashes of spiritual times. &gt;&gt; It's not a flash of a spiritual time. &gt;&gt; God is interested in just plain old, rugged, steady, steadfast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he plans. That's what he teaches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in going to church. &gt;&gt; I believe in going to church. Amen. &gt;&gt; We were thinking of it and my wife and I were speaking about it and and even if we didn't have a message church that that had the word at the time in our earlier times and we were feeding on the message, but we went to church so I could maybe get a slice &gt;&gt; or be an example as well &gt;&gt; and make a mark &gt;&gt; in the world. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. You want to feel very very uncomfortable if you're not in the house of God. &gt;&gt; If you're if it's possible for you to be there. &gt;&gt; I realize that jobs and things take people and so on. In the token message, it's all right. I'll get preaching after a while. In the token message, the prophet said, "Full obedience to the word brings God." The word brings God, the word eternal in you. &gt;&gt; We're interested in that, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Full obedience brings God the word into you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In you. And that is the token. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the word is in you, it's Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said further in the token, the token is the sign that the purchase has been made and been accepted. &gt;&gt; Full obedience to the whole word of God will in will entitle you to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Full obedience. &gt;&gt; Not the part of it as far as your denomination goes, but all of it. Full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ. Whenever God speaks, it's for a divine purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has an objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "He has an objective and a purpose, and he's going to achieve that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can rest on that. He's going to achieve it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God deals with his children one way and he deals with others another way. even those who are of denominational uh backgrounds or people who do not go to church. Brother Brandham says that so this has nothing to do with healing as such because he says a woman off the street, a street woman can come up and maybe have uh make contact with God and have faith, exercise faith and receive a a complete healing while a godly sister misses it. So it's it's it is the grace of God. And then God has certain laws in place. And for example, give and it shall be given to you. It didn't say give and fast 40 days or give and go and pray for 2 or 3 hours. Give. No, it says give and it shall be given to you. &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; that's that's one of that's a law. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what brother Brandham had to deal with when he was with the Full Gospel Christian businessmen because they felt that that all the prosperity that came to them was due to their spirituality, that they were more spiritual because God gave them more. And he had to let them know that had nothing to do with that. &gt;&gt; They just were exercising the law of giving &gt;&gt; and they gave. And you say, "Well, I I can't afford to give." No, no. It's it's absolutely opposite. It's the other way around. You can af you cannot afford not to give &gt;&gt; because by giving it releases the law of God in your life. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know how it is, but people have you know they've tried to save and tried to uh you know pro protect themselves and whatever more and and the Bible even speaks of it goes in a goes in a bag with holes in it &gt;&gt; and then it goes and you don't even know where it goes. And you young people that are launching out into from graduation into life and so on and so forth. Yeah. The economy will be tight and and you'll have difficult time maybe uh paying for your way and so on. One of the first things you want to do, one of the first things you want to do is pay your tithe. &gt;&gt; If you're if you haven't started that habit, you want to start that habit now. &gt;&gt; That's right. one of our deacons here and I I see I don't see brother Joe Walner just here so I'll just speak to him. He came as an electrician from the colony in Manitoba and he was a prize electrician. He was looking after two or three colonies but he had no ticket. No ticket. no acknowledgment that he was an electrician when he come come here just pulled up ropes pulled up all the cords and came arrived here and uh didn't have a job and walked right into the little log church he and his wife and sister Kathy we just talked about because we were with Kathy here a few days ago and she was just she was 16 and I walked in and brother Joe started applying for work Well, he they want to know where's his ticket. You know, he didn't have a ticket. So, I really felt I felt very very bad because I would say over this pulpit that uh you know, businessmen abuse others that don't have the ticket and they hired him for just $6 an hour or something. It was shameful. But one thing that man did is as soon as he got his pay, he made out one check for tithing and one check for uh offering. But that's what he did. And and I don't know how they made it. It was difficult and perhaps and I know that two of them and brother Eli yourself and brother Joe and Eileen had to have a home together etc. and uh manage that way. And people go through hardships. Uh that's standard life. And uh and I and I know you know I know what I'm talking about. I haven't said much to this congregation. I spent 30 years of my life in hardship. 30 years. And that was not easy. And I was raising family at the time and everything else. My wife went with me wherever we went, whether we were in a little trailer or wherever we went. Uh, wherever we were ministering or wherever we were staying, she just was willing to go. Never never never once said anything to never ever heard her complain about it. Just went along. And uh I remember I remember this day, you know, because sometimes, you know, we are maybe more in tune and so on. Here we had brother Joe and and brother Henry were both looking for work and they made a big announcement in the newspaper and the announcement was that the federal government froze all hiring. There will be no more hiring by the federal government. And now here's these uh you know solid people and faithful in the church. That very day that very day that that announcement was made both of them got federal were hired at positions and brother brother Joe David don't tell him I'm saying this. Brother Joe got he finally got such a soft touch job. He did say to me, "I'm embarrassed when I pick up my check." I said, "Why?" "Well, there's nothing, you know, there's really nothing to do." And so it went on for it went on. This is good for you. You know, this what this didn't happen the week he arrived. This happened a few years down the road. But he but I'm just telling you what he set his course. He just set his course. This is it. This is God's word. I was thinking of the message and brother Tom was preaching the other night. He says uh that we live by every word of God. And one of those words is tithing. I I don't preach much about tithing, but I just thought this was very fitting. One of those words is tithing. &gt;&gt; And you know, a lot of people actually rob themselves because they don't give to God. And that's God's money and they're down there spending it at the mall. or don't give God's money to Walmart, whatever you do. That's the biggest mistake in the world. And so I I asked and Brother Joe said, "I'm actually embarrassed. I'm embarrassed when I pick up my check." And I said, "Well, don't be embarrassed. God give it to you. God give you this job." And uh yeah. So one day about several months later I said cuz you know those of you that talk to brother Joe Wner is you know everything's fixed. His face is fixed. His eyes look at you and look through you and everything's fixed. And when words come out of his mouth that's it. It's just so I said, "Brother Joe," I said, "Please be honest with me." Now, if you were working for a commercial electrician and had to produce the amount of work you usually do, how much time would it have taken for you to do the work you did today? He said, "10 minutes." I said, "Now I know why you're embarrassed when you pick up your check." But he was a self-trained man and received instruction and uh but it wasn't accepted by, you know, by others by the world. But to instruct here's now I want to give you a couple different sides of instruction. So those of you that will be in the graduation and uh you'll remember this please to receive instruction as I said it is the with the word even in the New Testament is to chasen. It says uh uh in the scripture blessed is the man whom the Lord whom thou chastenest. We thought, "Oh my goodness." No, but we have to understand what is blessed is the blessed is the man whom the Lord instructs. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man who the Lord corrects. &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man who the Lord loves and directs his footsteps &gt;&gt; in the right way. Can we not agree to that? &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, and teachest him out of thy law. &gt;&gt; Teach us. So uh uh in the Hebrew to be chasened is to be disciplined or to be admonished or to let oneself be chasened. It's not just to you know I heard of a a boy and he he uh 16 17 years old and he just thought I'm done with home and I'm done with all of this instruction my father imposing all this. I'm out of here. I'm history. So he went and he found out what the real world was like and he spent a couple years away from home and he asked if he could come home. And so parents said, "Yeah, it'll be fine." And he said, "Well, I'm looking here seeing all these young men here." And so they said, "Yeah, it'll be fine." And he was home. He was home for a little while. And he said he was just amazed how much his father had learned in two years. Sounds true to life, doesn't it? So, blessed is the man whom thou chastest, oh Lord, and teachest him out of thy law. In Deuteronomy, which we had read, it said this now because now I want to add this to my the comments and move on from here. He found him in a desert land and in a waste howling wilderness. He led him about. He instructed him. He kept him as the apple of his eye. It It's This instruction isn't for and and we've all heard it. This is for your benefit. This hurts me more than it hurts you. Nobody's heard that. He instructed him and this is a different he's teaching to be discreet to be have to have understanding to have discernment to be able to perceive what is right and what is wrong to perceive what is true and uh to discern to understand. So in Hebrews it says, "If you endure chastening, God deal with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chastineth not?" What son? And you know that's the apple of his eye. That's the father's the father's love and it's his own image and his own flesh and blood. So he instructs him uh in the way and that chastening is not only instruction but it's to nurture it is the whole training and the education of children which relates to the cultivation of mind and morals what is right so you can discern what is right you can discern that this is going to take me the wrong way or it's going to be the and it uses it uses for this purpose command commandments. You cannot go there. I don't want you to go there. Or maybe when they get older, it it wouldn't be pleasing to me. Mother and father would be disappointed if you went there. But you think about it, you've got to finally make your own decision. But all of this teaching in the home and so on and teaching in the church and teaching at a Christian school is to to gain admonition and to gain discernment &gt;&gt; so you can you won't always be there. You won't always have that protection. You won't always have that onhand guidance. &gt;&gt; See, I can't preach like this at the at the grad, so I'm taking some liberties just now. And so it uses for this purpose, for this uh to nurture and to instruct, uses for this purpose even commands and admonition, reproof, and when necessary, punishment. And don't get quiet. Now, God punishes. And if you're a son and daughter of God, I'm sure there's at some point in time where you felt smitten &gt;&gt; because you felt that you've grieved the Holy Spirit and maybe didn't recognize it until there was some punishment being applied and you went through a hard time. I'll just leave it like that. Paul said in Hebrews further, "For whom the Lord loveth, he chastneth, and scourgeeth every son whom he receiveth." That's not God doesn't need that. We're the ones that need that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what do we start off with? You have caused me to hear your voice &gt;&gt; so that I may instruct you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you think this message came for? This message isn't always I've had people say to me, "It took the hide off my back." &gt;&gt; Brother Charlie Drake used to say that all the time. Sister Elner, it took the hide off my back, but I love it. &gt;&gt; That's the response. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I see a few smiles. I'll see a few more in a little bit. The the chastening. I'll just uh give you another another because there are several words used in the Bible. To learn to chasten is to learn. So that's so chastening sounds hard but learning doesn't sound near. It's to learn or to teach, to instruct, to train children to be instructed or taught or learn to cause one to learn or to chastise by words with words molding. I used to, you don't mind some personal things here. I used to chastise mostly by words. And my daughters said as they got older, they said, "Another thing that you do, Dad, you'd poke us. You'd poke you on a chest. Make sure you know I'm talking to you." And they did confess. They they said that that was so, you know, you just were making your point so real. They just wish, "Why don't you just spank me and get get it over with?" because the spanking would have been easier than the verbal, you know, not verbal abuse, but just verbal instruction because it comes down and the spanking would have been easier. Well, sometimes I think God just gets his finger and I hear see that prophet raise his finger and come across that pulpit and what what's he doing? He's adi there's admonition. It's teaching. It's instruction. He's imposing something upon us for our benefit, &gt;&gt; for our correction, for our direction, and for our protection in the future. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Psalms, he said, I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way that thou shalt go, and I will guide thee with mine eye. I will instruct you is to be wise and to understand and to have insight &gt;&gt; to be given some perception, have insight and to give attention to and to consider, to comprehend. All of these things are part of instruction. He said, I will instruct you. But the last would which I think we all will like to prosper and have success. We have to take it to heart &gt;&gt; to prosper and have success. So in instruction that is received or heeded brings about change. And now I want to take the service off to the in another direction. Opportunity and obedience brings about change. not opportunity by itself. There's a lot of opportunity which is just a subtle it's really a subtle enchantment &gt;&gt; actually away from a godly change. &gt;&gt; And so we have to have discernment not all in fact as I can tell you that there are many many opportunities that would make life easier here but it is not taking a person or a family in a godly direction. But if we settle it in our mind, the godly direction is the direction wherever I go in life or to further education or to a promotion within my business or job or whatever more. The godly the godly direction is my direction. &gt;&gt; Now I want to I want to speak about Ruth for about the next 30 minutes or so. Ruth. And you need to perhaps read the book of Ruth. It's only four chapters after this service. And for those of you that want swimming water, there's plenty in there. And I will throw a little out while we're at it. Ruth, her secret to her success. And remember I said in an earlier service, she had hardships. &gt;&gt; She endured incredible sorrow. &gt;&gt; She lost her husband as a young woman and lost her father-in-law and lost her only brother-in-law. And there were three widows left in her homeland, but it was foreign to them. And they got reduced to poverty, absolute utter poverty, and were just in bitterness. And Naomi, when she returned home, said, "Don't call me Naomi anymore. Call me Mara, for my life has been bitter." &gt;&gt; And Ruth had been a part of that. So now I I probably would be correct in saying that her life was probably more bitter than what anyone here has had to experience even though we've experienced our grave hardships. And that is why those of you from Congo and from other places in Africa especially, you have experienced hardships and difficulties that we have perhaps never experienced. &gt;&gt; But it is not for not &gt;&gt; it is not it is not God even knew that &gt;&gt; God knew where you'd be born. &gt;&gt; God knew all the hardships you'd go through. God knew all the loss that you'd go through and the uncertainty that you've experienced and and you come into another country and and the culture is different and the language is different and everything is different and it's not been an easy road. &gt;&gt; God has seen that. But I want you to know that your lives can be and are a tremendous blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so don't try to just adopt the direction that we go. We may not be going exactly the right way. God hasn't promised that we just go, you know, floating down the uh stream of time with ease and so on. &gt;&gt; Let let your culture speak to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let your ways that God has blessed speak to us. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you the prophet spoke very very highly of the high morals &gt;&gt; within the country. And perhaps it's not the same now, but I have also observed the uh your prayer life and the way that you have lived and the respect &gt;&gt; and the and the respect you have for the ministry. &gt;&gt; It is just incredible and and you should teach us teach us those lessons. &gt;&gt; They're very valuable and they're scriptural lessons. &gt;&gt; So I want you to know you're very much a part and uh and a respected part and I respect you very very highly, very highly. But Ruth, she had set her course before all of these good things began to come her way. And she didn't know they were good things, &gt;&gt; but she had set her course. &gt;&gt; And that's what people and some here need to do. And especially those that are being cut loose, say, from school and perhaps from home. and you're going to be venturing on your own, you need to set your course. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm going in a godly direction." &gt;&gt; I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going in a godly direction. &gt;&gt; Amen. people even within this congregation, we need to set our course and say whatever comes, &gt;&gt; hardship or loss or whatever comes, I set my life in a godly direction and nothing nothing but God himself shall move me from this direction. &gt;&gt; Where you go, Ruth, is where I go. She couldn't even explain why that was there. Your God shall be my God. &gt;&gt; Your land shall be my land. Where you live, and here she's talking to a widow who has nothing. Where you live, that's where I'm going to live. &gt;&gt; And where you die, that's where I'm going to die. And your people are going to be my people. &gt;&gt; And your God will be my God. Amen. &gt;&gt; What kind of God is that that allows the all the men of the family to die and to have nobody to support you and to be reduced to a bitter life? I tell you what, that woman had, she spoke faith, &gt;&gt; your God will be my God. &gt;&gt; Even though he's allowed us to come into to to be reduced to absolutely nothing, &gt;&gt; there's nothing in this world that shall move me &gt;&gt; from this. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why God could make her the mother of kings. &gt;&gt; That's the key, friends, to her success. &gt;&gt; And she said it in a phrase and she said this phrase speaking to her mother-in-law to Naomi because Naomi was giving her instruction, some very basic instruction about gleaning and about her how she shall act around Boaz. And she and this is what Ruth said. And she said unto her, and now I want you to memorize memorize this. All that thou sayest unto me, I will do. &gt;&gt; I spoke to thee &gt;&gt; with a voice out of heaven. &gt;&gt; This isn't even Naomi. This is God Almighty. I've spoken to you. I have vindicated the voice so that you might know. It's not a man. So I did it in such a way so you would know that this is a voice from heaven. &gt;&gt; And if she could say this to Naomi, surely we can say to our heavenly father, "All that thou sayest, I will do." [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's unqualified. It's not if things go good. Not if things get better. Not if I have something, you know, nicer, whatever more. It's not connected to that. &gt;&gt; It's what you say I will do. &gt;&gt; And I'll leave the consequences with you. I don't even pay attention. People, listen, I'm going to be flat. I I don't I don't even read Facebook. I heard more about things that are I heard more things down there that I I didn't know anything on about going on in the message. Well, I said, "Where'd you get it?" Well, the Facebook. I don't read Facebook. &gt;&gt; I do not read Facebook. &gt;&gt; I have invitations all the time to get onto this LinkedIn or whatever it is. This one wants you as a friend. That one wants you as a friend. So on so forth. You already have me as a friend. I don't need somebody to be there. Just send me a note. &gt;&gt; Send me an email or something. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't let me get on to that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't need my information to come from that channel. &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's clear. &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's undiluted. &gt;&gt; I have a channel that's not going to deceive me or disappoint me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It'll be good for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good for all of us. &gt;&gt; But Ruth had experienced these things. She said, "All that thou sayest unto me, I will do." Now, the Bible tells us, and you don't have to turn to it, please, but just listen closely because I won't have time to go where I want to go. I was actually disappointed this morning knowing that I wouldn't get where I want to probably get. And Boaz is speaking to Ruth. Now this different kind of instruction. The key to her success is that in her utter despair and poverty and famine. She said, "Whatever you say, that's what I'm going to do." And now we have a prophet saying that was the old Orthodox church. And here's a Moabitis that has no promise. &gt;&gt; No inheritance. &gt;&gt; I hope you could. Now, you senior people get this. This woman has no inheritance in Israel. &gt;&gt; Zero. &gt;&gt; She has no right to anything. &gt;&gt; But she has chosen this land and this people &gt;&gt; and she knew that this is an Israelite. &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow this one &gt;&gt; and their God will be my God. &gt;&gt; That's the choice I'm making. And wherever you go, that's where I'm going to go. Wherever this message leads me, that's where I'm going to go. I want to be under the blessing. I want to be under the halo light. I want to be under the glory of God. Whatever that is, &gt;&gt; however he chooses &gt;&gt; to glorify himself, that's where I'm going to be. And that is why the first words of the first words of Boaz was don't go in another field. &gt;&gt; Don't go in another field. &gt;&gt; Don't even look at another field. He said, &gt;&gt; "We're not looking for another message. We're not looking for some great spontaneous thing. Don't even look at another field." You say, "Well, that's mind control." Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And who's controlling it? That's who I want to control it. &gt;&gt; I don't want some book or some magazine or something on the internet or something you Googled. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing how how it affects you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I know I'm speaking truth and I know I'm speaking right down to you. And I want you to say that. I want you to know in your heart this is not coming from brother Ed Bisll. &gt;&gt; And if this doesn't coordinate with the message and with the word of God, then don't hear it. But if it is the word of God, then hear it. &gt;&gt; It's a voice &gt;&gt; that I might instruct you. And he's giving you hearing so that you can actually absorb it &gt;&gt; and receive it. And he said, "Now it is true that I am thy near kinsman. How be it, there is a kinsman nearer than I." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it was the devil. &gt;&gt; And the reason why it was the devil, now I need your 100% attention. The reason why it was the devil is because your first parents, your first parents, Eve, the first mother, she talked to the serpent before she even talked to God. &gt;&gt; She talked to the serpent even before she talked to her husband about this tree of knowledge. And so our first parents brought us this life. And your prophet said, "You had a sexual birth." And that birth was by a woman, by a mother. It's a blessed thing in God's sight. A mother. But by that birth, we all will die. Right? &gt;&gt; There'll be no one here that will survive that birth unless you are born again. &gt;&gt; And to be born again is not to just come to a certain church. It's not just to adopt a certain kind of lifestyle. To be born again is that the spirit of God &gt;&gt; comes and takes the seed of God. Something you hear. That's why it was so important. It said, "I caused you to hear." Yes, &gt;&gt; you need to hear what is being spoken. And almighty God, his spirit is here in this building and and on the internet to cause the people to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've given you ability to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't you're not just coming to church now. You've come here to hear. &gt;&gt; And by that hearing will come some change. And so he said to her, he said, "I'm thy kinsman, but there's a nearer kinsman." And because because Adam and Eve were raised and created in the image of God, and before, now follow me close. And God had commissioned them, multiply and replenish the earth. Multiply what? Produce more of yourself. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are in the image of God. Produce more like you. &gt;&gt; They were not they were not created to die. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God only gave them one one commandment. And he said, "In the day thou eatest thereof, you shall die or you'll be separated from me." Or, as the prophet stated very clearly, you need to hold this please in your heart. You will lose your inheritance. You'll lose your life and he said in the breach, Adam lost his life and his inheritance in life. &gt;&gt; Now that's very important. Two things. You lose your life and your inheritance in life. &gt;&gt; And so Boaz says there's this nearer kinsman. And when and when Eve listened and the fall came and I won't go into the details. The fall came and all of us are here now as birthed in human life with a human spirit and a dying body. &gt;&gt; All of us are in that state. And the prophet says in the invisible union of the bride that that was our first union. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are united by natural birth. &gt;&gt; And I will call it because of a union. I'll just say a husband. Your first husband &gt;&gt; which came through the fall. We were united and Satan took control. And this is Satan's Eden. This is Satan is the ruler of the &gt;&gt; of the power of the air. &gt;&gt; Is that Are you right with me? &gt;&gt; And we're in this world and we can't get out and we all have a human nature. We all have human attributes and certain struggles and all kind always waring and we can say with other men and even uh the prophet himself the greatest the person that has the greatest problem with is himself &gt;&gt; and I think we all can say that &gt;&gt; that's our number one we don't have to point any direction it's number one right here &gt;&gt; and we can never never ever We can never better ourselves just with by our own what is the word re uh we can't we can't just improve ourselves through some improvement program or or some human effort. Listen, there's a I'm perhaps saying a lot here, but I was just looking uh for a certain thing over, you know, the change for better and all the rest of it. And I read a little clip. It's just recent news of last week, this this last week. And a man, he's 48 years old, and the woman he was living with, they were not officially married, but she was 46. And they had an hour-long radio show, and they were co-hosts of this well-known radio show called The Pursuit of Happiness. and he was well educated and so on and she was a psycho uh psychotherapist and so and they talking about how to have inner strength and how to find yourself and how to find all inner strength and all that. I know that that whole thing is just a bunch of taboo because here I am a little preacher preaching here but the deeper you look in yourself the darker it just becomes unless you're born again. Right? &gt;&gt; Unless you're truly born again. &gt;&gt; But if you go to the human side and say, "Well, I'll try to find my inner strength." Happy, happy darkness. &gt;&gt; That's all you're going to find. A just a total darkness in there. And human ability isn't going to do it. &gt;&gt; And that is Satan's that Satan's tactic is so cunning. Those people. Anyway, this too. I'll just end it right here. It was it just shocked the entire nation. It was on CNN and I just I saw it on my computer in a news item. I did didn't read or didn't see anything. I just read the article and they both they both put a a bag over their heads, plastic bag over their head and fed helium in there and died uh committed suicide holding hands. And here they are telling the whole nation and the world how to be happy. &gt;&gt; How bizarre. Do you know what that is? That's the epitome of what Satan &gt;&gt; wants to do. &gt;&gt; He wants to lead people to death one way or another. &gt;&gt; And to them that they thought that was the best way out, I suppose. And other people, he's got all kinds of other things. If you want to, you know, have success, he'll give success to you. if you want to have nice things or have beauty or have this or have that and and he'll just keep feeding that human thing until a person comes to the realization, I'm a scoundrel. &gt;&gt; I'm lost. &gt;&gt; I need to be born again. &gt;&gt; And so this nearer kinsman, don't let me help help me here just so I can stay with this. this nearer kinsman. He said he's he he's a nearer kinsman than I. And then he said unto the kinsman, then Boaz went to this kinsman, and he said to this kinsman, Naomi that is come again out of the country of Moab sellth a parcel of land. I wanted to have this on the up on the screen, but you'll have to listen. Exercise your mind. She sellth a parcel of land, which was her br which was our brother IMC her husband. And I thought to advertise thee, saying, "Buy it for the inhabitants and before the elders of the people of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it the parcel of land. But if thou wil not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is none to redeem it. Now the one is Boaz is the perfect type of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So he's saying to this relative and the one that we were connected to was none other than the enemy, Satan himself. and you would have never heard it, but a prophet said that was the devil. &gt;&gt; And so now there's a negotiation going on. &gt;&gt; If you'll redeem it, you redeem it. He said, I'll redeem it. The parcel of land, &gt;&gt; redeem it for yourself. And and for there is none to redeem it beside thee, and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it. Then said Boaz, what day that thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitis. &gt;&gt; Because now this girl through marriage had a certain right. She didn't have the same right that Naomi had, but she was included in the in in in the right of ownership. And you must also buy it of Ruth the Moabitth, the wife, the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. This was the problem for the nearer kinsmen. &gt;&gt; And you'll see it in a few moments. You want to follow me very very close cuz I I this is where I actually wanted to preach this morning but I wanted to give as much attention as I could to the upcoming grad. And and he said that this was the the kinsman said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar my own inheritance. Redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it. Brother Brandham said that Satan didn't believe that was the son of God at Calvary. &gt;&gt; He actually didn't believe that. &gt;&gt; And I don't know what Judas's what went through Judas mind &gt;&gt; and those that followed him. &gt;&gt; He was only represented by a whole group &gt;&gt; that came &gt;&gt; and and came to the garden. He knew where the garden was. He knew what really the message was about. and he went there, but he wasn't able to place the value on it. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, the Bible says to us that when he finally got to the communion table and got to the last supper, that they had had communions before. They had had Passover before, but when they came to this last one and then Jesus handed him the sap and that was that was like if you did that, that was like you were saying something of a to a friend. He handed him the sap and he says, "What thou doest do quickly and he ran out and the Bible says then Satan entered him." &gt;&gt; He actually became a vessel of Satan himself. &gt;&gt; And that's I'll tell you he was able now to go even further. He wasn't just he wasn't just a treasure of the group. He wasn't just leaving the group. And now he was betraying the very thing he said he believed. Say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so now this this is exactly Satan himself &gt;&gt; who went from Lucifer to the serpent and spoke to Eve and caused the fall and brought listen brought what you and I are experiencing. You're not getting younger. You're getting older. And some I don't want to get on this, but I trust we'll all go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; And I trust I'll be there, too. &gt;&gt; But if not, I could go after the service. I do not know. You could go after the service. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says you could be gone before tomorrow. &gt;&gt; We don't know. &gt;&gt; And then I ask the songwriter says, "What then? &gt;&gt; We want to know. we'll have done our best &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, he's he's dealing with this other this other near kinsman and he says, "Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning concerning redeeming and concerning changing. the two things that I said I would come not just a field. So now in life is everybody listening. Ruth had a right by their marriage to whatever assets or whatever physical uh inheritance there was that was already there material physical things that was there. If a person dies and the beneficiaries come to inherit that they will inherit whatever it is, whatever material assets there is. The thing that they don't get to inherit is what that individual may have been able &gt;&gt; to achieve by future life. Everything from the future is gone. &gt;&gt; That is where it all changes between the nearer kinsmen and Boaz. &gt;&gt; Boaz, listen now, I got to start to preach. Boaz had the seed of kings in him. &gt;&gt; The nearer kinsman did not have Oed in him. &gt;&gt; Did not have Jesse in him. did not have David in him. Obe had that in him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And so Ruth by getting Boaz would get not only what had been lost, but what would yet come. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And that's where the change was coming. &gt;&gt; She was being exchanged her sorrow for the everything that would happen. And that's what happens to a believer. &gt;&gt; Your sorrow, your past, your darkness, all the vile things are gone. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; And because this one now, this Christ, this second Adam removes us from out of the reign of the first Adam. And the second Adam produces seed, a life that the first Adam could not produce. He gave it up when he lost his inheritance. &gt;&gt; The first Adam could have said, "Move this tree." The first Adam could have spoke and had children &gt;&gt; and the prophet said that Eve that that Eve would have brought forth &gt;&gt; Christ only she was in a hurry. and was deceived. &gt;&gt; Now, I told you there was swimming water here and I've just started &gt;&gt; and so it was the future aspect. &gt;&gt; And that's why I said instruction brings about change. &gt;&gt; And the change I'm talking about is the change that our nearer command nearer kinsmen couldn't bring. &gt;&gt; There was no way. And so Satan in his in his words, this nearer kinsman says, "But uh I I can't do it." When it came to Naomi, when it came to Naomi in a parcel of grand, he said, "I'll do it." &gt;&gt; Cuz Naomi was the Orthodox Old Testament Jewish church. &gt;&gt; And they lived under the blood of bulls and goats. &gt;&gt; And they could have gone on slaying bulls of goats forever. But our future &gt;&gt; inheritance could never come by the by bulls and goats. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. &gt;&gt; If we're not born again, &gt;&gt; the future's very rugged. for not born again. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want this vile, filthy enemy called Satan, Lucifer, the serpent, the dragon. I wouldn't want him to tamper with my life. &gt;&gt; And the only hope is to be out of his kingdom and out of the kingdom of darkness and birth into another kingdom of light. &gt;&gt; And you've heard a voice from heaven. You've heard a voice with a source from heaven. &gt;&gt; Don't let the things of this world and don't let anybody in the world, I don't care who they are, whether they be family, friend, peers, associates, or who they are, don't let them tamper with that soul. &gt;&gt; Don't let them tamper with this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keep that commitment absolutely firm. Not for my sake. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't think it's for the church's sake. &gt;&gt; I'd say go and do what you want. &gt;&gt; If you're a son or daughter of God, you can't you can't let go. &gt;&gt; You just can't let go. &gt;&gt; So, the second part of this redemption, I have mentioned a time or two, but never got into it. The second part is, will you redeem Naomi and the field? Yeah, I'll redeem it. Be it known to you that when you redeem her, you got to also include &gt;&gt; Ruth the Moabitete, &gt;&gt; this gentile girl, she has a part of this, and you've got to buy her and raise up seed on the head of the dead. Jesus Christ the second Adam. Now through the first Adam we died &gt;&gt; and through the second Adam he came. That's why it was absolutely essential that the words of the prophet anchored in the womb of Mary. Let it be unto me according to thy word. There it was. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit overshadowed her. And now she had a sperm that was newly created with new blood. the blood of God. &gt;&gt; We have not been purchased by the blood of goats and animals &gt;&gt; and not not some blood of the imagination of the mind seeing Jesus suffering way back there. Yes indeed he suffered more than that of any man but more than his suffering. The thing was that there was a bloodline in him &gt;&gt; that could come no other way &gt;&gt; but by the originator &gt;&gt; of creation &gt;&gt; who created a new blood cell in the womb of that woman. &gt;&gt; And that is the blood that purchased you. &gt;&gt; That is the blood of the kinsman. &gt;&gt; And he raised that seed upon the head of the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam, you could never do it. But I, the second Adam, I have done it. &gt;&gt; And I'm raising up seed on the head of the dead. And that's what you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; So, number one, give me a few minutes. Can I have just a few minutes? &gt;&gt; So number one, redemption has two parts. &gt;&gt; All the physical estate that was lost. You say the physical estate, what was we lost? We lost our health. &gt;&gt; People here are sick. You're you're not supposed to be sick. &gt;&gt; That belonged to us in this life. &gt;&gt; Health &gt;&gt; that was ours. and a normal life. I know I speak to people, you probably got credit card debt. That that isn't what God planned. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Well, the demands of this life. That's exactly right. the demands and the whatever whatever and the enticements and you know have this free and have that free and pay nothing for 36 months and all this stuff. It's a lie. &gt;&gt; What they're not telling you is you don't pay nothing, you know, and all that time then we we'll just add it up at about 19 or 20% interest. It's just part of this whole scheme. &gt;&gt; And I I'm not going to preach on one thing or the other. I'm just saying that was not the life that God had intended. &gt;&gt; That was in this life. That was in this. But the other one, the other side, &gt;&gt; that which was is to come. &gt;&gt; You talk about change. It's an exchange. And and and what an exchange took place. And now now I read something very interesting. I want to know because and brother Brandham he he speaks about it but he doesn't he doesn't interpret it actually as such. And uh and it says and the scripture says now this was the manner in the former time in Israel concerning redeeming and changing because he offered to redeem. But if you're going to do that, then you've got to take this gentile bride. You've got to take this Moabitete woman in and and and in in this it's all part of this exchange. So they were in negotiation. And that's what he said he couldn't do. He says for to confirm all things to confirm all things. In other words, to in today we do a handshake. Say is that a deal? That's a deal. Okay. We shake hands. that symbolizes we have agreed and negotiations come to an end. But in the in the former time it says to confirm all things and this has to do with redemption. A man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor and this was a testimony in Israel. So, the nearer kinsman had to pluck off his shoe or his sandal and give it to uh Boaz that the deal is done. The negotiations are over and the fact you have my shoe tells you that the negotiations are over and I'm satisfied and we're finished and now you can go ahead and buy this estate. I looked at some Hebrew Hebrew the Hebrew people have some different thoughts about that and rabbis and so on and so forth. This is not a rabbi but they said that it had a it it had a strong symbol that because a person's shoe is something that you're in. This is the way that you're walking. This is the direction you're going. In other words, your shoe indicates your life. You've gone a certain direction. You've done done certain things. You've walked in your shoe leather and you've done certain things. when you take off a sandal and give it to another kinsman who's buying and there's a formal exchange taking place here. It was a recognition that there also be a change in the family lineage &gt;&gt; because the other part of the kinsman was he was able to raise up children on the head of the dead and that's what this nearer kinsman could not do. He said, "I will mar my Well, mar it of course. Do you know why? He's told every one of us. Every one of us. Well, uh, it'll be, you know, if you choose to go this way, &gt;&gt; it'll be harder. &gt;&gt; You'll have this to contend with and you have your friends to contend with. You'll have your family to contend with. You'll have economics to contend with. It might not all be bad, of course, but you'll have these things. And his job is to make his way look better. &gt;&gt; And the way of righteous is to look more difficult. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you do that, if I do that, it was his opinion that that would be a marred life. &gt;&gt; I can't do that. I'll mar my inheritance. And so the Bible says that Boaz took Ruth and she took he took her to wife. He he also had a direction. He didn't have a great big party garden party and say, "Oh, Naomi, it's so wonderful to have you back. I've bought you and I just can't I just I I I I just can't imagine how wonderful it's going to be to have the field back." how much more barley we're going to get. &gt;&gt; He wasn't in an interested in barley. &gt;&gt; He was interested in this gentile. &gt;&gt; Now stay with me just a moment. I'm not I'm not done there. But the prophet said, and I have the quote here. He said that Boaz came to the field. Well, perhaps I should I should just go back just a just a a a pace. The prophet said, "Our natural life here that we have is just a perversion. Our natural life here is a perversion. It really should be the right life to begin with." Amen. &gt;&gt; So there I get my point. Because of the first Adam, before he could replenish, before he could multiply, before he could bring forth, and if God intended us to come forth, we would have come forth. &gt;&gt; But before he could bring, sin fell, the fall came, thus came. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And I I had a thought, maybe it'll bless somebody. The prophet and I just finished speaking. The prophet said that Christ was in Adam and Christ was rather in Abraham and Christ was in Isaac. Christ was in Jacob and he he was coming down. I use the word descending cuz he was a descendant that came down all the way down. &gt;&gt; Are you listening real close? Weren't you thinking now? Everyone &gt;&gt; that was a type of him. Their whole life was a type of him that was coming down and through them was actually descending in time coming down down down. Every one of them was assigned to death. &gt;&gt; Every one of them had the sentence of death on them. &gt;&gt; You agreeing with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so they were bringing Christ. They reflected Christ in all of these things. And Boaz and Ruth, what he would buy and so on. He comes all the way down. And when he's born, he's born. He's They didn't bring him down. In other words, he descended. They descended. They brought him down. &gt;&gt; But their con their their end was death. So he had to go to death. &gt;&gt; But he was they were not only sentenced to death by their first birth as you and I. We were sentenced to hell. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So he didn't stop his descent at Calvary. &gt;&gt; He continued to go down to their penalty. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he descended into hell itself. &gt;&gt; And he stripped the keys off of &gt;&gt; the devil. &gt;&gt; He'd stripped the keys of death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; And he rose victorious, the conqueror over all of that. &gt;&gt; And they brought him down to the sentence. They brought him in the descent, but he brought them up in his ascent. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They just he brought they brought the descent and he brought them up in the ascent and he emptied out paradise. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says it so clearly they said who is this? Who is they weren't even sure what was happening and they were certainly were not sure in his descending. As I said to you, Joseph didn't know it. Ruth didn't know it. Do you think that for a moment, friends, that Ruth knew or had a clue that she would be the mother of of the kings? &gt;&gt; And we do you think that she knew that she even had an inkling or a whisper or a hint that her name would be in the book of life? &gt;&gt; In the book of the of the book of the New Testament, that she'd be in Matthew the first chapter. Are you with me, friends? And I'll say as I've been saying to a few other people and you don't know. &gt;&gt; You do not know what your life today is meaning in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; We do not know it. &gt;&gt; We live like they lived. You say, "Well, I know that it gets quiet because everybody wants to be hoop h forget it. &gt;&gt; It's just a plain old rugged life. You just live and work and pay your bills and try to be honest and try to be good and it's you're testifying to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But you need to have and have in your heart that I have made my resolve. I'm headed for the kingdom &gt;&gt; and nothing shall change that. &gt;&gt; I have heard a word from God. I've heard a voice out of heaven. I'm receiving my instruction from that source. I'm being instructed. I'm being admonished. I'm being corrected. I'm receiving all I'm being molded. I'm being punished when necessary. But it's all good. &gt;&gt; And we need that. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. The dear hensman, the near kinsman didn't have OED in him. The name Oed is serving. He didn't have serving in him. He didn't have Jesse. Jesse is I possess. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You even got that very spirit in you. I possess. &gt;&gt; I have existence. &gt;&gt; I have substance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They didn't have David in him. &gt;&gt; David the beloved, the beloved of God. didn't have it in him. But this one who bought you had all of him in him. &gt;&gt; Plus, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll just leave this with you. Brother Pram says that when Boaz came to the field, you might think I listen, I was I was I was almost thinking I'm off in some distant place. I put so much emphasis on the message, not the intricacies of, you know, so many things within the message. To me, it's what I'm simple. I'm a simple man. When I see something and I see that God and I sense it, I can feel it and I see that God is doing supernatural thing. To this day, if you want to take a lesson, if if I depart this world before the next service, you'll remember this. If I were one of you young men, I would just love to be and love to have your strength and your youth. And I tell you, I would still tear around the world and tell people everywhere about what I've heard and what I've seen &gt;&gt; and tell them about this message. &gt;&gt; You may wonder why I've been out going out. You know, I'm sorry. on one hand uh uh we are having invitations invit people are trying to say something invitations right now from Zimbabwe one came day before yesterday from Mexico City supposed to go to the Ukraine in November don't worry I'm not I'm not going have no intention brother Tim is going to preach the convention in uh aren't you brother Tim this is point of the world in November and and and Holland and and uh Belgium, Germany there. I think that's at least he'd been invited and they wanted to know if I could come and pay a visit as well. You know, they just they're trying trying to people wanting to say something churches down in Texas and I tried everything to get out. I said, you know, November, I just I really would like to get out of the meeting out of out of out of down in Dallas. And and Brother McGary drove 3 and 1/2 hours and 3 and 1/2 hours back, 7 hours to spend 2, three hours to let me know he wasn't going to let me out of that. And I hadn't even committed. people wanting to say something or not trying to they're wanting to say something. They wanted to be greeted. They want me to greet you. Not just a greeting saying the echo, friends. The testimony and I want to encourage you. I I don't think you need encourage. I want it to I want it to explode from within the testimony that you uphold and sitting here in this seat in this service or any other service. You are you are testifying &gt;&gt; of the strength of the message that what you believe. &gt;&gt; There's no wavering there. There must be no wavering &gt;&gt; in the true bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because the there was no wavering in Ruth &gt;&gt; where did she well you know if things go this way and I I don't know I just want to check this out. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; She said I'm going with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. or find the denominational churches went back. And incidentally, when people leave this message, there's only one place to go. &gt;&gt; Back to their gods. &gt;&gt; If you read the scripture now, I'm giving you the scripture. They went back to their gods. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They never just leave. They go back to their gods. Say, "Well, I know some they backslid in the world." That's their gods. That's right. &gt;&gt; And Orpa, who is the type of the denominational church, and the scriptur is very clear, she went back to her gods. &gt;&gt; And Ruth didn't have any gods. &gt;&gt; Whoever is the god of Naomi, your god will be my god. &gt;&gt; She wasn't even sure who that god was. &gt;&gt; But that was her. That was her confirmed statement. &gt;&gt; Oh, that the bride of Jesus Christ sitting here this morning will say the same thing. The God of Elijah will be my God. I don't know where this message is going to lead me. The God that brought this word shall be my God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I've done this before. I'll do it again because I think and I'm just going to leave now and close. This is God's last will in testament. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to do? This is his last will in testament. He's not going to change his mind about it. Right. &gt;&gt; What you have, what you have physically in physical natural blessings, that's all fixed. He's told about it here. &gt;&gt; And what you will get, he hasn't told everything. But this is a will. And apostle Paul says that a test a testament a will is not effective sir &gt;&gt; until the testator dies. &gt;&gt; That's why he had to come in flesh to die. &gt;&gt; And as soon as he died it made the will effective. As soon as he died, the will is effective. &gt;&gt; And the will goes into the hands of the executive &gt;&gt; and the executive, he came back so he could be executive to his own will. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Because I live." &gt;&gt; He wasn't talking about the life along the shores of Galilee. Because I live. I've gone through death. I've come back in the resurrection. Because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Now, what's he talking about? He's talking about the changing part. &gt;&gt; Not just the natural part, but the changing part that the nearer kinsman couldn't give us &gt;&gt; because he didn't have the bloodline [Applause] &gt;&gt; and when the testator dies, the will becomes effective. And so now I'll just bring it down to what you understand. Say that someone that has included you in their will, they died. you you you just have whatever you had an hour ago, 10 minutes ago. That that's what you have. That's what you own. And you're called into a lawyer's office and he opens up the will. And to my wife, I leave the family home. Maybe it's in his name, but by virtue of this, now it's hers. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this? This is just ink on paper. &gt;&gt; What is this? &gt;&gt; Ink on paper. &gt;&gt; But this has been confirmed, vindicated. &gt;&gt; If supernatural God wrote it, so a supernatural God came and showed it's me that has said these things. &gt;&gt; I'll send a man who's only had a seventh grade education. I'll send it to the most educated generation of all history. And I'll have him speak things that you have to believe. And if you turn that one down, you're lost. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because God can do no more. &gt;&gt; He confirmed it to the eenth degree. &gt;&gt; And so he says, "And to my son, I'll leave the car and the farm tractor and the farm. and to my daughter, I'll leave the condominium or the the cottage at the lake. Those people came in just being who they are, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Without that ownership, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they didn't know what they were going to have. They didn't know about what father's going to say, I give it all to the, you know, uh, Salvation Army or some other charity. No, now they hear. They hear by a valid voice &gt;&gt; who reads paper, words on paper &gt;&gt; that you now own a house or a condominium or a cottage. You now own it. And when you walk out that door, you're the owner of something &gt;&gt; that you didn't own when you walked in. So in the revealing of Jesus Christ, when Jesus Christ Jesus Christ himself said, and here's my closing words, Jesus Christ said to the whole world, when you see the days of Lot once again, when you see Sodom, when you see &gt;&gt; just the other day, &gt;&gt; they unfurled at a Canadian army base, &gt;&gt; a gay pride flag and respect of all of the gates. What about the Christian flag? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many Christians are here? I feel insulted, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We don't need a flag to say what our sexual orientation is. &gt;&gt; What kind of nonsense? Why does this have to come forward? There's a spirit behind it driving it &gt;&gt; because this word says that would happen. And we don't want to be ignorant. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that happening? &gt;&gt; And it's pervading everywhere &gt;&gt; in everything. &gt;&gt; And when you see the days of Noah, I'm going to come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show myself &gt;&gt; in a spectacular way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And furthermore, I will have a valid voice that you can hear with your own ears. &gt;&gt; And in that voice, I will I will confirm and I will seal it with a supernatural sign so that you'll know that this sign cannot be questioned. &gt;&gt; And that sign is saying that this is the mouth &gt;&gt; that is supposed to say the things. And those things are concerning the changing part. The part that we didn't have in natural life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Understand that's very clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what this ministry is all about. &gt;&gt; I don't have all the answers, but do you mind if I just tell you things that I'm wondering about? &gt;&gt; He said, "Pluck off your shoe." as a symbol that this exchange is taking place. Moses when he came before the burning bush and this is the first encounter &gt;&gt; that a human that's dying is having with the eternal God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And God is going to tell him, "I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "He's the God of the living, not of the dead." &gt;&gt; And a man who is dying is standing before the pillar of fire. And the pillar of fire, the voice, you never saw it, &gt;&gt; but the voice out of the pillar of fire says, "Take off your shoes. &gt;&gt; This is holy ground." &gt;&gt; And not only holy ground, but they were negotiating. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send you. I've heard their cry. I'm going to send you because there was going to be a change of family lines. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be raised in Egypt anymore. I'm taking them out for people for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in this day, I'll tell you, there went on some negotiation between the prophet of God and almighty God. &gt;&gt; He he he didn't want to go. I said, "I'll I'll give you two signs like I gave Moses. I'll give you two signs." &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, friend, this voice is so valid. This voice is so vindicated. This voice is so come from the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Because he came with a sign that he's going to change our family lines. &gt;&gt; And this prophet said he didn't come from Ella and Charlie Brham. And when he found out he came from God, &gt;&gt; when this prophet finally said, "You're a gene of almighty God, you came out of the very loins of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Like you were in your grandfather, like you were in your father, you came out of the loins of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that matters. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. G. &gt;&gt; And we've heard things in the message we've never heard before. &gt;&gt; There's no place there's no message on earth that can tell you you never sinned in the first place. Why? That's part of the negotiation. You tell them. &gt;&gt; You tell them they are the spotless, virtuous bride of Jesus Christ. I'm changing the family lines. &gt;&gt; And then the negotiation went on with the prophet of God. And he come to the end of his ministry and spoke a message that the people needed to hear. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm over my time. What a message. &gt;&gt; What a message we have. &gt;&gt; We don't have to pump it up. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; We don't have to even try to make something out of it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We just have to tell the people what it is. &gt;&gt; Say what it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's Let's just stand and thank him. Oh, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the day that you've given us, &gt;&gt; for the word that you've given us. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't even know how to handle it. Oh, God. Sometime we feel so unworthy to take it up. We feel so unworthy to even begin to speak about it. &gt;&gt; But I hear the people have come. &gt;&gt; They've driven miles. They've heard, oh God, and something has spoken to them. I pray, oh God, there will be decisions and there'll be choices.
