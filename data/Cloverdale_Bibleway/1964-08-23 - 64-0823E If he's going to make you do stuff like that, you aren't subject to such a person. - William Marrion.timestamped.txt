[0:00] all right now that's scripture also
[0:03] brother Brandon I believe a woman should
[0:06] be subject to her husband but if a
[0:10] Christian woman has a sinner husband who
[0:13] does not
[0:15] even to one of your services come to one
[0:18] of your services and want and wants his
[0:22] wife to be doing things cutting her hair
[0:25] wearing shorts and going to ungodly
[0:28] places even is this woman supposed to be
[0:32] subject to this man in this way please
[0:35] explain this more clearly as this is a
[0:39] question that is asked often no sister
[0:44] you are not subject to such a person no
[0:47] indeed for this cause you'll leave
[0:50] everything in cleave to God now the
[0:52] thing if you want that man wants to live
[0:54] with you and you be stay a Christian but
[0:57] if he's going to make you wear shorts
[1:00] cut your hair and do all these other
[1:01] things in ungodly places you seek first
[1:04] the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[1:06] you're not bound to such a person as
[1:08] that but as long the Bible says as she
[1:12] is pleased and he is pleased to dwell
[1:14] together you remember that let them and
[1:18] now these I didn't put the scriptures
[1:19] out because I just picked them up you
[1:20] see if a few minutes ago I pick up one
[1:22] now and then that I haven't got time but
[1:24] Paul said that as long as they
[1:26] unbelieving husband has unbelieving or
[1:28] believing wife or so forth let the
[1:30] believing wife remain with the believing
[1:31] husband as long as is not contrary now
[1:34] to God if he's pleased to dwell with her
[1:37] go ahead honey if you want to go to
[1:38] church that's all right but I ain't
[1:39] going I don't believe in I don't have
[1:41] nothing to do with it but you go ahead
[1:42] that's all right but when he says you
[1:44] can't do it there's a different thing
[1:47] you're not bound to that then you
[1:49] separate everything for God
