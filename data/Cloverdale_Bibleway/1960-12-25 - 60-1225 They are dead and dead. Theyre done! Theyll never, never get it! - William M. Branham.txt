Description:
60-1225 God's Wrapped Gift-4: William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they gone back the sleeping virgins going back to B us tomorrow but that's when he come while they were going after it so how close are we now when we see these great churches going back say well maybe we've left off something we better find it they'll never get it just remember that they'll never never get it they're dead and they'll dead and dead and that's all they'll never come to life just remember I speak in the name of the Lord amen this is Hallelujah they'll never never come to life praise our God you're done so that's reason I'm not interested in in programs
