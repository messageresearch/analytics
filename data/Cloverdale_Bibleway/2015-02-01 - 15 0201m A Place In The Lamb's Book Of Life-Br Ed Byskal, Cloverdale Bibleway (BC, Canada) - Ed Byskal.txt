I'm going to ask for brother Tom Ray will come open the service for us in a word of prayer. Amen. We do have a couple requests we want to remember before the Lord this morning. Amen. Do you believe he's here to grant your request this morning? Amen. Brother Milos says, "Last week we prayed for brother Franco and his wife. She got instantly better after we prayed for her." Praise the Lord. The same God. Wonderful. Amen. So, let's just believe for our sister Patty Pettingale. She's homesick today. Requesting prayer for healing. Our brother Richard Drake also asking we would please pray for sister Barb Drake who's also homesick this morning. Amen. And maybe if the brothers would come and prepare for the offering, if there's something on your heart that you would just like to lift before the Lord. Amen. I know that he sees. Brother Bram says it's an act of faith even to raise your hand. Amen. Showing that you believe that God sees that. Amen. Brother Tom, would you come please? How many are approaching God this morning in faith? Faith. Amen. Faith is our victory this morning. We stand on the promises of God for their yay and amen to them that believe. Heavenly Father, we approach your throne of grace with great boldness. We come under the shed blood of the lamb. We come, Lord God, approaching a living God that we can say is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, we've seen victory after victory after victory over these last weeks, months, and years. Lord, as we prayed already this morning, Lord, there's cancers that have been defeated by the power of prayer. There have been souls that have been delivered, Lord, by the power of prayer. And Lord, there's many here this morning that need that presence to come and deliver them and set them free. Lord, we have come to a risen savior. Not a God that's in the tomb, but a God that is a living Lord. A rising savior, Jesus Christ, the living word. We come and we approach your throne of grace. Lord, bless your people, heal your people, deliver your people. You said, ask abundantly that your joy be filled. We pray God that you will meet the need of every brother, every sister that is in the house of faith this morning. Those that have joined by the way of the internet. Lord, I pray that you'll anoint their faith to believe for the impossible. Lord, I remember many years ago, Brother Andy's preaching. You're a supernatural God. So, it's natural for a supernatural God to heal supernaturally. Lord, heal your people. Once again, let the bomb of Gilead come down. Let the revelation of your word come alive to your people. Let this glorious Jesus Christ that has been lifted out of the pages by Malachi 4, Lord, anoint us to believe thus saith the Lord. Would you anoint your servant? Would you anoint brother Ed? Would you anoint our ears to hear what the spirit would say to the church this morning? Let the Holy Ghost move, Lord. Let there be a great baptism of your spirit. Let the children of the Lord rejoice in your presence. God, speak to us divinely, individually, Lord. And we pray now as we take up an offering that it would not be to your glory, and to your honor. Bless those that will give, those that can't bless them abundantly, that they also, Lord, would be able to bless the bride of Christ. Lord, bless now the service, the songs, and the worship. And most of all, when the word comes, may our hearts burn within us as you will speak to us this morning along this way in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. My hope is in the Lord. Amen. Do you believe this morning? Jesus said, "Whatsoever you ask in my name, it will be given you." Amen. David says in the Psalms, "Why are you distressed, oh my soul? Hope thou in God." Amen. Why don't we sing the song, "My hope is in the Lord from this time on as we take up the offering." Amen. God bless you once again. We want to greet anyone visiting with us. Just trust that you'll feel at home in the service this morning. Amen. God bless you. I stand in awe. I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the aes living sacrifice, the only source of life, my hope is in the Lord. Oh, the sound of the I forever more. His tender mercies come. His tender mercies come with every rising sun to be the sinner to offer healing and forgive and those who trust in him. There are I rest my home is in the des forever. The horse will take in my home. to my soul. Is it Lord I never my own forever. Amen. We're just going to turn our service directly to our pastor, Brother Ed. Amen. We had a couple specials this morning, but we're just going to give Brother Ed all the time he needs this morning. Amen. Are you looking forward to the word? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. We do have a couple announcements just before our pastor comes. The American donation receipts for income tax are ready for pickup at the church office today. If you do not collect them today, it will be mailed to you. And there's a young people's this Friday, February the 6th at 7:30 here at the church. And also just once again, communion put Washington night at 4:30. Instead of the usual time of 5, we've moved it up to 4:30. Give a little more time for the service. Amen. I trust you're expecting. Amen. As our pastor comes, why don't we sing, I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed how you care. Amen. Oh, I'm amazed, Lord, that you love me. Oh, I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious love, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away all my sins. All wash away. Oh, I love me, Lord. I'm amazed at how you care.

And I believe that you care. Through your precious blood I am and my sins are washed. They all wash away all my sins. Oh, once more I believe that you love me. Lord, I see that you love me and I care through your presence, my love for and my I want you all my Let's stand. Let's sing that out again. &gt;&gt; I believe Lord that you love me. I believe that today through your presence I found and I see it all wash away. All I see are away once more. I that's I to your preious I all wash away all my sins. are away. &gt;&gt; Let's just give him thanks as we pray together. Heavenly Father, how thankful we are, oh God, that we can stand as recipients of your grace, your mercy, your longsuffering, oh God, and as recipients of eternal life through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. Thank you for taking our penalty at Calvary. Oh God, we're so thankful for Calvary. We're so thankful for your your children, Lord, that have received this redemption. And now, oh God, how you have manifested and revealed yourself in this hour. I pray you'll take your word this morning, Lord. Take, oh God, your servants. I pray both those that hear and I that have to speak. I pray you will anoint oh God the thoughts and may they not be a human's thoughts may they be your thoughts I pray that your special grace will be upon each one that they will see oh God their place their position and father may they move in that by the guidance and the leadership of the Holy Ghost Father we surrender ourselves to you now and we ask your blessing upon each one that's here in Jesus righteous holy name. Amen. And amen. And everybody could say amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I see brother Ben Drake. Is that right? God bless brother Ben and we followed your testimonies and what God has done for your family. We appreciate that. We're thankful for each one that is here and the the day is a full day. We're having the afternoon service at 4:30, not 5, 4:30 because we are having the Lord's table tonight and foot washing. And we have two baptisms which I think perhaps have already been announced, but we're so happy to have uh our brother Chan that's going to be baptized, Sister Leslie's husband, and uh we're so thankful for that. and uh sister Shakina Bondi, brother Peter and Anna's daughter. I am so thankful whenever I see a young person moved and want to be baptized, not because it's an emotional thing or a bunch of other people are doing it or the family's doing it, but because God has touched something. And then to have uh uh brother Chan when he heard that Sister Lesie and the children were being baptized, he uh sent word when I get back from China, I want to be baptized also. &gt;&gt; So God bless our brother Chan. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God bless Shakina. So that will be taking place tonight as well. We're thankful. It's a it's a moving God's moving. Continue to move. &gt;&gt; It's not a It's not some imagin imaginary thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, while you're standing and we have prayed, we're going to turn to the word and uh I'm continuing on. I'll just remind you, I won't give a summary so much, but I'm going to continue on from the scripture where God said to Moses, Moses said, "I'd like to see your face. Show me your glory." And uh the Lord spoke to him and said, "You can't see my face." Uh it's it's really quite interesting and amazing that in Revelation then the last the last of the seven descriptions of his personage was his face his countenance. That was the last of the seven. And when a person saw met a person face to face that's when you had the most intimate conversation. Now, now there's no secret or mystery or who it is you're dealing with. And uh and in Revelation, that was the one thing that the bridegroom was determined to do is make her know who this is. &gt;&gt; And thus, he would open up the seals and reveal himself and unveil himself and let us see that this is that this is the mighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In all of his beauty. And so uh but when Moses said I want to see show me your glory and uh brother Tim do spoke about the glory of the Lord and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock. So we spoke about the various places there's your home is a place and you've left there and you've come here and you're in a place. Uh you may have an opportunity and that will be a a certain position in a place or you may be educated to a certain level and and then you are from this place to that place and uh and then the Bible tells us that Jesus was given the book and he found the place where it was written &gt;&gt; and what he read was written of him. And now I'm going to ask you &gt;&gt; if you have found your place &gt;&gt; in the Lamb's book of life. That's what I'm going to be speaking about. Our place in the Lamb's Book of Life. So we'll read some of the same scripture in Luke the 4th chapter and we'll start at verse 16. And if you have difficulty following uh I don't blame you. But I would ask you to seriously uh follow the continuity because I'm going through a lot of different scripture but they are all tied together. So follow the continuity please. And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. That's verse 16. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, please notice, he found the place where it was written. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And if you look back in Isaiah 61, I believe it is, and two, you'll find that he broke the the verse right in half. And he did not refer to the second part of the verse because that was part of his second coming to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And please notice and he closed the book and gave it to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." The Bible says that they wondered at the gracious words that came out of his lips. And then they said, "Is not this Joseph's son?" Now, because he closed the book, they didn't know who it was that was speaking. Maybe I lost you. I don't think so. He opened the book and he read what he was. He identified himself. Then he closed the book. I don't want to major on that, but he closed the book. But if you just read a few verses down, and then he began to speak and identify God working back there and here. And the Bible says, "And they were filled with wrath." &gt;&gt; That wasn't from the open book. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that wasn't a result of the open book. They were filled with wrath. They had not recognized him. And he was standing right there. &gt;&gt; So God bless you as you have your seats. Now I have some slides and in in these slides it will be I will be making references to some of the same things we're going to read. But this is to help you get to where I want to get as fast as possible. So, we just dim the lights a wee bit, please. And so, now this is what we're going to be talking about. We have the written book. We have the sealed book. We have the claimed book. And we have the open book. We're be covering those subjects. And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written, a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. And he came and took the book. He claimed it &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And I saw another mighty angel, this is Revelation 10 now, come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. Prophet says all the way through that's Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now he's now it's the same Christ when he was here on earth. He found the place in the book. &gt;&gt; Now he's descending and coming coming with a certain purpose and he had in his hand a little book open. Now it's not closed. &gt;&gt; It's not only written. &gt;&gt; It's not only taken and claimed. &gt;&gt; It's not only opened. It's not but it but now he's going to reveal it. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth. So now we won't get lost in that. You young people, you just listen close and we'll follow these other Revelation 20 uh chapter 20. Now we're at the end of this book and the one you have in your hand. We're getting to the closing of it to chapter 20 11 and 12. And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works. &gt;&gt; Here's what brother Brandham said now. And this I believe is none other. This is in the invisible union. Union. God wants to unite you. &gt;&gt; Amen. into an invisible union. We don't have a book for you to sign out there. We don't have a fellowship card for you to sign. But this is a union. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to have a union. There's a place by him. &gt;&gt; He's inviting you to a place. &gt;&gt; Make yourself known to me, Lord. Reveal yourself to me. And he'd like to say to you, there is a place &gt;&gt; by me. And thou shalt stand upon a rock. Life is a sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book. Book of life. Life is a sacred thing. God is the author of life. I'd like you to notice author as well. He said, "Do you believe that our natural life here we have is just a perversion. That's why you have so much trouble with it. It really should be the right life to begin with. But it was perverted by natural birth. Your name of your first nature that was a natural birth was born and put in a in a book of life. All your deeds were wrote in it too. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book called the book of life. Well, you se while you separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are born again or remarried again to the new spiritual union of not your natural life of the things of the world but of eternal life. That germ that was in you at the beginning found you. &gt;&gt; It's gone before you were born. That it's the seed that was in you. The germ that was in you at the beginning found you. Now that's now is different. Now your old book is gone with your old union and now your name of your old in your and he breaks it has been transferred. Now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book he said God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness. You stand perfectly before God. &gt;&gt; Now your name is in the new book. &gt;&gt; Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. It sounds like two books, but he said the same book and one runs out to the other like a stock of wheat. It's not a little blade anymore. It's not just a stock anymore. It's not just a head anymore. But now it's a full mature wheat within the husk. And now your name is in the new book. Not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed. That's what changed it. Say, not the old book of your o of of your natural union, but your new bride. He says, hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. Hallelujah. where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold. Now you're not only forgiven, but you're justified. &gt;&gt; Amen. I think that's as far as I want to go there. Yes. I'll leave that last one, please. So that gives you the theme. I want to say that every book is uh written by an author. There has to be an author to a book. Uh and there are different categories of books. I had a wonderful experience this last week and I I I trust that God will share some of that with you. Not in my speaking but in his presence. I had a very very unexpected visitation, unexpected visitor. It was him. I was just reading something. I was just in my middle of my studies and I felt that I need to tell you this and uh it's just as common and uneventful as it is perhaps right this morning. And I was just sitting in front of my computer and I was I started to read uh a few lines in a in a message because I was looking up this part right now. I said, "Well, there's different categories of a book. There's uh and every book has an author. There's books of fiction and non-fiction. And they say that fiction is something imaginary. Fiction is something that's been contrived and dreamed up in a person's mind. And it concerns events, imaginary events and imaginary people. And I thought I come from the mind of God. And the presence, the presence of the author just enveloped me. And I bowed my head in that holy sacred presence. And I began to weep. And then then different songs came to my mind. And I was in a state of almost euphoria of some kind for about two hours. I tell you friend, he's a real person. &gt;&gt; It's not just a dead dry book. &gt;&gt; This message that we talk about is a living person. &gt;&gt; He's called Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And the message that I started to read was, "What think ye of Christ? And we haven't got time this morning, but you go home and get that. It was 1953 in Chicago. And he asked the people and he said, "This is what they said of him. What do you think of Christ?" This is what his friends said. This is what his enemies said. Now we go through what his enemies said of him. And they all testified of Christ. And he goes all through and now to the people. What think ye of Christ? He was in the message of testimony of telling of the raising of the dead boy in Finland. I had a man in my home that visited that boy. He now was a policeman in the uh patrol patrol policeman in Finland. And brother Nino, I believe it was, who was actually living with at my daughter Marilyn and her husband Mike at the time on the island. He was living in their basement. And we had him over for Christmas and he took the picture of the boy out. He said, "Have you seen this?" I said, "Of course." That's the boy that was raised from the dead in Finland. He said, "Well, I was just visiting him in Finland." And he said, "He's a policeman now." And he's the boy that was raised from the dead. Brother Brandham is telling the account of when the boy was struck, two boys on a bicycle. And the woman, a sister in her work in Finland, met the woman whose husband drove that car that struck the bicycle. I haven't time to go into it, but brother Brandham said, "When I when I got out and looked at the little fellow, I tell you, I thought my heart would break. I started to go away like that. said, "Now, this sounds like fiction, but it isn't, friends. There are things in this message that sound like it's fiction, &gt;&gt; because it's of another place. &gt;&gt; If it's it's another realm, it's another world. It's another power. It's another being, &gt;&gt; not of this world. And you cannot take it into a human mind and think that you're going to understand it all. It's it the prophet said it'd be even for God to make himself known and be too mystical. You wouldn't be able to understand it. It sounds like it's mystery almost and it is to this life. But it's a real person. &gt;&gt; And I want to declare to you today he's able to come to you personally &gt;&gt; to your place to your seat where you are today. Don't put it somewhere else. It's not somewhere else. He's everpresent. He's Jesus Christ, the same yesterday and today, always today and forever. You believe that? He knows exactly where you are. He knows exactly what you need. And as I said last time I spoke on this. There were people who came before the prophet of God who thought they had a certain need. But then he said, "But your real need is you're not saved. Your real need is you need the Holy Ghost." And he identified the real need. They thought it was the arthritis or the TB or something else. But your real need, I thank God he knows our real need today. And in this what thinking of Christ he says then I can hear the angels. He was describing the marriage supper and it was right at this moment that the presence of the author came in and then he says I hear the angels move back and bow their heads and I look and come out walking yonder from behind those doors. There he comes, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, walk down along the table and wiping each one's eyes and putting his arm around them and say, "Now, don't cry. It's all over now. All of them is here. There's not any of them gone. &gt;&gt; They're all here. &gt;&gt; Now, enter into the joys of the Lord." He said, "I know my heart jumps when I think of it." &gt;&gt; He just exactly how you are. He's in a body like you. You know, prophet of God just has the same troubles and problems everybody has. But he's in a place where he says, "Oh, my heart just jumps when I think of it." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's not a little fiction story of Santa Claus." He said, "That's thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Tell you, there's a big difference between a fiction story and thus sayaith the Lord. &gt;&gt; And this th this sayith the Lord may sound fiction, but it's not fiction, friends. &gt;&gt; And he says that's the seed that's right now becoming materialized right now. It it's moving in. Friends, my thoughts have gone into such directions. I trust I can make it real to you. But that's the seed. I will just drop this in. He said that's the seed that's becoming materialized right now. It's moving in. Well, I just want to just drop something in that I hope I'll come back to later on. Whether you young people are in school or whether some of you are in other higher grade, higher places of education or whether you are in a church, you're hearing a word. Words are seeds. You're going to be the product of what you hear. If you hear unbelief, you'll be an unbeliever. If you hear doubt, you'll be a doubter. If you hear faith, you'll be faithfilled with faith. If you hear those things that have been revealed, it will be materialized within you. &gt;&gt; And the book had to be open to bring forth another germitized seed for the people of this age that they might receive that seed. Not a dead denominational seed, but that seed. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? There are multitudes of people today in churches everywhere. And you might say, "Well, do you think that you that you have it? We better have it. &gt;&gt; You better have it. You better have that confidence. You better know in whom you've believed." The apostle says, "We are not of those." They knew who they were. They knew who they heard. You have to know where you stand. You have to know that you're in the right place at the right time and you have the right person made known to you. This is not some Jesus of history. This is a Jesus Christ that's revealed himself that took this book into his hand, opened it, and sent the word down through his vindicated messenger. He spoke the word. We receive that word. And you are a transformed person by that word. &gt;&gt; That's how it happens. And it doesn't happen. That's God's program. &gt;&gt; Every book has an author. As I said a moment ago, and in the rapture message, he said the book of Revelation is the last book of the Bible. It's sealed to unbelievers. In there the Bible says in 22nd chapter whosoever shall take one word from it or add one word I'll take his part from the book of life. We realize that then it is altogether given for believers. I have this underlined and it opens the book of revelation and reveals the author. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the church say praise God. It reveals the author &gt;&gt; of this entire book. And he's the one. He's the alpha and the omega from Genesis to Revelation in modern events made clear by prophecy. It's two days later. He says, "And this book is the book of prophecy. Its believers are commanded to honor it &gt;&gt; and to read it &gt;&gt; and to believe its author. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're commanded to read it, to honor it, and to believe its author. &gt;&gt; Every book has an author. &gt;&gt; We don't just have some doctrine. We have a book that has an author. &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was here, John spoke of it. He said, "No man has seen God at any time. The only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father hath declared him." So now I want to I want to just enter into the subject please that the author to declare the author by displaying the fullness of God proving that he was God not a second person or a third person but the person &gt;&gt; and brother Brown takes a little drama and now I want to use that which I've used before. He said let's see coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make it a little white light because he said you couldn't understand. You can't comprehend God. So he's helping us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A little white light. Uh he said that went out like a mystic light, like a halo. That that was the logos that went out from God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. &gt;&gt; So now every book has to have an author. I'm speaking about your place in the lamb's book of life. There's no book like that on earth. &gt;&gt; The lamb's book of life. the book that has no sin in it. &gt;&gt; The lamb has paid the sin total judgment price and the people whose names are in that book are completely and totally sinless and justified. &gt;&gt; So much so that you never did it in the first place. And he would send a prophet messenger here to declare it to a certain people. You never did it in the first place. And he might say it to a whole group and one will say I can't believe that and sir you carry your sin with you. Other one says I believe that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By believing that &gt;&gt; we have faith in what he has spoken &gt;&gt; and what he's done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And out of the bosom of the father he said that was that was what was in the beginning was the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the word was with God, and the word was God, and the word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. In the beginning was God, and there and then out from God came the logos, a part of God that went out of God. What am I talking about? I'm talking about the author. &gt;&gt; This was the author. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He spake and said, "Let there be light." And there was nothing. And there was nothing but there was something happened and an atom turned there and began to whirl around this way. And the sun begin to come into existence because he said let there be when the prophet was speaking on uh what thinking of Christ. He said nature declared who he was. The sun stopped shining and the earth belched at the very death of the Christ and his resurrection. I tell you what, friends, everything has testified of him. &gt;&gt; Let there be. He said, and because he said, let there be, there's the authority. And I can see a piece fly off. Uh, it's a meteor, a meteor. After a few million years or a hundred billions of years, if you want to call it, it's circled way out. I see him standing there watching it and it falls down here. He said he stops it after it falls. Now, this sounds fiction, but it's not. and let it hang there in orbit. Here goes another one flying off the sun. It goes over here and hangs down. Stops it there. Said, "What's he doing?" He's writing his first Bible. &gt;&gt; Who is God? He said, "Who is God?" Are you with me, folks? Who is God? The one that stood there and rolled stars off of his hands and rolled worlds out of his hands and made the things which do not appear deity and deity himself lives in man. Do you believe that deity himself lives in man? He made he made heavens and earth and he lives in mankind. Why? No wonder cripples when you realize that they can straighten out and the creator's here. No wonder blind. Look where he's gone. Look where prophets gone in just a few moments of time. He's gone from a little white halo coming out of out of nothing. Uh coming out of God and saying that's identifies that that's the son of God. Uh that's the that's the son of God. That's the logos. That's the word of God. And that word came down and became flesh. And we and manifested that God. He had to manifest where he came from. Who is that? I'm saying today, he's the author &gt;&gt; and the finisher of our faith. &gt;&gt; And he's writing his first Bible. And now he comes right down. He said, "That's why cripples straighten out. The creator is here. No wonder the blind can see and opens up. The creator's here. And this is what I'm saying today. That's not back there. The creator is here. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. &gt;&gt; The author is one. He's a maker of anything. The author is a creator or an originator. &gt;&gt; The author of the book came himself to live out those prophecies that were written of him &gt;&gt; and he fulfilled them. No wonder he could find his place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the book of Isaiah. And no wonder he knew where to start reading and where to stop reading. And then he closed the book and the book remained closed. There were some that believed on him and they couldn't understand it, but they believed. And the author had the book in his hand. No wonder he knew. And the man who even brought the brought the book to him. He didn't realize that he was going to be put in the he was playing a part of the story, but he didn't even know what he was doing. And he didn't know the one who that was standing there was going to take the scroll and find his own place in that book. &gt;&gt; Now you'll get some idea of what the message is. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ coming from the bosom of the father full of grace and truth. And I want to say this book &gt;&gt; has no falsehood in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. This book has no questions in it. &gt;&gt; It is not that the human speaks every word just intellectually correct and politically correct. Please listen to this. You that go and get educated and have gone through years of university etc. That's not what this book, this book didn't go, this book didn't come to earth to go through university filter and come out just exactly right. This book came out to reveal the author and it's the revelation of him. You may have one revelation not different. It won't be opposing but it will produce life and changing power, transforming power in you. And it will do the same thing in me. And it's absolutely pure. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely true. &gt;&gt; And there's no falsehood in it. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. That's who he is. &gt;&gt; There's no falsehood here. &gt;&gt; And then now I just take another section. Every one included in the book of life and those who were transferred to the lamb's book of life by faith in his work. And we are here this morning. And those that are streaming, and there are many that are streaming, perhaps 150, 160 or more now live because of the time zone. And we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And we appreciate your letters come from Europe, different places. the south, Mexico, wherever, New Zealand, the other part of the world. And because brother Murphy is translating, there'll be those from China that are about 16 hours ahead from here. And I I say to you, we appreciate your letters. You send them to us. And uh for you that don't know because we don't announce it, we very rarely ever ever speak of it. I think this is perhaps the first or second time I ever mentioned it. But in the usually the week following the archive s the the streaming service, the week following is usually up to another anywhere from 3 to 400 locations within one week and then it continues on. We don't know anything about the future of that. But we're thankful that there are others that join you here that are seated here. &gt;&gt; And every age, there's part of the book that's for every age. And Jesus had to find his place in Isaiah. And then he had to then he identified a spot that was about him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he happens to be the main theme of the whole Bible. &gt;&gt; But somewhere in here is your part. &gt;&gt; So there's a whole part for an age and then there's a part for the people in that age. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now just hold that close. And then he said, "How that will be, how you will know that is when the people of that age when they see it vindicated, they see or hear it was vindicated. It was proven." In other words, the author came on the scene and said, "This is not someone else. This is me. This is the author." And then you as an individual. Now I'm coming right to your address. There's something inside that sparks. &gt;&gt; You can't explain it. It just happens. Something the light strikes the seed. We can have all kinds of things. I don't know what happened, but something something came over me. I just began to weep or I I came to an altar. I I don't understand what happened, but I was changed from then. My desires change. My appetites change. The things I once loved, I begin to hate. And the things I hated, now I love. And the people that spoke about these things, they became my people. They became my brothers. I became this. They became my family. Yeah. Something's happened, friends. This isn't a fiction. This is what the book talks about. That's a revelation. And no one can ever argue you out of that. No one can ever take it away from you. It's a revelation of the author. Not because everything was nicely said or everything was uh everything was in in in keeping and reconciling with what you used to believe. That's not it. &gt;&gt; That's not it at all. It's a it it's just something divine. It's something most glorious. It's a bridegroom making himself known to the bride. And we don't understand that even in life. We don't understand the the mystery of love and the mystery of the union of the marriage even in this world. But it's only a type of a much greater thing that's happening. &gt;&gt; And so now individuals have I must hurry because I would like to just convey this to you. He said each age had its allotted allotment of word to be fulfilled. It's one sentence out of the unfailing words of promise. And then in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride speaks of you. He said there are many that are sick and needy in the land and they haven't completed their journey. and our great enemy, not only our enemies in prayer, but he said, "Your enemy, your enemy has come to beset them and to stop their life and to send them to a premature grave." He said, "And we're asking for them today that you in your mercy and grace, Lord, will extend their days to the allotted time." You have a claim on the allotted time and Satan may come and try to make you ill. He may try to bring some debilitating disease upon you. You have a right to healing. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid for your healing. &gt;&gt; You have a right to fulfill your allotted time. &gt;&gt; And there's something that God is expecting of you. And God allotted his word to each age. And as that age comes along, here's my key now and your key. And as that age comes along, he sends someone there to vindicate that word and prove that it's true. &gt;&gt; Thus, you have the someone coming in this age saying hundreds and hundreds of times, is it true? Is it true? Is it true? Did you ever hear one say, no, it's false? No. They always said it's true. It's true. It's true. Why? Because that same voice had to take this word and even though he spoke things we do not understand, we have to say it's true. It's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let this entire congregation say it's true. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Oh, doesn't it sound wonderful? It's true and it works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a word of power. &gt;&gt; It's a transforming power. It's got enough power to transform your body and change the atoms from this world and this flesh to an immortal realm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do we believe unto that? Yes, we do. &gt;&gt; Every person &gt;&gt; is allotted a certain number of years &gt;&gt; and our deeds are written in a book. And the word, he said in the message, a token, the word has been quickened to you. &gt;&gt; This is a key. I've I I labored over this key. My wife says, "It's not really fair. You spent so many hours and all these brothers spent hours and we have maybe an hour and a half to deliver it. So, we do our best. &gt;&gt; You pray that God will take that and quicken it to you. He said, "And the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to vindicate this age." So when you hear the message or the word of this age, well, you say, "Well, h I don't know if I've heard anything." Oh, come on. You've heard all kinds of things. You've heard the Godhead like you never heard it before. You've heard the baptism like you never heard it before. You heard about the serpent seed that you never heard anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Is it true? It is true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the Holy Spirit comes and and and quickens to you the the message of the hour, that quickening means you are selected and elected one for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're finding your place &gt;&gt; in the book. &gt;&gt; And then I'll read this quickly because it's what I already had on the screen. Life is sacred thing to God and it's recorded in a book. It's recorded in the book. God is the author of life. And do you believe that our natural life here we have is just a perversion. Now you see that the perversion that's in the book of life everything's recorded in that book and we may each one of us there's no holy person around here. Jesus condemned everybody when he said when a and when a man looks on a woman to lust after her, he hath committed adultery with her in his heart. And you stand the prophet comes and says, "And a woman may dress. You may be as pure as a lily to your husband, but are you dressed so that to attract a man to lust after you? You'll stand before God as a prostitute." Aren't you glad? that I can say and you can believe &gt;&gt; the author of this book &gt;&gt; said I'll not marry a forgiven woman. &gt;&gt; I'll not marry just one that I have forgiven. I shall only marry a virgin. &gt;&gt; And how can I do that? because I'm the creator and I will recreate those that I have elected and their sins I will remember no more and they shall be buried in the sea of God's forgetfulness his own forgetfulness and they will not be remembered anymore and I will create them a virgin bride and I will come and unite myself with her and I will speak forth thus saith the Lord a perfect word and she will believe that word and she will be pregnantated with the revealed word of God. &gt;&gt; That's a different kind of a book. &gt;&gt; Now it's a lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; revealed to the bride. &gt;&gt; And now she's pregnantated with that kind of word. &gt;&gt; It's not a fiction friends. may sound like fictions. It's not fiction. It's fact. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; For your name of your first nature was born and put on a book. And after all all our deeds was wrote on it, everything you done under the nature was put in the book called the book of life. Now he said your old book is gone with your old union. If you have to read Romans 7 and the scripture says that a woman that is bound to a man is bound by the law of her husband as long as her husband liveth. &gt;&gt; But it says but if her husband is dead then she is free from the law of her husband and spiritually speaking not physically but spiritually speaking. Spiritually speaking, Jesus took our sin &gt;&gt; which came by our first union &gt;&gt; by a perverted life. &gt;&gt; He took that to Calvary and he took it to death. &gt;&gt; He didn't just take it and and and and drink some strong drink. He took it to death and he went to the tomb to break your union so that I could stand behind this pulpit and tell you you are free from that union. And that enemy that tries to tell you you're still part of that old union. You can you have every right to tell him you are a liar and my husband speaks the truth. My husband went to the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My husband went to death and my husband rose from the dead. &gt;&gt; And because of that, I am a free person. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said just like last night I was speaking when you get the books you're going to see maybe a little confusion there. What I said the two books of life it's the same book &gt;&gt; that's called in works is faith expressed. It's the same book, but the one of them is your natural birth and the other one is your spiritual birth. One leads out to the other just like a stock of wheat. &gt;&gt; So, it's the same book. It's a book of life. You're the same person, but you had a book of life and all your deeds are recorded in that book. Then came the lamb of God and he had to show John not on earth but he showed him after he had ascended and he showed it and he showed him and it and the heavens were open and he sees one and I'm going to come to it now. He sees one sitting on a throne with a book in his hand &gt;&gt; and no man can open the book. &gt;&gt; And the prophet declares that John begins to weep because all is lost. All is lost cuz the book is closed. And there's no man worthy. And they search through heaven. And they search through earth. &gt;&gt; Moses, Elijah aren't worthy. Gabriel is not worthy. The angels aren't worthy. Have never touched sin, but they're not worthy to take this book. And and and one and John was weeping. Don't weep. And the prophet said his weeping lasted for just a moment because the voice said, don't weep, John, the lion of the tribe of Judah. That speaks of the end time. The lion of the tribe of Judah. He is a prophet, priest, and king. He's the same one prophet as a as a on a son of man. He's a prophet. He is a son of God as in the Holy Spirit. This dispensation of the Holy Spirit. And he's the son of God. He's the son of God and the son of David in the millennium. &gt;&gt; The lion of the tribe of Judah. He is the lion. He is the eagle. &gt;&gt; He's the man. He's all of them. &gt;&gt; He's the same person. Have you followed that that far? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The lion of the tribe of Judah, &gt;&gt; the he has he prevailed to open the seals. And John turns to look to see the lion and he sees a lamb as it had been slain &gt;&gt; because that was the process without the slaying of the lamb. There was no one worthy to claim the book. He had to be a slain lamb to take the book. had to be a lion because it was at that time it was at the end of the age the lion of the tribe of Judah because now comes a messenger at the end where it's fading out from the Jew from the Gentiles going back to the Jews and under the Jews he deals with the Jews as a nation he deals with Israel as a nation even says one place in the bride I have it here that he says there will be Arabians and there'll be Indians and there'll be all different because they're all kinds of peoples and he even mentions Jews. There could be Jews as individuals. But when he deals with Israel, he deals with them as a nation. And now the prophet says that this is the end. This is the last sign. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; children. &gt;&gt; We're living in the age of the last sign. &gt;&gt; We've had You've had the sign of the Messiah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have lived and your allotted time is in the time of the sign of the resurrection &gt;&gt; and there'll be no more sign. Let us not be even less than say Tommy Osbborne. Tommy Osburn said at brother Brandham's memorial, he said, and it was a rebuke to some of the people who claimed to be believers. He said, "You'll not see this again." He said, "I may be misunderstood, but God walked amongst us." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; And that's what the prophet is saying. It's deity in human's flesh. It's deity in your flesh. If you can believe that, &gt;&gt; do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Can you say it's true? from the Gentiles back. This just to give you some understanding. I'm going to go I'm going to go over it real quickly. From the Gentiles back to the Jews said, remember he deals with Israel as a nation always. It's the nation of Israel. The Gentiles as individuals, people taken from the Gentiles. the Gentiles had to be made up of all the people of the world. So now and then there's a few comes that into that see just like Abra uh and so now then there's a Jew comes not a few there's a Jew comes into that just like a Arabian and Irish and Indian and what more it's all the people of the world make up the bouquet bride but now when he comes to dealing with Israel in his last part of the 70 weeks. He deals with them as a nation. The Gentiles are finished. Children, we are there. &gt;&gt; We are there. If God's dealing with you, you should be saying, "Thank you, Father. Oh, Father, thank you that you have quickened me to this word. You've quickened me. Don't don't don't just allow yourself to be, you know, stirred a wee bit, but say allow yourself say, "Father, if I'm in that number, quicken me &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; by the new birth." &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody here needs to be quickened, &gt;&gt; quickened to it. &gt;&gt; Not just more of God, but quickened to it. He says the Gentiles are finished, the hour soon arriving and maybe yet this very night. This was in the sixth seal. That God will completely turn from the Gentiles altogether. your memories. Every I have a lot more memories than some of you folks, but I always tell younger couples and young people, put memories, nice memories in your memory bank. One day, that's all you'll have left. If time goes on, all you have is the memories. And you want to be able to open up the bank and say, "Give me some nice memories." Memories are nothing more than flipping through the page of your pages of your life. That's what you're remembering. You're smiling, Brother Frank. Brother Frank Fletcher has a few memories, too. And you're flipping through the pages of your life. That's what your memories are. the book and when the story of your life was to change, there's parts of your memories that perhaps you don't want to think about, but God intercepted you. God intercepted the writing and the script of your book and decided that he would interject it, &gt;&gt; that he would intercept it. And now the author now it's not just you it's the author in you &gt;&gt; and he would determine to meet you. So that is why send a prophet messenger with a special message, an invitation to meet the author. Special invitation for you to meet the author. Lots of people go to church. &gt;&gt; A lot of people sing songs. A lot of people maybe play instruments. And a lot of preachers preach. But friends, I I'm on the verge of being broken because I had met him in such a way so suddenly, so unannounced. I'm studying. I'm just read I'm just reading this the way it can happen can happen anywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was with a whole group of ministers who were talking about everything that ministers talk about at a camp meeting. And the author just came said, "I want to have fellowship." And I realized that he wasn't really included in the conversation that we were having. And I ran from the brothers and got in my car and just broke down. Brother Nathan, it was in Saskatchewan at Lake Wascasu at that camp. You might be in you might be at your work. You might be in school. You might be and suddenly you'll just sense a presence of somebody. It's not like stepping into elevator. Have you ever stepped in an elevator? Everybody's chatting and talking and talking. And then you step in the elevator, everybody just stops. Usually everybody starts looking at their watch because they're they they don't know what to do. They're so close to people. There's a there's an aura. They say there's an aura scientifically around people and uh they they say that I'm not interested in that, but but that's what they say. But you can you can sense him and you will know him. I'm trying to prepare you for that. Everything I've said is just a foundation for the next few minutes before I close. You were predestinated to this hour. Please say that's true. &gt;&gt; God knew you were going to be born. You were going to come in a natural birth, a perverted birth. It wasn't the original way that God intended. And God knew that you'd come in contact and somehow the author intercepted your life &gt;&gt; someplace. Maybe at work, maybe in a family, maybe with a relative, maybe a stranger, but he intercepted your life. And he had a struggle. We all have struggles. We had a struggle because the flesh is still there and the prickly nature still there and all those things are there. But there's another life that's inside. There's another voice. It's a tender voice. It's a still small voice, but it's a very persistent voice and keeps telling you you're mine. &gt;&gt; What happened back there was true. What happened back there was real. &gt;&gt; All of these doubts and all of these things that tried to take it from you has been a lie. You know it's a lie. You know it's no happiness. You know there's no fulfillment there. And I am the truth. I am the alpha and I am the omega. I am the beginning and I am the end. And I am the one that has called you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And how he shall appear in the last days is to bring a people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband, &gt;&gt; know her mate, the revealed word. &gt;&gt; That's why this has to happen. &gt;&gt; That's why this has to happen. &gt;&gt; That's why what's going on right now has to happen. is to bring the people to her mate to their mate. We're the bride of Jesus Christ. And just saying that doesn't make you bride. You must experience that. &gt;&gt; And then I just want to refer back to this because I'm proceeding now to a very very very special place for us. And the Lord said to Moses, "Behold, there's a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock." I want to quickly say, says the word was made flesh. You know, he came down, came down, and the prophet said he was actually able. Abel expressed Christ because he was he was slain. And they said, "Now we have the blood that speaks better things than that of Abel." He was like the fa faithful father in Abraham. He was the promised son in Isaac. He was he was in in in Jacob and showing his his long-suffering mercy. He was in he was in uh Joseph as the perfect son. He was in all of the prophets and all of the kings and Solomon who almost like had a a little millennium. And then Jesus could say, "A greater than Solomon is here." So that in the end time now, one that came as your inviter could say, "A greater than Solomon is here." And prove that it was the same Christ who said that back there. &gt;&gt; You're hearing me? &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going through a sequence, please, where you'll have to follow it. Here's just a little sequence. 1961 in a Revelation series. He said, "The seven and last one of those seals when they're opened, it's found in Revelation the 10th chapter." Now, there's the inviter, a prophet. In Revelation the 10th chapter, there was a mighty angel, which was Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come down. I spoke this here in the church and I went home. I laid down in my bed and right away there was a voice because God spoke to me and said, "This is for Switzerland and I didn't know I was going to Switzerland." And the voice like said, "Where'd he come from?" And I got thinking, well, when he came, he came from the came from the realms of glory. He came down, came into a body of humiliation into flesh. He went that took that flesh and took flesh of the earth. Body like yours and mine. Got tired when he was weary. Got thirsty when he wanted water. He did all of those things exactly like you. And when he got to the cross, he felt every bit of the pain and the suffering. But he, the prophet said he had one promise. Your flesh shall not see corruption. &gt;&gt; And he went to death on that one promise. He says you have hundreds concerning healing. Hundreds concerning the rapture. And he had one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the author. He believed it. &gt;&gt; I trust you believe it with all your heart. And then just allow me to kind of go off. Then he went to death. He went to grave. And the Bible says he descended and preached to the souls that were in prison. &gt;&gt; And the prophet says he went to hell for us. I got thinking about the place and the Bible says concerning Judas that he betrayed the Lord. And the book of Acts, they wanted to they they took Lot to find another apostle to fill the place of Judas. And they said Judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place. And I thought, "Oh, for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ actually went to Judas's place. He went to the place of the man that sold him for 30 pieces of silver. &gt;&gt; People, all kinds of people try to discredit this message. I say, "What's wrong with the message?" Well, you the women have to wear long skirts and and and have long hair. What's wrong with that? &gt;&gt; Is that so terrible? Millions and millions and millions out there do it, but they don't have any problem with it. But you know the believers, you know why it is? It's the same spirit coming against that word, &gt;&gt; that blessed spirit of the author. &gt;&gt; So now he begins to talk about the the mighty angel that come down. And I thought, where'd he come from? And it was sealed up. Let me get right down where you are. You say, "What? What? What's What's so special about the opening of the seals?" You didn't know that was Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't know it was Christ. &gt;&gt; I begin to go into the scripture and I can tell you they they have a horse rider coming out, a white horse rider, and and there's ministers that got on the radio and said, "That's the Holy Ghost. And a prophet of God comes and says it's the devil. &gt;&gt; How much further apart can you get than that? &gt;&gt; Who are you going to believe? &gt;&gt; One says it's the Holy Ghost. Prophet of God says it's the devil. &gt;&gt; He's got a bow but he has no arrows. I say praise God. I take that message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Got a bow but no arrows. He can't do you any damage. &gt;&gt; But who told you it was Christ in Revelation 10? Who told you? &gt;&gt; You didn't know it before? &gt;&gt; You needed the seal to be open. You needed this messenger to come to tell you it's him up there. &gt;&gt; He's coming. &gt;&gt; Then we can ask why is he coming and who's he coming for? And we can find our place. They will say, "Where are you?" I will just find my place. And another mighty angel come down from heaven. Oh, this is my angel. This is my Lord. He's got a covenant over his head. And he's writing, as it says also in the Psalms, with clouds as dust at his feet. And he's riding down. Why? With an announcement. children is finished. I'm turning back to the gender. I'm turning back to the Jews. It's all over now. Just get ready for the going home. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Did you find your place? &gt;&gt; Our place in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Had to be the lamb. And now he's making it known. And then in 1962, is this the sign of the end, sir? That's the title of the message. It's a prophet asking that, is this the sign of the end? And so he says on part of it, now in the 10th chapter of the book of Revelation of Jesus Christ, I wish to read a few verses. And he starts and he reads 1:7 and he says, "And I saw another mighty angel, another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, and he had in his hand a little book open." You didn't know what that book was &gt;&gt; until a messenger came and told you about that book. &gt;&gt; You didn't know now that it's a claimed book &gt;&gt; and it's an open book &gt;&gt; and it's a book that has has the power the author of the book has the power to forget, has the power to dismiss, has the power to deletate permanently. It's not the delete button on a computer that still keeps it on the hard disk. He claims the desk. He abolishes the sin and he comes and sends a messenger and says, "You tell them they're sinless. &gt;&gt; You tell them they're not only forgiven, they're justified." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he comes down with a little book open. That's the author of the book. The author of the book has a book in his hand cuz he's got a special message. And now he's not just coming to redeem a bunch of people. And he's not just coming to be beaten and to and to be have his beard pulled out and spat upon. That's not what he's coming for now. He's coming to be loved. Now he's coming in a marriage ceremony. Now he's coming with a marriage certificate in his hand. Hallelujah. Now he's coming with a ring of grace to slip it on her finger. Hallelujah. So you can look at it and say, "Grace, grace. Amazing grace." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you folks enjoy it, but I'm enjoying it. It's not a Ruth. It's not a Ruth of the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; It's not an Esther. Now, it's not a Mary. It's not a Sarah. &gt;&gt; It's none of these types. I'm not coming for a type. I'm coming for the person. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Listen friends, your place if you're going to be I wrote this down when I was in such a state. If you're going to be what you ought to be, what you need to be, you need to find your place in the book to really find your place in this world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's true. &gt;&gt; To know what kind of a man, what kind of a woman, what kind of a young person, what kind of a person am I to be &gt;&gt; to represent him? &gt;&gt; You've got to see your place in the book. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus could say, &gt;&gt; "It is written," and quote Isaiah, &gt;&gt; and then say, "This day is this scripture fulfilled." I can say this day, this scripture, I saw another mighty angel. I have felt his divine presence. He has saved my soul and healed my body. I can say he's the author of truth. He's the author of life. &gt;&gt; Is he your author? That's why when he come from the bosom of the father, he knew what was in the father's mind. He knew who had been chosen. He knew who was here to be play out part of the book. And then he whispered to his bride. I hope you can but can you stay with me a few more minutes? See when he was here on earth he came priest came and handed the book to him. You know that happened in brother Brandham's case birth pains couldn't find a place in the Bible and a a priest came and handed the book. Do you know that a man who sat in our church for a few years was the song leader where that priest would came to speak in Tri Cities, Washington. That man, that man, the song leader became a a a believer of the message. I prayed for him one day at the altar. Forgive me for including myself, but and he asked him about that event when you handed the book to William Brham. He said, "Did you know that was Elijah?" He said, "If he would have said clearly that I'm Elijah," he said, "I would have dropped my val, my case, and followed him. Friends, if God reveals it to you, &gt;&gt; it's stronger than any human saying it. &gt;&gt; Once it's revealed to you, you cannot, nobody can argue why you out of it. They begin to the prophet said he begin to whisper when he came on the I'm I'm trying to go quickly but when he came and he found his place that's why it so struck out to me he had opened the book he read the scripture identified himself and he Bible says he closed the book you don't want that to happen to us. &gt;&gt; We say make yourself known. &gt;&gt; Keep the book open to us. &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself. Keep whispering. Lord &gt;&gt; whisper. &gt;&gt; When you whisper something, it's not for everybody. When you whisper something, it's not even for someone who's close by. You're whispering it to them. and he's whispering to us friends says and I we said well I've heard that a long time ago I know that uh that uh uh he was you know how did you know it I'm simply pointing out your place in the book and then uh and uh then seven thunders uttered their voices and the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his voice lifted up his hands to heaven. And he swear by him that liveth forever and ever. Created heavens and the earth, and the things that in them are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which uh therein are, that time should be no longer. And the and the dagot, says the Greek digot says that the time shall no longer be delayed. In other words, now I'm coming down. I make it known. It won't be delayed any longer. Now it's set in motion. And friends of Cloverdale Bible Way and whoever may be hearing or ever hear this voice, we are in the cycle. And when he revealed who that was that was descending and had a prophet messenger on the earth that would start at a certain season in his ministry and start identifying who that was. I can tell you if it wasn't before it certainly was at that moment that the cycle started and he be now he had revealed himself before as he revealed himself that prophet messenger as a prophet and a servant of God and uh know the secrets of the heart and then he finally comes up and that was me and he was trying to say all the time that's not me that's my voice but that's not me speaking we begin to hear now it comes from another place it comes come from another source. And then he begins to identify a people. And you if you if you actually study, you'll find out it was well into the message that he begins to really identify the bride and who the bride is and what he's doing for the bride. Help help me now to to close. And I I I do want to say this in the message. Is this the sign of the end? Sir, is this the sign of the end? said, "These stars falling into their constellation back yonder the angel coming and said as John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and bring forth the introduction to bring forth the introduction uh of Christ a message all wind up the loose ends and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming. We all of us here I suppose all of us have come after the introduction he introduced himself. How did he introduce himself? He did exactly the same thing. He did the same thing. You know I've read with my own eyes men who have reported on what happened and you know what they said Bible days are here again. &gt;&gt; What is the Bible? It's of Christ. That's what they were saying. Did they walk this direction? Did they take this message? No. Cuz it kind of ran a foul with what they had been taught before. If they could have only realized this was a this was the author of the book speaking. Now &gt;&gt; he says now and this angel came down from heaven. The other seven angels of the seven churches was earthly messengers. But this angel, all the message is finished. And the seventh angel winds up the whole thing. And this angel comes not to the earth, not to the earth. He isn't a man from the earth as the messengers of the church ages. That's finished. But this angel brings the next announcement. And an angel means a messenger. And he comes down from heaven clothed with a pillar of light, a cloud with a rainbow over his head. And a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ. Oh, it was the one I tell you. It was the one I tried to tell you about. And this didn't come to the earth. It came down. It came down from heaven because he came down from heaven because, are you with me? Because the mystery is all finished. &gt;&gt; You say, "What mystery?" I've heard this so many times. I tell you before this message, it was a mystery. &gt;&gt; And you can hear whatever scholar you want to hear. They go all over the map and they contradict one another and they all declare it to be the truth. How can it be the truth when it contradicts the other one? &gt;&gt; Some of you young people probably won't remember, but some years ago when we were still in the log church, I decided one Saturday while I was studying that I would call up some ministers. I called up eight eight ministers on on a Saturday morning. And I said, "Excuse me, I know that you'll be getting ready. I'm interested in the scripture." And I said, "Revelation 17 now talks about the great harlot and so on." I said, "Could could you tell me what you what do you believe about that?" And they were they were all over the map. And and one of them, they'll never forget. He says, "Oh," he says, "You want to stay away from that?" He says, "That's dangerous." I thought, "Now, what what are his people going to hear?" And it talks about the great harlot, the enemy of the church of God. It talk about the great enemy. They have no idea of it. Oh, don't don't want to talk about that. Stay away from that. That's dangerous. And I said, I got a congregation of people listening to that in the morning. I said, "What is it, friends?" He said, I'm asking you, where are we at, sir? I'd like to ask this congregation, where are we at? That's why I don't want to be too demonstrative. I want you to think real deep. It was very quiet when brother Brandham said that. He said, "Where are we at?" And I thought I thought very very deep for the last two weeks. Where where are we at? Where am I? Where am I? And my wife and I talked over the table. Jesus came to the scripture. Where am I in the scripture? And I I don't have a whole lot of places, but I can come to Revelation 10:1. &gt;&gt; Say, beloved, &gt;&gt; my beloved, &gt;&gt; that's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And beloved Jesus, I did not know that was you till you sent this servant. I didn't know it was you. And then he told about it and I and I am I'm able to go to the computer and I'm able to find out. He spoke of it here. Then he spoke of it there. And he went on down and he began to tell me what it was all about. I tell you what, friends, that's what we need to hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to hear. &gt;&gt; And and I I want to I want you to be able to leave here today saying, "Well, brother Biscll, if I don't go away with anything else, I go away with one thing. I can find my place &gt;&gt; in the book." &gt;&gt; Not only in the book, I can find my place in the Lamb's book of life. And in that lamb's book of life, there is not a twinge of sin or iniquity or anything there. We can say, "He has forgiven me." &gt;&gt; Linda, I wonder if if Linda's here. I was so inspired. would you mind if I just feel a little bit of liberty for a moment? I've never had this happen. And I began to sing song. I can't sing, but I began to sing a song. And I I reached over and grabbed a piece of paper and I wrote that song down. And then as I was in my broken state and and I I was just lost. And then another song come, I reached over and I started writing that song. And some of these are How many have ever heard or know that song? It's not a chorus, not a popular chorus. It's a course of a song. Now I am saved. Just just sing the just come to Can you put some power on it? The &gt;&gt; What is the words of the uh &gt;&gt; words of the verse? &gt;&gt; In the darkness. I wondered, vanished from God, knowing not of his grace, seeking by merit to gain my salvation, ever despairing of winning the race. Now, now I am saved. &gt;&gt; I can shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory from my sins and my darkness made bright. &gt;&gt; No more darkness and fear shall I wonder. &gt;&gt; Jesus has My gloom and my night. Now I am safe. Now I am saved. I can shout hallelujah. From my sins and my path made bright. No more in darkness and fear. No more in darkness norus. Now I am saved. I can shout hallelujah. made from my sins and my pathway made. No more in darkness and fear shall I wonder. &gt;&gt; Jesus has my loom and my night. Why don't you stand? S Linda, sing the second verse and we'll join in. &gt;&gt; Fearing God's judgement. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; Yet seeking his favor to him. My works and self effort I gave. Then I at last saw the plan of salvation. &gt;&gt; Yes. In the blessed savior so mighty to sing. &gt;&gt; Now I am saved. I can shout. Hallelujah. Save from my sins and I have way. Oh, no more in darkness and fear shall I wonder. Jesus has my bloom and my &gt;&gt; listen to the words of this next verse. This is the third verse. Oh, how I grasped at God's offer of mercy when by his grace he revealed it to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Showing me Christ who had purchased my pardon went for my sins. He was judged on the tree. Now I am saved. I can shout halleluah. Straight from my sins and my path made right. No more in darkness and fear shall I wonder. Jesus has scattered my sing justified. Justified friends before we close before we sing. It's one of the services I don't hardly feel like closing, but we're going to have baptism tonight. We're going to have the Lord's table tonight. So, look forward to it. I want to announce to you, announce to you, we've found our place in the Lord. I want to declare to you friends, if you don't show it to anybody else, show it to the devil. Let Satan know that's me. And the author wrote of me. And he put one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth and declared and swore by himself. Hallelujah. Who's God? That's my God.

That's good news, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Why don't we thank the Lord together? Our heavenly father, we want to thank you, Lord. We've been brought from all so many walks of life and places, but we found our place in the same book. Lord, we look down the aisle and across the pew and across the room and we see nothing but God, nothing but Christ, nothing but miracles, saved by grace, no longer sinners, but we're sons and daughters. Lord, that ought to lift up every heart. That ought to rejoice every soul today that we saw our name in a book that cannot be erased. Satan tried to delete us some before we were even born and in the womb. But Lord, we came and was manifested not just in the natural, but in the spiritual. And you have followed us all the way down through our lives. And one day we were born again. And here we are, Lord. And we're not ashamed to declare that you are our God. And this message came for us. And we thank you and we rejoice today, Lord. Our hearts are beating, Lord. that this is the greatest thing in all of our lives is that Jesus is making himself known in our flesh. Lord, what a service before the communion table. What a time tonight, Lord. We can rejoice that it's no longer us that's living, but it's Christ that has been born again, Lord. Oh, Father, let's this afternoon and tonight be a great rejoicing time for the saints. Let this assembly experience great healing, great deliverance, great revelation. Lord, as we see this day, this February first, this scripture is being fulfilled. That is super, that is supernatural. Our eyes have come open, Lord. And we have won the battle. It's already done. And we're on the winning side. And we've seen, Lord, we've heard from our theophony. And we've seen our names in the book. There's no reason for any defeat. There's no reason for any more unbelief. But Lord, may our eyes come open and may we rejoice. The Holy Ghost is quickening sons and daughters. Oh, Father, we pray this afternoon and as we come tonight, Lord, all three ordinances, Lord, in one evening, baptism, communion, and foot washing, and rejoicing. Lord, when you came to your cross, Lord, great heaviness was upon your shoulders. And there were men and women that could not watch and tar with you not even an hour. They were under such a burden. But Lord, at the end of the ages, there's another group of people that are watching and prayerful and are looking unto you, Lord, and coming to our cross as it was, but our eyes are wide open, Lord. this day, this scriptur is being fulfilled, that our hearts can be free to know that the rapture has already began. Lord, we thank you and rejoice. Bless our pastor, our senior pastor that has given his life, Lord, and you've allowed him a glimpse over the wall for us younger ones and us coming behind to be able to say, "Thank the Lord Jesus that our eagle eyes have got that were once filmed over. Now we can see clearly the vision of the word and it is plain and we can run with this message all the way to the end. strengthen Lord every life that's here, visitors and then those that'll be coming tonight special in give us a great time around the table and as we wash feet with one another let us recognize it is Jesus that is here among us again we thank you and we go rejoicing in the name of Jesus Christ amen thank you God bless you why don't you turn around shake hands with some that you're going to spend eternity with.
