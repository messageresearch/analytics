[0:03] at this clipon cafeteria jeene we were
[0:05] up there brother AR Bri was going to buy
[0:07] me a suit of clothes and I was waiting
[0:08] for him because he needed one and and he
[0:11] was going buy me a suit of clothes I was
[0:13] waiting there clion and I was waiting
[0:15] for him to come in and I seen a a woman
[0:16] come in and I said my that poor thing I
[0:21] looked at her I thought you know I I'd
[0:25] seen
[0:26] leomia I'd seen opma I'd seen leprosy
[0:31] but I I never see anything like that
[0:34] there something wrong with a woman's eye
[0:36] and I saw well I believe I'll go over
[0:37] and ask that sister tell her I'm a
[0:40] minister and ask her what's wrong if I
[0:43] could pray for her and so I started over
[0:46] come another woman look the same I
[0:47] backed off she probably would have
[0:49] slapped me if I asked her but you know
[0:51] she had her eyes painted green out here
[0:54] blw back here Office of the side I ever
[0:57] seen in my life now women if you're
[1:01] going to wear that stuff which you ought
[1:03] to do it you ought to do it but why
[1:06] don't you try to look like a human
[1:07] anyhow not like some kind of something
[1:10] that fell out of a clar's of
[1:12] Undertaker's establishment or something
[1:15] uh I at least try to be human with it
[1:18] and I don't believe in wearing it all I
[1:21] don't believe you're supposed to there's
[1:22] only one woman in the Bible ever painted
[1:24] her face to meet a man no woman paints
[1:28] her face to meet God you paint your face
[1:30] to meet man and her name is
[1:33] Jezebel you know what God did to her he
[1:36] fed her to the dogs
