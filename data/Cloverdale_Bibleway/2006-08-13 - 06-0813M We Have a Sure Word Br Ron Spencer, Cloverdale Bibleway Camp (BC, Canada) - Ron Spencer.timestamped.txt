[6:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wanted to be here at camp so
[7:00] bad. And uh just things, you know, and
[7:05] sometimes, you know, like I I met with
[7:07] some guys this week and they're probably
[7:10] the richest guy in Canada, probably of
[7:13] the second the most important political
[7:14] guy in Canada back in Toronto. And you
[7:17] know what? I'd rather be a kid.
[7:20] You know, I mean, you some of you young
[7:22] people, you think, well, you got your
[7:23] life ahead. You say, "What do I want to
[7:25] do?" You know, I can tell you I've seen
[7:27] it all. And it's much better serving
[7:30] God.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; The end of the day, what do they got? A
[7:33] lot of money.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; You know, at the end of the day, they're
[7:36] going to die.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; We know where we're going.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; And they don't.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; They don't have a clue. And I am just so
[7:44] thankful for the Lord this morning.
[7:46] Let's sing. I haven't had a chance to
[7:48] sing yet. Camp time, so I got to sing
[7:49] camp time. Camp time.
[7:53] Amen. One day, this is it. If you be
[7:57] here and you haven't had
[8:00] your meeting with God, you want to make
[8:02] sure you get it now. Amen. So, let's
[8:05] sing it together.
[8:09] Jesus
[8:22] will make you
[8:35] the same every time. you guys. Now, some
[8:38] of you guys, you've been in camp a long
[8:40] time and you know just with brother they
[8:42] ain't going to cut it, right? I want to
[8:44] hear at the top of your lungs. Okay, let
[8:48] let the people here down at Birch Bay or
[8:50] the beaches. What was that? Right.
[8:52] People at camp praise the Lord. Sing it
[8:55] again. It's time.
[9:10] Let the
[9:12] star
[9:31] of
[9:37] that will make me
[9:43] glad I

[15:21] &gt;&gt; Father, we worship you this morning. We
[15:23] want to take time, Lord, to welcome you

[15:29] God, this morning we have a place to
[15:30] gather with Jesus. Worship you Lord and

[15:57] request
[16:08] motorcycle accident on Monday
[16:16] morning. Had to have four hours of
[16:18] surgery and during this he tumor behind
[16:21] his knee now has to go to St. John for
[16:24] the test of surgery.
[16:27] at this time
[16:29] situation back
[16:33] window.
[16:38] How many need
[16:44] on the internet
[16:55] this morning? How many are in
[16:57] anticipation,
[16:59] &gt;&gt; expectation?
[17:01] It just has been just electrifying
[17:03] service after service. These are needs
[17:06] we could just join our our hearts
[17:08] together as one. We believe God can move
[17:12] in a very special and supernatural way
[17:14] this morning. So let's unite our hearts
[17:17] before the throne of grace. Heavenly
[17:18] Father, Lord, there is such a desire,
[17:22] Lord, within our hearts to come in that
[17:25] unity of the faith, one mind, one heart.
[17:29] Lord Jesus, one desire to see the moving
[17:32] of God. Lord, we've been under that
[17:35] baptism over night after night, and we
[17:38] have felt the breeze of the Holy Ghost,
[17:40] the moving of God, and our hearts are
[17:43] filled this morning with thanksgiving.
[17:45] Lord, you've done great things amongst
[17:47] us, and we want to open up our mouths
[17:49] this morning to give you glory, to give
[17:52] you praise. Lord, we thank you for the
[17:54] move of God. We've been praying for it,
[17:57] Lord. And you have come night after
[18:00] night. You've confirmed your word with
[18:03] signs following. And we say, Lord,
[18:05] confirm your word once again. Bless your
[18:08] people. They have gathered this
[18:10] resurrection morning. You are the same
[18:12] yesterday, today, and forever. And we're
[18:16] asking, God, that you will meet these
[18:18] needs. Brother Rod has spoken. Our
[18:20] hearts are raised. Our hands are raised.
[18:23] Lord, meet these needs. our dear brother
[18:26] Nelson's son. We pray that you will move
[18:30] on his behalf this morning as we heard
[18:33] our dear brother Ron last night at daddy
[18:36] come into the room. I am a son of God
[18:38] and I have rights as a son of God. Lord,
[18:41] you raise that man up. Raise this son up
[18:44] for your glory. Save the soul, Lord. Do
[18:48] what you must do with God at him into
[18:51] the body of Christ we pray. And Lord,
[18:54] for every uplifted hand and every spoken
[18:56] request, Brother Mike Cosalo's son, he's
[18:59] in trouble in Japan. Lord, you can move
[19:02] on magistrate's hearts. You can move on
[19:04] the police heart. We've seen it, Lord.
[19:06] We ask you one more time. And so,
[19:09] Father, we're committing these needs to
[19:11] you. Asking, Father, you'll anoint the
[19:14] man of God once again. Anoint us to
[19:17] pull. Anoint us to receive the promises
[19:20] of God. We thank you for this time. has
[19:23] been such a time of refreshing or we're
[19:26] thankful for your moving move again. We
[19:29] pray now in Jesus name. Amen.
[19:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Well, here we are at a
[19:40] meeting that we don't really like to see
[19:41] coming. Kind of mixed feelings. We're
[19:44] happy to have the service this morning,
[19:47] but we don't like to see it be the last
[19:49] one to camp. Is that right?
[19:54] people almost fighting to come to camp
[19:56] and we appreciate that been hard. We had
[19:59] to say no to a lot of folks. So I'm
[20:02] going to just have you sing the course,
[20:04] brother. We'll give all the glory to
[20:06] Jesus and tell him
[20:14] to
[20:22] his wonderful
[20:27] glory
[20:41] for what he has been doing
[20:44] for you during this camp and what he yet
[20:48] will do.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's a whole lot here
[20:52] that I've asked him, including myself,
[20:55] for specific things. And now, although I
[20:58] don't sing it yet, I do give him glory.
[21:01] Amen.
[21:05] Glor to Jesus
[21:10] and tell his love. His wonderful
[21:16] love will give the glory to Jesus
[21:24] and tell his wonderful
[21:28] love.
[21:31] You may be seated.
[21:35] One of our new families
[21:39] uh brother Mike and sister Cindy
[21:43] not very long ago they found themselves
[21:45] in real real difficult place and uh I
[21:49] guess one day
[21:52] certain direction went
[21:55] and uh this is their letter of
[21:57] thanksgiving. God works on their behalf
[21:59] in a wonderful wonderful way. So we give
[22:02] all the glory to God. But they
[22:06] have said these words, we would like to
[22:08] give thanks to God and to all the body
[22:11] of Christ for helping make our recent
[22:13] trials a blessing. You gave us financial
[22:17] support and you cleaned and packed our
[22:20] home and moved and unpacked. You fixed
[22:24] what needed fixing and along with along
[22:27] the way you became more acquainted with
[22:29] us and us with you. You all were truly
[22:34] God's hands and feet. Thank you and God
[22:38] bless you even more than he blessed us.
[22:43] Mike and Cindy
[22:45] God bless them. That's a very lovely
[22:50] word of thanksgiving to show you. And
[22:53] furthermore, that's the body of Christ.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; That's the way it's supposed to work.
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Just beyond lip service. Well, this kind
[23:00] of camp these
[23:03] these times don't take place without a
[23:06] great deal of work and effort,
[23:10] planning, praying,
[23:12] ministering.
[23:14] from one camp is over the whole focus
[23:18] starts coming on the next time whether
[23:20] it be in winter and then from Friday to
[23:23] Friday
[23:25] we felt to have the young people and I I
[23:27] can see the effects of it I want to say
[23:29] to you young people and to the parents
[23:33] and the congregation Bible way and our
[23:36] extended congregation on the internet or
[23:38] wherever uh and to the body of Christ at
[23:41] large I have seen the effect. I think
[23:45] I'm a fairly perceptive person. I
[23:48] believe I have a Holy Spirit with the
[23:51] spirit of discernment. I have seen a
[23:53] distinct effect. I I saw uh as I looked
[23:57] down across the congregation last year,
[24:01] I saw a young man and young lady that I
[24:04] thought may be over the edge. I did not
[24:07] know whether they were recoverable or
[24:10] not. You might say, why is anything too
[24:12] hard for the Lord? No, nothing's too
[24:13] hard for the Lord. But I do know even as
[24:16] the prophet God says there is a line you
[24:18] can cross. He also has said and the
[24:22] scripture teaches us that we should not
[24:25] grieve the Holy Spirit. And and and I I
[24:28] saw young people, young men, young
[24:31] ladies have come up from their early
[24:32] teens now into into a different league.
[24:36] And I saw just that constant resisting
[24:39] of the Holy I just wondered I I was at
[24:42] that point with a number of them. I just
[24:44] wondered what was going to happen last
[24:47] year. Uh God sovereignly moved and a
[24:51] marvelous marvelous move and I saw that
[24:55] it's something that I believe was
[24:57] absolutely genuine. And of course it's
[24:59] time it needs to be time tested. And so
[25:02] you you just watch it then in the
[25:04] following months we come to have uh more
[25:07] gatherings of the young people and teach
[25:09] them the word. And brother John went to
[25:12] the adoption series, brother Tom was
[25:15] taking the line share the
[25:17] responsibility. And Friday after Friday
[25:20] and gathering after gathering and when
[25:23] they began to gather maybe 120, 130 and
[25:28] you always expect
[25:30] a tapering off, a cooling off and less
[25:33] coming. Maybe start with 120, 130, end
[25:36] with 100. It worked the reverse. In the
[25:39] fact is that it started about 120 and by
[25:43] the time by the time the year was out
[25:46] coming over 150 young people Friday
[25:50] after Friday to the meeting and that to
[25:52] me was a glorious sign because there was
[25:55] something really concrete happening in
[25:58] their lives just that steady teaching
[26:01] and that environment. And then when this
[26:04] camp started, the first night I looked
[26:06] down and I saw many that were actually
[26:09] in a critical state. I won't say many,
[26:12] but some critical state one year ago and
[26:15] now I can see that they were at a
[26:18] different level. The camp was actually
[26:21] starting at a different level, different
[26:23] spiritual level. And I believe that
[26:25] brother Ron Spencer, he speak for
[26:27] himself, but I believe that uh he would
[26:31] he told me last night of greatest
[26:33] anointing, if not the greatest anointing
[26:36] he's ever experienced in a service. And
[26:39] we have a thousand chairs and there are
[26:42] the kitchen staff and those that are
[26:44] outside I I thousand or more people that
[26:48] are here and it seemed like there was
[26:49] one mind, one spirit.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, I'm I'm absolutely
[26:56] determined to have spiritual victories
[27:00] &gt;&gt; and I expected it. I sing and it doesn't
[27:04] surprise me a bit and I want to tell you
[27:06] that you need to be sitting in your seat
[27:09] expecting spiritual victory.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Our God is a spiritual
[27:14] God.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So with all the endeavor
[27:21] there's a number of groups we cannot
[27:22] name individuals because we would never
[27:25] get to it. But the ministry
[27:28] and the team that has worked uh Brother
[27:32] Thomas and directed the uh camp for now
[27:35] many years and uh the team that has
[27:38] worked with them and I I would like to
[27:41] have I know that we all those that are
[27:44] in the kitchen not here but I would like
[27:46] to have those that have been involved
[27:50] uh directly involved to stand as I
[27:52] mention these groups. So we have the
[27:55] ministry and their wives. I like them to
[27:59] stand.
[28:02] your wives
[28:04] and the team that worked with them so
[28:07] closely in planning. I know my sister
[28:12] and
[28:16] I know I'm sure they're back in the
[28:19] kitchen.
[28:22] I like all the counselors to stand.
[28:29] Is any of the kitchen staff here? Those
[28:31] that have worked directly in the
[28:32] kitchen.
[28:40] I'd like those that work under brother
[28:45] Tom
[28:47] and that are responsible for putting up
[28:50] the tent and taking it down.
[28:59] I'd like those that have been providing
[29:03] music and the song leaders to stand.
[29:10] They don't just come here and I said
[29:12] they'll start playing. So this starts
[29:15] sometimes weeks before so they can be in
[29:18] the right attitude and the right
[29:19] atmosphere.
[29:21] and all those in the sound and the video
[29:25] and the internet and the lighting if
[29:29] they stand.
[29:34] When you see one stand or two stand it
[29:37] means they do about six things.
[29:46] I can tell you there's about 60 people
[29:49] involved.
[29:51] more than 60
[29:53] about 60 just putting the up and down
[29:55] because we have all the
[30:00] see brother Joe Wal you're sitting there
[30:02] brother Joe maybe I can get you to stand
[30:04] and all the
[30:09] all those assisted. Now
[30:12] we have everyone standing directly
[30:15] involved
[30:17] and all who gave
[30:20] all who made it possible the whole
[30:23] congregation.
[30:26] We're going to thank God for this
[30:28] audience of people and you're here in
[30:31] attendance
[30:33] and from my heart to your heart.
[30:37] Thank you for being who you are.
[30:40] Thank you for being a son and daughter
[30:43] of God. Thank you for coming today with
[30:48] your lick of fire.
[30:50] We have
[30:52] brother Neville who was pastor at at
[30:58] Round Tabernacle for many years. We have
[31:02] four of his grandchildren here in this
[31:05] meeting. Did you know that four brother
[31:08] Neville's grandchildren? I want them to
[31:11] raise their hand. So wait while I see
[31:14] right there. There they are. Those are
[31:16] brother Neville's grandchildren.
[31:18] You folks better line up out here cuz
[31:20] everybody's going to want to shake your
[31:22] hand.
[31:23] We love Brother Neville.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; He's a faithful servant of God beside
[31:28] the prophet of God. The brother said he
[31:30] preached the same message
[31:33] &gt;&gt; preaching. We're so happy to have them,
[31:35] brother Tim and Alice Brat's children
[31:38] here with us all the way from South
[31:41] Carolina. So, God bless you each one.
[31:44] Brother Tom, you may want to add
[31:46] something to this. And and before I step
[31:49] back,
[31:51] I want to say I thank God for brother
[31:55] Rob Spencer yielding himself to the Holy
[31:58] Spirit night after night. His wife
[32:00] Sister Connie with them and brother
[32:03] Bobby who have been their hosts and
[32:06] their chauffeers and caring for them
[32:09] just moment by moment. We're so thankful
[32:11] for people like that. And our brother
[32:14] Brian Jones and sister Jenny his good
[32:19] wife and stood by his side through the
[32:21] bush and open fires. And uh how many
[32:26] know that it takes a good woman to stand
[32:28] for brother Brian?
[32:44] Brother Brian wants to just say a word
[32:46] to before brother Tom. Brother Brian
[32:48] just like a word of thanksgiving would
[32:52] come up here.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; You want to do it hyena?
[33:09] gave me
[33:11] such a wonderful man to us
[33:23] for the atmosphere around was stunning.
[33:26] Just as good as sitting in the wild and
[33:29] eating the line
[33:33] just as good.
[33:59] comments here.
[34:03] I guess I go back 21 years
[34:07] when I was a year old man
[34:10] had a vision
[34:16] and
[34:18] we started counselors all counselors
[34:20] full all our young and seniors together
[34:26] started
[34:28] to
[34:31] close to 450
[34:36] years
[34:38] and first couple years I was involved
[34:41] with the camp taking the morning
[34:43] devotions and the direction for the day
[34:47] of course involved with the evening
[34:49] services
[34:56] they help kick off our camps and I
[35:00] always said You know, everybody was a
[35:03] counselor at their cabin. I was a
[35:05] counselor to two men.
[35:16] You think that was a
[35:20] brother.
[35:40] Seeing our children by the way of God is
[35:44] the greatest thrill.
[35:48] to come to have fun. That's great.
[35:51] We always say we're children. We want
[35:52] you to have fun. I'm not here for you to
[35:55] have fun. I'm here that you would meet
[35:57] God. Create an atmosphere and the
[36:00] brothers and sisters that have joined
[36:02] with us over the years
[36:04] has been wonderful. Brother Jess and
[36:07] Sister Lyn decided
[36:09] moved up here from California wanting to
[36:12] do something for the Lord. And I'll
[36:14] never
[36:15] in my office.
[36:18] I just have aired
[36:33] to go
[36:42] assembly
[36:45] and God knowing that the assembly would
[36:47] grow.
[36:48] helps
[36:50] we can minister one to another. It has
[36:53] been a joy to know that we don't have to
[36:56] beg for you to come and help. It is a
[36:59] willingness within your heart to be a
[37:01] part of what God and it's always a great
[37:04] joy. I have to say imagine you can't
[37:08] come.
[37:10] We have too many willing to help us and
[37:13] I'm so thankful and those that you know
[37:16] have not come we
[37:25] parents can be around their children
[37:31] around it just makes family unit
[37:33] stronger it makes strong
[37:38] I'll never forget mentioned a couple
[37:40] times one year
[37:43] I was just I wanted him so bad to be a
[37:46] part of I don't know why but he just
[37:48] wanted I said brother Paul would you
[37:50] please be an assistant counsel
[38:11] that was a great event within my life.
[38:14] He said those boys I had in the cabin
[38:16] they were just boys before he says can
[38:19] you imagine one of them came up to me
[38:21] shook their hands
[38:24] and thought you're my counselor he says
[38:26] you know what that did for me
[38:29] that was wonderful and that's what we
[38:31] have seen and I say God bless those
[38:34] helpers that have come and stepped to
[38:36] the plate
[38:38] and see these young ones coming up.
[38:41] We're getting older.
[38:43] It's It's amazing. I never think I am,
[38:46] but I'm getting older. And then we have
[38:49] a need. And then we have brother John
[38:52] Andrews coming
[38:56] up.
[39:02] You see the body to the body. the young
[39:10] strength
[39:12] to the fabric of this world
[39:15] and I want to say to you young people
[39:19] joy
[39:22] the video the internet sound it's a joy
[39:27] and it's something you should thank God
[39:29] for they're not running away from church
[39:32] they're running to see what can we do
[39:34] for the
[39:36] You won't find that out there. It's
[39:39] unique.
[39:41] And I thank God for you for these young
[39:43] people that put on these presentations.
[39:45] The pressure we put on. It's phenomenal.
[39:48] The sisters that labor and make the
[39:51] different costumes for the presentation.
[39:53] It is phenomenal. The pressure that
[39:56] they're under and I put them under and
[39:59] what I expect from them and the gift
[40:01] that God puts in them. And to know that,
[40:04] you know, we
[40:06] have a voice telling us do this
[40:10] feel
[40:18] that's a lot
[40:21] taken
[40:23] by taken
[40:26] As mentioned, put them in for our young
[40:28] people. We've never done it for
[40:30] entertainment. We always
[40:33] speak
[40:37] for 20 odd years. The Holy Spirit has
[40:39] come and young people's lives. Well,
[40:42] it's foolish.
[40:45] The foolishness of preaching. But you
[40:46] know what? Sometimes you just have to
[40:49] present it in such a way that they they
[40:51] grab it and God has come behind it. And
[40:55] it was a great thing that we started
[40:58] with Joseph this year. It was a great
[41:00] thing to have a minister come from
[41:02] thousands of miles and start open Joseph
[41:05] profession. That is a great thing.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know you were a part
[41:13] of that.
[41:15] that were moved by that that was in the
[41:18] mind of God before the foundation of the
[41:21] world.
[41:22] I just say to Christ,
[41:36] but I know you can't help.
[41:39] I don't care if it's in your I don't
[41:41] care.
[41:43] You can't
[41:46] I have never asked the Lord. I've never
[41:49] g because I'm going to get more money.
[41:53] I'm giving this because that's that's a
[41:55] principle I have just given and God has
[41:58] given back. He's giving me my children.
[42:05] He's g me a family of God that I love
[42:07] dear.
[42:12] And so I say God bless you. God just
[42:15] carrying us another camp and we need
[42:18] more help, more people. I know that God
[42:21] will raise up those members to make it
[42:26] exactly what
[42:29] this has been tremendous.
[42:31] Last year when we came in people, it was
[42:35] a cloud.
[42:37] It was the greatest I've ever been in my
[42:39] life.
[42:40] I took the young room. I said there'll
[42:42] be no cameras, there'll be no tape
[42:44] recorders, there'll be nothing.
[42:46] And we just rolled up our sleeves and we
[42:48] just started plowing
[42:51] getting things out of our lives.
[42:55] The Holy Spirit came and we we left camp
[42:58] and I believe the Holy Spirit has kept
[42:59] you at a certain level.
[43:02] We had camp and I saw lives changed.
[43:06] I've mentioned Sam
[43:12] You said when you have camp, we burn
[43:14] ourselves up for just two, three nights.
[43:16] I'd do it any day for a second.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; We do this for you.
[43:22] You've been bound to see you loose to
[43:24] see brother David going down there at a
[43:28] camp. God comes and moves and change
[43:30] lives. You know what that is to me?
[43:31] Every time I see David,
[43:36] &gt;&gt; we'll do one more time. you young
[43:39] ladies, it's wonderful because you're
[43:41] going to be mothers. You're going to
[43:43] have children
[43:44] &gt;&gt; and you're going to have to know God.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to have things come into
[43:48] your home. And this is what it's for.
[43:49] It's to build you up in the faith. Not
[43:51] to see how pretty your face is, but they
[43:53] have the beauty of Christ.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; That's what camp's all about. To make
[43:58] young men strong in the gospel, as John
[44:02] has said, I read unto you, young men,
[44:03] because you have overcome the wicked
[44:05] one. In verse 14, he says, "I read unto
[44:07] you because
[44:09] you are strong and the word of God
[44:13] abideth in you."
[44:16] &gt;&gt; That's what we do to establish this at
[44:18] the opening comments to establish the
[44:20] word of God in your heart. And I'm sorry
[44:22] for taking up this time, but I want to
[44:25] thank you all for being a part of this
[44:27] camp. And we started at and ended at
[44:30] that level
[44:31] that we came back not to read our first
[44:35] Recall Thursday night was the same as it
[44:38] was last Saturday last year.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; The expectation as brother Ed preached
[44:44] before we came to camp. We talk about it
[44:47] and we preach
[44:49] about expectation and you get what you
[44:51] expect. You came and you saw
[44:55] and God moved. And we just want to
[44:59] continue this now and go from glory unto
[45:02] glory to glory. And I say, "God bless
[45:05] you, kitchen staff, those dear sisters
[45:07] that are in the bathroom back there
[45:09] sweating their brains out. We don't even
[45:12] hardly think about them or give them the
[45:14] time of day. I'll tell you one thing.
[45:16] They're going to have a great
[45:21] brother said
[45:26] as much as a man behind a
[45:30] fed us for us by the
[45:34] All the staff there young ladies coming
[45:36] up and taking our load and say God bless
[45:39] you and one glorious thing when we reach
[45:41] over there if God ever gives us a telly
[45:44] sheep and says what happened at Bible
[45:47] way care you'll know that you'll stand
[45:50] with the redeemed and rejoice for what
[45:52] you've done and laid down your lives. I
[45:54] say God bless you all and may this be
[45:56] the most glorious of every any service
[46:00] we had. God bless you.

[46:26] brothers come and prepare to take up the

[1:09:06] the unmarited favor, God.

[1:09:12] placed something inside of our hearts.
[1:09:16] Lord, we like those Hebrew children, we
[1:09:18] will not bend and we will not bow.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And there's something inside of us. We
[1:09:23] will not settle for this world. But
[1:09:26] there's there is a called to come
[1:09:28] higher.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are going all the way as
[1:09:32] the song says. We ask you that, Father,
[1:09:35] that you would come one more time this
[1:09:37] morning and anoint our lips and anoint
[1:09:40] our mind.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we thank you for this meeting
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; and what it has done for us.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; How you draw us closer to your presence.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; How you spoke to our hearts. How you've
[1:09:53] driven back the demons of hell. brought
[1:09:56] redemption, brought freedom,
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; oh God, and the healing power that was
[1:10:02] here last night. Lord, we're just
[1:10:05] thankful for the miracles that have been
[1:10:07] done.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, we know that only you can live
[1:10:11] these things.

[1:10:15] you high today.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And we thank you, dear God, that you
[1:10:19] have blessed our lives. You've given us
[1:10:21] strength for another day's journey. And
[1:10:24] we ask that you help us today in Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ we pray. Move this morning.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Certainly good to be in the house of the
[1:10:36] Lord this morning. Isn't it
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; you will turn with me to second Peter
[1:10:42] chapter 1.
[1:10:45] I would like to take this time and he
[1:10:47] hurt brother Tom
[1:10:50] just thanking everyone of you for
[1:10:53] all that you did to make this camp
[1:10:56] happen.
[1:10:58] I would like to thank brother Tom for
[1:11:02] inviting me again this year. And I
[1:11:05] certainly certainly have enjoyed it. I
[1:11:07] trust you've enjoyed it.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; And I would like to thank everyone that
[1:11:12] is involved in all that you do for the
[1:11:14] kingdom of God. And we certainly do
[1:11:18] appreciate you with all of our hearts.
[1:11:20] Amen.
[1:11:23] We say we appreciate you.
[1:11:26] Amen. Second Peterapter 1
[1:11:31] verse 19.
[1:11:39] We have also a more sure word of
[1:11:45] prophecy
[1:11:46] where unto you do where unto excuse me
[1:11:52] where unto you do well that you take
[1:11:54] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[1:11:58] dark place until the day dawn the day
[1:12:02] and the day star arise in your hearts.
[1:12:06] Knowing this first that no prophecy of
[1:12:09] the scripture is of any private
[1:12:11] interpretation.
[1:12:13] For the prophecy came not in old time by
[1:12:16] the will of man but by holy men of God
[1:12:20] that spake as they were moved by the
[1:12:23] Holy Ghost. Chapter 3
[1:12:28] verse four.
[1:12:32] and saying, "Where is the promise of his
[1:12:36] coming? For since the fathers fell
[1:12:39] asleep, and all things continue as they
[1:12:41] were from the beginning of the creation.
[1:12:44] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:12:47] that by the word of God the heavens were
[1:12:49] of old, and the earth standing out of
[1:12:52] the water and in the water. Whereby the
[1:12:54] world that then was being overflowed
[1:12:56] with water perished. But the heavens and
[1:12:59] the earth which are now and by the same
[1:13:02] were are kept in store, reserved under
[1:13:04] fire against the day of judgment and
[1:13:07] tradition of ungodly men. But beloved,
[1:13:10] be not ignorant of this one thing, that
[1:13:13] the day is the of the with the Lord as a
[1:13:16] thousand years, and a thousand years as
[1:13:19] one day. The Lord is not slack
[1:13:22] concerning his promise, as some men
[1:13:24] count slackness, but is longsuffering to
[1:13:27] prosper, not willing that any should
[1:13:30] perish, but that all come to repentance.
[1:13:33] But the day of the Lord will come as a
[1:13:35] thief in the night
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; in the which the heavens shall pass away
[1:13:40] with a great noise and the elements
[1:13:42] shall burn with a melt with a fervent of
[1:13:44] heat and the earth and and the works
[1:13:46] that are therein shall be burned up. You
[1:13:49] may be seated this morning.
[1:14:00] I would like to look this morning at a
[1:14:02] sure word.
[1:14:04] We are very much living in an
[1:14:06] information age when everybody has
[1:14:09] opinion,
[1:14:12] everybody has a thought all the way from
[1:14:15] politics to world leaders to the to the
[1:14:20] television evangelist of this of our
[1:14:22] day. And we don't have too much of a
[1:14:25] effect with those guys, but they all
[1:14:28] have a thought. I mentioned last night
[1:14:31] they write books on Left Behind. They
[1:14:34] have an idea because they feel the pull
[1:14:36] of the hour and they they kind of give
[1:14:39] their synopsis, their opinions. They
[1:14:42] kind of give their thoughts of of what
[1:14:44] they think it's going to be and how it's
[1:14:46] going to take place and and the rapture
[1:14:49] of the church and the tribulation period
[1:14:51] and the earthquakes and the wars and the
[1:14:53] rumors of wars. But I'm thankful tonight
[1:14:57] that we have a sure word
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; and we do not have to do a whole lot of
[1:15:04] dibble dabbling questioning about it
[1:15:06] because God sent a us a specific word.
[1:15:10] Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; And as we look at the Bible, which
[1:15:13] millions of people look at this Bible
[1:15:15] and they read and they study through it
[1:15:17] and and they just look blindly through
[1:15:20] it and they try to put this with that
[1:15:22] and it just doesn't seem to work out.
[1:15:25] But when the scriptures once unveiled
[1:15:27] from the author of the book through the
[1:15:29] seals of this day, you can sit here and
[1:15:32] the little children can sit here today
[1:15:34] and literally just just blow the
[1:15:37] theologian's minds away.
[1:15:40] And it's not because of some traditional
[1:15:43] teaching of some Sunday school
[1:15:45] somewhere.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; It's not because of some white washing
[1:15:49] up of preaching. But it's because the
[1:15:52] word of God has transformed their lives.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; As brother Adam preached in future home,
[1:16:00] before he ever he ever went into the
[1:16:02] future home, he talked about the conduct
[1:16:04] to the people in the restaurants and the
[1:16:07] motel and in the He talked about what a
[1:16:11] great respect that the the even the
[1:16:13] managers and the owners of the motel
[1:16:16] were and the restaurants were and how
[1:16:18] that they were thrilled to have have the
[1:16:20] children of God sitting in the in in
[1:16:22] their restaurants and in their motel.
[1:16:24] You see, before that he laid out what
[1:16:27] our future home was, if there was a
[1:16:30] preparing of people that lived in that
[1:16:32] future home.
[1:16:34] What good would it do to construct a
[1:16:37] city
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; if nobody's going to live that?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are a people that have
[1:16:44] been predestinated before the foundation
[1:16:47] of the world to live in this day.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; We could not have lived in Noah's day or
[1:16:54] in Amos's day or in Elijah of the first
[1:16:57] coming day. We were not to live in the
[1:17:00] day of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we
[1:17:02] were pre-planned before the foundation
[1:17:05] of the world to sit here this morning
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; now. No matter what they're thinking of
[1:17:11] of of higher learning as deep complex of
[1:17:16] thoughts as they can look into the
[1:17:17] scriptures comparing scripture with
[1:17:20] scripture and text with text, there's no
[1:17:23] way for the human mind to figure it out.
[1:17:27] But God in his infinite wisdom.
[1:17:32] literally blow the minds of this last
[1:17:35] day theologians
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; and took a man that did not have an
[1:17:40] education,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; did not know how to say pullpit, right?
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Did not have the the the quite eloquence
[1:17:50] of a lot of speakers. But God through
[1:17:52] that instrumentality
[1:17:55] spoke through that and unveiled himself
[1:17:57] to the bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:18:00] whispered the secrets to you this
[1:18:02] morning.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says before he ever
[1:18:09] printed the word, he said and this is in
[1:18:12] his mind. He said here it is. This is in
[1:18:15] the mind of God that he brought before
[1:18:17] the foundation of the world that was
[1:18:20] ever laid. He said, "That's the reason
[1:18:22] we can put it on printed word and say
[1:18:24] that it would be." And because he saw it
[1:18:27] before the foundation of the world and
[1:18:30] knew just exactly what it would be and
[1:18:33] spoke it out and then he handed down his
[1:18:35] knowledge to the prophets and they wrote
[1:18:38] it out year by year, century by century.
[1:18:41] And we see it coming to pass just
[1:18:43] exactly. God giving us shadows of the
[1:18:46] old, of the foreshadow of the new. We
[1:18:49] see the word of word by word being
[1:18:52] fulfilled. What faith that we ought to
[1:18:55] have in the established in God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; He said the mind of Christ is is to be
[1:19:02] in the church. And the mind of God was
[1:19:05] in Christ. And how that spirit led
[1:19:07] Christ ought to with his spirit lead the
[1:19:11] church. And all that was God was he
[1:19:13] poured into Christ. And all that Christ
[1:19:16] was he poured into the church. And so
[1:19:19] the church has the power that Christ
[1:19:22] has. And Christ had the power that God
[1:19:24] had. And he said, "At that day, you'll
[1:19:27] know that I'm in the Father and the
[1:19:29] Father in me and I in you and you in
[1:19:33] me."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; So it's not even a question anymore.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get a real revelation
[1:19:39] of who you are,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; the rapture can't take place without
[1:19:42] you.
[1:19:44] Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Bombs can't drop on your head without
[1:19:48] you being gone because you got an
[1:19:50] inoculation of the Holy Ghost of a token
[1:19:54] sign.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Christ revealed when he's in his own
[1:20:00] word. He said, "My words are spirit and
[1:20:03] life." And Jesus said that again. The
[1:20:05] word is the seed that the ser. And we
[1:20:08] know that's true. And he said it's the
[1:20:11] it's God in word form. And it can only
[1:20:13] be interpreted by himself. The human
[1:20:16] mind is not capable to interpret the
[1:20:19] mind of God. He said, "How can a little
[1:20:22] infinite mind, a little finite mind,
[1:20:25] excuse me, interpret the infinite mind?"
[1:20:28] He says, "We can't even interpret one
[1:20:31] another's mind."
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; How true that is,
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; man. You know, as you're married to your
[1:20:37] wife, you can't even interpret her mind.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, we should have a couple
[1:20:44] You're just afraid.
[1:20:48] You young people don't know anything
[1:20:50] about that, but you'll learn one of
[1:20:51] these days. It'll be one of the quickest
[1:20:52] lessons in your whole life.
[1:21:00] Hey, brother enjoyed that.
[1:21:05] I can tell you what elephants in my
[1:21:07] living room. I don't know how well I do
[1:21:09] with that.
[1:21:17] He says when we can't even interpret one
[1:21:20] another's mind, he said you know he is
[1:21:23] the only one that can interpret it and
[1:21:25] he interprets it to whom he will.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; I would like to say this morning I'm
[1:21:30] glad to know tonight that I have been a
[1:21:34] privilege.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; I was thinking this morning as I was I
[1:21:40] was looking at this quote potentially.
[1:21:44] The most educated in the world can't sit
[1:21:47] where we're sitting today.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I hope that just seems I am going to
[1:21:56] approach this a little differently this
[1:21:58] morning. But I I want you to understand
[1:22:00] sometimes we forget who we really are.
[1:22:03] And we we get so caught up with this
[1:22:05] life and the busyiness of this life and
[1:22:07] our jobs and and and our busyiness about
[1:22:11] life. Satan's learned a real trick to
[1:22:14] keep us busy.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And if he can't keep us busy, he'll
[1:22:17] entertain us.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And then when we come to church, we're
[1:22:21] almost like zombies and we're sitting
[1:22:22] here and we're here just for maybe a
[1:22:24] couple of hours and we're just kind of
[1:22:26] going through the motions of it. And
[1:22:28] whether we know us or not, sometimes we
[1:22:29] need just kind of laugh of who we really
[1:22:32] are. Listen,
[1:22:34] no disrespect, but the queen of England
[1:22:36] is not sitting where you're at this
[1:22:38] point.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And she gets pumped and splintered and
[1:22:42] all the servants around her to take care
[1:22:44] of her every little whalem.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And you said, "Oh, I'd like to have
[1:22:48] that." But you don't realize in another
[1:22:50] room there are angels of God
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; that are with you every moment that you
[1:22:57] go.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When you go down the
[1:23:00] street, listen, you've got a better
[1:23:02] surveillance unit around you than the
[1:23:05] president of the United States.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; They're walking out there. They got all
[1:23:12] their insurancees and their umbrella
[1:23:14] policies and and they've got their ADT
[1:23:17] alarms and they got every kind of alarm
[1:23:19] system and the security systems and you
[1:23:22] got God.
[1:23:27] And the angels of God are dispatched
[1:23:29] around you. And listen, the devil can't
[1:23:32] get to you. Nothing can harm you until
[1:23:35] your purpose has been fulfilled.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Stonewall Jackson. He was standing in
[1:23:43] the middle of a in the middle of the
[1:23:45] war, right close to where we lived. And
[1:23:47] he was standing there where he got his
[1:23:49] name, Stonewall. They looked and the
[1:23:51] battle was raging and bullets were
[1:23:52] flying and they were going every which
[1:23:55] way. And the men were retreating and
[1:23:57] some going forward and they looked out
[1:23:59] there and he was just standing. He was
[1:24:01] standing on his horse like a like a
[1:24:03] stone wall. And they said he stands like
[1:24:05] a stonewall. And they later asked him
[1:24:08] says how can you do that? Brother called
[1:24:10] him the greatest general other than
[1:24:12] other than Joshua. And he said I am as
[1:24:15] safe
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; on the battlefield.
[1:24:19] That's right.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "As I am at home in my bed,
[1:24:25] because I know God."
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you come to that
[1:24:33] assurance in your life that I am a
[1:24:36] saint, brother, aren't you worried about
[1:24:38] the conditions of the world? Aren't you
[1:24:40] worried about Sodom? I want you to know
[1:24:42] I was built to overcome all that.
[1:24:46] He had a word that was pre-planned for
[1:24:48] us
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; that anointed us in a special l
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; to call us to a higher order.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Come up.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; And so we said this morning, I want you
[1:25:00] to understand you are in the world's
[1:25:03] exclusive company this morning.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh brother, I can't wait
[1:25:10] till we get there till we see everybody.
[1:25:12] You're in a good company this morning.
[1:25:18] Hallelujah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He is the only one that can interpret
[1:25:22] it. He interpreted to whom he will.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It didn't say mortals of all as they
[1:25:28] strove across the country in standard
[1:25:29] times. He said God in standard times and
[1:25:33] diverse manners revealed himself to the
[1:25:36] prophets.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Invisible. He said, "Now notice the
[1:25:41] anointed word of his day of which you
[1:25:43] are a part of by predestination."
[1:25:46] He said, "Like you." He says, "New. When
[1:25:49] you heard that, you knew right quick
[1:25:52] that you was an eagle."
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; When the word came, you identified
[1:25:59] yourself with the word.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Listen, whatever seed that you are of,
[1:26:04] listen, the word identifies what you
[1:26:07] are. And if you don't have a receptor to
[1:26:09] it, if there's not something that pulls
[1:26:11] you to it, it lets you know the response
[1:26:14] to the word lets you know where you're
[1:26:17] from.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; It reflects the inheritance of where you
[1:26:22] are. So it should tell you this morning,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the rapture. There's
[1:26:27] something inside of me that responds to
[1:26:30] that word.
[1:26:35] Yes, sir.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; You know that there's something. He
[1:26:37] says, he said, you also realize that you
[1:26:40] was not a denominational ticket to begin
[1:26:43] with.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You know there's something wrong there.
[1:26:46] There's something wrong. That's right.
[1:26:49] For you know that you're trapped into it
[1:26:51] at the beginning. He the bridegroom took
[1:26:54] away your shame and put it in the sea of
[1:26:56] God's forgiveness by the washing of the
[1:26:59] water, by the word, the blood of life.
[1:27:01] That's what the Bible said. Your first
[1:27:03] husband that you were married to the
[1:27:05] world, the anointing, the anointed
[1:27:07] bridegroom which fordained you has
[1:27:10] washed you by the washing of the word
[1:27:12] water of the water by the church. He
[1:27:15] says that don't sound right, does it? He
[1:27:16] says you might find that in an almanac.
[1:27:18] He said, but not in God's Bible, but by
[1:27:21] the washing of the water by the word. He
[1:27:23] said the word you're standing completely
[1:27:26] justified as though you never did it.
[1:27:30] You never did it at the beginning.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him with all your heart?
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He says, "You are pure."
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; And you may not think that way this
[1:27:43] morning,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; but you are pure.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; I'd rather take God's word than man's
[1:27:48] way.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; You have critics just like I have
[1:27:53] critics, and they look at your flaws
[1:27:55] like we talked about last night. They
[1:27:57] look at your mistakes. But when God
[1:27:59] looks at you, that's the one that you
[1:28:02] are still.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; You're spotless for the run because he
[1:28:09] became us that we might become him. He
[1:28:12] watched us.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Luther could never figure it out.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He can never figure it out.
[1:28:22] Justification, but he really didn't know
[1:28:23] the whole realm of it.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; But in this day, we can enjoy
[1:28:28] We can enjoy justification
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; because no matter what lifestyle that we
[1:28:33] had,
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; no matter what lifestyle that we came
[1:28:39] from,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; and I want to just come right to you
[1:28:41] this morning, young people, you're
[1:28:43] sitting here, you may be wrestling with
[1:28:44] friends of past.
[1:28:46] And you, this may be only to one or two,
[1:28:49] but I want you to understand, maybe
[1:28:50] you're sitting here this morning and you
[1:28:52] wrestle and you leave this meeting and
[1:28:54] you go back and and you you've got
[1:28:56] friends that are there and they pull
[1:28:59] they pull away from you and you pull a
[1:29:01] revival out of you and you seem to lose
[1:29:03] it seal, you're going to have to fight.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight to keep
[1:29:12] the overcoming power in your life. the
[1:29:16] one I thought the pillar of fire would
[1:29:18] would come down inside of me and I feel
[1:29:19] him all the time. He's sometimes going
[1:29:21] to lead you like an orphan child to see
[1:29:24] what you will do.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; What do I look to? You look to the word.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; You look to the ministry that has been
[1:29:33] given to you. And if you fall fat on
[1:29:36] your face next week, don't quit. Get
[1:29:38] back up.
[1:29:43] So many times we're looking for a
[1:29:45] utopia. We're looking for everything,
[1:29:47] all of our problems to go away. No, God
[1:29:50] just brought us here to give us
[1:29:52] strength.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; He brought us here to give us strength
[1:29:56] to overcome our problems.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this morning,
[1:30:04] every one of us have to fight a battle.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; But we have been pre-built, pre-esigned,
[1:30:10] created that we can overcome.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; You'll find witness when you keep going
[1:30:22] back to the world and keep feeding from
[1:30:24] the world.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Brother was he brought the illustration
[1:30:28] of the Indian, the two dogs fighting
[1:30:30] within him.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Which one's winning?" And
[1:30:34] he said, "It's the one that I feed the
[1:30:36] most."
[1:30:37] And you will find carnality gets control
[1:30:39] if you feed carnality.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, I want you to understand. I know
[1:30:48] young people sometimes you say, "Well,
[1:30:50] brother, I I just I just I just I can't
[1:30:52] read the message all day long. I can't
[1:30:54] listen to tapes all day long." But I
[1:30:57] want you to know, you must develop a
[1:30:59] time.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; You must develop a time. You must
[1:31:05] develop a plan
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; to feed your soul.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; As much as you get up in the morning and
[1:31:12] eat scrambled eggs and sausage and you
[1:31:15] eat your cereal, you must develop a time
[1:31:18] to feed yourself on the un unveiled word
[1:31:21] of this day
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; because that is the word that is
[1:31:24] anointed to help you to overcome.
[1:31:30] I want you to understand the television
[1:31:33] broadcast don't have rapturing faith on
[1:31:35] them.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Oprah Winfrey don't have rapturing
[1:31:39] faith.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Donald Trump don't have rapturing faith.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Movies don't have rapturing faith.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; But you've been given a complex word
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; that is revealed to the bride of Jesus
[1:31:56] Christ.
[1:31:58] The mystery of God revealed, the
[1:32:00] unveiling of God, paradox, the rapture,
[1:32:04] things that are to be, modern events
[1:32:06] made clear by prophecy.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has raptured
[1:32:13] inside of that.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; When you come to church, which you
[1:32:18] should come to church,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; everybody needs a pastor. Even brother
[1:32:21] Brown had a pastor. Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand. Oh,
[1:32:29] brother, I caught something right there.
[1:32:30] He said, "Brother Ron, brother didn't
[1:32:32] have a pastor." He sure did. He went
[1:32:34] listen to brother Neville.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This morning when brother
[1:32:37] Neville preached, I got 50 sermons."
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. I heard everything that
[1:32:48] Brother Ed's got to say. I've got news
[1:32:50] for you. He may preach a sermon 27
[1:32:53] times, but he'll never preach it the
[1:32:54] same way.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; And you're you're a blessed people to
[1:33:04] have a man of God.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; You're a blessed people to have a man of
[1:33:09] God.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; That stood with the prophet of God
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; that was there in the supernatural.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; There are very few of them. Right.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Very few of these men still standing.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, I tell you what. Are they
[1:33:23] heroes? I say more than heroes.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; More than heroes.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The voice of living waters that
[1:33:31] screaming out.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; They fought for the day.
[1:33:47] Hallelujah.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; The way I feel, I just might as well
[1:33:53] set.
[1:34:01] He said, "Oh, that spiritual union of
[1:34:03] Christ is in his church now when the
[1:34:06] flesh is becoming word
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; and the word is becoming flesh.
[1:34:13] Take the elbow and punch out like that.
[1:34:15] Right there.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; There's the word
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; becoming flesh.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about necessarily you
[1:34:22] either.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand he said
[1:34:26] manifested, vindicated. Just what the
[1:34:28] Bible said would happen in this day.
[1:34:30] It's happening day by day. Why? It's
[1:34:33] accumulating so fast out there on those
[1:34:36] deserts and the things taking place that
[1:34:38] I can't even keep up with it. We're
[1:34:40] nearing the coming of Jesus till you be
[1:34:43] united with his church where the work
[1:34:46] becomes the work. He said the call of
[1:34:48] the Holy Spirit searching the hearts.
[1:34:50] You're standing completely. You never
[1:34:52] sin in the first place. God didn't even
[1:34:55] know. It's in the sea of forgiveness.
[1:34:57] You never did it. You were accused by
[1:35:00] the accuser. But really from the
[1:35:02] beginning, you were predestinated to be
[1:35:05] a son and a daughter of God.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You're standing. You better watch.
[1:35:12] Your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:35:15] and it's dead.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely out of it of existence. Even
[1:35:19] in the mind of God, you are the virtuous
[1:35:22] body of Christ washed in the blood of
[1:35:25] Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless, the
[1:35:29] son of God, standing with the pure,
[1:35:31] unadulterated, bride word that he has
[1:35:34] washed by the water of his own word,
[1:35:36] blood that become flesh and manifested,
[1:35:39] that he might take you, which you were
[1:35:41] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:35:44] from the beginning.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That's what he thinks about you.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It ain't good to us.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; I want you just to notice. He says this
[1:35:58] and turn on the light. He says, "But you
[1:36:00] take the sun that shines in August and
[1:36:02] put it on the wheat today, it would kill
[1:36:03] it." Certainly, you can't do that. It
[1:36:05] must come in its season. And so must
[1:36:08] God's wheat, God, grain, ripen just the
[1:36:11] season, the season it's in. He said,
[1:36:14] "But how could a son Well, a wheat would
[1:36:17] die. The fruits would die by the sun
[1:36:19] that lives today that shines today
[1:36:22] rather its oncoming harvest is ripening.
[1:36:25] The grain would mature with the light
[1:36:27] should mature with the light. But the
[1:36:29] thing of it is the church grain don't
[1:36:31] want to mature. It wants to stay back in
[1:36:34] Moody's time and sink time and finish
[1:36:37] time and Knox and Calvin.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Now that don't apply too much to you
[1:36:43] today, but it does to the denominational
[1:36:46] world. Are you with me? But because you
[1:36:49] were of a predestinated plan, you came
[1:36:51] right through that.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, they were carriers, but you saw the
[1:36:57] advancement of the light. Isaiah 6, she
[1:37:00] says, "Arise and shine.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Thy light has come.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; This is another hour. This is another
[1:37:09] day. This is the advancement of the
[1:37:11] gospel coming to its maturity. So we
[1:37:14] can't live in what Luther said, what
[1:37:17] Wesley said, or some of the rest of
[1:37:19] them. We're living in the light that's
[1:37:21] predicted for this
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:37:28] I I I just want to I just want to go
[1:37:32] here if it's okay.
[1:37:34] So many people has an idea of the
[1:37:36] rapture.
[1:37:40] They got all kind of ideas of trains
[1:37:42] crashing and planes crashing and
[1:37:45] hospitals being empty.
[1:37:48] Gabriel coming out on a cloud and
[1:37:50] blowing his trumpet and the whole world
[1:37:51] hearing it.
[1:37:57] And the scripture plainly says that
[1:37:58] he'll come as a thief in the night.
[1:38:03] We've heard we've heard a call come out
[1:38:05] of her many people
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; and that rapture message has put you in
[1:38:11] process
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; and what they were looking for they
[1:38:17] missed it.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? They're expecting
[1:38:21] to stand on the street corner and say
[1:38:24] there's wrecks down here
[1:38:26] and they're standing to stay where
[1:38:27] there's chaos down here. But I want you
[1:38:30] to know way before all those things
[1:38:32] begin to take place, we're going to be
[1:38:35] gone.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Now I I want you to notice in in First
[1:38:42] Thessalonians, I started to go there
[1:38:44] last night. I did go down there to
[1:38:45] chapter 4, but I want to go to chapter
[1:38:48] 5, verse one. He says, "But at the times
[1:38:50] of the season, brethren, you have no
[1:38:52] need that I write unto you. For
[1:38:54] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:38:57] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:38:59] night."
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, if a thief breaks in, he's
[1:39:03] not going to wake you up.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come to your bedroom
[1:39:07] first and wake you up and char you and
[1:39:09] say, "Uh, Tom, we're going to steal
[1:39:11] everything that you got."
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It's going to be quite the opposite.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; The last person in the world They're
[1:39:19] going to wake up. It's
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; time.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand, our Lord
[1:39:24] has given us a notice.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; And they that love his appearance
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; are going to be on a condition or an
[1:39:34] anointing
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; to be caught away in the word.
[1:39:40] Now, just as it was in the days of
[1:39:41] martyrs, listen, you and I don't have
[1:39:44] the we don't have the anointing to live
[1:39:46] in the day days of martyrdom where they
[1:39:49] took their children and they slayed
[1:39:51] their children. Are you with me? And
[1:39:54] they took the men to the to the post and
[1:39:56] they burned them at the stake or
[1:39:58] crucified them upside down or all the
[1:40:00] horrible the atrocities that they did to
[1:40:03] them. But they were under anointing for
[1:40:06] their day.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; But you are on under a different kind of
[1:40:10] anointing.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You're under a rapture anointing.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Your anointing is completely different.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Lman, I I you know, I could have
[1:40:22] never given my life. It wasn't your call
[1:40:24] to do that.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand here you
[1:40:27] are going to overcome layout of sin.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; They read the same scriptures that we
[1:40:34] read.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; They know the same quotations that we go
[1:40:37] to. But you It's not a church anointing.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; It's not a religious anointing. It's an
[1:40:44] anointing from the mighty angel
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; that has come upon you.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, you didn't beg for it. You
[1:40:51] didn't bleed for it. You didn't pull it
[1:40:53] down. But God has manifested it.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You were pressurized to live in this
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:41:10] He says now Christ revealed his own word
[1:41:13] again. He said now we know that God
[1:41:15] chose by predestination his church,
[1:41:19] his place, his prophets and all about
[1:41:22] it. By fornowledge he predestinated his
[1:41:25] prophet and when he when the age arrived
[1:41:28] he had his prophet arrive at the same
[1:41:30] time and inspired him as he wrote the
[1:41:33] Bible by him. Now God wrote the Bible
[1:41:36] only use of the prophet because that's
[1:41:38] his way of doing it. He said you see it
[1:41:41] is it is not the word you. So see it is
[1:41:44] the word of God and not the word of a
[1:41:47] man. God is a person. God can speak. God
[1:41:51] can talk. God can write.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it that way. But
[1:41:57] that's the way that he chose to do it.
[1:41:59] He didn't have to do it that way. But he
[1:42:01] chose to do it that way. God wrote with
[1:42:04] his finger. He he he he his majest his
[1:42:07] own majestic finger the ten
[1:42:08] commandments. So God could write it
[1:42:11] himself if he wanted to. But he chose to
[1:42:13] write it through the prophets because it
[1:42:15] was his attributes his word and he
[1:42:18] expressed through them making it part
[1:42:21] and a part of him. He could write with
[1:42:23] his finger. He also r his finger and
[1:42:25] wrote on the walls of Babylon thou way
[1:42:27] in the balance and found one. God can
[1:42:30] talk. He said you believe God can talk.
[1:42:33] He talked to Moses on the mount of
[1:42:34] burning bush. You believe that? He
[1:42:37] talked to John from in the form of a
[1:42:39] dove. You believe that? And said, "This
[1:42:41] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:42:43] pleased to dwell in." He talked to him.
[1:42:45] He spoke to Jesus on the Mount of
[1:42:47] Transfiguration before Peter, James, and
[1:42:49] John. He can talk. He's not mute. He can
[1:42:53] talk.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother, I want to hear him
[1:42:56] talk." You are.
[1:43:03] There's never been a day when his voice
[1:43:05] was m not not not no more louder than
[1:43:09] this day.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; This day that he revealed himself to the
[1:43:12] voice of a prophet of God.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said there's so many voices
[1:43:18] in the land today. Powerful voices.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Voices that might even shake nations.
[1:43:24] Might even confuse people.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? People get their eyes
[1:43:29] on this televangelist and that
[1:43:32] televangelist. He's the latest in the
[1:43:34] click. Listen, many of them are only
[1:43:36] using this voice.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Many of them are only taking a part
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; of what the prophet said and breaking it
[1:43:45] down to their denominational filter.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we had a sure word.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; It didn't come out of a cemetery
[1:43:55] seminary. It didn't come from some dead
[1:43:58] theology.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; It didn't come from Uriah Smith.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It came from the mind
[1:44:05] of God.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And you're magnetized. You have a
[1:44:11] trained ear. I want you to understand
[1:44:14] there was a forained word to a forain
[1:44:17] predestinated s. And when you heard that
[1:44:20] word, you were not satisfied with the
[1:44:22] voices of the world.
[1:44:27] I'm sorry, Dr. Nelson, don't do it for
[1:44:29] me.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, John Haggy. Don't do it for
[1:44:34] them.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, TDJs, don't do it for me.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; All of their anointed. Sure, they're
[1:44:41] anointed.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; They're anointed false prophets of the
[1:44:44] day, but we've had one.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've had one.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Graham said, I just found it the
[1:44:53] other day. He said they'll have their
[1:44:54] mega churches and they do.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; They have their 35,000, their 25,000s.
[1:45:01] They have their Jos preaching, so here I
[1:45:03] am.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; They have their voices of psychology.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; They asked Joel the other day on a on a
[1:45:14] radio broadcast, why don't you why do
[1:45:16] you not even preach against sin? He
[1:45:18] said, sin is a matter of thinking.
[1:45:23] What is it? They want a church of their
[1:45:25] own choosing.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; They want a Jesus of their own making.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they want. They want
[1:45:34] some religious order.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Make nothing to change their lives.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I believe this message will not only
[1:45:40] will not only call you to a higher
[1:45:42] calling, but it'll transform your life.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Listen, the
[1:45:52] religious system don't want to don't
[1:45:53] want to buckle down to the word because
[1:45:55] it would ruin their societies.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The Jezebels that sit
[1:46:02] in their lips
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; can wear a dress or a bikini, whatever
[1:46:07] they want, to the to church,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; stand at the choir and sing the songs of
[1:46:12] Zion and live like hell.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; It only shows we're a part of the song.
[1:46:19] We're in this solemn condition
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; and the ministries of Sodom, that's all
[1:46:25] they've got to preach to because it's
[1:46:27] the law of supply and demand.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; They may have started out with good
[1:46:32] intentions.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. They may have started
[1:46:38] out kind of the right way, but because
[1:46:42] Are you with me now? But because of the
[1:46:44] compromising spirit
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; and the political framework within the
[1:46:49] church and their fear of their
[1:46:51] pocketbook,
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; brother one, why does preachers go to
[1:46:58] pocketbooks? Listen, if you can't trust
[1:47:00] God with your ties
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; and men with your ties, I wouldn't trust
[1:47:04] him with my soul.
[1:47:13] And you say, "Oh, brother Ron, you guys
[1:47:14] preach on tithes." I want you to know
[1:47:16] it's a biblical order
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; and it's a biblical command.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And God will either bless you by it or
[1:47:22] curse you by it.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; I would hate to stand there that day on
[1:47:26] that day and and a piece of money be
[1:47:28] between me and God.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We preach on hair. We
[1:47:36] preach on how they dress. We preach on
[1:47:38] big city men in charge. Why don't us
[1:47:41] preach on ti?
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; I can't afford to pay tithe. I got news
[1:47:48] for you. You can't afford not to pay.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; God can do more with 90 than he can do
[1:47:58] with a 100 every day of the week.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; You guys can straighten this out later.
[1:48:08] Come on, church. I've been a
[1:48:10] businessman.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Still, I'm a businessman. And I can
[1:48:14] prove to you.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; I can prove to you that God will bless
[1:48:18] your business when you pay tax.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; He will bless your household when you
[1:48:21] pay tax. He'll bless your life. He'll
[1:48:24] bless your health. He'll bless your
[1:48:26] children.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; He's commanded a blessing upon you.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:42] See, we're to take dominion over every
[1:48:44] every aspect of our life.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Dominion over our job,
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; dominion over our own money,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; dominion over our temper,
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; dominion over everything of our lives.
[1:48:56] We're supposed to bring ourselves as a
[1:48:58] husband and wife under submission to one
[1:49:00] another. Bring our children in
[1:49:02] submission to the word and to the token
[1:49:04] of the hour. And I'll tell you what you
[1:49:06] can do. You can open the windows of
[1:49:07] heaven and God will pour out a blessing
[1:49:10] on you.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:49:30] prophets did not always understand what
[1:49:32] they were writing,
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; what they were saying,
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; or that they in no wise would have it
[1:49:37] said.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; He said if they didn't understand it, he
[1:49:40] said, but the Bible said they were moved
[1:49:41] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Moved. I pray that God moves us this
[1:49:46] morning.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; He said they were moved by the Holy
[1:49:51] Ghost. He said, "When the Holy Ghost
[1:49:53] moves you, you move."
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting on tomorrow. When the Holy
[1:49:57] Ghost moves you in this meeting, you
[1:49:59] move.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; When he comes to you, you come. Are you
[1:50:02] with me now?
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; He won't always do that. The spirit
[1:50:05] won't always strive with men.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Five wise, five foolish. Are you with me
[1:50:10] now?
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; The wise, they moved.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; They made sure they had all in their
[1:50:16] laps.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; They were very diligent. They were
[1:50:19] zealous to repent. They grab that all.
[1:50:22] They grab that anointing.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm afraid it might make me act
[1:50:27] a little bit different. It will.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; It will. If you get it just right, it
[1:50:32] will make you act different. You'll get
[1:50:34] so excited coming to church. Tell your
[1:50:37] friends won't understand it.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; It'll make you so excited.
[1:50:42] Amen.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; It'll make you so excited when you hear
[1:50:46] brother Rod begin to lead sing or
[1:50:48] whoever's ladies sing and he begins to
[1:50:50] sing about the songs of Zion. You
[1:50:53] identify
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; you identify with that song because
[1:50:59] that's where you're going.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; It's heaven or not California or bust or
[1:51:06] bust. It's heaven or bus.
[1:51:14] Hallelujah.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; It's good to
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to just notice we quoted this
[1:51:26] before, but I want to go here. He says,
[1:51:27] "Everyone now there's there's just no
[1:51:29] revival. Everybody's complaining,
[1:51:32] ministers crying. I was in one of the
[1:51:34] outstanding papers that comes to the
[1:51:36] church, a very fine paper. I know the
[1:51:38] editor. I know the people.
[1:51:40] Knowing them didn't save them.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; He said a very fine paper. He said, "I
[1:51:46] know them. I know the I know the people.
[1:51:49] They're godly people. They're very
[1:51:50] fine." Brother and sister are the herald
[1:51:53] of his coming. One of the finest papers
[1:51:55] on the field. Herald of his coming.
[1:51:57] Hardly will print anything unless it's
[1:51:59] about fast and pray. Fast and pray.
[1:52:02] Sound a trumpet. He said, "How many
[1:52:04] reads it?" He said, "You know,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; notice what he says here." And you know,
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; and listen, and you know,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; you know what I've already said is true.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Just as much as I said this about about
[1:52:18] the the denominations of the day, they
[1:52:20] don't have anything.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; They're pointing you back to revival of
[1:52:25] two or 300 years ago,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; the glad of another day. And brother
[1:52:30] said, "That's the greatest robbery."
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; You with me now? I want you to
[1:52:37] understand there's an updated revival.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about one in 1965.
[1:52:44] I'm talking about one of this
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; because the emphasis of God is right
[1:52:50] now.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; We had to learn. It's in our hearts.
[1:52:56] Now, what will we do with that?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Fast and pray. Fast
[1:53:04] and pray." He says, you know, he said,
[1:53:07] "Fast and pray. That's all you hear.
[1:53:08] Fast and pray. We're going to have a
[1:53:10] great breaking of the day. There's a
[1:53:12] great thing that's going to happen. All
[1:53:14] of you. Pray. Pray. Pray. We're not too
[1:53:16] late yet." Why are they doing that? Why
[1:53:19] did they do that? They want a great
[1:53:21] awakening. They're crying, believing
[1:53:23] that there will be an awakening. They're
[1:53:25] good people. Why is it? They Why haven't
[1:53:27] they done that? They have not recognized
[1:53:30] the awakening of the bride. By being a
[1:53:33] Christian, they feel the pull of the
[1:53:34] hour.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave this quote without
[1:53:39] going to to your house. He said that's
[1:53:41] what they may that's what's making them
[1:53:43] feel that way.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; They know something's happened.
[1:53:46] Something something's supposed to
[1:53:48] happen, but they're looking for it way
[1:53:50] off in the future to come when it's
[1:53:52] already happened right by you.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, let me just
[1:53:58] say this to you. Don't let that be your
[1:54:01] testimony this morning.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let the awakening of the word of
[1:54:06] this day ever to become familiar to you.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, the message, I've got it
[1:54:15] made, the message is more than books and
[1:54:17] tapes.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; End time evangelism is more than quotes.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; There's a life that comes with this.
[1:54:26] That's a life of overcoming life of a
[1:54:29] transforming.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Sure, there's people that sit right
[1:54:33] here. They feel the pull.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; They feel the fool. Are you with me?
[1:54:37] They feel the pull. We need to get
[1:54:39] closer to God.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; But don't wait too late.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Don't wait till next year's meeting.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; How long does it take?
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus was on the mountain. Brother, what
[1:54:54] is the on the mountain. Seven days
[1:54:56] later, he was in a tomb.
[1:55:02] Think about this morning. Oh, brother. I
[1:55:04] can wait a few days. I got news for you.
[1:55:06] You've already seen in the events of
[1:55:08] just the last month
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; how fast the whole world can change.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Earthquakes has happened this week while
[1:55:20] I've been here.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Things have While we've been secluded at
[1:55:25] this camp,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; world conditions changing, what they're
[1:55:30] talking about in the in the back rooms
[1:55:32] of powers to a one world government, uh
[1:55:36] the the nations coming together. I want
[1:55:38] you to know the hand of God is turning
[1:55:40] very quickly.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Why is it? It's because we're returning
[1:55:44] to the season. We come into the season
[1:55:47] of it's not way off somewhere. It's
[1:55:51] happening right now among us. If we can
[1:55:54] only catch what is going on.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Open see nothing great. The fastest
[1:56:00] acceleration of growth takes place at
[1:56:03] the last stage when the stuff is up high
[1:56:06] and it can't seem to grow.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Everybody can see it during the sun and
[1:56:10] and it's growing and growing and growing
[1:56:12] quickly. But when it's at the last stage
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; when the maturity starts taking place
[1:56:18] that is the fastest acceleration of
[1:56:20] growth. when the sea is replicating
[1:56:23] itself.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young people, listen. You
[1:56:28] don't have to wait two years, 5 years.
[1:56:31] Let the word replicate itself in your
[1:56:34] life.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait till you get
[1:56:38] married. You don't have to wait till you
[1:56:40] have children. Listen, let that word so
[1:56:43] fill your heart.
[1:56:50] Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; He said they're right now uniting.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Brother, is that true? They're coming to
[1:56:57] the battle of Armageddon.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly what they will do.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; And they are coming.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; We're seeing pre-tribulation times even
[1:57:05] now.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; He says they're uniting for it right
[1:57:08] now. He said that's why we we've got to
[1:57:11] a and everything that we have. The
[1:57:14] western world is united against the
[1:57:15] eastern world. But then it goes to
[1:57:17] communism and so forth. It's all united
[1:57:19] together. The churches are uniting
[1:57:21] together. Everything seems to be
[1:57:23] uniting. Uniting uniting themselves
[1:57:26] together. We see that.
[1:57:30] Say, "Brother Ron, how's those
[1:57:31] churches?" This is the umbilical cord is
[1:57:33] father, son, holy ghost baptism.
[1:57:36] actually go to court right back to Rome.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I was standing with a with a lady one
[1:57:45] time and she was she was a secretary
[1:57:48] within the Catholic church
[1:57:54] and it was actually working for her and
[1:57:58] so we begin to talk
[1:58:01] and she's she said are you a Christian?
[1:58:03] I said yes. Yes, I am. She said, "You
[1:58:06] know, we're all one big church."
[1:58:11] Well, here we go.
[1:58:14] And I said, "How do you mean?" She says,
[1:58:16] "Well, it's kind of like this." Said,
[1:58:20] "Everybody's Catholic."
[1:58:23] I said, "Well, how do you mean that?"
[1:58:25] She says, "Well," she said, "In the
[1:58:28] Catholic system," says we have
[1:58:29] daughters.
[1:58:35] And I said, "Uh, are you sure about
[1:58:37] that?" She said, "Oh, yeah. We've got
[1:58:38] daughters." Said, "We allow them to call
[1:58:40] themselves Methodist, Baptist,
[1:58:43] Presbyterian." She went right down the
[1:58:45] lines.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; She said, "But the umbilical cord," and
[1:58:48] listen how she so quotes the message.
[1:58:50] The umbilical cord is the trinitarian
[1:58:53] baptism.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It is the umbilical cord that holds them
[1:58:58] all together. And I looked at her and I
[1:59:00] said, "I'm not one of them."
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; She said, "What do you mean?" I told
[1:59:13] her, I said, "We believe a message of
[1:59:15] Malachi 4 that brought us back to the
[1:59:18] original word,
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; the original baptism of Acts 2:es 38.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; We're the same message believers." She
[1:59:26] said, "You are our enemy.
[1:59:37] Hallelujah.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; I am proud to be identified as her
[1:59:43] enemy.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; If Antipus and I may not be saying that
[1:59:48] exactly right,
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; but as he as he was stood, listen, God
[1:59:53] had him standing in the middle of the
[1:59:55] seat of Satan and he overcome. And if he
[1:59:58] can stand there, so can I.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; I'm glad to repair the reproach of Jesus
[2:00:06] Christ in this day.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'd like to be there.
[2:00:11] Listen, you have a greater testimony
[2:00:13] even today.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew children will stand
[2:00:17] there in awe of you.
[2:00:20] in all of you that you overcome this day
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; in these solemn conditions when they
[2:00:26] don't even know which is supposed to get
[2:00:28] married. Man, woman, woman, man. All the
[2:00:31] woman, woman, man, man,
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; hip.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; We get to all the pieces about 911 and
[2:00:44] and America kills more babies in one day
[2:00:47] than was killed on 911.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; I still call it murder.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not going political. I'm just
[2:00:57] calling out sin.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; But we have had an advancement.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; We may live in Sodom, but we're not
[2:01:05] upside.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We may our bodies may be
[2:01:10] trapped in Leosa, but we're caught up
[2:01:12] into a bride.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; God is uniting his bride. She's coming
[2:01:20] together from the east, the west, the
[2:01:22] north, and the south. And no truer
[2:01:24] church could say that tonight.
[2:01:27] He said there's a uniting time and
[2:01:29] that's on right now. What she's united
[2:01:32] for. United for the rapture.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; God's getting her ready.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; United what she united with with the
[2:01:41] word. The heavens and earth will pass
[2:01:43] away but my word shall never pass away.
[2:01:47] She's uniting herself with thus sayith
[2:01:50] the Lord. Regardless of what the name
[2:01:52] denomination or anybody else says. She's
[2:01:55] uniting herself. She's getting ready.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; She's putting on the wedding.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; for the lamb's wife
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; has made herself ready.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; And to her that she was granted that she
[2:02:16] should be arrayed and fine women.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; We have been well clothed with the cloth
[2:02:22] of the word.
[2:02:24] Hallelujah.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not some modern day
[2:02:28] strip tease. We have been well clothed
[2:02:31] with the word.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; It has covered every corner. It's
[2:02:35] covered every facet.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Brother, everything's not in the
[2:02:44] message. Okay. Let me give you an
[2:02:46] example.
[2:02:48] My little boy, my second one, of course,
[2:02:53] had temper tons when he was a baby
[2:02:58] because he's born
[2:03:01] just like his mother.
[2:03:12] I will stand to correct that.
[2:03:15] I go home and live with her.
[2:03:20] You know that I'm redhead and you know
[2:03:22] where that comes from.
[2:03:26] But I want you to understand we took him
[2:03:29] to he would he would just literally just
[2:03:31] pass out. He just pass out. He'd go into
[2:03:35] pass.
[2:03:37] We went on a month with that thing. You
[2:03:40] know, we'd blow in his mouth and we'd
[2:03:42] shake him and we'd do everything in the
[2:03:44] world. We you know we were just
[2:03:46] terrified of the events.
[2:03:48] So we took him to the hospital one night
[2:03:50] cuz he had a really bad abs episode. My
[2:03:52] dad said you didn't take that boy to the
[2:03:53] hospital said something wrong with him.
[2:03:55] So we took him to the hospital. The
[2:03:57] doctor looked at him and checked him out
[2:03:59] just well and you know just went over
[2:04:01] everything and came back in and sat
[2:04:03] down. He was kind of chopped up and he
[2:04:06] said you know he said some children have
[2:04:07] a little switch inside of them.
[2:04:11] He said, "Then I'll throw a little
[2:04:12] temper tantrum and they'll throw off
[2:04:14] this switch and they'll just pass out."
[2:04:17] He said, "What their craven attention?
[2:04:20] The best thing you can do is just lay
[2:04:23] them down and walk out of the room." He
[2:04:24] said, "It seems hard to do, but that's
[2:04:26] what you need to do."
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Well, we went home.
[2:04:32] I was getting ready for bed, so I was
[2:04:34] going to do a little night reading that
[2:04:36] night.
[2:04:37] I picked up the spoken word book and I
[2:04:39] just opened up the page just kind of
[2:04:40] like this and I began to read the first
[2:04:43] paragraph and brother Brandham said it's
[2:04:45] just like a little child that has a
[2:04:47] temper tantrum.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; And he says he's got kind of like a
[2:04:54] little switch that he just kind of flows
[2:04:57] off and he just passes out. He said he's
[2:05:00] craving attention. Listen, I could have
[2:05:02] saved myself $200.
[2:05:14] Oh, you're saying brother, but God's not
[2:05:15] that mindful of you. Listen, I got
[2:05:17] grounded in Cincinnati, Ohio. I was
[2:05:20] grounded, but I couldn't get on the
[2:05:21] plane. I couldn't make the first
[2:05:22] meeting. And I was just happy. You know
[2:05:24] how you are. Don't act angels.
[2:05:28] And I was just a touchy, you know, and
[2:05:30] I've been complaining to everybody and
[2:05:32] everybody that needed to be complained
[2:05:34] to. And so they finally, brother.
[2:05:41] And so anyway, they give me they give me
[2:05:44] some vouchers. What good's vouchers?
[2:05:45] They're not going to make the first
[2:05:46] night. And so I just go down, you know,
[2:05:48] and I walk and I get myself a Cinnabon.
[2:05:50] Hallelujah. Everybody needs one when
[2:05:52] they're hungry.
[2:05:56] I get myself a big old Starbucks cup of
[2:05:59] coffee. And I was sitting there just,
[2:06:00] you know, just stewing.
[2:06:03] I drank up and eat all them calories
[2:06:05] that I didn't need. Eat it today, wear
[2:06:07] it four days.
[2:06:10] Then I go down to the library and I go
[2:06:12] into the religious section. I think, you
[2:06:14] know, something's got to suit me. And I
[2:06:15] pick up a book and I open this book up
[2:06:18] and it's and it's it's a religious book
[2:06:20] and I think Charles Schuler actually the
[2:06:21] one who wrote it. Anyway, I pick it up
[2:06:23] and I open it up. He said, "You're
[2:06:24] standing in an airport. You've just been
[2:06:26] grounded and you're hung."
[2:06:32] And he said, "You God don't know where
[2:06:34] you are. Hey, I bought the book.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; God knows everything about you.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; He's pre-planned you.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; He's ordained you. He's called you. He
[2:07:01] knows exactly where you're sitting at
[2:07:02] this morning.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, he wants to go home with you.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You may miss your flight. God help me.
[2:07:08] You may miss your flight. You may have
[2:07:10] to stand four hours in line. But I want
[2:07:11] you to know he's going to stand right
[2:07:12] there with you.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we preachers have a good time,
[2:07:22] too. So that's the way it is.
[2:07:26] He said, "You see," he said, "we see
[2:07:29] nations united.
[2:07:31] We see the world uniting. We see
[2:07:34] churches uniting. We see the bride
[2:07:36] united."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; She did.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; She looks beyond our failures.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; She appreciates all the gifts in the
[2:07:44] body of Christ.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says and he says and
[2:07:52] we see the bride united with the word
[2:07:54] and the word is God and that's the word
[2:07:57] and that's the bridegroom being the word
[2:07:59] and the bride being the hearer of the
[2:08:01] word. They come together in a union.
[2:08:04] They unite like a wedding. They're
[2:08:06] getting ready for a wedding and they
[2:08:08] become one. The word becomes you and you
[2:08:12] become the word.
[2:08:14] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[2:08:17] you, ask what you will and it shall be
[2:08:20] done.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to quit. But I want you
[2:08:26] to understand this morning.
[2:08:28] You are the most powerful people there
[2:08:31] is on the earth.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; Condisa Rice, George Bush, Pal
[2:08:43] those People really think they got pull.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; They're going to straighten every
[2:08:47] situation out in the world.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Well, really what they ought to do is
[2:08:51] consult you.
[2:09:03] people in the whole world are you.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; And when you go on your knees,
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of hell
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; literally goes into a convulsion.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; You are an ambassador on the earth.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have a phony badge and a phony
[2:09:30] uniform. You got the credentials.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; You have the identification.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; You have the identification from another
[2:09:40] realm.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; That life is inside of you and it's
[2:09:45] pulling you to a higher order.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And you're only here just for a little
[2:09:49] spell. But while you're here, you are in
[2:09:52] control of your atmosphere.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; And you can just look at the enemy and
[2:09:57] say, "I don't have to put up with that.
[2:10:01] You can do that after I'm gone
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; because while I'm here, this is a
[2:10:07] sanctuary for God and myself to
[2:10:10] communicate.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take it
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; to be right side.
[2:10:26] Well, all the host of heaven will
[2:10:29] assemble.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's going to be a glorious sign.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, the saints and spotless wide.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, with Jesus, we're going to spend
[2:10:46] eternity.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, come and
[2:10:54] come and die.
[2:10:58] Oh, you made that Jesus
[2:11:02] all the time.
[2:11:09] Turn the water into
[2:11:13] the fall down
[2:11:20] through the
[2:11:22] Take his
[2:11:25] ever
[2:11:37] glorious
[2:11:51] Christine
[2:11:59] Jesus.
[2:12:22] to the air and
[2:12:25] all the host
[2:12:34] glorif
[2:12:35] All
[2:12:40] Jesus
[2:12:46] coming
[2:12:49] from
[2:12:55] Jesus
[2:12:57] all the
[2:13:00] He
[2:13:02] loves you.
[2:13:17] coming down.
[2:13:21] We
[2:13:24] all
[2:13:54] Let you have your seat for a moment.
[2:13:58] Want to make a couple of comments.
[2:14:01] We enjoy brother Ron Spencer.
[2:14:06] preaches with purity
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; and preaches with conviction
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; and preaches truth
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; and that's what we like about I'm so
[2:14:16] happy that the bride of Jesus Christ has
[2:14:18] this kind of ministry
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; and I I love the positive ministry
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; about two weeks before the camp began
[2:14:29] and although the the whole focus for a
[2:14:33] year
[2:14:35] You just hold it in your heart. And
[2:14:37] brother Tom, I trust him to just have
[2:14:40] that leadership of the Holy Spirit. And
[2:14:43] it has been it's been true. There's a
[2:14:45] thing. And God has a mind. Each one of
[2:14:48] you that are sitting here just want you
[2:14:49] to ponder that for a moment that God
[2:14:52] Almighty, creator of heavens and earth,
[2:14:55] to think of this little dot on the globe
[2:14:59] called the Earth, to think of this spot
[2:15:02] called Camp Horizon. And to think of the
[2:15:05] people that are going to be there and
[2:15:07] the labors that are going to be involved
[2:15:09] and the minister that will be
[2:15:11] ministering. And now I've got to bring
[2:15:13] my thought down and get them all into
[2:15:16] one mind. And as we come and and the
[2:15:19] meetings begin to unfold and and and we
[2:15:22] with our little uh minds that are so
[2:15:27] limited, we pick up little tidbits here
[2:15:29] and there and after a while we say God
[2:15:33] is a mind.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; What a what a revelation that is. Of
[2:15:38] course he has a mind.
[2:15:41] Why should we even have to say that? God
[2:15:43] had a mind long before we realized it.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Tom starts feeling we we
[2:15:53] will bring forth Joseph.
[2:15:56] We want the young people and the
[2:15:58] children. And I wish everybody would
[2:16:01] have seen it. And they made a
[2:16:03] presentation of Joseph. I'm sorry. I
[2:16:05] have to apologize to the sisters that
[2:16:09] so about five or more of them. And so
[2:16:12] they garments, original
[2:16:15] looking garments for for Pharaoh and
[2:16:18] Piper and their attendants and their
[2:16:20] guards and and for Joseph and the butler
[2:16:24] and the baker and all of them and all
[2:16:27] the all the painting and those that
[2:16:30] painted. I didn't have them stand. We
[2:16:32] appreciate that. But I asked brother Tom
[2:16:35] just on the platform, when did you first
[2:16:37] begin to think and that came to you
[2:16:40] about Joseph? About two weeks before So
[2:16:42] we begin July
[2:16:46] and I know how God dealt with us and
[2:16:48] myself last year and how we went right
[2:16:51] into the ritual ruler and brother Ron
[2:16:54] came and began to minister on that. So
[2:16:57] here they began to prepare for Joseph
[2:17:02] and then we have the two evenings.
[2:17:06] Then brother brother brother brother
[2:17:08] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:17:08] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:17:08] brother brother brother brother brother
[2:17:08] brother brother brother Ron can't get
[2:17:09] here on time so he doesn't get to see
[2:17:12] the presentation on Wednesday night.
[2:17:16] It was Tuesday, Wednesday, what Monday,
[2:17:18] Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday.
[2:17:21] Then he doesn't get here. And so, uh, he
[2:17:25] comes and speaks on Joseph.
[2:17:29] Not the next day, but the next day I had
[2:17:32] a meeting I had to
[2:17:34] go see a man on the Canadian side. And
[2:17:38] so, I thought, um, I might as well just
[2:17:41] I might as well play a tape and make use
[2:17:43] of this time. So, I'm driving. I reached
[2:17:46] in. I have a bunch of tapes in there and
[2:17:49] I just reached and grabbed the first box
[2:17:51] and shook it. It was empty and I looked
[2:17:54] at it said masterpiece. So I just put it
[2:17:57] back in and grabbed the next one and and
[2:18:00] it was masterpiece. So I looked at it
[2:18:03] says masterpiece the second second part.
[2:18:07] So I thought probably the first one's in
[2:18:10] the tape. It's already in the tape
[2:18:13] there. So I'll just punch it. tape on
[2:18:17] punch of tape on first words like
[2:18:21] Joseph.
[2:18:22] He was at the end of a sentence
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; and he had already said a sentence and
[2:18:27] his first words and his only words at
[2:18:28] that moment was like Joseph said and
[2:18:32] began then to go into details about
[2:18:36] Joseph.
[2:18:37] How he how he had to be smitten. Joseph
[2:18:40] had to be smitten so that he could be a
[2:18:44] perfect a perfect type of the perfect
[2:18:47] masterpiece who had to be smitten for us
[2:18:52] and we were because he was smitten. We
[2:18:55] came we came into being.
[2:18:59] We came to be and and and some days ago
[2:19:03] and I I have I have some notes already
[2:19:06] making some notes and those you that
[2:19:08] will be in church Lord willing on Sunday
[2:19:11] and I very very rarely ever ever
[2:19:14] announce what I'm going to preach on but
[2:19:16] I feel that I will be speaking on Joseph
[2:19:20] son of prosperity
[2:19:25] that's what he was and We are the
[2:19:28] product of his prosperity.
[2:19:32] When brother Brandon was here
[2:19:35] and was revealing the son of man, that's
[2:19:39] Joseph.
[2:19:41] The graineries were full. It was Joseph
[2:19:45] that opened up the graineries. Joseph
[2:19:48] had this had the plan and the program.
[2:19:51] And in the time of famine,
[2:19:54] the graineries were open. And the
[2:19:57] prophesies through the prophet in the
[2:20:00] last days
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; there will be a famine
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; not of Bibles it didn't say Bibles it
[2:20:07] didn't say a famine of the word said a
[2:20:10] famine of hearing the word
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; there were not ears to hear the word and
[2:20:16] there were not speakers there were
[2:20:18] speakers but there was not speakers
[2:20:21] speaking the word so there was a famine
[2:20:24] of hearing the
[2:20:26] both on the recipient side and on the
[2:20:28] pulpit side. A famine of hearing the
[2:20:32] word.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a a spoken tent
[2:20:35] like this. And there were thousands in
[2:20:38] tents, much larger tents in buildings
[2:20:42] and all around the world. And tens of
[2:20:46] thousands of thousands and thousands of
[2:20:50] people were healed. The supernatural.
[2:20:54] But that was the prosperity of Joseph.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; But finally the graineries were open
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; and the people were able to get get
[2:21:04] grain
[2:21:06] get seed
[2:21:08] and the prosperity of Joseph truly is
[2:21:13] the word that he finally delivered. But
[2:21:16] there was in the end time there was only
[2:21:18] a few
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; that really were there to hear it.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; And now friends here in this
[2:21:26] I thought it's enough for us to talk
[2:21:29] about what has been. But right amongst
[2:21:32] us are supernatural things that God has
[2:21:35] done.
[2:21:38] And many here know, but many, many don't
[2:21:41] know.
[2:21:44] Where's Benjamin? Is he here?
[2:21:50] Where is he? I want him to stand up.
[2:21:54] Take it back to the bedroom. You might
[2:21:55] as well come up here.
[2:21:59] We've got the
[2:22:03] We've got the X-rays of this boy's
[2:22:05] broken neck.
[2:22:07] Having jumped out of a treehouse onto a
[2:22:12] trampoline to get more air. He got lots
[2:22:14] of air and landed on his head
[2:22:17] off of the trampoline. Stand up here.
[2:22:21] Stand up for a moment. And we've got the
[2:22:24] X-rays where the break isn't done right
[2:22:27] within a few hours.
[2:22:29] And but that doesn't give anybody
[2:22:32] eternal life.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; But then people say, "Well, I want to
[2:22:35] see the supernatural." There's more
[2:22:37] miracles
[2:22:39] in this congregation than you folks know
[2:22:42] about.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Stand up.
[2:22:51] Maybe you might as well come stand here
[2:22:54] on this side.
[2:22:58] This girl's medical file is probably 2
[2:23:02] and 1 half to 3 in thick
[2:23:05] and she was having seizures so
[2:23:08] frequently and the best medical in the
[2:23:12] children's hospital
[2:23:14] best medical specialist telling her
[2:23:17] parents
[2:23:20] Brother Leon, Sister Brandon,
[2:23:25] and preparing their parents. This girl
[2:23:28] will be in a wheelchair. She'll be a
[2:23:30] vegetable. She can't live. She was
[2:23:33] having such severe
[2:23:36] uh convulsions. And her daddy said,
[2:23:39] "It's a devil."
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; And his wife agreed with him. It's a
[2:23:44] devil
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; and we're not going to accept it. But
[2:23:47] the convulsions kept coming kept coming
[2:23:50] worse and they put them in touch. You're
[2:23:52] going to need to be in touch as parents
[2:23:54] with a support group. And it's a very
[2:23:57] rare disease. She hasn't there aren't
[2:23:59] many of them, but we'll put you in touch
[2:24:01] with a support group. I'm not talking
[2:24:03] about history now. I'm talking about
[2:24:04] you're looking at something
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; and God heal her.
[2:24:14] It's not a real
[2:24:24] show that it's a spirit hero called down
[2:24:28] in a park,
[2:24:30] Redwood Park, and some mentally
[2:24:33] challenged people were there that have
[2:24:35] mental problems and a convulsion demon
[2:24:39] came on her
[2:24:41] and her mom called and we prayed and it
[2:24:44] left. And the second time her daddy
[2:24:47] along I believe with brother Eric was
[2:24:50] out hunting and it came on from the
[2:24:52] Okanagan and her mom called and it came
[2:24:55] on when both heads of homes were away
[2:24:58] and we rebuked that devil
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; and it left her to my knowledge up to
[2:25:04] last time.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; Is God alive?
[2:25:11] come down.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; How about Andre? Go chair.
[2:25:20] See here.
[2:25:24] Andre, come standing here. You can come
[2:25:26] up to the front. Anyway,
[2:25:29] both his mom and dad are here. He was
[2:25:31] only a few weeks old
[2:25:35] and he was rushed into Vancouver from
[2:25:38] the White Rock Hospital. rushed into
[2:25:40] Vancouver because he couldn't live
[2:25:44] and the hospital made a mistake and gave
[2:25:46] him two or three times an adult portion
[2:25:49] of medication as a small boy and got
[2:25:53] into unconscious state and rushed into
[2:25:55] Vancouver General Hospital
[2:25:58] and our whole office
[2:26:01] went into a a a convulsion of emotion
[2:26:05] and brother Mike Hunt went into prayer
[2:26:08] called the office
[2:26:10] One of our receptionist took the phone
[2:26:12] call. He said, "It's over. You can stop
[2:26:15] praying. It's finished. God healed him."
[2:26:22] And they said at the hospital, they
[2:26:25] said, "This boy will be a vegetable for
[2:26:28] the rest of his life cuz this this
[2:26:30] medication has destroyed his brain."
[2:26:34] I don't think that's true.
[2:26:45] Say, "What are you doing, brother?" I'm
[2:26:48] talking about Joseph, the son of
[2:26:50] prosperity.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; You can't buy those things with money,
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; and we haven't got time. I mentioned
[2:26:57] Brother Jim Douly the other day. Brother
[2:26:59] Jim Douly came and and was in our
[2:27:01] service and told me God spoke to him
[2:27:06] through for prophetic utterance
[2:27:09] and they couldn't have any more
[2:27:11] children. They have three and all three
[2:27:14] of them are here at this time.
[2:27:18] John
[2:27:20] and Suel and that's why he's named
[2:27:25] and
[2:27:26] three that have been with him. They
[2:27:28] should stand
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; and remain standing.
[2:27:41] You heard it last night. Brother Ron
[2:27:43] Spencer
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; falling 40 ft onto the concrete.
[2:27:48] Why don't you stand, brother Ron? We're
[2:27:50] going to give glory to God.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Where's Brother David?
[2:27:56] Brother David here.
[2:27:59] Brother David, why don't you stand
[2:28:02] down there?
[2:28:03] Listen friends,
[2:28:06] you read you read articles.
[2:28:09] I stood at his bedside while he while he
[2:28:13] was being eaten up with flesh eating
[2:28:15] disease,
[2:28:16] dreaded disease,
[2:28:19] called his children out of school, had
[2:28:22] them check to make sure they hadn't
[2:28:24] contacted him.
[2:28:27] And he was in a deep unconscious state.
[2:28:30] God said to me, "Tell him
[2:28:34] stand in the company of the saints and
[2:28:36] give glory to God."
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; And I didn't know how I was going to
[2:28:39] tell him. He was in a total unconscious
[2:28:41] state. And Sister Violet Law, his wife,
[2:28:43] is with him now. Had just walked out of
[2:28:46] the ICU. And I walked in. I said, "How
[2:28:48] is he?" Said, "He's the same." I walked
[2:28:50] in. His mom and dad had already
[2:28:53] gathered. They expect him to die at any
[2:28:54] moment. I walked in and he was in that
[2:28:58] unconscious state nurse sitting right at
[2:29:00] his feet. I said, "How is it?" She said,
[2:29:02] "We're just taking a day at a time while
[2:29:05] she looked at her chart and watching the
[2:29:07] monitors." I put my hands on the rail.
[2:29:10] As I put my hands on the rail, looked
[2:29:11] down at him, his eyes open,
[2:29:15] and he smiled and he said, "Hi, brother
[2:29:17] Ed." I said, "Brother David, God has
[2:29:20] sent me here with a message. You're
[2:29:22] going to stand in the company of the
[2:29:23] saints and give the the clock about 90
[2:29:27] days later.
[2:29:40] You may not know it, but brother Tom and
[2:29:42] Joanne Ray
[2:29:44] couldn't have children and they tried
[2:29:47] everything. And that's why the first one
[2:29:49] is called Samuel.
[2:29:51] Brother, brother Sydney Jackson from
[2:29:53] South Africa, good friend of Brighton
[2:29:55] Jones, visited our church. And when he
[2:29:59] left after the first visit, he sent me a
[2:30:02] letter. And in the letter was a little
[2:30:04] piece of cloth turned yellow with age.
[2:30:07] And he said, "Brother Eddie,
[2:30:11] your daughter, I don't remember her
[2:30:14] name. She was the last to get married.
[2:30:17] Your youngest daughter, the last to get
[2:30:18] married. She and her husband are
[2:30:22] desiring a child. He said, "I've
[2:30:25] included a cloth
[2:30:27] that Brother Brandham prayed over." When
[2:30:30] he visited our country in 1951,
[2:30:34] please give this to them and tell them
[2:30:37] to read Matthew
[2:30:39] uh I believe it was 12 and uh 244.
[2:30:42] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[2:30:44] pray, believe that you receive it and
[2:30:46] you shall have it. And I would go home
[2:30:49] to house and gave him the cloth. I said,
[2:30:51] "It's been sent to you by brother Cindy
[2:30:53] Jackson." And she called me back since I
[2:30:56] arrived home and said, "Who should wear
[2:30:58] this? I or brother Tom?" I said, "Well,
[2:31:01] you want to conceive, you wear it." And
[2:31:04] she said, "What?" And as I calculated it
[2:31:06] back, she conceived within a week.
[2:31:20] And the next one, Michael,
[2:31:23] wouldn't come. They both came to the
[2:31:25] front and like a wind came through my
[2:31:29] back arched back like that. And I cried
[2:31:32] out, "Let life come."
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; And I came.
[2:31:38] And about three and a half years later
[2:31:40] in India with my wife sitting on a chair
[2:31:43] in a corner at this little room in a
[2:31:45] poor Indian hotel. And I just knelt and
[2:31:48] threw my this Bible that I have here
[2:31:50] open. And just as I threw open a voice
[2:31:53] within me said, "You'll have another
[2:31:55] grandson. His name will be Joel."
[2:31:58] And that's that's all supernatural.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; I say, "Son of prosperity, I look down
[2:32:05] and see
[2:32:07] Brother Ron Spencer fell out of a tree
[2:32:09] 30 40 ft out of a building out of the
[2:32:13] concrete. There's brother JB. You ought
[2:32:15] to stand, brother James. Give glory to
[2:32:17] God. This this man fell out of the tree
[2:32:24] with his power chainsaw.
[2:32:27] Fell out of the tree with his power
[2:32:28] chainsaw and landed on a pile of rocks
[2:32:32] and broke up his bones.
[2:32:35] And they
[2:32:37] I can't tell you the rest.
[2:32:40] When I first saw him, I thought he'd
[2:32:42] never take another step. And here he is
[2:32:45] today doing what I say he shouldn't have
[2:32:48] been climbing trees again.
[2:32:52] Brother Cam Buck. Brother Ken, I looked
[2:32:54] for him, but I couldn't see him. He's
[2:32:56] probably flying. Brother Ken Buck. You
[2:32:59] say, "Well, you've mentioned them so
[2:33:00] many times." Brother Brandham talks
[2:33:02] about people that have been healed 30,
[2:33:04] 40 years before like they just been
[2:33:06] healed last week. But God's eternal
[2:33:10] and what he has done, he can do again.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can do it right now. There's
[2:33:14] people here who need miracles. But I
[2:33:16] want to just close with this in just a
[2:33:18] moment. Sister Eileen Waldner,
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; why don't you stand, Sister Eileen? When
[2:33:23] they first came here, she mustn't have
[2:33:25] any more children. She had big David.
[2:33:27] Where's Brother David?
[2:33:33] Stand up, David. Why don't you stand? We
[2:33:35] can never miss you.
[2:33:37] There he is with his children. Brother
[2:33:40] David's a product and she's not supposed
[2:33:42] to have any more children and has him.
[2:33:46] I say, "Praise God."
[2:33:57] We're just a man of snow.
[2:34:01] Stand up, Amanda.
[2:34:03] This girl had a leukemia.
[2:34:10] She didn't look like she was tonight or
[2:34:12] this morning.
[2:34:16] I say God delivered her from that.
[2:34:22] That's not long ago.
[2:34:26] I'm doing this
[2:34:28] to confirm the son of prosperity is
[2:34:32] here. But I have a very special purpose
[2:34:34] in doing this.
[2:34:37] Sister Beth Dingle, I don't think she's
[2:34:39] here. Sister Beth here? Her mom is here.
[2:34:43] Sister Beth, God bless you. to the best
[2:34:47] stand
[2:34:49] fought with this demon of leukemia
[2:34:52] for about eight years.
[2:34:56] This girl's file in the hospital in
[2:34:59] Edmonton is about about 12 in high.
[2:35:07] And if you haven't seen the video, the
[2:35:10] best story, you need to get it and keep
[2:35:14] it.
[2:35:16] And I've heard from all over the world.
[2:35:19] I want you to keep standing. Sister
[2:35:21] brother, sister Sister Schmaltz aren't
[2:35:22] here. They just had their family
[2:35:24] dedicated. Couldn't have any children of
[2:35:26] 13 years and they were prayed for.
[2:35:29] Brother Tom, brother Laz were there and
[2:35:31] prayed for and they have two children
[2:35:33] today.
[2:35:35] Oh, there are so many. Where's Matthew?
[2:35:38] Alex and boy. Where's Matthew? Matthew.
[2:35:42] Tell me stay here. Matthew, anybody that
[2:35:44] can't be seen, I want them to come. This
[2:35:47] boy was floating down a river,
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; upside down in a river. He was lost from
[2:35:55] his father and mother. Floated down a
[2:35:57] river, and all they could see was the
[2:35:59] whites of his feet, his two feet, and he
[2:36:02] was gone.
[2:36:05] And his father was trying to retrieve
[2:36:07] him.
[2:36:09] And they got him out of the water and he
[2:36:11] was lifeless.
[2:36:14] And brother Alex knew nothing about the
[2:36:16] message living way out in the
[2:36:18] wilderness. You always say living like
[2:36:20] the jungles, brother.
[2:36:22] And he screamed out to God to save his
[2:36:26] son.
[2:36:28] And his son came after him.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you.
[2:36:42] That's just a few
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; throughout this congregation
[2:36:50] is miracle after miracle after miracle.
[2:36:54] But the greatest miracle that took place
[2:36:57] is that you are here. Satan is defeated
[2:37:01] and you have been born again of the
[2:37:04] spirit and word of God.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. This is what I
[2:37:09] want to conclude with
[2:37:12] just like these that are here. There
[2:37:15] have been outstanding miracles by the
[2:37:17] tens of thousands in brother Graham's
[2:37:19] meetings. But that was not the fullness
[2:37:23] of the riches of Joseph.
[2:37:28] Joseph came to bring
[2:37:31] the seed back to the people,
[2:37:35] &gt;&gt; the word back. The greatest riches that
[2:37:40] we have had here in this camp is that
[2:37:44] we've had a man,
[2:37:47] we've had a a one one of God's servants
[2:37:51] been raised under the sound of a
[2:37:55] prophet's voice. to me, not to me only,
[2:37:58] but to you. The greatest riches, it's
[2:38:02] not that you that have been healed and
[2:38:04] have these miracles that have happened.
[2:38:06] And I I want the congregation to respond
[2:38:09] if you catch what I'm saying. The
[2:38:11] greatest riches is that the revelation
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; of the word of God.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; This is no longer a mystery. We're no
[2:38:19] longer tied by an umbilical cord to Rome
[2:38:23] or any denominational system or any
[2:38:26] trinity. That the cord's been cut.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; The greatest riches is that this word
[2:38:35] has been unveiled to us. We've heard the
[2:38:38] preaching of the word of God and
[2:38:40] transforming power has been carried by
[2:38:44] that word and lives have been
[2:38:47] transformed. from the last year to this
[2:38:49] year. And if you are here, you young
[2:38:52] people that are here and maybe you feel,
[2:38:54] "Well, I don't really feel." You don't
[2:38:55] have to feel a whole lot.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel anything.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is say, "I believe.
[2:39:03] It's been spoken. I receive it. I
[2:39:06] confess it. I will thank God for it."
[2:39:10] And and that transforming power takes
[2:39:12] place. Even I tell you that Benjamin the
[2:39:15] Curtney, he didn't have any special
[2:39:16] feeling when when One moment the bone
[2:39:19] was broken next when it wasn't. She
[2:39:21] doesn't know anything about where did
[2:39:23] those uh where did all those convulsions
[2:39:25] go? They don't know. They didn't have
[2:39:27] any big feeling about it. All they know
[2:39:29] is it happened.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; And I thought I had to conclude my
[2:39:34] comments with this camp. Something
[2:39:36] supernatural.
[2:39:38] Joseph, the son of prosperity, has been
[2:39:41] here with us
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; and he's been making known his riches,
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; his power,
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; his glory,
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; his promises to
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; been whispering to his friends,
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; been whispering his love secrets.
[2:39:58] &gt;&gt; All you that have stood and have
[2:39:59] received, I'm so thankful for your
[2:40:02] testimony. God bless each one of you.
[2:40:07] I wonder if we could say we'll give all
[2:40:10] the glory to Jesus
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; and tell his love. Would you sing it
[2:40:14] with me?
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; This is nobody. This is no glory to the
[2:40:19] way. This is no glory to any man.
[2:40:24] We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus
[2:40:26] Christ.
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; But it's a reality, friends.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, I feel I'm not getting it
[2:40:33] through to some of you.
[2:40:35] Jesus performed multitudes of miracles
[2:40:39] but they left him suddenly
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; when he began when he began to reveal
[2:40:44] himself. How many did he have? Just a
[2:40:46] handful.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Just a handful.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know that on one occasion we have
[2:40:53] about a thousand people here. Do you
[2:40:55] know that Jesus lost almost five times
[2:40:58] the number that's in this tent? 4,988
[2:41:03] left him.
[2:41:06] And when they left him and if you all
[2:41:08] left and I was left with just 12 people
[2:41:11] here, I can't I I'd have to be honest
[2:41:13] and say I would have a twins of
[2:41:15] disappointment.
[2:41:17] So what in the world what were they
[2:41:19] following? Well, maybe they were just
[2:41:21] following the miracle.
[2:41:23] Oh, I had a broken neck. Oh, I had
[2:41:26] compulsion. Oh, I had a heart attack or
[2:41:28] I had leukemia or I had something. Oh, I
[2:41:31] got healed. Where are you now? I don't
[2:41:34] know. I I can't take that. Starting to
[2:41:36] tell me how I got to dress. Telling me
[2:41:38] what I telling me how I got to live. I
[2:41:41] can't take that. Tell me he's God in the
[2:41:44] flesh. I can't handle that.
[2:41:47] And I would have a twinge of
[2:41:49] disappointment.
[2:41:52] But tonight, I look on you this morning
[2:41:54] rather
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; and I see you as God's handful that's
[2:41:59] been left.
[2:42:02] the group that's been left.
[2:42:05] And if God gives us another year,
[2:42:09] I personally
[2:42:11] will testify to you that I believe we'll
[2:42:14] be at a different level next year than
[2:42:16] we are this year.
[2:42:18] and whatever God has in store for you,
[2:42:22] I'm looking down on you and charging you
[2:42:24] to be victorious
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; and deny Satan
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; when he comes because he is a temptor
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; and he is an adversary
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; and he will work against you as our
[2:42:38] brother Ron Sper said this morning. But
[2:42:41] I personally charge you in the name of
[2:42:44] Jesus Christ. You are to be victorious.
[2:42:49] &gt;&gt; You are to be identified with the
[2:42:51] conqueror.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; Is that putting a little bit of fear?
[2:42:54] No, it doesn't put fear on you.
[2:42:57] As Moses said, who's on the Lord's side?
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Joshua, stand here.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you see what's
[2:43:07] already here, you say there's nothing.
[2:43:10] There's nothing that Satan can throw my
[2:43:12] way but what I'll be victorious over
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; and he has opened his word to us
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; and that's the greatest thing that that
[2:43:21] he can do. We'll give all the glory to
[2:43:23] Jesus. I don't understand
[2:43:35] his love his
[2:43:39] love
[2:43:43] glory to Jesus
[2:43:48] and
[2:43:49] his wonderful
[2:43:55] We give him the glory to Jesus
[2:44:02] and tell him
[2:44:06] his wonderful
[2:44:09] will
[2:44:13] to Jesus
[2:44:17] and tell his wonderful
[2:44:23] Oh, you give the glory to Jesus
[2:44:31] and tell you
[2:44:34] his wonderful love.
[2:44:38] You give all the glory to Jesus
[2:44:45] and tell his
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; Tell your saints you don't want to
[2:44:57] leave.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; All right, we have a message. Don't
[2:45:06] shoot the messenger.
[2:45:08] The young people have a song. So, the
[2:45:10] young people, you have time for a song.
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; All right, then. Why don't you have your
[2:45:15] seats?
[2:45:17] We're going to sing
[2:45:22] of this wonderful
[2:45:41] Heat. Heat.
[2:45:55] Heat. Heat.
[2:46:05] Heat. Heat.

[2:48:26] Lord, you heal the sick
[2:48:30] and you raise the dead.
[2:48:34] With two fish in my bread,
[2:48:38] 5,000 souls were fed.
[2:48:41] If you did it back then,
[2:48:45] I know you can do it again. Nobody but
[2:48:48] you, Lord.
[2:48:51] Nobody but you.

[2:49:31] isn't trouble anywhere
[2:49:34] you should never be discouraged.
[2:49:44] I know he will do it again.
[2:49:51] Nobody but you.
[2:49:55] &gt;&gt; Nobody but you, Lord.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody.

[2:51:11] Nobody like you, Lord.
[2:51:18] Nobody
[2:51:20] but
[2:51:24] you.
[2:51:35] Amenus
[2:51:37] Christ.
[2:51:40] Amen. For what he's done within our
[2:51:42] lives within this young people.
[2:51:48] and watching
[2:51:55] it and not doing it big difference.
[2:52:08] You have heard the purpose of God unfold
[2:52:10] in this camp. Stonewall Jackson
[2:52:14] great
[2:52:18] and he had a walk with
[2:52:22] he was the guy that was sort of the
[2:52:23] artillery guy with the
[2:52:26] he overrun by the Mexicans. They were
[2:52:29] coming against the uh the United States
[2:52:33] and everybody was on the run
[2:52:37] except Stonewall Jackson,
[2:52:40] right? Everybody's on the run except
[2:52:42] Stonewall Jackson and he's maning his
[2:52:46] cannon and he's loading him with balls
[2:52:48] and he's firing him and he's all by
[2:52:50] himself and everybody in his troop left
[2:52:53] and they were running over the hill and
[2:52:55] then one fellow looked back and he seen
[2:52:57] Stonewall Jackson
[2:53:00] the
[2:53:02] enemy.
[2:53:03] He says what is he doing?
[2:53:06] So he turns around and says, "Hey, if
[2:53:09] Stonewall can do it, I can do it." So
[2:53:13] then another one said, "Hey, if he can
[2:53:15] do it, I can do it."
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; So they all start running back, men
[2:53:20] cannons, and they defeated the enemy.
[2:53:25] All right? So they
[2:53:29] didn't run. You know what he had? A
[2:53:31] revelation of who he was. He said, "The
[2:53:34] enemy can't kill me. until God's
[2:53:37] finished with me.
[2:53:42] Find your purpose. Go on with God. He's
[2:53:45] the same God as we close. That same God
[2:53:50] that spoke to Moses. He's the same God.
[2:53:52] Where is he now? Living in me. It's not
[2:53:56] a history book anymore, but it's a
[2:53:58] living reality that God is living. Not
[2:54:01] in just Jackson, not in just William.
[2:54:10] You young people that are left here.
[2:54:13] I said we all
[2:54:16] praise the Lord. Let your light so shine
[2:54:19] in this dark generation. Let the reality
[2:54:24] of God manifest within your life. That
[2:54:27] same God is living in me.
[2:54:33] You know, people come to church, come,
[2:54:35] they want the blessing.
[2:54:37] Never come to church, but they come at
[2:54:39] special occasions.
[2:54:41] We want committed people. Committed
[2:54:44] young people know who they are. Stand
[2:54:47] for the right. Shut the wrong. Take the
[2:54:50] word and realize now it's God living in
[2:54:53] me. You heard a tremendous word this
[2:54:55] week.
[2:54:56] You take it now within your heart and
[2:54:59] make this a declaration if it's real to
[2:55:01] you. And I ask you, not the adults, you
[2:55:04] young people, that you would stand and
[2:55:07] sing this for the glory of God. I got a
[2:55:10] choir behind me that there be a choir in
[2:55:12] front of me. He's the same.
[2:55:22] The same God who wonders
[2:55:26] too many to tell.
[2:55:30] The same God is pardoning
[2:55:34] the raing
[2:55:36] sea.
[2:55:40] He's the same God who's living in the
[2:55:45] same
[2:55:48] God
[2:55:50] to the woman at the well.
[2:55:56] The same God who wonders
[2:56:00] too many to dare.
[2:56:03] The same God who pardoned
[2:56:07] the raid
[2:56:26] and the
[2:56:29] same God who wonders
[2:56:33] Too many to tell.
[2:56:37] The same God who pardons
[2:56:41] the raising red.
[2:56:46] He is the same God who's living in.
[2:56:54] Thank him for that. As we get ready,
[2:56:56] just thank him for that. Thank God that
[2:56:59] he's living in me.
[2:57:01] Thank God that the power of God's living
[2:57:03] in me. Thank God that that open word,
[2:57:07] that quickening power is living in me.

[2:58:22] as brother Risk brought it to the
[2:58:23] forefront, a God present. But you're not
[2:58:26] only a God that's present, you're a God
[2:58:28] that's living in me. Go with us now.
