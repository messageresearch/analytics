TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I might take another name and say my name is U some other name I might take my mother's name Harvey which would be the closest to me uh uh in the world my mother was a Harvey and then I might take the name of Harvey but still the blood would prove that I am a Bram see because I'm part of my father as long as I got blood in me I'll still be part of my father see that's right and when I'm born of the spirit of God I am a part of God that's all I am am identified with him he is my father then my life should reflect him as my life reflects my Earthly father in the image that he was in uh they say I look a whole lot like my father so then therefore it's his image reflected in me and your father reflected in you and your parents and so God our Father is reflected in us when we're born and and conform here to his image
