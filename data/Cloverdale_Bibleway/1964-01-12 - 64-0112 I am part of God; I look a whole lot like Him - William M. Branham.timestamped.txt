[0:00] I might take another name and say my
[0:01] name is U some other name I might take
[0:04] my mother's name Harvey which would be
[0:06] the closest to me uh uh in the world my
[0:09] mother was a Harvey and then I might
[0:11] take the name of Harvey but still the
[0:14] blood would prove that I am a Bram see
[0:17] because I'm part of my father as long as
[0:20] I got blood in me I'll still be part of
[0:22] my father see that's right and when I'm
[0:24] born of the spirit of God I am a part of
[0:28] God that's all I am am identified with
[0:31] him he is my father then my life should
[0:35] reflect him as my life reflects my
[0:38] Earthly father in the image that he was
[0:40] in uh they say I look a whole lot like
[0:42] my father so then therefore it's his
[0:45] image reflected in me and your father
[0:48] reflected in you and your parents and so
[0:50] God our Father is reflected in us when
[0:52] we're born and and conform here to his
[0:55] image
