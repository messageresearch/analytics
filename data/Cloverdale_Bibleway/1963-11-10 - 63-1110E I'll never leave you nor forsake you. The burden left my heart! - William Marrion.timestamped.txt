[0:51] until I come to the The church here to

[0:59] hear it they can pick up to the tape but
[1:00] I'll wait till I'm here and there is at
[1:04] least to this event that I'm going to
[1:06] tell you about just now there's several
[1:08] man here that's witness of these
[1:11] Christian Brothers one that was present
[1:14] was brother Banks wood another that was
[1:18] present was Brother David wood another
[1:20] that's present year was brother Evans
[1:23] and his son Ronald another was present
[1:26] is our notable Deacon brother wheer and
[1:31] another present was brother
[1:33] man is brother man here from New Alia a
[1:36] Methodist preacher that I baptized in
[1:39] the name of Jesus Christ just recently
[1:41] he was there also when this
[1:45] happened it's been for some time for a
[1:48] few years that I have had a deep burden
[1:53] on my chest that I in my heart it fell
[1:58] to me as if I had done something
[2:00] wrong and I searched my life over and
[2:03] over and over to see what was wrong Lord
[2:06] if if I've done anything wrong then you
[2:09] just reveal it to me what's wrong and
[2:11] I'll go and make it right but nothing
[2:14] would be revealed to me I say did I hurt
[2:17] somebody did I leave something undone
[2:20] have I do I read enough do I pray enough
[2:22] and I read and pray and and I I think
[2:25] reveal it to me did I harm somebody
[2:27] somewhere if I did I'll make it right
[2:30] just show me I don't want this burden
[2:32] and for the last 5 years since I come
[2:34] off the field there's been a burden
[2:36] hanging in my heart I've went to the
[2:38] mountain I've went to the seaside I've
[2:41] went everywhere and prayed and prayed
[2:43] and prayed and it just wouldn't let up
[2:46] and I thought of everything if I done
[2:49] anything but it still it wouldn't let up
[2:50] I was just in bondage on it's very
[2:53] strange that this would be lifted just
[2:55] at the time this message come forth
[2:58] other morning now wasn't God holding
[3:01] back for this I don't know see I these
[3:04] things is all in my mind you can imagine
[3:06] what's in a man's heart when you put up
[3:10] with that to think of what is taking
[3:14] place and know to tell the people KN
[3:16] that some will get the wrong slint and
[3:18] some will go this way and that way and
[3:20] you know how it is some will bleed and
[3:22] some won't but that's what you have to
[3:23] put up there how can you say it without
[3:25] hurting how can you say it that it'll
[3:27] take effect how can you say it to show
[3:29] the people that you're not not picking
[3:31] on man that you love them how can you be
[3:33] strict and firm and yet be loving and
[3:36] how you going to present War me if I
[3:38] don't present it see and there you are
[3:40] see it no wonder it keeps you
[3:44] N I had come down from from come up from
[3:49] Arizona to meet a bunch of bre here that
[3:51] go hunting with me up in Colorado each
[3:53] year now some people have wondered why
[3:57] do you go hunt what makes you go see
[4:00] here you are filling up I'm emptying out
[4:04] there I'm filling up so I can't empty
[4:06] out see now I don't go just to shoot
[4:10] game while people anyone here that goes
[4:13] with me knows that I pass b h that had a
[4:16] game and never even touch it I don't I
[4:20] hear out Longo I've begin to shoot game
[4:21] for the Christian businessman when go to
[4:23] say Billy get me a bull get me a cow get
[4:25] me elk get me this or that I'd go out
[4:28] and just shoot game from right and left
[4:32] the Lord helped me so I could see and
[4:34] find game and pretty fair shooting get
[4:38] them and and uh they just sit around
[4:40] talk about their business then the Lord
[4:42] told me not to do that no more and I I
[4:44] felt bad about it so I promised him I
[4:47] wouldn't do it no more you know I said
[4:49] if it's emergency and somebody needs it
[4:51] I'll do it but if they don't need it I
[4:52] won't do it just that man they got
[4:54] plenty of money to buy beef and stuff so
[4:56] why should I do that let the animal live
[4:58] if you're not really to use
[5:00] so I just go to be Al woman and any man
[5:03] that ever goes hunting with me knows I
[5:05] don't hunt with anybody I brought you
[5:07] myself to get along I go with them to

[10:02] but it hit him so high he jumped like he
[10:04] fell like that Billy was with me and he
[10:06] said I got him I thought of did to but
[10:08] when we went over there it wasn't so he
[10:10] said you hit a tree I look up now

[12:41] perishing they just have to wait there
[12:43] so everybody scat this as soon as they
[12:44] hear that broadcast a forecast rather so
[12:47] we were back there and I said now you
[12:49] make up your mind if you want to stay
[12:51] I'm here to hunt with you and I'll call
[12:53] my wife and tell her happy anniversary
[12:56] but I said then in that I will also so
[12:59] uh we will we will get some groceries

[13:24] and I got the groceries and I called the
[13:27] wife and the phone wouldn't answer I one
[13:29] answer so I waited about an hour till we
[13:31] got the grocery shop went back called
[13:34] she didn't answer I had to call Sister
[13:36] Evans I'll be sister Evans is here and I
[13:38] told yeah brother Evans sister Evans is

[13:47] anniversary of course you know so but
[13:49] she's gone shopping to get some
[13:51] groceries for the children and then we
[13:53] come back and the next morning what was
[13:56] in the skies but clouds it had rained up
[13:58] there all fall and it was really dry and
[14:01] it to prolong the hunting season a few
[14:03] days EX on count of the dry well I said
[14:06] to the brother that morning now the
[14:08] first zapper rain starts to fall the
[14:10] first snow the first sleep anything take
[14:12] for the camp just as hard as you can
[14:14] because in 15 minutes you can't see your
[14:16] hand before you see and it'll just twist
[14:18] and blow and I don't care how well you
[14:20] know the country you you're going to
[14:21] stay right there and you'll perish
[14:23] because sometimes you can't even breathe
[14:25] sleep blowing so you die right there I
[14:27] said as soon as it starts with that seat
[14:29] you take for the camp just as hard as
[14:31] you can I don't care where you are well
[14:33] I said go up here and set these gules
[14:35] and I'll climb way high and roll rocks
[14:37] over the hill and so forth to Ste the
[14:39] deers off the top and run them down you
[14:40] pick out what you want so I started
[14:42] climbing High by the time I got up the
[14:45] where we call the saddle a little place
[14:47] there that always cross over to go to a
[14:49] place called Quaker knob right on a
[14:51] continental divide there way high and
[14:53] when I got to almost this little saddle
[14:56] the clouds are getting blacker and
[14:58] Blacker wasn't it car left just us up
[15:00] there and the cowboy on stand so it got
[15:03] it got worse and worse so in a few
[15:05] minutes it started raining well I took
[15:07] my gun and put it under my coat keep the
[15:09] SC from smoking up and and stocked it in
[15:12] wet where running to bear or something
[15:14] coming back so I I help my scope like
[15:17] that and sat down under a tree a little
[15:18] bit I sat there and praying I said Lord
[15:21] God you're the great Jehovah I love you
[15:23] how many experiences if I had I pointed
[15:25] out to the brother brother Palmer the
[15:27] places where the eagle you know I see
[15:29] rise up that day you know how that's the
[15:30] place is we all taking place now it's a
[15:32] temperamental thing to me in there I've
[15:34] had so many great experiences with my
[15:36] Lord up in that mountain so you just
[15:39] can't go there without seeing he's just
[15:41] everywhere so then as I sat there then
[15:45] the Sleep started in the wind twisting
[15:47] like that and I said well I'd hold the
[15:49] way down but I better get off of here
[15:50] right now so I said it look down and I
[15:53] couldn't even see the bottoms no more
[15:54] then Cloud just whiring and twisting and
[15:56] feet of blowing and there it was the
[15:58] blizzard forecast for several days a big
[16:00] blizzard
[16:02] coming brother Tom is your brother Tom
[16:05] Simpson coming down from Canada heard
[16:07] the forecast and he was advised not to
[16:09] go through that part of the country
[16:10] because this forecast said it'll be
[16:12] blizzard where are you brother prom H
[16:14] think that yeah right there and um the
[16:16] blizard was coming everybody's done
[16:17] studying for well I put my gun back
[16:20] under my shirt like this my red shirt
[16:23] started walking down the mountain and as
[16:26] I started I got about a half a mile from
[16:27] the saddle and oh my those big drops of
[16:29] snow right that the wind twisting up on
[16:31] that mountain and blowing I couldn't see
[16:33] the bottom no more I see about 20 ft in
[16:35] front of me at 30 I know to come right
[16:37] down this little what we call Little hog
[16:38] back little Ridge and I come off to the
[16:40] creek then I know to follow the creek
[16:41] where to go to if it got real bad and so
[16:44] then I started down and got about
[16:45] halfway down there and something said to
[16:47] me just as plain as you hear me stop and
[16:50] go
[16:51] back I thought what was I thinking about
[16:54] maybe it's just my mind and I just
[16:56] couldn't make another step forward David
[16:59] had fixed me a sandwich that morning I
[17:02] think he tried to get eat with it for
[17:03] fixing his daddy one one time of onion
[17:06] and honey that's all we had so he fixed
[17:09] me a baloney and oh I don't know what
[17:11] all it was R in there I had it in my
[17:13] shirt it done got wet through my shirt I
[17:16] thought I'll just stop and eat this and
[17:17] maybe I'll you'll be all right now so I
[17:19] pulled out the sandwich about 10:00 and
[17:21] I started eating the sandwich and as I
[17:23] eat the sandwich I thought now I'll be
[17:26] all right and I started to move on but
[17:28] something said
[17:29] go back where you come from go back to
[17:33] that
[17:34] storm a half a mile or more back up the
[17:37] mountain into that dark Timber where you
[17:39] can then hardly see as far as that
[17:42] bargain but I'm getting to be an old man
[17:46] and I've been a Christian now for 33
[17:48] years and I know no matter what how
[17:51] ridiculous it seems mind the Lord he
[17:54] what the Lord said and I turned and went
[17:57] back to the sabath feeling my way back
[18:00] all sleep getting harder and harder
[18:03] getting darker and darker and I sit down
[18:06] there and just put my coat up like this
[18:09] and my shirt on the scope again that I
[18:11] thought what am I doing here why would I
[18:14] come back up here and I just waited a
[18:17] few minutes and I started to get up
[18:19] again and just as
[18:21] plain as I ever want to here a voice
[18:26] said I am the creator of heavens and
[18:30] earth I make the wind and the
[18:35] rain I took off my
[18:38] head I said great Jehovah is that
[18:43] you he said I was the one who made the
[18:47] winds to cease upon the sea I was the
[18:50] one who made the waves to go down I

[23:41] anniversary you know what I had made up
[23:43] my mind I said there's many people
[23:46] around the house and then I'm always you
[23:49] know I am nervous and everything I talk
[23:51] what talk about is God the vibe or
[23:53] something maybe she just thinks it's a
[23:55] little
[23:56] rest get me away from to go hunting I
[23:59] had thinking of that going WR I'm I I
[24:02] apologize to her and um I'm ask God to
[24:06] forgive me for that Stu because was
[24:08] going around I thought well she thinks
[24:10] well my goodness she she's a worker you
[24:12] know all the time when she's out in the
[24:14] kitchen somewhere out any of you knows
[24:16] there's that washing machine going all

[24:25] something tell me you do too she said
[24:28] you know I do then I don't
[24:30] wor I don't want you to do that I want
[24:32] you come sit down by oh bill I got so
[24:35] much work I thought well see going up
[24:37] here she gets time to do her work going
[24:39] on there thinking that now remember I
[24:41] laid this Bible up here so you see it on
[24:44] before the
[24:46] word as I was walking along something
[24:49] happened to
[24:50] me if I started first I think about when
[24:54] I taking her on the honeymoon up there
[24:56] she was a pretty little blackheaded
[24:59] Brown Eyed Girl I lip her over these
[25:01] logs you know and everything and trying
[25:03] to get her up there this place where I
[25:04] kill some bear I want to show her Bo got
[25:08] this be you see on my cowboy boots that
[25:11] that 22 years or 21 years before that 20
[25:15] 22 years I believe it was ago we were
[25:17] married on 1941 I picked her up and I
[25:21] thought now poor little fell putting up
[25:24] with me she's done turn great I thought
[25:27] well
[25:29] I went I had in shade for a few days and
[25:32] I found out I was great too and I seen
[25:35] my beard sticking out here great I
[25:37] thought oh boy you just about finished
[25:41] if you going do anything you hurry up
[25:43] you get old to and so as I went along
[25:47] like that something taking place all of
[25:49] a sudden in every motion principal I was
[25:54] a boy I thought as a boy I had my head
[25:57] down
[25:58] and I looked up and just as plain as I
[26:01] ever saw her there she stood before me
[26:03] with her arms
[26:04] up I
[26:07] stop rub my face I look I said V is that
[26:10] you

[26:36] burdened I've repented I've repented
[26:39] I've done everything I know and why is
[26:41] it this burden don't leave me and I just
