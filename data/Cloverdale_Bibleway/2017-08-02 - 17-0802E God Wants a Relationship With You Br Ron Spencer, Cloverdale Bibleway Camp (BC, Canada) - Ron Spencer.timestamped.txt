[3:45] My companion,
[3:48] my best friend, the only true God.
[3:51] There's no one greater, wonderful
[3:54] savior.

[4:01] Our God is tremendous. His strength
[4:04] never failth. He goes through the fire
[4:07] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is
[4:10] almighty and he sends his angels
[4:14] to guide me.
[4:18] No powerful our God cannot handle. Our
[4:22] God in simplicity revealed to you and
[4:25] me.
[4:30] Your greatest love story.
[4:34] All right. After the special, you guys
[4:36] want to sing the second verse? Yes. It's
[4:39] all right.
[5:06] Frozen
[5:09] song echoes in my soul.
[5:14] I hear the music
[5:18] ring.
[5:21] And though the storms make,
[5:25] I am holding
[5:27] on
[5:29] to the rock I claim.
[5:37] How can I keep from singing
[5:40] your praise?
[5:43] How can I ever say enough?
[5:47] How amazing is your love?
[5:52] How can I keep on shouting your name?
[5:58] I am loved by the king and it makes my
[6:04] heart want to sing.
[6:13] I will lift my eyes in the darkest
[6:19] night. For I know my Savior
[6:24] lives.
[6:27] And I will walk with you, knowing you'll
[6:32] see me through
[6:35] and sing the songs you give.
[6:43] How can I keep on singing
[6:46] your grace?
[6:49] How can I ever say enough?
[6:53] How amazing is your love?
[6:58] How can I keep from shouting
[7:01] your name?
[7:04] I know I am loved by the king and it
[7:09] makes my heart want to sing.
[7:15] I can sing in the troubled times. Sing
[7:21] when I win. I can sing when I lose my
[7:25] step and fall down again.
[7:30] I can sing cuz you pick me up. Sing cuz
[7:35] you're there. I can sing cuz you hear
[7:40] me, Lord. When I call to you and pray, I
[7:45] can sing with my last friend. Sing for I
[7:50] know that I'll sing with the angels and
[7:56] saints around the throne.
[8:01] How can I keep from singing your praise?
[8:08] How can I ever say enough?
[8:12] How amazing is your love?
[8:16] How can I keep from shouting your name?
[8:22] I know I am loved by the king and it
[8:27] makes my heart. I am loved by the king
[8:33] and it makes my heart. I am loved by the
[8:39] king and it makes my heart want to sing.
[9:00] Amen. Thank you girls. Sound beautiful.
[9:07] All right.
[9:14] So, we're going to finish singing Our
[9:15] God is tremendous. The second verse.
[9:19] Okay.
[9:21] Well, when you're in trouble, Jehovah,
[9:26] the great enforcer,
[9:28] God Almighty will fight your battles.
[9:33] Oh yes, he will stand for you.
[9:39] He don't come not the way you think he
[9:42] should, but my creatur
[9:45] just loves a paradox. Just stay in your
[9:48] position or watch a miraculous
[9:51] come into action.
[9:54] Oh, our God is tremendous. the strength
[9:58] of failing. He goes through the fire
[10:01] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is
[10:04] almighty and he sends his angels
[10:08] to guide me.
[10:11] There's no soul too powerful. Our God
[10:14] cannot handle our God in simplicity
[10:18] revealed in you and me. Came down from
[10:21] his glory and gave us the victory.
[10:25] Let's sing the chorus one more time. Oh,
[10:28] our God is tremendous. His strength
[10:31] never failth. He goes through the fire
[10:34] just to save a sinner. Yes, he is
[10:37] almighty and he sends his angels
[10:41] to guide me.
[10:44] There is no storm too powerful. Our God
[10:47] cannot handle. Our God in simplicity
[10:51] revealed in you and me came down from
[10:54] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[10:58] greatest love story.
[11:03] Let's sing faithful one as brother Kyle
[11:04] comes. Can we all stand?
[11:08] Oh faithful
[11:10] one so unchanging
[11:17] aes.
[11:20] You're my rock
[11:23] of peace.
[11:26] Lord
[11:27] of all I depend on you.
[11:35] I call out to you
[11:39] again and again.
[11:44] I call out to you
[11:48] again and again. You are my rock. Oh,
[11:52] you are my rock. If you just want to
[11:55] lift your hand, praise him tonight of
[11:58] trouble.
[12:00] Will you lift me up
[12:05] when I fall down?
[12:08] All through the storm,
[12:12] your love
[12:14] is the anchor.
[12:20] My hope is in you, faithful one.
[12:27] Oh
[12:29] faithful
[12:31] one, so unchangeing,
[12:37] ageless
[12:39] one. You're my rock
[12:43] of peace.
[12:45] You are Lord
[12:47] of all. I depend on you.
[12:54] I call out to you
[12:59] again and again.
[13:03] I call out to you.
[13:07] again and again.
[13:10] Oh,
[13:12] my rock
[13:14] in time
[13:16] of trouble.
[13:19] You lift me up.
[13:23] When I walk there
[13:27] all through the storm,
[13:30] your love
[13:33] is
[13:34] the anger.
[13:38] My hope is in you alone. You are my
[13:44] rock. One more time.
[13:46] You are my rock.
[13:49] In times
[13:51] of trouble.
[13:54] You lift me up
[13:58] when I fall down
[14:01] all through the storm.
[14:05] Your love
[14:07] is
[14:09] the anchor.
[14:13] My hope is in you alone.
[14:19] Amen. And praise the Lord. Everybody's
[14:21] doing good. I know it's hot and some are
[14:23] tired, but still good to be here tonight
[14:25] to have one more service uh together.
[14:27] I'm happy to be here with you. And
[14:29] tonight's not a skit. Uh I was
[14:31] ministering or a preacher in the skit
[14:33] last night, but tonight is not a skit.
[14:34] It's a regular preaching service and uh
[14:36] we're just humbled to be asked to speak
[14:38] to you again. You know, I've been very
[14:40] nervous uh about the service and so
[14:42] forth. you know, I just imagine I just
[14:44] think of all the effort that goes into
[14:46] camp and the kitchen and the skits, the
[14:48] audio video and the counselors and so
[14:50] forth. And uh my part um is much
[14:53] smaller, but somehow it's uh it's very
[14:56] important. So, it's a lot of pressure,
[14:57] but the Lord is good. So, I'm happy for
[15:00] the opportunity uh to be able to speak
[15:02] to you. You know, I came across this
[15:03] quote last week and uh it means
[15:05] something to me. It's just from an old
[15:07] saint in the 1800s. I think it says if
[15:09] God sends us to do anything for him, we
[15:12] have power whether we know it or not.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; If God sends us to do anything for him,
[15:18] we have power whether we know it or not.
[15:20] Praise the Lord.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; So, we're here tonight just believing
[15:23] the Lord will give us power and uh bless
[15:26] our hearts one more time.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um you know, I was thinking of
[15:32] doing a a oneman skit tonight. I was
[15:35] thinking of doing a skit on Jonah and
[15:36] the gourd being up here with a gourd and
[15:39] so forth. And I just love that story.
[15:40] You know, God prepared the gourd and God
[15:43] prepared the worm. And just to show how
[15:45] God looks after everything. Amen. But uh
[15:48] we didn't decide to go down that route.
[15:50] Decided to go down a different route. So
[15:51] maybe you can just turn your Bibles with
[15:53] me to again the book of Ephesians
[15:55] chapter 6. Same spot brother Ricard was
[15:58] in this morning. Just a few verses
[15:59] above.
[16:07] And we're looking forward to after
[16:08] service, too. I think we're going to
[16:09] have some snacks.
[16:11] So, that'll be nice to build a
[16:13] fellowship, have some snacks together
[16:14] afterwards.
[16:20] And I'm going to be focusing mainly on
[16:22] the campers, but um we're going to do
[16:24] some ricochet preaching, too. Uh when
[16:26] Brother Brennan preached, come follow
[16:27] me, that was for grads, but obviously
[16:29] the message was for more than just
[16:31] grads. So, I'm going to focus on them,
[16:33] but we're going to ricochet towards
[16:34] everybody. Okay? So, uh don't just leave
[16:37] me hanging just up here. It's for
[16:39] everybody. Amen. The word is for
[16:41] everybody. So, Ephesians chapter 6,
[16:44] we'll read verse one,
[16:47] 2, 3.
[16:49] The first verse is every child's
[16:51] favorite verse in the Bible.
[16:54] Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
[16:56] for this is right. Glory. Honor thy
[17:00] father and mother, which is the first
[17:01] commandment, with promise, that it may
[17:04] be well with thee, and thou mayest live
[17:06] long on the earth. I want to read verse
[17:08] two and three again. We'll skip your
[17:09] favorite verse. Honor thy father and
[17:11] mother, which is the first commandment
[17:12] with promise, that it may be well with
[17:14] thee, and thou mayest live long on the
[17:17] earth. Let's just have a word of prayer.
[17:21] Precious Lord Jesus, we're just
[17:23] so grateful for you in our lives. So
[17:26] happy to be here with these young people
[17:28] just watching them walk around and
[17:30] they're so beautiful just in the young
[17:33] stage of their life, Lord. But just the
[17:34] potential of how much you could use
[17:37] them, Lord, if they would just give
[17:39] their heart to you, Lord. I know
[17:40] everything's in your time and in your
[17:41] will, Lord Jesus, but if you can just
[17:43] coup and brood over some of these lives
[17:45] once more tonight, and there's many here
[17:47] that have given their heart to you. So I
[17:49] just pray you'd give them insight, Lord
[17:51] Jesus. Once we've been transformed,
[17:53] Lord, we grow and we grow and we grow.
[17:55] So we Lord, we're just committing again
[17:57] this evening into your hands. And we
[17:59] know it's hot, Lord, and we're tired and
[18:01] so forth. And maybe some might not be
[18:02] able to last a few minutes, but Lord, if
[18:04] it's for one soul, we're just going to
[18:05] preach until it's time to close. I don't
[18:08] have a clock or a watch on me, but I
[18:09] want to be short, Lord. But the main
[18:11] thing is we just want to touch someone's
[18:12] heart. So may strengthen everyone. Bless
[18:15] the counselors, the workers, the kitchen
[18:17] staff, Lord Jesus, in a way that only
[18:19] you can, Lord. You can say kind words,
[18:20] but oh Jesus, when you come and make all
[18:23] the difference, Lord, you're a debtor to
[18:26] no man. Lord, you're beyond fair. You're
[18:29] so wonderful and precious. So we love
[18:31] you. Commit this evening to you, Lord.
[18:33] And prepare our hearts to even
[18:34] transition for senior camp coming up and
[18:36] different things, but here we are
[18:38] tonight. Open up the word to our hearts
[18:40] in Jesus name. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[18:43] You may have your seats.
[18:47] So, as you can see on the little
[18:48] PowerPoint there, I don't have many
[18:49] slides, but uh I do have a few. But
[18:52] that's my title tonight. God wants a
[18:54] relationship with you. Yes, you. Amen.
[18:58] So, you can all read that and it's
[19:01] talking about you. I'm not preaching at,
[19:02] you know, I'm not focusing on Sister Joy
[19:04] necessarily, but God wants relationship
[19:06] with Sister Joy, but God wants
[19:07] relationship with Sister Kieran. Amen.
[19:10] God wants relationship with all of us.
[19:12] Praise the Lord. So, I might be speaking
[19:14] a little bit about a little bit
[19:15] something over here and I might speak
[19:17] about a little bit of a different topic
[19:18] over here. But the main thing I want to
[19:20] try and get across tonight is God wants
[19:22] a relationship with you.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, you.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, if we even can just allow
[19:26] that to start working on our hearts even
[19:28] now, Brother Ben. Amen. God wants a
[19:30] relationship with us. And so, uh, we'll
[19:32] go down many different directions
[19:34] probably, but God wants a relationship
[19:37] with us. That's the main thing of
[19:38] Christianity. Amen.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; God wants a relationship with us. It's a
[19:42] It's a father and his children
[19:44] relationship. God with his sons, God
[19:46] with his daughters. He wants a
[19:47] relationship. You know, I've been a I
[19:50] only have I'm not a counselor at camp,
[19:52] but I I have a I have a one uh camper
[19:54] with me, and that's my son. Amen. I've
[19:56] been I've been in a cabin with my son,
[19:57] and I've just been kind of doing over
[19:59] him like I haven't before, you know, up
[20:00] the hill, making sure he doesn't get
[20:02] hurt and so forth. And I've just I just
[20:04] loved having this father-son little time
[20:06] together. I love my son. And it just
[20:09] makes me think about God, how much more
[20:10] you love me. Every little detail, every
[20:13] little look and everything they do to a
[20:15] father, their son, it's just so special.
[20:17] And God loves us so much. And so we want
[20:19] to enter into that relationship with
[20:21] them. We can enjoy the sport court. We
[20:23] appreciate the new sport court, right?
[20:24] The basketballs and so forth. And do you
[20:27] notice the hoops are named Goliath?
[20:29] That's pretty neat. They're about
[20:31] They're about his height also. We We
[20:33] enjoy that. But we want a relationship
[20:35] with God.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. We enjoy creek time. who enjoyed
[20:37] jumping off the rock into the water.
[20:39] Hallelujah. That was wonderful. I'm just
[20:41] amazed nobody fell off that rock and got
[20:43] hurt. Eight or nine young boys up on
[20:46] there. It's slippery. It's wet. It's
[20:48] dangerous. But nobody got hurt. Praise
[20:50] the Lord. Minor scratches. There was
[20:52] minor scratches, I'm sure. But it's good
[20:54] to be in the creek, but Lord, he wants a
[20:57] relationship with us. Amen. And you're
[21:00] not too young to have a relationship
[21:01] with him. Anybody else here? Did they
[21:04] ever give their heart to the Lord before
[21:05] they were 10 years old? Anybody want to
[21:08] stand up? Just wave your hands. Before
[21:10] 10 years old. Counselors, anybody look
[21:12] at this. Turn around. Look at this.
[21:14] These are people who God got a hold of
[21:16] their lives before they were 10 years
[21:17] old. Thank you very much.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God can do it. They're not too
[21:21] young to have a relationship with him.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes we think, you know,
[21:25] when I'm brother Kyle's age or something
[21:27] like that, then I'm going to serve the
[21:28] Lord. But God wants a relationship with
[21:30] you now.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight,
[21:34] uh there's a quote brother Ed often
[21:37] refers to of Brother Brham in Christ the
[21:40] mystery of God revealed. Speaking of the
[21:42] the three-fold mystery of God. Amen. I
[21:44] know everyone under 10 years old loves
[21:45] to hear about the three-fold mystery of
[21:47] God. But he says in one spot, but what
[21:49] he wanted to do, he loved fatherhood for
[21:52] he was a father. Amen. He lo God loves
[21:55] fatherhood. And brother Ed often refers
[21:57] to that quote. He loves fatherhood.
[22:00] Amen. He loves being a father. But then
[22:02] I turned it back. I was I was in the
[22:03] woods up there in the woods by myself
[22:05] just praying and so forth. And I was
[22:07] thinking, "But do we love sunship?"
[22:09] Amen. God loves fatherhood, Brother
[22:11] Victor. But do we love sunship? Amen. Do
[22:14] we love Do we love daughterhood? Do we
[22:15] love being his child? Amen. He loves
[22:17] fatherhood. Like I I'm just so enjoying
[22:20] being with my son. I love fatherhood.
[22:22] But it's kind of impossible for him to
[22:23] really understand how much my heart is
[22:26] beating for him. But in the Christian
[22:28] walk, I believe God gives a bit more
[22:29] grace where we can somehow understand
[22:31] the love of God for us. Amen. May the
[22:34] God increase our desire to love sonhood,
[22:38] to love to be a son of God. Amen.
[22:40] There's many different things we can
[22:42] love to do in this world. We can love
[22:44] ice cream and maybe we'll have some
[22:46] later and we get really excited about
[22:47] ice cream. Who wouldn't in this weather?
[22:50] Amen. But do we love being sons and of
[22:53] God? Do we love being daughters of God?
[22:56] And you know, God wants to bring us to
[22:58] that place. And I just began to think a
[23:00] little bit. And I know some of you uh
[23:02] maybe you've given your heart to the
[23:03] Lord already, but let's just dramatize
[23:05] for a little bit about how God started
[23:07] his family in the New Testament church.
[23:09] Okay? Remember Jesus died on the cross
[23:12] and then the Jewish people thought that
[23:14] he was gone. He was forgotten. They
[23:16] could go on with life as normal, right?
[23:18] They they had crucified Jesus. They were
[23:20] hoping that all his followers would just
[23:22] fade away. and they were gathering
[23:24] around Jerusalem for the uh uh the feast
[23:27] of Pentecost. But there was a group of
[23:29] people that were in the upper room
[23:31] praying and fasting and waiting upon the
[23:32] Lord. And all a sudden the Holy Ghost
[23:34] came down upon them. Amen. God was
[23:36] quickening them, giving them the gift of
[23:37] the Holy Ghost and they burst out of
[23:39] there and they were speaking in tongues
[23:41] as it were. And all the people were
[23:43] amazed. How are we able all of us to
[23:46] hear in our own language? Aren't these
[23:49] all Galileans? So God was birthing his
[23:52] church. Amen. And then Peter stood up
[23:54] and he began to preach the word of God
[23:56] and it pricricked the hearts of the
[23:58] people. I just began to ponder a little
[24:00] bit. The first message that came forth
[24:02] from a son of God that was born again
[24:04] pricricked hearts. And God often has to
[24:08] prick our heart to draw us unto himself.
[24:10] Amen. It's good to be baptized in water.
[24:12] It's good to repent and so forth. But a
[24:14] lot a lot of times we won't be as
[24:16] successful down the road if God didn't
[24:18] really prick our hearts. Amen. If God
[24:20] didn't a sharp that's sorrow say Lord I
[24:24] want to serve you Lord I don't want to
[24:26] just be baptized to check right so then
[24:30] everybody in church they know that hey
[24:32] he's been baptized oh yeah that's good
[24:33] and so forth no we don't want to get
[24:35] baptized just for a check but there
[24:37] there's something that actually drives
[24:38] you towards the water if God is dealing
[24:39] with you at camp and you're thinking
[24:41] about baptism it should be something
[24:42] inside of you driving you amen something
[24:44] on your heart something in your mind I
[24:46] need to get right with God amen he's
[24:49] he's he's wooing ing you towards have a
[24:50] relationship with him. And it often
[24:52] starts with a prick, something that's a
[24:54] bit painful, something that's a bit
[24:55] agitating upon your heart. And it's not
[24:58] bad. Amen. You you might be lying in bed
[25:00] and waking just thinking about God and
[25:02] him getting you're think maybe you're
[25:04] you keep seeing the scene of Noah, those
[25:06] who are banging on the walls and those
[25:07] who are in the ark in peace and in
[25:10] safety. And maybe you're seeing that
[25:11] over and over again in your mind and
[25:13] you're a little bit tormented. That's
[25:14] not bad. God's drawing you unto himself.
[25:17] Amen. I remember when God began to get a
[25:19] hold of me. I was 19, 20, 21. And uh
[25:23] some of it was actually terrifying.
[25:26] When I realized God was real, when I
[25:28] realized the Bible was real and I
[25:30] realized I was a sinner, it was scary.
[25:32] But he opened up his gra. He used that
[25:34] to drive me to himself to bring me into
[25:36] a relationship with him. Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, the the mysterious prick of God
[25:42] because he wants us to come into
[25:43] relationship. He wants to save us. Amen.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to save us. And some of
[25:49] you have experienced that the saving
[25:51] power of God. There's nothing like God's
[25:54] saving power. It's the greatest gift he
[25:55] can give you is the gift of salvation.
[25:59] And I just want to mention this here
[26:00] before we go on a little bit about how
[26:03] God, what is he saving us from?
[26:07] Right? To be saved. Saved from what? You
[26:11] need to be saved. You need to be saved.
[26:13] And you need to be saved. It's like,
[26:14] okay, yeah, I need to be saved. But
[26:16] saved from what? Amen. Cuz if we know
[26:19] what we're being saved from, then we can
[26:22] have a whole lot more restful life, a
[26:24] peaceful life, joyful life with God. If
[26:26] we can really fully know how deep his
[26:28] saving power goes. Amen. As I was
[26:31] speaking to our brother last night, he
[26:32] was he was just saying, you know, I want
[26:33] God to forgive me for the bad things
[26:35] that I I have done. And I said to him,
[26:37] you know, don't look at your works. Look
[26:40] at what he did for you. Amen. God wants
[26:43] to save you from guilt and condemnation.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to save you from maybe
[26:49] some of you are thinking to yourself,
[26:50] "No, Lord, I've done this and I've lied
[26:52] and I've stolen and I've I've done bad
[26:54] things and so forth." God wants to save
[26:56] you from that guilt. God wants to save
[26:58] you from that condemnation. Amen. He
[27:01] purchased that at Calvary. He purchased
[27:04] you to be saved from guilt, to be saved
[27:06] from condemnation. Amen. He purchased
[27:08] that at Calvary. Amen. So, you're saved
[27:12] from guilt, saved from condemnation.
[27:15] He's also saving you from the habits of
[27:17] sin. To keep falling into, as brother
[27:20] Noah was praying, don't let us backslide
[27:22] after camp.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to save us from the
[27:24] habits of sin. To keep doing the wrong
[27:27] things over and over and over again, to
[27:30] keep lying, and to keep being
[27:32] disobedient to our parents. God wants to
[27:35] save us from that. Amen. And so we need
[27:38] to say, "Lord, you purchased me to be
[27:41] free from these habits. I can't do it by
[27:44] myself. We can't do it by ourselves, but
[27:46] he purchased it." Amen. And so by his
[27:48] spirit, he can help us. So we need to
[27:50] realize more when we're praying and when
[27:52] we're thinking about God and so forth,
[27:54] he purchased these things for us. Say,
[27:56] "Lord, you purchased for me to be free
[27:59] of guilt and con condemnation at
[28:01] Calvary." All right? or you're gonna
[28:03] keep trying to do it in your own mind to
[28:06] try you try and free yourself from guilt
[28:09] and try and free yourself. Oh Lord, I'm
[28:11] sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Right? We
[28:14] want to live beyond I'm sorry. I'm
[28:15] sorry. I'm sorry. Right? Lord, you
[28:18] purchased at Calvary for me to be free
[28:20] from this. Amen. We don't want to try
[28:22] and live the Christian life by
[28:23] ourselves. Amen. God spoke to me at camp
[28:26] and then we go off and try and live it
[28:27] by ourselves. Amen. And of course, God
[28:30] wants to save us from hell. he purchased
[28:32] out of Calvary. Praise the Lord.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; I want to go to heaven.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm not getting there by my
[28:38] own works.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get there because I'm a
[28:41] good boy. I'm not going to get there
[28:42] because I stand behind a pulpit. I'm
[28:44] going to get there because he purchased
[28:45] it for me at Calvary.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And gave me the gift of the Holy
[28:49] Spirit.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Which draws me into a relationship with
[28:51] him. And I love to be a son of God. So,
[28:54] I just wanted to touch on that cuz God
[28:56] wants to save you. But from what? If you
[28:59] know what he saved you from, you can
[29:00] claim that in prayer. Amen. You can
[29:03] claim that in your own life when you're
[29:04] all by yourself. Amen. God, you're you
[29:08] promised to save me from this. Amen.
[29:11] Cuz God's desire is to have relationship
[29:14] with us. Amen. And he purchased that,
[29:17] brother Dave, at Calvary. Hallelujah.
[29:19] Then gave us the gift of the Holy
[29:20] Spirit. God's ultimate desire is to have
[29:23] a relationship with us, men and women.
[29:28] Some of you are sitting here right here
[29:29] this evening that the ones like Tommy
[29:31] and different ones. God wants to have a
[29:32] relationship with you. Is that
[29:34] tremendous? And all of you he has a plan
[29:37] for. And every age group, God is
[29:40] releasing you upon the earth to win
[29:42] certain victories.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; That's a deep thought. I was just
[29:45] sitting in the back and uh my wife knows
[29:47] I I think about the 1983 babies.
[29:51] Hallelujah. There's a few here tonight.
[29:52] myself, Brother Ryan Hayes, Sister
[29:55] Abigail Ray, Sister Gina Ivaneno is an
[29:58] 83 baby. Anybody else? Praise the Lord.
[30:00] Sister Diana.
[30:02] Amen. So in 1983, God's like, I need to
[30:05] release these sons and daughters of God
[30:07] because I need to win a certain kind of
[30:09] victory in 2017. So I need to release
[30:12] these lives. Amen. And so God needed in
[30:15] what year were you born?
[30:17] &gt;&gt; 2005.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; 2005. Whoa. So in 2005, God had
[30:21] something in his mind. Amen. 2005.
[30:24] Praise the Lord. So God has something in
[30:27] his mind when he's releasing your age
[30:29] group upon the earth to win victories.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; So it's tremendous when you're in a camp
[30:33] together, you look around. It's like,
[30:34] "Hey, these are my brothers. These are
[30:37] my sisters." God, that was a tremendous
[30:40] song you sisters sang tonight.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I was just sitting in the back
[30:43] there and thinking, Lord, this is so
[30:44] good. I'm so blessed by this. God's
[30:45] winning victories through your age
[30:47] group. Amen. Because God's ultimate
[30:49] desire is not just to have fellowship
[30:51] with himself. Cuz God dwelt alone at one
[30:54] time. And I have no idea what that was
[30:55] like when God dwelt alone. Amen. That's
[30:59] a wonderful mystery. We'll figure out
[31:00] maybe a little bit. By and by when God
[31:03] dwelt alone.
[31:05] Amen. Then he created angels, but his
[31:08] ultimate purpose was not to have
[31:09] fellowship just with angels.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; And then he made the heavens and the
[31:13] earth. And it was beautiful.
[31:16] All the birds were flying around. All
[31:18] the trees. I mean, who loves trees? Oh,
[31:21] praise the Lord. Who loves
[31:22] huckleberries? Who's been eating
[31:23] huckleberries this week? Oh, praise the
[31:24] Lord. Those are so good. Amen. But God's
[31:26] ultimate desire is not just to have
[31:28] fellowship with nature. Amen. That does
[31:31] not satisfy the heart of God. He wants
[31:34] fellowship with sons and daughters of
[31:37] God. And I'm going to change gear for a
[31:39] minute here after I have some water. You
[31:42] wouldn't like this.
[31:45] It's not very good.
[31:48] But I just began to think and uh
[31:50] sometimes I don't know why I think
[31:52] certain ways,
[31:54] but I began to think maybe to my next
[31:56] slide, brother Darren. I began to think
[31:58] about uh what God wants to have a
[32:01] relationship with. And I began to think
[32:02] of, you know, brother Tom, did you have
[32:04] one of these when you were young?
[32:07] There was a man in the 70s where he
[32:08] decided that he he had a good idea. He
[32:11] was going to come up with this little
[32:13] pet that people could have and it was a
[32:14] rock and it came in a little box with
[32:16] straw in there and the rock was sitting
[32:18] in this little box and the box had
[32:20] little air holes cut cut in it so the
[32:22] rock could breathe. And this this guy
[32:25] sold millions of these and they were
[32:26] called my pet rock. It was probably in
[32:28] the 1970s but Ron probably had one. I
[32:30] don't know. Amen. But you know he
[32:33] thought people are having such bad
[32:34] experience with pets. I'm gonna sell
[32:37] this pet rock. And it came with like a
[32:39] 40page booklet on how to care for your
[32:41] rock. Brilliant.
[32:44] Amen. I got one here actually. It's not
[32:47] an an original, but there's my rock.
[32:50] Praise the Lord.
[32:53] But people are having bad relationships
[32:55] with pets. Who's ever had a bad
[32:57] relationship with a pet? Amen. I
[32:59] remember when I was in college, I bought
[33:00] a hamster. Who likes hamsters?
[33:04] But I was in college and I, you know, I
[33:05] was a really weird college guy and I
[33:07] wasn't taking great care of my hamster
[33:08] and I would just like keep it in the
[33:10] closet and close the door and the one
[33:12] day I went to go feed it and stuff and
[33:13] it bit my finger and I thought that's me
[33:15] and the hamster are going to part ways
[33:17] and so I sold them at a garage sale for
[33:18] $5.
[33:21] I thought it'd be such a good idea to
[33:22] have a hamster. Amen. But I didn't have
[33:24] a good relationship with a hamster. And
[33:25] I I had a dog one day uh named Petey and
[33:28] Petey was not a good dog. He'd be I
[33:30] think he you know he had real mental
[33:32] problems and
[33:34] he'd be fine a good pet and then all a
[33:37] sudden he would switch and all a sudden
[33:38] you you were on a one-on-one battle with
[33:40] your dog.
[33:41] So he didn't have a good relationship
[33:42] with my dog Pey. Amen. So this guy began
[33:46] to think you know people have had bad
[33:48] relationships with uh animals. So I'm
[33:51] going to make a pet rock. So next slide
[33:52] if you don't mind. I like this. If when
[33:56] you remove the rock from its box, it
[33:57] appears to be excited, place it on some
[34:00] old newspapers, the rock will know what
[34:02] the paper is for, and it will require no
[34:05] further instruction. It will remain on
[34:07] the paper until you remove it. A place
[34:10] of its own. Amen. These things were sold
[34:13] thousands, millions of these things.
[34:14] Amen. Pet rock. Next slide, if you don't
[34:16] mind. Your rock is an individual.
[34:19] These are just a few things uh in the in
[34:22] the manual that are really inspiring.
[34:24] Uh next one if you don't mind because
[34:26] you got to got to train your rock to
[34:28] listen and to obey. Right? So this is
[34:30] how uh to learn about simple obedience.
[34:32] It is essential that your pet rock learn
[34:34] this command. A rock that doesn't come
[34:37] when it's called will cause its owner
[34:38] endless embarrassment. You must command
[34:41] your rock gently but firmly. And so this
[34:45] booklet has a few other instructions of
[34:46] how to grow with your rock. Next slide
[34:49] if you don't mind. In closing, as the
[34:53] owner of a pet rock, you have assumed a
[34:55] responsibility to love and care for this
[34:57] new addition to your family. If your
[34:58] rock should misbehave, be patient. If it
[35:01] should cause you problems, be forgiving.
[35:03] Under no circumstances should you turn
[35:05] your pet rock loose. The world is
[35:07] already overcrowded with discarded and
[35:09] unwanted rocks, and millions must be
[35:11] destroyed each year. These poor,
[35:13] unfortunate rocks meet brutal ends in
[35:15] roadeds, cement mixers, or as landfill.
[35:18] Don't allow your pet rock to meet an
[35:20] untimely demise at the bottom of an
[35:22] obscure pile of rubble. Remember, if you
[35:24] take care of your pet rock, your pet
[35:26] rock will take care of you,
[35:31] right? But these things sold thousands.
[35:33] These things sold millions for about a
[35:36] month or so, right? Then people realized
[35:38] it's a rock.
[35:41] You can't have a relationship with it.
[35:44] The book is hilarious. I mean, I wish I
[35:46] could print off a copy for all of you
[35:47] and we could just sit here and read them
[35:48] together and have a nap, but you can't
[35:52] have a relationship with it. There's
[35:54] nothing. There's absolutely zero
[35:57] two-ways about this. Is that right,
[35:59] brother David? I can look at it. I can
[36:02] talk to it, but there's no response back
[36:04] from it. So, this guy sold thousands. He
[36:07] sold millions of these things, but then
[36:08] it just completely disappeared because
[36:10] people were so discouraged because it
[36:12] does nothing. It's a rock. Who likes
[36:15] rocks?
[36:17] A few of you. Praise the Lord.
[36:20] But you can't have a relationship with
[36:22] it,
[36:23] right? I can't talk to it. It can't feel
[36:26] my feelings.
[36:28] We can't hug and embrace the way you can
[36:30] with a human and so forth. And so God
[36:32] right now at this camp, he's not looking
[36:34] for a relationship with rocks.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're here at camp and so forth.
[36:39] God's not brooding over the camp looking
[36:40] for a rock. Amen. He's not brooding over
[36:43] the camp looking for anything but you.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's looking for human hearts.
[36:49] That's what he's looking for. He's not
[36:51] looking just for rocks. He wants someone
[36:53] he can have a two-way relationship with.
[36:55] Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; This rock is completely It's not even a
[36:59] one-way relationship. There's zero here.
[37:01] God wants a two-way relationship. You
[37:03] remember the victor? The victor likes
[37:04] rocks a lot.
[37:07] So this this camp, let's just remember
[37:10] God wants a relationship with you,
[37:12] Sister Lily. Amen. God wants
[37:14] relationship with you, Sister Tamara.
[37:16] Amen. God wants a relationship with us
[37:20] so bad. Amen. I don't know if there's
[37:23] anything in your heart that wants a
[37:25] relationship with him also. I hope
[37:27] there's a little something beating at
[37:29] least a little a little pulsation, a
[37:31] little a little tinkle at least. Then
[37:34] you can work with that. Amen. I hope we
[37:37] don't get so busy with life and just
[37:39] having so much fun. Remember the boy at
[37:41] the soda shop thing last night? They got
[37:43] so into dancing, so into music, so into
[37:46] sports, so into all these kind of
[37:48] things, they neglected that little voice
[37:50] on the inside of their heart. Amen. God
[37:52] gave that to you to help draw you
[37:54] towards him, brother Camden. Amen. God
[37:58] wants a relationship with us. Remember
[38:01] the disciples came to Jesus and said,
[38:03] "Jesus, master, teach us to pray." And
[38:05] it starts off, "Our father who are in
[38:08] heaven." Amen. Our father. Let's say
[38:11] that together. Our father
[38:14] &gt;&gt; who are in heaven.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your father, brother Zephaniah.
[38:19] Your father. Brother Peter is your
[38:21] earthly dad. The Lord Jesus is your
[38:23] heavenly father. Amen. And the more we
[38:26] can, sometimes you just need to talk
[38:27] that more. Let it come out of your mouth
[38:29] more and it'll become more and more
[38:30] real. Amen. The power, we're waiting for
[38:32] the power of the spoken word, right? To
[38:34] speak things into existence. Speak your
[38:36] Christian life into existence. Amen.
[38:39] Speak your Christian character into
[38:41] existence. Hallelujah. That's deeper
[38:43] than it sounds. So, we have parents by a
[38:45] natural birth, but he's our heavenly
[38:47] father by a spiritual birth. And again,
[38:50] we can receive that spiritual birth
[38:52] because of Calvary. Amen. because he
[38:55] purchased that for us by his blood. I
[38:58] love that because as I spoke a couple
[38:59] weeks ago in Victoria, I know some of
[39:01] you were there. If he had not died at
[39:03] Calvary, what kind of grace and mercy
[39:05] could we receive? We'd have to be
[39:07] connected with Israel.
[39:10] We're Gentiles. We're non-Jews. So, if
[39:12] he not died, not died at Calvary and the
[39:14] promise of God was released upon the
[39:15] whole earth, what grace would we
[39:17] receive? We'd have to be connected with
[39:19] Israel or possibly possibly possibly
[39:22] receive some kind of heathen ignorance
[39:24] grace. Amen. But because of him dying on
[39:27] Calvary, we can begin to enter into a
[39:29] relationship with him. Oh, I love that.
[39:33] Had that blood, that rib not come out of
[39:36] Adam's side, there would have been no
[39:38] Eve. There would have been no woman to
[39:39] come towards him. Had not Jesus Christ
[39:41] shed his blood, there'd be no church.
[39:45] Zero.
[39:46] Amen. So Lord, let us not forget what
[39:50] you did for us at Calvary.
[39:53] And so I'm just going to turn it a
[39:55] different direction for a few minutes
[39:57] and we're not going to be much longer
[39:58] cuz I know it's hot. Does everybody
[40:01] doing okay?
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're doing pretty good. Praise
[40:03] the Lord.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Who loves Greek?
[40:07] Hallelujah. We all love the Greek
[40:09] language, don't we? But uh I'm just
[40:11] going to read that one scripture to you
[40:13] again. You don't have to turn to it.
[40:16] Ephesians 6:2 says, "Honor thy father
[40:20] and mother," which is the first
[40:22] commandment with promise. Okay, that's
[40:25] the second verse we read. Honor thy
[40:27] father and mother. I was just studying
[40:29] this for myself and I became very
[40:30] blessed just thinking about honor thy
[40:33] father and mother. This is the first
[40:34] commandment with promise. Amen. There's
[40:36] something special that God attaches to
[40:39] this commandment
[40:41] that it may be well with thee. Who wants
[40:43] it to be well with you?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Anybody?
[40:47] And thou mayest live long on the earth.
[40:49] So, honoring thy father and mother will
[40:52] help it be well with you.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Honoring your father and mother will
[40:58] help it be well with you.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; And everybody here who has a belly
[41:02] button has a father and mother. Amen.
[41:06] From right here to the back, everybody
[41:08] in this room except for my rock has a
[41:11] belly button.
[41:12] So everybody,
[41:14] this service is for everybody here
[41:16] except this rock here. No offense. Amen.
[41:18] But honor thy father and mother that it
[41:21] might be well with thee. So if we don't
[41:24] honor our father and mother, we can
[41:25] just, you know, transfix the verse. It
[41:27] won't be well with you.
[41:30] Yikes. Hey, but if we honor them, it'll
[41:33] be well with us and our our days will be
[41:35] prolonged. So the Greek word, I know we
[41:37] all love the Greek language. Praise the
[41:39] Lord. I'm sure all every child in their
[41:41] bedroom has a Strong's concordance right
[41:43] there. Right. It's from the Greek word
[41:45] tommo. To prize,
[41:49] to fix evaluation upon, by implication
[41:53] to revere, to honor, to value. Amen.
[41:56] Honor your father and mother.
[41:58] Hallelujah. We're just going to show
[42:00] another one more slide if you don't
[42:01] mind. Sorry. Next slide. And then one
[42:05] more.
[42:06] I'm sure if we were all to walk outside
[42:08] and we saw this nice Tesla Model X
[42:12] sitting outside. I'm just, you know, who
[42:15] likes electric cars?
[42:17] You know, you can't even hear them
[42:19] coming. It's dangerous. But I I think
[42:20] they're pretty neat. So, if we went
[42:23] outside and this was parked right
[42:25] outside there, Brother Ben, I'm sure
[42:26] we'd all probably walk around it. Whoa,
[42:29] an electric car. Cuz we'd have high
[42:32] value upon the car. So we'd be looking
[42:35] at all over. Wow, look at the how the
[42:37] doors go like that. Wow, it's a car. So
[42:41] we would place such high value upon
[42:43] this, right? Is that true? But I just
[42:46] want to give another example. Okay,
[42:47] brother Jason, do you mind coming up
[42:49] here for me?
[42:51] Brother Jason is one of my favorite
[42:52] counselors of all time.
[42:56] He's he's the super counselor to me.
[42:58] Whenever I think, man, it's so hard, you
[43:00] know, they're so busy. He's like, oh, I
[43:01] love it. It's fun. and he's jumping off
[43:03] the big rock with the kids and
[43:04] everything like that. You know, to me,
[43:06] he's a tremendous counselor, but he's
[43:08] also a dad. So, I think he is. Do you
[43:11] have two or three kids here right now?
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Uh, just two.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Two right now.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Right now. Okay. Camden Logan, do you
[43:16] want to come up, too?
[43:18] Okay. Now, this is your dad, right? Do
[43:21] you ever just walk around him like,
[43:22] "Wow,
[43:25] you're my dad."
[43:27] Do you? Just like you would walk around
[43:30] this car and be like, "Look at all the
[43:32] features in it." Be like, "Wow, you you
[43:35] have a heart.
[43:38] He can smile."
[43:40] Right? To honor him. Do you guys ever do
[43:41] this at home? Now, when he comes home
[43:43] from work, it's like, "Oh, hallelujah,
[43:45] Dad. Look at him. He's so amazing."
[43:51] Because if you honor him, if you place a
[43:54] high value on him, the Bible says it'll
[43:56] be well with you. Amen.
[43:59] So, thank you. Thank you very much. You
[44:00] did very good. I I hope all the children
[44:03] will go home and just ooh and awe of
[44:06] their parents. Amen. Just look them up
[44:09] from top to bottom. All the features and
[44:11] everything. They're your parents. Amen.
[44:15] It'll be well with you if you honor your
[44:17] father and mother. And if you don't
[44:20] honor them, it won't be well with you.
[44:23] Just things won't go as smoothly in your
[44:26] life as they should. And brother Kyle
[44:28] doesn't have Christian parents. I try
[44:30] and honor them the best I can. I have,
[44:33] you know, you have certain complexes and
[44:35] scars based upon, you know, divorce and
[44:37] all this kind of stuff, but I try to
[44:38] honor them because I do love them. I do
[44:41] appreciate them. Amen. But when all a
[44:43] sudden you have kids of your own and you
[44:45] realize how much effort you pour into
[44:47] your children, then it makes you love
[44:49] your parents so much more. Amen. And so
[44:52] I try and honor my parents the best that
[44:54] I can to appreciate. It's a bit awkward.
[44:57] You know, it's it hasn't got to the the
[45:00] the pinnacle of where I'd like it to
[45:02] get, but they love me. They love my
[45:04] children. They love my wife. And, you
[45:06] know, even though they're not
[45:08] Christians, I still honor them. And God
[45:11] honors that. I've I've seen God work
[45:12] through my dad, playing the role of the
[45:15] father through my dad, though he's not a
[45:17] believer. Still God using him when I
[45:19] needed like God was using him as the
[45:21] father role, if you know what I mean.
[45:23] God was using him though he's not a
[45:24] believer. But it's good for us to honor
[45:27] our father and mother. Anybody agree?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're just going to go on
[45:33] this for a few minutes and then we're
[45:34] going to close because if you can
[45:37] capture this principle, it'll make a big
[45:40] difference in your life because God
[45:41] wants a relationship with you. And if
[45:44] you can learn to sister Milana, Sister
[45:46] Charity, everybody here, if we can learn
[45:49] to have a relationship with our parents,
[45:51] it'll affect our relationship with God.
[45:54] Because the way God is reflecting
[45:57] something through our mom and dad about
[45:59] him.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as you look at a tree and you
[46:03] can learn things about God by looking at
[46:05] that tree, you can learn things about
[46:06] him by your parents. So if we can get a
[46:10] hold of this principle, it's going to
[46:11] help you a lot in life. Amen. It's going
[46:14] to help the spirit of God move in our
[46:15] church more freely also. Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; So I'm just going to go through it for a
[46:19] few minutes. I know some of you you're
[46:22] you're just you're doing great.
[46:24] Hallelujah.
[46:27] I just began to think too of brother
[46:28] Brandham also. You know, his dad, he
[46:31] wasn't the best dad. He was a drunkard.
[46:34] He was involved in crime. He was
[46:36] involved in all these different kinds of
[46:38] things. He abandoned the family for a
[46:39] while when he's young. But you won't
[46:41] find brother Brandham speaking badly
[46:43] about his dad. You won't find brother
[46:45] Brandham throwing mud upon his dad's
[46:47] life. He'll be honest about what his dad
[46:49] was into. But you can see the heart of
[46:51] brother Brandham. I wanted to be like
[46:53] him. My dad had such big muscles. My dad
[46:56] had such nice hair. My dad was the the
[46:58] best horse rider there was keeping honor
[47:01] upon his dad, right? Cuz he's a prophet.
[47:04] He was so molded by God. And he he
[47:06] mentions brother Brandham, if you type
[47:07] in my dad in the message search, you can
[47:10] find different things brother Renham
[47:11] says about his dad. And I believe we
[47:14] could we should have that kind of
[47:15] character also. Amen. spending time in
[47:19] the word and spending time letting his
[47:21] word, his spirit cultivate our hearts
[47:23] also
[47:24] &gt;&gt; because we so appreciate God using
[47:26] brother Brandham, but God wants to use
[47:27] you.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; God wants to use me. Amen. God want
[47:31] wants to use you in the back over there.
[47:33] Amen. So, let's just go through a few
[47:35] principles of if we can learn about
[47:38] honoring our father and mother, it'll
[47:40] help us in our relationship with God.
[47:42] And brother John mentioned some of these
[47:43] things this morning about just the
[47:45] simple thing of saying, "I love you,
[47:48] Mom. I love you, Dad. Hallelujah." Who
[47:51] likes to tell their mom, "I love you."
[47:54] Who likes to tell their dad, "I love
[47:56] you, Dad." That's great. Almost every
[47:58] hand up. I love that.
[48:01] That's wonderful.
[48:04] Parents, are you happy about that?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Do you like it when your kids say, "I
[48:07] love you?"
[48:09] I just think it's so sweet. Who would
[48:11] have thought I would have kids but Tom?
[48:13] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know what? I'll have
[48:15] my son or my daughter come up to me and
[48:17] they say, "I love you."
[48:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll be like, "Oh, that's so sweet.
[48:21] What do you want?" You know, but then
[48:24] and then they say nothing. That's the
[48:26] best. That's the best. You know, it's
[48:28] nice when they want something, too. But
[48:30] if we can just learn, I know some of us
[48:32] maybe we haven't been raised the most
[48:33] mushy gushy and it can be a bit awkward
[48:35] and maybe our parents are are are a bit
[48:37] different, but still it's so good good
[48:39] to learn to say I love you dad. I love
[48:42] you mom. Even with my mom, it's still a
[48:43] bit awkward. We're on the phone and it's
[48:45] like I love you mom, you know, as as the
[48:47] phone as the phone's coming away from
[48:48] your hand, you know, cuz it's just it's
[48:50] so mushy and I wasn't raised kind of a
[48:53] mushy person and so forth.
[48:55] You know, if we can learn to verbalize
[48:58] and express love to our parents, we can
[49:01] learn to verbalize and express love
[49:03] towards our heavenly father.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; He loves it. Amen. When we express it
[49:08] towards him, Lord, I love you.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate you.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; It's not even that I want anything.
[49:15] Amen. I might have a sore back. I might
[49:18] be this or that, but I'm I'm just
[49:19] telling you I love you. You know about
[49:22] my my back's fine. I'm not it's just
[49:23] just an example, you know, it's oh man,
[49:25] no, my back's fine. But God just
[49:27] expressed love to him and he just so
[49:29] appreciates that. Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I wonder what it was like when Adam and
[49:34] Eve or Adam and woman and God came down
[49:37] in the cool of the evening. What kind of
[49:39] heartbeat it was towards each other
[49:40] before the fall. The atmosphere of love.
[49:44] Amen. Oh my, it'll be so much greater
[49:48] having gone through what we've gone
[49:49] through. The kind of love we can express
[49:51] to him. But we can start now expressing
[49:53] our love to our Lord Jesus. Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; And it takes practice.
[49:59] Amen. It takes time to to learn learn
[50:02] these things and to do them and so
[50:04] forth. But if we can learn to express
[50:05] our love towards God, it'll make such a
[50:08] difference in our lives. You know who
[50:09] who here keeps a journal?
[50:13] Hands way up because you're my heroes.
[50:16] Way up. Way up. Hallelujah.
[50:20] I love I love you.
[50:23] I'm you know I I love journals. I
[50:25] brought some of my old journals here.
[50:27] Amen. Just because this is a little side
[50:29] topic. I apologize. You know what does
[50:31] this have to do with last night at camp,
[50:33] brother Kyle? You know you're crazy.
[50:37] Praise the Lord. Here's just some of my
[50:38] old journals. You know, David was a man
[50:41] after God's own heart and he wrote a
[50:43] lot. Amen. Sister, you have a journal,
[50:45] too. That's wonderful. David wrote a lot
[50:48] of his love for God on paper. And his
[50:50] son Solomon did, too. You know, it's a
[50:53] form of prayer, expressing things on
[50:56] paper. It'll help you in your prayer
[50:58] life. Amen. Brother Brandham said he had
[51:00] a tablet. Did you know that Brother
[51:02] Brandham had a tablet?
[51:04] If you type in tablet in the message,
[51:06] you'll find him talking about his tablet
[51:09] because brother Brandham was so cutting
[51:10] edge.
[51:13] No, it was a tablet of paper, but he had
[51:15] one. Amen. I've seen his notes before,
[51:18] but it's good if we can I thought about
[51:20] sometimes by Tom doing a a guest lecture
[51:22] at BCA on journaling. Then you can look
[51:24] back and you can just see the different
[51:26] things that God spoke to you and so
[51:27] forth. I think it's this one I was
[51:29] flipping through. This is from 2012.
[51:31] And I wrote in here with a star beside
[51:34] it, something needs to trigger an
[51:37] awareness in our lives that God is aware
[51:40] of our thoughts and actions.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something needs to trigger an an
[51:44] awareness in our lives that God is aware
[51:46] of our thoughts and our actions.
[51:49] Hallelujah. Beyond believing to knowing
[51:52] beyond quotes and scriptures. I just
[51:54] wrote that there. But you know, it'll
[51:55] help you in your your walk with God if
[51:58] you get a tablet. Amen. And write some
[52:00] things. Just sketch sometimes. Amen.
[52:02] Just have it with you at church. Like
[52:03] you have paper and so forth right now. I
[52:05] I would like to see a revival of
[52:07] journals at church. Amen.
[52:09] More paper at church to write notes.
[52:12] something strikes you, just one
[52:13] sentence, one word, and you write it
[52:15] down. And you put a little note beside
[52:17] that. Search that when you go home
[52:19] because all of you in your bedroom,
[52:20] remember, you have a strong concordance
[52:22] there for we love Greek. We love Hebrew.
[52:26] Amen. And so, it's good to have one of
[52:28] these. I I think Amen. I I believe that
[52:33] it'll help you in your walk with God if
[52:35] you can just start to get Brother John
[52:36] used to always hand these out. I have
[52:38] about 10 or 15 of these. John is full of
[52:41] sketches. Who remembers getting these a
[52:43] youth meeting? Praise the Lord. I hope
[52:47] you don't mind that as a little side
[52:48] topic, but you know, this will help you
[52:51] in your walk with God more than an iPad.
[52:53] Amen. More than a Samsung Galaxy tablet.
[52:56] All, you know, swiping and we're
[52:58] inundated with too much technology. It's
[53:00] just good to get back to the old pen and
[53:02] paper. Amen. The oldfashioned ways.
[53:05] Jeremiah says, "Remember the old paths."
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. the old ways.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Let's not forget the old paths and the
[53:11] old ways. Amen. Prayer, fasting. Amen.
[53:15] Expressing our love to God. Just a few
[53:17] more minutes. I apologize.
[53:21] But it's so good to have a little
[53:22] journal.
[53:24] I've been wanting to say that for a long
[53:26] time. Glory.
[53:29] Journals. Journals. Journals. Journal.
[53:35] Greek. Greek. Greek. Hebrew. Hebrew.
[53:37] Hebrew. Greek. Greek. Just kidding. Just
[53:39] kidding.
[53:41] I'm not I'm not promoting theologians or
[53:42] nothing like that, but a love for the
[53:44] word of God. Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Just to dive in there sometimes and to
[53:48] realize what God has for you. And it
[53:50] doesn't take a whole lot of time
[53:51] anymore. Amen. Just read one verse and
[53:54] just dig in. Lord, make this real to my
[53:57] heart. Oh my. He'll make it real.
[54:01] You can read Psalms 119 and just see how
[54:03] much David loved the word and how much
[54:05] he loved the statutes and the laws and
[54:07] all the things to do with God and said,
[54:09] "God, don't let David just be a man
[54:11] after God's own heart. And me to like
[54:13] David, but not to be a man after your
[54:15] own heart." Amen. Make me a man after
[54:17] your own. Make me a woman after your own
[54:19] heart also, Lord Jesus. Amen. Just a
[54:21] couple more and we're going to wrap up
[54:22] quick here. So, relationship with our
[54:25] parents. Remember we were talking about
[54:26] that eight minutes ago, saying I love
[54:29] you. Also, please and thank you. Amen.
[54:33] Have you ever heard those words before?
[54:35] Please and thank you. You say, "Brother
[54:38] Kyle, this is like Emily Post, you know,
[54:39] English manners." It's not. It's good to
[54:42] be able to express these things to our
[54:44] parents. Please, Mom. Amen. Thank you
[54:48] for taking me to camp. Thank you for
[54:51] paying my way to camp. I don't know if
[54:52] Sister Ryan made cupcakes again to come
[54:54] to summer camp, but most of us our
[54:57] parents probably paid our way to camp.
[54:59] It'd be good to tell them, "Thank you,
[55:00] Mom. Thank you, Dad, for laboring for
[55:03] me." Remember the parable? There's this
[55:05] mystery in the Bible of the Samaritans
[55:07] that Jesus keeps we weaving through and
[55:09] one part there's 10 lepers that he heals
[55:12] and nine of them go away and one comes
[55:14] back and he's a Samaritan. And Jesus
[55:17] says, "Was there not 10? Why is only one
[55:19] coming back and he's a Samaritan?
[55:21] There's just a mystery there about the
[55:23] Samaritans, the woman at the well and
[55:25] the the the parable of the good
[55:26] Samaritan and so forth. And it's a it's
[55:29] a different topic just kind of, you
[55:30] know, in there in my mind somewhere in
[55:33] my journal. Hallelujah. But the one man
[55:35] came back and said, "Thank you and
[55:37] worship the Lord." And Jesus appreciated
[55:40] that and it's recorded in the scripture
[55:43] as a reminder when he does something for
[55:45] you, come back and say thank you.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Who's ever had it before? Maybe I'll
[55:52] towards the old ones where you know God
[55:53] does something for you and you know like
[55:55] right away give thanks. Amen. He does
[55:58] something for you. He saves you. He
[56:00] provides for you. He does something
[56:01] outside of yourself and you know right
[56:03] away time to worship. Hallelujah.
[56:05] Special times. Oh my. And some if you
[56:08] forget to give thanks. But Tim sometimes
[56:09] it feels bad because the Lord the Lord's
[56:12] kind of you know he's kind of grieved
[56:14] because he did something for you and you
[56:16] didn't thank him. Amen. So, if we can
[56:18] learn to express our thanks towards our
[56:20] parents, it's we're going to I was
[56:23] almost going to give all of you a card
[56:24] for when you walk out of here like
[56:25] remember when you go home, tell your
[56:27] parents you love them, say thank you,
[56:30] give them a hug, but I'll just rely upon
[56:33] God God bringing these words to your
[56:35] remembrance in your heart to go do these
[56:36] things cuz it'll make such a difference
[56:38] in your home. Amen. It'll make such a
[56:40] difference in our church where when
[56:42] every car pulls up for the the church,
[56:44] there's there's a family in a car that's
[56:46] in love with each other. Oh, and they
[56:49] have a passion maybe to sit together in
[56:51] church cuz they love each other so much.
[56:53] Like the Wong family. Amen. Always
[56:55] together. Always together in church. I'm
[56:57] not saying we have to sit together in
[56:58] church, but a passion for families to
[57:00] love each other. Amen. For brothers and
[57:03] sisters to love each other. Amen. I I I
[57:07] think like some of you, you have
[57:08] brothers and sisters here. go to church
[57:10] together. I think of Charity and Jessica
[57:12] here. They're like best friends. That's
[57:13] a good example of a message, sister. Uh
[57:16] in our church, they're like best
[57:18] friends. And why not? Amen. We'll get
[57:21] into that in another note there in a
[57:23] minute here. But to express our
[57:25] thankfulness to our parents. Amen. Bless
[57:29] you, brother Philip. And then we'll
[57:30] learn to express our thankfulness to
[57:32] God.
[57:34] So these things, if we can learn them in
[57:37] earthly ways, it'll help cultivate us in
[57:40] spiritual ways. Amen. Just about five
[57:43] more minutes. We're going to wrap up
[57:45] here. And brother John mentioned this
[57:47] one this morning, too. Just learning to
[57:50] say sorry.
[57:51] It's hard to apologize sometimes towards
[57:54] our parents or towards one another. If
[57:56] we can learn to apologize
[57:58] and not when we do something wrong, when
[58:01] we say something wrong, don't be
[58:03] thinking of the punishment. Just be
[58:05] thinking of making it right. A lot of
[58:08] times we'll avoid saying sorry because
[58:11] we're imagining the punishment.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it's better just to make it
[58:16] right. Like when brother John threw his
[58:18] gun over the fence and broke it.
[58:20] Remember for years he held that in his
[58:22] heart and held that in his mind. And I
[58:24] don't think his dad gave him a huge
[58:25] like, you know, just tore him to pieces
[58:28] or this and that. I think he said like,
[58:29] "Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Right?
[58:32] You had to carry that in your mind, in
[58:34] your heart for years, right? So when we
[58:37] do something wrong, don't just be
[58:39] thinking in terms of punishments like,
[58:40] "Lord, I made wrong. Let me go say
[58:43] sorry." God likes quick repentance.
[58:45] David, a man after God's own heart, he
[58:48] was a good repentter.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's completely against human
[58:52] nature to say sorry. We want to hide. We
[58:55] want to run and hide like Adam did in
[58:57] the Garden of Eden when we did things
[58:58] wrong. But if we can learn to apologize
[59:00] and just say sorry, it'll help our walk
[59:04] with God so much. Lord, forgive me. I
[59:08] said that wrong. I did that wrong. Would
[59:10] you forgive me, Lord Jesus? Amen.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; A lot of people get derailed in their
[59:15] Christian life because they lack the
[59:16] ability to say sorry to God. Amen.
[59:19] rather than just making it right,
[59:21] they'll just they'll justify their
[59:23] actions and they'll drift away from God.
[59:25] And when you talk to them, the genesis
[59:27] of their drifting away was something
[59:28] simple they did wrong and would not make
[59:30] right. Often I've talked to people and
[59:33] it their story you you think them
[59:36] leaving church and going into the world
[59:37] is going to be some really like dramat
[59:39] but it started with something so simple.
[59:42] Amen. If they would have just said
[59:43] sorry, I'm wrong. Would you forgive me?
[59:46] Amen.
[59:47] Oh my.
[59:50] I could say more on that for a minute,
[59:51] but
[59:53] let me just ponder that for a minute.
[1:00:00] Amen.
[1:00:02] Part of it is too, let me just touch on
[1:00:04] it for a minute. This we're still going
[1:00:05] to be done in five minutes here. But
[1:00:07] when God touches your life, when God
[1:00:09] gives you the Holy Spirit, sometimes we
[1:00:11] think the rest of our life should life
[1:00:13] should be perfect and flawless. Yeah,
[1:00:15] God touched my life and I'll never make
[1:00:17] a mistake again because now I know. But
[1:00:19] we're going to make mistakes. We're
[1:00:21] going to fall. We're going to do things
[1:00:22] wrong
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; because we're still human. When God
[1:00:25] gives you, I mentioned this in Victoria,
[1:00:27] too, but I just love it. When God gives
[1:00:29] you the gift of the Holy Spirit, that's
[1:00:30] the down payment. That's the arabon.
[1:00:32] That's the earnest. Arabon, Greek,
[1:00:34] Greek, Greek. Amen. That's the earnest.
[1:00:36] So, when God gives you the Holy Spirit,
[1:00:38] that's the down payment.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? So, you you have the Holy Spirit,
[1:00:42] but that's the down payment. You're
[1:00:44] still living in a fallen human body, but
[1:00:47] you have the Holy Spirit, Brother Orin,
[1:00:49] but that's a down payment. But you're
[1:00:51] still in a human body. The full payment
[1:00:53] is coming.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; A new body is coming. A new earth is
[1:00:57] coming where there's no sin. There's no
[1:00:59] devil.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; So, we need to realize as Christians,
[1:01:02] from brother Abraham in the back all the
[1:01:04] way to me in the front, when God gives
[1:01:06] us the Holy Spirit, that's the down
[1:01:08] payment. Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; You're still human living in a human
[1:01:11] world amongst humans who don't love God
[1:01:14] and you're going to make mistakes.
[1:01:15] You're going to say things wrong. Amen.
[1:01:17] Does not mean that God didn't give you
[1:01:20] the Holy Spirit. It just means you're
[1:01:22] human. It just means the full payment is
[1:01:24] coming. Oh, I so appreciate down the
[1:01:27] road I'm going to have a body that's
[1:01:28] different from this body. Amen. I'm
[1:01:30] going to live in a world without sin.
[1:01:32] I'm going to live in a world without
[1:01:33] sickness and no devil.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; The full payment is coming. I tell my
[1:01:40] wife sometimes as a joke, you know, like
[1:01:42] I love my wife and we have a great
[1:01:44] relationship and so forth, but I
[1:01:46] thought, you know, imagine our
[1:01:48] relationship, no sin, no devil, no
[1:01:52] fallen nature. It' be so different,
[1:01:55] right? Because we have those things as
[1:01:57] brother Ricard was saying, those
[1:01:58] principalities and powers, those other
[1:02:00] spirits trying to war against us and so
[1:02:02] forth. All right, we're down to the
[1:02:04] three-minute mark here.
[1:02:07] Another thing is okay saying I love you
[1:02:10] mom saying thank you amen brother John
[1:02:13] and um one more thing I want to mention
[1:02:15] here is learning not to fight with our
[1:02:17] siblings as I was mentioning Jessica
[1:02:20] Jessica and charity and so forth some of
[1:02:22] you are giggling how come but if we can
[1:02:25] learn not to fight with our siblings
[1:02:27] amend put you in a home together for a
[1:02:30] purpose with certain parents together
[1:02:31] for a purpose and your family if you can
[1:02:34] learn to not fight with each other.
[1:02:36] It'll help translate into you learning
[1:02:38] not to fight with other Christians.
[1:02:41] Amen. You need to realize, hey, we're in
[1:02:43] a family together.
[1:02:45] Some of us have Morton blood. Some of us
[1:02:47] have Andy's blood. Some of us have Drake
[1:02:50] blood. But every son and daughter of
[1:02:51] God's connected to the blood of Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ. Amen. And we need to not just
[1:02:56] think of our own little family clans.
[1:02:57] You know, Morton clan, Morton clan. No,
[1:03:01] we're the we're the family of God. Amen.
[1:03:04] through the blood of Jesus Christ. So we
[1:03:06] need to think bigger than just our own
[1:03:08] little tribes and clans. Amen. The Mcra
[1:03:10] clan and so forth
[1:03:12] because you know we don't want to fight
[1:03:14] in the backyard with one another and in
[1:03:17] the front yard with one another. Amen.
[1:03:19] It's not going to help the spirit of God
[1:03:21] move in our church, move in our meetings
[1:03:23] and so forth. Amen. I pray God baptize
[1:03:25] us aresh. Lord, don't let me be an
[1:03:28] instigator and a fighter of one another.
[1:03:30] Help me be able to put myself in their
[1:03:32] shoes a little bit. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Maybe the musicians can come.
[1:03:41] These are just some things that as an
[1:03:43] earthly parent they would love to see
[1:03:45] from their kids. I know my mom there. We
[1:03:47] have four boys. I have three, some of
[1:03:49] you don't know, but I have three
[1:03:50] brothers. And one thing my mom loves so
[1:03:53] much, this is my earthly mom, is she so
[1:03:56] loves how my my me and my brothers, we
[1:03:58] get along. It means so much to her. for
[1:04:00] Christmas. Uh Christmas, we gave her a
[1:04:02] big picture of the four boys together
[1:04:05] and she opened it up and she's like,
[1:04:09] she just started breaking down cuz
[1:04:10] there's her four boys getting along. It
[1:04:14] just meant so much to her. Amen. How
[1:04:16] much more the heart of God when he sees
[1:04:18] his sons and daughters getting along.
[1:04:20] Amen. Recognizing that we're all a bit
[1:04:23] different, but that we're family. Amen.
[1:04:27] So these are some things an earthly
[1:04:28] parent they just love to see. Our
[1:04:31] heavenly father loves to see them much
[1:04:34] much more. Amen. Does anybody want to
[1:04:37] please your heavenly father?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's also start by pleasing our
[1:04:42] earthly parents. Amen. Can we try that
[1:04:45] when we leave camp tomorrow? Lord, help
[1:04:47] me honor my father and my mother. And
[1:04:50] Lord, help me honor you. Praise the
[1:04:52] Lord. Maybe we can stand to our feet.
[1:04:54] Brother Ryan's going to help me sing a
[1:04:55] song from Psalms 18 that he wrote that
[1:04:59] uh I just love.
[1:05:02] We can sing together. Open unto me
[1:05:09] your gates of rightuousness.
[1:05:16] Oh, and I
[1:05:19] will enter in and give you praise.
[1:05:30] Open unto me
[1:05:36] your gates of rightuousness.
[1:05:43] Oh, and I
[1:05:46] will enter in and give you praise.
[1:05:55] For you are my God
[1:06:02] and I give you praise.
[1:06:08] You are my God.
[1:06:14] I exalt your name.
[1:06:21] You are my God
[1:06:27] and I give you praise.
[1:06:34] You are my God.
[1:06:40] I exalt
[1:06:42] your name.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And then one more time. Open unto me.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, open unto me
[1:06:55] your gates of rightuousness.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] You and I
[1:07:05] will enter in and give you praise.
[1:07:15] Lord, open unto me.
[1:07:21] Your gates are rightuous.
[1:07:29] and I
[1:07:32] will enter in and give you praise.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are my God.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; For you are my God
[1:07:47] and I give you praise.
[1:07:55] You are my God.
[1:08:00] I exalt your name.
[1:08:08] You are my God
[1:08:14] and I give you praise.
[1:08:21] You are my God.
[1:08:27] I exalt
[1:08:29] your name.
[1:08:33] Praise the Lord. Amen. It makes all the
[1:08:36] difference when he opens up this life to
[1:08:38] us. Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; We can't just walk into it by ourselves.
[1:08:41] God opens it up for us. Then's the time
[1:08:44] to walk into it. Amen. when he opens up
[1:08:46] the Christian life for you. When he
[1:08:47] opens up his mercy, when he opens up his
[1:08:49] grace, that's the time to walk into it.
[1:08:51] Amen. Noah's family, his sons walked
[1:08:55] into that ark. There was a time where it
[1:08:57] was open for them to walk into and they
[1:08:59] walked into it. And that's what we want
[1:09:00] to do. Amen. All the young people, are
[1:09:03] you doing good? Amen. Raise your hand if
[1:09:06] you're doing good. Praise the Lord. It's
[1:09:08] it's the last night of junior camp. It's
[1:09:10] not the last night of camp, though. We
[1:09:13] still have more services, right? when we
[1:09:15] go on to the tent the next few days.
[1:09:17] It's not just for the senior campers,
[1:09:18] it's for us also. So, our our camp's
[1:09:21] just going to keep going. And some of
[1:09:22] you, maybe you can't be there, but you
[1:09:24] can stream from your house and listen to
[1:09:26] Brother Ron and just worship God and so
[1:09:28] forth. So, just happy to speak to you
[1:09:30] and be here with you again this evening.
[1:09:32] And we'll just pray and then sing one
[1:09:35] more song. Brother Tom Ray will come and
[1:09:37] then afterwards we'll just go up to the
[1:09:39] snack shack, I believe, and have some
[1:09:42] snacks together. Let's have a word of
[1:09:44] prayer. We'll sing Lord, I lift your
[1:09:45] name after starting with the first
[1:09:47] verse.
[1:09:49] Precious Lord Jesus,
[1:09:51] there's none like you, Lord.
[1:09:54] We're just so thankful you opened up our
[1:09:57] mind and our hearts to know you. And
[1:09:59] Lord Jesus, your mercy and grace
[1:10:01] reaching out this week. We just pray
[1:10:04] that you'd help us respond. Lord,
[1:10:06] there's so many things, Lord, pulling us
[1:10:08] this way and that way. our minds can be
[1:10:10] so distracted and we can get used to
[1:10:13] just a church life. But Lord, we want to
[1:10:15] walk with you. I just believe you're
[1:10:17] opening this up to us, Father. You want
[1:10:19] to have a relationship with us, all of
[1:10:21] us, Lord Jesus. Not just the ministers,
[1:10:23] not just the deacons, not just those uh
[1:10:26] who we know of a certain family or this
[1:10:28] and that. God, you want a relationship
[1:10:30] with all of us, Lord. and help us unlock
[1:10:33] our minds and hearts to believe this
[1:10:35] Lord Jesus and to enjoy it and to
[1:10:37] worship you and to thank you for it Lord
[1:10:40] and to Lord to be what you want us to be
[1:10:43] Lord we don't try and be somebody else
[1:10:46] you love us as we are Lord you'll
[1:10:49] transform us little by little and we
[1:10:52] thank you Lord help us worship you all
[1:10:53] the way strengthen us for the trials
[1:10:56] ahead Lord help us not get fear faint
[1:10:59] and weary but Help us worship you, Lord.
[1:11:02] We just want to sing one more song as we
[1:11:04] turn to Bl. Lord, may you receive it and
[1:11:06] be glad. We pray. Amen. Verse one. Lord,
[1:11:09] I lift your name.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, my heart can grow.
[1:11:20] So far away
[1:11:23] and cold.
[1:11:26] And yet for me your love is still the
[1:11:32] same.
[1:11:39] Lord I bend my knee
[1:11:45] in all I fear of thee.
[1:11:51] My head bowed down in reence to your
[1:11:57] name.
[1:12:02] Lord, I lift
[1:12:05] your
[1:12:07] name.

[1:12:13] name,

[1:12:19] God.

[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, my heart's desire
[1:12:58] is to be filled with the spirit's fire.
[1:13:05] My purpose is to worship you. You alone
[1:13:16] open
[1:13:18] up my soul
[1:13:23] to worship and adore
[1:13:29] to be a friend with offering to your
[1:13:35] own.
[1:13:38] Hallelujah.
[1:13:40] Lord, I lift your

[1:14:11] the bra.

[1:14:22] and my
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it one more time. Let's
[1:14:25] all lift our hands now to worship. Lord,
[1:14:28] I lift your name.
[1:14:34] your holy
[1:14:38] name

[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And
[1:15:12] King,
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; why don't you just thank him in your own
[1:15:16] way right now?
[1:15:18] Thank the Lord Jesus that he gave you an
[1:15:20] opportunity to come to camp. Thank the
[1:15:23] Lord Jesus
[1:15:26] that he can deal with your heart. Thank
[1:15:28] the Lord Jesus
[1:15:30] for his tender Holy Spirit knocking on
[1:15:33] your heart
[1:15:35] to thank him for all he's doing within
[1:15:37] your heart and life within your home
[1:15:40] within your family.
[1:15:43] We thank you Lord for the word of God
[1:15:45] that we heard this evening.
[1:15:48] We thank you for the way it was
[1:15:50] delivered and spoken to us. Lord,
[1:15:54] we thank God for the gifts that are
[1:15:55] within the body that can speak, get
[1:15:58] their point across, have the Holy Spirit
[1:16:01] punctuated.
[1:16:03] Father, we're thankful for all you are
[1:16:06] doing and have done and will continue to
[1:16:08] do.
[1:16:10] We bless your holy name. We glorify the
[1:16:13] King of glory and worthy is the Lamb.
[1:16:16] You're worthy of all praise.
[1:16:18] We bless your name, Lord. We thank you
[1:16:22] again
[1:16:23] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:16:26] Amen. You can have your seat just for a
[1:16:29] moment.
[1:16:32] I thought that was very fitting and very
[1:16:34] appropriate. Brother Kyle, he asked
[1:16:37] Brother Tom and Brother Ron, did we have
[1:16:39] pet rocks? He said, I believe that was
[1:16:42] in the 70s. You know why I love him so
[1:16:45] much? That makes me 20 years younger
[1:16:47] than what I am. I was married, had
[1:16:50] children, and everything else when pet
[1:16:52] rocks were around.
[1:16:54] I was not a kid at the time. So, I feel
[1:16:57] very young tonight. Thank you very much,
[1:16:58] brother K. It made me feel good.
[1:17:04] It's a very good point. Brother Kyle was
[1:17:06] making many, many, many good points.
[1:17:10] And so often we say, you know, learn to
[1:17:13] say sorry.
[1:17:16] It's so hard for you to say sorry,
[1:17:21] but it should not ever be hard for you
[1:17:23] to say thank you.
[1:17:26] Thank you. Why don't you turn around and
[1:17:29] say, "Thank you for being my my buddy
[1:17:31] camper.
[1:17:35] It'll be a memory that you will have for
[1:17:36] the rest of your life. Thank you for
[1:17:38] being my counselor.
[1:17:41] Thank you for making this camp so
[1:17:43] special because you made my my cabin
[1:17:45] special by being there. Thank you. Thank
[1:17:47] you, Henry. You've blessed me, just
[1:17:50] being here. I'm praying with you the
[1:17:53] other night and I I spoke of it a number
[1:17:55] of times. That blesses my heart. It
[1:17:59] really does. First camp, right, Henry?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Second already. Man, you're getting old.
[1:18:08] I think it's a tremendous thing
[1:18:12] that you took, brother Jason, and had
[1:18:14] your sons, the sons stand there. How
[1:18:16] many remember that? You haven't
[1:18:18] forgotten that already, right, Brother
[1:18:20] Jason? I hate to do it to you. Please
[1:18:22] come stand here.
[1:18:25] We're friends anyways. He knows that,
[1:18:27] right?
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Where's the boys?
[1:18:33] We're going to do it again because that
[1:18:36] is real.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; That is very real. Okay, boys.
[1:18:41] I want you to give your dad a hug and
[1:18:42] say, "Thanks, Dad, for letting us come
[1:18:44] to camp.
[1:18:47] You
[1:18:49] Thank you. Thank you."
[1:18:52] Did all children, did you get to see
[1:18:54] that?
[1:18:57] You know, Brother Tom was once blonde.
[1:19:02] It's true. I was once blonde and I was
[1:19:04] once in business
[1:19:07] and I was back east. I was in Montreal.
[1:19:09] I flew in. I had a business situation I
[1:19:12] had to deal with. And Brother Briscoll
[1:19:14] said, "Look up an old friend of mine
[1:19:16] that I knew from 20 years before then
[1:19:21] and just and just say hello to him." I
[1:19:24] said, ' Okay, I'll do that, Brother Ed.
[1:19:25] I'll do that for you. So, this this man
[1:19:28] is very high up in business, very
[1:19:30] wellto-d do man. Everything's fine,
[1:19:32] everything's wonderful. So, I found out
[1:19:34] where he was. I went to his his uh store
[1:19:38] and and I asked one of the salespeople.
[1:19:40] I said, "Is is our man the man here?" He
[1:19:44] said, "Yes, he's in his office." He's in
[1:19:46] his office.
[1:19:49] He said, "You go just go through this
[1:19:51] store. You go through those curtains.
[1:19:52] You go into the back room. You knock on
[1:19:54] that door and he'll be at his desk. Sir,
[1:19:56] I'm not trying to delay this. Just
[1:19:58] trying to you. So, it was powerful for
[1:20:01] the Kyle.
[1:20:03] So, I'm a nobody. I'm just a
[1:20:05] businessman. I'm just out. I'm doing
[1:20:07] what I have to do to to supply for my
[1:20:10] family.
[1:20:12] And this man is very high up. And I walk
[1:20:14] on knock on the door and with a Jewish
[1:20:16] accent, he says, "Come on in."
[1:20:20] So, he says, "Who are you, sir?" I said,
[1:20:22] "Uh, you don't know me from a hole in
[1:20:24] the wall."
[1:20:26] He says, 'Well, who are you?'
[1:20:29] I said, 'I'm Ray. That still didn't mean
[1:20:34] anything.
[1:20:37] He said, and what are you doing here,
[1:20:39] sir? I said, I'm here to greet you from
[1:20:42] Ed Biscll.
[1:20:45] This man had to be somewhere in his 60s.
[1:20:48] jumps over the desk,
[1:20:51] gives me the biggest bear hug I've ever
[1:20:54] had,
[1:20:55] and he says, "A son-in-law of Brother
[1:20:58] Biscll or Ed Biscll is a son-in-law of
[1:21:01] Arman."
[1:21:02] I go, "Whoa, what a greeting." He says,
[1:21:06] "I'll never forget and thank brother
[1:21:09] Bisll
[1:21:10] for what he's done for me." And that's
[1:21:13] years down the road. He says, "You must
[1:21:16] come and have dinner with me and my
[1:21:18] family." I said, "You don't know me."
[1:21:23] Like he said, he said, "If you are a
[1:21:24] son-in-law of Ed Biscllow," he says,
[1:21:26] "you're like my son-in-law." I said,
[1:21:28] "Really?
[1:21:31] We I we should treat one another like
[1:21:33] this." These Jewish absolute Orthodox
[1:21:37] Jew, natural Israel,
[1:21:42] natural.
[1:21:44] We're sitting and we're having a
[1:21:45] heart-to-heart talk. What made brother
[1:21:47] Biscllow leave business and come to
[1:21:50] Vancouver and I'm trying to explain God
[1:21:52] to him and the Lord Jesus and the whole
[1:21:55] thing. And we are into deep thought and
[1:21:57] deep talking. And in comes this
[1:22:01] kinkyhaired, the best looking young man,
[1:22:04] all of skin complexion. He comes running
[1:22:07] in the room and he interrupts
[1:22:11] his daddy and me talking.
[1:22:15] Excuse me, father. I am so sorry. And
[1:22:20] I'm looking at a 16-year-old boy. He
[1:22:23] says, "Father, would you forgive me for
[1:22:25] interrupting your conversation?"
[1:22:29] And I go, "Whoa, I'm impressed.
[1:22:32] I'm very impressed." And and and so he
[1:22:35] said, "Excuse me to me." He says, "I
[1:22:38] must hug my father."
[1:22:43] Wouldn't that wouldn't that be
[1:22:44] tremendous if you came home
[1:22:47] and just every day he came home? He
[1:22:49] wasn't doing that for me. He was doing
[1:22:52] it because he loved his father.
[1:22:55] God wants fellowship.
[1:22:58] It's relationship.
[1:23:00] That's 16. So, we're back into our
[1:23:02] conversation again, and the then now
[1:23:05] here comes this this distinguished
[1:23:08] 19-year-old, nice suit, tie, walks in,
[1:23:12] powerhouse,
[1:23:14] walks in the room, he takes command of
[1:23:17] the whole situation at 19.
[1:23:20] Mind, it helps when you got a few
[1:23:21] million. You know what I mean?
[1:23:25] So he interrupts us
[1:23:28] and he says, "Father,
[1:23:31] forgive me for interrupting your
[1:23:34] conversation. Excuse me." He doesn't
[1:23:36] even know my name yet. And he grabs his
[1:23:39] daddy and gives him a big hug. 16, 19,
[1:23:43] and there's another son that comes in.
[1:23:45] This is natural Jew.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Natural Jew. What you heard tonight was
[1:23:51] spiritual Jew.
[1:23:52] Children, if you can put that into
[1:23:54] effect, it will change your home.
[1:23:56] Respect and honor your mother and your
[1:23:59] father. Not just camp of learning
[1:24:01] things. We have lost a lot of that.
[1:24:09] I read a book one time called the
[1:24:12] mastering the thank you. Mastering the
[1:24:16] thank you.
[1:24:18] If you can master what you heard
[1:24:19] tonight, it will change your life. To
[1:24:22] thank not only your daddy and mommy to
[1:24:25] come to camp, but then the next morning
[1:24:28] figuring out another way to say thank
[1:24:30] you for allowing me to come to camp.
[1:24:32] They said if you can master the art of
[1:24:35] thank you, it will transform your life.
[1:24:38] Just those two words, thank you. Because
[1:24:42] today there's no appreciation for
[1:24:44] anything.
[1:24:47] So, I thought, what a way to end a
[1:24:49] junior camp so that you can thank the
[1:24:52] Lord Jesus
[1:24:55] for allowing you to come and be in the
[1:24:58] presence of the Lord. So, I want to
[1:25:00] thank
[1:25:02] the counselors.
[1:25:04] I want to thank brother Ed Biscll and
[1:25:06] Sister Ruth Biscll.
[1:25:08] Don't you ever ever forget. Because if
[1:25:12] time should Terry and I go on that the
[1:25:16] vision of a man and a woman, a brother,
[1:25:21] our pastor, and his wife was to have a
[1:25:24] camp so that you children could be in
[1:25:27] the presence of God. I say that's
[1:25:30] vision. And God fulfilled the vision.
[1:25:33] And by doing that, you've been able to
[1:25:35] enjoy this camp. I would want you to
[1:25:38] thank our God for that.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care what day of the week it is,
[1:25:44] day of the month, year, whatever. When
[1:25:46] you pass, Brother Biscll, you might just
[1:25:48] say thank you right out of the blue
[1:25:52] and say, "Thank you, brother Ed, for the
[1:25:53] vision
[1:25:55] to have a camp so that I can worship
[1:25:58] God." No. Hey, listen. There's a lot of
[1:26:01] churches, a lot of It's all about them.
[1:26:03] It's not about our children. We
[1:26:06] missionary in our own backyard. And
[1:26:09] that's why you're here, so that we can
[1:26:11] missionary out in the world.
[1:26:15] The Psalm says in 40 and5, "Many, oh
[1:26:18] Lord, my God, are thy wonderful works
[1:26:21] which thou have done." God, I believe,
[1:26:24] has done wonderful works in this camp
[1:26:27] for your lives. The presence of God has
[1:26:30] come. He's dealt with your hearts and he
[1:26:33] will continue to deal with your hearts.
[1:26:36] He said, "Thy thoughts are towards us."
[1:26:40] So God in his mind, you were all babies
[1:26:44] when we had these camp when this camp we
[1:26:46] bought this camp and hear you now. Many
[1:26:48] of you were babies and now you here
[1:26:51] enjoying it. His thoughts were towards
[1:26:53] you so that you can enjoy the word of
[1:26:56] God. The Bible says they're wonderful
[1:26:58] works hard to be reckoned. If I would
[1:27:02] declare and speak of them, they're more
[1:27:04] than could be numbered what God's done
[1:27:06] for you.
[1:27:11] Camp doesn't happen by you just showing
[1:27:14] up.
[1:27:17] And so I want to thank and I would like
[1:27:19] you to start doing this. And I want you
[1:27:21] young girls to listen to me in my last
[1:27:24] few moments. This is very important. And
[1:27:26] this this comes to this message
[1:27:30] to thank your counselor, to thank the
[1:27:33] kitchen staff, to thank the brothers on
[1:27:35] the cameras, to thank the technicians
[1:27:37] that make it possible because you know
[1:27:40] these services aren't just here. This
[1:27:42] actually goes around the world. Your
[1:27:44] faces will be seen in almost every
[1:27:48] country
[1:27:50] from Africa to Europe to Asia, wherever.
[1:27:55] So God has a purpose and we want to be
[1:27:58] able to thank God for fulfilling that
[1:28:02] purpose. I want to thank brother Ricard
[1:28:04] and Michael Andes. I want to thank
[1:28:07] brother Kyle Morton for being a big
[1:28:10] part. I want to thank my son Michael Ray
[1:28:12] Abigail. And if we start going into it,
[1:28:14] Marco, Sharon, Kim, Joel, Jana, Dave.
[1:28:19] It's amazing. It's amazing. you start
[1:28:22] numbering up the hours and some of us
[1:28:24] just come on camp and and expect a
[1:28:26] wonderful time months in advance. I have
[1:28:29] a young man that comes to me said, "Dad,
[1:28:32] camp is 3 months away. What are we
[1:28:35] doing?" So, it takes a lot of planning,
[1:28:39] a lot of prayer.
[1:28:41] We've prayed. We believed Brother Ron
[1:28:43] Spencer agreed to come a year ago. God
[1:28:48] had in his mind our speaker and he was
[1:28:52] gracious enough to come to our camp with
[1:28:55] Sister Connie Spencer. And we thank God
[1:28:57] that you said yes, brother Ron. And we
[1:29:00] want to thank you tonight as in junior
[1:29:02] camp. God bless you.
[1:29:05] All the musicians, all the kitchen
[1:29:07] staff,
[1:29:08] Brother John, Sister Sharon, they'll
[1:29:10] jump in to do anything at any time for
[1:29:14] anyone.
[1:29:17] every counselor and helper. We couldn't
[1:29:19] even ha have a camp unless you
[1:29:22] sacrificed your time and loss of work,
[1:29:25] loss of wages, and then paying to come.
[1:29:29] You're marvelous in my eyes. I respect
[1:29:32] you and I love you for it. I love seeing
[1:29:36] the mommies and the daddies coming
[1:29:37] behind getting their own little cabins
[1:29:40] in support of prayer for their children
[1:29:43] that are here. I can't, brother Kyle,
[1:29:46] thank God enough.
[1:29:48] And if you start hearing me jumping
[1:29:50] around camp saying, "Thank you. Thank
[1:29:51] you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
[1:29:54] It's because I mean it.
[1:29:57] I thank God for every one of you.
[1:30:04] And yes, God wants fellowship with you.
[1:30:07] Did you notice I the other part, Brother
[1:30:10] Kyle? You know, I we don't we we tweak
[1:30:12] each other. Okay, we tweak each other,
[1:30:14] right?
[1:30:16] I did you see that slide up there? That
[1:30:19] slide that brother Kyle showed
[1:30:25] and the title of his message.
[1:30:29] Who saw the slide?
[1:30:31] What was the title?
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; What was the title?
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; I can't hear you. I want relationship
[1:30:42] with you.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Very good. Levi, stand up.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Turn it around and say it to everybody.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; God wants a relationship with you. Yes,
[1:30:54] you.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Now, the part that I'd like to tweak on
[1:30:57] that, you had it very small,
[1:31:00] but I think God wants it very big.
[1:31:04] Yes, you. God wants relationship
[1:31:10] with you. Remember that this camp.
[1:31:15] The sisters apparently have something
[1:31:17] that is
[1:31:19] Kyle, you said a snack afterwards here.
[1:31:24] So, just to show you who's here now, the
[1:31:26] kitchen staff, they're up very early in
[1:31:29] the morning making every dish there is.
[1:31:31] And brother Gail Ashdown, he's in the
[1:31:33] kitchen.
[1:31:35] Are you the only kitchen uh washer here
[1:31:38] tonight, Gil? Is there more here in
[1:31:40] here?
[1:31:42] Okay, I want everybody that works in the
[1:31:43] kitchen stand to your feet. Who's ever
[1:31:46] here?
[1:31:48] Can you shout thank you?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you.
[1:31:56] The unsung heroes are washing your
[1:31:59] plates.
[1:32:03] God must want to have fellowship with
[1:32:05] you. Yes, you. For these precious saints
[1:32:09] to do the labor that they're doing. And
[1:32:12] it's a labor of love. I want every
[1:32:14] counselor to stand up and every helper,
[1:32:16] please.
[1:32:18] Song leader, musician, technician.
[1:32:23] Anybody that's helped in this camp, I
[1:32:24] want you to stand up.
[1:32:28] Children, you are. This is the first
[1:32:30] time brother Tom's going to allow you
[1:32:31] now to turn around and look around the
[1:32:32] room. Look at all the people that helped
[1:32:36] to make this camp possible. Can you say
[1:32:38] thank you again?
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; I think a little louder.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You have your seats.
[1:32:50] Isn't that doesn't that sound good,
[1:32:51] brother Kyle?
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I love it. It shows actually there's
[1:32:55] some appreciation.
[1:32:56] So now can we thank the Lord Jesus for
[1:32:59] coming in this camp? Can we all SAY
[1:33:01] THANK YOU LORD?
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the privilege to be in
[1:33:08] your presence.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:13] Let's bow our heads one more time.
[1:33:17] Always
[1:33:18] sad to end camp but Lord this is not the
[1:33:21] end. This is just the comma. We are
[1:33:23] coming to a senior camp where we can
[1:33:26] enjoy the word of God as we have enjoyed
[1:33:28] it through this beginning of the week.
[1:33:31] We are praying for brother Ron Spencer
[1:33:34] with all of our hearts. We are praying
[1:33:37] God you'll take the man of God. You know
[1:33:40] our need and you know the burdens on our
[1:33:43] hearts. So God move him in channels he
[1:33:46] has even not thought of. Let the Holy
[1:33:49] Ghost take control of the very vessel
[1:33:53] you have chosen at this season. Lord,
[1:33:56] bless him and Sister Connie, Lord, for
[1:33:59] their love that they could come and be
[1:34:01] with us. We pray, Lord, that you'll
[1:34:04] blanket the camp, senior camp, with your
[1:34:06] presence that as the young ones will
[1:34:08] leave and the older ones will come, may
[1:34:11] it go smoothly. And may the presence of
[1:34:13] God that's here, Lord, start ministering
[1:34:16] to them quickly, we pray. And so, Lord,
[1:34:20] we will go and have some fellowship
[1:34:22] around some food that has been made by
[1:34:26] sanctified hands, blessed sisters,
[1:34:29] blessed brothers that have helped so
[1:34:31] much through the week. We pray that
[1:34:33] you'll bless them, that you will bless
[1:34:35] the food, that we will go rejoicing
[1:34:38] tonight, thanking you for this time that
[1:34:41] we've had at Junior Camp. Bless each one
[1:34:44] now. We ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[1:34:49] Who is in the Lord's army? I thought
[1:34:52] somebody would. Did they sing that song
[1:34:55] this morning? And I missed it. So,
[1:34:58] because I missed it, I got to sing it.
[1:35:00] Can we sing that before we go? Who's in
[1:35:02] the Lord's army? Well, then stand up.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Who's gonna help me? Levi,
[1:35:07] you gonna help me?
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:35:12] How do we start?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Shoot the artillery. Some folks like to
[1:35:25] fly over land and sea, but I'm in the
[1:35:28] Lord's army. Yes, sir.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; I'm in the Lord's army. Yes, sir.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I'm in the Lord's army. Yes, sir.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Some folks like to march in the
[1:35:42] infantry, ride in the calvaryary, shoot
[1:35:46] the artillery. Some folks like to fly
[1:35:50] over land and sea. But I'm in the Lord's
[1:35:53] army.
[1:35:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YEAH.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Greet one another.
[1:36:00] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Clean their cabins up.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; This is a nasty one. Nasty announcement.
[1:36:11] Here's the nasty announcement.
[1:36:14] Your cabins must be spotless tomorrow
[1:36:17] morning.
[1:36:20] Yeah, it's impossible.
[1:36:22] All things are possible, Levi. So, God
[1:36:25] bless you. Remember that because there's
[1:36:27] the ones coming in. Well, you're going
[1:36:29] out. Thank you.
[1:36:38] By the way, that pepperon
[1:37:13] Heat.
[1:37:16] Heat.
[1:37:40] Heat. Heat.
