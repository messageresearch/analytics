TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here you say well my mother is someplace my dad is someplace my father I I came here into this human existence uh listen to me God called for you to come and only used your mother and father and the human instrumentality to bring you here but God called you they didn't know anything about what you were going to be what kind of a child you're going to be how you're going to look how you're going to act what your attributes are what what your uh anything what your skills where what your gifts are what your talents where they're not going to know anything about that God called you here because God said I'm going to use that this is not exactly the right way but I'm going to use that and then I'm going to bring them here and then I'm going to cause my word my voice to be heard by them and they're going to hear that they're going to believe that they're going to come to the second birth and be birth of the Son of [Applause] God and I'm going to call them amen by a super they they will believe it even when it's a it seems even when it seems mystical to them they're going to believe it they're going to believe it when they don't even understand why why they believe it when they can't even explain how they believe it or why they believe it or how they've come to this and and in the midst of all of this how do you believe it when when everybody's against it how do you believe it when you can't explain it how do you believe it when uh uh when it's obvious that the whole thing is crumbling you can't I don't know you may be one of the two men on the way to AAS you may be one of the others that didn't even get to the tomb you may be one and you hear all kinds of things and you hear that and you hear something else and it's it's not doesn't come to you till we rise up again and fortify ourselves and get o opposing views and opposing that has nothing to do with it just let it go you're in Luke 24 you're in a transition hallu just let it go don't pay any attention to it it's not worth your [Music] [Applause] time your mind wasn't made for doubt you believe I don't know why I believe I believe because I've been made to believe I'm made that way I'm constructed that way I came into the world to believe this [Applause] word in the sense of the word we can say it's a blind faith but but then when you understand and things that have been said this is such an incredible statement
