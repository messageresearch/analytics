I'm going to ask our brother Nathaniel Law to open up in a word of prayer this morning. We've got a testimony for brother Alex. Said, "For some time, I've asked our Lord that when sickness would come to me that I would be able to overcome the enemy, the devil, just by taking God at his word with nothing else, just the word by itself would be sufficient for me to have the victory." Sure enough, the trial came and I started to have a cold that developed into some kind of pneumonia. Constantly coughing, struggling to keep breathing properly. Said, "I started the battle by confessing by his stripes I am healed and saying, "Thank you, Lord, for healing me." It's a hard battle. The devil tempted me to quit confessing, but as I kept thanking the Lord for healing me, day by day, I was doing a little better. Amen. It's completely cleared up. We're just thankful to know that by his stripes, I am healed. We're thankful for that. Let's sing together. Be it unto me according to your word. And we've got a number of requests we'll take before the Lord. Be it unto me according to your word. According to the proises I can say you just call upon the truth that sets me free [Music] to [Music] me. to me Lord to me according to your word for according to your I can [Applause] upon the truth that sets me free [Music] to your heart [Music] There's a request this morning.

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I left a barren land searching for rest. best stumbling around in amnesia, bitterness and distress. But then I met the kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty one. He took this old Moabitete from the field and brought me to his house. He said, "Fear not, my child, for you are part of me, and I'll not rest till you are at my side. I will do all that you ask of me. You're a jewel in my eyes. Virtuous woman, you are my bride.

You're a jewel in my eyes. I love you woman. &gt;&gt; You are my bride.

Well, I'll let you have your seats. Thank you, choir. I need to make some announcements. So, if you give me your kind attention, you might even want to or need to jot some of these down. Now, if you have a good photogenic mind, you probably don't need to, but uh I wouldn't trust don't trust everything to your me mental powers. When you do, we generally get phone calls to the office saying, "What was that date again? What are we doing then?" This way, you'll be able to know. Uh tonight, Brother Tony and Brother Murphy have uh been preparing a uh a service for us having to do with a great deal of what has been taking place right up to this current moment in China. Of course, we can't tell you everything uh because just so much of it can't be made public, but for those of you that are here and have followed the work, at least you can read between the lines and you'll see uh the results of the work that has been taking place. I think brother Murphy just returned last Friday after about uh I mean a week ago this Friday after about two months there in China. Brother Timothy Ma, we want to be remembering him. He's been in Vietnam for over a month now and uh is continuing. He's planning to be away maybe as much as 3 months. Uh part of that he wants to go to certain areas of China and uh as as you know he is Chinese but spent 11 years pastoring in Vietnam under the severe strict communist regime. So he's very very acquainted with uh how things operate there and he does certainly move about differently than say we would or anybody from United States or Canada or Europe. Uh he can move about. He has relatives. He has friends and he knows how to deal with those the people. And so we're happy for the work and the progress, the number of books that are being translated, message books into the Vietnamese language and into the Chinese language. And I can say for my own part, I'm I'm most happy to see what is happening in Asia because this is a as far as population is concerned, it's the giant of the world. really is and we're really happy about that. So that's tonight. You won't want to miss that. Now, our special Thanksgiving services are going to be on Friday, November the 24th, and then Sunday, November the 26, Sunday morning at 10:30, Sunday evening at 5:00 p.m. Uh, Brother Tim Puit will be the visiting minister, and we've had him most of the times that he has been here. He's been here for a camp speaker, but we just felt I really felt led to have him at this time. I don't know what all God has in store, but I believe it's going to be a really a wonderful weekend. And we're just going to turn him loose. Let the Holy Spirit do what he wishes to do. There will be no service on Wednesday the 22nd because we'll be going on the 24th with the Friday service. And we want you to be well prepared and ready on Sunday, December the 24th. Uh that will be one service on December the on December the 24th. One service that's a Sunday. Next day is Christmas. And many many of our congregation which are from European descent as was my own parents and my family. their their gathering for their families was always Christmas Eve and so we want to give opportunity uh many of the people are here of the church they have they'll be with their families many of them unsaved many of them just from perhaps some church religious denomination and we want you to be a testimony at that time so Sunday December the 24th will be one service on Sunday December the 31st First, there'll be a morning service at the usual time of 10:30 and then the evening service will be our uh New Year's Eve watch night service which will begin at 9:00. So, that is the uh the immediate uh announcements. Then I want to say a word about the 207 uh international internet convention which is going from July the 1st to July the 8th 8 days. It's the longest that we've ever had and I just felt inspired to do that and Lord willing we are we've already had the first initial meeting of tying together assemblies and congregations in different places around the globe where they will be able to the time and schedule permitting they'll be able to live stream uh a service and perhaps their pastor may be here and they will be able to live stream the service over in other countries. Now, as far as Europe and Eastern Europe is concerned and much of Africa, they will be able to get the morning service here in the evening over there. So, congregations will be seated in many different places in the world and actually participating in the service along with us at that time. It's the first time that I know of it happening at the certainly the first time happening here and God has given us very very skilled and qualified people to uh to be able to put this thing together. So we're trusting the Lord to help us. That is our goal. July the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, that is Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, we'll be here in the church. And we'll be having uh uh we haven't got a schedule as exactly as yet because we want to tie ministers meetings in and have foreign brothers speaking from other countries. We will also tie in uh something for our young people. We will uh perhaps emphasize the youth one day and uh and and then and then we're going to have the services from Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be in the Shandis auditorium which is at the Pacific Academy uh school. So that's the Shandis auditorium which will be Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday and those will be evening meetings over there. anything that takes place those days in the afternoon or morning will be taking place here. Now, the reason I'm going into this much detail at this point and for those of you that are on the internet streaming at this time, uh it is imperative and if you have relatives or friends or ministers that you think may want to come and attend, it's imperative, absolutely critical that they apply for visas now. At this time we have had brother Tony was uh relating to me one brother uh was waiting 6 months for visa from India and I don't know did he finally get it brother Tony or did a time pass something like that it did it didn't happen I understand so uh that's number one and those you that are streaming now if you are wish to come or plan to come you must apply for your visa immediately and and uh contact us. Now also we want any who are planning to attend to contact us because there's two reasons. Number one, it's the highest uh tourist week of the year. July the 1st the holiday here in Canada. July the 4th the holiday on the US side. So that's the highest uh um occupancy in the hotels during that week. That's number one. Number two, this area and the city of Suri is hosting some kind of a worldass ball uh tournament and everything is being booked up and much of it has been booked up. So you must those are that are streaming and if you may have a minister or a pastor uh that you want you can contact you must uh contact us immediately. Contact us now. send an email if you would this next week and so that we will have some idea as to how many are going to actually be attending because we need to block off the rooms as of as of this next week. And uh for we only found one hotel that will allow us to block off the rooms with a cancellation privilege uh down the road. One hotel wanted 100% of the payment made right now and other hotels wanted 50%. So we have to know how many rooms we're going to block off and we are going to be be blocking them off because we know that a lot from uh states in Canada are going to be coming to attend the the services. And lastly, I would like that the church members here who have a a a space available, if you would please contact the office. See, we need to do this way up front. We only have 7 months and that's not a long period of time for what it is we're wanting to achieve. If you have a room that's available, phone the office if you would this next week and let them know that I have a room for a couple or I have a room for a a a sister. I have a room for couple men whatever it is and let us know so we can begin to uh put this together and we'll be having team leaders people who are in charge of billeting people who are in charge of transportation people who will be in charge of giving uh uh immigration information. We're not going to try to be immigration people but we will have questions and we're going to have people who will be in charge of those things. And the other thing is as you you that are part of the assembly, you well know we have we want the people who are coming here uh to be able to also have a US visa so that because they may be bilited on the US side and so we've we've gained this experience from some of the problems we've had in the past. And uh you don't know what it's like to have someone come from overseas and they have a US visa and come to the border and they won't let them come over for the special meeting or they come here for the special meeting and then I want to take them down for dinner someplace and oh they don't have a US visa. And so we've always had that for years and years and we've got a lot of experience but we have found that the uh we found that homeland security and the Canadian immigration are quite inflexible. We haven't found them too cooperative when it comes to those kind of things. And I think you know what I'm talking about. And so, well, one day there'll be no borders in heaven either. Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Praise God. Nice to see you, brother Paul. Sister Jerry. Amen. And I got your letter. And we'll we'll do your your wish today. our brother Paul Hlet. He's pastoring in Boisee, Idaho, and the work is growing. He drove all the way up from Boisee and his wife because he desires to be installed into the ministry formally and ordained to the ministry. And we'll we're going to do that. I'd like to have you stand if you would and I'd like to sing that chorus. Uh we worship you in the highest place. Would you do that? Help us, brother. We worship you in the highest place for you. I high we praise you [Music] for all [Music] and we come to you and worship at your feet. We place you in the highest place for you. I high [Music] Oh, [Music] and we come to you and worship at your feet. &gt;&gt; I wonder, brother Paul, would you please come? We're going to have you come and stand here. Brother Tony, if you would join me, please. Also, as a prophet of God has said, we do not and are we are unable to give any man a gift. The gift is something that's born in him. If you just come and stand here, brother Paul, please. And what we are doing now as a congregation, we are acknowledging before God the gift that God has placed in our brother. We don't do this lightly. I've known our brother Paul Haylet and his wife Sister Jerry for many, many, many years. I've seen a stability. I've seen a burden even when he was not aware that he should be taking this responsibility. And sometimes it has to take uh certain events that evolve and then the people themselves become aware. We need some we need a shepherd and and and by the time that awareness comes on them they realize we have him right here. And I really like to see what has taken place in Boisey in that the people come to that awareness. they come to that uh realization and at the same time here's one that's been right amongst them and they've all been together like a family and the realization comes upon him that the burden that he's had is the burden of the word of the Lord and those are the two realizations which have to take place and brother Paul even though I have not been there but I've been in such close contact with you and with others from the assembly, but particularly yourself. And I realize that this is what has happened. And so, as we come and lay hands on you, we are we are acknowledging the gift that God has placed within you and ordain you to the ministry of the Lord's work. There will be difficult times as there has been. There'll be heavy burdens as there has been and there'll be more. But there'll be grace. there be special wisdom and there is a special anointing that goes with it. And I have noticed that it's it's just as true true to pattern as can be. When someone is ordained into the ministry, there is a special anointing that comes upon that individual. And I'm going to ask you all to bow your heads with us as we pray and lay hands upon our brother. God bless you, brother. Heavenly Father, we are standing on sacred ground. Our brother Paul Haylet has not only served you, but he's lived for you even before he perhaps even dreamed of having a ministry such as you have opened the door and made a way. And sometimes, as your prophet has said, a minister runs from it. But yet, there's a time when he cannot run any longer. The burden overtakes, oh God. Overtakes and consumes the individual. And I know that the burden has consumed our brother Paul, oh God, and his wife also sharing in that being a helpmate to him. I pray, Father, that you will bless her in her place and her post of duty. But now as we lay hands upon our brother Paul, we ordain him to the calling and separate him to the purpose for which you have had for him. And you have done this, Lord, not just at this moment, but you've had this in your mind. You have called him from his youth, oh Lord. He was birthed with this gift. And I pray now you'll use this gift mightily. Give him wisdom, Lord, at the times when he he's in decision making. And may he truly be the ox of the team. As your servant, your prophet has said, the pastor is the ox of the team. He just has a way to bring people together. Oh God, I pray that you will use him and prosper the work in Boyisey and give this message a mighty voice there. I pray we send him, oh God. We send him with the blessings of God upon his life and upon his work and upon his ministry. We ask it in the almighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Glory to God &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit shall abide in him oh God in a in a overflowing measure. And I pray the people will be strengthened and blessed under his ministry &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you, Paul. God bless. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. I'll invite you to take your Bibles if you would please turn to Romans the 8th chapter. Sorry to take up so much time with the announcements, but we some these things are just necessary. I'm going to begin to read at the 35th verse down to verse 39. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Just before you're seated, we'll pray. Father, I stand here today, oh God, at the post of duty and have no desire whatsoever to impose man's thoughts or man's words upon this congregation of people because man's words will fail and they are limited with time, Lord. But your word is eternal. They are indestructible. Your word will produce life. Your word will change lives. Your word will break feathers and bondages. Your word will defeat Satan every time. Your word will heal the sick. Your word can cast out cancers and change the cell and the molecular system within a person's body, the chemistry. Your word will heal diabetes. Your word, oh God, will clear the mind of those that have been afflicted. Your word will heal the emotional individual. Oh God, I pray, Father, that your word now will come forth and that you will be the speaker and let my lips now just be separated to your service to be an instrument in your hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Let that name be glorified. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. For those of you that have been following in the services and we've been taking uh in the seals, taking subjects and thoughts from the seals and even though these may not it may not be in absolute continuity, yet if you listen very closely, you'll see that they do tie together very very much. So, for those of you that are here that have not been in the other services, but we've been speaking as a result of the seals, uh I'm very much I'm very much consumed by uh and determined to bring some of these things to you and I pray they'll be a great blessing. There is one thing that I like to make and preface my remarks this morning in the message by a statement that I would like you to remember. And that is that any revelation of God or revelation of a divine nature will translate into a into a a change within an individual's life. And that change will cause that person to be more Christlike. &gt;&gt; If it's a true revelation &gt;&gt; I have had over the years all too often and even a few times would be too many those that have come to me and and sometimes they're just enthused. They're inspired about a certain thing that they came across or a certain thing that they heard and they're really caught up with it. And I can see that almost every time you meet them that they're on the same subject and it just seems so they seem so quickened by it. I do two things. I I just listen and the second thing I do is watch. I watch to see what this truth or this revelation or this inspiration I watch to see what it's going to translate into. And if it doesn't start translating into a deeper walk with God and more of the life of Jesus Christ being expressed in them right away, I put a big question mark over what the inspiration was and where it came from and what it's all about. I I I don't have to make a decision on I I just back away. I don't chew over it. I don't get into any debate about it. It might be something perhaps I don't clearly see, but it's such a reality to this individual and I just back away. But every real true revelation will produce the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that is an absolute. Brother Brandham has said in a message from that time, he said, "When a man meets God, he's changed from that minute. When a man meets God, the rest of his days, he'll never be the same because he's got eternal life. He's a new creature and old things have passed away and all things have become new and he looks new. So when a man or a woman or a young person meets God and he said another place that you'll never be the same once you have become an associate I like that an associate of Jesus Christ you'll never be the same. I pray God that that will be our portion and that is why we're preaching the things that we are preaching so that you will have a lifechanging experience. Now the scripture which we have read in verse 37 of of the 8th chapter of Romans. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. Now the the subject of conquering uh it's uh it occurs many times. It's the word is used to o to overcome or to conquer. It's used in the scripture uh many times and it has the same the same meaning but in the last time that it appears in the Bible it says he that overcomemeth that's the last time this Greek word appears in the Bible he that overcomemeth shall inherit all things and I will be his god and he shall be my son the first seal opened up. And the first seal said, "And I," this was Roman, uh, Revelation 6. "And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown." Brother Brandham makes note, a bow, but no arrows. He said it's a he's a bluff. &gt;&gt; And a crown was given unto him. He didn't have a crown, but a crown was given unto him. and he went forth conquering and a conqueror. Now, just having read those three scriptures, it is clearly evident that whatever takes place on the face of the earth, there's going to be a group of people that are going to be more powerful than this fellow who rode out conquering. &gt;&gt; And he does conquer and to conquer. That is his objective. He is antichrist. He's anti-word. He's in opposition to all that is godly and righteousness. He's in opposition to God. He is none other than Lucifer who was cast out of Satan. Cast out of heaven. The first the first war that ever took place was in heaven. And I want to touch on that as we move through. Not where God dwells. Because it was Lucifer who said, "I will ascend." He never got there. He wanted to, but he never got there. And he was cast out. But his purpose, his whole ambition is to conquer. And you don't have to go very far today as you walk around in your place of work or school or wherever and you'll find out that he has succeeded in conquering the minds and the lives of multitudes of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet said this was Satan, Superman. And I want you to listen very carefully because I have some things are really heavy on my heart and I want your full attention. He said this is the Satan superman with education with wisdom with church theology of his own word of his own making and he rides his white denominational horse to deceive the people. That's his purpose. That's his intent is for deception. In the first seal, he went on to say, "And the writer has no name, but Christ is called the word of God." This guy isn't called anything, but he's on a white horse. Because the scripture also speaks of Christ coming on a white horse. That is a power. White uh a a a horse in the scriptures always a power. And the rider has no arrows for his bow. He had a bow, but there's nothing said about him having any arrows. So he must be a bluffer. And this guy can't smite nothing. But he's playing the part of a hypocrite. He's going forth riding on a white horse going out to conquer. Now the word I just want to give it to you the so that you'll get the whole context of this. He going out to conquer and to conquer. But the scripture has said that you are more than conquerors. And I I I've it's going to be wonderful. We are more than conquerors. I just throw it out to you just a a moment for your to think about while we're moving through this subject. If you had an enemy and you conquered him, he's already conquered and you already have victory. What is the purpose of being more than a conqueror? I leave you with the question. To conquer is to prevail. To get the victory. Oh, these are all lovely. To carry off the victory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To hold fast to the faith at all cost even to death to have victory because even the believer all the martyrs they went down in death but they actually had victory in death. Look at Jesus Christ. His greatest victory wasn't when he cast out a thousand demons out of the maniac of the gatherines. That wasn't his greatest victory. His greatest victory wasn't doing as the scripture said and he healed all of them. That wasn't his greatest victory. Or turning the water into wine or the loaves and the fishes. That wasn't his victory. Feeding 5,000. That wasn't his greatest victory. but on the cross. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Giving his last breath &gt;&gt; and saying, "Father, forgive them. &gt;&gt; They don't know what they do." And he he gave up, the scripture says, he gave up he gave up the holy he gave up his spirit, the his and died the death. That was his greatest victory. &gt;&gt; Then he rose &gt;&gt; from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we are not uh unacquainted with the phrase and perhaps you have used the phrase life is a struggle. Life is a struggle and I think we all have experienced it and the scripture tells us that we do wrestle against the powers of darkness and wickedness in high places as every believer. If you don't have a struggle, I'm not talking about just life's struggles living in life, but if you don't have a spiritual conflict going on, then then I would do some checking up because if you are if you're having a spiritual struggle, we do wrestle, not part-time, it's a full-time job. We wrestle against this powers of darkness and wickedness in high places. And the wrestling is a contest between two in which each endeavors to throw the other and which is decided when the victor is able to hold his opponent down with his hand upon his neck. And so in this struggle, even one of the words is like to vibrate because if you've seen those that wrestle are trying to throw their opponent down and it's going this way and that way in a movement, all these different movements and finally one gets the other offbalance. I can tell you as I thought on this and study this earnestly that and prayerfully this week, I can see in my own experience, my own lifetime, those that I've sought to counsel and maybe young people or families or whatever more. And you can see Satan buffeting them. You've heard the word buffeting them. And the scripture tells us that the Apostle Paul, a messenger from Satan, had come to buffet him. Well, that buffeting is to cause someone to shake. And if Satan can continue to buffet a person, if he gets them off balance, and often often it's too late for that person to regain their balance because they've been pressed too far off off their off of their spiritual balance. He said, "We look at the world and its corrupted state." Just having a look at the world this morning and its corrupted state to gain some appreciation of what we have been saved from and the keeping power of God that has been released and sent to us as believers causing us to be conquerors. I'm talking to this audience today because conquering is more than attending this church. &gt;&gt; Conquering is more than just a certain code of dress. &gt;&gt; Conquering is more than just having a certain kind of phraseology that is that is understood and accepted by my neighbors and my peers and those I go to church with. That's not the conquering I'm talking about. I'm talking about a conquering that is conquering the evil and the darkness and the temptation of the world because every person undergoes those kind of tests and to have conquering power over that and yet that's not being more than a conqueror that is conquering &gt;&gt; and we're interested in that. I gave some deep deep thought, prayerful thought to the permeating effect of evil that's in the world. It's troubling, &gt;&gt; but it's so pervading, &gt;&gt; so permeating, invading &gt;&gt; the minds. And and and I can tell you, Satan, he's so brazen. If he would come before Jesus Christ, the very son of God, and come right to him and say, "If you be the son of God," let me tell you this morning, he's not afraid of any one of us, &gt;&gt; he'll come to you at any time. He doesn't care whether you're tired. He doesn't care whether you're busy. He doesn't care whether you're rich or whether you're poor. He doesn't care whether you're healthy or whether you're sick. He doesn't care what your status of life is. He is on the job and he and 24 hours a day he intends to invade every area of your life, your home, your work, your place, your mind to try to throw you off balance. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; We're in a wrestling match. &gt;&gt; And God has given us, now this is not just some mental thing. It's got to be reality. God has given and made available to the believers, to his children. He's made available to them a power that can conquer that enemy. &gt;&gt; And make you more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; And the more I'll just drop this in. The more than a conqueror is because Satan, our warfare with him is at different levels. It might be physical in sickness. It can be emotional in that whole realm. Do you know some people war with their memories? &gt;&gt; Some people have very very very terrible memories in their life. They're not pleasant. In fact, they're they're very distressing and and and many people have that. Some uh have perhaps relationships that they're struggling with. They may have ambitions that and opportunities being presented to them. And Satan is per permeating every one of those. He's worked through this opportunity. He works through this promotion. He works through this relationship. Works through this uh uh peers, your friends. He's working in every area that he possibly can to entice, to coax, to enchant, to get the people and and he knows that, oh, it might look so wonderful, but he's getting them off balance. &gt;&gt; And he wants to get them so far off balance that they can't recover. &gt;&gt; They can't get their stand again. And to say, well, uh, what what is our, uh, what is our remedy? God has given us a remedy and it is as we hear the word of God as we surrender to it then then that overcomes that we get our balance back &gt;&gt; and then there's another aspect and this is where more than the conqueror comes in and I'll just sew it now even though it's very early in the service to conquer we conquer these things that are on the exterior we got a difficulty with our job. We got a difficulty with a person. We got a difficulty in our home. We got a financial difficulty. We got a physical difficulty. And and and somehow we're able to grasp a hold of the word and the promise and overcome and have victory in this exterior part of our lives. &gt;&gt; But then we still have another area &gt;&gt; and it is the greater victory. It is where we are more than a conqueror when we can conquer our own selves. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said his greatest his greatest battle, his greatest enemy was William Brham. &gt;&gt; Your greatest problem is not somebody sitting near you, &gt;&gt; but it's within your own self. And for a person to be able to conquer, &gt;&gt; their own ambition, their own desire, their own whatever it might be within themselves, able to conquer and wrestle it down and cause it to be surrendered to the will of God. And that's why Jesus, I tell you, there's no place where it says that he that he sweat as it were great drops of blood, but one place he did, Gethsemane, it's where his spirit and his will, he didn't want to die. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to go through the agony. He didn't want to go through, he wasn't saying, "Oh, glory. I'm going to be I'm going to be marred more than the visage of any man. my visage will be marred more. He become unrecognizable. This isn't something that he was gloating in. It was something he was trying to escape. &gt;&gt; But he went to and as a prophet and I love it. You never hear it any other place. He went to Gethsemane alone &gt;&gt; where the spirit left him and he went from there to the cross as a man like you &gt;&gt; and like me &gt;&gt; with the weight of the sin and the darkness of man's unbelief and the world unbelief on his shoulders. Tell you what, friends, that's where the the inner self was laid down and surrendered to the plan and will of God. Satan throws some into a bed of ease. Fleshly pleasure, they get taken up with it. There's people today that are probably professing to be believers of this message that are at home watching some sports event rather than than I won't say here in church, but in a church in a believer's church. I've talked to people that have been absolutely bound, literally bound, and I will say probably possessed with a sports devil, if there is such a thing. &gt;&gt; But they're sure demons of pleasure. &gt;&gt; I've talked to people. I prayed for them. They're absolutely bound. They have to see. They can tell you. They can tell you every sports star in in their particular field. Some of it was the NBA and others it is in the football and others it's in the hockey and others it's in something else and absolutely consumed with it. I will say Satan has got them teetering way off &gt;&gt; and if they continue to teeter one day they'll wake up and they will have fallen. Oh my. &gt;&gt; There's a whole array of things. Some of you that are sitting here, I'm getting right down to your address. &gt;&gt; And you can say amen or say ouch, whatever you want to say. But some of you have friends. And a friend, a real friend must be someone that thrust you more Godward, &gt;&gt; that you can fellowship with at a spiritual level. &gt;&gt; And when you left them, you're stronger. &gt;&gt; You are more strengthened. &gt;&gt; If you have a friend so-called, and when you leave, you feel a dark cloud. You feel a heaviness. You feel as though you have not been really encouraged forward in a Godword manner. I would limit that kind of friendship. I'd put real strict boundaries on it. &gt;&gt; Say, "How are you? How are you doing today?" Fine. You know, I'm on my way. People say, "Well, I have friends and we got to go over and do a certain certain thing." And why don't you tell them I'm on my way to a prayer meeting and see how long the friendship lasts &gt;&gt; or I'm on my way to church. &gt;&gt; Others he throws in a place where they become consumed with the lure of wealth or a multitude of other good causes. And there's nothing wrong with say, you know, people serve on hospital committees, people serve for the Red Cross, people do their with the care agencies or whatever more or social agencies. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's good. I would think that that person is doing a lot of good for the community. But on the other hand, to have a life consumed with that and yet no real spiritual walk with God, I would say that the one is displacing the other. &gt;&gt; And in that it can be very very dangerous. You know, it's not the drunk or the street or the or the prostitute in the red light district. That's not what I'm talking about. Those people aren't going to be surprised with their with their uh conclusion at the end because they know They know where they are. They know who they are. They know what they are. They're not trying to put on any pretense, but it's people that are taken up and and and and faithful in a service and faithful in a church and perhaps there this morning and giving their best and giving of their resources and their finances and of their time and everything else. and then to wake up and find out that they were consumed with something that did not really bring them into a personal a personal revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that revelation of Jesus Christ is the only purpose I'm here. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the first great battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels. It first started and the first battle was in heaven. As I said, in heaven, but not in God's dwelling place. We hear of modern wear warfare. And we have no knowledge of the kind of weaponry that was used in this fierce struggle that ensued in heaven. We have no knowledge of it. The battle took place in a region that God permitted it to take place in the fourth seal. He said, "What is all what is this all coming to?" Said, "It's going back the way that it did. It started in heaven. It's coming to the end time." The end time battle. You know, here we are. We're in 206. We're soon coming to the end of this year. And I'm not a young man anymore, but I'm going to make some suggestions to you that may start your thoughts in a little different direction. &gt;&gt; People and a many, especially in the message as itself, I find that many people are waiting for some great destruction to come. And it may well be that way. But I'm suggesting to you today that the great destruction may all may already be here. &gt;&gt; I was thinking just in the last few hours and I want to sing if the Lord allows us at the end of the service. I want to sing, "Oh my loving brother, when the world's on fire, don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? I'd like to suggest, you know, they're waiting. Brother Brandon said he saw America just smoldering tree stumps. I don't want to be dramatical, but I suggest to you that that's already the case. &gt;&gt; Trees being humans. &gt;&gt; I have some statistics here from the National Health Council of America. I have it right here. I'll be reading it and I'll be putting some on the screen, but just to get your mind where mine is this morning. The statistics for United States is one in every four people have a mental disorder, have mental illness that is it it's ill to the point they can actually diagnose it and identify it. There are and what they're saying is there are those that cannot be identified and they're not counting that but that which can be identified and they have a variety of them different areas of mental illness. Mental illness a prophet 25 30 40 years ago said the time will come when there'll be imbalanced and neurotics filling the streets. The statistics I have here today say one in every four persons in the United States for a total of 57.7 million of America is mentally ill and you get out of this church this morning and walk and Canada is absolutely no different and you can walk down the street and say one two three four one two three four one two three four. I hope you can't sit in the church and say 1 2 3 4. &gt;&gt; 1 2 3 4 mentally ill. &gt;&gt; And the Malachi 4 speaks of the earth being burnt like an oven. From God's perspective and where he's looking, I can tell you the nation is smoldering stumps. People whose minds and whose lives have been reduced, they don't think they're capt. They don't maybe feel that way, but they have every kind of of crutch. They talk about religion being a crutch. What about all their drugs? What about all their pleasure? What about all the, you know, this mental exotic uh uh educational thing that's consumed people and they'll give up their families and give up their children? What about all this business that give up families, give up children, destroy homes? You know what I call it? A smoldering stump. Amen. &gt;&gt; The leaves of fellowship have been burned off. &gt;&gt; The joy has gone. They're being hyped on. Something is they have to be ppped up. Maybe not a a pill, maybe not a pill, maybe not a prescription, but something to entice them, to keep them moving, to keep them going forward, and to motivate them. and energize them. I think there's a great battle going on, &gt;&gt; a great struggle going on and there's there's only one there's only one remedy that I know &gt;&gt; that is a message that has come and pulled the covers off of him, exposed him, exposed his methods, exposed everything about him so that there is a people who by virtue of the message have the eyes of Christ can look straight through and say, "You're not bluffing me. You might bluff a lot of people, but you're not bluffing me. I can actually see you. I see your tactics. I know your work. That's been right from the beginning, and it doesn't move me. You can't buffet me with that stuff. &gt;&gt; I'm going to just show you some slides and then we'll move forward. All right. Excuse me. Well, the brothers told me there's going to be an arrow here, but there is no arrow. All right. Thank you. Isn't this technology wonderful? So, we can perhaps dim the lights a little bit. Now we have received not the spirit of the world. That should be that first statement should be something that we feel good about. We have not received the spirit of the world. There is a spirit of the world and we have not received the spirit of the world. &gt;&gt; But the spirit which is of God. Why? That we might know the things that are freely given us of God. Why? Why? Why do we need to know the things that are freely given us of God? So that we will not be affected or afflicted by the spirit that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But you know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. where in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience. Listen friends, the environment that you and I are in every day, the environment that you are in contact with is an environment where the spirit that now workketh now workketh in the children of disobedience. Revelation 12 and 11. And you'll you'll recall this from the last couple services. And they I hope you can say and I overcame him &gt;&gt; by the blood of the lamb &gt;&gt; and by the word of my testimony &gt;&gt; and I love not my life unto the death. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's total surrendering. &gt;&gt; Christians, brother Brandham says, are influenced from above. The Holy Ghost influences his church in this in this realm of mortal. The devil by these spirits influence man. Man, the next is angels and the next is God. Now, he said every mortal here is influenced by one of these two worlds. I'd like this congregation to uh in unison repeat that last line. Every mortal here is influenced by one of these two worlds. And I trust you can say from the very depths of your heart, I am influenced from the realm of a heaven from eternal realm. I'm influenced by a holy realm. &gt;&gt; I'm influenced by the Holy Spirit and I'm under that influence today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The devil doesn't want you to rejoice in that. You need to rejoice in that. You need to say, "Hallelujah. I'm influenced by the Holy Spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Not just something in your mind, but a reality." And that influence changes my life. I have a life transforming power within me. And I feel it. I sense it. It happens in reality. &gt;&gt; It corrects me before I even make a wrong decision. Do you have that? Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You prayed and you felt moved to do one thing rather than another. You were going to do something and you felt a check. That was him. Oh, thank you, Lord. We have the spirit not that's in the world, but we have the spirit that is of God. You felt discouraged. You wanted to give up, but there was something inside of you that urged you on. Thank God for that spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every mortal, every mortal, mortals are influenced from an outside world. I should understand by the grace of God, I deal with spirits. Those of you familiar with brother Brandham's ministry, he was in that realm almost all the time. He said, "I should know what I'm speaking of." &gt;&gt; And I look along through this dark mass of ga. Every once in a while you'll see a little light burning. Lights a burning. That's Christians in the darkness giving light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You walk down the street in this dark mass of gaity and you'll see a little flicker, &gt;&gt; another little flicker. Have you been in a mall lately and on down you see a flicker and you know it's not the rest of the world. They're entirely different. They're like someone from another planet. They are. They came from God and they'll go back to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're from another place. &gt;&gt; We're not at home. &gt;&gt; We don't feel at home. &gt;&gt; We feel unwelcome. &gt;&gt; As Marilyn's song goes, &gt;&gt; I feel unwelcome. Not welcome &gt;&gt; in this cold atmosphere. And I don't try to warm up to it. The sinner is influenced by a spirit because he is a he has a spirit and the wrong gives influence and the right gives influence and those who are uh dominated with blackness and separation are dominated from the underworld of devils. This age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods. These are some selected statements out of the church ages now. &gt;&gt; And this 40 years ago was like it was written this morning. &gt;&gt; And then I will go just into what the government has said. Here's a prophet's quote and then the government's quote. This age boasts of its tremendous stores of worldly goods, but the people are less happy than ever. This age boasts of its spiritual attainments, but the people are less sure of themselves than ever. This age boasts of better moral values, and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood. It talks about its knowledge and science, but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields. For the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep a breast with all the changes that have come upon the earth. In one generation, we've gone all the way from the horse and buggy age to the space age. And we are proud and boastful about it. But inside is a dark void cavern that is crying out in torment. Without a known reason, men's hearts are failing for fear. And the world is so darkened that this age could well be called the age of neurotics. It boasts but it cannot back it up. It cries peace and there is no peace. It cries that it has a greater amplitude of all things but it keeps burning with desire like an unsatisfied fire. There is no peace, sayith my God, to the wicked. Mental disorders are coming in the United States and internationally. And here's the government statistics. An estimated 26.2% of Americans aged 18 and older, about one in four adults suffer from a diagnosible mental disorder in a given year. When applied to the 204 US census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older, this figure translates to 57.7 million people. This is the National Institute of Mental Health. 57. You might say, "Well, brother Biscll, are you trying to startle us?" No, I think we need to be awakened. that happens to be more people than we have in this country called Canada. That's almost double our entire population. And when you've had a prophet say, "We boast of this, but inwardly we're that. &gt;&gt; We've got all this spirituality and all this, you know, attainment." And you think that it isn't the evangelistic in evangelism and fundamental evangelism and and politics have become so homogenized. In fact is as of this last week they said that Hollywood is just having a whole awakening that they they they feel that they must make movies that are religious movies spiritual movies. They've got a whole movement called, you know, Hollywood stars that are born again and you can get their names and it's becoming just totally homogenized with the whole the whole spiritual uh television evangelism etc. this last two weeks before the elections uh the Senate and the House of Representatives elections here the whole country they're so they're so on edge and one of the leading pastor 14,000 people and you are well aware of it I'm not here just to bring these things to the service that happen to be reality &gt;&gt; and living an unclean life with another homosexual and buying drugs, adamophines, and then the government gets worried because this may taint the election and have a negative effect on election. I'm not spending my time on these things. I just say that's the spirit of the world. And I don't care what label. They can call it Calvary this. They can call it redemption that. They can call it Holy Ghost this or whatever more. It's corrupt &gt;&gt; to the core. &gt;&gt; A Catholic nun has just been sentenced to 30 years in prison for her direct participation in the genocide that took place in Rwanda, neighboring Congo, where many of our people come from, and actually had people reserved and and turned them loose to the people that were going to destroy them. And before her is two other nuns and another priest. They've all they're already in prison. People who trusted their lives have trusted their souls. You know what, friends? We're in another world. &gt;&gt; As believers, we're in another world. &gt;&gt; In all truth, they don't even belong here. &gt;&gt; We're not at home. &gt;&gt; This world's not my home. &gt;&gt; And it's not going to get better. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to burn, as the prophet Malachi says, as a fire. &gt;&gt; And it'll be nothing but ashes under the feet of the righteous. &gt;&gt; And it is today. It's not going to be those are ashes. I see the things already burned. There's lives everywhere. Lives everywhere. Oh, they look physically better than I do. They may they may uh be prettier. They may be more handsome. They may be more educated. They may be more whatever. They may be more wealthy. They may be more who who knows what. And they can speak and meet you. But inside, &gt;&gt; it's a dark void. Inside there's no flickering light inside. There's no pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Don't sit here and put on as though you you don't know any of these things. You're in touch with it all the time. This happens to be the reality. And we have a prophet's voice that has already declared thus sayith the Lord. The whole thing, the whole church movement is going back under the federation of churches. Whether you know it or whether you see it or not, it's already been spoken. And thus it shall be. &gt;&gt; It'll all be tied together in one great big movement, one great big massive political and religious. &gt;&gt; And it's designed by devils. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he who wrote out on the white horse is he who accomplished it because the scripture says all whose names are not in the book will actually worship him. &gt;&gt; They're not going to come to some image and bow down to an image. They're going to give obesence to him because he permeates. He came into the college. He came into the university. He came into the business. He came into the store. He came into the fashion industry. He came into the sports. He came into all kinds of things that were not evil in themselves, but he made them evil &gt;&gt; because he threw the people off balance. &gt;&gt; Good people. &gt;&gt; People who wanted God. &gt;&gt; What do you think about the people the masses that heard the Lord Jesus or the masses that came to the prophet's ministry? What do you what do you think about the people in the masses that came to the Lord Jesus and heard him? And the Bible says they marveled at the gracious words that came from his lips. But where were those people that marveled at the gracious words when they were when they were taking him to the cross? And the crowds, the same crowd said, "Crucify, crucify, crucify him." &gt;&gt; Because it never struck the soul. They were gone this way and then they're gone that way and then they're buffeted this way and buffeted. They got this idea then they got they they're into that inspiration into this thought. The stuff that takes place in churches today is just absolutely it's bizarre. You know, come and start with your coffee. They wanted us to right where the stairs go up to the balcony there. They wanted us to have a like a Starbucks in there. when we designed the church and one of the people who were designing the church said, "Yours is the only church I'm doing three. I'm doing three churches and yours is the only church that's not a gymnasium. The first thought is not a place to worship. The first thought is a place of sports. Right. &gt;&gt; Where is the where is the uh uh you know where's the basketball hoop going to be on this end? Where's it going to be? Where's the marks in the floor going to be and where all these things? Then we'll work the church and the worship around that burning stumps &gt;&gt; might be religious but it's burning stumps. And when a prophet, he said, you know, I've talked to people and they're kind of anxious that America will fall and be destroyed. They'll say, "When do you think it's going to be just burning stumps?" I just saw it smoldering. When do you think it's going to be? Cuz our mind is on some big atomic, you know, horrific thing. What's happening right now is worse than any atomic thing that can happen. Because men are and men and women both. They're dead while they still live. &gt;&gt; There's no hope. &gt;&gt; And I'm preaching this not to give you a dark picture of what's out there. But you might as well realize it. That is what's out there. And that should give you more thanks, more thanksgiving of what it is you possess. We have not the spirit of the world, &gt;&gt; but we have another spirit that came from God and now is making known a word, revealing a word to you that makes a people not conquerors but more than conquerors. I hope I can get to it. Give me a few more minutes if you will please. Research suggests that mental illnesses are the result of a complex interaction of gen genetic, biological, personality and environmental factors. However, the brain is the final common pathway for the control of behavior, cognition, mood, and anxiety. And if you want to read brother Brandham's message, and you ought to, when you leave here, greatest battle ever fought, he said, "For every battle, there has to be a place chosen &gt;&gt; by the opponents &gt;&gt; for this battle to take place. &gt;&gt; And there was a ground." He said, "It's called a no man's ground." and and between God, Michael and his angels fought with Lucifer and his angels. And they Lucifer was cast out of that level, that region, cast out to the earth. And he's here, &gt;&gt; absolutely here. &gt;&gt; There anybody who would deny that that Lucifer hasn't been cast down to the earth is themselves insane. &gt;&gt; He's here. You see it everywhere. &gt;&gt; Absolutely everywhere. And there had to be a place chosen. So there was a place chosen. They said it was the human mind. Brother Brandham says the human mind. The national statistic health of United States says there one pathway was the mind and that's where it is and he gains entrance into that mind. And they said the pathway, it's the final common pathway for what? The control behavior. You have a message. I'm bringing it to you this morning. We have a message. We have a prophet who uncovered him, &gt;&gt; uncovered his tactics, uncovered everything about him, exposed him, and says, "Here's how he moves. &gt;&gt; The battle's in your mind." And he went further than that. He says that's not the control tower for the believer. The control tower for the believer is in the soul. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. I'm going to preach straight and preach hard. We have good music, but it doesn't reach the soul. We have good singing, but it's not made for the soul. We have we have the Bible and the Bible and don't get me wrong now just reading the Bible doesn't necessarily go to the soul but the revelation of the Bible spoken by God &gt;&gt; is made for the soul and then the soul becomes the control tower &gt;&gt; and he says the the control tower in the soul it moves up through the five senses of the spirit which is memory, &gt;&gt; imagination, &gt;&gt; conscience, affection, and reasoning. And four of those five are all in the mind. &gt;&gt; And he says from the soul who's received the word of God, it goes up through those channels and takes control of your emotional realm. &gt;&gt; And then the emotional realm moves up through the five channels of the body. You're seeing, you're hearing, you're smelling, you're feeling in those five channels and takes control of them. Then &gt;&gt; the man has become more than a conqueror. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We're not interested just conquering, you know, our little physical ailments or little things that bother us from day to day in work and whatever more. That's not what we're interested in conquering. We're interested in getting that revealed word down into the soul so it rises up and takes control of the spirit &gt;&gt; and then up and controls the body. &gt;&gt; And now you have become more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. At this time, the links between specific brain dysfunction and specific mental illnesses are not fully understood. Excuse me. &gt;&gt; We've been on the road a long time. Excuse me. We got a lot of very intellectual bis people and we have a lot of very sophisticated equipment, measurement equipment, but it's not completely known. And I'll say with what what they have in this world, it'll never be completely known. But God &gt;&gt; who knew and knows you and knows every part of you. He knows how your mind works. He knows how your spirit and your your your inner being works. He knows how all the emotions work. He's given us a remedy. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Don't be too stiff and formal. I'm going to start dancing up here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so full of joy today. So thankful that before I was even born, God planned a message that would cope with this generation. And he says, "The end time message, the end time message has the answer to the end time problems and the end time conditions." We have the answer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have the answer. You have the answer. &gt;&gt; You have the answer, friends. &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching here to make you enthused, but I hope you do get enthused. I hope you get beside yourself. Just imagine if somebody here had just won, you know, some great prize or something. We'd all rejoice with them. &gt;&gt; Well, we've won the prize. &gt;&gt; We've already got the prize. We've won the prize, friends. We've got the word that comes to the soul of the individual. The soul, the word that'll control every part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we what we want to be? &gt;&gt; No, brother Ed, are you what you want to be? No. No. I'm still on my way. But I can tell you one thing. If this message hadn't come our way or my way, my home wouldn't be what it is. My family wouldn't be what it is. This church wouldn't be what it is unless the word had come your way. You where would you be? Where would your life be? You certainly wouldn't be here. Where would you be, Brother Michael? You'd still be beating your drums in the rock band. &gt;&gt; You might already be in a grave. Who knows? We certainly wouldn't be here. But here we are loving this righteousness, loving this holiness. Here we are rejoicing at this word. Oh my prophet said, "If if if I'm out of my mind, leave me this way." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think we're at the end here. Yes. even shut it off. All I can say to you friends is that there's coming an hour. I wasn't thinking what to say. I was thinking how to say it. There's coming an hour. And if all these other things have been prophesied and they if they've come right on quue, then this other will also and brother Brandham goes and I won't take the quote. We'll start this another service in the next service. He goes to the place second Corinthians I believe, I'm sorry, 2 Thessalonians 2. And maybe I'll just read it for you so you can go home with it. 2 Thessalonians 2 and I'll close with this verse 7. For the mystery of iniquity doth already workmen was already happening when Paul wrote this. The mystery of iniquity doth already work. Only he who now letth will let. And he who letth, he said, is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That is he who letth will now let will let until he be taken out of the way. And then &gt;&gt; shall that wicked be revealed. &gt;&gt; In other words, he'll be made known. &gt;&gt; He'll be he'll be so exposed everybody will know it. Then the wicked will be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, which is his word. And I can tell you, he's being consumed right now. He's being defeated right now. As you believe the word that comes to you, Satan is being defeated. &gt;&gt; And he's he's being rendered helpless. &gt;&gt; I would like everybody in the whole congregation to at least believe that with all your heart. He's being rendered helpless. &gt;&gt; You have the tool. You have you have been equipped. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. [Music] &gt;&gt; And he says when he who now letth be taken out of the way, brother Raptize that to the church going home, the bride going home. you will go when he who's allowing and permitting. I expect that many of you I trust also that I will live for that time. But you will see a time. Look at look at the scene. I described it a wee bit today. I spent quite a bit of time describing. You might think that was a very negative service for brother for brother Biscll to preach. No, it's a very real service. Those those conditions are real. Now, I want I'm going to take it a step further with you. Everything I've described and I couldn't even scratch the surface. We should have our staff sergeant, Brother Sean Maloney, stand to maybe deal with just last week and every week. and I don't think I'll be out of place. He says, "Right here, just in an area of this city, there's several stabbings, shootings, several bank robberies happening every week that they have to deal with." Now, these things are happening with even the restraining force of him who's still letting. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he who letth &gt;&gt; be taken out of the way, &gt;&gt; you know what? You will have 100% hell. &gt;&gt; Hell on earth. &gt;&gt; And he who's been cast down. He wanted to ascend and he has ascended thus far into the earth until the language of the people is just unbelievable and indescribable and cannot be repeated. And if their language is that what about their thoughts? My neighbor supposed to be a they're wealthy. Big rock star live in a mansion. Big mansion. His wife curse my wife out. Imagine my wife. Who could be more timid? who could be more, you know, just kind, she hadn't got a got a mean streak in her body &gt;&gt; and have, you know, a woman. Of course, little later they once they came over and brought a bouquet of flowers, but that was because they wanted to have a movie. They sorted they they uh had decided on using their home for a movie which was just shot here last year and they were they they want to let us know that the lights are going to be blazing all night all night till 7 in the morning and so on and so forth. It was fine. There was there was no noise. There was no problem for us. But then for for that, you know, they wanted to bring over a nice bouquet of flowers. When I saw the flowers, I said, 'Well, something's happening. You know, I don't know what's happening. Oh, she says they're shooting a movie over there, so that's it. Now we know what it's all about. But but but you know, there's no cause, there's no nothing. You say, if that comes out of a person's mouth, what's in their mind? &gt;&gt; What's in their heart? &gt;&gt; And you know what it is? Ashes. Malachi's prophecy and the messenger of Malachi here come told us gone. &gt;&gt; Tell you what friends, my closing comment just now to this congregation. There will be a moment when he who's still led will be taken out of the way. the Holy Spirit of God. What you see and what you're in contact with that is existing with with even under the restraint &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit of God. But when he is taken out of the way, what will you have? I'll say to this congregation, oh God may go down into eternity, you do not want to be here. &gt;&gt; You want to be gone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is my stern, solemn counsel to you today. Let not a man or woman or young person or child be caught here when he who now letth will let until until he be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; I'd like the musicians to come, please. I want you to think soberly, not as a song. Oh my loving brother, when the world's on fire, I changed that a wee bit. Oh my loving brother, the world is on fire. &gt;&gt; Don't you want God's bosom to be your pillow? Oh, hide me over in the rock of ages. Rock of aes cleft for me. Oh my loving brother and sister. When the world's on fire, don't you want God's boo to be your pillar? Hide me over in the rock of aes [Music] rock of aes [Music] and that rock of revelation is the rock of ages. you maybe need to say this morning. [Music] If you're sitting here and you're saying, you know, I didn't quite understand it all, but there's a sobriety. There's a seriousness that has come upon me. Surrender to that. That's him. That's he who's still letting he's allowing all these things to take place. and you're going to be in contact with it tomorrow and maybe yet today. You may go to a restaurant, you'll hear the booming. Young ladies walking around exposing their bodies to good serious believers can't even go to those places anymore. Isn't that a tragedy? Isn't that a tragedy? Appealing to offbalance somebody. Oh, what a time we're living in. if they only knew and they haven't heard maybe what you've heard this morning. I say to you in the name of the Lord, you do not want to be here &gt;&gt; when he is lifted from the earth. And quite frankly, it seems to me that he is lifting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The restraints have been let go. There are no bars held. How else do you How else do you interpret? How can you even begin to determine what is taking place? I don't know. I don't even know how to say it. But Satan is making more access and more access Brother Brandham said the people were saved from movies so they would not think of going to a theater. said, "The devil pulled one over to you and brought it into your home by way of television." And sitting there, a leader of the of the government of the United States stood up and I heard or read his his article or heard him, I can't remember just now. And he said, "For us to believe, for us as leaders to believe that we can subject our young people." And he began to name it off to how many thousand murders and how many thousand adulteries and how many thousand divorces and broken homes and all of this violence. He said to believe that we can expose them to that and have them mentally healthy is to believe that we send healthy people into contaminated physically contaminated with all kinds of virus and sickness and disease and have them go in there and come out healthy. &gt;&gt; Does that take a smart person? Can anybody figure that out? We can figure that out. Our great leaders can't figure that out. &gt;&gt; They can, but it's money. It's the wealth. It's the taxes. It's the pressure. It's all the rest of it. This world is designed for the burning friends. &gt;&gt; And it will. And he that letth will let until he be taken out of the way. &gt;&gt; And when he's taken out of the way, my precious friends, those that I've journeyed with for a long time, I do not feel worthy, but I want to go also. I want to be out of here when it's when it's left this way. I thank God for this glorious message that we have. Let's stand. We'll sing the first verse, please. Oh, the judgement days coming. I am [Music] Christ forever is my foreign [Music] [Applause] Fire [Music] [Music] [Music] for Listen to the words in these next two verses. and the sound [Music] and I might [Music] be Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Es for me. [Music] I'll sing it. Poor lost sinners [Music] will be crying for the home they'll never see but they're ransomed. They will be singing. Oh rock of aes [Music] cleft for me. Oh my loving brother. Sing it with me. When the world's on fire, you are God's mighty [Music] God [Music] for me. &gt;&gt; You know, we have quite a few people in this church, but I've got to ask you to take these things so seriously that you don't lose yourself in the crowd just because you're one of a big group of people. Don't lose yourself. You are an individual before God. And I was giving so much thought to this, I got thinking about the the rich man. I don't know how rich he was, but he had Lazarus begging at his gate. And we we had it at the at the at the family camp, but it was all fresh to me again. I have him here in my notes. I thought, how much awareness is there after this? He who letth will let until he be taken out of the way. How much awareness is this after a person departs and comes into a place? And this is what he said. He remembered he had five brethren. I got five brethren. I got five brothers. He says, "And they're all still at my father's home. They're in my father's home." And he knew the answer was I need somebody to go to them. And if I can't go back, please send Lazarus. Send him back and let him go and tell my brothers. So he said, "So they won't have to come to this place of torment." He had his full mental capacity. &gt;&gt; He knew the answer. He knew what he had missed. He knew where he had missed it. And he knew who had the answer. Send Lazarus back. And all of that consciousness, all that awareness came back to him. But it was too late. It's late. Jesus did not tell that to tell some little mystical story. He told her because it was absolute truth. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, "My brother, my sister, take this message more serious after today than you've ever taken it. Set your life in a certain direction so this becomes your daily diet. Feed upon this word. Feed upon this message. Hear it. I say hear it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're here and God's dealing with you. I wouldn't dare close this service and just dismiss you and tell you to shake hands and go home when you know perhaps in your own self. This is my time and God's dealing with me and I'm determined I'm not going to miss it. I may be played around a wee bit, but I determined I got to be serious with this. I want you to do it today. [Music] We'll sing the last verse. who are lost sinners. [Music] They will be crying for the world. &gt;&gt; Evercy was a wonderful place he went to prepare. under [Music] Christ for me. [Music] Oh my brother, [Music] our fire [Music] to the higher [Music] of the rock of for me. &gt;&gt; I've done my part, people. And now there's two others that will do their part. One is the Holy Spirit and the other one is you. Whatever he's saying to you, don't deny him. Don't deny this lovely Lord Jesus. Give yourself to him. so completely, so unreservedly. You may want to kneel and pray. You may want to come forward and pray. You may want to give your life to Christ if you have not already done so. If you've been here in the church and you've grown up here and it's just been kind of a put on and you've just but it hasn't been real to you inside. [Music] Why don't you surrender to him now? Your altar is the heart or your heart is the altar. You can raise your hand. Do whatever you think you should do. But at this time it's between you and him. And I'm going to pray for you. Everyone who wishes to become a part of this prayer say, "Oh God, I want to be identified with this prayer. Father, throughout this week, as I was so moved, as I pondered these things deep within me and seeking to break through the tradition of what the what we've been taught or what we've learned to believe to really hear exactly what your prophet messenger has said and what the word of God declares and much of it, Lord, is difficult. ult perhaps to understand clearly but the time comes the season arrives and one thing we do know oh God we know that you have been present with us in the service today that you have reached out and you have sent your spirit you've dispensed him and he's touching the lives and speaking and his voice is heard and it's being very clear Lord and you're calling some Say, "Come to me. Come to me with all your heart. I'm calling for your heart. I'm calling for you to come and follow me. Follow me and I'll make you pissards of men." Lord, I thought so much about your footsteps, those blood stained footsteps, and desiring to be a true disciple, Lord, and have everything that would be hindering removed out of the way. I pray that well, I prayed for myself. I pray for everyone that is here under the sound of my voice and those that may be in other countries around the world, Lord, and streaming at this moment. Step into that room. Step into that building where they're gathered. Step in, I pray, further than the building, but into their very hearts, into their lives, into every soul here, oh God. Not just in the mind, and not just in the ears and not just in their emotional realm, but down into the soul. Reach down there, oh God. I cannot do it, but you can do it. I pray that you will change lives, transform them by transforming power, and may this service be a preparation for the next one to come. Oh Lord, take this church as I heard our brother Nathaniel pray for a revival. I pray you'll move it in a mighty sweep of the Holy Spirit of God. We love you. We love your message. We love the way you speak to us and deal with us, Lord. We're here now, Father. And I commit this word to you. And I pray that as the people feel to be dismissed, they may be dismissed with your grace that you will go with them. May the words and the atmosphere of the service linger long in their heart. And Lord, may we make no excuse for ourselves, but may we face your word straight in the face, oh God. And may we make our declaration and our confession. We ask, Father, you forgive us in our failings, in our wrongs, and whatever we have done or said or committed. Forgive us, I pray. And as we confess now, the wrong is sent down into the bleach of your blood and it is annihilated and forgotten into your sea of forgetfulness. And take this people, I pray, to another level of spiritual living. In the name of Jesus Christ, I ask it. Amen. [Music] I am thine, oh Lord. I have heard thy voice and I love to be. Here's the desire [Music] of every [Music] [Applause] [Music] near to the Oh, here [Music] Lord to thy preious. Hallelujah. [Music] I'm going to dismiss you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Just ask you to you obey the Lord and when you leave, please don't visit out in the foyer. We like to leave it quiet, Reverend. And this is where people pray and God speaks to them. And if you feel that you want to find a place and meditate and have prayer or need prayer, you may come forward. That would be fine. But you're dismissed in Jesus name. God bless you. Draw me nearer, nearerless to the cross where throwing [Music] nearer, nearer, nearer. Blessed Lord to thy preious. [Music] Thank you for Jesus. [Music] word of God. [Music] That is how we receive our overs. [Music] and [Music]
