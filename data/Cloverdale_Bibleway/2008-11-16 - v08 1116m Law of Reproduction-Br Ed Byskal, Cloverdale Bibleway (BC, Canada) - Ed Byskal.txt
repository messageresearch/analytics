We want to remember them. Amen. Unite our hearts with them. We have a mighty God. He's able to deliver. We want to unite our hearts with them this morning.

Brother Andy Melma's got a song for us this morning. So, Brother Andy, if you could come and get ready while we've got a couple of announcements. on Friday night, uh, November 21st, uh, they're going to have, uh, some special young people's meetings. Uh, and so I want to go through it just now. I, uh, just so everyone knows what's going on and what's h going to be happening. This is next Friday night, November the 21st. Um, young men, okay? If you're a young man, you go to Young People's Meeting. The meeting is going to be at the Mount Baker Bible Way Camp, 7:30 p.m. Young men only, age 13 to 30 if you're single. All the young men are needed at the camp Saturday, November 22nd for a work workbe. There's just a whole bunch of stuff that needs to be get done. So, this is Brother Kris's way of getting you out there. Um, accommodations are going to be at the Sequoia dorm above the cafeteria. Each camper will need to bring their own bedding. There's going to be a Friday evening snack provided after the meeting. That means you should eat ahead of time before you get down there. Um, breakfast and lunch will be provided for the workers on Saturday. Please give confirmation to the church office that you will be spending the night and available for work on Saturday. And obviously if some of you are working on Saturday um uh you know in your job, you may want to go down there and then and then just uh and then just come home Saturday morning. Um there is for the sisters, the young ladies, there's going to be a regular meeting here at the church at the fellowship hall at 7:30 p.m. And again, this is for the young single sisters only, 13 to 30. There's going to be a special speaker for the sisters this evening. And as usual, refreshments will follow. If you have any questions, please contact the church office. Also, um, Brother Chris informed me that they are in need of seven adults to actually assist in the fence installation. I I don't know if that means that the young men can't actually work, but they need someone to actually assist in the fence installations. Some will from the US side in the building trades who have screw guns would be helpful. Other young people can help if they're able. They've got lots of shovels, picks, and rakes. They also need uh someone over the age of 18 who's able to punch a time clock and stay up all night because of the we don't have the fire system in there yet. It hasn't been tested. It's there, but it hasn't been tested and approved. So, they they need uh someone to stay up all night. So, uh I assume that's not one of the campers there, but uh if you are interested in going down there and uh uh and provide this help, they would really appreciate it. Um those that are needed for the fencing detail uh should show up at 9:00 in the morning and um have any questions, you can talk to Brother Chris Peterson. Amen. Brother Andy We come to a place this morning where we can cut off pressure. We uh we hear absolute masterpieces from behind this pulpit and uh it's teached here continually preached and teached. Just in the last week, we've uh we've heard the light behind the veil. Brother Ed preaching about the light is pressing the darkness and the darkness is congealing. God's light will never give way to darkness. It will always overcome. Sometimes what the the prophet said may seem strong but the light shines and anything less and it would not have pressed the darkness back. This church clover Bible way is a healing atmosphere and it's your job to keep it that way to bind up the brokenhearted. And then we heard uh apprehended by God brother Tom apprehended by love for love and always keep love before you. We're dead. Brother Tom said, we're dead earnest, serious about with this gospel. There's seven virtues and the stature of a perfect man. We're at the top of the pyramid of perfect love. And none of these virtues are disinished. Brother John preached breaking the chains of temptation. God said, "I will keep you in the hour of temptation." He said that. And we're all being tempted. We were born to crush Satan. These sermons have come from the word of God and and God himself. They're there for us to help us that we might glorify God in all we do and say. Something Brother Biscll said last year that really helped me was uh he said, "It's a principle. Let it be known. It's a principle. If we don't receive and embrace and reverence the light that has come, darkness will creep in. We go through fiery trials. And brother, brother Ed asked the question, how do we compensate? We get into the light. It's the light that drives out the darkness. going to sing until then. My heart can sing when I pause to remember a heartache here is but a stepping stone [Music] along the trail that's winding always upward. word. [Music] This troubled world is not my final home. But until then, my heart will go on singing. [Applause] [Music] Until then, [Music] with joy I'll carry on. Until the day mine eyes behold the city. Until the day God calls me home. The things of earth will dim and lose their value. If we recall, they're borrowed for a while. And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble. remembered there will only bring a smile. But until then, my heart will go on singing. [Music] Until then, with joy I'll carry on. Until the day mine eyes behold the city. [Music] Until the day God calls me home. This weary world with all its toil and struggle may take its toll of misery and strife. The soul of man is like a waiting eagle. [Music] When it's released, it's destined for the skies. But until then, my heart will go on singing. [Music] Until then, with joy I'll carry on. Until the day mine eyes behold the city. [Music] Until the day God calls me home. But until then with on singing until then [Music] with joy I'll carry on until the day mine eyes behold the city [Music] until the day God calls me home. God bless you. Thank you, brother Andy. The joy of the Lord is our strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; You have the joy of the Lord in your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Going to be turning to the word at this time as brother Ed comes. Let's sing together. For I am thine, O Lord. I have heard thy voice and it told thy love to me. [Music] I am thy Lord. I have heard thy voice thy love to me. Why you are Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] I preious. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. That's the prayer of my heart. That's why I asked Brother Rod to sing that just as we as I would come to the pull pit. I am thine, O Lord. &gt;&gt; I've heard thy voice &gt;&gt; and it told thy love for me, &gt;&gt; but I long to rise. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the arms of faith &gt;&gt; and be closer drawn to thee. It's my testimony. It's my hunger, my desire, my craving, and yours, too. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for that. We're really happy to have our brother Murphy back after two intense months into many new places in China. And I can tell you that when brother Murphy goes to China, it is uh a working trip, working and ministering from morning till night. I'm going to just ask him to greet you, but I want to say China is such a a remarkable uh work for for myself. It's it's so remarkable in in how it had its beginnings. saw brother John lay just as I was driving in this morning and he and brother John Sack are first going there with you know pack sacks on their back and and handing out books at the three self church and just going in there and then then God just starts opening the doors and creating a need and creating a hunger and people you know coming and becoming real curious about the message And then it just begins to grow like that. And uh now here we are a few years later uh 330ome messages translated 240ome voice over on the voice and I can tell you because very dedicated people and brother Timothy M. God bless these brothers that have labored. Brother Ivan, uh God bless them. And then those that were raised up over there, they just, you know, some just took a hold of it, some didn't take a hold of it. But, uh, the work has spread to, to me, that is it's so divine because it is sovereign. Nobody has planned it out. It's God planned it out. He opened the doors, arranged the certain individuals, and it just came out of the burden of the heart of the people. And here we have this taking place. So, Brother Murphy, we have missed you, Brother Murphy, I just feel like he's a a son. I miss him so much when he's away. Now, here he is. And just greet the people, Brother Murphy, and say a few words about where you've been. And Amen. He looks all right, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; I told him it's hard to have sympathy for him when he looks so good after that long trip. God bless you, brother M. &gt;&gt; Well, so glad to be back and see all the saints. Um my family uh that come to know you all that's my family and brothers and sisters I really been appreciate you uh I know this uh many have been praying for me and uh also my family I just want to say God bless you and um this is a unique trip for me um uh we uh went to uh several new places and the Lord really opened a door and we went to um um never been such a door to open to my life uh in the in the past few years for the ministry um we go to we went to the street self church and the home church and some church they have the hundreds of people to open door for us and some uh even the government church they said um you know we want to have the training class you can preach whatever you can preach and uh we give you open door for this and also uh we saw the pastors in the street church been baptized and not only be baptized but as afterward they sending a message back to us they said um our whole lives been upside down but for the Good. &gt;&gt; And um they received the books and they've been reading that &gt;&gt; and they said um the prophet said after we read the seals book the prophet said we need to get out of the system. He said now we need uh we're going to uh making this decision. So you can see how the lord been working in them. So I just ask you to praying for them and um if lord willing and um u maybe I can share more detail but today I just want to listen to my pastor's preaching. God bless you. [Applause] [Music] If you'd be having special prayer for us next uh Sunday, they're having a a missions convention. I shouldn't say missions convention, but it's a focus on missions. And uh Lord willing, I will be uh there with them in Murphy'sboro. Uh brother Joseph Hammed has God put it in his heart some years ago And when he came up to the 27 207 convention, it just sparked. It came to fruition in his heart. He's been traveling almost he said a lot of this summer he was traveling to other churches to see how many would like to participate and there was quite a number said we want to be part of what's uh taking place. So they are uh they're joining together. One of the big concerns was that they didn't the price of fuel was so high that the pastors in other places other states said we just don't see how are people going to be able to drive and the price of motel and everything also high and so people were going to have be under financial strain. Well, guess what? A lot of that's gone away. The fuel went down about half price and he went around to the motel because of the meltdown. Nobody's traveling and there's literally real fine uh holiday in express and some of these they cut their price right in half. People are getting getting rooms for prices they never were able to get it before. Brother Kim is Kim Dingwell is going to be there. Brother Dier is coming as well. Brother Dioa is coming with a couple of men of his brothers from uh Congo and they're wanting to focus on uh just several countries. So on Africa and they thought brother Dioa would be such a good representative of what is taking place there and they want to get behind that work China. So brother Murphy is going he just got home but he'll turn around go for this weekend down there just for the three days Friday, Saturday, Sunday. and these brothers and brother Kim who's just been in India now and Philippines and brother Ernie you're going to be there as well and so these brothers are pray for them would you please pray for them because many of these churches they're not like for example here they've not heard they've not been kept up to date they maybe they don't even have an outreach at all and and they but they want to and this will give them an open door if the Lord lays it on their heart. So these brothers will just represent these countries and we're so thankful for that. I don't know whether they had prayer earlier. I was just locked away in in the study. But for Sister Deborah Reed, Sister Jennifer Johnson's mom, and Sister Jennifer is with her this morning. They thought that she had a collapsed lung and it turned out that she has num they think that she has pneumonia. So we're going to remember her in prayer. Also, uh I just really respect Sister Jennifer for standing by her mother the way she does. And I I the sisters that have been so faithful. So we I I prayed I prayed. I said, "Lord Jesus, all you have to do is come to her bedside and just tenderly touch her and awaken her." Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's no reason why that could couldn't just happen this morning while we're in prayer. Amen. That's a simple thing to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we stand to our feet? We'll just pray as we going to get ready to turn to the word. Our dear heavenly father, how dear you are to us. And that's why we call you dear heavenly father who has loved fatherhood and has brought forth a family. And this this group of people that is here, those that are streaming, those that are in the fellowship room, the nursery, wherever, we are we are your children. We are representative, Lord. Just a representative of people that are all over all over the world. Those that Brother Murphy has just ministered to. Lord, we want to pray for them. These ministers that are part of the uh part of the recognized church in that country and there are the the word and the message has turned their life upside down and we can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; We have experienced the same thing. It is a word that certainly turns a life around and sometimes oh God just a complete reversal of direction. So we pray for them. We pray you'll strengthen them and give them courage. Oh God, give them discernment. Father, may the power of the Holy Spirit direct their every decision and every step. Lord, I pray for the service this morning. Pray that you will take your word, drive it to every heart. We're a needy people, Lord. I confess we're a needy people, oh God. We need we need everything that you can give us. We pray that you will so inspire us, Lord. So anoint us. Anoint me to speak. Anoint the people to receive. I pray that it will hit the target. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, we're remembering Sister Deborah Reed. Oh God, out of this slumber and out of this unconscious state, would you awaken her, Lord? Go to her bedside and and touch her body, oh God. touch, oh God, the part that needs to be repaired. I pray that you'll just awaken her out of the slumber. And I pray you'll strengthen Sister Jennifer, dear Lord, as she stands by her mother so respectfully. God, I pray you'll encourage her. And now, Lord Jesus, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven is our prayer. Enable me now, Lord, to speak and utter the words of the Holy Spirit in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I'll have you turn to 1 Corinthians 15. And while you're turning, I want to thank brother Annie Melma for that song until then and the comments you made. And uh it's wonderful, brother, you know, listens and makes notes and something speaks to him and he's able to share it with you at a later time. And uh we appreciate that. That's real real quality brothers. Amen. &gt;&gt; And a good singer, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we get a double benefit. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start reading at verse 42. Quite a lengthy reading. 1 Corinthians 15:42. Verses 35 to 38. uh start out with a question, but some uh some man will say, "How are the dead raised up?" And Paul begins to uh equate the human body to a seed and whatever is buried will bring forth again. That is the what his thought is. And then he talks about the there's different kinds of flesh. There's flesh of fishes and beasts and and birds and so on. And then in verse 42, he said, "It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness. It is raised in power. It is sown a natural body. It is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body." And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul, but the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. How be it that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Can we say amen to that? Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither do corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. And when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I I want to speak to you on this uh subject law of reproduction. Law of reproduction. And as the apostle Paul is is is taking us through this scripture which is the word of God, he makes clear distinctions between the earthly and the heavenly, between the natural body and the spiritual body. Between that which is sown in weakness, it's raised in power. That which is sown in dishonor is raised in glory. The first Adam and the second Adam from heaven. The corruptible and the incorruptible. The mortal and the immortal. All of these are what we have just read. And there are laws that control each of them. That's how come something is corruption corruptible because God has a law that said it would die. And there's an incorruptible which is another law. There's a natural. We have natural laws. We have spiritual laws. And a law is a law. A law is not something you can adjust and play with. A law is a law. He said plainly, you know, if the law says 30 m an hour, that's what it is. &gt;&gt; Now, you might go 35 or you might go 25, but the the law is is the law. The law is that fire is hot. It's always been hot. It's hot today and it'll be hot tomorrow and it'll be hot thousand years from now if the earth should stand. These are laws and there are natural laws. There are spiritual laws. There's laws of gravity and laws of science and all kinds of things which we don't want to even spend time in this morning. But I'm speaking of the law of reproduction and the emphasis is on the seed. Apostle Paul begins to describe our bodies as a seed. But I want to go back and I'll just I'll give you these scriptures. You don't have to turn to them because I'm going to be going quite fast. But in Genesis 1 says, "And God said, let the earth bring forth grass and herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind." I'm going to make making emphasis as I go along. Whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind. and the tree fruit whose seed and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind. And God saw there was good. And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth uh which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every wing foul after his kind. And God saw that it was good. And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind, cattle and creeping things, and the beast of the earth after his kind." And it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every little every living thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind. And God saw that was good. And God said, "Let us make man." Didn't say after our kind, but in our image. Amen. &gt;&gt; And after our likeness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And he did so. And let them have dominion over all these other kinds. &gt;&gt; The fowl and the cattle and over all the earth. And so God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them. And apostle Paul says, "Now that body was a seed, right? lifebearing seed is the centerpiece of the Bible. I want you to listen very carefully because I have some serious things to say. Someone has said and I just read they have never there have never been any instances of any plant growing from a kernel of corn. The same law, the same law uh any instance of any plant growing from a kernel of corn, the same law is observed with all other form farm crops and in fact all forms of life during the past 5,000 years for which written records are available. There are no documented reports of any new species of life that have ever been observed to have formed from any other species. And the reason I just read that little paragraph is because God kept saying after their kind, &gt;&gt; after its kind, after his kind. And that is that is God's word. And he put certain boundaries and a law concerning it. So seed giving forth its substance in the spring, just some comments on seed. Seed bringing forth or giving forth its substance into the earth and bringing forth new life in the spring is to us a reminder of the resurrection. seed sending forth this life force confirms to us that life is stronger than death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That tender little plant which the prophet says where's the grass the greenest. It's at the far edge of the concrete because it springs up under that concrete and it will move as long and as far as it needs to move to get to the edge because the sun is calling for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we see that, it's speaking to us. &gt;&gt; When we see the tender life coming from the seed, it manifests such indescribable strength and power over death. &gt;&gt; And it reminds us and and if need be, it will break through stones. It will break through black top. And it'll find a crack someplace or even push it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the strength. And if you try to put that together in your mind, how does this little tender thing that all is so soft and pliable manage to keep pushing that black top till there's a hump in it &gt;&gt; and the two of them or one is so will look so durable, so strong, and yet the little plant will bring wind its way up through there. It speaks to us of the strength that life has, the endurance of it. &gt;&gt; And it and it speaks to us of God's promise. &gt;&gt; God promised Noah, he said to Noah when he when he spoke to him, he says, "And behold, I will establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you." That's what was in God's mind &gt;&gt; when he came to Abraham. And the promise that he that that he made to Abraham, the centerpiece of that promise was to you and your seed after you. And the Lord appeared to Abram and said, "Unto thy seed &gt;&gt; will I give this land, and there builded he an altar unto the Lord that appeared to him." The apostle Paul is declaring that God has another process or law in bringing forth his children when he wrote and spoke this to the Romans. Not as though the word of God have taken none effect. For they are not all Israel which are of Israel. Now he's talking about they're not all Israel that are of that are of Israel. Neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children. But in Isaac shall thy seed be called. So now we see a a line of demarcation taking place. Not all that are Israel. Not all who come through the physical lineage of of Abraham. Not all are are Israel that are of Israel because the children now he's talking about the children. The children are accounted of the promise. So now it's a promise that's bringing forth children. &gt;&gt; The promise, not just the sperm of a human, but the promise is bringing forth. It's another breed. It's another species. It's another kind &gt;&gt; that will bring forth after its kind. And it can only be the kind of the one from where the promise originated. &gt;&gt; So that is they which are the children of the flesh. These are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for seed. &gt;&gt; See how important this is to God that even when God made the promise, his thought was on the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will use this as a tool to bring seed, &gt;&gt; children to me. Children which will be of the promise. And so now we have a a process that is taking place. The law the law the law that brought forth the God man. It was the law. It was the law that brought forth Jesus Christ. The God man. It wasn't it wasn't just an accident. It wasn't, you know, that someone had a a good idea or someone even had a great desire. So, we need a Messiah. It wasn't that. And that God yielded to their crying and their desires. But the Bible says this. Now, watch the process. I'm moving very, very as accurately as I know how. The process because I'm speaking of the law of reproduction. Not as we have our children, but the law of reproduction is God. Friends, this world is a troubled place. &gt;&gt; And you know, this isn't the this isn't our home. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And the spirit of God moved upon the prophets, moved upon the prophets to speak the word." Please watch the process closely. For the prophecy came not in old time, speaks the apostle Peter. It did not come in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't they didn't speak just to write us a book and to give us some comforting words or to give us some instruction or better life. They spoke because God was using this this method, this process to bring forth of his own kind. &gt;&gt; Because of the fall, Adam couldn't do it. Adam and Eve couldn't do it. No other person could do it from that time forward. God had to start a new creation. And that new creation had to come by the word of God. So he moved upon the holy men of old and spoke the word of promise. &gt;&gt; And they came and spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And the word moved is that they were making an announcement. This wasn't just some casual information. They were making announcement. Behold, behold, a virgin shall conceive. And they they made these announcements. They were moved by the burden of the word. They were moved to bring forth whatever the word was speaking in itself. The burden of the word of the Lord moved through the prophets until the Holy Spirit spoke directly through them. In Isaiah, he was one and there are many. But in Isaiah 7:14, therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bring a son, and shall call his name Emanuel. Now, I'm in a process. This is this is a law. I'm taking you through the steps of the law of another reproduction &gt;&gt; of the God man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he shall bring forth. And then the scripture says Isaiah again, "And unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. And I asked the question, what process is it that took precedence &gt;&gt; over the law of human reproduction? &gt;&gt; We're moving through it right now, friends. This is not story time. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is reality time. &gt;&gt; And God wants us perhaps to just get a a nugget, not a nugget of information, &gt;&gt; not something that is is, you know, just something new. Oh, that was wonderful. That isn't what I want. I would like that God would uh anchor into your heart a principle of his word and a principle of this law. This process of reproduction so that you can see yourself in that process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not in church, &gt;&gt; not in the choir, not in anything else, but see yourself in the process of the reproduction &gt;&gt; of the God man. unto us a child is born and then the process moves forward. The process of the human life that is now it is the spiritual law of reproduction is taking place and precedence over the law of nature itself. And the angel answered and said unto her to Mary, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. It's just a young girl, unlike any other young lady in this congregation. Only this was her part, &gt;&gt; and she does not have your part. But this was her part and she could not act out that part unless the promise had been spoken. &gt;&gt; Holy men of God spake as they were moved. Prophets by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They were moved by God because God knew in his wisdom on down the road was going to rise one that was going to take that and believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God was in the process of bringing forth. He said, "This is how I'll bring forth my kind." &gt;&gt; I'll bring forth God people. &gt;&gt; I'll bring forth God men and women. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends, &gt;&gt; I might fail. You might fail, but God will not fail. &gt;&gt; He will have that family. &gt;&gt; He will have those children. and they are God people. &gt;&gt; Years ago when the hippies were around and they uh even moved me because they said Jesus people and I thought that's a wonderful thing. Jesus people that's what the world really needs is Jesus people a God man. &gt;&gt; And the power of the highest shall overshadow thee. And therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a whole different specy, &gt;&gt; whole different process. &gt;&gt; Even the process is different. &gt;&gt; Nobody saw a twinkle in Mary's eye. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost overshadowed her. &gt;&gt; This isn't something where you have to have a shiver down your spine. or any emotional thing. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet came and tried to jerk us away from that. &gt;&gt; People were so caught up. Oh, oh, I feel it. &gt;&gt; I sat in the church once, not to mock the brother. He's a very, very dear friend. In fact, as I lived in their home as a son, as a boy, not as a son, but as a boy, boarded out in their home. And when he used to, you know, just during his service sometime, he just his hand would shake like that. He'd just feel something in his hand would shake. It's fine. One day he got up and testified. I never forgot it. I had to smile. He said, "You know, when I got married, that was a thrill." He said, "And when I got saved, that was a thrill." But he says, "When I got this," he thought that was the biggest thrill of them all. I just couldn't grasp it. How they could equate that with getting saved &gt;&gt; or equate that with getting married. I was with a f Pentecost was so given over to that, &gt;&gt; right? I was talking to a fellow and I I took a there was a little picture in a metal frame and I just took it and when I took it it it opened up, you know, and metal came against metal just went click. He said, "Did you hear that?" I said, "Well, yeah." He said, "You got something wrong with your back." I said, "No, it was this right here." No, no, no. He said, "You got something wrong with your back." Well, I may have something wrong with my back, but it wasn't that sound because that was the sound of that frame going click, click. people were all full of hookie spooks &gt;&gt; and then they couldn't get a hold of God because they had to have you know &gt;&gt; had to have that kind of hookie spook had to and then that's why they had to we were talking here uh just this last week and and and someone was telling us about how they were forcing them to get the Holy Spirit. You have to get the Holy Spirit. You have to speak in tongues. You have to speak in tongues. Just say this. Say this. Say this. Say this. Say this. And then and then they'd be so thrilled if they just said it. Well, you got it. And brother Brandham comes along says they thought they had it, &gt;&gt; but they didn't have it. &gt;&gt; The Quakers had to fall and they had to shake and other people had to do this and other people had to do that and had to speak in tongues and even in the message there's certain things you have to do. No, it's not that way, friends. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; comes down into the person and it has nothing to do with this flesh right here at all. Nothing to do with this body. It's another seed. It's another life. It's another process. &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that we in this life, in this body, don't get happy, &gt;&gt; clap our hands, shout, rejoice. I believe that we're supposed to do all those things. Anything that doesn't show emotion is dead. &gt;&gt; So, we're not against that. But that isn't that isn't the sign that it's there. &gt;&gt; And then uh and then the scripture says, now we're watching this. and the and behold thy cousin Elizabeth. She also hath conceived a son in her old age. Now that was the other process. That was the other law. She was receiving that son by Zachcharias. Mary had a son that was of no man &gt;&gt; and both were coming along at the same time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; One by the law of nature, but one by the law of creation. &gt;&gt; The new creation was on its way. &gt;&gt; And from that seed, from this seed here from John, if if he would be married and have children, it would all follow the natural birth after their kind. &gt;&gt; But by this one, he was going to bring forth of another kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want me to say it? &gt;&gt; Mary didn't have a man to bring forth children and Jesus didn't have a woman. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Created after their own kind. &gt;&gt; A process was on its way. Instituted by God Almighty. And nothing would change that. And so for nothing for with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, "Behold the handmade of the Lord. Be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her." I thought that was so remarkable. You know friends, we don't need to have big long discourses. We don't have to read, you know, multitudes of books. But when the word of God is spoken, you need to say as Mary &gt;&gt; from a from a heart of faith, be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to this word, &gt;&gt; be it unto me. And when she said that, be it unto me according to the word, the Bible says, and the angel departed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, God was saying, that's it. &gt;&gt; That's all I need to hear. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; The process is moving on. &gt;&gt; All you have to say is be it unto me according to your word and it's over. &gt;&gt; It's done. &gt;&gt; It's finished. &gt;&gt; Someone the law of reproduction is moving forward. &gt;&gt; And the angel departed. And the scripture says also, "And blessed is is she that believed, for there shall be a performance." Oh, I love this positive gospel. Don't you? &gt;&gt; There shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the process. &gt;&gt; And she brought forth another kind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So thankful for this kind. Yes, &gt;&gt; and the sea will not be air. Prophet said, "And God made both egg and germ." &gt;&gt; He created both in the womb of Mary. And that man was nothing was not nothing but God himself made flesh and dwelt among us. Emmanuel, not just a fine man, a prophet. He was a fine man and prophet, not a teacher, a theologian. Oh, he might have been all that. He was all in all, but above all that, he was God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible said we are saved by the blood of God, &gt;&gt; God himself. &gt;&gt; Not a third person or a second person, but the person God himself. &gt;&gt; All glory, all hail the name of Jesus. Let angels prostrate fall. &gt;&gt; Like the ransomed of the Lord say so. &gt;&gt; This is a new man, a new species. &gt;&gt; And from his seed, from his seed will come more of his own kind. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's a law of God. It has to produce after its own kind. Let every seed bring forth of its own kind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hope I'm not hope I'm not yelling too loud for you. &gt;&gt; In the Leodysian church age, he said the new creation. It's another creation distinct from the old creation. He is the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation which I read last Sunday but so fitting now that comes more down to our address personally as Jesus moved through his life now he it's true it's true he's another kind he's another specy he's a new creation never was a man like this man. Never was a man spake like this man. But now as he moved, it wasn't just Isaiah said unto us, a son is given. It wasn't just that. There were many others inspired words sent from his father. His the breath of his father issued out through the prophets. And these words also must be fulfilled. And so the Bible says, and a principle I want to really lay down here today, he took upon himself. &gt;&gt; He took &gt;&gt; upon himself. &gt;&gt; It wasn't imposed on him. &gt;&gt; He took upon himself the form of a servant, &gt;&gt; the form of a man. The Bible tells us that he literally took on himself. I'm putting it in my words. He literally took on himself humanity. &gt;&gt; But by the same process that he took upon himself humanity is the same process that God instituted and inaugurated through Christ. But he instituted that process. The same process that you will come into eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will you are being reproduced by the law of reproduction that God established at this time. And this was the this was the example seed. This was the example seed. &gt;&gt; And Jesus moved through life. He continually referred to the scriptures. The scriptures which are the very creative word of God being fulfilled. His life was the word of God in season. The word for his season. It was that word in motion. Philippians says Paul writing to the Philippians. Let let I looked and I wrestled all around for this. Let let this mind. Once again, it's a conscious decision. &gt;&gt; It's not that God's imposing it on you or you're going to get a shake and a jiggle and something down your spine and suddenly have it. No, this is something you do today. It's something you wake up and do tomorrow. It's something that God is part of God's process. And he's telling us through the Apostle Paul, you let &gt;&gt; this mind be in you. &gt;&gt; How many other things we let be in our minds and in our thoughts? But the Apostle Paul saying, "Let this mind be in you which was in Christ." Isn't this amazing? He's saying literally you can have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Otherwise it would be without any there'd be no objective in saying &gt;&gt; let this mind be in you if it wasn't possible. &gt;&gt; Isn't this glorious? &gt;&gt; Here we sit today with this glorious uh thing being presented to us. Yes, we may at some times, you know, uh I I I trust we'd be able to walk walk in it, but this is my desire that the mind of Christ would control this body of believers, this bride body of believers, that the mind of Christ would control our daily lives in our action. And I'm not so concerned about when you're sitting here in church, but it's when we're out there that the mind of Christ in the job making decisions, raising our families, doing all the things we have to do. Oh God, if there ever was a time we needed the mind of Christ, it's today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but listen closely, made himself of no reputation. &gt;&gt; He went there by his own conscious, conscious decision and choosing. He made himself You know, so often we like to look at our weaknesses and failures and say, "Oh, well, you know, whatever God wants, God make me whatever he wants me to be." No, no, no. It's not all God's part. &gt;&gt; There's things for us to do &gt;&gt; to make conscious decisions. Let this mind be in you. When you're rattling off something that hasn't come from the Holy Spirit, you should take this scripture. Let this mind be in you. Would Jesus say that? Would Jesus do that? Would Jesus think that? If our decision is no, he wouldn't, then it's up to us to turn aside from that and think his thoughts. &gt;&gt; And his thoughts is his word. So it's very clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus took the elements. Now watch closely because all these scriptures which I'm still going to come to in just a moment. Jesus literally now took the elements of this supernatural sinless body. This is a incredibly marvelous thing that God is doing because he started with a God egg &gt;&gt; and a God germ, &gt;&gt; right? bringing forth a good man. &gt;&gt; But he allowed that man to be formed in a woman &gt;&gt; because of what happened in the garden. And she fell and and and another seed came through the woman. &gt;&gt; A man called Cain. &gt;&gt; I don't want to even get into it, but if you can get my point. So, so they were not able to bring forth a god kind in the image of God. He made them in the image of God, but they fell. And so now the woman has a womb. The only the only one that could handle the seed like that made for seed. And the serpent came to her and sowed seed. Satan using the instrumentality of that enemy and swed seed in her womb and her husband took her quickly and swed seed in her womb. Seed is the centerpiece of creation. &gt;&gt; Everything rests upon this. That's why when God gave first promise to the first man of promise Abraham to you and your seed, &gt;&gt; seed is a thing friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; It hasn't got a whole lot of importance to a lot of people today, but in the eyes and the mind of God, &gt;&gt; it's called in the word precious seed. &gt;&gt; And now she's sown with this seed. And so she ate of the things of the earth. Eve did as so did Mary. But now we've got a God germ &gt;&gt; and a God egg. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A new creation of God that's bringing forth a God man. But that God man is being nourished of the elements of the cursed earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's a new creation. But his body he's taking to himself. God himself is taking the elements of a cursed earth. The whole earth was cursed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You following me? &gt;&gt; Amen. And when that body came forth, but it was the life he was a God man and it was that life that's why as he began his movement through earth. It was a very thought in the minds of God, he knew what had been breathed through the prophets was the word of God. and those words that were for his season. He must take this body by that word and fulfill every one of those words at each station. And he would say, "How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled?" He went here that it might be fulfilled. He went and lived in Nazareth that it might be fulfilled even as a child, as a babe that took him to Egypt, that he might be fulfilled. out of Egypt have I called my son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That it might be fulfilled. And so what is we say? Oh, that was the word of the prophet. That was the word of the prophet. No. No. Now those words are being lived out &gt;&gt; through a man. &gt;&gt; What is he doing? He's putting on that word &gt;&gt; in his daily life. &gt;&gt; His daily eating, his daily sleeping. He's putting on that word of life. that word that has been spoken through the prophets because he must take this body &gt;&gt; to Calvary and that part of the earth must be redeemed. &gt;&gt; And he took it to the washing and was baptized by John and came to Calvary. He must He must not just be washed. He must come to the death. He must take this earth to the death &gt;&gt; and to the grave &gt;&gt; and bring it back forth into the resurrection &gt;&gt; and bring that earth back and make it subject to the law of supernatural reproduction. &gt;&gt; Have you followed me? &gt;&gt; Say amen if you have. &gt;&gt; And you came &gt;&gt; condemned. Your daddy was condemned. Your mama was condemned. Your grandparents were condemned. You came from generations from the beginning condemned &gt;&gt; with no hope at all. The prophet says, &gt;&gt; we're condemned creatures &gt;&gt; in a body. Look at us. &gt;&gt; Losing our hair, gray, all kinds of things. You can fix it up all you want, but you're still going the same direction. And if time goes on, you'll all end up on a slab &gt;&gt; in some funeral mortuary &gt;&gt; because and if you the only way you can change change that process is by the holy word &gt;&gt; that's been spoken and a holy prophet that came in this time to identify the holst promise for this hour. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if God reveals that promise to you, then you have a life because you're coming into a different process and you're bringing this old cursed body to eternal life &gt;&gt; through the law of reproduction. &gt;&gt; This isn't a light message, folks. &gt;&gt; I want you to ponder that. Very deep. And so now it's up to you and you should be saying in view of Jesus the first of the man the God mankind him his mind let this mind be in you right &gt;&gt; what mind what was spoken for this hour &gt;&gt; there are certain specific promises that are spoken I haven't got time to go into the oil you read the message I'm here to alert you when you do when you hear it when you hear it across the pulpit you want to garn those things that are promises for this hour &gt;&gt; I'll give you one we shall all be changed &gt;&gt; and this is its season &gt;&gt; and that you ought to be saying that it might be fulfilled &gt;&gt; which was spoken of the by the Lord &gt;&gt; through the first messenger we shall all be changed &gt;&gt; hallelujah Yeah, &gt;&gt; that is my promise for this day. &gt;&gt; And by that faith in that word that's been confirmed by that messenger, we move &gt;&gt; and we take this body of this cursed earth and we're bringing it to immortal life, a different law, a different process. By our mothers we die. &gt;&gt; But by God through Jesus Christ we live. Jesus took the elements that made up his body beyond the law of nature. He took it in this process until it was beyond the law of nature. And I'll tell you my brothers and sisters, according to this message which we have confirmed to us, vindicated to us today by pillar of fire, there's going to be a group of people that are going to be ready. And the longer I live, I I see the fewer there will be. But there's going to be a few that's going to take this body of these elements that came through the natural law, natural process, but they're going to literally take it beyond the reach of death. &gt;&gt; They're going to break. &gt;&gt; And they that believe it now, and it's a revelation to you, we have already broken that law. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Death has no power. for the redeemed ones. &gt;&gt; That is why scripture says of Jesus, he asked the questions. He says, "Now all this was done." Matthew 1:21-22 that it might be fulfilled 2 and 15. that it might be fulfilled which is spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying out of Egypt do I call my son Matthew 2:23 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of prophets he shall be called a Nazarene 4 and4 Matthew that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Isaiah 8:17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses that it might be fulfilled Matthew 12:17 which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, Isaiah spoke so much of him. And in 13:35, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, and I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. Matthew 21:4, all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, he kept referring to it. He wasn't he wasn't trying to teach his disciples what the prophet said. He was telling them and identifying. They couldn't identify it, but he was letting them know what what I'm going through now, what I'm living is that scripture. &gt;&gt; What was he doing in my language today? He was putting on &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; that scripture &gt;&gt; consciously when even they tried to have him escape the agonies of the cross. And Jesus said, "Then how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?" He gave himself to it. It wasn't God, you know, pushing him into Gethsemane. He went to Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was putting on the word of God. &gt;&gt; You know, you ought to see yourself in a different light today. &gt;&gt; What are you doing here today? I'm actually putting on the word of God that says I ought to assemble myself together. And the more so, as I see the day approaching, that it might be fulfilled. I'm sitting here today That's the only time it'll do you any good &gt;&gt; because there's multitudes and multitudes sitting in churches today means nothing to them because it's not the mind of Christ. They're haven't even got it in their conscious awareness &gt;&gt; and it's not just saying oh this nice little phrasing that we that we should gather ourselves together and we have a prophet in this day say we ought to be waiting at the doors &gt;&gt; when waiting for those doors to open. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has always given us an example and Jesus Christ was that example for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He lived his entire life &gt;&gt; putting on the word. Apostle Paul said in the Romans, for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, for that law, the law of the spirit of life that was in Christ Jesus, that law has made you free &gt;&gt; from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; That law that was operating in Jesus Christ in you &gt;&gt; has made you free &gt;&gt; from another law and the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; Is that God's word? &gt;&gt; Is that God's word? &gt;&gt; Take that one out and pin it on your wall if you wish to. &gt;&gt; Romans 8 and2 literally speaking, &gt;&gt; putting on immortality. See, the reason I'm preaching this today is because too many are just sitting back. Yeah, we're believers. You know, Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, and Revelation, they're just going on their way and busy in their daily work, etc., etc., and are not conscious in the day today that I'm here to put on &gt;&gt; immortality. And if you're walking in the light as he is in the light, you will I'm I'm adding this last phrase, you will not be left behind. &gt;&gt; If you're walking in the light as he is in the light. So the law of reproduction for it became him of whom are all things. Now I'm taking another step. It became him. Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 2:10, became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons &gt;&gt; unto glory. &gt;&gt; Not bringing many sons into the world, bringing many sons unto glory. &gt;&gt; Hello sons and daughters. Hello. The progeny of this promise. &gt;&gt; This is why he's here. This is why he came. It became him. &gt;&gt; This was his calling. This was his purpose. Say, what was the purpose of Jesus Christ? To die and go to Calvary and and to die to death, go to the grave and raise. That's part of it. But if that's all there was to it, it certainly would have not fulfilled the desire of God. &gt;&gt; When he says, "Where's my family? Where's my household? It became him to bring forth many sons and daughters. Oh, how glorious, friends &gt;&gt; that we're seated here today. &gt;&gt; And this became his whole his whole I won't even say his ambition, but this became his whole objective. This was his objective &gt;&gt; to bring forth sons and daughters &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God. how the heart of God must beat today when he sees a a an audience of people like this that have come here to hear the word. Lay it down. I want to do it. I want to live it. &gt;&gt; See, we're not here to hear it. We're here to do it. &gt;&gt; It's not hearing it that puts on immortality. It's doing it. &gt;&gt; Living out that scripture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Children by the original spoken word. &gt;&gt; Children by the original spoken word. I understand we have about 3,000 plus denominations registered in the world. We have hundreds of millions of people and they're sincere. They pray and they give huge amounts and build grand edififices of a test as a testament to what they believe. I spoke to my wife just on the way here. I've said it here over this pulpit, but it has become more pronounced to me than ever before. If this message that was spoken was not attested to by God, the pillar of fire and the supernatural visions. I listened to brother Brandham coming to church this morning. He's talking about the visions. If we didn't have a prophet that had the visions and spoke it and for all these years the people said, "It's true. &gt;&gt; It's true. It's true." &gt;&gt; In prayer last night that so touched me. I said, "God, we have a message that's an absolute. &gt;&gt; I'm going to follow that message to the letter &gt;&gt; because you attested to it and they said it's true. &gt;&gt; Only truth &gt;&gt; will stand." &gt;&gt; And then we put that on and we come into immortal life. It will bring us to our destination, friends. And after all is said and done. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm just giving you some personal. I just had to quietly sing. This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just passing through. &gt;&gt; And how can I say that, friends? How can you say it? It's not just a song with some harmony to it and melody. This world is not my home. Because you have to have that assurance within you. I am putting on immortality by every word of God that is spoken. I'm here to do it. I'm here not just to hear it. I'm here to do it. And by doing it, I'm living out that word. I'm that word is the eternal word of God. Jesus said, "Heavens and earth will pass away. My word will never pass away." In other words, that seed will never pass away. That seed when it's dropped in the right place, it's going to bring the same kind. &gt;&gt; And that kind doesn't die. So I said to my wife coming to church, if this message didn't have that vindication, we have nothing more than everybody else. &gt;&gt; And I would just say to you, go and choose the best you can find and get along through life. &gt;&gt; It is that visitation &gt;&gt; or call vindication or call pillar of fire or call the supernatural that is the one thing that separates us from everything else. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's why when they said to brother Brandham, "We're all the same." And he said, "We're not the same." &gt;&gt; Oh, how glad I am. We're not the same. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not finished. Having brought you to that point, then what is it that we have? We have something that came original. &gt;&gt; Had not been here before. This is I I I I hope you don't misunderstand me, but I'm going to make a strong statement. That's what separates us from every other movement on earth because they do not have an original word. &gt;&gt; We have an original message. &gt;&gt; And so when he came to speak that he called it the spoken word is the original &gt;&gt; seed. Hallelujah. It's the original seed. It's a seed for the new species. It's a seed for you in this day. It's to tell you there's another process, the law of reproduction &gt;&gt; by the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The world is full of questions and theories, but I'm speaking of children by the spoken word. &gt;&gt; We may not be the smartest people on earth. We may not have things that other people have or we may have more than other people have. That's irrelevant &gt;&gt; to me. This building and all the accessories and everything means nothing. Everything to me is the original seed, &gt;&gt; the original life. &gt;&gt; This process of the law &gt;&gt; of reproduction. &gt;&gt; Appreciate your time. And in the message trying to do God a service, he said, "And it's my purpose here now to try to get every man not to change your theologies or nothing, but to increase your faith in God's promise in this day." He was telling those brethren, I'm not here to try to change your theology. I'm not here to try to change, you know, a whole lot of things for you. Not here just to give you something new, but I'm trying to give you something that will increase your faith in God's promise in this day. &gt;&gt; And anointed ones at the end time. And I say this to you, you are a separated people, &gt;&gt; holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; This isn't brother Ed Bisll. &gt;&gt; This the spirit of Elijah. There's a holy prophet of God &gt;&gt; saying you're separated. &gt;&gt; Oh, I say all kinds of people could say that. The key and the the ultimate is there has to be an original word. &gt;&gt; There has to be an original word. The only thing that makes the message original is the supernatural vindication &gt;&gt; who multitudes tried to copy but they couldn't copy it. And he had to call them impersonators. said, "They're my brethren, but they're impersonating &gt;&gt; because why were they impersonating?" Because he was putting on and fulfilling the scriptures concerning him. So, he pointed to Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Why did he point to Malachi 4? Not because we need to hear it. Because he was living it. &gt;&gt; He pointed to Luke 17 and 30 in the days of the revealing of the son of man. because the son of man was revealing that scripture and letting us know we're in that season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to break loose and have a re personal revival, friends. &gt;&gt; And what was it? It was the law of reproduction after the God man. &gt;&gt; I say the prophet of God was a man of God. &gt;&gt; And I'll say further to that and threatening to be misunderstood, he was also a God man &gt;&gt; because what was in him was God &gt;&gt; and what's in every believer is God. Not God diluted, &gt;&gt; not God somehow diminished God. &gt;&gt; And we become a God people &gt;&gt; by another law. &gt;&gt; Amen. the law of reproduction. &gt;&gt; Putting on immortality &gt;&gt; by letting the God in you, let the God in you live. &gt;&gt; And is your life worthy of the gospel? And I have a number of quotes here and it won't be that long. The only way that you can live a life that's worthy of the gospel. The only way that's absolute statement that you can live a life worthy of the gospel. So I'm sure your heart is beating saying what is it? Read on pastor. Read on. Let the gospel itself, every bit of the gospel come into you and reflect his promises back, make them vindicated &gt;&gt; and let God live in you to vindicate the promises of this day. &gt;&gt; Now, it's gone beyond the vindication which he had. But he's saying if we let the gospel, every bit of the gospel for the promised word of this hour live in us, then your life is going to vindicate that promise. Your life's going to show that that promise actually exists and is being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hope I didn't lose you there. In the message God talked with Moses to Moses, he said, "A Jewish church was brought out of Egypt to Palestine was a natural church, God's natural people who had a natural law. But we today are God's supernatural spiritual rather spiritual church with a spiritual law written on the tables of our hearts &gt;&gt; led in a spiritual form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says now they looked up to see where the pillar of fire was the angel of the Lord. But we don't look today. He said, "There's something happens that we know he's here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I use Brother Brandham's words in shalom. He said, "Oh, I feel it all over me now." And I do. &gt;&gt; I'd like to stay here longer. &gt;&gt; This is the best time we can feel it all over us cuz we're receiving that word. Yay. Yay. Amen to that word. It'll push that darkness back. &gt;&gt; It'll drive that darkness back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, in questions and answers, this very, very important. Here's the question. Please explain the mystery of the translation of the bride. Said just to change just to change our bodies. now that Abraham was looking for a promised son that was promised him. Is that right? And the church is looking for a promised son. The bride is looking for the promised son before the promised son could come to Sarah and Abraham. Their bodies had to be changed. He said, "Is that right?" said we cannot receive the promised son that's promised to us today in these bodies that we live in. These bodies are sin. So something has to happen to these bodies. &gt;&gt; There has to be another law that takes precedent over the law of sin and death. And the apostle Paul has already told us that the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made us free. Not will hath made us free &gt;&gt; from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; And so it's another body and we are taking this body to immortality. &gt;&gt; Literally, &gt;&gt; you're either doing that or you're living in a body that's just going to keel over someday. You are taking this body. I got all kinds of all kinds of proof for that. &gt;&gt; You can't even interpret the scripture any other way. &gt;&gt; Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a conscious decision. Put you on &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. Who is he? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Well, how I can't put on all of the Bible. Didn't say the Bible. The Lord Jesus Christ. That's him. that's revealed. And that same Lord Jesus Christ came through one man to point us to the scriptures for you. You you and I are not ignorant concerning the word that's been given to us, friends. And so when we hear it and there's something that witnesses inside that's for my time, then I say that is your that that's your theme, friends. &gt;&gt; That's your theme. So he says and he goes into the first conscience of the body feel taste meal uh smell and hear and so on and is this all going to pass away. So then he goes on to say that this body is subject to death and will die. But the inside part of you, not just the inside part, but the inside part of you down in here inside, that is the person that cannot die. &gt;&gt; That's not just some illusionary, you know, feeling or substance or something. That's a person he said that cannot die. &gt;&gt; You you see you're you're a dual person really because you have the body that you're sitting in here now which came your mother and father under the laws of natural life and it will surely die unless it's changed. But you have another person inside and this is what he says. Listen. And that's the person that the new life starts from from this new life and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life. &gt;&gt; Now I know maybe only 10% of you got that. I'm going by the words of a prophet saying you have another life person in you now. &gt;&gt; And he speaks he says and I have a very he makes a very profound statement and that that's the person that the new life starts from. That's when you're born again. And from this from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person that you are &gt;&gt; around that life. Isn't it marvelous? &gt;&gt; He says so puts it all together so beautifully. Other places God took a picture of you &gt;&gt; when you were in the prime of your life. That's the image that he's talking about. &gt;&gt; Says, "And that will build another person. It's going to build a person in the image that you are." Oh my, &gt;&gt; it's so far. It's so rich. &gt;&gt; And then he goes on to say, here's the statements. So potentially, potentially it's in here. See, if it if it's cell upon cell, let me just take my time for a few moments. &gt;&gt; If it's cell upon cell, those cells must be word. He said, it's not one human cell, a dog cell, a horse cell, another cell. It's all the same cell. And he says, this has to be word upon word upon word. Listen friends, it's not the coupon package that you got in the mail that we look at. That's not a sale. It's not your phone bill or your hydro bill or your mortgage payment. That's not a cell of this life. And don't don't get me wrong. I know that those affect us and they affect us big time. And I think if the economy goes the way uh they're talking about it going, it's going to affect a whole lot more of us, a whole lot deeper than we realize. We don't know. We don't know what it's going to be on down the road. But the one thing that I know for sure, this word &gt;&gt; will not fail us. &gt;&gt; This word &gt;&gt; is not going to fail us. &gt;&gt; We may live in a tent or a cottage, but this word, it says, I'll not see my children baking bread, &gt;&gt; will not fail us. this word that there's another man, another person inside of you, another life. You've been born again. You've had a new birth. You're another person inside. But the only thing that can build that person up is not what you get in tomorrow morning's mail. It's a not not the next document you businessmen have to read. That is not that's going to pass away with this world. &gt;&gt; I said it emphatically going to pass away. Totally meaningless. The only thing you can live on is what has been spoken. and identified for this day as a promise for your hour. And now, brother Brandham used so many words. He calls it the promise of this day, the message of this hour. He's all pointing to the same thing. And that, my brother, my sister, is the only thing that will be cell upon cell and bring you to your immortality. &gt;&gt; God gave it here. That is the process. You know, wouldn't it be easy if we just sit here and say, "Well, you know, I just I just want to kind of enjoy life and, you know, have a great time and, you know, be happy and, you know, do my thing and have my have my uh, you know, my sports or my uh hunting or my whatever. I like to go fishing or something else. It's all fine. All fine. But none of that's going to put on immortality." Immortality is seeing what has been said &gt;&gt; and then you let the mind of Christ as that is Christ &gt;&gt; be in you &gt;&gt; and you put on Christ. &gt;&gt; So many people have an idea of the rapture as being kind of, you know, a a quick fast exit out of here. It's not what it is. It's not what it is. It's a group of redeemed people &gt;&gt; that are testifying by the life they live of the word of God for this hour. And they are a super race. The prophet said they're a super race. They're a different species. Of course, they're a different species because they come from a different kind. &gt;&gt; God wouldn't leave the image laid down there. He said he begin to build it up right quickly. He's going to build up that image. &gt;&gt; And Jesus when he come, he was the seed. &gt;&gt; He was the seed of God. &gt;&gt; He was the new breed. He was the new species. &gt;&gt; And they that are in him are of his kind. &gt;&gt; So I'm not just giving you a message now to uh to listen to this morning, but a challenge to go out from here. And when you hear the word, when you read a message, and God identifies something in there, that's for this time, you make a conscious decision. Say, I'm going to put that on. &gt;&gt; Might say, I never did that before. But you make a conscious decision. And I'll tell you one thing, by the authority of God's word, you are putting on immortal life. &gt;&gt; You are adding cell upon cell &gt;&gt; to that man, that new person that is in you. &gt;&gt; So potentially it's here just quickly now please. He said the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there he said it's only this only reflects the negative. So here we are whole group of people reflecting the negative that he said which he's referring to will reflect the positive the word and the same thing he says the same thing now the question was the mystery of the trans uh uh the the mystery of the translation of the of the bride. And so he says this reflects the negative. That which he just described inside which is growing reflects the positive. And he says in the translation of the bride will be the same thing. The word that's in you not coming to you but that's in you. &gt;&gt; The body will materialize around that word. And the same thing it did by Sarah. &gt;&gt; I want to emphasize it so strong that you cannot cannot escape it. When Jesus was moving through his life, the scriptures of Isaiah and of the psalmist was being materialized in him. He materialized that scripture and brought those scriptures to fulfillment. You are materializing &gt;&gt; the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; This is not just another church and not just another doctrine and not just another little theory and oh we got a prophet. Mormon's got a prophet. Muhammadan's got a prophet. Everybody's got a prophet. Prophet. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about a prophet that actually spoke original life, original word. &gt;&gt; Where'd you hear the serpent seed before? &gt;&gt; Not like this. &gt;&gt; You might found people thought, well, well, we used to believe it was even the Catholic church used to believe it was a it was a sexual experience back in back in Eden. That's not all. And even Rabbi Richmond says that. But when they say when he put it together and says this was Cain was the product. &gt;&gt; Oh, Rible Richmond said, "No, we we don't we don't teach that." And that startled him &gt;&gt; and set him into a deep deep we could communicate with him. He got so deep into his thoughts. Do you know why it's different? &gt;&gt; It's an original word. &gt;&gt; An original word is the original seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when Jesus was here and he came and he came walking into Jerusalem, Jerusalem is the very heart, the very wife of God. Going a little bit deeper. So, the seed of God moving into the very womb of his wife. And other seeds were there. Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, Romans, they all had their own. But he was the original sick. &gt;&gt; Nobody had come to conception like him. No one had been birthed like him. He was the original seed. And that is why we who who receive him, we receive original seed. He said, "Here's what I'm saying. The law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after his own kind according to Genesis 1:11." And we're we're the ones of that kind &gt;&gt; by virtue of and a and a message you may want to get into very very very heavy message is the spoken words the original seed be good for you to get into that just go through it slowly and prayerfully but now here we are in a strange time and I'm closing with this right up into our day, right into our time. The seed is very precious to God. The spirit of this age is one that desecrates the seed and perverts the people so that they would put it in the face of God. Now you have seed within you. You men have seed. The one movement that may well shut this church down someday is a homosexual movement which the government supports and and stands by and not only homosexual but the gay movement powerful movement very prevalent very prominent and the women and I don't speak I don't speak against the person I'm sorry they're caught in the web in the trap they But the man's seed throws it as it were in the face of God. And you're all adults. Where does that seed go? I would say it's an ultimate insult to God who put in his mind. And God attested to what he believed about seed because when Jesus came forth, Jesus said, "I've come from the bosom of the father." That's what God thinks about seed. The seed has come from the bosom of the father. That's God's thought about seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you have a whole movement of women, lesbianism, big thing. It's on the screens. It's on the movies. And that is simply, let me say it plain, wombs that refuse seed. And then you have the abortions and they the big subject is well when does the conception take place? What are we a bunch of idiots? &gt;&gt; When did Mary conceive? when she conceived, you'll conceive and you'll bring forth life. But the whole tenor and the whole theme today and you take all of those things and then take the birth control and take the machines that dispense condoms in schools. You can only come up with one thing, friends, and I'm go closing with this. It happens to be Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; who despises &gt;&gt; the seed of God, &gt;&gt; despises life. It wouldn't be so bad if someone wanted to despise it. And and people are there are unics. There are women that are and there's a great honor in the Bible. And I can tell you there's a great honor in the Bible of people that never married and served God and they had such a richful life. They actually served God and made those that had women and wives and families and all the rest of it because there's a certain burden with that. But brother Brandham never dealt in public about birth control because he dealt with individuals about birth control. But when you the whole sum in total I'm I'm I've spoken to you today on the law of reproduction. But there's massive movements in the world today that have no desire of even natural reproduction and they disdain disdain the seed and the process of law the of nature of the natural law. Having said that, then we have a very religious world and every one of them have a seed, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They have a seed. It's their doctrine. And the church that they serve is the wife, is the woman, but the doctrine. And that is why when brother Brandham was here and he was speaking to the priest and all of you that were former Catholics as I also was born in a Catholic home when brother Brandham got in discussion with them and the priest would say but the church says and brother Brandham says but the word says. What the church says the the the word says. What is happening really to put it in different language? One is saying but the woman says and he's saying but the man says. The woman says but the man says. The woman says but the man says. He was simply bringing the headship around where it was supposed to be. And now my brother my sister you want to go out of this place feeling very very blessed of God that you have already received the original seed &gt;&gt; and a prophet has declared that your womb is sealed. You have received it into the womb of your mind and dropped down into your soul and it's sealed and over with. And all you can do now is add to that cell upon cell, word upon word. That's the only function I have this morning. We're not here to build any kingdom. We're here to convey something to you that you can go out here and I'll just say to you, put it on. &gt;&gt; Put on the mind of Christ. put you on the Lord Jesus Christ. I repeat Apostle Paul's words to you as a challenge to this congregation. Let me go away from this pulpit saying it will be my last message. I'd say put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the only one &gt;&gt; that has immortality. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Father, what a serious moment. What a difficult time we're living in. What a dark time. No wonder your messenger cried out and said, "Gross darkness upon the people." So thankful, Father, I am thanking you for this audience and group of people that have taken their time. they have driven have come with expectation sitting in their seats sang the songs of worship oh God and now have sat and listened to the word I pray father I ask that this this whole entire message will have such a effect let it have an effect on a people when they leave here oh God I pray even if it's just one or to things that they encounter in your the voice that you sent in this hour that they will put it on. And throughout this week, there will be those of your dear children that you have put on that have put on the very eternal life, immortality for mortal mortality, you said must be swallowed up with immortality. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I wonder if there's some here say, I just want to identify myself. I would ask for prayer for this congregation to pray for me right where I'm at. You'd like to raise your hand where you are. just feel to do so if we could have musician maybe just play something softly. All right, [Music] whatever you do, friends, don't go out and just live the same patterns, the same order. It's a very, very, very serious hour that we're in. Let us live very close and snugged up to the word. Pray as you've never prayed before. Believe as you've never believed before. And ask that God would give you, give you the insight. Dear father, dear father, author of life, author of life. Out of your very bosom came the very concept of life. And when our Adam and Eve fell, Lord, then you sent forth another specy, another seed that would bring forth a super race. And you've been so kind, so faithful, oh God, to bring your word and to confirm it to us. We do not feel worthy for it, but you did it anyhow. Oh Lord, give us the give us the very simplicity of Mary that said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." And when we run into, Lord, when we read those words that you've left for us in this hour, each time I pray you'll put these words in the people's hearts and especially those that have their hands raised, may they identify, oh God, with the promise that you've made to them. If they're living below their standard, below their rights. Oh, lift them up, oh God, above every shadow and every doubt. I pray, Father, they they'll find the words in their lips. be it unto me according to thy word. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. Amen. If you'd stand with me. [Music] I wish I had a lot more experiences, but I have had a few. [Music] And just simple, I can tell you that it works. Awaiting emergency operation on my neck and the only place I could get any relief whatsoever, some hot water. And I just looked up and I was breaking emotionally a wee bit because of the excruciating pain. And I looked up and I said,"Lord, if thou wilt, thou can make me whole." And that was all my prayer. That's all I intended to say. And just through me, I had to say, I had to speak. I just uttered out. I actually cried it out. I will be thou whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You that attend this church knew I came here just after brother Charlie Drake passed away. And I was in the midst of that at that time at his funeral. It's the only function I was able to handle medicated in order to do it. But I came here, I couldn't pray, but I came here and stood behind this pullpit and said, "God said it." Brother Brandham indicates that standing at the river when it says and your message well as John the Baptist for ran the first coming your message he can he he says it very clearly it was his voice &gt;&gt; that spoke it cares whose voice it is &gt;&gt; as long as it comes from the Holy Ghost. I can tell you there's more power in you saying it and putting on the Lord Jesus Christ. Do that as a conscious a conscious decision throughout this week. And I I trust and pray that there will be hundreds and hundreds of conscious decisions. Mothers, young ladies, young men, school children, elders, we will say that and may we do it and thus be doers of the word, not hearers only. Amen. I had written down the only song I had written down and brother Rod got up and sang sang it. the love of God. But I think I have to sing a couple verses of it. Brother Rod, maybe you'll help me. Would you? And I in prayer, I said, "If every man on earth a scribe and the skies of parchment made, we couldn't and the in ocean was ink. We couldn't write the love of God has been extended to us. Someday we'll look back perhaps on this very meeting and say, "Well, I got something there." Precious brothers, sisters, children of God, let me say this to you. I will feel fully rewarded if something was spoken this morning that pushed you forward into your immortal life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to shake hands again someday. Not after the service with this body of this natural nature. I'll give it a hug, too, and shake your hand. But the one I want to shake hands with is the one that's growing on the inside. &gt;&gt; That's the one I want to shake hand with. Are you with me? All right, let's just sing a love of God is great. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Yeah. [Music] Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
