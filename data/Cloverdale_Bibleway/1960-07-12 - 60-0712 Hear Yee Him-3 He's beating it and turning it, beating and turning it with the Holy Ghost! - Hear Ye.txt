Description:
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chastising his church and cleaning it out that's what God wants to do the old beaters of gold you know how they used to know it was real good gold they would take that gold and would beat it and beat it and turn it and beat it till they beat all the draws out of it you know how they know when they got their draw out of it when they seen their own reflection in it then they know that all the pyite and stuff was out of it all the rock and materials was out with pure gold when the beater could see his reflection that's the way Christ is doing to him Church he's beating it and turning it and beating it and turning it and beating it how dare a preacher to be siy enough not to tell the word of God and tell men and women when they're living wrong it's wrong to wear these immoral clothes it's wrong to smoke cigarettes it's wrong to stay home from church it's wrong to go to gambling and racing and carrying on the way the church is doing today and playing lotteries and things God forbid when I have to do that no sir be that thing until Jesus beats it with the Holy Ghost until he sees his own reflection in it then you can see the works of Christ being performed in the church
