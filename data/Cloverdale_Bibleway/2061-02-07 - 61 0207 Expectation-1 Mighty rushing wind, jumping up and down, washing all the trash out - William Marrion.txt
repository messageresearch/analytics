TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the Revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now Revival isn't adding new members to the church it's Reviving that what we've already got to revive means to bring back so a Revival I stood here some years ago for my first time by a large body of water which was Lake Michigan I was about just has been ordained in the Missionary Baptist Church I was about 20 21 years old and I went up there when they had the they had some great Easter Sunrise Service out on the Lakes side and I was acquainted with Paul Raider and he was supposed to speak at that meeting and I wanted to visit the Tabernacle while I was in Chicago and for my first time to see that larger body of water and I went out on a Lake Shore Drive and I stood out there a little while and I noticed all them waves jumping up and down just just flashing around I thought what's you so excited about what's all the excitement and uh the little waves to start and then run out and beig great big waves and bounce into each other and break a partner and the foam would fly up and then it come back in and I'm see the big waves coming again breaking on the bank like you're used to here but that was something new for for me uh a landlock servant so I noticed how I so what it must must be that the Lakes having a Revival that must be what it is kind a big time just jumping up and down I thought that's that's good that's fine but you know I I thought well once he gets a lot of EX water when it's having Revival well no there isn't one drop more in it right now that it's perfectly calm not one bit it's the same water but just having a Revival jumping up and down I thought what good does that do come to find out when it's having Revival and jumping up down like that it washes all the trash out of it up on the shore that's what the church needs is a Revival get all the world and things out the world washed out so it can look clear be pretty again when it all comes down it's got the same amount of water but what causes the seed to do that is because there is a wind come is to blow against the waves goow against the body of water and pick it up well that's what the church needs tonight is some mighty Russian wind coming out upon it again and Reviving it and getting all the world out and the things of the world out and that way then it starts a Revival and then when it settles down the church is all in condition then to start off then to receive spiritual gifts and blessings from God and that's what we want but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the Prophets
