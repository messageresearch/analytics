[0:00] Psalm
[0:01] 139 to the chief musician a Psalm of
[0:04] David oh Lord thou Hast searched me and
[0:08] known me thou knowest my downsitting and
[0:11] mine Uprising thou understandest my
[0:13] thought a far off thou compassest my
[0:16] path and my lying down and art
[0:18] acquainted with all my ways for there is
[0:20] not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord
[0:24] thou knowest it all together thou Hast
[0:27] beset me behind and before and laid hand
[0:30] upon me such knowledge is too wonderful
[0:32] for me it is high I cannot attain unto
[0:35] it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or
[0:38] wither shall I flee from thy presence if
[0:41] I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there
[0:44] if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art
[0:47] there if I take the wings of the morning
[0:50] and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
[0:52] sea even there shall thy hand lead me
[0:54] and thy right hand shall hold me if I
[0:57] say surely the darkness shall cover me
[1:00] even the night shall be light about me
[1:02] yay the darkness hideth not from thee
[1:05] but the night shineth as the day the
[1:07] darkness and the light are both alike to
[1:09] thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns
[1:12] thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb
[1:15] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:17] and wonderfully made marvelous of thy
[1:19] works and that my soul knoweth right
[1:22] well my substance was not hid from thee
[1:25] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:27] wrought in the lowest parts of the Earth
[1:29] Thine Eyes did see my substance yet
[1:32] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[1:34] members were written which in
[1:36] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:38] there was none of them how precious also
[1:41] are thy thoughts unto me oh God how
[1:44] great is the sum of them if I should
[1:46] count them they are more in number than
[1:48] the sand when I awake I am still with
[1:51] thee surely thou Wilt slay the wicked oh
[1:54] God
