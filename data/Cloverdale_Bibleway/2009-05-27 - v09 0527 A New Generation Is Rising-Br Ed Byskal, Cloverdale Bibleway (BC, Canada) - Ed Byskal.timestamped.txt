[0:14] the the only limit really is the number
[0:16] of translations that's in that language.
[0:18] We have a desktop version of the message
[0:21] hub. Now, this is a a CD that's taken a
[0:25] snapshot of what's available online.
[0:27] They can log on to that uh website. they
[0:29] could download that message that you
[0:31] submitted within the previous uh let's
[0:34] say 24 48 hours and they could print off
[0:37] that book and have that book in their
[0:39] hand to read and study. Well, the
[0:41] message hub is um u a place where a
[0:47] person can uh that's translated the
[0:49] message can put the message online and
[0:51] then someone elsewhere who wishes to uh
[0:55] read or or uh hear that message. They
[0:59] can then log on onto the internet and
[1:02] download that uh that message. Do you
[1:04] need any special privileges to log on
[1:06] and download?
[1:07] &gt;&gt; No privileges whatsoever. You just you
[1:09] you just log on to the u uh message uh
[1:13] hub uh website and uh you will come to
[1:17] the homepage and it'll list all the
[1:18] languages that the messages are um are
[1:22] available and you click on the language
[1:24] that you desire. It will then take you
[1:26] to uh those messages and you can select
[1:29] whichever one you wish. You uh click on
[1:32] that you can download it and print off a
[1:33] booklet.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So is there any limit to the
[1:37] number of books that I can print with
[1:38] that?
[1:38] &gt;&gt; There's there's no limit whatsoever and
[1:41] uh uh the only limit really is the
[1:44] number of translations that's in that
[1:45] language.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; So in you know in the present uh time we
[1:50] have something like 363 messages in
[1:53] Spanish. Uh we have uh uh 844 English
[1:58] books uh available for printing off the
[2:01] internet.
[2:02] uh we have uh uh 300 and some French uh
[2:06] books as well uh quite a number of of
[2:10] Finnish and and so on. So whatever
[2:12] languages uh that you know you have you
[2:15] can you can print off.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Great. So let's talk about translators
[2:18] for a moment. Uh, let's say I'm a
[2:20] translator and I I'm working in a
[2:23] particular language and I've got a
[2:25] handful of translations
[2:28] and I want to be able to make those
[2:29] available to other people that speak my
[2:31] language around the world. What's my
[2:33] process? What do I do? Well, the first
[2:35] thing you would do is is uh um you know,
[2:38] if you're working together with a local
[2:40] ministry, you would contact uh uh
[2:42] contact us and uh you could submit the
[2:45] uh the files directly to us or you could
[2:47] have uh a contributor login status and
[2:50] and in that case, you can upload them
[2:52] yourself and then from the upload uh
[2:56] state and then then uh they're uh
[2:59] reviewed and approved and they'll be
[3:01] online probably within 24 hours. So now
[3:04] my translations as a as a translator in
[3:07] some part of the world um my
[3:09] translations are available to anybody
[3:11] anywhere in the world now
[3:12] &gt;&gt; anybody anywhere if if people from your
[3:15] uh country or speaking the language that
[3:17] you're translating into or or or clean
[3:19] you know on the other side of the world
[3:21] they can log on to that uh website they
[3:24] can download that message that you
[3:25] submitted within the previous uh let's
[3:28] say 24 48 hours and they could print off
[3:31] that book and have that book in their
[3:33] hand to read and study.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; To me, that's very exciting.
[3:36] &gt;&gt; That is very exciting.
[3:37] &gt;&gt; That's great. So, now we have how many
[3:41] languages on the website? About 40.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; We have 40 languages represented on the
[3:45] website. And uh the total number of of
[3:49] books available in those 40 languages
[3:52] amount to 3,225 at this time.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; That's fantastic. And in all of the
[3:59] books that are printed around the world,
[4:00] you have different countries that uh are
[4:03] represented by people that come and log
[4:04] onto the website. Are there some
[4:06] statistics that you have on that? Uh the
[4:09] last I checked uh uh over a twoe period,
[4:11] we had uh 706 different cities that uh
[4:16] we had uh uh visits from uh representing
[4:20] uh 85 different countries and in 35
[4:22] different languages.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Well, that's fantastic. And the
[4:25] downloads, the total downloads were over
[4:28] 5,000 over the past 2 weeks. Uh, of
[4:31] which, uh, 2,000 were in the Spanish
[4:33] language.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Tell me a little bit about the desktop
[4:36] version that you have available.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, the problem with, uh, as you
[4:39] know with the internet, it's not
[4:41] available in all places of the world,
[4:43] right? and and a lot of the demand for
[4:45] for books in in different translated
[4:48] languages are in countries where uh
[4:51] internet access and you know it's just
[4:54] not reliable. So what we have set up is
[4:58] print stations in in different uh areas
[5:01] and um we have a desktop version of the
[5:05] message hub. Now, this is a a CD that's
[5:09] taken a snapshot of what's available
[5:11] online at a particular time and then
[5:13] sent to these uh different print
[5:15] stations and then they can uh access the
[5:20] files and print off the books.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; So, they in they in essence are loading
[5:24] the message out directly on their
[5:26] computer
[5:26] &gt;&gt; directly onto their computer. Now we uh
[5:29] on on the desktop version there's 34
[5:31] different languages uh represented uh
[5:33] because the the only files that are on
[5:36] there are the book files.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's great. So we have
[5:40] &gt;&gt; and of course we with that we we don't
[5:42] know the number of books printed from
[5:45] them because we have no access to those
[5:47] stats. So, you know, having in the past
[5:50] 2 weeks those 5,000 uh downloads from
[5:54] the various print stations, uh you know,
[5:57] we're sending out uh 60 different uh uh
[6:00] discs to different locations around the
[6:02] world right now. So, there's a lot of
[6:04] books being printed.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; So, there's a lot to be done.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot to be done.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of uploading to be done by
[6:10] yourself and various people that you're
[6:12] in touch with. And there's 6,000
[6:14] languages in the world. There's 40
[6:17] available on the hub. There's a lot of
[6:19] work yet to be done.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; There's there's there is a a lot of
[6:22] work. The uh one thing I might mention
[6:25] is on those countries represented uh uh
[6:28] logged on, there was uh the latest stats
[6:31] showed that every country except for
[6:34] just a few in the central part of Asia
[6:37] had somebody log on to the internet to
[6:40] view that site. And that is amazing
[6:43] really. I mean, we're we're virtually
[6:45] covering the whole world. Well, the
[6:46] message hub has only been available for
[6:48] less than a year.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; That's correct. Since uh uh June, I
[6:52] believe, was uh I came on board in in
[6:54] first part of December and uh June, I
[6:57] think, was the uh the beta version of
[6:59] the of the hub.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ken, we certainly look
[7:02] forward to another update and another
[7:03] report and more statistics on where
[7:05] around the world the message hub is
[7:07] being accessed. Well, we're we're uh
[7:09] we've got some exciting things happening
[7:12] and we're looking for uh some more
[7:14] exciting things and and I'll be happy to
[7:16] give an update in the future. Wonderful.
[7:18] Thanks for being with us today. Thank
[7:19] you. All right. God bless you.

[17:21] Amen. Praise the Lord. Are you thankful
[17:22] for what he's done for you tonight?
[17:24] Let's just praise him and thank him for
[17:26] what he's done. for so much that you've
[17:29] done for us. Father, we just come to
[17:31] worship you this evening.
[17:33] Glory to your name, Lord. You are great,
[17:38] wonderful savior.
[17:46] We're going to sing, you are great. You
[17:48] do miracles so great. And then I'm going
[17:49] to ask brother Bob Hansen if he'll come
[17:52] and lead us in prayer just after this
[17:55] song.
[17:57] Amen. He's great. He does miracles. So
[17:59] great
[18:01] for each one of us.
[18:04] I was watching this
[18:06] just recently. What the church has done
[18:09] here, put together something was called
[18:11] the Beth Dingwall miracle. I hadn't seen
[18:14] it for 10 years since we had it here.
[18:16] It's a miracle.
[18:18] And if you haven't seen it, you might
[18:20] want to see it again. And Beth's my
[18:22] sister-in-law. And some of that stuff I
[18:24] didn't I didn't remember. I didn't know
[18:26] or just want to praise God for what he's
[18:29] done when he does a miracle. Want to
[18:31] praise him. And there was something in
[18:34] there that she said,
[18:36] I saw myself sitting on a green couch.
[18:37] Maybe some of you remember this. And
[18:40] there was a doctor and he was dressed a
[18:42] certain way and he said certain thing.
[18:45] And then brother Kim on the on the on
[18:47] the video said, "You know that green
[18:49] couch when Beth saw that that green
[18:51] couch wasn't there.
[18:54] They'd remodeled the hotel and when it
[18:56] actually or the hospital and when it
[18:57] actually happened just as she saw it,
[19:01] then it all came to pass.
[19:03] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, that sounds pretty
[19:04] familiar to some stories I've heard.
[19:08] Something that I've
[19:10] heard brother Brandham say
[19:13] it's the same God.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we believe that.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; And if that God isn't here tonight, then
[19:21] what are we doing here?
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus is real. Then
[19:28] &gt;&gt; he's great.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; He does miracles so great. So let's sing
[19:32] it to him tonight.
[19:36] Oh, you are great.
[19:40] You do miracles so great.
[19:44] There is no one else like you.
[19:51] There is no one else like you. You are
[19:56] great.
[19:58] You do miracles so great. There is no
[20:03] one else like you.
[20:06] [Music]
[20:09] There is no one else like you.
[20:16] Oh, you deserve the glory
[20:21] and the honor.
[20:25] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[20:30] and we praise your holy name.
[20:36] All the glory Lord
[20:40] and the honor
[20:44] [Applause]
[20:46] and praise your name.
[21:03] There is no
[21:06] like you. You are
[21:10] you.
[21:14] There is no one else like you.
[21:20] There is no
[21:24] like
[21:25] [Music]
[21:28] you are.
[21:30] [Music]
[21:34] There is no
[21:37] like
[21:38] [Music]
[21:44] you are great.
[21:51] There is no one else like you.
[21:57] There is no one else like you.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to come into his courts
[22:08] with thanksgiving and praise.
[22:12] We have some requests,
[22:15] different folks. They're sick. They're
[22:18] needing salvation. They're needing
[22:19] healing. A man we want to pray for needs
[22:23] to be healed of liver failure as well.

[35:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Good. It's going to good to have
[35:54] that confession. All right. And before
[35:57] uh we read the scripture, I'll just
[35:58] allow you to have your seats for a few
[36:00] moments. Oh, there's our brother Joe
[36:03] Riley. God bless you, brother Riley. You
[36:05] know he's up here for his 90th birthday.
[36:09] [Music]
[36:14] Now you stand brother
[36:17] stand up.
[36:25] It's wonderful to be
[36:28] uh a seasoned senior and still have all
[36:32] the mobility to drive or get on planes
[36:35] or whatever more. And uh my wife and I
[36:39] just driving to church night and we were
[36:40] talking about your brother Joe and she
[36:42] looked at me she says she said to me
[36:44] you're a young man.
[36:47] Well I I started doing some mathematics
[36:50] and
[36:52] yes amen. We're all young
[36:57] &gt;&gt; by faith and according to the word we
[37:01] should have the substance
[37:03] &gt;&gt; substance faith. Well, I just want to
[37:05] give you a little bit of a
[37:09] not a report as such, but to just let
[37:11] you know a wee bit of the things that
[37:13] are taking place just now. Uh the uh the
[37:18] message hub, it's just remarkable. Our
[37:21] brother Ken Buckles,
[37:24] uh he has been working very very
[37:26] diligently and loading up the messages
[37:29] as they come in. And uh and uh I just
[37:33] wanted to have these statistics so I
[37:35] could give it to the people in Germany
[37:37] this weekend at their they have their
[37:40] Pentecost convention. Brother Gear Roald
[37:42] has his down in in Beaslesburg and then
[37:47] uh brother deer and brother Pankin and
[37:50] another brother uh the three churches
[37:53] have come together and they will have
[37:54] one just out of doozled where the Lord
[37:56] willing I will be with them. So, we just
[37:59] wanted to let them know uh as of May the
[38:04] 24th,
[38:07] we the books that were available
[38:10] are a total of uh 3,299
[38:16] books which are available.
[38:19] And then, of course, there's quite a few
[38:21] that are available for MP3 downloading
[38:23] as well.
[38:25] um
[38:27] in the uh Spanish this is in the period
[38:30] of time of May 1 209
[38:35] to May 24th 209 we just took about three
[38:39] four lang languages
[38:42] uh 4,399
[38:44] books were printed in uh I mean these
[38:47] are individuals this isn't mass printing
[38:49] 4,399
[38:51] in the Spanish language
[38:54] Spanish people pulling it down. English
[38:57] 2948,
[38:59] French 285
[39:02] and uh then uh on down less and less
[39:05] because we have less and less messages
[39:08] and when you realize this has only been
[39:10] known for about a year and some of these
[39:12] countries are just hearing about it
[39:14] right now for the first time and some uh
[39:17] Prince stations have just gone into
[39:19] Ghana and brother DJ was there. Uh some
[39:23] more are going into Tanzania. Brother
[39:25] Barry Coffee just returned from being
[39:28] with brother Zephaniah Peters and uh
[39:31] they had a a a meeting with the
[39:34] different translators. So I just thought
[39:36] I would give you that. And then
[39:40] uh MP3s that were downloaded was over
[39:43] 2500. We're talking about 3 weeks.
[39:48] Uh over the past 30 days, there have
[39:50] been 7,495
[39:53] visits to the website and 3,140
[39:56] of those are absolute unique visitors.
[39:59] That is that's a a uh one address.
[40:04] Even if that address was on that that uh
[40:07] computer address, even if that address
[40:09] was on many times, it would only count
[40:12] for one time. uh 3140
[40:16] absolute unique addresses.
[40:19] Uh there's uh 241
[40:23] visits per day and the average time that
[40:27] people are staying on is is uh over
[40:30] about five almost 5 and a/4 minutes and
[40:34] the number of page views was over
[40:36] 103,000.
[40:38] So I think that was really remarkable.
[40:41] And here here's what is really
[40:42] outstanding. If you were, brother Ken
[40:44] Buckles was telling me if you saw the
[40:46] entire globe and it it's colored where
[40:50] visits have come from and so on the
[40:52] countries there's only a small round
[40:56] spot in way up in central Asia and China
[41:01] that has not been receiving hits from
[41:04] the hub.
[41:06] And uh of the of the 7,495
[41:11] visits, they came from 1,14
[41:15] cities
[41:18] and they came from 107 countries
[41:22] and they used 41 different languages.
[41:25] We're talking about three weeks.
[41:28] I think that's really quite remarkable.
[41:30] I thank the Lord that we're allowed
[41:33] [Music]
[41:38] And we thank God for people that are
[41:40] translating and people who are
[41:43] proofreading and all the many many hours
[41:45] that are going into this and the people
[41:48] here who have worked labored real hard.
[41:51] Brother Kim and brother Darren
[41:56] and brother especially our brother Kent
[41:58] Buckles who has taken over the whole
[42:01] pretty much the administration of it.
[42:02] We're really thankful for that. I got an
[42:05] email yesterday. Uh, brother Murphy just
[42:09] heard from the interior part of China.
[42:12] You remember about, let's say, a week
[42:13] and a half ago. You remember the
[42:15] pictures we showed? We showed the
[42:18] pictures of the brothers and they Well,
[42:21] it's the same brothers now and they're
[42:23] on the move again. And uh, God did some
[42:27] God works in strange ways. There's one
[42:30] of the brothers whose father is not a
[42:32] believer
[42:33] and his father uh has a bit of an
[42:37] alcohol problem. So he was caught
[42:40] driving while he was drunk and he got
[42:42] his sus license suspended for 4 months.
[42:46] So his son who works with brother we and
[42:48] they go out and deliver message books
[42:51] and and and tapes and all the rest of
[42:54] it. He asked, "Well, can you know, can I
[42:56] use your SUV for nice four-wheel drive
[43:00] SUV? Can I use it for 4 months?" Well,
[43:03] what he says, "Well, what can I do?" So,
[43:06] they they gave him the SUV to use, and
[43:09] they they took off right away. And they
[43:12] were way up in the interior, way into
[43:14] the rural area of China to some of the
[43:18] tribal people. And uh and up there there
[43:22] was a brother that wanted to be baptized
[43:25] and when I got there there were six more
[43:27] and he was not baptized yet and he came
[43:30] to the message from the internet
[43:33] and so he thought that the internet was
[43:35] such a tool. So he started using the
[43:37] internet and started reaching these
[43:38] other people with the message and so
[43:40] then they wanted to be baptized. So
[43:43] these brothers that went up there they
[43:44] had to baptize all of them. And I we've
[43:46] got pictures of them, but I just haven't
[43:48] got time tonight to put it all together.
[43:51] And uh and then there was a a a woman
[43:54] from uh from a a a home church, and I
[43:58] don't know whether that's a government
[43:59] church or what it is, but she uh she
[44:02] asked the brothers to come there, and
[44:04] they had left some books there before,
[44:06] and they wanted some more and more
[44:09] contact with the message. And all I can
[44:12] tell you is that uh God knows how to
[44:15] find the elect
[44:17] wherever they are.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; And to think we can sit here and just be
[44:22] a part of it somehow. Be a part of it
[44:25] regardless of how small or how big it
[44:27] is. And all you young people, the senior
[44:30] young people who've been engaged in
[44:32] getting those uh books done off of the
[44:35] tapes so they can be loaded. Uh, it's a
[44:39] marvelous thing. Whatever you do, don't
[44:41] slow down.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; That's good. Sounds Sounds good. Thanks,
[44:49] brother Isaac. Uh, and we have I know
[44:53] that Brother Mark and Sister Debbie
[44:55] already been welcomed, but they've come
[44:58] home
[45:00] at least for a visit. We're pulling on
[45:03] them real hard. and we've got different
[45:06] ways of to do things.
[45:10] Brother Mark said to Debbie, we love you
[45:13] both and so happy that you're here
[45:16] and I trust you have a wonderful time
[45:18] while you're staying here.
[45:21] And take our greetings back to Brother
[45:24] Prader and the and the church there and
[45:26] the saints and your parents, Sister
[45:29] Debbie. We just have so much affection
[45:32] for them. Well, we are going to get
[45:35] right to the word now. And if you'll
[45:37] stand, thank you. That'll be sufficient.
[45:41] And just before we read, I'm going to be
[45:43] reading in the book of Numbers, but
[45:46] we'll have a prayer and then we'll turn
[45:49] to the word of God.
[45:52] Gracious, loving heavenly father. It's
[45:56] just such a wonderful atmosphere this
[45:58] evening, Lord. And we are so conscious
[46:02] and aware of your presence. We're
[46:04] thankful for that, Lord. We pray your
[46:07] blessings, oh God, upon the people that
[46:10] have gathered this evening. We've
[46:13] gathered here, Father, sincerely.
[46:16] We've gathered here seriously. We're
[46:19] here because we want to hear words by
[46:23] the Holy Spirit. Bring it down to the
[46:26] innermost region of our being into our
[46:30] soul. Oh God, I pray that if there is uh
[46:34] those here that may just have a ember
[46:37] burning, I pray that the wind of the
[46:39] Holy Spirit will blow upon those embers
[46:43] and cause it to burst into a flame. Oh
[46:46] God, let it be like fire that he that
[46:49] Jeremiah experienced and had in his
[46:51] bones and he couldn't keep his mouth
[46:54] quiet anymore. He had to speak. Oh God,
[46:57] may the witness of your people go far
[47:00] and wide, I pray. And may the word this
[47:03] evening, Lord, burn in the hearts of the
[47:06] people. Let it burn in my own heart, oh
[47:08] God. And as I pondered and prayed about
[47:11] these things, I pray Lord that you will
[47:13] make it just such a reality to the
[47:16] people this evening. And bless us as we
[47:18] dwell together and rejoice in unity,
[47:21] Father of the Spirit. For when they were
[47:24] in one accord, in one place, that's
[47:26] where the Holy Spirit was so pleased to
[47:28] come. Come, oh God, come and be pleased
[47:32] to be amongst us. Now take control, I
[47:35] pray. Father, may I speak just what you
[47:37] have in mind and the people will receive
[47:40] it. I know in Jesus Christ's name and
[47:43] for his glory alone. Amen. Amen. And all
[47:46] the people said, "Amen."
[47:49] We'll turn to Numbers the 14th chapter
[47:52] and beginning to read at the first verse
[47:55] down to verse 9.
[47:58] And all the congregation lifted up their
[48:00] voice and cried, and the people wept
[48:04] that night. And all the children of
[48:06] Israel murmured against Moses and
[48:08] against Aaron. And the whole
[48:11] congregation said unto them,
[48:16] Would God that we had died in the land
[48:18] of Egypt? Or would God we had died in
[48:21] this wilderness? And wherefore hath the
[48:24] Lord brought us unto this land to fall
[48:27] by the sword that our wives and our
[48:29] children should be prey a prey? were it
[48:32] not better for us to return into Egypt?
[48:36] And they said one to another, let us
[48:38] make a captain, and let us return into
[48:40] Egypt. And then Moses and Aaron fell on
[48:43] their faces before all the assembly of
[48:45] the congregation of the children of
[48:46] Israel. And Joshua the son of Nun, and
[48:50] Caleb the son of Jeffona, uh, which were
[48:53] of them that search the land, rent their
[48:56] clothes. And they spake unto all the
[48:58] company of the children of Israel,
[49:00] saying, The land which we pass through
[49:02] to search it is an exceeding good land.
[49:06] If the Lord delight in us, then he will
[49:08] bring us into this land, and giveth us a
[49:12] land which flowth with milk and honey.
[49:14] Only rebel not ye against the Lord.
[49:17] Neither fear ye the people of the land.
[49:20] For they are bred for us. Their defenses
[49:23] departed from them and the Lord is with
[49:26] us. Fear them not.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seats. Uh
[49:34] I want to move along real quickly and I
[49:36] thank you for your kind attention. Now
[49:38] last Wednesday, brother John Andes was
[49:41] speaking. I believe it was Wednesday or
[49:43] was it Sunday? I lose track of things
[49:45] but and he was speaking from Numbers 13,
[49:48] the 13th chapter and went over into the
[49:51] 14th chapter. Of course, what brother
[49:53] John did not know is that I've been
[49:55] studying and looking to the Lord for
[49:58] perhaps the last three weeks on chapter
[50:02] 14 because I was impressed to speak
[50:05] about a new generation. And so I'm
[50:08] taking a subject tonight so that you can
[50:11] remember uh the content uh a new
[50:15] generation is rising.
[50:18] Uh, and I really I I really do believe
[50:21] that now this place where they were at
[50:25] here is at Kadesh Barnea. And brother
[50:27] John had a very fine map up and to show
[50:30] you for those of you that were here,
[50:31] you'll benefit from having seen the map
[50:34] to see where their wanderings were. And
[50:37] uh then when they uh refused to go into
[50:40] the land which was just a very short
[50:42] distance uh then they h they wandered
[50:45] for uh many years. Actually it is said
[50:49] uh it is thought that uh that they
[50:52] looked upon Kadesh as perhaps a like a
[50:55] headquarters because they spent largely
[50:57] 38 years at uh at Kadesh Barneal before
[51:02] they went in. And I think from the time
[51:04] they came out of Egypt to the time that
[51:07] they arrived at Kadesh was about 13
[51:10] months. If you look on uh on uh
[51:13] Scoffield uh in his uh he has the the
[51:17] years of the of of the books where and
[51:21] the events that are happening and it
[51:24] shows that it's about a year's time from
[51:28] so the children of Israel spent about a
[51:30] year and I'm not into all the statistics
[51:33] as such but uh and then they spent the
[51:36] rest of their time mostly at at Kadesh
[51:38] Barnea. So Kades Borne is a very very
[51:41] significant
[51:43] uh part of the scripture a very
[51:45] significant part because of the events
[51:48] that took place and the events that took
[51:50] place there have a great deal of
[51:52] importance to us as individuals. Brother
[51:56] Brandham said uh concerning this he said
[51:59] perfect of the church today today in our
[52:02] journeying we're journeying up till I
[52:05] believe that the church is standing
[52:07] today at Kadesh Barnea judgment I hope
[52:11] God will help me to get this it'll sink
[52:14] in good and deep and remember they had
[52:18] come this far because God had promised
[52:21] them and all along the line they had
[52:24] signs and wonders and miracle miracles.
[52:26] Of course, the prophet of God is simply
[52:29] paralleling that with his own ministry.
[52:31] It's right here. It wasn't just back
[52:33] there, but it was right here. And so,
[52:35] they had signs and wonders and miracles,
[52:39] and now they're right up to the
[52:41] borderland. Now, Brother Brand, I'm
[52:43] saying that because the people he was
[52:45] talking to were exactly there.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; They're right at the borderland also.
[52:50] And the reason why he said kades barnea
[52:53] judgment because if they didn't go in it
[52:56] was only death because they don't go in
[52:58] because of unbelief. And I can say to
[53:00] you very few of you perhaps even I knew
[53:04] about brother Brandham and the prophet's
[53:06] ministry and the message uh not very
[53:08] many years ago. And the multitudes that
[53:11] were there and the multitudes that did
[53:13] hear and the multitudes that did see
[53:15] didn't go in
[53:16] &gt;&gt; for the most part did not go in. And so
[53:20] uh so what was it? It was Katie's Barnea
[53:22] judgment is what it was. And where are
[53:25] they today?
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Gone.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Just gone. The world has swallowed them
[53:31] up. The earth has swallowed them up
[53:35] &gt;&gt; exactly as it was. So there's two things
[53:38] of great significance that results from
[53:41] Kadesh Barnea. I want to follow what I
[53:45] have written down here uh just to lay a
[53:48] good foundation for you. And the first
[53:50] one there's two things and the first one
[53:52] is it was here at Kadesh Barnea that God
[53:56] made a distinction of those that would
[53:59] go in and those that would not go in.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; And he used the term from 20 years old
[54:06] and upward.
[54:09] uh from 20 years old and upward and 20
[54:12] years old and downward they would they
[54:14] would go in and those are 20 years old
[54:17] and upward uh would not go in. I I I I
[54:23] got thinking the way my mind goes. I was
[54:24] just wondering about the fellow who
[54:26] turned 21 a week before this was said.
[54:29] But anyway, we leave that there.
[54:33] I that'd be kind of unhappy experience,
[54:36] wouldn't it? He just say,
[54:37] &gt;&gt; "Oh,
[54:40] now in the first chapter, uh you won't
[54:43] have to turn to it, but if you care to
[54:46] look at it, it's just uh uh God tells
[54:49] Moses in the first chapter numbers."
[54:53] He tells them to number the children of
[54:56] Israel. And what he tells them to do is
[54:58] take the take the sum of all the
[55:01] congregation of the children of Israel
[55:04] after their families and by the house of
[55:07] their fathers uh with the number of
[55:10] their names every male by their poles
[55:13] from 20 years old up at 20 years old and
[55:17] upward. All that are able to go forth to
[55:21] war in Israel. Thou and Aaron shall
[55:24] number them by their armies. And so this
[55:27] is what happens in numbers the first
[55:29] chapter and this is where the
[55:30] 20-year-old figure comes that where that
[55:33] number comes from. So you'll number all
[55:35] the 12 tribes and you'll you'll uh take
[55:39] a a tally of them all and all the men
[55:42] that are 20 years old and upward who are
[55:46] who are able to go to war. We we want an
[55:49] account of those. And so they were the
[55:52] ones who were given the privilege. I
[55:55] want I want to it's not drafting them
[55:58] into the army because the word of God
[56:01] had given the promise.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; You shall have the land.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; I am giving it to you. And these are the
[56:09] first people that had the honor,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; the privilege of going in and taking it.
[56:15] And listen, you've got a message that
[56:17] you're rejoicing in. You've got a land
[56:19] that you're rejoicing in. You've got
[56:21] benefits that you have and this was
[56:23] offered to people years ago and they
[56:26] turned it down.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Think of that.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; There were others. It's exactly this
[56:33] this instance this those events these
[56:36] events are replicated today. And these
[56:40] people were given the privilege and and
[56:42] given the honor and the commission to go
[56:45] in and there's wonderful benefits. Yes,
[56:48] there's there you're going to have
[56:50] battles, but you're going to have
[56:51] victories.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; And you're going to be led by Joshua.
[56:54] You're going to have uh uh Joshua and
[56:56] Caleb, the two spies that came out, and
[56:59] you'll go in and you'll win this and
[57:01] you'll take possession. They were the
[57:03] first ones given the privilege to have a
[57:06] their portion of the inheritance. And
[57:09] they turned that down. And so when they
[57:11] turned God's promise down, turned God
[57:14] down, then God just said, "Well, now
[57:18] you've said that your children and your
[57:20] wives are just going to be pray for the
[57:22] enemy. Now you will not go in."
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why the 38 years of just uh
[57:28] milling around there because they stayed
[57:30] there till they all died.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus referred to there,
[57:36] everyone dead. And brother Brandham
[57:38] repeats it dozens of times there
[57:40] everyone dead and this is where it all
[57:43] happened and that's why it was judgment
[57:45] for one but what a blessing for others
[57:48] now it was 20 years old and upward and
[57:51] so the 20 year old so I say a new
[57:54] generation is rising that's my text my
[57:57] title but I want to say very very
[58:01] quickly that I'm not speaking of a new
[58:04] generation as as it was here in a in an
[58:08] age group. I want to speak about a new
[58:12] generation as an experience. What uh
[58:15] what a group is experiencing. You might
[58:18] be you might be 50, you might be 80, you
[58:21] might be uh you might be 10. So it's not
[58:25] an age group. It was here an age group
[58:28] because the the those that had
[58:30] complained and murmured and so on and
[58:32] we'll come to that. God left them to
[58:35] perish in the wilderness. So it said
[58:37] from 20 years old and upward all that
[58:40] are able to go forth to war. So this
[58:43] generation
[58:44] that the generation that was 20 years
[58:47] old and younger, I need to establish
[58:50] this now. Listen very close. They
[58:53] experienced all the things that the
[58:56] older people 20 and above experienced.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; They heard the murmuring. They heard the
[59:04] complaining. They saw the failures. They
[59:07] saw all the things that their parents
[59:09] had had seen. And maybe the they a lot
[59:12] of them weren't parents either. They
[59:13] might have been unmarried, but they were
[59:15] 20 and older. And all of those perished
[59:18] or they they died in the wilderness. So
[59:21] they saw and heard the same things. And
[59:25] that's what's important really
[59:26] important. Now, I really felt I felt on
[59:30] my heart at the beginning of this year
[59:32] that I would seek to invite
[59:36] uh a new generation of ministers and I
[59:40] didn't have any specific plan. I didn't
[59:42] have any it was just in my heart and and
[59:44] there were some ministers that were had
[59:47] taken over churches and they were
[59:49] pastors now and and I thought to invite
[59:52] them and so I'll just bring it to your
[59:54] attention. We've had brother Jason
[59:56] Jackson. We've had brother Danny
[59:58] Stevens. We've had brother Joseph Green.
[1:00:01] We've had brother uh what was the last
[1:00:04] one? We've had brother Joseph Green. And
[1:00:06] uh any anyway, there's one more. And
[1:00:09] pardon
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Brother Dwayne. Yeah. Right. That
[1:00:14] that' be number five. So we've actually
[1:00:16] had about five. And this is just we're
[1:00:19] just in May. Uh and and and it just so
[1:00:23] happens that the churches that I'm going
[1:00:26] to be with in Germany, these are there's
[1:00:30] two of the pastors that have passed away
[1:00:33] and younger men have come up and become
[1:00:35] the pastors of those churches. And uh
[1:00:37] and the third one is a younger man as
[1:00:39] well. Brother David Iverson, brother
[1:00:42] Nathaniel's brother, who's just been
[1:00:44] ordained into the ministry officially
[1:00:47] and formally in in Gent. He he knows
[1:00:51] these brothers and he's very he says
[1:00:53] we're all kind of peers together and uh
[1:00:57] and and he just gave me a little bit of
[1:00:59] insight. Uh he said that you know
[1:01:02] they're just desiring they didn't have
[1:01:05] such close unity before but they're just
[1:01:07] working so close together and they and
[1:01:10] they have treasured and cherished their
[1:01:13] unity above little doctrinal
[1:01:15] differences.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I say praise God. Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; You see, that's exactly what we have
[1:01:21] right here because we'll get into it.
[1:01:23] They had all kinds of little reasons
[1:01:26] for, you know, grumbling and complaining
[1:01:30] about this. And I'd like to just ask
[1:01:31] this congregation, when in this world
[1:01:34] and when in this life and when and what
[1:01:37] churches are in the world that won't
[1:01:39] have reason for a complaint
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; are you ever going to have that? Never.
[1:01:47] You even have it in your homes.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; There's always reason you have it in
[1:01:51] your job.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's it's actually a mindset.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; A person either looks for that or they
[1:01:57] look away from that
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; and they say, "Well, this is part of
[1:02:00] life. This is what happens." But we go
[1:02:03] on because we've got our eyes set and
[1:02:06] fixed on the on the on the goal.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; And I'll say more about that as we come
[1:02:13] on. So, a a new generation. Why? Why a
[1:02:17] new generation? Well,
[1:02:20] for those of you that have a few years
[1:02:22] under your belt, I can tell you and
[1:02:24] those that that are younger here, and we
[1:02:27] have a a very large contingent of young
[1:02:31] people here, but I'll just tell you
[1:02:32] something. So, if time should go on for
[1:02:34] a little while, you'll find out what
[1:02:36] Brother Bis said tonight is absolutely
[1:02:38] correct.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; You pick up baggage.
[1:02:45] And sometimes you wish you didn't pick
[1:02:47] up baggage, but you do.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And you accumulate disappointments.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; And you accumulate things that you hear
[1:02:57] and you wish you didn't hear it.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; And you accumulate little reversals.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; You accumulate these things whether it
[1:03:06] is from home or from church or from the
[1:03:10] job or just just out there. That's
[1:03:13] right.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; You just accumulate it.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And it and and if you if you meditated
[1:03:18] and gave your time and your mind and
[1:03:20] your energy to ponder and chew over
[1:03:23] that, it'll wear you down.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; It it's it's it's made that way. Satan's
[1:03:29] planned it that way. So, you become
[1:03:31] weary with you can become weary with
[1:03:33] life and you'll pick up baggage.
[1:03:36] And these people had picked up baggage.
[1:03:39] Now for whatever reason God ordained it
[1:03:42] and he said 20 years old and upward and
[1:03:44] 20 years old and downward they will
[1:03:46] remain and and there's something about
[1:03:50] uh young people actually in I'm talking
[1:03:53] now about age group there's something
[1:03:56] about young people that have a
[1:03:57] resilience and uh uh if you get to very
[1:04:01] very small children you know that they
[1:04:04] can forgive in an instant
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; they can forgive just like that and that
[1:04:08] is one of The reasons why Jesus said
[1:04:10] unless you become like that,
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; you cannot enter the kingdom of God.
[1:04:16] You've got to have that kind of purity
[1:04:18] of spirit that you can you can hear
[1:04:22] something that can be very offending to
[1:04:26] you, but somehow you have the capacity
[1:04:29] to overcome that.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; You you can have somebody offend you,
[1:04:33] but you have a you have a capacity to
[1:04:36] forgive them. and not just forgive them,
[1:04:38] but forget it.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I want this congregation to say amen to
[1:04:43] that because you need to be able to do
[1:04:45] that. That is not an option. That's a
[1:04:48] requirement.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you don't forgive,
[1:04:51] you're not going to be forgiven."
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And that to me is very dangerous words.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's very dangerous words. I think
[1:05:02] about it on a fairly regular basis. And
[1:05:05] I think of it in this light. I need
[1:05:08] forgiveness.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; I need forgiveness on a regular basis.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And I want to be in a place where I have
[1:05:15] a repentant heart before God.
[1:05:19] We say things or we think things and we
[1:05:21] do things and so on and so forth and we
[1:05:24] have attitudes and all kinds of and when
[1:05:26] when we think oh if we we if we do it in
[1:05:30] if we think of ourselves in relationship
[1:05:32] to what's around us maybe it's okay or
[1:05:35] but that's not it. This is a holy God.
[1:05:38] And I think so often where brother
[1:05:40] Brandham preached on influence and and
[1:05:42] the and the saraphims, holy, holy
[1:05:45] angels, all they could say was holy,
[1:05:47] holy, holy, holy. Our God is a holy God.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that together? Our God
[1:05:56] is a holy God.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; He's a holy God.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Holy, holy, holy. There's no no one like
[1:06:04] Jehovah. No God like Jehovah. He's a
[1:06:07] holy God. And I'm glad that the blood
[1:06:09] stands here tonight for me. The blood
[1:06:12] stands here for you and I. Hallelujah.
[1:06:15] And God can only look at us through the
[1:06:17] blood.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And without that, we're sunk.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; for the blood of the Calvary, the lamb
[1:06:27] of God
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; that stands for us.
[1:06:31] But this new generation, there's a
[1:06:33] there's a certain capacity within young
[1:06:36] people that they haven't experienced so
[1:06:38] much stuff and they haven't picked up so
[1:06:41] much baggage in life and they they
[1:06:44] they're more resilient and ready and
[1:06:47] gung-ho and okay, let's go and do it.
[1:06:49] And so that is what Joshua had to work
[1:06:52] with. We say and we sing the song,
[1:06:56] precious memories, how they linger.
[1:06:58] Well, I tell you what, folks. I got a
[1:07:00] lot of memories aren't very precious.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got some company here
[1:07:06] tonight.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of memories that I have. I
[1:07:10] wake up 3:00 in the morning or 4:00 in
[1:07:12] the morning. And this might seem this
[1:07:14] probably seems strange to you. I've
[1:07:16] missed my mother who passed away when I
[1:07:19] was six and a half. I've missed her more
[1:07:21] in the last two years than I missed her
[1:07:23] in all the rest of my life. I would
[1:07:25] think. You say, "Why?" I don't know why
[1:07:28] you just start thinking about all of
[1:07:30] those things and thinking about, you
[1:07:32] know, all the years you could have
[1:07:34] enjoyed and the things you would have uh
[1:07:37] done together and whatever more and how
[1:07:39] it would have loved to been able to help
[1:07:41] her or whatever more and and you just
[1:07:43] miss them. And and when I think back on
[1:07:45] that, on one hand, it's it's a
[1:07:46] bittersweet because it's a it's a
[1:07:48] precious memory, but on the other hand,
[1:07:50] there's so much that uh isn't very
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; wonderful about it.
[1:07:59] So we have those memories. Memories can
[1:08:01] get a person into difficulty.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Over time memories can accumulate which
[1:08:09] they do.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And that's why I think Apostle Paul said
[1:08:13] forgetting those things that are behind
[1:08:14] because he knew a bit about it.
[1:08:18] memories of the of the bondage of Egypt
[1:08:20] became distorted
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; and became glossed over
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and they were thinking of the cucumbers
[1:08:27] and the melons and the oh how wonderful
[1:08:30] it was back in Egypt. Hello.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the whip on your back?
[1:08:35] Do you remember the slavery and how
[1:08:38] people uh my memory I remember people
[1:08:41] who sat and fellowshipped? people who
[1:08:44] took the Lord's supper with me. People
[1:08:47] who we washed feet together and somehow
[1:08:50] something just flipped and away they
[1:08:53] went.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And you know what? When a when someone
[1:08:56] who has confessed Christ, when they
[1:08:58] depart, they never seem to go just where
[1:09:01] an average unbeliever goes. They seem to
[1:09:03] have to go to the very depths. I don't
[1:09:05] know whether they're trying to prove
[1:09:06] something or what it is, but they go and
[1:09:09] they just go out to the very depths of
[1:09:11] of sin and perversion and whatever more.
[1:09:14] I say what a sad thing. But these people
[1:09:17] they wanted to go back uh wanted to go
[1:09:20] back and uh and and God kept telling
[1:09:23] them you know and when we think about
[1:09:25] the past now and and uh memories like I
[1:09:29] said they can become very very distorted
[1:09:33] and actually very twisted because we we
[1:09:36] can think of them in terms of of you
[1:09:39] know h how how wonderful it was back
[1:09:41] there. See, people get talking. I don't
[1:09:44] want to spend too much time in this, but
[1:09:45] get talking about the old days.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The old days. You just That's all
[1:09:51] I want to do is think about them because
[1:09:54] I don't want to be back there. I don't
[1:09:56] want to be driving across the roads that
[1:09:58] I drove when I was in my 20s over the
[1:10:01] gravel and and so much dust coming into
[1:10:04] the car. I could hardly breathe and
[1:10:06] could hardly see the road because of the
[1:10:09] dust. It would just hanging in the air.
[1:10:11] You don't know what that is. Or or or go
[1:10:13] to school on a horseback or or walk and
[1:10:16] 20 below or 25 below. No, thank you.
[1:10:21] Help yourself, but I don't want to be
[1:10:22] back there. And but those are memories.
[1:10:24] Oh, the old days. And you ladies don't
[1:10:27] want to be sitting there scrubbing on a
[1:10:30] scrubboard.
[1:10:32] And God said, now listen, I've got a
[1:10:34] ways to go and I'm going to go as
[1:10:35] quickly as I can. And thou shalt
[1:10:37] remember that thou was the bond man in
[1:10:40] the land of Egypt. And he kept saying
[1:10:42] that. This is what God God didn't say.
[1:10:44] Thou shalt remember the melons and the
[1:10:46] garlics.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou shalt remember that you
[1:10:50] were bond men in Egypt." And it's good
[1:10:52] for us to remember. We were slaves back
[1:10:54] there. And we can say today, "I'm free.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; I'm free indeed. Whom the sun sets free
[1:11:01] is free."
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a nice life back there. It was
[1:11:05] terrible.
[1:11:06] We couldn't free ourselves.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I prayed. I pounded the chair, the
[1:11:11] table. Oh God, I want to get delivered
[1:11:14] from this thing. Want to get delivered
[1:11:16] from this habit. And then one day, God
[1:11:19] comes in. Praise God. And it's over.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; And even at that time, your eyes are
[1:11:27] still blinded to many, many scriptures.
[1:11:29] And you try to I I I wrestle so hard
[1:11:33] with the Godhead and and the baptism,
[1:11:36] not so much a baptism, but the Godhead
[1:11:38] and just trying to understand the
[1:11:39] Godhead. Didn't realize that the baptism
[1:11:42] even just interpreted the Godhead.
[1:11:44] They're so connected together. And then
[1:11:46] just a a few scriptures out of the
[1:11:48] prophet's mouth and all the questions
[1:11:51] became answered. Thank God for the light
[1:11:54] of the word of God.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the message.
[1:11:59] Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; But if we were to sit here and we allow
[1:12:06] our minds to think about past failures,
[1:12:11] unanswered prayers.
[1:12:15] Some have trusted in men. Some have
[1:12:17] trusted in men's doctrines
[1:12:20] only to find out that it fails them and
[1:12:22] fails
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; fails the test. when the test really
[1:12:27] comes and those things become part of
[1:12:29] the package, part of the baggage. Even
[1:12:32] the two men on the way to Emmas, they
[1:12:34] said this, "But we trusted,
[1:12:37] we trusted that it had been him
[1:12:41] that should have redeemed Israel."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why they were sad. They said
[1:12:46] all of our confidence, all of our trust,
[1:12:49] this great ministry that had come, this
[1:12:52] God prophet, and they believed he was
[1:12:54] the Christ, and we trusted this was our
[1:12:57] answer for redemption of Israel. And now
[1:13:00] it's all fell apart, and it's all
[1:13:02] disappeared.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And there he was walking right with
[1:13:05] them.
[1:13:07] In the message, the greatest battle ever
[1:13:09] thought, brother Brandham said it must
[1:13:11] be accepted in the mind and then it's
[1:13:13] believed with the heart and then the
[1:13:15] word of God becomes a reality and then
[1:13:18] every senses of soul and body is just
[1:13:21] scoured out with the Holy Spirit and
[1:13:24] then you're a sense of God. You're a
[1:13:26] conscience of God. Everything that's
[1:13:28] godly flows through you. There's not a
[1:13:31] doubt anywhere. There's nothing can rise
[1:13:33] up. There's nothing, and I have this
[1:13:35] highlighted. There's nothing
[1:13:38] can come up in the memory and say,
[1:13:41] "Well, I remember Miss Jones tried to
[1:13:44] trust God. Miss so and so, Miss Doe
[1:13:48] tried to trust God for healing one time
[1:13:50] and she failed." And that's what the
[1:13:53] prophet is giving a warning here. You
[1:13:55] don't allow those things in that memory
[1:13:57] channel. You say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, it
[1:14:00] doesn't make any difference. Somebody
[1:14:01] prayed and didn't get it. What about the
[1:14:03] person that prayed and did get it?"
[1:14:05] That's where we want to concentrate and
[1:14:07] focus on. There's always going to be
[1:14:09] those that pray and don't get it or
[1:14:11] whatever more. And I'm not here soon as
[1:14:14] I get people I've had quite a number of
[1:14:16] people over my life who receive Christ.
[1:14:18] And one of one of the first things some
[1:14:19] of them say, "Well, what about all the
[1:14:21] people that never hear about this? What
[1:14:23] about all the people that don't know
[1:14:25] about Jesus or and never hear the name
[1:14:27] of Jesus Christ? What about them?" They
[1:14:29] don't. that they just haven't got a
[1:14:31] concept of the greatness of God that
[1:14:34] it's not our business.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's God's business.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And those kind of thoughts come your
[1:14:39] way, that's not for us to occupy our
[1:14:41] minds with those kind of things. Right.
[1:14:44] Right.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And so he said, "But but if that channel
[1:14:48] has been cleared out and been purged and
[1:14:51] been filled on the inside with the Holy
[1:14:53] Spirit that don't even come in memory,
[1:14:57] no matter what about Miss Jones or what
[1:14:59] she did, it's you and God together
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; and nobody else but you two."
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And there you are. He says, "That's the
[1:15:11] battle in the message." convinced then
[1:15:13] concerned. He said, "Now this falling
[1:15:15] away is a lack of concern for the body
[1:15:17] of Christ. I believe that maybe the
[1:15:20] right thing that has been presented."
[1:15:23] And I might just say here very very
[1:15:24] quickly, I've seen people fall away from
[1:15:27] following the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:15:30] following the the uh the message. And
[1:15:34] you know what I find that people that
[1:15:37] they become disenchanted. They become
[1:15:39] very selfc centered. It's me,
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; my situation,
[1:15:46] my job, my body, my this, my that. I say
[1:15:50] forget it.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; How I'm feeling. Who cares how you're
[1:15:54] feeling? We all We all have, you know,
[1:15:58] those kind of times. We all have them.
[1:16:01] Hope you don't mind me saying this. I'm
[1:16:03] going to say it anyway. We need to move
[1:16:05] away from, you know, my little world and
[1:16:09] how I'm feeling and all my little
[1:16:12] things. Why don't we think about the
[1:16:13] kingdom of God? Why do we think about
[1:16:16] the believers, the body of Christ at
[1:16:18] large? Why don't we think about what's
[1:16:20] on God's heart? Amen.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "And so many young students
[1:16:29] that would take a call in life see so
[1:16:32] many failures out there and really see
[1:16:34] that the order and program of the day
[1:16:37] has failed. Christ hasn't failed.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Your job might fail.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Your economics might fail. Your health
[1:16:45] might fail. All kinds of things. Your
[1:16:47] friends might fail. The pastor might
[1:16:50] fail, but Christ won't fail.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; So, you have to have your faith, trust,
[1:16:57] and confidence anchored in the right
[1:17:00] object. And he is the object.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Christ's program hasn't failed.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; I've heard the thing, "Oh, this this
[1:17:10] message is a mess." I disagree with
[1:17:12] that. This message is a beautiful
[1:17:14] message. This message is Jesus Christ
[1:17:17] and he's never been a mess
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; and everything's right on target.
[1:17:22] Nothing's out of cater. Everything's
[1:17:25] moving exactly as God has ordained it to
[1:17:27] move. And it's important for me to be in
[1:17:30] that program. Christ program has never
[1:17:33] failed.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Mine might, yours might, but his has not
[1:17:37] failed. But the people system has
[1:17:40] failed. But now Christ has a program
[1:17:43] that we must enter into. we must enter
[1:17:45] into.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; I just want to say quickly here
[1:17:51] so you can get where I'm going.
[1:17:56] The people here, the children of Israel
[1:17:58] had a kadesh Barnea.
[1:18:01] But when Jesus came, he also led the
[1:18:05] children of the children of Israel. He
[1:18:08] led them up to a kadesh Barnea,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; which actually was the third pull, the
[1:18:12] opening of his of the word. It was the
[1:18:14] opening of his ministry and brother
[1:18:16] Brandham ties it right to except eat my
[1:18:19] flesh and drink my blood.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; You have no life in you.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And in the prophet's ministry, all the
[1:18:25] people that were gathered, he led them
[1:18:27] right to Aadesh Barnea. And in Jesus'
[1:18:31] time, now in Moses time, it was at age
[1:18:33] 20 years old up and upper and and
[1:18:36] beneath that. In Jesus' time, it was not
[1:18:39] an age.
[1:18:41] It wasn't who's 20 and who's above 20 or
[1:18:44] below 20. It was what exper what they
[1:18:48] were prepared to experience because now
[1:18:50] he had Jesus as Moses sent 12 spies in.
[1:18:55] Jesus had 12 disciples.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Only two of Moses 12 came back with a
[1:19:00] good report. Jua
[1:19:03] and Caleb. And only one of Jesus 12 was
[1:19:07] a devil,
[1:19:09] Judas himself. But the other 11 and
[1:19:12] they're all different age groups as far
[1:19:14] as age is concerned. It it now Kadesh
[1:19:17] Barnea is not an age thing. It's an
[1:19:20] experience.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And here tonight now in the message of
[1:19:25] this hour, it's not an age thing either.
[1:19:28] It is an experience.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; A kadesh. Every person has their kadesh
[1:19:33] baria. It's a time when God moves on you
[1:19:37] and shows you your inheritance and says,
[1:19:41] "Here it is.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Move on into it. You don't pull back.
[1:19:46] You don't draw back. You don't put your
[1:19:48] eyes on all the problems and the
[1:19:50] complaints and the failures because that
[1:19:53] will always be. You don't put your eyes
[1:19:55] on the world or elsewhere. You don't put
[1:19:57] your eyes on what this world can provide
[1:20:00] for you. You look at what God has opened
[1:20:03] up to you and it will open up first from
[1:20:06] the word. The message will open up the
[1:20:08] word and you'll say how glorious,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; how wonderful this is.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; And it's an utter simplicity.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; So often you know
[1:20:21] with a man or a woman, either one. Some
[1:20:23] of the things that brother Brandham
[1:20:24] speaks about it seems so simple. say,
[1:20:28] well, how we need to act, how we need to
[1:20:30] speak, how we need to dress, how we need
[1:20:33] to do these various things. And we think
[1:20:35] that is so simple. Listen, friends, it's
[1:20:38] part of your inheritance.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; You don't realize it. Maybe you don't
[1:20:42] realize it, but by doing and obeying
[1:20:46] that little simple thing is protecting
[1:20:49] you and keeping you from the evil.
[1:20:51] Right.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; As a young lady, you might say, "Well,
[1:20:57] you know, I hear it pounded over the
[1:20:59] pulpit and and and what kind of what's
[1:21:02] the difference of how how I dress?"
[1:21:04] Well, I'll tell you how important it is.
[1:21:06] That prophet's message is going out and
[1:21:08] protecting you from being a prostitute
[1:21:10] in the sight of God.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's how important that is.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That's how important it is. Our Father,
[1:21:17] which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
[1:21:20] name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
[1:21:22] on earth as it is in heaven. And what
[1:21:24] does the what does the line say? Lead us
[1:21:27] not into temptation. And that's exactly
[1:21:30] what God is doing through the word. He's
[1:21:34] he's he's protecting the people from
[1:21:36] temptation.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:44] And they said, "And the people, and God
[1:21:46] said, 'But your little ones which you
[1:21:48] said should be a prey, them will I bring
[1:21:51] in, and they shall know the land, they
[1:21:54] shall know the land which you have
[1:21:57] despised."
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I call this a place called Kadesh
[1:22:01] Barnea. So the children of Israel had
[1:22:03] theirs under Moses. And brother Brandham
[1:22:06] said, Joshua and Caleb said, "We're more
[1:22:09] than able
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; to do it." And God made the promise.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; He says that was Kadesh Barnea. And they
[1:22:17] turned back and became wanderers in the
[1:22:19] wilderness. And every one of them died
[1:22:22] and lost eternally. Jesus said so. He
[1:22:25] said, "Don't cross the separating line
[1:22:28] when you know to do good and doeth it
[1:22:30] not to you it is sin." in the thirst
[1:22:33] message in Tucson in 65 he said how that
[1:22:38] Moses a prophet came down into Egypt to
[1:22:41] fulfill the word of God listen how it's
[1:22:43] phrased now I just wish I had enough
[1:22:45] time how Moses came down into Egypt to
[1:22:49] fulfill the word of God to bring the
[1:22:52] evening light to them
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; he's paralleling it completely to the
[1:22:59] evening light that was right at this
[1:23:01] time
[1:23:02] and how they seen the great miracles as
[1:23:05] they did in this time.
[1:23:08] And how they followed him at as they did
[1:23:11] in this time and how they crossed the
[1:23:13] Red Sea and were baptized unto him and
[1:23:16] went into the wilderness and eat angels
[1:23:18] food that fell from heaven and then
[1:23:21] refused to take it to take all the word.
[1:23:24] when they come back to Kadesh Barnea
[1:23:27] from the promised land and said that was
[1:23:29] the spies and they said they're like
[1:23:32] giants we can't do it when God said I've
[1:23:35] already give you the land
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; borderline Jesus said they're everyone
[1:23:41] perished
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; and Moses and and Apostle Paul speaks
[1:23:47] about them and I thought it was really
[1:23:49] really uh striking listening just listen
[1:23:52] to this moreover brethren
[1:23:54] I would not
[1:23:57] this is to us. I would not that you
[1:23:58] would be ignorant how that and notice
[1:24:01] the word a ll all.
[1:24:05] How that all our fathers were under the
[1:24:08] cloud.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be nice to be under the
[1:24:11] cloud
[1:24:13] and all passed through the sea?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; And all were baptized unto Moses in the
[1:24:19] cloud and in the sea. and did all eat
[1:24:23] the same spiritual meat and did all
[1:24:27] drink the same spiritual drink for they
[1:24:30] drank of that spiritual rock that
[1:24:32] followed them and that rock was Christ.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; They drank of Christ. They ate angels
[1:24:39] food as the prophet said. But with many
[1:24:41] of them God was displeased. God was not
[1:24:45] well pleased for they were overthrown in
[1:24:47] the wilderness. Yes.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And now these things were written for
[1:24:52] our examples to the intent that we
[1:24:56] should not lust after evil things as
[1:25:00] they also lusted. Neither be idolattors
[1:25:03] as they as they were some of them. As it
[1:25:07] is written, the people sat down to eat
[1:25:09] and drink and rose up to play. And if
[1:25:12] you take the word play in the Hebrew, it
[1:25:14] is that they became they, you know, they
[1:25:17] they became humorous and joking and
[1:25:20] light and frivolous and so on and so
[1:25:22] forth. And brother Brandon said, "It's
[1:25:24] the spirit of this age.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of America and everything.
[1:25:28] I remember a few years ago when you know
[1:25:30] because I was very keen on on
[1:25:32] advertising and I needed to have it in
[1:25:35] my in my in my work as a young man and
[1:25:38] they were saying even back then that if
[1:25:41] adverti advertising
[1:25:43] by radio and by television especially by
[1:25:46] television if they didn't get a humorous
[1:25:49] content and make ads funny they weren't
[1:25:53] going to get anywhere they weren't going
[1:25:55] to sell their product they weren't going
[1:25:57] to get the attention of the people. And
[1:25:59] today, you don't have to be very smart
[1:26:01] to say that the whole thing is a joke.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; They just put it in everything has to be
[1:26:06] uh uh a a big a big laugh and
[1:26:09] everybody's got their mouth wide open
[1:26:11] and whether they're selling condominiums
[1:26:13] on the road or whatever. Everybody's
[1:26:15] having a great time.
[1:26:18] They don't tell you what's going on
[1:26:19] inside the condo,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; fighting and the warfare and all the
[1:26:25] rest of it. Well, we'll get off that
[1:26:26] subject.
[1:26:30] In Jesus' time, he brought them up to
[1:26:32] their
[1:26:34] their kades barneia in the ministry of
[1:26:36] Jesus.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he came to his own
[1:26:40] and his own received him not.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he sent forth his
[1:26:44] servants to call them that were bidden
[1:26:46] to the wedding and the wedding and they
[1:26:47] would not come.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; This is the this is the experience Jesus
[1:26:51] was having having. And and I I know that
[1:26:55] we would feel within our heart, well, I
[1:26:57] would never want to be in that company.
[1:26:59] He came to his own, his own would
[1:27:00] receive him not. And then he went on in
[1:27:03] and the one that brother Brandham
[1:27:05] mentioned so many times, and he that
[1:27:06] eateth my flesh and drinkketh my blood
[1:27:08] dwelleth in me, and I in him, that's the
[1:27:11] land.
[1:27:13] And the living, as the living father
[1:27:15] hath sent me, and I live by the father,
[1:27:18] so he that eateth me, even he shall live
[1:27:21] by me. This is that bread which came
[1:27:23] down from heaven, not as your fathers
[1:27:25] did eat mana and are dead. See, he's
[1:27:28] talking about he's talking right now
[1:27:31] about Kades Barnea.
[1:27:35] He that eateth this bread shall live
[1:27:37] forever.
[1:27:39] These things said he in the synagogue as
[1:27:41] he taught in Capernaum. And many
[1:27:43] therefore of his disciples when they had
[1:27:45] heard this, they said, "This is a hard
[1:27:47] saying." his disciples now called out
[1:27:50] ones is a hard saying who can hear it
[1:27:53] and when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:27:55] disciples murmured same thing they
[1:27:57] murmured back there now his disciples
[1:27:59] murmured at it and said unto them this
[1:28:03] offend you what if you should see the
[1:28:05] son of man ascend up where he was before
[1:28:08] he said it is the spirit that quickenth
[1:28:10] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:28:13] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[1:28:14] and they are life but there are some of
[1:28:17] you that believe not. Here he is. He's
[1:28:20] coming down to it. Some believe not.
[1:28:24] For Jesus knew from the beginning who
[1:28:26] they were that believed who believed not
[1:28:29] and who should betray him. And he said,
[1:28:31] "Therefore I say unto you that no man
[1:28:33] can come to me except it were given him
[1:28:35] given unto him of my father." And from
[1:28:37] that time
[1:28:39] from that time many of his disciples
[1:28:42] went back
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; and walked no more with him. It didn't
[1:28:46] say that they went back and eventually
[1:28:49] came back and returned. They went back
[1:28:51] and walked no more with him. Can you
[1:28:54] imagine?
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's hard to even comprehend
[1:28:59] that people could turn away from the
[1:29:01] words of Jesus. And those words don't
[1:29:04] sound that strong to me.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I don't think that that is I don't think
[1:29:10] that that is some insurmountable thing.
[1:29:13] and and what he's saying that no man can
[1:29:15] come unless it's given to my father. I
[1:29:18] would want to say well praise God.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; I I pray the father will give it to me.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And from that time what in other words
[1:29:28] he brought them to the kades barnea and
[1:29:30] they went back. They turned back and
[1:29:33] they died. And that's exactly the
[1:29:35] scripture that he is using is referring
[1:29:37] to. And then he said
[1:29:41] in the unveiling of God, which I read
[1:29:43] just a couple weeks ago or so and didn't
[1:29:46] know I was going to come to it again,
[1:29:47] and then he had 12 left.
[1:29:50] He chose 12 and one of them was a devil
[1:29:52] and he said he turned to them
[1:29:56] and there's no one could explain what he
[1:29:58] just said. How are they going to eat his
[1:30:00] flesh and drink his blood? And how did
[1:30:02] he come down when he was born right here
[1:30:04] on earth? They couldn't understand it.
[1:30:07] And then he turned to the apostles and
[1:30:09] said, "Do you want to go also?"
[1:30:12] And that's when the apostle Peter made
[1:30:14] that great statement, Lord, to whom
[1:30:18] would we go? And this is what I have red
[1:30:22] and yellow underlined.
[1:30:24] For we are satisfied,
[1:30:26] and we know as surely that you and you
[1:30:30] alone have the word of life at this
[1:30:33] hour. And we're satisfied of that. and
[1:30:36] they couldn't explain it. And a little
[1:30:38] further on,
[1:30:41] brother Brandham asked the question. He
[1:30:42] says, "And what could they do?
[1:30:45] Go back to the cold formal churches that
[1:30:48] they came out of." Said, "Where would we
[1:30:51] go?"
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And that question is a reality to us.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Where would we go?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Would the people from the colony go back
[1:30:58] to the colonies? Would you go back to
[1:31:00] your churches, your denomination? Go
[1:31:02] back to your Lutheran Salvation Army
[1:31:04] Pentecost Cath Catholic. What would we
[1:31:06] do? Go back. Can you imagine going back
[1:31:08] in there?
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going back and listening
[1:31:13] to some rock band
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; on the platform
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; or going back and kissing some metal or
[1:31:21] some statue
[1:31:23] or going back to where we were?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, that's a serious thing.
[1:31:29] Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; I say thank God.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And it's obvious that it's a reality to
[1:31:35] you or you wouldn't be sitting here.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; You're here because it means everything
[1:31:39] to you.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Where would we go?
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; We can't turn back. And we have our own
[1:31:50] Katish Barneo.
[1:31:52] And when I think of the people,
[1:31:56] I'm talking about my baggage,
[1:31:58] my memories, and I think of those. And
[1:32:01] I'm baffled. I'm baffled. I'm
[1:32:04] dumbfounded. I'm speechless. And to
[1:32:07] think that people could turn aside and
[1:32:11] be lured aside, enchanted. How
[1:32:14] deceitful,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; how deceiving Satan is. And I don't want
[1:32:18] to even go back and say, "Well, I like
[1:32:21] the best of both worlds." There is no
[1:32:22] such a thing. We need to be sold out
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; to the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; body, soul, and spirit.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I say to you, young people, with no
[1:32:33] hesitation and no apology, you'll never
[1:32:36] regret giving every ounce of energy and
[1:32:40] strength and resources to the gospel of
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ. You'll never regret it. I
[1:32:46] said, "Driving into the into the parking
[1:32:48] lot tonight, I just wish I I'm happy for
[1:32:52] the years God's given. I wish I had
[1:32:54] more."
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; I stand here tonight saying, "I wish I
[1:32:57] had more."
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You think it's easy? I invite you to
[1:33:06] follow me the next five days.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Turn a U-turn,
[1:33:11] fly overseas, and be right with the
[1:33:13] ministers the next morning. and uh and
[1:33:15] service that night and service the next
[1:33:17] day. Two services on Sunday and service
[1:33:20] on on on Monday and and on a plane
[1:33:23] Tuesday morning. So, I want to be back
[1:33:24] here, Lord willing, for not to speak,
[1:33:28] but I want to be here in the in the
[1:33:30] service and do everything we can for the
[1:33:33] kingdom of God. And I feel a real
[1:33:35] burden. I'm going to speak this message,
[1:33:36] the Lord willing, because that's
[1:33:38] actually where it started to burn. God
[1:33:40] is raising. A new generation is rising.
[1:33:43] Men are not interested in all the
[1:33:45] quibbling.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, you can
[1:33:48] quibble.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; You can carry on and complain and murmur
[1:33:52] and all that. And that's exactly what
[1:33:54] the murmur is. In the Old Testament, it
[1:33:55] was grumbling.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You can grumble your whole life away.
[1:34:01] And that's why the young people, the
[1:34:02] young people, they didn't have all that
[1:34:04] baggage, but the parents, you know, they
[1:34:06] had that to think about and they thought
[1:34:08] about that and turn this over and turn
[1:34:10] that over. When's it going to go away?
[1:34:12] Never.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; It's never going to go away. You fix
[1:34:16] that and then there's something else to
[1:34:17] fix. And you fix that and there's a
[1:34:19] there's three more things to fix. We're
[1:34:21] not here just to fix. That's not my
[1:34:23] ministry. I I was called to preach the
[1:34:26] gospel of Jesus Christ. I'm not here to
[1:34:29] put out a little uh a brush fire here
[1:34:32] and a brush fire there and this person's
[1:34:34] got a complaint and that person's got
[1:34:36] something. That's not what the
[1:34:37] minister's called for. He's called to
[1:34:39] preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. And
[1:34:42] you're called to hear it
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and do it.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; That's the thus sayith the Lord.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; That's the word of God.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; And if you hear it and do it, you'll
[1:34:54] find your life prosper. And when your
[1:34:56] life is prospered in Christ, you don't
[1:34:57] have to worry about anybody else.
[1:35:02] [Applause]
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Today we have Arcades Barnea. when the
[1:35:08] word has been presented to us
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; in the message adoption.
[1:35:14] Let me go quickly now please. He says
[1:35:16] God by he said remember God
[1:35:18] predestinated you by fornowledge.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; I wish I could relate some things to
[1:35:28] you. It's going through my mind right
[1:35:30] now.
[1:35:31] that you were coming to this God by
[1:35:33] fornowledge predestinated you to come to
[1:35:36] the promised land. What is the promised
[1:35:39] land for the Christian today? The
[1:35:41] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:35:43] and to them that are a far off.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; There's been those even within the
[1:35:49] message that want to take away and
[1:35:51] dilute the the the
[1:35:54] uh power of the Holy Spirit. I believe
[1:35:57] in the Holy Spirit. I believe in the
[1:36:00] true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; I believe there's a ceiling.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; I believe there's an experience when
[1:36:06] it's when you've had it, it's over.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what I believe.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And God's provided a place of worship.
[1:36:22] He said, if you bought, he said, you
[1:36:23] say, "I bought a piece of ground. It
[1:36:26] isn't yours yet until you got an
[1:36:28] abstract.
[1:36:30] We don't have abstract in Canada, but
[1:36:32] it's a abstract. And he he he speaks
[1:36:35] what it is. It's traced right back to
[1:36:37] the very beginning. He says, "But if you
[1:36:40] got an abstract, it shows that
[1:36:42] everything
[1:36:43] was ever against that piece of ground
[1:36:46] has been stricken off."
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you've become a Christian
[1:36:53] and accept Christ as your savior, then
[1:36:56] when God sends down the abstract, it
[1:37:00] shows that no matter what your father
[1:37:03] did or your mother did or what anybody
[1:37:06] else did, your mother, daddy might have
[1:37:08] been drunkards and prostitutes, whatever
[1:37:11] it was, every sin is stricken off and
[1:37:15] you've got an abstract title and there's
[1:37:18] nothing can put you off of it. He says,
[1:37:21] "And look, everything that was on the
[1:37:23] ground belongs to you."
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; And when you're in the Christ Jesus by
[1:37:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, every
[1:37:30] gift of God belongs in the church.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; And it's an abstract title deed. It's
[1:37:36] yours. It belongs to you.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; And I'm just not going to allow anybody
[1:37:41] to take that away from me.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was away a day last week
[1:37:51] and I was awake very very early in the
[1:37:53] morning and I said, "God, I need to hear
[1:37:56] from you.
[1:37:58] I've been speaking to you and I don't
[1:38:01] have an answer. I've been speaking to
[1:38:03] you and I've been asking you. I need an
[1:38:05] answer. I need to hear your voice. Don't
[1:38:09] remain silent." And I read in the
[1:38:11] Psalms. I've been reading it for some
[1:38:13] weeks and reading in the scriptures
[1:38:17] wherever I felt directed and just
[1:38:19] seeking God, listening to the messages,
[1:38:21] listening to the tapes and in the wee
[1:38:24] hours of the morning, I just came to
[1:38:28] realization and God God spoke and gave
[1:38:31] me an answer.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful when you know that he
[1:38:35] says it.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; It's such a restmen,
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; such a peace.
[1:38:41] as God speaks. We need those.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; We need those moments. And you know
[1:38:46] what, friends? It's worth waiting
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; with a baited breath,
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; with your mouth open.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Speak.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Speak. Father, I'm waiting.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; It's worth weeks. It's worth months.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; It's worth even years. It's worth
[1:39:03] everything.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have to speak. But oh
[1:39:06] when he speaks
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; it's wonderful.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I can say isn't he lovely?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; These things belong to us.
[1:39:23] If Satan has robbed you,
[1:39:27] this is Wednesday evening. I'm speaking
[1:39:29] like it would be a convention.
[1:39:33] If Satan has robbed you of the
[1:39:34] privilege, and it is a privilege, those
[1:39:37] men that were 20 and over, and we don't
[1:39:41] have an age group now, but we have the
[1:39:44] same devil that caused them to doubt is
[1:39:47] the same devil that would want us to
[1:39:50] doubt.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; I believe that there's waters to swim in
[1:39:53] in this message. Yes,
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I don't think we should be satisfied
[1:39:57] with where we are and just what we have.
[1:40:00] But we should say, I know that there is
[1:40:03] infinitely more for me and I cannot be
[1:40:06] content till I have that and I'm
[1:40:09] participating in it. I want to walk in
[1:40:11] the glory of it. This land is mine.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; This inheritance is mine. Amen.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Whether it be a healing or whether it be
[1:40:21] a deliverance or whether it be an answer
[1:40:23] to prayer, it's ours.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And he's robbed you. If he's robbed you
[1:40:39] of that privilege, we have a right this
[1:40:41] morning and I'll say we have a right
[1:40:43] this evening by the Holy Spirit to
[1:40:47] enforce the claim of God.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Bring them back.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; We have a right.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Almighty God, you wrote this word. We
[1:41:00] have a right.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Bring them back.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Rick Hart and Sister
[1:41:08] Andrea came by our house today. They had
[1:41:11] just been to Children's Hospital to to
[1:41:13] have Ella Joy
[1:41:16] have her checked from the last report
[1:41:18] from the last time. The last time they
[1:41:21] were there, they had her all hooked up
[1:41:23] with all kinds of wires and to check the
[1:41:26] muscles and the movement and the
[1:41:28] strength and had everything and put it
[1:41:30] on a on a computer. And they had a
[1:41:32] specialist today that had all that data
[1:41:34] and everything. And he just said, "I
[1:41:37] don't even need that." He said, "She's
[1:41:39] doing so well." He said, "She'd be
[1:41:41] walking in a year."
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:48] Glory to God.
[1:41:54] And I just said, "I've never doubted
[1:41:56] that. I've never doubted. I can't doubt
[1:41:59] that.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Give it back.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; This land is ours. And it's not just
[1:42:06] with the force of preaching or the or
[1:42:08] the volume of my voice. It is the
[1:42:10] promise of God.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Give it back.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; It belongs to us.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; This is the enemy
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; and our children and grandchildren and
[1:42:23] our inheritance, our families, your sons
[1:42:26] and your daughters. They're gods. Amen.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; I say and I say with you in the name of
[1:42:34] Jesus Christ, give it back.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching not for a sermon. I'm
[1:42:40] preaching for the reality. Give it back.
[1:42:44] Amen.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Everything this word has promised, the
[1:42:50] harmony and the unity and the peace
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; that must prevail
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; in our lives
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; and in our homes.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Give it back.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; If you have a home tonight that's filled
[1:43:03] with distress and turmoil, you should
[1:43:06] say with me, Satan, in the name of Jesus
[1:43:09] Christ, give it back.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:14] I claim it.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I claim my loved one.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; I claim it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; I claim my grandson.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You claim your loved one.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Claim him in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:29] And don't doubt.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says when you
[1:43:33] rise in the resurrection and you have
[1:43:35] not doubted, he has to answer to that
[1:43:38] faith.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; And God cannot lie. He must bring them
[1:43:43] back.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; My dear children,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's no message like this
[1:43:54] message.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; You won't find that in some other
[1:43:57] theology.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; You won't find that in some book. And
[1:44:00] the Holy Spirit is here giving witness
[1:44:03] to your soul saying that is the truth.
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Give it back.
[1:44:12] that belongs to me.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; This is my land. This is my inheritance.
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; And don't be moved on that faith.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know how. I don't know when, but
[1:44:25] I know it shall be.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And now you see now I'm I'm I'm giving
[1:44:34] you a little preview of the land.
[1:44:39] And I know that even in this
[1:44:40] congregation at this minute, there's
[1:44:42] twinges
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; of doubt.
[1:44:47] Don't do that.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they did
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; in Kades Barnea.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what they did when
[1:44:56] Jesus brought them to Kades Barnea.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly where we are in Aades
[1:45:01] Barnea. Because we're not here with the
[1:45:03] prophet of God standing and revealing
[1:45:05] the secrets of the hearts and people
[1:45:07] criticizing it and saying and and and
[1:45:09] here the other day it should have made
[1:45:11] the people so ashamed they should have
[1:45:12] been at the altar in full repentance.
[1:45:14] But he said and he's just saying you got
[1:45:16] a backachche or you got some like this
[1:45:19] and he said I didn't guess that. He said
[1:45:22] why do you do that?
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Why why why do you why do you say that?
[1:45:29] He said he just says this. Let's just
[1:45:31] see if I was guessing it. And he calls a
[1:45:34] woman and he begins telling her
[1:45:37] everything.
[1:45:39] Things that are so so in detail
[1:45:43] you could never never dispute it.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And he's just proving and making making
[1:45:48] a fool out of the devil.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; And I say that we ought to as believers
[1:45:53] make a fool out of him. He is a fool.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Believe. Yeah.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; With everything that's in you.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And don't take that in your mind. What
[1:46:04] if it doesn't happen?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Say I'm believing it.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; You can't believe and say, "What if it
[1:46:09] doesn't happen?"
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Believing it is believing it's already
[1:46:13] done.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; God already gave it to us.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to give him praise
[1:46:21] and glory. It's a finished work. It's a
[1:46:25] finished work. It's already done. The
[1:46:28] prophet says it's substance faith.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; I have a substance
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; and I cannot doubt it.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes and I've got to
[1:46:46] abstract. Every bit of it belongs to
[1:46:50] you.
[1:46:54] the open word today and it's so full of
[1:46:58] promises. The open word today is our
[1:47:01] we're at our cades when it's been been
[1:47:04] open to us. Says there's the land. And
[1:47:07] so there's people that are in the land.
[1:47:10] There's people that are rejoicing. And
[1:47:12] don't think that the land is just where
[1:47:14] you're going to sit down, smell the
[1:47:15] roses. The he said it's your life in the
[1:47:18] Holy Ghost. And if you don't think that
[1:47:19] there's war, just get full of the Holy
[1:47:21] Ghost once and you'll find out you're in
[1:47:23] a battle.
[1:47:25] Yeah,
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; but there's a victory.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; You don't read and Joshua was defeated
[1:47:31] and Caleb was defeated and these men
[1:47:33] were defeated. Now, they were
[1:47:35] victorious.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Walled cities, men violent and waring
[1:47:40] waring nations, but they were
[1:47:42] victorious. And and and here you're
[1:47:45] sitting today and the same thing's
[1:47:46] happening right this minute while we sit
[1:47:48] here in Israel. The Pope's trying to
[1:47:51] trying to entice them out of it. and the
[1:47:53] uh the president of the United States
[1:47:55] trying to entice them out of it. And I
[1:47:57] thought it was so so
[1:48:00] really wonderful the other day uh
[1:48:02] President Obama and and Prime Minister
[1:48:05] Netanyahu sitting there and all the all
[1:48:08] the people from the about 30 minutes you
[1:48:12] can see it on MSNBC news on the on your
[1:48:15] television
[1:48:17] on your computer. To me, it's like a
[1:48:20] television you're seeing, but you see it
[1:48:22] on your computer. I listened to about 30
[1:48:23] minutes of it. And uh they're sitting
[1:48:26] there
[1:48:27] and they said in the little news article
[1:48:29] that's beside it that that Prime
[1:48:32] Minister Netanyahu actually pulled a
[1:48:34] coup because President Obama had already
[1:48:38] said that, you know, the real key
[1:48:40] subject had to be the two states and the
[1:48:42] Palestinian state and the and the state
[1:48:46] of Israel had to be a two-state
[1:48:48] settlement. And Netanyahu, he just
[1:48:50] turned it around and made it an Iran
[1:48:53] nuclear right
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; threat and United States problem.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; And that took up the whole 30 minutes
[1:49:01] pretty well. That's what they talked
[1:49:02] about was Iran and the United States and
[1:49:05] Iran and the United Nations and Iran and
[1:49:08] the threat that it is. And he says if
[1:49:09] it's threat to us and we're your
[1:49:11] greatest friend over there, which was
[1:49:14] exactly the truth, but all the nations,
[1:49:16] can you imagine that little sliver of
[1:49:18] land?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Those few people still fighting for
[1:49:22] their existence. trying to get them off
[1:49:25] the land, trying to get them to settle
[1:49:27] land, strip away land.
[1:49:32] You think that we do that in in Canada,
[1:49:34] United States, or any other country?
[1:49:36] Well, listen. If you want peace, because
[1:49:38] we're a waring people, and if you want
[1:49:40] peace, you know, you got to just give
[1:49:43] off this whole chunk of the West Coast
[1:49:45] or give off British Columbia or give off
[1:49:47] Washington, California, and Oregon. You
[1:49:50] think they're going to settle for that?
[1:49:54] And I thought it was so proper for they
[1:49:56] finally
[1:49:58] the president of the United States said
[1:50:01] of course you can't really
[1:50:04] have a meaningful discussion when there
[1:50:07] when you have rockets raining down on
[1:50:09] the head of your innocents
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; because because Mr. Netanyahu had
[1:50:14] already said
[1:50:16] the first basic fundamental
[1:50:20] the foundation the beginning ground zero
[1:50:23] has to be that we are recognized as a
[1:50:26] legitimate state
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; ourselves but until that happens and
[1:50:31] they don't plan to let that happen I
[1:50:32] mean you know it's like saying
[1:50:36] Satan
[1:50:38] we can coexist
[1:50:40] if you agree that this land in the Holy
[1:50:44] Ghost is mine and belongs to me. He's
[1:50:47] never going to agree to that.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Try it.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; He's not going to agree to that. He's
[1:50:55] never going to agree to that. So, you
[1:50:57] have to just say, "We're at war
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; and you're defeated.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And I point you to Calvary. And I point
[1:51:04] you to the blood of Jesus Christ, the
[1:51:07] new creation. And I point you to the
[1:51:08] second Adam who purchased back
[1:51:11] everything the first Adam lost.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And I'm not under the first Adam. I'm
[1:51:15] under the second Adam.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; And we don't want a spiral. I'm going to
[1:51:27] close without going into this part, but
[1:51:30] we don't want to spiral in a downward
[1:51:32] spiral
[1:51:34] because defeat can come very very
[1:51:36] simply. And the first the first the
[1:51:39] Bible says this and here's the sequence.
[1:51:42] They cried and the crying wasn't crying
[1:51:45] like we understand crying. The word
[1:51:48] actually in the Hebrew has that they
[1:51:51] they they set like a they be they came
[1:51:53] to a mindset. They came to a certain you
[1:51:56] know they they determined something in
[1:52:00] their mind. In fact is
[1:52:03] the word was that they they reported or
[1:52:05] they mention it or they publish it or
[1:52:07] they utter it or they assign it. So they
[1:52:09] came to a place where they looked at all
[1:52:12] these things that were happening and
[1:52:13] they determined that this is the way it
[1:52:15] is. And when they determined that then
[1:52:18] the Bible says then they wept all night
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; and that was they wailed.
[1:52:25] Because that's what if you get the wrong
[1:52:28] thought,
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; if you get that and let that negative
[1:52:31] thought rule in your mind, it will bring
[1:52:34] you down into a pit of despair.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; And they wailed and wept all night. And
[1:52:40] then that led, watch, watch the spiral
[1:52:43] now. Then they began to murmur
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; and they began to grumble because that's
[1:52:48] how it started. They got a negative
[1:52:50] mindset. And then they became very sad
[1:52:52] and wept over it. And then they then
[1:52:54] they began to murmur. And they didn't
[1:52:56] just murmur and grumble. They began to
[1:52:59] murmur against Moses and against Aaron.
[1:53:02] The the objects of leadership. But God
[1:53:06] God when he answered, he never said,
[1:53:08] "You murmured against Moses." He said,
[1:53:11] "You murmured against me."
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's very interesting. You murmured
[1:53:16] against me. and he mentions it several
[1:53:18] times in that same chapter. And then it
[1:53:21] didn't end there. Then they began to
[1:53:25] text one another.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; They began to phone one another. They
[1:53:31] began to speak to one another. And you
[1:53:34] know what? When they're in that mindset,
[1:53:36] they weren't they didn't they didn't get
[1:53:38] in touch with one another and says, "Oh,
[1:53:39] I just had such a wonderful victory.
[1:53:42] Hallelujah. Isn't this wonderful? Isn't
[1:53:44] this life wonderful?" No. No. They
[1:53:46] communicated all their grumbling.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; They communicated all their negative
[1:53:49] stuff. And then that began to spread
[1:53:51] throughout the whole congregation. The
[1:53:53] whole congregation of the people. And
[1:53:56] God just said, "That's it.
[1:53:59] 20 year old and up, 20 year old and
[1:54:02] under, they're going to inherit it and
[1:54:04] they're going to go in." And I spoke to
[1:54:06] a group of young people. I'm just
[1:54:08] finishing now. I spoke to a group of
[1:54:09] young people while I was away in some
[1:54:11] meetings and I spoke about those. That
[1:54:14] was my whole service on the 20 year old
[1:54:17] and under. And what I said, they heard
[1:54:19] all the same things. They experienced
[1:54:21] all the same things. They saw all the
[1:54:23] same things. But somehow it didn't have
[1:54:26] the same effect on them.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; They heard the grumbling. They even saw,
[1:54:30] listen, Kora and Nathan and 250 princes.
[1:54:34] And you imagine the thousands that died.
[1:54:37] And even here in this plague, the some
[1:54:40] people think it's a a misquote or a
[1:54:44] error in the scripture. It's not. Paul
[1:54:47] says there was in one day 23,000
[1:54:50] perished in the plague. And if you go to
[1:54:52] numbers, it says 24,000, but it does it
[1:54:55] doesn't say in one day. It says that
[1:54:57] 24,000 died because of the plague. And
[1:55:00] Apostle Paul says 23,000 died in one
[1:55:02] day.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; So that was that that was the
[1:55:05] difference. But that's what it brought
[1:55:06] them to.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; It just brought them to a massive
[1:55:09] defeat. I thank God.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; No, I'm done. But I thank God
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; that we can have this kind of word
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; and this kind of thought and this
[1:55:19] message. People think it's it's a
[1:55:21] judgmental message. I say it's so
[1:55:23] positive.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; It is such a wonderful message. It is
[1:55:27] the first message I've ever heard that
[1:55:29] told me who I am and the victory I can
[1:55:32] enjoy. and I have the abstract and I
[1:55:35] have the whole inheritance. It belongs
[1:55:37] to me. There is no other message like
[1:55:39] that. Friends, we ought to we ought to
[1:55:41] rejoice. We ought to embrace it. It's
[1:55:43] Christ. We ought to say, "Thank you,
[1:55:45] Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me?
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Balcony. You agree with it?
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; I see some of you and I know that you've
[1:55:57] even you've even put into practice. You
[1:56:00] have even brought into effect that kind
[1:56:03] of faith and you have the results of it
[1:56:05] sitting right here amongst us.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; So we are not of those that draw back.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] We are not of those that draw back, but
[1:56:30] we are those that
[1:56:32] have entered in, are entering in. But
[1:56:35] we're all at different stages of
[1:56:36] entering in. But those of you, and there
[1:56:39] may be those of you here today and
[1:56:42] you've not come yet to your Kadesh
[1:56:44] Barnea. Don't forget, it's your Kades
[1:56:47] Barnea, your personal Kadis Barnea. And
[1:56:49] when you arrive there and you see
[1:56:53] this is what really belongs to me, don't
[1:56:56] pull back.
[1:56:58] Don't pull back. Don't say, "Well, it
[1:57:01] it's it's too big a thing. It's too
[1:57:03] great a giant. Too hard for me to hold
[1:57:06] my testimony here at this job."
[1:57:09] Milk of Revar is not here. So, I'll just
[1:57:11] say this. When he came into this message
[1:57:16] and it it was so quickened to him. It
[1:57:18] was it was such a living. It was such a
[1:57:20] joy. He was so thrilled out of what God
[1:57:23] brought him out of
[1:57:30] and he can tell you that if he wants to.
[1:57:34] But I have a little Italian barber I go
[1:57:38] to and he knew Milco from many years ago
[1:57:42] in the airline industry and he says to
[1:57:45] me on a regular basis, "Oh, Mr. Biscll.
[1:57:48] Oh, Mr. Biscll. He said, "You've done
[1:57:50] You don't know what you did for Milk." I
[1:57:52] said, "I didn't do it. It was Christ
[1:57:53] that did." I know. I know. I know. But,
[1:57:55] but if you only knew what you did. If
[1:57:56] you only knew what he was. Well, I knew
[1:57:58] a little bit what he was, but when he
[1:57:59] came in and he got and and he came to
[1:58:02] the knowledge of the message. Actually,
[1:58:03] he came to the church, a little log
[1:58:04] church to get somebody out of the
[1:58:06] church. That was his intent. I got to
[1:58:08] get him out of this cult. And he says
[1:58:10] that night, he just got like a bullet
[1:58:12] right between the eyes and that was the
[1:58:13] end of it.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:17] Then he's in he's a purser on the
[1:58:18] airlines, you know, he's he's top guy
[1:58:21] there in the in the cabin. So the girls
[1:58:25] are coming in and those were the days
[1:58:26] where I know the girls had their tight
[1:58:29] curls that looked like he said look like
[1:58:31] a dog that just got washed.
[1:58:34] So he told them, he said, "You look just
[1:58:37] like a dog that just got washed, you
[1:58:39] know." And they were offended. And so
[1:58:42] they tried the union and everything
[1:58:43] else. And they tried to fire him and
[1:58:45] they couldn't fire him. And the union
[1:58:47] leader says, "Milco, you just have to
[1:58:49] stop. You have to stop speaking like
[1:58:52] this." He says, "I'm trying, but just
[1:58:55] show me the stop button. If you can show
[1:58:56] me the stop button, I'll push it, but I
[1:58:58] can't find I can't find the stop
[1:59:00] button."
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; Amenise God.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And finally, you know, I mean, they're
[1:59:05] they're serving the liquor and
[1:59:06] everything else. And he found everything
[1:59:08] in this message was coming right in
[1:59:10] conflict with his job and everything
[1:59:12] that he was called to do. Well, he
[1:59:14] wasn't going to give up the message.
[1:59:18] So, you know, he just had everybody else
[1:59:21] do all the all the work he didn't want
[1:59:22] to do. And then finally one day he said,
[1:59:25] "No, I can't. I just can't I can't stay
[1:59:27] with this. I just got to check out."
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Go and ask him when he gets home. Ask
[1:59:33] him if he's ever sorry he checked out.
[1:59:35] Now he's not sorry he checked out but
[1:59:37] the message run in conflict with it
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; and you find it but if you looked at it
[1:59:41] and said what am I going to do without
[1:59:43] this job what am I going to do without
[1:59:44] this salary what am I going to do this
[1:59:46] is a giant well for him it was that I'm
[1:59:49] not advocating that for you but you know
[1:59:53] we all run into our giants
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; and don't don't think you're going to
[1:59:56] have this land and all of this don't
[1:59:58] think you're going to have it without a
[2:00:00] struggle
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; you're going to have battles and when
[2:00:03] you face a battle say God gave me this
[2:00:05] land
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; and I'm not stopping.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give it up.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Well, let's stand
[2:00:16] and I want to sing in the city where the
[2:00:19] lamb is the light.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; In the city where there I wonder,
[2:00:23] brother Jonathan, if you'll come out and
[2:00:24] give give me a hand, please.
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:33] Hallelujah.
[2:00:36] Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Remember to pray for the folks in China,
[2:00:39] will you?
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Pray for these ministers. Pray for them
[2:00:45] earnestly because quite frankly,
[2:00:49] uh I think that they're going to get the
[2:00:51] attention of the authorities and they
[2:00:53] really need God's wisdom and guidance.
[2:00:56] They need it very much. They need our
[2:00:58] prayers and our support that way. Amen.
[2:01:02] All right.
[2:01:08] There's a country
[2:01:10] on the starry sky.
[2:01:14] There's a city where there never comes a
[2:01:17] night.
[2:01:20] If we're faithful, we shall go there by
[2:01:23] and
[2:01:25] to the city where the lamb is alive.
[2:01:31] Oh, in that city where the land is
[2:01:34] alive.
[2:01:37] In that city where they're coming now.
[2:01:43] I'm a man over there. And when to
[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:50] where is life?
[2:01:54] Here we have our days of sunshine. But
[2:01:57] we know
[2:02:00] that the sun which shines upon us now so
[2:02:03] bright
[2:02:05] will be you
[2:02:10] [Music]
[2:02:12] see where
[2:02:17] I see
[2:02:22] [Music]
[2:02:35] Where the lamb is alive
[2:02:40] [Music]
[2:02:42] and the day
[2:02:45] shall be one eternal day without
[2:02:51] our tears shall be forever.
[2:02:56] In that city where the lamb is alive.
[2:03:01] Oh, we can see where the lamb is.
[2:03:07] We can see where they come.
[2:03:13] I'm a man over there and we care. I'm
[2:03:18] aware.
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:24] Here we have our disappointed all the
[2:03:27] while
[2:03:29] and our fondest hopes but with bitter
[2:03:35] by night we make the morning r.
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:46] In that city where the land is alive.
[2:03:52] In the city where they're coming
[2:03:59] over there and went free to
[2:04:03] not going where
[2:04:08] we're just going to take that last verse
[2:04:09] once more, but I want to I want to say
[2:04:11] this as a in a concluding thought.
[2:04:15] You know, you're sitting here today
[2:04:17] seated in this service and we look way
[2:04:19] back there to the people that were under
[2:04:22] Moses and we think, well, you know, the
[2:04:25] things that I face are are they're real
[2:04:27] things. Hey, they were real things back
[2:04:30] there. They said our children's going to
[2:04:33] be killed.
[2:04:36] Our wives are going to be killed. That
[2:04:38] was a real problem.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; They had real justifiable problems.
[2:04:44] and they were confronting it
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; right then and there.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; So don't think for a minute that what we
[2:04:51] have is real problem. What they had is
[2:04:53] just kind of up here someplace. They had
[2:04:55] real problems. Our choice is you can
[2:04:59] focus all your attention on that
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; or you can decide I'm not going to let
[2:05:05] that occupy me
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; because when that's done there'll be
[2:05:09] something else
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; to occupy me. There'll be something else
[2:05:12] to consume me. I'm not going to allow
[2:05:14] that to consume me. I'm going to What am
[2:05:17] I going to allow to consume me? What God
[2:05:19] has said is mine. What God has declared,
[2:05:22] this is yours. You have a personal
[2:05:25] victory.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan take it away from you.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; You have a personal promise. You have a
[2:05:31] personal Kades Barnea and say, "I am
[2:05:35] going to I'm going to inherit everything
[2:05:39] that God has promised me."
[2:05:43] I'll tell you what, friends.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; The word is completely open.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; The seven seals are open. The word has
[2:05:50] come.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word has come. And it's not
[2:05:53] just a bunch of phrase, nice phrases.
[2:05:55] It's a reality. And that is our land.
[2:05:57] That is your inheritance.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; And Satan will come. He's come your way.
[2:06:02] He's come my way. You felt it.
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Like the songwriter says, "I can feel
[2:06:12] the hand of Satan as he's tried to press
[2:06:16] me sore."
[2:06:19] He has been before the father asking him
[2:06:22] to press me more.
[2:06:25] Hallelujah.
[2:06:28] But God had confidence in Job. Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; And God has confidence in the bride of
[2:06:34] Jesus Christ. And I bring it down to you
[2:06:36] individually. God has confidence in you.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Would you accept that?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Elijah said that. Not brother Ed. Elijah
[2:06:47] said that. God's got confidence in you.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; I say thank God.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; I accept that.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; In that city where the lamb is the light
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; in that city where
[2:07:10] I
[2:07:13] went through to
[2:07:15] I
[2:07:17] lamb is alive.
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:21] Brother David, Adam, I'm going to have
[2:07:23] you come and ask God's blessing on the
[2:07:25] people. Dismiss us in
[2:07:29] and a word of prayer. God bless you,
[2:07:31] brother David.
[2:07:33] Our dear heavenly father, it's a
[2:07:35] privilege once again, Lord Jesus, to be
[2:07:37] found in your house. And father, we
[2:07:39] know, dear God, that it's it's only by
[2:07:41] your grace that we can stand here, Lord.
[2:07:44] Father, from many walks of life, from
[2:07:45] many experiences, from many different
[2:07:48] things, Lord, but you brought us
[2:07:49] together in you. And we're very
[2:07:51] grateful, Lord Jesus, that we've we're
[2:07:53] able to stand here as one body, as one
[2:07:56] people, oh Lord God,
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Father, saved by grace,
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; washed by the blood of Jesus Christ,
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; kept by the word, Lord, and Father, led
[2:08:04] by the Holy Spirit. Father, we want to
[2:08:07] come before you, Lord, as one body to
[2:08:09] ask for your forgiveness, to ask for
[2:08:11] your mercy, Lord, to ask, Lord Jesus,
[2:08:13] that you would wash us from every
[2:08:14] ailment.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; As we've heard your word, Lord, we're
[2:08:18] reminded of the scripture that Father,
[2:08:19] you have sent your word and you've
[2:08:20] healed the people.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; We're also reminded, dear God, that
[2:08:24] without vision, the people perish, Lord.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; And Father, you're so merciful to preach
[2:08:28] your word and declare the victory and
[2:08:30] declare what you have ordained for us.
[2:08:32] But father, we know that we cannot
[2:08:34] attain it in ourselves, Lord. We can try
[2:08:36] and try in our human minds, in our in
[2:08:37] our in our efforts, Lord God. But we
[2:08:40] know that it takes the quickening of the
[2:08:41] Holy Spirit.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; And Father, I pray tonight, Lord Jesus,
[2:08:45] is that as your word has been preached,
[2:08:47] Father, we present it back to you, dear
[2:08:49] God, knowing that you cannot lie and you
[2:08:51] cannot fail. And we pray, dear God, let
[2:08:54] the Holy Spirit take these words, bring
[2:08:56] it to each heart, oh God. Make it a
[2:08:58] reality, Father, from the youngest to
[2:09:01] the oldest, Lord Jesus. As we've heard
[2:09:03] tonight, Lord, it has nothing to do with
[2:09:05] age, Lord, but it has to do with the
[2:09:08] commitment of each individual, the
[2:09:10] resolve down in our hearts to believe
[2:09:12] your word, dear God, and go forward.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; We know the enemy will try and fight and
[2:09:16] present what he may. But Father, we are
[2:09:19] just committing ourselves into your
[2:09:20] hands, dear God, just asking, dear God,
[2:09:22] that you will protect your people, that
[2:09:24] you will protect your word. For we have
[2:09:27] believed your word, Lord. And we have
[2:09:28] confidence in you. Take control, dear
[2:09:31] God. Bless your minister. Bless all your
[2:09:33] ministers, Lord, who who walk with the
[2:09:35] burden of the word, Lord Jesus. Father,
[2:09:38] bless your people who receive your word,
[2:09:39] dear God. And Father, let all the glory
[2:09:42] and all the praise bring be brought back
[2:09:44] to you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:46] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:50] God bless you.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; God bless you. uh you'll greet one
[2:09:55] another and give them a a handshake
[2:09:57] that'll be an encouragement to them.
[2:09:59] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:10:05] Thanks Jonathan.
