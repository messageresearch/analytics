[0:00] King James Bible the Book of Genesis
[0:04] chapter 11 and the whole earth was of
[0:06] one language and of one speech and it
[0:09] came to pass as they journeyed from the
[0:11] East that they found a plane in the land
[0:14] of shenar and they dwelt there and they
[0:16] said one to another go to let us make
[0:19] brick and burn them thly and they had
[0:22] brick for stone and slime had they for
[0:24] Mortar and they said go to let us build
[0:28] us a city and a tower whose top May
[0:30] reach unto heaven and let us make us a
[0:33] name lest we be scattered abroad upon
[0:35] the face of the whole earth and the Lord
[0:37] came down to see the city and the tower
[0:40] which the children of men builded and
[0:42] the Lord said behold the people is one
[0:45] and they have all one language and this
[0:48] they begin to do and now nothing will be
[0:50] restrained from them which they have
[0:52] imagined to do go to let us go down and
[0:55] they confound their language that they
[0:57] may not understand one another's speech
[1:00] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[1:02] then upon the face of all the Earth and
[1:04] they left off to build a city therefore
[1:07] is the name of it called Babel because
[1:09] the Lord did their confound the language
[1:11] of all the Earth and from then did the
[1:13] Lord scatter them abroad upon the face
[1:15] of all the Earth we are told that the
[1:19] new system of this denomination of
[1:21] bringing this year World Council
[1:23] churches will bring peace to the Earth
[1:26] what a disregard what a nasty slam am in
[1:30] the face of Christ Lord what an
[1:33] irreverent sacriligious thing that is so
[1:37] the
[1:38] devil a man can organize something
[1:41] better than God can send him the Tower
[1:44] of
[1:45] Babel it's another babbling and musall
[1:50] peace on Earth a false Messiah an
[1:53] antichrist in his teaching amen how are
[1:56] you going to throw these denominations
[1:58] together when they won't even they even
[2:00] agree with one another now when they
[2:01] broke up in little systems like that how
[2:03] about all joining together and getting
[2:05] over
[2:06] there see it's a false setup it's all
[2:10] done to throw protestantism into
[2:13] romanism a false Antichrist teaching
[2:17] God's kingdom is not of this world Jesus
[2:20] said so my kingdom is not of this world
[2:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:25] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:27] sound the mystery of God should be
[2:30] finished as he hath declared to his
[2:32] servants the prophets
