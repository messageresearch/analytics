[1:22] Oh, blessed be,
[1:27] blessed be
[1:30] your name. Let's sing the second verse.
[1:32] You, oh Lord, are the deep.
[1:35] You, oh Lord,
[1:38] are the deep that I have searched for.
[1:42] the everflowing
[1:44] fountain
[1:45] that my heart always thirsts for. You're
[1:49] the one who makes me whole.
[1:53] You're the lover of my soul.
[1:57] And whatever comes my way.
[2:01] I know you're in control. So I say,
[2:05] "Blessed
[2:06] be."
[2:08] Oh, blessed
[2:10] be.
[2:13] Blessed be
[2:16] your name.
[2:20] Oh, blessed be

[2:40] that you are holy.
[2:43] You are holy
[2:46] God
[2:48] and we lift up your name
[2:53] and give gloryy.
[2:57] We give gloryy to you. We proclaim,
[3:02] Lord, and let your people
[3:06] holy. We proclaim
[3:10] that you are holy.
[3:13] You are holy,

[3:23] and give gloryy.
[3:27] We give glory to. Sing that once more.
[3:32] Oh, and let your people

[4:20] Oh, blessed be.
[4:24] Oh, blessed be.
[4:28] Blessed be
[4:31] your name.
[4:34] Hallelujah.
[4:36] Number 529, brother John.
[4:40] Oh, that thrills my soul. Listening to
[4:43] Kinsman Redeemer last night and just a
[4:47] paragraph that jumped out at us. He
[4:48] says, "The word made a human being
[4:51] become a kinsman. He become a man. Oh,
[4:54] he become death that through his death I
[4:56] might become life. He became a sinner
[4:59] that through his righteousness I might
[5:01] have life. He became poor that I through
[5:03] his poverty I might be made rich. He
[5:06] became what I was so that I might
[5:08] through his grace become what he is. Oh
[5:10] my. Then talk about powers of God. Now
[5:13] that's exactly the scripture. That's
[5:15] what the scripture says. That we might
[5:18] be what love the father has shed upon
[5:20] us. that we which were sinners, aliens
[5:22] away from God, might be drawn nigh unto
[5:25] God in so much that we become sons and
[5:27] daughters of God, not servants.
[5:29] Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful that
[5:31] we've been made sons and daughters of
[5:32] God? Amen. Today, we've come to remember
[5:35] the sacrifice that he made for us with
[5:37] communion tonight. Believe we're going
[5:39] to start the service at 4:00 this
[5:41] evening. So, those who have come to be
[5:42] with us have a little extra time. We're
[5:44] looking forward to a wonderful day.
[5:46] Amen. Why don't we stand and sing, Who
[5:47] can cheer the heart like Jesus?
[5:51] Oh, who
[5:54] can cheer the heart like Jesus?
[6:01] By
[6:03] his presence all divine,
[6:09] oh so true, true and tender, pure and
[6:16] preious
[6:19] and oh
[6:22] how blessed to call him mine.
[6:28] Oh, and all
[6:31] that thrills my soul is Jesus.
[6:38] Oh, he
[6:40] is more than life
[6:43] to me.
[6:48] and the fairest of 10,000
[6:56] in in my blessed Lord I see love of
[7:03] Christ. Oh, what love, love of Christ so
[7:09] freely gi
[7:14] and praise
[7:16] of God beyond deep,
[7:20] mercy higher
[7:23] and mercy
[7:25] higher than the heaven.
[7:31] How much deeper
[7:35] than the deepest sea?
[7:40] Oh, and all
[7:43] that thrills my soul is Jesus.
[7:49] Yes, he
[7:52] is more than life.
[7:58] [Music]
[8:01] The fairest of 10,000
[8:08] in
[8:09] my blessing, Lord. What a wonderful
[8:13] redemption.
[8:16] Oh, and what what a wonderful
[8:21] redemption
[8:25] never can
[8:30] know.
[8:33] Oh, how my s
[8:36] [Music]
[8:37] more like
[8:42] it can be wider
[8:47] than the snow.
[8:51] Oh, and all
[8:54] that is my soul is Jesus.
[9:01] Oh, he
[9:03] is more than life to me.
[9:09] [Music]
[9:12] The fairest of 10,000
[9:19] in
[9:20] my blessed Lord. I see every need
[9:27] where
[9:29] every need is handy
[9:34] and every good
[9:39] in him I see
[9:43] it's on his strength on his strength
[9:47] divide.
[9:51] Oh, is he all in all to you this
[9:53] morning?
[9:55] Who is all in all to me?
[10:01] And all
[10:03] that thrills my soul is Jesus.
[10:10] Oh, he
[10:12] is more than life to me.
[10:21] The fairest of 10,000
[10:28] in
[10:29] my blessed Lord
[10:32] by the crystal flowing river.
[10:36] Oh, and by
[10:38] the crystal flowing wind. Not just
[10:43] words, it's a reality with the ransom.
[10:47] The ransom I will sing
[10:51] forever
[10:53] [Music]
[10:54] and
[10:56] forever
[10:57] and
[11:00] ever. Oh I will praise
[11:05] and glorify
[11:07] the king.
[11:10] Oh, and all
[11:13] that thrills my soul is Jesus.
[11:20] Oh, he
[11:22] is more than life to me.
[11:28] You
[11:31] the fairest of 10,000
[11:38] in
[11:39] my blessed Lord I see.
[11:46] Once my soul
[11:49] was arrayed
[11:51] from the heavenly
[11:54] way
[11:56] and was
[11:59] in love
[12:01] as me.
[12:06] Oh but my savior
[12:09] above he gave me peace,
[12:13] joy and love.
[12:16] When he reach
[12:18] down his head
[12:21] for me. When he reach
[12:27] down his hand
[12:30] for me.
[12:34] Oh

[12:39] for me.
[12:44] I was lost
[12:46] and undone
[12:49] without God
[12:51] for his son
[12:53] when he laid down his head.
[12:59] For I was nearing despair.
[13:02] Oh, I was nearing
[13:05] despair.
[13:12] when he show
[13:14] me that I
[13:17] could be free
[13:20] and then he lifted
[13:24] my feet. He gave all
[13:29] of me. Oh, when he reach down his hand
[13:35] for me.
[13:39] Oh, when he reach Oh, down his head
[13:44] for me.
[13:53] for me.
[13:57] Oh, I was lost
[14:00] and done without God
[14:05] for his son when he laid down his head.
[14:12] How my heart does rejoice.
[14:15] Oh, how my heart
[14:19] rejoice.
[14:20] Oh, since I made him my choice.
[14:26] Oh, now to him.
[14:30] Now I
[14:34] now I
[14:37] love I am secure
[14:41] from my heart since he reached
[14:46] down his hand for me
[14:54] down his head
[14:57] for
[15:00] Yes.
[15:10] Oh, I was lost and undone
[15:15] without God,
[15:18] his son.
[15:20] and he reached down his hand.
[15:24] Since the Lord gave me peace, oh, and
[15:28] since the Lord
[15:31] gave me peace, heavenly joy may never
[15:36] cease. And Lord, I give
[15:40] all my life
[15:43] unto thee.
[15:46] Guide my feet and hold my hand
[15:52] with me.
[15:53] I may stand for you
[15:58] down your hand
[16:00] for me.

[16:06] down
[16:09] for me.
[16:16] way down
[16:18] for me.
[16:22] Oh, I was lost in the
[16:28] glorious
[16:30] son. Oh, when he reached down. Let's
[16:34] sing that fourth verse once again. Since
[16:36] the Lord gave me peace.
[16:39] Oh, and since the Lord, he gave me
[16:44] peace.
[16:47] Never cease. And Lord, I give all of my
[16:53] life
[16:54] unto thee.
[16:57] Just guide my feet, all my head. Bread
[17:03] with me. I may stand
[17:08] before you reach down your hand for me.
[17:13] Sing my chorus once again. When he
[17:15] reached Oh, when he reached down his
[17:19] hand for me.
[17:24] Oh,
[17:25] he raised
[17:28] his hand
[17:30] for me.
[17:34] I was lost and undone
[17:39] without
[17:41] his son when he
[17:45] fell his head
[17:48] for me.

[21:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[21:34] Hallelujah. We have a couple testimonies
[21:36] this morning. And we just want to
[21:37] rejoice with our brothers and sisters.
[21:39] Sister Shannon Smoutz has a testimony. A
[21:42] month or so ago, I brought my
[21:43] six-year-old Elizabeth out for prayer
[21:45] for a kidney reflux. We thank God for
[21:47] his healing power. She began to exhibit
[21:50] evidence of another infection. So, we
[21:51] called on the saints to pray and within
[21:53] about 2 hours, the symptoms were gone.
[21:54] Glory to God and thank you to all who
[21:56] pray. Amen. Also, a testimony from my
[21:59] brother Dominic Gonzalez. I'd like to
[22:01] thank God for keeping me safe and
[22:03] watching over me. On Thursday, I was in
[22:05] a wreck that completely totaled my
[22:06] truck, but by the grace of God, I came
[22:08] out of it unhe hurt. God still watches
[22:10] over his bride. Amen.
[22:12] Hallelujah.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We do want to remember a couple
[22:15] prayer requests. Excuse me. Our brother
[22:17] Ricardo has asked us to remember sister
[22:19] Shante. She's home with a stomach flu.
[22:22] Also a request from our brother Alan
[22:24] King. Please pray for my daughter and
[22:26] sister who are having exploratory
[22:29] procedures this week. and also brother
[22:31] Milo's wife. At the same time, we'll be
[22:33] having the same procedure. We just pray
[22:35] that the God that our Lord God will
[22:36] speak to their hearts. Amen.
[22:39] Also a request from our brother Norm
[22:41] Wood. He requests prayer for himself for
[22:43] healing and strength and asked that we
[22:46] would remember his wife, Sister Luis, in
[22:48] prayer. She is having cataract surgery
[22:49] this Tuesday. Amen. I just wonder,
[22:52] Brother John Andes, would you come open
[22:53] the service for us in a word of prayer
[22:55] if there's something on your heart?
[22:57] Amen. healing streams of life. Amen. We
[23:00] just sang the song. It about sums it all
[23:02] up. Everything we have need of. Amen.
[23:04] Just hold it before the Lord as we go to
[23:06] prayer at this time. Brother John.
[23:08] Thank you.
[23:11] Let's just hold our re request up to the
[23:14] Lord Jesus today.
[23:18] Heavenly Father,
[23:21] oh God, we're just under such an
[23:23] anticipation today of your presence,
[23:25] Lord. already sensing you're among us.
[23:28] Lord, I wonder what kind of day it was
[23:31] when Abraham was sitting in the tent
[23:34] door. God, all of a sudden, over the
[23:37] horizon
[23:38] came your presence in Melzdc. Lord, by
[23:42] the end of that day, Lord, the promise
[23:44] had already been spoken that had the
[23:47] power to change his body, Sarah's body.
[23:50] Lord, the promised son was on the way.
[23:55] Judgment was coming to Sodom and
[23:57] Gomorrah. But Abraham was having
[24:00] fellowship,
[24:01] breaking bread, having communion,
[24:04] fellowship, bread and wine and the oil,
[24:08] God. And today we've approached your
[24:11] house, God. Oh, what a day, Lord, as we
[24:14] sit in the tent of your house. What kind
[24:16] of day is it going to be, Lord?
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Is today the day when the dead in Christ
[24:22] shall rise?
[24:25] Will it be a day like today, Lord, when
[24:27] our bodies will be changed?
[24:30] &gt;&gt; It's a day, Lord, when the victory and
[24:32] the battle must be won for our fallen
[24:35] brother, Lord, our brother that's gone
[24:37] astray.
[24:39] I pray the Holy Ghost God would co so
[24:42] come into this room Lord into this
[24:44] building out across the internet Jesus
[24:48] for we have come into another season
[24:50] when the bride recognizes who she is and
[24:54] that the battle is raging Satan is
[24:58] fighting and a great attack against the
[25:00] bride of Christ and it's in that season
[25:04] that you've called a communion table
[25:06] Lord Lord Lord, our hearts rejoice,
[25:09] Lord, that we are not of the world and
[25:11] we're not just drifting with Leodysia,
[25:14] but you've called us into a secret
[25:16] place. That our pastor, Lord, could feel
[25:19] led to have a communion service. And
[25:22] that you could create a hunger and an
[25:25] expectation, God, and in the body here
[25:28] that we all could draw together in our
[25:30] faith, God. And we pray even now
[25:33] forgiveness and repentance of any sin.
[25:37] Jesus, we don't want any hindrance. God,
[25:40] I pray if there's any flesh, any
[25:43] hindrance in our hearts, God, that right
[25:46] here today, God, we could start as we
[25:49] closed Wednesday night as our brother
[25:51] Tom brought the message of the Lord.
[25:54] That we could end this service at the
[25:56] altar, God. that we could start this
[25:58] meeting the way we ended it Wednesday
[26:00] night God right at the altar God just
[26:04] repenting God just laying it all out
[26:07] Father
[26:09] for you come to those that are honest
[26:11] and broken those that are willing to say
[26:14] Lord I want to take all the cup Lord
[26:18] &gt;&gt; whatever is in this cup Lord I want to
[26:20] drink it all Lord
[26:22] &gt;&gt; we take the bread Lord as you Melzdc
[26:25] king of Salem
[26:27] peace distributed out today. I pray that
[26:30] our hearts would be quivering, God, for
[26:33] your presence is so near that every
[26:35] request and every hunger as we just lift
[26:38] up our hands throughout the congregation
[26:41] and out across the the internet and the
[26:43] phone hookups, Lord, the supernatural is
[26:46] taking place. Lord, thank you for the
[26:48] testimonies this week. Lord,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; our brother Gonzalez, Lord, saved from
[26:54] what could have been a tragic accident,
[26:56] Lord, and you saved him, Lord. We want
[26:59] to rejoice with the family today, God.
[27:01] And thank you, Jesus, Lord, for keeping
[27:04] our teenagers, Lord, and keeping our
[27:07] families, Lord, and healing the sick,
[27:09] Lord, and raising the dead, Jesus, and
[27:13] open blinded eyes, and the crippled are
[27:16] walking today, God.
[27:19] There's needs in the body, Lord. Our
[27:21] brother Norm Wood, Lord, that's given
[27:23] himself, Lord. And I pray you'd
[27:26] strengthen him today, Jesus. Sister
[27:29] Louise with his cataract surgery. Bless
[27:31] her eyes, Lord. Touch her, Jesus. Touch
[27:34] our brother Alan King's family, Lord.
[27:37] His daughter and his other relative, our
[27:40] brother Milo's family, Jesus, as we lay
[27:43] hands on these requests. And many hearts
[27:45] are are needy today for your touch,
[27:48] Lord, and for your provision, God, and
[27:50] families. Our hearts are burdened, God,
[27:53] with many needs, Lord. But you're a
[27:55] great God, Lord. And I pray that you'd
[27:57] blow out all the flu of unbelief today.
[28:01] May there be no hindrance, God. As our
[28:03] pastor stands behind the sacred desk,
[28:06] may the Holy Ghost go to every soul and
[28:09] every life. May bodies be delivered,
[28:12] God, from the chains of sickness. May
[28:15] doubts and fears leave the people. May
[28:18] the chains and and and the bars be
[28:21] broken, Lord Jesus Christ. May souls be
[28:25] saved. May hearts be filled, God. May
[28:29] your revelation be flowing freely today,
[28:31] God. Lord Jesus, would you meet with us
[28:34] today, this whole day, Lord, that the
[28:37] atmosphere would be one of your very
[28:39] great nearness.
[28:42] As we kiss you, Lord, as we embrace you,
[28:45] as we pray, God, for your nearness, may
[28:48] today be a wonderful day, God, of
[28:51] communion and fellowship and
[28:53] relationship, God, greater than we've
[28:56] ever had before, Lord. That by the end
[28:59] of the day, we like Abraham and Sarah
[29:02] could look out through the same tent
[29:04] door and say, "How great is our God? How
[29:08] great is his word? He's the greatest
[29:11] one.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; We're looking for you to manifest it,
[29:15] Lord.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Be glorified today in every situation
[29:20] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[29:23] Amen.

[33:53] [Music]
[34:09] I may have moments
[34:14] of unbelief,
[34:17] [Music]
[34:19] but I don't let it worry me.
[34:24] [Music]
[34:28] It's just a feeling.
[34:33] It comes and goes.
[34:38] My head may doubt, but my heart knows.
[34:46] My heart knows. Jesus loves me and he
[34:52] washed my sins away.
[34:56] I know he will keep me forever.
[35:04] [Music]
[35:05] No matter where my head is at,
[35:10] I will not be moved.
[35:15] Cuz my heart knows
[35:19] the truth.
[35:29] Satan will whisper,
[35:34] try to deceive,
[35:38] to make us doubt what we believe.
[35:44] [Music]
[35:47] But we know better.
[35:52] We have God's word.
[35:56] It's in my heart, safe and sure.
[36:03] My heart knows Jesus loves me. And he
[36:09] washed my sins away.
[36:13] I know he will keep me forever.
[36:22] No matter where my head is at, I will
[36:28] not be moved.
[36:31] Cuz my heart knows
[36:35] the truth.
[36:40] Waves of doubt may toss us
[36:44] to and fro,
[36:48] but we will sail on
[36:53] this.
[36:54] I know.
[36:57] [Music]
[36:58] My heart knows Jesus loves me and he
[37:04] washed my sins away.
[37:08] I know he will keep me forever.

[37:23] not be moved.
[37:26] Cuz my heart knows
[37:30] the truth.

[47:54] together?
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Find a place where
[48:00] everyone has a desire to worship the
[48:03] same God.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; We have a full day today.
[48:11] Tonight we'll have communion, Lord's
[48:13] supper, foot washing.
[48:16] We want to welcome and we're so thankful
[48:19] to have our brother Ivan and sister
[48:21] Aanth back after. Brother Ivan, where
[48:25] are you? If you stand up, please. You're
[48:27] right there. Sister Aenth.
[48:31] [Music]
[48:39] So good to have you, Brother Ivan.
[48:42] God bless you. Uh you've traveled so
[48:46] much. Uh Brother Ivan, maybe you can at
[48:49] least just come down here so we can
[48:51] everyone can see you. Sister Is God
[48:54] bless you. I know you have your babies
[48:57] and they've just had a long trip. They
[48:59] just arrived home yesterday
[49:03] and uh many lives have been touched
[49:07] &gt;&gt; in China.
[49:09] Many many lives have been spoken to,
[49:12] touched by the message.
[49:14] We are so thankful
[49:18] uh through our brother Ivan's burden and
[49:20] he's had a real burden to see that the
[49:23] message gets out and uh we are part of
[49:27] that. We are part of that. Come up here,
[49:30] brother Ivan. I have to give you a hug.
[49:34] Oh my goodness.
[49:37] Praise the Lord. Why don't you greet the
[49:39] people? Just say a word of greeting. And
[49:42] we have time for all of this, don't we?
[49:45] Yeah. Just give a word of greeting.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Uh great how everyone. Uh really really
[49:51] wonderful to be back uh to sing the
[49:53] wonderful songs and you don't know when
[49:56] you don't sing those songs for nine
[49:58] months. It's really
[50:00] makes different when you worship
[50:02] together and you know everyone is have
[50:04] the one chord and one faith and that's
[50:07] really really wonderful thing when you
[50:10] go to face the opposite against the
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and you when you go go back to your own
[50:16] people I mean go back to your family
[50:19] really family that's um exciting
[50:22] exciting to see all of you thank you for
[50:24] your prayer support and love and uh so
[50:28] that we can come back safely without you
[50:31] and support everything and we won't uh
[50:34] make that trip so success. So um thank
[50:39] you. God bless all of you. God bless you
[50:42] daddy.

[50:43] Chinese so they can understand.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:58] Amen. That sounded almost better than
[51:00] English.
[51:03] Well, it'll be fine for the music. Um,
[51:11] and we want to be
[51:14] show our appreciation also for the
[51:16] saints that are here from Seattle,
[51:18] Tacoma that have come. We say God bless
[51:22] you. We pray that today will be also
[51:26] special day for all of you as well.
[51:29] We're so happy when we're able to come
[51:31] together like that.
[51:33] Want to also mention once again even
[51:36] though we have
[51:38] uh spoken of it a wee bit on on
[51:41] Wednesday night but so that you can make
[51:44] your plans accordingly. We are having
[51:47] special uh 40th year anniversary
[51:50] meetings. That'll be our 40th year here
[51:54] in this area in Cloverdale,
[51:57] Pacific Northwest.
[51:59] And uh that will be May the 18th,
[52:04] 19th, and 20th, and the 21st. 21st is
[52:09] Monday, but it's a long weekend here on
[52:12] the Canadian side. The following weekend
[52:15] is a memorial day on the US side, but
[52:19] we're going to uh have uh special
[52:24] things. Perhaps we may I have invited a
[52:27] a brother over from Africa, a young man,
[52:31] and he's probably streaming the meeting
[52:33] right now. Uh I've just been impressed
[52:36] over the last several years, probably
[52:38] three, four years. He has he has worked
[52:43] tirelessly
[52:44] taking the message and ministering and
[52:47] whatever more and uh has sacrificed a
[52:52] great deal. And I thought it would be a
[52:54] wonderful thing for young men, young
[52:57] women, especially senior young people to
[53:01] perhaps just hear his testimony and hear
[53:03] what God is doing in his life. He
[53:06] ministers most every Sunday. So, uh
[53:09] we're we're really thankful uh for that.
[53:14] Uh tonight, although we're having the
[53:16] Lord's table in communion, I have felt
[53:18] something on my heart. And so I thought
[53:21] I would just mention it. Uh I want to
[53:24] have a prayer line tonight.
[53:26] Uh not just to pray. I do not want to
[53:29] have those come say I just want to be
[53:31] closer to God and you know, I need the
[53:34] Holy Spirit. We know if you need the
[53:36] Holy Spirit, you you do the praying. You
[53:38] you pray. But there are people that are
[53:41] sick, people who've been afflicted,
[53:45] people who have not gotten an answer
[53:47] from God regarding that. And I would
[53:49] like to uh when we have the emblems of
[53:53] the Lord's table here,
[53:55] that can that must
[53:58] uh speak very
[54:00] very powerfully to us. It is finished.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; I am the resurrection and the life.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. It must say to us, "I am the
[54:10] Lord that health thee."
[54:12] &gt;&gt; All the promises of God must just come
[54:15] to life and explode with meaning
[54:18] &gt;&gt; at such a time as that.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And uh so I I have just felt I was in
[54:25] prayer this morning and I couldn't get
[54:27] this off my mind the last few days. Uh
[54:32] I was thinking of what we have uh
[54:34] available to us. This will be in line.
[54:37] And I'm almost getting you prepared for
[54:39] the message this morning. But if we are
[54:43] if there's anyone here or any one of us
[54:46] and I think we all get to this uh all of
[54:49] us arrive at this point at some time
[54:51] where we feel we just like we need a
[54:55] spiritual cleansing. We just need a
[54:57] spiritual cleansing. Well, I know one
[55:01] &gt;&gt; and we have a resource
[55:03] &gt;&gt; that can cleanse the most stubborn
[55:05] stain.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] and cleanse us and make us free. Just
[55:10] think about it. There is there's no one
[55:12] that we know of. You know, the world's
[55:14] always coming out with new cleaners and
[55:16] new cleansers and this will take this
[55:18] stain and this will remove the stain
[55:20] from grout or concrete or whatever more.
[55:23] We have a source
[55:25] &gt;&gt; that will cleanse the stain.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; From the soul of men and women,
[55:31] &gt;&gt; young people, we have a source.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; We may have need of healing. the doctors
[55:36] haven't been able to resolve it and
[55:39] medication hasn't been able to really
[55:43] bring a a complete healing to it. Uh but
[55:48] we have a remedy and we have one. We
[55:51] have a physician. Sometimes these
[55:53] phrases just become all too common to
[55:56] us. But we have someone and we've had
[56:00] some very stubborn
[56:02] uh uh afflictions that have been here in
[56:05] the congregation and I want to declare
[56:08] openly that as far as Calvar's concerned
[56:11] those things are broken.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And Satan's power is defeated
[56:17] &gt;&gt; and I think we need to come tonight with
[56:19] an unity of spirit.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. throughout this entire
[56:23] congregation. Even if you feel 100%, I
[56:26] feel fine, but I'm burdened for it.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to see people afflicted
[56:31] when they don't need to be afflicted.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; I feel like we need to go on the war
[56:38] path.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; We need to go on the offensive.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; We need to believe.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have questions that just
[56:49] nagging questions.
[56:51] uh about our lives. Well, we have one
[56:53] who's a dissolver of doubts.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; And we have one who's a discerner in the
[56:59] thoughts of the intents of the heart.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Right? I was reading in in one of the
[57:04] messages
[57:06] this morning and uh
[57:10] you know I was just reading some of the
[57:12] prayer line at the end of one of the
[57:14] services and I just thought United
[57:17] States
[57:20] has has had a son
[57:23] born in Kentucky and that nation's going
[57:27] to have an awful lot to answer for.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. I thought they have never
[57:33] had one rise out of the soil of that
[57:37] nation that did these things. And when
[57:40] we got in the car, I just said to my
[57:42] wife, just start at paragraph 170 and
[57:45] keep reading while I drive while I drive
[57:47] to church. And I just kept thinking
[57:50] about that. Wherever whenever did that
[57:54] ever happen in 200 years history of
[57:57] United States? Never. And God's going to
[58:00] call those leaders up. He's going to
[58:02] call those presidents up and ask them in
[58:05] the judgment, "What did you do with
[58:06] that?"
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And here we are today,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And this message has gone to the world.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; And he and and and
[58:16] we're so we're so privileged
[58:19] &gt;&gt; that it came and God gave us a heart.
[58:21] There was something in us that said
[58:23] would say yes to that.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen to that. Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Bypassed our reasoning and just said
[58:29] amen to that.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; And I give myself to that
[58:33] &gt;&gt; wholly and completely. I can tell you
[58:35] friends that would be the highest
[58:37] calling that that I can think of.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; What we have available to us.
[58:46] You know, a person may possess certain
[58:49] abilities and certain skills. And I'm
[58:52] just talking to you and it's kind of a
[58:54] prelude to the service or the message.
[58:57] But we have here a a wide variety of
[59:01] abilities and talents and gifts and uh
[59:05] you know resources and skills amongst
[59:07] the people. I was thinking of you that
[59:10] are teachers in the school and I was
[59:14] thinking of the principal
[59:16] or brother Terry Tatch and the other
[59:19] staff members that work there. I want to
[59:22] just give a word right from the very
[59:25] depths of my heart to this congregation
[59:28] and to those of you that work in the
[59:30] school. I want to say to the teachers
[59:34] that is not a teaching job.
[59:38] That is a ministry.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; It's first a ministry. I want to say to
[59:43] the students that happen to go to this
[59:45] school, uh if you are privileged and are
[59:48] able to go to the school or have been
[59:50] able to go to the school, you have
[59:52] either sat under a ministry or are
[59:55] sitting under a ministry. That is a
[59:58] calling and it should not be compared
[1:00:00] with other other jobs or similar jobs in
[1:00:04] the world. The world is on another
[1:00:07] planet
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; and we're on another planet. We're
[1:00:11] according to this scripture, we are in a
[1:00:14] heavenly place.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; We're in another dimension.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; And I I want to encourage the teachers
[1:00:21] do not look on it as just another
[1:00:24] profession.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; It's far more than that. Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Far more than that.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I just sometimes the world is so
[1:00:40] invasive
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; that it wants to uh make comparisons.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; No, I'm sorry. There's no comparison
[1:00:49] with the world. There's no comparison
[1:00:51] with what they cha teach and there's no
[1:00:54] comparison with the spirit that is to be
[1:00:57] in this school as compared to that
[1:00:59] school or this church as compared to
[1:01:02] other churches. There is to be made no
[1:01:04] comparison.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Because there's no comparison with the
[1:01:10] message.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; There's no similar message. And if we go
[1:01:14] back to Jesus Christ when he was
[1:01:16] revealing the invisible God to the
[1:01:18] people, he was he was in another world.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; He was in another world. This message
[1:01:24] did not come to us from any teaching,
[1:01:27] any learning of man.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; It's a divine revelation.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That has come.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And friends, we're going to
[1:01:37] wade through this thing.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Until this becomes a reality to the
[1:01:42] people.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to just give a couple of
[1:01:55] quotes here. I'm going to have you just
[1:01:57] while you're still sitting to read these
[1:01:59] with me.
[1:02:14] What does the vine do? It furnishes
[1:02:17] energy to the branches. Is that right?
[1:02:20] And the branches bear the fruit. Our
[1:02:23] hands are his hands. Our eyes are his
[1:02:27] eyes.
[1:02:28] Our life is his life.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He puts his life in us.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Now you folks believe that. Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; How do you compare that with something
[1:02:38] else?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; We live the life that he would live if
[1:02:43] he was here on earth in a physical form.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And while the body is sitting at the
[1:02:50] right hand of God making intercession
[1:02:52] for us all the time. Oh, isn't that
[1:02:55] beautiful?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; That just knocks all the kinks out of
[1:02:59] unbelief.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; I would like everybody to say that
[1:03:02] phrase with me. That just knocks all the
[1:03:06] kinks out of unbelief.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Now, do you believe that?
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Knocks all the kinks.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Out of unbelief.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; To me, he said to to me, it is it just
[1:03:20] makes it so real.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] There should be in my thought
[1:03:41] that if we have Zoey, God's life in us,
[1:03:45] we become sons of God and and amateur
[1:03:48] creators because he said, "Whatever you
[1:03:52] say, believe that what you say you shall
[1:03:55] have." And I've noticed that a lot of
[1:03:59] times I'd say things that I couldn't
[1:04:02] hardly think myself, but I'd say it
[1:04:05] anyhow. I come to find out it did happen
[1:04:09] just that way. I'd say things that I
[1:04:12] didn't hardly didn't mean for it to
[1:04:16] happen that way, but it did anyhow
[1:04:19] because I'd said it.
[1:04:27] A man could not heal the sick because it
[1:04:31] doesn't lay within a man's power to heal
[1:04:34] sick people. A doctor does not heal the
[1:04:38] sick. He only gives aid to the sick. God
[1:04:42] heals all the sickness. Amen.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; A doctor can set an arm if you broke it
[1:04:48] or sew up a place if you had cut it or
[1:04:52] move a tooth if it's bad or appendix
[1:04:55] out. But he cannot heal the place it
[1:04:58] come out of. Healing is a multiplication
[1:05:02] of cells that grows and mens and its
[1:05:05] life does that. Its life does that. And
[1:05:10] God is life. Amen.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; And he says that's in you.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; I want you to be thinking about while I
[1:05:19] speak this morning about what's in you.
[1:05:22] And I want to speak on the subject as
[1:05:25] his custom was.
[1:05:28] But the context of the service, the
[1:05:30] context of the message is the law
[1:05:33] within.
[1:05:35] We might say and you've heard Christ is
[1:05:38] in you and healing is in you and all
[1:05:42] these various things are in you but I
[1:05:46] want to define it and bring it much more
[1:05:50] succinctly if I can. A law is in you
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; and a law these are the laws of God
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; and all we need to do is appropriate
[1:06:01] them. You may stand if you would please
[1:06:03] and turn to Luke's Gospel
[1:06:06] the 4th chapter.
[1:06:17] Just before we read, we'll have a moment
[1:06:20] of prayer.
[1:06:22] Almighty God, how gracious you are.
[1:06:28] You have gathered this group of people
[1:06:30] that is that are here today.
[1:06:34] Others will be connected streaming and
[1:06:38] into their room into their homes
[1:06:41] into the place where they are perhaps a
[1:06:43] group of people together
[1:06:46] and whatever
[1:06:48] wherever we have gathered Lord and
[1:06:51] whatever is in our hearts or minds at
[1:06:54] this time. I pray, oh God, creator of
[1:06:59] heavens and earth and giver of every
[1:07:00] good gift, you'll take supreme control
[1:07:04] of every mind and every thought and
[1:07:06] bring everyone into subjection, Lord,
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God, what you have in
[1:07:12] in mind for this moment, for this
[1:07:14] service, Lord, and may it be
[1:07:16] accomplished. Let it be achieved, oh
[1:07:18] God. Let this day be a blessed day in
[1:07:21] your presence, I pray. And now anoint us
[1:07:24] for service Lord that your will shall be
[1:07:27] done and your name will be glorified in
[1:07:30] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:07:34] Starting at the 14th verse. And Jesus
[1:07:38] returned in the power of the spirit into
[1:07:40] into Galilee. And there went out a fame
[1:07:43] of him through all the region
[1:07:45] roundabout.
[1:07:47] And he taught in their synagogues being
[1:07:49] glorified of all.
[1:07:51] And he came to Nazareth where he had
[1:07:53] been brought up. And as his custom was,
[1:07:56] he went into the synagogue on the
[1:07:58] Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.
[1:08:02] And there was delivered unto him the
[1:08:04] book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he
[1:08:07] had opened the book, he found the place
[1:08:09] where it was written, "The spirit of the
[1:08:12] Lord is upon me, because he hath
[1:08:13] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[1:08:16] poor. He hath sent me to heal the
[1:08:19] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[1:08:22] the captives, and recovering of sight to
[1:08:25] the blind, to set at liberty them that
[1:08:28] are bruised, to preach the acceptable
[1:08:30] year of the Lord. And he closed the
[1:08:33] book, and he gave it again to the
[1:08:35] minister, and sat down. And the eyes of
[1:08:38] all of them that were in the synagogue
[1:08:40] were fastened on him. And he began to
[1:08:43] say unto them, "This day is this
[1:08:46] scripture fulfilled in your ears."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may have your
[1:08:52] seats.
[1:09:06] Jesus was a man who
[1:09:10] I have pondered upon him
[1:09:13] uh deeply
[1:09:16] because we
[1:09:18] are so
[1:09:20] worship him and honor him.
[1:09:23] But he was a man as I read the scripture
[1:09:26] that was intently observing
[1:09:30] uh what was happening around him
[1:09:33] outside.
[1:09:36] And besides that, I believe that he also
[1:09:40] was
[1:09:41] uh
[1:09:45] also looked very deeply within himself
[1:09:49] because in this account that we just
[1:09:52] have here, and I'm I'm going to probably
[1:09:55] labor for a little while, just getting
[1:09:57] your minds into the same channel that
[1:09:59] I've been pondering for a few weeks now.
[1:10:03] He he read a certain scripture. He read
[1:10:06] the scripture and he opened up the
[1:10:09] scroll of Isaiah and he the Bible says
[1:10:13] and when he had opened the book, you can
[1:10:15] just see him opening the book and then
[1:10:17] he's going through the scroll looking
[1:10:21] for the place because he was seeking the
[1:10:24] place that was matching what was in him.
[1:10:27] Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; He knew he knew that he was supposed to
[1:10:32] be there for that moment, but he was
[1:10:35] looking for a scripture that referred to
[1:10:38] him. And we have made the phrase in the
[1:10:41] past and we've heard it by other
[1:10:42] ministers, the word was looking in the
[1:10:45] word for the word for that very moment.
[1:10:49] So that because he needed to say this
[1:10:51] day is this scripture fulfilled. So he
[1:10:55] couldn't find any other place. He had to
[1:10:57] find that place. He was the He was the
[1:11:00] manifestation. He was the living
[1:11:03] manifestation of that word. The people
[1:11:05] were looking upon him. The Bible says
[1:11:08] that they they looked upon him and they
[1:11:11] marveled at the words that he was
[1:11:13] speaking. But now uh uh it was the Bible
[1:11:18] says that it was his custom. Uh he he
[1:11:21] came to Nazareth where he had been
[1:11:23] brought up. This wasn't his first time
[1:11:26] in the synagogue. Uh this Jesus Christ
[1:11:30] is still presently living because he he
[1:11:35] he it's eternal life. He's living in his
[1:11:38] people. And we say he's living in his
[1:11:40] bride. He's living in his body. You are
[1:11:43] his body.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; You've come to church before. You've
[1:11:47] come you as as you have been accustomed
[1:11:50] to. You've come here. The last time I
[1:11:53] spoke, I spoke on tradition and less
[1:11:56] they make a tradition of a prophet's
[1:11:58] life. He said they made a tradition of
[1:12:01] the people's life. And I want to by
[1:12:04] God's help to bring a very clear
[1:12:07] distinction even though it is a little
[1:12:10] bit difficult, but a clear distinction
[1:12:12] between tradition and custom. And I
[1:12:15] think it'll be startling for you as
[1:12:17] well. But his custom of going to the
[1:12:20] synagogue to read the word, he was that
[1:12:24] word in waiting. So I want to put that
[1:12:28] phrase in your mind. A word in waiting.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; The word was in him, but it was waiting
[1:12:35] for that moment.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Uh because and and we have some quotes
[1:12:39] of what is in you. The life of God is in
[1:12:42] you. Zoe is in you. And we can say all
[1:12:44] those things. But I believe that
[1:12:46] believers, believers of this message of
[1:12:49] all people in the world need to be
[1:12:53] introspective. We need to look very
[1:12:56] deeply within ourselves.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Uh contemplatively we need to look and
[1:13:02] contemplate and meditate. Why am I here?
[1:13:06] Why did God bring this message to me?
[1:13:11] Why has he revealed that this is the
[1:13:14] living Christ?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Why is this so set apart from everything
[1:13:19] else?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Why in fact is this a message that is
[1:13:22] hated?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Its standards are hated.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said that he was hated in the
[1:13:29] world and you will be.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; We never can garnish this up with
[1:13:34] tradition and make it acceptable.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; It's not an acceptable gospel with the
[1:13:39] world. And we cannot homogenize it with
[1:13:43] the with the thoughts of the world. It
[1:13:46] just will not mix.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we are here this morning and
[1:13:52] we've come to the house of worship as
[1:13:54] our custom is and I want to declare we
[1:13:58] are we have not gathered here as our
[1:14:01] tradition and I don't want to ever have
[1:14:04] it um made a tradition
[1:14:08] uh as his custom was
[1:14:12] in the uh in the Greek it's really quite
[1:14:15] simple and this may sound laborious just
[1:14:18] for a little bit. But please hang keep
[1:14:21] your thought conscience right there
[1:14:24] as as his custom was or as his manner
[1:14:28] was. This was the manner of life. Now
[1:14:31] you you that are young people, young
[1:14:34] families, you'd say, "Well, I know my my
[1:14:37] children or grandchildren or yours, we'd
[1:14:40] say, well, I am here." Now I'm speaking
[1:14:42] directly to some of you young people say
[1:14:45] I am here because this is where my
[1:14:47] parents brought me. This is this is what
[1:14:50] we do. I go to church Sunday morning.
[1:14:53] That's fine. Must go deeper than that.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Must mean something more than that.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus I'm I'm telling you now
[1:15:01] I'm making a complete comparison. Jesus
[1:15:04] went there when he was a young boy.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; He went there because he was accustomed
[1:15:10] to going there. That was his manner of
[1:15:13] going there. But he was not going to the
[1:15:16] synagogue simply to go to the synagogue.
[1:15:19] There was something within him that was
[1:15:22] causing him to attend to go because he
[1:15:26] knew from what was within him. And I
[1:15:29] need you to look within today. I need
[1:15:32] you to look why has God done these
[1:15:34] things. What is it that he placed? We've
[1:15:36] heard now. We've heard if I can just tie
[1:15:39] these things together. I just said a few
[1:15:41] moments ago that there never has been a
[1:15:43] message. You've heard that. Never has
[1:15:45] been a message like this. But then why
[1:15:47] would God take that message and that
[1:15:49] messenger and touch your life
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; if there wasn't another purpose to it?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; So we're not here simply because
[1:15:59] somebody brought us here or somebody
[1:16:01] introduced us. There's nothing special
[1:16:03] about the building or about the name or
[1:16:06] about anything else. What's special is
[1:16:09] Christ who is the word who touched your
[1:16:12] life and my life.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's what makes the difference. And
[1:16:18] we're not here because people come here
[1:16:20] or that we came here last Sunday or last
[1:16:23] year or for the last 20 or 30 years.
[1:16:26] That has nothing to do with it. We do it
[1:16:28] because as we look inwardly, we are
[1:16:31] absolutely thoroughly convinced that
[1:16:33] this is something beyond this world,
[1:16:36] this town, beyond this Pacific
[1:16:38] Northwest, beyond these nations. This is
[1:16:42] something that's eternal that came from
[1:16:44] heaven.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Came from God
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and came here to collect us,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; came here to call us,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; came here with a special calling. Amen.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; This is not just an educational call or
[1:16:59] a call to some kind of a a special
[1:17:02] profession and and we we find that uh
[1:17:05] that's why I made mention of the
[1:17:07] teachers and so on uh of the school.
[1:17:10] It's not just a school. Listen friends,
[1:17:13] when when as far as the natural is
[1:17:16] concerned, there are people who had
[1:17:19] particular talents or skills in their
[1:17:22] life as they grew up as young people.
[1:17:24] It takes someone who's I won't just say
[1:17:28] qualified, but it takes someone who is
[1:17:30] is very perceptive and they look at
[1:17:33] another person or they see a child, they
[1:17:36] see a young person and they they they
[1:17:39] can identify certain qualities. They
[1:17:43] identify certain skills that even the
[1:17:46] individual themselves don't know that
[1:17:48] they have. But those skills need to be
[1:17:51] identified. Those skills need to be
[1:17:54] cultivated.
[1:17:55] Those skills finally need to uh the
[1:17:59] person who possesses them has to finally
[1:18:01] realize I must give myself to this. This
[1:18:04] is going to require time. This is going
[1:18:07] to require years. And friends, listen,
[1:18:10] I'm not just talking to some humans now.
[1:18:12] I'm talking to some bornagain spiritual
[1:18:15] beings. and we will identify some human
[1:18:19] natural skills and give the next 10, 12,
[1:18:22] 15 years to it.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Look into yourself today and see what
[1:18:28] God deposited in you and what this
[1:18:31] gospel has cost and that we ought to
[1:18:34] look on every day.
[1:18:36] And that we ought to give ourselves that
[1:18:39] we ought to allow the great teacher the
[1:18:41] Holy Spirit to cultivate in us and shape
[1:18:44] us according to this word according to
[1:18:47] the message that he sent us.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; So as his custom was this is his this
[1:18:55] was his manner of life.
[1:18:59] Jesus
[1:19:02] was not just going up to the synagogue
[1:19:05] because he had been taught that way.
[1:19:08] This custom was in fact
[1:19:11] I like to use this term a life force in
[1:19:14] him. It was a life force within him. And
[1:19:18] that's why I'm calling it the law
[1:19:20] within.
[1:19:24] You have a law within you.
[1:19:28] and we're going to be speaking about it.
[1:19:32] There was another power
[1:19:34] that was directing him.
[1:19:38] A custom is not the same as a tradition.
[1:19:45] Why is this important?
[1:19:47] Why am I saying that this morning? Why
[1:19:49] is it important?
[1:19:52] Because they are very similar.
[1:19:55] and brother Brandham. Furthermore, I
[1:19:57] wouldn't I I wouldn't even have the
[1:19:59] time.
[1:20:01] And listen, friends,
[1:20:04] I'm not going to I'm not going to shy
[1:20:07] away from saying what he said,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; but he he literally blasted
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; the denominational system. And we may
[1:20:17] say, well, Methodist, Presbyterian,
[1:20:22] you know, denominations and Pentecost
[1:20:24] and whatever more. He says, every move
[1:20:26] of God denominated and died.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; And he literally spoke of traditions
[1:20:36] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:20:38] times.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:44] And a tradition is something that is
[1:20:45] handed down from one to the other. So
[1:20:48] it's almost like he went to the
[1:20:50] synagogue as his custom was. It's so
[1:20:54] very very similar and yet it is very
[1:20:58] different. A tradition is a long and I'm
[1:21:00] not speaking on tradition but a
[1:21:02] tradition is a long established action
[1:21:05] or pattern of behavior.
[1:21:08] I don't cut my hair or I dress this way.
[1:21:11] I live this way. We speak this way
[1:21:14] because we're believers. Well, is it is
[1:21:17] it just because we're believers? What is
[1:21:19] it that you believe?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Uh is it that you believe that this is
[1:21:24] this is what we're taught? This is what
[1:21:26] our parents have taught us. This is what
[1:21:28] the church this is what the message
[1:21:30] says. Well, it needs to go a little bit
[1:21:32] further than that. It needs to go and
[1:21:34] say, "This is what's inside."
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; This is a law from within. Amen.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I do this because I can't do anything
[1:21:42] other.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; We had just a few words yesterday just
[1:21:48] speaking together with Tom and Joanne
[1:21:50] drop by.
[1:21:52] Uh we were just sitting around. I've
[1:21:54] pondered this a whole lot. As I got
[1:21:55] older, I think about my youth
[1:21:58] and uh you know, Sister Biscll, this
[1:22:00] might surprise you, but Sister Biscll,
[1:22:02] she skated very, very well when she was
[1:22:04] uh in her teens.
[1:22:07] and uh she was going to fancy skate do
[1:22:11] fancy skating with a with another girl
[1:22:15] as a partner. Okay. And I've seen her
[1:22:19] skate. She was a excellent skater. So
[1:22:22] she's going to fancy skate. Now this is
[1:22:25] a Pentecostal pastor. Not a not a
[1:22:27] Pentecostal denomination. We didn't care
[1:22:29] about denomination.
[1:22:31] But a new pastor had come in
[1:22:34] and he just said to her, he said, "Do
[1:22:38] you think that that's what a Christian
[1:22:39] girl should do?"
[1:22:42] He said it like that. That was the end.
[1:22:44] You know what she did? She they they
[1:22:47] were they they were all practiced up for
[1:22:49] a carnival and she was going to skate as
[1:22:53] part of the program of the city
[1:22:55] carnival. She dropped right out.
[1:22:58] She left the girl high and dry.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Do you think it was that preacher?
[1:23:10] He didn't pound her.
[1:23:13] He didn't try and bring her under deep
[1:23:15] condemnation
[1:23:17] for, you know, you skating and you
[1:23:20] listening to the music and all of this
[1:23:22] and it's all part. He didn't give her a
[1:23:24] great big lesson. She didn't have to go
[1:23:28] to camp.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; I so appreciate Wednesday night, but I I
[1:23:36] I don't want you to get any conflict.
[1:23:38] She didn't even have to come to the
[1:23:39] altar.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; There was a law within.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; And all it took was that word. She
[1:23:51] didn't have a prophet.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Didn't have a messenger. didn't have the
[1:23:57] kind of ministry that you sit under.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Didn't have the word revealed to her.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; I want you, you can have all of these
[1:24:06] things. You can have all these messages
[1:24:08] and have all this preaching and have all
[1:24:10] of these things taking on and be moved
[1:24:12] and moved and moved, but you need to
[1:24:15] look not what's happening outside. You
[1:24:17] need to look inside.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm here to try to have you look
[1:24:22] within. Say, do I have that seed?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; If I have that seed, then you have the
[1:24:28] law of God in you.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that will keep you in
[1:24:33] all the storms of life and all the
[1:24:36] turmoil and all the testing and all the
[1:24:39] friends. My friends, friends, friends. I
[1:24:42] had friends.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Preach it.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I had good friends.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; In fact, as you talk about, oh, well,
[1:24:49] when you live, so hey, I lived when
[1:24:50] drugs were just being introduced.
[1:24:54] and good friends and they wanted to go
[1:24:56] that way. I had good friends that they
[1:24:58] they drank all the time, you know,
[1:25:01] they'd have have a beer, you know, it
[1:25:02] was just a social thing to do. Good
[1:25:04] friends. Somehow
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; I just couldn't relate to it.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the church that held me. It
[1:25:13] wasn't Christian friends that held me.
[1:25:15] It wasn't a tradition that held me. I'm
[1:25:17] here today to say there's a law within
[1:25:20] and you need to look into your soul and
[1:25:23] see that law that there's a law of God.
[1:25:27] It's a law of life. It's a law of
[1:25:30] eternal life. It's not being persuaded.
[1:25:33] It's not being moved by anything. It is
[1:25:36] a looking and saying, "I'm not a part of
[1:25:39] that. I don't even know why I'm not a
[1:25:42] part of it. I don't relate to it. It
[1:25:45] doesn't relate to me. I must be of
[1:25:47] another breed. And when Satan would come
[1:25:49] and say, "You're not a believer." I'd
[1:25:52] say, "So, uh, I don't know what I am
[1:25:54] then
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; because I know I'm not you.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I know I'm not that. I'm not part of the
[1:26:01] beer crowd. I'm not part of the sports
[1:26:04] crowd. I'm not part of the world crowd.
[1:26:06] I'm not part of the money crowd. I'm not
[1:26:09] part of all this success crowd. I'm not
[1:26:12] part of all this intelligencia. I'm not
[1:26:14] a part of anything else that I see out
[1:26:16] there. So, I'm really an oddball.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; There's a law within.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; And I want you to look deep to that law
[1:26:27] within. I want you to be introspective
[1:26:30] and and have a look and be perceptive of
[1:26:34] what you have inside.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Tell you what you determine.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:40] If anybody would have come around and
[1:26:42] said, "You're not the son of Fred
[1:26:44] Biscllow."
[1:26:46] I could have told them to your face,
[1:26:48] "You're a liar."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; And when Satan comes around says,
[1:26:53] "You're not a believer."
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You can say, "You're a liar.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I happen to have a law within
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; that's declaring that I am indeed a
[1:27:03] believer."
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:08] Amen.
[1:27:15] like you to notice
[1:27:17] how a denomination or a brand
[1:27:23] for a person to say as we said I want to
[1:27:26] give explanation to it just to say well
[1:27:28] I I'm an I'm a message I'm in the
[1:27:31] message or I'm a believer it has to go
[1:27:33] deeper than that
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; it has to it has to rise up from the
[1:27:38] fact that you say I have a law within me
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; yes sir
[1:27:43] I'm different because I have a law
[1:27:45] within me. I can't even explain that.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't go into the synagogue
[1:27:50] that day and say, "Well, now folks, this
[1:27:52] is a different meeting. This is a
[1:27:54] different kind of a meeting. I I have
[1:27:56] something within me and and and I'm
[1:27:59] going to identify this." No, he didn't
[1:28:01] he didn't pull any punches. He just read
[1:28:03] the scripture and all the eyes were
[1:28:05] fastened on him. He stopped. He started
[1:28:08] at the right place. He stopped at the
[1:28:10] right place and then declared this day
[1:28:13] is the scripture fulfilled.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends on the
[1:28:18] authority of the message that has come.
[1:28:20] This day the me the seals have been
[1:28:23] opened.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; This day God has deposited in a believer
[1:28:28] an incredible deposit. And we need to
[1:28:30] look into that deposit. This deposit is
[1:28:33] not some books on the shelf.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; This deposit is not a disc on an iPod.
[1:28:38] This deposit goes far beyond that.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That on the shelf or that on
[1:28:44] a disc or whatever more only came to
[1:28:46] identify something that you can relate
[1:28:48] to.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Say this has always been there and now
[1:28:52] I'm discovering what is there.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I happen to possess that.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Now this has come to identify it.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon spoke about
[1:29:08] He said maybe a fine Jewish man going
[1:29:12] down the road with his fatted bullock or
[1:29:16] a lamb under his arm on the day of the
[1:29:19] atonement and to offer it for his sin.
[1:29:22] And he was sincere when he killed that
[1:29:24] lamb.
[1:29:26] See, this was a custom.
[1:29:29] He did it before,
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; but he was sincere when he took his lamb
[1:29:34] and he killed the lamb and the priest
[1:29:36] stabbed it and he held his hands on it
[1:29:38] knowing that the life was taken to save
[1:29:41] his life.
[1:29:43] And he was sincere in it. And as long as
[1:29:47] he was sincere, it was all right. Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; But the time come
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; when it became a family tradition.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; So it was there's and there's the
[1:30:04] dividing line. It was a it as his custom
[1:30:08] was and he'd take his lamb and he was
[1:30:11] sincere and see the priest having to
[1:30:15] slay that lamb and stab it and see the
[1:30:17] blood and see the thing quiver and him
[1:30:19] holding his hand on the head according
[1:30:21] to the word and it never would leave
[1:30:24] him.
[1:30:25] But then finally, you know, as time went
[1:30:27] on, as long as he was sincere with it,
[1:30:31] we're coming to the Lord's table
[1:30:33] tonight. You've done it before. This is
[1:30:36] our custom. But we we are we are coming
[1:30:39] as his custom was, not as his tradition
[1:30:43] was. And we take that bread. Say this is
[1:30:46] the body of the Lord
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; broken for me.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm going to eat it.
[1:30:52] It's going to be assimilated into my
[1:30:54] body. I'm doing this as a testimony and
[1:30:57] a witness that even the broken bread of
[1:31:00] the Lord that has come in this
[1:31:02] generation, the world crucified it
[1:31:04] again,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; but I'm partaking of it.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm testifying by this that the life
[1:31:10] of this the life of this w life is in me
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; and the law of this life is in me. Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; A custom can be something that
[1:31:28] people always do
[1:31:30] or always do in a particular way and
[1:31:32] that's how we have are coming to this.
[1:31:37] But truth is more than just handing down
[1:31:41] doctrines or instruction for life.
[1:31:47] If the Holy Spirit of God does not
[1:31:51] confirm these words
[1:31:53] by a lifegiving force, then all the
[1:31:56] preaching is in vain.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; In birth pains said, if the Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] has made you a promise,
[1:32:04] the Holy Ghost has got to keep that
[1:32:06] promise. If it's really God,
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; if uh if a man comes through and says a
[1:32:15] certain thing and God does not back it
[1:32:17] up,
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; it isn't scripture to begin with,
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; forget it.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; So, you can have all, you know, we we
[1:32:27] can have all the uh right
[1:32:31] uh jargon, the right words, the right
[1:32:34] phrases. It's got to be more than the
[1:32:36] right phrases. Gotta be more than the
[1:32:38] right dress.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Gotta be more than the right
[1:32:41] association. Has to go beyond that.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I am not questioning at all
[1:32:49] that you even some of you that may have
[1:32:52] struggled
[1:32:54] and some of you that have been up and
[1:32:56] down and a lot of you that perhaps were
[1:32:58] praying here at the altar on Wednesday
[1:33:00] night. I don't deny for a moment that
[1:33:04] there aren't some needs or you've had
[1:33:06] questions or you've had something else
[1:33:09] and that you are identifying it. But I
[1:33:12] want you to identify something else this
[1:33:14] morning. I want you to look deep inside.
[1:33:20] I want you to come to a conclusion
[1:33:24] and Satan will not bring you to this
[1:33:26] conclusion. And the conclusion is
[1:33:31] I want you to ask yourself some
[1:33:32] questions. I want you to answer those
[1:33:34] questions.
[1:33:37] Why did I respond?
[1:33:40] What was it that I responded to and why
[1:33:43] did I respond when this message came by
[1:33:46] my way?
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Answer that.
[1:33:53] If you answered and said, "Well, it just
[1:33:54] sounded right and I was it was my
[1:33:56] friends and so on so forth." Then you
[1:33:59] got a ways to go.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; But if you say,
[1:34:07] "Well, I only did it because I was
[1:34:09] forced to do it or my parents made me do
[1:34:11] it or or my friends or relatives or
[1:34:14] whatever more," then you've got a
[1:34:16] distance to go.
[1:34:18] But if you can say
[1:34:22] something
[1:34:24] something actually happened,
[1:34:27] a light,
[1:34:29] something happened inside.
[1:34:31] Something was illuminated. I saw the
[1:34:34] scripture. I saw it. I saw myself.
[1:34:38] It was it was a reality. It was real to
[1:34:41] me. And it has been real to me. And I
[1:34:44] know even though all the obstacles and
[1:34:48] all the trouble and whatever more, we're
[1:34:50] not even not even worried about it.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; I just say forget it.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Forget all the problem. Forget all the
[1:34:58] exterior. I want you to look inside. Now
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; if we all look outside, have we all got
[1:35:04] a problem or do obstacle or something?
[1:35:07] We all do.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; You do. I do. The one sitting next to
[1:35:12] you does. We all have our certain batch
[1:35:14] of problems. We all have our baggage.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Stop looking outside and look inside for
[1:35:21] a while.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; While I was away, I thought of a lot of
[1:35:27] a lot of the families here, you know,
[1:35:30] families. And you've got grown children,
[1:35:33] you got grown young people, and maybe
[1:35:35] have it brought you disappointments. And
[1:35:37] if you just keep looking at the outside,
[1:35:39] some have financial problems, some have
[1:35:42] this who hasn't got problems. Everybody
[1:35:44] has problems. So if we continue to look
[1:35:47] at that, it will weaken us.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; But if you look inside,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; if you look within
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; and say, "This law of God,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; this seed that God put in me has a law
[1:36:00] in that life,
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; and that law will not stop speaking.
[1:36:06] That law will not stop drawing me.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That law will not stop confirming
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; who I am.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And we may say, you know, well, and I'm
[1:36:22] going to come to it in a few moments.
[1:36:24] Brother Bram talks about the law. He
[1:36:26] said the fish has a law
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; and that the fish was born that way.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; You had a law by the new birth.
[1:36:34] Hallelujah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, how many in this
[1:36:38] audience have been born again?
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; You are testifying. You are stating that
[1:36:49] I have a law because there's no life
[1:36:51] without some kind of law. Even a fish
[1:36:54] has a law. Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; And he says he doesn't have to say,
[1:36:57] "Well, now I'm just going to go up and
[1:36:59] get some oxygen and and and and and try
[1:37:01] to make this law work and go down to the
[1:37:03] bottom of the sea." No, he said he can
[1:37:05] go down there because it depresses
[1:37:07] himself and he can go down where you
[1:37:09] can't go and kill you, but the fish is
[1:37:12] just fine.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Just hold on because I have a couple of
[1:37:16] things to say about it. He says, "And
[1:37:18] then the bird, the bird has confidence
[1:37:22] in his wings.
[1:37:24] God gave him wings
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; and he has a law. He can manage the air.
[1:37:29] He can manage the currents.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; I watched the yesterday, I guess it was,
[1:37:34] we took a a short walk uh down at down a
[1:37:38] white rock and the wind was blowing
[1:37:40] incredible and the waves were high and
[1:37:43] it was hard to even walk into it. And
[1:37:46] then and and I I I look at a seagull
[1:37:48] right beside me and and he's he's he's
[1:37:50] actually flying without flapping his
[1:37:52] wings wings. He's flying into the wind.
[1:37:56] And I just looked at them. I marveled.
[1:37:59] And And then you just take a little wave
[1:38:01] like this, you know, and then make some
[1:38:03] more. And he could fly faster without
[1:38:05] flopping his wings. And I could walk
[1:38:07] into the wind. And he's going into the
[1:38:10] wind. And I'm going into the wind. I
[1:38:12] thought, "Wow, I wish I could catch his
[1:38:13] secret,
[1:38:15] but I'm just not that kind of a bird."
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; But you have a law. He has a law within
[1:38:23] him.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even trying. He wasn't
[1:38:25] educated. He not depending on a bunch of
[1:38:28] friends.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Not depending on a church.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; He not depending on a brand name. I'm a
[1:38:35] I'm a I'm a seagull
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; or I'm an eagle or whatever more. He
[1:38:41] just does it. He just does it because
[1:38:44] the law's in him
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and he gives himself and surrenders
[1:38:48] himself to that law and flies into the
[1:38:50] wind.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Flies right into the storm.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And I don't see any out there fretting
[1:38:58] and squawking and yelling. They do that
[1:39:01] mostly when they have some food around.
[1:39:03] But I don't see any squawking. Say, I
[1:39:05] just wish I just got to run faster. I've
[1:39:07] got to I've got to, you know, I I've got
[1:39:10] to fly faster. why I'm not getting down
[1:39:12] here. No, they just, you know, they just
[1:39:14] go with it.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to the people say,
[1:39:18] well, it's more vile. It's more wicked.
[1:39:21] And it may get the age you're living in
[1:39:23] may get far more wicked and things
[1:39:26] according to the scripture shall, and I
[1:39:29] want you to say, "Amen. They shall wax
[1:39:31] worse and worse.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; But you have a law within you
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; that can handle any storm."
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you need more than this
[1:39:42] message to tell you that you need to
[1:39:45] look inside yourself.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Say, well, I go through this kind of I'm
[1:39:51] going through an emotional upheaval.
[1:39:53] Well, don't look at the emotional
[1:39:54] upheaval. You need to look at what you
[1:39:56] got inside.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; You need to be able to say and say what
[1:40:01] the prophet said. He says things
[1:40:03] sometimes he couldn't quite understand,
[1:40:05] but he said it anyway.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; And then he found out it worked.
[1:40:10] You need to say, "I have a law within me
[1:40:13] that can handle this situation.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; I have a law within me that's going to
[1:40:19] carry me through this.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; I can't see daylight, but this law
[1:40:23] inside of me says it shall come to
[1:40:26] light."
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; The law within.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And that's why you're here in church.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; That's why it's your custom to come to
[1:40:37] church. This isn't your tradition to
[1:40:40] come to church. It's your custom to come
[1:40:42] to church. It's not a tradition that
[1:40:44] we'll have the Lord's table. It's our
[1:40:46] custom. But there's something within
[1:40:48] says I'm going to drive from Tacoma and
[1:40:51] be there because I am there. Yes, I've
[1:40:54] done it as a custom, but I'm there
[1:40:56] because there's a law inside there. And
[1:40:59] that law, I have a desire.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I have a desire. I have a hunger.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; I want to be with God's people.
[1:41:09] I want a fellowship.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; This is going to come now a little bit
[1:41:20] from left field.
[1:41:22] You have to jar and I've had I've had a
[1:41:26] good deal of my own
[1:41:29] complications with it because our
[1:41:32] terminology we get so tunnel vision
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; it's hard to break loose out of that
[1:41:38] tunnel vision of our terminology
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; as is custom was the word custom and
[1:41:44] Jesus incidentally this is just in Luke
[1:41:46] the 4th chapter
[1:41:48] Jesus understood very clearly
[1:41:51] from the Old Testament what a custom
[1:41:53] was. Now, I'll just get you to think a
[1:41:57] wee bit.
[1:41:59] Many of you came across the border today
[1:42:02] and you have the immigration down there
[1:42:04] and you have customs.
[1:42:06] The custom,
[1:42:09] the custom
[1:42:11] actually is in the judicial sense.
[1:42:15] It was his custom.
[1:42:18] Judicial.
[1:42:20] Judicial is law.
[1:42:24] He went to the synagogue as was his
[1:42:28] custom. There was a law in him
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; causing him to keep that appointment.
[1:42:40] And there isn't anybody who crosses the
[1:42:41] border but what you have to deal with
[1:42:44] the customs
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; and they want to ask right away did you
[1:42:48] buy anything.
[1:42:51] Do you have anything that requires a
[1:42:54] payment
[1:42:56] a custom that just to incline your
[1:42:59] thoughts that way we want to take it
[1:43:01] further and I hope I don't lose you
[1:43:06] custom.
[1:43:08] There's several terms of it, but it is
[1:43:12] a judgment or justice.
[1:43:16] It's an act of deciding a case. Now, for
[1:43:20] those of you stay with me or listening
[1:43:21] real nice, just hold on close. It's an
[1:43:26] act of deciding a case. It's a place,
[1:43:30] a court, or a seat of judgment.
[1:43:34] And it comes from a second word and
[1:43:36] we're in the Hebrew to judge or to
[1:43:38] govern or to vindicate,
[1:43:42] to prove
[1:43:44] or to act as a lawgiver.
[1:43:47] Brother Brandham called Jesus a
[1:43:50] lawgiver.
[1:43:53] Now he comes into the synagogue
[1:43:57] as his custom.
[1:44:00] He must go there.
[1:44:03] There's a law within him.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; And this law within him now is going to
[1:44:09] say some incredible things that have
[1:44:11] never been said in the synagogue before.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the custom now is due. It's
[1:44:18] time
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; for this to be spoken.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; If you come to the border, I don't want
[1:44:27] to dwell on that too much, but you come
[1:44:29] to the border that you've arrived.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; The moment is then,
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; you may have bought something, you know,
[1:44:36] long before, but now is the time
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; when things have to be coped with.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And so now he comes to he comes to the
[1:44:46] uh uh here he comes the lawgiver himself
[1:44:51] coming to a moment. He he is a he is a a
[1:44:55] judge and a governor and and now there's
[1:44:58] a statute and an ordin ordinance.
[1:45:02] In fact is the Hebrew word comes also
[1:45:05] from a third a third foundation word and
[1:45:10] this one is absolutely fulfilled. It
[1:45:13] says that it is an ordinance
[1:45:16] prescribed task. It's a pre. And when we
[1:45:21] say prescribed, you think of
[1:45:22] prescription or something that's
[1:45:24] prescribed. Something that's prescribed
[1:45:27] has been pre-written.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; And now he comes to the synagogue as his
[1:45:36] custom was. He's the lawgiver. And now
[1:45:40] he's going to look through something
[1:45:42] that was prescribed.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And he finds the prescription.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; And he's the answer to the prescription.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; So he comes now as his custom was
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; and he because this is a judicial thing.
[1:46:04] This isn't to make people feel good.
[1:46:06] This isn't even to make them happy. This
[1:46:09] isn't even to make them healed. This is
[1:46:11] to make an announcement. I am here
[1:46:14] because something was prescribed of this
[1:46:17] event.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And I've looked into where it was
[1:46:21] written and I have found the place and
[1:46:23] now I will read the prescription.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; All of you have been uh to a doctor
[1:46:29] perhaps you got a prescription and then
[1:46:31] you'll go to somebody you perhaps can't
[1:46:34] even understand what was written. It's a
[1:46:36] mystery to you. But you get in front of
[1:46:39] someone who understands it, a
[1:46:41] pharmacist, and they will read the
[1:46:43] prescription. They will read that
[1:46:44] chicken scratch, and it means something
[1:46:46] to them, and they will hand you some
[1:46:49] medication, and you take the medication,
[1:46:51] and wa wa, you feel better
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; or worse,
[1:46:56] whichever is the case. But he opened up
[1:46:59] the scripture and he found the place and
[1:47:02] he began to read the prescription. The
[1:47:05] spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; because he has anointed me to heal the
[1:47:11] sick
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; to cast out the devils
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; and to bring deliverance to them that
[1:47:18] are in prison.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; The prescription
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; prescribed
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; and now he of whom it was written is
[1:47:28] standing there making the announcement.
[1:47:31] My brother, my sister, that's what this
[1:47:33] message is.
[1:47:35] This message isn't something we just
[1:47:37] come and keep and we dress a certain way
[1:47:40] or we speak a certain way or we worship
[1:47:43] a certain way. The message is the life
[1:47:46] of God in his word that causes us. And
[1:47:50] so we look in the word and we find it
[1:47:52] was prescribed.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; It was written in Malachi,
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; "Behold,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; I send my messenger. Behold, I send you
[1:48:04] Elijah before the great and terrible day
[1:48:07] of the Lord prescribed.
[1:48:10] But we can say this day, that scripture
[1:48:14] has been fulfilled.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; This day stands evidence that that word
[1:48:20] has been fulfilled.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; This word,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; this day,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; this is a testimony. This people have
[1:48:29] heard that word by that Elijah. And we
[1:48:33] stand here and are seated here and
[1:48:36] worship here as evidence that that has
[1:48:39] been fulfilled.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; And furthermore that we are here with
[1:48:47] the same law of the same God who
[1:48:50] prescribed it. I am here now in as the
[1:48:54] fulfillment of that word.
[1:49:00] Are you getting it?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; This is our custom.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said in another place 49:16,
[1:49:19] God speaking, "Behold,
[1:49:22] I have graven thee.
[1:49:25] I've inscribed thee upon the palms of my
[1:49:29] hands, and thy walls are continually
[1:49:32] before me. I'll tell you what, friends.
[1:49:39] Go back with me for a moment.
[1:49:42] Jesus,
[1:49:44] the word in him. Who would dare even say
[1:49:48] for a moment, the word wasn't in him? He
[1:49:49] was the word.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:54] And the living word is walking in flesh
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; very very unceremoniously
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; without displaying any great human
[1:50:06] skills or abilities or talents.
[1:50:10] He hadn't had some great meetings yet.
[1:50:13] But he calls and he sees some very lowly
[1:50:15] people just fishermen
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; just bluecollar workers and less
[1:50:22] That's right.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; And fastened his eyes on one said,
[1:50:26] "Follow me."
[1:50:30] I want to declare to you today with
[1:50:33] every ounce of strength that's in my
[1:50:35] body,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; every ounce to believe the word of God.
[1:50:39] It was the law
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; of God in them
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; that caused them to drop their net,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; leave their father,
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; leave their livelihood. Where are you
[1:50:51] going? I don't know where I'm going.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in the future?
[1:50:55] I have no idea what I'm going to do in
[1:50:57] the future.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Why are you going to achieve something I
[1:50:59] don't know and I'm not interested.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; How am I going to live? I don't know.
[1:51:04] But I know one thing. There's a law in
[1:51:06] me that says I must follow this.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Young and old, I'm saying to you today,
[1:51:17] I don't know how the word came to you. I
[1:51:19] don't know how the call came to you, but
[1:51:21] something happened inside. And if that's
[1:51:24] what happened inside, I must follow
[1:51:26] this.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Then I say to you, thus sayith the Lord,
[1:51:30] you have a law inside of you. And that
[1:51:33] law has a life.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; That law will keep you whether you're a
[1:51:44] few or whether you're many. And but
[1:51:47] Jesus had identified in these men. He
[1:51:51] identified certain things and as time
[1:51:53] went on and they went through terrible
[1:51:55] terrible times. I would quite frankly I
[1:51:59] would like to be Peter on the day of
[1:52:00] Pentecost but I wouldn't want to to be
[1:52:02] him just 60 days two months earlier just
[1:52:04] two months before
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; when he cursed. I don't know what he
[1:52:08] cursed.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Said I don't know this man. I'm not part
[1:52:12] of this group.
[1:52:14] Even while they, you know, the world is
[1:52:16] very cunning. Said, "Yeah, but your
[1:52:18] language, you're saying things."
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It makes you sound like a believer.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You sound like those people. He denied
[1:52:27] him.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; I don't know him.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Even then, he had that law in him.
[1:52:36] That's right.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Even then,
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; even in that failure,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; he had that law in him.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; I don't care about your failures. I'm
[1:52:50] interested in you looking inside. And
[1:52:52] you need to say, I have that law in me.
[1:52:57] And that law is greater than any dismal
[1:52:59] failure. That law is greater than any
[1:53:02] circumstance. That law is greater than
[1:53:04] my backsliden children. That law is
[1:53:06] greater than any sickness.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; That law is greater. I have that law
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; inside.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; You may not be in it just yet. Some of
[1:53:26] you perhaps are. You've come through
[1:53:30] very, very heavy waters.
[1:53:33] But all
[1:53:35] listen beloved friends
[1:53:40] there's a place
[1:53:43] just across the veil.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you 5 seconds, 4 seconds, 3
[1:53:55] seconds, one sec. One second.
[1:53:59] On the other side,
[1:54:03] you're going to do one or two things.
[1:54:06] Listen to me, young man.
[1:54:09] I'm talking to you.
[1:54:11] One second. One, it's gone. You're going
[1:54:15] to either rejoice
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; in such bliss.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; There's one thing we all have in common.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; There's not a person here. But what's
[1:54:25] going to go beyond that veil?
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; We're going to pass beyond the curtain
[1:54:29] of time.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And there's only two places to go.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; As brother Tom preached on Wednesday
[1:54:34] night, there's only two places to go.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; There's no in between. There's heaven
[1:54:38] and there's hell.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And it speaks of it spoke of the place
[1:54:43] Jesus spoke about it a lot. He spoke
[1:54:45] about it more than he did about heaven
[1:54:47] where there's weeping and wailing and
[1:54:50] nashing of teeth. And I don't need to
[1:54:52] interpret that. All I have, the law in
[1:54:55] me says I don't want to go there.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; The law in me says I wasn't even made
[1:54:59] for that.
[1:55:00] [Applause]
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; There isn't anybody that arrives at a
[1:55:12] place as though they feel like, you
[1:55:14] know, I'm okay. I don't need any
[1:55:16] cleansing. I don't need any forgiveness.
[1:55:18] I don't need any mercy. I don't. We all
[1:55:21] do. That's one of the first things.
[1:55:23] That's why I came to that part before
[1:55:25] the service this morning because I came
[1:55:28] in prayer and I just say, "I'm so glad,
[1:55:31] Father,
[1:55:34] that I have a place,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; we're cleansing.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; There isn't anything in the world,
[1:55:41] there's no physician, there's no
[1:55:42] specialist, there's no smart person,
[1:55:45] there's nobody that can provide this
[1:55:48] kind of cleansing that we need. There's
[1:55:50] no one that knows how to take this piece
[1:55:52] of clay and mold it.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; You're the only one that has the hands.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; And I want to surrender myself. I want
[1:55:58] to I want to put myself I want to just
[1:56:00] place myself on the potter's wheel
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; and mold it whatever you want it to be.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, I don't even know, you know,
[1:56:09] just
[1:56:12] what all to say on this subject. There's
[1:56:15] so much is not just out there, but so
[1:56:17] much in my heart to be said.
[1:56:37] I'll be a few more minutes if that's all
[1:56:39] right.
[1:56:49] Brother Benham said there's a law that's
[1:56:51] given
[1:56:53] amongst everything.
[1:56:55] Amongst everything
[1:56:57] there's a law.
[1:57:00] The bird has a law and the fish has a
[1:57:02] law.
[1:57:05] I'm taking this very slowly. There was a
[1:57:08] law in Christ.
[1:57:10] I don't believe that. I don't believe
[1:57:12] there's a person here. There isn't a
[1:57:14] person here that'll be foolish enough to
[1:57:16] deny that there was a law that was in
[1:57:18] Christ.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; This is not another phrase.
[1:57:24] It's a part of that same phrase. And he
[1:57:26] said that laws in man.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; There was a law in Christ and that laws
[1:57:34] in man.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:40] that law. God has a law and his word is
[1:57:43] the law.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; This is all out of the restoration of
[1:57:48] the bride tree.
[1:57:50] And he goes and he says, "If Satan has
[1:57:52] robbed you, Satan has robbed I think all
[1:57:55] of us at some point in time." And you
[1:57:58] may be in that situation right now. We
[1:58:01] say, "I've had a robbery. I had a
[1:58:03] breakin."
[1:58:05] He said, ' If Satan has robbed you of
[1:58:07] the privilege of being a son or daughter
[1:58:09] of God,
[1:58:11] and there were a lot that were praying
[1:58:12] here Wednesday night, I don't know your
[1:58:14] heart, but I'm speaking to this
[1:58:16] congregation today and many that perhaps
[1:58:19] are not even here. And if you're seated
[1:58:22] here and go and Satan has actually
[1:58:24] robbed you
[1:58:26] of being a son or daughter of God,
[1:58:31] now I take his words and imply it and
[1:58:33] say it directly to you. You have a
[1:58:36] right. Now you can you can disregard the
[1:58:38] right if you want to and then suffer the
[1:58:41] consequences,
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; but you have a right.
[1:58:44] You have a right this morning, he said
[1:58:48] by the Holy Spirit
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; to enforce the claim of God. You can't
[1:58:53] enforce the claim unless there is a
[1:58:55] claim. You can't enforce something that
[1:58:57] is not a it's because this this custom
[1:59:00] that you've come here. You didn't just
[1:59:02] come to church,
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; You didn't come and just sing some
[1:59:07] songs.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; That's not what this is all about.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; This is a legal process. Yes sir.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; This is a custom in the legal sense.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I am here to determine if there's
[1:59:21] something that is that should I should
[1:59:24] obtain that I have not obtained. I need
[1:59:27] to know if there is something that is
[1:59:29] rightfully mine.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Hello friends.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Is there something that's rightfully
[1:59:35] mine and I'm living below that standard?
[1:59:38] Then the prophet of God has said you
[1:59:41] have a right.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] And if that's the word of God, then
[1:59:46] there's a law behind it.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; And you can enforce that law.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; And you that are afflicted physically
[1:59:54] and not so much physically, but you that
[1:59:57] are afflicted physically, I want to nail
[2:00:00] this down. I want you to say to
[2:00:02] yourself, as the prophet would say, I
[2:00:05] have a right.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; I have a right to be delivered and
[2:00:10] healed from this affliction.
[2:00:15] Amen.
[2:00:23] Someone might be out of harmony, out of
[2:00:25] fellowship with God and living below the
[2:00:28] standard say I I don't have this
[2:00:33] and the what is the reason then if I
[2:00:36] said what was the reason and asked you
[2:00:37] in the study what was the reason you
[2:00:40] perhaps could give me a whole series of
[2:00:42] things that are on the exterior
[2:00:45] It would ball be on the exterior on
[2:00:48] outside.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; You say well because of this and this
[2:00:51] happened
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; and that was said
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; and and this took place and now I I
[2:00:57] developed and came into this set of
[2:00:58] circumstances and it has taken me down.
[2:01:02] Of course it has taken you down. It will
[2:01:04] take us all down. It takes me down.
[2:01:08] If I can only think of things that are
[2:01:10] on the outside, think of things that
[2:01:12] have happened or things that are
[2:01:14] happening or whatever. My friends,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; it's not simple. It's not perhaps the
[2:01:19] easiest thing, but you need to look
[2:01:21] inside.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Say, how do I do that? Contemplate it.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; Ponder it.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Go and sit in your chair. sit by
[2:01:33] yourself
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; and ponder
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; what was in the purpose and the mind of
[2:01:38] God.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at some of you that have
[2:01:41] been birthed into a into a into a
[2:01:43] believing house in a believing home. And
[2:01:47] you may be thinking about, you know, uh
[2:01:51] well, this was okay for my father, my
[2:01:55] mother. This was okay for my parents.
[2:01:58] This was okay for other people in the
[2:02:00] church.
[2:02:02] And then
[2:02:04] well then get reduce it down to the
[2:02:07] bottom line.
[2:02:10] And if you're cold and indifferent
[2:02:12] today, I want you to reduce it down to
[2:02:14] the bottom line. Am I a Judas?
[2:02:19] Now we're really getting squeaky tight.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Am I a Judas?
[2:02:26] Am I a betrayer?
[2:02:30] Am I an abselum?
[2:02:35] Am I a son of predition?
[2:02:40] Look inside.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; In the heart of hearts.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Am I destined for separation from God?
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Am I destined for hell?
[2:02:56] Is the rich man going to be my partner?
[2:03:01] Am I going to look up say Abraham
[2:03:04] Abraham or somebody
[2:03:08] come and cool?
[2:03:10] Dip your finger and cool. I'm in I'm in
[2:03:13] this torment. He said
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; now either Jesus is a liar or you're a
[2:03:18] liar. That's right.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; I hate to say that
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus was truth. And there is such a
[2:03:25] place.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; And there are people that will go there.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; But did you come to this service today
[2:03:32] as a tradition to end up there? I say
[2:03:35] no.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Because why you say why can you have
[2:03:39] such confidence, brother Biscll? I know
[2:03:41] that God didn't call me here to preach
[2:03:44] to a bunch of serpent seed. I know that
[2:03:47] you're sons and daughters of God. And it
[2:03:50] is my duty to say the reason you're here
[2:03:52] is because there's a law inside of you.
[2:03:55] And that law is the law of God. That law
[2:03:58] is the law of life.
[2:04:00] [Applause]
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; And people need to identify that.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; There are many people, you know, it
[2:04:11] happens all the time.
[2:04:15] Michael, he's not here. Probably
[2:04:17] upstairs.
[2:04:19] Michael Ray,
[2:04:22] you know, he has taken studies and tried
[2:04:25] to advance himself in in the medical
[2:04:27] field. He loved the medical field. He
[2:04:29] just wanted to be a doctor and he was he
[2:04:31] wanted to follow the medical profession
[2:04:35] and he's taken many many many courses
[2:04:37] and has uh has gained some quite some
[2:04:42] knowledge and could have a job in that
[2:04:44] field but he feels
[2:04:46] a call to be here. One of the one of the
[2:04:51] classes of the courses he was taken
[2:04:54] required that he have 12 weeks of
[2:04:57] practicum which happened to take place
[2:04:59] and the place he had to take it was at
[2:05:01] the Edmonton
[2:05:03] uh Edmonton is it Edmonton Jubilee or
[2:05:06] Edmonton
[2:05:07] it was the main hospital up in Edmonton
[2:05:10] and so he's doing because he's becoming
[2:05:13] you know taking nursing and everything
[2:05:15] and so on and they the people who are in
[2:05:18] charge heart said,
[2:05:21] "Michael, you're wasting your time.
[2:05:25] You're a doctor.
[2:05:27] You're a doctor. You're wasting your
[2:05:29] time doing this. You're a doctor." So,
[2:05:31] they were identifying certain skills and
[2:05:34] talents and so on and so forth. But that
[2:05:38] just he didn't feel led to do that
[2:05:41] whether it's not now or whatever.
[2:05:45] Brother Brham is not here.
[2:05:49] Uh, excuse me. But I I said to brother
[2:05:52] Brandham when we were together, just the
[2:05:55] two of us, I said, "Brother Brandom, if
[2:05:57] you ever see anything in my life,
[2:06:01] you know, if you ever see anything in my
[2:06:03] life that I was thinking in terms of
[2:06:06] something that would hinder me,
[2:06:08] something that was wrong, some weakness,
[2:06:11] I said, you know, I I sure would want
[2:06:14] you to tell me." And he and he just
[2:06:16] said, "Yeah, oh, Brother Eddie, I I
[2:06:19] certainly would. You know, he hasn't
[2:06:20] shown me anything, but if he did, I sure
[2:06:23] would tell you." And I guess kind of
[2:06:25] waited, you know, maybe for that time
[2:06:27] and something might come up and uh it it
[2:06:31] didn't happen that way.
[2:06:34] But you know the greatest honor that
[2:06:36] brother Brandham could
[2:06:40] give to me personally and give to you
[2:06:42] personally the same thing cuz one is he
[2:06:46] never said anything special to me along
[2:06:48] that line. But the greatest one is that
[2:06:51] something that God would speak out of
[2:06:53] his mouth
[2:06:55] and would do the same thing for you that
[2:06:57] it does for me and for this person here
[2:06:59] and that person there. Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; And that the Lord Jesus could say out of
[2:07:07] that message what say put it I'll put it
[2:07:09] in my words. He's saying come
[2:07:14] follow me
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; and I will make you fishers of men. He
[2:07:21] will make you what he wants you to be.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; How will he do it?
[2:07:29] The law is in you.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; It's a law within you, friends.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; That would be another another moment.
[2:07:44] I'm laying a lot of this aside because
[2:07:54] I've been a great deal in the message
[2:07:56] the unveiling of God and I would
[2:08:00] recommend to this congregation if you
[2:08:02] take and perhaps read the unveiling of
[2:08:04] God again after this service. But in the
[2:08:08] unveiling of God,
[2:08:10] he begins to refer to who is this great
[2:08:15] person. Now, I'm not digressing from
[2:08:19] what I've said just now. Just hold it
[2:08:21] for a moment,
[2:08:25] but I would like to I would like to
[2:08:26] bring this to you by the help of God.
[2:08:30] We've talked about the law, the law of
[2:08:33] God, the law of life, and so on so
[2:08:35] forth. But can I take you a step
[2:08:38] further?
[2:08:41] Who I'm really talking about as a
[2:08:43] person?
[2:08:45] When we get to speak about law and
[2:08:46] judicial things, it it becomes kind of,
[2:08:49] you know, kind of something that's out
[2:08:51] there. But now I want to say that this
[2:08:55] is a person.
[2:08:57] And brother Brandham is talking about
[2:08:58] Abraham and he says
[2:09:02] he's speaking like on Abraham's behalf.
[2:09:05] He said, "Who is this great person?
[2:09:10] Who is this great unseen person?
[2:09:15] Who is this
[2:09:17] that Abraham seen? He seen visions." In
[2:09:19] other words, he had experiences.
[2:09:22] And right at the last, though he was
[2:09:24] manifested in flesh, before the son of
[2:09:26] God came, God himself came to Abraham in
[2:09:29] the form of a man at the end time
[2:09:33] manifested. He saw him in a little light
[2:09:36] one time. He saw him in visions. He
[2:09:39] heard his voice. Many revelations, but
[2:09:42] just before the promised son, he saw him
[2:09:45] in the form of a man and talk to him and
[2:09:49] and fed him meat and drank. And notice
[2:09:52] God himself veiled in human flesh.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Children, saints of God,
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; this is where we have come to. where
[2:10:02] you've come to a time and I could take
[2:10:05] you for the rest of the day and I won't
[2:10:08] I won't won't even tire you with it. But
[2:10:10] if this message has produced anything,
[2:10:13] if this message has declared anything,
[2:10:15] it has declared through this same mouth
[2:10:18] that not only God in flesh come to
[2:10:20] Abraham, God in flesh has come to his
[2:10:23] Abraham's children.
[2:10:26] And one of the greatest revelations that
[2:10:28] you could have
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; is that the law of God which I've been
[2:10:31] speaking of now I want to convert it and
[2:10:34] say the person
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; this person
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; who has spoken
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; this person who called me this person is
[2:10:45] visible in the flesh of his body
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; called abide the body of Jesus Christ
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; and this world This world is our enemy.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; This world is doing everything
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; to obscure that person.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; And we see exterior. We see the
[2:11:04] weaknesses of one another. But he sees
[2:11:08] us as perfect.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; We see failures, everything on the
[2:11:14] exterior. We see all these kind of
[2:11:17] things. But he's not looking at that.
[2:11:20] And we are to see the person.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; Who is this person?
[2:11:25] Who is this great unseen person?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, the congregation of
[2:11:31] people that ever arrive at the place
[2:11:34] that look at one another and see Jesus
[2:11:36] Christ in the flesh,
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; that congregation, there will be nothing
[2:11:42] that will be able to stand before them
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; because they do not see the failures.
[2:11:50] They do not see the silical up and down.
[2:11:53] They do not see the weaknesses. They see
[2:11:55] the man Jesus Christ.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Don't forget friends, there were those
[2:12:02] when Jesus Christ, the perfect son of
[2:12:04] God, stood here on earth. He had enough
[2:12:06] weaknesses that some would call him
[2:12:08] beub.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; The prince of the devils.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; He had all kinds of failures and
[2:12:15] failings as far as the people were
[2:12:17] concerned.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; We cannot compare. We cannot have the
[2:12:21] world's standard.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; They don't know what we're talking
[2:12:28] about.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, friends?
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Who is this person?
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; We've come to the house of God, as is
[2:12:42] our custom.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Who is this person?
[2:12:51] There's an old song.
[2:12:53] Who is this that's troubling me?
[2:12:57] Who is it that's calling?
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Who is it that troubling my sleep at
[2:13:02] night?
[2:13:04] Who is this great person?
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; They wrote that song before
[2:13:10] and they didn't know what this message
[2:13:12] is. But who is this?
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; We say we come into the house of God. We
[2:13:16] come in as is our custom.
[2:13:20] We came in Wednesday night. We've come
[2:13:22] in the previous services. Came in
[2:13:24] Wednesday night. I didn't know. You
[2:13:27] didn't know. Brother Tom perhaps didn't
[2:13:29] know. Brother John didn't know
[2:13:31] just how God was going to call. Who is
[2:13:34] this person?
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; And my prophet said, "Talk about him
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; and he'll come close. Amen.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Draw near, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Draw near, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Who is this great person?
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Who is this mech?
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; You might be saying, I need a priest.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; You have one.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this is so far beyond
[2:14:11] church. Yes,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; we've come here this morning as is our
[2:14:15] custom.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; But as far as God is concerned, that
[2:14:19] custom is the judicial thing whereby the
[2:14:21] lawgiver,
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; he who gave the law and imparts and
[2:14:26] allotss to each one their rightful
[2:14:27] place. He's the one you you'll you'll
[2:14:31] sit perhaps in your seat and uh and the
[2:14:33] deacons will come by and you'll take the
[2:14:35] bread and the wine off of the table. But
[2:14:38] I want you to be aware in that man, in
[2:14:43] that person in that office and in this
[2:14:45] congregation and in the song leader and
[2:14:48] in the person sitting next to you,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; in the person next to you, he's either
[2:14:53] one that might be in still in need, but
[2:14:55] I would say for the most part in that
[2:14:57] person next to you is this one,
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; in flesh. Yeah, weakness is because of
[2:15:05] the flesh, but because of the call of
[2:15:07] God and because of the because of the
[2:15:10] law of life that's in the individual.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; I spoke this whole service this morning
[2:15:19] and I had much more to say, but I'm
[2:15:21] quitting now.
[2:15:24] in a desire in a deep deep desire that
[2:15:28] God
[2:15:30] don't let the people just walk out the
[2:15:32] same again
[2:15:34] but let them walk out
[2:15:37] with these phrases upon them the law
[2:15:41] within. I want them I want you to look
[2:15:43] into into your own soul. I want you to
[2:15:46] get quiet. I want you to ponder. I want
[2:15:49] you to meditate. It would do you good.
[2:15:52] And then take the message, the unveiling
[2:15:54] of God.
[2:15:56] And in there you'll find that he will
[2:15:58] say, he will say, "This is Elijah saying
[2:16:02] to you, and he's veiled again now in
[2:16:06] you."
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Who is he? He's this great mysterious
[2:16:12] one. Who is he that stood on the
[2:16:15] platform? Who is he who revealed the
[2:16:18] secrets of the hearts of the people? Who
[2:16:21] is he that took your life and called you
[2:16:24] and brought you to this day? It is the
[2:16:27] same unveiled God.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; There was a woman
[2:16:42] and uh
[2:16:47] Brother Brandham was speaking to her
[2:16:50] and he had a vision
[2:16:53] and she said that she believed in her
[2:16:57] confidence.
[2:16:59] She anchored her faith in that vision
[2:17:01] because she knew the vision
[2:17:04] had to come from another place.
[2:17:08] Friends, I just close with this. I have
[2:17:11] a a wonderful wonderful place where
[2:17:13] brother Brandham it's an early early
[2:17:16] message where he he was trying to convey
[2:17:18] to the people
[2:17:21] what the vision was and he literally
[2:17:25] said that there are times he said and he
[2:17:28] was explaining there's someone here
[2:17:30] maybe has a dream
[2:17:32] someone here doesn't dream so he says
[2:17:36] here's one that doesn't dream because
[2:17:37] his conscious and subconscious too far
[2:17:40] away. And then someone dreams and
[2:17:43] they're they come close together.
[2:17:46] And so they have dreams. And then he
[2:17:48] says for a prophet both the conscious
[2:17:50] and the subconscious come right
[2:17:52] together.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't dream to have that's
[2:17:56] where he has a vision.
[2:17:58] And now he said
[2:18:01] he said and when you wake up in the
[2:18:04] morning
[2:18:06] you've had a dream.
[2:18:09] Now, perhaps many even dreamed last
[2:18:10] night. Now, now I want to get right down
[2:18:13] where you live. What if you got up in
[2:18:15] the morning and said, "I just had a
[2:18:18] dream last night." And the rest of the
[2:18:19] family says, "Nah, you didn't have a
[2:18:22] dream."
[2:18:24] He said, "What are you talking about?
[2:18:26] Why are you questioning me?" Nah, you
[2:18:29] didn't have a dream. You just We don't
[2:18:30] know what happened, but you didn't have
[2:18:32] a dream. You could say, "I was there. I
[2:18:35] had the dream. I can tell you all the
[2:18:37] colors. I can tell you all the places. I
[2:18:40] can tell you every detail in detail. I
[2:18:43] had the dream. Why? Because you
[2:18:46] personally experienced it.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And somebody somebody say, "Well, now I
[2:18:52] don't think there's anything to this
[2:18:53] message and da da da and whatever more."
[2:18:55] Just say, "Just a second, friends. This
[2:18:57] isn't even a dream. This is a reality. I
[2:19:00] had this experience.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; I've been there.
[2:19:06] Amen.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; John, I'm going to have you come up here
[2:19:12] for a second.
[2:19:21] You can probably even take your coat
[2:19:22] off. It's warm up here.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; How are you, Brother John?
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. That's good news. How old are
[2:19:34] you?
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; 22. 22 years old. Are you married?
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Pretty sure.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Very sure. You're not a father then?
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; You're not a grandfather.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; What if I told you? You're not going to
[2:19:53] change a bit and you'll be a
[2:19:55] grandfather.
[2:19:57] I would too. I dropped my chain.
[2:20:04] Brother Brandham said now he said I was
[2:20:07] once a young man.
[2:20:10] Said now I'm a grandfather.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; But he said I'm still me.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; He said you might be here and you're not
[2:20:18] a grandfather. You're not a father.
[2:20:20] You're not married. said, "Just wait a
[2:20:23] few years and all of that will change."
[2:20:28] And you'll still be and I'll still put
[2:20:29] my hand if I'm still here and I'll say,
[2:20:30] "Hi, John. How are you?" You say, "Well,
[2:20:32] I'm not as good as I was when I shook
[2:20:34] your hand on the pulpit."
[2:20:39] Or you'll be the same person.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; John's John was here and he was here in
[2:20:43] the church 15.
[2:20:46] Now he's a father,
[2:20:48] husband.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; My goodness. children growing up, but
[2:20:54] we're still here.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's the same. And brother Bren was
[2:20:57] talking about the God, the mighty God
[2:20:59] unveiled.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Just the same person.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; He's the same person that he was in the
[2:21:06] Old Testament.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; He's the same person that he was in
[2:21:10] Jesus.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; That same person dwelt in William Brham.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; That same person is here today. Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; We're a few years down the road.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; And we've perhaps changed a wee bit the
[2:21:25] outward. So, we're not looking on the
[2:21:28] outward, the physical side. We're
[2:21:29] looking really what is inside.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; And you will still be you.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Come and see me when you're married and
[2:21:37] after you get your children
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; and say, "Hi, Brother Ed. I'm now a
[2:21:40] father."
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good. Isn't that so?
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Said I'm still me.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; You'll go home and take this word and
[2:22:03] listen to it.
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[2:22:14] Sorry to cap you a little bit longer
[2:22:16] than usual, but the service this
[2:22:18] afternoon is at 4, so you'll just have
[2:22:20] time to get home and have
[2:22:23] a little time of refreshment. And
[2:22:25] remember this next week, our brother
[2:22:27] Benny Perry. I talked to him yesterday
[2:22:29] and he's very very uh
[2:22:32] shall I say
[2:22:35] he's very inspired about coming up. I
[2:22:38] don't know what God has put on his
[2:22:39] heart, but I'm anxious to hear what God
[2:22:42] has put there.
[2:22:44] Heavenly Father, I bow before you, the
[2:22:48] Almighty One.
[2:22:51] Father, you have brought us here into
[2:22:55] this life and into this time for a
[2:22:57] divine purpose.
[2:23:00] We do not know the fullness of it, but
[2:23:02] we want we do press ourselves, oh God,
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; to the prize of the high calling that is
[2:23:08] in Christ Jesus.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; We press ourselves, oh God, in a way of
[2:23:13] surrender. We want to do all that you
[2:23:16] would have us to do, all that I can be,
[2:23:19] all that we have. Oh God, take this
[2:23:22] congregation of people. I pray that you
[2:23:25] will meld them and mold them into a
[2:23:28] single unit. I pray father that you will
[2:23:30] take words that were spoken even this
[2:23:33] morning or previously or something that
[2:23:36] someone has heard but I pray that you
[2:23:38] will take words oh God and I have
[2:23:41] confidence in the life that is in that
[2:23:44] individual
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Lord whatever state they are in
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; you're going to take and move them
[2:23:50] further
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; you're going to take even the events and
[2:23:53] the circumstances that are around us
[2:23:55] you're going to mold the vessel to be a
[2:23:58] stronger vessel
[2:23:59] to be a cleaner vessel,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; to be a more usable vessel.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we can say, "Use us, Lord.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves to you without any
[2:24:09] reservation whatsoever. You're the
[2:24:12] master potter,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; oh God, and how we thank you.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I dedicate
[2:24:19] this congregation, my own life to you,
[2:24:21] Father,
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; and these people that are standing here
[2:24:25] in Jesus Christ's name." And as we move
[2:24:27] towards this evening service, Lord, I
[2:24:30] ask that you will be mightily present to
[2:24:35] heal and to deliver your children. And
[2:24:38] as we have the Lord's table tonight, may
[2:24:41] it be a most blessed time in Jesus' name
[2:24:45] we ask it. Amen.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; I'd like to just sing that chorus uh we
[2:24:53] had the other night.
[2:24:55] I just want to thank you Lord for
[2:24:58] letting me hear your word.
[2:25:00] [Music]
[2:25:05] Thank you Lord
[2:25:08] for let me hear your word.
[2:25:13] What have I done to deserve such glory
[2:25:18] revealed in me?
[2:25:23] Thanks for that special night.
[2:25:28] When I saw your glorious light came face
[2:25:33] to face with eternal life. Lord I thank
[2:25:39] you. Let's sing the first verse and have
[2:25:43] to open my eyes.
[2:25:47] You couldn't even pass me by.
[2:25:52] For the age I was living in was
[2:25:56] wretched, poor and blind.
[2:26:02] There I heard recognizing your faith.
[2:26:06] Ser
[2:26:10] [Music]
[2:26:12] and the message of praise. Lord, would I

[2:26:25] for letting me your word
[2:26:29] [Music]

[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:42] night

[2:26:49] face to face with eternal life. Lord I
[2:26:55] thank you and curse
[2:26:58] not even in my wildest dreams.
[2:27:03] And I think I see Jesus
[2:27:08] as the coming of the Lord. The rapture
[2:27:13] mystery.
[2:27:15] [Music]
[2:27:17] I have heard, but now I see
[2:27:22] God in simplicity.

[2:28:13] two, but I want to ask
[2:28:16] I want to ask the congregation.

[2:28:21] Lord, for letting me hear your word.
[2:28:24] Would you go back in your own life
[2:28:29] before you heard the word
[2:28:33] and I'd like you just to project it
[2:28:34] forward and say, "Where would you be
[2:28:37] tonight
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; if you hadn't heard the word?"
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; It'd be pretty sad, wouldn't it?
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; I don't know where we would be. I don't
[2:28:47] know where brother and sister Biscllow
[2:28:48] would be. We don't know where we would
[2:28:51] be.
[2:28:53] So we can sing it with really some
[2:28:55] conviction and joy. Lord, I want to
[2:28:58] thank you.
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to thank you. Let's sing it
[2:29:01] once again. Lift it up in prayer now. I

[2:29:50] it. and we we were in your plan and in
[2:29:53] your thoughts. And oh God, as you said,
[2:29:57] your thoughts have been good thoughts
[2:29:59] towards us. And what great things you
[2:30:01] have done. And tonight, Lord, as we're
[2:30:04] preparing for the service this evening,
[2:30:07] I pray
[2:30:10] you'll come amongst us in a divine and
[2:30:13] special way. And may the people's hearts
[2:30:15] be prepared for the moment. May they
[2:30:18] come before you, oh God, with great and
[2:30:20] deep sincerity. We shall not do this as
[2:30:23] some tradition, but we shall do it in in
[2:30:25] truth.
