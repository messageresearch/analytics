========================================
Help me find you. How I need your touch. Maybe this is your prayer this morning. Lord, find my dry and broken places. &gt;&gt; Find my dry, broken places. So thirsty. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, forgive me if I've wandered. Oh Lord, forgive me if I want away from you. You are all I ever needed. Lord come and make me Lord pour your spirit out. Oh, and fall is like the rain saturated. Oh my thirsty soul and come and pour fresh on me. Lord, fill my cup again. Heal my heart. my heart and take me home. I need you. &gt;&gt; I need you now. Pour your spirit. Let's just stand as we sing it again. Pour your spirit out, Lord, and pour your spirit out. Your fall is like the rain. Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall fresh on me. My power again. My heart. My heart and make me home. I need you now pour your spirit out. Hallelujah. Is that your prayer this morning that his spirit would just fall and have total liberty in our midst. Lord, heal those who need healing. Oh God, deliver those who need deliverance. Lord Jesus, many of us have received the baptism but need another filling. Oh God, just pour your spirit in and fill our cups once more. Hallelujah. As we go to prayer, let's just sing that chorus. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up. Amen. Ooh, fill my cup, Lord. As the brothers would come and prepare to receive the offering also it up, Lord. Oh, come and quench this thirsting of my soul and bread of heaven. Feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me. Let's just lift our hands and we sing it again. Fill my cup Lord. Fill my cup Lord. Oh, overflowing this morning. We lift it up to you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Come and quench this thirsting hunger. is thirsting out of my soul. I want my love and take me home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Tim Dog, could I ask you please to come open the service for us? Amen. Our Brother William Smouse is just asking that we'd remember him in prayer for an unspoken prayer request. Also for our brother Mike Kucon who is still in need of prayer. And our sister Debbie Paris is asking prayer for a gentleman staying at the camp. He's requesting prayer for his sister Nenah who has kidney failure. They ask that we would remember her. Also we want to hold up our sister Carol Reagan in prayer this morning. Her needing of a healing touch for her heart this morning. Amen. many needs. If there's something on your heart that you just like to lift up before the Lord with an upraised hand and we know that he sees every hand and even this is an act of faith when you raise your hand and say, "God, you see my need." Amen. He's already provided. He's Jehovah Gyra. He's Jehovah Ni. He fights our battles for us. Jehovah Shalom. If you need peace this morning, he's Jehovah Rafa, the healer. Jehovah Shama. Hallelujah. God is with us. If you believe that this morning as we join our hearts together in prayer, let it be a prayer of faith this morning as our brother Tim comes. Amen. God bless you. Thank you, brother Tim. Wonderful, wonderful heavenly father. Your name is wonderful, marvelous, the counselor, the prince of pre peace, the mighty God, the everlasting father. Everything that we have need of, oh Lord, is in you. Lord, as we sense your presence so near, Lord, we want to say like the songwriter say, "Pass me not, oh gentle Savior. Hear my humble cry." While on others you are calling, do not pass me by, Lord. Lord, come by our pew. Come by the chair where we sit in this morning, oh God. Come by in this service, Lord. And there'll be others that are out on the internet that are streaming, Lord, that are praying. Come by our way this morning, Lord. Lord, you're the same there as you are here, Lord. You always come where you're invited. You are the great gentleman, oh God. You accept our invitation. And Lord, we invite you to come and have preeminence this morning. We invite you, Lord, to open up the word to us this morning. We invite you, Lord, to pour in revelation into our lives. For how many times do we underestimate the value of revelation, oh God. But Lord, we esteem it highly this morning that you would open the word as your servant steps behind the sacred desk. Lord, you anoint his lips, his thoughts, oh Lord, that the words would come that come forth would not be the words of a man, but Lord, that they be the inspiration of the Holy Spirit this morning, that you would do supernaturally amongst us, stretching forth your hand to do mighty works amongst your people. All things are possible, Lord. We are believing and your word is true. And Lord, we have these requests here this morning. Our sister Reagan's in need this morning, Lord. We bear her up before you. Our brother Donniey's wife, oh Lord, is help me. Lord, may you come to her even now where she is, oh God. Lord, may you quicken her mortal body with the virtue that was loosed at Calvary. For by your stripes, she was healed. Oh God, this woman that the request is in, oh Lord, that she has some some kind of kidney failure, Lord. Lord, you know her need. Lord, you're able to repair the kidneys for you made them. You are our creator and there is still a balm in Gilead. There is still a healer there. May you touch her mortal body. May you touch her soul, Lord. We pray. Lord, remember brother Mike Cucon tonight. Each and everyone, brother Smiles, each one, Lord. Father, we're remembering the needs even represented by the uplifted hand. We in our human frailty could not remember each one. Lord, we don't even have the strength to help one another. But Lord, if we would get ourselves out of the way and let your virtue flow through us, Lord, I believe that you can meet every need this morning. We ask Lord for the supernatural that which is beyond human control. We ask it in faith believing and we ask your blessing upon this service now. May you take control of every part of it as we give our offerings as a form of worship unto you. May you take it and multiply it and use it for your glory. We commit all things to you, Father, in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. I was just thinking as brother Tim was praying for our sister Carol that song that Sister Linda, Sister Dwan, Sister Marilyn sang their last CD. Lord, lay your nail scarred hand upon my heart. Amen. May God do that for our sister Carol even this morning. Amen. And grant her a healing. Amen. I'm going to ask our brother George to come and get ready to sing for us.

Some that can't be here this morning have already text and said uh I'm not I'm not so close there, but I will be very close. I'm listening and streaming and being in the meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I really enjoyed the the song. Brother George, our brother George and his wife, Sister Hope, I don't made up pronouncing exactly right. They're from Nigeria and they have uh immigrated uh and are going to be residents here. tell you is it really humbling when you see people have &gt;&gt; have gone through such a uh a lot of work to and just identify a place and and I trust that it'll be just exactly the diet that will bless you and your family. Brother George, &gt;&gt; very nice also to have our brother Dennis McGaryi here. God bless you and your daughter Charity I believe. It's nice to have you here as well. and brother Dennis is brother David McGary's brother. So, we're well acquainted with the uh with the family and the church there in Dallas. And uh we're thankful for each one that are here. Next week, uh this Sunday service will be as normal as regular Sunday morning service and Sunday evening. and it'll be Easter. Uh desire that you all will be here. I'll be speaking, Lord willing, an Easter service in in Switzerland. And I think this will be probably my last visit there. I keep saying that. Uh brother Donnie Reagan was to be there and still may be there. Uh they've been really counting on being in the services there. And brother Craig Bour is also brother Murphy is there and brother Murphy's largely going because the Chinese Bible is completed and there'll be many ministers from Europe uh all over Europe from Italy and from Croatia. Brother Jonathan Larga and his family plans to be there and we are just uh really uh really privileged when I speak of the Chinese Bible. You know, something goes on in my heart that perhaps I would like to convey to you and that is that this uh massive country of China with more people than is all in North America. many more people, probably three times the number. And God somehow for some reason did not allow or did not arrange for brother Brandham to actually visit that country. And I have wondered if it's just something that God has allowed for the bride of Jesus Christ to take the message there. And I have seen such an unusual movement uh taking place. And then and then to what a startling thing it was, what a surprise it was to find that the Chinese people just the the nature that they have to be precise and their work ethics and they begin to find that when when brother Brham read a certain scripture and that all happened from up there behind that little window where brother Murphy labored freely. really labored and just got the messages, translated the messages until the people have said over there, you are brother Brandham's voice to us otherwise we would not know of this prophet and they listen diligently and then would hear that the scriptures were not the same as they were read as brother Brandham read them in in his Bible. They were not the same. So they just automatically made notation and diarized it. You know how long ago that was? 18 years over 18 years ago. And they kept it and people all over from different places within that great massive country. They kept the uh those discrepancies because they it they had never once voiced we we need another Bible. But it just became it kind of rose out of the &gt;&gt; just like an an unheard voice &gt;&gt; rose out of amongst the people that the Bible isn't it's not a good Bible. It's not an accurate Bible and uh then a decision was taken here that uh no major didn't seem like a major decision just said well we need to change we need to do how many how many mistakes are there in the Bible well a fundamental group in Hong Kong had had done the Old Testament we heard that they had done the Old Testament and had made 30,000 th000 plus correctors corrections 30,000 and they said it's it's open domain help yourself so we took it and we said well we'll do the New Testament first John I think it's 1 John 5 and 7 there are three that give record in heaven the father the spirit and the word and these three are one that verse doesn't exist and that's a major verse verse. &gt;&gt; And so it finally came to the place where something needs to be done. And while Brother Murphy right here behind that window is doing the New Testament verse by verse, line by line and word by word. It becomes troubling that the Old Testament still is not for the verses of in the Psalms for example that refer to mercy and grace, they just use one word and that is love. And uh it's just not it's just not correct. And so, Brother Murphy behind that window laid aside the translation work, the current translation work, still keeping up with the messages, but went back to Genesis 1. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, &gt;&gt; God created the heaven and the earth and went through word by word by word through the entire Bible. I talked to him on one occasion. And he said, "I'm in Job." I tell you what, friends, you can't say thank you enough. You can't say thank God enough that God has people that will listen to his voice and give themselves unreservedly to see that someone else hears this glorious word. That's putting feet. &gt;&gt; That's putting feet to a testimony. That's putting feet to a life. And I have such an appreciation and finished it. It took 18 years, five years of doing just that until it was completed. And now that Bible is a beautiful, beautiful Bible. We're going to be taking it to Switzerland so that the people can see it, so the people can handle it. and brother and and brother uh Hammed's church in Nur Murphy'sboro, he said, "I just feel you should give it to the people so they can hold it in their hand as it goes by and have one after the other." And and uh I had to ask three times during the service, where is that Bible? Because they wouldn't pass it on. They wanted to keep holding it. And there's just something special, you know, when you get the Bible in your hand, doesn't matter what language it is, you just don't want to let go of it. And so anyway, we want to take some of those Bibles. But I want to let this congregation and all who are maybe streaming or connected one way or another, whether it be in Seattle or Victoria and the groups there. I I appreciate Brother Kyle getting the pictures of the meetings in Victoria. Thank you. That was very wonderful. But wherever they are, just to think that God has allowed and the prophet of God said that, you know, Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament and the bridal fulfill the New. We've got something to do &gt;&gt; and we're not here idly, friends. We're we're here with something to do. And we really appreciate that and appreciate every believer that is here. I want to I want to uh speak to you this morning and before we do I'm going to ask that brother Ryan will uh just lead in a in singing the course the unseen hand. Would you like to stand? You can be turning in your Bible if you would to 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter and we'll read. Just sing the chorus and then a verse. The unseen hand that I be this we land and some sweet day I'll reach last still guided by The unseen hand. There is an unseen hand to me that leads to I cannot see while you're this world of hope is still teach me as I go. I'm trusting to the unseen that guides me through this we still Guide it by the unseen hand. We'll pray now. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your unseen hand. Though it may be unseen, yet it's very, very real to us. We see your hand guiding us day by day in the affairs of life. We say, "Almighty Holy Spirit, we're so thankful for your presence. We've not gathered here in vain. We've not gathered here just as a church service. We've gathered here to worship the in invisible God made visible and living in the bodies of this believers by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We pray, Father, that you will be honored today, Lord. Pray that your name will be upheld and blessed. We pray and ask that you'll bless this service. Father, guide the words. Oh God, I give myself to you. I pray, Lord, that the both speaker and hearers alike will be indeed fed. I need also to partake of the word of God. Strengthen us, oh Father. I pray for every sick and afflicted person that may be in this place. You already purchased and paid for our healing and deliverance. I pray Lord we may accept it as you have given it so freely. Bless all now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you musicians. I want to read u before we read the scripture. I have a a quote I'd like you to read with me. Wonder if we can just turn down these lights a little bit, please. But Jesus lived in a world that no one knew about. He was an odd person. He lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was. If we lived in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are, I'd like you to notice those words, to what we are, we'd be a mystic to the world. The people wouldn't understand you. You'd walk in the spirit. What the spirit said you would do, what it forbid you would not do. Then the people begin to say, "You'd be a mystic to them." That's the way it is to all believers. &gt;&gt; They're a mistake. The people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves. Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch. The disciples couldn't understand him. When he spoke to them, they say this and then they said, "Why you talk in riddles? We do we don't understand this. How can this be?" See, they weren't in the world that he lived in. They couldn't understand him. Nobody could understand him. So when a man lives by faith and walks by faith, I mean substance faith, he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There now you're getting into bride material. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're getting into rapturing condition. Now that means for each one of us, not just for the pastor, deacons, trustees. That means for the leoty. Every individual walks in a world with God alone. You're baptized into this kingdom. &gt;&gt; And there's nobody in there but you and God. &gt;&gt; He gives the orders and you pack them out. Whatever he says, there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere. You walk right on. If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; If he's If the Lord says this, there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it. You go right on just the same. Now you're coming into perfect faith, &gt;&gt; perfect perfection. That cannot fail. that fails. That faith never fails. Yes, he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith. And so it is now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, you can turn the lights back up. Thank you. We'll read out of 2 Corinthians the 4th chapter starting with verse 13 to 18. We having the same faith according as it is written, I believed and therefore I have spoken, we also believe and therefore speak, knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. The word redounded is not one that's used often amongst us today, but it is to abound or overflow. It is to be abundantly furnished with or to have in abundance beyond measure. So it is saying that that through the thanksgiving of many of many abound to the glory of God. You see the focus is on the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction which is but for a moment workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight eternal weight of glory. 18th verse especially while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you have your seats, but keep your Bible. You may want it open as we move along. I I want to speak to you on this subject. I want you all to think about these things. Oh, a minister who may think about something for weeks or even months and then finally comes down they study and study and then expect to unloaded in an hour and a half or two. &gt;&gt; So that's very that's very difficult but I will get right to it. I want to speak on the unfolding of eternity &gt;&gt; within time. We are creatures of time &gt;&gt; and the prophet also said we're creatures of eternity &gt;&gt; since the new birth. So I I was pondering these things. Is everything that happens to us is it just an event of time? Obviously some things are and some things perhaps are not. And I and I began to more I pondered it, this service developed out of that. And I'm here to say that uh much of what happens in the believer's life is of a of an eternal dimension and eternity actually and uh actually is taking place. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh there are aspects of spiritual perfection and sinlessness. I I'm thinking about this also and I'm just I'm just I'm not there even myself but I want to bring it to you. There are aspects that the prophet of God approached. There are things which he said which are very very difficult for us to confess about the sinlessness of the believer. We can get excited and we say amen to it but we go out those doors and we don't we don't live as though uh in that sinless state. And I don't mean without sin, but I mean without the knowledge of being guilty. How can he bore or bear have borne our guilt and us to be guiltless? There are so many aspects of that. Uh and the perfection of the bride of Jesus Christ, the perfection of her. And we can say, you know, on nice things and we get all enthused about it, but somehow we become so susceptible to defeat &gt;&gt; and the things of this world. And I I'd like to just I'm just these are just some initial statements and we'll go on into it, but this is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; And I don't think that's any surprise to anyone. This is Satan's Eden. The prophet said that that Lucifer wanted a shinier kingdom. And I can say that Satan has made a very shiny kingdom. And we have become so adapted and so educated and so cultivated to this kingdom. That's the problem. When we go out those doors, we suddenly get knocked sideways and we see something or we hear something and you know and and we get all disturbed and all troubled and I don't feel good or this happened or that happens and it's maybe economical. It's maybe from who knows what it where it comes from. It may come from peers. It may come from education. They come from the car broke down or the tires flat or something and and all of it has such an effect on and I I've just been asking myself why if we're if we're such eternal beings why are these things affecting us &gt;&gt; to such a degree and then we come in and get all happy and then go back out and just like ether it all disappears and I said something's wrong. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me? It's the effect of this shinier kingdom. So I begin to ask myself, are we eternal beings? And are we is eternal things happening? And I I believe that once this service is over, it will surprise you to see how many things that are eternal &gt;&gt; are actually unfolding in time. &gt;&gt; Amen. For the believer, &gt;&gt; we are eternal beings &gt;&gt; and eternity has merged into time. &gt;&gt; And for the believer, the further we go in the the word of God, the word of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even belong within the time frame. &gt;&gt; It's eternal. It's an eternal word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe that this will be a blessing to you. &gt;&gt; Things that are seen, Apostle Paul says, are temporal. And temporal is is related to time. And eternal of course is related to eternity. Brother Vanom speaks. Now this is I'm giving you a quote not to give you a quote but to give you maybe a certain line out of the quote that it has a profound profound effect. Sometimes it's only one word or two words or one short sentence. But in Christ is the mystery of God revealed. It does come down to about one or two words. Now he said now God had a purpose. And you think oh yeah I've read that before. No, we're going to be reading it differently. God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's what I want, brother Brennham says, that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning. The hidden mystery of God that ha that he had in his mind before the world it ever began. And and here's the line. And how it's it's unfolded. Not how I have unfolded it or how we have unfolded it. How it's unfolded. In other words, the mystery of God or the word of God, the thing that was hidden in God's mind. And then he goes on to say how it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; How it's unfolded. God's secret, God's mystery, how it has unfolded. It has its own power. It doesn't depend on a preacher to unfold it or someone else to unfold it. It's unfolded itself. This word of God has power within itself. &gt;&gt; You can sit on your hands all the rest of your life if you wish, but this will keep unfolding. &gt;&gt; People can have church and services and whatever format they want to have. They can go on and on week after week and and and and if they're not if they're not believers of the word, if they're not elect of the word of God, this will bypass them. they will continue on. And that's why the prophet speaks so harshly about denominations because denominations cast a a group into a certain truth or a certain and tongues is the evidence or I if I shake or if I do this or if I do that and and then people become fixed and that's the problem. God is you can't put God in a box. You can't even put him in a message box. He's not in a box. He's going to continue to fulfill and it's going to unfold itself. And so I come to the unfolding is literally the uh fulfilling of what God got in his mind as a mystery. It's going to unfold itself. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, how it's unfolded itself. I want to speak this morning on how it's unfolded itself down to this present hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; It didn't stop unfolding. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham left &gt;&gt; and it's not preachers that unfold it, &gt;&gt; it's God that unfolds it. &gt;&gt; God continues to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; And you and I, our great our great challenge is to be in it. Let me be in it. &gt;&gt; Let me be part of what's going on. &gt;&gt; And I want to stay so alert. And in order to do so, you got to make certain that this shiny world out here doesn't distract you, &gt;&gt; doesn't slow you down, &gt;&gt; doesn't dull our minds because that's what it's set up to do. &gt;&gt; We're not to have that effect upon us. &gt;&gt; And so how it's unfolded itself. And then he says, "And then you will understand clearly then you see on I believe what is being done." So I'm not inferring that we unfold it. Not you and I that do it, but the word in some special in some special revelation, but that the eternal word, the eternal word has and is unfolding itself right down to this present hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; The word of God, the Bible, is a record of eternal events &gt;&gt; taking place in time. This is God's eternal word. &gt;&gt; So the fulfillment of this is eternal things, eternity, pieces of inter eternity happening within time. &gt;&gt; So I want you to think about that. Now the word of God is uh is a record of eternal events taking place in time. The unfolding is in the fulfillment. And I believe it requires spiritual revelation to recognize or see or hear the spiritual events in our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the passage of time, the scene changes due to civilization. So, we're living in a much different time. Uh, brother Paul Neighbor and Sister Heidi up there. I had to had to have a another look. He sent me a little link and uh the things that the world has devised and it says the future is here. Something like that. And I don't know if you got it, but wow. By the time I was done reading the things that already people have, they've developed it. It was I believe in Korea and they've developed stuff and and uh I can't even catch up now &gt;&gt; and I don't know if I even want to be in that world. &gt;&gt; It's just too too far advanced. I I mean, well, people want to communicate and and uh I I don't want to communicate that that much. says, "Tell I'll tell you what I think or I'll show you and communicate and I don't even want to to know everything that's in my mind, let alone what's in everybody else's mind." &gt;&gt; Don't you feel that way? &gt;&gt; I thought of uh I thought of us. Now this is just just uh digressing for a moment but I thought of patriotism you know to be patriotic and uh our countries uh you know we that's something I talked to the people in a convention I believe down in Louisiana and uh about being patriotic and America is very very patriotic and the flag and stars and stripes and uh Our flag is not that old. Our flag, it took us a while to get the Union Jack off and put a maple leaf on and and that happened actually in our present prime minister's father's while he was here. The Canadian flag came into existence. So, it's not that long ago, maybe 50 years ago. uh flag patriotism. Uh Webster says about patriotism. Webster says that being patriotic is a love or devotion to your homeland. &gt;&gt; Well, my homeland happens to be unseen. And I'd make a big mistake by becoming too connected to anything that's visible. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I would want to take ownership of Hollywood, &gt;&gt; of the perverted state of the world, of the homelessness and the drunkenness and the violence and the murder and so on. So say, "Well, you're only seeing the bad part of it." Well, let's see the good part of it. The good part of it is the gospel &gt;&gt; is being preached. &gt;&gt; Lives are being changed. &gt;&gt; Creatures are being transformed &gt;&gt; from earthly &gt;&gt; mortals to immortal beings. That's the gospel of Jesus Christ and that's the good thing that's happening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I think that we ought to have our patriotism changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I really do. Expressing devotion and vigorous support for one's country. &gt;&gt; I do not think that simply coming to church is vigorous support &gt;&gt; to our homeland. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that vigorous support &gt;&gt; is somebody who is living with a fervor and a zeal &gt;&gt; day by day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day. Your neighbor knows it. Whether you're a mystic or whether you're sideways or whether you're insane or whatever they want to think or say about you, but just let your life register. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't have a chance to say it, but just let your life register. Oh yeah. Well, they are, you know, they are, we don't have much to do with them. That's perfectly fine. In a human lifetime, this lifetime that you and I are living in, it is filled and we are acquainted with beginnings and endings. Life begins at birth and ends at death. We begin school &gt;&gt; and we graduate. We begin married life till death do us part. We begin raising a family and end up empty nesters. We begin a job or a profession and we move on and advance and then end up in retirement. We may become sick and I trust that the sickness ends in health &gt;&gt; and we become healthy. &gt;&gt; And so we are filled with our minds are consumed with beginnings and endings. &gt;&gt; But I am acquainting you or reacquainting you or emphasizing our homeland had no beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our constitution had no beginning. &gt;&gt; God held us in his mind &gt;&gt; and we belong to another country. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are residents here, but we're citizens of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And we should never forget that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are citizens of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Regardless of what language we speak, regardless of what color we are, we're citizens of the kingdom of God. We may have come from Congo or Nigeria or from Canada or America or South America or El Salvador or wherever more. It has nothing to do with that. We're citizens of the kingdom of God. Can this congregation say amen and a hearty amen? We're citizens of the kingdom of God. Residents of a country of Canada or United States or wherever. That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; We're It's irrelevant. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we need to become really we need to live that when we go out these doors. &gt;&gt; Don't refer to me as a Canadian. &gt;&gt; I'm a resident of Canada, but my citizenship is in another country. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a place where you won't need a visible passport. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 5:9 says, "Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world." I thought I would just throw that in. all the things that hit you when you walk out of this building. I'm not so concerned about while you're here. I know while you're here, what it is you're going to hear and you're going to sing and your mind is going to be on eternal things. But when we go out here and we we get all taken up with our job, remember your job and your education and everything that you do has a beginning and an ending. But you are eternal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it might be hard to confess that, but you need to confess that I am an eternal being. &gt;&gt; I came from God and I go back to God. That doesn't have to be a nice phrase. That must not be a nice phrase. It must be something that's a reality to you. I'm not of this world. I'm not going to lay on a slab in some uh funeral parlor and and just be an average person and live like a dog or was born and die and simply go to the earth. Not so &gt;&gt; the clouds of dirt that the dirt they may put upon a person's face are not going to hold a son of God. Do you think God otherwise we haven't even got a picture of God? GOD'S ETERNAL BEING. Prophet says FILLS ALL TIME AND SPACE. FILLS THE SPACE BETWEEN YOU and me today. &gt;&gt; God fills it. Healing fills it. Mercy fills it. Forgiveness fills it. AND WHAT JESUS BOUGHT WITH HIS OWN BLOOD, THE VERY LIFE OF CHRIST FILLS THE SPACE. THE ATTRIBUTES of God are in THIS BUILDING. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID HE COULDN'T HEAL YOU. IF HE WAS HERE WITH THIS SUIT ON, HE CAN'T HEAL YOU. HE'S ALREADY done it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, &gt;&gt; when Jesus was conceived, that was different. &gt;&gt; That was different. There was a young young lady maybe in her mid- teens by the name of Mary. &gt;&gt; And now she's visited by an angel. &gt;&gt; Says, "You you're going to conceive in your womb. And you're going to bring forth, you're going to be overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and you're going to bring forth without know. And she said, "Well, how will this happen without me knowing a man?" He said, "Uh, the spirit of the highest will overshadow thee. And and you'll bring forth a son. His name will be Jesus. and he'll save his people from their sins. &gt;&gt; Friends, did that happen? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that happened? &gt;&gt; Eternity intercepted time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To change things forever. &gt;&gt; Eternity, an eternal an eternal being. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An eternal being. &gt;&gt; God himself preparing a body. &gt;&gt; That'll be a body. And the prophet of God says finally a masterpiece, the final masterpiece was on earth and was so much like the sculptor that the sculptor stepped into the masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Did that happen? &gt;&gt; Then I say eternity came to earth. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That was a different happening. Now events on earth began to unfold with a with a merging of eternity in time and things begin to happen. And they thought they were having a normal crucifixion of a man. It was eternity in time. They didn't realize that the sins, their sins were being paid for by him on the cross &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS GOD IN A BODY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ETERNITY WAS unfolding &gt;&gt; and they DIDN'T REALIZE IT, BUT ETERNITY WAS MERGING. TIME WAS BEING SWALLOWED UP BY ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; And you think this is just another movement or just another church group. the the the believers the the ranks of the believers are eternity &gt;&gt; TAKING PLACE IN TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And friends, we are living where WE'RE GOING TO BE. AND THIS GOD, OUR FATHER, MY FATHER, your father, he who HAD THIS MYSTERY IN HIS MIND, THIS IS HOW IT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO PURGE THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO SAY, "FEAR NOT, CHILDREN. I'LL MAKE it worthy for you to live on. FEAR NOT, CHILDREN. I'LL CLEAN IT UP. &gt;&gt; FEAR NOT, CHILDREN. THIS VIOLENCE WILL DISAPPEAR. THIS HATRED will disappear. THIS BIGOTRY WILL DISAPPEAR. THIS PERVERSION WILL BE GONE. I'LL CLEAN IT AND this unbelief will be be annihilated. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ETERNITY IS SWALLOWING up time &gt;&gt; and you're a part of it. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE PART AND PARCEL OF ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; If you're not, &gt;&gt; if you're not, if you don't believe it, you live like a man, born like a man, die like a man, and go to a man's grave. &gt;&gt; That's not what I want. We could describe each one of these phases of life as part of time, also part of eternity that had no beginning. There's an aspect of the believer's life that undergoes an aspect of a believer's life &gt;&gt; that undergoes supernatural experience &gt;&gt; that supersedes and transcends &gt;&gt; all human understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something has to happen TO YOU AND IS happening to you that you cannot explain and you CANNOT GRASP AND YOU CANNOT TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT TRANSCENDS YOUR LANGUAGE. &gt;&gt; Does it not? &gt;&gt; If not, I'll ask to the wise man or the wise woman. Explain life. Tell me what are we doing here? What's this all about? &gt;&gt; You can't even understand it. That's why people go and get drugged up and alcohol and all the rest of it. Entertain and sports and whatever more. Fill their life with something. And Satan with this shiny kingdom is just keeping shiny things in front of them to keep people occupied. Oh yeah. Yeah. And finally they keel over and they're all done. &gt;&gt; And the and the neighbors think, "Oh, that's what life's all about." And we we hope that somebody will stand behind the podium and tell what nice people they were. and and speak them right into heaven. Nonsense. &gt;&gt; There is no such a thing. WHEN A MAN BECOMES A NEW CREATURE IN CHRIST JESUS AND A WOMAN ARE A new creature. &gt;&gt; AND APOSTLE PAUL SAYS, "OLD THINGS HAVE PASSED away and behold, all things are new." &gt;&gt; You're going to have to give me a little time this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's a lot longwinded. Just remember, we're eternal. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was born, eternity was introduced into time. &gt;&gt; In a different way, the arrival of the masterpiece, the arrival of the sacrifice, &gt;&gt; the perfect image of the invisible God, the cornerstone. He spoke of these two realms as existing at the same time during his time here on earth. &gt;&gt; And I've been reading in John's gospel. And I'll come to it a little later on, Lord willing. John, the Apostle John was quite different from Matthew, Mark, and Luke. But John 3:13 said, "And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the son of man which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; And he never explained it. &gt;&gt; In fact, as Jesus said, a lot of things in the Gospel of John that you can't really explain. In Revelation 3:14, the Bible says, "And unto the angel of the church of the Leodysians," right? &gt;&gt; And so this is we know that was brother Brandham that was was the angel of the church &gt;&gt; or the messenger of this time. &gt;&gt; And he said and and God sent to him a message and said, "Write these things the amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; The faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was that beginning. &gt;&gt; I'm glad there was another beginning. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it's not just Genesis 1:1. In the beginning, &gt;&gt; this was our beginning. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, &gt;&gt; the beginning of the new creation of God. &gt;&gt; I'M GLAD THE SACRIFICE WAS THE BEGINNING. Your sacrifice, friends. was the beginning. Without that, you do not have a new creature in Christ Jesus. You have no possibility of being a new creature. But because there was a beginning, &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SUBJECT. THIS BODY MAY be the product of Adam and Eve's uh failure back there and it fails. &gt;&gt; You do all you want. You eat all the organic food you want. And I believe that a person should do the best that they can. You swallow all the pills you want. You have all the vitamins that you want. You'll still get older. &gt;&gt; You'll still have a year by year go by. &gt;&gt; I was thinking of an old friend of mine, Brother McGriff. He said his wife went into the grocery store and she was a little longer and he thought, "Well, I will I'll just go and see what she's doing." And so he said, "I was just tunching right by the dark windows and he said, I looked in the window and there was a old man kind of hunched over and he says, I stopped. It was me." So I say to my wife, "Walk straight. We want to be real erect, &gt;&gt; but you know, regardless how straight you try to be, you finally slump over. &gt;&gt; It's it's called time. It's called these old bodies, whatever you want to call it. But I say there's a land &gt;&gt; beyond the river that's not affected by time. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You believe that, don't you? &gt;&gt; And the happiness is genuine. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The beginning of the creation of God. It's a profound thought to consider that both time and timelessness of God was then embodied in one. &gt;&gt; That's a profound thought in one. Jesus Christ. And from the words of Jesus, we conclude that both worlds were present in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an incredible thought &gt;&gt; that a man who people found all kinds of error with actually was eternity &gt;&gt; and time merged into that one body. &gt;&gt; What a glorious one. You want to think about that &gt;&gt; eternity. How could he not say things that were JUST SO PROFOUND and so un and and so complicated for the human mind? The human mind hasn't got the capacity &gt;&gt; to grasp those things. And I can I I tell you what I read I was reading in John while I was away and I read about 18 19 20 chapters and I just realized there was a whole lot of it I couldn't understand. I could understand it you know with a human understanding but couldn't understand the depths. And I would even say Lord cause me to know what you're saying. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And thus he spoke of his father. Is this am I following along for you? &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of his father and he spoke to the his religious leaders that he said, "I'm the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead &gt;&gt; but of the living." &gt;&gt; Right? We're referred to as creatures of time, but also creatures of eternity. I'm giving you some message quickly, some background. In the message, we would see Jesus. Brother Brandham said, "Blessed and eternal God, as we come humbly as the creatures of time into thy presence, we ask that you'll remember us, Lord, and we'll for and will forgive us of all of our sins and trespasses against you." And then in Serpent Seed, he says, "We're not creatures of time. We're creatures of eternity." &gt;&gt; That is not a contradiction. That's an evolution. &gt;&gt; We were born creatures of time, but we have become creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One of the most important was when we were born again. And you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture that involves Nicodemus is not in Matthew, Mark, or Luke, &gt;&gt; but it's in John. &gt;&gt; Just hold that. in questions and answers. He says, "When a man is born of the spirit of God, he's a creature no longer of time, but he's a creature of eternity." &gt;&gt; Amen. He's passed from death unto life. He's passed from the He's passed from the time element into the eternal eternity. He can never perish. God swore that he'd raise him up at the last day. And it's it it's difficult to look at a person maybe gasping their last breaths on life and and and and yet for him to be able to have that kind of faith and confidence. You say, "Well, is that just a self-will? Is it just something he was educated to say? Is this is this something he just learned from childhood? Or is it a reality?" &gt;&gt; It can it must either be a reality or this book isn't true. Right. &gt;&gt; And it can't be something, well, I just learned it or I've quoted this all my life. It has to be something that is such a reality now that it's that that's out there that's a lie. &gt;&gt; That out there isn't true. &gt;&gt; All of this other is just all it is is side issues to help me through life. I'm just thinking over whether I should say it or not. Do you want me to say it? &gt;&gt; All of your difficulties is a Satan's facade. Right. &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it's health issues, &gt;&gt; financial issues, &gt;&gt; whatever kind of issues there are. &gt;&gt; They're only it's only a facade. &gt;&gt; Another word for that is a fake. &gt;&gt; Another word for that might be a bluff. Satan's bluffing the people. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the kind of problems that you have, the scripture has says that our brethren in the world are afflicted by the same things. &gt;&gt; Only they use different things to overcome it and forget it. And it might be, you know, some uh social work or social club or or or some people are trying to drown out the reality of life. &gt;&gt; The very world that the devil gave them &gt;&gt; and they have find or have followed shiny things. Listen friends, don't follow shiny things. They will lose their shine &gt;&gt; and the real world will finally sink in someday &gt;&gt; and we don't want it. &gt;&gt; The devil can have it back. &gt;&gt; He can have all that he's designed back. &gt;&gt; He can have all the Hollywood he wants, all the entertainment he wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you think that maybe we're just up here preaching, but I I want to say to you in all sincerity, you wouldn't want my burdens. You wouldn't want my burdens. &gt;&gt; Even in the last few days, you wouldn't want my burdens. Say, well, you know, are you just that strong? No, no, no. We're not strong. We're we're weak. We're just children, but we have a God. And of my confidence wasn't in that God. &gt;&gt; And he has come through in the last few days. &gt;&gt; He's come through and showed I'm your father. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm saying it to you. I'm not saying it to you as a preacher. I'm saying it to your brother. &gt;&gt; We have a God. &gt;&gt; He's your God. &gt;&gt; And my God. He's your father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your father. &gt;&gt; A kind father. a caring father. And you must believe that &gt;&gt; and YOU MUST CONFESS THAT. &gt;&gt; MY GOD, &gt;&gt; my God. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, brother Daniel? &gt;&gt; He's our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's present. &gt;&gt; He's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't dispense with him. He's here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He's more real than the one sitting next to you. The one sitting next to you, the body THERE MAY PASS AWAY, BUT HE WILL NEVER PASS AWAY. And that's WHY JESUS SAID, "I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU." &gt;&gt; I will never forsake you. &gt;&gt; Others may, but he will not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. So when man is born of the spirit, he becomes a creature no longer of time but of eternity. &gt;&gt; In him was life. &gt;&gt; John 1 and4 and the life was the light of men both mortal and immortal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Both mortal and immortal life were revealed in the being of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God in Jesus Christ took upon himself &gt;&gt; both physical life &gt;&gt; that could die a man's death &gt;&gt; and also immortal life that was beyond the reach of death. &gt;&gt; He's the one. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. You call him your Lord and Master. He said if I be your Lord and Master you'll do the things that I say. He's the one who had to say that he was virgin born. He couldn't prove he was virgin born. &gt;&gt; You can prove that you have a certain mother and a certain father. He could not prove that Joseph was his father because he was not his father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so that very fact gave him a bad name. &gt;&gt; And he bore that bad name so that he could tell YOU THAT MY FATHER'S your father. ISN'T THAT WORTH REJOICING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; He bore that illicit birth &gt;&gt; name so that you could be genuinely born &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; in Abraham's grace covenant. and a man or a woman that can lean upon God's bosom. He said that's my father who's created heavens and earth. He made me. This is something you're you say. This is he's saying it that you'll say this. He's my father. &gt;&gt; He made me. &gt;&gt; He made me a new creature. &gt;&gt; And after he made that was after he made me a creature of time. You made ME A CREATURE OF TIME, BUT YOU MADE ME A NEW CREATURE. &gt;&gt; You're my father. &gt;&gt; In a way, it's bypassing your human father. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I have a human father." That's my dad. Listen, folks. Your dad didn't even know you &gt;&gt; when you were a little sperm. &gt;&gt; He didn't have a clue what you were going to look like. &gt;&gt; But your father that I'm talking about, he knew who you were. He knew what you were going to look like. &gt;&gt; He knew why you were coming here. He knew that he would intercept you in time with eternity. AND BECAUSE YOU'RE an eternal being, you'd get more than excited, you'd believe it. &gt;&gt; AND YOU'D EVEN SAY, "I DON'T KNOW WHY I BELIEVE IT, BUT I BELIEVE THAT." &gt;&gt; Maybe earthly FATHER DOESN'T BELIEVE IT, BUT I BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; You believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why sometimes earthly friends say, "I can't go there. I can't go with you." Say of war, I'm on my way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where Rebecca was called up. I didn't know where it was going to fit and I had it down, but I just put it at the bottom of this message. Rebecca was asked finally her her parents &gt;&gt; in this life in time said uh will you go &gt;&gt; and and and Eleazar is there and the camels are there and everything's there and Isaac is only a something that's touched her ear &gt;&gt; there's Isaac &gt;&gt; I'm here my my father my my lord he has given all of his substance to his son. &gt;&gt; She has only heard about him. &gt;&gt; Says, "Will you go?" &gt;&gt; Just three words. I will go. &gt;&gt; I will go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope I have time in the message experiences. Brother Brandham is describing in a and describing the appearance of the angel and the light and and he said it's the first time he saw him that way and he described his face and the size of him about 200 lb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says and the angel is telling him you'll you'll take a message of healing to the people. And he says, "I'm not educated and they won't believe me." And the angel says, "I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says those three words, "I will go." &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; I'm so glad &gt;&gt; he went. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad &gt;&gt; somebody could go &gt;&gt; that could speak of things from an unseen world? &gt;&gt; And now I want to bring you. Now, I need your full attention just for a moment because I'm jumping way, way ahead in my message. I'm so thankful &gt;&gt; that you and I are following a message &gt;&gt; where a messenger spent so much time peering into another world. &gt;&gt; What world was that? &gt;&gt; It was eternity &gt;&gt; and then he speaks FROM WHAT HE SEES AND WHAT HE SEES is an eternal happening. This is what's going to happen. this is what happened to you and you fell and and he talked about a man in a hay rack. You fell on a hay rack and and HE GOES INTO SUCH DETAILS. THIS IS HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT IT'S COMING FROM ETERNITY? ETERNITY IS IN INTERSECTING TIME and we read it and we think oh this is just in a book this is just on a disc. DON'T YOU EVER think that &gt;&gt; GOD IS INTERCEPTING YOUR LIFE, &gt;&gt; giving you human eyes and a brain of UNDERSTANDING TO SAY THAT came from God, &gt;&gt; THAT CAME FROM ETERNITY. And now he had a vessel here on earth that would be simple enough and humble enough to say what he saw. AND THAT WHAT HE SAW WAS REACHING INTO AN ETERNAL REALM. And eternity was being unfolded in time. &gt;&gt; For eternal beings to believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some say I believe it. &gt;&gt; Some say I don't believe it. Some said I believe it's a hoax. &gt;&gt; Some said I believe it's of the devil. And brother Brandham even said to people standing right in front of him, &gt;&gt; sure, &gt;&gt; it depends what you think it is. &gt;&gt; If you think this comes from Satan, &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you think it comes from God, &gt;&gt; that's where your reward will come from. &gt;&gt; Depends what you think this message is. Yes. &gt;&gt; What this message that I'm preaching is &gt;&gt; this is not my opinion. &gt;&gt; This is not some man's thought. &gt;&gt; This is something that's divine from God &gt;&gt; that it's energized by the Holy Ghost and comes from the word of God. &gt;&gt; And if you believe that, &gt;&gt; you are eternal beings. &gt;&gt; God is my father. Jesus teach us to pray. Our father &gt;&gt; whose father his father and my father JESUS FATHER AND MY FATHER I father my father which art in heaven and and the prophet comes as this heaven is just a breath away. IT'S JUST A STEP AWAY. It's right here present with us. You're living in it. You're living in time, but you're an eternal being unfolding. And eternity is unfolding. The events and the mystery of God is unfolding within the body, bride body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, to me it looks like a looks like it's just another church." That's right. That's in the temporal scene. &gt;&gt; But of a to a person who's an eternal being, it looks very very different. Oh, we sing the same courses. And we sing the same songs. Catholics do it. Orthodox do it. OTHER PEOPLE DO IT. I DON'T CARE WHO DOES IT. &gt;&gt; It has a different meaning &gt;&gt; for a believer. Does it have a different meaning for you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Are they only new when a person's in the sanctuary, &gt;&gt; or are they new when we go out? Are they new when everything has gone sideways? Are they new when sickness befalls us? Are they new? What is it that is new? I can tell you friends, those things of this world, Satan is not greater than our God. Our God is greater than these things. You have no one amongst this earthly clan that could say, "For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is flesh. &gt;&gt; And that which is born of the spirit is spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a holy spirit. &gt;&gt; That which is born of the spirit is spirit. &gt;&gt; Born of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Is it so? Is it so in your life? Is it so? Is a reality. Say, God, let this message ring not only true in my ears, but let it be true in my soul. &gt;&gt; Can I tell some of the events of the last few days? Joanne has not been here at the Oregon and much sicker than you may know. And we were away on vacation and I became very very very troubled and very very burdened and we came back one week early. I changed the flights. Yes. It cost something. You know at a time like that nothing means anything. &gt;&gt; That's all the system. Well, you can't change the you can't change your tickets. Well, there has to be a way. There's had to be a way. you. Okay. All right. Well, it's going to cost you whatever it is. Whatever it is, just just do do your thing. And that's recognizing people are in in this world, &gt;&gt; but you're from another world. &gt;&gt; So, well, it's going to cost you something. Well, God will have to provide it. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. I'm in another kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we came back and went over and saw Tom and Joanne and uh Joanna is not well and she's gasping for her breath. And said, "Well, her lungs are clear. There's no pneumonia." That's what one doctor said, but another hospital said, "Well, there was some." Anyway, that has nothing to do with me. That's their diagnosis and that's fine. I respect them and the prophet held the doctors in high esteem and uh that was day one evening. Next morning I went back. Sister Joanne had a doctor some years ago over a period of three four years. I won't use her name but she's very very very highly highly qualified uh specialist. If you were to get to see her, it would maybe take you 9 months. You'd be well to see her within a year. A very very busy person and I am sometime we think oh the Holy Spirit is just so wonderful. I'm just happy and jigging and dancing. No sometime you're very very troubled &gt;&gt; and it's the spirit of God. Even when Mary was told, "You're going to have a child. You're going to have a you're going to conceive," she was troubled. How how how is that going to happen? Me not knowing a man. The spirit of the Almighty will overshadow you and there will be a performance of those things because thou hast believed. Let it be unto me according to your word. She can't even she can't even convince anybody she met an angel. &gt;&gt; That's how vague that's how abstract that world becomes. I'm here to tell you that's a real world. &gt;&gt; It's more real than the seat you're sitting on. &gt;&gt; It's more real than the breath you're breathing. &gt;&gt; It's a reality. &gt;&gt; This is not church. Right. &gt;&gt; We're here to meet the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to testify he is a living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I looked into Joannne's eyes and I said, "You need somebody that knows you, knows your body." And I named this doctor from some time ago. She knows you. She understands you. And then before we left, we had prayer together. Got down and prayed. And uh I didn't remember what we prayed. Brother Tom and Joanne together reminded me and I said uh in prayer, have Dr. Stalter was a name. have her call Joanne tonight. To me, that would have been such an absurd statement. I wouldn't have never prayed anything like that. But they both said after I was done and had left, said, "How is Dr. Star going to call me tonight?" "Tonight?" And I left there. My wife who's sitting here said she didn't know what was happening. Said, "You stepped into the car took your iPhone. I punched in an address and drove to another city in a New Westminster." And when I parked the car, I said to my wife, "Sit here. I'm going to run." And I ran out because it was coming right on to 4:00. Offices closed at 4:00. And I ran across two streets into this office building upstairs to the fourth floor, went to the door, opened it up. There was a young lady and I prayed on the way. I said if I'm not to see her, if you have some other way that you would get your glory, if you have some other way, you get the glory, I will be careful to see that you get all the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No one can do anything but God himself. &gt;&gt; And this will be God and God alone. And if you see fit that I should not see her, just say arrange that she's not in. I walked up. I said, "Excuse me. I'm Mr. Biscll. I'm Joanne Ray's father. I need to see Dr. Staller just for two minutes." She said, "She's not in." Like that was the end of the subject. I said, "Well, thank you." I said, "Please, could you have Dr. Staller give Joanna a call?" So, she's typing it in her machine. Okay. That was over. And I went out and I went to into the foyer, into the lobby, and I punched the elevator button, but there was something still wasn't satisfied inside. I left. So I went back in and I said, "Excuse me." I leaned over and looked right into her eyes, said, "Would you please do me a personal favor? Would you please contact the doctor, Dr. Stler, and have her call Joanne?" And so she's still typing, "All right." and I walked out to the natural in this world, you'd say very unfriendly. All I knew, I was being guided by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And when I walked out, I got in a car and drove home. We came to church this Wednesday night. Soon as we got home, the phone rang. Joanne never answers the phone. She's too weak. Just that weak. Never answers the phone. Has no voice. And she was on the phone struggling. Dad, did you call Dr. Stler? I said no. I went to her office. She said she just she just called me at 9:30. She called me and I just got off the phone with her and she wants to see me tomorrow morning at the Royal Colombian Hospital and she could hear my voice. She wasn't that troubled from the voice, but she wants to see me. And then what would we say, Tom? 10 hours. In 10 hours, we had a new girl, Tom, a new wife, and Sister Biscll, and I a new daughter because the thing turned right around. And I had told God, if that doesn't happen, I will cancel out of Switzerland, even though I had been receiving a message, this message in a different way completely for Switzerland. And my wife says, "Well, I know you are going to Switzerland. God has given you a message for Switzerland." I said, "Only if this happens, this must turn around. There must be a complete turnaround. Joanna is listening to this. She sent me a text just before. She said, "I won't be near you physically, but I will be near you in spirit. &gt;&gt; I'll be listening." And so she's listening to what I'm saying. This is the absolute truth. She came home yesterday, was released from hospital yesterday, said, "Just go home now and rest." You may think that that wasn't that serious. I'll tell you what, God stepped down &gt;&gt; to do eternity stepped down. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm preaching about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had eternity not stepped down, &gt;&gt; I probably wouldn't be here preaching this morning. I experienced while I was studying this. I could see eternity, eternal things INTERCEPT TIME AND CREATURES of time AND DICTATE TO THEM WHAT they shall do. AND WE OBEY THE SPIRIT. THERE WAS NO INSTRUCTOR TO say that. There was no PHYSICIAN TO SAY THAT. GOD THE GREAT PHYSICIAN. &gt;&gt; The healer is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE. &gt;&gt; CHRIST IS HERE. &gt;&gt; To do whatever you have need of. And you think THINGS COULD GO SIDEWAYS. THEY MAY GO SIDEWAYS. BUT GOD IS IN CONTROL. &gt;&gt; Our father is in control. &gt;&gt; Our job is to listen to that voice, to heed that voice and say, "I will go. &gt;&gt; I will go. I will do it. I WILL SAY WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY. &gt;&gt; I WILL ASK REPENTANCE WHEN YOU WANT me to say. &gt;&gt; What shall we do? They said to Peter, men and brethren, what shall we do? They were pricricked in their hearts. That's what needs to happen. Maybe even some here need to be pricricked in THEIR HEART. AND ONCE YOU'RE PRICRICKED IN YOUR HEART, YOU SAY, "LORD GOD, WHAT SHALL I DO?" SAY, REPENT &gt;&gt; AND BE BAPTIZED every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and you shall be saved. &gt;&gt; I see. Brother Joe Waldner, is David away? Good. You're here. I got a phone call yesterday and a pastor in the church about 4,000 miles from here stood up in his congregation in the morning service and he said, "Tonight we are having the Lord's table and footwash and communion and I want you to be here and I have a surprise for you. So the people gathered for Lord's table, footwash and communion. Did you listen to it, Tim? I saw you nodding, so I guess that's right. You know about this, Brother Tom? and he puts on the screen brother David Waldner &gt;&gt; giving his testimony from the other day &gt;&gt; and running all over this church and that pastor was so moved he said listen FOLKS CLOVERDALE IS HAVING A REVIVAL &gt;&gt; and it's been GOING ON FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS HE SAID AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT FOR OUR CHURCH A REVIVAL &gt;&gt; I say Keep it burning, friend. Hallelujah. This God that you serve, he's not far away. He's present. AND JUST SAY TO HIM TODAY, I WILL PRAY. I will go. &gt;&gt; I will ask him to do more for us. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; It's eternity. &gt;&gt; Eternal things are eternity. It's not oh when this life is over. No friends, everything the things that we as the elect of God are experiencing they are eternal things. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; I don't want you to take this just as a service. Can I have a few more minutes of your time? Now, this is probably one of my main points. Some things are hard for us as humans to grasp. And excuse me for taking the time but we need to take it. I just have felt Lord I am not going to dilute. I'm not going to belittle what you are doing. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you if we needed the time. We shall take the time. And tonight I am so filled with expectancy. I want to see and hear our brother Tim Dodd as he speaks about Ethiopia because to me it's not just a country in the world. That's a a name that the people have given it and so on so forth, but it's a part of the earth and there's people there that God allowed to be birthed and born here who have an ache in their heart and a desire for the truth. And if God opens a door for us to send the truth over there, I will go &gt;&gt; or we will send somebody. OUR BROTHER TIM DODD SAID HE WENT GO &gt;&gt; and his son went with him &gt;&gt; and I would SAY GLORY TO GOD. THIS CONGREGATION TO SAY GOD BE PRAISED. &gt;&gt; HE HAS GIVEN US THIS OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; HOW ELSE WILL THEY HEAR IF WE DON'T SEND SOMEBODY? &gt;&gt; GOD BLESS BROTHER BUSABOSI. GOD BLESS THE WORK over there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And next Sunday or Sunday, April the 1st, we're going to have brother brother Eboli from Uganda here. &gt;&gt; Uh it's a April the 1st, is it not? &gt;&gt; April 1 and Friday. There'll be no Sunday that no service that Wednesday during the week coming up to April the 1st and then we'll be brother Ibali on Friday and on Sunday. Amen. Now, we got that out of the way. But I said earlier, and I'm going to close with this, but I want you to ponder it very, very deeply. One of the hardest things for us as humans, I think one of the things that hinder us most is to acknowledge who we are. &gt;&gt; If I ask you who who are you, you'll say, well, I'm so and so. And is that your name? Yes. What is your birth date? They ask me my birth date all the time. Sometimes I think they don't think I can remember it or what. So I give them my birth date and we identify ourselves and we're citizens of a certain country and we live at a certain place. Listen to me folks. want your full attention now for the next 101 15 minutes and I'm done. That is this world. That is this life. We need we need desperately to become not disassociated with it but spiritually disconnected. And we need to be spiritually so connected. Other people said of Jesus, "Well, he lived in Nazareth, so he was called the Nazarene." That's fine. That's what he said. Whatever they want to say, that's fine. But as far as he was concerned, I came from God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't know me and you don't know my father. &gt;&gt; If you'd known what Moses said, you'd know me because he spoke of me. He was he was dealing in terms that left them absolutely astounded all the time. They couldn't figure out who do you think you are? &gt;&gt; I'm looking at you. &gt;&gt; One of our greatest difficulties is to live in this world as though we don't belong. Mhm. &gt;&gt; We become so consumed with the fact and they have a nice phrase in the world, you become so heavenly good, you're no earthly heavenly minded, you're no earthly good. No, no, that's not right. If you come become so heavenly minded, you will be earthly good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, now I'm saying it. Jesus knew who he was. And so right away you say, "Oh yeah, well that's fine for Jesus." No, no, no. And Brother Brandham knew who he was. And I've always marveled. He'd come out on the platform. I've wondered if I would have enough courage for that. &gt;&gt; Come out on the platform and say, "Now I'm just your brother. That's mortal. I'm just helpless. I'm as helpless as can be. That's mortal. And if he comes, I don't know. But if he comes, his confidence went beyond human reach. &gt;&gt; It transcended all sanity. &gt;&gt; I I knew what I said. It transcended all sanity because for a man just to put up his finger and say he's here. &gt;&gt; Oh, who's here? &gt;&gt; Oh, someone from the unseen world is here. But it wasn't unseen to him. He knew he was here. &gt;&gt; And whatever he said, that's what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; And regardless of how absurd or how ridiculous or how far it went back in the person's life or what happened to them, I don't know if you're a Christian. I don't know what I don't know what the situation is, but he was going to speak it. WHAT IS HE SAYING? I WILL GO. I WILL SAY IT &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE. I WILL SAY IT. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, &gt;&gt; UNDER THAT INSPIRATION, HE TOLD you who you are. &gt;&gt; IT WAS NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM TELLING THEM PEOPLE. IT WAS ETERNITY COMING DOWN AND GOD WHO'S OMNIPRESENT TELLING THEM this is what happened to this girl when you fell down. You're about 8 years old and you fell down a well and you loosed all your all your organs. Who said that? &gt;&gt; ONLY GOD COULD SAY THAT. &gt;&gt; WHO could turn things around? &gt;&gt; Even in my own experience and I I was explain studying this subject. I was explaining to brother Tom. I said, "Listen, God knows who knows exactly maybe through the test and everything about a certain being and he'll say, uh, this certain person, you've had the training." IT WAS GOD THAT EVEN ALLOWED THEM TO GO THROUGH college and university and years and years and years of study because God in his mind saying, "Someday I'm going to lay my finger on you and you're going to make a phone call and you're going to do certain things and you're going to call certain colleagues and I'll use your influence. I put you in this place. I put you IN THIS HOSPITAL. I PUT YOU with these medical PEOPLE FOR WHAT PURPOSE? FOR ONE PURPOSE. YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE MY PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE AN ETERNAL PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Do you folks believe that? &gt;&gt; I want to ask this congregation, do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And God had you here in this service TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE SO THE ETERNAL SPIRIT OF GOD COULD SPEAK TO YOU WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; One of the hardest things, and I'm having just a little bit of difficulty even now because one of the hardest things is to say I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; Somebody that I admire very, very much is brother Ron Spencer's father. You don't know him well. I know him quite well. He's a different kind of a man. He's not a very visible man. He's a pastor. I've never preached in his church. I've tried to put myself in his place. His son had just fell from the fourth story of a construction site onto the concrete and his body was all busted up and he laid in hospital emergency and brother Ron Spencer's dad drove to the hospital. This is what I'm talking about tonight, friends, this morning. And he talks to the doctor and doctors today, you know, they want to be very upfront. And he said, "I want you to know, Mr. Spencer, your son will never walk again." He's not rushing in to see how the how the boy is. He says to the doctor with all due respect, and he was not being disrespectful, he said, "Sir, you just don't know who you're talking to." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And he walks into his son &gt;&gt; laying there on the bed. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say how many bones are broken or what. All all broken all up. He said, "Son, you are my son, &gt;&gt; and I'm a son of God, &gt;&gt; and you and I are gonna walk out of this hospital." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what they did. &gt;&gt; And brother Ron Spencer went to work on Sunday on Monday morning. &gt;&gt; I say, friends, that's when a man meets eternity &gt;&gt; and he COMES TO THE REALIZATION, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S been through. And if I just tried that in our own effort, it won't work. &gt;&gt; But when God does something, he wants a response inside. I will do that. &gt;&gt; I will believe that. &gt;&gt; And to be faithful. IF YOU'RE DOUBTING, IT'LL NEVER WORK. &gt;&gt; Never work. &gt;&gt; I say, "Oh God, help thou my unbelief. &gt;&gt; Help me to have faith. Strengthen our faith." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; LET THIS CONGREGATION SAY, "STRENGTHEN OUR FAITH, oh God. Not just that we'll SEE MORE MIRACLES. THAT'S NOT IT. That I'll walk like a son of God. &gt;&gt; I'll live like a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Who can know what God's program is? &gt;&gt; Even you here, he may have you work at a certain job. He may have you be in a certain place forever so long. &gt;&gt; You wonder what's going on. Don't worry. My God had no beginning and he had no end. &gt;&gt; If I'm here for 50, 60 years and I do one thing that he'll get glory. &gt;&gt; I say all glory to him. &gt;&gt; That's what I WANT THIS CONGREGATION TO GET. GLORY to God. &gt;&gt; We don't want people healed so they're free from pain. We don't want people healed because they'll fill a place in our heart. We want people healed so they'll give glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't know why things happen. &gt;&gt; Things that happen maybe are so &gt;&gt; earthshattering, traumatic to us. &gt;&gt; But we don't know what God's plan is. &gt;&gt; I was in this city when I heard that brother Brandham was in an accident. Well, it didn't even enter my cross my mind, brother Tom. Never even crossed my mind. Well, he'll just raise up because we're going to the next meetings. Where, you know, who are we thinking of? Me. &gt;&gt; Selfie. &gt;&gt; Selfie was only invented in this time, but it was way back then. &gt;&gt; He can't go. I I got to hear him. I want to hear the next service. There are thousands of other people thinking the same thing. All right. &gt;&gt; God knew &gt;&gt; this message &gt;&gt; and this messenger &gt;&gt; that had intercepted intercepted time with a special message FOR A GROUP OF people that have got to hear it. &gt;&gt; And God knew what he was going to do as a result of it. And then people became gripped with it. And this word has to go out. And this MESSAGE HAS TO GO OUT. There's somebody that's waiting for it. There's somebody in Ethiopia that was waiting for it, wasn't there, brother Tim? They were waiting for it until brother Bus a few days later is going to leave them about 13 that have been baptized. Are are you now going to leave us? And the prophet said, "Could they go back to the old form of synagogues?" No, they could not go back. &gt;&gt; So what are we going to do? Well, we do whatever we need to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever's necessary. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on children, &gt;&gt; be men of faith. Whatever is necessary, that will we do. Speak Lord and I will answer. AND YOU SAY THAT, SPEAK LORD. And he may be changing. He may be saying TO YOU, YOUR NATURE needs to change. YOU SAY, I AGREE. OH GOD, CHANGE MY NATURE. &gt;&gt; MAKE ME A STALWARD BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; Remove all this wishy-washy out of me. remove all this up and down out of me. Make me a son of God. &gt;&gt; Develop in me what you need. &gt;&gt; So with this I'm closing now. I'm sorry. So John's gospel it's very different in in my commission. Now I'm going to close with these words. in a in a few minutes. And brother Benam is saying, "And when he came," speaking of the angel, "and he told me this time he looked, it was a man. When I told him that I was afraid people wouldn't believe me, he said I'd be given two signs as the prophet Moses was given to vindicate or to other in other words to make plain to you to make plain to you people or to any people that I'm telling the truth. &gt;&gt; We're part of those people. &gt;&gt; Yes. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe that an angel from God, hear me? &gt;&gt; Hear me folks. An angel from God is coming on orders from God say, "This will be given to make you and other people to believe you that you're telling the truth and make it plain to them." He says, 'Now the man can say anything. Now man, he said, can say anything, &gt;&gt; but if God doesn't speak back that that's true, &gt;&gt; then it isn't true. &gt;&gt; Isn't that clear? &gt;&gt; If God doesn't speak back, then it isn't true. But if God testifies that that is truth, then I would be believe it. If God said so, I would believe it. Now, I want you to believe that it's true. &gt;&gt; God couldn't speak any louder. &gt;&gt; God couldn't say it more ways. &gt;&gt; Hear me. Look at me. God was speaking. And God has told this generation that which he spoke is true. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he told me, he said, "I would I would know diseases by taking hold of a person's hand first, and if I'd be reverent and go on, it would come to pass at a certain time that I would be able to know the things that people done in their back life." Amen. &gt;&gt; And be able to tell them what would be before them. And then listen, I've highlighted this. And then while I studied a moment, he referred me to the scriptures &gt;&gt; that I many times do about Jesus of Nazareth, knowing that he was misunderstood &gt;&gt; and let me know that I would be misunderstood. And he goes on in this same service of my commission and he speaks of Nathaniel. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's just where this angel referred to." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then he speaks of the woman at the well. They're not in Matthew, Mark, or Luke. They're all in John. &gt;&gt; Nathaniel is in John. The woman at the well is in John. And then from there, he goes right on to Lazarus. And Lazarus is in John. He said, "This angel referred me to several scriptures, some scriptures that I often use." Those are the scriptures that he often uses. And I want to say WITHOUT ANY APOLOGY, IT WORKS. &gt;&gt; IT WORKS. &gt;&gt; THE SAME God &gt;&gt; that spoke to the woman at THE WELL. &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD that raised Lazarus from the dead. THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD NATHANIEL, "I SAW YOU SITTING UNDER THE TREE." THAT SAME GOD GAVE THIS MESSAGE TO US. &gt;&gt; THAT SAME GOD, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, said to me, you have three questions on your heart. &gt;&gt; And he named all THREE QUESTIONS. THAT'S THE SAME GOD. And that is when I realized, I MET ETERNITY. Brother Tim, brother John, we met eternity. &gt;&gt; This is a different kind of ministry that we have. We're ministering to eternal creatures. ETERNITY IS SWALLOWING UP TIME, FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart and I'm so glad &gt;&gt; to be accompanied with you. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, our father, &gt;&gt; what a kind father you are. &gt;&gt; Yes, you've provided food for our natural life, but that doesn't mean much compared to the food that we receive spiritually. I pray that the people will there's people in other churches all throughout the land that call this a sermon. And if we tend to think of it as a sermon, I pray that you'll remove that from our thoughts and let people know and let there be a a confession on their lips. I've heard from God. God by his Holy Spirit spoke to me this morning and what he said I will do. I'm prepared. I I desire to do everything that I can for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; I pray that you will bless, Father, this congregation. &gt;&gt; Bless all that we seek to do for the kingdom of God. Bless in the service this evening. Father, I pray in Jesus Christ's name as we each dedicate ourselves to you for your glory for the furtherance of your kingdom. Lord, we want to be faithful till the last moment and then we'll drop our implement and be changed. Thank you, Father. Brother Matthew Redell has requested prayer and earth going down to be with brother Puit and a meetings the youth camp and they're interested in what has been happening with the witnessing and several of you that have been witnessing of desire to go. I believe brother Jonathan Frey if you'd come brother Michael Daz is it is it Michael are you coming if you'd just come and stand here and we're going to have prayer with you and one more is a third one pardon all right fine fine thank you and we're just going to have prayer together for going to pray that God will prosper the way and that you'll realize after this morning's service. God is a God of eternity. He's only interested in eternal things. That's what we're here commissioned to do. And it's our Lord Jesus Christ who said, "You shall be witnesses." This is the greatest thing that a person can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is to present someone else maybe with an opportunity. &gt;&gt; We will pray together. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; we join hearts attribute to attribute. We ask, oh God, the same God that has dealt and dealt in the hearts of this young man, dealt in the hearts of our brother Matthew has given him burden. Oh God, has spent endless hours, Father, desiring to put groups together, oh God, and to share a burden with them. We pray, Father, that there be a flame of fire. May a flame of the Holy Spirit go before them, oh pillar of fire go with them, I pray, and not only give safe journey, but we pray that when their feet arrive on the site, that every desire that our brother Tim Prud has had in his heart, bring it to fruition, oh God. And may these brothers indeed be willing, oh God. And let them be and let them be ready, oh Father, to obey and be obedient to your voice, &gt;&gt; and your calling, oh God. I pray that you will unite them. Let them be in one spirit, in one mind. Pray, oh God, you'll bless the meetings there. Pray oh God that you move upon the hearts of many and those that you have ordained to speak. Oh God may they speak fearlessly. It's been where our brother John Andy's has been in the past. Pray oh God the mighty Holy Spirit. Let them take that more than just a youth meeting. &gt;&gt; Let them take it as an opportunity. Oh God. &gt;&gt; This may be their last gathering. Who knows? &gt;&gt; But your will be done. Lord, we dedicate these brothers and we dedicate ourselves to you and I dedicate myself. Oh God, &gt;&gt; we say thy will be done. Lord, &gt;&gt; we say thy glory. Thy name receive all the glory. All the glory, &gt;&gt; we shall glorify your name. Lord, &gt;&gt; oh father, &gt;&gt; in Jesus name, we dedicate ourselves. May the congregation all stand please as we dedicate ourselves to God &gt;&gt; in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I pray as we give ourselves to you &gt;&gt; at this time, Lord, &gt;&gt; my heart has been burdened for some that are here in this building. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let them break out of the shell.
