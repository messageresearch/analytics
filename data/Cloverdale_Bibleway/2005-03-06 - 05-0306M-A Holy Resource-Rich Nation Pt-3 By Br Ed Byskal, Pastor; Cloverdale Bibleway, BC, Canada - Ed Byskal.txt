Couple of prayer requests. We want to remember Dorine. First, apparently she is Sister Sylvia Messages older sister and she she's in Honduras. She's asking prayer for um I guess their bookkeeper, their nephew was kidnapped and uh they're just asking that the Lord would release this young man. His name is Arnold. They want to they thank you very much for their prayers and also we want to uh remember brother Ernie Beva as he said brother JT Padet's church today couple of testimonies uh from sister from sister Victoria Adomora may the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we've glorified for his unfailing guidance provision and protection may He may he be blessed for his lovely sons and daughters who have used who he has used to bless me and my family. She says God bless you all. Amen. Sister Camela Camela has a prayer has a testimony. She wants to thank the Lord for helping her go through the worst of a bad case of flu. Brother DDA prayed for her. She's asking that we continue to pray for her that she would be continually made whole. Brother Hugh message just a quick word here. just wish he wants to thank the saints for prayer Wednesday evening. The Lord touched his body and he was fully restored to health and was able to go back to work on Thursday. Our sister Antuinette from Victoria just has a little note just grateful to the Lord Christ for all he has done particularly. She has uh helped her through school and helped her get a job after, but apparently she's not able to get all Sundays off. And when she can get the Sundays off, the devil comes and attacks her. She just wants to say thanks to be our Lord Jesus. We made it today. She just asking that we continue to remember her in prayer that she'd be able to continue making the services. Sister Mina, last Monday, she fell from a two to three foot lad step ladder flat on her back. She wants to thank the Lord that nothing seriously happened, but please pray for her that the Lord would continue to heal her all the way. So, we want to thank the Lord for these little little things that he's done. If you've got a need on your heart, just raise your hand as we go to prayer. If you're on the internet or on the telephone hookup, just count Brother Kim. Praise the Lord. This morning, I just want to take a moment to uh express my appreciation for the internet hookup and those that are involved with that. You know, I know what it's like to be involved sometimes in a church project and you're working with wires and you're working with computers and all those things and and it can be a lot of work and a lot of thankless work, but from the bottom of my heart, I want to express to everybody that's involved in the internet work and getting that out what a tremendous blessing. There's but there's been times I've been in a room full of people that are just worshiping and and and and receiving from God. And I'd like to be able to turn it around so that those that are doing it could see what an effect it's having on the outside. So I just pray God it be with you those that are involved with that and just I just want to appreciate just express my appreciation for that this morning. Let's bow our heads in prayer this morning. Kind heavenly father, we bow our hearts before you this morning, Lord. Lord, and we sang that song this morning when he reached down his hand for me. Lord, and we're just so thankful, Lord, that you continue to reach down your hand, Lord. Father, that you didn't only reach down your hand for me that 25 years ago, Lord, but you continually reach down for me, Lord Jesus. Father, and I stand in your presence this morning with your saints, Lord. And I want to thank you for your grace and for your mercy, Lord. Lord, and I want to take just a moment this morning to tell you how much I appreciate you, Lord. I love you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for your cleansing power. &gt;&gt; Lord, I just so thank you for the things that we see you doing in our lives and moving among us, Lord, and healing our sick and saving our children, Lord Jesus.

We trust you feel at home in his presence. Amen. Our sister Linda has a special for us as she gets ready. I just like to sing a little course just across the bridge. There'll be no sorrow. Number 286. Just across the bridge, there'll be no sorrow. Just across the bridge, there'll be no pain, God. Let your shine across the river and we'll never be unhappy again. Let's sing one more time. Oh, just across the bridge there sorrow. across the grave. There'll be no God will shine [Music] across the river and will never be unhappy again.

[Music] And though I can't see your holy face or hear the songs of angels around your heavenly throne. I'm not ashamed to speak your lovely name and to tell of your goodness and your great love for me, Lord. Lord, I believe in you. I'll always believe in you. Though I can see you with my eyes, deep in my heart, your presence I find. Lord, I believe.

I will bless his holy name. is here. [Music] Your name is touching. You will never be the same. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So happy to see everyone. Another beautiful day. See the springtime speaks of resurrection. See the blossoms coming out on the trees. Some of the uh plum blossoms were blossoming this morning and speaks of life. We're not here because of some death as much as we're here because of life. Say, well, Jesus died, but the great thing is he rose again. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he proved who he was when he rose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we're here today because he has already proven who he is. Amen. Well, just a very very maybe three four weeks ago, I spoke of uh uh Sister Esther Shackleford here in the church. And this last week, she went into the presence of the Lord. I I thought a great deal. I've thought about her a lot uh this last week. And uh this is how I envisioned her in my mind. And perhaps you will get some picture of the of the sister. She was as a grand old ship, her masts proudly standing against the sky. anchored, steady, gently responding to the breezes, storms from time to time, but this grand old ship had seen it all before. Then the anchor was lifted and Sister Esther silently sailed off into the eternal haven of rest. And she certainly was that grand old ship. Year after year after year, you could just look in that direction and you know she'd be exactly the same. She was a large woman, but she would get her niece to drive. They would drive for hours from uh Lima all the way down to Murphy'sboro or other meetings. And uh at the ministry of the word, if you sit down and speak with her, her eyes would just flash with life. just glisten and sparkle. And oh, how I love to hear her sing. She had such a lovely voice. Just deep, rich voice. And even as well as I love to hear her sing and I think that she had a great love for my wife and I, uh, the last few years we couldn't convince her to sing. But I believe that angels are sitting back because none of them have a voice like she has. And uh probably hearing something new and fresh. Our sister Esther Shackleford, if you would this morning, I'd like you to remember her family. Uh Sister Faith Stoddard is her sister. And Sister Faith Stoddard was the penist at Bible believers uh in Limo, Ohio, where brother Isaiah Brooks is pastor now. And she was penis there for many, many years. And she played and Sister Tammy Laroo's sister played the organ. And so they're very, very close, especially to Sister Tammy has known her ever since. uh known sister Esther and Sister Faith ever since she was just a child. And then Sister Violet Brennan uh she is also sister and uh Sister Diana Kay is a niece and they've always been they've been very very close to ourselves personally and to the work and especially to Bible believers. Sister Esther Shackleford. And I sent I sent a note to brother Jeff Jenkins because he and uh brother I believe Ray Ericson took the memorial service yesterday. But Sister Esther Shackleford as soon as she heard that the message had reached into China, she was uh I would say the first person to speak to me about that work. And they had already been giving to a real good what they felt was a real good solid uh gospel minister who was did not know the message. The message hadn't reached him but they just wanted to reach the people of India with the gospel of Jesus Christ and they were already giving and supporting that work there. So it was not so much that sister Esther had such a burden for India but it was her love for the word. It was it was something that just spoke to your heart when you begin to speak to them speak to them about the scripture and they would stay after service just as long as you talk to them and preach to them after service. They just sit there and pull it out of you. It's just really really nice. And so, God bless the family and we'll certainly be remembering them. Amen. Well, uh, we've come here to hear the word and be ministered to. And let's pray that God will do everything that he has in mind to do in this service. Amen. I wonder if we could stand and uh I'd like to sing again. Uh, hear the cry of the shackled. Is that it? Yeah. It's 21 2119. So, you have it. I just love this song. Let's sing it as we getting ready to approach the word now. Hear the cry of the shackles of time. on his feet. [Music] See the tears of the broken, the cry of the slaves. [Music] No one set us free. Then the crying is still. The chorus rings out. The shackles leave from their chain. And the thousands of voices dwell in the song. Worthy where that was slain, worthy, worthy, worthy. The lamb that was slain. He's worthy. [Music] So worthy, [Music] worthy. The lamb that was slain. Then all the archangels, all the archangels, the saints of all time, holding their crowns in their hands. [Applause] Fall down before him joining the song. Worthy, worthy the lamb. Let's just worship him now. Worthy, [Music] worthy, worthy. [Music] That was worthy. So worthy. Worthy. So worthy, oh Lord. So worthy. [Music] You are indeed so worthy. Our hearts are filled, swelled to overflowing with praise and worship and honor. &gt;&gt; There is none other God &gt;&gt; to whom this honor is due. &gt;&gt; We owe you everything. We owe you all that we are, all that we ever can be. We lay our lives at your feet. We want to say today, lovely Lord Jesus, as we heard brother Kim Kim Dingwal express his love and appreciation to you, Lord, touch my heart. And I pray, Father, that each person, whatever state they are in as of this moment, they may look up into that lovely face of the resurrected Christ and recognize in their confession that when you were on the cross, we were on your mind. And there the shackles were broken. There the bodies were healed. &gt;&gt; There Satan and sin was defeated &gt;&gt; and we stand gloriously free this morning. Oh, glory to the lamb. Glory to the lamb of God. Thank you, Father, for the sacrifice. I pray that now you'll allow the Holy Spirit to move amongst us. And may that pillar of fire, oh God, I pray, be present. And may we sense the nearness, not only around us, but in us and through us. Permeate us, penetrate us, oh God. Move us. I pray that you'll move upon my being today, Lord, and thoughts. Cause my mouth to speak your words. Seal it, I pray, with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I pray that the seed will find good ground in the name of Jesus Christ. We depend upon your anointing now and humbly seek your grace and blessings in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles, turn with me to First Corinthians 2 and 12. Just reading that one verse and then I will read out of second Peter the first chapter 1 Corinthians 2:12 12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God. We have received the spirit of God that we might know the things that are freely given us of God. In second Peter, I'm going to read from verse one uh of the first chapter. Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. I would like each of us to read together in unison that verse three. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. And now please just back to Ephesians the first chapter. I often go to this verse in uh Peter. I often go to this verse, this third verse that we read in unison because each of us have times in our lives in fact is they come quite frequently I suppose when we have questions and the questions are not necessarily answered sufficiently or satisfactoryy to our our own uh curiosity about spiritual things and I always go to this because I say he has given us all things that pertain to life and a lot of the things we want to find out about doesn't really pertain to our you know it's not critical to our spiritual life but we'd like to know and if God doesn't tell you that's a good question to ask yourself is it really critical to my spiritual life you know is it coming on a cloud is it coming on a horse is he coming to you know what happens and a lot of those things, you know, we don't have to know. That's why are you going to establish the kingdom now? Says, it's not for you to know, you know, just they they wanted to find out and they had to write. They had to write that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not for you to know. That'd be good for us to do sometime. All right. In Ephesians 1, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ. God bless his word to our heart. You may be seated. I appreciate your prayers. Brother Tony has arrived home and he certainly appreciate your prayers and I would say has labored very very hard. I got a final report uh while he was on his way back and uh has done an enormous enormous amount of work and we're looking forward to and the ministry and the saints in Brazil are looking forward to being able to move forward and see the message expanded and multiplied in their country. Now, we've read from Ephesians. And this book of Ephesians, brother Brandham says, is the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; It's the book of Joshua of the New Testament. He said it's dividing up and setting in order the overcome ones. in adoption. He said the book of Ephesians is a book of Joshua and Joshua placing the people where they belong. Ephesians is intended to place you where you belong. &gt;&gt; And that's very important. He said God's wanting to place his church sons, daughters of God. God let me live. He said to see it is my prayer. So close till I can just feel it with my hands almost. That's how he was feeling it because there's a he could see the potential and the word coming to place the people. He said, "It's right here. It's right there. And that's what I've longed to see, waiting for the time when you walk down the street. There lays a laying there from his mother's womb. Silver and gold have I none. Oh, he said, waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. Hallelujah. When God will make itself known, when they'll stop sickness, they'll stop cancer, they'll stop diseases. We speak of diseases may not just be physical diseases. Ephesians is God's given land &gt;&gt; to us as believers. It's God's given land or the place that he has ordained that we should live and enjoy the fullness of it. Ephesians and I'm saying all of this because we're going to go through a good part of it very very uh carefully. I've been speaking on last two services on the holy resourcerich nation. I felt very very directed. I thought I would be through and finished with this, but actually this morning it's larger today than it ever has been since I even started contemplating it. Uh God has something for us and we want to uh sit here with a open heart and a resolve. I'm going to receive what God has for me. I'm going to go out of this building with something that I didn't have when I came in. &gt;&gt; That's God's program for us. I can tell you, I can feel it within myself. Now one of the resources which we have as believers is faith. The Bible speaks of those believers who were rich in faith and there is a wealth of faith but faith needs to be exercised. faith needs to be uh worked in the law of its of of of uh the law of faith which the prophet said that law faith and love are the same thing. &gt;&gt; So you can't really have faith unless a person has the kind of love that God's talking about. For God is love. &gt;&gt; And so they work together, faith and love. And there is a law of love. Now Jesus said to some that he was speaking to in Matthew 21. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree," which he' cursed the fig tree. But if you shall say to this mountain, "Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea," it shall be done. Have faith and don't doubt. Now, doubt maybe isn't unbelief in the pure sense of the word, but doubt will lead you to unbelief. &gt;&gt; So, don't doubt. And so, I want to be specific about a certain aspect of faith and a certain aspect of doubt. And that one, I'm going to just narrow it down because faith covers everything that there is in our spiritual life. You know, we could take faith and speak on it for years and wouldn't even scratch the surface. But I want to bring it down to one very very significant aspect and it's it it's significant to every person and it's this. We certainly don't doubt that Jesus Christ came into the world, that he was who he said he was. We do not doubt. I don't believe there's a doubt in a single person's mind here that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. I don't believe anyone doubts that he was the son of God, born of the virgin. And we do not doubt, don't even have a trace of doubt that he died, suffered, and died and was buried &gt;&gt; and raised the third day. &gt;&gt; We believe that. I believe anyone from the youngest to the eldest in this uh sanctuary and wherever my voice is going today streaming. I believe that people would believe that. Any believer would believe that. And so we believe who he is. We don't have any doubt. We haven't got the least doubt that he is what he says that he is. And we're are we are not afraid to confess that. We're not afraid to confess everything he said he was. &gt;&gt; We're ready to say that. However, I am just I've been pondering very very deeply how effective his sacrifice and his victory at Calvary will be if we do not exercise the same degree of faith and confession in what he said we were &gt;&gt; as a result of his death. If we do not walk in what he said we were, if we don't confess and that's where we go quiet &gt;&gt; because then I have to say that we have some doubts &gt;&gt; and those doubts will lead to unbelief &gt;&gt; and unbelief will cause the word to be impotent and we will not receive what we are supposed to receive. That's just exactly the way that it will go. Confess what he said about you. &gt;&gt; In the message Christ, which was preached in Phoenix, an early message, brother Brandon makes a statement out of the scripture, let the mind that was in Christ be in you. Think his way of thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say what he says. Confession means to say the same thing. It'll be important that you remember that statement to say the same thing because actually brother Brandham is actually reaching into the into the Greek and I don't know if I can get to it this morning but it but it it has a reference further on in the message to repeat and to say the same thing that he said. And I think that we need to mean it when we say it. Confess is to confess the same thing. Say the same thing. I'm not repeating what he said. He's repeating it. I'm reading the whole thing. I'll start it again. Confession means to say the same thing. Confess is to confess the same thing. Say the same thing. He says, then don't confess your own mental conception. &gt;&gt; Oh, this mind is so weak. &gt;&gt; It is so weak. And Satan sws so many thoughts. Your mind even this morning at this minute is is active and flashing with all kinds of thoughts. But you want to deny any thought that is not in harmony with the word of God. Deny it &gt;&gt; and confess what he said. &gt;&gt; Say shall I confess it if I don't s say see it? I would confess it till you do say it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. be born again and confess his word. Confess what he said. That's confession. If you were sick, then you say, "By his stripes, I'm healed." And you have a right, he said, to his wounds. &gt;&gt; Ain't that a beautiful statement? This morning, every sick person under the sound of my voice has a right to his wounds. You have a right to his wounds. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Worthy is the lamb that was slain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let the sick say, "I have a right to his wounds." &gt;&gt; Right now, you have a right to salvation. I have a right for the Holy Spirit. Anyone without the Holy Spirit, you want to confess, I have a right to the Holy Spirit. I have a right to salvation. The one that's not born again, I have a right. If God is speaking to you, if the Holy Spirit is moving upon you, you have a right to salvation. He promised it to me. said, "It's in you and your children and them that are a far off and as many as the Lord our God shall call." He said another scripture, "It is I be not afraid." So we pray for the sick. We do not heal the sick. I've seen tens of thousands of cases healed, definitely healed. four with records of rising from the dead in our own little ministry. But I have never healed anyone yet. It's your faith in a finished work that Christ did at Calvary. He was wounded for our transgressions and by his stripes we were healed. And now it's your faith in that finished work that does the work. And that's the way it is. You confess it. He's the high priest of the of our confession. He cannot do anything until you first profess that you accept &gt;&gt; and you confess what he said. &gt;&gt; You immobilize Christ if you don't confess it. &gt;&gt; And confess it in reality, not just some uh words coming out of a person's mouth, but you confess it because it's something rising up within you. even though you don't see it, you should just become blinded to the to the actual event that might be before you and and then confess what he said and you confess it and that is when you believe it and then he becomes the he's the high priest to make intercessions upon our confession. Now if we hesitate, if we hesitate, it indicates we have a question, we have a little doubt. If we hesitate, I'm speaking now specifically on your confession of what he has said about us about you as an individual if you hesitate. So I have used this example before. We will say Jesus Christ is a masterpiece, great masterpiece of God. And we'd say amen. I believe that we say the bride of Jesus Christ, she's a spotless pure virgin bride of Jesus Christ. She's a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Now we bring it down. Well, if she's a masterpiece, then each member must be a masterpiece because if if if there's a flaw in any member, then she can't be the masterpiece. And so now we have to bring it down to an individual saying, "I am a masterpiece." And that's where quite often the congregation gets a little quieter because we can say it on the big, you know, the big scene and we can make that kind of a claim for the the the whole universal bride, but then when we want to bring it down to the individual and so there should not be any hesitation. uh the service this morning I want and I'm praying earnestly that will be instruction and inspiration to you to develop the resources that are here in the word of God and especially in your land called the Ephesians. The land is both the fullness of the promise for your life. The land, that's what the land is, is both the fullness of the promise for you, your life in the Holy Ghost and also your physical body that is ordained to manifest that life. That's what the land comprises of. The land comprises, as the prophet says, of your life in the Holy Ghost. It's yours. You should you should uh and I'm saying to you, you should not only should but you must make that declaration, make that confession so that God moves on that. Then my life is my land and my land. &gt;&gt; It's my property. &gt;&gt; It's my life &gt;&gt; in the Holy Ghost. That's my land &gt;&gt; and I claim it. &gt;&gt; How much of it? Every every inch &gt;&gt; right from border to border. I claim that whatever God said is mine is mine. I will confess that. I don't care what my eyes mortal eyes see or what my mortal body feels. And I bring my body into subjection to that word. &gt;&gt; I bring my mouth into subjection. I bring my thoughts into subjection to think those thoughts and my mouth to say those words. and then and then my high priest can move in intercession to God on my behalf. And then that's the only way that faith operates. &gt;&gt; There's one quote I want to bring up for you. it come up. Maybe you can bring it up then. Don't seem to be getting it here. I want you to slowly read this. Before a word, it's a thought. And a thought has to be created. &gt;&gt; I've ministered on that. A thought. Now, I want you to think this is God. God's thoughts. And and and before we even came into being, God thought, we say, "Well, God thought of us." But not just some, you know, uh, piece of clay and the chemistry of your body, but God created in his mind a thought &gt;&gt; that would encompass what you are. Everything about you, even how you came down through the lineage to be what you are to be born where you were born and to be have certain unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies and a certain personality and certain characteristics. God knew all of that. And some of us are quiet and some are perhaps boisterous and some are silent and others are uh uh you know just a stream of conversation and and uh whatever more. Some are talented, some are musical, some haven't got a twitch in them. Some are artistic, others are not. Some like our sister Sally Dodd can go off and and give all kinds of poultry and so on and get so inspired and others are just flat don't have it. God made us what we are &gt;&gt; for his own glory. &gt;&gt; He intended us to be what he made us to be. &gt;&gt; You believe that? And so he put it together. You need to say, "I'm not just a thought, but God created this thought." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so God's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word. And that's when he presents it to you as a thought. He presents it to you. The word was presented to you. One day you came across and you heard somebody speak or a message came your way and you and the word was presented to you as a thought, his thoughts. &gt;&gt; And it was revealed to you. Now you it's even been revealed to you &gt;&gt; after the revelation. Oh, I have such a revelation. He said, then it's still a thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until until you speak it. &gt;&gt; That's how important confession is. &gt;&gt; There are, I believe, many in the message that I've had a real revelation. And I don't doubt they had a revelation, but they're they don't speak &gt;&gt; that revelation on a personal level. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I had a revelation of what I am. We never talked about the bride of Jesus Christ hardly at all until the message came. And then you hear of it all the time. The bride of Jesus Christ. We talk about the virgin spotless bride of Jesus Christ say you never did it in the first place. That was a a it must be a revelation to you that is so real that you can from your heart speak it &gt;&gt; and say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. say, "Well, I don't see it." That isn't what it says. &gt;&gt; Doesn't say when you see it, say it. &gt;&gt; Says when it's revealed to you, say it. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, speak the word. &gt;&gt; Speak what is in accordance and in harmony with this word. That's our only That's our only hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a great need to take possession of this land, this fullness of the promise. There's a great need amongst our own people right in this church and in any church I've ever been in, some greater than others. Perhaps a great need to develop these resources that God has placed in the church. And as I go through some of these resources, you're going to say, "Well, my I don't have that." That's not how you're going to get it by saying, "I don't have it." How you're going to get it is saying it is in the land. &gt;&gt; It is in the property. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, I haven't got much gold." It doesn't mean it's not in the land. God's put lots of it in the earth. Maybe we just don't have it. But lots of it is here and he has promised to supply our need according to his riches in glory. But these resources are are here that for the church and uh sufficient for our need. Now young men, the Bible says you're strong. You're strong. a young man or any man, but I I want to address a young man. You will not give answer to God and give an account to God because you have strength. You are born with whatever you have. One one is stronger than another. Everybody is is unique in their own way. You will never give an answer to God because you have a certain strength and that you got a strong body. But you will give an answer to God of how you used that strength &gt;&gt; and what you did with that strength. &gt;&gt; That's what you'll use. That's what you give an answer for. &gt;&gt; A young woman beautiful in the youth of your beauty of your youth. You won't give an answer to God be for your beauty or for what you are. You won't answer to God for that. But you will answer to God for how you used &gt;&gt; that beauty &gt;&gt; and what you did with it. Whether you gave honor to God with it or whether you dragged some innocent man or bystander into thoughts that he shouldn't have, that would be a illuse of what God gave you. &gt;&gt; You won't give an answer to God because deep laying within you is some talent to play some musical instrument. And perhaps you have uh have not even developed that yet. We've got children here that perhaps don't even have a uh a clue that they have something in them. And God has given people great gifts and great talents and abilities. You won't give an answer to God for the fact that he has given you that or that you were born with that or that's just the way the genes were put together. But you will certainly answer to God with how you used that gift and use that talent. You can use it for God. You can use it for the benefit of the bride of Jesus Christ. You can use it for the benefit of the gospel. Or you can use it for some ill use, some wrong use, some sinful use. As mature, we'll say those of us who've been on the way for a while and you go through life and you gain some wisdom. Hopefully, you gain some experience. We will not give an answer to God for the fact that we accumulated wisdom or experience. Anyone who lives gains some experience and they gain some knowledge from that experience. You won't give an answer to God and say, "Well, I gained a lot of knowledge. I gained a lot of experience." He'll say, "What did you do with it?" &gt;&gt; That's what we'll give an account to. You see, God speaks, I believe it was in the book of Ezekiel, and he and he begins to chastise the people because they took the gold. He said, "It was my gold and you took the silver." He said, "It's my silver and they took it." It wasn't it wasn't he wasn't chastising him because there was gold there or that the earth had silver and had wealth and riches and so on. He wasn't chastising him saying I give you I give you an earth that was wealthy. No, it was that they that they had developed it and had used it for an evil purpose &gt;&gt; and you took and made idols out of it. You see, the Bible tells us that Adam was given dominion over all the earth. He could have done anything with it. And along come Cain, a product of the serpent uh from the tree of knowledge. And you can see where it went. Starts with murder. &gt;&gt; Has that multiplied? &gt;&gt; Tragic. &gt;&gt; The world is filled with violence. But it started there with a seed. And then they began to work with iron and brass and all of these things. And and they had become very accomplished not very many years down the road. And they took all beginning to take the wealth and so on out of the earth and use it for all kinds of evil purposes. And our are our cities. Show me the city that is delightful and pure and holy and safe. Show me the city doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; And God's going to hold man accountable what he did with it. &gt;&gt; You took it out of the ground. You raped my earth. You stripped the land of its trees. You polluted the waters. You did all of these things. And look what you produced. showing that it's not of God. &gt;&gt; But behold, I make all things new. He said, &gt;&gt; I'll make a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwells &gt;&gt; righteousness. &gt;&gt; It'll be clean. It'll be pure. It'll be holy. &gt;&gt; And if you're if you're in love with this world, I let me announce to you, you'll be very uncomfortable in that one. &gt;&gt; You won't even get into that one if you love this one. He that loves this world is no friend of God. &gt;&gt; This is Satan's kingdom. This is Satan's world. And I say to the believers, let's not you utilize this this energy, these few days, this time as I spoke of the resource of time. You've only got so much time to live here. So many days, so many years, so many months. And we do not know how many. &gt;&gt; The last service when we had prayer for the family for an eight-year-old boy. 8-year-old boy. Who's here at 8 years old? Someone here at 8? Raise your hand. Who's eight? Look here. Why don't you stand up? Look at this little fell here. 8 years old. a boy like this playing soccer and and he was a very very fine well thought of young boy excelled in the things that he did and just felt a little tired who doesn't feel tired playing soccer went to his coach sat down on the bench and died right there family well known to her brother Sam Renie Renie Waldner there. Hey, you think he plans to go in a few minutes? Who knows? You're 14, you're 16, you're 20, you're strong, healthy. Tell you what, your breath's in the hands of God. &gt;&gt; You don't know whether you have the next five minutes. &gt;&gt; God's not going to hold you accountable that you have been given time. He's going to hold you accountable. What did you do with the time? I gave you a resource. I gave you a resource. Just think of people who have plotted their life all the way through life, lived maybe 60, 70 years or even more and live to themselves. Used all the energy just for themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a shame. &gt;&gt; You're looking heaven right in the face when you live for others. &gt;&gt; Every once in a while, I get a phone call and there's people I've known for years and all they can think of is themselves. Well, I want this and that didn't happen and the people didn't do this and something else and somebody did this to me and me and me and my and all the rest of it. I said, "Oh, for goodness sakes, why don't you grow up?" &gt;&gt; 40 years old and haven't grown up. Life is to live for others. What are you doing with your life? Live for someone else. Live first for Christ. Live for his people. And he will love you for it. That's what life's all about. That's what this church needs to be all about. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let you know as far as me and myself's concerned, this pulpit is concerned, and the vision of this church is concerned is to live for others. &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied that you have the message. We have the message. What about the next fellow, the next person, the next sister hasn't got anything in her hand. Oh God, we'll get the word to you. We'll do what we can because we only have x amount of time that you've allotted to us. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until you speak it, somebody here needs to be sang. I've lived enough for myself. I want to live for someone else. I'm going to find every moment that I can. Not necessarily just time, but I'm going to try to find every avenue, every channel that I can make myself available. That's the first thing. People come to me and say, "What can I do?" So, a lot of times there isn't something to do right then. But the first thing to do is make yourself available. I'm here. Call on me or even look. You know, there's all kinds of things to do. All right. Until you speak it. Here's what I consider a close to a perfect confession in the message. Concerned. Convinced. And concerned. Here's what the messenger is saying when he gets down towards the end of a service and he's he's got his back to the wall. He's got people that are sick and dying. He's got people that are demonpossessed. He's got people before him that are depending on him. They've come from miles. They've come across the ocean and they want now as a servant of God, he's on the spot to produce. Listen, this is this is where he needs to start. And he says, "I'm convinced that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever." That one statement, we might quote it, but there's not everybody that can live by it. If we're convinced he's the same yesterday, today, and forever, then what we're saying is if if we're if we would follow him today, it means we would follow him yesterday, and we'll follow him to the same degree today, and we'll do it tomorrow. So we'll say, "Oh Jesus, if I had only been here, I'd have loved you. I'd have followed you. I'd have been your disciple. What about now? &gt;&gt; I'd have been your disciple. I'd have forsaken all back then. But right about now, I'm so busy. I'm so tied up. I'm so going. I'm up to here. Well, it's time not to get up to here. It's time to It's time to change the standard of things. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. I wish you could hear his voice when he says this. I'm convinced in the ministry and the message I'm preaching. I I want to add today, I'm convinced in the message I'm preaching to you this morning. I'm convinced it's an answer to this congregation. It depends what you do with it, but I'm convinced it came from God. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm convinced that it's the truth. I'm convinced that these visions come from God. I'm convinced we're living in the last days. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that this very spirit that's on you now is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced. I'm impressed with the congregation before I came out and was still in prayer. I thought, I'm impressed with the young people of this congregation. &gt;&gt; I'm con Oh, people say, "Well, I find this, I find that." I tell you what, I'm impressed with the Holy Spirit upon the young people. I'm impressed with the young people in the school. I'm impressed with the teachers that teach them in such a godly fashion. I'm impressed with our with our deacons. I'm impressed with the trustees. I'm impressed with every person that I find I shake hands with. I find that spirit vibrating, a believer's spirit. What a privilege it is for me to walk with them. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is that we know one another. What a privilege. I'm impressed. I'd like to shown you the pictures of the brother in China right now that at they have this had this convention and they have demanded of them that they confiscate all the message books. They demanded that they confiscate all the women's skirts. &gt;&gt; They've demanded that they recant and withdraw from these things. Listen. And the people in China said we will not compromise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm impressed with these young believers. &gt;&gt; I'm impressed with them. I'm impressed with our brothers that translate. I'm impressed with everyone that works. I'm impressed with our brother Alex and how he keeps this church and the property in such a wonderful fine state. And uh I'm impressed with the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, brother Alex came with me to Venezuela and our interpreter wouldn't didn't show up. And I'm glad he didn't because our brother Alex stood beside me and preached alongside me. And as far as that nation still, they think he's one of my associate ministers. &gt;&gt; I said, "Praise God, he is. I'm impressed with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been in your homes and ate at your tables and see the standard that you hold before God. I'm impressed with it. I love you for it. And God loves you for it. And don't let the devil ever call cause you to downplay it. You say in the face of every evil, every doubting spirit, I will not doubt that. &gt;&gt; I am what God said I am. And that settles it. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to confess that &gt;&gt; so my high priest can confess it. &gt;&gt; You feel like a failure. That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You if you say in one breath, I believe in Christ. I believe you lived. I believe you're holy. &gt;&gt; I believe you're the spotless son of God. Then you have to say, I believe that you purchased me at Calvary. You paid the price and I am a sinless &gt;&gt; child of the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil hates it and that's why you need to say it. &gt;&gt; It's a perfect confession. He said, "I'm thoroughly convinced that the Holy Ghost is the right way. I'm convinced that the Bible way is the truth." He wasn't speaking of this church, but it sounds good anyway. I'm convinced that this is Jesus Christ here now. Are you convinced? Are you convinced that this is Jesus Christ here in this building now? &gt;&gt; Then God can do something for you. You confess it. You want to say the same thing. I'm convinced that this is not just a good feeling. I'm convinced this is not just my emotions. I'm convinced this is the Holy Ghost speaking the spirit of God to my soul telling me that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And you know it's the truth. &gt;&gt; This isn't some just some little preacher up here excited. I'm convinced it's Jesus Christ here now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced it's the same pillar of fire that burned in the burning bush and spoke God speaking through it to Moses. That's the same pillar of fire leading a people out. I'm convinced this is the third Exodus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced as it led them out of Egypt and into a promised land. This is leading us right into a rapture. And the same God &gt;&gt; is going to change the atoms of these bodies, &gt;&gt; we can we're we confess that. &gt;&gt; Just speaking the other day here in the church of the new heaven and new earth and just made a comment on it speaking how the heavens will be on fire and the elements thereof will melt with fervent heat. listen to me. While you sat here and didn't perhaps know anything about it, an Israeli scientist uh predicted and some of the people sent it to me, I appreciate that. Sent me uh his his not only his prediction, but he predicted there was going to be a giant uh flash of fire in the heavens, a burst. You know some now we have these sunbursts and changes our affects the radioactive and I should not radioactive but the radio waves and the gamma rays that uh come out flow out from this and there was a the there was a neutron star and there was a burst off this neutron star. They said it was December the 27th, one day after the tsunami uh disaster. And this burst of fire was so great. If you've ever any of you ever read of the power of our sun, it is beyond our imagination. Our mind can't grasp the strength of our sun. that one burst from that neutron star which was 50,000 light years out into space in the midst of our the midst of our galaxy. It said that it generated somewhere between what our sun could produce in 100 to 200,000 years in one flash. And they said had that been closer to the earth &gt;&gt; and they just hung it there. They just left it. They didn't say anything about it. Had it been closer to the earth. And even right now, they said that the the radio waves and so on is being affected by the effects of that here on earth. We're sitting here. We think, "Oh, well, the heavens be on fire." I tell you what, God could just send a little pee of power, just a little pea pod of power and would burn his heavens up. And our prophet said that he's going to burn the atmospheres because it holds Satan himself as the prince of the power of the air. &gt;&gt; I tell you, he will go up into a smoke of some kind. He'll disappear. &gt;&gt; And all the angels that fell with him and all the wicked who love his ways, you'll evaporate &gt;&gt; and hang before a righteous God. Man in his little insignificance wonders how God's going to do those things. I tell you what, who is God? We can't even begin to mention his name. We're not worthy to utter his name. &gt;&gt; That's who he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're not right with God, be right with God today. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced. I want to just continue with this confession that Brother Brandham made. I'm convinced the Holy Spirit that Jesus Christ is here and now. I'm convinced if we believe him at this minute, I'm convinced he'll heal every sick person. That's what he was convinced in a twinkling of an eye. I'm convinced he'll pour out the Holy Spirit up upon here till there be such a sh such a shout till hard to tell what would take place. I'm convinced. He said, "I believe it with all my heart, not because I'm an old man." Said, "I preached this when I was a kid, not not over 20 years old. And I'm convinced since that day he met me on the river." Hallelujah. Said, "I'm convinced that he's here now." &gt;&gt; Going back, it didn't mean whether it's 30 years ago or 20 years ago, he had he was convinced. It was the same one, the same voice, the same power. here to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; Oh, we must not let this undeveloped earth, that's this one here, we need to bring it into subjection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every person, I don't care what state you're in. I don't care what goes through your mind. It's time. It's time that we develop the resources that God has placed within us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "When I come to the earth, when the son of man returns, will he says he didn't say will I find churches? &gt;&gt; Will I find sincerity?" &gt;&gt; That isn't what he said. &gt;&gt; Will I find teachers? Will I find teaching the Bible? Will I find doing this? He said, "Will I find faith?" &gt;&gt; You got the power. You've got the power. &gt;&gt; You don't have to pray for power. You've got the power. He said, "You need faith &gt;&gt; potentially. Know where you are in Christ." Where you are in Christ. Then yield yourself potentially. So here this morning, I want to take you to that step. I want you to see potentially &gt;&gt; what you are in Christ &gt;&gt; potentially and then yield yourself to that &gt;&gt; as he spoke of of those that were physically sick. Put a fully healed person in front of you before you and take a step at a time and walk into that perfectly healed body &gt;&gt; because you're putting something before you. That's true. that's real and that God intended. &gt;&gt; And I think as a body of people, it doesn't doesn't do us any good to nibble at the heels of the church or nibble at the heels of the ministry or nibble at the heels of some other brother or sister. It doesn't do what are you going to do? You're not going to achieve anything. That's a devil's playground. But when a man or woman can look and say, "I'm convinced. I'm convinced that's a son of God. That's a daughter of God. I'm convinced in the bride of Jesus Christ. I'm convinced in the vision that God has given here even in the ministry. I'm convinced and I am here to build up even as even as uh perhaps I can only do a little bit, but I'm going to make sure my mouth says words of encouragement. I'm going to make sure my mouth establishes people. I'm going to let anybody know that talks to me that I love the body of Jesus Christ. Amen. And I see a glorious body without spot or wrinkle. And I walk with those that God has placed me amongst. And we walk towards that whole body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until we walk into it, until we depart this place. &gt;&gt; That's the program. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the program. And nothing else ever works. &gt;&gt; I've been preaching now 48 years. I've seen a lot of people I've seen a lot of people in the direction that they've gone and I tell this congregation before almighty God before this word laying here open before me before the message which we have received according to the prophet's message that's the thing that you do he said you you speak nice things &gt;&gt; of one another &gt;&gt; hallelujah praise Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have confidence in one another and build on those kind of resources in uh his seed shall possess the gate of the enemy. He says you just feel that sweetness of the spirit just moving over the audience. Somebody might say I don't feel it. You need to develop &gt;&gt; you need to develop a sense. You need to develop an awareness. Oh God, I sat there when I should have been. I should have been experienc I should have been sensing your spirit, your presence. I didn't sense it. Others did. Oh God, take me. Cause me &gt;&gt; to be developed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To develop that resource of this earth. And he said, he went on to say, now honestly before God, how many can really feel that Holy Spirit is close sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus? Move, sweet spirit of God. And I blend my voice with his voice here today. Move, sweet spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Do you know it's him? Amen. &gt;&gt; Young, old, married, unmarried, till you know it's him. &gt;&gt; Bound, backslider, whatever it is, away from God, whatever you are, that you may know it's him. I say move, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Call from death unto life. I'm convinced that there's power here now present by the living Christ to bring someone who is dead in trespasses and sins and cause them to be born again by the power of the resurrected Christ. &gt;&gt; We're in the resurrection business. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're in a resurrection business. My wife read me a quote this morning from some philosopher or something. He said, "We believe in resurrection." He says, "And the resurrection of the dead." He said, "Sometimes it's a lot harder to resurrect those that are living." &gt;&gt; That's what he found. But I say with the power of God dwelling in his church, we believe in the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Call from death unto life. Speak to the seed of Abraham. Give them faith. Let them know that that they let them know that they &gt;&gt; can possess the gate of every enemy. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; You believe that's your messenger. &gt;&gt; Let them believe. Let them have faith. They can believe. They can possess the gate of every enemy because every enemy has been put under the feet of Christ, even death. And we &gt;&gt; and I want you to say, "And I &gt;&gt; stand &gt;&gt; in him &gt;&gt; as a conqueror." &gt;&gt; Can you say that one? &gt;&gt; How about putting the drill rig down? Don't take up a sore a just a a cample a sore core sample. I'll get it right yet. Don't just take up a core sample and look at the core sample. Drill down and say, "I hit the motherload." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I found the main deposit. &gt;&gt; Glory to Quad. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good to see you, brother John. Sister Marie, glad you're here. &gt;&gt; It's a service we all need to be in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am &gt;&gt; a conqueror in Christ Jesus. So I failed him yesterday. Forget yesterday. Confess what you're hearing now. I'm a confessor of the promise of God. &gt;&gt; It can't come any other way. &gt;&gt; Develop the resource. You got it in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every enemy is under your feet as long as you are in Christ." Say, "Well, that's the problem. I'm not in Christ." Well, develop the resource today and get him here. Get her into Christ. &gt;&gt; How do I get into Christ? By confessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you've done wrong, confess it. &gt;&gt; If you've sinned, confess it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll give you his word. As soon as you confess it, soon as you confess you're wrong, have you got sin? Have you got something that's standing between you and God? As soon as you confess it with a repentant heart, it falls, he said, into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ. And the blood of Jesus Christ, it it destroys the very chemistry of that disobedience. It takes iniquity and you can't find it again. You can't find it again. &gt;&gt; You drop that drop of ink into that into that tub of bleach. He said it even breaks up the chemistry and makes the ink bleach. &gt;&gt; Try to figure that one out. God is able to take your wrongs, your insecurities, your complexes, and yes, even your disobedience and turn it around to his glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's able. &gt;&gt; He's able &gt;&gt; to take your your wrongs. &gt;&gt; He's able to take your disobedience and cause it to glorify himself if you will turn your life to him now. [Applause] Hallelujah to God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends. I feel the devil's on the run. The devil's defeated. He hates this kind of word. I say glory to God. &gt;&gt; This is what the church needs to hear. &gt;&gt; I could pick out all your little faults. You know what your faults are. People don't need to hear about their faults. They need to hear how to get rid of them. They need to rise above them. &gt;&gt; They need to hear how it won't happen anymore. I'm showing you the way out. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. This is the way of power. This is the way of victory. &gt;&gt; This is the language of the conqueror. &gt;&gt; You are a conqueror in him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My goodness, our time is going. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every enemy's under your feet." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want you to hear the last prayer, not a quote, is a living word &gt;&gt; for this hour &gt;&gt; for the body and bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because you're in Christ and because everything is under his feet." How do we get into him? by one spirit. We're all baptized into one body and been made partakers of the same blessing. The same power. The same blessing. The same power. &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that? The same blessing. The same power. The same blessing. The same power. &gt;&gt; His power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The same faith dwells within our heart that dwelt in Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Our father Abraham in the faith, the same faith is here this morning. &gt;&gt; It dwelt in Abraham and the same faith that was in Abraham holding a promise of God just before the destruction of the world. We don't doubt that. Just before the destruction of the world, Sodom, world in the last in Lot's day. Now, here it is. That same faith can draw that same angel &gt;&gt; to this building. That same faith you said, I have the same faith that was in my father Abraham. And that faith, it needs to be developed and can draw that angel, the angel of the Lord into this building at this time. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Then you can say from your soul, all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. [Applause] says, "You believe it." &gt;&gt; And he asked, "How many out there believe it?" How many out there believe it? &gt;&gt; Your faith, &gt;&gt; that's enough to even do with all the doubters. &gt;&gt; That's enough. &gt;&gt; You that believe it is enough. I don't care if there are those that don't believe it. It still will happen. &gt;&gt; And the bound will be delivered &gt;&gt; and the sick shall be healed &gt;&gt; and the lost shall be found. &gt;&gt; That's thus sayeth the word. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I want you to see just a little bit of your land and what it what it might be that we need to develop in these resources of this land. Grace be unto you and peace. &gt;&gt; Who's here? Say, I I don't have peace. This is your land. &gt;&gt; This is your possession. And there's a motherload of peace. And the devil would like you to be all distressed so you don't have any peace. I say unto you, this is your this is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Don't let him lie to you about this. &gt;&gt; Peace &gt;&gt; be unto you from God and the Lord Jesus Christ. He has chosen us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in him &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You've got a corner of your property that announces that you the people who live here are chosen. &gt;&gt; They're the chosen race. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children, &gt;&gt; I have been predestinated &gt;&gt; unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to himself. &gt;&gt; What a statement. I've been chosen. &gt;&gt; I've been sent peace and grace. &gt;&gt; He has made Oh, I'd love to take you in the word. He has actually fashioned. &gt;&gt; He's made us &gt;&gt; to be accepted &gt;&gt; into beloved. G. &gt;&gt; Amen. My mouth can hardly frame the words. &gt;&gt; It is so glorious. &gt;&gt; God has made us, made me, made you accepted the before a holy God who these lips aren't worthy to frame the his name. And that's why the Jews think it is absolutely impossible for a human to speak the name of God. Whether we say his name, who knows exactly how the the the the sound is or the f uh the how it's how it's pronounced. But to think that we can come into his presence and be accepted &gt;&gt; only because there's blood &gt;&gt; accepted in the beloved. We have redemption. &gt;&gt; Not will have. We have redemption &gt;&gt; through his blood. forgiveness. Who might need this? &gt;&gt; Who might need this this morning? &gt;&gt; Forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Who might need it? &gt;&gt; Maybe someone sitting somewhere in the church or someone who's not in the building right now needs forgiveness and you've got it to give them. &gt;&gt; So, I've had a hard time. That's not the point. I'm here and I felt urged by God's spirit to say, "You've got it. &gt;&gt; You've got the material. &gt;&gt; You've got it in you. &gt;&gt; You can forgive them." How many times Peter thought he was really going overboard? &gt;&gt; Should I forgive him seven times in a day? 70 times seven. &gt;&gt; Isn't that about 490? &gt;&gt; Is that more? &gt;&gt; 490 times. 489. If he if he comes again or if she comes again, I think I'll give him a piece of my mind. Don't do it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And nobody here has had to go 490 times and probably not even seven. How many times? And from your heart, &gt;&gt; you forgive. Even before they come, they're forgiven. &gt;&gt; And leave the consequences to God. What kind of a God do we serve? We have a great judge. He knows absolutely everything. He knows the beginning from the end. He knows who's responsible, who's not responsible. He knows what the intent was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Forgive and he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. having made known unto us the mystery of his will. I say, "Oh, when they talk about mysteries, I just feel you need to develop that area." &gt;&gt; Oh, I have so much I could say. Each one of these are sermon in the dispensation of the fullness of times. he might gather together in one all things that are Christ. How come you're here? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, someone else invited me this, that, the other thing. What about putting God in the formula? What about putting God in the equation? What about leaving everyone else out and say, "God did it. &gt;&gt; I'm here because God gathered me. &gt;&gt; God put his arm around me." Say, "Well, it was this circumstance, that circumstance." Forget the circumstance. Forget the people. Forget everything else. Forget the preacher. Say, "God gathered me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; In whom also we have, we have obtained. &gt;&gt; We have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think some here are like the prodal. How many have heard of the prodical son? Let me see your hands. How many have heard of the prodical son? &gt;&gt; How many have never heard of him? Well, a whole bunch of people. really don't know whether they did or not. But anyway, how many you afraid to raise your hands? God bless his honest brother. Are there some others that want to join him? I'll shake your hand after the service. &gt;&gt; But the prodal had a brother. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the prodal, you know, he was a rascal. He got everything. He came to his father, give me all my inheritance. Oh man, I can't get out of here to get ready to uh feel my wild oats. I just want to I want to taste the wall. I want to be out of I'm out of here. So he checked out and he went down into far country and wasted all of his living. And you know what? When he was wasting it, he had friends. &gt;&gt; You always got friends when you're wasting it. Oh, they love you. my friends. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Then when uh money was gone, the friends were gone. His best friends was some pigs. &gt;&gt; And he even shared dinner with them. &gt;&gt; He ate what the pigs ate. &gt;&gt; You know, one day probably chewing on an old corn cob. He's thought, "You know what? This is ridiculous. I'm going to throw this thing down. I remember my father's servants. They ate a whole lot. My father, he treated his servants so well and they ate so well. What am I doing down this mess? Oh, praise God for his grace. &gt;&gt; Kind of waking a person up. He said, "I will return to my father's house and I will tell him I have sinned against you and against heaven. I've sinned against everybody. I've been a disgrace to the family." And he got it all planned. How he was going to pray, &gt;&gt; just what he was going to say. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's going to say that just the right kind of prayer. I tell you what, he got coming home. His father had been looking for him &gt;&gt; cuz his father knew. His father knew that son's going to come. He's got to come back. He's got to come back because I believe for him. I don't know how and I don't know when, but he's got to come back and he kept looking for him. One day there he comes over the hill. His father runs out to him. He get father I said forget it. &gt;&gt; I know all about it. I know what this foolishness is all about. Come on in. Uh son, go and servant go and get the fatted calf. Another one, please run to the closet and get the best robe. Oh, go to the jewelry box and get the ring out. And yes, send these servants out to all the neighbors. We're going to have a feast tonight. There's going to be rejoicing tonight. My son that was lost has come home. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And one wasn't happy. &gt;&gt; He was the older brother. He says, "I go to church all the time. I've never failed to go to the tithe box and put in my tithing. And when they talked to when brother Admma talked about the uh the overseas, I was there. And when they needed some extra work done, I was there. I worked around the church. I was so faithful. I never disobeyed any of your any of your any of your laws or any of your uh principles. I never disobeyed them ever. The father came out and that's what he said to him. He said, "Here, I've been with you all these years. I've worked in the field. I've worked through the heat. I've worked through the cold. I've been as faithful. You could count on me. I'd be sitting in my seat. I sang when they sang. I did what I prayed when they pray. I was faithful. And never once did I go against one of your laws. You know what the father said? He didn't say, "Well, I remember a time." No, he said, "All that I have is yours." &gt;&gt; He was so hardwork. He was so unhappy. He was unhappy because he never he never got to appreciate the resources that were right there. That best garment hung there all the time. &gt;&gt; That calf they were just killing was always out in the field. That ring was always in the jewelry box. The neighbors were always there. But he didn't know how to enjoy it. &gt;&gt; He didn't know how to enjoy it. He just, you know, just his old grumpy self. Oh, I'd sooner have somebody discover &gt;&gt; that there's some riches around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's such a riches in fellowship. &gt;&gt; I've had people say, "I don't have any friends. Nobody comes over to see me and I am upset." I said, "How did you invite anybody?" Well, no. I'm kind of a loner. Well, then you'll stay alone. How about inviting somebody? How about inviting somebody and they'll be there? Someone says just the other day they're sitting here. He said, "We invited you." They invited us and we came within two days. He said, "We couldn't believe it. You're so busy." I said, "When did you invite us?" So you invite us. We were right there. Oh, I tell you what. Don't overload me now. But there's a well &gt;&gt; of fellowship. &gt;&gt; There's a well within the body of Christ. Let me say to you as I come to a close, the closet is full of beautiful robes. &gt;&gt; And the and the field is full of fatted calves &gt;&gt; and the neighbors are waiting to rejoice with you. They don't want to go over all of your troubles and all of that here. They're interested in hearing your positive confession, what God did for you, what you got out of the word of God, and what God is doing in your life. That's what we fellowship around. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I haven't got very far. Brother Lance is going to preach tonight. And he generally comes and I come with meat and potatoes, and he comes with the icing on the cake. So, he'll come with dessert tonight. I'm sure. I'm anxious to hear it. I just I just started. All we did was just kind of get through the gate. &gt;&gt; And the land looks wonderful, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Doesn't the land look wonderful? &gt;&gt; Oh, it just depends what kind of eyes. We've got the eyes of Joshua and Caleb. They haven't got the eyes of the others said, "Oh my, these wall cities." And you know what? Then they they looked in relationship to the obstacle to themselves and they said, "We saw the men, giants in the land, and we are like grasshoppers." Now, that was one testimony. The other two said, "They're just bread for us. Let's go and eat them up. [Applause] And here's the grapes to prove it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet used the language used that language in reference to the word that we have received. I tell you, somebody went across. &gt;&gt; Somebody has gone into the presence of God. They've come back with a grapes of esto. &gt;&gt; It's a good land, friends. It's a good land. It's a good land, young ladies. It's a good land, young couples. It's a good land, &gt;&gt; young man. It's a good land. &gt;&gt; Develop that land. &gt;&gt; It's there. It is there. You have it. &gt;&gt; You have it now. You have it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. You've already had it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you haven't developed it. Just develop it. &gt;&gt; Exercise it. &gt;&gt; Work on it. So, well, how do I? We'll start with the confession. &gt;&gt; If you can't do anything between now and the next service, just say, I am not going to confess anything of a negative nature. &gt;&gt; I am going to confess what God's word has said. That's what I'm going to say. I'm going to say it in the face of every devil. I'm going to say it in the face of every every failure. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't fail? We all fail. &gt;&gt; What do you do when you fail? I failed. So many times I would even want to I don't want to think about it. &gt;&gt; What do you do? Sometimes I bury my head. That's awful. This will pass. And then I think of what the prophet said. Any son of God when he falls, &gt;&gt; he will quickly get up. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm going to get up. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get up." And that devil &gt;&gt; that kind of lured me to maybe say that or to do that or whatever more. I'm going to do him damage &gt;&gt; or cause me to doubt that or cause me to be weak in my faith. I'm going to do him damage. &gt;&gt; My God &gt;&gt; has said certain things &gt;&gt; and I'm going to confess that. &gt;&gt; I believe that will give him the greatest pleasure &gt;&gt; if he sees you confessing that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We'll have our musicians and and Lord willing, I'd like to show you something of the rest of the land. I have I think I've only gone through just a handful of slides. I'm on slide four. I've probably got 16 or 17. And uh something we could say on each one of them. Did you like looking at your land? &gt;&gt; We don't have any you don't have any doubt of what he did. Now you can you must not doubt what he did for you. That's why he did it. &gt;&gt; He did it with a purpose and it's for you. Hallelujah. Wonderful. All right. It's the same God. He's living in me. Same God is living in me. [Music] Let's stand, shall we? Sing God spoke to the same God [Music] to many to tell. The same God who part [Music] [Applause] [Music] is the same God in me. Oh, the same God. away [Applause] today. [Applause] Sing God [Music] living. You know, I want to sing the verses, but I don't know the verses. But I think we can just mine some of the resources that are right here and maybe use them to the glory of God. Doesn't take long, just as long as it takes them to walk to the platform. I I couldn't remember who sang that. Sister Elizabeth Neighbor, you sang this. So, why don't you come out? We're going to help everyone. And they're not going to sing. There's some members of the choir. If you're free, just come and sing impromptu. We'll sing it for the glory of God. We're all going to sing it. Where's the choir? Out here. I'm just asking them to help me. I don't know it. And some of these, you know, they get certain time in them, and I'm I'm amidextrous, so I can't get on the right time. That's my problem. All right. My goodness. Here they are. Didn't know that we had so so many. Anybody else may not be in the choir? You want to join them? Come on up. We're full of surprises. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Red Sea. We'll sing it once again. It's the same God living in. Sing the chorus once again. Oh, the same God. A woman at a well. It's the same God too many to tell. The same God who fight the raing ring. [Applause] He is the same God who me. I look back on history. I see a mighty God unveiled proving over and over. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That his word has never failed. &gt;&gt; But I can't keep on dwelling on some past meories. [Music] But now I think God is living in me. &gt;&gt; You believe it? The same God who spoke to the woman at the same [Music] [Applause] God who the Red. &gt;&gt; Oh, the same God who [Music] the same God who created all the heavens and all the earth came back living in Jesus. And there was power in his word. And now in these last days, I'm beginning to see. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That it's that same God and he's living in me. The same sparted [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the [Applause] [Music] He's the same. [Music] Oh, the same God who spoke to the woman. He's the same God and wonder. There are too many to God who are the ra [Music] and he's living in me. [Music] &gt;&gt; That same God is here. That same God that spoke to the woman of the well &gt;&gt; and spoke to us here. &gt;&gt; There may be someone, maybe more than one. God spoke to you. You know it's him &gt;&gt; and you need to develop it further. You need prayer. You need deliverance. You need forgiveness. You need redemption. You need to be free. We got men of God here that'll pray, pray with you, pray for you. If you wish to come, fine. But don't come unless you're coming with faith in your heart. I know and I'm convinced. I'm thoroughly convinced that that God that spoke to the woman at the well, that God is here. That God is present now. I'm convinced it's that God that spoke to me. I'm convinced that this is the day that he prophesied and spoke would be that would come our way that this is the last time. I'm convinced it's he that will deliver me. You want to come? We're going to sing it once again. There's a ministers are here. Brother Lance, brother Tony, brother Dier, brother Tom, others are here. They'll pray with you. But don't don't come just as a formality or a ceremony. Come if you are determined. This is it. &gt;&gt; I remember well the day I laid it down. It was all over. &gt;&gt; Right. That day it was finished. I was done with the world. I was done with the devil. And God knows. And the devil knows when you mean business. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And something half-hearted doesn't work. It does not work. Never will work. Your own thoughts, your own plans of how you're going to do it and when you're going to do it. When I get home, that's what I'm going to say. I'm going to say when I get ready is what I'm going to say. You might not even have the chance to get ready. Now is the accepted time. And today is a day of salvation. What greater thing could God do today than to whisk someone out of the grip of the enemy and usher them into the presence of God and cause angels to burst out with singing and rejoicing. A son has come home. A daughter has come home. Hallelujah. As they sing it once again, the same God. Do you know it's your time? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; The same God [Music] [Applause] today. [Applause] The same God who is the Amazing. [Applause] Oh, is the same [Music] God. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, he's the same God. Not too many to tell. The same God who pardons the resol [Music] [Music] [Applause] to tell the same God who pardon the raing red. [Music] The same God is within me. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, it is indeed the same God. You're the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. &gt;&gt; You're the God of the prophets, the God of the apostles, and of the messengers. You're the God of the Elijah of this time. How many times, Lord, you heard your prophet messenger, our precious brother Brandham pray. And oh many of those prayers Lord I repeat because I know there is incense before your very throne. And now my prayer oh God and the prayers of all those that are present and all those in the invisible audience wherever they might be in the world. We blend our hearts together. We pray that your divine will and purpose will be done. We ask, oh God, you will receive now our confession. We believe that by grace we are saved through faith and that it is not of ourselves. We believe that as we confess, oh God, concerning what you have spoken of our own self, our own walk, and as I've attempted today, Lord, to give them a little preview of what the land holds for them and what is really there, I pray, oh God, your people will tap into it. I pray, oh God, they will be exercised. They will develop these things, oh Lord, and we will not remain children any longer. We will do business with you, oh Lord. I pray, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, you will set free every soul that is bound. Let the chains now be broken. In the name of Jesus Christ, I speak to you that are bound. If you will now speak the name of Jesus Christ, you shall go free. The mighty conqueror is here. present now to do it. A habit binds you. A habit ties you down. Sin, Satan, and all of his attributes are broken. The shackles are broken. The lamb of God is present. The conqueror came from the tomb and has been resurrected out of history. He's not somewhere in the past. Dear friends, he's here now. And oh God, may that living presence now come surround each one. And as your people will soon depart, Lord, may they go in the glory, the victory of their mighty redeemer, conquering every gate of the enemy. Father, I pray for everyone that stands in need. We're here to meet needs. We're here, oh Lord, that the sun may shine in darkened places. We're here, oh God, that the fog of doubt and unbelief will be dispersed in the bright sunshine, for the sun has risen. And we say to the people, arise, shine, your light has come. And all we can do is reflect that heavenly light. Bless your people, oh God. Dismiss us and send us from this place with joy, grace, peace, and all the benefits of the land. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Lord, I'm asking you remember Sister Esther Shackleford's family. Oh God, as this grand believer, this grand woman of the church, she's taking her place now with those that have gone on before. Others perhaps, many of them martyed, some burned at the stake. But here's a woman that has lived most of her life, right up to her 90 years, fervently showing the glow of the glory of Christ on her face. I thank you, Lord, for her life. Pray now, Lord, you'll be with all those that are today for the first Lord's day without her. You will strengthen them and be near them. And now as we prepare this afternoon, Lord, for this evening service and some have to drive on the highway, Lord, our brother Kim and Hetty Dingwall and those that are with them, ask that you'll give them safe journey. Watch over them over the long journey home in Jesus Christ's name. Dismiss us now. Amen. Hallelujah. May the resource that is in you be extended to someone else as you greet them as they're uplifted by looking in your face. Hallelujah. God bless you. Why don't we sing it perhaps? Sing it again. No woman at the well. He's the same God is wonder. Are you ready to tell the same God who is the raing? [Applause] He's the same God and he's living in me. Oh, the same God who spoke to the woman at the well. He's the same God who are too many to tell. The same God who parted the raging west [Music] the same God is living in me. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you. Go prayerfully. Go quietly. Go reverently. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't visit in the foyer if you don't mind. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you choir. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thanks brothers. God bless you brother Jeremy. God bless brother Jay. Appreciate you. Thank you. [Music] Christ. [Music] blessing.
