[9:39] then enter. Brother Cart, if you'd come
[9:40] and open the service in a word of
[9:43] prayer.
[9:44] We've got a couple of testimonies this
[9:47] evening we just want to thank the Lord
[9:48] for. Sister uh Debbie Paris has written
[9:51] here. Lily broke her collar bone in half
[9:54] with X-rays to prove she hasn't
[9:55] brackets. On Thursday the 19th after
[9:58] prayer Sunday morning, we took off the
[10:01] sling and she's had no pain medication
[10:03] since. Uh we praise the Lord for a quick
[10:06] work and for mending her bones.
[10:09] And Sister Lisa St. John has written
[10:11] here, "We'd like to thank the Lord for
[10:13] my mom's healing. She is home after back
[10:16] surgery and doing wonderful. I'd also
[10:19] like to thank the Lord for a good report
[10:21] on my heart test and healing Anna Hope
[10:24] and Samuel. Thank you for all your
[10:26] prayers. St. John's,
[10:30] brother Serge has a prayer request here.
[10:32] Just ask that we remember David. He's at
[10:34] home sick and body. Also, Brother Tom
[10:36] Freys has remember Sister Kim. She's
[10:39] also at home not well.
[10:42] Uh, Sister Michelle O'Brien has written
[10:44] here, "Please pray for Gene Elizabeth
[10:46] Naboc's little girl. Uh, she is b has
[10:50] been battling a high fever for two days
[10:51] now."
[10:53] And also, we want to remember Heather
[10:55] O'Brien as she is going in for surgery
[10:57] tomorrow morning. So, we want to lift
[11:00] her up in prayer. If you have anything
[11:02] on your heart, any needs, just raise
[11:05] your hands as we go to prayer for the
[11:07] cart.
[11:08] [Music]
[11:14] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just want to
[11:16] come to you tonight and thank you,
[11:18] Father, for what you've done in our
[11:19] lives, Lord. Lord, how you came to us,
[11:22] Lord. We're not looking for you, but you
[11:24] came to us, Father. And we just want to
[11:26] thank you for it, Father. We come to you
[11:28] so earnestly and so eagerly, so fast,
[11:31] Lord. We just want to make sure that we
[11:32] thank you just as fast for what you've
[11:34] done, Father, for these testimonies,
[11:36] Lord. Healing in the body, Father, just
[11:38] proving again and again that you're the
[11:40] same yesterday, today, and forever. Dear
[11:43] Lord, we want to commit this evening
[11:45] service to you, Father. We want to pray
[11:47] for these ones that have pinned down
[11:49] their requests. Lord, dear God, if if
[11:52] God be for us, who can be against us?
[11:54] That's all we can say, Lord. We know
[11:56] you've done it before. You already done
[11:57] it, Lord. And we're so thankful for it,
[11:59] Father. We just want to lift these ones
[12:01] up. Hold them up in prayer, Father.
[12:04] Anoint their faith, Lord. And we know
[12:06] how the enemy comes in through any way
[12:08] he can, through loved ones, through
[12:10] children. Dear God, may you just anoint
[12:12] their faith to stand on the word of God
[12:14] and nothing else, Lord. For that's all
[12:16] that we can stand on in this dark, dark
[12:18] hour. Pray, Lord, that you'll be with us
[12:20] through the service. Anoint the speaker
[12:22] and hearer alike, Father, and bless it
[12:24] to our hearts that we may hear and see
[12:26] what the word of God has for us tonight.
[12:28] Jesus Christ's precious name we ask it.
[12:30] Amen.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[12:37] [Music]
[12:41] Amen. I want to welcome everyone
[12:44] tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus
[12:45] Christ. If you're visiting with us, we
[12:47] want to say God bless you. Trust you
[12:49] feel welcome.
[12:50] in his presence. Those on the telephone
[12:52] hookup and on the internet, we want to
[12:53] say God bless you to you. Also, we're
[12:55] going to turn the service immediately to
[12:57] brother Ed. As we do so, I'd like to
[12:59] sing um same God who spoke to the woman
[13:02] at the well.
[13:04] We'll start with the uh the first verse.
[13:10] I look back
[13:13] on history,
[13:15] see the mighty God of
[13:22] away
[13:23] [Music]
[13:24] and
[13:26] [Applause]
[13:29] I can't
[13:31] [Music]
[13:40] save
[13:47] the savior. I
[13:50] love you.
[13:52] [Music]
[13:52] [Applause]
[14:05] might
[14:09] [Applause]
[14:12] [Music]
[14:13] the same God.
[14:21] Oh, the same God who created
[14:25] all the heavens and all the earth
[14:30] came back
[14:32] Jesus.
[14:33] There's power in his word.
[14:38] Now in his last days I'm beginning to
[14:44] see
[14:47] that the same God who made me
[14:57] want to
[15:00] [Applause]
[15:00] [Music]
[15:03] say I wonder
[15:09] [Applause]
[15:11] the same God
[15:15] the raing
[15:17] sea.
[15:20] He's the same God
[15:23] living in me. Let's lift the chorus up
[15:26] again. Once again,
[15:28] the same God who spoke to you.
[15:33] [Music]
[15:34] The well,
[15:36] the same God who wonder
[15:42] [Applause]
[15:45] God
[15:48] the raing.
[15:53] He's the same God
[15:56] living in me.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; And we believe that.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, I don't know about
[16:05] you, but I've been rejoicing in the
[16:08] word, having a wonderful time. Uh,
[16:12] Sunday, I was I guess you could tell
[16:14] from the preaching I was swimming and uh
[16:18] sometimes I felt I was under the water a
[16:20] good distance. But I hope uh I hope you
[16:23] all were able to feed on the word
[16:27] &gt;&gt; kind of once every once in a while you
[16:29] get into those areas where just you know
[16:32] your mind
[16:34] doesn't have the capacity and you just
[16:37] spring out into the great expanse of of
[16:41] God and you try to absorb it and I tell
[16:44] you it's just when you get into the
[16:45] subject of the blood it's just too
[16:48] great. That's all. This evening we're
[16:50] going to have a a little different uh
[16:52] service going to be divided up a wee
[16:54] bit. Um brother Jeremy Bergen has been
[16:59] working on
[17:01] uh a website that was very much on his
[17:04] heart to do
[17:06] and this website is just being
[17:08] developed.
[17:10] Uh I believe it will I have seen just a
[17:13] preliminary bit and you will see more of
[17:16] it tonight.
[17:18] uh I believe that it will prove to be a
[17:20] powerful witnessing tool
[17:23] for all of you who really have a desire
[17:26] to witness. Uh
[17:29] Jeremy will is going to come and
[17:31] introduce the format to you and it'll
[17:34] take a a little bit of time but don't
[17:35] worry uh not going to drag the service
[17:38] out on unnecessarily.
[17:40] Uh and he will introduce the format.
[17:43] There are some video clips of
[17:45] testimonies
[17:46] and this will this is going to be a very
[17:48] broad scope uh this uh website. It will
[17:52] have uh video clips and various
[17:54] testimonies whether audio or video. It
[17:58] has uh some of uh quotes of brother
[18:00] Brandham with his voice behind it. And
[18:04] uh he will also be asking for some
[18:07] volunteers because uh it isn't
[18:09] completely developed by any any stretch
[18:11] of the imagination.
[18:13] So, I'm going to ask brother Jeremy to
[18:16] come and he will he will be able to just
[18:18] uh show this to you. It's going to be on
[18:20] the screen right after that. We have
[18:22] some very exciting news that has just
[18:24] come out of China. And brother Tonyy's
[18:27] going to just take a a few moments and
[18:29] tell you about that and and also show
[18:32] you some things that are just happening
[18:33] there. You'll see some uh some slides of
[18:37] that of some of the believers there. and
[18:40] then uh uh I'm going to preach.
[18:45] &gt;&gt; So if if that won't be a full evening, I
[18:48] hope it'll tide you over till Sunday.
[18:50] Amen. Brother Jeremy, why don't you
[18:53] come?
[18:58] I've asked brother Jeremy to uh just
[19:02] speak very precisely and not too fast. I
[19:05] don't know about you, but sometimes the
[19:06] young people, they speak so fast, I my
[19:08] mind doesn't work quite fast enough. So,
[19:11] I just have to absorb it. By the time
[19:13] I've absorbed the last sentence, I'm
[19:15] three down. They're three down the road.
[19:17] So, I have to ask around the
[19:19] congregation, you know, and by the time
[19:21] I'm out of the door, I hope I have most
[19:23] of the the whole content. But tonight, I
[19:26] don't want to lose any of this, and I
[19:27] don't want you to lose it. And so, you
[19:29] listen real real close. Brother Jeremy,
[19:31] thank you and God bless you. We
[19:33] appreciate uh probably hundreds of hours
[19:35] that have gone into this now. Hundreds
[19:37] of hours. God bless you, Brother Jeremy.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Well, just hold off, brother Darren, for
[19:42] a second here. Um sorry if I talk fast.
[19:46] I talk fast. I mumble. I know that. I'm
[19:48] going to try and get over that. Um
[19:52] before I started, I just actually wanted
[19:53] to just give a short little testimony of
[19:55] thanks and praise to the Lord. Um over
[19:57] the last two years, I've brought my
[19:59] family up to get prayed for three
[20:01] different times. The first time was when
[20:02] my daughter and Lana had collic. Brought
[20:04] her up here. She came crying all the way
[20:06] to the front. Prayed for her. She left.
[20:08] She wasn't crying and she, you know, the
[20:10] Lord healed her right there. Uh, second
[20:12] time was when my son Joel was playing in
[20:15] his back in my parents' backyard. He
[20:17] fell over. He was, you know, dizzy,
[20:21] incoherent. Brought him to the hospital.
[20:24] Brother Tom came, prayed for him.
[20:25] Brother Ed came, prayed for him. You
[20:27] know, within two hours he was walking by
[20:29] himself. never know what was wrong with
[20:31] him, but we're just thankful to the Lord
[20:32] that he's,
[20:34] &gt;&gt; you know, he can solve any problem, no
[20:36] matter what what it is. And uh on
[20:38] Sunday, Joanna came forward and she was
[20:41] just feeling fatigued and, you know, the
[20:43] doctors had done some blood tests, just
[20:45] couldn't find what was wrong, but she
[20:46] can never get over it. And uh prayed
[20:50] here on Sunday and Monday, no problem.
[20:53] Tuesday, no problem. Which is amazing
[20:55] because our kids got up every half hour
[20:57] on Monday night. So the fact that either
[21:01] of us had any energy on Tuesday was just
[21:02] a miracle. So we just want to thank the
[21:04] Lord for doing that for us.
[21:10] Amen. I'm excited. I'm excited about
[21:12] this website. Um normally I don't say
[21:15] two words when I'm leading songs. Um but
[21:17] this has got me up here. I don't know
[21:19] why, but I'm up here. Um
[21:24] I'm excited about a problem. And that
[21:26] problem I have is witnessing. My track
[21:28] record with witnessing is not good. Um I
[21:31] don't know there's nobody in the church
[21:32] here who's brought come to the message
[21:33] because of me. Um I've spoken lots to
[21:36] people at university at work. You give
[21:38] it a track and it comes back four months
[21:40] later. I was too busy to read it. But
[21:43] did you watch the hockey game last
[21:44] night? You know it's all that I just
[21:47] it's so hard to break through.
[21:48] Generation X or Y or whatever you want
[21:50] to call it. my generation I there's
[21:52] there's a barrier there that you know
[21:54] they they like to be ignorant um and
[21:56] like to let things slide by and it's
[21:58] hard to witness to that still at the
[22:00] same time uh Zechariah 8:16 says these
[22:03] are the things you shall do speak every
[22:05] man the truth to his neighbor and I
[22:07] believe that's what we're called to do
[22:08] is uh tell the message you know I've
[22:10] given out some tracks but it doesn't
[22:13] anyway haven't seen much response on
[22:16] that so at the start of 2005 last year I
[22:19] was given a challenge
[22:22] And normally you say, "What if Jesus
[22:24] would come today? How would you live
[22:26] your life?" And I thought, "Well, that's
[22:28] that's really easy. You know that from
[22:30] the message. You go to work, you plant
[22:31] your potatoes, that's it." And I
[22:34] thought, "What if Jesus was to come two
[22:36] years from now? What could I do?" And
[22:38] that's where I started to get excited
[22:39] because I realized I couldn't just I
[22:41] could tell more than my friends. I could
[22:43] I could tell everybody in the world if I
[22:46] put my mind to it. And the Lord blessed
[22:48] it. And that's where this comes from. Um
[22:50] Mike Ray calls it the incarta of the
[22:52] message. Um if you know what that is, it
[22:55] give you a little bit idea about it. If
[22:56] you don't, hopefully uh you'll learn
[22:58] more about it now. Um
[23:03] so over the past year with help from
[23:05] different believers including Mike Ray,
[23:07] Sam Ray, Jeff Walman helped a lot and
[23:10] sister Heidi Davis as well. Um maybe
[23:14] we'd play the introduction now if you
[23:16] can.
[23:23] Only once
[23:25] in all history
[23:28] has a supernatural being photographed.
[23:33] There is a reason.
[23:38] And then you have the scripture, behold,
[23:39] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[23:41] before the coming of the great and
[23:42] dreadful day of the Lord. Um, the
[23:44] purpose of this website is you give it
[23:47] give the website address to someone who
[23:48] knows nothing about
[23:51] the message and hopefully there's enough
[23:55] sorry to borrow the phrase shock value
[23:57] in this to carry their interest past a
[23:59] few pages and hopefully um the one
[24:02] logical link on this front page here
[24:04] that's missing is about the photograph
[24:07] that's missing I know but the rest of it
[24:08] runs in a very logical order. You see at
[24:10] the top it says what was said, who was
[24:15] he, and his effect. And at the end of
[24:19] his effect is what's in it for me. So
[24:21] that's the logical order for this. Um
[24:25] why don't we go to the first doctrines
[24:28] page? What was said? What did brother
[24:30] Random say? He said doctrines,
[24:31] prophecies,
[24:33] um and discernment. And that's what
[24:34] under what was said column. So let's go
[24:37] to who is this MelzDC. You see, I've
[24:39] done one or two here. It's a It's a
[24:41] prototype. This is not on the internet
[24:42] right now. It's only on our hard drives,
[24:44] but this is a prototype. Why don't we
[24:46] just play the first clip?
[24:50] &gt;&gt; The true revelation of Melzdc comes into
[24:54] view
[24:56] was he was God the Word before he became
[25:00] flesh.
[25:02] God the word because he had to be. No
[25:06] one else could be immortal like him.
[25:10] See, I had father and mother. You did,
[25:14] too. Jesus had father and mother.
[25:18] But this man had no father or had no
[25:22] mother.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a tiny story. This man didn't.
[25:27] [Music]
[25:30] Jesus gave his life. This man couldn't
[25:32] because he was right.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; It's a self-same man all the time. Amen.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; I hope God reveals it to you.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; It's still the same person all the time.
[25:44] &gt;&gt; So, the purpose of that clip, if you did
[25:46] not know who Melzdc was, I've talked to
[25:49] lots of people in denominations. They
[25:51] don't know who Melzdc was. I guess they
[25:53] don't read that part of the New
[25:54] Testament. Um, you would now know who
[25:57] MelzDC was. There's also a second clip.
[26:00] We're not going to play that. Um
[26:04] the followup for this clip, you'll see a
[26:06] number of scriptures listed underneath.
[26:09] They start at Genesis and they go to
[26:11] Revelation down the side. Why don't we
[26:13] click on the first one, Genesis 14
[26:17] uh 14- 24. And maybe we'll highlight the
[26:19] 18th verse.
[26:22] What you have here is you'll see on the
[26:26] right hand side there's a number of
[26:28] message text titles. You click on that
[26:32] hopefully eventually it will take you to
[26:34] a website such as the free word where
[26:35] you can get the whole um um message.
[26:40] But
[26:42] Genesis 14
[26:45] 18 verse 18
[26:48] in in um this the message adoption
[26:51] that's the message where brother
[26:52] Brandham used this scripture in the
[26:55] context of Melzdc. So what I've done is
[26:57] I've gone through here Genesis to
[26:58] Revelations and no matter what scripture
[27:00] you you you find you can then get a link
[27:04] to the scripture if you're interested in
[27:06] that subject. Um, let's go to a woman's
[27:10] covering. This is exactly the same
[27:12] thing. Uh, somebody said that's easy for
[27:15] Godhead. You can't do it for a woman's
[27:16] covering. There's one scripture. Um, I
[27:19] started in gener Genesis, went down to
[27:21] Revelations. Um,
[27:24] I'm not going to go through that right
[27:26] now, but there's a scripture comparison
[27:28] that I've done for this, which is on the
[27:30] top right hand,
[27:33] which we'll enlarge here. And what this
[27:35] does, it compares four different uh
[27:39] versions. Maybe zoom out just for a
[27:41] second. Uh shows you four different
[27:44] versions of the Bible. King James NewsV
[27:48] Amplified and Wcliff New Testament. Uh
[27:50] if you're interested on woman's hair, uh
[27:52] this will tell you, you know, number of
[27:54] different ways. Click down to verse 13-
[27:56] 16. Verse 15 if you read it in King
[27:59] James version says but if a woman have
[28:01] long hair
[28:03] it is glory to her for her hair is given
[28:06] to her for a covering. If you go all the
[28:08] way over to the right hand side of the
[28:10] page we'll read the n cliff says but if
[28:12] a woman nourish long hair it is glory to
[28:15] her for hair be given to her for a
[28:17] covering which that answers your how
[28:19] long is long it's nourishing it's
[28:22] actively long. Um, we can close that and
[28:25] get out what what you've got here for
[28:27] the doctrine side. And this is what I'm
[28:29] looking for volunteers to help with is
[28:31] we've got a template page here,
[28:33] scriptures. Um, Jeff Walman helped me a
[28:36] lot with this. Um, quotes and
[28:38] scriptures. And then, uh, we've got the
[28:40] free form page that you see pop up
[28:42] there. Uh, and that free form page can
[28:44] be used to address any questions that
[28:46] you have on the message that you can't
[28:48] answer. such as if you have a question
[28:49] about serpent seed, you know, how can a
[28:51] horse and a donkey get together and
[28:53] create a mule, but the mule can't breed
[28:55] itself again? Well, we could address
[28:56] that on a free form page and say,
[28:58] "Listen, there's it happens in nature
[29:00] all the time, and I could name a few for
[29:02] you if you want to talk to me about that
[29:04] later, but it does happen." Uh, what did
[29:08] brother Brandham say? Second thing he
[29:09] said, prophecies.
[29:11] I've got one on here right now, which we
[29:14] won't play the auto clip for, but let's
[29:17] click on the eggshaped car.
[29:24] We'll click on the Nissan.
[29:28] Oh, and another thing that I did with
[29:30] all those scriptures is I contacted all
[29:31] the copyright holders on the different
[29:33] versions of the Bible, and I have
[29:35] authority to use it on the internet and
[29:36] all that kind of stuff. Um,
[29:39] eggshaped cars. You don't know how this
[29:40] is. You open your window and you can't
[29:42] see eggshaped cars driving themselves on
[29:43] the road. I'm It just doesn't happen.
[29:46] Um,
[29:47] however, it's going to happen. Nissan,
[29:50] this is eggshaped car. If you never
[29:51] heard of it, Nissan Pivo, uh, rotates
[29:54] 180°. You can drive in, turn around,
[29:56] drive out. You never have to drive into
[29:57] reverse. Go down to the bus, the park
[30:00] shuttle. It's green. It just disappeared
[30:02] from the top of the screen there. Click
[30:04] on that. Brother Random talked about
[30:06] buses and cars driving on magnetic
[30:08] designated roadways. This is Park
[30:10] Shuttle. It's run by the Dutch Transit
[30:13] Authority. It's in operation in the
[30:14] Netherlands. Um, it works.
[30:17] If somebody wants to go on this bus or
[30:19] knows somebody that can go on this bus,
[30:21] play checkers, and send me a video of
[30:22] yourself playing checkers in this bus,
[30:24] that'd be great. Um,
[30:27] let's go down to uh the black egg. If
[30:31] someone's seen a car that looks more
[30:34] like an egg than this, let me know. The
[30:37] wheels or the doors on the outside
[30:38] there. Uh it's a it's a prototype, but
[30:40] it does drive. Um and finally, the very
[30:43] last one. This is the most exciting one.
[30:45] Uh the US Department of Defense has a
[30:50] mandate by I think it's 2015 2012 to
[30:53] have one-third of their vehicles
[30:54] unmanned. And they started out, I'll
[30:57] just read it. On Sunday, October 8th,
[30:59] 2005, a modified Volkswagen named
[31:01] Stanley beat 23 other robotic cars and
[31:04] 150 miles of unmarked Nevada desert to
[31:06] claim a $2 million prize and the rights
[31:08] to be called the first autonomous
[31:10] off-road vehicle. That means it doesn't
[31:12] drive itself, no remote control, no
[31:14] nothing. Stanley's guided by laser,
[31:16] video, radar signals, is run by seven
[31:18] Intel Pentiums, and is able to tell the
[31:20] difference between a rock and a tumble
[31:22] weed.
[31:24] um they're going to do it. And so
[31:26] somebody questions this prophecy, you
[31:29] now have all the answers. Uh or over the
[31:32] next five years, you're going to have
[31:33] more answers. Right? So this is just
[31:34] leading in this in the right direction.
[31:36] Why don't we go to who was he? Green tab
[31:40] at the top. In this column, we've got
[31:42] historic healings and biography.
[31:43] Biography don't have anything yet.
[31:45] Historic healings. This is basically an
[31:47] internet version of the healing line
[31:50] tapes.
[31:52] Um,
[31:56] brother Ed said on Sunday, "Put the
[31:57] evidence of healing before you." And
[31:59] that's what this is. Let's go to the
[32:00] heart trouble
[32:02] and we'll play the first clip.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; You believe for your heart trouble,
[32:11] sister? You can be made well right now.
[32:13] You believe it? God bless you. You when
[32:15] you walk up there, Jesus Christ.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; A very short clip. get someone in and
[32:21] out knows nothing about the message. Um,
[32:23] there will also have discernments on
[32:25] here later where Brandham picked
[32:27] someone's life apart. Um, Sister Heidi
[32:29] Davis did a bunch of that stuff for me,
[32:30] but we didn't have the time to put it
[32:32] actually up here. Um,
[32:35] again, you've got the message title on
[32:38] the top where
[32:40] um,
[32:42] you know, if you have a specific health
[32:43] problem, you listen to the services
[32:45] where brother Brandham healed those
[32:47] diseases and you know, maybe you can
[32:49] find the healing for yourself in those
[32:51] same um,
[32:54] messages. Let's go to his effect. We'll
[32:58] just hold it on the title there for a
[32:59] second. We've got titles in his effect.
[33:01] We've got current healings worldwide
[33:03] which is would be a link to missions and
[33:05] what's in it for me. That's where we'd
[33:07] lead somebody through which I hope maybe
[33:08] a minister can write um sometime. Um
[33:13] let's go to the current healings.
[33:17] Now I don't know if you've seen before
[33:18] we click on anything here uh the Vietnam
[33:20] memorial in the states which is a big
[33:22] wall of names. Uh that's my idea for
[33:25] this eventually to have a big wall of
[33:26] names. You see brother David Law and Ben
[33:28] Dertie on the side there. Um, I hope to
[33:31] eventually have this filled with I don't
[33:32] know, hundreds, thousands of names, if I
[33:34] can get it. And, um,
[33:38] you know, the only difference between
[33:39] this and the Vietnam memorial is these
[33:40] people aren't dead. And, uh, we've got
[33:43] the evidence. You click on Ben Dertie,
[33:45] we've got the evidence of their their
[33:47] healings here. Uh, this is the after
[33:50] picture. You saw the before picture when
[33:51] Ben Dertie was up here giving his
[33:53] testimony. This is the after picture of
[33:55] the CT scan um, healed. So, what it
[33:58] does, it gives a little tiny blurb on
[34:00] Ben's life, who he was, what happened to
[34:03] him. Uh, if you I should have the before
[34:06] X-ray on there. We have it on the
[34:08] computer. It's not on there right now,
[34:09] but um so you can compare the two if you
[34:12] want. If you have problems with it,
[34:13] well, it's right before you can't say
[34:15] no. What we also have is the doctor's
[34:17] report.
[34:20] And I'm not going to read this either,
[34:21] but it tells you that it happened in
[34:23] Langley Memorial Hospital on May the
[34:24] 23rd, 2005. What happened? how they
[34:27] couldn't find it, everything like that.
[34:30] You tell your tell somebody about that.
[34:31] Anyway, I don't see how somebody can can
[34:33] dispute this stuff. Um, and maybe if you
[34:37] were once an unbeliever, think back to
[34:40] what this would have done to you if you
[34:41] would have read it. Let's close that and
[34:44] we'll go to what was said.
[34:47] Finally, the last one, testimonies.
[34:51] Uh, eventually we're going to have more
[34:53] names here. hopefully Sister Rebecca
[34:54] West. Um the Finland boy who was raised
[34:57] from the dead. Um what right now we've
[34:59] got here is brother Ed, just his name.
[35:01] And we've got Len Bergen, which is my
[35:03] grandpa. Um and these are basically
[35:06] short teaser little video clips. Um
[35:09] hopefully a little bit of shock value in
[35:11] here to keep people, you know, if they
[35:13] view view one, I want them to view 20.
[35:15] Um so those are short things. Let's
[35:17] click on the first uh video there.
[35:26] you at?
[35:27] &gt;&gt; We were in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
[35:28] &gt;&gt; at Brandon's meeting.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; At brother Brandon meetings and they
[35:31] asked me to be an usher. Well, he called
[35:35] this little boy out of the audience and
[35:37] this little boy had a club foot and he
[35:41] had never walked. And so he had brought
[35:44] up a box with him and brother Brandon
[35:48] said, "What's in the box?" He says, "The
[35:51] Lord hasn't shown me what's in that
[35:53] box." He said, "I got a brand new pair
[35:56] of shoes that I'm going to put on when
[35:58] I'm healed." And uh so, Brother
[36:02] Brandham, he cried when he prayed for
[36:06] this little boy. And he says, "Oh Lord
[36:09] Jesus, please heal this little boy." He
[36:11] named I can't remember what his name
[36:13] was.
[36:15] And uh when he finished praying for him,
[36:18] the little boy's leg straightened out
[36:22] and he screamed. And the father knew
[36:25] what was wrong. He took the brace off.
[36:27] Soon as he took the brace off, the
[36:28] little boy's leg came normal like the
[36:31] other one. And uh so brother Brandham
[36:35] says, "What have you got in that box?"
[36:36] Brand new pair of shoes that I'm going
[36:39] to put on when I'm healed.
[36:42] got another one, but I'm not going to
[36:44] play it for you. Um, but I'm hopefully
[36:48] right now I'll just tell you that's all
[36:49] I've got on the website for now. I've
[36:51] got a few more examples of each of
[36:52] these. Um, but what I'm looking for is
[36:55] volunteers who can help. Um, if you have
[36:58] a testimony, if you're in brother
[37:00] Brandham's meetings, uh, Sister Anne,
[37:02] Brother Ba, if you're willing to give a
[37:05] minute video clip, uh, Sister Ruth, I
[37:08] don't, anybody, we can put you on here
[37:10] out of the mouth of two or three
[37:11] witnesses. Let's give the world, show
[37:13] the world everything we've got.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; You know,
[37:16] &gt;&gt; one soul, you know, it'd be worth it
[37:18] all.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Other people who can volunteer, uh,
[37:22] here's your criteria. You have to know
[37:23] how to read.
[37:25] Number two, you have to be able to be
[37:27] perseverant. And that's a little harder
[37:30] than some people may think. Uh but you
[37:32] got to be willing on concentrate on one
[37:33] subject till it's totally completed. Uh
[37:36] number three, you don't have to know how
[37:39] to program. And number four, you don't
[37:41] have to know how to program. I'm not
[37:43] looking for programmers. Um if you do,
[37:45] great. We can use you. But there's more
[37:47] resources out there that um a lot of
[37:50] this content you you simply don't need
[37:52] to know how to do that. simple
[37:53] rudimentary knowledge of computer
[37:54] possibly. Um other jobs I'm looking for
[37:57] photographers, videoers, artists, uh
[38:00] some men to research some doctrines
[38:02] which will hopefully be reviewed by some
[38:05] ministers after. Um so and anyone to
[38:09] research current and historic healings.
[38:11] Um and if you can't do any of that,
[38:13] pray. Um I appreciate that. Um another
[38:17] thing, the doctrines page. If you know a
[38:19] foreign language, how hard would that be
[38:21] to translate into a foreign language?
[38:23] All the work's already been done for
[38:24] you. If you want to when we're done this
[38:26] website, switch it into Chinese. It's
[38:28] not going to be that hard. Um,
[38:34] I don't know if there's anything left to
[38:35] say. Brother Ed said a few weeks ago,
[38:37] vindicate the message.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; This is an opportunity to vindicate the
[38:41] message.
[38:42] Um,
[38:44] the harvest is ripe.
[38:46] I'm going to put a sign on the bulletin
[38:48] board out there in the next few weeks.
[38:50] Keep an eye out. Pray about it. You
[38:52] don't have to come to me if you got an
[38:53] idea. Just keep it in your heart. I'll
[38:54] put a sign on the bulletin board that
[38:57] will direct you. I'm going to put on a
[38:59] Saturday session where say 9:00 we'll
[39:02] talk to the brothers who want to do
[39:03] doctrines. 10:00 we'll talk to people
[39:05] who want to research current healings.
[39:06] And I'll walk through with you my
[39:08] process to doing that. will develop a
[39:09] process for you and how you can send at
[39:12] at the end little end packets of
[39:14] information to the programmers that
[39:15] they'll put it on there. Um,
[39:19] if you're on the internet, please
[39:21] contact the church office and they'll
[39:23] have my or my email address there. If
[39:27] you want it right now, it's jeremy
[39:28] bergenshaw.ca.
[39:30] Um,
[39:33] so let's cast our bread upon the water
[39:35] together. God bless you.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:38] [Music]
[39:46] I think that's wonderful, don't you?
[39:49] &gt;&gt; And we want to thank brother Jeremy for
[39:51] all the work that he has done. Uh it's
[39:54] uh that that's how the gospel gets out.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm just going to read a letter real
[40:00] quick which just came in just written in
[40:03] December 205. Uh,
[40:06] and uh, I believe that this is very
[40:08] appropriate right after Jeremy said,
[40:11] "Well, let's just get it out." Uh, dear
[40:14] brothers and sisters in Christ, this is
[40:16] actually from the Netherlands, this
[40:18] letter. I want to thank you all for your
[40:21] prayers for me and my family. It is a
[40:25] great blessing through all of these
[40:26] seven months, maybe longer, that I have
[40:30] been listening to your sermons. God has
[40:33] done wonderful things in my life. My
[40:36] first decision to obey God was to be
[40:39] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[40:41] Christ. I also quit my job to be a
[40:45] mother again for our children that God
[40:48] has trusted us to raise and to teach
[40:51] them in this way. My new experience with
[40:54] God, I wish I could write more to you,
[40:57] but my English is not so very well. But
[41:00] oh, how I desire always that it was
[41:02] Wednesday and then again Sunday. God
[41:05] spoke to me every time again when you
[41:08] were preaching. And it doesn't matter
[41:11] who's preaching. God is working through
[41:13] you all. Wonderful. How great is our
[41:17] Lord. All those instructions God has
[41:20] given to me, I obey. And God has blessed
[41:24] me abundantly. When I wake up in the
[41:26] midst of the night, it doesn't matter
[41:29] when, I pray for you all. May God give
[41:32] you new strength. Strength like a young
[41:35] eagle or a big strong eagle. God bless
[41:38] you all.
[41:40] Isn't that lovely?
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sincerely in Christ, a sister in
[41:45] Christ. And I would like to also share
[41:47] with you that this week we have we just
[41:51] got the second testimony of the second
[41:54] person that has got saved as a result of
[41:57] brother Mike's service.
[41:59] A woman in England gave her life to
[42:02] Christ. She was backsliden. She was
[42:05] backsliden and got back to God and she
[42:08] said, "I have surrendered my life
[42:10] completely to Jesus Christ and I want
[42:13] you to tell Sister Marilyn her husband
[42:16] didn't die in vain." Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; We got uh we got a message this week and
[42:21] when brother Wes uh Ordeal was here, he
[42:25] told the young people about a man who
[42:28] had come to brother Dutch Scott's uh
[42:31] meeting as a result of a testimony that
[42:34] they had been given and the his wife had
[42:38] known of the message. She really wasn't
[42:41] living. It wasn't a real revelation to
[42:43] her, but she was kind of one of those
[42:44] that's off in some distant place. But
[42:49] her husband and brother West described
[42:52] him so well, just a tobacco chewing. He
[42:55] said, "You all he was was a hunter. Just
[42:58] wanted to talk about hunting. He didn't
[43:00] want to, you know, anything about God.
[43:02] He just was just a rugged man man and
[43:06] and nothing to do with church or
[43:08] anything else. And God got a hold of his
[43:10] heart. I got to make the story short.
[43:13] They they saw the service and they had
[43:16] already been to a they had already been
[43:18] to a service down at Brother Dutch Scots
[43:20] and God had already gripped their hearts
[43:23] and then this just tipped them over the
[43:25] edge. They said, "We just can't wait."
[43:27] And they're going to be baptized this
[43:29] Sunday. Amen.
[43:32] Brother Tony.
[43:34] Hallelujah.
[43:36] Say, "Praise the Lord." Amen. Brother
[43:39] Tony, why don't you come and uh
[43:43] let's just see this recent for China.
[43:47] Is it all right? We're not taking too
[43:48] much time. God bless you.
[43:51] Amen. Well, you uh certainly get excited
[43:53] about seeing things like that, Brother
[43:55] Jeremy. I can think of a bunch of things
[43:57] that I can send you and help you work
[43:59] out with. And uh and I also saw one
[44:02] other thing that he might need some help
[44:04] with on the screen. Proof readers. So,
[44:06] uh, be sure you can do that, too. Well,
[44:08] we, uh, got some exciting news, as
[44:10] Brother Ed was saying, uh, about things
[44:13] that are taking place over in China
[44:14] right now. And, uh, it's, uh, it's
[44:18] really remarkable what God is doing. I
[44:20] want you to see this right here. You,
[44:23] uh, get these video cameras on here. I
[44:26] can't spread them all out, but what
[44:28] you're looking at here
[44:30] is the largest single printing in one
[44:34] time ever done of the message in China.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; This is 33 books, 2,000 copies each.
[44:43] 66,000 books were just printed. And
[44:46] these are the evidence right here.
[44:49] Glory to God.
[44:51] Amen.
[44:54] Hallelujah.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; And not only that, but we got some value
[44:59] here. Anybody want to venture a guess at
[45:01] what it would cost to print just one of
[45:03] these books? Well, minds are rolling,
[45:08] I'm sure, and figures are calculating.
[45:10] We could do it for 9 cents a book.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; So, 9 cents a book puts that message in
[45:16] their hand. And like we said, we got 33
[45:19] titles. uh titles like uh faith is a
[45:22] substance, why we're not a denomination,
[45:24] taking side with Jesus, end time
[45:26] evangelism, warning and judgment, God's
[45:28] gift find their places, unveiling of
[45:31] God, masterpiece, paradox, God rich in
[45:33] mercy, lean not to your own
[45:34] understanding, broken sisters, a man
[45:36] running from the presence of God, uh
[45:37] does God ever change his mind about his
[45:39] word, anointing ones of the end time,
[45:40] God of this evil age, thirst, invisible
[45:42] union, works as faith expressed, trying
[45:44] to do God a service without doing his
[45:45] will. I've heard, but now I see on the
[45:47] wings of a dove and many more.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it is very, very
[45:51] exciting. Now, not only not only is a
[45:54] stack of books like this an achievement,
[45:56] but you see the uh the math on this as
[45:59] well is very, very important because if
[46:01] you got 66,000 books at about 9 cents a
[46:04] book, you accounts have probably got it
[46:06] figured out already, but for those of
[46:07] you a little slower like me, that works
[46:09] out to over $6,000. All right. Now you
[46:13] remember probably the testimony of uh of
[46:16] when we come back from China in
[46:18] September and had the meetings and so
[46:19] forth there and how we were led to be
[46:22] able to speak about you know the uh the
[46:24] vision that God has in his mind of the
[46:27] word going into different places. And
[46:29] you might recall how I said that here we
[46:31] had brother Brandham standing on the
[46:32] west coast of America and pointing
[46:34] further west and he said if the gospel
[46:36] goes any further west it goes back to
[46:38] the east. And we were speaking about how
[46:40] that in the mind of God was the bride of
[46:44] Christ that was in China
[46:47] &gt;&gt; at that time there was nobody there.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; And so 30 40 years later here now we
[46:52] find a people and these and these
[46:54] believers when they began to to realize
[46:57] that hey this was all happening for me.
[47:00] It was spoke 40ome years ago and now I'm
[47:03] here. I'm a fulfillment of this. And
[47:05] when they began to realize that they
[47:08] have a part in this vision and began to
[47:10] see their aspect and their part in
[47:13] spreading this word out and that there's
[47:15] other places for it to go to, that's
[47:17] when they began to rise to the occasion
[47:19] to be able to support the printing and
[47:22] be able to support their own people of
[47:24] going out and spreading this message.
[47:26] And so for the value of this printing
[47:28] over $6,000 as a result of those
[47:31] meetings, 30 over 30% of the cost of
[47:35] printing these books was raised right in
[47:37] China.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Right in China.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; That's how they're coming up already.
[47:43] And you uh I I I trust everybody's had a
[47:46] copy of this. Who has read this uh faith
[47:49] challenge report?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; All right. And who didn't read it yet?
[47:55] Ah, all right. We'll uh we'll pass a few
[47:58] out to uh we won't call any names here,
[48:00] but uh uh you read in here about China
[48:03] and you'll see why we had a little title
[48:05] on it. Moving from Corinthians to the
[48:08] Ephesians, because not only have they
[48:10] paid for this, this was just recently
[48:12] done, but we just got another email that
[48:15] uh they have already collected another
[48:17] $3,000 US for the next printing.
[48:21] That's outstanding, folks. I've been
[48:23] working with brother Ed for over 15
[48:25] years in these countries uh various
[48:28] countries around the world in in
[48:30] different places and I tell you what it
[48:32] it probably take the aggregate sum total
[48:34] of 10 years of their offerings to come
[48:36] up with the amount that has been put
[48:38] into printing this one and the other
[48:39] offering that they've already collected
[48:41] in just a few years in China. So indeed
[48:43] that shows a maturity because you know
[48:45] when you understand and you got a
[48:46] revelation that you know your father
[48:48] owns everything and it's just a matter
[48:51] of a of a renewable resource you know
[48:53] directing some funds here to this son or
[48:55] that son or whatever and you can't
[48:56] outgive God and and whatever you put in
[48:59] you know uh he's going to return it back
[49:01] &gt;&gt; and when you got that revelation it's
[49:03] it's just easy to give it
[49:06] &gt;&gt; and the poor souls that don't got that
[49:07] revelation you try and hang on to every
[49:09] penny and guess what you're the loser
[49:12] anyhow.
[49:13] So anyway, that's just a tremendous
[49:15] thing that's happening over in China and
[49:17] uh and of course in conjunction with
[49:19] that. Uh we've got some other slides
[49:21] here that we're just going to get ready
[49:22] for. So you brothers get ready for that.
[49:24] Uh but in addition, we've also been
[49:26] speaking to you about a search u search
[49:29] engine project uh of the software uh
[49:33] that uh is being designed. It's already
[49:35] designed for the Chinese language to
[49:37] search every word that the prophet would
[49:39] have spoke about a certain subject in a
[49:41] in a paragraph and on down. And so that
[49:44] uh software is completed. So we thank
[49:46] God for that. And uh they're in the
[49:49] process of loading. They've got about a
[49:51] quarter of the messages loaded out of
[49:53] the 222 messages that are now
[49:55] translated. And you remember, you know,
[49:57] 222 messages translated in in less than
[50:01] five years. I was shocked the other day
[50:04] when I learned that uh uh that uh uh
[50:07] there's uh uh you know less than 130
[50:10] messages in Spanish available through uh
[50:13] Voice of God recordings and that's been
[50:14] for years and years and years. And I
[50:16] know they're doing a great work and
[50:17] everything, but you just compare the two
[50:19] now 222 messages in less than 5 years.
[50:22] And so you see the the urgency of it
[50:24] all. And so I just want to take a moment
[50:26] also to share a few slides with you. And
[50:29] unfortunately uh we haven't really
[50:31] doctorred these pictures. They just came
[50:33] in today. So I'm going to have to ask uh
[50:36] uh forgiveness on the part of those who
[50:38] are streaming by video and ask all the
[50:40] video cameras just to stay right here.
[50:42] Don't show the screen please stay right
[50:44] on me and so that then the uh local
[50:46] congregation can see here. And uh so we
[50:49] got the first slide uh
[50:53] uh the uh first slide is showing the
[50:56] place the two red dots there in
[50:59] southwestern China where we have brother
[51:02] Ivan over in China right now. Oh thank
[51:06] you Jess. And so you see these two red
[51:08] dots here and brother Ivan has gone to
[51:11] these places and um and he has been
[51:14] witnessing there. Next slide. And you'll
[51:17] see a sister here. Her name is Sister
[51:20] Bi. And Sister B was in a church that
[51:25] Ivan went to visit when he was in this
[51:28] uh particular city in southwest China.
[51:30] And uh uh in 2004, he met her. He
[51:34] witnessed to her. And this sister by is
[51:37] a very well-known popular woman
[51:40] preacher. She was. And uh and when Ivan
[51:44] met her, he began to witness to her and
[51:47] spoke to her about the message and
[51:48] things. And as a result of that witness
[51:51] of that testimony and the books that she
[51:53] received like this Chinese books uh that
[51:57] sister by she resigned her post as a
[52:00] woman preacher and submitted herself to
[52:02] the word of God which immediately caught
[52:04] the attention of a lot of people and her
[52:06] her family like her her u her father and
[52:09] her mother-in-law was also a great
[52:11] renowned home church preacher in
[52:13] southwest China and so when she resigned
[52:16] and and be and submitted herself to the
[52:18] word. Then her mother-in-law also
[52:20] received the word. And uh and so the the
[52:23] story the testimony goes on that her
[52:26] father-in-law was was smitten with a
[52:29] stroke. He was totally paralyzed. And uh
[52:32] and yet she had a faith in God that a
[52:35] prayer of of a righteous man like
[52:38] brother Ivan who had a had a revelation
[52:40] of this message and the power of God was
[52:42] in him would avail much for her
[52:44] father-in-law. And so he took she took
[52:47] brother Ivan to the hospital and brother
[52:49] Ivan he uh he prayed for her
[52:52] father-in-law and he was miraculously
[52:54] healed.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; And so as a result of that testimony
[52:59] uh then he gave his heart to the Lord
[53:02] and then it began to uh affect others
[53:04] there in that city. And so we have now
[53:08] uh a testimony and we're going to show
[53:09] you the slides here. Next one is brother
[53:12] Ivan. He's speaking to these people in
[53:14] this city. You can read the city's name
[53:16] up there. And uh this is in southwest
[53:18] China. And these are the believers now
[53:21] that are being prepared for baptism. And
[53:24] you see the next slide.
[53:26] Baptism number one. Baptism number two.
[53:29] Next slide. Sister going in. Number
[53:31] three.
[53:34] Then number four.
[53:37] And number five.
[53:39] And number six.
[53:41] and number seven.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[53:46] Next slide.
[53:48] Next slide, please.
[53:50] Next slide, please. There's a
[53:52] congregation in that southwest China uh
[53:55] city there. So, uh you can see a little
[53:58] home church getting started there. And
[54:00] uh we want to be able to pray that God
[54:02] would raise up laborers to uh give those
[54:04] folks some some leadership there. And uh
[54:07] so, uh brother brother Ivan is there as
[54:10] you can see him. and his uh
[54:13] where's no she's not in this picture.
[54:15] His dear wife. So next slide. Now we see
[54:18] see brother Ivan uh having some more
[54:20] Bible studies in another city. You see
[54:22] the name there. Next slide. And uh here
[54:24] they are studying the word of God. I'm
[54:27] sure some of these folks haven't had
[54:28] much access to the Bibles, but now you
[54:30] see them reading them. Next slide. And u
[54:33] here we see brother Ivan on the way to
[54:36] uh to a baptism at the lake. And uh next
[54:39] slide.
[54:40] You see here um this uh this brother in
[54:44] the middle with the glasses on here. He
[54:47] uh he was an English school teacher. And
[54:50] uh this English school teacher um his
[54:53] father one day just suddenly died and it
[54:56] really shocked him had a profound effect
[54:58] upon him. And he began thinking about
[55:00] life and death and so forth. And so he
[55:02] began searching in Buddhism and he
[55:04] didn't find nothing there hanging in the
[55:06] air. reincarnation just didn't seem to
[55:08] to meet the deep within his heart. And
[55:10] so he began searching for uh truth in
[55:13] Christian circles, Christian websites
[55:15] and books and different things. And
[55:16] that's where he he found an introduction
[55:19] to the to the gospel and he joined a
[55:21] Pentecostal church. And later on because
[55:23] of sister by remember she used to be a
[55:26] preacher and she would preach and he
[55:28] would hear her when she stepped down and
[55:30] and he heard about it he wanted to find
[55:33] out what are you doing? What are you
[55:34] believing now? And as a result of that
[55:36] testimony of sister B, this brother
[55:38] received the message and u and now you
[55:41] see him and then we got three others
[55:44] that were baptized there. One, two,
[55:45] three slides, please.
[55:47] There you go. There he is. Baptized.
[55:50] Another one
[55:52] &gt;&gt; and a third one.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Three more. Last slide all together.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; There all together added together. So we
[56:01] thank God for that. Amen. So, uh, we
[56:03] praise him for those wonderful
[56:05] testimonies, the effects of the word
[56:08] going out that you're a part of. And,
[56:10] uh, I also just want to make sure that
[56:11] you remember brother Timothy Ma, who's
[56:14] also in, uh, in Vietnam. We want to
[56:17] continue to remember him in prayer. And
[56:19] I also just want you to know as well
[56:21] that the uh, the Brazil CD uh,
[56:24] instrumental CD, it's now available.
[56:26] It's ready in the office. And if you've
[56:28] got that clip ready, Brother Darren,
[56:29] just play a little bit. All right? So
[56:31] you can hear it. It tells you about it
[56:33] in the faith challenge report.
[56:36] [Music]
[56:49] [Music]
[56:56] Yes. This whole CD is just about like
[56:59] that.
[57:01] And you can have this CD. We just put a
[57:04] simple price on it of $10. The brothers
[57:06] did to help support 20 10 books. But
[57:09] just think if you had this CD playing
[57:13] just time, every time a song went
[57:15] around, you'd be thinking, I sponsored
[57:18] another book in Portuguese in Brazil.
[57:21] So, if you want to, you know, uh, avail
[57:23] yourself of this little blessing, uh,
[57:25] you can, uh, make sure you get one at
[57:26] the, uh, uh, put your order into Sister
[57:28] Debbie and, uh, if you, uh, want to pay
[57:32] $100 for one CD and print that many more
[57:34] books, we'll be glad to make sure that
[57:37] those books got printed on your behalf.
[57:38] So, God bless you. Thank you very much.
[57:41] the red.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Tony's taking up offerings like he come
[57:50] from Tennessee.
[57:57] Well, I'm going to be brief. Uh, Brother
[58:00] Diddy said, "Give me your watch." And I
[58:03] said, "Well, no, we'll uh I'm just going
[58:05] to we're going to go into the word a
[58:08] little bit, but I'm not going to keep
[58:09] you long long." And uh what we don't go
[58:12] through tonight, we'll just pick up on
[58:13] Sunday morning. But some of you that
[58:16] were here, I was I had some some of my
[58:18] family say one of these brothers from
[58:21] Africa was he's standing up. They he
[58:24] said he couldn't get sitted down. He's
[58:26] just standing up through most of the
[58:28] service and and they said he was saying
[58:30] a word kandaba. Coupandava. And nobody
[58:34] knows what it was meaning. Then he say
[58:37] three * 7 kendava.
[58:40] He couldn't say it enough so he just
[58:41] said 3 * 7.
[58:44] So we had brother Alons and in fact his
[58:47] brother Alance has been here over a
[58:49] month a month and 3 weeks and he's got
[58:51] to go back to Congo on on Saturday. my
[58:55] we we so appreciate him coming and he's
[58:57] been a blessing to the church even
[58:59] though we don't he doesn't probably want
[59:01] us to say anything about it but he's
[59:02] been a blessing to the church and uh so
[59:05] I said what what does that mean brother
[59:07] did wasn't too sure he said well it's an
[59:10] African language he says kandaba means
[59:13] keep it coming more keep it coming more
[59:17] and more and he couldn't say it fast
[59:18] enough so he said three * 7 kendaba so
[59:26] They have a way of saying it.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And our brother was here and God is
[59:30] honoring him. He was here with all seven
[59:32] of his children and his wife. And right
[59:34] after the service Sunday,
[59:37] uh his wife came to brother Dier and
[59:40] said, "I'd like some of the message
[59:41] books in French."
[59:43] He said, "She's very close to the
[59:45] kingdom." Oh my. We just, you know, this
[59:48] been this this whole evening's almost
[59:50] been just a rejoicing evening. but what
[59:52] God has done. Why don't we just stand
[59:54] for uh just a moment and I'm going to
[59:57] turn to John 14.
[59:59] I also have some slides that I'm going
[1:00:02] to be showing in a little bit. Uh
[1:00:06] and let's just have prayer before we
[1:00:08] read.
[1:00:10] Our dear father in heaven, how we
[1:00:13] rejoice tonight. Uh it's just more than
[1:00:17] we can take in. We hear of the saints in
[1:00:20] China. Oh God, bless these uh uh young
[1:00:24] ones that have just come into the
[1:00:26] kingdom. Bless them immensely. Father,
[1:00:29] bless brother Ivan. Oh God, be with his
[1:00:32] mouth. I pray. Oh God, may he speak. May
[1:00:35] he instruct by the direct in by the
[1:00:38] direct uh motivation and movement of the
[1:00:41] Holy Spirit. Be with our brother
[1:00:43] Timothy. Oh God, I pray you'll direct
[1:00:45] his footsteps, keep him from danger,
[1:00:48] keep him from harm, keep him safe, keep
[1:00:50] him healthy, and anoint him mightily. I
[1:00:53] pray, oh God. And what we pray for them,
[1:00:55] we pray for ourselves here tonight,
[1:00:57] Lord, bless these people, this
[1:00:59] congregation that has come, all who are
[1:01:02] listening on the internet and streaming.
[1:01:04] I pray you'll bless the witness of Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ that's going out. Use every
[1:01:09] instrument, Lord. Use every one of us as
[1:01:11] witnesses and ye shall be witnesses,
[1:01:14] says the says the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:01:16] we accept that with all of our heart and
[1:01:18] soul, Lord. I pray you'll prosper us
[1:01:20] greatly in this last moment of time in
[1:01:24] the name of Jesus Christ. Anoint now,
[1:01:26] Lord, both speaker and hearers. And your
[1:01:28] word, I pray to our hearts. May it fall
[1:01:31] in good ground and bring forth a
[1:01:34] hundfold. I pray in Jesus Christ that
[1:01:37] that name may be glorified. Glorify
[1:01:40] yourself, oh God. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:01:43] Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Out of John 14, I'm just going to
[1:01:49] read from verse five.
[1:01:52] Thomas sith unto him, Lord, we know not
[1:01:55] whether thou goest, and how can we know
[1:01:58] the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am
[1:02:02] the way, the truth, and the life. No man
[1:02:06] cometh unto the Father but by me. If you
[1:02:09] had known me, you should have known my
[1:02:12] Father also. And from henceforth you
[1:02:15] know him and have seen him. And Philip
[1:02:18] said unto him,Lord, show us the Father,
[1:02:23] and it sufficeth us. You remember the
[1:02:26] messages that have been preached? Show
[1:02:28] us the father. That was very striking
[1:02:31] and perhaps I'll get into that on
[1:02:33] Sunday. Uh I might just touch on it
[1:02:35] tonight. Show us the father and it
[1:02:39] sufficeth us. It satisfies us. There's
[1:02:42] no more question once you show us the
[1:02:45] father. See, show us the father and it
[1:02:48] sufficeth us. And Jesus saith unto him,
[1:02:52] Have I been so long time with you, and
[1:02:55] yet hast thou not known me, Phillip? He
[1:02:59] that hath seen me hath seen the Father.
[1:03:03] And how sayest thou then, show us the
[1:03:05] Father? Amen. You may be seated.
[1:03:08] We're living in great times.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; As I said, Sunday, just a couple of
[1:03:14] phrases that might seem similar.
[1:03:17] It's quite possible to be looking at
[1:03:18] something and not know exactly what it
[1:03:20] is that you're looking at. You two
[1:03:23] people can look at the same object and
[1:03:25] it's it can be different for both
[1:03:27] people. Brother Lonnie Jenkins, I'll
[1:03:29] never forget him saying that, you know,
[1:03:31] the message is like a mountain and on
[1:03:33] one side you just see a rag real rugged
[1:03:37] craggy rock face and on the other side
[1:03:41] perhaps sloping down into alpine uh
[1:03:45] pastures and beautiful uh you know
[1:03:49] alpine country with the flowers and the
[1:03:51] grass and and one is saying, "Oh, when I
[1:03:53] see it, I just see something so
[1:03:55] beautiful and wonderful and and so on."
[1:03:57] and they describe it and the other
[1:03:59] person describes the same message but
[1:04:01] sees it quite differently from a
[1:04:03] different side but it's the same word.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way that's the way
[1:04:08] it can be. Now uh Philip says show us
[1:04:13] the father. And then Jesus said and I'll
[1:04:16] show the first slide please. Show us the
[1:04:19] father. Yet hast thou not known me,
[1:04:23] Phillip. And uh Greek here for known.
[1:04:29] Uh
[1:04:31] let's just carry on to the next one.
[1:04:33] Please put them all up. To learn to
[1:04:36] know,
[1:04:37] to get a knowledge of and to understand.
[1:04:42] Now the next slide.
[1:04:44] He that hath he that hath seen me hath
[1:04:48] seen the father. I've been speaking on
[1:04:50] the prophet optics. He that hath seen me
[1:04:52] hath seen the father. And listen
[1:04:55] friends, a lot of people talk about god
[1:04:57] mill untold millions
[1:05:00] uh multiplied millions say the prayer.
[1:05:05] Our Lord's prayer. They call it the
[1:05:07] Lord's prayer. Our father the first
[1:05:10] words our father which are in heaven.
[1:05:13] But I'll say a person needs prophet
[1:05:15] optics to really understand what our
[1:05:19] father is all about. And I hope that I
[1:05:23] hope that these services are even will
[1:05:25] enrichen and deepen your understanding
[1:05:28] of it. He that has seen me hath seen the
[1:05:31] father. And to see hath seen the father
[1:05:35] or properly to stare at. We said it
[1:05:38] Sunday. I believe it needs repeating. to
[1:05:41] stare at. I mean, it's something that
[1:05:44] needs to be looked at. He that has seen
[1:05:47] me. Well, we don't see him in his
[1:05:49] physical form, but we see him in his
[1:05:52] word form to stare at the word. And
[1:05:56] you'll never look at it too much
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; in your lifetime. You'll never look at
[1:06:02] it too much. And the more you look at
[1:06:04] it, the more effect it will have on you.
[1:06:07] The more you look at it, the more it'll
[1:06:10] direct your footsteps in your thinking.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; He that has seen me hath seen the
[1:06:16] father. To see with the eyes,
[1:06:22] to see with the mind, to perceive,
[1:06:25] and to become acquainted with by
[1:06:28] experience. Now notice this next. We're
[1:06:30] continuing on with seen. Note that this
[1:06:33] word gives prominence to the discerning
[1:06:37] mind when the physical physical temporal
[1:06:42] material
[1:06:43] side recedes.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; You can never have the temporal up here.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That you can never have the temporal as
[1:06:52] the consuming part of your life and
[1:06:54] expect to come to know and see as Jesus
[1:06:58] is talking about. He that hath seen me
[1:07:01] hath seen the father, but we can't see
[1:07:04] him. And we're talking about seeing him
[1:07:06] in word form. We can't see him as we
[1:07:10] ought to see him if the temporal is what
[1:07:13] is uh has the foremost place in our
[1:07:16] life. The temporal or the physical side
[1:07:20] needs to recede. And then this word
[1:07:23] denotes perception in general as
[1:07:27] resulting principally from vision. The
[1:07:30] prominence being in the mental element.
[1:07:33] So it's something uh that is it is
[1:07:36] something that is not with our just our
[1:07:39] natural physical eyes. Now I I want to
[1:07:44] I I'm going to go to uh uh a slide in
[1:07:49] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:07:55] A little quicker with the slides,
[1:07:56] please.
[1:07:58] The next slide.
[1:08:01] God has had a three-fold purpose in this
[1:08:05] great mystery secret.
[1:08:08] Now this is in Christ is the mystery of
[1:08:10] God revealed. God in his great mystery
[1:08:14] secret that he had before the world
[1:08:17] began.
[1:08:19] He's got a three-fold purpose in it. And
[1:08:22] we want to find out what this three-fold
[1:08:25] purpose is. We just will stop there for
[1:08:26] a moment.
[1:08:28] I even this afternoon I was trying to
[1:08:32] get a little bit of rest but my my mind
[1:08:34] my whole being seemed so consumed and I
[1:08:39] I I just allowed my uh consciousness to
[1:08:44] try to grasp the greatness of God and of
[1:08:47] course we can't but a God that fills all
[1:08:51] time and space and in this message the
[1:08:55] prophet says you could go for hundreds
[1:08:57] hundreds of millions of years, light
[1:08:59] years off into the affinity. And God
[1:09:02] fills all of that. And he's all of that.
[1:09:05] And he still is.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; He's all of that.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; And when I think of that, when I really
[1:09:11] give serious thought to that, I I I said
[1:09:15] to myself this afternoon,
[1:09:18] what is all humanity?
[1:09:20] What are all these creeping creatures
[1:09:24] creeping over the face of the earth?
[1:09:26] What are they to a god like that when
[1:09:28] this whole earth that we're on is almost
[1:09:31] an inescernable speck in the universe?
[1:09:35] What what is what is all of humanity?
[1:09:38] And with all of humanity, what am I?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; As just one person creeping over the
[1:09:44] face of the earth, as the prophet said,
[1:09:46] on the brittle threads of time, what how
[1:09:49] could that God even be conscious or
[1:09:52] aware? And then I began to I began to
[1:09:55] quote to myself, for God so loved the
[1:10:00] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:10:03] that whosoever believeth in him will not
[1:10:07] perish but will have everlasting life.
[1:10:09] And I say, God, the only hope I have of
[1:10:12] putting myself right there in that
[1:10:15] scripture, you're so great, I can't even
[1:10:18] begin to capture with my mind. My
[1:10:21] imagination can't even do it. You can
[1:10:24] imagine almost limitless things, but I
[1:10:27] can't even imagine the greatness of this
[1:10:29] God. And then for me to think that that
[1:10:32] God who fills all time and space has
[1:10:35] somehow is conscious of me as an
[1:10:38] individual and us here as individuals
[1:10:40] here tonight. I can say only one thing
[1:10:43] only believe.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; We have no other chance. There's nothing
[1:10:48] that we can do beyond just believing. We
[1:10:51] couldn't merit anything. We couldn't do
[1:10:54] anything. We couldn't live long enough
[1:10:56] if we lived for a million years because
[1:10:58] God's timeless. and I can't grasp
[1:11:01] eternity. And here we are for this
[1:11:03] little breath of time in our life. No
[1:11:06] wonder the no wonder David could say,
[1:11:09] "What is man that thou art mindful of
[1:11:12] him?" Or the son of man that thou
[1:11:14] visitest him. Oh, what is your life?
[1:11:17] It's even as a vapor that appearth for a
[1:11:19] little while and then it gone. It just
[1:11:22] vanishes. It disappears. And otherwise,
[1:11:25] man would be like an animal. just die,
[1:11:28] live here for a short time and and uh uh
[1:11:31] have some action and and uh uh have some
[1:11:33] expression of life and then just die and
[1:11:35] go to the soil. Oh, I thank God there's
[1:11:38] something down in here that tells me
[1:11:40] there's more to it.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's more to it. God has
[1:11:46] a purpose. And I say our lives, my
[1:11:48] brother, my sister, if the temporal is
[1:11:50] out forefront, we're going to be sad one
[1:11:52] day. we're going to be regretful one day
[1:11:55] that we didn't give more time and give
[1:11:58] more of our thought and more of our
[1:12:00] energy, more of our concentration. I'm
[1:12:03] not talking about we don't have to work.
[1:12:04] We do have to work. But I'm talking we'd
[1:12:06] have God on our mind. We can have
[1:12:09] eternity on our mind. We can have heaven
[1:12:11] on our mind. And I say we want to be
[1:12:14] heavenly minded.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to find out what this
[1:12:19] three-fold purpose was. Next slide,
[1:12:21] please. The first thing, the first
[1:12:24] thing,
[1:12:26] friends,
[1:12:29] when I think of the kind of messenger
[1:12:33] and we don't cringe at all when we say
[1:12:35] when God gave us a messenger that he
[1:12:38] gave us in brother Brandham.
[1:12:41] Now, he is a man.
[1:12:43] He said, "It's not me. I'm your brother.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I couldn't do anything until he comes."
[1:12:49] So we're now I'm talking about this God,
[1:12:52] but that God chose to use that vessel
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; and reach off into the eternities and
[1:12:59] have angels come from the eternities in
[1:13:02] a instant of time and begin to open up
[1:13:06] the word what we're saying. Begin to
[1:13:08] make known uh to him Christ, Jesus
[1:13:12] Christ, so he could make the bridegroom
[1:13:15] known to the bride. It's wedding time,
[1:13:18] friends. It's marriage time and that's
[1:13:22] when a bride and the bridegroom have to
[1:13:24] know one another. It can't be some
[1:13:26] nebulous generality out here that I
[1:13:30] think and I hope and I you know I'm not
[1:13:32] too sure had to come specifically and
[1:13:35] take the veil off of him and say here he
[1:13:38] is
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; love him
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; or turn away from him
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; and many turned away even saying they
[1:13:45] loved him like Judas did with a kiss.
[1:13:48] Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; The first thing now you take this kind
[1:13:53] of a messenger and he says the first
[1:13:56] thing in one place in this message
[1:13:58] Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[1:13:59] says this the mystery the secret that
[1:14:02] God had way in the back part of his mind
[1:14:05] and I I take that literally. God allowed
[1:14:08] this servant, God allowed him to peer
[1:14:11] into the back part of his mind and to
[1:14:14] catch the secret that God had and bring
[1:14:18] it forward. And now when he says the
[1:14:20] first thing
[1:14:22] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[1:14:25] his people. Do you know that that phrase
[1:14:28] even is the essence of the name of God?
[1:14:31] The the self-existent one who
[1:14:34] continuously
[1:14:36] continuously reveals himself. That's
[1:14:40] what his name means.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And here it is saying God wanted that's
[1:14:45] the first thing he wanted to reveal
[1:14:47] himself to the people. He couldn't do it
[1:14:50] as a great Jehovah God who covered all
[1:14:53] space, time, and eternity. He could not.
[1:14:56] He's too great to ever be revealed to
[1:14:59] people because it would be too
[1:15:02] mysterious.
[1:15:05] He loved fatherhood. And I have it as a
[1:15:08] title because now that's we're
[1:15:10] continuing on with this quote.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He loved fatherhood
[1:15:16] for he was a father.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He had no son.
[1:15:23] Way back in the eternities, he had no
[1:15:25] son.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; But he loved fatherhood.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; And the only way that he could express
[1:15:32] it was to become a son of man.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; He couldn't do it as the great Jehovah
[1:15:39] of the Old Testament. He had to become a
[1:15:42] son of man. And that's the reason Jesus
[1:15:45] kept saying the son of man. The son of
[1:15:48] man. Kept referring to himself as the
[1:15:50] son of man. And they didn't know what he
[1:15:53] was saying uh talking about many of
[1:15:55] them. But now now he's talking about now
[1:15:58] you get it. And you see in the Old
[1:16:00] Testament notice now in the Old
[1:16:02] Testament
[1:16:04] there wasn't none of the prophets none
[1:16:06] of the men of God the seers the sages
[1:16:09] and the patriarchs. No one said I'm a
[1:16:12] son of God.
[1:16:13] You say it readily today. I'm a son. I'm
[1:16:16] a daughter of God. They didn't say it
[1:16:18] like that. And the reason that they took
[1:16:22] up stones to stone Jesus was because he
[1:16:25] inferred he was the son of God.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He said, and when he said, I and my
[1:16:30] father are one, then the Bible says,
[1:16:34] then took they up stones to stone him.
[1:16:37] That was the key phrase when I and my
[1:16:40] father are one. And brother Brandham
[1:16:41] brings that phrase and makes that the
[1:16:43] phrase of distinction
[1:16:45] along with except you eat my flesh and
[1:16:47] drink my blood. But when he said when he
[1:16:50] put forward this absolute oneness with
[1:16:53] God, then took they up stones to stone
[1:16:56] him.
[1:17:00] Now a father,
[1:17:04] I'll just read this one then I'll just
[1:17:06] hold the slide if you would. Then
[1:17:09] but while he thought on these things,
[1:17:11] behold the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:17:14] unto him. That's Joseph. And saying,
[1:17:16] Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to
[1:17:20] take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that
[1:17:22] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[1:17:26] Ghost. and then
[1:17:29] uh in the position as a son and father
[1:17:34] relationship because God then uh in in
[1:17:37] Matthew 3:17 and lo a voice from heaven
[1:17:41] saying this is my beloved son in whom I
[1:17:45] am well pleased. Now now God is making
[1:17:48] this very definitive. This is my son in
[1:17:53] whom I am well pleased.
[1:17:56] that which is conceived in her is of the
[1:18:00] Holy Ghost.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; And and now, Brother Brandham speaking
[1:18:04] to the uh Christian, not the Christian
[1:18:06] businessmen, but the ministers in
[1:18:08] Chicago, God had explained saying if God
[1:18:12] was his father, he asked the ministers,
[1:18:15] all those ministers turned into Matthew
[1:18:18] and how does it read? He said, and then
[1:18:21] they read this, which is conceived in
[1:18:23] her is of the Holy Ghost. Now you have
[1:18:26] the the you know you have the second
[1:18:28] person uh uh conceiving the third person
[1:18:32] or father son and holy ghost the the
[1:18:34] third person conceiving the second
[1:18:36] person if they are persons which isn't
[1:18:38] the case it just can't be possible and
[1:18:40] so and and so God saying this is my
[1:18:44] beloved son in whom I am well pleased
[1:18:47] God identifying I am his father
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; and he is my son
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; yesmen
[1:18:55] No question.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; So, so obviously the Holy Ghost that
[1:19:01] conceived
[1:19:02] he was conceived of the Holy Ghost. Now
[1:19:08] um
[1:19:11] the next slide please from this quote.
[1:19:15] When God
[1:19:18] condescended,
[1:19:21] this is in he swore by himself. When God
[1:19:24] condescended and overshadowed Virgin
[1:19:27] Mary, he was alive. I want to just stop
[1:19:30] there for a moment.
[1:19:32] Please catch this. Let let your minds
[1:19:34] absorb it. We're not going to go real
[1:19:36] quick, but I'd like to cover some
[1:19:38] ground. He was alive.
[1:19:41] This God is is not some kind of a uh you
[1:19:45] know that that spills all time and space
[1:19:48] and whatever kind of concept a person
[1:19:50] may have or however your mind may try to
[1:19:53] grasp but whatever you envision there's
[1:19:55] one thing for sure he was alive.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; He was alive.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Not just some living thing but he was
[1:20:03] alive. He is alive and and a life
[1:20:08] overshadowed and created a blood cell
[1:20:12] around itself. I'd like to just stop
[1:20:14] there and I I made just a brief
[1:20:16] reference of this on Sunday, but I want
[1:20:18] to try to take you into how God has been
[1:20:21] dealing with me going back just a moment
[1:20:24] as I said trying to grasp this God. And
[1:20:27] I I I actually, you know, I just uh I
[1:20:32] pondered and pondered isn't strong
[1:20:34] enough word. I was lost in thought. I I
[1:20:37] was struggling if it might be. I wasn't
[1:20:40] struggling for an answer. I was
[1:20:41] struggling to go deep enough trying to
[1:20:45] grasp this God.
[1:20:47] It fills all time and space. And
[1:20:50] someplace in the affinity of eternity,
[1:20:54] God conceived in his mind a substance
[1:20:59] that would one day by his word become
[1:21:02] blood.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was that is so
[1:21:08] indescribably
[1:21:10] and incomprehensible.
[1:21:12] He he conceived the substance of blood.
[1:21:16] And we we aren't scientific enough here
[1:21:19] and I certainly am not
[1:21:22] to to try to begin to describe to you
[1:21:25] this substance that man studies this
[1:21:29] blood. this blood that has uh uh that
[1:21:33] has capability to coagulate and if you
[1:21:36] cut yourself and this blood that gets
[1:21:38] maybe too thick or is a carrier of
[1:21:41] cholesterol good and bad and whatever
[1:21:43] more and it's got all kinds of things
[1:21:45] and and and can be a carrier of disease
[1:21:48] and so on. Brother Brandon was talking
[1:21:50] about two two late young women. They
[1:21:53] were twins and in his meetings and they
[1:21:56] were going blind
[1:21:58] and they didn't know why they were going
[1:22:00] blind and they took blood tests and
[1:22:03] found they had a veneerial disease but
[1:22:06] they were both as pure as they could be.
[1:22:09] They were absolutely pure morally but
[1:22:12] they had a the blood showed up. that had
[1:22:14] a venerial disease and they traced it
[1:22:17] back and found out that it was their
[1:22:20] greatgrandfather
[1:22:21] that had a veneerial disease and came
[1:22:24] down through the bloodstream and both of
[1:22:26] those girls had it. The blood had
[1:22:30] carried it. Now, God knew all about
[1:22:32] this. God knew about bloodlines. He knew
[1:22:35] all about this blood. And he also knew
[1:22:38] that Satan would try and use that
[1:22:41] serpent being that was there who had the
[1:22:44] only seed that would mingle in in in
[1:22:48] Eve's womb.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; And it was a blood sin
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; and it needed a blood sacrifice. And I'm
[1:23:00] so glad tonight that God created a blood
[1:23:03] sacrifice for our sins. Hallelujah.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; We were born contaminated.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; The blood you were born with had you had
[1:23:13] a sinful life.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And I don't care. You could take you
[1:23:17] could have uh taken yourself into the
[1:23:19] mountains and never saw an evil thing,
[1:23:21] never heard an evil word, never was
[1:23:23] associated with anybody evil, and you're
[1:23:26] still a sinner. Prophet said, "You are
[1:23:28] born condemned."
[1:23:30] Every one of us, there's nothing good in
[1:23:32] us. We're born condemned. Hallelujah. by
[1:23:35] that blood that came. I'm glad I was
[1:23:37] born condemned so I could be saved.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was born bound so I could
[1:23:43] be set free. Once like a bird in prison,
[1:23:46] I dwelt. Hallelujah. But he set me free.
[1:23:51] He set us free. How did he set us free?
[1:23:53] Not just by some excitement, not just by
[1:23:56] some preacher, but because he created
[1:23:58] another blood stream and he placed it in
[1:24:02] you by his own word. Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; The word that created it put it in you.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you got another life in
[1:24:11] you.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And that life that's in you was the same
[1:24:14] life that was in the blood of Jesus
[1:24:16] Christ.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; The same blood. The same life. God was
[1:24:22] alive.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And that life fastened itself to a wall
[1:24:30] of a womb. Hallelujah. Satan took the
[1:24:34] mind of Eve and God took the womb of of
[1:24:37] of uh Mary
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; to bring back
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; to the same way that Satan brought and
[1:24:45] condemned the world. God was going to
[1:24:48] reverse the whole thing of blood sin in
[1:24:51] Eden and blood righteousness. He created
[1:24:54] a new blood.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And there never was a man
[1:24:58] that walked like this man. There wasn't
[1:25:00] never a man that spoke like this Jesus
[1:25:03] Christ. There never was a man who lived
[1:25:05] the life that he lived because he had
[1:25:07] that life. But he said that life was not
[1:25:09] for himself. Prophet said when he
[1:25:12] resurrected from the dead, was he only
[1:25:14] the beneficiary of that resurrection?
[1:25:16] No. You were beneficiaries as well.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; We have that life.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish this was Sunday.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I'd carry on.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:30] God loved fatherhood.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; He wanted to be a father.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And even though we came and we're
[1:25:37] rebellious and we kicked against God and
[1:25:40] we kicked against the pricks like Paul
[1:25:42] did and we went and blundered in our own
[1:25:45] way. Yet the love of God because he
[1:25:48] loved fatherhood. He he pre-ordained he
[1:25:51] forordained. He predestinated and he
[1:25:54] declared you're going to be my son
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; and you're going to be my daughter. And
[1:25:59] there's nothing you can do about it.
[1:26:01] I've chosen you before the foundation of
[1:26:04] the world. I've given you the capacity
[1:26:06] to receive it and to believe it.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; And you'll hear the word and that word
[1:26:11] will create that very bloodgiven life in
[1:26:14] you.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends,
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; I'm enthused about this.
[1:26:24] And when he spake another time in
[1:26:26] Matthew 17, and yet and while he spake,
[1:26:30] behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:26:33] them, and behold, a voice out of the
[1:26:35] cloud, which said, "This is my beloved
[1:26:37] son in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye
[1:26:42] him."
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; I and the father are one. Well, I want
[1:26:49] to talk a little bit about this father.
[1:26:51] Fatherhood. Father in the Greek, we'll
[1:26:54] show the next slide, please.
[1:26:58] Father
[1:27:00] is the originator and transmitter of
[1:27:04] anything. Father is the author of a
[1:27:08] family or society of persons animated by
[1:27:13] the same spirit as himself.
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:18] Not another spirit,
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; not just a good inclination,
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; my brother, my sisters, the family of
[1:27:26] God. We're we have been authored
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; by a father.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; We are his progeny.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Literally,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; God created the bloodstream for us.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; And we're not just giving poetic license
[1:27:43] when we say God's blood flows in our
[1:27:45] veins. Hallelujah. That blood uh uh
[1:27:49] well, I don't want to get swimming
[1:27:51] tonight, but
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; the seed of God, people that are born
[1:28:00] again by the word of God that comes out
[1:28:03] of a man or a woman's mouth. Because a
[1:28:06] woman can testify as this woman we just
[1:28:08] saw who considered herself as a
[1:28:11] minister, but she repented. That means
[1:28:13] her mind was changed. She realized, I'm
[1:28:16] not a minister. Hallelujah. And now, now
[1:28:19] a word has come that puts me in my
[1:28:21] place. And she gets in her place and
[1:28:23] brings others in.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's perfect. Look at this
[1:28:28] woman in Holland, this woman in the
[1:28:30] Netherlands. And she begins to hear just
[1:28:32] what's coming over this pullpit. And
[1:28:35] every Sunday, Wednesday, and she'll know
[1:28:37] now she's will be listening to this
[1:28:39] service. and and and here's one service
[1:28:41] and then the Sunday and then a Wednesday
[1:28:43] and then a Sunday and she begin to obey
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; exactly what she heard and said I cannot
[1:28:51] write sufficiently how God has
[1:28:53] wondrously blessed my life. I got an
[1:28:56] email today from a brother down in the
[1:28:58] US said I was up there a few months ago
[1:29:01] and he says I cannot explain to you what
[1:29:04] happened to me from the moment you laid
[1:29:07] your hands on me and prayed. He was
[1:29:09] going to leave my office and I thought I
[1:29:11] need to pray for this brother and I he
[1:29:14] had a number of issues. I laid my hands
[1:29:16] on him and prayed. He said everything
[1:29:18] has changed. My home has changed. Things
[1:29:22] have changed for my wife. Things have
[1:29:24] changed. He said, "I'm going to travel
[1:29:26] up and see you."
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; To tell you, I tell you, my friends,
[1:29:33] God's on the move.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; God's doing things. And I hope right
[1:29:37] here, we can acknowledge what God, not
[1:29:39] only what God's doing out there, but you
[1:29:41] can say, "God's doing something within
[1:29:43] me as well."
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Next slide, please. Father, we're going
[1:29:52] on the same on the same Greek meaning
[1:29:55] for this word. And one who has infused
[1:29:59] his own spirit into others who actuates
[1:30:04] and governs their minds. Oh my goodness.
[1:30:08] Glory be to God. One when our father
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven, hallowed be thy
[1:30:16] name. your father. What you're saying is
[1:30:18] you my father has infused me
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; with your own spirit.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you govern you activate
[1:30:29] and you govern my mind. But if the same
[1:30:33] spirit if but if the spirit of him that
[1:30:36] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:30:38] you, he that raised up Christ from the
[1:30:41] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:30:45] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:30:49] you. This according to God's word, you
[1:30:52] as a believer has been infused. You say,
[1:30:56] "I believed a message." I'm going to go
[1:30:58] a step further. If you believe the
[1:31:00] message, you have been infused with the
[1:31:03] spirit of God. The same spirit that when
[1:31:07] God spoke out and said, "This is my
[1:31:09] beloved son." That same spirit's here
[1:31:12] tonight.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Either that or this Bible is untrue.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; I declare this Bible's absolutely the
[1:31:20] truth.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you need to be able to
[1:31:23] say tonight, he has infused me
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; with his spirit,
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; the same spirit. And thus I can say in
[1:31:32] all truth, not like the world, but I can
[1:31:35] say by revelation, Aba Father.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You're my father.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And by your word, the
[1:31:45] righteous blood of God has come into my
[1:31:48] being. And I have been born again as a
[1:31:51] son of God.
[1:31:53] [Applause]
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Next slide. And for this cause I bow my
[1:32:07] knees, Apostle Paul said, unto the
[1:32:10] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom
[1:32:13] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[1:32:16] named. Paul refers to Jesus the as Jesus
[1:32:21] as being the son and the father. But the
[1:32:23] next verse says of the whole the whole
[1:32:25] family. This is a family. And we've been
[1:32:28] hearing a lot about the family. Brother
[1:32:30] John's been preaching about the family.
[1:32:32] I felt led to ask five brothers to come
[1:32:35] and speak at New Year's evening, not to
[1:32:37] speak, but just to speak out of their
[1:32:38] heart. And I don't know if you noticed,
[1:32:40] none of them knew who the others were.
[1:32:43] And right from brother Burken at the
[1:32:45] first through to the last brother, every
[1:32:47] one of them spoke on their family.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; And brother John comes in right behind
[1:32:52] it and preaches two services one after
[1:32:55] the other on the family. And I thought
[1:32:57] they were marvelous.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And I can say they're marvelous for more
[1:33:01] than one reason is because God
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; who is our father is trying to tell us
[1:33:07] something. And let us not have deaf
[1:33:09] ears. Let us not be dull. Let us not be
[1:33:13] blind but let us see that God has given
[1:33:15] us. He's given us his word that we can
[1:33:18] believe and have faith.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And by believing we put our we we put
[1:33:24] our promise. We put rather our faith to
[1:33:26] the evidence and see it a finished work.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Is it too much to claim
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; to claim family?
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] I was thinking now we've got I'll let
[1:33:47] you read it because you're going to read
[1:33:48] it anyway. So, we just get done and then
[1:33:51] we'll be able I'm going to close in a
[1:33:53] few moments.
[1:33:55] But I I just going and researching and I
[1:33:59] I wanted to just come up with this. Now,
[1:34:03] brother Brandham talks about the
[1:34:04] hemoglobin and and uh we know that they
[1:34:08] can test a child, a baby, and tell whose
[1:34:11] father. One might say, "No, not mine."
[1:34:14] See,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And then they'll say, "Well, we'll do
[1:34:17] the blood test."
[1:34:19] And the state of Virginia, I was on on a
[1:34:22] website they have and they said it's
[1:34:24] from 98 to 99.99%
[1:34:28] absolutely accurate. And it is so
[1:34:31] accurate that they have never been
[1:34:33] they've never lost a case in that
[1:34:35] regard. When they give it the blood test
[1:34:38] that is absolute and that man is the
[1:34:41] father or sometimes he's trying to prove
[1:34:43] that he's the father uh that I am the
[1:34:46] father of this child and and and a blood
[1:34:49] test will show it every time. And so God
[1:34:52] knew that in the very beginning and
[1:34:54] listen now the apostle Peter I believe
[1:34:57] it is that says that Cain who was of
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; of the evil one
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; and then if if if Adam was his father
[1:35:11] apostle Peter has called Adam the evil
[1:35:14] one
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; he was not the evil one. Satan was the
[1:35:21] evil one.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; And he had a different nature in his
[1:35:25] life.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; He had murder in his life.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He hated God.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; He resisted God. He lied in the face of
[1:35:34] God.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; But there come another bloodline.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the blood of Jesus
[1:35:43] Christ speaketh better things than that
[1:35:45] of Abel. And the New Testament takes it
[1:35:48] right back to Abel.
[1:35:50] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, I don't
[1:35:52] understand it." Hey, you don't
[1:35:53] understand most things. I don't
[1:35:55] understand. Soon as I look into space,
[1:35:57] I'm lost. Go out tonight and look up and
[1:36:00] see the stars. If you can't see the
[1:36:01] stars, look at the clouds.
[1:36:05] I don't even understand the clouds.
[1:36:08] My wife and I, we we drive down the
[1:36:10] street. We We talk. Yeah. We talk once
[1:36:13] in a while.
[1:36:15] Drive down the street. Drive down the
[1:36:17] road. says, "And I see all this rain is
[1:36:20] coming down, tons and tons of it,
[1:36:23] barrels, lakes, rivers coming down."
[1:36:27] Says, "How in the world do those clouds
[1:36:29] hold all this water?"
[1:36:32] Do you ever think that? Of course you
[1:36:34] did.
[1:36:37] I don't even understand that. I don't
[1:36:38] even understand the water that's
[1:36:40] dropping on my head. How am I going to
[1:36:41] understand exactly how that hemoglobin
[1:36:44] worked and all of this business worked?
[1:36:45] But I can tell you it's here.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; One man who said he followed the message
[1:36:51] and uh uh believed the message and
[1:36:54] professed the message and so on and
[1:36:55] turned against it and walked right
[1:36:57] against it. He met me and we were down
[1:36:59] taking a walk on White Rock there on the
[1:37:02] prominad and uh he said, "I I can prove
[1:37:05] to you that brother's doctrine is false.
[1:37:08] I want to talk to you." Well,
[1:37:13] I wasn't showing a whole lot of
[1:37:14] interest. He said, 'I really want to
[1:37:16] talk to you. And then he said such a
[1:37:19] contradiction. He said, "The happiest
[1:37:21] day
[1:37:22] of my life was when I met you."
[1:37:29] I thought,
[1:37:32] "I'm looking east, I'm looking west.
[1:37:35] There's a big big space between those
[1:37:37] two." He says, "I'd like to talk to
[1:37:40] you."
[1:37:42] Well, he said this business about the
[1:37:44] serpent seed.
[1:37:46] He said, "How it came over in the ark."
[1:37:49] I said, "You know what?" I said, "I
[1:37:52] can't go back there and explain all
[1:37:54] that, but we just looked up and down the
[1:37:56] prominad." I said, "I can tell you it
[1:37:57] got here."
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not going to call this
[1:38:04] serpent seed." I said, "You want me to
[1:38:06] call it God's seed? Have a look." I
[1:38:09] called him by name. Look around. Look
[1:38:11] around. Look. Look at all of this that's
[1:38:13] going by. This is God's seed. Come on.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Give me a break.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Isn't it so?
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Absolutely true. Don't know how it
[1:38:26] happened. We don't have to explain it. I
[1:38:29] can tell you it's here.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And I see God's people.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see God's bloodline.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] And paternity is the proof. And here's
[1:38:40] what it is. What is paternity? Paternity
[1:38:43] means fatherhood.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And God loved fatherhood.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He wanted he wanted it proven on the
[1:38:52] earth that he had children here.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And establishing fraternity means
[1:38:58] legally identifying the father of a
[1:39:01] child. God has gone to great lengths to
[1:39:04] prove that these children are his.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "They're mine and my life is in
[1:39:10] them and I'm not ashamed to be
[1:39:12] identified with them."
[1:39:15] And Jesus called his disciples called
[1:39:17] his disciples all 12. The Bible says all
[1:39:21] 12. Have not I chosen you 12? He said,
[1:39:25] "And one is a devil." He chose it to
[1:39:28] prove prove. He wanted to prove legally,
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; that 11 were his
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; and one was not.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; And by following the word, following the
[1:39:41] word, Jesus I they didn't only identify
[1:39:44] themselves with Jesus. Listen friends,
[1:39:46] to me it's not such a great miracle that
[1:39:49] those disciples with their squabbling,
[1:39:52] which they did
[1:39:54] amongst themselves, they squabbled,
[1:39:57] argued who was the greatest and this and
[1:40:00] that about different things. They had
[1:40:02] discussion about it. It wasn't all roses
[1:40:07] and they didn't know much of the time
[1:40:09] what was happening. And Jesus didn't
[1:40:12] reprimand them and scold them. He just
[1:40:15] kept leading him on and on. Don't do
[1:40:17] that. Put away your sword, Peter. Jesus
[1:40:20] knew in a few hours he's going to be
[1:40:22] betraying him. Jesus knew he's going to
[1:40:23] be cursing
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; in a few hours.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; But he just let them kept following him,
[1:40:36] following him. And by following him,
[1:40:38] they ended up in the upper room. By
[1:40:40] following him, they became infused
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; by the very life that was in him.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; It was released and he received it. They
[1:40:48] received it and he knew they were going
[1:40:50] to receive it.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Paternity creates a legal relationship
[1:40:57] between the father and a child. Next
[1:41:00] slide. What is paternity? Paternity is
[1:41:04] required to make the father legally
[1:41:06] responsible for paying support. Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He has never seen his children baking
[1:41:14] bread.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; He's legally responsible legally. What
[1:41:19] is the most legal document you have? Is
[1:41:21] this one right here? He has made himself
[1:41:24] legally bound to you tonight to see you
[1:41:28] through life. Hallelujah.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Oh my my blessed people and brothers and
[1:41:35] sisters and children. how this ought to
[1:41:37] mean so much to the young people. I'm at
[1:41:40] the twilight years, but if I was just
[1:41:42] starting out, I'd want to have a
[1:41:44] document in my hand. Not just a
[1:41:46] passport. I want to have a document.
[1:41:47] Somebody's legally responsible for me
[1:41:49] here in this life.
[1:41:52] I see all this wickedness and this vile
[1:41:55] corruption on every hand. How in the
[1:41:58] world am I going to How am I going to
[1:41:59] remain steadfast? How am I going to hold
[1:42:01] center? How am I going to stay clean?
[1:42:04] I've got a legal document says, "You're
[1:42:06] my son. You're my daughter. I'm gonna
[1:42:09] keep you."
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You couldn't expect me to be quiet on
[1:42:16] this, could you?
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Paternity is a necessary first step in
[1:42:22] requesting visitation. You might wonder
[1:42:24] why I put this here. Because you can put
[1:42:26] it into a natural context. But let me
[1:42:28] give you a spiritual context.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; He
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; came and visited us.
[1:42:35] Hallelujah. He visited us 2,000 years
[1:42:38] ago. And when he was here, he said, "I'm
[1:42:40] going to visit you again, and it'll be
[1:42:42] like when I visited Abraham. I came in
[1:42:45] the form of Elohim." Hallelujah. And
[1:42:48] Abraham had a revelation of who I was,
[1:42:50] and I'm going to come and visit you, and
[1:42:52] you'll have a revelation of who I am.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And he had a legal right to come and
[1:42:59] visit us
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; because he was our father.
[1:43:03] Glory to God.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; I could preach on that, my brother, my
[1:43:07] sister.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And the mama church, the mama said,
[1:43:12] "You're not their father." He said,
[1:43:14] "I'll do a blood test."
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] Hallelujah. I'll send my word with the
[1:43:23] blood in it.
[1:43:26] Hallelujah.
[1:43:28] I'll give them a blood test
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; and they'll prove they're not of that
[1:43:33] world. They'll prove they're not of this
[1:43:35] mama. Hallelujah. The blood test will
[1:43:38] prove I'm their father.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And he had a right to visit us
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; and he did that.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; And they have rights to any inheritance
[1:43:55] from the father. You have a right to any
[1:43:58] inheritance from the father. You have
[1:44:01] received his bloodline. You received
[1:44:04] that seed. You received it as much as
[1:44:07] Mary received it.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; And more so
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "It's needful for me
[1:44:14] to go."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; But when he the spirit has come,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet in this
[1:44:22] generation, I'll come to it Sunday.
[1:44:24] That's why he came and so often said the
[1:44:26] spirit is the token, the Holy Ghost is
[1:44:31] the sign.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; That he will pass over you.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; I just got one more slide. I might as
[1:44:50] well show it.
[1:44:55] What is paternity?
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Children,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; you need to know who who that your
[1:45:01] father is and that he cares.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; You need to know that he cares.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; If this is good for the world, what
[1:45:10] about you and I?
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Do you know that father cares?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he cares. I know he cares. How
[1:45:18] do I know? He's my father.
[1:45:21] Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; It gives a family identity.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; We look like him.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; And when children know they are part of
[1:45:31] their of a family, they are likely to be
[1:45:33] more secure about who they are and where
[1:45:37] they came from.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Where did you come from?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:49] more secure.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'll say absolutely secure.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Sister Leslie Anne, come and sing
[1:45:59] redemption by blood. Glory to God. And
[1:46:03] we're going to rejoice as we close the
[1:46:05] service. And we'll try to pick up here
[1:46:07] on Sunday. I don't know. I just about
[1:46:08] blew my wad.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, it keeps opening up.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[1:46:18] Koopa
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; 3 * 7
[1:46:24] keep it coming
[1:46:26] I say to God Koopa
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; 3 * 7 keep it coming hallelujah and give
[1:46:33] me a capacity to receive it.
[1:46:37] Hallelujah. God bless you. Amen. Isn't
[1:46:40] it wonderful?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, we had a wonderful evening. I
[1:46:43] enjoyed it. I hope you did. Amen. Praise
[1:46:46] God.
[1:46:49] Bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:46:54] Hallelujah.
[1:46:56] Are we ready? Amen. God bless you.
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] I felt that sting.
[1:47:07] I had sense it.
[1:47:11] Its cruel pain
[1:47:14] brought bitter tears.
[1:47:19] But how could I escape
[1:47:22] when judgment was sure?
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:28] Who could plead
[1:47:30] my cause?
[1:47:36] And when God saw
[1:47:40] there was no one
[1:47:45] he sent to die
[1:47:48] his only son.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; For only through blood his rot could
[1:47:57] have been appeased.
[1:48:01] His justice was satisfied when blood
[1:48:04] flowed from Calvary.
[1:48:11] Redemption by blood.
[1:48:15] Oh wretched man that I am.
[1:48:22] Who can deliver
[1:48:25] me from the body of this debt? and who
[1:48:30] shall set me free,
[1:48:35] taking me from my captivity.
[1:48:40] But I thank God
[1:48:42] for Jesus Christ and his debt on Calary.
[1:48:48] It bought for me
[1:48:51] redemption by blood.
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] I felt the chains
[1:49:01] bind my soul within.
[1:49:06] I was serving that slave master sin.
[1:49:13] And by reason of
[1:49:16] my bondage I cried.
[1:49:19] [Music]
[1:49:21] And God heard me when I sigh.
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] and remembering
[1:49:31] his covenant.
[1:49:36] Yes, a prophet he
[1:49:39] did truly sent
[1:49:43] with a word of truth to break the
[1:49:46] strongholds within
[1:49:49] and totally deliver me from the power of
[1:49:54] indwelling sin.
[1:49:59] Our redemption by blood.
[1:50:03] Oh wretched man that I am,
[1:50:09] who shall deliver
[1:50:12] me from the bonds of slavery
[1:50:16] and who shall set me free,
[1:50:21] taking me out
[1:50:23] my captivity.
[1:50:26] But I thank God
[1:50:28] through Jesus Christ and it set on
[1:50:32] Calvary. It bought for me.
[1:50:37] Redemption by blood.
[1:50:41] Redemption by blood.
[1:50:44] Redemption by power.
[1:50:48] In completeness and joy,
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:50:56] redemption
[1:50:57] for me.
[1:51:00] [Applause]
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Well, we put a lot in two hours.
[1:51:18] And we're going to stand and sing. There
[1:51:20] is a fountain filled with blood drawn
[1:51:24] from Emanuel's veins. And sinners plunge
[1:51:29] beneath that flood lose
[1:51:32] all
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; all their guilty stains. All.
[1:51:38] And we're going to dismiss you and thank
[1:51:40] you for your attendance tonight.
[1:51:45] There is
[1:51:48] a fountain
[1:51:50] filled
[1:51:52] with blood draw.

[1:52:12] their guilty.

[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:18] Heat.
[1:53:20] [Applause]
[1:53:30] My God
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:38] has been my king and shall
[1:53:44] be till I die.
[1:53:49] We're going to close in just a moment,
[1:53:51] but I'd like to say to you as a
[1:53:52] congregation when you go tonight, we've
[1:53:56] enjoyed the word. I trust you did. I
[1:53:58] felt that you did. I did myself.
[1:54:02] But I want to say to you, I don't take
[1:54:03] it lightly.
[1:54:06] Brother Brandham, in the presence
[1:54:09] of the angel of the Lord,
[1:54:12] someone said to him, "Why don't you ask
[1:54:13] him his name?"
[1:54:15] He said, "You don't even speak. You
[1:54:19] don't say a word in that presence. You
[1:54:21] wouldn't even be begin to think to ask
[1:54:24] his name.
[1:54:26] It's such a holy sacred presence, such a
[1:54:29] holiness. We as human creatures, we're
[1:54:34] so conscious of our frailties and so on.
[1:54:36] If we were ushered into that presence
[1:54:38] just now, this what I want to say as you
[1:54:40] get ready to leave, if each one of us
[1:54:42] were just ushered right in close
[1:54:45] proximity to the very being of God
[1:54:48] himself,
[1:54:51] you'd be very thankful to be able to
[1:54:53] say,
[1:54:55] And sinners plunge
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; beneath the flood, lose all. I've lost
[1:55:02] all my guilty stains. I stand here
[1:55:05] tonight redeemed.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; I stand here tonight washed.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; By what you provided for me.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; And thus I come into your presence, oh
[1:55:19] God. Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:24] Could we sing also? I'm redeemed.
[1:55:28] If anyone asks you who I am,
[1:55:31] tell them I am redeemed.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:55:38] redeemed.
[1:55:41] With the price,
[1:55:45] Jesus
[1:55:47] has my life.
[1:55:52] [Music]
[1:55:55] [Applause]
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:01] I am.
[1:56:03] Oh, tell me
[1:56:06] I am.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Let's unite once again. Oh,
[1:56:13] I am redeemed.
[1:56:20] Oh, such a price. Jesus
[1:56:24] has changed my life.
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:40] Tell them
[1:56:42] I am redeemed.
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you tonight, it's been
[1:56:50] a privilege to speak to the redeemed of
[1:56:53] the Lord and to know that Jesus Christ
[1:56:58] and God our father through Jesus Christ
[1:57:01] was not ashamed to identify himself with
[1:57:04] us in this day and in this time.
[1:57:07] marvelous, wonderful thought. Brother
[1:57:10] DD, I'm going to ask you if you'll come
[1:57:12] and dismiss us in prayer. God bless you.
[1:57:16] Go home and prosper spiritually.
[1:57:20] Have a wonderful tomorrow if there is.
[1:57:23] And I can assure you if we don't have it
[1:57:26] here, we'll spend it in eternity.
[1:57:29] Amen. God bless you. Thanks, brother.

[1:58:10] And we just want to revel in the
[1:58:12] reality, oh God, of what you have done.

[1:58:18] so real, Father. Just means more than
[1:58:21] life to us tonight. We thank you for the
[1:58:24] inspiration of it. We thank you for
[1:58:27] touching our hearts once again, dear
[1:58:29] God.
[1:58:30] We just ask that you'll cause that word
[1:58:32] to be such an anchor in every soul,
[1:58:36] every heart that when the enemy comes
[1:58:38] like a flood that that standard can
[1:58:40] stand to resist him there God that we
[1:58:43] can truly walk Father in the realization
[1:58:46] of what you have made us in this hour
[1:58:48] connected to you oh God belonging to you
[1:58:51] being safe and secure in your arm Father
