[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; That's solemn warning. We don't know
[0:04] what time and you don't know what time
[0:06] that this city one day is going to be
[0:10] laying out here at the bottom of this
[0:11] ocean.
[0:13] Oh, Capernium said Jesus, thou who
[0:16] exalted into heaven will be brought down
[0:19] into hell. For if the mighty works have
[0:22] been done in Sodom and Gomorrah, it had
[0:24] been standing to this day. And Sodom
[0:26] Gomar lays at the bottom of the Dead Sea
[0:28] and Capernium's in the bottom of the
[0:29] sea. Thou city who claims to be the city
[0:34] of the angels
[0:36] who's exalted yourself into heaven and
[0:39] sent all the dirty filthy things of
[0:42] fashions and things to even the foreign
[0:44] countries come here to pick up our filth
[0:45] and send it away through your fine
[0:48] churches and steeples and so forth the
[0:51] way you do. Remember, one day
[0:55] you will be laying in the bottom of this
[0:57] sea. You're a great honeycomb under you
[1:01] right now. The wrath of God is belching
[1:03] right beneath you. How much longer
[1:05] you'll hold this sandbar hanging over
[1:07] that when that ocean out under a mile
[1:09] deep will slide in there. Come back to
[1:11] the salt and sea.
[1:14] It'll be worse than the last day of
[1:16] Pompei.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Repent. Los Angeles.
[1:21] Repent the rest of you and turn to God.
[1:24] The hour of his wrath is upon the earth.
[1:26] Flee while there's time to flee and come
[1:29] into Christ. The
[1:31] &gt;&gt; five strongest since 1900. It was so
[1:34] powerful in fact that it moved the main
[1:37] island of Japan 8 ft.
[1:40] This is just one of the 1.3 million
[1:45] earthquakes that occur around the globe
[1:47] each year. The largest ever recorded
[1:49] here in North America, Anchorage,
[1:52] Alaska, 1964. A 9.1.
[1:57] The Earth shook for five straight
[1:59] minutes. The energy release was the
[2:02] equivalent of 10 million atom bombs, the
[2:05] size of the one dropped on Hiroshima.
[2:07] And that's not the biggest earthquake
[2:09] ever recorded. No, the biggest was four
[2:11] years earlier off the coast of Valdivia
[2:13] and southern Chile. a 9.5 on the recctor
[2:17] scale right there.
[2:20] Bam.
[2:22] This quake lasted 11 minutes and spawned
[2:25] a tsunami 82 ft high that leveled Hilo,
[2:28] Hawaii, 8,000 mi away.
[2:31] 8,000 m away.
[2:34] So, um, it's
[2:38] it's mass destruction like this that
[2:41] shows just how important the research
[2:43] that we're doing here is because we need
[2:45] to be able to predict these things,
[2:47] right? To plan and prepare for them.
[2:49] Yes, ma'am.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; Professor, do you think something that
[2:51] intense could happen here?
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Well, the San Andreas fault runs right
[2:55] up the spine of California.
[2:57] It's the demarcation line between two
[2:59] tectonic plates that are constantly
[3:02] moving.
[3:03] I would add to that the fact that it's
[3:05] supposed to happen every 150 years and
[3:08] we're about 100 years overdue.
[3:12] I'd say it's not a matter of if,
[3:14] it's a matter of when.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; It's done been spoke. It has to
[3:20] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a rapture. Oh my. I
[3:24] remember just my last message in
[3:25] California where I thought I'd never go
[3:27] back again when I predict that Los
[3:29] Angeles will go beneath the ocean. Thus
[3:31] sayeth the Lord, it will.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; She's done. She's washed. She's
[3:37] finished. What hour? I don't know when,
[3:39] but it will be sunk. Right after that,
[3:41] the earthquakes begin to joke and bow.
[3:43] You remember many of you men standing
[3:45] right there, that rock that day when
[3:47] that angel came down there and that
[3:49] lightning fire falling from the heaven
[3:50] around the rock where we was standing
[3:51] there.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Rocks playing out of the mountains and
[3:54] falling across her and she blasted three
[3:55] times hard. I said, "Judgment will
[3:58] strike the West Coast."
[4:00] Two days after that, Alaska almost sunk.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Remember that same God that said that?
[4:05] Said Los Angeles is doomed and
[4:08] &gt;&gt; she's finished. I don't know when. I
[4:10] can't tell you. I didn't know what said
[4:12] that, but this brother here, I believe
[4:13] it was, no, one of the Mosley, I
[4:15] believe, had me out on the street out
[4:16] there. I didn't know what it was to look
[4:17] back now. I look back in the scripture
[4:19] and Jesus said, "Capernium, Capernium,
[4:22] how you exalted yourself, brother, up
[4:24] into heaven shall be brought down into
[4:26] hell. For if the mighty works have been
[4:28] done in you that have been done in
[4:29] Sodom, it stood today. And about 150
[4:32] years from there, Sodom had already in
[4:35] the earth, then Capernaum is in the
[4:38] water too today. And that same spirit of
[4:41] God that said all these things and done
[4:43] all these things. It said there, "Oh
[4:45] city Capernium, who called yourself by
[4:48] the name of the angels, Los Angeles, how
[4:50] you've exalted yourself into heaven, the
[4:52] very root and seat of Satan. See, you've
[4:56] exalted yourself preachers. It's a
[4:58] graveyard for them. Good men, go there
[5:00] and die like rats. What happened? You
[5:03] that call yourself by the name of the
[5:04] angels. If the mighty works have been
[5:06] done in Sodom had been done in you, it
[5:08] stood today. But your hours come, you
[5:10] watch and see if it ain't I'm a false
[5:12] prophet.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. You don't have to do this now.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we do. We're good to go.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Roll.
[5:23] First question, how come no one saw what
[5:26] happened in Nevada coming?
[5:28] &gt;&gt; Because we didn't know there were any
[5:29] fault lines out there.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Why not?
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Contrary to popular belief, scientists
[5:35] don't know everything.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; I understand that you publicly stated
[5:38] that someday scientists will be able to
[5:40] predict earthquakes.
[5:41] &gt;&gt; Well, actually, as of yesterday, we now
[5:44] believe that we can predict them.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Professor,
[5:50] &gt;&gt; talk to you a sec.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
[5:54] What is it?
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Current pulse rates at our monitoring
[5:57] stations all along the San Andreas
[5:59] fault. Their averages are spiking from
[6:00] 82 to 85 with the biggest jumps coming
[6:03] from San Francisco. More than 20 points
[6:05] higher than what we saw in the V.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. There's no way.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; We checked. We double checked.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; Then we reset all the instruments and
[6:11] triple checked. Those are the counts.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait, no.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; Um,
[6:19] okay. Ah,
[6:25] if we draw a line from the bottom of the
[6:28] San Andreas up to the Hoover Dam, it
[6:31] almost literally follows the Colorado
[6:34] River,
[6:36] which is a natural deformation event.
[6:38] And geologically,
[6:40] deformationation events mark boundaries.
[6:45] They mark boundaries.
[6:49] So, what if
[6:51] what if this whole chunk of land is
[6:55] connected to our tectonic plate? That
[6:57] would tell us that what happened
[6:58] yesterday in Nevada was not an anomaly.
[7:03] No. What if it was a precursor movement
[7:07] along the leading edge of the plate
[7:10] boundary fault from Los Angeles all the
[7:12] way up to San Francisco? Are you saying
[7:14] you think the whole San Andreas fault
[7:16] might go off?
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Who should we call?
[7:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
