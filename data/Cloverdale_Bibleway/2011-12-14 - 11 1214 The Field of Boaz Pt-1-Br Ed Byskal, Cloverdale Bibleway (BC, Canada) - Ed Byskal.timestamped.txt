[27:17] Hallelujah.
[27:20] He's so wonderful to us.
[27:24] Let's just bow our heads a moment.
[27:29] Father, how privileged we are to have
[27:33] come to know you. Whom to know is life
[27:35] eternal. To be able to speak your name,
[27:39] to know that that name was first spoken
[27:43] from the lips of an angel. Now shall
[27:46] call his name Jesus.
[27:48] He shall save his people from their
[27:50] sins. And here we are this evening,
[27:53] Lord. Redeemed.
[27:55] How we love to proclaim it. Redeemed by
[27:57] the blood of the lamb as the people have
[28:00] been singing and worshiping. And we know
[28:02] that this has risen up into your ears,
[28:05] Lord. And has come before you as an
[28:07] incense. And we pray now that you will
[28:10] speak and utter your thoughts, oh God.
[28:12] We pray you will feed our souls, oh
[28:15] shepherd of the flock. How we love your
[28:18] leadership, Lord. Just lead us. I pray
[28:21] each one lead us by shady green pastures
[28:24] and just touch us, I pray, in a special
[28:27] way. Oh, Holy Spirit of God, we're
[28:31] depending entirely upon you. We thank
[28:33] you for your presence. And now, Lord,
[28:36] open your word. We open the pages of the
[28:39] book, but you're the only one that can
[28:40] open the word. Pray you'll make it a
[28:43] reality to us in Jesus name. Amen.
[28:49] Well, nice to see everyone out this
[28:51] evening. God bless you.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. It was just a
[28:59] little delayed reaction there, but it
[29:00] came through. God bless you. Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; We're really thankful. See, Brother
[29:08] Nathaniel up there. Greetings from your
[29:11] family, Brother Nathaniel.
[29:14] uh with all of Brother Nathaniel's
[29:18] family and his brother David just uh
[29:22] drove us around like a cab driver. I had
[29:25] to thank him so many times I felt
[29:27] embarrassed. I said, "I feel so
[29:29] embarrassed. You pick us up and take us,
[29:31] you know, here and take us there and
[29:33] drive us someplace else." And it was
[29:36] just uh uh really unusual, really very
[29:39] very nice to be with brother Nathaniel's
[29:42] parents and the church there and pastor
[29:44] Elbert. And they send the warmest
[29:46] greetings to you here as well. Also from
[29:50] I was speaking uh to brother uh brother
[29:54] Gear Rudald. He was in Moscow and so we
[29:57] were emailing back and forth and he
[30:00] sends greetings and brother Pankinanin,
[30:04] brother Dystra
[30:06] and brother another brother by the name
[30:08] of brother Bruno. I didn't I wasn't at
[30:11] his church but he was at the meetings.
[30:13] And so it's going to be a wonderful time
[30:16] friends when we gather around the table.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; And uh not only around the table but
[30:21] after that.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm looking forward to it.
[30:27] I will have you take your Bibles this
[30:29] evening and uh
[30:32] I'll have to ask for your
[30:36] uh
[30:38] your grace and ask that you will try and
[30:43] uh uh uh absorb things that uh perhaps
[30:48] you've heard or have not heard. But if
[30:51] something strikes your kind of strikes a
[30:53] chord in your heart, uh maybe you just
[30:56] jot it down. Uh I was going to speak on
[30:59] this on Sunday morning and I'm going to
[31:01] continue Sunday morning because I have
[31:03] far too much for this evening, but it's
[31:07] like, you know, preachers are just
[31:09] humans and they say, "Well, I'd like to
[31:11] speak that Sunday morning." Uh but uh I
[31:14] just felt and I said to brother Tom,
[31:16] I'll I'll take the service this evening
[31:19] because I would like to you know in
[31:21] introduce the this thought to the people
[31:24] and then uh then all of you will be here
[31:28] Lord willing Sunday morning and those
[31:31] that are able to come they drive perhaps
[31:34] from Seattle or Mount Vernon and
[31:36] different places. Mary'sville
[31:38] uh not able to be here this evening but
[31:41] uh at least we'll have you know we'll
[31:43] have advanced uh a distance on and we
[31:48] this number of people here will know
[31:49] what we're talking about.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; So on Sunday morning I'm counting on you
[31:54] saying amen.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; I know where I know where we're headed.
[31:58] All right. Uh turn please to the book of
[32:01] Ruth if you would. Now I have been
[32:03] speaking several services on the lamb
[32:06] takes the book and speaks
[32:09] and uh the first two services I didn't
[32:12] get any further than the lamb opening or
[32:14] taking the book and he took the book and
[32:17] Boaz took Ruth and there was the uh an
[32:21] not the analogy but the comparison that
[32:24] we made which is absolutely true. The
[32:26] lamb takes the lamb takes the book and
[32:29] Boaz takes Ruth for wife. And they're
[32:32] speaking about both exactly the same
[32:34] thing. One is in a shadow type and the
[32:37] other's symbolic.
[32:39] So because revelation is a book of
[32:41] symbols. So there's a lamb and he's
[32:44] taking a book. But really what it is,
[32:46] the lamb is a person and it's Christ
[32:49] taking his wife, taking the record of
[32:51] her life and full redemption is the
[32:55] abolishment
[32:57] of everything that we've inherited in
[32:59] this natural life and uh and and having
[33:03] the access to the very nature of Jesus
[33:06] Christ. So, we've been speaking about
[33:08] that and then I took uh one or two
[33:10] services just moving forward on and what
[33:14] the lamb said and then I I took some of
[33:17] what Boaz said. We're going back there
[33:20] now, not to repeat, but I it's like a uh
[33:25] it's like a corner for me in this in
[33:28] this message. So, uh, you'll want to try
[33:32] to don't take it just as a sermon. Go
[33:35] home and then try and remember Sunday
[33:36] morning if you'll take some notes cuz
[33:38] I'm after you sit down, keep your Bibles
[33:41] open because I'm going to continue on in
[33:44] a number of scriptures uh in in the book
[33:46] of Ruth and perhaps elsewhere. All
[33:48] right,
[33:50] I'm going to begin to read at Ruth the 2
[33:52] chapter
[33:54] and verse 8 uh down to verse 12.
[33:59] And then we will continue down to verse
[34:02] 22 and 23 and read a few verses in the
[34:07] third chapter starting at verse one.
[34:11] Uh verse 8. Then said Boaz, now the lamb
[34:16] is speaking. See the redeemer speaking.
[34:20] Then said Boaz unto Ruth,
[34:23] thou not my daughter. Go not to glean in
[34:27] another field, neither go from hence,
[34:31] uh, but abide here fast by my maidens.
[34:36] Let thine eyes be on the field that they
[34:38] do reap, and go thou after them. Have I
[34:43] not charged the young men, that they
[34:45] shall not touch thee? And when thou art
[34:47] to thirst, go unto the vessels, and
[34:50] drink of that which the young men have
[34:53] drawn. Then she fell on her face and
[34:56] bowed herself toward the ground, and
[34:58] said unto him, Why have I found grace in
[35:01] thine eyes, that thou shouldest take
[35:04] knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?
[35:07] And Boaz answered and said unto her, It
[35:10] hath been f it hath fully been showed me
[35:14] all that thou hast done unto thy
[35:16] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[35:18] husband, and how thou hast left thy
[35:21] father and thy mother, and the land of
[35:24] thy nativity, and art come unto a people
[35:27] which thou knowest not hereto for. The
[35:31] Lord recompense thy work, and a full
[35:34] reward be given thee of the Lord God of
[35:38] Israel, under whose wings thou art come
[35:40] to trust.
[35:42] And then now that is from verse two,
[35:47] from verse 8 to 12 in chapter 2. That's
[35:52] Boaz speaking to Ruth. And now from
[35:56] verse 22 and 23 and into chapter 3:es
[36:01] 1-5, it's Naomi's instruction to Ruth.
[36:05] And if you would please remember,
[36:07] brother Brandham said that Naomi is the
[36:10] old Orthodox church, the Jewish church.
[36:15] So now just I want you thinking for a
[36:17] moment.
[36:19] Then when brother Brham and I'll come
[36:21] back to this in just a moment. When
[36:23] brother Brandham goes to speak about the
[36:26] kinsman redeemer,
[36:28] he he doesn't take it from the New
[36:30] Testament. He takes it from the Old
[36:33] Testament and goes back to the book of
[36:36] Ruth, which is the Old Testament, Old
[36:39] Jewish Orthodox Church. He had to go
[36:42] back there to because that was the only
[36:45] place they could give a clear
[36:47] understanding and interpret what the
[36:50] redemption was actually all about. So we
[36:53] and now uh Ruth is instructing I'm sorry
[36:57] Naomi is instructing Ruth. So just put
[37:00] it in his language now. The old the old
[37:03] Orthodox
[37:05] Jewish church is explaining to Ruth the
[37:10] bride what redemption's all about. And
[37:13] when the prophet came, a gentile prophet
[37:16] came to tell us what redemption was all
[37:18] about, he had to go back to the book of
[37:20] Ruth. You had to go back to the Old
[37:23] Testament to the Jewish church to
[37:25] explain that. And you have to also be
[37:28] mindful that Ruth is a Moabitete. She
[37:32] doesn't know anything about redemption.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; She's never been taught. She's never
[37:37] heard that from her priests. She doesn't
[37:40] know anything about redemption. So,
[37:42] she's hearing something for the first
[37:44] time. Amen.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; So now with that setting,
[37:49] and Naomi said, verse 22 of chapter 2,
[37:53] and Naomi said unto Ruth, her
[37:55] daughter-in-law, it is good, my
[37:57] daughter, that thou go out with his
[38:00] maidens, and they meet thee, not in
[38:03] another field. I want you to get the
[38:06] emphasis. Not in another field. Now Boaz
[38:09] has told her, don't go into another
[38:11] field. Is going to be important between
[38:13] now and Sunday. Don't go into another
[38:16] field.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; And there's lots of fields.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Men have fields,
[38:22] &gt;&gt; all kinds of fields and and other seed.
[38:25] But this this field happens to be the
[38:28] field of redemption.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; This is the only field of redemption.
[38:34] And so now a mother-in-law is saying,
[38:36] "It's good that you stay in that field
[38:42] &gt;&gt; and not in another field." So she kept
[38:45] fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean
[38:48] unto the end of barley harvest and of
[38:51] wheat harvest, and dwelt with her
[38:54] mother-in-law.
[38:55] Verse one of chapter 3.
[38:59] Then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[39:02] her, "My daughter, shall I not seek rest
[39:06] for thee, that it may be well with
[39:08] thee?" You know, she, "May I not seek
[39:11] rest for you?" Here's a woman who's a
[39:13] young widow. May I not seek rest for
[39:15] thee? Uh that it may be well with thee.
[39:18] And now is not Boaz our kindred with
[39:21] whose maidens thou was? Behold, he went
[39:25] with barley tonight in the threshing
[39:28] floor. Look at the instructions she's
[39:30] giving her. Wash thyself, therefore, and
[39:33] anoint thee, and put on thy raignment
[39:36] upon thee, and get thee down to the
[39:38] floor, but make not thyself known unto
[39:41] the man, until he shall have done eating
[39:44] and drinking. And it shall come, it
[39:48] shall be when he lieth down, that thou
[39:51] shalt mark the place where he shall lie,
[39:54] and thou shalt go in and uncover his
[39:56] feet, and lie lay there down, and and he
[40:01] will tell thee what thou shalt do. And
[40:05] she said unto her, All that thou sayest
[40:08] unto me, I will do.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you. As you have your seats,
[40:16] keep your Bibles open, please.
[40:20] In a message, Redeemer Redemption,
[40:26] Brother Bram spoke very early in 1955,
[40:30] he said, notice, and and this is very
[40:33] he's very concise in his wording here.
[40:38] Notice there was a man named Limc.
[40:42] his wife Naomi and they had two sons and
[40:47] they left the land of to sojourn in Moab
[40:51] because they had heard there was bread
[40:53] in Moab.
[40:54] While they were over there, the two sons
[40:57] grew up and married two girls, one of
[41:00] them named Orpa and one of them named
[41:03] Ruth. And the two beautiful pictures.
[41:06] And the two beautiful pictures of the
[41:09] churches. And Naomi, a perfect picture
[41:12] of the Orthodox Church. Naomi, a picture
[41:17] of the Orthodox Church. Orpa, a picture
[41:20] of the lukewarm gentile church. And
[41:23] Ruth, a picture of the bride. Such a
[41:26] beautiful lay as God has laid out in his
[41:30] word by inspiration.
[41:32] Notice then sickness. Alimc died and the
[41:36] two boys died and the women were left
[41:38] alone. Now that's the story
[41:43] &gt;&gt; and you can't get it any clearer than
[41:45] that.
[41:46] And for a full understanding
[41:49] of of the process of redemption, brother
[41:53] Brandham goes back and that's where he
[41:56] takes it from Naomi and the old Jewish
[42:00] church and as as though we gentile bride
[42:05] Ruth is being the example receives
[42:08] revelation. Now, brother Brandham is
[42:11] going back. We wouldn't know
[42:14] the things that we're talking about
[42:16] tonight. We wouldn't know it unless a
[42:19] prophet had gone back and unfolded
[42:23] redemption out of the Old Testament.
[42:26] I've done reading, a little bit of
[42:28] reading what others have said about it.
[42:30] I'm so glad we have a prophet messenger.
[42:33] I tell you what, we'd really be lost and
[42:36] drifting if we didn't have that. How how
[42:38] gracious God has been. And so a as as
[42:42] Ruth is listening to her, Ruth is
[42:46] listening to Naomi, her mother-in-law,
[42:48] the old Orthodox Jewish church. She's
[42:50] listening saying, "Anoint yourself and
[42:53] wash and uh put on your garments and do
[42:55] this and you'll go there and and uh and
[42:58] she gives her all full instruction." And
[43:01] she doesn't know it, but she's actually
[43:02] being led into redemption.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she's she's being encouraged,
[43:08] instructed by Boaz, and being instructed
[43:11] by Ruth as well. So, the kinsman
[43:15] redeemer is instructing her and her
[43:18] mother-in-law, the old Orthodox church,
[43:20] is instructing her. And we have exactly
[43:23] the same thing. We've had a prophet now,
[43:26] Christ making himself known. Boaz has
[43:29] been instructing us. And the old
[43:31] Orthodox Church has been instructing us.
[43:34] and they're both saying the same thing.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:41] And so it's it's interesting. I whenever
[43:44] I get on with something like this, I
[43:46] then I start finding out just exactly
[43:48] the statistics of how brother Brandham
[43:51] approached the subject because to me
[43:53] it's become a very very important
[43:55] subject.
[43:57] And for the subject of the for the
[43:59] subject of the breach which was between
[44:01] the church ages and the seals, brother
[44:05] Brandham goes back to the book of Ruth
[44:08] and the account of how she was redeemed.
[44:11] And that's the breach between the two,
[44:13] which is Revelation 5. He refers to he
[44:17] refers to Boaz as the kinsman redeemer.
[44:20] not always as the kinsman redeemer, but
[44:22] he refers to Boaz and and uh in his in
[44:26] his ministry a total of 69 times. 69
[44:31] times. 58 times prior to the breach.
[44:35] This is really remarkable. 58 times
[44:38] prior to the breach, he refers to Boaz.
[44:42] And in the breach uh is five times in
[44:46] the breach and the seals. five times in
[44:49] the breach in the seals and then only
[44:52] once in n the whole year in 1964 only
[44:54] mentions his name once and only once in
[44:56] 1965 in the whole year. Why? Because the
[45:01] message and redemption has been laid out
[45:03] and done.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; That should say something to us.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; That was his ministry.
[45:12] And so he's preparing the people all
[45:14] through the years and speaking about
[45:16] even you go back 1955 in the early 50s
[45:20] he's talking about Boaz and Ruth and
[45:23] Naomi and explaining the whole thing and
[45:26] comes all the way up and all of those
[45:28] times and then after it's revealed in
[45:31] the breach it's it's essentially over.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; He doesn't go back to it. Now you want
[45:36] to take and note that in your mind when
[45:39] you when you come across that now when
[45:42] you hear that then you'll know you'll
[45:45] have an overview of the picture this
[45:47] indeed was a messenger that was calling
[45:51] the bride a gentile bride uh and and
[45:55] Christ himself coming there the kinsman
[45:58] redeemer giving us instructions through
[46:01] that messenger. Hallelujah. and going
[46:04] back perfectly uh perfectly according to
[46:07] the scripture going back into the Old
[46:10] Testament in order to reveal it to the
[46:13] bride because that's exactly how it
[46:15] happened. Isn't it beautiful?
[46:17] &gt;&gt; It's just absolutely perfect.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So now Ruth as a Moabitete as I said
[46:24] earlier she does not know anything about
[46:27] the law of redemption.
[46:30] That's this is this has been given by
[46:32] the prophet Moses to the Israelites
[46:35] certainly not the Moabites.
[46:37] And u now in in the third chapter Ruth
[46:42] I'll have you look at the 11th verse
[46:44] with me.
[46:53] And now Boaz is speaking.
[46:56] And now, my daughter,
[46:58] fear not. And notice this next line, I
[47:02] will do to thee all that thou
[47:05] requireest.
[47:08] For all the city of For all the city of
[47:11] my people do know that thou art a
[47:13] virtuous woman. That's the only thing
[47:16] she has to stand on. Thou art a virtuous
[47:19] woman. But he but now he's talking to
[47:23] a a woman that
[47:26] uh is not only a widow. She's uh she's
[47:30] childless.
[47:32] She is in a strange country.
[47:36] Uh she's in a a field
[47:39] uh that's owned by a near kinsman to her
[47:42] mother-in-law.
[47:44] She doesn't know that. She's picking up
[47:47] and gleaning seeds just trying to She's
[47:50] so much like you and I
[47:54] &gt;&gt; this evening that are sitting here.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; She's just out there. She's working
[48:00] hard. She's trying to make ends meet.
[48:04] She's just trying to survive. She's had
[48:07] sorrow in her life. She's trying to cope
[48:10] with that. She's got a relationship with
[48:13] her mother-in-law and she doesn't know
[48:15] what the future is. Uh we can all
[48:20] uh identify ourselves with parts of her
[48:23] life.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; There's nothing strange about this.
[48:27] She's just exactly
[48:29] uh where you and I are or have been.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; We've we've experienced all those
[48:34] things. This isn't some nice, you know,
[48:37] poetic story. This is real life.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; In our language, this is where the
[48:42] rubber hits the road.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; She's just experiencing everyday things.
[48:48] And furthermore, spiritually speaking,
[48:51] she does not know like you and I, when
[48:55] we first came in contact with this uh
[48:58] the message and the spirit of God, the
[49:01] spirit of Christ be to draw us and speak
[49:04] to us, we didn't know that this was
[49:08] redemption happening. And and
[49:11] furthermore, I I just want you to catch
[49:13] a couple of these things. Now she's
[49:15] picking up gleaning is picking up seeds
[49:18] that other reapers have dropped.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; So she's actually living on
[49:26] seed that doesn't mean enough to others
[49:29] to pick it up.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; And the revelation that you got and the
[49:35] revelation that you live on is what
[49:38] others have dropped.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in that.
[49:41] Hallelujah.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; And those are seeds of redemption.
[49:45] [Music]
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; So, she's in a field of redemption,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; picking up seeds of redemption
[49:55] &gt;&gt; under the instruction of the redeemer
[49:57] himself.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Things don't get much better, do they?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Can't hardly wait till Sunday.
[50:10] And so she needs a lot of things done
[50:12] for her,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; but she perhaps doesn't she may not
[50:17] fully understand even what he's saying.
[50:20] I will do all I will do to thee all that
[50:24] thou requireest.
[50:27] And then in the 18th verse,
[50:30] then then said she,
[50:33] uh, this is Naomi now speaking to Ruth.
[50:37] Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter,
[50:41] until thou know how the matter will
[50:44] fall.
[50:45] For the man will not be in rest until he
[50:49] hath finished the thing this day." In
[50:52] other words, he is going to finish this
[50:54] work of redemption. And and and and so
[50:58] she's instructing her, "Just sit still,
[51:00] my daughter, until thou know how the
[51:02] matter will fall, for the man will not
[51:06] be in rest." In other words, he has
[51:08] started something and he's not going to
[51:10] stop till this whole program is
[51:13] finished.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; What glorious instruction. He's going to
[51:22] finish the work of redemption. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And in the fourth chapter verse 5
[51:32] now he has now Boaz has determined to uh
[51:37] uh do the work of redemption. There was
[51:40] a nearer kinsman. We won't get into that
[51:42] right now. And he said he cannot he he
[51:45] he he would redeem Naomi but he felt it
[51:50] would mar his inheritance if he redeemed
[51:53] Ruth as well. And so he says and and
[51:57] then said Boaz the fifth verse of the
[51:59] fourth chapter. What day thou buyest the
[52:03] field of the hand of Naomi,
[52:05] thou must buy it also of Ruth the
[52:08] Moabitis, for the wife of the dead, to
[52:12] raise up the name of the dead upon his
[52:15] inheritance. That was the stickler
[52:19] &gt;&gt; right there.
[52:21] If the day that you buy and purchase and
[52:23] redeem Naomi's estate, you will you must
[52:27] also buy it of Ruth. And the thing with
[52:32] Ruth was that you had to go further
[52:34] because redemption. Now, I'm going to
[52:36] just say something that is is is
[52:41] uh something that I had to really think
[52:43] about for the last two three days.
[52:46] Redemption was not just the purchasing
[52:48] of a parcel of ground.
[52:51] or
[52:53] uh redeeming a a a lost estate. In so
[52:57] doing, because redemption is connected
[53:00] with inheritance,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; and inheritance had to uh depended upon
[53:08] uh uh a lineage
[53:10] &gt;&gt; that could inherit it, right? And you'll
[53:13] find it. I I'll have it for you if not
[53:15] tonight, Sunday, and show you that Moses
[53:18] gave strict instructions.
[53:21] If if uh if this one could not uh
[53:25] inherit it, if there was no one to
[53:28] inherit it, then a brother would inherit
[53:29] it. If the brother couldn't inherit it,
[53:31] then uh daughters would inherit it.
[53:34] daughters, there's other siblings, other
[53:36] members, and even the brother of the of
[53:39] the father. It had to stay within the
[53:42] tribe. It had to stay there had to be an
[53:44] ongoing, in other words, redemption also
[53:47] had to have continuity.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And it had to have continuity within the
[53:52] framework of the family.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so rich, friends. I just
[53:57] need to I need to say that to you.
[54:01] And so he's he's saying that and when
[54:04] he's saying it before the people and
[54:06] what day thou buyest the field of the
[54:08] hand of Naomi thou must buy it also of
[54:11] Ruth the Moabitis the wife of the dead
[54:14] to raise up the name of the dead upon
[54:17] his inheritance and that is to raise up
[54:19] children. Right. Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; That's why
[54:24] that's why in the New Testament, the
[54:27] Pharisees, scribes and Pharisees and
[54:29] leaders said to Jesus, "There was a man
[54:31] and he had his wife and and he didn't
[54:34] have any children and uh and he died."
[54:38] And then his brother took him and he
[54:40] died. And the next brother took him and
[54:43] there were so a number of brothers and
[54:45] they all had her the wife in the
[54:47] resurrection. whose wife shall she be?
[54:50] And he said that they don't know the
[54:52] power of God. And they just he he
[54:55] rebuked them because they didn't
[54:56] understand what they were talking about.
[54:59] And uh and so now what they were what
[55:02] they were referring to is the law of
[55:04] redemption in the Old Testament. And so
[55:08] now redemption refers not only to a
[55:10] parcel of ground. Thus it was not only
[55:14] that a physical parcel of ground be
[55:17] redeemed, but that also that seed should
[55:20] be raised up to give continuity to the
[55:23] inheritance. And so redemption is tied
[55:27] to inheritance.
[55:30] Boaz clearly states that his
[55:33] responsibility is to raise up the name
[55:36] of the dead upon his inheritance.
[55:42] Now, just if you think that we're way
[55:44] off in left field, we're not. You have
[55:47] an inheritance, but it's in Christ.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; And Paul caught this in Romans and he
[55:54] said, he said in Romans 7, and brother
[55:57] Brennham takes that for the in, I
[55:59] believe, the invisible union of the
[56:01] bride message. Notice I'm giving you a
[56:04] lot to think about, but he used it in
[56:06] the invisible union of the bride uh
[56:09] message and it was at a thanksgiving. He
[56:11] said, "What a thanksgiving message."
[56:15] &gt;&gt; And he goes to Romans 7. Know he not
[56:17] that a a woman is bound to her husband
[56:20] by the law of her husband as long as as
[56:23] he liveth. But if he's dead, if he dies,
[56:26] then she's free from the law of her
[56:28] husband. and and the and the prophet
[56:30] starts speaking h about that. Now, I'm
[56:33] just giving you a quick overview just so
[56:35] you can kind of see where I'm going. He
[56:37] says, "And but if their husband be dead,
[56:39] then she's no longer bound. She's free
[56:42] from the law of her husband." But then
[56:44] he goes right into and Apostle Paul
[56:46] says, um, he says this,
[56:50] "So then, if while her husband liveth,
[56:53] she be married to another man, she shall
[56:55] be called an adulteress. But if her
[56:58] husband be dead, she is free from that
[57:01] law. Free from that law, so that she is
[57:04] no adulteress, though she be married to
[57:06] another man. Wherefore, my brethren, ye
[57:10] also are become dead to the law by the
[57:13] body of Christ,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; that you should be married to another,
[57:20] &gt;&gt; even
[57:22] to him who is raised from the dead.
[57:26] So
[57:28] I'm going to say a mouthful now. There's
[57:31] the the church world for much of the
[57:35] church world at least. They are actually
[57:38] married to and united to the Jesus who
[57:42] walked here. Now be spiritual if you
[57:44] would please. The Jesus who walked here
[57:47] a little over 2,000 years ago. Apostle
[57:50] Paul is saying that's not it's not that
[57:54] physical attachment that we're married
[57:58] to. We're married to another. He died so
[58:02] that he could rise. And the one that
[58:05] rose was significantly different than
[58:07] the one that died. The one that died got
[58:10] older. The one that rose doesn't age.
[58:13] The one that died died carrying the sins
[58:16] of the world. the one that rose, he he
[58:19] was finished with it. The battle was
[58:21] over. Sin was dealt with.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And he says, "So that you could be
[58:26] married to another, even him that is
[58:29] raised from the dead, so that you can
[58:31] bear fruit unto him."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; This has to do with inheritance. This
[58:37] has to do with redemption.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus. Now we say the bride
[58:45] of Christ. The bride of Christ. the
[58:46] bride of Christ. Just please keep this
[58:49] in mind. Jesus didn't take a wife. The
[58:53] lamb didn't take a wife to be childless.
[58:56] He took a wife to bring forth fruit unto
[58:59] himself.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; We are those that replicate. We are
[59:02] those that reproduce.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's the ministry of
[59:07] Christ even within the body of Jesus
[59:09] Christ is bringing forth other children.
[59:13] And so that Jesus could say, "Behold, I
[59:16] and the brethren thou hast given me.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Behold, I and the family that you've
[59:20] given me."
[59:22] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said to through
[59:24] Isaiah, "Where's my family? Where's my
[59:27] house? Where's my household?" In other
[59:29] words, the heavens my hand is made and
[59:32] the earth is my foottool. Where's my
[59:34] children? Where's my house? Where's my
[59:37] family? And we can say now with what we
[59:40] have uh what we understand through a
[59:42] message in this time and the fullness of
[59:45] redemption, the fullness of redemption
[59:47] is somebody died and Ruth's husband
[59:50] died. He had to die.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; You you don't try to figure these things
[59:56] out. Uh Uriah died.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Even Even David played a hand in having
[1:00:02] him killed. But he had to die because
[1:00:05] she had to be married to another one who
[1:00:07] was David.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; You say amen if you want. I'll still
[1:00:13] preach. Even if you don't say amen. He
[1:00:15] had to die because she had to bring
[1:00:17] forth Solomon. And Uriah could never
[1:00:20] bring forth Solomon.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; These all are deeper truths than you
[1:00:27] know than we just take on the surface.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And there's deeper things happening in
[1:00:31] the book of Ruth. And there are deeper
[1:00:33] things happening with you in this
[1:00:35] message of redemption than you ever
[1:00:38] dreamed of. Ruth never grasped. She
[1:00:41] couldn't even begin to comprehend what
[1:00:43] was happening while it was happening.
[1:00:46] And we are not comprehending what is
[1:00:48] happening now.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Really what's happening?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; You think that she could well she's out
[1:00:54] there picking a seed trying to survive
[1:00:56] and not even knowing she's in the field
[1:00:58] of redemption. And she's she's bearing
[1:01:01] she's bringing forth seeds of
[1:01:02] redemption. She's bringing them back to
[1:01:04] Naomi. Do you think that she's going
[1:01:06] along saying, "Oh, isn't it wonderful?
[1:01:08] The God of Israel is going to bring
[1:01:11] forth the line lineage of the kings
[1:01:13] through me." Not a chance. I wasn't in
[1:01:16] her mind. And you don't even you you
[1:01:19] haven't got a clue what God is doing.
[1:01:21] You You're just out here struggling day
[1:01:23] by day trying to pay your bills to
[1:01:25] trying to put enough food on the table.
[1:01:28] That's what she was doing. And she had
[1:01:30] sorrow in her life and we have sorrow in
[1:01:32] our lives and we're trying to deal with
[1:01:35] different relationships and she was
[1:01:36] trying to deal with it and all of these
[1:01:38] things. It's exactly the same. But she
[1:01:41] was being redeemed.
[1:01:44] Hallelujah. She was right in the field
[1:01:46] of redemption. And I will say to you
[1:01:49] that uh on the authority of what the
[1:01:51] prophet of God has said and he spoke
[1:01:54] about uh uh he spoke on and you can get
[1:01:56] it in the rising of the sun, the one
[1:01:59] that is risen now and the one who's
[1:02:02] demonstrating himself now. And he said
[1:02:05] like it is today and he describes of all
[1:02:08] about Boaz and then he goes right back
[1:02:10] and speaks about Christ that was risen
[1:02:13] and he's and he's alive and risen now.
[1:02:16] So he ties what was back there with what
[1:02:19] is happening now.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So now the right we talk
[1:02:27] about the rights of redemption had also
[1:02:30] to do with bringing forth seed,
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; bringing forth children to inherit
[1:02:39] on behalf of the one that died
[1:02:42] and did or could not bring forth a
[1:02:45] child.
[1:02:47] So redemption has a much greater meaning
[1:02:50] in the Bible than for a kinsman to
[1:02:52] merely buy back the estate of the family
[1:02:56] member.
[1:02:57] And uh there's several times brother
[1:03:00] Brandham refers to the lost estate.
[1:03:04] You see the lost estate wasn't
[1:03:07] money in the bank or a piece of ground
[1:03:10] or whatever. That wasn't only the lost
[1:03:13] estate. the lost estate was
[1:03:16] something that was inherited.
[1:03:19] Now, just so on on Sunday, I'll want to
[1:03:22] go back. I'll go into this in more
[1:03:24] detail, but you know, we we we may not
[1:03:28] think of that God is mindful of certain
[1:03:30] specific places. And I thought, well, I
[1:03:33] was thinking about that and I begin to
[1:03:35] look into the scripture and uh
[1:03:40] the Bible says that the earth is the
[1:03:42] Lord's and the fullness thereof. So, he
[1:03:45] owns everything.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; The earth is the Lord's and the fullness
[1:03:49] thereof.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; So, but then but then we find out that
[1:03:54] he planted a garden and I'll be going
[1:03:56] into this more detail, so don't don't
[1:03:58] feel I'm just repeating it on Sunday.
[1:04:00] But then he planted a garden and and it
[1:04:02] was east of Eden.
[1:04:05] And then in the midst of the garden,
[1:04:07] these are all places. These are all s
[1:04:11] specific spots. And in the midst of the
[1:04:14] garden was the tree of life. And then
[1:04:17] you go on down and then uh Adam and Eve
[1:04:21] are dismissed out of the garden. They're
[1:04:23] sent out from this place. And then you
[1:04:26] find uh uh this same God. Now he's going
[1:04:29] to commence uh the whole plan of
[1:04:32] redemption. He's going to uh choose
[1:04:35] Abraham. And he speaks to Abram. Abram.
[1:04:38] He's not Abraham yet, but he speaks to
[1:04:40] Abram and tells him where to go. And he
[1:04:44] goes and then when he when he he meets
[1:04:47] him there and he tells him to this land
[1:04:50] now where he's gone because he's been
[1:04:52] obedient. I'm going to give you and I'm
[1:04:55] going to give your seed this land from
[1:04:58] the great river from the river Euphrates
[1:05:00] to the great river of Egypt. And he
[1:05:03] begins to give the actual parameters of
[1:05:05] that land. And not just the parameters
[1:05:08] of the land, but I'm giving this land to
[1:05:10] your seed
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; for an inheritance.
[1:05:15] And the and the prophet of God tells us
[1:05:18] so we can bring it right up to this
[1:05:20] morning or this evening rather that it
[1:05:22] that the promised land is your life in
[1:05:26] the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Now a promise
[1:05:32] is not merely an inheritance.
[1:05:36] A promise is not nearly merely an
[1:05:38] inheritance because an inheritance is
[1:05:41] actually a possession.
[1:05:44] It's something that you actually possess
[1:05:47] and you uh uh you you you may enjoy it
[1:05:53] and without even knowing. The reason I'm
[1:05:56] being a little cautious is because we're
[1:05:58] streaming and people be listening to
[1:06:00] this elsewhere. you're you're sitting
[1:06:02] here in the church and and uh you know
[1:06:04] children are going to school and you go
[1:06:07] down to the camp and all this and so on
[1:06:09] and so forth and
[1:06:12] but we we perhaps don't know exactly how
[1:06:15] it all happens. I don't know how it all
[1:06:18] happens. I know that the people work,
[1:06:21] the people give, and so on so forth. But
[1:06:24] I was, and I'm I'm trying to be
[1:06:26] sensitive about this, but there's a man
[1:06:29] who none of you have met.
[1:06:32] And uh he's a very
[1:06:37] um he he's a man if he were here, he
[1:06:41] would not be visible. Uh he would not
[1:06:44] you would have a difficulty getting any
[1:06:46] words out of him. I've had he became a
[1:06:50] good friend of mine. I I had difficulty
[1:06:53] having conversation with him because he
[1:06:55] didn't say anything and I'd ask him a
[1:06:58] question and he would you yeah you know
[1:07:01] and answer the question and so on and uh
[1:07:05] I met him a lot of years ago.
[1:07:09] He passed away
[1:07:12] and left
[1:07:14] almost his entire estate
[1:07:18] to the Lord's work to this church and
[1:07:22] the missions and the Lord's work and it
[1:07:25] was several hundred,000.
[1:07:28] Now you don't know anything about that
[1:07:30] and that is some time ago. That's not,
[1:07:33] you know, ages ago. That's in recent
[1:07:35] times.
[1:07:37] you don't know anything about that. And
[1:07:39] so people have wondered, you know, well,
[1:07:41] how are we able to, you know, doing this
[1:07:43] and doing that? It's because, and that's
[1:07:46] only happened once in our we've been,
[1:07:49] you know, next year is our 40th
[1:07:51] anniversary
[1:07:53] here in Cloverdale.
[1:07:55] Should we have a meeting?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I I think it's time to say hallelujah.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; But we don't know anything about that.
[1:08:04] We We don't know. and we're sitting here
[1:08:06] and you know we're enjoying things and
[1:08:09] we're you know just going on and maybe
[1:08:12] it be the missions and this is happening
[1:08:14] and we're rejoicing it but we don't know
[1:08:16] how it happens. Ruth is out there and
[1:08:19] she's just plucking a seed here and a
[1:08:22] seed there and getting a little bit and
[1:08:24] going back to her mother-in-law and and
[1:08:26] you know trying to survive and and here
[1:08:29] in and God in the meantime is doing
[1:08:32] something way beyond her understanding.
[1:08:35] And it's not it's not God that comes
[1:08:38] down and and details everything and this
[1:08:40] is what's happening and this is what I'm
[1:08:42] doing and this is where you're going and
[1:08:43] this is your reward and all of these
[1:08:46] wonderful things things that we would
[1:08:47] like to know but we don't need to know.
[1:08:50] It's like the disciples saying to the
[1:08:51] Lord Jesus, oh cuz now he had the
[1:08:54] resurrection just happened just happened
[1:08:56] a month a month and a half ago. He said
[1:08:57] is this a time now you're going to
[1:08:59] restore the kingdom to Israel? and they
[1:09:01] told him it's not for you to know the
[1:09:03] times of the seasons. They actually have
[1:09:05] described that down.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; I often think of that. How would you
[1:09:10] feel about being one of the fellows who
[1:09:11] want to ask the question then he tells
[1:09:13] you it's none of your business. It's
[1:09:15] none of my business.
[1:09:18] It's not for you to know the times of
[1:09:20] the seasons God put in his own hand. But
[1:09:23] they had to write that too cuz that was
[1:09:25] also the words of Jesus.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; All kinds of things we want to know. We
[1:09:30] just love to know all these things, but
[1:09:32] we don't need to know. And and I it's
[1:09:34] enough for us to know that what we don't
[1:09:37] know is more wonderful than what you do
[1:09:39] know.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] So now the estate, when you talk about
[1:09:48] the estate, Naomi's estate didn't just
[1:09:52] involve some ground. It involved her.
[1:09:58] It involved all that her life was. It
[1:10:01] didn't involve
[1:10:03] Orpa because she had gone back to her
[1:10:06] gods. But it involved Ruth. There she
[1:10:09] had her. That's when she made her
[1:10:11] glorious decision. Where you go, I go.
[1:10:15] Your people be my people. She doesn't
[1:10:18] even know your God will be my God. She
[1:10:20] doesn't even understand what she's
[1:10:22] saying.
[1:10:24] You must understand what I'm saying
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; when I say she doesn't understand what
[1:10:28] she was saying or what she didn't
[1:10:30] realize the implication of it and where
[1:10:33] it was going to carry her. But that was
[1:10:35] a glorious decision. And brother
[1:10:38] Brandham talks about Ruth deciding and
[1:10:40] Ruth serving and Ruth rewarded and so on
[1:10:43] the four stages of her life.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; But the estate, the lost estate included
[1:10:50] her.
[1:10:52] And it didn't only included include her.
[1:10:55] It included the fact that there was a
[1:10:58] responsibility
[1:10:59] to raise up children to her on the head
[1:11:03] of her husband.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; So that the inheritance could continue.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I have to just hold myself back. Now, if
[1:11:18] you want to turn to Numbers, the 27th
[1:11:20] chapter,
[1:11:23] and I'll just warn you ahead of time.
[1:11:25] I'm probably going to close the service
[1:11:26] before you want to go home, but
[1:11:32] we're only going to carry it so far. And
[1:11:35] and I know you got a busy schedule.
[1:11:38] Numbers the 27th chapter, and we'll uh
[1:11:41] start with verse 8. And thou shalt
[1:11:44] speak, God telling Moses, now thou shalt
[1:11:46] speak unto the children of Israel,
[1:11:48] saying, if a man die and have no son,
[1:11:53] then you then you shall cause his
[1:11:56] inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
[1:12:00] So now the inheritance becomes very very
[1:12:05] important. It happens to be a key issue
[1:12:08] in the Bible. and you have an
[1:12:12] inheritance. Friends, let me just stop
[1:12:14] here and you can look this way for a
[1:12:16] moment. An inheritance. We say, well,
[1:12:19] there's many, many promises. I like the
[1:12:22] message that brother Tom preached and
[1:12:24] that spoke to brother uh Ricardo so
[1:12:27] powerfully
[1:12:29] when he spoke on unclaimed promises. Oh
[1:12:33] yeah, they're there and we agree with
[1:12:35] them and they're good and all these
[1:12:37] things and it belongs to somebody. Maybe
[1:12:40] it belongs to the preacher. I don't
[1:12:42] know, but maybe I might need it. Uh
[1:12:46] and he talked about all the things that
[1:12:48] came back from the campus sitting out
[1:12:49] here in the fellowship room and it it
[1:12:51] belonged to somebody belong to you kids
[1:12:54] belong to somebody's family. We couldn't
[1:12:57] get them picked up till we're making
[1:12:59] announcements. If you don't pick it up,
[1:13:00] we're sending it to the Salvation Army.
[1:13:03] And it's always been a marvel to me,
[1:13:05] brother Richard Drake, I think he sent
[1:13:08] some tons of stuff overseas that he just
[1:13:10] picks up that people leave on the buses.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, brother Richard?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Well, wherever he gets it.
[1:13:25] I've talked to the I've talked to the
[1:13:26] airlines and they've told me, "You
[1:13:29] wouldn't believe what people leave on
[1:13:31] the airplanes."
[1:13:34] Well, somebody got a beautiful leather
[1:13:36] coat of mine cuz I just got off and ran
[1:13:38] right back in and it was gone.
[1:13:43] And thou shalt speak unto the children
[1:13:45] of Israel, saying, If a man die and have
[1:13:47] no son, verse 8, then thou then you
[1:13:50] shall cause his inheritance to pass unto
[1:13:53] his daughter. And if he have no
[1:13:56] daughter, then you shall give his
[1:13:58] inheritance unto his brethren. And if he
[1:14:01] have no brethren, then you shall give
[1:14:03] his inheritance unto his father's
[1:14:06] brethren. And if his father have no
[1:14:08] brethren, then you shall give his
[1:14:10] inheritance unto his kinsman that is
[1:14:13] next to him for his family, and he shall
[1:14:17] possess it.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; That's the key. He shall possess it.
[1:14:21] This inheritance isn't something to hang
[1:14:23] on the wall.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; This inheritance isn't something say,
[1:14:26] "Oh, I got a promise. I I I'm left in
[1:14:29] some will." That's not what he's talking
[1:14:31] about. This is a real possession. And
[1:14:35] the word inheritance in the Bible is to
[1:14:38] possess it.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It's not something that somebody just
[1:14:41] promised you. Says, "Oh, God has given
[1:14:43] so many promises in his in his word."
[1:14:46] That's not sufficient. You have to come
[1:14:49] to the place to say that promise I have
[1:14:52] claimed it and it is mine. I actually
[1:14:55] possess it now. And once you possess it,
[1:14:58] then what are you going to do with it?
[1:14:59] Come on.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; You know, this man left an inheritance
[1:15:04] to this church and to the Lord's work.
[1:15:07] And I can tell you, we didn't just stuff
[1:15:09] it in a sack and bury it in the ground.
[1:15:12] No, it's there to be used. It's there
[1:15:15] for the people to benefit from. It's
[1:15:18] there that somebody hears the gospel.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it's all about? That's
[1:15:24] what our life is all about. And that the
[1:15:26] kingdom of God is filled. And what do we
[1:15:29] talk about when we say until the last
[1:15:32] seed comes in? That's the last child.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And the children are part of the
[1:15:38] inheritance.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; It's not just some promises. It's
[1:15:42] reality.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; It's people.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the children.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; That are predestinated
[1:15:52] and they must come. And that's part of
[1:15:54] our inheritance. We're going to rejoice
[1:15:57] when we see we say, "Well, I didn't know
[1:16:00] that, you know, my life was having that
[1:16:02] kind of influence." God doesn't have to
[1:16:04] explain that to us.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to tell us all of those
[1:16:08] things.
[1:16:13] And so the you can't read these few
[1:16:15] verses about four verses without finding
[1:16:18] out very quickly that the emphasis is on
[1:16:22] the inheritance.
[1:16:24] Right.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; And it's not just the children of Israel
[1:16:27] having some inheritance in a piece of
[1:16:29] ground. Our inheritance is much richer
[1:16:32] than that and goes far beyond uh just
[1:16:35] that. For unto this people, now we want
[1:16:38] to go turn to Joshua please. The first
[1:16:41] chapter
[1:16:49] and the first verse.
[1:16:52] Now after the death of Moses, the
[1:16:54] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[1:16:56] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[1:16:59] of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses my
[1:17:04] servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go
[1:17:08] over this Jordan, thou and all this
[1:17:10] people unto the land which I do give to
[1:17:14] them, even to the children of Israel.
[1:17:17] Every place that the soul of your feet
[1:17:20] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[1:17:24] you. Brother Brandham says footsteps are
[1:17:27] possession.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; I have given unto you as I said unto
[1:17:31] Moses, from the wilderness, and this
[1:17:34] Lebanon, even unto the great river, the
[1:17:37] river Euphrates, all the land of the
[1:17:40] Hittites, and unto the great sea toward
[1:17:43] the going down of the sun, shall be your
[1:17:46] coast. This is God speaking.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And God spoke in this generation. And
[1:17:51] you know what he said? Your name is Mrs.
[1:17:53] Bishop and you live at such and such an
[1:17:56] address. He knew I would say at that
[1:17:59] moment that became a sacred thing to
[1:18:02] that individual. Oh, don't they call you
[1:18:04] Mary or don't they call you something
[1:18:06] else? And your your address and where
[1:18:09] you live is this. You live in a city. I
[1:18:12] see a city. It's a it's got a lot of
[1:18:15] trees. It's not this city. It's another
[1:18:17] city. And here's the same God
[1:18:20] identifying where that person lives.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; And that God has come down.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; To give them what the city couldn't give
[1:18:30] them, the social net couldn't give them.
[1:18:33] Nothing else could give it. Uh uh the
[1:18:36] unemployment insurance couldn't give it.
[1:18:38] Nothing else could give it. But now God
[1:18:41] himself had come down and was speaking
[1:18:45] through a messenger telling them where
[1:18:47] they live to help them believe the
[1:18:50] promise so it can go from a promise to
[1:18:52] an inheritance.
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; And I want this congregation and all who
[1:18:59] are listening and streaming, it needs to
[1:19:02] go from a promise to a possession.
[1:19:08] If you just live it in the promise and
[1:19:10] well, it's out here someplace. It's out
[1:19:12] here. Your life will turn all kinds of
[1:19:14] dips and circles. But when you have a
[1:19:17] possession and it's in the bank, you're
[1:19:19] not hoping anymore. You got it.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have it.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That's important, friends. I don't want
[1:19:32] a pie in the sky religion.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; I don't want something that just got a
[1:19:36] bunch of hope up there. I want reality
[1:19:39] down here.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; And there shall
[1:19:48] verse five. There shall not any man be
[1:19:51] able to stand before thee all the days
[1:19:53] of thy life. As I was with Moses, so
[1:19:57] will I be with thee. I will not fail
[1:20:00] thee, nor forsake thee. Be strong and of
[1:20:04] a good courage. Now, here's why he wants
[1:20:07] them to be strong and of a good courage.
[1:20:09] For unto this people,
[1:20:13] this people shalt thou divide for an
[1:20:16] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[1:20:20] their fathers to give to them. Just stop
[1:20:23] there for a moment. The earth is the
[1:20:25] Lord's and the fullness thereof. But now
[1:20:28] you can't read these few verses without
[1:20:30] coming to the realization and confess
[1:20:33] that this is a there's a very special
[1:20:36] place on this earth that says the earth
[1:20:39] is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.
[1:20:41] Now suddenly a certain spot has become
[1:20:44] very very sacred and very important
[1:20:47] because now God in his mind says I have
[1:20:49] a man his name is Abraham. He I even
[1:20:53] took a part of my name and inserted his
[1:20:55] name. He's my friend.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's barren. And I'm
[1:21:01] going to give his wife and him a son.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give him a son of promise.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; God never spoke about all the others
[1:21:09] that were given, but he spoke about that
[1:21:11] one. I'm giving him a son of promise
[1:21:14] because God is speaking his own heart
[1:21:16] because I have a son who is a son of
[1:21:19] promise. Hallelujah. I'm going to give
[1:21:22] him Isaac, but my son will be Jesus
[1:21:24] Christ. Hallelujah. And I've got to give
[1:21:28] him I've got to give him so that the the
[1:21:31] the inheritance that slipped out of
[1:21:34] Adam's hands can continue. And and
[1:21:38] because he died, somebody has to die uh
[1:21:41] to bring forth seed and life on the head
[1:21:45] of this one who died. So there was a
[1:21:47] first Adam, but there has to be a second
[1:21:49] Adam.
[1:21:53] Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Let me see a little bit where I want to
[1:21:56] go.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Only be thou strong. Verse seven. Only
[1:22:03] be thou strong and very courageous, that
[1:22:06] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:22:09] all the law which Moses my servant
[1:22:12] commanded thee. Turn not from it to the
[1:22:15] right hand or to the left, that thou
[1:22:17] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[1:22:21] And now Joshua 24 and verse 28
[1:22:36] short verse but I want you to say it.
[1:22:40] So Joshua let the people depart every
[1:22:44] man
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; unto his inheritance.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I would like the congregation to read it
[1:22:49] together. So Joshua, let the people
[1:22:53] depart, every man unto his inheritance.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Every man, every person. You're sitting
[1:23:02] here on a Wednesday night, but as far as
[1:23:05] God's mind is concerned, and those of
[1:23:07] you that are streaming, I'm saying this
[1:23:09] with a certain conviction in my own
[1:23:12] heart. God who gave the promise now is
[1:23:16] saying and and he's saying to now Joshua
[1:23:20] he's saying now you go and take the
[1:23:22] people and you div and you bring them
[1:23:25] into their inheritance and divide the
[1:23:27] inheritance to them. They actually did
[1:23:28] it by lots and at the end of the book
[1:23:31] they every man departed and went and
[1:23:35] possessed his inheritance. Listen
[1:23:38] friends, that's the program.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; And this message has to go far beyond
[1:23:43] just a message, a book that you read or
[1:23:46] a taste that you hear. It must those
[1:23:49] promises must become possessions to you.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; I own that.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; That is mine. This obstacle comes this
[1:23:58] seems to be in reverse. It's not in
[1:24:00] reverse. God who gave this promise, I
[1:24:03] already have possessed it. I take it as
[1:24:06] a possession.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; And you don't hope for a possession.
[1:24:10] That is why faith is the substance of
[1:24:13] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[1:24:16] not seen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Faith when you actually have come full
[1:24:20] circle and you've gone from promise to
[1:24:23] possession, then you don't have to
[1:24:25] anymore uh worry about it or be
[1:24:28] concerned about it. You possess it.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; You know, if you said, "Well, uh uh you
[1:24:36] know, someone has promised me something
[1:24:38] and they've promised me whatever
[1:24:41] whatever and and and someone promised me
[1:24:44] their car. Someone promised me $1,000 or
[1:24:48] whatever it is, and and now you have it
[1:24:50] and it's been given to you. You have it
[1:24:52] in the bank or you have the car in your
[1:24:54] parking lot or your driveway. You don't
[1:24:58] say, you don't go, you know, twisting
[1:25:00] and ringing your hands and oh, I just
[1:25:03] hope I hope I get that car. It's sitting
[1:25:05] right out there.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Just have a look at it. It's a reality.
[1:25:13] Faith will make the promise real.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Faith will make the promise a substance.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And that's why that is what I am so
[1:25:23] thrilled with with the prophets
[1:25:26] ministry. And I don't want to just leave
[1:25:27] it back on the prophet because a lot of
[1:25:29] people say, "Well, he did it." No, he
[1:25:31] did it so that you could do it.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; He did it to give an example.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it is a reality,
[1:25:40] friends. And I can tell you amongst the
[1:25:42] bride of Jesus Christ, there are
[1:25:44] supernatural things that are happening
[1:25:46] on a daily and a regular basis.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Because you don't hear it doesn't mean
[1:25:52] it's not happening. And then you go on
[1:25:54] down the road a little while and then
[1:25:56] you find out it did happen
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; and it is happening.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Then you say, "Well, praise the Lord."
[1:26:02] Praise the Lord before it happens.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Demonstrate your faith.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; That's what he loves to see and hear.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Just a few more minutes. Even then on
[1:26:17] into Judges, it says Judges 2 and six,
[1:26:20] which is the next book uh or the yeah
[1:26:23] the book before rather. And when and
[1:26:25] when Joshua let the people go, the
[1:26:28] children of Israel went every man unto
[1:26:30] his inheritance to possess the land.
[1:26:34] Unto this people shalt thou divide for
[1:26:36] an inheritance the land that I swear
[1:26:39] unto their fathers. That's what it's all
[1:26:41] about. God is saying, "I have swore this
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; under I'm under oath
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; that this must happen. This is their
[1:26:51] inheritance."
[1:26:52] He
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; said, "Well, this this king failed and
[1:26:55] that and they've gone into they've gone
[1:26:58] into captivity. They've gone into
[1:27:00] Babylon. Didn't change anything.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Didn't change anything. And you can just
[1:27:06] as listen young people you even if you
[1:27:10] read the newspapers or hear the news at
[1:27:13] all or are in touch with it and you
[1:27:16] adults you know right well the world's
[1:27:19] in an upheaval.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; But do you know with all of this they've
[1:27:23] called it the
[1:27:25] in the Middle East I think they call it
[1:27:27] the Arab Spring or something. I I heard
[1:27:30] quite a bit about while while I was in
[1:27:32] Europe
[1:27:34] and uh and now they're thinking that
[1:27:36] maybe Russia is actually having it
[1:27:38] because Mr. Putin is having he got
[1:27:41] himself voted in or at least they think
[1:27:42] that he got himself voted in. There's
[1:27:45] tens of thousands and normally they
[1:27:46] would crush any kind of uprising like
[1:27:49] that but there's tens of thousands all
[1:27:51] the way through Siberia and up into
[1:27:53] Moscow and all over raising. They said
[1:27:56] it's a it's the most uh riots that
[1:27:59] they've had in Russia for for I guess
[1:28:02] decades. And normally they would never
[1:28:04] have allowed it, but it's too too big to
[1:28:07] for it to uh to put down. They can't
[1:28:10] quell that. But they're talking about
[1:28:12] this and how it started. So they're
[1:28:14] saying they're hoping that maybe what
[1:28:16] happened in the Middle East, it happened
[1:28:18] here and happened in Europe and happened
[1:28:20] and we got occupy and United States and
[1:28:23] Canada and all the rest of it. But
[1:28:25] everybody jumps on the bandwagon and a
[1:28:27] lot of people perhaps don't even know
[1:28:29] what the what the cause or what the real
[1:28:31] objective is at all. They're just out
[1:28:33] there to hoot and holler and be a part
[1:28:35] of something. You have to forgive me if
[1:28:37] you don't agree with that. But
[1:28:39] nevertheless,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; but if you read in the fine line or the
[1:28:44] small print,
[1:28:46] when I say small print, it's because
[1:28:48] it's just maybe a just a paragraph, not
[1:28:51] even a paragraph, a line or two. And all
[1:28:54] of this was happening. It happened in
[1:28:56] Tunisia and then in uh Egypt and then uh
[1:29:00] Libya and all and it's happening even
[1:29:04] right now still in Syria and uh
[1:29:07] thousands have been killed and and
[1:29:09] they're crushing it with tanks and big
[1:29:11] guns. This is happening while we're
[1:29:12] sitting here.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; The terrible unrest. But you'll find one
[1:29:18] line, a common denominator in all of
[1:29:21] them, that the world nations have to
[1:29:25] make peace with Palestine,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that's all about?
[1:29:33] That's all about what God said.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; I'll give them the land from the
[1:29:39] Euphrates down to the great river of
[1:29:41] Egypt from the sea over to this place.
[1:29:45] And you go on to Google and just get the
[1:29:47] original map of the promised land and
[1:29:50] you'll see what the trouble's all about
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; cuz the devil's howling cuz it's places
[1:29:55] that he squatted on.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:00] and they'd probably throw me in jail and
[1:30:02] shoot me for saying something like that
[1:30:03] in certain parts of the world, but
[1:30:05] that's what this Bible says.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And those and there are people in
[1:30:10] Israel, there are some people in Israel,
[1:30:13] not many, but there's a few in Israel
[1:30:15] that said what God has said is true
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; and what God has promised is our
[1:30:21] possession.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; And we don't know how, but we believe
[1:30:25] it's going to happen.
[1:30:27] And that's why they are arc enemies and
[1:30:30] considered arc enemies. And the spirit
[1:30:33] that's driving what they call a spring,
[1:30:35] a spirit that's driving that and it's
[1:30:38] just horrific bloodshed and they're
[1:30:40] upsetting the dictators and everything.
[1:30:42] And the world thinks this is all great
[1:30:43] and wonderful. It's fine. But they'll
[1:30:45] find that there's a common denominator
[1:30:47] in all of those uprisings. And I read it
[1:30:50] with my own eyes. I because I'm just
[1:30:52] looking for it as I read the whole
[1:30:54] article. Brother Ernie, then I see. And
[1:30:56] they must make peace with the
[1:30:57] Palestinians. Uhhuh. There you are,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; you serpent.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; You can't hide behind a riot. You can't
[1:31:06] hide behind world news. There you are.
[1:31:09] We already have it in the word of God.
[1:31:11] We have a prophet telling us that that
[1:31:13] God is turning back to them. And and
[1:31:16] this may just sound like so much hot air
[1:31:18] over a pulpit. I can tell you that
[1:31:21] regardless of what the world scene is,
[1:31:23] what this says is is truth.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; What this says is going to happen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; What this says, we got to anchor our
[1:31:31] soul on.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we can stand
[1:31:37] here today and say, "God sent us a
[1:31:40] messenger. God sent us a prophet. And
[1:31:44] you didn't know that you were in a field
[1:31:46] of vindication.
[1:31:48] You didn't know when you were first
[1:31:49] reading your first message that this is
[1:31:51] a field. I'm in the field of redemption.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; And then as as time went on and we've
[1:32:00] experienced this and perhaps we all have
[1:32:03] and and I've had new things come into
[1:32:07] the message
[1:32:09] and great. I mean just so wonderful. The
[1:32:14] only problem was it was in somebody
[1:32:16] else's field.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; So, I'll confess to you because I'm
[1:32:23] going to close now. Anyway, I'll confess
[1:32:25] to you, I have gone up to the fence
[1:32:29] and I did look over
[1:32:32] and it made me go back and study things
[1:32:34] a wee bit. And I kept looking over and
[1:32:37] the more I looked over, the more I found
[1:32:39] that that wasn't really the right field.
[1:32:42] I better stay in this one.
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; And that's why Boaz said, Boaz said,
[1:32:51] redeemer said, don't go in another
[1:32:54] field.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; And the mother of the old Orthodox
[1:33:00] church said, "It's good for you to stay
[1:33:02] in that field. Don't go in another
[1:33:05] field." And that's why we've been so
[1:33:07] strong here over this pulpit. This is
[1:33:10] the message. Don't go looking for some
[1:33:12] other seeds.
[1:33:15] This is the field of redemption.
[1:33:18] This is the word of redemption. And
[1:33:20] these are the seeds that are going to
[1:33:21] bring you to Boaz.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And the further you go along, you'll
[1:33:27] find out, oh my, this is getting rich.
[1:33:31] This is more than Oh my, I don't hardly
[1:33:33] know what to do with this. This is so
[1:33:35] glorious. Of course, because he's
[1:33:37] telling them, drop a little extra down.
[1:33:43] Brother Brandham says, "Oh, don't you
[1:33:45] like getting those handfuls?"
[1:33:47] Hallelujah. And I pray God will give us
[1:33:50] a few handfuls over this weekend.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; And so I'm just going to I'm I'm going
[1:33:59] to just read this quote and we're going
[1:34:01] to be closing so the musicians can get
[1:34:03] ready to come.
[1:34:05] And this is this is from 1953.
[1:34:10] So, I just wanted to drop that in this
[1:34:12] from 1953 before a bunch of you people
[1:34:14] were born.
[1:34:19] I won't ask you, but
[1:34:24] this is on the an end sign. An end sign.
[1:34:29] As Boaz had to be Naomi's kinsman,
[1:34:33] God to redeem the church must be a
[1:34:36] kinsman. And he came down, taken on
[1:34:40] himself the form of sinful flesh. He was
[1:34:43] worthy. He was God's son. He had to be
[1:34:47] worth it. He had all the heavens and all
[1:34:50] the earth. Boaz then gathered Israel.
[1:34:54] And then this is when he was going to
[1:34:56] make his announcement of redemption. And
[1:34:59] then remember the end sign had to be
[1:35:01] lifted up outside the gates of the city.
[1:35:04] Now watch this very very closely. The
[1:35:06] end sign had to be lifted up outside the
[1:35:09] gates of the city. And I want you to get
[1:35:11] it. And Boaz came out there and brought
[1:35:15] the Israel elders and said, "Now, if
[1:35:18] anyone has got anything to say, let them
[1:35:21] say it. And see this day that I have
[1:35:25] redeemed Naomi's lost estate." I didn't
[1:35:28] just redeem Naomi. I've redeemed Naomi's
[1:35:31] lost estate. Everything that's included
[1:35:34] in that. And part of the estate was not
[1:35:37] only Naomi, a physical one, a piece of
[1:35:40] ground, a physical piece of ground, and
[1:35:43] Ruth Moabites uh daughter-in-law, part
[1:35:46] of the estate. But the fact was that she
[1:35:49] had to have seed to raise up a to raise
[1:35:53] up a name upon her upon her dead husband
[1:35:57] so that the inheritance could continue.
[1:36:00] Amen.
[1:36:01] [Music]
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And see this day I've
[1:36:05] redeemed Naomi's lost estate." And he
[1:36:07] kicked off his shoe and threw it amongst
[1:36:10] threw it amongst the Israelites, which
[1:36:12] was the custom and end sign that he had
[1:36:16] redeemed Naomi and all she had. There's
[1:36:20] the son of God. The last paragraph now.
[1:36:23] There's the son of God lifted up for
[1:36:25] your end sign. As Moses lifted up the
[1:36:29] brass serpent in the wilderness, so must
[1:36:32] and just the same way, same cause, same
[1:36:36] thing. Then what did he do when he
[1:36:38] lifted uh when he lifted up there? When
[1:36:42] he God lifted up the end sign to the
[1:36:45] world, he showed to his church. Tonight,
[1:36:49] he showed to the world that he had
[1:36:51] redeemed all the lost estate of the
[1:36:54] church and the people. And what is our
[1:36:58] loss if you have lost your salvation?
[1:37:01] Here's the end sign for the sins of the
[1:37:04] world. What a pity. And then do you mean
[1:37:07] to tell me that you can deny you could
[1:37:10] deny divine healing? There it is in the
[1:37:13] scripture. So he's pointing back. There
[1:37:15] it is in the scripture. And that's what
[1:37:18] Jesus said. Just as Moses lifted up the
[1:37:21] serpent, so must the son of man be
[1:37:23] lifted up. So he's going from Moses to
[1:37:26] Calvary. So must the Son of Man be
[1:37:28] lifted up for sin and sickness. And he's
[1:37:30] here tonight. So he went from Moses went
[1:37:34] from Moses to Calvary, from Calvary to
[1:37:37] 1953. And I feel authorized tonight to
[1:37:41] go from 1953 to 2011.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; He cannot change. He is the same
[1:37:50] yesterday.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Today
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And how thankful we are.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; This God's real.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Healing is real. Salvation is real.
[1:38:07] Deliverance is real. And your
[1:38:09] inheritance is more than a promise.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; It's a reality. Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And he's here tonight. He's still lifted
[1:38:20] up and he has put he was put into the
[1:38:24] grave and God lifted him up and his
[1:38:27] spirit is among us tonight doing the
[1:38:29] doing signs and wonders and he asked do
[1:38:33] you believe it
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; and I say yes
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Lord I believe it.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:43] and you can put it to the test.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; It's not just a promise.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's a possession.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And some of us are perhaps enjoying the
[1:39:00] benefits of the possession
[1:39:02] without even fully realizing.
[1:39:05] You know, it's it's it's something
[1:39:07] that's handed on down. It goes from, you
[1:39:10] know, family to family. But God was so
[1:39:14] uh so determined
[1:39:18] and that's why you can see it all the
[1:39:19] way back to the instructions given to
[1:39:22] Moses. And it the son will it'll go to
[1:39:26] the son. If he hasn't got a son, it'll
[1:39:27] go to the daughter. If he hasn't got a
[1:39:28] daughter, it'll go to uh go to another
[1:39:31] family member. If they haven't got any
[1:39:32] family member, if it go to his brother,
[1:39:34] if he hasn't got a brother, it'll go to
[1:39:35] the nearest kinsman. Somebody's got a In
[1:39:38] other words, what God is saying, there's
[1:39:39] got to be somebody. Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That's close by.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Because this thing has to continue.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends exactly what
[1:39:51] the scripture says of of this kinsman,
[1:39:55] this kinsman that has shown himself
[1:39:58] alive in this day.
[1:40:01] What he had rose up to do
[1:40:04] in this ministry, it's not going to stop
[1:40:07] till it's finished. And when a prophet
[1:40:10] talks about the last seed, you can just
[1:40:12] settle it. The last seed is out there
[1:40:14] someplace. And when he said and when he
[1:40:17] comes in or she comes in, we're out of
[1:40:20] here.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How is that going to I
[1:40:24] don't know how. And I don't care how."
[1:40:26] It's exactly like the disciples asking,
[1:40:28] "Is it now or is it are you going to
[1:40:30] restore the kingdom now?" I'm not
[1:40:32] concerned about how it's going to work
[1:40:34] and the logistics of the whole thing and
[1:40:37] how the sweep and how the body is going
[1:40:39] to change. I don't know. But it's going
[1:40:41] to happen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, the prophet talks about
[1:40:45] those that are left here.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; We don't want to we don't want to major
[1:40:49] on that. But that's a reality also.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks about weeping and
[1:40:54] wailing and nashing of teeth. God help
[1:40:56] us. I I wouldn't I hate to think that
[1:40:59] anybody sat in the congregation and had
[1:41:02] to slip into that kind of an attitude
[1:41:04] and atmosphere. This word is absolutely
[1:41:07] real, friends. And you and I of all
[1:41:10] people of the earth, all the people that
[1:41:12] have lived since there there's the
[1:41:15] people of the Old Testament, just think
[1:41:17] what they would have done if they would
[1:41:19] have uh if they would have had a a
[1:41:22] messenger that told them now, you come
[1:41:25] from a certain city and you come to a
[1:41:26] certain place and your address is such
[1:41:28] and such. I tell you what, God knew
[1:41:30] precisely where they were.
[1:41:34] Right.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Look, God thought so much of it. I'm I'm
[1:41:39] I know I'm taking a couple more minutes,
[1:41:40] but God thought so much of it that when
[1:41:44] Saul was looking for the donkeys of his
[1:41:48] father that were lost that even they
[1:41:51] come before the prophet and he tells
[1:41:54] them, "Oh, they've been found.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; The animals have been found." Yeah.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:42:01] if if if Brother Brandham had said that
[1:42:03] at the platform to somebody said, "Oh,
[1:42:06] you know, the dog that you've been
[1:42:08] looking for or the donkeys that your
[1:42:11] father's been looking for, they're
[1:42:12] found. Don't worry about it. They're
[1:42:14] found." That would hardly find a place
[1:42:18] in a message book,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Well, what's that?" God
[1:42:23] thought enough about that to put it in
[1:42:25] his holy Bible.
[1:42:27] Amen.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not the man.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; It's not the donkeys that did something
[1:42:36] special. It's not any other man. It's
[1:42:38] God who arranged the whole thing.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And God wants people to be simple enough
[1:42:43] to say that is supernatural. That's not
[1:42:46] a man. That's God.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; That's not William Brandham. That's not
[1:42:51] even some people here. This is the
[1:42:53] almighty God that has done this thing.
[1:42:56] And we're going to give him glory for
[1:42:58] that.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, as you do and
[1:43:02] you give him the respect,
[1:43:06] you'll you'll find that he'll just pour
[1:43:08] more out.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; More out all the time.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let Let's stand to our feet,
[1:43:15] would you, please?
[1:43:25] and we're going to tell him how
[1:43:26] wonderful he is.
[1:43:28] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; The word that you have left us
[1:43:37] and the things that you are unfolding to
[1:43:39] us, oh God. And I'm asking you tonight,
[1:43:42] Lord, that you'll prepare the hearts of
[1:43:44] these people. And you see what's on my
[1:43:47] heart and the things I'm holding back
[1:43:49] and the things, oh God, I've been
[1:43:51] pondering, things I've been wondering,
[1:43:53] is this almost too wonderful? Oh God,
[1:43:56] give us supernatural minds. Give us
[1:43:59] understanding. Father, I pray, oh God,
[1:44:02] you lead us by the Holy Spirit that the
[1:44:05] right things will be spoken, the right
[1:44:07] things will be said. Oh God, in the name
[1:44:11] of Jesus Christ, I pray you'll banish
[1:44:14] every question. You'll banish every
[1:44:17] doubt, Father, and that you will uh
[1:44:19] infuse us with a spirit of revelation,
[1:44:23] Lord. I pray you'll bless the young
[1:44:25] people and the children. We know they
[1:44:27] have a busy day tomorrow and tomorrow
[1:44:29] evening. I pray, Father, in this busy
[1:44:31] time that we will not be caught up, oh
[1:44:34] God, in all of the circus of the world,
[1:44:37] but that we will be caught up with you,
[1:44:39] Father. And let us be in heavenly places
[1:44:42] in Christ Jesus. For this world is
[1:44:45] passing away, and the glory of it, and
[1:44:47] all of the all of the
[1:44:51] all of the tinsel and the flesh and the
[1:44:53] glitter will be gone. But he that does
[1:44:56] the word of God will be forever. We
[1:44:59] thank you, Father, for the group of
[1:45:01] people that are here this evening and
[1:45:02] pray you'll bless us, Lord, as we come
[1:45:04] to a a close. And we I want to worship
[1:45:07] you and thank you now in Jesus name.
[1:45:10] Amen. Let let's sing. Brother Ryan, I am
[1:45:12] redeemed.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed
[1:45:24] with the Christ.
[1:45:27] My Jesus

[1:45:37] ask you
[1:45:40] just who I am,
[1:45:44] tell him
[1:45:46] I am redeemed.
[1:45:51] Oh yes, I am redeemed.
[1:45:56] But with the price,
[1:46:00] Jesus
[1:46:02] has changed my whole life.
[1:46:08] If anybody
[1:46:11] ask you
[1:46:13] just who I am,
[1:46:17] tell them
[1:46:19] I am.

[1:46:26] sing a couple verse of it and it's the
