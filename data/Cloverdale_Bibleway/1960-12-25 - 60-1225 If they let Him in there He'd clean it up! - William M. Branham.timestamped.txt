[0:00] they won't welcome him they welcome
[0:02] their their friends and their
[0:05] politicians and so forth but they won't
[0:07] welcome Christ they'd rather have Santa
[0:09] Claus
[0:10] anytime worlds tuck over Santa Claus is
[0:13] tuck over well you don't a little
[0:16] children don't even know no more What
[0:17] Christmas Means they don't know what
[0:19] Easter means it's a it's a Easter bunny
[0:21] some kind of a rabbit or a little yellow
[0:23] color chicken or
[0:25] something what's God the resurrection
[0:27] got to do with the chicken the dirty
[0:30] bird there is what's any more filthier
[0:33] than a chicken and it they put in there
[0:34] to take the place of
[0:37] Christ what any more of the myth in
[0:39] Santa Claus never was such a thing
[0:43] telling children lies you'll be
[0:45] responsible F at the day of the
[0:49] Judgment I wonder people don't know what
[0:51] to
[0:52] do there they just don't want the real
[0:55] thing they'll take anything artificial
[0:57] but they don't want the real thing they
[0:58] don't want the gifts of God
[1:02] oh
[1:03] my certainly they don't want Jesus
[1:07] that's one thing I got rolled down here
[1:09] one reason they didn't mning is because
[1:12] that when he went into their Temple and
[1:13] he found their filth in the temple he
[1:16] turned over the tables and run the money
[1:18] changers out the Lord he cleaned it
[1:22] up and if they ever let the Holy Ghost
[1:24] get into one of these big churches
[1:26] around here he' clean it up
