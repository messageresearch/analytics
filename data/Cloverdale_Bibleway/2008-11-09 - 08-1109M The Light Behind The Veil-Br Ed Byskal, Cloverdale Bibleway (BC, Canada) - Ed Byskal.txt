The word of God [Applause] is changing me and it's changing you. Glory I come. Oh with heart for let the word of God. Oh, the word of God changing you. We have come with high [Music] desire this morning. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandom was talking about Elisha how he called a minstrel so he could get in the spirit. &gt;&gt; He said so they got to play in the music. Now listen, if you can't be the prophet, you can be one of the instruments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that plays the music to bring the spirit down on the prophet. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? So they began to play so forth. Beat the drums. Brother Chris here. Play the instruments. We have the musicians. They began to beat and play. Started singing there will be a meeting in the air and the sweet sweet by and by. Said the prophet began to get into the spirit and the first thing you know when he got into the spirit things began to happen. &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter. We can't get anywhere today. &gt;&gt; We don't get the spirit of it. That's it. You got to get in the spirit of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They begin to get to clapping their hands really having a good time and the spirit of God begin to fall on the prophet. His spirit got on the prophet. Then he began to see things. &gt;&gt; You'll go to seeing things when you get in the spirit. &gt;&gt; How many want to see something from God this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen.

Well, you know, this is uh as we said last night, just to take just a moment to to tell you how honored we are to get to be here in this service with all of you this morning. Never dreamed that it would ever be possible. We tried many times, but something just happened that we couldn't make it. But it is a tremendous honor to be in your presence this morning. Now, more than all that, it's a tremendous honor to be in the presence of the King of Kings &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords. &gt;&gt; We're glad that the Lord has permitted us to make this trip to be with you. You've got a lovely congregation. You're highly thought of in Johnson City, Tennessee. Brother Donnie Reagan, our congregation sends their warmest regards. Uh you can make it through Happy Valley Boot Camp. You can make it, church. You can make it. I promise you. But we're so honored to have a man of God as our pastor as you are here. You appreciate the men of the Lord that speaks to you in the name of the Lord. Certainly we do. We're going to sing one more song and then we're going to sit down. Looking forward to the preaching of the word of the Lord this morning. But honest from our hearts, it is a tremendous honor, isn't it, Brother Kenneth?

[Music] But truly, it is a a tremendous honor to get to be with you this morning. May the Lord richly bless you as we journey here together in this life. We know that we're reaching and looking for a time where we'll never ever have to say goodbye. Never ever have to worry about leaving, shaking one another's hands for the last time. It won't happen over there. Aren't you excited about getting to go to a place like that? May the Lord bless you. Let's sing this song this morning. I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary. I appreciate the blood still being real in my life to my life this morning. Do you appreciate it? Amen. and he'll call that. [Music] I believe in a hill called Mount Calary. [Music] And I believe whatever the go. And when time has surrendered and earth is no more, I'll still cling to the old ruged. There are things as we travel this earth shifting sands that transcend all the reason of me and the things that really matter. the most in this world. You can't hold them in the palms of your hand. I believe in that Christ who was slain on the cross has the power to change lives today. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; For he changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. me completely and a new life is mine. Oh, and that is why by the cross I will stand. I believe in a hill called Mount Calary. And I believe whatever the call.

Uh we've uh um are very thankful to have our visitors with us. A special welcome to Anna uh and and brother Lineal. I'm sorry I messed up your name. They wrote it down wrong. I can write down I can say what people write, but when they give it to me wrong, I mess it up. But that's kind of special privilege that song leaders get. We we mess up a lot of names. And I'm I got one here I'm going to mess up again. So, Sister Anna Noluvula, I'm sorry if I did that wrong, from Auckland, New Zealand. We're real happy to have you here.

I love my wife, but there's a much better love story, a much greater love story. Amen. Our brothers were singing about Let's sing this together as uh I I understand brother Marcus, sister Anne Zell are going to bring their little one. I think uh sister um or brother Marcus' parents are here as well. I didn't see them, but uh if they're here, we want to welcome you as well from up in Arana. So, I'm casting all my care on you. I'm going redemption by the Christmas story. Oh for restoration, for redemption. That's what seven angels in a cloud testify by Jes. [Music] So I casting all my cars on you.

My first no longer dead rising [Music] for you and me. [Music] Amen. Sounds like an anthem. Sounds The whole congregation sounds like a choir. Why shouldn't it be &gt;&gt; heavenly choir? &gt;&gt; And we're adding a member to the choir. She doesn't know it yet, but now you have. Hi. Three daughters also. Yeah. And a son. That wonderful. That's why we need a school. We might need some extra walls here or expand the balcony or something, but God makes room for everyone. &gt;&gt; We're happy that you're all here, and we're happy for brother Marcus and Sister Anne and bringing their young one here, Sister Anne's mother, is uh has is leaving real soon now back for New Zealand. And the sister Anne's mother is of course the wife of brother Donald Derekson. Donaldson, I'm sorry. Brother Derek Donaldelsson. Brother Derek happens to be one of my favorite ministers. And he just uh I I want to send a message back with your mother, which I did, Sister Anne, that when he preaches, he bring brings the word just from such a direction. And I've always been happy for him. And now this uh young one which our brother Marcus and sister Anne has been blessed with as a daughter may have named her Stephanie Anastasia or Anastasia however you pronounce it. uh Stephanie a crown or a garland and Anna Stasha resurrection and that happens to be very fitting with my message today. Also the scripture which I wish to use and leave with you brother Marcus and sister an is this scripture that is in Deuteronomy. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shall talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou riseest up. That pretty well covers the whole scope of our life. That's 3657. I was just in some foreign countries in the last few weeks and I saw some little children just like yours here and they were from m mixed mixed uh languages. Uh the mother spoke one language and that was her her mother tongue was one language and the father's mother tongue was another language and then they had a a third language and they were telling me because I'd hear that little one and sometimes she's speaking French and the next time she's speaking German and and I thought this is absolutely miraculous and then they'd speak to her in French and she'd answer in German. She was just as free with one language as another. And how they learned that was because they heard it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they hear even the pronunciation and they acquire an accent. Sister Anne has been living in Canada quite a few years, but she still has some of that New Zealand accent. Of course, brother Sirill says that's what they're going to speak in in the millennium. So, so whatever accent they speak over there, that's the accent I want to speak. Don't you? And you know, then we have brother Louis Blevens and the Jans brothers here and they have a little different accent, but we understand uh and as you speak in the home, Brother Marcus, Sister Anne, this child will acquire what she hears and how she hears it. And I pray that God will just give you such divine wisdom that you'll never forget that when she was dedicated. Let her hear it in the evening. Let her hear it in the morning. Let her hear it at the table. And I She'll have a different language. She'll hear as we heard sung this morning. She'll hear Jesus. I know she'll hear that very early. May she acquire that. &gt;&gt; She'll hear rapture. &gt;&gt; She'll hear resurrection. what her name has and I I pray that she will acquire the depth of the meaning of it and we're going to dedicate her to the Lord as God has given her to you and pray that she shall surely be a blessing in your home. Dear heavenly father, we hold this gift that you have given now. And my brother Marcus and sister Anne, Lord, have received her with loving arms and now they are offering her back to you. But we're praying, Father, that every day that you have ordained that she should live on earth. I pray that her life will be a blessing. I ask that it'll be a joy in the home. I pray, Father, that as I have spoken these words of counsel, that her ears will hear early all of the statements and a great message of grace. I pray, Father, that her little soul will just respond so quickly. And I pray, oh God, that you will find here a temple to indwell. She's s in my arms now in her innocence, Lord. And I pray that you shall keep her in just such a state. May she come to know you very early in her life and may she live for you all the days of her life. And on that day, she will form part of this circle and it shall not be broken. We claim that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so, Father, now I dedicate Stephanie Anastasia to you and I pray, oh God, that you will receive her as her parents have received her. You will receive her that much more. We thank you for that. We thank you, Lord. We have the confidence this child shall be a blessing in the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother Marcus. God bless you, sister. Well, they got a quiver full. Ain't that wonderful? We're rejoicing with a wonderful testimony for our little brother David Paris. Uh we're just rejoicing over that. I have another one also. We've been praying for uh for the last two weeks for our brother Jean Jacques in Switzerland. and he's been going this last week he's been all week been going through another series of tests with neurologists uh one after the other with him testing every day every day they tested the healing had increased and already already one woman doctor came to Joel his son and said these words your father is a real miracle &gt;&gt; but they had a new neurologist, a specialist come in to speak with him and to take him through a whole series of tests. And when this neurologist was finished, he said, "There has been some mistake because Jean Jacques can't be this patient." &gt;&gt; But he was. Hallelujah. Is God real? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. We've had such a blessing also with the entire Iberson family that have been here. Brother Nathaniel's brothers and sister. Uh they wanted to speak about uh about the hub and and the things that have been taking place. uh getting the brother Brandham's message in a massive digital library. The hub is up and operating and operating in some countries now and is expanding very very quickly and uh they had of course heard about it. They wanted to speak directly uh with us about it and they spoke with brother Darren also about the technical part. Uh brother David Iverson who is uh ministering now and traveling and ministering. Uh it would have been nice to have heard you, brother David, but it just uh with the wedding and everything taking place, it was difficult. But these brothers became so inspired and he said, "I have on a zip file in his pocket." He had 400 Dutch messages, but they were but they were in a file that they were in a certain format we thought we couldn't get. It changed over without quite a bit of difficulty, but they spoke with brother Darren and he said, "You know, there's always ways to do things in this computer world. And uh so the brothers uh the Iverson brothers, they sat down, all brought in laptops, all went to work, and this last week uh for reformatted and uploaded, which is now on the hub, 348 Dutch messages. So I I said, "Well, where we were last night at the in Abbottzford, that has to be the Dutch center of Canada almost, there's a lot of Dutch-speaking people there and many, many in this valley. So we're so thankful for that." And uh Brother and Sister Iverson, uh you have a wonderful family and we've been we've been delighted to have them all here. And as long as you've been here, they have to leave today. We just say God bless you. God prosper your journey. God prosper your ministries. God prosper your work. Keep you in good health. And greet all the saints when you get back to Belgium and Europe for us. Amen. Amen. I'll have you stand if you would please. Like to I'm going to read some scripture in a moment. Uh you can turn to Genesis the first chapter. And before we read, I'm going to ask you to bow in prayer with me. Dear Father, we believe that you ordained the times and the seasons and you have ordained that we would be at s certain places at certain times. We believe that it has been pre-arranged. I believe and I'm absolutely confident this morning that you have every person who's supposed to be in this building, every person who is streaming, you have created the hunger, the thirst, the desire, and you know what it is that we have need of. I believe also that you have prepared the very food in season for us. We have reveled in your word. We are so delighted. We're so satisfied. We're so contented when we feed on the revelation of the word of God. Let it not be some intellectual thing. Lord, let it not just come to our to our human ears, but may it come to the hearing of the soul. I pray that the Holy Spirit will convey it and carry it, Lord, through that lifeam of the Holy Ghost to our very inner being. And may we be revelated, Lord. May we be inspired. And I pray that it'll remove all darkness in the name of Jesus Christ. We loose every person, oh God, to the will of God, to the purpose of God, and that we might fulfill what you have for us here in this life now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. All right. We will turn now to Genesis, the first chapter. And I'm going to read uh just a very few verses here and then we're we will read out of Matthew 4. Genesis 1:3 and 4. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. I'd like to read down also to verse 14. And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years." So that was that light. and verse 15, "And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth." And it was so. Now, before we read in Matthew, I'd like you just to notice this is in the in the natural creation that God he he didn't just say, "Let there be light," but he said, "Let there be light. Let it be in the firmament and let it be for signs and let it be for seasons. So there's a purpose. There's an order. He placed the light in a certain place to shine in a certain direction and to shine on the earth, a womb for his seeds so that it would do specific things. It had a divi it had a divine purpose in the mind of God and it has been fulfilling that. All right. Now we will read in Matthew the 4th chapter and we're reading now here about another light the sen light and the Bible says in the fourth chapter 13th verse of Matthew and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of Zabulon and Nephilim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The land of Zebulon and the land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw great light. And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up." And from that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Amen. You may be seated. I just want to say just before we start the end of the message, I so so enjoyed the Jon brothers and brother Louie Blevens and Brother Lenol. I said it right this time. uh we've seen you before and heard you sing and last night was just something special your comments before the songs and I said to a brother in the study I felt as though I got to know you last night and wonderful just to get to know one another and be blessed by the ministry we'll be hearing more from them this evening I want to speak to you on the light the light beyond the veil. God created this first light. We read the first scriptures and there was light in the heavens with a divine and specific purpose. There was another light. It was a pillar of fire in a burning bush. There was a light in the tabernacle in the wilderness. There was h a light between the cherubams, a flame of fire and it was over the mercy seat. It was there for a specific purpose and the people were not permitted at that time to go in just the high priest once a year and not without blood. And then as we were to go through through the all the Old Testament through the history of Israel uh at various intervals we find uh the special light then shining on the Gentiles as we read in Matthew and there's other places in the New Testament at the coming of Jesus uh and through the church ages. is intercepting Apostle Paul on the Damascus road was this light, a transforming light and it came for a specific purpose. It came to attract him and to capture him and which he said later he'd been apprehended. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That light apprehended him. He was the first church age messenger and it needed to divide and separate the law from grace and bring in grace and let the darkness of the law why you say the law was darkness because it says as pertaining to the mind it could never clear the conscience from guilt &gt;&gt; but but grace brought in such light &gt;&gt; it can deal with any and every situation. And if you're in one today, this light can abolish the darkness. And then the pillar of fire in this long journey, we find it arriving here at the end time in a very dramatic and unusual way over uh the prophet of God, not knowing he was a prophet at that time, but over the Ohio River and making manifest the purpose is to identify a messenger, to send him with a message, and to uh carry this process further to take it from word to bring back a restored word and to take it from word and to bring it actually into us as individuals so that the light can be in a people a people called the bride of Jesus Christ veiled and now that light if you can accept it is present with us &gt;&gt; veiled in human flesh. &gt;&gt; The light &gt;&gt; behind the veil, that light is a transforming light. &gt;&gt; That light has been placed in a like the sun that's out there. This light has been placed in a a an ordained spot for a specific purpose. And we don't want to lose sight of what that purpose is. I also want to bring in through the message which I touched on last Sunday. I want to bring in uh something that is is very clear in the message and I'm going to have to belabor the point a wee bit because brother Brandham's uh took a message in shalom and he said rise and shine for thy light has come and gross darkness upon the people. I want to bring those I alluded to it but I wish to bring it in a very very clear statements today that brother Brandham says that he repeats a statement which many of us have heard that the darkest hour is just before the dawn but brother Brandham gives a a reason why that is said it's because the light that is pressing the darkness and he says the darkness is actually congealing. He uses the word congealing, an unusual phrase. The darkness is actually congealing because the light is pressing it. And that's what's happening now. So when God places the light, he has a specific source and a specific purpose. And the light has a specific strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. The light that you see will blind another one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone comes out of absolute darkness, they can't. The light will just glaze their eyes over. The light is blinding to them and the next person can see it. One species of animal or bird is very comfortable. They they can move about in the darkness. They feed at night. They see they they're they're at home at night and and they do all right in the daytime. But you and I would stumble around and we go out in the woods and I've been out in the out in the woods in the jungles and everything else, but quite frankly, uh, I'm not comfortable at night around them. I've been in Africa and I've heard of the lions and I've heard the hyenas and heard the various animals and they're out there having a great time at night, but it's not my time. I just don't feel comfortable with it. Might get Brian Jones and he'll take you out there, but I'm still not comfortable. I I I try to trust him but not completely if you know what I mean. There's some birds and and and I understand from reading about them that the owls and various birds their eyes have been made in a certain way so that they're they see very clearly. They're comfortable in the evening. They're comfortable at night. Brother Brandham said that this message this message actually would blind the people. Can you imagine angels coming out of the very presence of God going to retrieve uh Lot out of Sodom and and and it didn't blind Lot but it blinded the others were smitten with blindness &gt;&gt; now in the in the message the rising of the sun I'll need your undivided attention and as little movement as possible so we don't disturb others in the rising of the sun there was a time when the world was laying lying in utter darkness. It was without form and void and was uh a and it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere. And the spirit of God moved upon the water and said, "Let there be light." Said God had a reason for that. For down beneath the water there was seeds. So now it wasn't wasn't just a light but now what was the purpose of that light? There were seeds that had been planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live. Do you know friends, you were seeds that were planted in this generation and if this light of this message had not come, you wouldn't have any light. You'd still be stumbling along in some darkened place. You young people that are here, you you you can't even begin to compare the life you have now with the life you would have lived if this light hadn't come. So it came with a specific purpose and it came with a specific strength. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you see the prophet of God is speaking things say oh that's strong anything less wouldn't have done it. &gt;&gt; It had to have that strength. It had to shine with that. So that is why one sits there and says, "Ah, I can't take that." Blinds them. And the next one says, "Shine on me. &gt;&gt; Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love this sunlight. &gt;&gt; It had to have the sunlight to live. And the first light that was ever given in the earth was God's spoken word. And the light that shines in this day is God's spoken word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Said the first light that ever struck the earth was God's spoken word. And he said, "Let there be light." And there was light and turned and that darkness and turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation, a creation of joy and life upon the earth. So the light pressed the darkness back in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Now according to the scripture, you are a new creation in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the reason for that creation is to bring joy and life upon the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just human existence. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the life in him was life. And that life was the light of man. That's the life I'm speaking about. That life in him. In him. Christ in him. The word made flesh. In him &gt;&gt; that that transmitted that light that was in him by spirit. by spirit, by the Holy Spirit, into this generation, into this congregation, into your home, into your environment. At certain a place, that light was ordained to shine there &gt;&gt; and to touch you, &gt;&gt; to strike that seed and cause it to come to life, &gt;&gt; to bring forth joy. He didn't come to bring forth distress. didn't come to bring forth any darkness and shadows and confusion. That's not why it came. It came to bring light. &gt;&gt; And when you have light, then you have something you can walk in. &gt;&gt; So, there's another uh sun rising of the one I'm just speaking now. I want you to think of it as being a sunrising to bring forth a new creation of joy and life upon the earth. in the message why it had to be uh shepherds and and just so I get your mind in the in the same channel with me I am going chronologically somewhat through the scripture in the message why it had to be shepherds now we're at the at a a message a Christmas message that brother Brandon preached in 1964 he said he had started a new creation what was it a creation of himself. God was made flesh and dwelt among us in the beginning. In the beginning of the creation of God, it was created. God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son. I wish every trinitarian could read this paragraph and have the spirit of God make it clear to them. Just listen this profound statement. In the beginning of the creation of God, God was created in human form in Jesus Christ his son. God dwelt. He built his tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived in that tabernacle. God Emmanuel, God with us. He built himself a house to live in it so he could reflect his word to his subjects through that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous? &gt;&gt; You know what God is when you see Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a piece of literature, friends. That's beyond literature to me. &gt;&gt; Just marvelous. God built himself a house to live in so he could reflect through that to you and to me the light. &gt;&gt; Now that light did not come without an announcement. And the announcement he said the morning star announces the coming of the sun. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And of course I said last Sunday so you would know the morning star. He's the brighten morning star. Of course he is. He's a light, but it's his light shining through another vessel. &gt;&gt; And here came, I will call it the Elijah light or another light called John the Baptist light. And just before the coming of the sun in the message former and latter rain, he said, "As soon as it gets real dark," I want you to hold that. Just before the break of day, the morning star shines its brightest. What's it doing? It's reflecting the light of the coming sun. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The reason he's saying, "Do you get it?" because it was happening at that moment. &gt;&gt; He was wanting them to be able to see that it was repeating again because there had to be another announcement for this coming. &gt;&gt; And then in watchmen uh what of the night and I have just put a heading here powerful words from God to us in this day. &gt;&gt; And this is what I find as powerful words. The sun is approaching. Then the darkest hour of the night is just before the dawn. And science claims it's the night. The sun the sun approaching, pressing, coming on, pressing. Here's a prophet messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's an Elijah light making a a making a most accurate announcement. Not only saying who's coming, but what's happening as a result of the coming. And he's saying it's coming. the sun approaching, pressing, coming on and pressing, congealing the night together &gt;&gt; because it knows it's just got a little while and day will break. The darkness is congealing and the darkness knows it only has a little season and it's going to and the dawn is going to dispense with it. &gt;&gt; Congaling it together. Doesn't the scripture say that where sin abounds, &gt;&gt; grace does that that much more abound? &gt;&gt; Why is sin abounding? If you see sin abounding, now I'm going to give you an indication where I'm going. If you see sin abounding, the abundance of sin, the increase in sin, the increase in iniquity is actually testifying that light is on its way. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we don't dwell in the gloom. &gt;&gt; We don't dwell in all the sin and the iniquity, but we say, "Praise God, the light's coming." &gt;&gt; And he's setting this principle here very vividly. That's why I say it's so powerful to me. congealing the night together because it knows it's just got a little while and day will break. And just before day break, what comes out? The morning star. As far as I'm concerned, he was standing there with the light of the morning star. But the morning star, no star has lights of its own. It only reflects something else. And the sen was drawing near coming to a dawning and it had to shine through that star messenger &gt;&gt; to let us know. &gt;&gt; Good morning. &gt;&gt; Shalom, bride. &gt;&gt; It's a new day. &gt;&gt; And now you'll understand the shalom message even more. &gt;&gt; I would urge you to read it again. &gt;&gt; And just before the day break, what comes out? The morning star. And what does the star mean? He stands alone. He's God's watchman. He stands in the tower alone. &gt;&gt; The rest of the stars have faded out. &gt;&gt; The rest of the messengers have faded out. &gt;&gt; The moon's gone. That's why I said and just before the daybreak or the day he said and the sun begins to shine against the morning star and it reflects the true light &gt;&gt; of the true sun that's just about ready to shine. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; And therefore, Apostle Paul has said, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." And the word is he's a new creation. &gt;&gt; You are not part of this old creation. &gt;&gt; You have not been merely patched up. &gt;&gt; You've not been merely forgiven. You're a new creation in Christ Jesus. That's what the word of God teaches. And anything less than that is not the scripture. You're a new creation. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God is very, very clear. Not the old creation made over &gt;&gt; but a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a new creature and old things are passed away and behold all things are become new. We are a new creation. In the paradox, he said when a man is changed from the person that he is to a new creature in Christ Jesus, he becomes a new creation. &gt;&gt; He's no more what he used to be. He's absolutely a new creation. &gt;&gt; Absolutely a new creation. &gt;&gt; I'd like to be able to have you say, "I'm a new creation." &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. &gt;&gt; You believe it? Yeah, &gt;&gt; we should say it again. Now I'm a new creation. &gt;&gt; If you're having any trouble with that, Brother Brandham also has a recipe for you. Say, "How long shall I say it?" He said, "Until you believe it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Until you believe it. &gt;&gt; Say it to the devil. Say it to your wife. Say it to your husband. Say it to anybody you need to. I'm a new creation. Whatever comes your way that cannot change that. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation in Christ Jesus. I'm not part of the old creation. I'm part of this new creation. I'm not of this world. You're not of this world. &gt;&gt; Now, in the Leo in church age, he said he's standing because he was standing in the midst of the churches. He said he stands there revealing who he is in the last age. That's what he's doing. &gt;&gt; This messenger is correct to the eenth degree. Christ is standing in the midst of his people revealing who he is in this last day. Otherwise, there could be no marriage between a bridegroom and the bride. We wouldn't know who he is. But this message has come to actually reveal who he is. &gt;&gt; So there's no mistake. We're not looking through a gloom or a glass darkly. We see him. We see him. If you haven't got a clear vision, say, "Oh God, trim my lamp. Clear the glass. Whatever you need to do." &gt;&gt; He said he stands there revealing who he is in this last age. And he calls himself the author of the creation of God. This is another creation. This has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. &gt;&gt; What powerful words. uh uh I I don't know you know how you are uh uh at what capacity at what level you're able to receive it but I would encourage every person regardless of your age and regardless of your spiritual stature or maturity I I would believe every person should just be able to say I receive that I acknowledge that I accept that I receive it into my being. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that you can become a participant with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Deny the enemy. &gt;&gt; Deny him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We'll go out of here being different people. &gt;&gt; The new creation. This creation is not an old creation made over. &gt;&gt; Or it could not be called a new creation. This is exactly what it is. a new creation. It's another creation distinct from the old one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he's the first of that creation. He was God created in the form of man. Now by his spirit, he's creating many sons. &gt;&gt; Now by his spirit, he's creating many sons. You are a new creation by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We ought to deny anything that feels less than that. Don't trust our feelings. Don't trust your reasoning. Don't trust anything. Cast it all aside and just say, "I'm here just to hear the word of God. I'm here what's coming across this pullpit." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends, this isn't something I dreamed up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something that has come real in my heart. &gt;&gt; And I believe that this is God's word to us this morning. I received it as God's word. And I could not deliver it to you if I didn't receive it as God's word. God the creator creating himself a part of his creation. &gt;&gt; I wanted to have these things up on the slide for you, but I didn't have sufficient time. Listen close. I'm repeating it. He is the first of that creation. That's him. He was God created in the form of a man. That's Christ. Now by his spirit he is creating many sons unto himself. God the creator creating himself a part of his own creation. &gt;&gt; Now I move forward to the light of the resurrection. I want to just index it slightly to take it to the pressing of the darkness and and and spend just a moment or two on that. He said, "And when the life that's in Jesus Christ comes to the tomb where your loved ones are sleeping, when the life that's in Jesus Christ comes to the tomb where your loved ones are sleeping." I want to ask, how many here have some loved ones that are sleeping? Amen. &gt;&gt; What a host. &gt;&gt; What a host. I'm moved because here's a light, an announcing light, announcing to you that the life of Jesus Christ is going to come to the tomb or the grave where your loved ones are sleeping. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there'll be another congaling. They'll bring together the atoms. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Transform the atoms. &gt;&gt; A sweep &gt;&gt; will come over the living ones. &gt;&gt; And he'll congeal and take away the darkness. &gt;&gt; Every trace of this world. Everything of this mortal life will be gone. &gt;&gt; This mortal life, who wants it? I can do without it. Give me eternal life. &gt;&gt; Let immortality swallow up this mortality. &gt;&gt; And when it comes to your sleeping, loved ones are sleeping, there will be a resurrection. Listen very closely. Life and death can't dwell together. In other words, light and darkness can't dwell together. He's just come from the life of Christ coming to the sleeping loved ones. Life and darkness cannot live to life and death cannot live together no more than darkness and daylight can. Just as soon as the daylight comes, &gt;&gt; just as soon as the daylight comes, it presses the darkness away. &gt;&gt; Daylight has to shine. No matter what takes place and when the world moves around there in front of that sun, it's got to come daylight. It has to. And just as sure as eternity as it pulls around to the time of the coming of the son of God, &gt;&gt; there will be a resurrection over this world. &gt;&gt; And all that sleep in God, Christ will bring with him. In his resurrection, it'll have to be. There's no way out of it. You've got to have it. And how can you have it unless it's in here? &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just refer to gross darkness for a few moments. Dense, congealing is that it becomes more dense, more solidified. And what we see today when I look at the world of religion and I see the announcements or the religious page, not to be critical, but all I see is darkness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I see entertainment and it spells darkness to me. see all of these gim gimmicks &gt;&gt; and money pulling &gt;&gt; and it all spells darkness to me. I see all this what is the world gets so excited about all this unifying and this ecu ecumenical movements and the coming together and multitudes and multitudes untold millions just rejoicing and there they think that this is the personification of of God's will that they might be one that's not what God said Jesus said that they might be one as I am one with the father &gt;&gt; that's the oneness When I see it, it's darkness. I don't think it's difficult for us. It's not us here in America, but it's around the world. The world has come into a very, very dark time financially. They call this a global crisis. A lot of people are very very depressed and I hear that it's going to take a lot longer than most people anticipate. I've even read where they said it'll be it'll be some time even before the effects of it has reached you and I. And the wise and their counselors and the kings and the monarchs and the presidents and all with their advisors have not got a clear direction. &gt;&gt; Well, perhaps try this or try that. What it is, friends, it's darkness. And when you start thinking about the economics, that comes right down to your home and the gas and the fuel and your automobile and the food on your table and the rent that you need to pay or the mortgage payment you need to pay. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; But there's a light &gt;&gt; that is stronger than that darkness. &gt;&gt; When I look at the education, I shake my head. I tremble within my being. I am sometimes ashamed to say I'm a Canadian or an American with this godlessness. When I see the samesex marriage &gt;&gt; happening within miles of this church, I'm disgraced. &gt;&gt; Not as a citizen of this nation, but even of the human race. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I see the nakedness and I see the complete without shame, the open dis desegration and disregard for anything that's right, holy, and it has come to where the clean is considered unclean, where the clean is worthy of mockery, &gt;&gt; a smirk on the face, because a person walks by with the glory of God and with some modesty, then in the world is in a very very dark place. I say gross darkness. &gt;&gt; You young people, you're growing up in a in a state of gross darkness. But I have an announcement I have not made quite like this before. This gross darkness. And you all see it. You all are touched by it. You all uh uh you have it surrounding us every day. This gross darkness testifies of something. This gross darkness is speaking something. It is evidence that the sun has caused it to congeal. &gt;&gt; The sun, the sun has caused it to to become so intense. It's because it's being pushed back. &gt;&gt; Pushed back. &gt;&gt; I don't think there's a person here that would be foolish enough to stand up and say there's not gross darkness on the people. This world is in a dismal place. I look to see they say uh at the last count there are 27 wars being fought as you and I sit here &gt;&gt; on the earth. 27 wars. These are not conflicts. These are wars. &gt;&gt; You can only thank God that you're not in the eastern Congo and being one of maybe one and a quarter million people fleeing with a few few possessions on their back. I mentioned last Sunday. It's going on today. &gt;&gt; And whether it happens or not, the rebel leader says that he intends to move to Kinshasa. And there's believers all over that count country. I'm so thankful to God. God spared them. Last time they actually fasted and prayed and there wasn't a bullet shot in the city of Kinshasa. God spared them. However, one of the pastors lost his wife because he was of one tribe. She was of another and the invading tribe was of his same tribe and they killed his wife. A believer of this message, a minister of this message in the same area where all the trouble is happening now. There's conflicts. There's violence. It it is as it was in the days of Noah. Only in the days of Noah, we have it today in a multiplied form because we have such a a increase in population and our populations have gathered into cities, great urban centers where sin is everywhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; talk to some of our peace officers, our policemen, and they're encountering it every day. Every day, every day. I'm amazed that they wouldn't just become callous and hardened to it. Stabbings and shootings and every day. So, you major on that. No, we're not majoring on that, but we're looking at it today because it's evidence that the sun has arrived. &gt;&gt; And it has to be that way. In fact, as I'm going to read a quote to you where he says that that this adulterous generation that looks for a sign that is evidence of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking at some revival and saying, "Oh, the revival's the evidence of the resurrection." The prophet of God more than once was looking at the terrible gross darkness of the world. And when he saw that adulterous generation, he said, "That's a sign of the resurrection. gross darkness in God's provided way of dealing with sin. Said always before the daylight it's the darkest. It's always darkest just before the break of day. I know I'm repeating myself. I'm I'm repeating him. And I'm saying it because he says it in different ways. He said it's because the light is pressing and condensing the darkness. See friends, the world has nowhere to turn. &gt;&gt; It's condensing the darkness. And that is at the time that the morning star comes out in the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation. Notice the notice the title of the message that he was he was instructed and guided to call it the beginning and ending &gt;&gt; of the gentile dispensation. We see the darkness gathering. Now what what is it? It's light pressing against the darkness. So now back at this time as an early message 55 a prophet is seeing and and in that in in that time I might tell you the world was experienced great revival that David Edwin Harold writes about from about 48 to 58. Here he is in the middle of it. But he sees the prophet sees darkness coming &gt;&gt; and he tells Oh my. I hope you have ears to hear today. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I just want to know you do. &gt;&gt; The prophet sees darkness back then. He said we see the darkness gathering now. Notice how it's worded. It's gathering now. Doesn't just see darkness, but he sees darkness gathering now. And then the explanation interpretation. What is it? It's light. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was there for. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Pressing against the darkness. &gt;&gt; And one has to give way. &gt;&gt; That's the era he was in. That's the chronological order. &gt;&gt; In the midst of great revival, healing revivals. Or Roberts was going on. Billy Graham was going on. Aa Robert, aa Allen was going on. Oel Jaggers, WV Grant, all of these ministries were going on. Uh Osburn and and and uh uh a whole myriad of great ministers in the field reaping an enormous harvest. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of it, the prophet says, "Darkness is gathering." &gt;&gt; And this is why it's gathering because it's got to press. The light is pressing the darkness. And one of them has to give way. And he knew that God's light would not fail. &gt;&gt; God's light is never going to give way to darkness. &gt;&gt; And apply that to your own life. Whatever you enter, whatever you encounter, God's light is not going to give way to that darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I feel this weakness. I feel this bondage. I feel this. I don't care what you feel. God's light of the new creation will never give way to that darkness. You need to speak against that darkness. &gt;&gt; I come against you darkness in the name of Jesus Christ, the light of the world, the light of my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't psy it. &gt;&gt; Don't play light with it. He says, "We see the darkness gathering now. It's the light pressing against the darkness. One has to give away." He says, "All the creeping things that's been running through the night when that sun comes to they run to take shelter when the light shines." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in I know my redeemer liveth. And this great darkness that's swinging over the earth now, it's about three years later. This great darkness that's swinging over the earth now is nothing but to declare that the light is pressing its way down. &gt;&gt; Do you catch the different language, friends? &gt;&gt; Do you catch how precise this is? &gt;&gt; I hope you're spiritually minded. I said, "We're going to go through it chronologically." &gt;&gt; He said, "It is the light is the darkness is coming now." Three years later, he said it's swinging over the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he tells us precisely what is happening at the time. &gt;&gt; And it's nothing but to declare. And so the darkness that was swinging over the earth and the prophet could see it, the darkness swinging over the earth. And he looked at the darkness and he said, "This is declaring. This is making a declaration. &gt;&gt; The light is coming. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just hold it fast, friends. where we move on a little bit further and then if you read shalom again you'll see it different said the hour is upon us 1964 now it's not coming but he said the hour is upon us darkness and gross darkness repeats it gross darkness on the people Now you know we here in this life, we here in this country and those of you from Europe, we have a pretty good life. We got lots of food, nice cars, comfortable place to sit and have church. freedom sir. &gt;&gt; But don't let the devil fool you with an artificial light. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that we in North America are living by an artificial light. &gt;&gt; Some of its knowledge and intellect. We have great people and we have leaders and God bless our leaders and help them. But whatever makes your life rather easy, comfortable, don't forget that's an artificial light &gt;&gt; and it's going to pass away because it's gross darkness. And if you take a real good hard look, I'll say to you young people, it may be in education, you may be in college, you may be in school, in halls of learning, take a real good hard look at what it is you're studying and see if it is clean, holy, and something that Jesus could read &gt;&gt; and be blessed by And if you look at it very critically say, you know, there's a facade here. There's a facade, but deep down below it, there's innuendos &gt;&gt; and there's statements and there's little cunning things that are encouraging &gt;&gt; sin, &gt;&gt; encouraging me to do wrong or telling me that wrong is okay. &gt;&gt; Have a look at the world of business or the world of economics. You don't have to look at it very long before you when you get down say you know what this is corrupt &gt;&gt; the it's fundamentally flawed &gt;&gt; politics right &gt;&gt; I just listened I listened live to the man who is president-elect uh Obama's advisor He was his closest adviser in this election. I understand he was his head advisor. And they said, "Well, now he's now he's sweeping." This was just before he'd be become elected and he's sweeping to this great victory. What are you going to do now? Because it's obvious he won't be able to keep all the promises that have just been made. That advisor said that's our that's that's our first task in this period starting right immediately if he wins the election starting immediately. He said we have set a course to soften the people because we can't and these are his words we cannot keep the promises we made. &gt;&gt; Right? I was at brother Ron Spencer's getting ready to come up and preach and brother Ron got up and said, "Just think," he said. They're lined up for hours waiting to get into a building to hear a man tell a bunch of lies. &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; You don't have to look at any area of life very long before you'll find. And so the prophet also spoke several times about a false light. There are false lights. There is a glare. There's a reflected light. And there's a true reflected light through a prophet is a reflector. You're a reflector. But he spoke several times and spoke of the greatest train the greatest robbery that was ever taken which happened in in England. And it was a millions of dollars. I think maybe $7 million. the great train robbery and it was caused because of a false light. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; They put up a light and the train stopped &gt;&gt; as I understand it and there was the greatest robbery. But there's a greater robbery. &gt;&gt; And I hope you're not losing some of your spiritual assets. &gt;&gt; The devil is going about like a roaring lion. And he doesn't necessarily go about roaring boo in your ear. He's saying it's okay. Right. &gt;&gt; It's fine. He's got a soft, cunning voice. &gt;&gt; You're all right. Don't get too excited about this. You don't have to get too fervent. You know, the preacher gets it, but you don't have to get it. He's a liar. &gt;&gt; He's a liar. &gt;&gt; This word, this message, this light needs to mean more to you than your job, than your education, than your business, than your money, or anything else. He's a liar. &gt;&gt; You need to tell him he's a liar. I don't care how kind how he comes to you, how soft, how cunning, &gt;&gt; how nice it sounds, it's an artificial light. &gt;&gt; It's artificial. And that light's going to go out. &gt;&gt; And outside of that light is nothing but gross darkness. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. Never been such a dark time. We've lived now since 64, 44 years. Here we are at this time. You know, I don't know. Sometimes things come up that may mean something and other times they may not mean a whole lot. I'm just going to jump ahead in in my message for a moment because I looked and this was really the heart of my message this morning. What we are seeing or at least what I am seeing is a intense congaling of darkness. &gt;&gt; And if I didn't have this fundamental principle that the prophet of God left us telling us that that is a sign. &gt;&gt; It's a dismal sign to maybe even people in the message if they don't see the other side of it. this intense gross darkness that can almost be felt like it was in Egypt. There's no light. There's no way out politically, economically, religiously, any other way. It's all headed to an abysmal dismal pit. &gt;&gt; Right? And that's not pessimism because on the other side I look at that and you can look at that through the eyes of the messenger and say aha but I this has happened because light is right behind it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said furthermore when you see this gross adulterous generation seeking signs. He said that speaks of one thing. He said that is a sign of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. You see great dark gross darkness and I know you do. We can say praise be to God. We have another promise. &gt;&gt; The promise of the resurrection, the congaling of darkness. I mentioned 27 wars at the present time. And this is from the abortion the center uh institute and planned parenthood's family planning perspectives and this is their abortion statistics worldwide number of abortions per year is approximately 40 42 million numbers of abortions per day 115,000. In the United States, the number of abortions per year was 1.37 million in 1996. Those are statistics. That's not estimate. That's what took place. That would be 1.37 million is half the population of this entire greater Vancouver area was wiped out in abortions. I was just looking because I was curious to see what he said on this situation and brother Brandham referred to Chicago. I think every time he spoke about abortions, I looked to see if he ever connected it with Los Angeles. No, he connected the homosexual and the perversion with Los Angeles in the West and Vancouver happens to be an abundance of it here. &gt;&gt; But he spoke of it as being he connected it with Chicago. I just wonder if that prophet was connecting some spirit that would arise. Don't take me wrong, no reflection on the person, but America has a president coming into power who's very very pro-abortion &gt;&gt; and also comes from Chicago. &gt;&gt; And I think it's more than a coincidence. I think there's gross. It's a sign of gross darkness. I think we're headed. Do you I want to ask this congregation on any one of these points. Anything that you can think of? Anything that perhaps has troubled you? I just want to ask you, do you see even the remotest indication that it will reverse? And that's sad. &gt;&gt; Is it going to improve? &gt;&gt; Are we going to have less divorces? Are we going to have less violence, less wars? I say to you, arise and shine because your light has come. And that darkness that you see and you touch and you're grieved with day after day after day is evidence, it's a sign from God's prophet to you &gt;&gt; that the light is pushing it &gt;&gt; and it can't do anything but congeal and become more intense and more fierce and more dark because the resurrection is coming right behind it. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say by the evidence of the darkness, resurrection is on its way. &gt;&gt; Rapture is on its way. &gt;&gt; That is why death &gt;&gt; has become so prevalent &gt;&gt; in every form &gt;&gt; because the enemy is bringing it. That is what he's bringing. But it's it's that way and it's intensifying congaling because the light of the rapture, the change of these bodies because the scripture also tells us he goes about as a roaring line because he knows his time is short. &gt;&gt; He knows what time it is. Do you remember when Jesus cast a thousand demons out of the maniac and they went into the we're going to go into the swine and they screamed out and they said, "Have you come to torment us before the time?" &gt;&gt; They knew it was coming, but they knew that wasn't the time. Have you come to torment us before the time? But they know well it's a time and it's like there's a fever in the kingdom of darkness. They're gripped with a fever. They're panicstricken. We haven't much time to accomplish our devious and evil ends. Let us get into government. Let us get behind the pulpit. Let us get into the churches. Let us get into worship. Let us get into the most the most deceiving place because we must if we can deceive the very elect. And the very elect happen to have a promise from God saying that's not possible. That can't happen. Might take the neighbor down the street but can't take the elect of God. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's not just that you have light. It is that you are light. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. the announcement and we see we can see all through the all through the scriptures and I won't take the time but even when we come into the I was thinking of the Exodus and the Old Testament and God gave Moses a promise and said and the Lord went before them in a by day in a pillar of fire. What a comfort that must have been &gt;&gt; to walk and have that pillar of fire before them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a comfort it must have been and a confidence for that prophet of God to see that pillar of fire leading them. And he said, "A pillar of fire by by night in a pillar of fire and to give them light to go by day and night." I believe is in birth pains that brother Brandham speaks of the birth of Jesus Christ and how the world had come into a very very dark time. I'd say the nations, like the songwriter said, have lost their way. And God chose his prophets and his messengers to lead them out of that time. But then he sent, and I've referred to John the Baptist, but now I want to give some backup in some scriptures. Zachcharias, John the Baptist's father at John's birth. It was actually at his circumcision. And he speaks of him and he says to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace. That's what they would say about the spirit of Elijah at that time. To give us light, to to to make something visible, to make it clear. And then I want you to notice please so we can uh project all these things to this moment and your address. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Zachcharias the father, he's not saying that he has it, but he's saying to give us light. You've sent this one to give us light and to show us the way and to give us direction. God's in the same business he was when he said to the son, "Let there be light." And he created lights in the heavens and he had them in their place. The moon's where it's supposed to be. The sun's where it's supposed to be. The stars are where it's supposed to be. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And the light that was coming now, as Zacharias was speaking about, that light was exactly where it was supposed to be. &gt;&gt; It was with that infant child. That light was with that infant child. And it and God God gave it from the right source &gt;&gt; with the right strength with the right intensity. It was going to reach everyone it was ordained to reach. He said, "You rejoiced in John. You rejoiced in in in his light for he was a great and shining light &gt;&gt; and you rejoiced in it for a season." He said to the people then John, when he saw Jesus coming, this is just before Jesus was going to enter his ministry said, "Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." Made announcement. There never been an announcement like that. He hadn't even read that in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God. &gt;&gt; And it was just at that time because Jesus came and sought baptism of John and they went down into the water together. And John baptized him. And when he came up out of the water, a light came, a heavenly light, a dove light. &gt;&gt; That same light was over the Ohio River. What's the difference between Jordan, Ohio, or any other river? It was that same dove, that same heavenly light coming from a certain supernatural source &gt;&gt; with the right intensity &gt;&gt; to the right people &gt;&gt; to the right man &gt;&gt; and to the others who would be associated and see it and believe it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That light never misses a never misses a beat. &gt;&gt; When it came in this generation, it came to the right person. &gt;&gt; It came with the right strength, &gt;&gt; the right intensity, and the correct direction to catch the seed that's in you. &gt;&gt; It had to catch that seed that was in you. &gt;&gt; It was strong enough to reach even to you. &gt;&gt; Are you here? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did you come under that light? &gt;&gt; You have much to rejoice in. &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, thus sayith the Lord, outside of that light is only gross darkness. &gt;&gt; He didn't learn behold the lamb of God in a Bible school or theology. Right. &gt;&gt; And when he came up out of the water, God was testifying. And I'm so thankful for the words. Are you getting weary? &gt;&gt; So thankful for the words that the prophet of God gave in the future home. When Jesus came up out of the water and the heavenly light appeared and a voice from heaven saying, "This is my son in whom I'm well pleased." The prophet puts it in in these words. God was saying, "This is my part of the earth." that I have redeemed. &gt;&gt; Because God had created himself a physical body of which Mary in whose womb he was while she ate food and nurtured was nurtured of the earth. His body grew from the things that she craved and desired wheat or cabbage or bread or potatoes or whatever it was. And he had a body of the earth. He aged. Remember &gt;&gt; he aged. When he was 30, he looked 50. He aged. &gt;&gt; Small man, shoulder stooping, &gt;&gt; drooping, wearied with the burdens of life &gt;&gt; and the cares of the people. He was so burdened, &gt;&gt; that beautiful lamb of God. &gt;&gt; And God was speaking, "This is my part of the earth. I'm so glad for the last part of the phrase." Brother Brandham didn't leave it there. And through this part, &gt;&gt; I will redeem all the rest of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And through that part, that's why you're sitting here. &gt;&gt; That's how come you came. &gt;&gt; That light shone even to you. &gt;&gt; I think about some of you young people. if you hadn't had the touch, if that light hasn't struck your soul. When brother Brisco's preaching this morning, say, "Oh God, I have not I've not really experienced what he's preaching about. But I give myself to you. Open it up to me. Make it a reality. Surely my time's come." [Applause] &gt;&gt; You can have it at 8 years old. You can have it at nine. You can have it at 10. You can have it at 80. You can have it. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching a reality. I'm preaching a supernatural thing. I'm looking for this event to happen even here now. &gt;&gt; Just a word to you that feel all full, satisfied, and secure and you're so far in the kingdom of God that you don't have any worries. I want to tell you if you're in that state, you haven't got the mind of your father. &gt;&gt; The mind of the heavenly father was not one that said, "Well, everything's fine. I got my fields and I'm okay. I I'm just fine. I just want more increase and more more productivity. I just want more. I got my eldest son." No. No. He had all of those things, but he was worried over one. &gt;&gt; That was a son who wasn't there. And if you have the spirit of God in you, that's exactly where your concern is. &gt;&gt; And when I'm preaching, I'm reaching out to that one. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you, and the sisters probably live streaming at this moment, but I was touched. a long ways from here. A sister who's experienced a good deal of difficulty was she thought I'll just stream Cloverdale and see what's happening, see what's being spoken there. Turned on the streaming. I was preaching I think three weeks ago now. bind up the wounded. &gt;&gt; That was her to the letter. &gt;&gt; And she bought a plane ticket and flew a 7,000mi round trip to be here in last Sunday's service. And weeping in the office said, "I don't want to go home." Why, friends? You're sitting here, let me tell you, this is a healing atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And you have a commission from Almighty God to keep it that way. &gt;&gt; You have a mandate. It's not just my job. It's your job. It's your job. It's the trustees job. It's the deacon's job. It's our job to keep that atmosphere because that's where our father is concerned. His concern is for that one that's out there that's on the mountain side or may be wounded, but it's his elect. Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's his elect, he must bring them in. &gt;&gt; That's why I rejoice when I hear that these brothers uploaded 348 Dutch messages. I don't just see it as a bunch of mechanics on a message hub. I see a hungering stall out there. &gt;&gt; It's going to find that God's going to lead them right to it and they're going to hear exactly what they need to hear. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. in the former latter rain. I hope you don't mind me taking quite a few quotes because it is in a continuity. &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't miss this." Now I'm reiterating some things I said earlier, but I want to do it from quote. Don't miss this now. The morning star comes out between that little light spell and the real breaking of the day as soon as it gets real dark. Just before the break of day, the morning star shines its brightest. What's it doing? It's reflecting the light of the coming son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that we could sing, he's here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he's here because I can feel his presence. He's here because I have seen the glory of God." I can say today uh uh in in in in alignment with the message today, I know that he's here because I see wickedness. I know he's here because I see an evil and an adulterous generation. I say he's here. I know he's here because the world is beyond repair. &gt;&gt; I say he's here because there isn't a there isn't enough Abraham Lincoln or George Washington's to save the nation. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with that? We haven't got a prime minister could possibly arise and and and save this generation. And they go there with good intent. Nothing against the men. &gt;&gt; They may have the best of intentions. The world is Satan's Eden. That's right. &gt;&gt; And just as Satan crept into God's Eden &gt;&gt; and brought and introduced the first rays of darkness, I can't call it rays of darkness, but the shadows of darkness, God, he didn't creep in. He come thundering down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Out of the heavenlies with a cloud, a sign in the heavens, and a rainbow over his head. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with a little book open in his hand &gt;&gt; and the names of the people, the individuals, your name, your life &gt;&gt; written in here. The kind of life you were not living, but the kind of life he ordained you to live. &gt;&gt; I will speak my word. &gt;&gt; They will hear that word. &gt;&gt; My spirit will come to that word and life will commence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. eternal life will commence. This is my elect. This is my body. This is my bride. And I will marry her. &gt;&gt; And we are one. &gt;&gt; Couple more minutes and I'm going to be done. Yes. the congaling of the darkness. As brother Brandham is coming to the end of shalom at the very end of the book, he just kind of summarizes again like he did at the beginning. It says John was the light. He was more light than Elijah and them had Elijah. He wasn't Elijah's light, but he was Elijah in another form. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of vindicating the light he was. And he says, "And when Jesus come," he said he was a bright and shining light for a season. You love to walk in his light. He said, "And then John said, now I must dim out. Now I must dim out. I must go out now. My light's finished shining. I must go out. He must increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the light. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm the light of the world." &gt;&gt; That's right. In the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he's still the light of the world. And what he is in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. Why was he the light of the world? If he'd come, he said he was the Messiah. and he didn't do like the Bible said then the Messiah wouldn't then the Messiah would do that Messiah would do. He wasn't the light if he didn't do what the Messiah was supposed to do. It's the vindicated word that makes it light. &gt;&gt; And in this hour &gt;&gt; that we're living in &gt;&gt; is where I want to come to. And in this hour that we're living in the aindicated word for this hour &gt;&gt; Pentecostals he said you say speaking in tongues and so forth. That was the day of Pentecost. That was the light of the hour. Then he said, "See, this is another day." &gt;&gt; And he's the light of the hour today, &gt;&gt; the seventh church age, all smothered out with Christ on the outside. &gt;&gt; You see, even the church, read it in Revelation. Where's Jesus? And the world have made a very, very sad picture with Christ standing on the outside. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Knocking to get in. The light on the outside. &gt;&gt; Whatever they had inside was an artificial light. Whatever they had inside, &gt;&gt; I hope you can I hope you can understand me. There's people sitting in churches &gt;&gt; scattered throughout this entire continent &gt;&gt; of United States and Canada and throughout the world sitting in churches living in an artificial light. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God even interpreted for them many of them living in a glare &gt;&gt; of another age. &gt;&gt; And so they're living in a glare say I see a light but it's a glare. Amen. &gt;&gt; And another example he gave, they say a mirage, &gt;&gt; something that looms up &gt;&gt; because of the extreme heat, &gt;&gt; extreme famine, &gt;&gt; people clawing their way across the desert. And the scripture tells us that this day would be a time of famine. &gt;&gt; People are dying. They're clawing and men and women. It says they will go to and fro throughout the whole earth trying to find the word &gt;&gt; and it says and shall not find it. &gt;&gt; That's part of the famine. &gt;&gt; And so they see a mirage, a Hollywood mirage. &gt;&gt; Or some other kind of mirage. Oh, they say a mirage of wonderful things and a great future. And if I can just earn enough, I can make enough, if I can have enough money, it's a mirage. &gt;&gt; It'll disappear as fast as it showed out. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. &gt;&gt; And some of you that may be doubting, you wait till you get my age and you know it's the truth. If there is such a thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't see it happening &gt;&gt; because the light has pressed the darkness. &gt;&gt; And if you don't see the darkness, friends, if you can't, it's not even see it. It's a matter of actually feeling it and sensing it. &gt;&gt; And now, brother Brandham comes to this. The dawning of a new day. I'm not just reading a quote. I'm reading what's a reality &gt;&gt; in my own soul. &gt;&gt; The dawning of a new day. I feel it all over me now. He said it. I'm saying it. &gt;&gt; I'm not merely reading. I'm saying it. I feel the dawning of a new day &gt;&gt; all over me now. &gt;&gt; The light of a new day. &gt;&gt; There's another day, friends. I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ, don't go out these doors and live the same old rat race you've lived before. &gt;&gt; It's not worth it. &gt;&gt; We're just contributing to the darkness of this world. Sell out for God. &gt;&gt; Sell out for this word. &gt;&gt; He said, I can feel the rays of this light breaking through upon my soul. The new day, the old one is pressing away. And as I feel the mortal blood pouring through my body, and I do, he said, I feel the surge of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; come in behind &gt;&gt; and behind it rise and shine. &gt;&gt; My ears, your ears must be tuned. I hear I hear another sound. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hear the sound &gt;&gt; of the heavenly sound. &gt;&gt; I'm listening to &gt;&gt; another sound. &gt;&gt; You, brother Louie, do you sing that song? I'm listening. Why don't you brothers come up and help us sing that? What is it? I'm I keep listening for another sound. The sound. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother Rod has it. Okay, I'll help us. Brother Rod, would you I think we should have remember the last time I said, "Do you brothers know this song?" He said, "No." And I said, "All right, we'll sing it. I am redeemed. I am redeemed." And soon as we started, Brother Lou, you were standing way at the back. He says, "Why am I not up there?" I know you want to be up here. Hallelujah. [Music] I hope you folks, I won't call you folks, but brothers and sisters in Christ will appreciate. It's hard to convey everything that's on a person's heart, but I pray the Holy Ghost will just take it and make it a reality to you. The theme of this service today was God who created light. He knew exactly its source, precisely its strength, and exactly where it was going to shine. And he gave it for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You holding that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then he created different lights, but the one I said I was speaking of was the light behind the veil. And believe it or not, I'm going to conclude with that at this moment. And I'll give you the prophet of God's words. Everyone listening, he said, "You are the veil. You now veil him." &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you on the authority of God's word. And just behind that veil is a supernatural light. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same God. When next time you see the sun, please look up at the sun. Don't look at it, but look up to it and say, "The same God who put you there put this light here behind this veil." Amen. &gt;&gt; The same God that gave you the strength that you have to warm the earth and to bring forth seeds is the same God who put this light here behind this veil with a with a specific strength with a specific purpose with a divine intent that it shall shine to a certain place and it might be in my workplace or in my home or wherever it is but that God &gt;&gt; of creation put this light here. Hallelujah. Go ye children of light. &gt;&gt; Go and shine into gross darkness. &gt;&gt; And may God be with you. &gt;&gt; May God May God shine his light through you with such intensity it will light the area around you. I know it will. I know it will. &gt;&gt; And the people will see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; They may not all come to it. Excuse me. I had a major part of this message that I'm not able to come to. But you're spiritual. You're mature. You're spiritually adult. And I'm just going to give you the line Jesus speaking. He told the people and told them to beware lest that light that is in them become darkness. &gt;&gt; You might say how can that be? Well, it can be when we just take it too casual. We become insincere and we sit and we become deaf and dull and slow. And it doesn't mean what it's supposed to mean. And I can tell you it's not. It can't light your pathway. Knowledge is light. I would have taken you to Adam and Eve and they partok of a tree of good and evil and they brought forth a son who had knowledge to commit murder. &gt;&gt; Right? and another son who had revelation and offered a sacrifice acceptable to God. So you see all light, all light, even the light of the gospel, it needs to be adhered to. It needs to be reverenced. It needs to be respected, brethren. You can see now imagine, just let your mind go. You've listened to the tapes. A person stands here. The prophet of God stands here and between them is that light. One place he said, "I'm speaking to you through the pillar of fire. I'm speaking to you through that light." And most often, very often, that light would hover over a person and he would say, "You're having a warm feeling. You have a certain feeling." He would describe the feeling because he knew what the light produced. And then he would say to several individuals at different times, he said, "Now, it depends upon what you think this is. If you think it's of God, if you think I'm God's prophet, that's where your reward will come from. Right under that light. But if you think it's of Satan, that's where your reward will come from. I feel like screaming out a warning. Don't sit in Cloverdale Bible way &gt;&gt; with any intent of not adhering to every word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're here on serious mission. &gt;&gt; We're here on serious business. &gt;&gt; Don't allow one shadow, don't allow one thing to interfere with this glorious light. &gt;&gt; God bless you, &gt;&gt; children of the day. &gt;&gt; Children of the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I keep listening. God bless you. We hear about the wars. See famine in the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's questions in the children's eyes. Tring the east again. The whole world is shaking. There's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I keep listening for a different sound of the city. Well, it's the sound of the United with the I listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a different sound. There's a mouth. I remember the preacher saying, "Son, it shall come to pass. There will be a generation [Music] that will be the last. I can't believe we're standing here. the time and the prel Oh yeah. Oh my. [Music] It's the sound of that coming down. It's the sound of the United with the group. Oh hallelujah. I keep listening. I keep listening. I keep listening for a difference. Oh, but I keep listening for his sound [Music] with the I keep listening. I keep listening. &gt;&gt; I keep listening for different. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're listening people. &gt;&gt; I want you to go out here this afternoon, get a little refreshment. Come in. We're going to be packed out this a this evening as well. our brother Jonce, brother uh brother Lineiel and brother Kenneth Jce, brother Louie Bleven's going to be here and our brothers and the musician brothers, we're just happy. We I appreciate being able to worship with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But even more, I want you to take the word that you've heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you'll be conscious this week. &gt;&gt; So this is a dark place. When you see that, say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; The light's coming right in behind it. That's what's making it dark. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a confused place. These men haven't got the answers. Say, "Praise God." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; They can't have it because it's it's The answer isn't in the world. The answer isn't in religion, not in politics, not in your school. It's nothing. It's not in your job. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I feel it all over me now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Mortal life, mortal blood in my veins, but the Holy Spirit surging through this body. &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Lord." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Fill me now. Fill me now. &gt;&gt; Going to send you out from this place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Those of you that shake hands with our brother, and I'll tell you ahead of time, they have to leave right away because they're having lunchon with some people uh who paid a lot to do that. And I thought I'd just tell Rod I got to sing with him. I didn't pay $3,000 for it. I wanted to get him up here so I can sing with him. Hallelujah. Brother David Iverson, would you come please and dismiss us in prayer and ask God's blessing. And and while we're praying, let's pray for the entire Iverson family except mom and dad are remaining, but the families uh flying back to Belgium today. And so we pray God with them and give them a safe and prosperous journey. God bless you, brother David. Amen. Let's just bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, how thankful we are this morning, Lord Jesus. We have heard from you, Lord Jesus. We have heard a message straight from your throne, Lord Jesus. Lord, a message of light, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that your spirit is still working, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you that your spirit is still speaking on this earth, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, we see gross darkness around us, Lord. &gt;&gt; And something in in us is crying out, Lord, to be gathered with you, Lord Jesus, to come back to your light, Lord Jesus.
