Ask our brother Daniel Floren if you would just come and open the service for us. Have one prayer request for our sister Cindy Vineyard. She's still in the hospital. Want to pray that the Lord will continue to give her strength and restore her lungs. The family wants to thank the saints for their prayer. We want to believe that God's going to raise up our sister Cindy. We we don't just bring these requests here because we just want the people to hear about them. We expect God to move. We want to see him move on the scene. So, let's pray for Sister Cindy tonight. If you have a request, just want to raise your hand and let it be made known. Brother Daniel, would you come just open the service for us? God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just we come to you now, Lord. trying to quieten our spirits, Lord, and try to feel your presence, Lord. And &gt;&gt; let your spirit wash over us, oh God, and we want to submit ourselves to you, Lord, and let you have your way, Father. Your perfect will and your way in our lives in this service, Lord. Oh God, we open up our hearts, Lord. We open up our souls, Lord. Whatever you would have for us, Lord, we are here to hear from you, Lord. We are here to receive from you, Father. We heard it today, Lord. We don't want to just let it go into our our our mind, our body, our spirit. We want it to touch that inner man, Father. We want it to burn deep within us, Lord, deep inside, oh God. We want we want you to be in the core of our being, oh God, to be the foundation of our being, Lord. And to let you have your way in our lives, Father, so that you might be reflected from our lives, Lord. So that we might be our your sons and daughters, Lord. Not just be hearers of your word, but be doers of your word, oh God. We pray now, Lord, for those that have been sick this camp. Lord, we just ask you, oh God, that we let your spirit wash over them, Father. Touch them in a special way, oh God. Heal their bodies, Lord. Whatever them problem may be, Lord Jesus, you are more than able, Lord. You are the conqueror, oh God. Oh Jesus, many years ago, oh God, you came down. You stole the keys from Satan.

We pray, Lord, that you would just raise them up even now, Lord. Let them feel a touch from you, feel your spirit wash over them, Lord, that they might get something out of the service, Lord. That they might be touched by you, oh God. &gt;&gt; Father, we ask for brother Ron as he comes and speaks, oh God. Jesus, &gt;&gt; you have spoken to us this morning, Father. You have spoken to us last night, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, it's only getting better, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; You're only coming stronger. You're only coming more, Lord. More and more, Lord Jesus.

Everything that will be done, Lord, we commit it all to you in your precious name, I ask. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shake hands with one another before we have our seats. God bless you. Happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight once again. Amen. And praise the Lord. Thank you, Father. Amen. We're going to prepare to take an offering here in the next few minutes. Maybe just before we do that, why don't we sing He's already provided everything we need. He's already provided. So, the brothers will prepare for that. He's already proided. Oh, he's already proided. Oh, everything we need is already proided. Heat. Heat. Heat. is everything you need. He's already Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. everything you need. He's already provided. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's already provided. &gt;&gt; And how much has he provided? I was standing thinking while we were singing and the prophet of God said, "If you hunger for more, it's because there is more." &gt;&gt; So, do you hunger for more? &gt;&gt; Had a wonderful time last evening. We've had wonderful times in previous camps as well. And there's been those times when it just you seem to get so full you could just burst open. But do you hunger for more? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is more &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have uh whatever needs we may have or whatever burdens or concerns we may have or whatever prayers we have prayed, he has heard them. &gt;&gt; He's a living God. He has ears to hear, eyes to see, and a mouth to speak. Tonight, we expect him to speak through these lips of our brother Ron Spencer. As I said last night, and I will not fail to give thanks to God, I thank God when he spares a man, then we know that there's a purpose for that man. And he spared you and there's a purpose in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, I was just reading before the service, uh, the words of our Lord Jesus, and he said, "I am the good shepherd and, uh, know my sheep and am known of mine. And as the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice. Oh, I'm glad. I'm glad he spoke and I'm glad we heard his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't know how to be thankful to the degree we should be. When Jesus said, "Ears they have, but they hear not." &gt;&gt; But there were others that have ears and they hear. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are your ears. &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes." &gt;&gt; And I say, "Blessed are your ears and eyes." You'll hear something tonight. And I trust you will see something tonight. And then he said, "Them also must I bring. They shall hear my voice. And there shall be onefold and one shepherd." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've been very mindful of that thought. You know, there's only one marriage table. &gt;&gt; There's only one marriage supper table. And we're all going to be at that table. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's only one shepherd. &gt;&gt; There's only one fold. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Those are the unfailing words of promise. &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul said, "And you are one bread." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tonight we're going to receive an offering. And now the water of life is free, but sometimes the pipes need some repair and upkeep. And don't they, brother Ron? The delivery system sometimes needs to be cared for. And uh so this tent and the campgrounds and the chairs and everything else is just part of the delivery system. &gt;&gt; The water that you'll receive and every spiritual blessing is absolutely free. &gt;&gt; So we're going to give tonight liberally and and uh for these servants of God that uh deliver the word. And so uh we're going to ask the Lord to bless the offering. I wonder if the brethren will come forward and and we'll we'll we'll just have a word of prayer. It's a pleasure to give. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was disappointed last night because I had my offering in my hand, but they and I couldn't get their eye for nothing. I couldn't even get it for $20. So, I want to get I'm looking at you, Brother Glenn. So you'll come up this way and let us give our offering. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, what a grand privilege it is to be assembled here with people of like precious faith. How we love you and we've entered into worship as brother Ryan has led us in worship, Lord. And your uh smile of approval, I believe, will be upon this service. And you already have spoken to your servant. You have already given him certain words. You have given him certain thoughts. May they come with such clarity and such power, oh God. And I pray, Father, that each person that's ordained to this service tonight will be sitting here and the enemy perhaps has tried to rob some that have that have uh gotten some bug and got some sickness. I pray that you'll raise them up, Lord, and bring them into this tent, Father, and let them hear the word OF GOD IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. THE AIR AND the very atmosphere is FILLED WITH HEALING FOR GOD. YOU are the healer and you are you fill all time and space. You're here tonight, Lord, to do the supernatural far above our expectation. Bless the offering. Bless the giving, I pray, and the givers in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And everybody said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you as you give the offering. And our brother &gt;&gt; because he lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Because He lives. This is one of the first songs I learned as a young person of the message, 5 years old. Means more to me today than it did then, than it ever has. Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Amen. So let's sing it together. Because he lives, oh, I can face tomorrow. Heat. Heat. And I love I hearing I know. Yes. I behold my true and I become prepare to sing special for us just as Andrew comes because He might be all I know. Yes, I know. Behold my future and life is worth the living because he Holy Father, love me still. I have fallen from your will. I am broken. Hear my humble cry. My cry. Take my life and make it yours. Lord, fill me with your love. You are all I need. I surrender all of me. I have wondered for so long. Tired and weery on my own. In your arms I know I'm home. Oh God, my God, take my life and make it yours. Lord, fill me with your love. You are all I need. I surrender all of me. Take my life and make it yours, Lord. Fill me with your love. You are all I need. I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. Oh, love me. We're not going to delay the service anymore. We've come here to hear the word &gt;&gt; and our brother Ron Spencer has come here to speak the word. &gt;&gt; So now with open hearts Can we all agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. From one side of the tent to the other, we're here to hear God's word. Come, brother Long. Preach the word of God to us. God bless you, brother Ed. Amen. Amen. Let's stand to our feet this afternoon. What a wonderful time we've had already today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Have you had a good time today? &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful service this morning. Brother Tim just delivered a masterpiece this morning. And uh I I tell you what, if that didn't touch your heart, nothing will. It addresses the battles of our lives and what we go through and what we have great need of. and and I I just have enjoyed being with you as a as a group today and shaking your hands and spending some time with you and each and every one. And we love you with all of our hearts. How many's come under expectation to &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to speak to my heart, &gt;&gt; my heart personally. I want you to come come to where I'm at. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we love you with all of our hearts this evening. Lord, as we step to our positions, we're very much aware that angels have been dispatched. This meeting was predestinated before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Why? The very ground here was pre-arranged. When men were marking it out, they didn't know that they were marking it out for a future job to save this place that your children could come and gather. Oh Lord, we ask you just now that you would drive back every enemy &gt;&gt; that would try to distract our minds, &gt;&gt; that would try to attack our bodies. We ask you that you would just come and anoint lips of clay one more time. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use the term give us a temporary resurrection. &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you come and borrow our bodies tonight. Anoint our minds, anoint our hearts, not only the man in the pull pit, but even to the back of this tent. Father, Lord, to those that will hear these services later, I pray that you would just come and speak to our hearts. you know where these words are ordained to go and I pray that you would just gather us just now and we give you all the glory and the praise in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. Amen. He's good to us, isn't he? &gt;&gt; If you will turn with me to Exodus chapter 3 and then we will go to Deuteronomy chapter 6. I would like to speak this afternoon on our God. Our God. &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 3 and 1. Very familiar portions of scripture. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, "I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt." And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Deuteronomy chapter 6, if you can turn there with me, verse one. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whether ye go to possess it, that thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee, thou and thy son, and thy son's sons, all the day of thy life, and the thy days may be prolonged. Hear therefore, oh Israel, observe to do it, that it may be well with thee, that thou may that that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that flowth with milk and honey. Here, oh Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. &gt;&gt; Now notice these statements. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, with all thy might. And these words which I commanded thee this day shall be in thine heart. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shall talk of them when thou sitest in thine house, and when thou walst by the way, and when thy liest down, and when thou risethest up, and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand. And they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house, and upon thy gates. And it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And houses full of all GOOD THINGS WHICH THOU FLEST NOT, &gt;&gt; AND WELLS DIGS, WHICH THOU DIGEST NOT, and vineyards, and olive trees, which thou plantest not, and when thou shalt have eaten, and be full, &gt;&gt; notice this next statement. Then beware, lest thou forget the Lord, &gt;&gt; which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. Amen. You can be seated. Hallelujah. Our God. &gt;&gt; Our God. Notice how that he made quite incredible precedents to make sure that they knew him as a very personal God. He was God to Abraham. He was God to Isaac. He was God to Jacob. He's now God to Moses. He's God to the fathers. He's God to the son and the son's son and to the son's son. Notice how he says it. Teach this diligently. &gt;&gt; Teach this diligently. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Diligently to thy children. Notice how HE SAYS THIS. &gt;&gt; TALK of them when thou sitest in thine house. When thou walkest by the way, and when thy liest down, and when thy riseth up. Now notice these statements. Now, and it shall be that thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to Abraham and to Isaac and Jacob, and to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not. Notice God is letting them know, I'm the one that did this for you. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now notice in Deuteronomy 6 and 20. And he said, "When thy son askketh thee in time to come, saying, "What meanth the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you? THEN SHALT THOU SAY UNTO THY SON, WE WERE in Pharaoh's bondman in Egypt. And the LORD BROUGHT US OUT of Egypt with a mighty hand. And the Lord showed signs and wonders and great and soar upon Egypt and upon Pharaoh AND UPON ALL OF HIS HOUSEHOLD before our eyes. Deuteronomy 7 and verse one. And when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into thy land, whether thou goest to possess it, AND HAS CAST OUT MANY NATIONS before thee, the Hitites, the Geresites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Persites, the Hivites, the Jebusites, SEVEN NATIONS GREATER AND MIGHTIER than thou. Brother Ram said, these were squatters. &gt;&gt; THESE WERE SQUATTERS IN THE LAND. THEY DIDN'T own the land. It wasn't their land. AND JUST BECAUSE Israel showed up and the people OF GOD SHOWED UP DIDN'T MEAN THEY JUST THREW UP THEIR HANDS AND QUIT AND WENT HOME. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SENT HORNETS BEFORE THE CHILDREN of Israel. &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM COURAGE TO TAKE THE LAND. NOTICE WHAT HE SAID. I GIVE IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee, and thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them, neither shalt thy marriages among them, with them. Thy daughter thou shalt not give unto a son, and daughter the daughter, and to take unto the son, and they will turn aside thy son following me, and and serve other gods. So will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy THEE SUDDENLY. BUT THUS SHALL YOU DEAL WITH THEM, and you shall destroy their altars, break down their images, cut their groves, burn their graven images WITH FIRE. FOR THOU ART A HOLY PEOPLE UNTO the Lord thy God. THE LORD THY GOD HATH CHOSEN THEE TO BE A SPECIAL PEOPLE UNTO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS ISRAEL. BUT REMEMBER, THEY'RE ONLY A TYPE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE UNTO GOD. GOD CHOSE YOU &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; GOD PREDESTINATED YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. GOD ORDAINED YOU. HE ELECTED YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Above all the people that are upon the face of the earth. ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. THE NEXT TIME THE ENEMY TELLS YOU YOU'RE NOTHING, TAKE HIM TO THE SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. And the Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you because you were more in number than any people. FOR YE WERE FEWEST OF ALL THE PEOPLE, BUT BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED YOU, &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE WOULD KEEP THE OATH WHICH HE HAD SWORE UNTO YOUR FATHERS, HATH THE LORD BROUGHT YOU OUT WITH A mighty hand, and redeemed you out of THE HOUSE OF THE BONDMAN, FROM THE HAND OF PHARAOH, KING OF EGYPT. &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the Lord this evening? &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? &gt;&gt; Chapter four. And just just just kind of going back before your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Balpr. Notice what he says. He said HE'S SEEN THIS. TAKE heed unto thyself. Verse 9. Keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest THEY DEPART FROM THY HEART ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE, BUT TEACH THEM TO THY SONS AND THY SONS, ESPECIALLY THE DAY THAT the Lord that thou stoodest before the Lord THY GOD IN HOREB, WHEN THE LORD SAID UNTO ME, GATHER me people together, AND I WILL MAKE THEM HEAR MY WORDS, THAT THEY MAY LEARN TO FEAR ME ALL THE DAYS THAT they shall live upon the earth, and they that shall shall teach their children. Are you with me now? Deuteronomy 11:18. Just forgive me for just taking just a few moments. THEREFORE SHALL YOU LAY UP THESE words in your heart and in YOUR SOUL, AND BIND THEM FOR A SIGN upon your hand, that they MAY BE AS FRONTLETS BETWEEN YOUR EYES, AND YE SHALL TEACH them to your children, speaking unto them when thou sitest in thine house, AND WHEN THY WALEST BY THE WAY. SIMPLY PUT, TESTIFY OF IT EVERY HOUR, EVERY DAY. DON'T FORGET THAT GOD DID THIS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T DO IT. YOU DIDN'T BUILD THIS LAND. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T PLANT THESE VINEYARDS. &gt;&gt; I gave them to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1 John chapter 1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, &gt;&gt; which we have seen with our eyes, &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon, our hands have handled of the word of life. Are you with me? FOR THE LIFE WAS MANIFESTED, AND WE HAVE SEEN IT. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SEEN IT AND BEAR WITNESS AND SHOW UNTO YOU THAT ETERNAL LIFE WHICH WAS WITH THE FATHER AND WAS MANIFESTED unto us. Notice the scripture. JOHN 15 AND VERSE ONE. I AM THE TRUE VINE, &gt;&gt; AND MY FATHER IS THE HUSBAND. Every branch IN ME THAT BEARETH NOT FRUIT, HE TAKETH AWAY, and every branch which beareth fruit, he purgeth it, THAT IT MAY BRING FORTH MORE FRUIT. NOW YE ARE CLEAN through the WORD WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN UNTO YOU. ABIDE IN ME, AND I in you. &gt;&gt; That's the branch cannot BEAR FRUIT OF ITSELF EXCEPT IT ABIDE IN THE VINE. NO MORE CAN YE EXCEPT YOU ABIDE IN ME. I AM THE VINE. NOTICE THESE STATEMENTS. I AM THE VINE AND ye are the branches. AND HE THAT ABIDETH IN ME AND I IN HIM THE SEED BRINGETH FORTH MUCH FRUIT. FOR WITHOUT ME you can do nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaks in Minneapolis. Believest thou this? He said, "Abraham 25 years before Isaac was born testify." And believe God when he was a hundred years old, Paul before the storm ever ceased knew what was going to happen because he had God's word for it. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW YOU'VE GOT GOD'S WORD FOR it this afternoon." He says, HE SAID, "OH, I WISH YOU COULD DO THIS. IF YOU'LL DO THIS, HERE'S A CHALLENGE THAT I MAKE AS A MINISTER of the gospel. If you'll believe this afternoon AND THE HOLY SPIRIT WILL COME DOWN IN OUR midst and you can actually while you're praying, feel the Holy Spirit IN YOUR HEART THAT HE'S ACCEPTED YOUR PRAYER. IF YOU'LL STAND ON THAT RIGHT THERE, BELIEVE IT. DON'T FOOL WITH IT ANYMORE. PRAYER IN THE PRAYER LINE. He says YOU DON'T NEED IT. IF YOU'LL BELIEVE IT RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU ARE, THEN THAT SETTLES THE SICKNESS FOR the rest OF THE WAY OUT. THAT'LL DO IT. THEN RISE WITH A STERN FAITH. WALK BOLDLY. &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE WELL? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE HIS WORD. THAT'S WHY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS YOU'RE NOT SAVED BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SAVED. HE SAID, "IF SOMEBODY SAY, "I KNOW I'M SAVED BECAUSE I HAD A CHILL RUN THROUGH ME AND SO FORTH." THAT'S NOT WHY I'M SAVED. SATAN WOULD WHIP ME AROUND THE STUMP ANYWHERE. HE CAN'T UPON YOUR FEELINGS. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEN WHEN I WALK BACK AND SAY, "THUS SAYAITH THE LORD," MY FAITH IS BUILT UPON THE WORD OF GOD. HE CAN'T WHIP ME THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; As a minister, you watch you watch you watch when you don't even consult with other men and you watch when they read a scripture. You watch when they read quotes and then you know that's the first quote you're getting ready TO READ. YOU KNOW AUTOMATICALLY THAT'S GOD ORCHESTRATING an entire meeting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he says remember Jesus had all the qualities of the father in him. Do you believe that? SURE HE DID. ALL THE FINE GIFTS OF GOD WAS IN CHRIST HIS SON. FOR HE WAS THE OFFSPRING OF GOD. HE WHEN HE MET SATAN, HE SAID, "FOR YOUR EXAMPLE, HE NEVER USED ONE GIFT ON HIM." WHEN SATAN CAME TO HIM, HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN." DEUTERONOMY 7:14, HE SAYS 8:14, HE SAID, "MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE." HE SAID, "BUT EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD, SATAN CAUGHT HIM UP AGAIN IN THE PINNACLE OF THE TEMPLE." AND JESUS SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN." &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK HIM ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, AND JESUS SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HERE IT IS. I WANTED YOU TO SEE IT AND GET IT NOW. HE SAID THE WORD OF GOD, THE WRITTEN WORD OF GOD WILL DEFEAT SATAN ANYWHERE, &gt;&gt; ANYWHERE, &gt;&gt; ANY PLACE, ANYTIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S WRITTEN. HE SAID, "THERE IT IS." DON'T YOU LOVE HIM? AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAID, "What does a farmer do? He sews the wheat." He said, "Well, look for the harvest." The next morning, what does he do? He goes out there and he uncovers this why it ain't sprouted. There's nothing to it. Ain't going to have no wheat. And if he isn't going to have any weight and he just digs it up looking for it, he will never have wheat. &gt;&gt; He said, "You just sew it and leave it alone. It's up to God to bring it forth. &gt;&gt; It's up to God to send the rain. It's up to you to accept God's word. It's up to God to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No man's worth any more than his word. AND HE SAID, "AND GOD'S NOT WORTH A BIT MORE THAN WHAT his word SAY THIS." AND I SAY THIS WITH A CHALLENGE IN FAITH THAT EVERY PROMISE OF GOD WILL BE BROUGHT TO PASS IF YOU TAKE THE RIGHT MENTAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. perfect faith. He said, "Let's just stand still just a minute. Let's just worship him in our heart." He said, "He's here. God, he's here." WHO THE IDENTIFIED CHRIST HIMSELF as being the word. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He said the word is sharper than any two-edged sword. He said he said it's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents OF THE HEART. HE SAID WHAT YOU'VE COME HERE FOR. WHAT'S YOUR PURPOSE OF BEING HERE? WHO YOU ARE IDENTIFY JESUS CHRIST TO BE MESSIAH TODAY. IT IDENTIFIES HIM OF BEING THE SAME MESSIAH YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER. DO WE BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. the great physician who is here. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM THAT BELIEVE. IF THEY LAY HANDS ON THE SICK, they shall recover. And if you say to the mountain, "Be moved." And don't doubt in your heart, BUT CAN BELIEVE that he can CREATE SQUIRRELS. WHO HAS NO WAY AT ALL OR NOTHING THERE TO BELIEVE? HE SAID, "IT'S MY OWN FAITH THAT GOES AND DOES THAT." MY FAITH IN WHAT HE CHALLENGED ME TO ASK. HE CHALLENGED ME TO ASK IT. AND I RECEIVED HIS CHALLENGE IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS WORD. I ASKED IT AND IT APPEARED. &gt;&gt; GOD IN HEAVEN KNOWS THAT'S THE TRUTH. CAN HE ALSO HEAL THE SICK? &gt;&gt; AND IF HE CAN LIFT me up WITH A FAITH THIS WAY, EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE, HE SAID, IF THEY CAN'T CLIMB TO THAT BRACKET, IF THEY CAN'T DO IT, HE CAN USE MY FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I'M CLIMBING FOR YOU. I'M BELIEVING FOR YOU. I'M SPEAKING for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes a statement. HE SAID, "YOU TESTIFY OF FAITH THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE, &gt;&gt; THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T FEEL." &gt;&gt; WHY? IT'S THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND IT WILL MAKE THESE ELEMENTS AND THESE MOLECULES &gt;&gt; come to order &gt;&gt; anywhere, ANY PLACE, ANYTIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And we believe it with all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Children of Israel, as they begin to move, and notice very quickly, God provided for them everything that they had need of. &gt;&gt; They never did build an industry for taking care of clothes, &gt;&gt; cuz their clothes never wore out. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO SHOE FACTORIES. &gt;&gt; Cuz their shoes never wore out. &gt;&gt; Brother John, can you turn that just a little bit? That wind their their their food. They never did have to build FARMS BECAUSE GOD PROVIDED FOR THEM THE FOOD THAT THEY HAD need of. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE WIND ACTUALLY THE WATER THAT THEY HAD NEED OF. GOD PROVIDED a rock &gt;&gt; in THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, THAT MAN TOOK THAT MADE THAT PICTURE AND THAT THAT THAT THAT BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK AND HE SAID THERE WAS A ROCK, BUT HE HAD A LITTLE TEACUP." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THAT'S NOT MY GOD." &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. TWO MILLION PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK FROM A TEACUP. ALL OF THEIR ANIMALS, &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD, EVERY BIT OF HER &gt;&gt; HAD TO DRINK FROM THIS WATER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND GOD, LISTEN. IN ALL, IT WOULD TAKE INCREDIBLE COMPUTERS TO BE ABLE TO JUST HAVE THE MIND ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH FOOD IT'S GOING TO TAKE. &gt;&gt; HELP ME, brother Raymond. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. HOW DO YOU GET CLOTHES THAT THAT THAT HAS A WARRANTY? 40 YEARS. &gt;&gt; SHOES THAT HAS A WARRANTY. MY LORD. EVEN FOR SISTERS. 40 YEARS. BROTHERS, you should at least said amen right there real quickly. THEY NEVER BUILT A REHAB CENTER. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER BUILT A HALFWAY HOUSE. &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER BUILT HOSPITALS. &gt;&gt; They never had a merger of care. &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER HAD A NATIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOT POLICE STATIONS EVERYWHERE. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY GOT SICK, GOD GAVE THEM A BRASS SERPENT. AND HE TOLD THEM, "I AM THE LORD THY GOD THAT HEALTH THEE. &gt;&gt; HE HAD EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED. &gt;&gt; I'M THE ONE THAT DID THIS FOR YOU. I'M YOUR GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FORGET THIS. &gt;&gt; NEVER ALLOW AMNESIA TO COME AMONG YOU. &gt;&gt; NEVER LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND YOU. I'm the one that brought the plagues upon Egypt. &gt;&gt; When Moses walked in and he looked at the greatest army and the greatest king on the earth, HE SAID, "JUST TELL HIM I AM." &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "HE'S STILL THE I AM." TONIGHT, &gt;&gt; don't you love the Lord? When Jesus was standing here in flesh and he was standing and he was looking at our enemy, here stood the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. Had fasted 40 days and was quite weary in his flesh. Listen, God knows when we get kind of weary in our flesh. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And so he he stood there and he could have used his great gifts upon him. And when the enemy came and he asked him, "If thou art a message believer, IF THOU ART THE SON OF GOD," AND HE BEGINS TO MAKE HIM some offers. Jesus did not use his gift to destroy the enemy. He simply knowing he was the word begin to quote the word to him &gt;&gt; because there's going to be times IN LIFE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL ANOINTED WITH A PILLAR OF FIRE AROUND YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR THE anointed music. &gt;&gt; YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER IS NOT GOING TO BE SCREAMING IN YOUR EARS. &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO BE STANDING ABSOLUTELY ALONE. AND YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW GOD ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO CHILLS RUNNING UP AND DOWN YOUR SPINE, WHEN YOUR FEET AREN'T GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR, &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO STAND THERE AND THROUGH YOUR MORTAL LIPS OF CLAY, QUOTE, GOD'S ETERNAL COVENANT WITH YOU. IT IS WRITTEN, &gt;&gt; "IF YE ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE DONE." &gt;&gt; YOU'LL TAKE THOSE WORDS, THE COVENANT OF GOD, AND YOU'LL BEGIN TO QUOTE THEM ACROSS YOUR LIPS, YOUR LIPS, BECAUSE YOUR LIPS HAVE THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH IN IT. &gt;&gt; Your lips. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus would stand there and he would quote to them, "I am the resurrection and I am the life." &gt;&gt; When he came to Lazarus's tomb and he was standing there and he went three days out of his own jour out of his own way and and went away even when Lazarus was sick. I'm sure there was a lot of people around that said if he was really a friend of Lazarus, he would have already come and took care of him. BUT YOU SEE, GOD KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT THAT we have NEED OF. YOU SEE, HE KNOWS OUR TRIALS BEFORE THEY WOULD EVER COME TO US. &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "AND HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE IN us to allow us to go through our trials." &gt;&gt; Jesus went a completely different direction. His disciples didn't even understand even why he would go in that direction. And I'm just kind of gathering our thoughts just here just for a little while. And as and as he goes to and he goes to where Lazarus is laying, he meets his sister. and his sister tells him he's late. He's already dead. And Jesus tells her, "I am the resurrection and the life." &gt;&gt; And she begins to talk about the resurrection. And she begins to say, "He surely he'll come in that resurrection." And then he begins to come and he begins to bring her the revelation of who he is. Now notice when he walks to the tomb, he is already clothed in his grave clothes. The worms are already starting to eat him. &gt;&gt; But the circumstances WITH OUR GOD &gt;&gt; IS NOT WHAT HE'S LOOKING AT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LAZARUS WAS ALREADY IN ANOTHER DIMENSION. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; ALREADY TALKING WITH THE ONES THAT JESUS HAS ALREADY quoted to Moses or God has already quoted TO MOSES. I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM. I AM THE GOD OF JACOB. I AM THE GOD OF ISAAC. AND LAZARUS IS NOW SPENDING TIME WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; No doubt testimonies are going backwards and forwards. THEY'RE EXCHANGING LITTLE TESTIMONIES AND LITTLE STORIES AND THEY'RE GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A VOICE THAT IS VERY FAMILIAR TO LAZARUS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ACROSS HIS LIPS HE CALLS LAZARUS BY NAME. &gt;&gt; And brother BROWN SAID HAD HE NOT CALLED HIM BY NAME THERE WOULD HAVE CAME A GENERAL RESURRECTION &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. when he went to the places in the tombs, there was a man named Legion and no doubt he had he had many devils for the scriptures tells us that. BUT IF WE COULD GO BACK, SOMETHING TOOK HIM TO FROM FROM a realm of being a normal human being to one demon came in, then another demons comes in, another other demons comes in. And let ME JUST SAY THIS SHOULD GIVE US GREAT GREAT CAUSE OF FAITH TONIGHT. WE MAY THINK OUR LOVED ONES IS IS LOST AND THEY'RE WITHOUT GOD AND THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM. BUT JUST ALLOW JESUS TO COME THEIR WAY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE NAKED IN THE TOMBS AND THEY'VE GOT CHAINS ALL OVER THEM. THEY'RE NOT WELCOME IN SOCIETY. JESUS KNOWS KNOWS HOW TO GO TO A PREDESTINATED SEED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN, NO DOUBT HE LIVED AMONGST THERE WAS HOLD FARMERS THAT WERE CLOSE AND THEY WERE GOOD. THEY WERE BUSINESSMEN AND THEY THEY WERE VERY UNHAPPY WHEN JESUS CAST OUT THOSE THOSE THOSE DEMONS AND THEY WENT INTO THE HOGS AND THE HOGS HAD MORE SENSE THAN THOSE PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES AND THEY WENT AND DROWNED THEMSELVES. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU NOTICE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT LEGION WAS FOUND CLOTHED AND IN HIS RIGHT MIND. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You heard this morning about our right mind. &gt;&gt; You can't be in your right mind without God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood there and said, "Destroy this temple and in three days I'll raise it up again." He said, "I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again." because he could look at the word and the word said, "I will not suffer mine holy one to see corruption." &gt;&gt; Watch this statement. HE SAID, "ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO THEM THAT BELIEVE." &gt;&gt; And if YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, WHATEVER GOD WILL LEAD YOUR SOUL to believe, &gt;&gt; he said, "That is yours." &gt;&gt; EVERY PLACE THE SOULS OF YOUR FOOT CAN SET UPON BY FAITH, GOD GIVES IT TO YOU. IT'S YOURS. YOU POSSESS IT. HE SAYS IF YOU CAN FIND THE KEY TO THIS LAW OF FAITH THAT OPENS IT TO YOU. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? THAT POWER IS CONTROLLED. IF YOU'RE A SON OF GOD AND YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD, THAT NEVER LEAVES YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S WITH YOU ALL THE TIME, BUT YOUR FAITH GETS AWAY FROM IT, BUT IT'S STILL THERE. HE SAID, WHEN YOU'RE SAVED, GOD GIVES YOU FAITH TO RISE FROM THE MUCK OF THE EARTH. YOUR FAITH OVERCOMES THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. WHAT IS YOUR FAITH? YOUR FAITH IS THAT ACT THAT GOD HAS DID IN YOU TO MAKE YOU A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU QUIT YOUR LYING. YOU QUIT YOUR STEALING. YOU QUIT YOUR DRINKING BECAUSE YOUR FAITH RISES UP FROM ABOVE IT. AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FAITH. AND BY FAITH ARE YOU SAVED. AND THAT THROUGH THROUGH GRACE. AND AS MUCH AS YOUR FAITH WILL BE RELEASED, THAT'S HOW MUCH POWER THAT YOU CAN HAVE. BECAUSE IN YOU DWELLS THE POWER TO MAKE HEAVENS AND EARTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God dwells in you. &gt;&gt; GOD DWELLS IN YOU. I WAS THINKING AS I WAS sitting at the table this afternoon reading these quotes and I was thinking there's huge huge buildings of some of the greatest theologians in the minds of that has been evoluted through time and they don't have a clue what's been released to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If this world only had any kind of revelation of what's been released to you, &gt;&gt; you'd be sitting in rooms to where they're trying to settle peace and economic conditions. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WHY IS THE WORLD WHY IT'S AT WHERE IT'S AT TONIGHT? BECAUSE THEY REJECTED THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BROWN SAID THEY'D HAVE NO NEED FOR HOSPITALS. IF THEY'D ACCEPTED THIS MESSAGE, THEY'D HAD NO NEED FOR A HOSPITAL. &gt;&gt; They'd have HAD NO NEED FOR PRISONS OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY'D HAVE NO NEED FOR MARRIAGE SEMINARS. &gt;&gt; THEY'D have no need. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; THEY'D HAVE NO NEED FOR REHAB CENTERS. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GOD DWELLS IN YOU. YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THERE YOU ARE. BUT IT'S YOUR FAITH. JESUS SAID, "ACCORDING TO YOUR FAITH, BE IT UNTO YOU. IF THOU CANST BELIEVE, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE." &gt;&gt; VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, IF YOU CAN SAY TO THIS MOUNTAIN, "BE MOVED." DON'T DOUBT, BUT BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT KIND OF A PEOPLE OUGHT WE TO BE HAVING FAITH IN THIS GREAT REDEEMING CHRIST THAT LIVES IN US, this smitten ROCK THAT NEVER LEAVES THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOTICE THE STATEMENT. I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, &gt;&gt; EVEN TO THE END OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, Brother Ron, I've never seen a miracle." Let me let me just share a couple of things with you tonight. The greatest miracle you'll ever see is a transformation &gt;&gt; of a sinner. &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle you will ever see is a transformation of a sinner. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I remember in 1978 when brother Ed walked into into Christiansburg, he actually walked in. He probably flew into Christiansburg, but he came into the tabernacle where I was a I was a teenage boy and I sat and I listened to experiences and and as he was just we were just talking about it at the table and he had preached on the resurrection. He was an eyewitness to the supernatural that we have had in this day. And there were certain pieces of the puzzle that for a teenager I was sitting there and I I had listened to the tapes and I as a little as a young man coming up in a message church I listened to the tapes but now pieces of the puzzle was beginning to be put put together in the right places for me. We hear brother Brandham talk about Congressman Upshaw. We realize that an angel of the Lord meets him in a cave in 1946. And and this angel tells him he's going to pray for kings. &gt;&gt; He's going to pray for statesmen. And you see, he can't see what's coming down the road. And I have reasons for these statements. He can't see what's coming down the road. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD. and to tell him of the gift and the strange things that's happened in his life. BUT YOU SEE, THERE'S A STATESMAN that has ran for president at 1926. HIS NAME IS UPSHAW. HE'S HAD AN ACCIDENT. HE'S GOING TO BE IN A WHEELCHAIR. All of THESE YEARS, 49 PLUS years at one statement says, one place says 66 years ON CRUTCHES IN A WHEELCHAIR. ON THIS NIGHT, HE'S BEEN PRAYED FOR. HE'S BEEN PRAYED FOR AND CRUTCHES HAS BEEN JERKED OUT OF HIS HAND. IN WHEELCHAIRS BEEN JERKED OUT FROM BEHIND HIM. BROTHER BRAM SAYS IN ONE PLACE MANY A MAN HAS HAS TRIED TO PRAY FOR HIM AND HE SAYS AND HE SAID HE'S SITTING IN THE BUILDING AND HERE STANDS A PROPHET OF GOD STANDING THERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A VISION BEGINS TO BREAK before him. Man in a brown suit TIPPING HIS HAT AND HE BEGINS TO TELL ABOUT AN ACCIDENT TAKING PLACE. CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW BEGINS TO REALIZE THIS MAN IS NOW TALKING ABOUT ME &gt;&gt; AND IT IS HIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. &gt;&gt; IT IS HIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. I'M THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, WHEN THE WORD CAME ACROSS, HE BELIEVED THE WORD. &gt;&gt; He believed WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT PROCLAIMED IT WAS MORE THAN GUESS WORK. IT WAS MORE THAN A MAN TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF A WHEELCHAIR, BUT THE WORD WAS BECOMING FLESH. &gt;&gt; AND OUR GOD WAS GOING TO HIS PEW. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS. HE WAS NOT GOING TO NEED AN ATTENDANT TO HELP HIM WITH A WHEELCHAIR GET INTO THE BUILDING EVER AGAIN. &gt;&gt; NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE NEED AN ATTENDANT FOR HIS WHEELCHAIR TO PUSH HIM IN. NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY HAND HIS CRUTCHES AND KIND OF SAY TO HIM TO GET SPECIAL ATTENTION BECAUSE GOD HAD VINDICATED HIS UNFAILING WORDS OF PROMISE TO HIM AS AN INDIVIDUAL. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD LIFTED HIMSELF OFF OF THE PAGES OF HIS WORD WHERE IT SAID I AM THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I can only imagine. It's just hard for me to fathom. Here's a woman with a dead baby. And the doctors look at her and tell her, "Go bury your baby. Why do you even have it here at the hospital? Go bury your baby." Instead of taking it to the proper facility &gt;&gt; to bury the baby and say goodbye, &gt;&gt; she wraps it in a blanket &gt;&gt; because she's heard a word the night before. &gt;&gt; And yes, it's raining and the conditions are bad. &gt;&gt; And yes, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL TRY TO KEEP HER FROM GETTING WHERE SHE NEEDS TO GO. &gt;&gt; AND SHE PRESSES HER WAY THROUGH 300 USHERS. AND SHE'S VERY PERSISTENT, &gt;&gt; CATHOLIC IN HER BACKGROUND, &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNOWS IF I CAN GET THIS BABY TO TO TO TO THIS MAN, &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT NOT TAKE HOME A CORPSE, &gt;&gt; IF WE HAD THAT KIND OF REVELATION IN OUR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT TAKE HOME A CORPSE TONIGHT. She carries this baby and even brother Brandom, you know, they begin to make notice that, you know, she's making some SHE'S MAKING SOME NOISE NOW. SHE'S NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. SHE'S NOT ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO JUST BRUSH HER ASIDE. SHE'S NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MOVE HER BACKWARDS. SHE WILL NOT TAKE THE PRESSURE OF OTHER MEN. SHE LITERALLY IS MAKING HER WAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A FAITH THAT HAS SETTLED IN HER HEART. SHE MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE THIRD POLE OF THE SEVENTH SEAL, BUT SHE KNOWS THAT GOD IS OPERATING THROUGH THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN, MANY OF US DON'T HAVE A GREAT GREAT EDUCATION. WE CAN'T EXPLAIN ALL THE DOTS AND THE EYES AND THE TE'S, BUT KNOW YOUR GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FINALLY, brother Brown says, "You know these stories." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Won't you go pray for her? She don't know who who Brandham is. Won't you go pray?" And a vision breaks. He sees a baby well alive. Bring the woman to me. &gt;&gt; And he's standing there holding the baby. And he begins to pray. Hallelujah. He begins to pray. Warmth begins to come. &gt;&gt; A baby begins to kick. &gt;&gt; This girl has had faith. If I can get that baby, if I can get that baby into the presence of God, &gt;&gt; not a man, in the presence of God, &gt;&gt; I'll take my baby home. Oh my God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Says only about an hour later, a man steps BEFORE HIM AND HE'S and he's even his feet are very wrinkled up and his skin's very dry looking. It's very wrinkled in his face and he's blind about my daddy's size. HE'S BLIND AND COMPASSION BEGINS TO MOVE. &gt;&gt; Move on, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OUR GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD. &gt;&gt; THIS MAN HAS IF HE CAN GET INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD, NO LONGER DOES HE HAVE TO STAGGER IN THE DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; WELL, RON, WHY WOULD YOU GO THIS WAY TONIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENEMY TELLS US THAT GOD DON'T DO THESE THINGS ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO TELL THAT ENEMY, MY GOD'S STILL ALIVE AND WELL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PULLS THIS MAN UP CLOSE TO HIM. IT'S ALSO IN BOMBAY. THERE'S A BLIND MAN STANDING BEFORE HIM. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALSO IN JONESBORO. THERE'S A BLIND GIRL &gt;&gt; STANDING BEFORE HIM IN A PARKING LOT &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S COME WITH A TESTIMONY AND HER TESTIMONY IS HER TESTIMONY IS WE HEARD ON THE RADIO &gt;&gt; THAT A MAN FROM KENNETH MISSOURI CAME TO THIS MEETING AND HIS EYES CAME OPEN &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAYS MY DADDY BROUGHT ME DOWN HERE AND WE'RE IN A BUS WE COME DOWN HERE MY I'M LOST MY I'M LOST FOR MY DADDY. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN BEGINS TO TALK TO HER. HE'S WONDERING WHERE HER DADDY MIGHT BE. AND AND HE AND HE SEES THE BUS, THE ONE THAT SHE COME OFF. AND LISTEN, THERE'S THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INTERMINGLING WITH ONE ANOTHER. THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO BROTHER BRHAM IS. AND HERE HE'S STANDING ONE- ON-ONE WITH THIS WOMAN. &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THESE OPTICAL NERVES THAT THESE THESE CATARACT HAS WRAPPED AROUND HER OPTICAL NERVES AND THEY'VE GRIPPED HER AND AND SHE'S BECOME BLIND. THEY WANTED TO DO AN OPERATION WHEN THE CATARACTS GOT RIPE. BUT BUT THEY WAITED TOO LATE. NOW THESE CATARACTS HAVE TAKEN HER EYESIGHT. &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ONLY GET TO THIS THIS THIS THIS HEALER. AND BROTHER BRANDON BEGAN TO EXPLAIN TO HER, I'M NOT YOUR HEALER. &gt;&gt; WILLIAM BRANDON'S NOT THE HEALER. JESUS CHRIST IS YOUR HEALER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BROTHER, brother Brandham began to speak to her and he said, "I'm William Brandham." NOTICE WHAT SHE DID. SHE GRIPPED HIS LAPEL. &gt;&gt; SHE GRIPPED HIS LAPEL AND SHE HELD ON. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LET ME JUST SAY, SHE HAD CAME IN THIS CONDITION, BUT SHE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LEAVE IN THIS CONDITION. LISTEN, IF YOU'RE DETERMINED HERE TONIGHT, &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S SIN, WHETHER IT'S HABITS, &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S SICKNESS IN YOUR LIFE, OUR LORD JESUS IS IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE WAY THAT WE WALKED IN HERE. &gt;&gt; HE CAN LOOSE THE CHANGE FROM OFF OF YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN TO BROTHER BRANAM AS HE BEGINS TO PRAY, "FATHER, WHILE YOU WERE CLIMBING UP THE HILL TO CALVARY, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH." &gt;&gt; Simon Subserene &gt;&gt; carried your cross &gt;&gt; UP CALVAR'S HILL. NOTICE HIS STATEMENT. HERE STANDS ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS. REMEMBER HER, LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HER FAITH. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HER FAITH. SHE SAID, &gt;&gt; "If you pray FOR ME, I'LL FIND MY OWN DADDY." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Sometimes sometimes time seems to, if we're not careful, rob us &gt;&gt; and numb us &gt;&gt; and cause glare and &gt;&gt; even kind of dims our faith if we're not careful. As God began to lay these things together for me a few weeks ago, I'd like to talk about this place just for a few minutes. We're very much aware that we're at Mount Baker Bible Way Camp. This place was reserved so you could come and worship the Lord. &gt;&gt; This place was dedicated before the foundation of the world where his children could come and be at. Now we sit here tonight and we're sitting here 2010 and we know that we are into the ver the very divine orchestration of God. Don't get real quiet on me. Make me nervous. You see, it was about two and a half years ago or about three years ago, 2007. It was on a Monday evening and and I was getting ready to to set a fire and you know this story very well. set a fire to some brush, not knowing I was getting ready to go through one of the trials of my life. You see, I already knew God as a healer because I had seen God when I fell 40 ft and I landed on concrete and every vertebrae from my neck to my cockbone was broken and shattered and cracked and the doctors told me I'd never walk again. with all of their X-rays and all of their knowledge, they looked at me and said, "You'll never walk again." And within a few hours after prayer, feeling begin to came back in my feet. They actually they actually put me in a wheelchair and sent me out the back door. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THEIR HIGHEST PHYSICIAN COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOING FROM A SPOT OF NOT EVER BEING ABLE TO WALK AGAIN &gt;&gt; TO WALKING WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE NOT STORIES OF DECADES AGO. &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW? &gt;&gt; NOT 2,000 YEARS AGO, BUT MY GOD &gt;&gt; WALKED INTO AN ICU UNIT ROOM WHERE A TRAUMA CENTER WHERE DOCTORS WERE DOING THEIR BEST LOOKING AT X-RAYS SAYING, "THIS IS WHAT WE SEE." BUT I HAVE A HIGH PHYSICIAN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO CAN BE TOUCHED WITH THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But laying in a coma for four weeks, SISTER CONNIE WAS WAS GOING BETWEEN ONE HOSPITAL AND THE OTHER HOSPITAL, my oldest son, who had had been just right on time to save my life in the midst of that fire AND THAT EXPLOSION. GOD PROVIDED ME A A SON STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah for that. &gt;&gt; But somewhere around the first week, the end OF THE FIRST WEEK, WHILE THE DOCTORS WERE TELLING HER, "HE'LL NOT LIVE. THERE'S NO WAY HE can make it through WHERE THE THE LIFE SUPPORT system was at running at AT 100% FULL CAPACITY." I had had I had literally I had really all of my stomach fluids had came up into my lungs AND MY ALREADY CHARRED LUNGS, MY THROAT, MY EVERYTHING. AND HERE HERE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE HERE IN THIS AREA, &gt;&gt; GOD WAS UNDER ORCHESTRATION &gt;&gt; FOR THIS NIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD ORDAINS, GOD CALLS, GOD ELECTS, GOD PREDESTINATES. &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T GET NERVOUS. &gt;&gt; GOD IS NEVER IN A CRISIS MEETING. &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER CALLS HIS ANGELS TOGETHER AND RUBS HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAY, "OH MY GOODNESS, THINGS HAVE FELL APART." LET ME JUST SAY, GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERY SITUATION, OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "AND WE KNOW ALL THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD." &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, I HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH YOU to preach in your meeting with Brother Biscll. Sorry I didn't show up. I slept right through it. I'm sure it was a good meeting. Hallelujah. I'D STOOD IN THE FIELD WITH BROTHER TIM. WE'D WENT TO AN OPEN FIELD. WE TOOK A SEED OF WHEAT. STILL HAVE IT IN MY OFFICE TODAY. A SEED OF WHEAT AND WE HAD HELD IT. LISTEN, THEY HADN'T EVEN BOUGHT THE PROPERTY YET. IS THAT RIGHT? HADN'T EVEN BROUGHT THE PROPERTY. BROTHER RON, WE WANT TO BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO AGREE TOGETHER. THIS IS WHERE THE PLACE IS THAT I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BUILD A PLACE, BUY THIS PLACE AND BUILD US A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I FELT A PART OF THAT. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAD BIGGER PLANS. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I BELIEVED WITH BROTHER CAM. &gt;&gt; ONE DAY I'LL PREACH IN THAT PLACE. &gt;&gt; I'm coming. There's movements being made. We want to buy this place. We want to buy this piece of ground. God has laid it on Brother Ed's heart to have me as a speaker. on the other end of the line. That's the last thing that any doctor would think about nine months from now, you'll be the speaker at a convention. &gt;&gt; Lungs are 75% burnt. Throat is burnt. Lips are burnt. Face is burnt. &gt;&gt; Arms is burnt. Neck is burnt. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. BROTHER HAROLD HILDERBRANDT ROLLS OFF OF THE BED THAT NIGHT WHEN he gets the CALL AND HE CALLS ALL OF HIS DEACONS AND GOD LAYS ON HIS HEART. LISTEN, EVERY ONE OF YOU DEACONS, I WANT YOU TO MAKE FOR SURE THAT YOU PRAY THAT BROTHER RON HAS NO SCARS ON HIS FACE. &gt;&gt; I may NOT BE PRETTY, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY SCARS ON MY FACE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BROTHER ED CALLS SISTER CONNIE AND IT'S JUST A MIRACLE TO GET A HOLD OF HER. SHE'S STANDING PUMPING GAS AND SHE'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO SPOTS AND HE BRINGS HER STRONG CONSOLATION AND HE TELLS HER IN HER EAR. HE SAYS, "YOU," HE SAYS, "WE UNDERSTAND TO HEAR YOU. IT'S THE LAST TO GO." AND HE SAYS, "I WANT YOU TO WHISPER IN YOUR IN HIS EARS THESE WORDS THAT WE HAVE BOUGHT MOUNT BAKER BIBLE WAY CAMP. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MEETING NEXT YEAR AT A CERTAIN CERTAIN TIME." AND GOD HAS LAID ON OUR HEART THAT BROTHER RON IS GOING TO BE THE SPEAKER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? THERE'S WORDS THAT'S BEING PROJECTED &gt;&gt; WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; SHE COMES IN THAT THAT LISTEN, NOT JUST AN ICU UNIT, BUT A BURN CENTER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND I'M IN THE MOST CRITICAL ROOM IN THE WHOLE COMPLEX. I'M IN A GLASS ROOM IN A IN A PLACE WITH 100% CAPACITY AND I'M HAVING BAD NIGHTS AND SHE WHISPERS ACROSS HER LIPS THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY, &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME AS A HUMAN BEING &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. TO RESPOND TO THAT SITUATION. BUT THERE'S AN ETERNAL JEAN SEED OF GOD LAYING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOICE WITHIN THE VOICE THAT IS LAYING THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; FORGIVE ME FOR MY FOLLY. THERE'S SOMETHING ANCHORING ME. &gt;&gt; Hanging on. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS. LISTEN, LET ME JUST SAY HE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW DARK YOUR TRIALS ARE. YOU WERE PREDESTINATED TO GO THROUGH THIS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE CHANGED A COMPLETE DIRECTION. BUT GOD ALLOWS US BECAUSE HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE IN US THAT WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH IT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes. I feel like I'm 10 foot tall here just for a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of all of the men. &gt;&gt; BUDD OF ALL OF THE MEN. &gt;&gt; HOW GREAT DOES GOD DO TO YOU? I WISH I wasn't on internet here just for a few minutes, but I want to talk to YOU PERSONALLY. HOW GREAT IS GOD TO YOU? &gt;&gt; Of all OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MINISTERS, HE PICKS YOUR PASTOR TO BE SITTING IN THE CAR. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD COMES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD VISITS HIS PROPHET, &gt;&gt; HE PICKS IS THIS all right? I DON'T CARE. HE PICKED YOUR PASTOR. &gt;&gt; HE PICKED YOUR PASTOR TO BE THE ONE TO HELP ORCHESTRATE BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVE THE PROPHET A VISION. YOU'LL KILL AN ANIMAL CHOCOLATE AND HAVE 42 IN HORNS. AND THEN BEFORE HE GETS BACK TO CAMPSITE, HE'S GOING TO KILL A SILVER TIP GRIZZLY BEAR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S NOT A GUIDE IN CANADA OR IN AMERICA OR IN AFRICA THAT CAN PRE-ARRANGE THAT KIND OF A TRIP. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THE SAME KIND OF GOD THAT TURNED AROUND TO A TO A DISCIPLE THAT HAD A HABIT OF CARRYING A HOOK WITH A WITH A STRING ON IT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAXES. GO DOWN AND DO SOME FISHING, PETER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU PUT IT IN A CERTAIN SPOT. YOU'RE GOING TO PULL OUT A FISH, OPEN HIS MOUTH. IT'S GOING TO HAVE MONEY IN IT. &gt;&gt; ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY YOUR TAXES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight, parents, and you may be going through a financial disaster, and there's no way in the world physically you can MEET YOUR NEEDS. PUT IT IN GOD'S HANDS. QUIT WRESTLING WITH IT. PUT IT IN GOD'S HANDS. GOD SIGNED A COVENANT WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD. OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; We don't have to HAVE AN IMAGINARY GOD. WE GOT A GOD THAT'S ON THE SCENE. WE HAVE A GOD THAT IS AMONG US RIGHT NOW IN THIS BUILDING. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SERVING A REVIVAL OF 500 YEARS AGO OR 200 YEARS AGO OR 50 YEARS AGO. OUR GOD IS RIGHT AMONG US RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; And God's pre-planning. He sees a boy in a checkered shirt &gt;&gt; THAT HIS WIFE WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW AWAY. You know these stories over and over AND YOU'VE HEARD IT. YOU'VE HEARD IT LIP TO EAR to you. &gt;&gt; AND WHY DID GOD ALLOW YOU TO BE A PART OF THAT? ARE YOU WITH ME? TO SUPPORT THAT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT GOD ORDAINS, &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD ELECTS, ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? YES. &gt;&gt; You've heard brother Brown quote it hundreds of times as they're walking back down the mountain. I see no grizzly bear. I see no silver tip. &gt;&gt; Are you doubting the vision? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How in the world could the rapture take place? Are you doubting the vision? &gt;&gt; HOW WILL WE SIT AT A TABLE A THOUSAND MILES LONG? ARE YOU DOUBTING THIS? &gt;&gt; OH NO. &gt;&gt; OH NO. &gt;&gt; IF I COULD TALK TO HIM PERSONALLY, I'D SAY I LAID IN A COMA FOR 4 WEEKS AND GOD KNEW I WAS GOING TO PREACH ABOUT NINE MONTHS LATER. &gt;&gt; I came here. I preached at that time. You didn't realize it, but I was still suffering with a lung condition because my lungs were so scarred. God gave us grace. &gt;&gt; God blessed us. &gt;&gt; But you see, God is mindful. &gt;&gt; He is extremely mindful. your pastor. We went to North Carolina the week the two weeks later at brother Joe Green's meeting. It was it was either Thursday night or Friday night. I believe it was Friday night. I was s set sitting it's kind of a theater type setting and there's a balcony area that actually wraps around and I was sitting on the left side if you were looking at the back of the building and I sitting on the left side with sister Connie and my father-in-law and my mother-in-law and I was sitting there and I was wore out and at that time I was struggling just to go up steps to run on a treadmill would be out of the question. I had not been able to ride a bicycle, which is one of my passions to do because I just didn't have the lung strength to do it. Doctors were telling me different things that I should be happy with what I had. But the Lord said, he said, "I am the Lord that health thee." &gt;&gt; And I understand something about God. He doesn't do halfway work. Brother Biscll begins to preach. And as he begins to preach, he preaches on bringing order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; And he talks about the earth and how this earth is without form and void. AND GOD BEGINS TO SPEAK to the earth. You've you've probably heard him preach that same sermon. He begins to speak to the earth and God has a vision of what it's going to be like and he begins to bring it forth. And then brother Briscoll goes to the I've told this many other places so I can rehearse it easy. And and he begins to go to the spirit realm and how that we go through different things in our life like brother Tim talked about this morning. Many things that we go through and depression and nervousness and and anxiety and strains of our life AND AND GOD SPEAKS TO IT AND HE BEGINS TO BRING THAT BACK INTO ORDER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE COMES TO THE PHYSICAL REALM AND SOMETHING QUICKENS IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I AM SITTING HERE AT THE RIGHT TIME. &gt;&gt; WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD IN THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; I'M AWARE OF WHAT THE DOCTORS HAVE SAID. &gt;&gt; I'M AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THIS CONDITION. BUT HE SAID, "I AM THE GOD THAT HEALTH THEE." AND AS THE WORD BE TO GO FORTH IN THAT VERY SECTION OF MINISTRY, I GRABBED A HOLD OF IT. AND JUST AS CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW HAD SAID, JUST AS A LITTLE MEXICAN GIRL THOUGHT, JUST AS THE MEXICAN MAN AND THOUSANDS AND TEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT STEP BEFORE BROTHER BRANDHAM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO, BROTHER BIS IS NOT BROTHER BRHAM. AND NO, I'M NOT BROTHER BIS OR BROTHER BRHAM. I CAN'T I CAN'T CARRY THEIR LUNCH BOX. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. THE GOD THAT LIVED IN WILLIAM BRANA, &gt;&gt; THE VOICE THAT WAS BEHIND THE VOICE, &gt;&gt; THE MAZDC OF THIS AGE, &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY ANGEL &gt;&gt; DID NOT DIE IN 1965. BUT THERE'S A MINISTRY ON THE EARTH &gt;&gt; THAT IS ANOINTED TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE AND SWEEP IT TO THE COMING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU TONIGHT, YOU'VE GOT A CHECKBOOK. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A WORD FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND SAY, "RIGHT NOW'S MY TIME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; God gave me this one. So, I'm going to deliver it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was there when my father had his fingers cut off and literally rolled them off and the doctor looked, he had about 10 guys standing around him and he was training the other doctors said, "Well, this is what we do when a man gets his fingers rolled off like that. We just make nubs off of them, pull skin over top of them. And I heard him say it. I said, "Just a moment. If I could have your if I could talk to you just a minute." He said, "Yes, sir." I said, "Who are you?" And I said, "I'm Charles Spencer's son." And you got him on morphine and he can't speak for himself. But I want to tell you what we've been taught by a prophet of the Lord. We've been taught by a prophet of the Lord &gt;&gt; that said you were God's agent on the earth &gt;&gt; that God anoints your gift because your care for humanity and we COME HERE WITH THE CONFIDENCE FOR YOU TO PUT THOSE FINGERS BACK ON. AND WE BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL HEAL THOSE FINGERS. THAT MAN TURNED TO HIS INTERNS AND HE SAID, "THEN WHAT WE MUST DO RIGHT NOW IS GO PUT SOME FINGERS ON." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'LL JUST TELL YOU THIS STORY JUST VERY QUICKLY. LET ME JUST SAY WHEN THE DOCTOR HE WENT BACK ABOUT 7 TO 10 DAYS LATER AND HE UNWRAPPED THOSE FINGERS, THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK AND BLUE. THOSE FINGERS NEVER even bruised. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? MY FATHER-IN-LAW WHO BROTHER FRASIER, brother Frasier, who brother Biscll has met many times and and listen, if you're just around brother Homer any minute OF TIME, YOU REALIZE that brother Homer really needed to be saved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's kind of man that when he looks at you when I WAS A BOY, I WAS GETTING ready to marry his daughter. He said, "We need to go to the gas building." And I thought, "Well, no, I don't want to go to the gas building." And he looks at says, "Brother Ron, we're going to the gas building." I don't have no reason to go to the gas building. We're going to the gas building. and he points that 45 looks like a 9 mm finger. Don't you never lay a hand on her or you'll have to face me. &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't care if she'd pull a gun and shoot me. I wouldn't lay a hand on her. God bless you, Brother Homer. Brother Homer, I was preaching at Brother Jeff Jenkins and it would take God to wake me up at 3:00 in the morning, get me to drive home. And I woke up at three and I just felt impressed to drive, start driving. I start talking to Connie in the morning. She said, 'What are you doing on the road?' And I said, 'I don't know. The Lord must have woke me up and sent me home. And I was awake as much as I am standing here. I hope as awake as you are. And I begin to drive and I drove and I get there just in time to eat a little supper. I eat supper with them. Brother Homer says, "You want to go, honey?" No. No. I I haven't even unpacked my bags. I hope you have a good evening. And I start home and he starts towards the woods and within about 20 minutes he calls me. He said, "Brother Ron," he said, "Where are you at?" And I told him I was going up the road to the house. He said, "I fell out of the tree. I need you to bring a canvas and get the boys and carry me out of the woods." First of all, Brother Homer weighs about 230 lbs. He's just a bit over six foot tall. He's a man. &gt;&gt; Maybe 70 a couple years old, but he's a man. And he said, uh, I can't feel my legs. When I get there, his leg is laying on his back and he's white as a ghost. And we begin to pray and we feel the presence of the Lord. When the rescue team comes, they they they don't even know how to move him because his pelvis is shattered all the way through. We would later see that it was just literally mangled bone and shattered bones. They bring in architects and they begin to restructure with metal and all kinds of screws and all kinds of And here was his statement. I'll preach again, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll dance again. &gt;&gt; I did this to THIS TO MYSELF. ARE YOU WITH me now? &gt;&gt; Incredible pain, incredible rehabilitation. BUT TO LOOK AT IT, NO WAY. NO WAY WOULD YOU EVER THINK HE'LL EVER WALK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAVE A HIGH POSITION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; We have a HIGH PHYSICIAN. AND LISTEN, EVEN AS HE'LL PREACH FOR ME THIS WEEKEND, LISTEN, WE HAVE THE KIND OF PHYSICIAN THAT CAN WALK INTO A HOSPITAL ROOM &gt;&gt; WHEN DOCTORS ARE SHAKING THEIR HEAD AND CAN'T PUT THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. WE HAVE A HIGH PHYSICIAN THAT CAN WALK INTO A HOSPITAL ROOM. WHEN THEY GIVE NO HOPE, WE CAN HAVE HOPE. YOU FORGIVE me for taking my time here just for a few minutes. &gt;&gt; Well, ONE OF MY DEACONS CALLS ME AND SAYS, "MY LITTLE BOY'S GOT A FEVER." LATER ON, HE'S GOT A HIGHER FEVER. BEFORE LONG, HE'S GOT A HIGHER FEVER. LONG AND SHORT OF IT, FROM THAT MORNING TILL THAT EVENING, THEY'VE GOT HIM IN AN ICU UNIT IN IN the university hospital. And the doctor walks IN AFTER QUITE A SPELL AND SAYS HIS TEMPERATURE HAS WENT TO A LEVEL until it has caused brain damage. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS MORNING EVERYTHING'S BEEN WELL. A FEVER STRIKES AND NOW IT'S TO THIS POINT. LISTEN, 24 HOURS. WHAT A DIFFERENCE 24 HOURS CAN MAKE. &gt;&gt; Let me just say THIS TO YOU. YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU FEEL GOOD TODAY, BUT 24 HOURS CAN MAKE AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CLAUS ME. AND HE SAID, "BROTHER RON, THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE TOLD ME." I SAID, "THE SCRIPTURE ISAIAH SAID, WHOSE REPORT DO WE BELIEVE?" &gt;&gt; AND I WALK IN THERE. I WALK IN THERE AND WE BEGIN TO PRAY AND I TAKE A HANDKERCHIEF THAT WE'VE ANOINTED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ACTS 19 TELLS US TO DO. AND WE LAY HANDS ON THAT LITTLE BOY AND WE PRAY FOR THAT LITTLE BOY AND WITHIN 50 MINUTES THAT LITTLE BOY IS BACK IN HIS RIGHT MIND. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let the redeemed say so. &gt;&gt; HE'S AN AWESOME GOD. &gt;&gt; We have a man sitting in this tent tonight. I'm not GOING TO POINT HIM OUT, BUT HIS SISTER, HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT HER TWO years living with another woman, HAD MOVED STATES AWAY. AND SHE WALKS TO THE ALTAR AND SAYS, "I WANT MY HUSBAND BACK. I WANT HIM TO BE A REAL CHRISTIAN. &gt;&gt; WE PRAY. WE PRAY. IT'S NOT A HUNDRED PEOPLE PRAYING. WE PRAY." &gt;&gt; FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, ON TUESDAY, THAT MAN'S BACK AND HE SAID, "SUNDAY ABOUT A CERTAIN CERTAIN TIME, SOMETHING SPOKE TO ME TO GO HOME. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE IF YOU'LL HAVE ME." THE NEXT WEEK, I'M PREACHING AT A CHURCH. THAT MAN IS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE AND HERE HE COMES RUNNING TO THE ALTAR. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; I just share this with you. I WAS SITTING ON A BALCONY. WE WAS TAKING A FEW DAYS HOLIDAY. And something impressed ME TO GET UP AND go to the door and look out AND HERE COMES BROTHER JOEL Ray just say just all right here he's coming walking down the walking down the aisle and he's he's walking down the this this hallway. Come on in here. Come on in here. We've already had this meeting. He comes in. He sits down with me and we're enjoying the day and all of a sudden I begin to feel the presence of the Lord and I begin to speak to him. Before long he begin something be to move like brother Tim preached this morning without a whole lot of emotion God moves us from one stage of our life to the next. And he takes a boy that's very confused. &gt;&gt; He's got a lot of scattered directions and clears it right up. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; That's our God. &gt;&gt; Not a whole bunch of explanations of quotes and psychologist sitting around saying this is the direction you need to go. Brother Ron, I'm worried about my children. They're on drugs. Just Just let them GET IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, MY MARRIAGE IS ALL TO PIECES. JUST GET IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; In that same meeting, MY BOYS HAD CAME HERE BECAUSE OF OF BROTHER BISCLL'S VISION. I BROUGHT MY BOYS BECAUSE MY SON HAD SAVED MY LIFE. THE OTHER SON HAD TOOK ME TO THE RESCUE AND AND AND IT MADE US A TIGHTER FAMILY. WE STILL ARE. BUT MY SECOND SON DIDN'T HAVE WHAT HE NEEDED. HE WAS MARRIED, BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE WHAT HE NEEDED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE A STAGE IN MY LIFE, I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I NEEDED. &gt;&gt; I KNEW GOD SENT A PROPHET. I KNEW THE DOCTRINES OF THE WORD, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I NEEDED. &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, WHAT MOSES LACKED WAS INSIDE OF THAT BURNING BUSH. &gt;&gt; AND HIS WIFE SAID ABOUT WHERE BROTHER JOEL IS SITTING. AND SHE SAT THERE TWO YEARS AGO. AND SHE SAT THERE AND SHE SHOUTED AND SHE HOLLERED AND SHE SCREAMED AND SOME ASKED, "HAS SHE DID THAT MANY TIMES?" IT WAS HER FIRST TIME. &gt;&gt; IT WAS HER FIRST TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ANDREW SAT THERE AND HE WAS JUST KIND OF NUMB BY ALL THE EVENTS THAT WERE GOING ON AROUND HIM. BUT WE WENT TO WE WENT AND TOOK A FEW DAYS HOLIDAY THIS WITHIN HOURS OF MY TALKING TO TO BROTHER JOEL. LISTEN, I HAD NOT TALKED TO BROTHER TOM. BROTHER ANDREW DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE EARLIER IN THE DAY. AND WE'RE STANDING IN THE STREET. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER ANDREW TURNS TO BROTHER TOM AND BEGINS TO TALK TO HIM AND OPENS UP HIS HEART. &gt;&gt; OPENS UP HIS HEART. LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE BYPASSING HIM LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE. BUT GOD CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; GOD CAME DOWN. &gt;&gt; GOD MET MY SON. OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'VE GOT THE PICTURES ON THE WALL OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR GOD, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT OUR GOD LIVING ON THE INSIDE OF US. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's why I say this to you. DON'T NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP ON YOUR CHILDREN. BOO DEVIL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ENEMY WILL TRY TO CRUSH THEM. HE'LL TRY TO ABUSE THEM. HE'LL TRY TO PUT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND PORNOGRAPHY AND THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND SMOTHER THEM. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T NEVER GIVE UP ON THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I say this tonight, at the turn of this last year, God be to deal with Andrew. And Andrew now is a minister of this gospel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; You see, THIS IS A SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL. IT WAS SUPERNATURAL TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD GIVE YOU HOUSES YOU DIDN'T BUILD. OUR GOD GIVE YOU VINEYARDS YOU DIDN'T PLANT. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH. OUR GOD STOOD THERE AND SAID, "I AM HE THAT HAD THE KEYS OF DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. AND I AM ALIVE FOREVER MORE. I AM ALPHA AND OMEGA." &gt;&gt; OUR GOD STOOD STEPPED FORTH WHEN THE MIGHTY ANGEL SAID, "WHO IS WORTHY TO TAKE THE BOOK?" OUR GOD STEPPED HE BECAME MY KINSMAN REDEEMER. &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT 10 MILLION MILES AWAY. &gt;&gt; The requirement if two or three are gathered, TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED. TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED IN MY NAME, I'LL BE IN THE MIDST. WE HAVE COME WITH GREAT EXPECTATION. &gt;&gt; Maybe you WASN'T EXPECTING THIS TONIGHT, BUT I TELL YOU, HE'S HERE. HE DEALT WITH MY HEART. I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU. SURE, HE WAS HERE 2,000 YEARS AGO AND HANG ON THE CROSS. HE WAS HERE AND HE RESURRECTED. BUT OUR GOD IS HERE TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Can you give me about five more minutes? Ron, but you just don't know my circumstances. I want you to listen to the prophet of God's words. The devil hates me. &gt;&gt; And he said, I KNOW HE HATES YOU, TOO. &gt;&gt; You ever feel that? &gt;&gt; He's my enemy. BUT AS LONG AS GOD IS MY FRIEND, I DON'T HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Why did Stonewall Jackson could sit there on his horse with a confidence? He said, "I'm as safe on the battlefield as I am at home in my bed." &gt;&gt; For always say to be absent from this body is to be present with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; I stepped off of the stage one night and brother Lonnie Jenkins shook my hand and he said, "Brother Ron, you make that look so easy." He said, "While you're smiling and you're cutting our hearts out doing heart surgery, I enjoy cutting the devils away. The devil hates me and I know he hates you, too. &gt;&gt; And he's my HE'S MY ENEMY. BUT AS LONG AS GOD IS MY FRIEND, I HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM. I JUST DRIVE HIM RIGHT BACK AND TAKE THE WORD of God and move him right back out of his out of the place that he THINKS HE'S A HOLDING. HE HASN'T GOT NO STRONGHOLDS. HE'S ABSOLUTELY LEGALLY DEFEATED IN EVERY PLACE. THE DEVIL HASN'T GOT ONE LEGAL RIGHT AT ALL. NOWHERE. HE'S JUST A DEVIL AND A PASSWORD. THAT'S ALL. HE HASN'T GOT NO LEGAL RIGHT TO ANY MAN THAT'LL ACCEPT THE PROMISE OF JESUS CHRIST. HE'S WHIPPED. &gt;&gt; He's whiffed IN SICKNESS. HE'S WHIFFED IN DISAPPOINTMENTS. HE'S WHIFFED IN EVERYTHING. HE'S WHIFFED IN DEATH. HE CAN'T SCARE ME. HE CAN'T SCARE YOU. THAT'S ALL HE IS. HE'S JUST A BIG OLD SHADOW. &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brown and pray. Oh Satan, YOU WHO HAVE BOUND THE SICK, COME OUT OF THE PEOPLE. YOU'RE DEFEATED BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPOSED. CHRIST IS RAISED FROM THE DEAD AND IS ALIVE TONIGHT and forever more. HE SAYS, "AND WE DECLARE UNTO YOU THAT YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS. CHRIST STRIPPED YOU OF EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAD AT CALVARY AND IN HIS GRACE, VICARIOUS SUFFERING, AND IN HIS DEATH, HIS TRIUMPH OF RESURRECTION. HIS APPEARING HERE TONIGHT HAS BROUGHT US THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'S A LIVING AND HE'S ANOINTED US &gt;&gt; AND HIS PRESENCE IS HERE NOW. AND SATAN, YOU CAN'T HOLD THEM ANY LONGER. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THEM IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You've heard this before. I'll say it again. And the word of God will DEFEAT THE ENEMY ANY PLACE. ANYWHERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ANYTIME. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. No matter if he was in a storm of the gales and knocking the boat from one side to the other and he was standing in the face of a mess of demons. If he was hanging anywhere, it never moved him. He walked on just as calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him. &gt;&gt; He said whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen. He knowed it was going to happen because God said so. He didn't say, "I wonder if I prayed long enough. I wonder if I fasted long enough. I wonder if I did this or that." He just simply walked right on unconscious. That's right. He believed what God said was the truth. The words must BE FULFILLED. HE KNOWED WHAT HIS LIFE WAS TO FULFILL THEM. HE WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FAITH THAT HE HAD. HE JUST SPOKE IT AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER SAID, "I'M SO GLAD THAT A MAN CAN SO COMPLETELY SERVE GOD TILL THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM." OH YEAH. FAITH KNOWS NO DEFEAT. FAITH IS PERFECT. FAITH BRINGS THINGS WHEN THERE'S NO THINGS TO BE BROUGHT. FAITH CREATES. FAITH TAKES DOUBTS AWAY. TAKES NEGATIVE AND MAKES IT POSITIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. PERFECT FAITH IS A MASTER TO ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. PERFECT FAITH MASTERS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IT MASTERS IT ALL. WHEN YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING, YOU GOT FAITH IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING. NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS, THAT DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT MASTERS THE CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; Notice the statement. And we BECOME ANOINTED WITH THAT SAME SPIRIT, ANOINTED MESSIAHS, MESSIAHS OF THE LAST day to shine forth the resurrection of Jesus CHRIST TO SHOW THAT HE'S NOT DEAD. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD THAT WAS IN A CAR. OUR GOD THAT SAW A 42IN HORNS ON A CARIBOU. OUR GOD THAT SAW A GRIZZLY BEAR. OUR GOD THAT SAW A BOY IN DEAD TH HIT BY A CAR AT 60 M AN HOUR. OUR GOD SAW ALL OF THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OUR GOD THAT SAW THE ACCIDENT I WOULD BE IN. OUR GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I am the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac, THE GOD OF JACOB. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, as we stand here this evening, I did my best to behave myself, but Lord, there's something about it gets me excited when I think about the things that we have seen you do. We have seen you work one miracle after another miracle. Lord, in this message that has been brought to us, supernatural vindication to it, it was more than just a pillar of fire joining our prophet in Houston. It was more than just to a boy in Finland. It was more than just a Hatty Wright's children. It was more than just a congressman upshaw. It was a revealed word to this bride, &gt;&gt; Lord. And we become anointed with that word and step into this word of this day. We sit in this building tonight and aware that we're literally walking within the vision of your mind. And Lord, IN OUR HUMANITY, WE SOMETIMES feel like quitting. We get discouraged. Circumstances of LIFE SEEM TO TURN US UPSIDE DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS TRIES TO PREVAIL. BUT LORD, GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN US THAN HE THAT IS IN the world. &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, TONIGHT WE'VE HEARD THE WORD SAY God will defeat the enemy anywhere, any place, anytime. &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the conditions behind every heart and every hand that would be here this afternoon. Lord, you know the battles that we're going through. Lord, I ask you that you'd sweep across this audience tonight. Lord, as David stood there and testified about a to a to a backsliden king, he was facing a great champion and all he had was a sling and some stones, but he had a testimony that God had gave him a bear. He had A TESTIMONY THAT GOD had gave him a lion. and that God would give him Goliath. &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, YOU RAISED ME OUT OF A COMA. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE DOCTOR SAID I HAD NO BRAIN ACTIVITY FOR 36 HOURS, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, WHEN ALL HOPE SEEMED TO BE GONE, &gt;&gt; your servant of THE LORD, BROTHER TIM, WALKED INTO MY ROOM AND PRAYED FOR ME. OH GOD, LORD JESUS, TONIGHT WE STAND HERE AS A TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS SATAN HATES US, &gt;&gt; HE HATES THE WORD THAT LIVES ON THE INSIDE OF US. &gt;&gt; LORD, WE'RE A TESTIMONY THAT THIS MESSAGE IS TRUE. AND IT'S MORE THAN MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; IT'S A LIFE THAT LIVES INSIDE OF US. IT IS A LIFE THAT KEEP THESE YOUNG GIRLS &gt;&gt; IN THEIR PURITY IN THE HOLINESS OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S A LIFE THAT KEEPS EVERY DEMON AWAY FROM THEM &gt;&gt; THAT CAUSES YOUNG MEN TO BE REAL MEN THAT KEEPS THEM AWAY FROM PORNOGRAPHY. KEEPS HIM AWAY FROM DRUGS. KEEPS THEM CALL AWAY FROM THE WRONG KIND OF AN INFLUENCE. LORD, OUR GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD. &gt;&gt; And we STAND HERE TONIGHT WITH A TESTIMONY OF VICTORY. &gt;&gt; WE MAY NEVER SPEAK A WORLD INTO EXISTENCE. WE MAY NEVER SEE A GREAT MIRACLE BEFORE OUR EYES, BUT GOD, JUST BECAUSE WE'RE STILL STANDING, IT'S AN INCREDIBLE MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; Oh God, tonight, &gt;&gt; WHAT A VICTORY IT IS JUST TO BE HERE. LORD, I ask you, Father, that you'd go across this audience just now, &gt;&gt; Lord, may the f faith that has been stirred in this building, &gt;&gt; may the anointing that I have felt across this audience, Lord, may that word be quickened in their hearts and may they respond, "This message was for me. &gt;&gt; This message was for me. MAY I GRAB A HOLD OF THIS ANCHOR TONIGHT AND hold on. No matter how bad the wind gets, NO MATTER HOW DARK the night gets, he's our God. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; My God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; More than Paul's God. More than the disciples God. More than Martin Luther's God. More than JOHN WESLEY'S GOD. MORE THAN WILLIAM BRANDHAM GOD, MORE THAN MY DADDY'S GOD, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY GOD TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PERSONAL GOD TO ME. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PERSONAL GOD TO my &gt;&gt; Oh God, go to every pew. Settle this in their life right now tonight. Oh God, they have to stand alone. Let them know you're with them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could you stand to your feet just now? Raise your hands over your hands. God. Lord, I bring you my needs right now. It may seem impossible of what you're going through. How in the world am I going to ever get through this? I want you to give it to him right now with your lips, right where you're standing at right now. &gt;&gt; You have a need standing here this evening. Would you just lift it before God and say, "God, I have need of this. Hallelujah. Just bring him your needs right now WITH A GREAT EXPECTATION THAT HE'LL MEET that need. &gt;&gt; He'll meet that need. He knows. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE ALREADY KNOWS. BUT ASK HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ANCHOR IN YOUR SOUL TONIGHT. WE'VE HEARD THESE TESTIMONIES. He knew WHERE YOU'D BE SITTING AT. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHO YOU'D BE STANDING BESIDE OF. &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THE CONDITION THAT YOU'D BE IN. &gt;&gt; Let it be settled right here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's all I need. He's all I need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He's all I need. He all I need. Jesus is your &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Won't you just let him come to you just now? &gt;&gt; Our God. Our God is all I need. Jesus is all I need. All I need. Jesus is all I need. He is all I need. is all I need. Jesus is all I need. He is all I need. Jesus is all I need. &gt;&gt; Let's just be in prayer now. Let's just be a prayer. &gt;&gt; He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all. Look, I'd like your undivided attention. If you look this way for a few moments, the service is not over. The word has been preached and now you're going to confirm that word with signs following. There are some here, maybe a few, maybe many, I don't know. But you are at you are at your moment. God takes his word very very serious. And if he's been speaking to you, he doesn't intend for you to go out this tent without doing business with him. It doesn't have to be some big flash, some big thunder, some great uh emotional thing. When you do business with God, like brother Tim said this morning, when God dealt with him, he just became very quiet. I'll tell you the morning I was sitting in my study and I just began to get real heavy and burdened for Sister Connie. And I then my mind thought because now my heart was burdened. I knew it was the Holy Spirit. And I I thought her husband who's the head of her home and her life is hanging just on a thread between life and death. And her son is also burned badly and she's she's alone and the Holy Spirit says call her. And I looked up the phone number and the only phone number I had was her home. And right away your mind starts to reason and the enemy is saying, you know, she's not home. And I said, I I know she's not home, but I it's the only number I have and I'm going to call her home. I called her home number and she picked up the phone and I said, "Sister Connie, where are you?" She says, "I'm between two hospitals." I said, "But I called your home phone number." And she said, "I had it forwarded to myself." And she says, "I'm between two hospitals. My son is in one and my husband is in the other." I said, "We've been following close the condition of brother Ron and I know that the condition that he's in." I said, "Right now," I said, "My burden is for you because you haven't had any headship." And and and and you know what? I want you to tell you one thing that God is mindful of you right now. He's mindful. Listen folks, God's not only mindful of Connie, he's mindful of you where you are right this minute. &gt;&gt; He knew that you were going to be in this service. He knew that you were going to hear this message and all of these supernatural testimonies, as brother Ron has said, not of 2,000 years ago or even 50 years ago. Right now, you're looking at the evidence. You are eyewitness of it. &gt;&gt; And perhaps there's something stirring in your heart and saying, "God, I need to do business with you. &gt;&gt; I need to do business with you. This thing has hung on to my life long enough, and I'm here." Maybe someone's here still living in sin as an unbeliever. Listen to me, friends. Listen to me. The time is now. The time is up. &gt;&gt; It's our God that wants to deliver you. I'm not going to beg for you to come if you haven't got enough sense to come and you'll have to stay bound in sin. But if you want to be delivered from it, I'm saying that God IS HERE NOW, OUR GOD, &gt;&gt; and you can pass by here AND NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. And I said to Sister Connie, "Sister Connie, we've just bought a camp." And I know from the medical people, from talking to them, that when a man or a person is in deep unconscious state, the last sense that leaves them is their hearing. I want you to go up to brother Ron's ear and you say to him, "Brother Biscll and the people have just bought a camp and he is going to preach next year in that camp, the camp meeting." And you speak that in his ear. Hallelujah. And friends, it wasn't just an emotion. It happened. &gt;&gt; It happened EXACTLY THAT WAY. AND YOU'RE AN EYEWITNESS TO IT. And many of you were here in this tent. You don't know THE BACKGROUND, BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. AND THAT'S OUR GOD. AND IT'S THE SAME GOD THAT SPOKE TO THE WOMAN AT the well. IT'S THE SAME GOD THAT OPENED UP THE RED SEA. IT'S THE SAME GOD TONIGHT. AND I'M A WITNESS to it. IT'S THE SAME GOD &gt;&gt; that opens the eyes of a blind girl while I stood and looked at her from a few feet away. And the prophet of God said, "Satan, &gt;&gt; you cannot withstand this." &gt;&gt; And her eyes, which were just white, no pupils, and straightened out right in front of MY FACE. THAT'S THE SAME GOD. THAT'S MAYBE 50 years ago, BUT IT'S NOT THAT GOD that we're not looking back there. We're looking at right now, right here. And I'm saying to you that if you have it in your heart, you can put them to the test. I'm looking at two young women here standing here with you young people that were that were cursed with leukemia and God cursed the leukemia. &gt;&gt; Sister Amanda Snow, raise your hand to the glory of God. Raise it up high. &gt;&gt; That girl had leukemia. She's here tonight. That's our God. Sister Beth Dingwall, raise your hand. ABOUT SIX YEARS. SIX years of leukemia AND SATAN COULD NOT TAKE HER LIFE BECAUSE God wanted her to stand here tonight so you could see it. HALLELUJAH. AND HOW MANY here were BOUND BY SIN, BOUND BY DRUGS, BOUND BY FEAR, BOUND BY SUICIDE DEMONS, bound by every KIND OF ENEMY. AND SATAN, HIS POWER HAS BEEN BROKEN. &gt;&gt; This might be your moment. God does not intend that his people live under a cloud of fear. Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, it's not of God. &gt;&gt; Your life may not be right with God. I'm going to ask you. We're going to just sing the chorus once again. All things are I want to sing. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. And perhaps you are at that state where you are intent to do business for a specific thing. I'm talking about serious things. It might be a sickness, but it might I'm more concerned about spiritual things. Friends, I think that we should be done &gt;&gt; with some of these spiritual afflictions. &gt;&gt; It should end tonight. &gt;&gt; And if you're prepared to do business with God, I've asked Brother Ron to remain here. I know he's very weary. He preached hard. He preached God's word. And that power going through a person. But I asked them and the brothers are prepared to maybe put a chair here. If if you feel I don't want to hold, you know, the whole audience, but if you're prepared to do business with God and said, I got something and that has to be broken tonight and I've come to this moment and I'm done with playing I'm playing church. I'm done with playing religion. Hallelujah. I'm here to do business with God. AND IF YOU'RE AT THAT STATE, I'm just encouraging you. If you wish, you can do it right in your seat. You don't have to come forward, but if you want to come pass by here, perhaps you could come this way and pass by here. And brother Ron, you're not going to tell a story. You're not going to say, "Pray for this, pray for that." You already in your heart have made the decision. &gt;&gt; You don't need any more than a just a word or a phone call or or a touch. And brother Brandham talks about uh uh uh a point of contact. And this might be your point of contact. Think about some of you young people. I'm going to tell you after this service, you're either going to go and get yourself messed up proper or you're going to get delivered tonight. &gt;&gt; God, you can't play games with God. YOU CAN'T FOOL WITH GOD. GOD WILL not be mocked. WHAT YOU LIVED LAST WEEK WON'T WORK NEXT WEEK BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HEARD TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; You got a man here not only been do not only been healed from being burnt the way HE WAS. THERE'S A man that's been in uh been bound BY DRUGS AND GOD DELIVERED HIM. &gt;&gt; Like some OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE RAISED UP IN THE MESSAGE, YOU'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER and over and all the quotes and you could almost go to sleep on it. You could almost quote it YOURSELF BY HEART. THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; A QUICKENED THING. SAY, "TONIGHT'S MY NIGHT FOR OUR GOD, MY GOD." &gt;&gt; And we'll just sing that. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Lord, I believe. And if you're the one that's prepared to do business with God, you can make your way around and just pass by here. Let Brother Ron lay his hand on you. Brother Brandham prayed for hundreds and all he said was God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. And that is not an idol word. That is God bless you. &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE YOU THE ANSWER to your to your need. Amen. Will everyone pray? &gt;&gt; Will everyone believe what I'm speaking now? &gt;&gt; And I like you to believe. And if you're sitting right in your seat, receive it right there at this time. All right. Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; And if you want to walk by, that's fine. &gt;&gt; Just make your way here if you want him to pray with you. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe you mean business with God. Only come if you mean business with God. God's got to break that at this time. Everyone in prayerful, lift up your voice now. Lord, I believe. We're believing for this for these individuals. Believe. Oh, believe now as you come. And now, thank him as you leave. Thank him as you leave. The prophet of God said, "Now, thank him." You that are being prayed for, you thank him. Go with your hands in the air thanking him. Lord, I believe. Oh, Lord. I believe all things are possible. Let's be praying for these also. Will you please? Lord, I believe. Let's enter into the meeting now. Lord, I believe for these. I believe as brother Ron lays his hand on him. Lord, I believe. Go on rejoicing now. All things are possible. Oh Lord, I go thanking him. That's part of it. Go thanking him. Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, let us rejoice. Our God is on the scene. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. He's the same God. He's the same God that spoke to the woman at the well. Sing God who spoke to you. The woman at the well is the same God whose wonders too many to tell. &gt;&gt; All you in the line, you you come in prayer. Come in pray. Come focus on one thing. I'm here for one thing. I'm here to receive the answer. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the same God. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's the same God who is living. Don't miss your chance. Don't miss this opportunity now. Oh, God. Folks still speaking at the way, &gt;&gt; bringing deliverance and salvation. The same God's wonders to many to do the Savior. Go praising him now.

We've prayed earnestly that the cloud of the Holy Spirit will overshadow this campground. We didn't buy it for volleyball. That's fine. We didn't buy it for fun and games. That's fine. We didn't buy it to eat together, ALTHOUGH THAT'S FINE. WE BOUGHT IT THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT OF God come down into your into your rooms, into your cabins, and into this tent. HALLELUJAH. AND GET GLORY TO JESUS CHRIST. He's the worthy one. AND THERE'S NONE LIKE HIM. I want to give him praise. I JUST WANT HIM TO BE GLORIFIED. He's not glorified in playing church or just HAVING CHURCH. HE'S GLORIFIED WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD. HE'S GLORIFIED WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT BAPTIZES THOSE THAT ARE EMPTY. Who's empty tonight? WHO NEEDS TO BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST? RAISE YOUR HAND AND BE FILLED. Be ye filled with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Receive it from him. He's the baptizer. &gt;&gt; No man is a baptizer. He's a baptizer. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I'd like to sing. Behold, &gt;&gt; what manner of man is this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we put that on the screen, please? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Who stills the raging sea? Is the first verse. &gt;&gt; Behold, what manner of man is this? Who steals the raging sea? He heals the sick, the lame. Amen. And takes the blind to see. He opens all the prison doors and sets the captive free. Yes, he does. The dark line exists by the plan. &gt;&gt; Who is he? He's the Lord of glory. He is the great I am. The alpha and only God, the beginning and the end. His name is wonderful. The prince of peace is he. He's the everlasting father throughout all eternity. Behold what manner of man is this whose faith to the woman at the well. everlasting life I will give to you my man can tell and who surrenet behold what manner of man &gt;&gt; he's alive he's here he's more than a song of glory he is the great I am the alpha and omega God, the beginning and the end. And his name is wonderful. The prince of peace is he. He's the everlasting father. &gt;&gt; I want to have that verse. Behold, what manner of this who stands between God and man? Go on to sing that verse, please. His eyes are as a flame of fire. His fan is in his hand. John saw him in the seven churches as the sun in brilliancy. And the prophet of God saw him in this day in brilliancy. And that's our God. &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. That's our God. &gt;&gt; Let's make it personal. That's my God. right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus. Make love to him. Love him. &gt;&gt; This is real, friends. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the same God &gt;&gt; tonight. Man is pushed between God and his eyes as a flame of fire. His is in his hand. John saw him in the seven churches as a son in William Sea. Behold, what manner of man is this? This is who it is. He's the Lord of glory. He is great. I am the alpha and the beginning and the end. And his name is wonderful. The prince of Jesus. He's a everlasting father. &gt;&gt; Let's have all the sisters sing ahead. He's the Lord. All the sisters. Oh, give it up. Give it praise to him. &gt;&gt; We're worshiping him. Sisters are worshiping him. Now all the brothers worship him. is wonderful. He's the everlasting father. All right. Just before we sing it again now, how many here know someone perhaps even a young person that's not here tonight because their lips are stilled in death? How many know someone who's not here that raise your hand? You young people, you know some young people. &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. &gt;&gt; They're not here &gt;&gt; and they can't sing this song. &gt;&gt; And the psalmist David said, "The dead praise not God." &gt;&gt; They don't have that opportunity. YOU STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. &gt;&gt; How some WOULD LOVE TO SAY HIS NAME IS WONDERFUL. THE PRINCE OF PEACE THEY OFFER any &gt;&gt; and you can say it tonight. You can say &gt;&gt; one more chance &gt;&gt; and you haven't got any guarantee of tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; And if YOU DO HAVE TOMORROW MORNING WAKE UP SAYING HE'S WONDERFUL. All together now we're singing and brother Tom Ray will come and dismiss us of glory. He is the great I am. He's the alpha and only God. Receive our thanks. Receive our praise. Is wonderful. The prince of peace is he. Amazing everlasting father through God. All together once again the Lord of glory. He is the great I am. He has only the king and the end. His name is wonderful. He the everlasting father. One more time, Saint. For he's the Lord of glory. He is the great I am, the alpha and only God, the beginning and the end. His name is wonderful. The prince of peace is he. He's the everlasting father throughout eternity. Hallelujah. Praise him. Glory. The alpha, the omega, the beginning, the end. He's my God. Glory. &gt;&gt; How do you close a meeting like this? How do you close a meeting like this, saints, where the presence of God just comes wave after wave after wave after wave? &gt;&gt; I am so thankful I serve that God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful I'm with the PEOPLE THAT LOVE THAT GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't know what you saw tonight. I saw God. I'm sorry friends. I I've been in unveiling of God too long. &gt;&gt; Whatever he said. &gt;&gt; That's what I was taken on Sunday. Whatever he said. Is that true, sir? Whatever he said. &gt;&gt; But we think that's brother Biscll. He will take our camp meeting. Whatever he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Was that brother Biscll or was that God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; The veil is becoming very thin, saints. &gt;&gt; And I believe we're living at that hour &gt;&gt; where the fulfillment now of the prophecy of that word is coming to pass. &gt;&gt; The bride form, &gt;&gt; the word of God being manifested. &gt;&gt; You see, the thing of it is, if you don't mind me just taking one man more minute, Here's a a little bit of a window inside of the events that were spoken this evening if Joanne does not mind. When brother Biscll announced that to brother Ron that he will take this camp. I had a weward son and I couldn't have children and I've got a godly wife. We prayed and God gave us a son through a man of God who prayed and God told him his name shall be Joel. &gt;&gt; Now you say well how do you love I love the spirit of God that dwells within a man sir. &gt;&gt; And just like that woman that great woman of the scriptures I'll call my wife that great woman. And that son had died. Elisha had prayed and she got on a donkey. She got on a power and she went to that man of God and she said, "Dad, I'm going to approach you as a man of God. My son needs a resurrection." Brother Ron comes, Brother Ed has brother Ron come to this camp, preaches a message. Was that Brother Ron or was that God? &gt;&gt; And we experienced the resurrection. and two years. Here's brother Joel sitting here with his wife. I say he's a great God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. YOU MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE WEWARD, BUT YOU GET A HOLD OF A MAN OF GOD AND YOU TAKE THAT PROMISE AND YOU WATCH GOD MOVE ON the scene. &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF GOD? THAT'S MY GOD. SAINTS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; But I I know what that woman of God went through. The agony, the prayer, the word, the search, the waiting on God, it doesn't come on a platter. We wonder, why don't we have what we got? We need to be perseverant. We need to be PRESSING IN. &gt;&gt; SAY, "OH, GOD, GIVE ME MY CHILDREN." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CAMP'S ALL ABOUT. GIVE ME MY PROMISE. &gt;&gt; And you wonder why I love Brother Ron. Love his ministry. Love Brother Biscll. Love his ministry. All I've seen is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And what I'm seeing God being unveiled amongst us again. &gt;&gt; Come praying for them tomorrow night. This mighty God unveiled before us is moving amongst his children once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not only the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. &gt;&gt; The God of William Brham. He's my God and he's the lovely Lord Jesus Christ. May God bless you tonight and thank you heavenly father. These were wonderful words of life we heard tonight and we can say that that God has been raised out of history and he's alive living in me to tell. And so Lord, Brother Ron has poured out his strength. A man has given himself to the spirit of God. And we are thankful for the word of God that we heard tonight through the vessel. And so Lord, we want to tuck that deep within our hearts. We want to go our separate ways tonight and pray that the grace of God will overshadow us all. And Lord, let these words be ringing in our hearts tonight to know you're a personal God in an impersonal age. You are a God that is a very present help in time of trouble. And we're believing for everyone that passed through this line this evening. We're praying God that you have granted to them according to their desire. We pray Lord that you'll be glorified through all of our lives. go with each and every one of us now. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you richly. Those that have come on grounds, we thank you again for attending these services and making them what they are. And if you just be kind enough to make your way when you're finished here, you can stay here as long as you would like. But once you're finished in the tent, would you just mind making your way off the grounds and all the count uh counselors and campers and registered campers here on the grounds kitchen has something for you. It will be closed at 11:00, but if you choose to be here, that's just fine, too. We thank you for your kind attendance. God bless you. You're dismissed. Greet one another in Jesus name. God be with you. Amen. might be. I am so glad.
