[12:17] We want to remember brother Tony Atma is

[12:24] Brazil. And uh
[12:28] Sister Pat Drake is requesting prayer.
[12:31] Um
[12:34] for her dad, Sister Shauna's dad, uh Tom
[12:38] Miller, just wanted us to pray for his
[12:41] soul. I'm going to ask brother DJ to
[12:43] come this morning. Uh Tom Miller is some
[12:46] of you know, and uh he's uh just close
[12:50] to leaving this world and the family has
[12:53] just desired that we would pray for his
[12:54] soul. Amen.
[12:59] [Music]
[13:02] Just bow hearts and look to the Lord. If
[13:06] there be any need here, just make a
[13:08] known to him by lifting your hands.
[13:11] Father, we thank you this morning that
[13:13] we can come before you, Lord.
[13:16] Truly, our hearts are filled with love,
[13:19] a love that you have shed abroad.
[13:22] Lord, you have made it so easy for us to
[13:24] love you back
[13:27] when we look at what you have done,
[13:28] Father God, and the great sacrifice that
[13:32] you endure on our behalf, Father, and
[13:35] this great message of truth that you
[13:36] have brought in this hour, Father, to
[13:39] realize even this Sunday morning, many,
[13:41] oh God, are gathered to worship a God
[13:43] that they do not know. Father, they're
[13:45] still locked in darkness, but you have
[13:47] brought us out, oh God, into this great
[13:49] marvelous light. How thankful we are
[13:52] this morning to know that we stand
[13:54] before the presence of the living God.
[13:56] And know that by simply bowing our heads
[13:58] and closing our eyes, we do have an
[14:01] audience with you, Father God, to know
[14:03] that you have an attentive ear to every
[14:05] petition this morning. It give us such
[14:08] confidence, oh God, and such assurance
[14:10] to know that we can come boldly before
[14:13] the throne of grace this morning. It is
[14:15] a throne of grace for us, Father,
[14:17] because the blood has been shed for us
[14:19] from before the foundation of the world.
[14:22] When the lamb was slain in the mind of
[14:24] God, Father, we're so thankful for this
[14:26] free access. We come, oh God, thanking
[14:29] you for we know every need. We'll meet
[14:31] an answer before you, Father. If we come
[14:34] living, we can go rejoicing today. You
[14:37] know every need in our hearts this
[14:39] morning, Father. Would you just take
[14:41] your servant father, anoint him, oh God,
[14:43] and give him liberty to speak that which
[14:46] the spirit desired to say to the church
[14:48] this morning and give us a hear to hear,
[14:51] oh God, and the hearts to receive and
[14:53] faith to believe, Father, for the
[14:56] promises are unto your children today.
[14:58] For the needs that have been mentioned
[15:00] this morning, Father,
[15:02] this man Miller, oh God, we believe that
[15:05] you're more than able to save his soul.
[15:08] Father,
[15:09] &gt;&gt; even as the church of the living God
[15:11] pray and your children believe, Lord, I
[15:14] ask that in a supernatural way, you may
[15:16] intervene there, God, and that your hand
[15:19] of mercy can reach down to him, oh God,
[15:21] even when the bodies failing, may you
[15:23] save the soul and bring glory to your
[15:26] great name. We pray for our brother Tony
[15:28] and Sister Rebecca in Brazil, we ask
[15:31] that your hand be upon them. Would you
[15:33] take control of the meetings there? Let
[15:35] your presence be with them, Father, even
[15:37] as we believe you here with us this
[15:39] morning to minister the words to us.
[15:42] Take control of your servant and of your
[15:45] people as a committee is gathering to
[15:47] you in Jesus name. Amen.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[16:05] want to welcome all those who are
[16:06] visiting with us. We're happy to have
[16:08] you this morning and uh

[33:47] We want to have this testimony while we
[33:51] live out our lives. Each day that we
[33:54] love you, we want to serve you. We've
[33:56] come here, Lord, and now we have served
[33:58] you in worship. We want to serve you.
[34:01] Now, as the word comes,
[34:05] penetrate us.
[34:08] Loose, I pray, every bound person, not
[34:12] only present, but those in the invisible
[34:15] audience.
[34:16] Pray that Satan will be defeated today
[34:20] and that this will be a day of great joy
[34:23] when even angels will rejoice at the
[34:25] lost coming and the bound being
[34:27] delivered and your word going forth as a
[34:30] sharp two-edged sword. Let it do its
[34:34] work. We pray, oh God, we will stand
[34:37] merely as your humble servants to serve
[34:40] you in any way that is possible in Jesus
[34:43] Christ's name. Anoint us now speaker and
[34:48] hearers for your glory. Amen.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing while the choir
[34:54] take their seats. I love him. I love him
[34:56] because he first loved me. I
[35:02] love him.
[35:06] I
[35:09] love you
[35:13] because
[35:15] Jesus
[35:19] of me
[35:24] [Music]
[35:30] is my
[35:32] salvation
[35:39] on God.
[35:49] Just once again.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. We love you,
[35:57] Lord Jesus.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Love you.
[36:09] [Music]
[36:17] Oh God.
[36:19] [Music]
[36:35] Oh
[36:36] God.
[36:38] [Music]
[36:49] So happy that you're all here today and
[36:52] your presence is a strength.
[36:55] I'm sure the Lord is pleased that you're
[36:57] here as well and I trust before the
[37:00] service is over you'll be very happy
[37:02] that you're here.
[37:04] I'll invite you to turn with me in your
[37:06] Bibles to Revelation the 17th chapter. I
[37:10] want to get directly into the word so we
[37:14] can cover what's on our hearts, Lord
[37:16] willing.
[37:19] Some subjects are a lot easier than
[37:21] others to address. And this is not one
[37:25] of the easy ones. So you uh just pray
[37:29] that God will you know give you
[37:31] understanding give us all understanding
[37:34] uh in this scripture
[37:37] uh Revelation 17 I'm going to start to
[37:39] read at verse one.
[37:43] And there came one of the seven angels,
[37:46] which had the seven vials,
[37:49] and talked with me, saying unto me, Come
[37:52] hither, I will show unto thee the
[37:55] judgment of the great that siteth
[37:58] upon many waters, with whom the kings of
[38:01] the earth have committed fornication,
[38:05] and the inhabitants of the earth have
[38:08] been made drunk with the wine of her
[38:11] fornication.
[38:12] So he carried me away in the spirit into
[38:16] the wilderness. And I saw a woman sit
[38:19] upon a scarletcoled beast full of names
[38:23] of blasphemy,
[38:25] having seven heads and 10 horns. And the
[38:28] woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet
[38:31] color, and decked with gold and precious
[38:34] stones and pearls, having a golden cup
[38:38] in her hand, full of abomination
[38:41] and filthiness of her fornication.
[38:44] And upon her forehead was a name
[38:47] written, Mystery Babylon the Great, the
[38:51] mother of harlots and abominations of
[38:54] the earth. And I saw the woman drunken
[38:57] with the blood of the saints and with
[39:00] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And
[39:03] when I saw her, I wondered with great
[39:06] admiration.
[39:07] And the angel said unto me, Wherefore
[39:10] did thou marvel?
[39:12] I will tell thee the mystery of the
[39:15] woman, and of the beast that carried
[39:18] her, which hath the seven heads, and 10
[39:21] horns. The beast that thou sawest was
[39:26] and is not and shall ascend out of the
[39:29] bottomless pit and go into predition.
[39:32] And they that dwell on the earth shall
[39:35] wonder whose names were not written in
[39:38] the book of life from the foundation of
[39:40] the world. When they behold the beast
[39:44] that was and is not and yet is. The last
[39:50] phrase is the title of my message. The
[39:53] beast that was and is not and yet is.
[39:59] You may be seated.
[40:08] I'll need you to be fully focused
[40:12] and in full have full control of your
[40:16] thoughts. Try not to be distracted by
[40:19] any movement and let's not move any more
[40:21] than absolutely necessary.
[40:26] The beast that was and is not and yet is
[40:33] in the scripture and especially in the
[40:35] book of Revelation
[40:38] when we find the word beast and you that
[40:42] are in the message and follow it, you
[40:46] know that
[40:47] uh there are two references
[40:51] to the beast and it is not the same
[40:55] beast in each case. There's two
[40:58] different words
[41:00] in reference to
[41:02] using uh reference to a beast in the in
[41:06] the book of revelation.
[41:08] uh in uh chapter five you find that
[41:13] there's four we say living creatures
[41:16] that are around the throne and they are
[41:19] referred to as beasts
[41:21] uh and here we find beast the word beast
[41:24] and there we find it quite frequently
[41:27] I'm going to give you the meaning of the
[41:30] two the ones that are around the throne
[41:33] are are called a living being that is
[41:37] the Greek word. It is a living being. Uh
[41:40] to be alive.
[41:42] The reference to be alive, to live, to
[41:46] breathe,
[41:47] to be among the living, not lifeless,
[41:52] and not dead. That's those living
[41:54] creatures, which incidentally, brother
[41:57] Brandham said, they were four
[41:58] anointings. And they are they he links
[42:01] them right back. I don't want to take
[42:03] time with it this morning, but links it
[42:05] right back to Eden where cherubams were
[42:08] placed to protect the way of the tree of
[42:11] life. not to protect the tree of life,
[42:13] but to protect the way of the tree of
[42:15] life because Adam lost his sense of
[42:18] direction. And they were and then uh
[42:22] when when God began to call his people
[42:24] out of Egypt and the Hebrew children now
[42:29] become the children of Israel and they
[42:32] and then they established their ranks
[42:34] and their positions in the wilderness
[42:37] when the after the tabernacle was built
[42:41] because in the tabernacle was the word
[42:44] that's always the focus and around the
[42:47] tabernacle where the tribe tribes in
[42:50] their in four under four different
[42:52] insignities or under four different
[42:56] signs which was a lion uh a man, a calf
[43:01] or a beast, a calf and an eagle. Those
[43:05] were the four and they were sign they
[43:08] were around the tabernacle. And then
[43:12] when the word came in flesh, there were
[43:15] four that recorded the movements of the
[43:18] word in flesh, which was Matthew, Mark,
[43:22] Luke, and John. And then when John saw
[43:26] the heavens open and the lamb, there
[43:29] were these living creatures around them.
[43:32] And there were four horse riders which
[43:35] were uh which was Satan himself under
[43:38] four different disguises or four
[43:40] different masks and coming out into the
[43:43] earth to permeate and cover the earth
[43:47] with his evil influence. And those four
[43:50] living creatures representing an
[43:53] anointing that would come upon the
[43:55] believer, upon the elect. So we could
[43:58] more than counteract what Satan was
[44:00] bringing at that time. And so those four
[44:03] living creatures, that's why the word
[44:06] for the living creatures, beast, and the
[44:08] word for beast elsewhere have to be very
[44:11] very different. And the other beast
[44:14] which is referred to here in the 17th
[44:17] chapter which we read and other places
[44:19] in the scripture, it is a wild beast or
[44:25] venomous beast. That is why Esau was a
[44:28] wild man. Ishmamail was a wild man. Cain
[44:33] was a wild man. That traces all the way
[44:36] from Genesis straight through into uh
[44:39] into Revelation to the end time. We have
[44:41] those two spirits in the world. And this
[44:45] beast is not only wild uh untameable and
[44:50] venomous, but it is it comes from a uh
[44:54] the a further word which uh which
[44:57] constructs that word for the beast which
[45:00] is it it has reference to a trap
[45:04] uh a hunting of wild beasts to destroy.
[45:08] The purpose is to dis to destroy them
[45:11] and henceforth it figuratively speaking
[45:14] it is a preparation or a preparing of
[45:18] destruction of men. So this beast the
[45:22] intent is to destroy men and the very
[45:25] structure of the name is is it it
[45:29] conotmentates a a trap a snare to catch
[45:34] men. So, it's not, you know, a snare.
[45:37] For those of you that have a little bit
[45:39] of knowledge of it, I have uh fairly
[45:41] good knowledge of it, having come from
[45:43] the wilderness in the north and all the
[45:45] rest of it. When you set a snare, it is
[45:48] just a very thin wire. And the wire is
[45:52] is strong enough for the animal you
[45:54] intend to snare. And that snare is put
[45:57] on the path that that animal goes every
[46:02] day, usually to their food or to their
[46:05] drink or wherever it It's just in their
[46:08] natural uh everyday existence and
[46:12] they're just moving along like that
[46:13] going for their food going it's on a
[46:16] well well uh beaten path and the snare
[46:19] is put there and it's it's camouflaged
[46:22] so you can't see it at all till it's
[46:24] gone through it and has it around the
[46:26] neck and it and it and that's the end of
[46:28] it. It is set there and the purpose of
[46:30] setting the snare is to destroy. That's
[46:34] to take a life which is sad. But the
[46:37] purpose of the purpose that's behind
[46:39] this beast even the very uh uh makeup of
[46:44] the word is to snare to trap and it will
[46:49] it will catch men and humanity while
[46:52] they're in their normal activity of
[46:55] existence whether it's to live or to be
[46:59] entertained or just their natural
[47:02] existence they will be snared at that
[47:05] time and part of man. And the prophet
[47:08] tells us clearly and and you know it
[47:10] yourself well that man has an instinct
[47:14] to worship. He is not made like an
[47:18] animal in that has that has no instinct
[47:21] to worship. Man has an instinct to
[47:24] worship and this beast has laid his
[47:27] snare on that path.
[47:31] Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Man wants to worship and that is where
[47:37] he will ensnare them.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Now
[47:41] the prophet and I have a a lot of quotes
[47:44] today. So I know it's hard to follow
[47:47] when a person's just reading but if
[47:49] you'll bear with me.
[47:52] He said he's making reference to uh
[47:54] scripture that spoke of uh of kings,
[47:58] certain kings. And uh he said he he
[48:02] makes reference to this and I'll show it
[48:04] to you. He's talking about kings that
[48:06] which is fallen five kings. And if he
[48:09] said if you want uh if you want that on
[48:12] from history, he said I'll show it to
[48:14] you and one is and one's to come. Now he
[48:17] said now watch the beast. Now, the beast
[48:20] wasn't a king.
[48:23] He was one which is and which is not and
[48:28] yet is and is not. He yet he is and is
[48:33] not. What is it? He said it is a
[48:36] succession. It's succession of the
[48:39] pope's power,
[48:42] &gt;&gt; a beast ruling.
[48:45] And then he said when pagan Rome was
[48:48] converted to make papal Rome because at
[48:51] one time it was pagan it was just a
[48:54] brutal political power which was in the
[48:58] time when Jesus Christ was here in his
[49:00] first coming. But now it just changed
[49:03] its mask uh and uh when pagan Rome
[49:08] became married to the Christian church
[49:10] under Constantine and so on. Pagan Rome
[49:13] was converted. He said, "And then it
[49:15] became the papacy which they had a pope
[49:19] instead of a king. And the pope is the
[49:23] spiritual king. That's the reason he's
[49:27] crowned spiritual king. Claims to be the
[49:30] viker of Christ."
[49:33] And uh he's on a seat. Now, this throne,
[49:39] this seat is is actually a throne or
[49:42] it's assigned in the New Testament to
[49:45] kings. She was on a a a throne. She was
[49:50] enthroned, the scripture which we read.
[49:55] And uh
[49:58] I will show you unto you the judgment of
[50:02] the great that siteth upon many
[50:06] waters. And she is enthroned. Uh
[50:12] just going to look for for that
[50:14] scripture, but I won't take the time
[50:16] just now. We'll come to it perhaps. And
[50:19] she's assigned this uh uh this seat. It
[50:24] it refers to the word seat in the
[50:27] scriptures actually throne and it's a
[50:30] stately seat or a throne assigned to
[50:34] kings to kingly power or royalty
[50:39] and uh has reference to God as a
[50:42] governor of the world or to the Messiah
[50:46] referring to divine administration
[50:49] and hence divine power belonging to
[50:53] Christ. Now I said that just as a little
[50:57] brief background.
[50:59] I cannot help and you'll understand this
[51:02] statement now
[51:04] at the end of the service but I cannot
[51:07] help is my own words
[51:11] but feel that we have turned a corner
[51:15] &gt;&gt; or at least
[51:18] uh the direction that the world is
[51:21] moving
[51:23] &gt;&gt; has been put into a much sharper focus
[51:26] &gt;&gt; with the events of the last few days.
[51:30] And I speak of this the astonishing
[51:34] importance
[51:35] that the world has placed upon uh the
[51:38] death and funeral of the late pope Paul.
[51:45] There are some prophecies which were
[51:47] spoken by brother Brandham
[51:51] God's messenger
[51:53] that take on greater meaning and new
[51:57] dimension.
[51:59] as we see these events happen.
[52:03] some of the comments that were made
[52:06] and this is all an integral part of the
[52:08] service this morning.
[52:11] John Paul's funeral
[52:14] was also one of the most prestigious
[52:18] drawing presidents, kings, and religious
[52:22] leaders from all corners of the globe,
[52:26] including President Bush and his
[52:28] predecessors Bill Clinton and George HW
[52:32] Bush. Italy's Minister of the Interior
[52:36] said that 1.4 4 million managed to file
[52:40] past the Pope's body during the four
[52:43] days he lay in state after waiting in
[52:46] line for an average of 13 hours. Some
[52:49] were less, but some were much more. Some
[52:50] were up to 24 hours.
[52:54] Uh the NBC
[52:58] Chris Matthews commentator said from
[53:01] Rome, "If you're not here today,
[53:05] you're not part of the world scene."
[53:10] They said of the pope, "Gifted with a
[53:12] tremendous affinity for language and an
[53:16] engaging manner, this pope forever
[53:18] changed the image of what a pontiff
[53:21] should be and what the leader of the
[53:24] mother church can accomplish both
[53:26] spiritually and politically."
[53:29] and that John Paul strove to reconcile
[53:32] the church with other faiths and to heal
[53:35] the centuries old sism within
[53:38] Christianity itself by encouraging a
[53:41] strong ecumenical movement around the
[53:44] globe.
[53:47] heads of state from more than 70
[53:50] countries and five continents. An
[53:53] unprecedented collection of power for a
[53:57] papal funeral.
[53:59] In the second row, the first US
[54:02] president to attend a papal funeral,
[54:05] never before in history. George W. Bush
[54:08] sat with his wife Laura,
[54:11] Prime Minister Tony Blair,
[54:14] Prince Charles of Britain, President of
[54:17] Poland, President of Iran, President
[54:22] Mosha Katsav of Israel, all attended.
[54:27] Also present were four kings, six queens
[54:31] as well as the United Nations Secretary
[54:33] General Kofan.
[54:36] There were also representatives from all
[54:39] the world's major religions.
[54:43] They said that Arabs sat with their
[54:45] checkered
[54:47] uh headdress.
[54:50] Uh
[54:51] Jews were there with their keepa.
[54:56] Muslims.
[54:58] The only nation that was not officially
[55:02] represented was China.
[55:07] A head of state, a king, a president's
[55:11] my own words now.
[55:14] A head of state, a king, a president or
[55:19] prime minister
[55:20] represents their nation
[55:23] and its people in his or her actions.
[55:28] That is a scriptural principle. When the
[55:31] head of state of a nation is there, God
[55:35] has not considered every individual
[55:37] there, but nationally speaking, they
[55:41] have been represented at that site at
[55:45] that place.
[55:51] Now, just before I show you some slides
[55:54] and I will hold some there while I make
[55:57] some other comments.
[56:00] part of the last will and testament of
[56:04] this late pope.
[56:07] And I want you to hear this while some
[56:10] of it it's it's fine it's between
[56:16] you know him and his own conscience.
[56:18] However,
[56:20] I want you to and I'm trying to be
[56:22] selective with my words, but I would
[56:24] like as you hear just this short
[56:26] paragraph, which is just part of a very
[56:29] very long last will and testament, which
[56:31] I've read all of it,
[56:35] be rem be mindful now that these leaders
[56:39] are
[56:41] present before
[56:44] uh this powerful man who's deceased.
[56:49] and this is his last will and testament.
[56:52] So in a sense, I don't say that they're
[56:54] standing there in a full agreement
[56:58] necessarily,
[56:59] but the one that they're giving this
[57:01] honor to, this is what he is declaring.
[57:05] Now, they're the ones that have come
[57:08] from all all the nations of the world.
[57:12] They're the ones who've brought their
[57:14] delegations and all of their officials
[57:17] to be represented. They're the ones who
[57:21] want to be seen and want to be uh
[57:24] present at this historical moment. And
[57:27] this is the one they've come to honor
[57:30] who has said, "I am completely in your
[57:32] hands
[57:34] in the name of the holiest trinity."
[57:37] Amen.
[57:39] Keep watch because you do not know. It
[57:42] seems that he's speaking to himself in
[57:44] his will. Keep watch because you do not
[57:47] know which day when the Lord will come.
[57:51] These words remind me of the final call
[57:55] which will come. The moment that the
[57:58] Lord will choose. I desire to follow him
[58:02] and desire that all that is part of my
[58:05] earthly life shall prepare me for this
[58:07] moment.
[58:09] I do not know when it will come, but
[58:12] like all else, this moment too, I place
[58:16] in the hands of the mother of my master.
[58:21] In the same maternal hands, I place all
[58:25] those now he is placing everything into
[58:28] Mary's hands.
[58:31] In the same maternal hands I place all
[58:35] those with whom my life and vocation are
[58:39] bound.
[58:41] Into these hands I leave above all the
[58:45] church and also my nation and all
[58:49] humanity.
[58:51] Now don't tell me he hasn't taken a
[58:54] position.
[58:56] And the leaders of much of the earth's
[58:58] population were standing there giving
[59:02] acknowledgment to the man who spoke
[59:05] these words.
[59:09] When John saw
[59:12] her,
[59:15] he marveled.
[59:17] He wondered with admiration.
[59:20] And that's the only thing that the angel
[59:22] that was showing him picked up
[59:25] and said, "Well, why did you marvel?"
[59:29] And brother Brandham
[59:31] a little later on he makes some
[59:33] comments. It's in the second seal. He
[59:36] marveled because when he saw all this
[59:39] wealth and pomp and glory and majesty,
[59:45] he couldn't comprehend that that
[59:48] marvelous sight could be responsible for
[59:52] the blood of the martyrs.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why he said he he couldn't
[1:00:00] understand that. Why did you marvel? And
[1:00:03] that's that was his difficulty if we can
[1:00:07] put it that way.
[1:00:09] Now
[1:00:17] they wondered, he wondered at it.
[1:00:21] He marveled at it. And that is to have
[1:00:25] an admiration,
[1:00:29] to wonder at or to be held in
[1:00:32] admiration.
[1:00:34] And the scripture says that all who
[1:00:38] dwell on the earth shall wonder.
[1:00:44] Now,
[1:01:02] I'd like to show this first slide if I
[1:01:06] could, please.
[1:01:24] You could do it from up there. I can't.
[1:01:35] I might need Brother Darren. I don't
[1:01:36] know if you need you to help me.
[1:01:39] You got it. Okay. Could we dim the
[1:01:42] lights a we bit, please?
[1:01:52] Now remember
[1:01:54] in the second seal,
[1:01:57] brother Brandham refers to the 17th
[1:01:59] chapter
[1:02:01] of Revelation.
[1:02:03] Now he said everybody just try to open
[1:02:06] your heart and let the Holy Spirit teach
[1:02:08] you. There came unto me one of the seven
[1:02:11] angels which had the seven vials and
[1:02:13] taught to me saying come hither and I
[1:02:15] will show thee the judgment of the great
[1:02:18] that siteth upon many waters.
[1:02:22] what is that? It's a woman
[1:02:25] can't be a man. And what is the woman
[1:02:28] symbol in the church in the Bible church
[1:02:32] Christ bride and so forth it's a woman
[1:02:34] the church he said now the waters what
[1:02:37] does the waters mean watch here said
[1:02:40] unto me the waters which thou sawest
[1:02:42] where the sitth are people's
[1:02:46] multitudes
[1:02:48] and he said unto me the waters which
[1:02:50] thou sawest where the siteth are
[1:02:54] people's multitudes nations s and
[1:02:56] tongues. He said, "This church is ruling
[1:03:00] over the world,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; set upon many waters, with whom the
[1:03:06] kings
[1:03:08] of the earth have committed fornication,
[1:03:13] spiritual fornication
[1:03:16] is taking is taking her doctrine."
[1:03:20] Right.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And the inhabitants of the earth have
[1:03:25] been made drunk with the wine of her
[1:03:28] fornication.
[1:03:31] They've been made drunk. And he said,
[1:03:34] talk about a drunken bunch.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Drunken on the fornication,
[1:03:42] the stimulation of the wine of her
[1:03:46] fornication. and the world. I I feel uh
[1:03:52] very very
[1:03:54] moved in one sense and I would say I
[1:03:58] believe that the world I hope I have
[1:04:00] sufficient time this morning. I believe
[1:04:02] the world has turned a real corner
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; when not one, not two, but three US
[1:04:07] presidents
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; uh come
[1:04:14] and bow
[1:04:16] and kneel
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; and pray
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; in front of that corpse.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:04:24] it's not just them as individuals.
[1:04:27] They are what they are before God.
[1:04:31] And it's not just this corpse of this
[1:04:34] man. It's what he represents and what
[1:04:37] they represent. That's what God sees.
[1:04:41] What he represents and what they
[1:04:43] represent. He represents a prostitute
[1:04:46] church.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; He represents a mother of harlots.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And they have doctrine,
[1:04:56] denominational doctrine. Not one who can
[1:04:59] take the whole word of God
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; and therefore are drunken on that into
[1:05:06] the point if you know what an alcoholic
[1:05:08] is a drunken person you cannot make him
[1:05:12] realize his condition and you can't make
[1:05:15] these people realize their condition
[1:05:18] they will not accept it
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; will not acknowledge
[1:05:33] that to me
[1:05:35] is an astonishing picture
[1:05:38] and I can tell you one. It's one that
[1:05:40] God saw. You might as well see it.
[1:05:45] And John was made to behold it as well
[1:05:49] in some way, in some fashion. We're
[1:05:51] seeing it in one fashion. We're seeing
[1:05:53] it in one way, but he saw it in another
[1:05:56] way. And he marveled at all of this
[1:06:00] majesty,
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; all of this pump, all this amazing
[1:06:07] uh
[1:06:11] church. this woman,
[1:06:14] how could she ever be so cruel
[1:06:18] as to slay? Because you cannot in your
[1:06:21] mind even right now and people cannot
[1:06:23] accept that that is such a reality. But
[1:06:26] God has not forgotten that under those
[1:06:28] skirts is the blood of martyrs.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; The martyrs of Jesus Christ who died by
[1:06:34] the millions to stand for the truth. And
[1:06:37] the fact that they've been able to robe
[1:06:39] it and make it acceptable to the world
[1:06:41] has not changed God's mind.
[1:07:00] President
[1:07:02] Bush has said, "The Catholic Church has
[1:07:04] lost its shepherd. The world has lost a
[1:07:07] champion of human freedom, and a good,
[1:07:10] faithful servant of God has been called
[1:07:12] home."
[1:07:14] in his native Poland. That witness
[1:07:16] launched a democratic revolution that
[1:07:18] swept Eastern Europe and changed the
[1:07:21] course of history. Throughout the West,
[1:07:24] John Paul's witness reminded us of our
[1:07:26] obligation to build a culture of life in
[1:07:28] which the strong protect the weak. And
[1:07:31] during the Pope's final years, his
[1:07:33] witness was made even more powerful by
[1:07:35] his daily courage in the face of illness
[1:07:38] and great suffering. We will always
[1:07:40] remember the humble, wise, and fearless
[1:07:42] priest who became one of history's great
[1:07:45] moral leaders.
[1:07:47] Kofi Anan quite apart from his role as a
[1:07:50] spiritual guide to more than a billion
[1:07:53] men, women, and children, he was a
[1:07:54] tireless advocate of peace, a true
[1:07:57] pioneer in interfaith dialogue, and a
[1:08:00] strong force for critical self-
[1:08:01] evvaluation by the church itself.
[1:08:05] I offer my deepest condolences to
[1:08:08] Catholics and others around the world
[1:08:10] who were touched by his life and prayer
[1:08:12] and lifelong dedication
[1:08:14] to nonviolence and peace.
[1:08:18] Shimon Perez on behalf of Israel, John
[1:08:21] Paul embodied the best that is within
[1:08:24] all mankind as well as the commonness of
[1:08:28] humanity. His actions and statements
[1:08:32] transformed relations between the
[1:08:34] Catholic and Jewish faiths and made a
[1:08:37] funnal impact on the struggle against
[1:08:39] anti-semitism.
[1:08:42] I can assure you
[1:08:44] that this is moving right down the path
[1:08:48] of prophecy
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; and bringing together the people and
[1:08:57] making dialogue between all manner of
[1:09:01] interfaiths or the faith of the
[1:09:04] different religions is precisely his
[1:09:07] role.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he was called to do.
[1:09:14] But you would have never had a Jewish
[1:09:17] leader saying anything of this kind
[1:09:21] before now.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Tony Blair throughout. Now when they say
[1:09:27] Tony Blair, I don't see Tony Blair. I
[1:09:30] see the Philadelphiaian age.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I see the nation that sent people in the
[1:09:35] last age, sent missionaries all over the
[1:09:37] earth. When I see Tony Blair and the
[1:09:40] United Kingdom and I I think of India
[1:09:44] 150 years under England and uh all
[1:09:47] different nations within Africa under
[1:09:49] England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada
[1:09:53] and islands of the sea and on and on and
[1:09:55] on. This was this was the power that
[1:09:58] ruled the waves in the last age. And
[1:10:01] this was the power that this was the
[1:10:03] nation that spread English all over the
[1:10:05] world. And this was and God saw that
[1:10:08] they colonized much of the world. God
[1:10:11] saw that and he intended it to be that
[1:10:13] way. So that because he knew that the
[1:10:15] last messenger is going to come speaking
[1:10:17] not German, not some other language but
[1:10:20] English.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And everybody has a thirst for English.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; We can't change that. That's the way it
[1:10:28] was. That's the way it is. May not be
[1:10:31] your mother tongue, but that is the
[1:10:33] message. The message came in that
[1:10:35] language. And so here's a man throat uh
[1:10:38] speaking Tony Blair uh throughout a hard
[1:10:41] and often difficult life. He stood for
[1:10:43] social justice on the side of the
[1:10:46] oppressed whether as a young man facing
[1:10:48] the Nazi occupation in Poland or later
[1:10:50] in challenging the communist regime. He
[1:10:53] never wavered, never flinched in the
[1:10:55] struggle for what he thought was good
[1:10:57] and right.
[1:10:59] Archbishop of Canterbury, Pope Paul.
[1:11:02] John Paul was the leader of manifest
[1:11:04] holiness and a faithful and prayerful
[1:11:07] friend of the Anglican Church. There
[1:11:10] will be there will be time in the days
[1:11:12] ahead for the proper tributes to be
[1:11:14] paid. For now, we remember his life and
[1:11:16] ministry with thankfulness and hold the
[1:11:18] church that he led in our thoughts and
[1:11:21] prayers. Billy Graham, Pope John Paul
[1:11:25] was unquestionably the most influential
[1:11:27] voice for morality and peace in the
[1:11:30] world during the last hundred years.
[1:11:32] Where have we gone?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; His extraordinary gifts, his strong
[1:11:39] Catholic faith, and his experience of
[1:11:42] human tyranny uh and suffering in his
[1:11:45] native Poland all shaped him. And yet he
[1:11:47] was respected by men and women from
[1:11:49] every conceivable background across the
[1:11:52] world. His courage and perseverance in
[1:11:54] the face of advancing age and illness
[1:11:57] were an inspiration to millions
[1:11:59] including me.
[1:12:01] And this was the Palestinian leader. We
[1:12:04] will miss him as a distinguished
[1:12:06] religious figure who devoted his life to
[1:12:10] defending the values of peace, freedom,
[1:12:12] and equality. He defended the rights of
[1:12:15] Palestinians, their freedom and
[1:12:18] independence.
[1:12:23] This morning
[1:12:27] this morning
[1:12:29] I just received
[1:12:32] notice one was thank you brother
[1:12:34] Burkhart and other came from Temple
[1:12:36] Institute from Rabbi Richmond.
[1:12:39] Rabbi Richmond had been summoned to the
[1:12:42] security department
[1:12:45] that controls
[1:12:48] the Temple Mount.
[1:12:51] And in a news item, they said that two
[1:12:55] Temple Mount activists
[1:12:58] were given a behindthecenes look at the
[1:13:00] approach Israel's police and government
[1:13:03] is taking towards Jews who visit
[1:13:06] Judaism's holiest site. You have to
[1:13:08] realize all of this is happening right
[1:13:10] at this time. And I hope you're
[1:13:13] spiritual enough. I hope you've been in
[1:13:15] the message enough. I've hope you have
[1:13:17] absorbed enough to know that a prophet
[1:13:19] has declared that Israel's coming to
[1:13:23] Israel being called back. They heard a
[1:13:26] trumpet. The feast of the trumpets was
[1:13:28] to Israel. And the and the trumpet
[1:13:31] sounds to them is that urge within that
[1:13:34] call back not just to their own land but
[1:13:37] to establish their temple worship. They
[1:13:40] have that not not only an urge they have
[1:13:43] a compelling.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; We must do it. And now the government
[1:13:49] has taken a position and absolutely
[1:13:52] forbid them.
[1:13:55] In fact is they said that Rabbiheim
[1:13:59] Richmond of Jerusalem's Temple Institute
[1:14:03] was summoned to a meeting with Mr.
[1:14:05] Chiron Michael, an investigator of the
[1:14:09] office of the ombbudsman of Israel's
[1:14:12] Department of Public Security today in
[1:14:16] order to present complaints about the
[1:14:18] way Jewish visitors to the site are
[1:14:20] treated and it's quite lengthy, but this
[1:14:24] is exactly what has been declared. The
[1:14:27] Israeli government's message is clear.
[1:14:30] All Jews who are interested in the
[1:14:33] Temple Mount are considered to be
[1:14:35] dangerous and must be stopped at all
[1:14:39] costs.
[1:14:43] On the one hand, I just came back from
[1:14:46] seeing all these nations
[1:14:50] gather at Awitz
[1:14:54] in support of a people that have been
[1:14:56] liberated to go back to their country.
[1:14:59] Right?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; But those same nations that remain
[1:15:03] silent then are silent now when they
[1:15:07] want to reach the objective for which
[1:15:10] they even have a nation
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; so that we can worship. So we can have
[1:15:14] Can you believe that any person you can
[1:15:17] go up there and pray?
[1:15:19] Muslims can go there and pray. Arabs who
[1:15:22] never live there can go up there and
[1:15:24] pray. Buddhists can go up there and
[1:15:26] pray. But the Jews who went back there
[1:15:30] for the purpose of establishing a nation
[1:15:32] can't go there and pray. Absolutely
[1:15:34] forbidden to pray.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; They can go and walk around it but can't
[1:15:39] pray.
[1:15:40] Can you imagine how insane the
[1:15:43] government and the world has become? But
[1:15:46] the same ones while they could not
[1:15:49] support them to say we as the nations of
[1:15:53] the world and the United Nations say for
[1:15:55] the in the sake and in the honor of
[1:15:57] democracy, in the honor of of of a
[1:16:00] people that have been so uh persecuted,
[1:16:03] certainly they must be able to go to the
[1:16:06] site and pray. But rather than do that,
[1:16:08] they're in front of a beast system
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; in admiration.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Giving admiration
[1:16:20] and honor
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; to something to a system that has
[1:16:25] brutalized humanity for centuries.
[1:16:40] And I wondered,
[1:16:42] I wondered
[1:16:46] at her,
[1:16:48] to behold, and to look and to view
[1:16:51] attentively,
[1:16:53] to contemplate.
[1:16:56] I heard some say, "I was just in an
[1:16:58] airport and I just had an urge. I had to
[1:17:01] go. I had to fly to Rome to be there.
[1:17:04] Such such inspiration.
[1:17:10] The time may well come if other things
[1:17:13] that the prophet has said will take
[1:17:15] place.
[1:17:17] time may come when you too because of
[1:17:21] the stand that the message has taken and
[1:17:24] obviously the stand which we take and
[1:17:27] the messenger declared it, we declare
[1:17:29] it, the scripture declares it and if we
[1:17:31] give voice to it, you will not be the
[1:17:34] popular person on the street.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; You might as well forget it.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; You will not be the popular person on
[1:17:40] the street. if you wanted to be abused
[1:17:42] and perhaps to be roughed up and maybe
[1:17:45] even thrown in prison. Uh if I spoke
[1:17:47] these things in Peter St. Peter's
[1:17:49] Square, uh so named uh you can be sure
[1:17:53] that uh we we would have been handled
[1:17:55] very roughly.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And if you had some kind of an edict in
[1:18:02] the country that said you can no longer
[1:18:05] hear that tape, read that message or go
[1:18:08] to that place. If we had such a thing, I
[1:18:11] think that we should take the position
[1:18:14] that we ought to live as though we were
[1:18:17] banned from that
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and we want to get our hands on it so
[1:18:21] desperately. You are banned from going
[1:18:23] to the house of God. You cannot worship
[1:18:26] around the doctrine that you believe any
[1:18:29] longer. You would be so intent on
[1:18:32] getting there. I must see their face. I
[1:18:34] must shake their hand. I must say, God
[1:18:36] bless you at all cost. That's what you
[1:18:39] would want to do.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I can tell you that's the way they feel
[1:18:42] in China right now.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And when I saw her, I wondered with
[1:18:51] great admiration. John says
[1:18:56] he wondered with great admiration. And
[1:18:58] brother Brandham goes on to say, she was
[1:19:01] such a beautiful thing with crosses and
[1:19:04] everything on her. How in the world
[1:19:07] could she be guilty of drinking the
[1:19:09] blood of saints? It puzzled him.
[1:19:13] And now he's going to tell him.
[1:19:17] In the tyrant church age, brother Graham
[1:19:21] takes a scripture and one that's been
[1:19:23] very very much on my mind in this
[1:19:26] morning's service.
[1:19:28] Who is able to make war with the beast?
[1:19:36] tell you there was a lot of power
[1:19:39] represented in that room
[1:19:43] and none of them offensive.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; None of them
[1:19:48] offensive
[1:19:50] to what that system does
[1:19:53] or has done.
[1:20:01] said, "Now there are present some great
[1:20:03] names in the world." Brother Brandham
[1:20:05] says
[1:20:07] there are some mighty nations, but right
[1:20:10] now Rome is calling the tomb.
[1:20:14] This is a n wrote 1960.
[1:20:22] The pope is in the driver's seat and his
[1:20:25] power is going to hear the prophecy. His
[1:20:30] power, remember now when this messenger
[1:20:33] was declaring this on the soil of
[1:20:35] America, there had never been a
[1:20:38] president to attend a pope's funeral.
[1:20:43] But he was saying and his power is going
[1:20:46] to increase and no one can war against
[1:20:50] him.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Listen this prophecy. The false groups
[1:21:01] will come together
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; in a world council of churches. And this
[1:21:09] world council of churches is the image
[1:21:12] to the beast.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; It wasn't when he said it, but he said
[1:21:16] it will come that way. It will be that
[1:21:19] way. And I want to announce to you, you
[1:21:21] have arrived.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; You're there.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; It's already happened. And here's one
[1:21:30] man, one voice in the midst of a
[1:21:33] multitude of voices
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; declaring something that sounded
[1:21:38] impossible.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; I have here also in my notes I have uh
[1:21:48] the first meeting of the World Council
[1:21:51] of Churches.
[1:21:53] World Council of Churches International
[1:21:55] organization
[1:21:57] that aims to bring together Christians.
[1:22:00] Now, this is not the Pope. This is not
[1:22:02] from the Vatican.
[1:22:05] They're not even represented.
[1:22:08] They only sent a represent
[1:22:10] representative to one of the later
[1:22:12] meetings. I don't know the first one as
[1:22:14] a observer.
[1:22:16] Observer in the full sense of the word.
[1:22:20] The World Council of Churches,
[1:22:22] international organization that aims to
[1:22:24] bring together Christians of different
[1:22:26] denominations, established in 1948,
[1:22:31] which incidentally was the was the same
[1:22:33] year that Billy Graham's ministry went
[1:22:35] out to the world, the same year, not the
[1:22:38] same year that the angel of the Lord
[1:22:40] came to brother Brandham, but the when
[1:22:42] his ministry really went worldwide, and
[1:22:45] that was a uh the a restoration of the
[1:22:48] of the gift, a revival that broke out at
[1:22:50] that time in 1948. Uh, Israel is
[1:22:54] recognized by the world body
[1:22:58] and it it it has a membership of more
[1:23:00] than 100 countries and more than 300
[1:23:04] churches which is nothing now including
[1:23:08] the Orthodox,
[1:23:10] Anglican and Methodist churches.
[1:23:13] That's where they started.
[1:23:16] Orthodox,
[1:23:17] Anglican, and Methodist. You ought to
[1:23:20] see the you ought to see the uh
[1:23:23] directory now
[1:23:26] because not because they thought it was
[1:23:28] a good idea, but because the word of God
[1:23:31] in the mouth of a prophet said they will
[1:23:33] come together under this headship.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And he said further that the that the
[1:23:38] Roman church will uh uh will suggest
[1:23:42] that they should get together for
[1:23:43] fellowship and for dialogue. And they
[1:23:46] have done so. And it happened right in
[1:23:48] our city. This is the first time in
[1:23:50] history that they took communion
[1:23:52] together. It happened in Vancouver.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; So that's where they started.
[1:24:02] But they will come together.
[1:24:06] And furthermore, uh, thus sayeth the
[1:24:09] Lord, that
[1:24:11] system of the World Council of Churches
[1:24:14] is the image erected to the beast.
[1:24:23] And I beheld another beast.
[1:24:26] If you want to turn to it, let's turn to
[1:24:28] Revelation the 13th chapter, starting at
[1:24:31] verse 11.
[1:24:43] And I beheld another beast
[1:24:46] coming up out of the earth, and had two
[1:24:48] horns
[1:24:50] like a lamb, and he spake like a dragon,
[1:24:52] as a dragon. And he exercisth all the
[1:24:55] power of the first beast before him, and
[1:24:58] causeth the earth, and them which dwell
[1:25:00] therein, to worship the first beast,
[1:25:03] whose deadly wound was healed. And he
[1:25:06] doeth great wonders, so that he maketh
[1:25:09] fire to come down come down from heaven
[1:25:11] on the earth in the sight of men, and
[1:25:14] deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
[1:25:16] by the means of those miracles which he
[1:25:19] had power to do in the sight of the
[1:25:21] beast, saying to them that dwell on the
[1:25:24] earth, that they should make an image to
[1:25:26] the beast, which had the wound had the
[1:25:29] wound by a sword, had the wound by a
[1:25:33] sword, and did live. And he had power to
[1:25:35] give life under the image of the beast,
[1:25:38] that the image of the beast should
[1:25:41] should both speak, and cause that as
[1:25:43] many as would not worship the image of
[1:25:46] the beast should be killed. And he
[1:25:48] causes all, both small and great, rich
[1:25:51] and poor, free and bond, to receive a
[1:25:54] mark in their right hand or in their
[1:25:56] foreheads.
[1:25:58] and no one might buy or sell save he
[1:26:01] that had the mark or the name of the
[1:26:03] beast or the number of his name. Here is
[1:26:07] wisdom. Let him that hath understanding
[1:26:09] count the number of the beast for it is
[1:26:11] the number of a man and his number is
[1:26:14] 600 three score and six or 666
[1:26:20] in the church ages. Now in the resume of
[1:26:23] the ages, do you mind if I read?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Are you following me? All right.
[1:26:31] Says,
[1:26:33] "Now remember it was imperial pagan Rome
[1:26:38] that fell by the sword." It's why the
[1:26:41] scripture says he was wounded by the
[1:26:42] sword. I'm giving you
[1:26:46] what brother Brandham said concerning
[1:26:47] that. That's why you need your full
[1:26:49] focus
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; because you'll find a word in the quote
[1:26:52] that goes back to the scripture. It was
[1:26:55] imperial pagan Rome that was that was
[1:26:58] here when Jesus was here. That Rome was
[1:27:02] felled by the sword. But she was healed
[1:27:06] of her death stroke when she joined to
[1:27:11] the nominal church of Rome and
[1:27:14] incorporated paganism and Christianity
[1:27:18] and thereby became the Holy Roman
[1:27:21] Empire.
[1:27:23] Now
[1:27:25] if you even look at the ceremony, if you
[1:27:27] look at the ceremonial aspect of this
[1:27:31] church, which is so foreign,
[1:27:36] I'll tell you what,
[1:27:40] if we had the body of William Brandham
[1:27:42] here
[1:27:45] and you came forward and knelt
[1:27:48] at a little rostroom,
[1:27:51] they'd blast that out and every
[1:27:52] newspaper in the country, this world
[1:27:54] council of churches and every church and
[1:27:56] every Pentecostal church and every
[1:27:58] Baptist church and everybody else would
[1:28:00] call you a bunch of fanatics. You
[1:28:02] heretics, you cultists
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; and yet they do it.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Their leaders do it.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Their whole nations are represented
[1:28:12] there.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And it's and to even to say a word
[1:28:16] against it would be, you know, what kind
[1:28:18] of bigot are you?
[1:28:21] I say what's good for the goose is good
[1:28:23] for the gander.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; But they don't want the same equal
[1:28:27] thing.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; They would blast you right out of
[1:28:30] everybody all over this country. All
[1:28:32] over this country. They would call you
[1:28:34] and probably have a reason to do so. And
[1:28:36] that is why I say those pictures up
[1:28:38] there to me are are ashamed.
[1:28:46] We've turned a corner
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and God has seen where we are.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; People are critics of this message say,
[1:28:58] "Well, we heard that he there was people
[1:29:01] down there that thought he might raise
[1:29:03] from the dead." So what?
[1:29:10] What's wrong with that? I hope if I I
[1:29:12] hope if if there ever day comes that my
[1:29:15] coffin is here that you folks might say,
[1:29:17] "Praise God, he might come out of that
[1:29:19] thing."
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Do we believe it or we don't believe it?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:36] and it became
[1:29:39] pagan. They borrowed from they borrowed
[1:29:42] from the Levitical priesthood and taken
[1:29:46] robes,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; but they've glamorized them and
[1:29:49] glorified them and and waving the sensor
[1:29:52] and all of it. It's it's it's things
[1:29:54] that they've borrowed from the Old
[1:29:56] Testament
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; and then they've invented things that
[1:29:59] aren't in the scripture at all.
[1:30:01] Multitudes. Millions and millions of
[1:30:04] candles. I wish they had fed some people
[1:30:06] for the millions of dollars. Can you
[1:30:08] imagine what this thing cost?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Where do you have a candle being lit in
[1:30:14] the scripture?
[1:30:16] [Music]
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Where do you have that?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; And I put all humanity in the hands of
[1:30:24] the maternal mother.
[1:30:27] And there's Protestants
[1:30:30] who are supposed to deny such a thing.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You talk about a not only a fallacy, you
[1:30:36] talk about a cult, that's a cult.
[1:30:41] They say a cult is following a man, but
[1:30:43] that church is following a woman.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; A woman who had to go to the upper room,
[1:30:49] a woman who had to get the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:53] That's right.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; And they've borrowed and taken all kinds
[1:30:56] of superstitions and bring things and
[1:30:58] made a man a viker of Christ on earth. I
[1:31:02] ask, what a what an imbecillic thing to
[1:31:05] do. If indeed you believed he was a
[1:31:07] viker of Christ, why pray for his soul
[1:31:09] after he's gone?
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Why offer prayers?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Does he need prayers?
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; For what?
[1:31:20] Is he in purgatory or where is he? Why
[1:31:23] pray? I say their own actions deny their
[1:31:27] belief.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; This Roman Empire,
[1:31:42] Holy Roman pagan empire,
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; that still has the all the all the
[1:31:49] cruelty of the red horse head, red horse
[1:31:54] and all the darkness of the black horse
[1:31:57] and all that which they the deception of
[1:32:01] the white horse, the deception, the
[1:32:03] cruelty and the darkness are all wrapped
[1:32:06] together to make the pale horse. And
[1:32:09] finally, she becomes identified in the
[1:32:11] end time because the prophet comes out
[1:32:13] and declares in the face of it, it's
[1:32:15] death.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; The rider's death.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; And some in the Protestant system say
[1:32:23] that horse rider, it was the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And you have a messenger come and say
[1:32:28] it's not the Holy Ghost, it's Satan.
[1:32:32] Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He said in the Holy Roman Empire which
[1:32:40] was to endure until Jesus came and
[1:32:43] destroyed her. It will endure until
[1:32:46] Jesus comes and destroys it. But Rome is
[1:32:49] not going it alone. Her daughters are
[1:32:52] right with her and she will take over
[1:32:56] absolute authority by the World Council
[1:33:00] of Churches. And that is what we are
[1:33:03] viewing now. That's what your newspapers
[1:33:06] are stuffed with. That's what the Time
[1:33:07] and the rest of magazines will have. But
[1:33:10] for the believer, you see it so you
[1:33:12] don't have to marvel anymore.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; You're not filled with amazement. You're
[1:33:18] not viewing it with admiration. You're
[1:33:21] viewing it in truth.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And you see exactly what it is.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:33:36] It's an incredible thing.
[1:33:39] And he goes on to say,
[1:33:43] "This may seem far-fetched
[1:33:45] to some, but actually it is very plain
[1:33:48] for all to see because right now the
[1:33:51] churches, the churches are controlling
[1:33:54] politics.
[1:34:02] and at the opportune time will manifest
[1:34:05] exactly how great is that control. This
[1:34:09] ecumenical move will end up with Rome at
[1:34:13] the head. Even though the people did not
[1:34:16] envision it that way in 1948, there's
[1:34:19] nothing said about Rome. They're not a
[1:34:22] member. They're not even an observer.
[1:34:24] But and they didn't envision it that
[1:34:26] way. But in the end, it will be that way
[1:34:30] because it has been spoken, thus saith
[1:34:33] the Lord. This wasn't just a Kentucky
[1:34:36] hillbelly out of Kentucky that went to
[1:34:38] the seventh grade, my brother, my
[1:34:40] sister. This is a vessel tapped into the
[1:34:43] wisdom of almighty God that is declaring
[1:34:46] this for us.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:53] may seem far-fetched
[1:34:56] and I can preach this. I can shout it
[1:34:59] out because I remember in my lifetime
[1:35:03] when I still believe these things and it
[1:35:05] was so far from reality. I've had I've
[1:35:09] had Lutheran say to me, you know, the
[1:35:12] World Council of Churches, uh, the
[1:35:14] moment they join that, I'm out of here.
[1:35:16] I'm history.
[1:35:19] It joined. They joined, but they didn't
[1:35:21] make it history. They stayed right
[1:35:23] there, bound bound to the daughter,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; bound to their mom whose mother was a
[1:35:29] prostitute.
[1:35:36] He said this is so
[1:35:39] because in Revelation 17 3-6 which was
[1:35:43] part of our text it states that the
[1:35:45] mystery Babylon is seated on the
[1:35:49] beast. She is controlling she is
[1:35:52] controlling the last or fourth empire.
[1:35:57] This Roman church is doing that and with
[1:36:00] the world church system. Now notice the
[1:36:03] woman
[1:36:05] that John saw was sitting on a beast.
[1:36:09] The beast was her power. The beast is
[1:36:12] always a power. So he saw this woman,
[1:36:17] the church, but she had a system. And
[1:36:20] the system was the beast. And he says so
[1:36:23] very clear. He said that this Roman
[1:36:26] church is doing that. The church as we
[1:36:28] know as the Roman church. He said with
[1:36:31] the world with with the world church
[1:36:35] system under her Rome will be
[1:36:39] controlling. So she's taking and
[1:36:41] gathering up the church system because
[1:36:44] that is her power to deliver her or take
[1:36:48] her to her goal and her objective.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding it? And John saw
[1:36:56] that and a prophet comes in this age to
[1:36:59] show us, to open it, to expose it to us.
[1:37:02] And I hope that I'm being a a wee bit of
[1:37:04] an echo this morning to make it even a
[1:37:07] greater reality to you. And some of you
[1:37:09] young people have never read it. You
[1:37:10] need to get in there and read it. Read
[1:37:12] the resume of the church ages. Read the
[1:37:15] seals and you'll find out how the the
[1:37:17] prophet of this day exposed that system
[1:37:21] and exposed what was going to happen and
[1:37:24] declared it in the simplest language.
[1:37:26] Nobody needs to miss it. He declared
[1:37:29] this is the way it's going to be. She's
[1:37:31] going to take control. And I'll tell you
[1:37:33] what, friends, this last week has real
[1:37:36] openly made it very clear. Anybody that
[1:37:39] anybody that misses it now, I say is
[1:37:41] blind, blind, blind. I say what is it? I
[1:37:46] I said it's a darkness, gross darkness
[1:37:50] has come upon the people that they can
[1:37:52] look at that and somehow feel that that
[1:37:55] the right kind of thing, the right kind
[1:37:57] of respect, the right kind of whatever
[1:37:59] and to disguise it into a a a funeral
[1:38:03] type of ceremony and call peoples of the
[1:38:07] earth
[1:38:08] in front of that uh body of a man.
[1:38:13] Now I tell you, he has much to answer
[1:38:14] for.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says clearly, a nun
[1:38:22] does not go into the nunnery to be a bad
[1:38:24] a priest does not go into the priesthood
[1:38:27] to be a bad person. This pope did not
[1:38:29] come into the priesthood to be a bad
[1:38:31] person. It's the system
[1:38:34] that corrupts them because the system
[1:38:38] has been developed over all of these
[1:38:40] centuries and they have adopted creeds.
[1:38:43] They've adopted traditions. They've
[1:38:46] taken in the doctrine of devils.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Which is the seed.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That's the seed. A doctrine is a seed.
[1:38:56] And when you receive a seed, you bring
[1:38:57] forth that kind. Eve received a seed of
[1:39:01] a serpent and brought forth a cane.
[1:39:05] And no wonder Cain.
[1:39:08] Can you imagine? I can understand
[1:39:12] if you sit and listen to me
[1:39:15] and reject it.
[1:39:18] I could understand if you listen to the
[1:39:21] best minister in this message and
[1:39:24] rejected it.
[1:39:27] I could perhaps understand because it's
[1:39:29] written that you could listen to Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ. You said, "Oh, no, not Jesus.
[1:39:36] I could understand if you did cuz
[1:39:38] there's many that did."
[1:39:41] But Cain
[1:39:43] is the only human I know that had God
[1:39:47] come and preach him a sermon. Right.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; God preached Cain a sermon
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; and Cain turned it down.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; How do you turn the creator of the
[1:39:59] universe down? Goes to show if you're
[1:40:02] not birthed of the living seed of God.
[1:40:04] You can't see it.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Might say, "Well, what about
[1:40:09] predestination? I God's God and he
[1:40:12] couldn't accept it. He couldn't receive
[1:40:14] it for he was of the wrong seed."
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:19] You might say, "Do how do I know if I'm
[1:40:20] of the right seed?" What are you doing?
[1:40:23] Are you receiving it? Are you setting it
[1:40:25] off as unimportant? If you receive it
[1:40:27] and say, "That's my life. That's my
[1:40:29] breath."
[1:40:31] Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] The right seed. It lives off this word.
[1:40:36] The right seed.
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That's why when that seed, that light
[1:40:43] struck the seed, something happened.
[1:40:47] And if nothing happens, I'd call on God
[1:40:49] with everything was in me.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "What would happen if you
[1:40:55] didn't feel as though you're the right
[1:40:56] seed?" I'd live for him anyway.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I'd live for him anyway.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't the chance I could be pulled out
[1:41:05] of the flames of hell and receive a
[1:41:07] better judgment. I'd live for him
[1:41:08] anyway.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Only a fool says in his heart there's no
[1:41:13] God.
[1:41:20] The beast is the world church system.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; His tracks are all around us.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; His tracks are in your city, in your
[1:41:31] community. The tracks of this world
[1:41:34] church system that give themselves
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; to this beast or are the beast for this
[1:41:43] power. Rome is riding to her destiny
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; on this power.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many declared, "Oh, we're not
[1:41:53] part of it. We're not part of it." But
[1:41:56] their leaders have succumbed
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; to it.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And they can't withstand this kind of
[1:42:03] magnificence,
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; the power of her, the richness of her. I
[1:42:08] looked at some of the people on my
[1:42:09] computer and they weren't even as high
[1:42:12] as as as the base of the pillars.
[1:42:15] Those pillars were raised up when it's
[1:42:18] all that gold
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; and all this royalty and how it was
[1:42:24] decked out. Is nobody going to stand up
[1:42:27] and say you're a corrupted, filthy
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; harlot church.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; But you need to see it. the way God sees
[1:42:38] it.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; And there is no other way to see it.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; She had a cup and even it was gold
[1:42:46] of her of the wine of her fornication.
[1:42:50] People were so enamored and they were so
[1:42:52] gripped and so taken by all of this
[1:42:55] doctrine and and the wine of her
[1:42:58] fornication, which is her doctrines. And
[1:43:01] people were intoxicated with it.
[1:43:05] Right.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Thus he said all the people have to
[1:43:10] belong to the world church system
[1:43:13] or be at the mercy of the elements for
[1:43:16] they cannot buy or sell without the mark
[1:43:19] of the beast in their head or hand with
[1:43:22] their intelligence or their or their
[1:43:23] fellowship.
[1:43:25] This mark in the head means that they
[1:43:27] will have to take the doctrine
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; of the world church system which is
[1:43:32] trinitarianism.
[1:43:35] as his opening words in his will.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Holy Trinity,
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; in the name of something that doesn't
[1:43:42] exist,
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; in the name of something that they
[1:43:49] themselves invented,
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; and I also read of the history of how it
[1:43:54] had its beginnings, the Trinity,
[1:43:58] and it definitely happened in the 300.
[1:44:01] And there was uh 325
[1:44:05] and just beyond that when some of the
[1:44:08] theologians
[1:44:09] Tertullian was one
[1:44:12] and two others and they had definite
[1:44:16] thoughts on it. He says and the mark of
[1:44:18] the hand means they will do the will of
[1:44:20] the world church. They will do it and
[1:44:24] with this great power the church system
[1:44:26] will persecute the true bride.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; That's what we're in for. And if it
[1:44:31] happens, you may lose your job. They may
[1:44:33] tighten up. They may say, "Well, you go
[1:44:35] to that church." Yeah, but we haven't
[1:44:38] knelt before a dead carcass yet.
[1:44:41] I throw it right back in their face.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; I had a man who turned against this
[1:44:47] message.
[1:44:48] I led him to Christ. At least I thought
[1:44:51] I was when he was 28. I couldn't even
[1:44:54] recognize who he was yesterday. and he
[1:44:58] might be here. But right away the
[1:45:01] serpent seat bothers him. Said, "We're
[1:45:03] in the image of God." And I just turned
[1:45:05] my hand around to all the people walking
[1:45:08] around there and White Rocket says,
[1:45:10] "This is the image of God." Said, "Don't
[1:45:12] disgrace my God.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Don't insult my God. It's not the image
[1:45:17] of God.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; This has come out of the serpent seed.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; God doesn't act like this. God doesn't
[1:45:26] look like this.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want to make an issue of it.
[1:45:32] Tell you what, Baptist is say whosoever
[1:45:34] will. That's exactly right. But they
[1:45:36] won't
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; and they don't want it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Church, you hear me?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; The image will try to keep the bride
[1:45:50] from preaching and teaching. It's
[1:45:52] already doing it.
[1:45:54] already done everything.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Thought we'd disappear.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Thought we were a bad dream.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Somehow close my eyes and when I open
[1:46:05] them, you'll be gone.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; When they open them, there was more
[1:46:09] fanatics.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; There's more who believed it.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And we're further down the road than we
[1:46:15] were yesterday or last week. I say
[1:46:19] hallelujah to God. God by the Holy
[1:46:22] Spirit is opening up his word and we
[1:46:25] believe those things that have been laid
[1:46:26] here in the prophet's message. I'll tell
[1:46:29] you what you might say. I say prophet
[1:46:31] too much. You need to get into it. You
[1:46:33] need to hear what he said. You need to
[1:46:35] you need to take those lines and find
[1:46:37] out and discover.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; This wasn't some light stuff. This isn't
[1:46:43] fluff.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; This is meat and substance.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; This will give you strength. Nothing
[1:46:50] else will give you strength
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; to withstand the spirit in this day and
[1:46:55] age.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; If Satan could, if he was able to, he'd
[1:46:59] even take us of the message and soften
[1:47:01] our approach and soften our our feeling
[1:47:04] to it. You know, all mankind is good and
[1:47:06] so on. We're not talking about mankind.
[1:47:08] We're talking about the system that man
[1:47:10] subjects himself to.
[1:47:22] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[1:47:24] comfort and truth to the people who need
[1:47:26] it.
[1:47:28] But before the antichrist in person
[1:47:31] takes over this complete world system of
[1:47:33] churches, the true church will be taken
[1:47:36] away from this world to be with the
[1:47:38] Lord. And I also believe that.
[1:47:42] I believe that.
[1:47:44] Looking forward to that.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; God will catch away his bride for the
[1:47:54] great marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:47:57] The prophecy. Here's a prophecy. The
[1:48:00] United States
[1:48:03] will come to a time that church and
[1:48:07] state will unite together. I'd say the
[1:48:11] United States came closer to that. this
[1:48:14] last weekend than she ever has in her
[1:48:16] 200 plus years of existence. Wake up, my
[1:48:19] dear friend. Wake up. You're closer to
[1:48:22] it than you ever thought before.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; There's no nation.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Our prime minister was there. No
[1:48:30] surprise he is Catholic.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You can well believe that they will
[1:48:34] certainly support and do everything they
[1:48:36] can for that cause.
[1:48:44] in the mark of the beast
[1:48:49] 36
[1:48:51] years
[1:48:53] before it happened.
[1:48:56] The United States will come to a time
[1:49:00] will not might
[1:49:04] come to a time that church and state
[1:49:08] will unite together and Protestant and
[1:49:13] Catholic will throw their things
[1:49:17] together to fight communist.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Where'd you ever hear that?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; It happened.
[1:49:26] And you people except for the smallest
[1:49:28] and youngest of you all live to see that
[1:49:31] this pulp with his power and America
[1:49:34] with her power united together to bring
[1:49:36] it down.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I say that prophecy of 36 years ago
[1:49:40] happened exactly as he said it.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; I don't care what church you come out
[1:49:48] of, you never had a prophecy like that.
[1:49:49] You never heard another preacher say it.
[1:49:51] You people out of the callings, you
[1:49:53] never heard it that way.
[1:49:55] You never heard it that way. Out of
[1:49:57] Pentecost, you never heard it that way.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; You Catholics, you never heard it that
[1:50:01] way. But here come one out of the
[1:50:03] wilderness.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; this nation will
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; unite
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; with the state and church.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Unthinkable
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; 36 years ago.
[1:50:22] absolutely unthinkable.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; That is the most heretical kind of
[1:50:28] statement you could imagine.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; America,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; fundamental Bible belt
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; with all of her uh uh all of her
[1:50:39] preachers and and wide open on the radio
[1:50:42] and televisions and televangelists and
[1:50:44] all this things going to unite church
[1:50:46] and state. I tell you what, the highest
[1:50:48] office and three of the presidents of
[1:50:51] the most powerful nation on earth bowing
[1:50:54] and kneeling at a rostrm with their
[1:50:57] hands and their mouth moving in prayer
[1:51:00] was anonymous sign to me
[1:51:04] and left me feeling with a very
[1:51:06] quivering
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; inner being
[1:51:11] at the time that we're in.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; And I hope you're quivering before this
[1:51:15] service is over.
[1:51:18] And don't be taken up with all the
[1:51:22] little things that would consume you.
[1:51:24] Keep your eye on the goal.
[1:51:27] Keep your eye and focus on what the
[1:51:30] message is really bringing to you.
[1:51:41] And he says the Protestants and Catholic
[1:51:46] will throw their things together
[1:51:51] to fight communists. And it's exactly
[1:51:53] playing into the hands
[1:51:56] of what God said right here.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; And you Protestants laying yonder sound
[1:52:03] asleep.
[1:52:05] I tell you, he's still prophet.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; He knew they were sound asleep.
[1:52:10] Sound asleep reading a love story
[1:52:13] magazine.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I hope there's nobody here got one in
[1:52:17] your house.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I'd get rid of it.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Get rid of that trash. Amen.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Be rocked to sleep by some entertainment
[1:52:29] or something instead of the Bible and
[1:52:33] out gadding around somewhere in some
[1:52:35] kind of a party instead of in a prayer
[1:52:37] meeting somewhere a fussing at one
[1:52:40] another about little old petty things
[1:52:42] that don't matter that much. They might
[1:52:44] matter, but they don't matter that much.
[1:52:51] You ought to be on your knees somewhere
[1:52:53] if you know what eternity meant.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; You kids know what eternity means?
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; Eternity. Eternal life.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; Eternal life, my brother, my sister.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; He talks about how the Judas spirit,
[1:53:11] because the Judas spirit held the bag,
[1:53:13] he's making direct reference. And I'm
[1:53:16] going to mention something of the
[1:53:17] nicicoatan system. I hear in the message
[1:53:20] people, oh that's nickelatan. That poor
[1:53:23] soul doesn't even know nickelan means
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; in the light of what a messenger has
[1:53:28] said.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; And he said, see how the Judas spirit
[1:53:32] came back as a rider on a white horse.
[1:53:34] Did you know that?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You know about Judas? You know how he
[1:53:39] betrayed Christ? Now he came back on a
[1:53:42] white horse.
[1:53:44] Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Here prophet just takes him right out of
[1:53:48] Eden out of out of the garden of uh
[1:53:50] garden of Gethsemane rather. Takes him
[1:53:52] right out of the garden and takes him
[1:53:53] right out of the last supper and puts
[1:53:55] him on a white horse in the book of
[1:53:56] revelation. As the same spirit there
[1:53:59] that was riding there and he rode on the
[1:54:01] next horse and he rode on the black one
[1:54:03] and he rode on the pale one.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; It was that same spirit and rode right
[1:54:07] into a church system and was here today
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; last week before the world.
[1:54:15] son of predition.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; So close to the real
[1:54:26] just as Judas was close to Jesus.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Are you listening?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; A crown was given him a white horse
[1:54:33] rider.
[1:54:35] how he said the spirit was now in the
[1:54:38] leader of the nickelan system and he was
[1:54:41] a triple crowned pope who sat as god in
[1:54:45] his temple calling himself the viker of
[1:54:47] Christ. If viker of Christ means instead
[1:54:51] of Christ or in place of or on behalf of
[1:54:57] God then the pope is calling himself the
[1:55:00] Holy Ghost.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Maybe you never heard that before.
[1:55:04] You're hearing it now
[1:55:10] or disposing the Holy Ghost acting for
[1:55:14] him.
[1:55:16] That was the Judas spirit in him doing
[1:55:18] that. See how he conquered going forth
[1:55:21] conquering and to conquer. I say last
[1:55:24] week was the perhaps the greatest
[1:55:25] evidence and maybe the only evidence
[1:55:26] that you've seen in your newspapers,
[1:55:28] heard on your radio or saw. I I hope not
[1:55:31] a television screen, but at least on the
[1:55:32] computer, you can see it on NBC, on
[1:55:34] computer, the video clips, and you see
[1:55:36] them uh the parading down and and coming
[1:55:39] before giving great honor and uh and so
[1:55:43] on. Uh
[1:55:45] there's only one conclusion you can come
[1:55:47] to. He has conquered
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; without a missile, without a tank,
[1:55:54] without an atomic bomb, without an army.
[1:55:58] He has conquered.
[1:56:06] Christ did not do that.
[1:56:09] The only ones that came to him were
[1:56:12] already predestinated by the father. And
[1:56:15] the church says
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; already predestinated by the father. He
[1:56:21] didn't have to come out and ride out and
[1:56:24] conquer us as it were. He just came and
[1:56:26] showed himself. And when he we we when
[1:56:28] we saw the bridegroom, the bride fell in
[1:56:31] love with him.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; And so on and on it went that spirit.
[1:56:37] And one day it will become truly
[1:56:40] incarnate
[1:56:41] in a man who will head up the world
[1:56:44] council of churches. He will head up
[1:56:46] that
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; just as we have been saying. And by this
[1:56:50] by his gold, remember Judas held the
[1:56:53] bag.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Amazing how you tie the two together.
[1:56:56] Judas held the bag and I still hold the
[1:56:59] bag. That spirit still holds the bag.
[1:57:09] He will control the whole world and that
[1:57:12] antichrist system will own everything
[1:57:15] and try to control everybody. But Jesus
[1:57:18] will come back and destroy them all with
[1:57:20] the brightness of his coming and their
[1:57:23] end will be the lake of fire.
[1:57:32] I have some other things
[1:57:35] but I just want to come to this
[1:57:39] and we're going to close
[1:58:01] Some people tell me
[1:58:05] that uh
[1:58:09] when I preach so hard it's nice to see
[1:58:10] me smile once in a while. So going to
[1:58:14] smile.
[1:58:18] There were many
[1:58:21] widows
[1:58:24] in Israel
[1:58:26] in the days of Elias or Elijah
[1:58:30] when the heavens were shut up three
[1:58:33] years in six months
[1:58:35] when great famine was throughout all the
[1:58:39] land. There's a lot of good people
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; and there are a lot of widows,
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; a lot of fine little women. There were
[1:58:52] many widows. Jesus said there were many
[1:58:54] widows.
[1:58:56] They didn't have someone helping them
[1:58:58] earn a living. And maybe they had more
[1:59:01] than a son. They may have had several
[1:59:03] children.
[1:59:06] But Jesus said, "But there was only one
[1:59:09] that Elijah was sent to."
[1:59:19] But none of them under none of them was
[1:59:21] Elias sent under Serpa,
[1:59:24] a city of Sidon,
[1:59:27] unto woman that was a widow. And many
[1:59:31] lepers,
[1:59:33] many lepers.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to see it as we draw to a
[1:59:39] close and make it very personal. Many
[1:59:41] lepers were on the streets crying,
[1:59:43] "Unclean, unclean, but maybe holding a
[1:59:46] little cup."
[1:59:50] Mercy, mercy, unclean, unclean. But can
[1:59:53] you help me? There were many,
[1:59:57] but only one was Elijah,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; the prophet,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; and none of them was cleansed.
[2:00:07] good people,
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; nice people, praying people,
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; believing people,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; what is it? It's a you cannot even begin
[2:00:18] to describe the wisdom of God.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Many were sitting at the pool of
[2:00:23] Bethesda and the prophet said waterhead
[2:00:26] babies and all kinds of people crippled
[2:00:29] who couldn't get up and whatever more
[2:00:31] and Jesus stepped over them and that was
[2:00:33] the compassion of almighty God. But
[2:00:36] don't ever think that you and I can
[2:00:37] figure God out.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; We You might as well say amen to that.
[2:00:41] You'll never understand God.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Many people and one of the first things
[2:00:48] that comes to an individual when when
[2:00:51] the word comes and their mind becomes
[2:00:55] enlightened
[2:00:57] and the word becomes open an open book
[2:01:00] to them. One of the statements that I
[2:01:02] hear so often is, and you have said it,
[2:01:06] but why me?
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Why me? These people are such nice
[2:01:14] people. Even the church I came from,
[2:01:16] I've got memories. Such wonderful
[2:01:18] people,
[2:01:20] excellent people,
[2:01:23] maybe better than myself or yourself.
[2:01:26] That has nothing to do with it. I don't
[2:01:29] know many very fine people and many
[2:01:34] wellestablished churches and millions of
[2:01:38] members and hundreds of thousands of
[2:01:41] ministers
[2:01:44] and perhaps more than all of you I could
[2:01:46] say.
[2:01:48] But why
[2:01:50] did God arrange
[2:01:52] that I'd sit on a log with the spirit of
[2:01:55] Elijah in a man and Elijah prophet
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; who looked at me within a few inches of
[2:02:02] my eyes and just with that they were
[2:02:05] dull
[2:02:07] and yet penetrating
[2:02:10] and looked through my life to my
[2:02:13] earliest memory of myself
[2:02:16] said you have three questions
[2:02:20] and here's what they are. The first one
[2:02:23] which was least important, the next one
[2:02:26] which was more important and the last
[2:02:28] one which I thought was insoluble.
[2:02:34] He never started
[2:02:36] telling me what he believed or what he
[2:02:38] preached. Took immediately to the
[2:02:41] scripture
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; and it's this that came alive. Amen.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; And while I had many other questions, I
[2:02:49] knew one thing that the spirit that was
[2:02:52] coming out of his mouth was the author
[2:02:54] of this book.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:01] Many
[2:03:03] young preachers at 27
[2:03:07] was there in this country and many
[2:03:10] people
[2:03:12] Congo and the rest of you many were in
[2:03:15] your city
[2:03:17] you from the Pacific Northwest from
[2:03:20] Seattle to com wherever you're from many
[2:03:22] were in Poland
[2:03:25] many were in the UK
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; many were in Germany many of you are
[2:03:30] scattered all over the earth. Many but
[2:03:33] to you was this Holy Spirit sent.
[2:03:37] Hallelujah. To you this grace came.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, maybe the first thing we
[2:03:45] heard from him was go and wash. We say,
[2:03:47] "Well, there's better things to do. I've
[2:03:49] heard better sermon than that." That's
[2:03:51] not the point. I tell you, when we have
[2:03:53] a thus sayith the Lord, all we do is
[2:03:56] say, "I believe it."
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Have you figured it out yet? No, I
[2:04:00] haven't figured it out yet. And I
[2:04:02] probably won't figure it out. I haven't
[2:04:04] got enough time to figure it out. I'm
[2:04:06] not going to waste my time trying to
[2:04:07] figure it out.
[2:04:09] I'm going to put all my focus on having
[2:04:12] my faith increased so I can believe it
[2:04:14] with all my heart. Keep me awake. Keep
[2:04:17] me alert. Keep me energized.
[2:04:20] Keep my heart filled with faith.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, it is love. The Savior's love.
[2:04:27] There's something within my soul today.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Is it in your soul?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, my brother, my sister, many good
[2:04:41] people,
[2:04:43] and they don't hear what you're hearing.
[2:04:45] Not because of me, because of God's
[2:04:46] grace to you.
[2:04:49] Many good people sat in church today.
[2:04:56] And I tell you what, I wouldn't have to
[2:04:59] have much revelation
[2:05:01] if I sat in a church and thought today
[2:05:05] this organization who I devote myself to
[2:05:08] and give my tithes and offerings to is
[2:05:11] part of a world council system. a world
[2:05:14] council of churches that's being
[2:05:15] swallowed up by this absolute
[2:05:19] fallacy.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; What is with this?
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; What's all these gorgeous robes?
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Is that have anything to do with Christ?
[2:05:30] What's all this business of all these
[2:05:32] marble and all this glory and all this
[2:05:35] gold and all this sell it and give it to
[2:05:39] the poor? Do something.
[2:05:44] so ostentatious
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; that it literally boggles the mind of
[2:05:50] the greatest and the wealthiest and the
[2:05:52] most powerful and whatever more
[2:05:58] and I'm just ending.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; It saddened my heart
[2:06:04] to see America bow.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Saddened my heart to be honest with you.
[2:06:11] I'm Canadian, but I'm Christian.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; If I didn't have to have a passport in
[2:06:17] my pocket, I wouldn't even own this
[2:06:19] country.
[2:06:21] You might be shocked to hear that, but
[2:06:23] I'm ashamed of it.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; I'm ashamed of what it stands for. I'm
[2:06:27] ashamed of her same-sex marriages. I'm
[2:06:30] ashamed of her acceptance of all of this
[2:06:33] perversion. I'm ashamed of the weakness
[2:06:35] within the government. I'm ashamed that
[2:06:37] they don't stand for truth. I'm ashamed
[2:06:40] that you can't have a a gospel radio
[2:06:42] station. They call it a Christian
[2:06:43] nation. We don't have gospel radio
[2:06:45] stations in this so-called all we have
[2:06:48] is a a CBC uh Canadian Broadcasting
[2:06:52] Corporation with all their nonsense.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Sorry, Brother Roger. I know you do a
[2:06:56] lot of work for them. Charge them
[2:06:57] double, would you, for me?
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Get everything you can out of Cain, his
[2:07:08] kingdom.
[2:07:11] use it for the kingdom of God.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Well, that's my message.
[2:07:21] [Applause]
[2:07:35] While the musicians come,
[2:07:38] one one last thing I want to leave with
[2:07:39] you in the message, feast of the
[2:07:42] trumpets. Brother Graham says the
[2:07:44] trumpets are to Israel.
[2:07:47] And I I just informed you of what Rabbi
[2:07:51] Richmond has sent and being called up
[2:07:55] and a declaration that the government
[2:07:57] has made on them.
[2:08:00] But he said, "Notice
[2:08:04] the trumpets that we're speaking of is a
[2:08:06] call together and that's called Israel."
[2:08:10] Now, here's what it's called for.
[2:08:12] Either a feast
[2:08:15] or for war
[2:08:19] or for a person
[2:08:23] or for a sacred day.
[2:08:26] And they haven't had the person revealed
[2:08:29] yet,
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; but that's what they've been called for.
[2:08:33] And he said just a little further
[2:08:40] really pay attention now.
[2:08:46] He said when he spoke of those
[2:08:48] 200,000,000
[2:08:50] demons that have been loosed that were
[2:08:52] bound by circumstances in the river
[2:08:54] Euphrates. They've been loosed. They've
[2:08:57] been loosed. They're loosed tonight,
[2:08:59] today, this morning. And he said the old
[2:09:02] Roman Empire
[2:09:04] being revived.
[2:09:07] Now friends, the first picture I showed
[2:09:10] you today,
[2:09:13] that first picture, do you recall it?
[2:09:16] Leaders and dignitaries standing
[2:09:20] at the feet of the the one who's the
[2:09:24] emblem or the symbol of all that that
[2:09:26] church stands for.
[2:09:29] standing there indeed with reverence I
[2:09:31] think about 170 nations represented
[2:09:36] if President Bush was here I'd love to
[2:09:39] tell him he did more
[2:09:42] to revive that nation that system
[2:09:48] than anything that's happened in modern
[2:09:50] history
[2:09:52] more to revive it to bring it to its its
[2:09:58] ultimate position
[2:09:59] They have never had such an
[2:10:02] acknowledgment.
[2:10:05] The the only superpower on earth.
[2:10:11] The one before it became a superpower.
[2:10:14] The single superpower.
[2:10:17] A prophet was walking here with that in
[2:10:21] him and that pillar of fire in
[2:10:23] attendance near him to speak through him
[2:10:27] and the spirit of Elijah within him and
[2:10:30] anointing him waiting to declare some of
[2:10:33] these things. And he was saying it many
[2:10:36] years before this event would unfold.
[2:10:40] But you believers of it are living to
[2:10:43] see it and have seen it and have
[2:10:45] experienced it. And I say, "Where are
[2:10:47] we?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Where has that placed us?" And I would
[2:10:50] say I would say
[2:10:54] that Rome and the Vatican and that
[2:10:58] harlot church was elevated to a status
[2:11:02] she has not ever known
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; in history this last week.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're at. I would say
[2:11:12] nations are breaking.
[2:11:14] Israel's awakening. And I believe while
[2:11:17] we have our liberty and so on, we ought
[2:11:19] to pray. Nobody's restraining you from
[2:11:22] coming to pray. No one's restraining
[2:11:25] you. But here are precious
[2:11:30] brother Rabbi Richmond. I'll call him
[2:11:33] Garen Solomon and all of those that
[2:11:36] associated with them. They can't go and
[2:11:38] pray where they would like to pray.
[2:11:42] All of these things happening right at
[2:11:44] this time.
[2:11:49] Oh, do you think things happen amongst
[2:11:52] leaders of the world
[2:11:54] by chance?
[2:11:58] [Music]
[2:12:00] Maybe maybe I won't be, you know,
[2:12:04] bringing you these things all that who
[2:12:06] knows how much longer.
[2:12:10] I don't even think it's an accident
[2:12:13] that the heir to the throne of England
[2:12:17] wed
[2:12:20] the woman who he's had an adulterous
[2:12:23] relationship with for years
[2:12:28] and that that is happening now.
[2:12:32] All the dignitaries are bowing before
[2:12:34] that caucus.
[2:12:37] all this pomp and hundreds of millions
[2:12:39] of dollars being spent. The leader of
[2:12:42] another nation,
[2:12:44] marrying a woman, he's had a his common
[2:12:47] lover even while he was married and
[2:12:49] raising children. And at the very same
[2:12:52] time, all these things are converging.
[2:12:55] Here is some fervent Jews being called
[2:12:58] before the security telling them, "You
[2:13:01] can't go up there." And furthermore,
[2:13:03] they declared they were going to go up
[2:13:05] there. A whole group of them said,
[2:13:07] "We're going to go up there. We're going
[2:13:08] to go up to the mount. We're going up
[2:13:10] several thousand strong." Do you know
[2:13:12] what Israel did? They responded with
[2:13:14] 3,000 policemen
[2:13:18] and said, "You will be stopped. You will
[2:13:21] not go up there."
[2:13:24] All happening in the same week.
[2:13:29] I say it's time that we have our eyes
[2:13:31] open and our understanding illuminated.
[2:13:34] God bless you as you stand.
[2:13:38] Nations are breaking.
[2:13:40] Israel's awakening.
[2:13:43] The signs that the prophets foretold
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:48] the Gentile days
[2:13:51] with horrors and comfort. Eternity
[2:13:55] soon will us.
[2:13:59] The day our redemption is near
[2:14:05] our failing for fear.
[2:14:10] Be filled with the spirit. Your lamps
[2:14:13] trimmed and clear.
[2:14:16] Look out. Your redemption is near.
[2:14:22] The fig tree is growing.
[2:14:25] Israeling.
[2:14:27] Her national life throne.
[2:14:32] Today she is calling. Her lingers
[2:14:38] [Music]
[2:14:40] to your
[2:14:43] day of redemption is
[2:14:49] heart.
[2:15:02] Your redemption is near. The last verse,
[2:15:05] please.
[2:15:07] False prophets are lying. God's truth.
[2:15:11] They're denying that Jesus the Christ is
[2:15:15] our God.
[2:15:18] Through generations,
[2:15:20] first rehearsals
[2:15:25] have trust
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:47] your redemption.
[2:15:49] Let's say the redemption is here. The
[2:15:52] day of redemption is here. Yes, man's
[2:15:57] heart.
[2:16:02] Oh, be filled with the spirit your
[2:16:09] look.
[2:16:10] Your redemption is
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; I would say if there were my last words
[2:16:16] to this church, I would say don't be
[2:16:18] lax.
[2:16:21] Don't be in a relaxed mode about this
[2:16:24] message. This message is ahead of you.
[2:16:29] What the prophet has spoken is already
[2:16:31] ahead of you. He spoke of things maybe
[2:16:33] you're not experiencing yet. Whatever
[2:16:36] you do, keep in tune.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Keep snugged up. Keep fervent.
[2:16:42] [Music]
[2:16:44] You know these words and all the
[2:16:46] earnestness in my voice has gone out.
[2:16:51] You'll hear it again someday.
[2:16:54] You'll hear it just the way it's been
[2:16:55] spoken. You'll hear it again.
[2:16:58] And if you don't take heed,
[2:17:00] God's going to require you to answer to
[2:17:04] what's been spoken.
[2:17:06] And you have to decide
[2:17:09] that's just a man or that's the devil or
[2:17:13] that's God. And what is in your heart
[2:17:15] will tell you what it is. You'll have a
[2:17:18] witness in your heart. Say, I know
[2:17:20] that's God. Then respond likewise.
[2:17:23] Respond in that same manner. I know
[2:17:25] that's God because it's touching my
[2:17:27] heart very, very deep. Amen. The day of
[2:17:32] redemption is here. It's now our
[2:17:38] faith for fear
[2:17:43] with the spirit in your lending and
[2:17:49] look up. Your redemption is here.
[2:17:54] Look up.
[2:17:56] Your redemption is here.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Shake hands with somebody as we say it
[2:18:01] again. Look up. Your redemption is here.
[2:18:07] Oh, look up. Your redemption
[2:18:12] is here.
[2:18:16] God bless you. I'm going to ask Brother
[2:18:18] Tom while we're standing to come and
[2:18:20] dismiss us in prayer.
[2:18:24] Heavenly Father, we believe we've heard
[2:18:27] from the throne of God this morning.
[2:18:30] We can say our hearts did burn within
[2:18:32] us. It feels like we're in Bible times
[2:18:36] all over again. Lord,
[2:18:38] to see the spirit of God move by the
[2:18:41] word of God within our lives. Open our
[2:18:43] eyes, Lord, to see this glory that is
[2:18:46] amongst us.
[2:18:47] Lord, as the spirit of God was
[2:18:48] admonishing, if there be somebody here
[2:18:50] that has not moved into that channel to
[2:18:54] accepting Jesus Christ, Lord, would you
[2:18:57] move them like men of old were moved of
[2:19:00] the Holy Ghost. Would you move them,
[2:19:02] Lord, to know you in the power of your
[2:19:04] resurrection to know you as a living
[2:19:06] God, a God that is amongst his people
[2:19:09] again? We pray God that you will save
[2:19:11] the lost, redeem those, Lord, whose
[2:19:14] names have been written down. We pray
[2:19:16] God that you'll move us into deeper
[2:19:17] depths, higher objectives in the word of
[2:19:20] God. We pray go with your people now and
[2:19:23] bless your servant. We ask in Jesus
[2:19:25] name. Amen.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
