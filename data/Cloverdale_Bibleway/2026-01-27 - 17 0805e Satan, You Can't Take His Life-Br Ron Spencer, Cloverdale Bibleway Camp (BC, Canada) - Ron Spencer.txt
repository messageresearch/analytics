I was just wonderful. The atmosphere was just just a supernatural experience and I was so blessed to be a part of it. And as he was winding up the service, it just began to go through my mind. It's like I am so tired of walking around packing broken chains. It's like we're not a chained people. So why do we walk around like we are and live beneath our inheritance? say, "I don't want to do that anymore, and I don't have to do that anymore." I trust you identify with that. So, I thought we should open this evening with Broken Chains. We can sing the chorus together. You may bend, but you won't ever break. Hallelujah. And when Brother Brandham talks about those trees that were just flexible as the wind blew. Amen. Nothing's going to take you down, saints. Hallelujah. Let's sing this together now in victory and we won't be bound by broken chains. Amen. We'll just sing the chorus. Oh, you may but you won't pray and you may stumble and even feel you lost away but you won't fall.

We're going to go to prayer in this atmosphere of victory this evening. Amen. I'm going to ask if our brothers would come. We are going to take up an offering this evening. And again, tomorrow morning, if you're not prepared this evening, we will take up an offering tomorrow morning. And maybe if the deacon brothers could just come at this time and we'll prepare for the offering. And I just want to sing so glad I'm yours. Just simple little song that I grew up with that I just love every time cuz I nothing ever changes fact that I'm just so glad I belong to the Lord Jesus. Aren't you so thankful for that? As we prepare to go to prayer, maybe we could just sing that chorus together. &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours, Lord. Maybe you could just worship him as we go to prayer. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad your for your mercy has me. I'm so glad you found me and you saved me. I'm so glad so let's just make love to him once again. So your so your mercy has me. I'm so glad you found me and you save me. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So I'm yours. Brother Tim, would you come please? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have enjoyed the camp? &gt;&gt; We still have two services left. and we're thankful for everything that the Lord has done for us thus far. And if that was all that we got, we would be extremely blessed. &gt;&gt; But we want to enter in with everything that we have. And tonight's offering is going for the expenses that are above and beyond what your fees pay for. Those of you that are on the grounds or those of you that are off the grounds, it gives you an opportunity to participate in worship through our giving. So, it goes towards expenses and also for a love offering for the speakers. And let's just ask God to bless the offering and to bless this service tonight. If you have a need, why don't you why don't you just say, "Lord, I've enjoyed so far, but I want more from you." &gt;&gt; Why don't you just signify to that to him tonight? Wonderful, &gt;&gt; blessed redeemer. Oh Lord, how humbled we are that the great and mighty God, the creator of all things, the very author of life has chosen to come here on the backside of the mountain as it were and to meet with us, Lord, to gather together with us as you said that you would be wherever two or three of us would be gathered in your name. But Lord, it's been a special experience this weekend. We thank you for the ministry. We thank you for the word. It has been anointed and it has touched our hearts and it has blessed us, oh God. And we're desiring once again tonight that you'll pour out your spirit in a fresh way upon us, Lord. We don't want to put any limitations on you, Lord. We want you to have the preeminence. We want you, Lord, to have the liberty. We want you to take complete control over every part of this service. Oh God, take brother Ron into your hands once again. Anoint him aresh for our sakes, Lord. You know everyone individually what we have need of, Father. And we commit ourselves to you. We commit our needs to you. There might be one person here tonight that maybe this is their first service and they say, "I need a touch from you, Lord." We know you're here to touch them, Father, as they lift up their heart to you. And we give ourselves unreservedly. You know the needs both here out over the internet, Lord, wherever it might be. Lord, may you come to each one individually. And Father, we want to lift up this offering to you. Lord, you know the needs that are here, financial needs. We pray that you take what we're able to give. We give it as worship unto you. And we ask, Lord, that you'll bless it and multiply it. And Lord, may you bless the giver also. We commit this service and this offering into your hands in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Maybe we can just sing that a couple more times as you have your seats and we take up the offering. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad your mercy has followed me. I'm so glad you found me and you set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm just once more. So glad I'm yours. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. So glad your mercy has followed me. So glad you found me and you set me free. So glad I'm yours, Lord. So glad I'm yours. Hallelujah. Amen. I'm going to invite Sister Margaret in your cabin to come if you'd like to come just right at this time and get ready. Uh we do have one announcement that they just wanted us to make for tomorrow morning. It's our last morning of camp, but it's been a wonderful week and it's just been requested that those who are staying in the cabins, campers and non-ampers, you please have your rooms cleaned up and the trash taken out before you come to service in the morning. So, you have time between breakfast and service uh to clean up your cabin and uh just to have that done. It ends up lingering quite a bit into the afternoon and then some of us counselors end up being here till 4:00 cleaning cabins. So, we don't like to not do that. But uh we just appreciate your help with this and I just encourage you to express your appreciation. How many enjoyed the activity today? That was quite the quite the activity to put together. But I heard nothing but good things. And it's okay to express your appreciation to the ones who put that on and tell them how much you appreciated it. Amen. Everyone by now knows who brother Michael is, Sister Abigail. Just, you know, shake their hand, give them a hug, and tell them how much you appreciate the labors and all those who have worked. Amen. And it's a labor of love for you because they want to see you in an atmosphere where God can do something for you. And so we certainly appreciate them and each one that's given over these last days. Amen. God bless you. Sister Margaret, &gt;&gt; the girls said they they said that they'd like to sing a special and um I was sitting there after service last night and this song came on my heart and I was I said, "Lord, is did you want me to sing that song? Is it you?" And then when I went in my cabin, I walked in the door, Chenet was singing that song. So I thought I'd sing it. We'd sing it tonight. Touch your people once again. With your precious holy hand we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon this earth through a living glorious church. Not for temporary but to restore authority and power. Let your mighty rushing wind blow. Touch your people once again. We need wisdom. We need power and true love for each other. We have had so many big but empty words. So we come before your face asking for your grace. Bring your people to a state of kingdom life. Restore your church again. Touch your people once again with your precious holy hand we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon this earth through a living glorious church. Not for temporary deeds, but to restore authority and power. Let your mighty rushing wind blow away. Touch your people once again. Lord, you see thy tired servants and your broken wounded soldiers. Oh, how much we need your precious healing hand. We need the power of the cross as the only source for us. When we stand up facing final battle grind, restore your church again. Touch your people once again with your precious holy hand we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon this earth through a living glorious church. Not for temporary deeds, but to restore authority and power. Let your mighty rushing wind blow in. Touch your people once again. Touch your people once again. With your precious holy hand we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon this earth through a living glorious church. Not for temporary deeds, but to restore authority and power. Let your mighty rushing wind blow in. Touch your people once again, not for temporary deeds, but to restore authority and power. Let your mighty rushing wind blow away. Touch your people once again. and Julia, don't go too far. We're gonna have the Edmonton young people come now and sing for us as well. Uh if the Hammermeister and the Dole and the Paris families would come, but make your way on up and just sing. There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do as they come and prepare for us. Lord, there is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. And I could search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like sing it once more. There's none like you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, there is none. No one like you, Lord Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I can search for all eternity, Lord, and find there is none like you. I believe your love is faithful when all my hopes have crumbled. It is standing strong and aable when everything else fails. I believe your love will cover me through every storm. I am persuaded. Nothing in life, nothing in death, no mountain high, no ocean death, no power below on earth or above can separate me from your love. I believe beyond the shadow. You never will forsake me and your love endures forever. When all my strength is gone, I believe your love will carry me and hold me close. I am persuaded. Nothing in life, nothing in death, no mountain high, no ocean death, no power below on earth or above can separate me from your love. Nothing in life, nothing in death, no mountain height, no ocean death, no power below on earth or above can separate me from your love. Nothing in life, nothing in death, no mountain in height, no ocean death, no power below on earth or above can separate me from your love. been separate. We found your love. Amen. God bless you all. Nice to be here tonight. Amen. It's wonderful to see the young people participate. Tremendous. We thank the Edmonton young people for being a part of camp. God bless you for coming all this way and blessing us and each and every one of you that have come from various parts of the world to be here. It's been a special camp. &gt;&gt; It's been a supernatural camp &gt;&gt; and I believe that God is going to do something very supernatural again tonight. My expectation is so high. Amen. &gt;&gt; I trust your expectation is so high &gt;&gt; that God is going to come in this tent and God is going to visit us in a very supernatural way. And I'm crying in my own heart, Lord, one more time, let the angel of the Lord himself come and visit his people and come and meet with us in a supernatural time such as this. Before I make any further remarks, I must make this announcement that tomorrow for the and we want to greet the saints at Cloverdale Bible Way and all that are streaming with us this evening. We have a number of our people that can't make it across because of certain documents they haven't obtained as yet. They will be gathering tomorrow morning at the church at 10:00. Brother Tim Dodd is going to sacrifice his presence here and he will be there at the church. Brother Joe Waldner will be a a faithful deacon and he will be there at the church. And I I trust and I know that God is no respector of places. &gt;&gt; I believe he's here right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; And young people, if you've ever pulled in your life tonight, I know tonight is a night to be &gt;&gt; I have been looking to the Lord myself. You know, not that we're anything, but we know that when God brings certain vessels here, that is for a reason and for a time. &gt;&gt; And I believe the word is going to come in power. I believe the Holy Spirit is going to come and confirm it. And I believe that God is going to do the impossible. You might as well start speaking it. And you might as well start believing it. Don't dis, you know, settle back on it. Say, "Amen. This is what we believe. This is what we believe." I'm going to say something tonight. I have not said until just yesterday. For those that were at the 2007 convention, Brother Ron Spencer was preaching at the pulpit and ministering the word of God. And I just said to the Lord, I said, 'Lord, is that same angel that was with the prophet, is it standing right there? And the Holy Spirit moved on me. I I didn't even know what happened in that service. I felt I was identifying the presence of God with his servant and God was confirming it within my heart. and tonight and today this afternoon I just went to my room and I I thought I haven't said that before and then I was just playing a tape on experiences and then I listened to a prayer line and brother Bram said that angel of the Lord is standing right here tonight and he said not only tonight is he going to stand here he said it'll be tonight and for the next generations to come and I said that's this generation I said that's tonight. God, come to the word and confirm it with signs following. And whatever God has laid on brother Ron Spencer's heart, I say, "Oh, Holy Spirit, we welcome you in this tent." And whatever your need is, I believe God is going to meet that need through the vessel of God that God has called to be here tonight. And don't sit there looking at me. You say, "Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, minister to me. Let the Holy Ghost himself come and meet my individual need." We're going to, Lord willing, have a prayer line tonight. So, I want you to tuck something in your heart and say, "I believe. I believe, Holy Spirit." Whatever your heart's desire is tonight, God is going to grant it. So, I want you to be prepared. I'm prepared. Brother Ron Spencer has laid himself aside. I said, "Lord, use the man of God. Use the brothers as we will be in a prayer line praying with you, believing for the supernatural." He's a supernatural God. So, as we welcome our precious brother Ron Spencer who has come to be with us and if you haven't given an offering, the offering table's over there. Be sure saints of God, we want to bless the man of God and their labors. Brother David Mayor, God bless him. He'll be flying out tomorrow morning and won't be here for tomorrow. But we will we'll send a good report of what God is going to cap this me these meetings off. So why don't you stand with me? Are you believing? Are you believing? &gt;&gt; Are you expecting? &gt;&gt; Say, I'm expecting, Brother Tom. I'm expecting the unexpected. Amen. Welcome, Holy Spirit. We are in your presence as we welcome brother Ron Spencer, a friend and a man of God. Welcome, Holy Spirit. We are in your presence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Fill us with your power inside of me. Welcome, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you just lift your hands in your &gt;&gt; Give him a little wave offering this evening and say, "Lord, here am I. Your power live inside of me. Fill us with your power inside of me. &gt;&gt; Is that your desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We want to just welcome him to wherever you're at. &gt;&gt; We're very aware that he's here. &gt;&gt; We know without a shadow of a doubt. We don't have to beg him now. He's here. Now, I would like for you to reach beyond your senses just for a bit &gt;&gt; and say, "Father, pass by my way. Would you pass by my way?" These are very sacred grounds. These are grounds that God chose to to bless. &gt;&gt; We're coming up on our 10th anniversary. And I was burned by a propane explosion, laying in a coma with with both lungs completely full of pneumonia and also soot from the fire. And they declared them to be 75% destroyed. The doctors had just told my wife that it would be impossible for me to live. Brother Bisll called my wife, caught her on the phone, which was a miracle within itself. And he began to tell her that you were praying for her. He was burdened on his heart that of what all was going on and burdened for her as well. She's in the building. One son was in the hospital. The Matthew that one had saved my life. He was burned and he was in one hospital and I was in another ICU burn unit. My lungs burned, my mouth burned, my throat burned, my face, my arms burned, my arms burned completely to the bones. But God's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; And as the doctors were giving up, there's a voice that spoke to brother Ed &gt;&gt; that told him they had just bought Bible Way Mount Baker Camp. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that I would be the speaker next year. &gt;&gt; Now to humanity it looked impossible. &gt;&gt; And if you were looking at the circumstances, &gt;&gt; it would have been impossible. But the God that is in this building right now &gt;&gt; is a God of the impossible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I came the next year and spoke that meeting, my family with me. That was the year that Brother Andrew would receive the Holy Ghost. The next week we went home. My lungs were scarred and I was great dealing with great difficulty of the scarring of my lungs. Brother Ed Bisll was preaching a meeting at Ruth, North Carolina, a mission camp. And as he was speaking, and he was speaking on God takes those bruised cells and not just heals them, but recreates them &gt;&gt; the same way that he did the earth that was without form and void. And as I was listening to that service that night, something began to respond inside of me &gt;&gt; that said, "Tonight's your night." &gt;&gt; Oh, that that would be your response tonight. &gt;&gt; Tonight's your night. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I could have spent the rest of my life and with scarred lungs and and an an oxygen tent the rest of my life, but I want you to know the healer came in the room. I stood to my feet as brother Ed was speaking and the power of God came down over top of me like a great giant oxygen tank and it literally felt like a fire that went down in my lungs. felt like my chest was going to blow up. I want to report to you tonight since that time, I haven't had one infection in my lungs since then. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's just go to prayer just now. I'd like for you to brother to a brother, sister to a sister, husband to a wife, could you just take them by the handle? And I want you to repeat these words. Tonight's my night. &gt;&gt; Tonight's my night. Almighty God, &gt;&gt; we bow our heads before you just now &gt;&gt; and we felt the angel of the Lord come this morning &gt;&gt; as brother David Mayer was speaking &gt;&gt; while we were in the tent &gt;&gt; even preparing for this prayer line today. &gt;&gt; Your presence came rich and real. Now, Father, we admit tonight &gt;&gt; it is you that we want to see. &gt;&gt; To reach out and grab my garments &gt;&gt; is not enough, &gt;&gt; but we want to reach and grab your garment today. &gt;&gt; Oh, Father, right now in the name of Jesus Christ, may faith arise throughout this tent, &gt;&gt; Lord. Not just in this tent, but around the world. Father, may faith arise, Father, with healing in its wings, dear God. May Satan be bound in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We remind the devil, he has no keys to his own house. He has no arrow for his own bow. He is nothing but a bluff. He is powerless at the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We as your children just now, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, we become very aware, we become very aware that we're standing on hallowed holy ground. Oh God, not because men and women are here, because you're here. You're the God that makes it holy. &gt;&gt; Oh God, Moses was commanded, take your shoes off. The ground you're standing on is a holy ground. So now may our thoughts and our focus be 100% on you right now. Oh, bring victory to this camp like never before. We thank you for every service that's ever been held on this ground. But may tonight go beyond every expectation. Father, we invite you to this place. We invite you to our pew. We invite you to our need right now. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll give you all the glory. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 14 and verse one. If I could have just a touch more volume here, if it would be okay. St. John chapter 14 and verse one. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. And if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself. And I love these words that where I am, &gt;&gt; there you may be also. &gt;&gt; And I want to be where he's at. in Revelations chapter 1 and I want to read a portion of verse 17 and then 18. Fear not. &gt;&gt; I love those words. Fear not. I am the first and the last. I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I am alive forever more. &gt;&gt; Amen. and have the keys of hell and of death. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this evening. &gt;&gt; In the mighty conqueror, brother Brandham says it like this. He said, "I can see him as the heavens and the earth turning black, the rocks belting out of the mountains, the whole heavens, the moon, the stars refused to shine. He conquered it. &gt;&gt; And when he went down and descended and knocked at the door where the lost souls was, and when the doors came open, and those people who laughed and made fun of Enoch, who made fun of Noah, I can hear him say, "I am that one &gt;&gt; that Enoch said would come with 10,000 of his saints." &gt;&gt; Why didn't you believe Enoch? Why didn't you believe Noah? Everything had to know that he had conquered. When he shut the door on them, the days of mercy was passed. And on down into the lowest pits of hell he went and he knocked at the city doors of the devil's hell. And the devil comes to the door. You remember this Satan when it happened &gt;&gt; and the devil comes to the door as he could look to see. And there he said, "Well, here you are after all. I sure thought I had you when I cut John's head off in prison, but now after all you've got here, I can hear him as he straightens himself out and says, "Satan, I'm the virgin born son of God of the living God. My blood still wet on the cross. I paid the price. &gt;&gt; I have conquered. I have come down to take over, to strip you of everything that you claimed that you had. &gt;&gt; He reached over to his side and jerked off the keys of death and hell off of him and kicked him back in the place where he belonged. He conquered hell. &gt;&gt; And when he arose, he had the keys of death and hell hanging on his side. &gt;&gt; Then what's the church scared about then? He conquered Satan. He conquered sickness. He conquered death. He conquered hell. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I would like to speak to you tonight. A subject is very dear to my heart. I started this in the first night I ever spoke along this line, but I want to continue with it this evening. And God just inspired me when brother Bisll got sick. So it becomes a very pertinent sermon for this night. &gt;&gt; And I want to not just give a sermon title. &gt;&gt; But I want to make a declaration with this sermon title. &gt;&gt; Satan, &gt;&gt; you can't take his life. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; I want this echo and this reverberation that I feel in this platform. &gt;&gt; I want it to sweep across this audience. &gt;&gt; I want I want even hell to know tonight. &gt;&gt; Satan, &gt;&gt; you can't take his life. Now, we must understand we are we go through trials here. We're very honest. The scriptures tells us that we go through trials. Sometimes our trials are very dark and extremely difficult that we go through before there can be a victory. There has to be a a valley. Before there can be a testimony, there has to be a trial that we walk through. We know and we've heard of this week Shadrach, Mach, and Abedneo who were thrown in a furnace of fire. &gt;&gt; They were thrown there only to be protected &gt;&gt; with a furnace that was heated up seven times hotter than normal. But I got news for them. They could have heated it up 70 million times hotter and it still would not have burned them. &gt;&gt; Because the son of God met them right in the middle of their fire. &gt;&gt; We have spoke of Bardameus. He experienced a lifetime of blindness prior to experiencing the great physician's healing touch. A man named Legion would face demon after demon that would consume his life. But one day Jesus would come &gt;&gt; and look those demons in the eye and tell them that they couldn't stay there no longer. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you if you have been entertained or tormented by demons, you have came to the right meeting. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It is not the personality of a man that can shake those demons, but it's the power pack of the word of God that stands there. Are you with me? In a true believer's heart, and we are commissioned to cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lazarus had to die before he could arise. Sometimes we get impatient with God. Sometimes we think, will God ever, ever, ever, ever do anything? Will he ever come on the scene? Will he ever move? Lazarus had been a personal friend to Jesus. Brother Brandham tells us that Lazarus had been the man that took Jesus to John's baptism. He was a close friend. No doubt that they had a home to where Jesus was comfortable in. But Lazarus got sick &gt;&gt; and Jesus seemably was going another way. And they told him he was much sicker and he seemably went other farther even away. Let me just say God has a plan in our lives. &gt;&gt; There's a plan and a season that is in our lives. But God is always on time. &gt;&gt; We must be reminded tonight &gt;&gt; that death is a doorway. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is a doorway. It is only a tool in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; That allows us to go from this portal to that portal. &gt;&gt; I must remind you that the last breath here is the first breath there. &gt;&gt; And many times we fear death. We look at death as some great tormenting thing. For a Christian, it is the friend. &gt;&gt; From that point, cancer is defeated, tuberculosis is defeated, &gt;&gt; paralyzation is defeated. &gt;&gt; And there is a land beyond the river where there's no pain, no agony, no sorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I share this with you this afternoon. I stand as a witness. Some people can preach on victory, &gt;&gt; preach on trials, and they've only read them out of books. They can speak a lot of things that can can shake great congregations, but it makes a real difference when you've lived through &gt;&gt; some trials. I didn't ask for trials to come my way. I I I didn't I didn't see them coming. I never intended them to happen. But God allows trials to come &gt;&gt; sometimes to see what we'll do with it. I stand as a witness that my God is bigger than every trial that I've been through. &gt;&gt; I fell off of a house 40 ft and landed on concrete solidly on my back. It broke every vertebrae in my back. The doctor telling me that I would never walk again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we spoke to that doctor and said, "You just don't know who you're talking to." &gt;&gt; My dad came in and prayed for me. And he said, "The spirit of the Lord spoke to him this night. He'll ride home with you." &gt;&gt; And after several hours, feelings started coming back in my legs. Let me just say, that was Friday. On Monday, I went back to work. two strokes. Heart conditions. One of the strokes was a uh one that would keep me for eight days. I could not stand light. I thought that was the way I was going to be. Now it's eight days. And I was praying. While I was praying, God spoke to me during the night and said, "Who are you?" And I just called out. I remember calling out to him, raising my hands in that bed, saying, "I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit of the Lord moved in the room. A nurse came in that had not been taken care of me before, and she was using a little flashlight. The room was completely pitch pitch black cuz I could not stand light. And she she said, "Mr. Spencer," she said, "I I I'm here." I said, "The other people have told me about you and you're a preacher." I said, "Yes, ma'am. She said, "When I walked through your door, I felt something. &gt;&gt; I felt something move. I'm not a Christian, but I sure would like to be a Christian." &gt;&gt; I said, "Tonight, you can bow on your knees and give your heart to Jesus Christ." &gt;&gt; And she got down on her knees and she put my hand into her hand and and we begin to pray. after get done praying for her, God healed me 100%. And I went home the next morning. &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God. He said, "Satan may pin you in a corner with cancer." &gt;&gt; He said, "God will make a way of escape. Satan may pin you down under a car, brother David, but God will make a way of escape. Satan may have taken your family away from you, but God will make a way of escape. &gt;&gt; God has made a way of escape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, I don't believe in miracles. The days of miracles are passed." You have came way too late. &gt;&gt; You were at the wrong meeting. &gt;&gt; Our God is alive. &gt;&gt; He has proved himself to be alive. &gt;&gt; Our God, I don't want to say this in the wrong way, but our God did not die in 1965. &gt;&gt; He is still here tonight. &gt;&gt; And the reason that he has came to this meeting tonight is because of your need. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would use this scripture over and over again. And this got to be a haunting scripture in hell. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Isaiah 53 and verse one says, "Who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he shall growth before him as a tender plant, a root out of dry ground, and he hath no form of comedies. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we hid, as it were, our faces from him. He was despised and we esteemed him not. Woo! Hallelujah. Surely he hath borne our griefs, &gt;&gt; carried our sorrows. Yet we did esteem him, stricken and smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, &gt;&gt; with his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. He had power to call 10,000 angels to set him free. But he refused &gt;&gt; to utter and even look at them in in a in a certain way to bring them on the scene &gt;&gt; because you was so important. &gt;&gt; And he knew that every strike that Satan unleashed on top of him, &gt;&gt; they were surrendering. They didn't realize it, but they were surrendering their power. &gt;&gt; If you could just look at it tonight, they unleashed their demonic power on the body of Jesus Christ. I say, "Bring it on." &gt;&gt; As they beat him, the more they beat him, the more they freed us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No wonder we can stand here by the word of God and say this promise is mine. &gt;&gt; John 19:10. I'm trying not to get too excited too quick. Not doing a good job of it. Then said Pilate unto him, "Speak thou not unto me. knowest not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? And Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, &gt;&gt; except it was given thee from above. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he that deliverth un me unto thee hath the greater sin. John chapter 10 and verse 14. I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and know and I'm known of mine. As the father knoweth me, even so know I the father and I lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep I have which are not of this fold. Them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd. Therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. &gt;&gt; Notice these words. No man taketh it from me. &gt;&gt; No man. &gt;&gt; No man taketh it from me. &gt;&gt; But I have I lay it down on myself. I have power to lay it down. and I have power to take it up again. &gt;&gt; This commandment have I received of my father. &gt;&gt; In Philippians chapter 2 and verse 10, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven, of things in earth, of things under the earth. Acts 4 and verse 10. Be it known unto all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus, Christ of Nazareth, whom you have crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by him this man stand before you whole. This is the stone that setth the naught of the builders, which has become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is none other name given in heaven given among men whereby we must be saved. &gt;&gt; There's not another living God on the earth &gt;&gt; that could pay the price of redemption for you. &gt;&gt; I don't care what rock you pray to. &gt;&gt; I don't care what statue you kiss. I don't care how many rosary beads. Let me just say this you. My Jesus is alive and well tonight. I declare to you one more time. We have an empty tomb. &gt;&gt; He did not need to buy the tomb. All he needed to do was borrow the tomb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wasn't going to be there very long. &gt;&gt; He looked at what the word said. &gt;&gt; Destroy this temple and in 3 days I'll raise it up again. &gt;&gt; When he walked to Lazarus's tomb, when he walked to Lazarus's tomb, who was who's was his friend? He said, "Roll away the stone." You better know who you are. &gt;&gt; You better know who you are when you step out by that kind of faith. &gt;&gt; He not only knew who he was, but he had power. &gt;&gt; That's how powerful this message is. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God overseas. And he's standing there before all of those Hindu and Muhammad gods. &gt;&gt; And he's standing there. He's had a vision of this blind man before him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he stops. He's had a vision of this man's eyes coming open. &gt;&gt; He said, "Which of your gods can come and heal this man?" &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people make boast they can't back up. &gt;&gt; They can tell you how great their their God is. Well, back it up. I want to tell you, my God's never been in a crisis. &gt;&gt; My God has never been bankrupt. &gt;&gt; He has never broke one promise. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Men may disappoint you, but my God has never disappointed me one time. He's never turned his back on me. Not one time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Roll away the stone. &gt;&gt; Lazarus no doubt was fellowshipping with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he was talking to them about what it was like to be with Jesus as he was baptized. And Abraham Abraham said, "I met him as &gt;&gt; Melazdc, &gt;&gt; and after I met him, I turned young again. It was amazing to my community, but he told me I was going to have a son, not as an old man. And Sarah, she doubted and she laughed. Isn't that right, Sarah? And Sarah said, "Yeah, I laughed in the tent. I couldn't believe it would happen to me, but after he left and I realized my revelation of the promise, that promise was not only for you, but it was also for me." And I began to grasp a hold of it in my life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And one morning we woke up. &gt;&gt; And my hair was new and my teeth was new and my body was too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's my God. That's my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No doubt Lazarus could tell some testimonies of what he was beginning to see. And he said, "Hang on, boys. I hear a voice." Brother said that voice be to circle in that realm &gt;&gt; and it be to go out in that realm and death could not hold on to him anymore &gt;&gt; and Lazarus be to respond to that voice. &gt;&gt; I love these words. &gt;&gt; Loose him. Loose him. &gt;&gt; Loose him and let him go. &gt;&gt; I declare unto you tonight, you don't need those grave clothes. &gt;&gt; You might have been dead in trespasses and sin and your life may have seem been buried and you thought you had no hope, but Jesus came in this meeting and he called for you. Satan, you can't have his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, dig those grave clothes off of your children. Dig them off. Dig them off. Dig them off. There's some change that's going on. Dig them off. Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Jesus is on his way to your house tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me a moment just to relish in this. &gt;&gt; It was December the 30th. I was awakened by a dream. In this dream, dreams operate a little bit different than visions. In this dream, I I saw myself, brother Tim Puit, other ministers, and brother Ed Biscll together. We were at the end of the meeting, and we was all standing having our pictures taken. We were just relishing in what a great meeting that we had. We were just talking about his presence and what a great thing that was happening. Then that dream swapped and it went to memorial service and Timothy Puit was preaching. I am the resurrection and I am the life. I am the resurrection and I am the life. Then it's twitch scenes again. Brother Tim Puit, we were in a a large audience and he calls out to me and he says, "I have a best friend here in the building. His name is Brother Ron Spencer." He said, "Brother Ron," he said, "Oh, thou suffering, stand and be healed." Amen. &gt;&gt; In that moment, I woke up and I just began to lift my hands and I got up out of bed and the presence that's in this room right now was in my room &gt;&gt; and I begin to worship the Lord. Before long, my my my English went into a heavenly language &gt;&gt; and I begin to worship the Lord in that presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; Soon it was over. I I wrote it down real quickly. Later in the day, I would send it I would send it to brother Tim. We would make comments backwards and forwards. You see, four weeks before that, I'd had a heart attack. And I was thinking this is my my healing that God was going to heal me. Then I would have my son-in-law Dave Breeden. It was during the winter and we had what we call black ice and he hit a patch of black ice and it literally wrapped his tree his his truck around a tree and it pinned David be between the door the seat and that tree. It crushed his shoulder. It crushed all the back of his shoulder, front of his shoulder. It crushed his ribs. It crushed his back, five different vertebraes. It crushed his pelvis to where the doctor said, "We've never seen a pelvis crush this much." And then it crushed his knee as well. I would go to the doctor an hour later not knowing all of that was going on and I would sit Andrew my son was with me and we sat in the doctor's office and Andrew's giving me sermon reports he's he's telling me daddy you believe daddy you believe daddy you believe you believe you speak it we're going to believe it and that doctor came in with a declaration he said yep you had a heart attack. He said, "But you have zero damage." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "What we've got to do is make sure that you don't have another one." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I thought, "Well, this might be my dream." Saturday morning, I get word that my mother's sick. My mother's very nauseated. Now, it becomes beyond nausea. and they take her to a hospital. In a couple of hours, they're rushing her to a big hospital. I live about two hours away from them. I have service that afternoon. Davey's in the point of could go either way. Now, my mother's in a point of could go either way. After coming home from service that evening, just the spirit of the Lord spoke to me. Go to your mother's side. I told Andrew, I called Andrew, "Can you go?" And he said, "Dad, I'll go with you in the morning. You just tell me what time." And so we picked a time to leave. And we got in the car and just something spoke out of me. Today is going to change her life. And they begin to send us word before we got there that she's coding and she's in very bad shape. She's just barely hanging on. Brother Tim Puit sent me a note and he said, "Brother Ron, your dream is getting ready to happen." &gt;&gt; And I ran down the hallway when I arrived and doctors met me in the hallway and said, "There's just no hope. There's just no nothing more that we can do for her. She has told us she does not want to be resuscitated." I didn't know what I was walking into, but my mother was a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to report to you, you would not want to you would not want to wrestle with her about whether brother Brandham was a prophet or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You probably wouldn't want to bring up no bad opinions of Brother Brandham to my little mother. &gt;&gt; You see, she had a Bible completely full of checks. &gt;&gt; And she had read where brother Brandham said, "Write the check out." And she just didn't have one check. She had thousands of checks inside of there. Every one of them were cashed. &gt;&gt; This message is real. &gt;&gt; You come too late to tell me that this ain't the truth. &gt;&gt; This message is more than books and tapes and tracks. This message is a living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. My mama could whisper in prayer and shake the kingdom of hell. &gt;&gt; I walked in and the first words I heard. They asked her said, "Are you in any pain?" She said, "Oh, I'm fine." And the nurse turned around and knows I was standing there. She said, "Even in death, she's fine." said, "That's the sweetest person we've ever worked on." I got the opportunity about 10 seconds to talk to my mom. Wouldn't give you $10 million for what that conversation was like. She talked to me like we were having a casual day. Andrew's at home tonight and she said, she said these words, "I love you. I love you. I love you." She told Andrew, "I love you. I'll see you a little later." &gt;&gt; The doctors jumped in where we standing. They held her hand. No, I'm not in pain. I'm not in pain. Mrs. Spencer, do you know that do you know that uh if we don't if we don't resuscitate you, you you're going to die? And she looked up in their eyes and she said, "I'm ready to go." &gt;&gt; And in that moment, she went amazing. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, that sounds difficult. Hollywood can't write it like that. My mom does not suffer with a heart condition no more. &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to worry about her blood pressure no more. The message that she lived by, she could die by. &gt;&gt; My son-in-law would go through surgery after surgery after surgery after surgery. But we never heard one negative word. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. &gt;&gt; Stop your whining. &gt;&gt; Stop worshiping the disease that you got a hoe of. &gt;&gt; Take God at his word. &gt;&gt; Quit worshiping that devil. How it has control over your life. My God's greater than that disease. &gt;&gt; He's greater than heart disease. He's greater than cancer. He's greater than every disease that there is. as it would be. He would be off off of work in rehabilitation until the first day of this senior camp. He went to work Thursday. That's pretty needed. cuz I believe it was the same God that was there with that little girl in Memphis who was blind &gt;&gt; and she said, "If you can get me to the healer, I'll find my daddy." &gt;&gt; Georgia Carter laid in a bed for over nine years and everybody around her doubted, but she read a book that gave her faith. And one day the physician walked into the room and she didn't have to lay there another day like that. &gt;&gt; Oh, let the doctor come to your room tonight. &gt;&gt; Listen to the prophet of God. How many times has he sat in the seat with you? How many times has he stood with you in the hours of your trials and your troubles and you didn't realize it? How many times was he at the wheel when you almost was killed in an accident or you just dodged that accident or something and you didn't recognize it was him? How he was set was with you. He said when the barrel was empty and the cruise was dry and there was nothing for the babies. How that that man come through and set them groceries down at the door. Whatever it was, that was Christ. He is alive today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I declare unto you, he is on his way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is on his way to where you are. &gt;&gt; I want to declare unto you that Satan knows. &gt;&gt; Satan knows that he's on his way &gt;&gt; and all of his devils lined up in hell cannot stop him. He's greater than the army in Russia. He's greater than all the Pope's challenges. He's greater than North Korea. He's greater than every government. He's greater than every leotan devil that has got you bound tonight. My God is greater than that. Listen, brother Brandon, pray. Satan, you can't hold them no more. &gt;&gt; They're God's children right now. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing that before you. You have to take your hand off of their life. They belong to God. I claim them for now. I claim them as trophies of Christ's love for Calvary. I challenge you to a debate. You don't have any legal power. You have no power over them. You didn't have it in the first place. You was only bluffing them. You was only bluffing them. Christ stripped you of everything that you had at Calvary. He stripped you of every power that you ever had. And you're nothing but a bluff. And we've called your bluff. &gt;&gt; He said he took him up on a mountain. and he set him down and he rebuked him again and again. He said the word defeated Satan with the word of God, showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan with thus sayeth the Lord. It is written. It is written. It is written. If the devil has told you that you're nobody, that you're the weakest one in the room, I got a quote for you. The weakest one in this building is more powerful than every devil that is in hell. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54, Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals into fire, and bringeth forth an instrument for his work. I have created the waster to destroy. No weapon. &gt;&gt; No weapon &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee shall prosper. &gt;&gt; Brother Rod, but you don't know what I've been facing over the last days. No weapon. Say it with me. &gt;&gt; This is your service. No weapon that is formed against me shall prosper, &gt;&gt; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Come on, church. Here's the way I look at this. that every devil that hounds me, &gt;&gt; every devil that hounds me and knocks and frails and torments me, I just take down its name. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, just take down its name. And I take it before Papa God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I take it before Papa God and I title tell Papa God, "This devil's been picking on me." Hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to remember one scripture. If you never get this concept in your mind, I can do all things. &gt;&gt; I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. I can do all things. The devil tells you you can't do it. I got news for you. I got a promise from God. I'll believe God over every devil that's in hell. I can do all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's passed out by now. Sister Melody standing up back there back there with her arms raised up. There was a time that she had been t-boned in an accident and she was going to therapy five times a week. &gt;&gt; And I preached a meeting for her father &gt;&gt; and I was sitting in the car after a service and she was standing through glass doors and something spoke to me. Go in and pray for her. &gt;&gt; Go in and pray for her. And I walked in and I said, "Sister Melanie, God just spoke to me to come in here to pray for you." Her family was having to do a lot of her work for her. She was doing the best that she could do. But God being rich in mercy came on the scene and touched her life and healed her from the crown of her head to the soles of her feet. Stand up, Sister Millie. I'm not done yet. She was going through a great trial. Her daddy called me and I was sitting on the 10th floor in the Ramada Hotel in in in Jeffersonville, Kentucky. Jeffersonville, Indiana, Kentucky. God help me. And he was telling me about a situation that was she was in. And we talked about 30 minutes on that situation. I was looking at the bridge that everybody wants to fight about. &gt;&gt; But let me just take you a little further than everybody's fight. &gt;&gt; I told Brother Kelly, I said, "Brother Kelly, I want to give you a word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; When she gets through this trial, God's going to give her a husband. in five weeks. Five. Come on in the house. &gt;&gt; This is faster than you, boy. &gt;&gt; In five days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In five days, &gt;&gt; God gave her a prince. &gt;&gt; Boo devil. Oh, brother Ron, you're getting excited. We got something to get excited about. children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; Can you say it with me? Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Greater is he that is in me. Hallelujah. Isaiah 40 verse 29. He gives power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength. Even to the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount upon wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that you can have. &gt;&gt; Prayer has atomic power to it. Prayer changes things. Prayer changes the mind of God. Moses prayed and the greatest army in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Drowned. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, it's proven by science that that didn't happen. Well, it's amazing that the greatest army in the whole world drowned in kneedeep water. But no, God opened up the Red Sea so wide that 2 million people could go across in dry land. &gt;&gt; And then their slave masters and their governors and their king and their tormeners all ran inside of that and they became fish food. Daniel prayed and the lions laid down. Those same lions would later eat and devour the same people that had tried to destroy Daniel. &gt;&gt; Elijah prayed and being an older man got so anointed of God, he ran 40 miles and he outrun the fastest horses in all of Israel. Prayer works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is that uncircumcised devil? Who is that devil that has no relationship with God at all? Who is that devil that stands with nothing but a defeated thing behind him? His master was defeated at Calvary by our Lord and conqueror. He's a bluff. He said we won't believe him anymore. Down with him. Jesus Christ robbed Satan of everything that he had. He's full principalities and powers and dominion. And his dominion reigns over the heavens and earth. And we're subject to his domain. Hallelujah. And that puts him where he belongs. The devil down there and Christ the victor up there. You're David's. &gt;&gt; You're called, elected, anointed, positionally placed, and put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Goliath, you are defeated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; In the control of human beings, there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen junk bomb as powerful at prayer. Prayer will change the mind of God. &gt;&gt; I want to declare to you one more time, he is not dead, but he is alive. &gt;&gt; He has the keys to death and hell and the grave. &gt;&gt; I want to quote the prophet of God tonight. House of hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus walked to Lazarus's tomb and then he be to worship. Let me just share some worship with you tonight. &gt;&gt; You know, people get excited at a ball game and they don't think there's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; They get excited at political rallies and they think there's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; But when people come to church, the devil will whisper in your ear. That's emotion. That's emotion. Well, let me just tell you this. There's where too many steelborns are. &gt;&gt; They have no life on the inside of them. Oh, if the great doctor could tonight could take us and give us a little breath smack and wake us up tonight and bring us to life, our cry would be unto Almighty God, let it live. Let it live. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prayer is more than a one-way dimension, but it's another dimension where you start worshiping back to God. Sometimes it's a lost art, but we are to call to worship back to God. Trees have leaves to worship to God. The grass, the flowers, they worship God. The birds, the animals, they begin to worship God and they sing and they sing and they sing. They don't get embarrassed about us being around. They just continue singing unto God. &gt;&gt; Whether it's a hummingbird or a mighty eagle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God loves to hear your voice. This book's full of promises. &gt;&gt; He's just waiting for you to take your spot. &gt;&gt; To take your position, to speak to your mountain, to speak to your giant. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I stand here commissioned this service. &gt;&gt; In January, we were driving down the highway to hearing your pastor preach. Brother Ed was speaking in a January meeting and it came to a certain spot and that certain spot I said, "Andrew, roll that back. I want to hear it again." He rolled it back and I listened to it again. I said, "Roll it back and let me listen to it again." He rolled it back and let me listen to it again. And he said, "What are you listening to, Daddy?" I said, "Listen, I want to listen to it again." I said, "Brother Ed's sick. He's sick. He's preaching. He's sick." We went to prayer. when I went to Switzerland with him and these brothers and he took the Sunday morning service. And as he preached, I could just feel it. I could feel what was going on. Somebody came up, I don't know who it was, Brother David, you might know who it was, came up on this side and had prayer. Another one came up to have prayer. Before long, there was a group of people that came up to have prayer. Another one came up to have prayer. This one came up to have prayer. And he came and he prayed on this side. And something just nudged me. Take him off the stage. And I stepped up. I stepped up beside him trying not to be irreverent. Brother Glenn, you were there. And I whispered in his ear, "It's time to go. And we took him and I didn't say a word to him. We went all the way up the steps and went to his room and he said, "Won't you come in?" Who can refuse Brother Ed? Who can refuse him? Won't you come in and we just talk? We don't get much of a chance to talk. And I said, "No, because I love you. I want you to rest knowing what I felt. A few weeks ago, he called me. He said, "Will you have prayer for me?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I went to prayer. I went to prayer and the presence of God dropped where we was at. I don't know how many miles away, 3,000 miles away, but that same angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; came down. &gt;&gt; I let him tell you what all happened in that prayer. But God came on the scene. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I came off of that off of that prayer, out of that out of that that event that took place and God dropped this sermon in my heart. &gt;&gt; Satan, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; you can't take his life. Who are you, brother Ron? I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I could care less if you know my name. I could care less what you think of me. I am a son of God. I believe there's sons of gods in this building tonight that can look the devil right square in the eyes and say, "I've had enough of you. It's at the end of a trial we should rejoice. I have a right to rejoice. I've given you list after list of things that Satan's tried to thwart the children of God and we have become overcomers. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to need an example of I'm going to need an if God gives me strength for about three more minutes. Hallelujah. It's the best workout human beings ever had. Satan, I want you to listen as well. Children of God, I want you to be with me. &gt;&gt; We are a team. &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Psalms 150. Praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts. Praise him for his excellent greatness. Praise him on the sound of a t trumpet. Praise him with a saucery and a harp. Praise him with a timal and a dance. Praise him with a string instruments and organs. Praise him upon the loud sounding symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Let everything that hath breath Let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all you lands. Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that he is the Lord. He is God. It is he that hath made us, not we ourselves. We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name. For the Lord, he is good. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Let your voices cry out to your circumstances tonight. Glory. Glory, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; glory and power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is here. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, I'd have liked to been in a prayer line with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I'm not brother Brandham, but the same angel of the Lord's in the building right now. &gt;&gt; I am nothing, but Jesus Christ is everything. &gt;&gt; Throw your scarecrows away right now and defy the demon powers out of hell. I would refuse to listen to the devil another day. I would refuse to go home slave to those sweetnesses in your life. I would declare today that today is my jubilee day. I am a slave no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe it's time because brother Ron opened the service said, "He's always on time. &gt;&gt; He's always on time." And I believe he's on time right now. So, I looked up a quote and I was thinking there was a little lady that said, "When is it my time? When is it my time?" All of a sudden, that prophet turned around and said, "This time is your time." Hallelujah. This is your hour. This is your night. This is your time. Amen. People can walk out, but God is here to deliver you tonight. Whatever your situation is, Jesus, come on the scene now. Confirm your word with signs following. Satan, you cannot have her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, if you would line up here, please listen to that prophet say that presence and that angel that is with me on that platform tonight is not only for this generation. He said it is for generations to come. And I stood up and said, "Brother Ron, Brother Ron, it's going to be tonight. This generation is going to have a visitation with that same angel that was with the prophet. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe it's your time tonight? Is he always on time? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Ella, why don't you make your way, honey? Why don't you make your way? Always on time. He's on time every time. That's right, sister. This is your hour. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And if there's anybody else that would like to come and have prayer right now, you come here tonight. You make your way. the brothers will help you. Amen. And if you don't need prayer, well, you stay in there and you start praying with us. But I believe God is here to deliver, to set free, to heal, to move. Amen.

Glory. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. all night. &gt;&gt; Wow. It is a night time. Ah. The brothers came up where he said, "We're we're going to have a three." I said, "There we're going to be you guys are going to be praying forever." I said, "Man," I said, "I prayed Brother Lou in China. We had what, brother Lou? Where are you?" &gt;&gt; Here. Here. H how long of a prayer line did we pray for? &gt;&gt; 5 hours. &gt;&gt; 5 hours. &gt;&gt; Okay, brother Murphy and I stand there, brother Luke for 5 hours. &gt;&gt; So if you think that this was a long prayer line, think again. But our God is tremendous. &gt;&gt; Whether it's in Canada, United States, China, the same God that meets them over there is the same God that is in this tent tonight. Glory. Amen. The gifts are in the body. It's not a one-man ministry. It's a body ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the wonderful thing, Brother Nathan. The thing's finished. It's over. It's gone.

Is Leah still here? I want to sing the bloodline. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to sing in that bloodline. I've got that on my iPod or whatever they call it podcast. I play it over and over and over because I keep on telling the devil, you can't cross this bloodline. Do we know it well enough? Brother Ryan, you do too. Leah, is she here? No. you. I'm sure she's going to come up here because she's going to have a victory in her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have words for it or no words for it? Well, I'll sing it with you. Good all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I I was listening to a tape today. Brother Bram said as he came to the platform, he said, "The angel of the Lord is standing right here on the platform." And I thought, "Well, he's just going to go into discernment." An angel of the Lord waited until brother Brandham was finished. 35 minutes he started to preach a message. Now he says, "Now that same angel is still here right now." &gt;&gt; Jesus doesn't go. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; And we're basking in the presence of God. Are we going to sing it? by the rank. Want to tell you Satan, you can't cross the blood because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stand and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, we can't cross the bloodline. Sing it again. &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the blood line. by his blood. You will find you're going to lose tonight. Remember, you can't cross the bloodline. Even though my spirit's low and it seems I can't hardly go, but still I see &gt;&gt; victory. Many times I'm walking by faith. I can't see what lies before me, but still I see victory. And I just got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline. because I'm covered by his blood. So you may stand and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. So remember, you can't cross the blood line. Sometimes the battle gets hot and it seems we're fighting along. But I remember I'm standing on that rock. No, Satan. If I were you, I'd turn around and give that to cuz I do believe you're going to lose. And I just want to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stand and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. So remember, you can't cross the bloodline. And I just want to tell you, Satan, you can't cross the blood line because I'm covered by his blood. And you may stand and you may fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Cuz remember, you can't cross the blood line. I'm happy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm happy &gt;&gt; for you. &gt;&gt; I'm so happy to see what God has done for all of us today. Well, if this was a meeting, and it was a meeting, &gt;&gt; it was a real meeting, Brother Sam. &gt;&gt; Amen. This was a meeting. &gt;&gt; What's tomorrow going to hold? &gt;&gt; And I just want to want to say something to you, saints. That isn't uh I hate to say just a a message is put together. That's a life history. That's years of hardship, heartache, a man's that had been molded by fire. And then understanding other men that are being molded by fire, and then standing here and proclaiming to you to the devil himself, the devil can't have your pastor. That was a message from heaven for you. Amen. Amen. We love him. We love Sister Ruth. We love the effect of the gospel through their lives. And now we're going to hold them in high esteem and however we're going to give them their space and their time. But we thank God because this wouldn't even have happened if the one man wouldn't had the vision. &gt;&gt; And I thank God for men of vision for one man, our pastor. Tomorrow morning at 10:00 10:00 tomorrow morning, I know there will be a fight for the front seat. I believe we'll start at the front and work our way back. I don't think that that's really a problem here. Never been. May God grant to you not only tonight, but now you walk in it. Now you confess it and you speak it. &gt;&gt; It's not a mind game. &gt;&gt; It's a heart game. &gt;&gt; A faith. &gt;&gt; I have spoken that, Billy. You spoke that thing. You walked down that line and you told these brothers, men of God, it's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you might as well say it's over again. It's just over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; Finished. &gt;&gt; I'm a new man. &gt;&gt; I'm a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, musicians, thank you. brothers that have been around here, thank you that you be able to send this.

You are so merciful to us, oh God. So mindful of us, Lord. We are not in ourselves deserving of the least of your mercies. But Lord, you found in your great mind that we would be worthy, that you would shed your own blood on our behalf and pay for every redemptive blessing that we would have need of, Lord. that you would ascend up on high and you would give gifts unto men and to some apostles and to some prophets and to some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers. Your love gifts to your body, oh God. And we give you all the praise and all the honor and all the glory. We thank you for brother Ron. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, how he's labored, how he's given himself. And there's one more service. Lord, we're asking that you'll pour in a special portion for him, Lord, that we might have some more from you tomorrow. I guess in this way, Lord, we're a little bit greedy. We want more of you. We want more of your love. We want more of your grace. We want more of your blessings, Lord. We want it to just overflow in our lives until, Lord, the cup cannot contain all that you give to us. We thank you, Lord, for your goodness and your mercies to us, Lord. Thank you for this service. Lord, I'm mindful of those that couldn't be here tonight cuz my own wife would love to be here, but she couldn't be here. Lord, we commit all that are out on the internet, &gt;&gt; different ones, Lord, that wish they were in the prayer line. strengthen it. &gt;&gt; May your healing &gt;&gt; be upon each one of them. &gt;&gt; We love them, Lord. And we pray, Lord, that you'll just continue to move on through the night. May you be in our dreams. May you be with us as we gather tomorrow, whether here, whether those that cannot cross the border, if they gather at the church, Lord, over on the internet in different places. Lord, gather us together again tomorrow morning, unless, Father, you choose to take us home. That would be the great gathering. Lord, we commit this service to you. Grant each one a good night's sleep. Grant safety upon the roads, Lord, and a good night's rest. We commit all to you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The kitchen has prepared something for the campers that are on camp. So those that are off camp, just make your way quietly. If you want to linger here, that's fine. But when you're finished, just make your way off grounds. That will be great. And then for the counselors in your cabins, if you want to make your way up to the kitchen, that would be fine. Tomorrow's morning in people is 10:00. And we want to bless the servant of God. I know we only have one table here with the offering envelopes. We should have had it at two doors, but forgive us for that. I want you to come prepared because we're going to take an offering up for tomorrow morning just for brother Ron Spencer. And I want to say to you, an ox is worthy of its labor. That was a labor tonight. So remember, tomorrow you're giving in worship. You're dismissed. God bless you all. Good night. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glorious Jesus.
