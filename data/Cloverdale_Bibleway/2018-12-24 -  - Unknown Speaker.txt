Hildebrandt since his love and greetings to the church brother Andrew Dodd is there on the right he's assisting brother Harold and so the Lord willing he'll be his family will be with us next weekend and on the Friday night we had a young people's meeting in a home brother Hildebrandt's home this is just a couple photos of that and then they were inspired by our church and the young people singing so that last Sunday afternoon in between services they went to old folks home and encouraged the people that were there was singing I just think that's wonderful I really really do and this was our church some of our people yesterday afternoon just up the road here singing for the glory of God young people and old people I really appreciate that sister Ellen is there on the top with her hands raised thanking God and and I think I'll go back I missed one photo here's brother Roger Lessard and he was in the hospital a few days ago brother Tom and I visited him and now I saw him standing outside praise the Lord he goes from ICU to being a testimony I think that's wonderful god bless you brother Roger feeling better hey man that's wonderful thank you lord this was last night in London area some of the families and people couraging and singing for the glory of God I just wanted you to know that this is the season in time when it's a good time to give out and be a blessing and God bless you I saw you brother Nathan almost all of those photos and I think that's good hey man she keeps shining the light and tonight is the last service before Christmas and we just want to make the Lord encourage you tonight we stand again and turn right to the scripture Psalms chapter 89 if we could turn to two places thank you brother Derek it's hard to say see you next year but hey man it's good we'll see one another again him in Psalms 89 and then Matthew chapter 1 I think it's good to look at one another as gifts and be thankful amen do you agree with that and let's be happy as we see one another brother Marcos here all the way from Paradise California in the last few days and he's going back there I understand we just never know what's going to happen in our lives there was a brother I'll just say this as you're standing just a Wednesday night before last he was in the service down at brother Tim Pruett church for the Whistler really fine brother sits on the second row right row brother sterling sitting and I saw him raising his hands and worshiping God on the Wednesday night and by the Thursday morning he'd had a stroke and he had went to where he wasn't really a lot coherent and he passed away this last Wednesday morning and I thought from one week to the next week can have a brother or sister right in our church or it could be a family member and they could just be right among us and within just a few days they could be gone we want to make sure that we treasure one another and make sure that our offerings to one another is something that we appreciate so god bless you tonight we appreciate you Psalms chapter 89 verse 50 these are verses brother Branham read and a message Christmas message Psalms 89 verse 50 remember Lord the reproach of thy sir servants how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people where with nine enemies have reproached Oh Lord wherewith have they reproached the footsteps of thine anointed but David didn't stop there he said blessed be the Lord forevermore amen and amen and tonight we'd like to speak on from reproach to a new born faith so let's turn to Matthew chapter 1 kind of a family night's sermon for us sermon before Christmas there's something real though that the Lord can give to the family Matthew chapter 1 verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother as you just listen really closely there's a lot of paradoxes in these verses when as his mother Mary was espoused or engaged to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and brother Branham stops and he spoke about how they were engaged they were espoused but the Bible says they were married and thy husband and thy wife so engagements very serious it's not something to be taken lightly verse 21 and she she shall bring forth a son thou shalt call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin this is Isaiah 7 a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us God with us hallelujah then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus amen can we bow our heads our dear Heavenly Father we're so thankful that we have the truth of Christmas that you wasn't born in December but you were born like all lambs in the springtime but this was the season of the year that your prophet was led by the Holy Ghost to speak so many Christmas messages it was bringing the truth to the bride that it's not Jesus in a little manger but it's Jesus in our hearts Lord the world is going crazy even tonight in darkness as we heard this morning but there's a little bride that has a light the Star of Bethlehem is still shining bright the house is still full of God's bread the water is still clear there's still strength and and comfort in the presence of God Lord made tonight service be encouraging to the family at this time of the year when so many are together maybe with loved ones and family but we realize on this December 23rd Sunday evening when so many are canceling tonight's service but brother Tom brother Bisco felt to have this meeting I believe it's good Lord because there's many among us that we are their family I pray for them tonight that is who the service is reaching out for that you have not forgotten them those that labor among us throughout the year and maybe seem little or those that maybe are discouraged those that might be weary this is the reason for the service tonight I pray that you would bring it from a time of just a reproach and a hard time and turn it around and may there be new born faith may there be a freshness and an encouragement within the assembly that as we shout hallelujah praise the Lord and rejoice that the Holy Ghost could come to our souls could heal our bodies could cause our spirits to come to a rest and a Shalom that all is well Lord we praise you tonight God may the darkness of this Laodicea hour be split with the voices of angels and the sounds of singing and the glories to God would not be just words of music sang this time of year but may it be a revelation in our souls moving back Satan moving back the darkness moving back evil spirits that tonight service could be a time when you would come among us in a special way be born tonight within our lives in a new born faith in Jesus name Amen god bless you can have your seats amen nice to have brother Kyle and sister Christina you are a gift to us we love your family we dearly love you brother Kyle and well he could have spoke tonight but we're standing here hey man and Oh God's gifts always find their places tonight we want to take this thought under inspiration from reproach to new born faith and it comes from the message we have seen his star and come to worship Him brother branham spoke that after the seals in 63 he said a prophet or a seer don't go to sleep but he sees the angel standing there the other man just goes to sleep and he sees the angel talking about Joseph the angel said Joseph there isn't no riddle there's nobody there that can interpret it for you so I'm gonna tell you about it I'm gonna make it real to you because there's nobody there that can make it real don't fear to take Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and brother Branham said then when Joseph rose from his sleep oh how his heart must have been full of newborn faith that's where we get our title tonight newborn faith it was because God dealt with his life that mystery that had bothered him that something that he wanted to believe but that something that he dared to believe but it was so unusual yet was made known to him by a dream new faith sprung up into his life brother Brown said oh my he had faith in God he had faith in his wife then so before then it was a question before then it was a mystery before then he was a brother about in his 40s that was about ready to put away a teenage young lady in the message because this had never happened before that a virgin would conceive but from a moment of him putting her away to the next few moments he's embracing her as his wife you say what happened in between God dealt was his life and tonight we want to take you as a believer and put you into the story because we're all in a journey tonight and this message inand given your life to Christ many times there is a great reproach there's a great scorn and there's a great misunderstanding but tonight we want to leave that reproach and we want to turn to a newborn faith because Joseph came out of this experience with faith sprung up in his life he was already a righteous man he was already a just man so I'm not speaking about newborn meaning like a baby being born we're not talking about a baby in a manger and I'm not just speaking about the new birth this is something that happens to a believer that there's certain questions in your life or times of loneliness or times of fear or situations you find yourself in that God deals with our hearts with a newborn faith and something Springs out of your life but the Branham said he had faith in God he had faith in his wife then both faith in God and love for his wife and love and the one that he loved and there's no more question no more question about it he knew that was the angel of the Lord he knew that God had revealed to him just exactly the question that was in his mind so all the questions was gone I thought maybe if there's anyone here that has questions in your life the the angel of the Lord could minister to you tonight in God's gifts always find their places brother Branham said Joseph couldn't understand it it was just too unusual he was a good man nothing wrong with him he was a good man a just man but it was so unusual brother Branham said Joseph probably 40 years old 45 something like that they claimed when he and Mary was engaged but here we find something that had never had happened a man espoused to this man sorry a woman espoused to this man and yet found to be with a mother it was so unusual Joseph was minded to put her away but right at that crucial moment God sent his angel and appeared to him in a dream and said don't fear to take to thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and brother Branham stops and he says what a newborn faith Joseph must have had when she rose up from there so he's already a believer he's already a just man where the brand said nothing wrong with Joseph but there was nothing wrong with Mary in fact tonight I wanted to bring before you it had never happened before that time and it's never happened physically since that time that a virgin would bring forth a child she went from bearing a reproach of people calling her a prostitute and don't even be near her and whoever she would bring forth with it would be an unclean saying - having a revelation this is of God and she didn't tear then what nobody thought and Joseph brother branham said when she rose up from there what a newborn faith he had see he never had need of any interpretation the dream wasn't in symbols it was right straight out don't fear to take Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost there was no prophet to give the interpretation so it had to come directly right straight like that from God to Joseph God just bypass all the medium people tonight it's from God to the bride and there's gonna be a bride on the earth that does exactly what Joseph did when he heard the word he got right up and married Mary all the reproach was gone he went from putting her away privately and we don't want to embarrass her to marrying her openly saying I'm proud to be the father of the Messiah we're going to go into that just a little bit tonight I think it'll mean something to you so this word newborn let's just look at it for a little bit it means something fresh so coming from a reproach we'll talk about that in just a few minutes a reproach to a newborn faith means something fresh has happened in your experience something that a person already has but it was like something was reborn or born again it gives them a fresh start it gave Joseph fire to move forward it took all the questioned away about what God thinks about it and tonight maybe you've had a question maybe there's a question in your heart can any good come out of Nazareth or how could God do this in a teenager she's just a teenager in the message we're gonna go from little babies tonight to teenagers all the way up to men and women in their 80s Simeon and Anna so it doesn't matter your age I said it doesn't matter your age when God comes on the scene and when the supernatural takes place the bride responds to that and so no matter what is negative or bad in your life that's taken place no matter what scoffing and reproach that or scorn that you're bearing for the cause of Christ tonight God has given you strength by His Word you can bear that tonight you can stand the reproach of the word we're gonna look into the scripture and look at some examples in the message of men and women and believers that stood the reproach of the word in their day and it's so easy to look back and why that's wonderful and thank God for that so easy to look forward and say that's gonna be wonderful and that's gonna be good it's so difficult to look right where we're at but that's what we need to do tonight it's not looking back it's not just looking forward it's aimed this Christmas God give me a revelation God give one another and our family a revelation and I believe it would really lift our spirits and lift our hearts this Christmas may this service be a gift for some of you to know that we all are bearing a reproach at some level being a Christian is to be part of the minority we are a minority tonight so rather than taking that in the bad part it's good to look at the Christmas story and look at all of the ones that were faithful throughout that and say you know what they bore a reproach we're in the minority but rather than pulling the victim card turn it around and let it be a new born faith let something spring out of you like a freshness rather than looking at it it's so bad say thank you Jesus you've chosen my womb you've chosen my life you're looking at my situation I need a newborn faith Joseph was a good person Mary was a good young lady but this fresh start or this fire to move forward came after the angel appeared to them so when we speak about newborn tonight it's not speaking about just a baby being born or something being born like that like an infant but it's something that happens inside of a person to give them strength to give them vision it's something that happens in your journey you that have started out know what I'm talking about it's a newborn faith it's a vision and strength to move above the reproach let's go back to Psalms 89 together thank you brother Tom for having a Sunday night service so many churches are canceling tonight and it's so wonderful in the message that we have the family of God and to know that we're not alone take strength from services like this it means the ministry is not forgotten you we have not forgotten you we're here to stand with you some of you might not know but when we travel as ministers like we did last weekend there's times during a service during the meeting we'll give your testimonies without giving your name we'll speak about a young lady or a young man or a family in our church or a brother and it 100 percent of the time the people respond and are so happy praise the Lord and hallelujah and maybe even clap because they see that themselves when they hear the word or they hear a message and then when they hear a testimony it just triggers and something in their heart in their testimony that God's alive and if he can do that for them he can do that for us and it's like a newborn energy and faith comes through their lives that's what we need this Christmas in Psalms 89 verse 52 52 these few verses are verses that brother Branham read and a Christmas message 56 years ago tonight December the 23rd 1962 but the Branham preached the reproach for the cause of the word in Jeffersonville and he talked about how it's a very strange Christmas text but the Sunday before he had preached on the world falling apart and he says I want to speak on the reproach for the cause of the word and he read this scripture in Psalms 89 verse 50 actually had him read it again and repeated again remember Lord the reproach of thy servants how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people David is dealing with reproach where it could have been Ethan here and certain Psalm here the reproach verse 51 where with thine enemies have reproached Oh Lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed blessed be the Lord forevermore amen and amen a Christmas message on December the 23rd and brother Branham speaks this as a Christmas message on the reproach I have it here in front of me the reproach for the cause of the word I begin to look into that word of reproach means a reproached or to be reproached is like a disapproval to be disappointed to be the object of someone's disappointment to say I'm so disappointed in you hi we had such high thoughts and for your life and you are such a reproach to our family you are such a disappointment to your mother and I or to have a friend or a brother and sister a family member give you what the world would call a look of reproach means of disdain you look down on them it's like I'm putting up with you it's to be reproached is the word in the scripture is a thing that makes the failings of someone or something else more apparent or whenever you're around they're so convicted they're so condemned because whenever holiness is around it brings unholiness in a person another person to the surface and it makes it more apparent and it's like I just can't stand to be around you that's what a reproaches it could be in the family could be on the job or in the home some of you might experience it this week it's a disdain it's like a reproach is showing open district approval it can be like a disgrace or a discredit a source of shame to us or like a stain you're like a blot on family many believers have experienced that when they chose Christ did we not or embrace this message we realized that there's others that just don't see it the same as us and it causes a reproach I want to say this tonight and make it very clear to give your life to every Christ is to accept a reproach it's not an easy road and some of the elders should have could have been a little bit louder hey man we thought we thought it was gonna be so easy I thought if you gave your life to the Lord and we're in the Lord's army that this is gonna be a roar and a shout know many times you'll get more of disapproval there will be a discredit to you and a shame and a blot some of you've heard the phrase above reproach such as someone living above reproach that means there's no criticism that can be made of their lives but as believers we live in a land where we are reproached we are scorned we are criticized Jesus standing with Pilate and before those that were wanting to take his life didn't call a lawyer and he didn't try to use his cell phone or ask his disciples to get a lawyer he stood there like a lamb he was bearing the reproach they stripped off his clothes in shame it's like to be rebuked or reprimanded to be standing a reproach you're familiar with Isaiah 53 were the Bible prophesied of Christ and how there would be no beauty that we should desire him and the reason that I'm just speaking this for the next 2 or 3 minutes is to let you know that if that was the bridegroom part and were the bride we're gonna bear it all so you can bear it we're not avoiding it this Christmas we're not pagans like the world but we're not gonna put off an opportunity to thank the Lord for coming but when he came there was no beauty that we would desire him he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not and if you join yourself with him you're gonna be despised you're gonna be smitten on people's going to take you wrong and we're going to get into that and a little bit about some results of a reproach or Consequences that we all should count as familiar but we're here on family night to let one another know that you've either gone through that you're going through that or you will experience it in the future the more you give your life to Christ it's not an easy road there is a reproach there is a cross I'm going to take it deep here and then take us from a reproach to newborn faith there is a cross but there is a crown there is an earth but there is a glory there is a natural body but there's a celestial body so I'm taking you now into this maybe seemingly negative or bad side so that by the end of the service we can go into a new born faith and say yes I have that but I have this the Bible says about Jesus he was despised and rejected and he bore our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed this Christmas received the gift of healing just receive it open it up spread back the wrapping hallelujah it might be unexpected you're gay you're being given a gift tonight just take it there might be deliverance in that package there be joy in that package there might be a gift of forgiveness in that package you came to the service thinking you're gonna be rejected and God has given you justification that's a gift don't reject the gift because of how you see yourself and your attitude and what you've done when the word is saying I forgive you this Christmas I'm justifying you and if a person receives that revelation what a newborn faith what a faith would come out of that it's like a person laying dormant and all of a sudden being energized quicken they would come out of that Jesus was oppressed and afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment wow this is a wonderful Christmas message isn't it a reproach I'm dipping down into the reproach a little bit this was the little baby that came that grew up and was giving his life that they want him in a bit in a manger where they can hold him and the bride is same but I want him I want to be married to him what do I need to do to get all the way he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death and it goes on to speak about how it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief seen the travail of his soul talks about how he's bearing our iniquities this is Isaiah 53 therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors and bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors that was us that was all of us that was the reproach that came with bearing the name of Christ Lord this Christmas don't let us ignore what you're doing here clover to our Bible Way it's just the same as any other day people have looked back and they were looking back and looking at Isaiah and the priest was reading that in the temple and it was being read and then they missed him then people looking forward and what a day that's gonna be and it's gonna be wonderful when we get over yonder and then they ignore right in front of them the word that wants to be revealed and I say God this Christmas don't let us be so busy and distracted and worldly and caught up in the lights and the tinsel that we miss you miss you and our own lives miss you in one another amen don't let us make it a tradition and fail to see what God is doing can I speak about reproach a little bit more reproach too from a reproach to a newborn faith but a reproach is to be criticized to be reprimanded or blamed you are the one you always rain on our party you're never laugh at our jokes you you're all you never fit in and a real child of God it really hurts them but in their heart later they realize I don't fit in but rather than barren that as a man I just don't fit in what do I got to do to fit in take it as a newborn face tonight and say you know what God people have never fit in that's why God says I'm not gonna leave you here I'm gonna take you away hallelujah so when you are reproached and accused that means even scolded and rebuked you know you're not even in the message or you don't even believe in the Bible but in your heart you do for the Branham said a critical spirit will criticize so Paul and 2nd Timothy 3:12 I hope this is encouraging someone he said all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution that's just a wonderful Christmas message we'll all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution they don't want you they scoff at you they spit at you you're not part of the in-crowd and some of this persecution comes threefold number 1 it comes from the outside we're persecuted then there's a persecution from within and we know that bride don't persecute bride but there's still misunderstandings brother Branham preached on misunderstandings and he talked about that in questions even amongst us and things that go on all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and lastly third because of decisions we make or choices that we make that are not necessarily us operating in God's perfect will it's called a personal persecution that we go through and I want to stand here tonight and say this as a believer you can go through all three of them when you receive persecution from without you can stand that when it happens from within and misunderstandings you just make sure you're the one that is spiritual and has the Spirit of Christ and lastly when there's decisions and choices that are made in your life or in your family or in your career whatever in your experience and it shows that you haven't walked in God's perfect will and then there's persecution or there's a maybe a comeback from that you can stand that you can go through that none of these persecutions are excuses enough for a believer to throw in the towel hallelujah in this season in this hour in this rapture change season that the bride is going through a reproach for the word I want to encourage you tonight stand stand for the word and when you've done all to stand just keep standing and when it seems like the storms 2018 was a storm maybe field year for you but you're still standing you've bore it hallelujah I'm speaking tonight on standing the reproach of the word but that means bearing it you can bear it in the university in the college in the school you can bear the reproach you can be the one believer that makes it in the rapture out of that hellhole in your family when there's others that are in denominations or other people that are just totally worldly or when there's people within that say they believe but they act at certain times in maturely or inappropriately that's no reason for you to fall apart you just keep standing you just keep being Christ this is December 23rd and a prophet priests the reproach for the cause of the word I think that's an encouragement 56 years later that we can stand the reproach of the word and the cause of Christ are we together tonight let's go to Luke chapter 2 as we get in to the story further it's good to look at believers in the scripture and see them in their real life struggles this wasn't easy for Mary and Joseph I mean who in this building has ever brought forth a child without knowing a man if you're a sister I mean if you're a brother that has a family when was the last time you could say we had a family and we you know there wasn't anything natural to it it was just a supernatural thing it's all supernatural but I'm speaking about Isaiah a virgin shall conceive it had never happened so we have someone in our youth group a teenager that comes up pregnant everybody's quiet I'm talking about Mary and Jesus pure and his virgin and his holy and no one believes her in fact when she's sharing this with Elizabeth which was an elder sister and remembers that Cariah this is all this whole story I don't want to say story that it's not true a fiction but the whole thing surrounding Christmas ought to be edifying to the believer these are believers Mary Joseph Zechariah Elizabeth Simeon and Anna it's like knowing those that made it in the ark it's always very few each one of them had a reproach um all of a sudden an angel appears in Zechariah about his ministry and he doesn't believe it how could it happen to my wife were we're in our elder years and and God smote him dumb can you imagine a minister being dumb and I'm not talking mentally I'm speaking he cannot talk he cannot talk he that's that's his way of carrying out his duties and from that time he was dumb he couldn't speak yet right on the tablet he bore a reproach just like we Solon Thursday night it's like talk to me talk to me and he's just writing on a tablet come on talk to me it was like it used to be able to do this and now you can't do that what a reproach and they'd laugh at him he was a believer he was a believer Elizabeth was a believer but yet in her womb was a something that hadn't moved for months and she's talking to a teenager in the church and and the teenager says this is what's happened oh but you didn't invite me to the to the wedding are you and Joseph are married and no no we're not married and how can these things be and an angel appeared to me and she's just given her testimony and Elizabeth wants to believe it had never happened before but here's now Mary talking to this elder in the church sister Elizabeth and she wanted to believe but as soon as she got to the name his name shall be called Jesus all of a sudden something moves inside of Elizabeth something that had been dead or not moving a newborn faith struck it it was there but it came alive the promise was there remember the angel said you're gonna bring forth a son his name's gonna be John but it had been laying there with no life but at the sound of the name of Jesus I wonder if we can say Jesus tonight Jesus something move from death to life wouldn't that be wonderful that happened tonight say all brother John you said let's all say Jesus no at the name of Jesus it is but they all bore reproach they all Boris coughing it's like how can these things be now let's look here in in Luke chapter to verse 21 I think a week or two ago two weeks ago we read some of this I'm gonna go back in a few minutes to something brother Michael Ray spoke on and this is where this whole message stemmed from Luke 2:21 and when eight days were accomplished for their circumcising of the child his name was called Jesus which was so called of the angel Luke 2:21 before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification which was eight days if you look back to Leviticus 12 verse eight the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord as it is written in the law of the Lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord verse 24 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons and if you remember in Leviticus 12 you could bring a lamb and if you were poor like a peasant you could bring a turtle doves Mary was poor so hearing this message reproach for the cause of the word brother branham said what a reproach to Mary what a reproach to Mary and Joseph for his word he starts talking about how the scorn how they lifted up their eyebrows when they seen little Mary go by said to Joseph you're marrying a prostitute and remember brother adultery was death in them days to get her from being killed he's talking about what how Joseph was thinking to put her away privately but remember all the time God was dealing with them it was according to the word and they didn't know it a virgin shall conceive and Joseph looked and before the angel had visited him he said well I love her but I'm a righteous man and I can't marry a woman like that and the angel of the Lord appeared in to him in a dream and said don't fear to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit Oh oh what a comfort would you agree the word brings comfort I want to say in 2018 9 to Christmas the bride needs comfort the Lord Jesus is our comforter the Holy Ghost is our comforter and may you receive it tonight receive comfort tonight in this busy stressed caught up world there's no one that brings the smile to his face like you as his wife walking into the room saying I love you Jesus and Mary on her road to the well the little virgin about 17 18 years old I'm quoting brother Branham 1718 married to a man that had been married before and had four children as an old man talking about Joseph a it was a widower he was older and she loved him and she didn't know why and he loved her and she didn't know why they didn't know why but tonight we know why because Joseph was of the house and lineage of David why was it Mary because she was a teenager that had kept herself pure God could have trust in Mary that she wasn't going to give in to the reproach and the peer pressure God said I want a teenager that I can trust that'll take me at my word that in spite of family friends whoever she was gonna stand on the Word of God she's standing in line with her little turtledoves and everybody has their lambs because they're more well often this is the Messiah and the mother and father are so poor they just have a turtle death for an offering I don't want to digress but some of us would miss apply and misunderstand back then or even today when the scripture says if you can't provide for your family you're worse than an infidel let me bring to your mind that when Jesus was born God Almighty couldn't even provide a room for him he was born in a stable he couldn't provide a bed for him he was born in a manger he had no blue blanket or no nice garment it was a teenager reaching up and grabbing swaddling cloths that was hanging over and that wrapped the lovely Lord Jesus that's Almighty God I would say very well he provided for his children do you agree tonight I mean is there anyone that's gonna accuse God of not providing he provided everything last Sunday night in Edmonton there was a sister that sang a special and I'm forgetting the words exactly but I'm paraphrasing I have no complaint to God after all he's done after all these years I have no complaint can we say that tonight after all he's done after all he's been and we've gone through I have no complaint about fifty percent of you I gotcha we have no complaint say but what about there so what about that you're describing the reproach you're talking about the cross you're talking about finances or or your bad health or you're talking about somebody misunderstood that's the reproach but tonight we're speaking about from reproach to a newborn faith we're talking about God doing something for you or for me in a moment of question in a moment of a misunderstanding in a moment when we don't know what to do God comes on the scene she's bearing a reproach standing in the in the temple a teenager and no one was rallying for her no one shook her hand as she went in and said go for it Mary I know you were a virgin you can do this he's the Messiah not a person she's standing on she's standing in the line because it's according to the word and everybody's saying don't even go near her and and the scoffers were there and and brother Branham says I wonder how little Mary felt I know we like sermons way up in the clouds here's a prophet I wonder how Mary felt probably about the way you've have failed in your life probably there's times in your life since you've given your heart to the Lord you felt like Mary did but the bottom said did you ever think of that I wonder if she felt scared he said and the scoffers were saying things and she came to the day of the dedication and all the women were keeping their distance and here she came up with the baby walking up with the baby and all they had their little fine needlework to dedicate their babies and nearly all of them pulling a lamb and she had two little turtle doves cleansing for her own purification the little baby wrapped in swaddling cloth made out of the yolk of a back of an ox's neck that was this swaddling cloth in the manger they had nothing for him they was too poor and here she stood I'd like to just take a real knock at that devil tonight that says you have to be wealthy and you have to have a lot of money and you have to be at a certain status I think we need to take a good whack at him sometimes and say I have Jesus that's sufficient but you don't have a nice blanket Mary I love Jesus you're a prostitute I know you were playing around you thought you all goody two-shoes and religious and you're nothing but somebody that you're living a lie and brother branham said she was poor but she just stood I would encourage you tonight stand on the Word of God no doubt he said all the women kept their distance from the little virgin see she's got an illegitimate child brother branham said see how God makes things so radical looking he pulls the wool over satan's eyes they were saying filthy dirty adultery she's an adulteress listen here that didn't stop that beat in little Mary's heart I pray the Lord Jesus will turn up the volume of Revelation tonight no matter what they're saying no matter what you're hearing condemnation you're bad you're a bad mother you're a bad daddy you're a bad provider just keeping on you the scorn and the mockery oh if we should have only done that and oh if you would have only dad but it didn't stop that beat in Mary's heart I'm here for my purification they kept their distance they're calling her Holy Roller fanatic but Mary knew whose baby that was hallelujah and the bride knows what we're carrying that it wasn't us that did this it wasn't us it was the angel that said to us you're the Bride of Christ I just believe the Angels say what are you doing standing there tonight what are you doing I'm standing because of the voice of an angel and from that time there's been a newborn faith there's been a freshness there's been an energy there's been a fire and this is what I pray this Christmas take it from being a sermon now right down to family time this is what I pray would happen to every single person and we desire for our children and for our spouses and one another and visitors and just at that time when everything is just silent and the scorn is just heavy on her all of a sudden comes hallelujah praise God hallelujah what is that noise it's Simeon come bursting into their mockery party father scuffing and mockery here comes Simeon an 80 year old brother that had a revelation that's the Messiah I tell you something must have happened inside of Mary some newborn faith must have said wow look at that brother look at that I knew something was in my heart but look at that vindication I tell you one can send a thousand now mm now simians exploding let me touch that child let me bear that child hallelujah all the scoffers and markers I'm sure they're just standing there their mouths wide open Simeon didn't care he had a revelation Mary didn't care she had a revelation Joseph didn't care he had a revelation the bride doesn't care we've got a revelation oh but your family oh but your boss oh but the finances oh but the economy God give us a revelation give us a newborn face this Christmas [Applause] here comes Simeon had the word of the Lord saying I see the Spirit of God descend upon me I stood and looked at him and he told me Simeon you've been a righteous man and you're not gonna die till you see the Messiah I'll make you have a test timoni what are you gonna do that for Lord that's my business my opinion is that he can share poor the coal to them on that day you had a witness why didn't you listen to it he's talking about the mockers and scoffers friends make sure you're on the right side oh my my mind then God about had enough of just oh we need one oh just Simeon oh here comes Anna here comes a another charity Wang come busting into the room she couldn't even see but she was being led by the Holy Ghost who was there on Thursday night charity is like so expression feel like work where did she get that and it was about 84 years old in the temple praying all of a sudden the Lord revealed to her and said Simeon is right see how we can encourage one another on December 23rd family night right before Christmas you say I was planning to spend it alone I thought I was all alone and God's coming tonight saying no there's other men and women just like you lift up your armor lift up the shield let this be a Christmas that you can bear that reproach with a newborn faith rip open the package and say Jesus I want what's inside of there Anna she couldn't see daylight from dark he said but she could see farther than many people today that's got good eyes she didn't know whether was daylight or darkness she couldn't see with her eyes but she could see a lot further than a lot of people that had good eyes what's he talking about she had revelation I pray God they can take whatever from me but let me have a revelation my eyesight my ears my my legs my feet whatever but give me Jesus but they're Ernie's down in Oregon this weekend visiting in the prisons and today was with another Minister used to come to this church and was with him today Jesus said when did you visit me when when you were in prison I didn't know that you were in prison no in so much you've done to the least of these sister Helen Billis Berger in the hospital tonight still needing our prayers but the Lord has kept her and her families gathered around her but it comes a time when your feet or your legs just don't want to get up and move and you have pains or something strikes you that's when we want to know that we're in touch with Jesus and take my health take my money take my degree but I want a revelation brother dig down deeper and say God give us a revelation this Christmas what is it all about I say give me the eyes that Anna had she saw in the spirit the coming Messiah was at hand in the spirit moving in her heart I say God move in our hearts move in our families move in our church we're about ready to have a watch night service and thank God for what he's done it's good to thank God for what he's doing look forward and say God whatever you have in 2019 let there be a revival in my life in my family let my son get baptized but let my daughter give her heart to the Lord let them have a newborn experience and you say but they're a good person and they're not bad Joseph was a good person but he had a question Mary was a good person but she was there was something moved when Simeon came in and Anna starts coming in and whether Branham said what a little bitty church there was Zack Araya Elizabeth Mary Joseph Anna and Simeon six out of millions but I'm all alone or there's only two of us or there's only five as it was in the days of Noah God dealt with them they were in harmony they got together and when Simeon came in there with a little baby was I'm still quoting he'd never heard nothing about it but here was the baby and Simeon sitting in the room and the spirit fell on him hallelujah didn't say saw the star he didn't give gold he didn't have it to give but he had a revelation he didn't know nothing about those things but the Spirit of God fell on him and said move out Simeon and here he went walking not knowing where he was going like Abraham he was seeking something he didn't know where it was at but he just kept moving maybe some of us were just kind of walking not knowing which way to go I don't know if it's this way I don't know if it's that way but I want to be moved by the spirit leave me Lord and I'll follow lead me out there and he said the Spirit of God fell on him and all at once he stopped and the Holy Spirit Monster said there he is there he is he reached over into Mary's arms took up the baby in his arms and looked up and said Lord let thy serve it now depart from this life in peace my eyes is looking at your salvation hallelujah he was looking with different eyes everybody else's scoffing mocking don't I don't want to be around Simeon walks right up here where's this baby if I could just touch this child you're all calling it you don't want to touch it you don't want to even look at Mary Simeon walks right into the scoffers and the mockers it's the same today they don't want your Jesus they want your innocence they want your purity they want your sound mind and we'll give them as much as we can make it through this life but our heart is the Lord's the very thing everyone was making fun of and the women was shunning Simeon said it's your salvation and about that time here comes the old blind woman wine and her way through staggering through the crowd she comes up prophesize oh my let you'd say give us a positive testimony Anna say something good do you all know what she said a sword shall pierce your heart but it'll reveal I'm reading brother branham's words here quoting Luke 2:35 a sword shall pierce their heart but it'll reveal the thoughts of many hearts oh you say mary had to look through the reproach and the sharpness of the word and the sword and say wow if that's going to reveal the hearts of many and this is your salvation but the Brenham said what was it I guess some of those woman said now look that see what kind of class it is that old woman cracked in the head there he is over there standing before that prostitute girl trying to say a thing like that that a illegitimate child old Anna sets there half starving herself to death fasting and they were saying starving herself to death going on like that she she don't have any fun like we do look at Mary she don't have no fun like all of us do look at Anna no she was about her father's business she was a bearing a big reproach some of you are beautiful tonight you bear a reproach you bear the scorn you bear the cross let's turn to Matthew chapter 1 let's turn back to Matthew our family evenings almost done it's almost finished but look Matthew 1:18 again that the few verses after Matthew 1:18 how many paradoxes are in these few verses speaking about from a reproach to a newborn faith just from Matthew 1:18 the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused or engaged to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost that was a miracle then Joseph her husband he say I thought they were just a spouse I I thought they were just engaged this is how serious engagement is Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately or privately he's not going to make it a big thing in the church he's embarrassed it's like how could my lovely engaged how could she do that and I'll just put her away privately it's not going to be a big thing but while he thought on these things while you're thinking on these things while you've been praying about God's will for your life and what you should do in Joseph's case the angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a dream Saint Joseph so it's not vague and it's not about someone else and this person it's you I'm speaking to you now son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife she's your wife for that which is conceived in her is a tell you what a revelation if God would give that to a young man tonight and say that is your wife don't forget an angel can talk to her too so if it's got on one side it'll be God on the other these things are like paradoxes verse 23 we see a virgin shall be with child you say it's impossible you say it can happen but it fulfills Scripture a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us now verse 24 when Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him would you agree he got the revelation and took them to him his wife and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus our time is almost finished tonight but this is really the heart of the message a few weeks ago brother Michael Ray spoke on the token and spoke about Rahab the harlot and how she bore the reproach and how long it was from the time of the scarlet cord being in the window until her and her family was actually brought out it wasn't the next day it wasn't three days if you look from Joshua to all the way to Joshua 6 it talks about the days and the weeks and the Passover then they crossed over Gilgal they had Passover they ate of the old corn of the land the manna stopped they had seven days of circling around Jericho up to April 23rd it's right there in the Bible until Jericho was destroyed and then Rahab and her family in Joshua 6 22 to 25 and all that she had was saved it was at least 15 days over two weeks that Rahab allowed that token scarlet cord to be in the window she was scoffed she was mocked it was a test but she stood the reproach everybody said look at that scarlet car look at that token look at that but down in her heart that was her safety I wonder if you would have the same revelation it's not just the next day or a week later no she kept it there and when everything else is being destroyed Rahab's house was standing hallelujah you say oh that's good for Rahab no it was good for the spice because God was confirming that it's not just Moses it's not just Joshua I'm gonna use the words of two brothers in the church and whatever they say is as good as my word and when everything else failed there's her house standing Joshua never said that it was two spies two brothers that believed the message hallelujah two men that kind of Revelation that whatever I say God will back it up you'll lay your hands on the sick they shall recover not just brother branham not just the pastor but now men and women operating how many you remember this morning Rahab walked out of there as a prostitute but she married Salman and brought forth a son that was right in the lineage of Jesus Christ all the scorn all the reproach of a mockery of years and years and years God was stamping the whole thing the spies Rahab and her family by saying I'm gonna bring my son my life right through that lineage y'all know where he was born in Bethlehem it's incredible this the cold Christmas story comes back to the token comes back to reproaches comes back to men and women and Bethlehem is the house of God's bread it's the staff of life it was the water capital where fresh water comes it was the well of Bethlehem that that David when he well you remember when the Philistines were garrisoned about that he I wanted some of that water and Men jeopardize their lives where are those men today that'll bear the reproach bear the scorn and say I'll fight my way through to bring you a fresh drink and he poured it out on the ground well the carnal mind would say what a waste and what are you doing pouring that on on the ground it's all speaking of Christ it's all men and women that when you look at it all just like us then I just take it a little further results of reproach many times leads to crying your hearts broken hurt feelings things that are against and there's a struggle and you're given one side and there's someone else on another side and there's a struggle and you're left with a reproach like a burden it's like really many times it's opposite differences of opinion and thoughts and mind they clash and your life that you're scorned you're looked on as being the one that's wrong and in air so they alienates you they separate from you we've mentioned scoffers that Peters talked about scoffers and mockers but you're given a bad name from that time on when you make that stand you're given a bad name you're reproached and you're made fun of or something bad happens to you and they used to be your friend or your brother or sister now they're like ah it's because of that ah ha ha the Bible says friends and family may leave you're called oddballs but I want to encourage you tonight it's not all about the reproach it's about a new born faith where God will come back around to you and give you a freshness I just read some scripture I wish I had more time but it was when Joseph realized that he's going to put away this beautiful lady that he was engaged to in brother Branham said no doubt but she rehearsed all of this to Joseph and Joseph was wondering and said the stems of it I'm engaged to if it is the way it is and she's been with someone else she should have been ravished she should have been stoned according to Deuteronomy 22 by the venoms saying the penalty of that but now she's to be mother not married and Joseph it seemed like that Mary was trying to get him to be her shield from the scoffers and scorners Joseph was to be her shield and to go ahead and marry her and be her shield he was to be a shield he wanted to believe her I really believe that he said he wanted to believe her but her story was so unusual it was hard for that believer to believe and he said so it is today the power of the Holy Ghost upon the earth today in the church is so unusual but it's the truth and the Bible said while he was thinking on these things he was a good man and he didn't want his own name marred and yet he knowed if that woman was that way he couldn't marry her she was to be a mother by another man that innocent little woman her life has been so pure as a lily and I want to believe her and I don't know what to do while he thought on these things here I want to bring it down to this tonight while he thought on these things and was minded to put her away privately he said I don't want to cause any great disturbance about it remember he had never taken the oath yet but yet he was espoused he was going to put her away privately while he was thinking on these things to the best of his knowledge he said he was a just man a good man he said brother sister let me say this if you are justice you're honest in your heart God is obligated to reveal the thing to you I'm glad we came to church Sunday night just be honest in your heart and God will reveal it to you and Joseph being a just man pondering these things how can these things be no doubt he sat and prayed he studied it in the scriptures how could this be and the angel of the Lord appeared to him he goes on to talk about some of his thoughts and how he's just praying lord I come through the lineage of David Jehovah God I'm a righteous man I'm trusting in you my beloved little sweetheart I'm a spouse to her I'll put her away I'm if I take her than I'm guilty she's to be mother and I don't know what is these things Lord she didn't know if she had told the truth it was all an unusual story and unusual happening and then the voice came Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife remember already his wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost God sent his angel and revealed that his revelation came to Joseph and there was no mystery in it he said Joseph there isn't no riddle I'm gonna make it real to you coz there's nobody can make it real don't fear to take Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in Arizona the Holy Ghost and when Joseph rose from his sleep oh how his heart must have been full of newborn faith that mystery that had bothered him something that he wanted to believe something that he dared to believe was so unusual yet it was made known to him by a dream new faith sprung up into his life he said oh my he had faith in God he had faith in his wife maybe you need faith for your husband faith for your wife - no a job to take her what direction to go trust God you might be thinking one way but God can speak to you and it be totally opposite he's wanting to put her away privately and God says no you take her said I'm gonna make it real to you and new faith sprung up into his life he had faith in God he had faith in his wife then both faith in God and love for his wife and love to the one that he loved there's no more question no more question about it he knew that was the angel of the Lord he knew that God had revealed to somebody need a revelation tonight let the angel of the Lord just come by your way would that be wonderful there's a sister that gave a testimony I heard it the other day she had cysts in her body she didn't want to make a big thing about it didn't put in a prayer request didn't tell her people she just had cysts in certain parts of her body she went up for prayer someone prayed it was a minister a visiting minister she went back home and the next morning she realized the sister gone there's no more sis she's given testimony to God that's our kind of a God tumors just fall off right there on your seat there you're back to straight right now you say what struck me the angel of the Lord came by if you talk about him he'll come around tomorrow and Tuesday just speak about Jesus welcomed him in how many would love for the question just to leave all the turmoil and you're going into this and all of us it's just gone it's just like peace just and the Bible says I can imagine sorry brother Branham said I can imagine how Joseph felt when that taken place the mystery was all over and when this was done he was found rejoicing hallelujah he was happy till then your your kind of clouded over you're bearing a reproach you're saying why me why us I thought we had the revelation and something bad happened but after God speaks and after God confirms it then you can rejoice then he said he was happy and we find out right away he married her no more question he took him marry the wife and knew her not as a wife until the child he said happy about it he was glad to be marry shield he was glad to bear her reproach now I'm not talking about just you but when you get a real revelation you're able to bear others reproaches people around you and what they're going through I pray that we wouldn't become just an old starchy Church as we get older you say I've been there I've done that but there's others that are going through things they need us to bear with them and they're going through times of reproaches when they feel like running - and they feel like going - just like you did that's the time we need to bear one another's reproach after this revelation Joseph could stand and say I'll be her shield you don't have to stand all alone Mary I'll be there with you anybody have anything to say talk to me okay I'll talk to you look at this woman no an angel appeared to us he said when a man can have it revealed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how many creeds turn against it you're good you're glad to be a shield you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever this week let them say whatever but you got a big shield there to knock the fiery darts off you're happy to be a shield you're a doormat this is a wonderful way to close a Christmas message he said you're a doormat whatever it wants to be it doesn't matter it's been revealed to you by the Lord the Lord has showed it to you by his word it's the truth and confirmed it to you and made it live again you say there it is you know what that's when we say there it is let's stand tonight what a super sign what a super message there's room in the end Lord come by this in give us gifts this Christmas of forgiveness gifts of healing gifts of deliverance I pray for your homes there'd be gifts of joy and if there's no joy there you be the joy you say there's no peace in the situation you bring the peace for the jury I wrote it right down here a peaceful atmosphere bring a gift this year I wish I could give you a thousand dollars but my presence is my present yeah and everybody goes no bring peace bring joy bring a smile on your face hallelujah we could all use that sometimes and isn't it amazing that even balaam a prophet that went out of the way could prophesy of Christ in numbers 24:17 he said I shall see him but not now I shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel he prophesied of Christ when they wanted him to see the hind ER parts of the church and the hind ER parts of the message he could only prophesy of Christ III have nothing good to but good to say I think that's good it's coming from a time of reproach into a new born faith as we bow our heads tonight I wonder tonight if the Holy Spirit could put his arms around individuals can play something brother Ryan wonder if the Holy Spirit is here as we come together in the congregation as we've seen over the years not everyone can bear this reproach not everyone can stand the reproach of the word they cave in they give in to the pressure they back up they stop fighting the reproach is too much the laughing what they said about you on the internet what they're emailing pictures you see and it brings a reproach and you feel laughed at and you're hurt say how can this be then the Holy Spirit comes behind it starts to minister to your heart then the angel of the Lord comes by your way you're my daughter you're my son maybe the service tonight wasn't for everyone maybe there's some tonight tomorrow Tuesday you have a lot of family you have a lot of maybe even believers maybe there's moms and dads and brothers and sisters cousins and aunts and uncles and grandpas and grandmas but maybe there's a few in our family that really needed the service tonight to let them know that it's not all about the reproach but this Christmas he wants to give you a new born faith to bring back the new again bring back the freshness to where you're not just talking about it and hearing sermons and going through the motions but an angel of the Lord can come by your ways and by the time he's done the questions our time the mystery about it all you rise up like Joseph and you're willing to go out there and do the exact opposite what you felt in you in your own heart was the right thing to do but the Lord Jesus when he comes he inspires you to do something so sacred so divine they laughed at the wise men they scoffed at him for coming these whole years months away from your business away from your family your wife your children your church two years where are you going they pass their Jerusalem and all the preachers and all the charts and all the people that should have known better they were lied to by Herod brother Branham talks about how the people in the streets laughed at them where is he that is born King of the Jews where is he that is born King of the Jews but the bomb said they laughed at them but when they stepped out of that spirit the star appeared again and led them all the way to the little house the little child that had grown up now from a baby now a little child the same Jesus the same Lord and they gave gold frankincense and myrrh again reproached scoffed at lied to if they gave and they worshiped I wonder who would want to worship this Christmas with your gift with your gift Here I am Lord Jesus like the Shepherd's I'm coming to this place because an angel of the Lord the seventh angel has appeared in our generation Heavenly Father let us respond 100% let us bear the reproach and if there's some in our church and our spiritual family that need a newborn faith made tonight be the start bring it all back new again appear to them Lord Jesus cause the message to come alive cause the Scriptures to become a new book I pray for them Jesus we pray for one another we give of our time we give of our energy we give of our money we diff for one another can we give our faith to one another and say we are gonna bind together in this great time of reproach Heavenly Father many raise their hands throughout the service and at the end now some have lifted up their hands you know every heart you know every life you know every situation wise men and wise women are still seeking for the Messiah whether it's a baby in a manger whether it's a little child whether it's a a teenager whether it's a man on the Jordan River whether it's a man hanging on the cross saying my God my God why is our forsaken me or whether it's 2018 the same message reproached scoffed and mocked looked down on but may that newborn faith rise out of our assembly out of our families out of the individuals that are fellowshipping God and may the Holy Ghost fall on them as you did Simeon move like you did Sir Joseph Mary from teenagers all the way up to Anna the elder ones let them be encouraged this Christmas that you have not forgotten them they are not alone we pray that you would send that angel by their address by their need if it's physical if it's in the spirit realm if a devil has haunted their soul I pray this year this season this time even tonight there would be a light as you ministered even recently here an arrow of your presence come shooting down into that blood cell and loose them Jesus that they could see even their frankincense or even their myrrh shows what they feel of Christ we accept that doesn't always have to be gold it doesn't always have to be frankincense another person may give another gift and have another expression Lord Jesus we want to see more of you among us we want to see more of these gifts manifested God's gifts always find their places would you encourage our people would you strengthen us now as we're going out into this season and it'll be a few days til we're back together like this next Sunday if you would Terry Lord we want to be gathered around the marriage supper of the Lamb we have holidays maybe time off of school and work don't let us go through
