We just want him to have his way this morning. There's a request to remember our brother Abe Dick as he's traveling to the Yukon to help our brother Roger and his wife Sopsy as they are moving to join the congregation here. Just pray the Lord would give them traveling mercies and watch over them during the move down here. Amen. We have no other prayer requests. Want to continue to remember brother Wes Nyagard. I know the Lord is doing a miracle. His life, I've just heard a short bit of the testimony. It's absolutely supernatural. We're certainly thankful. God bless sister Diane. It's nice to have you with us. We've been praying for you and your family. God bless you. There's something on your heart that you just want to lift before the Lord. Amen. Brother Larry, would you come take us before the throne this morning? Amen. We open the service in a word of prayer. Hallelujah. Thank you, Brother Larry. Could we just bow our hearts together? Gracious heavenly father, we just count it such a privilege this morning, Lord, as we come into your house, Lord, with great expectation. We're so grateful, Lord, that we have a place of refuge. And we have a place of comfort and strength and refreshing, oh God. And Lord, we've not come just to put in some time, but we've come here believing that there is a God that speaks and undertakes and hears and answers, oh God. And Lord, this morning is no different. We've come, Lord, with anticipation that your word will strengthen your bride and prepare her, Lord. We're expecting, Lord. We're looking for the rapture, Lord. We're just desiring it with all our hearts, Lord, to be there and be ready, Lord Jesus. And Father, we just take this request for brother Abe this morning, Lord, for traveling mercies. And for God's hand and blessing upon our brother Lassard as he would seek to come and be with the assembly here. And Lord, bless him, we pray, and bless the the move, we pray. Remember our pastor, Lord, just be with him now. Lord, we know he's waited faithfully. And Lord, with great expectation that you will direct him and guide him. And Lord, we're anticipating the same, oh God. And our hearts are hungry and thirsting for more of you, Lord Jesus. Would you just bless him and anoint him now? Bless the service, Lord. And everyone that is gathered in in the sound of your word. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Amen. Why don't you greet one another say God bless you. Want to welcome you all once again. Thankful to have you as a part of the service this morning. You're welcome to have your seats. We have a couple announcements and the choir is going to come with our brother Hank Iver sit and sing for us. So maybe if they just want to make their way, we have a couple announcements. Um there's a reminder that the Sunday school singing starts at 9:45. So parents, appreciate if you have your children there for the song service in the mornings. It's important for the children. Amen. We appreciate our brother Tim, Sister Megan, and Sister Jessica, and the musicians, the effort they put into the service for the Sunday school children. Amen. And also just on a another note, um I have kind of a unique uh experience with this being a pianist after the service. I know we've made announcements numerous times just try to keep the fellowship down to a minimum in the foyer after a service. There's many times, you know, the service has been dismissed for 30, 45 minutes and there's still people in here praying and I know we just don't think of it, but a lot of times I'll be playing there's just maybe a few people left and you hear laughing and talking and things going on. If we could just keep it either outside or in the fellowship hall, I think that would be um a help to the people who are in here and just be mindful of the spirit that's still in the sanctuary. This is a house of prayer and there's people still here that are, you know, meeting with God. So, just because you've been out of the service for a while doesn't necessarily mean that there aren't people still in here. So, be conscious of it if we can just keep the fellowship to the fellowship hall. Amen. We're going to be singing Give ear to my words, oh Lord. So, Brother Dave, if you could put the words up on the screen and you're welcome to sing along with us. We just trust it'll be a blessing to you. And also on the monitor, Brother David, if you don't mind. Amen. [Music] Heavy to my words, oh Lord. Consider my meditation. Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my king and my God. [Music] For unto thee will I pray. My voice shall thou hear in the morning. [Music] Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer. Unto thee and will go. [Music] to my words, oh Lord. I'm consider my meditation. Hearken unto the voice of my crown, my king and my God. For unto thee will I pray. Oh my voice shall thou hear in the morning. Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and Hail. [Music] to my words, oh Lord. [Music] and s my meditation unto the voice of my king and my forto thee will I Pray my voice shall thou hear in the morning. Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will come. [Music] My words my [Music] heart to the voice of my and my God. For I to thee where I pray my voice shall thou hear in the morning. [Music] Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will. Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. We're going to have a baby dedication and invite our pastor, brother Biscll, to come out, brother Nathaniel, Sister Shelley, if you'd like to come and why don't we sing, you are my refuge. Amen. You are my sanctuary. Hallelujah. You are my refuge. Oh, and you are my sanctuary. And when I feel afraid, I know you're my hiding place. And you are my refuge. And when the storm is raging underneath your wings, oh Lord, I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. Once more, Lord, you are my refuge and you are my sanuary. And when I feel afraid, I know you're my hiding place and you are my refuge. And when the storm is raing, oh underneath your wings, I rejoice and sing. You are my refuge. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; We say amen to every part of the service. &gt;&gt; And Jesus took time in his part of the service. Others didn't understand it, but he took time and he took he took special time receiving the children. And uh he said that suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such as the kingdom of heaven. And I thought of brother Nathaniel and sister Shelley Iverson coming not only with uh their baby son but the other two. So they have three. So must be some perfection in that as well. God works in threes. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. and he took them up in his arms and put his hands upon them and blessed them. There's always something special about every every baby dedication. And uh as our brother Nathaniel and sister Shelley are bringing this their third son, they've named him Seth Daniel. He he doesn't know it, but perhaps if time goes on, he'll find out. his uh greatgrandfather, this child's greatgrandfather stood here at this altar and I had prayer with him and he was such a humble man, such a wonderful man. Brother Vanise, Sister C Ion, Brother Hank, s brother and sister Hank Iberson here. They're going to be leaving, but we're happy that they're here. Sister Shel's mother's a believer. And so this child has grandparents that are believers, but it was Sister Iverson's uh father and he stood here and I was so humbled. He said uh the day or two before, I have never been ordained within the message. I've been preaching for many years. Would you pray a prayer of ordination? And uh, brother Van Heath came and stood at this altar and we had that prayer and I felt so privileged. He was such a such an honorable man. And then it was a privilege for me to fly to Belgium and be there at his 40th 40 years of ministering. So this son here has a great heritage. Amen. &gt;&gt; A great heritage and we believe in that. Uh the name Seth is uh they say compensation or anointed compensation because he was one given in place in place of Abel. Righteous Abel. righteous Abel was slain by Cain and God gave uh conception to Eve and she had Seth and and his name Seth is the compensation the anointed compensation one given in place one to replace the loss but brother Brham takes it much further said Abel was a type of Christ. And when Abel was killed, Seth took his place, death, burial, that was Abel's part and Seth's part was resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought that was so appropriate because that's my that's my message this morning. And I thought that's really wonderful that I'm able to dedicate a son whose name is Seth, who's a type of Christ resurrection. And I am praying that he will be a a a spirit of resurrection within your family, brother Nathaniel, Sister Shelly, that he will be uh something that is is quickening with life and that God will do something special for him. He said also that God raised up Seth to take his place, take Christ's place. He said, "And then the generations after Seth, the generations started moving on between right and wrong." May God give this son a great sense of what is right and what is wrong. And may he also follow the footsteps of Daniel. Daniel, God is my judge. And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber. He prayed towards Jerusalem. He knelt upon his knees three times a day. And he prayed and gave thanks before God as he did before time. May he be a a man of worship. May he be a man of prayer. May be he a man of faith and may he be a a lad who's not not ashamed. I thought of four things I'd like to say and these are from the message. I thought, what kind of a heart would I pray that God should give him? That he might have a heart to listen to God. That he'd have a heart to do it and appreciate the leading of the Holy Spirit. that he would have a heart to receive the Holy Spirit and desire that and may God give him a heart to stay true to him. And on that basis, we'll take and pray a prayer of dedication. He'll probably need that. Seth Daniel, son of resurrection. Hallelujah. I think I know how to do that, too. We'll just pray. Heavenly Father, we hold this gem in our hands, a child that you have given to our brother Nathaniel and sister Shelly. I pray that you will receive him now. Oh God, I pray that your Holy Spirit will be upon him. I pray, oh God, that he might come to know you in the power of the resurrection that he might come to know you whom to know is life eternal that he might be filled with the Holy Spirit that as he hears your name, Lord, he will receive you. And father, I take and dedicate Seth Daniel to you in the name of Jesus Christ. And I pray, oh God, that he will not only come to know you, but he will be such a blessing in the home and in the family in Jesus' name. As you give him to them, I give him back to you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Amen. See, he quietened down soon as I said amen. God bless you, Sister Shelly. Give you grace to raise three sons. Bless you, brother Nathaniel. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't worry about them over when they fuss. Brother Brandham said that's the only way they've got us saying, letting you know. they they need something or whatever more. Uh you know, you learn a few things as you walk down life's way. I was carrying one of my d girls. I won't tell you which one. And I was going down through the shopping center and everything and I was buying some things and so on so forth. And she was squirming and I said, "Sit still. Sit still." you know, and she kept squirming and squirming and I give her a little tap, you know, and just sit still, you know, stand still. I got Then I found out later I had a fish hook in my pocket and and a little and the hook had kind of gone through the shirt, you know, and it was scratching her. So, that was my fault. I was happy after I didn't hit her too hard. Amen. Isn't this wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, some of our people are away on on a spring break, but we're here on a break, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I just said to the brothers in the uh in the study, you know, when we were we had our family, and I guess there were spring breaks. I don't know. I I never got to if if we got to take a little vacation once a year, we just felt we were real lucky and uh all these days off and professional days and teachers holidays and all kinds of things. My goodness. Well, anyway, it's another time, isn't it? Amen. Well, I'll have you uh just give me your attention for a moment. I want to read a bit of a a a testimony and this is uh from our brother and sister Nyiggard and sister Diane has handed this uh to us. We won't read it all, but we will simply tell you as most of you know that brother Wes had a a stroke and uh when he went into the emergency his uh blood pressure was 217 217 over 138 and they had tried 7 to 8 times and I believe if I remember correctly it was eight times because they gave him they gave him a shot while I was there with IV medication. to lower it to 110 rate uh on the lower number so they could run some other tests and they said that to determine what was going on but it wasn't happening and I just happened to be there when they had brought them in after some tests and they couldn't seem to get this blood pressure down. So, uh, we all joined in prayer and brother West, Sister Dan, myself and, uh, we just had prayer and I I was watching and I noticed it was going down and she said that the blood pressure dropped down to 170 over 110, which is what they wanted and get a proper read for his CT scan, etc. He could not walk on his own or use his right hand, could not dress, could not feed himself. and could not bathe and his speech was only very very slightly affected. But she said, "We have uh we have a wonderful praise report to pass on to all. He has made a miraculous recovery already. Our God is so great and has truly touched him. He is doing everything on his own at 90% or more already. It has only been 20 days and one week of that was in the hospital. So 20 days and one week of the 20 days was in the hospital getting his blood pressure down to a reasonable safe level uh to start rehab. The prognosis was for a good outcome for recovery within two months to a year. Wes has great determination and perseverance uh perseverance and says with all the prayers that are going up on his behalf that he can definitely he wants to do his part and work hard and we are so humbled to appreciate and feel the effects of the prayers and outpouring of love on his behalf. His physical therapists and occupational therapists have said that he is a miracle and a remarkable story. His outpatient physical therapist says she thinks a couple more weeks at the most and he will be 100%. We saw his outpatient uh occupational therapist today and he said he was an amazing story. released him from occupational therapy because he's doing so well and just needs to continue his hand coordination exercise at home. I saw the neurologist today also and said he was very fortunate. The effects of the stroke could have been extreme with crossing of eyes and slurred speech and much much more. But the brain has to have time to heal and his strength will come back with his healing also. We give God all the glory. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Let's just stand, shall we? And I think it would be good to say we give all the glory to Jesus. We give all the glory to Jesus. Let's just sing it together. We'll give the glory to Jesus. Let's just praise him as we sing now and tell his love. His wonderful love will give the glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful love. Oh, let's just sing it once again. You'll give all the glory to Jesus and tell his love his wonderful love. We'll give our glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful love that has special meaning to me. I had a phone call for about 30 minutes this morning from someone who's in the hospital and doesn't know Jesus. He hasn't had the experience that brother Wes has had. I believe that brother Wes and sister Diane are streaming now. And I say, "God bless you, brother Wes." &gt;&gt; That you've come to know the Lord Jesus Christ. And we thank him. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't know him. You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for his grace &gt;&gt; and his great love wherewith he has loved us and made himself known to us. And I am so thankful that we know him whom to know is life eternal. Amen. Let's just bow our heads a moment in prayer. Almighty God, you're our father which art in heaven. And we wish to say and from the depths of our heart, hallowed be thy name. &gt;&gt; Thy kingdom come. We desire it. We yearn after it. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. We thank you, Lord, that you have given us food for our daily bread. And that you forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others who trespass against us. Give us a nature and a heart like Jesus Christ. I pray that you will infuse us with the Holy Spirit. Oh spirit of the living God, come amongst us. And we pray that you'll bring your kingdom in, oh God. And all the glory and all the power belongs to you. And we say without hesitation. Praise be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Now Lord, take your word. You're the author of it. Anoint us. Anoint us, oh God. Anoint me to speak. May the people have understanding. May I have understanding and clarity of thought. Oh God, I pray that the spirit of revelation, the spirit of adoption and maturity will be upon us. God, I pray you'll give the people an intense expectation. Father, that your the word of this season may come to us. We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. If you would open your Bibles, please. I'm going to read out of Philippians, the third chapter, starting with the verse, the 10th verse. that I may know him and the and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead, not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, &gt;&gt; forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth under those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. And I think that all of us could read that 14th verse together. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen. You may have your seats. I'll need your all of your attention and all of your thinking capacity to follow along because sometimes as a minister we uh reach out into an area and there's much in the Bible that goes beyond our capabilities. Our minds run out of space. Don't you find that? &gt;&gt; And uh quite often. So I want to speak on the voice of the resurrection. uh in speaking in the last few weeks, we've touched on areas and and sometimes we just say something and I see the little shock wave go over the congregation and and uh we maybe talk about it after the service and think, well, I I need to come back to that. Now, in speaking on the voice of the resurrection, I believe that we're in the the season of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe the resurrection and the rapture and the change of the body needs to be something must be something that is allconsuming &gt;&gt; upon the believers. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that can just be a casual Sunday school lesson. &gt;&gt; This has to be an objective. &gt;&gt; As Paul said, I press towards the mark of the prize of the high calling. This is something that must be on our minds not just on Sunday coming to church but each day &gt;&gt; we just have that while we're working while we're doing whatever we do whether we whether it's things we enjoy to do or things that are mundane uh sisters around the house caring for the children or brothers working things don't go just right we have our pressures of life but there should be just one allconsuming thought upon us. I am not here. I'm here for a short time. Life is very, very brief. It's very unpredictable. And I'm here to get out of here. &gt;&gt; I'm here to change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm here in expectation of the change. We continue to do our work, live our lives, and however God uh sees fit to uh conduct to allow our lives to be conducted. But we have this one purpose. I when I speak of the voice of the resurrection, I wish to present this to you in a question. Is the voice just the hearing and sound of words? Or is it words and a visual evidence or demonstration or manifestation combined? Words plus. Uh not very long ago, we came to the school. The school had a science fair and each one of the students had a uh a display or a presentation that they had and each student was standing in front of their uh their work their I've been kind of searching the word today but you know it was it's something it's a it's a it's a display. It's a project. So, uh I think this was the winner right here, weren't you? Yeah. Well, you might as well stand up. This was the winner of the whole thing right there. God bless Ethan. Amen. And uh it was words. He got up and spoke some words. He expressed what it was. He was demonstrating. he was showing. And so we were able to see visually and to hear some words. But sometimes I think what we see visually perhaps can speak to us even louder than words. &gt;&gt; So now in terms of the resurrection, someone said to me, is it brother Brandham's voice? Said it wasn't brother Bram's voice in the first place. It was thus sayith the Lord. God was using his vocal cords. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I I I want to I want you to think very very deep as we move in this at this season. If we believe we're in this season, how is it going to take place? And I may not be able to tell you how it's going to take place, but I think we'll be able to throw some light on it. We have in the message a message now I've heard I've heard but now I see what's brother Brandham saying he's saying well now that I see I actually hear better &gt;&gt; I hear clearer &gt;&gt; because I see it you that are parents you have children you try to tell them you try to tell them you try to tell them and how to do something then you say you might just grab a hold of things says well let me show you and now you've conveyed with more clarity &gt;&gt; uh what it is you want them to learn and now they have it and there are some young people who really need to see it done physically before they get a hold of it. They just can't seem to put the words together. And uh in a congregation like this, we have some of each. So the voice speaking the message plus the vindication &gt;&gt; the vindication combined. So the voice speaking it with the vindication combined could make and I was very careful to say could make up the voice of the resurrection. those two &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. Brother Brandham said there was 379 times in 11 years that he used the word this is the sign of the Messiah or sign of Messiah. Sign of Messiah or the sign of the Messiah 379 times. I would think that that should persuade us to believe something extremely significant. And what was the Messiah? His anointed one who both died and res and was resurrected. And then many many times this is the sign of the resurrection. And furthermore, it was important also Jesus said, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh a sign." And actually, brother Brandham uses that many, many, many times because now we have come down into this age that we're in. Leodysia is a wicked and adulterous generation. And they're seeking a sign. And the prophet of God says, "And they'll get one." And that's the sign. &gt;&gt; Now in the rapture message, I have just put together some uh some phrases. I want you to catch these phrases as they come. He said, "Now a shout." We know that the shout and the voice and the trumpet. He said, "Now a shout. Jesus does all three &gt;&gt; when he's descending. &gt;&gt; Three things happen. A shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham uses appearing and the coming and he says they're different. &gt;&gt; But now there are times when he's using appearing and I'm just saying this, this is from my from myself. there's appearing that he's physically physically appearing but he made it very clear that in the ministry that God had given him Christ he said he's appearing now &gt;&gt; this is the appearing &gt;&gt; so he has appeared so I do not believe this is within my own heart I do not believe that he's saying that uh uh three things happen a shout a voice and a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears because you can't make a prophet contradict himself. He said he is appearing and he says that many times. He is appearing now but there will be a time and he also refers to actually us physically seeing him but we are not going to be here sitting here in this church or in this body physically seeing him. You're going to his dimension. He said, "I will come and receive you unto myself &gt;&gt; that where I am, &gt;&gt; there you may be also." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to take all of these things in in continuity. What is a shout? It's the message going forth first, the living bread of life, bringing forth the bride. &gt;&gt; So, the message and now he's at the very end of his life. He's at the very end of the message. The message is being finished &gt;&gt; and that message is bringing forth a bride. So that has taken place &gt;&gt; said also that it's a messenger getting the people ready. &gt;&gt; The second is a voice of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; And now the third thing is a trumpet which always at the feast of trumpets is calling the people to the to the feast. And that'll be the bride's supper, &gt;&gt; the lamb's supper with the bride in the sky. &gt;&gt; He said, "We're right there." Ready now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to remember now this is December the 4th. There's just the fifth, sixth, and seventh to go. If we go two, four, six hours of preaching left. six hours of the ministry of Elijah's voice to the earth, the forerunner, and then he will pass off the scene. Now, the first thing happens when we're resurrected, the ones which are living will still remain. &gt;&gt; The ones which are living will still remain. The resurrection will set in. And I've underlined and don't read ahead of me please, but I've underlined will set in because you know sometimes we get things fixed in our mind and they are actually denominational thoughts. Back in back in the denominational world, they all have the rapture is a kind of a whisbang thing. Lights flashing, everything happening. The dirt comes up out of the graves and all the holes are, you know, the graves are around. That just isn't going to happen. That's just a bunch of fiction. That's not the way it's going to happen at all. &gt;&gt; So he said, "So the resurrection will set in first, the resurrection of those that are asleep. And there will be a waking time. &gt;&gt; And those which are asleep in the dust now, not those that are asleep in sin, &gt;&gt; cuz they sleep right on. &gt;&gt; They don't awake for another thousand years. But those who are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then we'll all get together. &gt;&gt; And when they begin to get together, then we which are alive and remain shall be changed. These mortal bodies will not see death, but just a sudden, just of a sudden, there'll be like a sweep go over us &gt;&gt; and you're changed. &gt;&gt; I don't believe there'll be any feeling with that sweep &gt;&gt; any more than he felt when he passed from time into eternity or that he stood at the platform and said, "I'm standing in two worlds." &gt;&gt; Right? uh I don't think you know he his physical body got weak from it but I I won't get into that but he said that uh and you're changed you're turned back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden change and after a while you're you're traveling like a thought and you can see those then who are already resurrected oh what an hour. &gt;&gt; Then we'll gather with them and then we'll be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air. &gt;&gt; Wherever that is, that's where we're going to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, so th those are the uh just kind of a setting for the rapture. John, the Apostle John says, "I turned to see the voice." when he heard the voice speak to him in Revelation and I turned Revelation 1 and2 I turned I see the voice to see the voice when you think of that I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and so God be to show uh the Apostle John his project and he saw the seven golden candlesticks and he saw one standing like in the midst of it. This is John who was the beloved apostle who was the one who laid his head on Jesus breast. He was the one who had access into Pilate's chambers and was able to get Peter in. And this is John who was a beloved. He's the one that Jesus spoke to from the cross and and turned his mother over to him, asked him to take care of her. He was a beloved disciple, the beloved apostle. But now he sees him in a different in a different kind of a scene. And he sees him standing there with his eyes as fire and hair white like wool, his face shining as the sun in its brightness, a garment down to the foot and the his his feet as brass that burned in a furnace. He he sees a different scene. And when he sees him now this time in the revelation, he falls at his feet as one that is dead. And he heard this great voice and he turned to see the voice. and saw the seven golden candlesticks. Now, there's a a central thought to the message this morning that I uh I I want to try to establish a fact and I believe it will help us in understanding the resurrection. God spoke through his prophets future events and then when the when the time that the prophecy spoke of. So he spoke of them and it might have been weeks, it might have been years, it might have been hundreds of years. But when the time that the prophecy spoke of when the time intersect with the prophecy, then there was a fulfillment. The world has never been presented with such a supernatural manifestation &gt;&gt; such as we have in this day. &gt;&gt; And I keep confirming it to myself. I just listened again. I listened to the sign of the voice last night. and and and and these people that want to present that brother Brandham went into error in the end, they ought to just listen to the vindication of 64 and 65 and these last services. &gt;&gt; That angel of the Lord never once hesitated to come behind and confirm what was being spoken. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And for my part, I want to go publicly and say this is a divine message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coming from God, &gt;&gt; using the instrumentality &gt;&gt; of Luke 17:30, the revealing of the son of man, Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; choosing a son of man, &gt;&gt; the virginborn son back then now took a redeemed son &gt;&gt; and used him and spoke through him. &gt;&gt; And I believe that that son was faithful right to the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the world has never had such a visitation. Back in Pentecost, they called it the gift of discernment. Not the gift of discernment. They missed it completely. It's not it's not the uh gift of discernment. It's not the gift of prophecy. A gift of prophecy a person might use once, &gt;&gt; might prophesy and prophesy once, but a prophet is born a prophet. &gt;&gt; He's born that. He's gifted that way. He hasn't even got any choice. He's born a prophet. &gt;&gt; Before he was even conceived in the womb, Jeremiah spoke, God speaking to him, God letting him know, before you're even conceived, I ordained you a prophet to the nation. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes. &gt;&gt; You won't be comfortable here if you don't believe that. &gt;&gt; So, we have received now in the sign of his coming. In the sign of his coming, he just says I'll talk to her for a moment. Just I'll talk to her for a minute now. Not me, Messiah, but Messiah is talking through me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not me, Messiah, &gt;&gt; but Messiah talking through me &gt;&gt; in the sign of his coming. He said that generation. &gt;&gt; He said that generation and this is it. &gt;&gt; Would receive a sign. &gt;&gt; You believe this? &gt;&gt; You believe this? &gt;&gt; He said what kind of a sign? &gt;&gt; This generation receive a sign and this is it. And what sign? As Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days, the son of man shall be in the heart of the earth. What kind of a sign would they receive? A resurrection sign to show to prove a demonstration of the project that the that the tomb is empty. That he's not there. In fact, he's here. &gt;&gt; And he's not just 40 years ago. He's here. The exact same resurrected Christ is here in this building. &gt;&gt; And for those that believe it, you receive it. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; He didn't resurrect just for himself. He resurrected to demonstrate this is what I'm going to do. Children, will you believe it? Will you receive it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He died for us. We're so willing to give him our sins. But now we receive eternal life &gt;&gt; which we are possessors of that eternal life. &gt;&gt; What kind of a sign? A resurrection sign. Jesus is not dead but alive. Now the prophets, apostle Peter said in 1 and 11, searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify. So now they're searching of what manner of time when was the time going to intersect with their prophecy. What manner of time that the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand &gt;&gt; of the sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow. &gt;&gt; So they spoke of the sufferings of Christ and the glory which should follow and the Holy Spirit of God which was in them. And they as men and prophets they were seeking to know when is this time? When is the time going to intersect with my prophecy? &gt;&gt; Because they wanted to be part of it and the glory which should follow. &gt;&gt; So you see my thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is spoken but the time has to intersect with the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen close. It doesn't have to be spoken again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham doesn't have to call the resurrection. &gt;&gt; He's called to announce this is the time of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The resurrection doesn't need another voice. It's already been spoken. And now he sends a vindicated messenger to say the time has arrived. &gt;&gt; And all it calls for is people to believe it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When is it going to happen? Maybe before we leave church. &gt;&gt; But all that is essential to the resurrection is here. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can say the shout is here, &gt;&gt; the voice is here, &gt;&gt; and the whole element of the trumpet is here. The gathering will be gathering. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the nations and the religious world and those elected, the nations and the religious world and those elected to that time. All needed to be in place for the scripture to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Caiaphas had to be there. Pilate had to be there. Herod had to be there. The disciples had to be there. They all had to be there. They all had to arrive at the right time. And then it wasn't some great announcement again. It just happened. &gt;&gt; It just happened. &gt;&gt; When the promise and time meet or they intersect, we as creatures of time are subject to our surroundings. where you know things happen around us and civilization goes on. We don't have any choice about a whole lot of things. We just keep trying to make the right decisions moving along within the environment that we're this generation is ages is just light years away from what was just a few years ago. If I just talk about my youth, you might think we were back in the dark ages. &gt;&gt; And that's not very long ago. &gt;&gt; I went to work. I went to work as a young fellow in my teens. I didn't know what a credit card was. Never saw one. There wasn't any. I think it was one of the big department stores, Montgomery Ward or Sears or somebody was the first one to put out credit cards. We got we got cash in a little pay envelope and we lived on that cash till the next one came and just all kinds of things. You'd say, "Oh my goodness, how old are you, brother Biscus?" None of your business, but I can tell you it's not that long ago. &gt;&gt; And we live good. &gt;&gt; Gas was 30 cents a gallon. And the coin in my pocket was 99% pure silver. Not the pot metal you got that's probably made out of beer cans. And our dollar was worth almost a dollar, not just a few cents. And we live fine. We live fine. And strawberries tasted like strawberries, not sawdust. Right. &gt;&gt; I could go on, but I've got to stop right here. &gt;&gt; And everything we ate was organic. It wasn't hard, but I mean, all this civilization has things got better? Well, I don't really think so. We won't get on that. But Jesus said, "But when the comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; whom the Father will send in my name, &gt;&gt; he shall teach you all things &gt;&gt; and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham in the future home takes that same that same scripture when he the Holy Ghost has come, he will bring these things to your remembrance. and he breaks and says, "Show you what day you're living in." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is here to show us what day it is we're living in. &gt;&gt; Been so faithful. &gt;&gt; Now, he sends with abundant vindication, confirmation of the Holy Ghost all these years, year after year after year. Don't lose it, friends. Don't miss it. to show you what day you're living in. That Holy Spirit isn't off somewhere. That Holy Spirit is right here hovering over this audience dwelling in you to lead you, to guide you into all truth and show you what day we're living in. &gt;&gt; And I declare we're living in a resurrection hour. &gt;&gt; We're living in a rapture age. [Applause] [Music] The resurrection by the voice of God in these last days. &gt;&gt; God foretold what was in his thoughts through the mouth of his holy prophets. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'll take for example, I'm taking all of this time leaving the making the foundation for the rapture. So you can ponder the rapture uh a from the perspective of how the God dealt with the prophets in the past to give us a better uh a better position from which to project this rapture time and this resurrection time. Now the Bible says concerning the birth of Jesus and many of you have heard me say this perhaps before but not in this context. Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. The birth of Jesus Christ is like a class was on this wise. In other words, this is how it happened. &gt;&gt; When as his mother Mary was supposed to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. This is how it happened. And then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privy. I'm trying. My screen has gone strange. But while, here we are. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee, Mary, thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Now, all this was done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All this was done. Every detail concerning how it happened, &gt;&gt; this the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise. And then he details all about the birth of Christ in a current time. Says, "All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophets saying nobody nobody an angel came and said, you know, and and spoke to her and so on." But there's no great announcement to Israel of what was going to happen. Things just began. A a a a virgin just conceived. Right? &gt;&gt; She was overshadowed of the Holy Ghost. In fact is there was so little feeling with it and so little emotion attached with it that the angel had to come and tell her what had happened. &gt;&gt; That which is conceived in thee is of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine having a Holy Ghost conception? You don't even know what happened. God anchored and the brother Brandham says God anchored the prophet's words &gt;&gt; the word the spoken word that was spoken was anchored in her womb. &gt;&gt; In other words, if the word had not been spoken, there had been nothing to anchor there. &gt;&gt; So the time intersected with the event. The spoken word that was spoken came to its intersection with time. &gt;&gt; What had to be there? The chosen virgin had to be there. &gt;&gt; Mary, the young girl had to be there. And and the others had to be there. Joseph had to be there. And Simeon had to be there. And Anna and and and and those that had to be there. And John the Baptist, he had to come just ahead of time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So all this had to happen. It happened on this wise and this is why it happened because prophets spoke it. &gt;&gt; Now I say to you the resurrection's been spoken of. Apostle Paul has spoken of it. He gave it in Thessalonians the first chapter. Now comes the Jesus Christ, the son of man, uh, standing at the pulpit in a visual pillar of fire and all of the signs and wonders and vindication and people's names being told, their addresses being told for years and years and years and years. What's he trying to say to this generation? Trying to say, "Wake up, folks. &gt;&gt; Here it is. &gt;&gt; This is what the first church age messenger spoke of. Here it is. You wonder what day you're living in. The Holy Ghost is revealing what day you're living in. &gt;&gt; This is it. This is what they've waited for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The theophanes must be moving close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Very small step. &gt;&gt; So now we get the point. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and be with child, shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emanuel, which being interpreted is God with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the no wonder the a the disciples or I should say the apostles were desiring to know what hour that this was going to take place in then we can say now we've talked about the birth of Jesus Christ being spoken and then the event just happening. Now concerning the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So David the psalmist also called a prophet but he wasn't a prophet at the status of Nathan because he didn't consult Nathan about certain things. But David said for thou wilt not leave my soul. He uses in a personal text, personal pronoun, for thou will not leave my soul in hell. Neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he just spoke it. Then hundreds of years later, now we're into the book of Acts and Peter's preaching in Acts 2:24, whom God is speaking of Jesus Christ, and he's identifying by the Holy Ghost that has come into him. He stands up on the day of Pentecost. Now the Holy Ghost is present to identify that the hour has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should beholden of it. For David speaketh concerning him. For I I forsaw the Lord always before my face. For he is on my right hand that I should not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue all was glad. Moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell. Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption. No one had to come and make some grand announcement. It was already prophesied. Now the time had arrived. &gt;&gt; What brought him out of the tomb. The words had already been spoken hundreds of years before they'd been spoken. He didn't need another announcement. &gt;&gt; The rapture doesn't need another announcement. &gt;&gt; The prophet preached it so that you and I would know by the Holy Spirit. And he talks about the coming of the Holy Ghost in our time &gt;&gt; to make known the scripture that pertains to us &gt;&gt; to let us know the children, the time has arrived. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have to sit and sweat and worry and and and twist and turn and wonder how's it going to happen? When's it going to happen? Is it is it his voice or whose voice is it? The voice has already been spoken. &gt;&gt; The voice is the voice of Christ himself. He's already spoken. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, all three while he's descending." Well, we'll come to that in a moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said over Jerusalem, "If thou hast known, even thou at least in this day, &gt;&gt; the things which belong unto thy peace, but now they are hid from thy eyes." &gt;&gt; Many things have been spoken of Christ and coming and the Messiah and all of that. Even all the way back to Moses, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Jesus was there as a type of Isa Isaac. Isaac was the promised son. Here's the promised son. But it means more to us today. &gt;&gt; The promised son. &gt;&gt; Moses said, "A prophet shall the Lord God you're raised up like unto me." That was him. &gt;&gt; Here he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if we could correctly place the prophet's ministry, I'm speaking of our brother Brandham's ministry in the word and in time, we would be able to see and know the day that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm trying to give you a number of places. Now, &gt;&gt; Paul said in Galatians, "Wherefore then serveth the law?" Question. What's what does how does the law serve? What's the purpose of the law? It was added because there was a whole time before Moses gave the law. There was generations of people that lived without the law, lived by their own conscience. But now came a law. It was added because of transgressions. So then the law came and then people became aware I'm transgressing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Because there were transgressions. Because of transgressions till or until the seed should come to whom the promise was made. So the law came &gt;&gt; to show the transgressions until the seed would come or the children would arrive to whom the promise was made. Now, Apostle Paul is off in the New Testament and Christ the promised promised one has already come and he says uh until the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. In other words, the principle is that the the law, what was the purpose of the law? Well, because of transgressions. Because there were transgressions. But that was until the seed would come until the children would come to whom these promises were made. My point is that the promise was made and maybe years later or hundreds of years later the children came to whom this promise was made. &gt;&gt; God spoke to Abraham told him your your seed is going to be in a strange land and they're going to be in bondage and after 400 years I'm going to come and deliver them. Well, that was already spoken to Abraham. I don't know who he spoke it to. But then the time came when the children to whom that promise was made was there and God raised up a deliverer and took him out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until the seed should come to whom the promise was made. Now, in the rapture message, some of this sounds like it's repeating, but I need to repeat it to stay in continuity. The first thing is a shout and then a voice and then a trumpet. A shout, a messenger, a messenger getting the people ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The second is a voice of the resurrection. And that's where I have the title to this message. The voice of the resurrection. What is the voice? Is it is it someone coming? And what's the voice? What is somebody going to stand and say? All you that are asleep in the dirt, come up. No, it's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; God even spoke to Daniel concerning his people &gt;&gt; and said this to Daniel. And at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people. Here's where a lot of denominations got mixed up. Brother Brand makes a point. Thy people which was the Jews. And there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation, even to the same time. And at that time thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book. &gt;&gt; And many of them that sleep in the dust, not all, but many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. Now that's been spoken. &gt;&gt; God never has to come and say it again. &gt;&gt; Time will intersect with that prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Daniel's children, Daniel's brethren will awake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they'll come forth from the dust. Why will they come forth? Because it was spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was spoken because it was God's thought. And God spoke it through a vessel &gt;&gt; and laid it down in a book &gt;&gt; and then it'll ha it'll just happen. &gt;&gt; When it'll happen, that's God's business. &gt;&gt; It my business, your business is to believe what he said. &gt;&gt; We don't have to have another sign and another sign and another confirmation and another sign. When God sends a a prophet that for years and years and years stands before tens of thousands of people and shows the sign of the Messiah and then tells us this is rapture season. This is a sign of the resurrection. I have one announcement to make to everybody at streaming whoever here. You better hear it that that's already happened. &gt;&gt; It's already been declared and God doesn't have to confirm it again. And I furthermore, I don't think he will confirm it again. &gt;&gt; It's up to you and I to receive it. [Music] &gt;&gt; So the message he said is the shout in this day. &gt;&gt; It's only announcing that the day or the season for these things to take place has arrived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're walking in the light of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the seed to whom the promise was made. &gt;&gt; The children are here. &gt;&gt; We've arrived. &gt;&gt; John had to be there. Peter had to be there. I have to be here. You have to be here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Daniel had to be there at at that time. Daniel had to be The Hebrew children had to be there. But we have to be here. That was their part. That was their day. This is ours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; And no wonder the seals had to be opened. And he declares in the breach that this is the claiming time. &gt;&gt; He's claim he bought you. &gt;&gt; You belong to him. &gt;&gt; He already paid for you. &gt;&gt; And now he's came. &gt;&gt; In an adopted son to claim you. &gt;&gt; Say, how did he claim? He spoke a word that you couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You couldn't get away from it &gt;&gt; because it got a holier heart and he pulled you to himself fulfilling the scripture. I will come and receive you unto myself. &gt;&gt; He's already received you &gt;&gt; to himself. &gt;&gt; He's the word and sent the Holy Spirit into you to let you know that the day has arrived. And I'm telling you, and maybe there's a pull in your heart and God caused me to come to the platform to tell you it's already happened. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's not going to come and say anymore. &gt;&gt; He's already done it. &gt;&gt; So, I feel a pull. No wonder we feel a pull. &gt;&gt; How faithful he is. How wonderful he is. &gt;&gt; I'm so thrilled, friends. I just I just feel like stopping and going home and having a rejoicing time. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about the descending for a moment. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Jesus descended all through the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; We say he's all he does this while he's descending. &gt;&gt; He descending for couple thousand years. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And a prophet comes and says, "That was him &gt;&gt; back in Abraham's time. &gt;&gt; That was him, Elohim, that was there. That was him that was Melzdc. That was him in the burning bush. That was him. The water coming out of the rock. That was him. The mana coming down from heaven. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? He defending, &gt;&gt; coming on down, down. Hallelujah. That was him in David. &gt;&gt; That was him in Solomon. And greater than Solomon is here. What's he doing? Coming down, down, down, till finally it's an egg &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary &gt;&gt; and he's descended into a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; He descends until he comes into a body of humiliation. Yes. &gt;&gt; A body that sweats &gt;&gt; when he's hot &gt;&gt; and gets hungry &gt;&gt; when he's without food &gt;&gt; and thirsty when he's without water. A body. Can you think of the King of Kings, &gt;&gt; descending down into this condition, &gt;&gt; descending down till he lost his reputation and was humiliated and spoken of as being of the devil builds above. descending until the most torturous of death. And we don't want to stay on it until his face was mutilated. &gt;&gt; Not for him, for you. &gt;&gt; For me, &gt;&gt; until it was unrecognizable and his beard pulled out and spittle from the spit from the drunken soldiers hanging on his face. right? &gt;&gt; Going to the cross and then he had to descend &gt;&gt; to death. &gt;&gt; And he died. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He died as a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was born as a child. Born as a man. And he died a man's death &gt;&gt; because he was the man, the God man. &gt;&gt; God did not die. Jesus died. And herein is a great mystery of the godhead. &gt;&gt; Not the third person or the second person, but the person &gt;&gt; man said to me, "Well, how do you you believe Jesus was God?" Of course he was God. &gt;&gt; Was he? But he says William Brandham said he was created. Of course he was created. He said, "Ah, nonsense." &gt;&gt; He said he was God. This is the leader of the Pentecostal assembly. He was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said, "We believe that." &gt;&gt; I said, "Just a second though. Did your God come out of a woman's womb in the mess of childbirth?" He's just looking at me. I said, "Did your God hang on a cross, gasping for breath and finally hanging his head and dying? Did your God die? &gt;&gt; He couldn't answer it. I said, "You don't understand the Godhead." &gt;&gt; God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God was manifesting himself. Jesus healed because God was a healer. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew all things because God knew all things. &gt;&gt; But there were some things that Jesus didn't even know himself. He said, "Even the Son doesn't know. Not even the angels in heaven, only the father. &gt;&gt; He was the God man. You got it? &gt;&gt; You understand it, young people? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he sunk down to death, descended, and died as a man. &gt;&gt; And then he wasn't finished. &gt;&gt; No. He descended further into the regions of the lost, &gt;&gt; into the regions of the damned. And he preached to them that what Noah preached was correct. What Abraham said was right. &gt;&gt; But Job said was righteous. &gt;&gt; Job was righteous and all his other friends and whatever more. And he preached to the souls in prison. &gt;&gt; And he descended further and went to Satan's house. said, "You ory creature, &gt;&gt; you oraryy one, I'm going to strip you of the keys of death, hell, and the grave. Tore them off. Tore the prison prison bars and the and and the saints came up and walked on the streets of Jerusalem." Do you believe it back there? You believe it? Up in the balcony. Hallelujah. You believe it. He's the one who's here. He's the one who says, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. &gt;&gt; Greater is he that's in you &gt;&gt; than even Satan himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I live, he said, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he descended to the depths. He descended and then he rose and ascended and then he began another descent. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He began to descend &gt;&gt; down through seven church ages &gt;&gt; down all through the ages and finally descended deeper and deeper until he comes into the darkness and the debauchery of Satan's Eden. Why? Because you and I are there. And he tears the bars open in Leoda and says, "Come on out, children. Here I am. Here I am. I spoke at Luke 17:30, but here I am. The prophecy and the event have come together. &gt;&gt; The prophecy and the time have intersected &gt;&gt; and you had to be here. You have to hear it. &gt;&gt; I think of where we came from. &gt;&gt; I think of the people the from the colony, from China, from the uh Midwest, wherever we come from, come from Argentina or South America or Central America or Africa, wherever we were, God by his spirit found you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He can't lose you because he can't lose one of his. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And what was that voice? The voice of the resurrection. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You said, "Well, how are they going to come?" You've already heard it. &gt;&gt; The message can't be anything else. Jesus does all three while he's descending. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said in the deity of Christ, of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; Amen. This is way back 1949 before many of you were born. God in the beginning made his first man. He made him out of spirit. And spirit is the invisible part of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you don't see. &gt;&gt; Now God made man in his own image. &gt;&gt; And God is a spirit says the Bible. &gt;&gt; And the first man that was made had the government over o over all of creation. Just like the Holy Spirit has government over the church today, he led creation, &gt;&gt; the first man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was no man to till the soil. &gt;&gt; And God made man of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How? Well, I don't know. People, I guess, envision God taking clay with his hands and fingers. I don't know. I think he called for it. &gt;&gt; Hey, you elements that I spoke 50 million years ago, aons of time ago, the pot ash be released, the calcium, &gt;&gt; you come out of the earth. And I have a thought in my mind and I'm superimposing that thought on those elements. And you're going to come out of there and I'm going to have and I'm going to form I'm going to form the first man. &gt;&gt; He was formed. And then God had to breathe into him &gt;&gt; the breath of life. This word, &gt;&gt; this Bible that you have that is spoken by the Holy Spirit is nothing less than the breath of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; And that breath, listen to me, that breath can never be destroyed. &gt;&gt; That breath can never go to hell. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said he put his he put this immortal spirit that never dies into this man and he became more than a brute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He became a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the seed shall not be ever with a shuck. Now 65. You're going from 49 to 65. Adam was spirit to begin with. He made man in his own image. Created him male and female. And then Genesis 2, he created man out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Say, well, why are you speaking this as a resurrection? Well, resurrection actually means to resurrect something. &gt;&gt; And Adam had in, if you allow me the allowance, had in form, in type. There's no great spiritual doctrine, but God actually resurrected him. &gt;&gt; Took something dead, &gt;&gt; lifeless, &gt;&gt; and made it come to life. &gt;&gt; But dust thou art, &gt;&gt; and if you eat of this tree, dust shalt thou return to. Hold it. I'm not done. Created man in the dust of the earth. Then when he became flesh man, animal flesh of the earth, he's showing portraying here the bride. He never taken and made another being. He took part of Adam, &gt;&gt; the original creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. took from him a rib from his side, took the feminist spirit &gt;&gt; out of Adam, left the masculine spirit in there &gt;&gt; and placed it in the feminist part and therefore part of his spirit, &gt;&gt; part of his body, &gt;&gt; flesh of his flesh, &gt;&gt; and bone of his bone &gt;&gt; and word of his word and life of his life. &gt;&gt; And that's the way the bride is to Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bram says many times and women feel sometimes I think maybe uh some feel jilted about it. I'm not talking about believers. Says, "Well, woman wasn't in the original creation." No, but we are part of the original creation in Christ. &gt;&gt; But if you're not in him, you're not part of the original creation. &gt;&gt; But we're part of the original creation because we've been taken out of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've received part of his spirit. &gt;&gt; He's the masculine spirit. We have the feminine spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God has it all. &gt;&gt; He has all the attributes of motherhood. He has all the attributes of a woman. All the attributes of a man. He's God. &gt;&gt; True. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, now we're just taking a slight curve, but don't don't get lost now. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, "Because thou hast done this, not because thou has thought this, because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above all above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shalt go." He was not on his belly. He was upright. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." And he bruised him at Calvary. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ crushed his head at Calvary. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there was no woman that ever had seed aside from man other than the Virgin Mary. &gt;&gt; And that was the seed of the woman. &gt;&gt; That's the only woman that had seed. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you say, "Well, we've heard that many times, but some of some others here perhaps have not heard it." Lucifer, now listen closely. Lucifer desired one the one thing that God had withheld from him and that was the power to create. &gt;&gt; I'm coming I'm on the subject of resurrection. In the seal of the antichrist he says the right-hand man of almighty God was Lucifer &gt;&gt; the son of the morning. The Bible calls him the son of the morning. God granted him almost almost co-workers with him. He was a co-worker partly equal with him. Only Satan could not create. &gt;&gt; God is the only creator. &gt;&gt; But Satan took something that God created and perverted it back into something else, evil. And now notice when Cain and Abel, a very beautiful picture of it. Cain and Abel was nothing more than a prefigure of Judas and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this okay? &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; As Isaiah, now the prophet is speaking, God is speaking through the prophet Isaiah. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer? How are you fallen from heaven? He descended too. &gt;&gt; Not the same way. &gt;&gt; Oh Lucifer, son of the morning, how art thou cast down to the earth which did weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thy heart, didn't have time. Thou hast said in thy heart, notice please, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. And the sides of the north pertain to that procreative power. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds and I will be like the most high. That's what he said in his heart. &gt;&gt; That's what he would become. You know, our cemeteries are full of tombstones and people are dying by the multitude every day. why his death reigned so supreme on the earth. Because he said this, &gt;&gt; and God God exposed his heart and his intent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we talk about resurrection, we're talking about God empowering us &gt;&gt; to re to re to reverse this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will ascend. I will go up. I will extend my boundaries. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what he wanted to do. I will ascend. I'm going to extend my boundaries. The Almighty has said that I cannot create, but I'm going to extend my boundaries. I'm going to find a way. I'm going to pervert. I'm going to do something. &gt;&gt; I'm going to excel. I'm going to be superior. &gt;&gt; I'm going to lift up myself. I'm going to rise. I've been cast to the earth. But now he's going to take a body of the earth, &gt;&gt; Eve, the only one with a womb. And he cannot create a seed, but he's going to take the only one in the garden that can actually mingle with her. &gt;&gt; And that's the closest he can come to being a creator. You're thinking deep &gt;&gt; by perversion he came as close as it was possible to be a creator. And then from there all humanity and everybody in this building, everyone listening to me and everyone that's breathing breath has come through a perverted way. Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come through a sexual birth through the woman &gt;&gt; and as a result we die. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a change in your body &gt;&gt; and if you don't have eternal life, you're going to die in just an animal's death in that sense. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to the body. Yes, sir. I will exalt. I will ascend. I will exalt. I will sit and I will be like. You should take and read it. Satan was cast out of heaven. The scripture says in Revelation 12:7, can I go on a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought in his angels and prevailed not. I say praise God. Hallelujah. Neither was there found place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out. That old serpent called the devil and Satan. I say hallelujah. Hallelujah. He was cast out of where I'm going. which deceiveth the whole world and was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him. &gt;&gt; Notice now the whole intent of Satan Lucifer expressed it in the words I will. &gt;&gt; And he gathered up and mingled with all of the subility and cunningness that he was possessed when he approached Steve. And this was his moment. This would be the closest, as I said earlier, that he would ever come to becoming a creator. And I need to read this for you. Can you listen closely? I wanted to have these in slides so you could read it, but just let give me a few moments. Here is where we receive, brother Benam, this is an Ephesian church age. Here is where we receive the true revelation of the serpent's seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here is what Here's what really happened in the Garden of Eden. The word says, now let me just stop here for a moment to clear up some thoughts if you in case you have some thoughts. When you have as such as I have sitting like where brother Tom is and have this servant messenger, prophet messenger stand there and tell a person you were to a doctor yesterday or you were to a doctor last week. How does he know he was at a doctor last week or she was at a doctor and knows what the doctor said? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in some cases read what was on the doctor's report &gt;&gt; and that's in the past. If you can go back 24 hours, you can go back 24 million years. &gt;&gt; There's no time with God. &gt;&gt; And this messenger could tell just exactly tell her what's on that report and that the doctors couldn't find it and exactly what it is. Here he's spelling it out and telling her where she come from. That's the wisdom of God &gt;&gt; that he sent in this generation so that you'd have confidence that that kind of wisdom can tell where Satan came, how he got into the humanity, and tell you and I where we're going. [Music] &gt;&gt; You need to have confidence in that. &gt;&gt; I declare in the name of the Lord, you've never heard a voice like that voice. and it and God will never send it again. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about these kind of prophecies. Yay, the Lord said this and the Lord said. I'm not making fun of that. They can have that. But this is absolutely prophetic &gt;&gt; by a born messenger. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he says the word says that Eve was beguiled by the serpent. She was actually seduced by the serpent. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. He said this beast was so close to the human human being and yet was pure animal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he could reason and talk and God talked with him and he talked with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; He was an upright creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzeee and a man, but closer to a man. He was so close to being human that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman. When I spoke and you heard Rabbi Richmond here, I had him in the car and I came to the serpent seed. He said, "There are those amongst us of the Jewish people, Orthodox, strict Orthodox that do believe that it was a sexual act in the beginning." I said, "And what about Abel? We believe that Abel was his son." No. He said, 'We don't believe that. They hadn't gone there yet. And I said, Abel lied in the face of God. Adam was God's son, and now you have Abel as Adam's son. Where does this nature come from? &gt;&gt; Lies in the face of God. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Cain lies in the face of God and has murder already in his heart &gt;&gt; and kills &gt;&gt; a son of God. &gt;&gt; Did that come from God? &gt;&gt; And I could see the wheels just grinding and he hung his head and he just was thinking went into deep thought. &gt;&gt; I hope he got deep enough &gt;&gt; that he could reason and talk. He was an upright creature somewhat between a chimpanzeee and a man but closer to a man. He was so close to human being that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and cause her to conceive. And when this happened, God cursed the serpent. He changed every bone in the serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake. Science can try all it wants to and it won't find the missing link. God saw to that. And man is smart and he can see an association of man with the animal and he tries to prove it out in evolution and there isn't any evolution &gt;&gt; man but man and animal did mingle and that's one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden but here it is revealed &gt;&gt; it happened back there in the midst of Eden when Eve turned away from from life to accept death &gt;&gt; and thus we all die. &gt;&gt; But those that have received the life of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; we don't just have a promise. It's already been declared. &gt;&gt; We shall rise &gt;&gt; in the resurrection morning. &gt;&gt; And this might be the morning. &gt;&gt; Shall we all rise? &gt;&gt; Shall we all be changed in the We'll be changed in instant. But the prophet says the sweep will go over us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether that sweep will happen to you and me at the same instant. We believe that it has and it will. I don't know. I do not know. Those are still questions. But it will happen. &gt;&gt; Why will it happen? Cuz it's been spoken. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not being too long with you. &gt;&gt; And he said, notice what God said to them in the garden. I'll put enmity, and he quotes that. I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed. And don't forget, if you have any question in your mind, don't ever forget Genesis 3:15. I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between Satan, God talking to the serpent, and between your seed. &gt;&gt; And just stop there and ask anybody, who is that? &gt;&gt; Who is that? Who was the seed? &gt;&gt; Who was the seed that was going to bruise the heel &gt;&gt; of the woman's seed? And the woman's seed, they all the church world regards that as being Jesus Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They have to. &gt;&gt; I like when one minister was here and someone had a had a had a problem with it and he said, "Well, who who the who who's the seed of the woman?" Said, "Christ." He just said, "Who bruised him? &gt;&gt; Some spirit?" No, it's a man. &gt;&gt; Man bruised him. [Music] &gt;&gt; A portion of the scripture, this portion of the scripture is the revelation of how the literal seed of the serpent was sown in the earth. Even as we have the account of Luke 1:26-35, wherein is it set forth the exact account of how the seed of the woman came into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male? &gt;&gt; Why do you think God had Abraham said, "Circumcise thyself?" Because he and and and he said, "And that foreskin shall be a token unto me." Because God was marking that part of the male body that it shall not have any part of redemption. &gt;&gt; Then Mary said unto the angel, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" And the angel answered and said unto her, "The unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee." Therefore, that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the seed of the woman was literal, literally God reproducing himself in human flesh. &gt;&gt; This is absolute must because he had to descend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, who descended? &gt;&gt; The virgin birth proved that he descended. God came down and was formed in the fashion of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "Why are you spending so much time on this, brother Biscll?" Well, because that is the whole purpose of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; It makes the glory of it when you see how far he descended. That's where we ended up. &gt;&gt; We're at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; We all die &gt;&gt; like a bunch of animals as it were, but inside &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is the seed of almighty God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The seed of the woman literally God reproducing himself in human flesh. So the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found. He was able to open the door to himself into the human race. It was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being. He's only a created spirit being. He didn't have a physical body. Young people, every person. That's why he wants your body. &gt;&gt; He cannot express himself outside of a body. &gt;&gt; If you go into an insane institution, which I have, and you see the people, you can actually see it. They disfigure their their being. Right? &gt;&gt; I've seen them with long nails and creatures and they have their face has become contorted. It's that spirit that's in them that's expressing itself. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you see someone, don't give yourself in to some uh glum and gloom. I've seen people who are professors and they're wonderful believers, but they give themselves in to doom &gt;&gt; and negativity &gt;&gt; and doubt &gt;&gt; and criticism &gt;&gt; and we can get and if you give yourself into that then you you're actually giving a place &gt;&gt; to the enemy. &gt;&gt; I say resist him. &gt;&gt; Cast him out. Yes. &gt;&gt; You have no part with me. &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you can we do that?" Absolutely. Not only can, you must. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says he's only a spirit being to reproduce himself uh to reproduce himself in the manner in which God reproduced himself. So the so the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race. &gt;&gt; Satan using the serpent creature to inject himself into the human race. This is the closest he could get to have something in his image. trying to ascend up to where God said, "Let us make man in our image." This is as close as he could get. And our Lord Jesus, he didn't just come and visit Palestine, but he descended into this age when hell came up to the streets of Vancouver, &gt;&gt; to the streets of Seattle and Bellingham. Hell &gt;&gt; and the great nations of the world. Hell has invaded the governments &gt;&gt; and the educational system &gt;&gt; and the entertainment world &gt;&gt; and has polluted &gt;&gt; even good inventions has polluted them &gt;&gt; and contaminated them &gt;&gt; and has used the internet has used it. You hear preachers preach against it but Satan has invaded it. every part of it &gt;&gt; and caused everything to taste hell. &gt;&gt; And if it were not for the grace of God, &gt;&gt; we would be lost. &gt;&gt; But we're not only found, we're redeemed. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Give me just a few more moments, will you please? &gt;&gt; I won't often. I won't come back to this. And he came and and and Satan today has become a master of the body, gets old and goes towards death, gets a hold of the emotional realm and captures it and captivates it and moves it around. But the soul, the seed, the seed gene that brother Bram talked about of God is out of his reach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I want to rejoice over that this morning. It's out of his reach. &gt;&gt; Satan, you might make me sick and afflicted, but I'm out of your reach. The real me, I'm out of your reach. &gt;&gt; You might depress me. &gt;&gt; You might cast me down. I might get so low, &gt;&gt; but you but my soul is out of your reach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got to dismiss some of this because I want to Well, I'm going to just close with what I'm going to do. Now there's one thing we don't want to get confused about. The Bible says all that are in the grave shall hear his voice. And brother Bram says clearly that is not the resurrection of the saints because then the scripture says that they did not let raise for a thousand years. Says that all that are in the grave shall hear the voice and some to righteousness and some to judgment. That's the great white throne judgment that's spoken of in Revelation. But the Bible tells us also where Apostle Paul speaks, "And the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, and the dead in Christ &gt;&gt; shall rise." Only those in Christ. &gt;&gt; They have they've been believers of the word that God has sent them. And they and they alone shall rise. Hallelujah. [Music] And uh and he says also that that the the third which was the trumpet which always is the feast of trumpets calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride's supper, the lamb's supper with the bride. He says they're caught up and he says we're right there now. We're ready now. The only thing the church coming out has to go to lay before the sun to ripen. And that's what we're here today to do. Say, "Oh son, shine upon me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Make real, &gt;&gt; make reality, &gt;&gt; these words to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I trust that this has given you something further to think about &gt;&gt; in the in the resurrection, the voice of the resurrection. And my whole point today was to let you know the voice. God's already spoke it. &gt;&gt; It's already been spoken. &gt;&gt; And now he has just come and given the the timing and the season. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to detail and say everything. He's saying the time is here. &gt;&gt; We have arrived. &gt;&gt; And how is it going to take place? Well, it's going to be so common. The women, are you listening? Amen. &gt;&gt; The women that came to the tomb that had the spices, they didn't use the spices. It was just so common. Brother Brham, he intended to preach Bruce Serpent and he had his notes and was on his way back to preach Bruce Serpent and he didn't do it. They have been laughed. There will be things that you and I will be fully intent on doing and we just won't get it done. &gt;&gt; Because something else will overtake us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I had for you and it might do good. I I I won't take the time this morning because my time is well gone. I've been an hour and a quarter, hour and a half almost. Uh but I had uh I had put down brother Brandham going beyond the curtain of time. And now I'll just try to &gt;&gt; take it from my memory. Now now he he's just woke up. This is very this probably the best description I can give you the resurrection. He's just woke up and he said he put his hand behind his head like so. He has to get the children to school. So he was getting ready to go up to take him to school. Put his hands behind his head and said, "Well, Bill Brham, you got to think about his life. If you're going to do anything for God, you better you're you're 50." He says one place he told me 52. I think it was 53. 52 53. He said you better get going. He said just at that moment and he told me very clearly there's no sensation, no feeling, no movement, no nothing. He just found himself and he's standing there looking back. He said just a few feet &gt;&gt; one time. He said not over 20 feet. It had to be was in his bedroom and he's looking at himself right there. He'd called his wife and said, "Sweetheart," and she didn't stir. She was still sleeping. Now he's standing here looking at himself. &gt;&gt; He thought, "This is strange." He went like this to me. He says, "I pinched my hand. I bit my finger. I felt for I felt my head because he was baldheaded because he had lost his hair through in a barberh shop through an accident and he felt his hair and he said I had a full head of hair. He said and then he says he saw the women coming. He describes their very different colored hair but all dressed the same and barefooted. All I'm telling you is what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they come running and he says and they began to hug me and then another one would come and hug me and they would say our brother, our precious brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said they were real. And he asked the people to please be please be understanding and please be mature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he talks about the human cell of a human body. And he said you cannot embrace a woman or be embraced by a woman without it causing some sensation. But he said there was none. &gt;&gt; He said we don't have those cells in that body. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said I was in a body. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, dear friends. We're all different ages or different sizes, different background. You have that body &gt;&gt; just beyond your view and beyond your vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That body, he stepped into it. He was instantly in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said if it was a vision, he said, 'I've never had a vision like that. He said in one place he calls it a translation. We are We've already been written down in the translation list. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We shall be changed. &gt;&gt; You shall be translated. And then and then the men came and they began to embrace him. And one woman came and embraced him. Said, "You did you recognize her? She was over 90 years old when you led her to Christ." And then he said, "Who are these people?" &gt;&gt; Said, "These are your these are your people. You have been gathered to your people." And I told all of this and I preached this whole service today so I could come to this point. &gt;&gt; You and I are not just going to die or even when we are changed in the rapture. You're going to be gathered to your people. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's your real family. &gt;&gt; Some of you here maybe without family. You've got a real family. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you, they're going to hug you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; They're going to tell you, "We've been waiting for you. &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this moment." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are your people. He said, "Are these Brhams?" No, these are your converts to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm a convert. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm a convert to this Christ, this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, only makes us treasure this more and more. We see the way people go and what they say and about this messenger I read some woman said just recently she said in a book that brother Brham he liked to be so well thought of he didn't want anybody to think evil or wrong of him. I said, ' Then why'd he preach a servant seed? &gt;&gt; Isn't that foolish? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why'd he preach about women's hair? &gt;&gt; If you want to be well thought of, why do he preach against all homosexuality and why do he preach against all this stuff? You can't find it. In fact, as they turn right around say, his message is too hard. &gt;&gt; Doesn't even make any sense. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he preached it down the line. Aren't you? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. You can rejoice over it. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he preached it straight down the line. &gt;&gt; Anything less would have been too little. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth shall &gt;&gt; set you free. &gt;&gt; You are free. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm on the war path, friends. &gt;&gt; I'm on the war path. &gt;&gt; This Satan, he's a liar. &gt;&gt; He has no part of you. &gt;&gt; Our soul is even out of his reach. &gt;&gt; This isn't just to make you feel good. This is the truth of God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your kind attention. Dear heavenly father, it is with hearts that are filled and overflowing with such thanksgiving to you. We scarcely can express ourselves and we're wondering what you have yet in store for us. Lord, we feel as though we're living right on the very brink of the eternal shores. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that you'll take this blessed, precious assembly and those, oh Father, that will stream or are streaming, I ask that you'll reach out with a special blessing at this time. &gt;&gt; And I pray, oh God, that Satan will be defeated on every front. &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for what you have done and are doing for our brother West Nygard. And I pray, oh God, that that 100% mark &gt;&gt; will be his portion &gt;&gt; even now, oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if there's any sick and afflicted amongst us, lift the affliction from them. &gt;&gt; The same one that was here in our prophet's ministry, you have said, oh God, that you would honor the prayer of a believer. If you shall believe and you shall ask, it shall be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray that you will bless now and honor this prayer as I humbly pray it as your servant in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to sing uh well actually what am I going to do? I want to sing two songs. Let's sing in the resurrection morning. And just while we get ready to sing it. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Well, [Music] you don't mind if I take a moment, do you? [Music] [Music] It's worth waiting for. I want to leave this with you. I would just so blessed. Resurrection. Voice of the resurrection. I get lost in my thoughts. I go far beyond my ability. And I'd like to drop some things in that let you share with that with me. Hallelujah. [Music] in the fundamental foundation for faith. And you might want to remember that some of these things that brother Brandham said even in a very early ministry, I'm just astounded that we weren't catching it back then. He said, "Man was made as a secondary God on earth. He was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth of the earth. That was Adam. Adam was given these great powers. But then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell. The power that he was given to make or reproduce himself is where he fell. That's the fall. Now in the beginning of man, that's what God gave him power over everything on the earth. And now though the through the fall he lost that power. Then he becomes unconscious to the fact after losing his relationship and friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels listen close become clogged up and he couldn't get through. Now what Adam was in God, what Adam was in God, Christ has redeemed us back to that. Now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring it back to its origin again. &gt;&gt; All what he couldn't do is reproduce himself or bring himself back. He couldn't make another son like he was in the original state. And this is why Jesus said, listen very close. No man takes my life from me. &gt;&gt; I, the original, &gt;&gt; I lay it down. &gt;&gt; I take it up again. &gt;&gt; Because he knew who he was. And all that you lost in Adam, the fall, you have gained back in Christ the word. &gt;&gt; You have it. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; You can say without a shadow of a doubt, I shall rise &gt;&gt; because that which is in me will not leave me to corruption. &gt;&gt; I shall rise. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to read that before we sing this song. Let's stand. In the resurrection morning, [Music] when the trump of God shall sound, we shall rise. We shall rise. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise. We shall rise. [Music] His doors are broken. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise in the resurrection morning. What a feeding that will be. We shall rise. We shall rise. When our fathers and our mothers and our loved ones, we shall see. We shall rise. We shall rise. in the resurrection morning. We shall be in the air. We shall rise. We shall rise. and car. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can we say hallelujah? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed father, almighty one, &gt;&gt; revealed through Jesus Christ, made known to us in this generation. I pray that you will bless, oh God, your people, not merely with a blessing, but may the truth and the revelation of your word be like a inner explosion within them. And may faith flow from one to the other. And even as we shake hands with one another today, oh God, may there be something so vibrant within each person. Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I resist every enemy. Satan, you who came to pervert creation, we announce to you that your time is over. You do not have any hold of us. You cannot get a hold of our souls. You cannot destroy permanently this this life that we have that we have in Jesus Christ. We thank you, oh God, for such glorious victory. Let the people now be dismissed and go with joy unspeakable and full of glory. And I pray that you'll bless every man and woman and child for your glory. We thank you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. All I can say is you're dismissed in Jesus' name. And for sure, if we don't meet here at 5:00, we're going to meet just &gt;&gt; the other side of the veil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't even know what I really look like till you get over there. All of you that are around 20 or thereabouts, you young fellas, we we we pretty well know what you're going to look like. You don't know what we're going to look like. All us older people. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; They won't even know. Hallelujah. Somebody just saw a picture on the I think a old video that we had and I was giving a testimony. They said, "You have black hair." I said, "Well, I hope so. I hope I wasn't white when I was a kid." God bless you. &gt;&gt; You're dismissed in Jesus name. Brother Tom is speaking this evening. Brother Murphy's down in Seattle. God bless you all in Jesus name. You're dismissed. Hallelujah. How about you, brother? [Music]
