[13:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:51] Our faith is anchored in the solid rock.
[13:57] Thank you Jesus.
[13:59] I have a couple of prayer requests
[14:01] written in here. One from brother Norm
[14:04] for his wife, Sister Louise, that the
[14:08] neuropathy, the neuropathy in her feet
[14:11] would clear up.
[14:14] And we believe that
[14:18] God is able to do that. Amen. Amen. And
[14:22] it's already done. The Lord has already
[14:24] paid the price. We just claim it in the
[14:27] name of Jesus.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:31] Brother Brandham said, "If Jesus was
[14:34] standing here
[14:36] in flesh once again, wearing a suit of
[14:38] clothes, he could do no more than what
[14:43] he's already done. He shed his blood. He
[14:46] took the stripes on his back for our
[14:48] atonement and our healing. And it's a
[14:51] finished work at Calvary. Our faith
[14:54] looks up to the Lord Jesus.
[14:57] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Brother
[15:00] Glenn also is asking prayer
[15:04] for uh his sister Carol and uh his mom
[15:08] um as Larry, his brother, Brother
[15:11] Glenn's brother went to be with the Lord
[15:13] on Monday at 1:30. So, we just want to
[15:16] remember brother Glenn and his family in
[15:18] prayer.
[15:20] Um, I'm just going to ask brother Mike
[15:23] Ray to come and lead us in prayer and
[15:25] happy to have him home safely tonight.
[15:29] That God will strengthen you and bless
[15:31] you. Amen.
[15:34] Amen. Greetings everybody. God bless
[15:37] you. Good to be home.
[15:40] Greetings from
[15:43] many, many people.
[15:46] Oh my, it's just a joy. I said it many
[15:48] times. It was such a joy just to
[15:50] fellowship with the believers in the uh
[15:52] different parts of the world. You find
[15:54] out that it's like you're next of kin
[15:57] pretty much. You know, you're just you
[15:59] spend an hour with somebody and
[16:00] suddenly, you know, I spent it's like
[16:02] I've been my whole life with you. You
[16:03] know, it's because it's the love of
[16:05] Christ in each one of you that binds you
[16:06] together. And uh we just had just a
[16:08] wonderful time. But our Tim is still
[16:10] there. Pray for him. he's still uh
[16:13] laboring the extra weekend here and been
[16:16] traveling now to the east side of the uh
[16:18] of the country and so lots of travel. So
[16:20] just definitely remember him and give
[16:22] him extra dose of strength and I'm sure
[16:24] we'll have a little bit more of a
[16:26] in-depth report in the coming days
[16:28] ahead. But let's just pray tonight and
[16:31] bring this these requests before the
[16:33] Lord.
[16:35] [Music]
[16:37] Heavenly Father,
[16:40] Lord, many in the world, Lord, they are
[16:43] looking up to many things, Lord,
[16:45] believing in something.
[16:48] Maybe they're believing, Lord, in their
[16:49] entertainment or they're believing in
[16:51] their some celebrity or somebody that
[16:53] they have a up in their mind's eye of
[16:57] what they have faith in. But Lord, our
[16:59] faith looks up to thee, oh lamb of
[17:02] Calvary, Savior divine.
[17:05] Heavenly Father, it's Remembrance Day.
[17:07] Even as we're tomorrow as we were with
[17:09] the children and at a little ceremony
[17:11] this morning and Lord, men had something
[17:13] they to fight for. They fought for
[17:15] something. They fought for freedom,
[17:17] Lord. Believing in something that was
[17:19] worth laying their lives down for, Lord,
[17:21] regardless the cost. They put everything
[17:23] on the line, Lord. And many died. But
[17:25] Lord, I'm so thankful that we had a
[17:27] savior. That Lord, there was something
[17:29] worth fighting for. Lord, you you there
[17:31] was something worth laying your life
[17:32] down for. It was a bride that you
[17:34] desired. It was your people that you
[17:36] wanted fellowship with and you laid your
[17:38] life down at Calvar's cross for your
[17:41] people that we would Lord the chasm
[17:42] would be filled Lord. The gap Lord would
[17:45] n no longer be there. Healing stripes
[17:47] would be borne on your back because it
[17:49] was worth it to you Lord for your people
[17:51] so that we could receive the benefits of
[17:53] Calvary. So tonight Lord we're bringing
[17:56] these needs before you. We're bringing
[17:58] Lord our brother, our sister Louise,
[17:59] Lord, this neuropathy in her feet, Lord.
[18:01] And Lord, it's a demon to diabetes that
[18:04] we're battling here for her. But Lord,
[18:06] you you fought that battle. You bore
[18:08] those stripes. Lord, we just believe in
[18:10] it now. Lord, our faith is anchored in
[18:13] that victory. So Lord, we pray tonight
[18:16] something would strike Sister Louise's
[18:17] heart as we've laid it before you time
[18:19] and time again. But our faith, like
[18:21] Abraham, will not stagger. We won't
[18:24] falter. will bring it before you and
[18:26] hold it in our hearts for Lord, it's a
[18:28] finished work. Lord, we believe we're

[18:59] It's midweek, Lord, and we're going

[19:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would meet every divine
[19:10] need tonight, Lord, and in your perfect
[19:13] way, Lord, if they could put it on their
[19:15] lips tonight, Lord, not keep it in their
[19:17] mind, but open their hearts, open their
[19:19] mouths, and lift up our voices to you
[19:21] and say, "Lord, I need you tonight.
[19:23] Speak to my soul. Lord, bring a balm to

[19:36] throne of God. So we commit this service

[26:01] Sounds like we're in the house.
[26:04] Man, I didn't uh I didn't know I was
[26:06] going to go through memory lane. Those
[26:08] are I think the two songs at first. I
[26:10] thank God he brought me in. He wasn't
[26:13] looking at me. Was looking at the blood.
[26:16] Those are the first two Christian songs
[26:17] I really learned at Bible way. But the
[26:20] first one was only
[26:23] believe.
[26:25] What a song. What a song. Only believe.
[26:28] And then these were the next two songs.
[26:30] And thank you, brother Ray. Thank you
[26:33] for that tonight. Well, I've got a
[26:35] couple announcements to make. I'm happy
[26:37] that the Lord's brought brother Michael
[26:39] home safe and sound. And I've had some
[26:42] great reports. We'll be hearing from
[26:44] Brother Michael and Lord willing on
[26:46] Wednesday. Get his uh time clock all
[26:49] turned right. And uh it'll be a
[26:51] wonderful, wonderful service. Lord
[26:53] willing, I'll be leaving tomorrow for
[26:55] Dallas, Texas to have the annual
[26:57] meetings with Brother David McGary.
[26:59] Please remember me while I'm away. And
[27:01] I'll be remembering you and I'm sure
[27:03] Brother Murphy will deliver a
[27:05] masterpiece. Of course, he always
[27:06] delivers a masterpiece, but it'll be the
[27:08] best one ever while I'm away. That's
[27:11] always what happens. And so, we want to
[27:13] be remembering Brother Murphy for this
[27:15] weekend. Also, we want to make an
[27:17] announcement for uh we've been planning
[27:20] since August. We've talked uh Michael
[27:22] has in particular been speaking to the
[27:24] Powels when we were having camp uh for
[27:27] Thanksgiving and we're going to have um
[27:30] a Thanksgiving dinner on the Saturday
[27:33] night of uh November the uh 27th. And
[27:39] then Sunday morning will be our morning
[27:41] service and we'll have it there at the
[27:42] camp with the Canadians able now to
[27:45] drive across. We think there'd be a
[27:47] great opportunity to join Artica fires
[27:50] now with them. And uh we'll have to go
[27:53] through a few hoops, but the hoops, you
[27:55] know, are getting dissolved. And I want
[27:57] you to know they're getting dissolved
[27:59] because of prayer
[28:01] &gt;&gt; there. That was on the prayer board.
[28:02] Lord, take the bureaucratic nonsense
[28:06] away and let the sons and daughters
[28:08] rejoice together. And so then if you
[28:11] wish to go down on the Friday, there
[28:13] will be uh just uh let the uh office
[28:15] know and we'll have a cabin for you,
[28:18] whatever you want. We just want to have
[28:19] a wonderful weekend around the word of
[28:22] God. Amen. Another note, another note.
[28:26] I've had um different requests from the
[28:30] sisters regarding the prayer meetings.
[28:32] Brother Curtis, apparently brother
[28:35] Curtis last night ignited the prayer
[28:37] meeting. Did you know that, Brother
[28:38] Curtis? I know. Oh, you didn't know. I I
[28:41] got the I I never was able to make it
[28:43] last night or on Monday night. And
[28:46] brother Curtis, I think you mentioned
[28:47] you said, "We're not on the defense,
[28:49] we're on the offense." Is that true? And
[28:53] that that just hit the hearts of the
[28:56] brothers and they had a tremendous
[28:58] prayer meeting and I'm so thankful for
[29:01] that. So on December 6th will be the
[29:03] first Monday, we'll have a family prayer
[29:06] meeting.
[29:11] Yeah, I I I expect it to be an amazing I
[29:15] think the brothers have um have asked me
[29:18] maybe they like to have their wives and
[29:20] their children with them and we'll just
[29:22] make room for the fellowship room. We'll
[29:24] pack it out and we will have a prayer
[29:26] meeting. Amen. It'll be something very,
[29:29] very special, I'm sure. So, you want to
[29:31] put that down. December the 6th will be
[29:35] a family prayer meeting in the
[29:37] fellowship room.
[29:38] And the brothers will not hold back.
[29:42] They will come to the forefront. Right,
[29:44] Brother Jean? We're going to storm
[29:46] heaven together. God's been doing
[29:48] marvelous things amongst us. Actually,
[29:50] there's another young lady that the
[29:52] Lord's dealing with in baptism and we
[29:54] will be having some time, I'm sure,
[29:56] before that happens. So, God's just keep
[29:59] on moving. And we are expecting Sister
[30:02] Louise feet to be fine. Brother Norm,
[30:05] we're believing for that. and we're
[30:07] believing for a total miracle.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Well, tonight we're going to have a
[30:12] guest speaker
[30:14] and um since he's away, I thought we
[30:18] could maybe show some uh uh one of
[30:20] brother Biscll's services that he spoke
[30:23] in 2002.
[30:25] And um you know, it's pretty awkward
[30:28] when somebody's here and you're playing
[30:31] one of their services. And so with
[30:33] brother Ed getting away and getting some
[30:36] rest, we thought he was going through
[30:38] some um services and I've got one on my
[30:40] mind that we'd I'd love for you to see.
[30:44] And um so tonight we're going to have
[30:47] brother Biscll preached to us. It's a
[30:49] message he preached and um it's called
[30:52] the transforming power in the seed and
[30:56] it'll be out of Romans chapter 8 verse
[30:59] 29. So, if you don't mind to stand,
[31:06] we're going to go straight to the word.
[31:11] I don't know whether we've I can't
[31:14] remember the last time we've done this.
[31:15] I can remember we did one of Donnie
[31:17] Reagan's one time. Um, and we just
[31:20] thought tonight that this would be a
[31:21] grand opportunity to see our pastor
[31:24] minister the word of God. It's from
[31:25] 2002. If the brothers would turn that
[31:31] reading in Romans 8
[31:35] uh verse 29.
[31:38] For whom he did forno, he also did
[31:42] predestinate
[31:44] to be conformed to the image of his son
[31:48] that he might be the firstborn
[31:51] among many brethren.
[31:53] We are observing immediately
[31:57] that there is for knowledge, there is
[32:01] predestination,
[32:03] there is the power of transformation or
[32:07] to be conformed to the image of his son
[32:11] and that he might be the firstborn among
[32:13] many brethren. So we speak about birth
[32:16] and you cannot speak about birth without
[32:19] speaking about conception. You cannot
[32:21] speak about conception unless you speak
[32:23] about seed.
[32:25] So we have those things in our minds.
[32:29] Turn then to Philippians the 3 chapter
[32:35] and verse 21.
[32:40] I'll read verse 20 as well. For our
[32:43] conversation is in heaven, from whence
[32:46] also we look for the Savior, the Lord
[32:50] Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile
[32:53] body, that it may be fashioned like unto
[32:57] his glorious body, according to the
[33:00] working whereby he is able even to
[33:03] subdue all things.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Unto himself.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[33:07] You will see the word conformed
[33:11] in one verse and portion of scripture
[33:14] and the word fashioned
[33:16] &gt;&gt; in the next one. And I will have you
[33:19] read in Genesis 1:1 with me.
[33:29] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[33:32] and the earth. And the earth was without
[33:35] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[33:38] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[33:41] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[33:44] God said, "Let there be light." And
[33:47] there was light.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:58] one of the most
[34:01] holy
[34:03] and sacred
[34:08] actually I would say indescribable and
[34:11] mysterious relationships
[34:14] that we can know of in this life and
[34:17] that has to do with marriage
[34:21] and uh it's just there is a a mystery to
[34:25] it because somehow it reflects back into
[34:30] what was in deep in the mind of God
[34:35] and so much of the scripture
[34:39] references to it. It uh so much of the
[34:42] scripture the whole theme of the
[34:44] scripture is a love it's a love story.
[34:48] The whole theme of the scripture is a
[34:51] uniting of God with humanity
[34:55] &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ with his bride.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And that is why the story begins with
[35:03] Adam, the first Adam and God bringing
[35:06] his mate to him.
[35:09] And it ends in the revelation
[35:13] with the one showing John these things,
[35:17] saying, "Come hither and I will show you
[35:19] the the lamb, the bride, the lamb's
[35:23] wife." So this is much of the story.
[35:28] And uh we realize that something must
[35:32] take place
[35:33] with us and in us something very
[35:36] glorious and dramatic.
[35:39] As Paul said, if only in this life we
[35:41] have hope, we are of all men most
[35:44] miserable.
[35:46] So we're not gathered here today to
[35:49] listen to a sermon. And I hope we're not
[35:52] gathered here today and we don't gather
[35:54] in this place because we have some
[35:57] obligation to have church services
[36:00] or to sing or to worship or to enjoy one
[36:03] another. Although these are some of the
[36:05] benefits,
[36:07] we certainly don't gather for any other
[36:10] purpose than to hear what the spirit of
[36:15] God has to say to the church.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; We want to hear what his voice
[36:20] is speaking to us.
[36:23] Now this this word conformed
[36:27] to
[36:29] not just conformed but conformed to
[36:32] there's a distinct thought of God. What
[36:35] the what he's conforming us to. And in
[36:39] the scripture in Philippians it spoke of
[36:42] us being fashioned not just fashioned
[36:45] but fashioned unto.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there's a there's a thought
[36:49] and a theme. And to be conformed or
[36:53] fashioned like unto it's having having
[36:57] the same form as another
[37:02] conformed to des it's describes what is
[37:05] the essence in character and thus
[37:09] complete or durable.
[37:12] Now the words that are used here I want
[37:14] you to hear it closely. It is having the
[37:18] same form as another.
[37:21] Conformed to describes
[37:24] what is the essence in character and
[37:28] thus complete absolutely complete. We're
[37:32] to be conformed to the image of his dear
[37:37] son.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; That is an identical
[37:41] complete in character in every other
[37:44] way. Now there's another word that's
[37:46] used in the Bible
[37:49] and it it it also uses the word conform.
[37:53] But that conform
[37:56] has to do with to conform one's self,
[38:00] one's mind, one's character. That's what
[38:04] I would say most people do on New Year's
[38:08] Eve. They make their resolutions.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; They're going to conform oneself.
[38:14] They're going to try to uh uh emulate
[38:19] something else or someone else or
[38:21] another nature or another character to
[38:24] conform oneself to another pattern to
[38:27] fashion oneself according to something
[38:29] that they see out there. That is not
[38:32] what God is talking about. He's not
[38:35] talking about you trying to selfconform
[38:38] or reform yourself. He's talking about
[38:40] what he has already determined to do.
[38:44] Furthermore, he has set things in motion
[38:47] because his system is to bring seed to a
[38:51] certain bedding ground called a womb.
[38:54] And then all the life of God that God
[38:58] has intended is in that seed.
[39:03] And so now there is a there's a process
[39:07] and I like to have my emphasis on the
[39:10] process. If you don't mind, I'm going to
[39:12] follow my notes quite closely because I
[39:15] very prayerfully and have pondered these
[39:18] things and I want to follow a certain
[39:20] sequence if I if I can. There's a
[39:24] emphasis on a process and I want to read
[39:27] two quotes from brother Brandham's
[39:29] messages and one is an identification.
[39:34] He he said he makes a statement. The
[39:36] word the word molds God's character in
[39:41] us. And I'd like you to accept the
[39:44] statement for it for all that it means.
[39:49] And aside from any other experiences
[39:51] you've had, the word molds God's
[39:55] character in us.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; And the word, Jesus said, is the seed.
[40:01] That's God's seed.
[40:03] He went on to say, "And your character
[40:05] will not mix with the world."
[40:08] If you are being molded in the form of
[40:11] God by letting the mind that was in
[40:14] Christ be in you, that's the control
[40:17] tower. And that's the direction. That's
[40:21] the direction in the message thirst.
[40:24] Now, this is a little bit lengthy, but
[40:26] hang on to each word if you would
[40:28] please, like we having a Sunday school
[40:30] lesson.
[40:32] Just remember when you were in the
[40:35] loins, when you were in your father's
[40:38] loins,
[40:40] you were with him then, but your father
[40:43] didn't know you then, and you didn't
[40:47] know your father.
[40:49] And when you had to come to be born, God
[40:53] made a way through your mother. for the
[40:57] seed bed. And then it came and then you
[41:01] become a man or a woman, whatever it
[41:03] was. Then you recognized your father and
[41:08] your mother
[41:10] and your father could have fellowship
[41:12] with you.
[41:15] He said, "Now remember, if you've got
[41:18] eternal life, your life was in God in
[41:22] the beginning." He's only used this as
[41:23] an analogy. Your life was in God in the
[41:27] beginning. God is the word.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; And then when the word was made flesh in
[41:36] Christ Jesus.
[41:38] So now we have God Almighty God the
[41:41] Father. We have God the Word. We have
[41:43] God in Christ. But we don't have three
[41:45] gods.
[41:46] [Music]
[41:49] When he was made flesh in Christ Jesus,
[41:52] God coming down to dwell in his own body
[41:56] made himself the son of God. When God
[41:59] came down to dwell in that, you were in
[42:02] him when he was crucified.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; And you were crucified with him.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "I am crucified."
[42:14] He didn't say, "I'm like I'm crucified."
[42:16] He said, "I am crucified with Christ.
[42:20] Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but
[42:23] Christ liveth in me. And you died with
[42:26] him at Calvary. You were buried with him
[42:30] on the mountain, and you rose with him
[42:33] on Easter morning. And now you're
[42:36] sitting together in heavenly places in
[42:38] him. And now you have fellowship with
[42:41] him." Why? Because you've come to a
[42:43] birth. Amen.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; You couldn't have fellowship with your
[42:45] earthly father or mother until you had
[42:48] come into life.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham had made a
[42:53] statement and from that statement I
[42:57] received much inspiration
[42:59] and this was the statement just before I
[43:01] go on. He said you were in the loins of
[43:04] your father. This is in the power of
[43:06] transformation.
[43:08] You were in the loins of your father,
[43:09] but your father could not have
[43:11] fellowship with you until you were
[43:15] transformed
[43:16] into a body of flesh.
[43:20] He said, "My son," referring to his his
[43:23] own son, Billy Paul said, "My son there
[43:27] was in me. I wanted a son, but he was in
[43:31] me then. He was in me then but through
[43:36] wedlock
[43:38] he was transformed
[43:40] into a man like me and then he became
[43:45] like me.
[43:46] My theme is largely going to be on the
[43:50] basis of through wedlock.
[43:55] He was transformed. Through wedlock
[43:58] we are transformed
[44:01] through a human wedlock.
[44:04] We were transformed into a body of
[44:06] flesh. Could have fellowship with our
[44:09] human parents. We look like our human
[44:12] parents and we have fellowship with one
[44:15] another through the miracle of wedlock.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We were transformed through wedlock. We
[44:24] were transformed.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Now maybe you can understand why there's
[44:30] much today there's much emphasis on not
[44:33] having any wedlock
[44:36] &gt;&gt; simply because it's a resistance against
[44:38] the power of transformation. That's
[44:40] right.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be reaching fairly deep so
[44:46] you can be scratching, pinching your
[44:48] conscience.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Transformed
[44:54] through wedlock and he went on in the
[44:57] thirst just as last few comments. God
[45:00] himself became one of us.
[45:03] No man has seen the father at any time
[45:06] says the scripture. the only begotten of
[45:09] the son. The only begotten son of the
[45:11] father. He hath declared him.
[45:14] That's God became man so he could have
[45:17] fellowship with you as a man. And now
[45:22] you are flesh and he's flesh.
[45:25] God is made flesh among us in the person
[45:27] of Jesus Christ. And in him was God. He
[45:33] was God. Nothing short of it. You
[45:35] believe that he was God. God manifested
[45:38] in the son Jesus Christ which made him
[45:41] Emmanuel as the prophet said he would be
[45:46] now through wedlock
[45:49] we were transformed.
[45:51] You were in the loins of your father but
[45:54] you couldn't have fellowship but were
[45:56] transformed
[45:58] transformed
[46:01] through
[46:03] this mystery of wedlock.
[46:07] I want to just digress now for a moment
[46:10] and beginning with our first scripture
[46:13] and this will certainly tie together as
[46:15] we move along.
[46:17] In the beginning,
[46:20] God created the heaven and the earth and
[46:22] the earth was without form and void and
[46:25] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[46:28] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[46:32] face of the waters.
[46:35] The word that is used by God in the
[46:37] Hebrew language
[46:40] for the spirit of God moved. It's only
[46:44] used three times in the scripture.
[46:48] And it's interesting because for you
[46:50] that are acquainted with the message, it
[46:54] will instantly have a great depth of
[46:57] meaning to you. And here are the three
[47:00] times it is used in the scripture.
[47:04] And the spirit of God moved upon the
[47:08] face of the deep. It is used in
[47:11] Deuteronomy 32:11.
[47:13] As an eagle stirth her nest, and
[47:17] flutterth
[47:18] over her young, spreadth abroad her
[47:22] wings, taketh them, and beareth them up
[47:25] on her wings.
[47:27] That's the second time. The third time
[47:30] is in Jeremiah 23. and nine mine heart
[47:35] the prophet said within me is broken
[47:37] because of the prophets all my bones
[47:40] shake and that's the third time
[47:44] moved
[47:46] flutterth and shake it's all the same
[47:49] word and one is God's spirit initially
[47:53] moving for creation upon the earth and
[47:56] the second one is when God is leading
[47:58] his people out and now he says as an
[48:02] eagle will stir their nest and flutterth
[48:04] over her young. And that's why it was
[48:06] such a common phrase in this generation
[48:09] of the prophet of God because it's the
[48:11] same thing that's happening. And then
[48:13] with Jeremiah when this when the nation
[48:16] was in such a state as it was and he
[48:18] said that his his his heart was broken
[48:22] within him and his bones did shake. And
[48:24] I am like a drunken man and like a man
[48:27] whom wine hath overcome because of the
[48:29] Lord and because of the words of his
[48:31] holiness. The word of God had caused him
[48:34] to tremble and shake.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing. God moved over
[48:40] the waters and then life came. Now we
[48:45] have in the beginning the spirit of God
[48:47] moved over the face of the deep. and
[48:50] some of the phrases. I'd like you to
[48:53] notice some of the phrases that I'm
[48:55] going to now choose from the message and
[48:58] you'll see from the word of God how
[49:02] [Music]
[49:03] I'm going to maybe shock you. I God is
[49:07] at where and for the purpose of the
[49:09] service today
[49:11] if you'd bear with me and allow me this
[49:13] allowance of
[49:16] I won't say imagination but to let my my
[49:18] thoughts
[49:20] go a little further than they normally
[49:22] do
[49:24] of all we call this earth mother earth
[49:28] but of all the planets in the galaxies
[49:33] the glories of the heavens and
[49:35] magnitude of God's creation. And man
[49:38] with all of his devices and instruments
[49:41] cannot discover the end of all of this
[49:45] creation, which it seems to ever ever be
[49:47] expanding. And a person's mind runs out
[49:51] of territory. We run out of space when
[49:54] we try to think how isn't it this one
[49:56] little speck of earth in all of this
[50:00] vast universe. How is it that God, it is
[50:04] so blessed? It's got the right kind of
[50:08] temperature and the right amount of
[50:09] sunshine and the right amount of
[50:12] everything and moisture and all of these
[50:14] things. There's only one explanation
[50:17] that is that God chose it and selected
[50:20] it, set it aside and the prophet calls
[50:24] it, it was his womb
[50:26] &gt;&gt; for life.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; This is the womb of God. Amen.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; The womb that God chose
[50:34] &gt;&gt; to deposit life, his seed, and it to go
[50:38] on from there. He chose it and he loves
[50:42] it.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; He loves
[50:47] it. Was as though the earth became a
[50:49] wife to him.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; He loved it. He took it. He embraced it.
[50:56] This is where he's going to deposit his
[50:58] seed.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Is exactly right.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And the Hebrew Bible says that the
[51:06] spirit of God moved gently
[51:11] &gt;&gt; over the face of the waters.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Not some boisterous blustering activity,
[51:17] but he moved gently.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Let's catch what the prophet said. He
[51:22] said the spirit of God brooded. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And then he used the words it couped.
[51:29] It began to coup over the earth. He said
[51:33] like a like a dove coups to its mate.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Now think about that. Now get into my
[51:40] thought. Get into this thought now. And
[51:42] you must be born again. Notice this.
[51:44] Notice the even message. You must be
[51:46] born again. He said the Holy Spirit went
[51:49] forth and brooded over the earth as as
[51:53] he began brooding couping. He was
[51:56] calling couping like the evening dove
[52:00] when she's setting coming to her mate.
[52:03] And as he begin to coup over nothing but
[52:06] bleached desert, a volcanic eruption
[52:11] coming out of the hill there, I see some
[52:14] pot ash begin to move over with some
[52:17] calcium. And I notice then again a
[52:19] strange thing and some moisture
[52:22] petroleum begin to run together. And
[52:25] right from under little rock, a little
[52:27] Easter lily raised up its head. life
[52:31] come on the earth and it screams and it
[52:35] screams come father look at this and the
[52:37] father said over that's very pretty just
[52:41] keep couping
[52:45] and he cooed and the flowers came and
[52:48] the grass came and plant life and trees
[52:52] came and birds flew out of the earth and
[52:56] out of the dust and after a while the
[52:58] animal life came up and he kept kept
[53:00] cooing and man came up and he looked
[53:05] wonderful.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; He kept couping
[53:11] &gt;&gt; God in union with the earth.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; He became one with this selected place
[53:18] and he began to deposit his spoken word
[53:21] seeds there and light came. That's why I
[53:24] said let there be light because it
[53:27] require his seeds require light.
[53:30] And even as he cooed and he said and the
[53:33] first thing maybe pot ash or some
[53:35] chemicals began to come, remember they
[53:39] were the direct consequence of his
[53:42] couping.
[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And one time when he began to speak of
[53:49] these elements of the earth, he said,
[53:50] "What was he doing?" He asked the
[53:52] question. He said, "He was making you."
[53:57] Even before he thought of the lily, he
[54:00] thought of somebody like him.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, he loved fatherhood. And because he
[54:07] loved fatherhood, he loved he chose the
[54:09] earth, selected the earth, and he loved
[54:11] the earth because it was out of there.
[54:13] He was going to bring forth a family. He
[54:16] was going to have a son, and he was
[54:18] going to give that earth as a domain for
[54:20] his son. I'll be god of the universe,
[54:22] and he'll be god of the earth.
[54:27] He had a great scheme, a great plan in
[54:30] his mind. And that is why when the
[54:33] creation was finished and the prophet
[54:35] says that Eve was a byproduct of Adam
[54:38] for she was not in the original creation
[54:40] after he had created the whole creation.
[54:43] Then he goes and takes and and creates a
[54:46] bride for his Adam.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; And what is it? Excuse me, sisters. I'm
[54:55] not seeking to be crass or or or
[54:58] uncouthed today, but he he created a
[55:01] womb for him
[55:04] because he created him created Adam like
[55:07] his like himself. I'm a father. You'll
[55:11] be a father. But I needed a womb for my
[55:14] seed and you have seed because I'm a
[55:16] father. I have seed. You have seed. Now
[55:19] I'll bring a womb for your seed. Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; It was that that became contaminated
[55:25] &gt;&gt; by the great enemy, Satan.
[55:28] [Music]
[55:29] &gt;&gt; And the earth itself, tell me, has this
[55:33] earth not become contaminated?
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Has it not?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; It's filled with contamination. Even the
[55:41] world itself is wondering how to get rid
[55:42] of the pollution. It's been polluted by
[55:45] science and by all of satanic knowledge
[55:48] and all of these things. Say all you
[55:50] want about all our culture and
[55:51] intelligence. It's brought us nothing
[55:53] but death and more death. And the
[55:55] further we go, it's more death. You
[55:58] might as well say amen because it is
[56:00] true.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; And it's there because Satan was cast to
[56:04] the earth.
[56:06] [Music]
[56:08] &gt;&gt; But this is how it came.
[56:11] He moved. He brooded. He cooed as to his
[56:17] mate. And through some divine act of
[56:20] God,
[56:22] God united with the earth and placed his
[56:25] seeds for life in the womb of the earth.
[56:29] The prophet said the earth itself is a
[56:31] womb.
[56:33] And where did God place his seeds? He
[56:35] said where seeds are put in a womb. And
[56:40] the Holy Spirit
[56:43] sent from the presence of God. I'd say
[56:46] to make love over the earth which is
[56:49] giving a setting to my to my message
[56:52] this morning in the message
[56:54] impersonation of Christianity in the
[56:57] beginning the Holy Spirit began to brood
[57:00] over a bleak desert when there was
[57:03] nothing says the Holy Spirit was sent
[57:06] from God not an intellectual but the
[57:10] Holy Spirit was sent from the presence
[57:12] of God to make love over the earth.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Do you receive that?
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And it was, he said, he stretched his
[57:23] big wings around the earth and began to
[57:26] make love. You may wonder why I'm
[57:28] reading. I'll tell you, nobody saw it
[57:30] like that prophet saw it through prophet
[57:32] eyes. And nobody can describe it like he
[57:35] describes it. It's absolute poetry.
[57:39] He said he stretched his big wings,
[57:42] began to make love or to brood and coup
[57:45] over the earth. And he describes much
[57:47] the same. And this came and that came
[57:50] until finally a man stood.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; A son
[57:57] &gt;&gt; of God.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Stood in his own image. No wonder God
[58:03] looked on that. No wonder God I I don't
[58:07] say he was overcome with himself but he
[58:09] looked on it and he said he didn't only
[58:10] say it's good he said this is very good
[58:16] this is very good
[58:19] and the elements coming together
[58:22] as a result of the couping
[58:25] and the Bible says that Adam there was
[58:28] no mate found for him.
[58:34] Now
[58:36] these three separate verses which I read
[58:38] earlier
[58:40] of the spirit of God moving I wanted to
[58:44] impress you with that because the spirit
[58:47] of God at God's own direction and
[58:50] choosing
[58:52] moves at specific times and in a
[58:57] specific way that perhaps we are not
[59:00] completely we may not be completely
[59:03] aware.
[59:04] when it happens, but we see it in the
[59:06] natural creation.
[59:09] And in one of brother Bram's last
[59:11] services and things that are to be, he
[59:14] was saying that sometimes people think
[59:16] that God repeats himself.
[59:19] He said by saying, "Let there be, let
[59:21] there be, let there be, let there be
[59:22] light, let there be this, let the earth
[59:24] bring forth." But he said he's not
[59:26] repeating himself.
[59:28] And he said that at that time when he
[59:32] said let there be light he said there
[59:33] may have been hundreds of years before
[59:37] light ever sprung up or but when he
[59:40] spoke it it has to come to pass. Said
[59:43] those seeds
[59:45] were laying there.
[59:48] These were precious seeds of God were
[59:51] laying there
[59:52] &gt;&gt; beneath those waters. And God needed to
[59:57] speak, let there be light. Might have
[1:00:00] been hundreds of years before light
[1:00:02] sprung, but when he spoke it, it has to
[1:00:04] come to pass. It must be that way. And
[1:00:08] he spoke his word and those seeds were
[1:00:12] beneath the water. And when he dried off
[1:00:15] the earth, then the seeds came up. What
[1:00:19] he says must happen.
[1:00:24] I just want those words. I'm trying to
[1:00:27] be concise this morning.
[1:00:32] Those
[1:00:34] things must happen. What he says must
[1:00:38] happen. And he then he goes directly
[1:00:40] into prophets that speak as he was
[1:00:43] referring to last evening, the evening
[1:00:46] before. And he referred to Isaiah.
[1:00:49] Behold, a virgin shall conceive. Now
[1:00:52] don't don't get in your mind that just a
[1:00:55] man hundreds of years later or thousands
[1:00:57] of years before now a man stands up and
[1:00:59] says a virgin shall conceive. If it is a
[1:01:02] true prophet of God, bear in mind that
[1:01:05] it is it's more seed of God.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; It's seed that's actually coming from a
[1:01:13] prophet's mouth.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. And if it was
[1:01:17] of God, if that was God speaking, that
[1:01:20] must come to pass.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Now, we're speaking about we'll come
[1:01:27] home to where we are in just a little
[1:01:28] while.
[1:01:32] At this juncture,
[1:01:36] I would like you to try to imagine
[1:01:39] and stretch your imaginations to its
[1:01:42] limits
[1:01:43] and try to feel perhaps a little bit of
[1:01:46] what God felt when the fall came
[1:01:52] and the earth as it were was tore away
[1:01:56] from him. The very womb where he had
[1:01:59] placed his seeds,
[1:02:02] the place of life,
[1:02:04] the place of his pleasure, the place of
[1:02:07] his fellowship where he could have
[1:02:09] fellowship no longer. Sin was there.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Murder was there.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hatred was introduced.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Animosity,
[1:02:21] greed, and all things that follow from
[1:02:24] it. And soon there were wars and
[1:02:27] calamities, and the earth couldn't
[1:02:31] handle it, even the elements thereof.
[1:02:33] And there were storms,
[1:02:36] and floods came,
[1:02:38] and there was disaster, and the earth
[1:02:41] was filled with violence.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, can you imagine what
[1:02:47] was in the heart of God? this precious,
[1:02:50] precious place that he had taken to
[1:02:51] himself as it were as a wife, as a place
[1:02:55] that he loved because not for not just
[1:02:58] the earth itself, but for what it was
[1:02:59] going to be and what it was going to do
[1:03:02] and what it was going to bring forth.
[1:03:05] And now it is tore away from him. No
[1:03:08] wonder
[1:03:10] at the greatest act of God upon earth,
[1:03:13] which was nothing less than Jesus Christ
[1:03:16] at the crossroads of humanity, which was
[1:03:19] Calvary.
[1:03:21] That act, my brother, my sister, was not
[1:03:24] only buying back your soul and my soul,
[1:03:28] but he also was dropping his blood on
[1:03:30] the earth to tell his enemy, "I claim
[1:03:34] her back.
[1:03:39] I will restore her.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And she'll bring forth my seeds again.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; But like God had chosen the earth
[1:03:55] and it had fell away from him and now
[1:03:58] must go in his next great plan, plan of
[1:04:02] redemption. He's not only going to
[1:04:05] redeem the earth, he's going to redeem
[1:04:06] man off the earth.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And so he begins his redemption process
[1:04:13] by choosing a man.
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:21] He chooses a man,
[1:04:24] Abram.
[1:04:26] And after a short while,
[1:04:29] he said, "I'm going to change your name.
[1:04:32] going to call you Abraham
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; because you're because he said I have I
[1:04:38] have made you a father of nations
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; not a mother a father
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; now you're going to be like me
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; you're going to be a father of faith
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; you're going to be like me you're going
[1:04:54] to bring forth a household you're going
[1:04:56] to bring forth multitudes cuz I'm going
[1:04:58] to bring forth multitudes and I'm
[1:05:00] meeting you on the basis of the
[1:05:02] fatherhood.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; You're a father. I'm a father.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And out from the loins of Abraham
[1:05:12] came a multitude of people
[1:05:16] and more clearly identified as the
[1:05:19] Hebrews.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; A chosen nation.
[1:05:24] Out of the man came a woman.
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:30] Have I gone too far with you?
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Out of the man's faith,
[1:05:38] when his wife was now, her womb was dead
[1:05:43] and all the life stream in him was dead.
[1:05:46] But his faith was still in good shape.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; And he believed God.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He believed that God was greater than
[1:05:54] the deadness of his wife's womb. greater
[1:05:57] than the death in his own body, greater
[1:06:00] than the age of his own being. He
[1:06:03] believed God against all circumstances.
[1:06:06] And God gave him a son
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; and gave to that son supernaturally a
[1:06:14] wife,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; a womb for his seed.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And out from that came a woman called
[1:06:22] Israel.
[1:06:23] And God once again of all the nations of
[1:06:27] the earth just like the of all the
[1:06:29] planets of the universe he selected one
[1:06:32] of all the nations of the earth he
[1:06:34] picked one
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; and he says to that one like a man
[1:06:38] selecting his wife said you'll be my
[1:06:40] wife
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; and you're going to bear my seed
[1:06:48] and that wife went away from him
[1:06:52] And he speaks through the prophet Hosea.
[1:06:56] Plead
[1:06:57] with your mother.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Plead with her.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Plead with Israel. God speaking through
[1:07:06] the prophet. Plead to your mother.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; For she was his wife. Says through
[1:07:13] Jeremiah, tell her cut off your hair.
[1:07:16] I've put you away in divorcement. And
[1:07:19] then a little further on said, "Can I
[1:07:22] forget my wife? Can I forget her? I
[1:07:25] can't forget her." And he says to Hosea,
[1:07:27] "I'll woo her back. I'll woo her back.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; I'll cue to her."
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; What was it? The spirit of God
[1:07:37] moving again over the face of the earth
[1:07:41] to bring back life out of chaos.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Same pattern.
[1:07:49] Same God
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; doing the same thing
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; he said when man was made in the image
[1:08:02] of God and then God came down in the
[1:08:05] image of man to redeem man that brought
[1:08:08] man and God together.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Look what he Look what he says. Look
[1:08:12] what he says. He's talking about Calvary
[1:08:15] when he's when he's determining he's
[1:08:18] going to bring her back. She's a lost
[1:08:20] world, a lost earth, a lost creation.
[1:08:24] And he says when that blood dropped, he
[1:08:27] and God in the form of Jesus Christ
[1:08:31] crying out on the cross, he says,
[1:08:34] "Heaven and earth hugged and kissed."
[1:08:39] Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; You never heard another preacher say
[1:08:43] that.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You've never heard that before. You've
[1:08:46] never read that in another book. At
[1:08:48] Calvary, heaven and earth hugged and
[1:08:52] kissed. Why? Because it was God's lost
[1:08:55] creation. He was taking it back to
[1:08:58] himself.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; And God could see potentially through
[1:09:03] Jesus Christ, there will be a
[1:09:05] millennium. There will be a new heaven
[1:09:07] and a new earth wherein will dwell
[1:09:09] righteousness.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:18] In a future home he said look them homes
[1:09:21] designed this for his beloved bride.
[1:09:24] Designed it tenderly. Love for the
[1:09:27] bride. He goes on. He says, "The blood
[1:09:30] of God." And then that blood of God that
[1:09:32] was there by that germ when it was shed
[1:09:35] at Calvary dropped back upon the earth
[1:09:37] what for? To redeem the earth. And now
[1:09:41] it's been justified and sanctified,
[1:09:45] called and claimed, and it's to receive
[1:09:48] its baptism of fire and be cleansed for
[1:09:52] Jesus and his bride. I tell you what a
[1:09:55] preparation that is going on even at
[1:09:59] this time.
[1:10:01] And so he chose Israel
[1:10:05] as a
[1:10:06] as his wife.
[1:10:09] In Ezekiel,
[1:10:11] I'm giving you the verses now. Hosea 2:2
[1:10:14] says, "Plead with your mother. Plead for
[1:10:17] she's not my wife, neither am I her
[1:10:20] husband. Let her therefore put away her
[1:10:22] whoredoms and come out of her and out of
[1:10:27] her sight and her adulteries from
[1:10:30] between her breasts. In Ezekiel 20 and
[1:10:33] 36, like as I pleaded with your fathers
[1:10:36] in the wilderness in the land of Egypt,
[1:10:39] so will I plead with you, saith the Lord
[1:10:42] God.
[1:10:44] So we see that now I just want to take
[1:10:47] my time so you can follow. Are you
[1:10:49] following me? So I don't I don't want to
[1:10:51] be speaking here for my own
[1:10:53] satisfaction,
[1:10:55] but this is this has blessed me. But I
[1:10:57] did I did really I was really in a a bit
[1:11:00] of a turmoil just how to bring it to you
[1:11:03] so that I was anxious that the people
[1:11:05] would understand and not misunderstand.
[1:11:08] But but you will need your full focus.
[1:11:14] as God's spirit
[1:11:17] moved over
[1:11:20] this nation that he had chosen, Israel.
[1:11:24] And as he moved,
[1:11:26] there is a pattern in the scripture,
[1:11:30] the spirit of God moved
[1:11:34] and the voice of God spoke
[1:11:38] and life came.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; That is the sequence. Amen.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God moves,
[1:11:47] the voice of God speaks
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; and life comes
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; because it takes the voice of God is the
[1:11:55] seed and the spirit of God must
[1:11:58] germatize and give life to the seed
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; and then life comes.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; So now here's a here is Israel as a
[1:12:07] nation. I don't want to belabor this,
[1:12:10] but if you see it, I'm showing the
[1:12:12] pattern.
[1:12:13] And they walked with God, and they
[1:12:15] walked away from God, and they were true
[1:12:17] as a wife, and they were unfaithful as a
[1:12:20] wife, and they went back and forth and
[1:12:22] back and forth. But the spirit of God
[1:12:25] continued to move upon them
[1:12:28] until
[1:12:29] and and
[1:12:31] by from one prophet to another. The
[1:12:34] scripture says he kept calling to them
[1:12:37] by his prophets. Don't just think that
[1:12:39] there was some man that were walking
[1:12:41] around saying some certain things. I
[1:12:44] want you to see the greater picture.
[1:12:46] this great eternal God. He's a God of
[1:12:49] life.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; And his way of giving seed is by
[1:12:53] speaking. That's his way of doing it.
[1:12:56] And so he had chosen vessels amongst the
[1:12:58] chosen nation. And although the nation
[1:13:01] went away from God, he had selected men
[1:13:04] who would not go away from God. And they
[1:13:07] were men in his hands. And they spoke
[1:13:09] out the word of God. And the word they
[1:13:12] spoke was the eternal seed of God. It
[1:13:15] would never fail. It would never drop to
[1:13:17] the ground. So he raised up a Samuel
[1:13:20] when Eli was failing. He raised up as
[1:13:22] Isaiah and and he raised up an Amos when
[1:13:26] Israel was given over to their
[1:13:27] prosperity
[1:13:29] and to their business. He raised them up
[1:13:31] to call them back to God. And the words
[1:13:33] they spoke was the seed of God. And
[1:13:36] those that believed on that seed brought
[1:13:38] forth his desired life. And so he
[1:13:41] brooded and brooded, shall I say, he
[1:13:43] cooed. and couped over Israel.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Until finally up came
[1:13:51] a little flower
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; and her name was Mary.
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; He thought of her when he first cooed
[1:14:02] and saw the first pash roll out. Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; One day I'll have a little one out of
[1:14:11] the out of the soil of the earth,
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; out of a wayward nation that I took to
[1:14:17] be my wife, and I'll bring a little
[1:14:19] flower up out of the earth. And she'll
[1:14:22] be a virgin to my word,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and she'll have a believing heart.
[1:14:29] And when I speak to her by my angel
[1:14:32] messenger, she will say, "Be it unto me
[1:14:35] according to thy word."
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And I'll unite.
[1:14:44] I'll unite back again with humanity
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; through a child, a daughter of Abraham.
[1:14:52] I chose the earth. It fell away. I chose
[1:14:56] Abraham a father and out of him came a
[1:14:58] woman Israel and she was unfaithful. But
[1:15:02] I kept couping over this dark chaos
[1:15:05] until there came a vessel, a place, a
[1:15:09] womb for my spoken word seed.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; That might get to be too much for you,
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; but I can tell you my brother, my
[1:15:19] sister, that's the truth of God's word.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; And he moved and bruted over her and
[1:15:28] brought forth a man.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And out of the man brought another
[1:15:38] woman.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; The man Christ Jesus.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. A faithful father like Abraham, a
[1:15:50] son like Isaac. Oh, prosperity like
[1:15:54] Joseph. He was all of it.
[1:15:58] And out of him at Calvary was separated
[1:16:02] a woman for him that would eventually be
[1:16:06] called his bride, his wife, his lover,
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; a womb
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; for his seed.
[1:16:26] So that through wedlock
[1:16:31] so that through wedlock there could be a
[1:16:33] transformation
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; from mortal to immortality.
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; And it can happen no other way.
[1:16:44] You cannot come to eternal life unless
[1:16:46] you're united with Jesus Christ in a
[1:16:50] union
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; in a oneness
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; as God's chosen way.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And that's why the scripture said in him
[1:17:00] was life and the life was the light of
[1:17:03] man.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And whosoever believeth in him should
[1:17:07] not perish but have eternal life. Not
[1:17:11] human life, eternal life. And this man
[1:17:14] said, "Who so eateth my flesh and
[1:17:18] drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life."
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Not just human life. We're not talking
[1:17:25] about a better job.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about more education
[1:17:28] now. We're not talking about anything
[1:17:31] that's happening down here.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; We're talking about eternal life. Say,
[1:17:35] "Oh God, my eyes are fixed on eternal
[1:17:38] life. Let this old world pass away. Let
[1:17:42] it pass away. Let it even pass from our
[1:17:45] thinking and pass from our focus.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Eternal life
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; and I will raise him up. I will raise
[1:17:57] him up. This man said, "I will raise him
[1:17:59] up at the last day." And Simon Peter in
[1:18:03] his question to the Lord in the Lord's
[1:18:06] question to him when he said, "Will you
[1:18:08] also go?" He said, "To whom shall we go?
[1:18:11] Thou hast the words of eternal life. He
[1:18:14] realized that was the source. And Jesus
[1:18:17] in John 6 John 10 and28. And I give unto
[1:18:20] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:18:23] perish. Neither shall any man pluck them
[1:18:26] out of my hand as thou has given him
[1:18:28] power over all flesh. John 17 and2 that
[1:18:32] he should give eternal life to as many
[1:18:35] as thou has given him. He shall give
[1:18:38] eternal life to as many as thou hast
[1:18:41] given him. Jesus Christ, the second
[1:18:44] Adam, given a bride, his own bride, and
[1:18:48] that through the union of that marriage
[1:18:50] should bring forth fruit.
[1:18:53] The scripture tells us in Romans, you
[1:18:57] don't need to turn to it, but I'll just
[1:18:58] read it quickly for you.
[1:19:01] Romans 7, wherefore, my brethren, you
[1:19:04] also are become dead to the law by the
[1:19:08] body of Christ, that you should be
[1:19:11] married to another.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; And what's the purpose of the marriage?
[1:19:17] Even to him who is raised from the dead,
[1:19:19] just in case there was any mistake who
[1:19:21] you're being married to, because there
[1:19:23] was only one that raised himself from
[1:19:25] the dead.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; That we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:19:30] God. Amen. A bride. We're married to
[1:19:34] another.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another virgin bride has come on
[1:19:38] the scene. Wherefore, when he cometh
[1:19:40] into the world, he said, "Sacrifice and
[1:19:43] offering thou wouldst not." They slew
[1:19:46] animals by the millions. They had all of
[1:19:49] their blood and the sprinkling, but he
[1:19:52] said, "Offering and sacrifice thou
[1:19:54] wouldst not, but a body hast thou
[1:19:57] prepared me." God brooded over us to
[1:20:01] bring forth a new creation.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:20:07] I want to bring you something that some
[1:20:09] of you may or may not accept.
[1:20:12] I think that you should because I know
[1:20:15] that it's true.
[1:20:20] If you were my age and if you knew
[1:20:23] something
[1:20:24] of what they called the revival of 1948
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:31] and if you knew why it was that uh
[1:20:34] professor David Edwin
[1:20:37] a Herald of Birmingham, Alabama, why he
[1:20:41] wrote his book on all things are
[1:20:44] possible
[1:20:45] being a historian of religion and a
[1:20:48] historian at the University of
[1:20:50] Birmingham, Alabama.
[1:20:52] He recognized just from an overview of
[1:20:55] events in the United States and the
[1:20:58] world that there was a an a nation
[1:21:02] shaking
[1:21:04] and an earthshaking event that took
[1:21:07] place
[1:21:09] and it had changed the face in his words
[1:21:12] changed the face of America.
[1:21:15] this move of this revival they called it
[1:21:19] and had attributed it to a large group
[1:21:23] of men
[1:21:25] didn't know perhaps Oral Roberts who he
[1:21:27] knew well Tommy Osborne Tommy Hicks
[1:21:30] Gardner Oel Jagards WV Grant all of
[1:21:34] these men Gordon Lindseay on and on he
[1:21:36] knew of these associations he knew of
[1:21:38] these men aa Allen and and Shambach and
[1:21:41] all of these people and he wanted to
[1:21:43] know his mind was curious. He's he got
[1:21:47] an investigative mind. Why did this
[1:21:52] happen? How did this happen? And so with
[1:21:55] the human mind, he's trying to find a
[1:21:56] human reason and he may be listening
[1:21:58] today. I don't know. I've met him. We've
[1:22:00] talked to spent a day or two together.
[1:22:02] Spent one day together and have spoken
[1:22:04] on the phone a couple of times. And he
[1:22:06] is moved by what God has what God has
[1:22:08] done amongst th those people that follow
[1:22:10] Brother Brandham's message. He realized
[1:22:12] that it's very very different. And so he
[1:22:15] wrote he was doing his investigation and
[1:22:19] found out that there was a name that
[1:22:21] kept coming up that he found these are
[1:22:23] his words to me. He says, "I found this
[1:22:25] common denominator in the lives of all
[1:22:28] of these great men. And it was a name of
[1:22:30] a man that I had never heard. His name
[1:22:33] was William Brham." So he said, "I set
[1:22:35] my studies aside and decided I must
[1:22:38] investigate and find out who this man
[1:22:41] was." He says, "And when I found when I
[1:22:44] began to discover who he was and what he
[1:22:46] did," he said, "I found out that he was
[1:22:48] the it was all of these men got their
[1:22:54] torches lit from his flame."
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Now, that's just a I'm That's his
[1:23:02] language. I'm going to put it in
[1:23:05] biblical language.
[1:23:08] When there is a darkness,
[1:23:11] gross darkness upon the people, hear me
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; and confusion such as there never been
[1:23:19] on earth and wars,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; world wars for the first time in
[1:23:24] history. and a second world war and
[1:23:28] multitudes of Jews sent to the gas
[1:23:31] chambers when events were shaking their
[1:23:34] entire earth as his very foundations.
[1:23:38] I say then God's spirit began to move
[1:23:43] again over the face of the earth. And it
[1:23:46] wasn't through a group of men. It was
[1:23:48] through a man.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; It was through a spirit. Amen.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; The spirit of Elijah
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; sent into the earth again.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Go my faithful servant
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit began to move in
[1:24:04] that context.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit can move over waters,
[1:24:09] but he can move now over the waters of
[1:24:11] the people. And the Holy Spirit began to
[1:24:13] move over the waters. Not just in some
[1:24:16] blusterous forceful way, but he began to
[1:24:19] coup
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; begin to cool
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; over the people.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Go gently moving over the people gently.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Am I preaching to myself?
[1:24:37] And that's why
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; that's why he came in a gentle man.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Moved gently.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; He followed along in the Hebrew word. He
[1:24:51] followed along in the original in the
[1:24:54] original format. He moved gently
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; over the waters of the people. The
[1:24:59] spirit of God moving gently.
[1:25:02] Amen. Oh, and then came after the moving
[1:25:07] brother butler come the word.
[1:25:09] [Music]
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; First the spirit, then the word,
[1:25:15] and the seed fell to its designated
[1:25:18] bedding ground, the womb of the mind.
[1:25:22] Hallelujah.
[1:25:24] And God brought forth a people. He
[1:25:27] brought forth a bride. He brought forth
[1:25:29] a virgin to his word. created by the
[1:25:33] word of God.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, my sister can't see that.
[1:25:38] You pray that God take the scales from
[1:25:40] your eyes. If you can't see that, you're
[1:25:42] blind and you need sight.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You need it now.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Sight.
[1:25:52] And God
[1:25:54] created himself,
[1:25:57] brought himself
[1:25:59] a woman.
[1:26:02] And he was here
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; as the son of man
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; with an official to conduct the marriage
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; called a prophet of God in invisible
[1:26:16] union and unite the two of them
[1:26:19] together.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I declare you to be husband and wife
[1:26:23] [Music]
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; married to Jesus Christ in the name of
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ. And that's why we took his
[1:26:30] name. That's why we're baptized in his
[1:26:33] name, cuz he's our husband. We're
[1:26:35] married to him.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And what we've been experiencing
[1:26:46] is a wedlock.
[1:26:51] And through wedlock, he said, through
[1:26:54] wedlock,
[1:26:58] I was transformed
[1:27:01] into human life.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; But this wedlock
[1:27:06] is to transform you into immortal life.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; This is a marriage, my brother, my
[1:27:12] sister. We're we're we're in a marriage.
[1:27:15] We're in a union. And it's to transform
[1:27:18] you. This is transforming power. We're
[1:27:21] not having church. We're under the
[1:27:23] opices of transforming power.
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; You can stay in this world if you want.
[1:27:30] If you do have a happy tribulation, if
[1:27:33] there is such a thing, deny this word
[1:27:36] and go to the tribulation. That's all
[1:27:38] there is to it. The truth of God's word.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is transforming power
[1:27:46] we have here today. The transformer
[1:27:48] himself is present. We have his seed in
[1:27:52] us, transforming us into his very image
[1:27:55] and likeness.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; For the two are not two, but they're
[1:27:58] one. They've been made one.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you accept that?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Believe on it.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; You'll enter into it.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; That's what's happened.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with your feelings.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to close with this. I'm
[1:28:16] not going to preach long. I'll close
[1:28:18] with this. The power of transformation
[1:28:21] is in the seed.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; What did the waters have to do about it?
[1:28:28] What did the seed that was under the
[1:28:29] waters have to do about it? What did
[1:28:32] anybody What did What did Mary have to
[1:28:34] do about it? She had nothing to do.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Just said, "As you said, so let it be."
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do. If you can
[1:28:43] get all the works out of your mind, all
[1:28:46] you have said, that's what it will be.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's why he spoke it. Those seeds laid
[1:28:52] there and what God said about those
[1:28:54] seeds is going to happen. The power is
[1:28:57] not in you. It's in the seed.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is be a carrier of
[1:29:03] the seed. I believe it with all my
[1:29:05] heart. I can't see it taking place, but
[1:29:08] what you said shall happen.
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:13] Glory to God.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And it's a pattern of the whole
[1:29:21] scripture. So I will say to you in
[1:29:23] conclusion, the spirit of God has moved
[1:29:27] is moving sovereignly in the earth. God
[1:29:32] has spoken.
[1:29:34] his word out of a prophet's mouth has
[1:29:37] come the seed of almighty God to
[1:29:41] transform a people from human life to
[1:29:44] immortal life.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; That's why he could stand up and say,
[1:29:48] "We now have eternal life."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You won't be eternal. You are eternal.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Believest thou this.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I do too.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I do too. believe it with all that's in
[1:30:03] you.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; And then having done so,
[1:30:11] you have become
[1:30:13] his evidence.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to I'm not going to go
[1:30:18] into it, but I'll tell you what I was
[1:30:21] going to do, and I might yet do it. I
[1:30:24] was going to call different ones from
[1:30:27] the congregation
[1:30:29] to come up here and stand here at a
[1:30:32] microphone and give evidence in this
[1:30:35] court of the world while there's a
[1:30:38] million devils out there.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And unfortunately, they have some people
[1:30:41] agreeing with them saying, "I don't
[1:30:43] believe it. I have doubts. I'm skeptical
[1:30:46] about this." I'd like to bring up those
[1:30:48] that can give evidence
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; not only of what they are, what they
[1:30:53] wear, what they are today. I heard of a
[1:30:56] witness that took place this last week
[1:31:03] and a man went to a certain home
[1:31:07] on a mission
[1:31:09] and that mission was to confront
[1:31:12] family and loved ones
[1:31:15] with this decision.
[1:31:20] And while they spoke, there's always a
[1:31:22] human tendency. Well, I pray or I do
[1:31:25] this or I I believe in God.
[1:31:30] And this brother said, "That's not what
[1:31:32] I'm talking about.
[1:31:34] I'm talking about a life."
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know us, you know me. You
[1:31:40] know my family.
[1:31:42] You know the people in the congregation,
[1:31:44] the church.
[1:31:46] You know Mormons.
[1:31:48] You have a child or a son-in-law that's
[1:31:50] Jehovah's Witness. You know all these
[1:31:53] people. You're acquainted with them. And
[1:31:55] then they call him up on the stand where
[1:31:57] says, "I want you to tell me, have you
[1:32:00] ever met people like this before?"
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; And the father, the man said, we have
[1:32:08] never met people like your people.
[1:32:12] And a woman says, "I even have people
[1:32:15] ask me what makes your son like that."
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, my brother, my sister,
[1:32:21] I'll tell you what it is. It is
[1:32:23] transforming power.
[1:32:25] And it's nothing short of that. It's
[1:32:27] transforming power. And I'm here to tell
[1:32:30] you today by the uncction of the Holy
[1:32:32] Spirit, you have that transforming
[1:32:34] power. One thing you must do, you must

[1:33:16] spirits. Draw, oh God, that hunger
[1:33:20] that's buried there. And let men be men
[1:33:23] and women be women. and no one be
[1:33:25] ashamed to stand up and declare, I
[1:33:28] believe on this Lord Jesus Christ, and I

[1:33:34] my bridegroom
[1:33:37] and my husband for eternity.
[1:33:41] Oh God, is there anybody in this
[1:33:43] congregation that has never received him
[1:33:45] as such, said, "I don't understand it
[1:33:48] completely, but I stand I stand to
[1:33:51] identify myself with a desire. I want to
[1:33:54] be united with him in this glorious
[1:33:57] union of the invisible union of the
[1:33:59] bride and the bridegroom of Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ. If you've not done so, just
[1:34:03] stand to your feet and we're going to
[1:34:05] pray with you. We're going to sing.
[1:34:06] We're going to rejoice. Angels are going
[1:34:08] to rejoice. This is a testimony. This is
[1:34:11] what I believe. I believe it with all
[1:34:14] that's in me. Maybe you're a young
[1:34:16] person. You haven't understood it all,
[1:34:17] but you say, "I haven't haven't received
[1:34:19] what brother Ed is speaking about."
[1:34:21] Don't be ashamed of it. Just stand to
[1:34:23] your feet. Oh God, we don't beg anybody.
[1:34:27] It has to be something that's solidly in
[1:34:29] your own heart. God bless the courage.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; It's not We don't care what mother or
[1:34:36] dad or someone else thinks. Say, "I need

[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Overcoming power.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Transforming power.

[1:34:52] sister, may not have another opportunity
[1:34:54] quite like this one.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; You won't hear another message perhaps
[1:34:57] quite like this, at least from myself.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I feel very exercised, very moved. And
[1:35:03] I'm so thankful when a person just
[1:35:06] recognizes, oh God, I'm not just in
[1:35:08] another service. I'm here to let your
[1:35:11] Holy Spirit that's been coupooing and
[1:35:14] brooding over me and now calling me,
[1:35:17] you're calling me for a purpose. Father,
[1:35:19] these precious lives that are not
[1:35:22] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[1:35:25] not ashamed to stand and say, "I am
[1:35:28] identified with this word. I'm
[1:35:30] identified with what's being preached.
[1:35:33] I'm identified with these people, and I
[1:35:36] will not be ashamed of you, Lord Jesus.
[1:35:38] I stand here to to to ask you to let

[1:35:46] full sway in my life. Move everything
[1:35:49] out.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Let the people of God pray for these
[1:35:53] that are stranded.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:56] Let's just stand and lift up our voices,
[1:35:58] saints. He's the same God. He's the same
[1:36:02] one that was there is here this evening.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; We can worship him and give testimony
[1:36:08] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:36:10] forever. A word that was preached 20
[1:36:12] years ago is applicable to this evening
[1:36:16] service tonight. You can lift up your
[1:36:18] voice. You can lift up your hands. You
[1:36:20] can lift up your heart and say, "Jesus,
[1:36:23] you're reality to me. We love you.
[1:36:26] Overcoming power is what we have today."
[1:36:29] That word is still alive and it's
[1:36:32] burning in my soul. And the spirit of
[1:36:34] God still moves and still couping over a
[1:36:38] people. And we are like Mary, Lord, that
[1:36:40] said, "Let it be unto me according to
[1:36:43] thy word." Spirit of God, move. Move on
[1:36:47] your people. Lord Jesus, we love you. We
[1:36:51] adore you. We give you all the glory. We
[1:36:54] give you all the honor.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; How great, how great, how great is our
[1:37:00] God. How great,
[1:37:04] how great
[1:37:08] is our God.
[1:37:10] Sing with me. How great
[1:37:14] is our God
[1:37:18] see how great
[1:37:22] how great
[1:37:25] is our God
[1:37:29] the splendor of the king.

[1:37:36] king
[1:37:39] and he's clothed in majesty.

[1:40:34] Hallelujah.
[1:40:37] Glory.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wasn't in that meeting. I was
[1:40:43] not in that meeting and I needed that
[1:40:45] meeting. You saw those chairs empty.
[1:40:49] We weren't there.
[1:40:51] But God knew in his great mind I was
[1:40:55] going to hear that word. And that word
[1:40:57] is still alive. It's pregnantated with
[1:41:00] life. And I've got the right womb to
[1:41:04] take on the seed of God to bring forth
[1:41:07] the very life of that seed. And we can
[1:41:11] rejoice as sons and daughters of God. We
[1:41:13] don't have services anymore. We have
[1:41:16] events.
[1:41:17] This is an event. Tonight we worship
[1:41:20] God.
[1:41:22] Hallelujah. We didn't come just to
[1:41:24] church. We came to worship the living
[1:41:27] God that's brooded over a people.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:38] And when I spoke to my mother and said,
[1:41:40] and she said, "Where do you get people
[1:41:42] like that?" I didn't even know Brother
[1:41:44] Ed used that testimony.
[1:41:47] And Joanne leaned to me. She said,
[1:41:49] "That's you he's talking about."
[1:41:53] And when I talked to her, my father
[1:41:56] passed away and that was her second
[1:41:58] husband. And we got into a little bit of
[1:42:01] a a discussion.
[1:42:04] And I told him, "What makes us the way
[1:42:06] we are?" And Elf started to actually say
[1:42:09] something. I said, "Elf, you hold it.
[1:42:12] You don't even believe this."
[1:42:16] You know what he said?
[1:42:20] He said, "I believe you."
[1:42:23] [Music]
[1:42:26] I don't understand what you said, but I
[1:42:27] believe you.
[1:42:30] And I thought, "Oh, God, did he say the
[1:42:33] right thing? Did he say the right
[1:42:36] thing?" He said, "I don't understand
[1:42:38] anything, Tom, but I believe you."
[1:42:43] That's the kind of testimony I want to
[1:42:45] continue to live in.
[1:42:48] because we're energized.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; It's no longer I that live, brother
[1:42:53] Darren, but Christ that lives in me.
[1:42:57] People don't get it. People in masses,
[1:42:59] you saw the people there. Where are they
[1:43:00] today? Where are they today? But there's
[1:43:03] a seed that catches it. And I want you
[1:43:06] to say tonight, I'm that seed. I'm that
[1:43:09] seed and I'm catching the word of God
[1:43:11] and I'm getting carried away.
[1:43:15] I love it. Don't you? Don't you love the
[1:43:17] presence of God?
[1:43:20] And this poor man cried.
[1:43:23] [Music]
[1:43:30] I sought the Lord
[1:43:33] [Music]
[1:43:35] and he answered me

[1:50:07] of God and God put into the church
[1:50:09] apostles, prophets, evangelists,
[1:50:11] pastors, and teachers.
[1:50:14] We thank you for a godly pastor. Lord, a
[1:50:18] man of God, one who has stood true,
[1:50:22] spoke the word of life, and that people
[1:50:25] are standing here because they're a
[1:50:27] product of that word.
[1:50:30] And so tonight, Lord, we want to go
[1:50:32] rejoicing within our hearts that we have
[1:50:35] heard from the throne of grace. And we
[1:50:39] love you tonight and we thank you for
[1:50:41] the word in Jesus precious name.
