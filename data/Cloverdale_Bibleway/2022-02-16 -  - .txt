[Applause] amen let's just stand as we invite brother michael change our positions again here and then let's just sing together all my life you have been faithful i don't tire that chorus and i trust you have it either and it just seems to be seasons where certain songs just seem to be the heart of the people and this seems to be our song for end of last year going into this year i meant all my life you have been so so good amen let's just worship him now as we prepare to receive the word amen we'll start with the first verse i love you lord for your mercy never fails me and all my days i've

adam where art down lord and each one hears a testimony of the saving grace of almighty god you searched us in your goodness reached down your hand it wasn't too short for our situations and the mirey mucky clay we're in of sin and so that's why we can sing with all our hearts and all our voice your goodness is running after me oh god all my life you've been faithful that's why it's an anthem because it's so true and lord we don't tire of telling you how much we love you and adore you and we worship you this sunday morning take the service into your hands lord take full control thank you for the songs and the worship and the specials lord they speak to hearts you heal through it lord maybe you touched a heart through one of the songs they were needing just a word from that line and something broke they're able to break forth into praise because lord of worship we don't tire of the lord give you the service now committed into your hands in jesus christ's name amen amen good morning how are you this morning i'm good i know the sound guys they don't like someone blowing their nose or something while you're speaking that's like a big no-no my apologies amen well we greet you in the name of our lord jesus christ it's kind of weird for me to be here in the morning i have to change all my thinking i say this evening this evening good to see you tonight but this morning kind of weird for me so you bear with me but amen we're good to be here just a little two little announcements uh next week next monday so not tomorrow but the following monday january 31st we're gonna have our uh we'll have the family prayer meeting that we postponed a few weeks ago so just put that on your on your calendar those that can make it that will be january 31st monday and that's eight o'clock and they're coming up in about ooh a month-ish or so a little less than that but andrew glover's coming to speak for winter camp and that's the 18th of february weekend there and so i need you to do your due diligence and click the little link that you got in your email and say yes i'm going to register and do that for me okay bye next sunday better yet by tonight amen there's no service tonight you say well i got service i got an appointment instead of sunday service to go to my computer and register how's that you can take five minutes if you can and do that for us it'll help us as we prepare and get everything ready and if you feel in your heart counselors or in such to be there help in the kitchen we do indeed welcome anybody that would like to be there we're kind of a little bit more uh we've missed a couple years i know there's some that it said you know i'm a little old now a couple years older from the last time we had winter camp well you just give me an email and say but michael can i uh maybe show up somehow i said yeah that's no problem just give me at least a ring i'll be a little bit flexible there in that amen amen well let's turn to our bibles that's what we came here for right didn't turn to john he said that's great mother mike but which book john 17. i want to start at verse 15. this is jesus prayer if we go back into verse earlier in the verses jesus is saying i pray for them that's for you amen he says for i've given unto them the words which thou gavest me they have received them and i have known surely that i come out from thee and jesus is praying in the garden but i want to start at verse 15. he says i pray not that thou should just take them out of the world but the thou should just keep them from evil amen my that should that should do it right there he prayed for you lord keep them from evil you know you could have many people pray you could have a lot of ministers pray a lot but he prayed for you amen that's that's mighty comforting to me lord you prayed for me that i'd be kept from evil they are not of the world even as i am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth amen thy word is truth just hold on to that as thou has sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world amen sanctify them verse 17 through thy truth thy word is truth amen you may have your seats this morning i'm going to read just a couple more scriptures i just want to speak on a little subject this morning psalms 100 and verse 5 says for the lord is good and his mercies is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations for the only sister hope in my it's good to see you god bless you this morning 117 verse 2 says for is merciful kindness is great toward us and the truth of the lord endureth forever amen 145 18 the lord is nigh and to all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth in truth so there's a bit of a caveat there the lord is nigh unto them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth that's pretty vital psalms 119 30 says i have chosen the way of truth thy judgments have i laid before me take a little title maybe this morning it's hard to get a title but i'm gonna speak on the battle for truth and uh because it's something that is definitely on an onslaught in our time and day truth anybody weary this morning you are well the chuckle tells me such [Laughter] you're tired you're a little worn out no you're like ready to go okay all right you made it through another week yeah i did it all right well you're in a battle i hate to break it to you that's why you're tired this morning you've been waging it haven't you yeah in a battle you need about 5 000 calories a day of intake to handle the battle every day that's what a soldier they say you know that's nowadays i don't know how they figured that out of what they required many many moons ago but apparently it's about that plus minus some calories that's probably about two to three times more than you should actually be taking so don't maybe not do that naturally [Laughter] quite unless you plan to wield something much heavier than your pen or the keyboard right but indeed on the front line someone that was fighting i can't even imagine the amount of output they required when they were wielding sword and shield and javelins and such my goodness pick up one of them swords ever and pretty much drop my shoulder on the floor they're heavy all right so they needed some serious input some serious intake right to keep them going and you've expended this week spiritually fighting and then that's why and so i wasn't asking you a trick question you're like yeah but i'm like no i'm wide awake and chipper on sunday morning it wasn't being a trick i was i was expecting someone to be like i'm worn out flat out well yes i understand amen so depending on the intensity but there's some i just looked as we were just looking to start the service and just lay a bit of a tiniest foundation but there's some pretty intense battles over the years you know and some serious casualties that have gone along with them it's incredible i didn't i just all got overwhelmed with even trying to add some numbers on how many people have have gone through wars and combat and and and have output and back in the 13th century or so there was a sacking of baghdad they say there's about two million casualties in that war and then in world war two and one there's different wars the bruzolov in 1916 a general one of the costliest battles 1.6 million there's another battle in world war ii with the battle of niper's d-n-i-e i wasn't saying that right but there was about a 1.5 million and stalingrad and psalm and ichigo and barbarossa oh my goodness just over and over battle upon battle upon battle terrible casualties but i was pondering my goodness how the how the world has waged but nothing nothing nothing compares to the battle for truth and the casualties that have been incurred in this battle my as satan fought so it's normal to be fatigued in the battle you're in quite normal as you're worn out and so then i ask how many spiritual calories did you consume this week that's no trick question either right because if we are waging you've got to input amen you've got to swing god input so i sure hope and praise the lord maybe just if that's all you get i maybe i need to increase my spiritual calorie intake and man we track it well i had this and this this day and how many calories exactly is that oh that's only 40 calories well i can have a lot of those amen you know we don't need a calorie count spiritually it's quite all right to overindulge amen so let's let's do that lord may we over indulge spiritually in your word amen man brother brahms is now it's always been war never joined the church or come into the church to come to a picnic i believe i've read this quote before we must realize we are coming to a battleground i never come for people to pat me on the back so if you came to church for someone to pat you on the back you came for the wrong reason brother branham you're a wonderful person no sir he says i come here with a shield on i need don't need a shield for that as in the padding on the back i come with a helmet and the armor and i came into church this morning i walked down the hallway and what did i see sitting on the table there who was in that sunday school class brother victor who's in your class say the louder for me nines and tens who's in the who's the nines and tens who's in who's about a victor's class what was sitting on the table someone can yell it out to me armor indeed so you might take a little bit from this morning seriously my brother victor was in the channel well amen that's what we believe the lord does amen but abram says so i come with a helmet and the armor i come to fight fight every inch of the ground he says what is it i don't care how much you fight in the material things you're going he goes it won't mean one little thing one thing he says it'll shake but there's one fight that you can get into and gain ground that you've never been taken that can never be taken away from you that's the gospel sound of the trumpet of god's word amen that's the fight we're in this morning the gospel the trumpet sound over trumpet sound brother branham speaks about the trumpets and the scriptures and he said the trumpet sounded it was a it meant war it meant war and he says you notice through the ages there was a trumpet sounded a seal loose he goes that trumpet means war if it don't give a scriptural sound what about it amen so he said when that first trumpet sounded the first seal tore loose paul was the first messenger and we found what did he do he declared war my i thought that was my i i just pondered that for a little bit here paul he made a declaration of war what did he do he says now a declaration war is actually a formal act to declare war you know you can't do this it's just not willy-nilly you know some terrorists they like to think they're doing that but that's just you know that's not a full declaration of war it's a formal act by which a state or country whichever goes to war against another the declaration it's a performative speech act or the signing of a document i think paul performed a performative speech act as he tore through the different cities as he went through the different places and he started to declare war on the enemy amen a war for truth and then he went to mars hill and spoke to the different ones there of the unknown god and he started to declare the gospel of jesus christ that jesus christ has come the messiah and he's raised from the dead and that's what he started to declare that was the beginning of war amen he started to that was the trumpet sounded he went into corinth and he started he still tried he pressed he said he testified to the jews of jesus jesus was christ and they opposed themselves and blasphemed and he shook his raiment says your blood be upon your own heads i am clean and he henceforth he said i will go to the gentiles and so he strove and he strove because it's battle and the lord said to him be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace amen that still applies oh not thy peace so paul knowing the scriptures knowing that jesus was the messiah he started blasting but iran says the synagogues from place to place scriptures and put out every one of them till he finally shook the dust and turned to the gentiles he goes what was it it was the sounding of a trumpet as an angel messenger standing there with the word what did we just read in the beginning thy word is truth there he was standing and blasting the truth amen and then brother branham goes goes and then irenaeus went down and saint martin and different and luther and all of them started blasting the ages he said saint martin blasted his age the fifth messenger luther blasted the catholic church john wesley raised up blasted the anglican church and there was a continual blasting and a trumpet sounding battles on the war was declared back there and we're still fighting it today truth will march on amen and that's what we must do today is continue to fight the battle for truth he said he blasted and he goes now he goes we're looking for a prophet to come to blast this age and turn them back from their iniquity but i'm saying this is is this the sign of the end sir and he goes notice the seven angel was to blast the laodicean rich church i am rich increased with goods i need nothing you're miserable you're wretched you're poor blind and naked as you know the scripture oh god he says send us a fearless prophet my with thus saith the lord that the vindicated word of god will move through it and prove that he's sent from god why how did people sit there in that day and age and not recognize the word of the hour here he's speaking oh god send us a fearless prophet here he was speaking notice now he says the seventh angel will finish all the mysteries that's been lost in the battles before for the truth and so here's something was lost luther raised up he didn't have all the truth he said wesley raised up he didn't have it now watch there's a lot of truth lost out there he says why where others compromised on truth but the seventh angel don't compromise amen compromise to accept standards that are lower lower than is desirable then the seventh angel he says will not compromise he won't on nothing he gathers up the loose ends gathers them up at the sounding of the mystery of god should be finished god sent him all the hidden mysteries was finished when it was revealed to him amen so where are we at today where are we at this moment at this moment at the hidden minute if these are hidden ministries the man brother bram says would be a prophet and in the battle for truth them ends have been lost but god said they'd be restored in this last day amen what a time we living in amen they were they didn't have it all in luther's day they didn't have it all in wesley's day but god sent a prophet uncompromising prophet to speak and bring all those loose ends in that battle for truth and say here it all is all every aspect is back and revealed to the people of this day i will restore saith the lord amen my and in an age of the full unveiling of all truth the full word of god thy word is truth look at the world we live in totally void of truth what is truth oh yeah that rings a bell pilate said that right brother ken you're somewhere here it goes way back long time ago what is truth remember that from a skit truth my goodness more misrepresentations these days more fake news these days or is it fake is it really just them trying to take the true off i mean my goodness you can get real real uh pulled into all these things well facebook pulled that down or twitter pulled you off because no you're not you're not speaking the truth well are you speaking the truth or did they not want the truth out where are we right now they're scrambled well i follow cnn you know i've no no cnn's doesn't god it's the fox fox news got it okay who's got truth well i i curate my own sets of truth and i have my own twitter following that i follow that's my truth okay or my government or my teacher or my prof my friend who has it who has truth these days people are looking for it they're looking for it truth in the old testament when you look at the word comes very frequently as the scripture in deuteronomy says deuteronomy 32 he says he is the rock his work is perfect for his ways art for all his ways our judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he amen it was firm it was stable truth in the old testament was sureness reliability and security it was a continuance of faithfulness a reliableness it was the god of truth something you could be firm and stand on and know that he's just and he's secure and he's faithful that's our god and i can tell you in this world if truth is firm and stable the status of the world clearly shows it lacks it because there's nothing of the sort as far as stability and that's what they're looking for searching for truth oh my john 18 says pilate as i referenced you know pilates had christ standing before him jesus said to him thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause can i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is the truth heareth my voice and pilate said on him what is truth and when he said this now we can remember him asking the question you can conjure in your mind how you think he asked the question was he like what is truth what is truth what is truth how did he say it we we try and imagine what he said but you know what the next part of the verse is when he said this he went out again so he actually wasn't really staying planning to get a response actually he said he said what is truth and then i'm out i'm going back out again it was he wasn't asking in a way that he was looking for a response if he just went out again after that what is truth almost you could say maybe he was cynical i don't know what he was going through and he obviously was was longing for truth but not enough that in front of him was truth and he wasn't even gonna hear a response he was just gonna turn around and headed out the door and i pray tonight anybody that's saying you know i'm searching for truth too don't turn around and walk out the door when truth a living god thy word is truth the word of god jesus christ unveiled before us is truth and he's here to present himself again don't be a pilot and just turn around and head on out my some truth to them is is controlled it's for elite some of them is subjective it's a world of preference and opinion you know even way back some of you might even remember and i was poking into the words what is truth an old song from some old singer that many of you would maybe even know who i will not name but he said yeah he spoke wrote a verse the young man speaking in the square he's trying to tell somebody he cares yeah the ones that are calling wild are going to be leaders in a little while this old world is awakened to a newborn day and i promise that it'll be their way you better help the voice of youth find what is truth they were searching this was in the 70s what is truth the youth then were searching for truth and it's still the cry today cry today has not diminished but i can tell you the din and the sound of war against truth has increased that hasn't waned that hasn't waned he's tried to obstruct satan to obstruct and hinder whatever he can to attempt the defeat of truth amen but i'm going to just tell you a little secret and truth i could just skip to the very end truth will march on hate to break you satan but truth will march on it doesn't matter history has actually already told you through the years and the ages as each messenger in each church has stood the test of time truth never backed down it never was defeated and it will continue to march on so now i'll just close up my notes and say amen well dismissed amen no i want to declare the day john 14 jesus said and if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again and receive unto myself that where i am there ye may be also and whether i go ye know the way and the way you know thomas said oh lord we know not wither thou goest jesus continued to say to him he says i am the way we know the verse truth i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto me under the father but by me amen he is truth i don't really care what the philosophical day day is and all the different aspects that they want to call truth but i'm just going to tell you this morning he is truth christ is truth he's the only thing that is firm and stable and enduring and eternal and you want to put your anchor into it's him sanctify them through thy word as we as we read earlier thy word the word of god is truth and abideth forever first peter 1 23 being born again not of corrupt corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever amen the word of god truth it cannot be broken as another scripture states for it's christ christ and the word are the same and they are truth and they are life amen the truth of christ and the truth of the bible are the very same thing one in the same in the beginning was the word and the word is with god as we know in john 1 in the word became flesh amen truth became flesh define it how you want you can go into all the dictionaries and truth oh it's the real facts it's this it defines that it's in accordance with reality or reality is a true situation that really exists i don't know there's three different theories on really what truth is and there's the concordance theory and there's this area i'm telling you there's only one theory and not even say theory there's one fact jesus christ it's truth he's the only one now in ephesians i'm just going to take a little side step everything is meant to deceive you of truth or to stabilize your path that's what this the our enemy and you know scripture says stand therefore this is number one now in ephesians six which i'm sure our nine and tens probably heard this morning verse 14 or 13 says take the whole armor of god they may be able to withstand the evil day having to done all to stand stand and it says number one having your loins gert about with what with truth amen that's the very first thing paul actually says out of all the armor that you could done he actually tells you get on a belt of truth gird your loins with truth that's number one rightly so because it's christ gird your loins you say well what exactly does that mean well your loins happen to be the belt section of your body and if you want to actually look at back on a soldier when a soldier had to put on his armor he first put on his belt now don't think of my strapping little fancy leatherette belt here it was no fashion statement as an as a soldier well i might get my belt on is it black or blue does it match my pants no it didn't work that way there was no belt that was it'll send little strapling here is it braided or is it solid is that real genuine leather who really cared it was actually a piece of his armor that was pretty thick actually who's ever worked they put that big old lumbar kind of strapping support on anybody ever done that you know a lumbar belt the lumbar support why do you do that well it sounds like because i have a bad back no so you actually have support and that's what the belt was for a soldier it was actually the first part of support of the armor that everything actually worked and affixed to and and attached together and it kind of was that central part of the core of your armor without that your everything would start flapping around your your breastplate would just kind of not be there it it you know you know everything else attached to your sword where are you gonna put your sword anybody attached anything to a belt before without the belt you had nowhere to go it was an important part of your armor the belt of truth or gird your loins with truth is what the scripture says amen why because it was actually it's the core it's the central area if your core isn't christ who works out here okay you might all need to go and start working on your core without strong core you're weak you've got no support your back is going to hurt you're going to have you're not going to have a good aging process a good strong core allows you to walk strong and firm it's core it's core muscles you become flabby and there's nothing there you try and pick up a garbage can you're out because you don't have a good strong core you might need to do plank for a few minutes a day you want to strengthen the core and that's what that was it was the core aspect of your armor which is christ it's your core it's your source of strength if you don't have a strong core in the word of god you're going to be weak against the enemy that's why paul's saying girl up your loins with truth with the word of god with jesus christ because he's going to be your source that everything else connects to amen don't everybody go home and start core exercises i was thinking you know when actually the loins it's actually also it refers to the creative part of a human being and paul is adequately saying gird it up with faith with truth protect that creative aspect that god gave you not naturally spiritually speaking spiritually we as creators man god gave the ability to create but abram says atmosphere we go out and work we create things we create relationships we use our words and we are creating we're creating bonds we're creating an atmosphere around us we're creating he's saying gird up your loins with truth because you want to create an atmosphere with truth with christ as the center gird up your loins with truth you want to create a relationship with truth as the center focus what does the scripture say do not be unequally yoked that's truth that's the word of god gird up your relationships gird up what you are creating in life with truth may it be sheltered and surrounded by the word of god or you're going to deviate [Music] and be weak and defeated amen and so satan has fought against truth the very beginning of time and he's defined to find a tactic which we all know and we'll just we'll go through a little bit and rehearse because he's used the same tactic for thousands of years and so it isn't going to change much so we should probably be very very very adept at recognizing it right it's not like he's changing every day the core of it's the same deception now the serpent was subtle was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yay hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden question i believe that's the first question actually even recorded in scripture the serpent that old devil says as god said you should should not eat and he presents the first dilemma here's his tactic he presents the first dilemma the first attack against truth here he is now saying hmm there's not been a question before just answers to everything but this phrase it created now it created doubt because now he's posed it all right and so now this genomic force has now entered into this world of human life and now god what god had said now he just look at he planted this this seed that wait a second god said this but you know had did he did he say that really was it that how he said it or maybe we should now just question god's judgment on this you know maybe there's something wrong maybe maybe did god really tell you that exactly that way have god said it's a question and he's now suddenly asking eve to make a judgment on what god said well uh yeah let me think about uh you know why would he do that why would he place this restriction on you god said you should eat it not eat of every tree why would he be so narrow why why would he limit you but doesn't god want you to be free why did god say have god said come on this is the tactic of the enemy put it into your world this is where it started isn't god for free will i mean isn't he pro-choice god's for freedom hath god said you should not eat of every tree why why my goodness i mean surely he wants you to feel good and whatever brings you pleasure or joy or satisfaction why is he limiting you to did you know every tree he said not to eat of every tree ow look at how he posed that no god said one it was not every tree but satan was posing it like you know having on god said to eat of every tree of the garden no no that's not actually what he said but here it's like he's making it very big and expensive and so he's skewing it just a little bit just framing it a little it's his tactic saints and this subtle suggestion that god tampers with free our freedoms and he restricts us and he's narrow and he's taking away our rights and and that's what he just wants to feed you so when he fed eve he's fed you the same thing it's an attack on truth and this is how it works just a little question he starts to put in there oh my now he would actually that's unkind of him to do that restricting you maybe that's even that's actually sounds even cruel spinning half god said this and he plants these seeds and thoughts in the mines you know it's almost like wow eve you know hath god said to do this you can't even do that but you know you know i'm for choice and freedom i've got a better way for you you know we can open things up a little more and here it starts that little bit of doubt and question in eve's mind and open the door it just needs to plant that little bit of doubt and let it spiral on because then what it did was the next step was to lay the next part which was actually the lie and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die so she swallowed the doubt she swallowed the quest well yeah and she started to question god's judgment maybe in her mind on well why did he do that why did he say that you start to to question and now put in your own opinion on the matter well you know yeah that is that but you know my way might be a better way or you know that seems a little absurd that's not really in accordance with the culture of our day i mean why would why would we be restricted like that yeah yeah see that won't die and so it is the it's the start of the next part which he then you're able to swallow the lie and which is what happened for god doth know them the day eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods really really what happened is satan serpent said to eve that god's a liar and he didn't tell you the truth is that essentially what he said he won't die god's a liar you're like how did eve get there how did you get from walking with god in the cool of the evening and communing with him with adam and eve and god coming down in the evening and speaking with them him as brother brandon talks about putting them to bed and all of that and how do you get from there to well you know he's a liar because that's what she swallowed he won't die oh okay well he must be lying incredible it's a slippery slope gird up your loin saints with the word of god because that's what she stepped away from and got away from the protection of the word and she should have pointed back and just said with affirmative yeah god did say that and i'm following it every bit that's what should have happened but it's the question it's that little bit of doubt that starts to ring and it plants it in your head and you start to let the nest as butter brown said starts to to build itself out as you start to ponder well yeah maybe that maybe that is a baby off a bit there i don't have a better idea on that or or somebody else's idea is better than that it's just the same trickery it's the same deception and you're falling into the same situation that eve did that turned the whole world upside down beware god's word is not flawed it's not narrow but abram says eve was easily persuaded by satan from the word of god and she leaned on her own understanding because satan projected something to her which wasn't to her real understanding of god but she had something else told her by the enemy satan and she believed it and plunged the human race to death my he says look he goes now says the same as now too many people who rely on their own understanding their dogmas and their creeds and so forth claiming the word of god is not altogether true that some of it is inspired and some of it is not how can you have faith in a bible if part of it is inspired and part of it is not it's either all true or all not don't be picking and choosing there's no picking and choosing on nothing it's either all truth or all false i think it was spurgeon that said i don't have the full quote but he said about discerning he said it's pretty easy and i'm paraphrasing to to uh to discern between right and wrong or true and false or right and right and wrong but it's pretty hard it gets a little it needs a discernment of god to discern between right and almost right right and almost right it's easy to figure out the other ones it was black and white i got that one but what about almost right what about 99 right and one percent wrong figure that one out you need truth you need the word of god that is the only thing that will discern it for the word of god is the discerner of the thoughts and tense of the hearts even dividing unto the soul and the spirit the word of god truth in this day is only coming from this source you need that because it's almost right and right these days that's where it is it is not right and wrong it's almost right it looks about right or maybe i could do that and it's dead wrong actually by the word of god [Applause] god give us uncompromising people not just ministers of the gospel but children of the living god that will say that might look about right but it's wrong by the word of god because that's the belt that i placed on i've girded myself with the truth of god hallelujah i say may god give you eyesight to see the tactics of the enemy that's just feeding in that slivered little tongue of his just to feed into you a little bit um what hath god said when it's get posed that way in your mind just put the flags up yeah that's a little bit kind of an odd statement it should come across like the word of god says this amen it does say that or you're like the word of god says that you're like no one doesn't you're dead wrong it'd be like that but if something's coming across well does it really say that oh that's the serpent i'm just going to say that's the serpent watch how he conveys it well really is it really you know maybe just trim your hair a little bit does it really mean that you can't even just do a little that's the serpent where am i lord help me now he's used this as i said through time satan has crafted it as i think i said in another service unfortunately he has victims about 70 to 90 years of time and so they come they go and but he's crafted over thousands of years so he's got it pretty down and so i'm trying to make you aware of it and so truth though he gets it down to where now you can kind of continually create maybe your own opinion of the word of god and that's where really the devil really wants you is where you come to your own version of truth and that's really what we're living in right now is indeed the truth has become a bit of a relative thing truth is relative i'll explain that maybe for those that maybe don't it's something that's relative if i maybe i made uh i went to go buy a car maybe if i make 10 bucks an hour and uh i wanted to buy a nice fancy car that was about 100 grand well that's just wickedly expensive and probably very very far out of my price range and should probably come much much lower but if i made about 50 million a month you know 100 grand for a car is chump change it's peanuts right i could have about like 50 of them because it's relative to my income okay the value of it's relative to to what i'm doing you say well intelligence can even be relative because you know someone could say well i'm really smart at something and other people maybe are not well you know i could i could be very smart at maybe maybe certain things maybe whatever technology whatever you say i i know that really well but if i stood beside maybe something like bill gates or somebody these high flying tech guys i pretty much look like the dummy right because it's relative right and the same thing bill gates could stand beside my my wife or something that he couldn't cook himself out of a out of a paper bag but my wife she can quite quite well and and so it's relative all right so that's the truth has become that way it's become relative you know i kind of just see god my way uh-huh we all have our own truth oh do you and so now we have lots of you know truth is subjective my culture is true and your culture's true it's all true oh okay and we're all okay all right truth is in the eye of the beholder well that was beauty so someone pulled in truth different strokes for different folks oh right your strokes are just as good as my strokes apparently and you have your beliefs and i have mine and that's just the end of it oh all right or maybe just trust your feelings oh you know whatever makes you feel good go for it that's your truth that's where we're at these days i'm a smart guy i got degrees across the across the window tac-tac-tac i got him up in the wall i got a high iq surely i should kind of know what truth is or maybe i have a high eq and i'm really in in touch with my emotional side and you know i really have sensitivity to different situations and i can sense and i can feel my way through situations because you know i got it my truth it's relative to me not the case saints but abraham says the time has come or you have to stand on god's word stand alone but when the time comes stand there there's got to be a time when you've got to separate yourself between your feelings this is for those that stick close to feelings separate between your feelings and your faith he says that time is tonight he said tonight i'll say this morning that time is right now feelings betray you hate to break it to you they're up today and they're down tomorrow you follow feelings you're following emotions and we're human i get it we go through tough situation we go through a good situation today it's like oh i love this week you have a difficult situation ahead of you i hate this week it's a drain and that's what you follow your feelings and that's your true source that's your center focus dear goodness that's why it's like this and whoo like that and everywhere else because the truth is jesus christ it doesn't really matter what your feelings say what your circumstances say it's the word that's true your word is your anchor jesus never said did you feel it but abram says did you believe it it's by faith not by feeling my he says the devil can beat you around every stump in the country saying it's by your feelings i'm not saying because i feel like i'm saved i'm saved because god's word truth says i'm saved amen you're gonna have a good day and a bad day and you might be up and you might feel pretty down but truth says truth says you're saved amen christ says you're saved who cares how bad you feel i'm saved by his love divine amen i wish i knew the rest of those words of that song amen my goodness truth lord help us make this our absolute brother brahman speaks the message absolute a few times i suggest you listen to it he says my he goes in a quote he goes now he goes but you're afraid your goal by how you feel because you've regarded that you've lived by your feelings that your whole life has been wrapped up in that but you must get away from that and act on god's word amen act on god's word not what you feel not what you see what god said by his word amen we don't truth is not relative this is a bit of a news flash for you truth is not relative it's unshakable reality completely immunized by subjectivity it's not subject to your day subject to how you feel subject to anything in this planet its truth is absolute that's the absolute truth [Music] if you took the idea that truth is relative you know you know i have my own my own anchor post and it's just as good as your anchor posts but they're different and they're both true and i'll have my own idea of how good it is and you just stay off of it and and you know leave me alone and it's okay you can have your own that idea i was like you know if i don't want your anchor i don't want your what if that was how we bungee jumped well you know i'll make my own post an anchor and then i'm going to jump off um you know i'd like to know something that's been tried and tested and true through the dawn through the ages of history that i can oh yeah i'm gonna pull my my bungee cord to that and as i step off the edge and go into mid-air i want to know that that touch point there is gonna hold i don't want your idea i don't want your way of thinking of what truth is and then i'm gonna jump off be like yeah they had a good idea there uh is it stopping am i am i reaching the end no sorry you're free falling right into the pit of hell because you are anchored on someone's thought that's my anchor and when i'm free falling i'm in a difficult situation i want my rope to stretch out and i want to know yeah it's anchored to christ and it's worked down to the ages it worked for paul it worked for martin and look for lou worked for luther and it works for you and i [Applause] believe says then job came to the spot when that absolute held then finally he began to feel the strain tighten up oh he was going through a rough time beyond what we could imagine i'm sure but there came a time when this strain it started to tighten up it had been running loose and bouncing around anybody here bungee jump before i have okay thank you right there's a time when you're like well it's about time where is that going to start tightening up on me it's about now would be a good time as you're looking the coils are all kind of coming down with you and you're hoping is it going to hold yeah you think that you're in life folks you're in life guess what you want to be going through a situation to know that at the end of it like job it's going to start tightening it up and not under it tighten up tighten up and like oh no there's no oh-ho no moment in life and bungee jumping he said the spirit came on him he stood up being a prophet he said i know my redeemer liveth amen he tightened up to his absolute tighten up to your absolute tonight give it a tug tonight say yeah i am connected to it maybe you're standing on the edge maybe you're not in a difficult situation but you know yeah it's right there i'll test it before i jump amen he says i know my redeemer liveth in the last days he stands on earth though after this skin worms destroy yet i'll see god then his absolute anchored amen may you test it to this morning and may your absolute anchor but if it's on nothing something else than this i'll tell you right now don't even test it it's not just find the anchor christ and reattach like sorry my idea is rotten i'm gonna go to christ the whole you do you thing let this be you you know what's good for you you know yeah you do you all right and you do you you do the path of least resistance all the time because nobody wants to go through a tough time but god he knows what you need he knows what you need to go through because he's working you to perfection amen the trial of your faith work with patience and so he puts us through certain things to make us who we ought to be but if you're just like well i'm going to do what i think is right for me well guess what you ain't going to become perfection i need to break it to you because this path of least resistance on our human minds and our human desires and so you you don't work either i'll tell you what else doesn't work all religions end in heaven that don't work neither all pathways lead to christ all pathways lead to heaven christianity is so narrow so limiting they say well there's got to be i'm sorry there's got to be something that's true something has to be true and i love this quote better brown says i believe we're living in the last day i believe that the last day message this is the last message this message of grace that god has given to his church and i believe that at any time christ could come that's why i'm here tonight he says he says to call every side of the world and all that i can do to let the people see that he is the true and living god just wait now and that he is the only door the only religion out of thousands of religions in the world christian religion is the only one that can prove that their founder is still alive hallelujah that's jesus christ amen it's the only religion that can prove he's living and today in you and me and god came on the scene i will get to it to prove and show down that yes i am alive and well living to tell the world i'm the same yesterday today and forever he said nothing to be ashamed of in christianity if this isn't the truth then i'm through with it if this isn't the truth i want it's the biggest error the world's ever had but if it is the truth then i'm willing to die for it [Applause] amen my through time there's been moments of time when opinions have raised themselves up let's remember though again it's been a battle all through the years all through the ages and if we go back in the times of israel god delivered israel out of egypt showed himself mighty then there was a mingling they started mingling with the canaanites and they mingled themselves with the different gods that became options to them somehow and they drifted as did the resolve for truth and as we come in judges we know that it said there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes nothing new under the sun right they did it back then well i got my truth you got yours well look at that it's right in scripture it happened in israel's day think here now after all god did my goodness after all god did before their very eyes that they deemed it was okay to deviate my lord help us deviate worse and worship some other god here they had come back out of egypt all the signs and all the mightiness of god right before their eyes and here the commandments come to them and it says and god spake these words saying i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shalt have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth pretty much encompassed everyone did it not or everywhere thou shalt not bow down thyself nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers unto the children under the third and fourth generation this was spoken to them by a prophet that they said oh no veil your faith it's too much don't have god speak to us it's too dead it's too incredible and then they said you speak moses yeah and he did and this is what they got but then it's like well it became okay somehow they left that straight from a prophet that was lip to ear with god and it's like wow you know we got our own idea of right and wrong sound familiar way back at the beginning sound familiar right today and so this came to a point that it's somewhat climaxed we would say in first kings when ahab who is considered the worst king of all of israel if you do he comes up quite often which because it's scripture and he he did evil in the sight of the lord and it came to pass scripture 31 31 chapter 16 first kings is as if it had been a light thing think about it as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam it became a light thing god help us to never come to that point where it's like a light thing to go and walk in the evil ways oh it should be a not so light it should be a hellfire and brimstone thing to even think about deviating from the truth of god's word and i'll be like well it's okay you know you're going through a tough time you can go do that no it's not a light thing it's a terrible thing you need god and i'm praying for you i know we need to put honey on it sometimes indeed but it's not light and they thought it would they thought it became a light thing to walk in the sins and they reared up an altar for baal and did more to provoke the lord god of israel than and and to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him hence ahab becoming and being stated as one of the worst or the worst and so now out of the blue in the next chapter elijah steps on the scene we know nothing it's just like boom here i am god to his prophet amen you want to think it's a light thing i'm sending my messenger you want to think it's a light thing here comes judgment and he says there'll be no rain or do for the next three and a half years poof gone it's like whoa no wonder they hated him they thought all things are good yeah it's all good lighting you know we're just gonna do what we want to do you know you're you do worship your god i wish you're my god i got my opinion you got your opinion and then god comes says no there's no rain famine's striking your land and then he disappears incredible you know that bale was a god of fertility god has a sense of humor you know why because he actually was called the lord of rain and dew god's like really you think so there's going to be no doer rain that's why they hate him because god put it right in their face said you're not the lord of rain and dew i created the rain i created the dew to feed my land there's no more of it call on bail all you want and then elijah walked out [Applause] amen that's my god well he was an adaptable god too because baal actually kind of went into where zeus actually became and then into jupiter he just kind of you know just he's just whatever the times whatever the times well i don't serve baal you know baal was uh he was actually a word they worsh the worship of him was in sensuality and there was a moral accent done in public in the temple of baal lots of raucous and riotous such and times that they would even sacrifice humans this was baal worship and it just changes the times it just morphed the greeks needed zeus that was the old bale the romans needed jupiter it's the old pale laodicea needs what it needs hollywood it needs this it needs that it's just the old bale well i don't watch them more a lot you know i would never been in the temple of baal all that garbage going on well i don't know what the world you're thinking of but they're watching you more relaxed all the time bail not the device but what's on it right let's just bring it to our times you look back in israel be like man they were so bad well here we are today bales has changed his name and pretty much multiplied to many different areas of of the world and so no rainer do you know he's actually they worship him uh and he's sometimes even depicted as holding a lightning bolt even more aspect that god has a sense of humor as we move forward and so in first kings 18 ahab sent unto the children of israel elijah has now come he's told obadiah i believe it was says go get ahab we're going to have a we're going to have a showdown it's it's game on god is tired of it all now enough's enough and so elijah now gathers all the people up on mount carmel and he says now to the people and elijah came into them and says how long halt ye between two opinions how long you know they weren't atheists it's not that they didn't believe in god at all they knew god was real they knew jehovah was jehovah but there it's like well today it's jehovah and tomorrow it's baal and kind of back and forth maybe i just try and do both you know i'll go to go do this aspect or follow god in this way but i really enjoy this aspect of my life too so you know i'm just kind of torn in the middle and creating my own idea create my own truth and elijah says how long hulky between two opinions sitting in the middle he says that the god lord be god follow him if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word they're like because they were caught that's exactly where they were and he was just coming right down to the pinpoint of it don't go in the middle there's either right and there's wrong so if god be god follow him and if there will be god follow him and then i go you know what halt means to be in a state of uncertainty or doubt between alternate courses like hmm kind of in the middle is this way right or that way and so they halt between their opinions now elijah says i only remain a prophet of the lord but bill's prophets are 450 and so he tells them to go get their bulldogs and shows them tells them what they're going to do and dress it but put no fire under and so they said and if you call on your gods and i'll call in the name of the lord and the god that answer by fire let him be god and the people then said something it's well spoken i said all right how many of them actually sat back there and like bill doesn't have a chance like did they really believe that baal was going to come down hence the god of lightning bolts in his hand and they actually stood back there like it's well spoken elijah of course it was well spoken because they knew i don't even know where these 450 thought they were coming from because i could tell you that god had never never performed once before and somehow they thought yeah fire is going to be created because he's going to send a lightning bolt down that's how absurd our own thoughts are when we connive and come up with our own idea of truth it will never work how long and this is where god how long halti between two opinions mine so the priests of baal they got to work and here elijah my goodness i mean you can't read this scripture but kind of put a half smile on your face you know as they and they said they put their bullocks there oh baal hear us but there was no voice and they leaped upon the altar which was made and they came past noon so they've been doing this for a little while and then elijah mocked them and he says hey cry loud for he's a god he should hear you right or maybe he's talking and he's not paying attention to you he said oh he is talking or he's pursuing he's got some other business so he's pursuing something so you know we call a little louder or he maybe he's on a journey forgot about you forgot the date and you had a really big important time and he's like sorry i got other business to do and left you all crying aloud for with nothing happening per adventure maybe he's asleep he's ratcheting it up in fact he took a nap on you and he doesn't care where's your god my elijah that's what i said you kind of gotta have to have a half smile when you read that part of the scripture i like that about god sometimes he's like i'm just going to prove who i am i'm just going to set the record here for you you you thought you could have this opinion well i'm going to show it to you now and they cried aloud and even cut themselves in matter with knives and lancets and blood gushed out upon them they were getting serious oh yeah they bet they're serious because jezebel was somewhere else and they knew something was going to happen and they worshiped loud and boisterous and with all this emotion you can have a whole lot of emotion you can a whole lot of boisterousness it doesn't mean nothing actually it didn't mean nothing here you need the life source you can have all the emotion you want but make sure it's coming from the source of truth [Music] and so here they are trying to get their altar to have fire rain down from heaven god never vindicates falseness and never vindicate a lie never never and if you're looking for vindication you step off beating path you step off from the word of truth god will never stand behind you ever once and you might think satan might make it all the glamorous and everything's all going good i mean hey for three and a half years these prophets of bill thought everything was going fine but at some point there ain't nobody standing when it really mattered god wasn't standing behind them they had a zippo and so when you deviate from god's word you start stepping off on your own little little ways god isn't behind you not even a little bit and maybe sometimes truth hurts truth can hurt sometimes and you gotta walk yourself back a little bit so i got off the pathway of truth and it can hurt but get back to the right path because at that showdown moment you want god to vindicate you and this is where elijah was and it came to pass midday they prophesied until the offering of the evening sacrifice nothing no answer neither voice and elijah said come near unto me and the people came near you can't tell me they were surprised and they came near and i loved the scripture and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah gets down and starts to build and repair the altar maybe we need to get down and repair the altar of our lives this is a little off i've been way out here and he starts to repair and build the altar that was broken that's where it began right at the beginning right at the foundation place and he took 12 stones numbers of the tribes of the sons of jacob and he builds the altar puts the wood in order as such in the block and the pieces laid them on the wood and then he says fill four barrels of water pour them all over my god ain't taking no chance of butter brandon actually says now to be sure he says there's no faking it god is going to make sure there ain't no fake in this one there's no way they're going to be like well maybe he's stuck in a little torch when we were blinking no no no i'm gonna put on four barrels of water ain't no little flick of a torch gonna even happen you're gonna need some serious fire so put four barrels of water and i've also built that trench which you know he built and filled it up okay all these four barrels of water go down on there do it a second time pity the poor men that are holding the barrels do it a third time they've doused this thing there ain't no way that this thing by man is going to even flicker that's some confidence in truth elijah had confidence in the word of god and that's the same confidence that we can have is when i'm standing on the word of god it doesn't matter douse it with water put whatever you want but there ain't no faking it here my god will answer by fire my goodness 450 priests of bear like oh dear what's going on now and so here they come brother braham says he wanted to show that god was god because why he had thus saith the lord and the water ran about the altar and filled the trench and elijah said he came here and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known this day that thou art god and that i am the sorry thy servant and i have done all these things at thy word hear me o lord you want to be founded on truth hear me o lord if you are off the truth and you scream that out there is no lord that's gonna respond to you but he was on the word of god he was centered and focused and firmly planted on truth and he says hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and thou thou hast turned their heart back again that sounds like a familiar scripture that they'll turn the hearts of the children back to their fathers that i made that you may turn their heart back again who was doing this elijah was doing this then the fire of the lord fell and he consumed the birth sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench hallelujah that's my god it was showdown time this was no okay karaoke six guns god is saying uh-uh i'm gonna lick up the dust i'm gonna consume the stones and even suck up the water [Music] just in case you thought i was faking it i took it all amen you know what happened after that it was a terrible time to be on the other side of the fence it's a terrible time to be on false it was a terrible time to be a priest of baal because you died they pursued them i say saints of god pursue the enemy god may god serve him and if you haven't been serving him serve him this morning and pursue the priest of baal pursue those things and gods that have been pulling you off change your opinion in fact forget the opinion just turn the truth [Applause] kill them little imp devils that are pulling you off of it dear lord help me with time we'll just wind up now i believe this morning it's showdown time but abram says now god sent us some more elijah that will not compromise someone who will preach truth no matter how bad it hurts god's got servants in every community that won't compromise with the things of the world god has servants in each community that won't compromise on the things of the world he said elijah didn't like the modern trend of things so that's scripture we're not of this world nor do we love the things of this world for the love of god would not even be in us then and elijah didn't like the modern trend of things i'm going to type myself and pattern after elijah and so if he didn't like the modern trend of things i'm going to do the same modern trend and where it's going i don't like it he didn't like it and god answered him but with fire and so i need that god amen he said so he stood true to god and the showdown came and the showdown has come again amen jesus said then jesus to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word and you be my disciples he said and ye shall know the truth and the truth christ the word will set you free amen we need a congregation i pray lord that doesn't allow the devil to pull the wool over our eyes we've got the word of god that can set us free i don't care from what maybe say well i'm a believer yes i believe everybody here i pray to god that you're all believers and we're walking on this narrow way with the truth of god in our hearts but sometimes we might be going we have a difficulty maybe there's a little complex maybe there's some little fear or something and that's that the devil's trying to pull that down the truth shall set you free and the truth is christ jesus himself it's the word of god and it's here to free you from even the littlest of things say well i have this little complex here the truth shall set you free lay it down before him say oh god i'm done with that don't let no devil pull his thoughts on me well i could just you could just kind of live with this you know no you've already then now put your own thought in there and that's your own truth it's not the truth shall set you free truth strips satan from death and hell truth sent the word to this day to give us a promise that this body shall be changed truth sent a word that created an expectation in my heart that word put an expectation here sent a prophet to this day so they could build in me i'm ready i'm ready to go i'm gonna be gone in a twinkling of an eye that's what truth is done it's got to come down to a real deal saints i prayed in my little room i said lord it's not just zurich this can't be services just can't be services every week and week out that's not what we've come to i i don't believe it that for even moment in my heart i'm believing the lord it'll move in such a mighty way we come to church and say lord move in this congregation moving the bride around this world moving every church i prayed this morning i said with the fire of god anointing every minister and pastor this morning as they deliver the word of god to their people because we are hungry not just to come to church and sit there and hear a good sermon or whatever but i want to see the move of god start to stir amongst our hearts and it starts to move from person to person to person someone through the speaking of the word they're healed they're delivered that i've dealt with this for so long but it's gone now why because by faith you just take him at his word it's not difficult but satan makes it seem difficult it's just believe i point you back to a prior quote brother branham says he said christianity is the only religion that can prove their founders still alive brother branham in a service as we close he says i feel led to do something he said let's just take the ones that don't have prayer cards he says well and the ones with paragraphs where they can get into he says but we'll just take the ones without he says raise your hands again the ones that sick hasn't got a prayer card oh that's everybody in here we don't have a prayer card he says here's a showdown do you believe i've told you the truth do you believe you have spiritual discernment to know that it is the truth because you don't have to come up here he says now if it comes to healing he said if he was standing right here with this suit on he couldn't heal you because he's already done it he could only prove that he was the christ how would you know it by the fruit and he so he now goes and he goes now what did he do and he starts speaking of how the messiah proved who he was and how he showed peter and john and nathanael and he goes that's what they were it was the closing of their age then he spoke about the samaritans and he goes through the sign of the messiah which the messiah would tell us all things he says i am he and he did not go to the gentiles he said for the gentiles wasn't looking for him so lord we're looking for you amen do you believe he's here he says would you discern it i said lord i gotta bring it down right here do you believe he's here could we discern it he says i want to turn my back to this audience and i'll pray and he said the holy ghost will prove what i said tonight at the closing of this message that the same signs that jesus said would give to sodom would be given to this generations then you discern what spirit is here and eisen said and now you choose who is god this isn't showdown time in elijah's day this isn't showdown time in some prior age this is our day and i don't believe after they had the mount carmel showdown and they went to their homes and they knew clearly who god was who was it baal or was it jehovah they knew exactly who was god and their children knew exactly who was god and their children's children i can tell you knew who was god they didn't need a repeat of elijah to come back up all right let's go have a showdown again and we'll have the altar consumed they knew from that moment god was god and he didn't have to define himself one more time for them it was already a fact from that moment and i say you choose who is god lord let's not stop halting from opinion to your opinion is god god let's serve him and now then he starts to discern he says this little lady over there the light over this woman he just started he just finished explaining how many times over how what how does god define himself how did he show himself who he was he was a sign of the messiah hum over and over and so then now he says the light's over you it's circling above her remember he has his back turned and he says there's now you don't have a chance he says you're praying i just see there's a dark shadow it's death this woman is shadowed to death she's cancer you believe god can heal you i said lord jesus we've got we've got people that have cancer this is showdown time this is a time when god be god i said oh god show yourself again let's take you at your word tonight this morning hey man he says you believe god can heal you it's cancer the breasts and the doctors he's looking at and he starts saying different things he's seen he says oh you're a woman preacher that's dust saith the lord stand on your feet if that's right amen there was an acknowledgment you tell me you proved that what i'm saying is correct so it could be before the whole world one more time if god be god serve him if there'll be baal serve him and he's showing god once again i am god i'm the same one that came down with elijah on mount carmel i'm still alive today christianity those that believe in jesus christ it's the only religion that can point back and say our god is living because he's doing exactly what he said he would do he says can you discern that the same jesus that touched the woman touched his garment not me i don't know the woman oh i see a lady in a vision she's praying she's a young woman there's something about a baby she's had a baby no it's a miscarriage it's a dead baby she's from kentucky her name is martin mrs martin you in the yellow dress you that's true is it lady stand your feet if that's so don't know the woman but god knows her and there she is god knows her she had she had her need of comfort and she's praying and god said i know what you need i'm the same god i'm going to show myself to you i'm going to show myself as i did to the children of israel he says blessed be the name of the lord god look here he says there's a little lady back here with a checkered looking dress on she's got her head bowed she's praying for her father who's got liver trouble you believe that he said lady you're awful kind to her he said the lord he says the lord will heal you sister then you can have it then he goes lady you're awful kind it's sitting next to her because you when the holy spirit moves right to you he says you have a prayer card you don't you don't need one you're praying for a mother are you thinking listen now he says you're praying for a mother sister says yes are you thinking of and you're thinking of bringing her to church tomorrow i said that's right you don't have to do it he says lay your hands on her and call the name of the lord jesus and she'll get well if you believe it if that doesn't apply to every one of us here this morning you have a need in your heart this morning he's saying you're thinking of bringing her to church tomorrow you've got a mother whatever your need is you've got a need he says that's right you don't have to do it because god gave you gave you the authority in his word they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's his word and that applies to you and me not just to this time he says now lay hands on her and call on the name of the lord jesus she'll get well if you believe it said oh god help us believe it this morning he says i challenge your faith i challenge your faith this morning he is the same one saints i pray you reach out this morning you touch the hem of his garment he's here why do you come to church this morning i pray you came to church say lord i have a need in my heart i have somebody that i'm thinking of she was thinking of her mother oh god my mother she needs you reach out and touch it i challenge your faith this morning to either stand raise your hand call out of your heart i don't care what it is but the same god that came with elijah it came with this elijah he's here today i believe it with all my heart there's nothing i say oh god as the man cried out lord i believe helped out my unbelief this morning he says oh god send your angel tonight and give the same discernment he was speaking lord he's speaking the discernment of the lord's body can we discern the moving of the holy ghost can we discern that god is living and breathing amongst us can we discern that he's here to meet our needs he says oh because it's promise of your son let it be so he speaks to another one he says go home and be well saints of god why don't we all stand this morning i pray you put the need on your heart put the need on your heart this morning that's i don't know what else to say i don't want to do it say lord your word is truth and satan is battled and battled but we are standing on the word of god this morning and the same god that proved that he is living can prove one more time this morning but abram says take those hands that you are waving towards god i say lord this morning saints take your hands that you're waving towards god he says lay on somebody next to you i don't care two cents about kovid he says lay your hand on somebody next to you and you'll see the glory of god that's all he can do can you discern the lord's body he says oh god can you discern that his spirit is here the sign shall follow them that believe saints of god there's power if you've got the holy ghost living inside of you there's power to touch the one beside you you put your head you say oh god i pray lord whatever their need is that you would feel them if they need a feeling of the holy ghost you would touch their body i'm expecting this morning i don't come here just thinking well it's another service but i'm expecting a fire of god to move amongst our people it's but it's up to us if we can discern that god is moving amongst us [Music] hallelujah oh god oh that we could press into his his sanctuary this morning saints lordy you came with a need maybe it was buried deep down because satan's been trying to hold you back from the truth of god cry out o son of god have mercy on me brother branham continues to pray he says lord god creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life make satan turn loose every believer in here they got their hands laid on one another they are believers they are having faith in god they believe that you'll do it oh lord your words cannot fail more than you're no more than your promises he says and your promises was if they shall hell hands on the sick they shall recover i continue brother branham's prayer he says now satan you foul demon of oppression that's beaten these people down to the dust i adjourn thee in the name of jesus christ the son of the living god that you turn them loose come out of them in the name of jesus christ oh god i prayed this morning that lord jesus we can pray that prayer the lord we can speak to the devil himself and say lose us jesus christ has set us free i think of jj i think the different ones that have needs brother milko i still stand on the promise of god in another quote brother branham says are you believers are you sons of abraham if you are it wouldn't matter it would be 25 years but you'll believe he said [Music] hallelujah hallelujah lord [Music] oh god move amongst us this morning lord oh that your tender hand could move amongst us so we could reach forth lord we could break through as you sp your prophet spoke before different one little girl that's praying she said i think i got it he said no i'll get down and pray a little more oh and she started to pray lord help us to enter into your cindy in your presence this morning lord oh you say well that's brother branham's day saints you know he doesn't do a sermon brother brown says in another message he says i just don't understand he says why can't you catch it friends he says no matter where there's a vision or not don't you know the same god is the same one who knows all about you no matter the vision or not it's the same word of god he proved it there he can prove it today [Music] hallelujah oh god the same god who [Music] he spoke too many [Music] oh [Music] god [Music]

look back on history i've seen the mighty god unveiled we can read this scripture as we spoke this morning that are the truth but it's not just history it's not just mount carmel it's not just 1960 but it's right here right now he's the same god this morning safe i read again brother branson i just don't understand he said why can't you catch it it don't matter if there's a vision it don't matter he says it's the same one the same god is the same one who knows all about you hallelujah let's walk out of here this morning and say lord i believe it all i believe your word there's not one bit of it when there's some little whisper coming my way no you can't have that that's not for you no your situation's too difficult there's just no way god can deal with that and satan that's just like you did with eve i believe the word of god for his promises yea and amen and they're true there's war on truth satan and i'm standing strong against you hey man let's walk out of here shouldering up the burden of the word of the lord and saying yeah truth shall march on this morning hallelujah amen [Music] you think you could sing that andrew i know where you're at there you are can you sing that with the before with us i want to sing the song jesus is still the answer i know it's a song we might not know but i you i just want to sing the chorus brother and just sing the verses we can sing along with him he can bring them up first verse please he says some men try so hard to prove that god's not really real well others say they don't they don't know for sure how love you cannot feel but i know he's real within my heart amen for one day he cleansed me and made me while i sat on my little seat in my little chair and said you know say you you can't come and tell me my god's not real you can't come and tell me that he's not true how you tell me how my ankle snapped back into place when my daddy prayed for me you tell me if that's not the same god that healed those back in scripture that were lame and halt you tell me who did that my god is still real you tell me satan when i came to the front and i had allergies that shut my eyes up i couldn't even see when they would hit me and they'd be swollen my eyes shut and crying and oh god it was terrible and i said enough is enough and i came to the front and the brothers laid hands on me and by the word of god and before god they left me in a moment that's the same god don't try to tell me ain't true oh my pray that he gives you a result just like that you can anchor in your heart say jesus is still the answer go ahead brother andrew let's sing that together with him now some men try so hard to prove that god's not really real while others say they know for sure his love you cannot feel but i know he's real within my soul for one day he collects and made me whole and jesus is still the answer for that longing deep in your soul [Music] jesus is the answer he's the answer for your soul and though some may say he doesn't fit he's always been and always will [Music] some men pretend that things of this world have brought them in peace of mind but with the dawn of each new day new thrills they try to find but not until they reach the prince of peace can they ever hope to find release because jesus is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] the answer [Music] [Music] and always will be hallelujah jesus is still the answer glory glory i just love that line although some may say he doesn't fit in their philosophy it don't matter what their philosophy is i know that jesus is still my answer hallelujah i pray the lord drop something in your soul this morning we come to church flow god move like fire through us may you drop like you did with elijah consume us lord with the fire of your holy spirit that's the longing of my soul as a song says more of you more of you the song says i've had it all but what i need is more of you let's pray heavenly father gracious heavenly father lord that we could even bow our heads to the creator of heavens and earth lord we love you lord jesus jesus jesus though time and ages roll lord i pray this morning oh god that lord has showed down in the people's hearts lord i would pray that everyone here even lord that already had a result for you we could walk away lord in my heart i raised both my hands lord that stand for truth lord will stand my shoulders back lord the core of my armor belted firmly to my spiritual being for i've gird myself up with the truth of your word for that's you and you alone oh god lord maybe the people your body of believers lord grab a hold of the truth and believe with their hearts lord let it anchor lord you moved in the days of old you'll move again amongst us continue to move lord your prophet said we're look back at what you did there or maybe look what you do for but lord missing what you're doing today lord are not missing the moment not missing your moving amongst us not missing that our hands are gribbly firmly grasping harder to your word for that's all we love all i need is more of you god that's what you're doing right now amongst us lord the winds may blow of time lord there's much uncertainty but there's one thing for certain but your your bride your people your sons and daughters are grasping stronger and standing firmer on the word of god and that alone is the great miracle of this day so i pray you go with your people lord and you and lord just brood over us this day we give it to you the lord's day in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you mind the lord this is his day as we just prayed don't leave if you don't need to if you don't want to i said i just want to stay in your presence and if you need to leave then you leave you say lord come with me now for i'm going to stand with truth and battle for it tomorrow and the day thereafter god bless you lord be with you dismissed in jesus christ [Music] [Music] you
