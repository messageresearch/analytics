It says rather have him in all these things. Amen. And the wonderful truth in our hearts is that we do have him. We can have him this morning. Amen. This is a fulfilled promise this morning. Let's sing the third verse. He's rarer, fairer than the liies, how rare is blue, and he's sweeter than honey from a honey. He is all that I sp [Music] have Jesus and let him be and to be the king Oh, and we My brother Jesus [Music] have your seats. God bless you. going to have prayer in a few moments, but we want to uh speak a few moments about a couple very urgent prayer requests. Uh one is for our brother Esther Paris, brother Derek and sister Debbie and their little one. Uh the little baby David is going to be taken to Philadelphia uh Children's Hospital for pancreatic surgery probably in the next two to three weeks or two to four weeks. And that's what we we understand. Uh you know, I'd like to say the congregation uh God's not uh afraid of doctors. uh and uh a doctor will simply confirm that a healing has taken place. &gt;&gt; That's all uh I know I have I've gone to doctors when I had that real it's almost 14 years now and that herniated disc pressed against my spine and they said I had to rush right in. We'll get you dead bed as quickly as possible. But that that's a time I think that a person wants to do everything right according to the word and uh I try to follow that as closely as possible. So this morning, we're going to pray for the Paris family and for little David as well and pray that God will uh raise him up and whether God does the healing right now by faith, does a miracle or heals through doctors or heals through love, all of those things. What the prophet said, I believe that because nobody had a ministry like just equal that. and uh we can just have that pillar of fire move in over him and it'll be done. &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful for that. We've just seen too many things happen of a supernatural nature. When I was here last service, I spoke, which a week ago, last Wednesday. Uh, and for those of you that try to archive it, you can't archive it because it wasn't recorded and it wasn't streamed for obvious reasons and it's not available. But for those of you that were here, I showed some pictures of some of the people in uh in Switzerland. And one of the pictures uh showed brother Gerard Michel and his wife Angela who we'd stayed with. uh than than myself and another young man, excuse me, that was actually a son-in-law of uh brother George's brother who's a pastor and his name is Brother Jane Jacques uh just day before yesterday now just three weeks ago or less than three weeks ago we were with him and day before yesterday he's a pastor Uh but day before yesterday, he had an appointment at 9:00 in the morning and his wife works for Swiss Air. Uh and so she was gone to the airport uh where she works and that's where we were able to meet her as well. And uh a brother who he had an appointment with at 9:00 in the morning came over to the house and knocked on the door and there was no answer. And so he knocked uh again and was quite persistent but there was no answer from within. He did something that I wouldn't have done and I thought it was very very unusual and I think very few people would do it. You knock the door there's no answer. You think well maybe he had to step out or whatever. He called an ambulance and the ambulance came up and they smashed a window and went in and found him in bed unresponsive and they took him quickly to the emergency. The doctors have since said that a few minutes just a few minutes later and he'd have been gone. Uh they didn't know what it was. They struck they he's been struck down with a type of menenitis and uh uh his heart was racing at 250 beats. Uh his temperature was way up and they didn't know why any of this was happening. So they have now determined there was a menitis. They don't know what type of menitis. I just got an email just before church and they have just walked out of the hospital and they said that uh temperature had come down slightly. His heart had uh had become more normal but he's still in a coma and I'm not too sure but what he's on life support uh system but he's uh I have a picture of him and his wife and I wonder if we could just uh show that at this time. That's brother Gerard. Not brother Gerard. That's brother Jeanh Jacques. Jean Jeanjhac's uh Michel. And he pastors a church just out of Geneva. And this was our first time to be able to meet and be with him. And so we want to I want to ask this congregation if you will just take this burden upon your heart. And we're going to pray for him. going to pray for David and I'm going to ask brother Dia if you'll come please and I want to have the prayer translated because it will be received over there also they'll be streaming the service and they perhaps take it in to him and to his family I've already heard back from the family today when they had just left the hospital I received also from brother Nanda Chedetti request to pray for him brother Gido from Belgium called. These are other pastors who are known known to our brother Jean Jocks and uh I just feel that God wants to raise him up and that's what we're going to be praying for. I wonder if you'd stand with us now and let us say only believe, only believe. John, would you help us please? Only believe. Only believe. And then Lord I believe I believe. We have no one else. We have none like him. You agree with the songwriter? There's none like you, Lord. We have no one else to turn to. All right. Oh, [Music] all things are possible. Holy, [Music] holy, [Music] holy, all things are possible. [Music] Lord I Let's make that declaration. [Music] [Music] Oh, [Music] I need [Music] all things are possible. [Music] Let's bow our heads in prayer. Father, as we approach you, &gt;&gt; so reverently and humbly coming into your presence. &gt;&gt; We're coming on behalf of the needs of the people. &gt;&gt; And many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver them out of them all. The Lord deliverth them out of them all. And we are praying on behalf of our precious pastor, brother Michel. &gt;&gt; You know exactly his condition at this moment. The doctors may not understand. They may not have identified. We know that it is the enemy and as your prophet said, it is the devil. He comes in sweeping in like a roaring lion, &gt;&gt; but he is not a roaring lion. Your line, you're the line that resurre us. &gt;&gt; Your promises are yay and amenise. Amen. to everyone that believeth. We're praying on behalf of our brother Michal bring him out of that sleep of God. &gt;&gt; Bring him out of that coma. Oh God, may even the sound and the words of your messenger sound in his ear and resound in his soul. We pray that healing virtue delivering power will enter into his room, &gt;&gt; enter into his body and that faith, oh God will be in the heart of every one of his family members. Bring glory out of this situation. Those Lord Jesus who need to be spoken to, &gt;&gt; use this oh God. Speak to each member of the family. Speak to the congregation. And I pray, Father God, &gt;&gt; that you will receive glory &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you now for his gift. We thank you, oh God, for what you have done. Bless, I pray, his wife and family. touch each one of them &gt;&gt; with a special touch this morning &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we pray for our little David, baby David. We pray that you will enter the room where he is. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, it would delight us to have you perform the surgery. It would delight us, oh God. It would give us great opportunity once again to praise you. But we praise you anyway, Lord. We praise you for his life. We praise you for a godly father and mother. We praise you, oh God, because every good gift comes from the father of lights. Dear Lord Jesus, this other request we have for a pastor in Brisbane, Australia, we pray, oh father, that your hand will guide the affairs of the congregation in the church and their need. And now for this service today, Lord, take your word, I pray. Take your word. You're the only one that can break it down. You're the only one that understands it. You're the only one that can interpret what's written on the pages. And so we pray, oh God, that you will do this, Lord. Give us the interpretation. We pray by the Holy Spirit. And I ask, oh God, there'll be a great hunger in the hearts of the people as they pull on the word as they are in expectation that anything can happen in your presence. And in your presence, the supernatural is happening. I pray you'll smite the enemy on every hand, oh God. every contrary spirit, Lord. Every everyone that may still be in bondage, may they be loosed. I pray, oh Father, anyone that is not filled with the Holy Spirit, may they be filled. May they come to a real birth, oh God, and walk and live as a son and daughter of God. In the name of Jesus Christ, anoint my lips, Lord, in the ears of the people that hear. I pray you'll anoint this day, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. and our brother that's going to be baptized. I pray, oh God, you'll hover over this baptismal and do something special for him. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ, we dedicate this day to you now for your glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Thanks, brother Dier. It's a good day. &gt;&gt; It's a good day when we're alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. got breath in our lungs and in our body &gt;&gt; to be able to praise him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good to look down into your faces. Victory. Is it victory everywhere? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Well, I want to uh have you turn in your Bibles. We're just going to go to the word now. And uh right after the service, a brother has come down to be baptized. They've driven 6 hours. So I'll see how the service goes. And and if I'm a little bit long, what I might do is uh uh something happened to my sound. Do you hear out there? Now we got it again. All right. There'll be no wires in heaven. Somebody stand and sing that song for me. Uh uh if the if the service carries on a little bit long, what I may do for those of you that may have to slip away, I'll just uh give a prayer to dismiss you if you need to go. Some of those that have driven perhaps a long ways, but our brethren has come 6 hours. As I said, has to go 6 hours back. So we've prepared a baptismal and and brother John Andy's will be baptizing our brother Richmond from Lumbi I believe it is in the Okanogan. Uh I want to take a subject this morning and I'm my scripture reading is very very short. Uh if you wouldn't mind to stand once again and we'll read the scripture. In Isaiah the 61st chapter, we'll read a prophecy of our Lord Jesus. And then we'll be turning to Luke the 4th chapter reading uh a partial fulfillment. And as you're turning the scripture, I'll just say on behalf, I see Sister Sally Dodd looking at me. Sister Sally, Brother Edwin, I I sent testimony of you and your family when you were in a similar situation. I sent that this morning. I said, "A sister who God has raised up." And I will not forget a moment uh brother Edwin as we sat with Sister Sally when she was unconscious and unaware of anything happening and other family members. Sister Sally Jr. was there uh faithfully at your bedside. Uh but I felt I even felt the impact of the faith that was in your heart, Brother Edwin. And and I thought this morning as I was typing that in, praise God, who knows if something like that happened even to inspire faith on this family member. So I sent it to brother uh Jeanjac's brother who we stayed with and they already instantly spread it to the entire family and the family had already received it at the hospital and to me it's a wonderful thing. It wonderful thing we use we use this technology but I'm just happy we can get those we use it for the right purpose &gt;&gt; and we got that testimony out there. So, God bless you, Sister Sally. Brother Edwin, you're here with us as part of the part of the ministry. That's what it's all about. The spirit of the Lord. Isaiah 61 verse one. The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek. He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Then we'll turn to Luke's gospel, the fourth chapter. I'm going to begin reading at the 18th verse. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down, and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. And he began to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. Jesus quoted a half of the second verse of Isaiah 61. Quoted only half of the second verse. And that is why he said, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." The last half, the second half was of course was not fulfilled in the day of vengeance of our God. uh the the content of these scriptures uh that we have just read. If we break it down and I will in just a moment really involve the inner man very much for the exterior but for the inner man to preach the gospel to the poor. Well, the preaching of the gospel we know is not just in word only, but it's in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. But the preaching of the gospel, the purpose of the preaching of the gospel is to reach the soul. It the the purpose of the gospel is to come down that one channel to the soul. Not the five for the body, not the five for the spirit. It is for them. But that's not the purpose of the gospel. The purpose of the gospel is to save the soul, the inner man, to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Those are the six uh the the six items, the six subjects that are involved in the prophecy. And it was partially fulfilled when Jesus, it was prophesied by Isaiah and then partially fulfilled when Jesus took the uh the book and read in the synagogue in chapter 4 of Luke. Now, reference to the brokenhearted only appears twice in the Bible. And the one is Isaiah 61 in the prophecy and that's a prophecy of the coming of the Messiah. And the second time is in Luke 4 which is a partial fulfillment of 61. And both of them speak of the brokenhearted. I want to speak to you this morning on bind up the brokenhearted because you cannot separate that from the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If Jesus Christ if we say that all that was in God was poured into Christ then we have to say that that attribute that attribute of binding up or healing the brokenhearted was in God. that cannot be diminished. And and furthermore, if that attribute was in God and c and that was poured into Christ, it was obviously obvious that those who who Christ would touch would be in need of that. And then thirdly, if all that was in Christ has been poured into the bride of Jesus Christ, for we are his body, we are the oper we are we are we animate the very virtues of Christ. Then that attribute cannot fail but being in the body of Jesus Christ. And if it is to be in the body of Jesus Christ, it's absolutely clear to us that it will also be needed &gt;&gt; whether we realize it. And there may be a lot of reasons why we don't realize it, why perhaps we don't acknowledge it. Perhaps we don't operate or we're not functioning uh in that realm. It might be because we're not aware or there can be other reasons and I intend to speak about some of those this morning. And I'm praying, I have been praying even while I was away these last few days that there would be a dramatic shift in our agenda, in our lives, &gt;&gt; in our in our consecration that uh and I'm just holding myself back now because we live in a very uh selfobsessed generation. We're taken up with ourselves. We're taken up with our little realm. And I'll get into that a wee bit. I don't want to be too negative on that, but yet it needs to come to the surface. And so I want to uh uh bring that to to the surface as well. So now once in Isaiah 61 and once in in Luke's gospel, fourth chapter. But it's interesting to know and to see how and I'm laying I'm taking my time very very carefully because I want to lay this foundation. Well, Isaiah and God knows exactly how the language would unfold because the language is of the people of the world and their understanding of it. In Isaiah 61, he's saying that he hath sent me to bind the brokenhearted. And then when Jesus came, he said that to heal the brokenhearted. And both of those words are critical in one in the prophecy with saying it's to bind the brokenhearted that that has a a a rather a a duplicate uh not a duplicate but a dual meaning in that to bind on the one hand is maybe to bind it up to bandage it or something like that but it is also to restrain it. Healing is really twofold. We've just prayed for some healing. Healing is twofold. One is the attack of the enemy. The attack within the framework of the physical being or the spiritual being or the emotional being. It has to be brought to uh to to seize. It has to be it has to restrain. It has to be stopped. It has to be uh there has to be resistance against what is taking the health away or what is uh what is distressing. Let's say someone sitting here today may be at the end of themselves and and for whatever reason circumstances and all kinds of things coming against it think this whole thing is pulling apart. My I don't think I can handle anymore. Well, the first thing has to happen is whatever's working contrary to that has to come to an end. That's right. &gt;&gt; That has to be seized, taken a hold of, and say the enemy thus far and no further. &gt;&gt; You can advance no further. This sickness is going no further. This fear is going no further. This condemnation is going no further. This this affliction is going to end now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The direction that this life is going is going to be seized upon, going to be restrained because the Holy Spirit's going to take control of the situation and it's not going to continue any longer. &gt;&gt; And that was in the prophecy because that's part of the ministry of the Messiah and that's part of the ministry of the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the second part comes in and to heal the brokenhearted is a put it back together. There's power that's resident. And if you can only realize the power that's resident within the bride body of Jesus Christ to bring healing. Oh, it may not just be lay your hands on somebody or to drop to your knees or to or to utter a prayer in that instant, in that moment, but healing might be over a period of time. Some some people require healing physically over a period of weeks or months or even years, but they improve. They gradually get better and they get better. Well, if that power is within the bride, it might be it might be a healing power and it might call for some instruction at one time, some counsel at one time, some friendship at one time, or fellowship at another time, or the promises of God, or the services or the congregation or the meetings and the anointed word being preached. It might be it might be as as the prophet said, "Bring me a minstrel and play a song." &gt;&gt; Good. All part of it would be all healing. But whatever part it is, it is just healing. It is healing. Sometimes it you're not even conscious that it's happening, but God is using it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now we have the two sides to bind the brokenhearted. And I say that's resident here in amongst the body of Jesus Christ. You possess some part of that attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And to heal the brokenhearted is to make it whole and to cure it and to bring it back to a normal life. To be brokenhearted. I just like to give quite a number of things that uh that it has reference to the brokenhearted and it's a word that you're very you can connect to it very easily in the Greek is cardia which of course where you have cardiac arc arrest and so on but so cardia is the is the word and it's the it's considered to be the center of all physical and spiritual life but now this goes into more detail the center and the seat of spiritual to life to heal the brokenhearted. The soul or the mind as it is the fountain and the seat of all thoughts. I can tell you and I tell you without any shame or without any apology. There's many even sitting right here and many under the sound of my voice need a healing in the mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need there are thoughts that torment. They may be thoughts of the past. They may be fears of the future. They may be some uh family situation and the mind just ponders that, meditates on that, it needs to be healed. &gt;&gt; Am I getting my point across? The mind is a there isn't anybody here that fully understands the mind. I don't think any human understands the mind. They can study it and dissect it and make all kinds of volumes of books on it, but they don't fully understand the mind. But God has a remedy for the mind. My peace give I unto you. Not as the world give it, but I give you peace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Each of these is almost a message within itself. the passions, the desires, the appetites, the affections come to heal them. As I said a few moments ago, this is a very very self centered generation. our society, the way things are, the availability of the good, what they call the good life that sucks us in as it were to the vortex of what I want, what where I want to go, who I want to be with, who I love, who I think I love. uh entering into a marriage. How many marriages fell apart cuz I didn't get what I thought. This isn't what I got married for. My body coming here to church with this on my mind. I see them jogging. They're not in the house of God like you are. &gt;&gt; It's my body. Saw a great big sign. Flea market today. the man. Do you know what? I personally went to a person's place and picked up all of Brother Brandham's tapes. And he is the very man that started the Sunday flea market, listening to all of these tapes, what to do for him. And I thought of all this crowd now in a flea market, a man that once professed, never never did never did have it, never did grasp it as far as I was concerned, but once professed that he believed that God sent a prophet and had all of Brother Brandham's tapes and finally called me and said I could have them. Started the flea market. I saw the sign this morning with this on my mind and I thought, you know what? What are they at the flea market for? For someone else? No, it's me. &gt;&gt; I want to go to the flea market. I want to look and see what I can do. What about my entertainment? The kind of thing that tickles me, the kind of thing that I enjoy, the kind of food that I like. &gt;&gt; Hey, the kind of car I want to drive, the kind of home I want to live in. And then pretty soon you're just sucked into a vortex of self-gratification &gt;&gt; and getting things better, getting things easier and doing things and it's all my me. I want to reverse that today. &gt;&gt; I want to reverse that. And that's what this whole service is about. And you might as well sit back and take your time because I'm going to deliver this message to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. the desires, the appetites, the affections, the purposes, our endeavors, our understanding, the seed of our intelligence, and the will and the character of the soul. All of these can be affected and stirred in either a good way or a bad way. And we're now moving in a direction that'll be stirred in a good way. So he spoke of the wounded. I spoke of the wounded a week ago Wednesday and and I was very very open with you and that's why I didn't want it to go any further. I've spent my life almost my entire life from a young married man to the native Indian people. I thought of brother Brennan in one of the quotes I'm coming to here. He said he he was had been in the ministry just coming up to 31 years. He said when you get older you start thinking back over your life. And I thought of my uh some of the back that's one advantage with getting up at the at my end of the road. You can afford to look back. And I thought of my young wife and three little children in a tiny home in Victoria. But whenever the native Indian people came off the reservation, it was our home that was always open. They slept in our basement. Uh we tended to the, you know, sometimes fleas and bed bugs and so on. After that never changed anything. They always stayed in our home, ate our food. My wife did the cooking. We never thought we're going to do good for somebody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is just a thing to do. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else to do. Or someone is in need or whatever. You can't live to yourself. &gt;&gt; You young couples cannot afford to live to yourself. my home and my little thing and where I'm going and what I'm doing. I can tell you you'll get to the end of the road and there'll be zero reward for that. &gt;&gt; I'm laying it I'm I'm coming to everybody's address. &gt;&gt; And the reason I can come to it is and I'm not ashamed to say I've been there, &gt;&gt; been there, done that. the gospel that we have. Now, this is going to take a few twists and turns. That's why I'm going to go carefully with you. The gospel, which I refer to the message of the hour, has the remedy for the wounded &gt;&gt; and the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; You have the remedy. &gt;&gt; And God help us if we withhold that remedy. We cannot afford to withhold it. We've got to be able to find a way to be to just give it out. Now, uh in the Thotyron church age, Brother Bram says this. He's quoting the scripture, I will put upon you none other burden. The word for burden is the weight or pressure. and the pressure of the dark ages was either bend or be broken. Now, I know you've all heard this quote before, but I want you to hear it again in context with the whole service. And to put emphasis on the fact that it wasn't a preacher that preached it, it was a prophet that spoke it. And he said it was uh in the Inquisition the power of the empire back backing up satanic worship and to be organized or pay with your life. Each age had its pressures. For example, a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches. There's pressure of riches. The world's understanding a wee bit of it now. What they call a meltdown. The only reason they can call it a meltdown is because they thought they had something before it melted down. &gt;&gt; They had what did they have? Stocks and bonds and well, let's face it, riches. &gt;&gt; That's what it was. Riches. Oh, I made so much or my property went up or or it did this and so on. That's riches. That's what it is. And I thought they had it and now it's a bit of a meltdown and everybody's disappointed. Everybody's discouraged and people are in the doldrums and so on. But he said there's pressure with riches. For example, a great burden is the pressure of riches. Secondly, soft living and nervous tensions. I tell you what, brother Brandham covered the whole age in those three statements. riches, soft living, and nervous tensions in a complex age. It's a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in. &gt;&gt; I say amen to that. &gt;&gt; I don't feel fitted to live in it at all. &gt;&gt; I feel as a I feel like a foreigner. &gt;&gt; And like Marilyn's song, I don't feel welcome here anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to feel welcome. I don't want to feel a welcome spirit from the world. You're one of us. No, I'm not one of us. I'm not one of them. I'm one of I'm one of these. &gt;&gt; Called out ones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden. It was to defy Rome, stand up for the word even unto death. All right. So now the gospel is the remedy. So we've come that far. I'd like to have had slide but I didn't have time to prepare all of that. So the gospel for this day is the remedy for the situation for whatever need we might have. Secondly, that gospel is to be preached and it's to be preached not in word only but also in power. I so enjoyed brother Lance your message as you took your burden of your heart and it was certainly a burden of my heart. We don't want to just you know have messages or have sermons. We want to have services where things are taking place, where the word is delivered out to the people and faith comes into your hearts and something happens. &gt;&gt; Something takes place. If you're not saved, you get saved. &gt;&gt; You get convicted. If you're not baptized, you become baptized. Not because somebody says so or somebody pounds you with it, but that you have a conviction within your own heart. If if we don't act exactly right, we don't speak right or we don't have the right relationship between husband and wife, then it becomes right &gt;&gt; by the power of the word. &gt;&gt; Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; The young people, our actions, our desires for whatever kind of uh thing we fill our lives with uh entertainment or how we dress. We should have an inner conviction. Not because someone stands behind the pulpit and preaches a closline doctrine. You should have the closline doctrine in your soul. It's up to you to have it because you know you if you have the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit isn't going to have you run on the streets and be and and be held responsible uh for for as brother Brandham says, you might be pure as a lily, but you stand before God as a prostitute if you dress in a certain way to cause cause people or cause men to look after and lust after you. And so I say modesty is a is a key word with the Holy Spirit. That's what the scripture teaches. Modest and dress. &gt;&gt; Modest in our our actions. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And some somebody comes up with a I won't call it a lame excuse, but it's it's got a heavy limp in it. And that is I don't know how to sew. And that's the only thing they make. Well, you know what? If you need if you want to be an accountant, you know what you do? You go and learn how to do books. If you want to learn to sew, then you learn to go and go and find out somebody to teach you how to sew. We got some wonderful seamstresses here in this place. And and I I think it's just wonderful. Well, and and you say, "Well, I might be on dangerous territory." I don't think it's dangerous at all. &gt;&gt; I raised three girls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't like to see them wearing some overgrown sock. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody says, "I'm getting old. I see so many girls wearing socks." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about skin tight. &gt;&gt; And as far as I'm concerned, that is skin tight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe in and if you want to know what modesty is, we can give you the give you a picture of the lovely young ladies in in the Ukraine and how they were beautifully dressed and modestly dressed. And this congregation ought to be roaring an amen. &gt;&gt; To preach the gospel. All right. Sure enough, I'm going to need my watch out here on the table in the message. Queen of Sheba. Brother Brandon speaks about the commission. The commission was go into all the world and preach the gospel. Preaching the gospel was to demonstrate the power. He said it had to be. What's the next verse say? That these signs shall follow them that believe. He said the manifestation, the demonstration are the works are the works out of the word made positive. Are the works out of the word made positive? That is the manifestation, demonstration. And listen to this now. When the word is preached, signs of the word confirms the word to the true to be true. If it doesn't, it doesn't come from the heart of faith. It doesn't anchor in the heart of faith. Did not Jesus say that some seed some seed uh some swed seeds and when it did it fell by the wayside and the birds gathered it. Some went in stony ground and the riches of the earth choked them out like briars and so forth. And didn't he say some went over and brought forth a hundfold? You must first let the word fall in the right type of faith. And this is I have underlined. And then that faith produces what the word said &gt;&gt; because the word is a seed and the word of God right here is a seed that a swer sws and every seed will produce its kind if it's put in the right atmospheres and the right condition. The seed will produce it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. in a in a message exhortation of healing and the gospel came uh the gospel never came by word only but through the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; And that is what we ought to expect. &gt;&gt; That is what we must expect. &gt;&gt; It does not come in word only but in power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. So he said, "So it's to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives." &gt;&gt; In our lives, uh probably a good number of people here within the sound of my voice, you may well have something that you've struggled with and over a period of years or a period of time, I want to announce to you the power of the spoken word. If it's received, if you say today, I believe that and I believe it's for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That thing you have struggled with will be broken. &gt;&gt; You may have to you may have to battle something tomorrow, but you're on your way to victory. &gt;&gt; It's a it's a spiritual illness that will be conquered by the word &gt;&gt; one step at a time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm looking down and seeing in the faces of people, you're sitting right here and I've seen you come to more glorious victory from being steadfast, being absolutely adamant, this promise is mine. And if regardless of what the battle is, regardless what the struggle is, if this thing is not going to conquer me, by the word of God, by the promises which are yay and amen, by the Holy Ghost that's present, by my yieldedness and giving the word first place in my life, I will conquer this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It shall not impede my spiritual walk. &gt;&gt; It shall not hinder me. It shall not conquer me. It shall not dictate to my life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And by the acting upon your faith in God for divine healing and other things and other things and he calls it redemptive blessings." The redemptive blessings believe belong to us. Then brother Brandham speaks about the healing of the soul. Because now you that have played the tapes and heard the messages and read them over the years, you'll have to agree with me that most of the people perhaps 90ome percent of the people maybe 95 or 98% of the people came before that gift and before that pillar fire and before that prophet for a physical benefit. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; And that really is sad &gt;&gt; because no doubt the biggest percentage of those people also had a spiritual need &gt;&gt; and some came a preacher came says you desire a revival in your church. &gt;&gt; That was wonderful. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for himself it was for his church. Amen. &gt;&gt; So healing of the soul, he says, and not only the healing of the body, but healing of the soul also, which is far more essential than healing of the body. &gt;&gt; We have all kinds of afflictions. I can feel a pain or two as I stand here. That's irrelevant to me right now. I'm interested in the spiritual benefit of the people of our congregations. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the bride of Jesus Christ on a large large scale. &gt;&gt; So healing of the soul and that could be a whole a whole message within itself. He speaks of Isaac that said to Abraham uh behold the fire and the wood but where's the lamb for the burnt offering? Brother Brandon goes on. He says, "Now in the book of Hebrews, Paul speaking in the 11th chapter 40th verse, and God having provided some better thing for us." He says, "Now I wish to take this my thought on God providing healing for this generation." He says, "Being our services are mostly devoted to divine healing." Then he says healing of the soul and healing of the body. Salvation of the soul and salvation is a deliverance but also a welfare and prosperity. I would that you would prosper &gt;&gt; in soul. Your soul prospers. &gt;&gt; That is really what the intent is here. And to be saved, to have salvation is to be liberated, to be victorious. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If I could just make my point here this morning, God does not intend that you should live under some uh uh under some affliction. If if I could believe that God intended we live under physical affliction, I couldn't preach divine healing. I don't believe that it's God's will for us to be afflicted physically, but much more intense is it the will of God that you be free spiritually. &gt;&gt; And it's Satan wants to bind people, bind our faith so it can't be released. God wants to release your faith &gt;&gt; to believe for all things are possible to him or her that believeth. And we're sons and daughters of God. And our heavenly father, he he's not our father to fail us. He's our father to fulfill his word. And he delights in fulfilling it. He wants to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; That's why we praise him and glorify him. And it's to save us from moral troubles. Salvation is uh is not only deliverance, health, preservation. It's all of these things, but it's also to be saved from the molestation of the enemy. &gt;&gt; An enemy is not allowed to molest us. &gt;&gt; He can do all kinds of things. He can roar around and and try to afflict us, but we if we we just want to rise up and say, "I'm going to be part of a congregation. I'm going to contribute to this congregation. I'm going to contribute faith. &gt;&gt; I'm going to contribute to positive word of God. I'm going to contribute the promises by speaking it, by singing about it, by living it. I'm not going to I'm not going to confess a negative aspect. I'm not going to give Satan any credit whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just take a a slight turn here. Stay with me. I want to speak for a few moments on the ministry of Joseph in the Old Testament and the ministry of Boaz. Those two for a specific reason because it ties completely and perfectly into the message today. Both of them have very important similarities. Joseph and Boaz, they both at the climax of their ministry, I call it their ministry, their life, they both were a perfect type of Jesus Christ. Joseph's family became destitute. Joseph's family had a lot of infighting &gt;&gt; and struggle between the brothers &gt;&gt; and pointing a finger of who was to blame for the things that were taking place. &gt;&gt; Both came into a famine. Their family came into a famine. and the family of Naomi and Ruth and IMC and the husbands of the of the girls all came into a famine. We can sit here and I can say some a few words, but it does not even begin to do justice to the years &gt;&gt; of spiritual drought, &gt;&gt; the sorrow, &gt;&gt; the grief, &gt;&gt; the darkness at night, &gt;&gt; being without a husband, and being destitute &gt;&gt; of having as Ruth as Naomi did, going out full and coming back empty, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And of Joseph's family, a a patriarch that was declared by God, you'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; And to think that he's in that destitute condition, how can I say that I'm blessed? Where's the God of my fathers Abraham and Isaac? &gt;&gt; This is not the way it was supposed to be. And they it seemed like everything was in reverse. And Joseph he raised up to a a position in Egypt. But this is what he said. Joseph said to his brethren, "Haste ye and go up to my father." this in the midst of his meetings with them. And say unto him, thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt. Come down unto me and tar not. And thou shalt dwell in a land of Gan, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast. And there I will nourish thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; For yet there are five years of famine, lest thou in thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty. And in the 50th chapter of Genesis, Joseph speaking again, and now therefore fear ye not. He's saying to his brothers, &gt;&gt; I will nourish you and your little ones. and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them. That has been replicated again in the message and the ministry of of the prophet of God in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come to a place the generation that come to a place into utter spiritual poverty. &gt;&gt; And it's evident everywhere. &gt;&gt; Talk about denominations. We haven't got time to talk about them. Talk about Pentecost. We haven't got time to talk about it. They got their programs and all of the things and the schemes and all of their e educated intelligence and and all the all the theology. It's come to nothing. &gt;&gt; It's evident it's come to nothing. It has produced nothing in the people. The people have ended up being in widowhood. &gt;&gt; No seed has been given her. She can't bring forth the son of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Said, "And I will nourish thee." And to nourish is almost like bind. Says uh to seize. In other words, Joseph is saying, "I've come down and I'm going to seize this situation &gt;&gt; because I'm in seizing it. I'm going to bind it. I'm going to restrict it. It will have no more effect upon my elect. I'm going to bring it to an end. &gt;&gt; Are you getting my point? Are you getting the connection? I'm going to cause this to cease now. This is not going to have any more power upon my children, upon my sons, and upon my daughters. &gt;&gt; I am going to nourish them. &gt;&gt; And the second part of that is I'm going to strengthen them. I'm going to loose them. I'm going to do what's necessary for them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to bring it to this service. &gt;&gt; God, bring an end. &gt;&gt; I release myself to you in a full yieldedness. I say no to the enemy. I say no to Satan. I say no to those suggestions that enter into my mind. I'm done with them. And if you will do that this morning, I'm saying to you on the basis of God's word, on the basis of the burden of the word in my heart, that will come to an end. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go up and down. &gt;&gt; You don't have to come through these dark spells anymore. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have it. God has come down in this generation and has seized taken a hold of the situation and say, "It's over. That's not just some excitement in my part. Otherwise, Revelation 10:1 doesn't mean anything. &gt;&gt; He didn't come down just to give us another church or give us another little way to believe. He come down to say this this situation's come to an end. &gt;&gt; And if you're an elect of God, God has seized upon that situation. And it's such a such a myriad of situations, but you know, you know in your heart when it's not from the kingdom of light, &gt;&gt; you know it's a dark cloud. You know it's from the enemy. &gt;&gt; I want you to declare today God has brought a sessation to it. He's seized it. He's restrained it. He said it's done. &gt;&gt; And if you accept that, &gt;&gt; you'll walk out of these doors different than when you walked in. And I'm not studying. These brothers aren't studying and pouring out their heart as the messages I've heard recently. They haven't done that. That's been God to you people. &gt;&gt; Has no right. Has no right to your mind. &gt;&gt; Has no right to your soul. &gt;&gt; And has no right to your body. &gt;&gt; But you have to accept it. And that's what the prophet was saying. If the seed is received in faith, if it's just received on stony ground, the birds are going to have it before you get home. &gt;&gt; If you're in love with riches, if you're in love with your business, if you're in love with your your own life, me me, then the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches will choke it out &gt;&gt; and it will bear no fruit, &gt;&gt; and you'll end up exactly where you have been. Yes. &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I receive it. &gt;&gt; I open up my heart. There's no part of my soul that I reserve." Oh God, have full control. Have full control as of this moment. I receive that as my pastor speaking your word. And I believe it's for this service today. And I'm not here by accident. I'm here by design. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You'll receive it. you'll have it. &gt;&gt; Don't sit in this service and ignore it. Don't sit here and ignore it. It'll be worse. &gt;&gt; But if you say, "I accept it. I receive it on my behalf. I'm prepared to change. I'm prepared to hear the word of God and the Holy Spirit speaking in my soul." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; One thing about his voice is persistent. Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll say the same thing all the time. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to have a big flash of lightning here. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is do business with God. &gt;&gt; Come to a quiet or loud. It doesn't matter to me. But come to a resolve within your soul. This thing is going to change. I've committed it to God. And I'm going to go out of these doors different. And I will not forget what I have heard. I will be quoting that and repeating that day after day after day. &gt;&gt; So the ministry of Joseph, I will nourish thee. I will seize and contain this thing. And second part of that, I will sustain you. It's going to seize and take control of the situation that it can't advance any further. Amen. &gt;&gt; That Satan cannot use that to bring that evil difficulty upon you. One thing about evil, one thing about wrong, one thing about corruption, one thing about darkness, one thing about all of that from the kingdom of of Satan, if you don't take a definite step against it, it will continue to creep in. &gt;&gt; It will continue to take dominance. If you start to feel cool in your spiritual life, if you don't deal with that, you will not get warmer. &gt;&gt; You'll get coldermen. &gt;&gt; If you ignore the voice of God, your spiritual fellowship and walk with God will not become more blessed and wonderful. It'll become less and less. And if you don't really enjoy the service and enjoy the fellowship and enjoy the worship and enjoy the house of God, if you feel a twinge of, you know, just being casual about things, attack that. &gt;&gt; Attack that with a vicious with a vicious attitude. Say, Satan, &gt;&gt; whether I don't feel anything or not, this is not &gt;&gt; going to continue. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. might say, "What kind of advice can you give me, brother Ed?" I I'll give you this advice that David said, he said, "I said to my soul, &gt;&gt; David speaking to his own soul, &gt;&gt; praise ye the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was commanding his own soul. You praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of praise. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Now, do I feel like it?" Has nothing to do with how you feel like it. It's what's right. And what's right is he deserves it. &gt;&gt; He deserves it and you need to give it. &gt;&gt; Take control of the situation. He says, "Therefore, I will nourish you and comfort." He'll take control of the adverse conditions, contain them, and reverse them. &gt;&gt; That's what nourish really has to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Provide provisions, food, and sustenance than you, more than you even need. Is Jehovah Gyra. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joseph had more than his brother and his father and all of their families needed. He had more. &gt;&gt; Boaz had more grain than Ruth and Naomi together and all of their people could ever eat. &gt;&gt; He had more fields. He had more wealth. He had more everything than they could ever possibly need. &gt;&gt; They could ever God has more this morning than you could ever need. &gt;&gt; There's more bread. There's more revelation on this word than you can ever assimilate. You won't live long enough. &gt;&gt; The longer you live, the more you'll realize how little you know. Oh God, &gt;&gt; give me capacity. &gt;&gt; Help me to understand. &gt;&gt; Give me revelation and revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think now returning as Naomi was in her grief and her stricken condition and she said, "Call me not Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty." Why then call me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me. So that was her wounded situation. She had no knowledge that Boaz was going. Now watch, please you that are spiritual and know the message. This also the lives of Jo Joseph and his brethren and his father were playing out a prophecy. The lives of Naomi and Ruth and Boaz were living out a prophecy. And that prophecy had a fulfillment in our time &gt;&gt; because as Boaz came to the field to do the redemptive work, so did the son of man in Revelation five and in Revelation. In Revelation five, he stood up and took the book. That was his action there. Boaz's action was coming to the field which was descending to the world. Also in Revelation 10, the mighty angel which was none other. We say it was Boaz or Joseph or the mighty angel or the lamb that stood up. It's all synonymous. &gt;&gt; It's all the same. All the same person. &gt;&gt; And a mighty angel descending and the prophet saying it's clear. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; He's coming to the earth in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's coming to a maiden, &gt;&gt; a gentile maiden. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here we are &gt;&gt; and you are part of that &gt;&gt; gentile maiden &gt;&gt; coming to take her as a bride. All reapers were in the field. All kinds of people working in the gospel. But he had his eye only on one. And he says to the servant singular who was over all the harvest which is none other than the prophet messenger this day. And he said to him, "Who is this maiden?" &gt;&gt; And he says, "This is the gentile. This is the Moabitetish girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is here. And from that time on, the the servant the servant passes off the scene. You never hear of him again. &gt;&gt; And all you hear of is Boaz and Ruth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now she becomes his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. So Boaz took Ruth, and he was and she was his wife. And when he went in unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son. She had had a husband, but had no conception. And the w and the women the woman said unto Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord." Now the women are speaking to Naomi. Blessed be the Lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman. Now they're speaking to Naomi. And his name may be famous in Israel. And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life. Number one, and a nourisher of thine old age. For the daughter-in-law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him. So, she's speaking now. They're speaking of the child that will be born of Ruth and he shall be they're referring to Boaz of course because both you can't separate either one of them because here's Boaz as a man in a husband form and his seed is in her in a child form. Oed who will bear begget Jesse who begat David. So the very tribe the very lion of the tribe of Judah &gt;&gt; is coming forth &gt;&gt; from the womb &gt;&gt; of Ruth. And so when they say he will be a nourisher that that which is born of Ruth, they're not making any separation because she goes on to say, "And he shall be unto thee." says, "And the women said to Naomi, blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, the kinsman being Boaz, that his name may be famous in Israel. And he shall be unto thee a ner a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age. For thy daughter-in-law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him. Well, the daughter-in-law, Ruth, did not bear the kinsman, but she bore the kinsman's son. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; It said, "And he will nourish you and he will restore you." Now you cannot it's synonymous the kinsman or the kinsman's seed which brought forth. &gt;&gt; We can say I could put it this way the kinsman Boaz the person was a restorer of life &gt;&gt; to to Naomi &gt;&gt; and a nourisher in her old age. But that which came from him which which was Oed Jesse and David and Matthew 1:1 Jesus Christ the son of David that's him &gt;&gt; who was a nourisher in Joseph's time &gt;&gt; and was a nourisher in Boaz in Ruth and Naomi's time and is a nourisher and a b a restorer in your time. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the same one. &gt;&gt; And the beautiful thing is he's a restorer. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Restorer. That is to turn back or to give back. Do you know when the last time that word is used in the Old Testament? Malachi 4 and six. He shall turn back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll be a restorer unto you. &gt;&gt; You believe the prophecy of Malachi. &gt;&gt; You believe it with all your heart. &gt;&gt; That prophecy came to fulfillment in your life. &gt;&gt; It's effective today. &gt;&gt; Receive it. &gt;&gt; Receive it. It's effective this moment. &gt;&gt; Without limit, &gt;&gt; without restraint. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All things are possible to them that believe. If you sit here in the service and just sit for a sermon, you're losing the whole thing. But if you sit here and say, "I receive that. &gt;&gt; I receive that from the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; You'll receive the benefit of it." You'll go out those two wooden doors or these other two different than when you came in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What would you ask of him? Ask it and receive it. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. I want to see the services break loose &gt;&gt; because of what's happening in the seat. &gt;&gt; I want to see people delivered as they listen to the word. &gt;&gt; That word is none other than Jesus Christ. I'm here in need. I look to him. He's the solution. &gt;&gt; This gospel is the remedy. &gt;&gt; This message is the remedy. &gt;&gt; Receive it. &gt;&gt; And it's your portion. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the situation is. You know, it's not it's not something from God. Then be free from it. &gt;&gt; Be loosed from it. &gt;&gt; Don't live with it any longer. &gt;&gt; Boaz is here. &gt;&gt; Joseph's God is here. William Brandham's God is here. &gt;&gt; Elijah's God is here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I want to hear your testimony. I want to receive that email. I want to receive that card. I want to hear what God is doing in your life. You're going to share it with some others. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said to people, "Come, come. Why don't you come and see the supernatural and it'll increase faith in your heart?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has empowered you now. It's not just for you to receive, but it's for you to give. &gt;&gt; God has empowered you and left you because it is this it is this Christ &gt;&gt; that is the nourisher. &gt;&gt; And the restorer &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's an essential quality of Christ. &gt;&gt; You can never separate it. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a great threat. &gt;&gt; There's a threat to us stepping forward and fulfilling this commission. See, I believe this church fact is I have good evidence. I have an abundant evidence. This congregation and this church has been raised up by God to bind up the brokenhearted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's been a part of my life from the very beginning. And I personally have a nature. If I even come to a a a fellowship, my family can tell you, especially my wife. Sometimes I come into a room where there's been invited and we're having a wonderful time and all the rest of it and I'm not being able to enter in. I can't enter into the wonderful time like other people perhaps are and they're, you know, jovial and and laughing and so on. And I do too, but I'm scanning the whole group that's there to see if someone's sitting off by themselves and nobody's talking to them. I go overseas even on his last trips and there was 27 people having a big dinner with the people in Switzerland afternoon and oh it was such a wonderful time people haven't been together for a long time and they were just but while we had a little service in a little church I identified one young lady happened to be the brother who you saw in the picture I didn't know who she was The brother who you saw who's laying right now in the hospital is his daughter-in-law married to his son. I did not know that. But I could see she was distant. I could see that she was not feeling a part of this kind of gathering, this meeting. And then all the family and other friends and so on end up for dinner. I didn't have the same kind of enjoyment from the gathering and the dinner and so on because my mind was on this young woman. Don't know who she is. Don't know anything about her. You know what that is? It's the spirit of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's essential part of him wanting to step in. Can I say something that will bring that will begin to bind and take control of the situation that's driving her separating her from the household of faith my mind and at the very end of the day at the very end everybody's leaving I took her hand to shake her hand and I took it and she began to tell me that she really didn't feel. She said, "I feel very hard." I said, "Well, maybe maybe you're like the woman at the well. You've actually he's actually near you, but you don't know it." And she began to soften right away. And I was just able to speak. You know what that is? Healing ministry. &gt;&gt; You, that's not my ministry. You have that healing ministry. All that Christ was, he's poured into the bride. Maybe you haven't practiced it. Maybe you haven't been sensitive to it. I want to change that today. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to go out of here saying on the basis of the message that was preached, I have and am part of a healing ministry &gt;&gt; and I have a power resident within me to heal &gt;&gt; the souls and the lives because it's Christ in me. It might just be a word I say. It might just be a phone call. might be I'm not going to speak negative things. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to glorify Satan by pointing out things that he may be doing in somebody's life. I ignore that and I will be I will glory God in the things that he's doing and I will contribute to that by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just another few moments and I'm going to close. There's a number I'll just say very very quickly because I don't want to major on this but you know there's a number of things if I can just relate for a moment from and draw a comparison because from the physical to the spiritual do you know there's people that are physically sick but don't know it &gt;&gt; you've been there You weren't well, but you didn't really know it. Something was going on in your life, in your body, but you didn't know it. But actually, you were not well. &gt;&gt; That's number one. Spiritually, it's also that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fact is, you can have something going sideways, if you understand me. You can have something going very, very wrong physically in you, and you're still out there having a great old time. and enjoying life and all the rest. You don't realize it that you might be just days or weeks away from something that's going to attack you and you don't realize it. There's people spiritually that way. Everything's fine. But if they if they had an examination, you might say, "Well, how can I have an examination?" I'm giving you one today. &gt;&gt; We're having an examination. And while the word is preached, I want you to listen real real close &gt;&gt; and see if something is just monitoring inside by the word. And we have an examination because we have the physician here. &gt;&gt; We've got him here. He's ready to fix things. I closed a week ago, Wednesday. I said, "How many came here wounded?" You don't have to raise your hands, but you can. And I know a lot of people looked around and without any shame, many raised their hands. And I happen to know because as a pastor, I'm well aware. And I can even tell you that when wounded come in, the only thing that a wounded person has is their current memory. And if they've gone through a very very terrible time or a very tearing time or a shattering in their life or shattering in their home or their family, at that moment when they come in, that's all they have in their memory. So I I I just speak with them and and uh let them relate it again and speak about it again. They speak about their hurt, they speak about their wounds, they speak about their grief, speak about their sorrow. And I have learned that as time goes on, then good things, well, they come into the house of God. They enjoy the word and the fellowship and it feeds them and they get strong and they had a wonderful time of maybe fellowship with a family or other saints. And then I realized that now that that time that they've had that becomes in their current memory. And as time goes on, all of that hurt and wounding, it starts to eb away. And a whole wonderful, glorious walk with God becomes their current life. &gt;&gt; And after a period of time, and sometimes it's been up to three years, and then later at some point in time, this is all distant, distant memory. And what do you say, brother Ed? I say they've been healed. They've been healed. &gt;&gt; So wonderful. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about something way off in it. They're here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Some are sitting beside you. They've been healed. I'm talking about shattered lives. I'm talking about people that just about didn't recover. But I saw God come down. [Music] &gt;&gt; I saw God come down &gt;&gt; and lay hold of their situation and say to Satan, "No more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have them anymore. &gt;&gt; You can't go any further. I'm going to bring the restraint. And now I pour in the oil and the wine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they come into a healing process. &gt;&gt; And it's so wonderful. I've got to close and I got to close with this. There's one thing that's a threat. There's one thing first I'll say that is essential to this ministry of this church. That is compassion. &gt;&gt; Compassion. I want you to think about that word for a few moments. If a person has compassion, you begin to become consumed with other person's need rather than your own life. Compassion is something and brother Brandham I I'll have to come to it. I have to come to it. Will you give me a few more minutes? &gt;&gt; Amen. There's two very very long quotes. I'm not I can't I can't read them. But I was touched. I was so touched with I had to leave my chair and I had to get on my knees and weep my own heart out before God. But at that day at Calvary, and I'm just going to take my time. Is that all right for a few minutes? He says, "When he died at Calvary," now I'm talking about compassion. "When he died at Calvary, he made a way. He gave up the spirit, the Holy Spirit, that sent it back to the earth for you and I to live by." Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to that day at Calvary. He died and released the spirit to come back upon you and upon me to live by. So whatever that spirit that you and I are living by, it'll be the same spirit that was in him when he went to Calvary. This is brother Bram's whole message when he went to Calvary. And it says that's what Calvary means to us to follow him. He was just one man. He gave his life and he made an example for you. Now he says, "What must what must we do?" He says, "Now the first thing I want to say is here's the first thing. Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Calvary was the personification of that life. He never went to Calvary for himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It was a personification of a life that was given for others. &gt;&gt; He lived his whole life for others. Now he's on the cross dying accused ill ill uh spoken and witnessed against and he's standing there hanging there dying there to give us an example so that when the spirit leaves him and comes into us we'll live the same kind of life that was the personification we look at Calvary that's exactly what brother Brandham is saying &gt;&gt; that's right just for a few moments, please. He said that's Jesus never lived for himself. His life was spent for others. And that's that's perfectly eternal life. He says, "But when you live your life for to yourself, you haven't eternal life. Eternal life is living for others." So, we hear that so many many times. I just decided I needed to really break down break that down and focus on it. He said it proved it when he came in the lamb of God. He lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself. He lived for others. And you receive eternal life by receiving that day. And you don't live for yourself no more. You live for others. &gt;&gt; And someone said said to brother Brandham, "How can you stand?" Now notice the the right angle turn he's taking in his message. How can you stand and let anyone call you such bad names? Now it's coming down to his address. He said you don't live for yourself. You live for others that you might redeem that man. &gt;&gt; But that you might nourish that man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you might restore that person who's calling you bad names. saying evil reports about you or whatever more. But if we if we had that person saying slanderous things and innuendos and kind of snide remarks, you know, against you and you rear up and say, "Well, you know, you're not so perfect or I know a few things about you." Brother Brandham said from the things that that God would reveal to him or the things that were confessed in that little room, he said there'll be court cases. &gt;&gt; It'll tear homes all to pieces. &gt;&gt; So what was he doing? Hiding those things? No, he's protecting them because the direction is a a direction of of healing. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; I had a call yesterday. said, "Should I call the authorities about this situation? Should I call the authorities and involve them?" Had to say, "I know we've got police brothers here and in in front of them and in front of the world." I said, "That's the last thing you want to do. You're going to destroy your child." He said, "That's what I thought." This is someone who used to sit here years ago. But as soon as this call, even though it was in the midst of my studies, as soon as the call came, I took the call because I wanted to see what it was. And he's seeking counsel, and I believe it was godly counsel. I said, I've had many experiences along these lines. He says, that's exactly how I felt in my heart. I need to do that about his child. You see friends, it is this it is this healing ministry. And I have felt I'm coming down to the end of the road. This is not brother Ed Biscll's ministry. It's your ministry. &gt;&gt; It's a ministry. I didn't hear enough amen out of that. &gt;&gt; It's a ministry of the congregation. And it's the ministry. Maybe you don't have to study to preach next Sunday or whatever more or next Wednesday, but it's your ministry. And anybody that gets the idea that the preacher does it is completely wrong. It's your ministry. And the fact that we have telephones and iPods and texts and all of these kind of things that unless that unless that's being used in a positive way, I wouldn't use it. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't let it spread gospel. I wouldn't let my fingers handle and spread gossip. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't tear somebody down. I'd build them up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Looking down here at brother Andrew and his wife said to Dorothy, I had in Ukraine the brother said to me, "What is that Polish brother in your church?" I said, "Brother Andrew, yes. Yes. He and his family." And he said, "I came there and I didn't have a jacket." and they gave me a jacket and they you know he he said I he said give them many many thanks what is it somebody on the other side of the world remembers the kindness that was poured out upon them there's nothing that hidden from God [Applause] &gt;&gt; you live for others &gt;&gt; to redeem that man &gt;&gt; he said you're taking you're taking low congregation, prophet, messenger saying to you, you're taking Christ's place. &gt;&gt; What an honor. &gt;&gt; I say, "Father, I accept that." &gt;&gt; Could you raise your hand with me? &gt;&gt; Father, I accept that. Would you do that? I accept that you're taking Christ's place. &gt;&gt; You are sons, so you don't live for yourself. &gt;&gt; I take Christ's place. Two more last little thoughts. I hope to be done about five minutes. Brother Brandham makes a point, a strong point. And he says, "This isn't this isn't consciously done. It's unconsciously done. Don't go out of here saying, "Well, now I have to try to do it. I have to kind of find to do it. I I've got to find ways that I, you know, I I got to find a way so I can, you know, be giving and I want to always be giving and I want to encourage people and so on so forth." No, you let the Holy Spirit take this word this morning and start to just live in you. You'll just do it unconsciously. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't do it for reward. There's no such a reward for it. You just do it unconsciously. And lastly, if compassion living for others, brother Brandon was he was talking to his old friend Samadair and he says, "Dr. Samadair and I, we grew up as boys together. He walked into Samadair's office one day and and this is actually in Bruce Serpent. I have about three, four more pages, but I haven't got time." But of you that know the message and you know what Bruce Serpent was all about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And this and this message happened to be just a few months. It was between Are you listening close? &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm telling you something I never told you before and hope I never have to tell you again. It was living. It was it was between the first time I went took brother Brandham on a rest and a hunt and the second time and in between he preached Bruce Serpent because people want to say he's he's Lord because it gets so close. You understand? Understand? Please understand. When John came on the scene, the spirit of Elijah, you have to understand this, the spirit of Elijah is so close to that of Christ that people have always got them confused. &gt;&gt; Listen now. When John came on the scene, the spirit of Elijah to proclaim the first coming, they said to him, "Are you the Christ?" He said, "No." Why do they say that? Because that's what they felt. They felt something sacred. They felt something holy. They felt something very godly. Are you Christ? No, I'm not. Are you Elijah? Said, "No, I'm not." Because he knew that there was a further coming of Elijah. That's right. &gt;&gt; That he was not fulfilling comprehensively. And in fact is Faucet and Brown's commentary on the Bible which is a Baptist commentary if you go to Malachi that's exactly what they say. That is why Eli that's why John said no. Then when Jesus came the king the authority said it John has come back. Now we have the actual Messiah, God, the fullness of the Godhead bodily in a man, Jesus Christ, and they're confusing it with John the Baptist. When John was here, they thought he was Christ &gt;&gt; or they thought he was Elijah. Then when Christ came, they thought he's John. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham came, they thought he was Christ. &gt;&gt; No big deal. And he took Bruce Serpent. You've never heard this before. I'm telling you some things I've never told you before because I don't know how much longer I'll be around. I was in a I was in the motel room with brother Brandham and uh the meetings were over and we're just going to go downtown to a store. just he and I standing there and a knock came on the door and we opened the door and there was a woman standing there very very godly uh believer and so we just opened the door and she just stepped in and she was standing her hands and just kind of looking very humble and I felt uncomfortable. I did not feel a good I didn't feel anything good about it. So I I said to brother Brandham, should I just step outside? So I said, he said, I think that'll be fine. So, I just stepped at a little we wooden porch and I stepped on that wooden porch and just stood there and waited for maybe 10 minutes and the door opened and she came out and I went in and uh so we just get, you know, Brother Brand was getting ready to go in the car and so we got in the car and started driving and now he's talking very very fast and nervous and uh he said, "Brother Eddie, He said, "Uh, do you know what that woman tried to do?" And I said, "No." Said, "She tried to worship me." Now, don't feel something drastic about that. They tried to worship me in India. They tried to worship Brother Lonnie Jenkins. It was just a part of their custom. But this was different. And this woman tried to worship him. And he said, "Woman," and she called him Lord. And he said,"Woman, my father was a Catholic, an alcoholic, and my mother was a Catholic. Does that sound like the parents of your Lord?" And she said, "Oh, you just have to say it that way." And she called him Lord. And then he said, these are his words to me, "Woman." He said, "The first time he said, sister." Then this time he says,"Woman, you don't know what spirit you're of." And that was the end of the conversation. And she left. In the next few days, he's speaking and nervous and he says to me, "Brother Ed," he said, "Please, please forgive me." He said, "I just can't. I'm just so tore tore up over what that woman did." Why am I telling you this? Not to give you a story. I'm telling you this the next time you read Bruce Serpent and I had the notes here out of there. He talks about he talks this is what he says says I went to see my good friend Dr. Samadair and uh says, "Hi, hi Doc. How are you?" He says, "Not bad. How are you?" He said, "I'm not bad." And uh they start speaking about their life cuz they've been boy friends since boyhood. and he asked him he said uh he said to his doctor friend he said well I don't know just how long we're going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said that's true Bill and I said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now I've kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes. So it doesn't matter when he comes. And he said that is true. I said the greatest thrill I give you all of this background for these statements. The greatest thrill that I have is living for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. the greatest thrill that I have is living for others. &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's what makes life real." The doctor said, "That's what makes life's real is when you not what you can do or accomplish for yourself, but what you can do for others." &gt;&gt; That's what when you're really living. Amen. &gt;&gt; Docadair said &gt;&gt; and brother Bram says and there happens to be if there happens to be someone among us who has never did that and I felt I have to say that to this congregation this morning. If there happens to be someone here when brother Brandham lived when he spoke these words life was a lot simpler than it is right now. It was a complex age, but he said, "We live and you live in a very complex age." And if the greatest thing that a prophet of God could do would be to live for others, I can guarantee you the spirit of this age is exactly the opposite. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is to live for yourself and do it for yourself and get your education and get your scholarship and get this and get your job and get your raise and get your vacation time and get your whatever whatever it might be. That's the whole spirit of the age. &gt;&gt; Right, &gt;&gt; friends? If you would never hear my voice again, you go at these doors, I I would pray that you'll be resolved. That you're going to change that you are not going to be dictated to by the spirit of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this congregation would be a giving congregation. This congregation would be a congregation that is prepared to give of themselves &gt;&gt; with the spirit of Christ in them. And he goes on, he said, "If there's if there's no one that's never did that," he said, "Try it. Try to live for somebody else, give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will do when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life, but what you can give someone else &gt;&gt; in life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. That's his words. That's the spirit of Christ. And this congregation, I thank you for the spirit of giving and hospitality, your prayers. But I have to announce to you, God wants us to make a drastic step and a shift. And you'll start getting out of life so much more than you had ever expected. And I'm closing just now, but there's people in this congregation, there's people in this congregation, they were not well off. They had a number of children in their family. But after Sunday morning service, there's a number of people and some of them are in this service right now, different races that gathered every Sunday to that home. And that sister who had a sizable family, always had food on, and they had their fellowship. till the evening service. And that was almost Sunday after Sunday after Sunday, not for weeks or months, but for years. And God blessed that family. And I know on down the road, people may be look and say, "Oh, yeah. Well, you know, God so blessed them." You got it backwards. They just did something unconsciously. That was the thing to do. Here's some young brothers had no place to go and they came to our place or that place and that family's children are here. They probably don't even know who I'm speaking about. One Christmas time, my wife and I said, "For Christmas, people are with their family. We decided we were going to have brothers who have no family." And so we invited them. There was a man who was a bachelor that lived in Maryland and Mike's basement on the island. and we invited him and he came and he came early and he was sitting on my sofa. My wife was getting dinner ready. He went like this and he picked out a picture out of his wallet and held it up and it was the it was the boy that was raised from the dead in Finland. And he said, "Have you ever seen this picture?" I said, 'Yes, that's the boy that was raised from the dead in Finland. He said, 'I just visited him. He's a policeman now on the highway patrol just out of Helsinki. I was rewarded. I wasn't looking for a reward. It was just the right thing to do to have brothers there that didn't have any home or family, but I was rewarded by it. You see friends, living for others is really the life. It's the highest calling that you can have. I think most rewarding I will say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we bow our heads? Lord Jesus, your presence, not only your presence, but your life is the life that we desire to be expressed in us. This has been a different service. You have been dealing with me differently, Lord. And I I I want to just make myself open, oh God. I feel as though I have missed so much, Lord. Even you become occupied and taken up with burdens and of life and people's concerns and the burdens of the church and whatever more. But yet Lord I I personally this morning I want to rededicate myself. We want to with this congregation and I pray oh God that each of them each one that you're speaking to each you'll have to do the speaking Lord. You'll have to touch their hearts, oh God, and just open their hearts up. And if they have a desire, and I believe that they do, we want to make ourselves available, Lord. We want to say, "Here I am. Bring me into this situation. Let the Holy Spirit begin to work through my life. Lord, begin to work. Use my hands. Use my feet. Use my mouth. Put a seal, oh God, upon my speaking that I will not say anything contrary, but I will build up the body of Jesus Christ. Cause me to be an active active member. Cause me, oh God, to live for others. I pray, Father, you'll turn my direction that we'll not live for ourselves to just improve or to better our own situation, but may we just make ourselves available to you. Oh God, we surrender and dedicate ourselves to you. And in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray Lord, you'll receive us. There's so many young men and women that are here. Father, let this service be a milestone in their lives. I pray that homes will be opened, lives will be opened, that there will be a a a closer fellowship amongst the people, oh God, not for lightness or frivolity, but for spiritual strengthening of one another. And let the Holy Spirit through this movement, through this body, have a movement of nourishment to the body of Christ. Not only locally, but may they realize, oh God, that we're reaching far beyond the boundaries of this building to others that are far away in different lands and different countries and different places. Let us be a tool, Father, in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. All that I have and all that I am. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Let's sing them jointly now as a prayer everyone with lifting up your voice. All that I am. All that I am. All I shall ever be. [Music] Can not repay my own. I surrender to thee. Let's sing it again. And I wonder, brother Jonathan, if you're here, if you could just come up, please. All that I am, all that I am, all I surrender. Grant it, Lord Jesus. hear the prayer and not repay the love I surrender to thee. I feel like singing it once more again, please. I'd like you to notice the last words. Cannot repay the love debt. A week ago, Wednesday, I just said, "I am debtor." Now I turn it just a wee bit. We are all debtors. We're debtors. To demonstrate, to show this compassion, I believe we're in debt. I've actually imposed a debt on you today to live for others. Do you accept that? &gt;&gt; This is not an option. This is a requirement by the scripture. Our Lord live for others. We just adjust things to do it according to the Holy Spirit. I feel very very compelled this morning to let you know that this is the ministry of healing of this church. And whether it is by your prayers, your dedication in your particular area and make plans, make plans, definite plans. I want to serve the bride of Jesus Christ. And the prophet of God says, "If you haven't done it, try it. You'll find that life is so fulfilling." Amen. &gt;&gt; Of course it will be because you're allowing the spirit of Christ to come through you. I surrender all to thee, all that I have. And then and then we're going to have the baptismal right away. Soon as we've done singing one more course after this, if you must dismiss, you just dismiss quietly. I'll have a prayer. And those that can remain, it'll only be a few minutes. And we'll have our brother baptized. I think it's nice to support him having driven six hours. He has to go six hours back right after service. So we'll sing this once again as a prayer. I'm I'm joining with you. I'm joining with you. Oh, [Music] shall [Music] be [Music] the love that I [Music] surrender to the &gt;&gt; I have a father. If I have a father, then [Music] &gt;&gt; I have a [Music] before my heart. And before even time began, my life was in his hand. He knows my name. He knows my everyone. He sees his hear me when I go. [Music] I have a father. He calls me his home. &gt;&gt; How wonderful. And you never [Music] [Music] Oh, hear me when I call. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I've been We're just waiting for the brothers. I've had a simple prayer while I was just away and talking to the Lord in the woods. And yesterday, a number of times, I've had a simple prayer. Maybe you want to join me in that prayer. What would you have me to do? As I walk I work my way through this message. So, what would you have me to do? What would what would please you? What do you want me to do? And I believe he sees our heart and we're prepared and ready. Whatever you say, Lord, I'll do. What would you have me to do? And these words were in my mind. I have a father. Surely he'll tell me what he wants me to do. I have a father. Let's just sing that again. I have a father. I have a father. [Music] He calls his and he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, [Music] [Music] He sees me fall. [Music] You may be seated. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for your time today to uh be with our brother Paul Richmond that God's been dealing with now for the last seven, eight years. His wife Sonia is here and his family, they drove here today and need to go right back home. Paul desires to be filled with the Holy Spirit. And he desires the life of God that he's heard about, that he's studied, he's looked for, but now he knows he's come to this place that Jesus Christ would step inside of his life, that the old man would die and that the new man would come forth. And that's what we're with you for today here, brother Paul. I'm just gonna let you speak with time. &gt;&gt; About eight years ago, my wife was standing here. About 8 years ago, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all of our lives are different when we respond to in relationship. Sometimes they're quick, sometimes there's long, but what we're happy about is there's finally a day comes when there's a marriage takes place. So that's what we want to rejoice with brother Paul about today. And brother Paul, I felt to say this to you that all the years and all the things that's gone on, God's had grace upon your life and mercy to continue around your life to give you this opportunity. &gt;&gt; And I just pray that the Holy Spirit will come and fill this vessel. We've gone through the scriptures and gone through the things together and brother Paul knows exactly what the Lord has for him. Let's agree together that the Lord will just come and fill this life. &gt;&gt; Lord, what a great opportunity it is to be standing with you at this end time and know that your grace and mercy is able to win a heart, is able to terry with a soul. You deal with our natures and the way that we are in so many different ways, but the end result of it is we come to you when you call to us. And that is a wonderful thing, God. I pray that you bless our brother Paul today. I pray that you would fill him with your Holy Spirit as we spoke about your word and he's repented and he knows that this is a step of faith. I pray as you reveal yourself to him that you would draw closer and that you would fill his life today and in the coming days and the time that you would have for us before you take us home that our brother Paul and his wife, his children that they would recognize that there's been another life, there's been another person step into their home and it's been none other than you, Lord. Pray that you bless him in his desire, his willingness, his sincerity. I pray as he travels home today, God, that his heart would burn within him. That the word would come alive. That this relationship, this marriage that we spoke about, that it would become more dearer, more wonderful, more lovely. Bless him now, Lord. May the fire of God take this vessel as he goes down into the water and the old man is put to rest. May he rise in a resurrection and a new life and a new hold, a new hope, a new experience. I pray the token would be upon him even today that the blood would be applied to brother Paul's life. We thank you Lord and we receive your Holy Spirit to another part of your body being joined today into this great family. We thank you Lord in Jesus name. Brother Paul, just according to your desire and your hungry hungry heart and thirsty heart to receive Jesus Christ into your life, I baptize you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just going to stand. We're going to have prayer. We're going to ask our brother Deepak if you'll come, please. Uh our brother Deepac needs work desperately and you've been almost overqualified for the places that he's applied. So we as a congregation are going to pray just now. What are you going to do? We're just going to give a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to pray together. I wonder brother DJ would you join also with our brother DPAC?
