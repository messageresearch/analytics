just sing that little song the greatest love story so i'm casting all my cares and we'll start with the verse and just invite for the michael to come and bring the word ready to receive tonight your ears unstopped ready to hear have you been clothed in the word already amen it's another opportunity saying verse one i left the barren land [Music] i left the barren land searching for bread

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i know [Music] [Music] no longer [Music] hey man i'm so glad we can cast our cares on somebody that can take them you know you can cast all your burdens on somebody you can unload your your problems and all in the person's like oh my goodness i just can't take it all but he can take every bit of it amen you can unload your burdens on him abraham you can just say lord this is my need tonight this is my care this is my worry he said i'll just take it all cast it on me tonight amen amen well in about a week and a bit we have camp already think of that my goodness it's been two years since we've had a winter camp two years wow and to think that we almost didn't have that winter camp is also thank you lord for our pastor who said we're having one so but here we are two years later still standing and we're ready for the lord to do a mighty work this really meet us in a special way but we're having a pre-camp service next wednesday because butter andrew glover's going to preach here next wednesday so man we're going to just i wouldn't say don't pull too hard but uh leave a little bit for kampa amen so in louis just as in prep for that there's just a couple little pieces we will have a counselors meeting this sunday and you will be receiving an email soon about that those that will counselors will need you there and so just expect those that do get an email we will meet in the back in the chapel there on rides i do want to just make a little announcement just about carpooling when we go down because it's not as simple as it used to be two years ago and so those that are i haven't heard any but if you have an issue with driving down there we need to know who would have some space and if you're needing a ride down because maybe parents can't drive down to the state side and and also on the way back so that you know someone isn't stranded and and can't get back because a parent can't come and pick them up on the sunday so we do need to be aware and so if you don't have a ride and you need one please call the office and let us know and then uh if you do have actually space in your car when you're going down and coming back if you could let us know at the office as well and saying that those that would be maybe calling saying i need a ride make sure you're self-sufficient and self-sustained on your device and your arrive can and all of that the driver is not going to be loading you on their app and if you have no clue what i'm saying then you really need to call the office because you'll be in trouble crossing the border so if you've never crossed the border and you have no clue about arrived can it's your first time to do that for this camp as such please do call us at the office and we'll give you a a real good rundown of what what you need to do because it's a serious business there really serious business at the border so we want to make sure that we're you you have the information need all right so there's that there i think i'll just leave it at that amen well let's turn to our bibles this morning this evening this morning that's a funny joke thank you musicians we're going to turn to deuteronomy 31. i'm just going to take a little bit of a maybe a part two per se of the last service we spoke and just take a maybe a bit of different direction but it's stepping off and we've preached last time on battlefield battle for truth amen and we said the battle was still raging and it still is even today right we left this left off the service just ending with with elijah and the showdown there at mount carmel and uh but we'll so maybe just read that scripture thereafter but we'll just uh just open with deuteronomy 31 and 22. good to see everybody tonight wednesday night we are having a baptismal service on sunday amen so if you're feeling a tug in your heart there's water in the tank and there'll be someone baptizing amen glory that's not a small thing for the lord to move upon a heart somebody that's a that's that's a big deal even in this day and hour truth can prick someone's heart say you know what i want to give my heart to lord that's an amazing thing i'm so thankful for that deuteronomy 23 and 20 story 31-22 moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it to the children of israel and he gave joshua the son of none a charge and said be strong and of good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i swear unto them and i will be with thee amen i'll just note there be of good courage is what he was told but it was a charge it was pretty forceful it wasn't just like maybe think about it it was a charge all right and this wasn't this was god speaking through moses now maybe turn over to first kings just to refresh our mind a little bit 18 and 20. that was a chapter where elijah was a show down there at mount carmel and that in a verse 20 i'll just just to kind of bring it back where we were ahab sent under the children of israel and verse 20 there chapter 18 gathered all the prophets together under mount carmel and elijah came unto all the people and said how long hall g between two opinions amen we talked about truth and false and if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word my let's just pray heavenly father we're so thankful we have a place to gather tonight so cognizant lord that it wasn't this way just a few months back lord i think of the brothers and sisters in china it's not this way lord they're doing many different things now i wouldn't even mention lord over a pulpit but lord would you go to the believers in china right now here we can enjoy each other's fellowship we can sing the songs of zion lord we can open your word and you can speak to us lord through it and lord our brothers and sisters lord are battling and suffering lord in a different situation lord would you give them lord just a supernatural outpouring of strength and grace and mercy lord for lord we're a body and when they suffer we suffer and so we lift them up before you lord that you would lord be so near and special to them tonight would you be the same to us lord would you meet our needs the cry of our heart as we sang the song casting all our cares upon you lord may no one hold their cares back and lord hold them into their heart and just lord not mention them lord you are the great burden-bearer and lord may they may you just express to them you say i can take your burden tonight lay it at my feet lord if you could be that near that personal tonight we would be so grateful for that lord we pray break your word open it lord to our not just our natural human ears but lord our spiritual ears and eyes that they would be open to see and receive what you'd have to speak to us lord we'll yield ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated i'm going to just speak a little bit on as i said the battle for truth but i want to take you just a bit of a subject or off shoot of it and i want to speak about men and women of courage men and women of courage is because in a battle if you're lacking thereof and courage you might as well just stay off the battlefield because that's probably one of the particular things you need fighting you need some serious courage as you come against a foe and so i just want to speak about courage in our day and and uh and then and the need for it and what it is a little bit but i can imagine that elijah when he went up there at the show down there on mount carmel you know we can just read over and kind of glaze over the scripture or read it for just the you know the text but you know when you really get into the story i can imagine that elijah as he walked he was all alone as he walked up that hill in preparation i can i would imagine and believe the lord had shown him already what was happening as he was a prophet i'm sure he was going there with full confidence of what the lord was going to do not wondering what was happening but that would have taken i would even in that he would have been filled with some serious courage knowing god was going before him and here he was a one-man battle against all of baal and all their priests and such and i just you know marvel here we couldn't put ourselves in elijah's sandals and recognize what you know what those positions took even think of brother branham and the different ones and the what they went through we look at the ministry of each that they have and he said wow what it would be to be elijah or brother branham or whatever but what a sacrifice the toll that they took they needed courage to bear the weight of that ministry to bear the weight of that burden and uh you know so we were just speaking last service and there's as we we talked about a battle and yes there's different ideas of man we talked about truth and we talked about relativity and truth and that but you know it's good to it might be good to isolate that and recognize it but which side are you fighting on which side tonight are you fighting on you you've seen it we spoke about it last service but i want to know whose truth are you fighting for and are you really willing to fight for the truth that you're you're standing for you know you you answer your own question who who am i standing for god's truth or some idea of my own and is my own idea really worth standing for and fighting again fighting for because you i would really if i was fighting it about i really want to know what i was standing for that it was worth the cost that i was willing to give it was if i was in war and i was fighting i'd want to know that what i'm fighting for value was really equal to my life because that's what i'm willing to lay down right and so the warriors that fight to do that you must have courage to do that and courage is is a mental or moral strength to venture or to persevere and withstand danger or fear or difficulty courage is daring or it's daringness or dauntlessness gallantry it's guts it's gutsiness hardy hardy hood as they s as it says hearts and heroism intestinal fortitude somewhere deep down inside it's moxie it's nerve it's prowess it's stoutness it's valor and it's virtue those are all aspects of courage so courage adventure persevere through difficulty something that's super hard something that's you know very very difficult or you know something to manage or overcome it's just beyond maybe the your your ability and so you're having to dig down deep into some some other realm this would take many cases some courage you know we're as humans we're a little bit averse to difficulty we don't really like difficulty do we no we don't say what it is humans don't like it they want the easy way that's just natural to mankind you're going to find the easiest way and so courage is a trait that pushes someone beyond or into the beyond the realm of just easy it's an inner strength that you draw down on something that shows you it and when there's something difficult it pushes you past you know into that realm and you can go beyond just the status quo it's when you pull up and pull pull in some inner realm of courage now it has nothing to do with your your physical biceps you know or your your pictorials or your ab muscles it's not it's not based on your physical strength right your hamstrings or anything of that how fast you can run how far you can throw how many chin ups you can do it just doesn't really matter courage goes beyond that realm so you say well i'm not i'm not a muscle-bound guy and not a girl hopefully not but uh it doesn't really matter courage is forever it goes beyond that realm and so it's it's a mental realm it's a it's a different realm it's it's and it will go into spiritual realm you know if you think about sometimes are limits you say well that's too difficult me i can't go i can't really go beyond that you know the navy seals they have a 40 rule or or kind of rule of thumb and they say your max is really 40 of what you can do really yeah it's all up here it's really all up here we think our bodies tap out but it's really actually our bodies have it in us physically it's just our mental capacity stops us and says it's game over ain't gonna happen there and a fellow was talking about it and he he had a navy seal come to his house and they were talking about this issue and he says you know how do you do this how do you push past you know past the into that realm of difficulty and they said well you know he says get he they did some chin ups he says give me eight you know give me some chin up something as you can do and he he squeaked out eight chin ups [Laughter] well okay he he mustered up eight chin-ups i said okay good for you i said now he goes do some more and he put out six chin ups all right he said do it again three chin ups you know he's like couldn't do it anymore not even one more his arms were noodles and it was just over so he had you know 17 chin-ups in total or so you know if you add it up right and uh but what happened and so then the seal said all right now give me a hundred more. it's just not it's just not there this said it wasn't there but actually one by one he did a hundred more one at a time one at a time and he squeaked out not just squeaked that's like blew out a hundred more and so his body actually had the ability to do it it was just a mental limit that wouldn't let him get past it right and so you might feel like well i don't really have what it takes i'm feeling weak and i'm i'm feeling tired or i'm the devil's really hammering on me and you feel like well i just don't have the courage to really keep going i don't really have what's in me to really press on it's a mental thing actually you have it spiritually down there and you need to look in the word of god because that's what's going to open up and tell you no there's more there and so we just say hey read this scripture read that scripture and he starts to open up well i can do one more i can do one i can go another day i can get through this trial because it's actually just a devil trying to put a little limitation on what you're actually capable of doing spiritually amen so remember the 40 rule in everything you do naturally and spiritually there's more you got more there so courage is this trait that maybe some would be would feel is rare maybe it's a fringe trait these days and uh you know as people aren't willing to withstand but i looked at different examples of great courage in the past and different names came up as you would look at situations that people did and you look and you're like wow you know they really went to next next level we think of people like abraham lincoln who really took the took the courage to stay the course and eliminate slavery which that would have taken a lot of courage to stand where he would have and the opposition that he would have dealt with there was a a man who just recently was running and jogging and he saw a bus plummet into a over a uh a trolley car actually over an uh uh over a dam and it went into the water and it uh it dropped in there and he was just running he jumped in we didn't even think about it just jumped in and he started saving there was 90 something people in there he was able to save 20. and it effectively went into a coma for 45 days himself he just went down there was just something something that was there he didn't even know it was there you don't even know it's there until you get into a situation as something starts to pull up within you a deep courage that you didn't know existed so sometimes it's the trial that you're going through that god's wanting to pull out of you to let you know you got something deeper than you think like i could never do that but then you go through something you oh god why am i going but he's saying no because you got something deep down inside your soul you can do this amen fellow the name of roy benavidez he was a soldier he took 37 wounds in a six-hour fight in vietnam trying to extract a 12-man troop that was a reconnaissance troop and they just went it just went bad and he he jumped on a helicopter that was coming that was just bringing some some reinforcements and he jumped on on it just to go in he was at command center and then he gets dropped in in the next six hours through multiple helicopter crashes and and a six-hour firefight 37 wounds and they he wouldn't even let them pull him off until he knew the last guy that they could get was out and just and also bodies not even just wounded but the dead and he was given a medal of honor for that again something far far down in the trials of a real deep very hard situation something starts to well up inside and i was thinking of our brother henry walter as i was thinking heroes of our even right here right now going through a deep deep situation that's a modern day cloverdale bible way hero of courage amen i was thinking about a ron spencer who's been preaching for these numerous years now after after the devil trying to take him away and say you only got a few months but something deep down starts to wet up and say not happening something a strength within that's a spiritual courage within stands up and says i'm fighting this battle satan amen brother henry you fight the battle i was singing brother brother kim is of beth as you mentioned her last sunday she took that step by step up as you were doing that hike i said that's nothing short of a supernatural courage deep in a heart that can just take one step at a time with the battle raging inside of her body satan trying to take her but that's courage that's a courage within that wells up i say saints that's inside of you god might be just molding you a little bit or a certain trial a little bit but he's finding a courage that he said joe you could actually take that and look back and say whoo i went through that i got i got i'm a courageous god charges joshua to be courageous we'll go there that was deuteronomy and joshua it says have not i the lord commanded thee so he charges him in deuteronomy and then commands him be strong and courageous lord be strong of good courage be not afraid neither thou be dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest so it's actually not even an optional characteristic it's not optional not really we're charged were commanded i said well i might not have it you will you will when you get there amen yes sir but you know when you with when someone someone like that soldier that could go and take 37 wounds and i mean they were all over it's because he believed in something he believed what they were doing was right and so he was willing to give it all all the way to the death all the way so when truth is at your back you're willing to go all the way you're willing to give out everything you've got amen you make sure truth is at your back spiritually speaking amen check you say what am i actually standing for right now what am i standing for men have died in all these wars because they stood for something for truth or what they believed was whether it was freedom whatever they were standing for and then when the spies went into into uh into the land to spy out the land and caleb and joshua went in there and moses said what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether it be wood therein or not or be and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes and so we know this well moses had been telling him to go and spy out the land go in there 12 spies two of them being joshua and caleb and they had to believe that moses was telling the truth way back in exodus 3 god told moses he says i'll take you to a land of milk and honey amen so moses knew god had already told him but they had to believe what moses was telling him was truth that's what they were relying on go into the land seek it out this is the land that god has given us and now they're willing to go in there and start spying out what was gonna happen and it was v so here he goes and delet and he's and we're gonna deliver you which they did so now part one has happened i'm gonna take you out of egypt i'm gonna take you out of this land with a mighty hand and so now that has been vindicated moses word and now here it is go spy out the land so he says now be courageous go out there and find it and so now they could put their backs against a vindicated word of a prophet because the prophet that spoke to them saying god's going to bring you out of this land of egypt and he did now he's saying now go into the land and spy it out because god's given it to us it's a land of milk and honey it's overflowing it's ours go and take a look at it bring back some first fruits because it was the land of the first ripe grapes or the time all right he told us he told us a word already it came to pass that's a true prophet he said go into the land spy it out it's going to come to pass we can be courageous because our back is against truth what he said came to pass so i'm going forward not afraid amen that's where caleb and joshua were so now here they go and they told him and they said in numbers we came under the land whether thou sent us and surely it flowed with milk and honey so now that they're confirming once again the words you spoke are true nevertheless the people be strong to dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the children of anak the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and jebusites and amorites and the canaanites by the sea and caleb stilled the people he says whoa hold it now moses told us this he told us that god would bring us out of egypt and it came to pass he told us it would be a land flowing with milk and honey and it came to pass so what do we worry about be of good courage it's our land oh oh you know people say no ain't happening let us go up at once he says and possess it why not you can be courageous in the face of the enemy when you know you stand on truth that's the point stand on truth and you can stand toe to toe with the enemy and say i'm coming it's mine he said possess it and i will amen but if you stand on your own concoction of truth don't you dare step your toe to the devil because he'll wallop you but the men went up with him and said no we're not able to go up against the people for they're stronger than we my two out of 12 of those spy 16 or so said that we're able caleb and joshua and here they come back from the land it's a good land but they didn't have the courage to overcome it didn't have the courage to overcome it because they didn't believe the word they were given saints we've been given a prophet's word we've been given a word in this day we can stand on thus saith the lord just like joshua and caleb and we can possess the promises of god for they are true and they have been vindicated it's a vindicated word just as joshua and caleb could stand on that and say uh it happened time and time again so can we stand on a vindicated word say this is our land the word of god's been opened up to us i'm taking every promise and the book is mine amen amen but abram says i believe we're at the judgment seat speaking to cadence barnea he says we're crushing crossing over let's not make that mistake that they made he says they gathered out of each tribe 12 spies as we talked about in there grasshoppers they say doubting god's promise it's a pleasant land we can take it we can't take it because we're too small but joshua and caleb wasn't looking at how big the walls was how big the man was they were looking to what god had said saints let's look to what god had said we've had some services over these last months that have been laying down faith have been building up your faith have been bringing us to a point and i'm just saying take courage god's word is not going to fail we're standing on the true word of god it don't matter what the circumstance says just stand strong he says to you dear philadelphian people regardless of how the wind blows how it seems this way or that way how many threats come outside the world keep your mind on what jesus said he give us a promise it's already ours he says i don't care how great opposition looks god will fulfill his word let's look to the word it's here for us amen amen so no courage if it's false but if it's true you can stand really anchored and strong amen and so here now when it's false let's contradict this or contrast this i should say wrong word for we have heard it said just just another chapter past joshua 1. they said well we've heard how the lord dried up the water this is rahab speaking from the red sea and when he came out of egypt and what he did to the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side of jordan see han and og and we were utterly utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage not a dime of it a heart melted there was nothing left why because they heard the god that was could hear and answer prayer a god that could deliver them out of the israelites what what what they heard the stories and they seen it happen they heard what happened and it was true and they're like oh dear goodness if that happened there it can happen here and there was nothing what were they standing on a big mighty fortress circumstance looked pretty huge right they could run chariots or whatever across the walls they should have felt pretty secure but their hearts melted because there was a god that parted a red sea there was a god that completely destroyed the mighty power of egypt and so here jericho is like our hearts are gone and our courage is empty because they had nothing to back up against amen satan's got nothing to back up against he's got a bluff to back up against so when that's exactly you say uh-huh sorry devil you just want to hear what's happened this is what my god did what are you able to do that his heart will melt because he's got no truth to stand on not an ounce of truth the father of lies is what he is so why would you want to step into his ring and in his corner why stand on his side and believe what he's trying to tell you why why do that why fight for him be like well this is what the devils why why would you do that it's a losing battle standing in his ring saying i need to switch sides i need to switch sides on the other side we heard about on sunday as a as a roaring lion did we not hear that but the lion as we heard in the last two services went about roaring the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed as the scripture says that's the sight i want to be on i want to be on the side where truth prevails so i can stand with courage and fight and say um devil your your heart is melted amen courage god don't want cowards don't want cowards but abraham said that he can't use you if you're afraid to take his word and believe him he wants gallant men women won't pay attention to nothing but what the lord says that's the kind he has to move with gallant men and women we need men of courage we need women of courage and you know courageous men is not exactly the going trend today i'm going to stop there for a little bit because it's an age of weak-kneed men little high-shorted little fruity tooties running their little little jogging things and pumping their little weights and they're as manly as a paper clip and that's the age we are in right now and it's weakening it weakens the people and far be it for that to be in the body of god's people amen so we're just going to knock the devil a little bit and say not in this body not in the body of christ we're men where men are men we're manly men of god who are courageous men of god who take god at his word a real man no he's a man with fortitude fortitude's a strength or firmness of mind courage of soul which enables this person or this man to encounter danger with coolness this is fortitude this is a man okay he can bear pain or adversity murmuring depression or despondency that's that's a that's what fortitude means so strength of mind that's conviction you're strong on what you believe you have principles that's that's this is fortitude courage of soul so we got courage of soul spiritual courage bearing adversary adversity some pain he's got some strength to endure this is a man who's got fortitude and a man is basically a man when he stands on principle he's a man when he stands on principle his convictions has courage to uphold that principle and the strength to sustain the attack against it amen he has fortitude amen that's a man in this day i'm just going to try and bring some simple definition down to a man now women on the other hand that's not how they are they they seek to be a they're more they're protected they they need to be nourished and cherished as we would maybe use some words that's normal for a woman but a man he's he's out he's he he's ready to take it on he's a protector that's what a man is that's what a man should be if i preach this out there i probably wouldn't be too popular and be like well that's nothing but the man that i am around that's what men should be man on the other hand is designed by god to be a protector to be a savior for their family if you will for their wives for their children to provide security accomplish what's necessary to the well-being of the home and all that is needed to provide the haven for the woman and children that's what a man is but abram says he wants men that's got backbone not a wishbone a man but if we add in a little bit you can be all that it's fine but if you're not a man that your principles are said in the word of god you're no man at all you're no man at all because your principles and your conviction need to be founded in the truth god's word and that's a true man when you're founded and so a christian man is the is a man of the word who knows the truth has convictions about the truth and their non-negotiable non-compromising convictions and because of those he's courageous to confront anything that assaults it this is a man amen and he has a strength to withstand the confrontation that's manliness but abraham says and you men they'll let your wife do a thing like that smoke cigarettes i got a little i got a little respect for you you know a man's the head of the house as long as he takes his place as long as he takes his place that's the place a man should be head of the house i'd like to see a man a man he says a man's not judged by how his muscles he got that's beast a man's not judged by the brawny muscles but he's judged by the bags in his knees of his pants where he's been praying that's what takes a man i can tell you brothers you might not this takes courage to stand like that kind of man to live that kind of man's life i'm just speaking courage today to live a godly example of what a man is today [Music] because you are getting force fed whether it's on a bus stop or an advertisement on your phone or something like that something totally different than that totally different some weakness perverted thing that's a man that's what god wants a conviction deep in our heart and soul i said let's raise up and make sure men of god that's exactly where we stand a man is character not beast but abram says but character i've seen man that's weighed 200 pounds not an ounce of man in them amen character nothing to do with your size and shape it has everything to do what's inside head of your home even as christ is the head coming from scripture listen here the man is a ruler don't you think he'll rule you'll rule the house you're not the ruler of the house you're absolutely says you're not a slave now he's speaking to about the women he says but you're a hell mate the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible solely for his wife god makes the man answer for his wife that's what he says ephesians wives submit yourselves to your husbands eyes unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church there and he is a savior of the body therefore the church is subject unto christ so let wives be to their own husbands in every thing scripture lays it out men take your position as head of your home amen as christ is head of the church amen how christ leads the church not with a brute fist not with an iron club so does man of god that are courageous stand and lead a home as head as christ leads the church govern the home and is responsible you know that a man is doubly better brown said he's guilty of double when he lets his wife do something out of order he says and by the way a man that let his wife do that he's guilty of double because he's supposed to be the one that has the say-so in the house heavy responsibility men fathers husbands young men to be fathers if the lord would tarry this on your shoulders that's why you want to be a god-filled courageous man of god because you're going to stand responsible for everything your wife and family does that's a heavy responsibility man i know you probably didn't expect this tonight likewise the husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor respect reverence and esteem is what that honor means honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being heirs together of grace of life that your prayers be not hindered my there's a connection there brothers with how you actually treat your wife giving honor unto her as the weaker vessel and being heirs together in the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered all turmoil and whatever in the home and you're not treating each other well and then you're thinking you're going to go to pray and have everything answered i think we maybe get the home in order first and then you go to prayer when there's love and unity in that home amen and you claim to be he says the son of god where's your principles if the woman ain't out of her place is out of her place aren't you a son of god the one that's and you're the one that's higher or stronger vessel as the bible says then you show yourself a man of god tell her he says sister you're wrong that's right i've done it another christian has done it and you'll always do it as long as you're a christian but show yourself you're a son of god you're having you'll have you have to have more power over yourself than the woman does if she's weaker recognize her to be that understand her mistakes and things and try to correct her sister we're christians we shouldn't do that be a real man a son of god and watch the woman that's your place men manliness courage and a courageous man is going to stand on truth on the word of god that's scripture and this message you don't be quiet can't be quiet these are our homes because if our homes are out of order then i would ask how is your prayers going if that home is out of order because here your prayer can be hindered when you're home giving don't giving the right honor in your home and not having having a fresh unity in your home god help us now to always be right online honor and respect your wife good woman is a jewel in a man's crown she should be honored but abram said amen he says but if they can respect what god made them a motherhood a real queen she's one of the best things god give a man was a wife besides salvation she's the best thing if she's a good wife my she's not there's other things scripture says about that but if you've got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest lord help us lord forgive us all of us brothers that have wives and brothers that are going to have wives respect her with the highest because god esteems her right next to salvation we provide for her scripture says for a no man ever hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church amen but abraham says now if a man is sick he can't work and so forth he goes but if she's going out to work just to have a little extra money he says you better keep her away from that scallywag bunch is what he says he says her place there's in the home but he said he goes and mister you might call yourself ever so good but you've got lodges and other things that calls you away from her at night you ought to be ashamed of yourself god gave you a home to cherish and comfort and things like that he says it's a shame to see the way a man does their wives and wives do men womanhood fatherhood the nation is tore to pieces this is a prophet speaking to a nation saying lord i'm just saying to in our as a man as a courageous man of god his brothers our home that our scripture says to cherish and nourish and brother brahms talking about just going out and hey i got to go with the boys out here i got to do this right here i'll be out there later tonight and going one way and a wife going the other way that's wrong that's going to break your home down you be a man's man you you brought you took her to your side she's your help mate and you bring her close to you you nourish her you cherish her you build your home up in the admission of christ not going one way the other and that's what brother branham's talking about men of courage you're a protector daddy's husbands you're a protector sometimes brother brown says i preach pretty rough i see somebody getting out of line you see you're supposed to do that a real daddy will why he'd shake you and say here get back in line he's a real true father because he's a watchman of the home don't just let things go by daddies be like oh something just yeah well let's go let her go no you're a watchman watch me looking in the home saying ah something's coming into my home i'm gonna deal with that right there lord give me wisdom and discernment someone's trying to enter my home right here you're a watchman to protect your home sometimes your pastor has to weigh down something just love him that much more because he's a real father to you so what he's saying trying to keep you lined up my amen these are this is these are just aspects of scripture skimming through that makes a man a man of god to take care of his home and be a man of courage in this day i can tell you right now it takes a whole heaping load of courage to do all that in your home today it sure does brothers oh my satan's fighting every aspect against it every aspect against it see well my god these are just pretty common scriptures you know we know all this yeah put into action put in actions a whole little different story and you'll find though your home be totally different totally transformed when you as a man take your place as a courageous man of god amen not saying you're not i'm just saying you know tighten up the belt lord wherever we may be that's who i am you say i'm doing that i'm a courageous man of god now sisters don't think for a moment you're like well i'm not courageous like that i don't you know i'm not strong and mighty uh-huh well i'm just a lady i'm just this daughter of god i'm not bold you know i'm not to be like a protector like a man how can i be courageous well you know the scripture says who can find you know that word virtuous it's actually the hebrew word there is the same word valor and strength actually army and battle that's where that word actually it's called actually called kail in hebrew and it's strength of mind well it means valor virtue and strength strength of mind and spirit that enables a person to encounter danger and firmness great courage in face of danger the qualities of a hero or heroine exceptional or heroic courage let me just go back there sorry it's speaking of a woman who can find a virtuous a woman that has valor that has virtue that has strength that is courageous like a heroine yes you can be a courageous woman in this day you're in the battle too this ain't just the brothers battle you're fighting as well you're fighting as well you're in the battle and my oh my if the brothers are under attack so are you big time big time to tear everything that god has put into a woman to the ground you're you're in battle perverted the whole whole woman is being perverted her role everything and i'd be careful as we've talked about truth what you're following what social media trend you're following what's influencing you to do a certain certain dress or a certain you know uh way you handle yourself or the way you communicate or what you're saying and what you're doing i'd be careful what truth you're following because it's taking away from who god has made you to be and gonna tear down from that virtuous woman of who you should be amen now just briefly david had brother bram says he had many wives and he's speaking he's speaking and choosing of a bride he's showing the type between god he was like the body of believers and is the bride of christ calls it she the woman he was the man christ now we were made for christ christ wasn't made for us we are the bride of christ we were made for him and bradham is typing he goes christ he goes that's what we're trying to do today in our textbooks is try to make the word which is christ suit us well you know and try to make the word make you know suit what i want to do and bend it to our own truth and he's saying that's not how it works we were made for him all right and so he's just saying that's that he goes instead of us trying to make ourselves suit the word that's the difference and so he's speaking about a woman that's made for her husband she's made for him amen but iran says in the time had come for abraham he says my got to decide i need a wife for my son isaac and he waited 25 years and he received him from the dead know that he was called and he said there was a time when he had to make the decision who would be his helpmate and here's what he said next for you sisters to carry on the plan of god you are a helpmate to carry on the plan of god in that son of god's world that's who you are this is no substandard position i don't do this that's it's the world that's trying to make men men high and women low or women high men low and all this garbage but god has put her beside of you man to be a help me to carry on the plan of god there ain't no lower aspect there that is right beside him as a help vessel so that he can actually get to the end without you he can't do it you're there to help and make the plan of god come to fruition not second rate and neither are you treated as such you're to help your husband and carry that plan of god amen just as christ bride must express and carry on his works he through us so that we can express him and fulfill his purpose here on earth that's exactly the spiritual type of the natural amen later brandon says my says i guess your sweetheart came to you speaking to your brother i feel i know you feel that way about her she's still your sweetheart and that's the way i know we all us christians feel about our wives or our sweethearts i hope that never changes in my family and never changes in your family that we can always feel that way after all they stand side by side with us to help us fight these battles so who's fighting together together men of courage and women of courage amen it's just about knowing your position and knowing where you need to be because in position you're a unified mighty army out of position ain't gonna work out you'll be constantly under battle and defeated amen pure chaste modest meek quiet spirit first peter says wow they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear this is a sister it continues on be let it be but let it be hidden the hidden man of the heart the inner realm the soul realm in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price brother branham says oh i hate he goes oh he goes i hate the word he's talking about an actor he says some sisters do the same thing he goes a lot of acting oh they'll cut their husband's nose off with john why did you do that just as snappy as can be i'm just copying with brother branham exactly why didn't you do this why do you do that what is this what is that it just thumbs up some step and then he says you know the phone rings hello how are you doing so better brandon does he says oh my he says actors shame on you women of courage that's not to be amen our homes that's not a strong home amen but this is just a little bit of bringing ourselves back in line if i want me to read the quote he says house angels and road devils that's what he says he says just be yourself all the time amen meek quiet humble amen contrite spirit amen motherhood she's a keeper of the home she's feminine she's in the beauty of holiness and god made you to be feminine embrace it he made you that way and man he made you to be want to be pretty and a lady and all this garbage outside is trying to tear that away from you but god made you that way my you know like the rest of the guys that want me burly or something that you're not that and don't be that you know the scripture says though as you just read this woman who can find if we just put it there that should tell you that this is actually a very rare person who can find we're trying to search her out where is this person i can tell in 7 billion there's very few but a courageous woman of god that's where you'll find her you'll find her in the body of christ young man don't you go out there looking at who knows who you look at this body of christ because she's a woman of courage that's upholding the word of god and you want a home with that young lady at your side you're looking outside looking for some floozy whatnot on social media and all whatever 80 000 pictures before she put the perfect one on no you look for a young lady wholesome holy ghost filled and she'll lead your home all the way to rapture who can find a virtuous woman for a priceless farb of rubies and the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that she'll have no need of spoil it is quite a scripture and i won't go through all of proverbs 31 she opened with her mouth with wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness my she looketh well into the ways of her household and eat us not the bread of idleness she's a doer if you read proverbs 31 sisters that woman of virtue she's quite a mighty woman of valor she's industrious she's a keeper of her home doesn't mean you sit there in two little thumbs there's a lot of doing a home it's a woman of virtue a woman of courage and her her children arise up and call her blessed and her husband also and he praises her what a woman this is this is you women of courage woman of valor like ruth who is willing to let it all go and turn her back that same word kail is used with ruth boaz says and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all thou requires for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman that's the same word a woman of valor and strength a woman of courage that's what boaz was seeing in ruth that's what you young men would want to see in a young woman as boaz saw in ruth you are a woman of virtue you're a woman of valor why she had something deepened down i mean he had known what she had done she had left it all behind ruth had put it on the ground she had showed who she was hey man she was tried and true and tested my she said lord your god be my god i'm gonna if i if you where you die i'm gonna die i'm gonna be buried where you buried she was a woman of courage i could tell you that amen that's who you want to be like sisters i was looking at the scripture i was thinking a woman of courage my goodness and i came across my mind came across jl i think well now that's a woman of courage yes my goodness you know though i just i was thinking about it and here she was hearing the battle uh you know bear with me here she was just in hearing obviously the battle shoes from the kenites and israel they were if you go in the history of it she was you know they were kind of aligned with israel and it doesn't really say exactly you know if they serve the god but here she was outside of her tent and uh and jabin and hazor and and says sisera they were together and and so there was some cesaro basically felt that they were you know allies more or less so this is why he went to her tent he was running away because he was the last man standing in a battle where that he lost and so caesar is running running through the hills as fast as he can to escape and he comes across jl's tent and then here she is obviously outside and maybe she's looking maybe there's some israelites or something she can help i don't know why she's out there but she's looking for see what's going on because obviously she knew battle was happening and here he comes running up to her tent now this is a woman of courage this is a woman of courage and here she brings him into into her tent and feigns like everything's all well and fine who come into the tent and she gives him his his drink of milk uh instead of water and he lays down and she covers them with this with this with a mantle and here she was and now i just i was pondering this i said my goodness here she was oh pretty much luring the enemy into her household and saying all right i know exactly who you are you haven't you haven't you know fooled me and this is a woman of courage this is like a husband that is looking out for his home as a protector so does the mama so does a wife be looking out in her home saying that what's happening with johnny here susie and she could see okay i see where you're coming just she just gets to everything set up and figure them out get them all in the corner and there she goes gets them all set down and here was her enemy now now it's time to take courage and she takes a nail on a hammer and drives him through the brains and nails them to the floor that's some serious courage come on saints put yourself there dear goodness that was that took some serious nerve to do that but i tell you sisters that's the same nerve that god gives you he gives you that same courage you take it in your home and drive the nail through some demon that's trying to enter your home you'll be in jail you take god at his word that's exactly what you do don't be fooled you say all right i know where you're coming i can see what you're trying to do try to influence my daughter here and then take the word of god and nail him to the ground actually the scripture next says she nailed him and then she cut his head off yeah so she made sure like she needed to but she did my she needed some divine power to do that and so will you need divine courage to do what you need to do to take the enemy out amen oh i just can't i just can't even imagine that moment what if her hand shook her you know like so many things could have gone wrong so many things go wrong that's why you need discernment when you're dealing with this situation you say my so many things could go wrong what if i say the wrong thing here oh god help me say the right word help me help me say it in love and help me say that because so many things could spin off and cause some some bad reaction that's the natural that's the spiritual but she did it effectually amen sisters satan's out to destroy true womanhood true motherhood nail her to the ground him to the ground amen and let truth march on my right we'll close up here courage it's not usually although what you always think as we've been saying you know we think this daring and brash boldness and such but you know brother branham says peter had a sword and he was going to cut the high priest's ear off but you know he goes when it come to real christian courage he didn't have it that's his words you're like peter didn't have real christian courage that's what dr branham said so don't get mad at me here he had a sword he backed up and denied him he cut the priest's ear off with his sword sure he knowed how to handle it but when it come to the squeeze and the time to stand on the word of god he didn't have the courage and even denied he'd know jesus oh when it came down to the squeeze where are we at saints of god when it come down to a squeeze to stand on the word of god he didn't have the courage my goodness he goes that's where it is today we got courage to build things and put millions of dollars here courage to put pipe organs and plush seats everything go out proselyte from place to place make a methodist come back and so forth back and forth like this but when it comes to christian courage accept the word the message of god and stand there on it we are few this is brother branham catch it but when it comes to christian courage accept the word the message of god and stand there on it it had nothing to do peter actually was trying to cut off an ear and protecting that action brother brown says that wasn't courage at all but it was recognizing the word being manifest in his day and standing there on it he ran away and denied it what uh what do we see as over these many years you say people go out oh but they were they once stood there cut it off no no but when the really when it came down to it they actually missed the manifestation of the word in our day that's true courage when it come down to real down inside of him courage he didn't have it speaking of peter still no he didn't have it when he seen the word now i'm going to get religious he said when he had seen that word made manifest and knowed that that was the day for it to be there and seen it proved exactly hello saints has that happened again in this day let's just put it to now and it proved exactly what god said it would do and then with all this intellectual strength with all his physical being and he just lets that trail off he goes that's the way it is today men who just walk up put their name on a book shake hands with the minister and when it comes to standing in the office and the boss passes a drink oh they'll take it because they're afraid of their job now it gets down into our everyday living the courage to stand on the word of god and here now he's just speaking about maybe maybe not really showing exactly having courage to stand on god's word and show that you are of a of a christian and god's field in your heart he's saying they're at work you know and he goes it comes to paying your tithe in church you're afraid to do it because you're afraid to starve to death even though god promised you to take care of you because all these things when you come to church and the holy spirit falls amongst the people and something in your heart says this is it that's the word he says when you see the baptism and everything brought out of the word and you're afraid to take it what's the matter he says you're lacking courage you're lacking spiritual courage to stand up that's real courage that's real courage is when you can see god moving and the word moving amongst us and you can say hey that's it that's the word but you're not able to actually step forward and take it he says that's lacking courage lord fill our hearts someone may be on that little edge there seeing god move seeing the testimonies of of god moving here brother mike and sister debbie the testimony just thrilled my heart to hear god move because i prayed i said oh god i'm expecting a testimony of see what you've done we put out many prayers and we're believing i'm expecting to hear tonight something you do in amongst us and brother mike and sister debbie's testimony came in the back room and said that's our god amen and that's the courage to actually say god's moving in our midst and that's that's what i want to stand for god give you courage amen true blue courage recognize the word as truth and stand up for it that's courage amen man brother daniel i just heard your amen good to see you you thought we would forgot that amen not happening god bless you amen as we close here brother braham says put the pull put the whole armor of god he says a believer on christ followed him hour by hour but he'd only seen the word by letter now he's taught this is now taking this quote of peter saying he didn't have courage didn't see the word when he saw the word manifest he'd and he didn't and he denied it but brother he says brother after pentecost after when god came down and filled his soul after something happened after they tarried and they waited day one day two day three day seven day nine day ten after that time he says oh my a believer on christ followed him by hour by hour but he'd only seen the word by letter then he'd only seen it manifested but now it was in him now it was in him it wasn't just before him watching it happen but something happened when the new birth strikes your soul and the power of god falls in now it's inside you amen he said the word of god fiery word burning his own flesh amen you didn't have to worry about whether you had courage or not because when the moment came and they busted out them doors you bet peter had courage all with the them 11 and he started preaching forth the gospel and here we stand on acts 2 38 because of his sermon that he came because god did something my goodness a denier at one time but a spiritual man of courage after god got a hold of his heart amen yes sir when it comes to part of you something changes something changes i'm going to close here because if i don't i'll keep a few more pages so musicians why don't you come now you know it takes courage to accept christ it takes courage to accept christ i wonder how many have right been on that edge over the many many years and just couldn't couldn't make that step and as butterburn says they see it and they see the word manifest but they can't come into an experience and stand for and say god that's what i want and then be like a peter who's now burning from the inside out he says brother brown says well he says would there be in this divine presence some sinner that would say i want to love him brother branham truly i do i've always wanted to i wish i had the courage tonight to receive him as my savior he says wouldn't you raise your hand he says another quote he goes oh he goes it took courage to raise that hand my he said lord he says god be merciful to me say as you raise your hand i believe i believe the holy spirit led me god bless you sir that might have took a lot of courage to do that but it's the greatest thing you ever done i don't know where i don't know where this is just a little bit of a wrap up service on truth and the courage to stand for it but i'm praying tonight i've just been so burdened in my heart just seeing what god has what god has been doing amongst the people whether it be in charging our faith to for healing for the needs in our body or whether it just be to see just people growing cool and falling away or whichever he said lord would you just instill a new found level of spiritual courage that we could stay in our places our women will be women our men will be men of god and we'll stand and accept the word for this day and we are not going to step out of that and we're going to take you at your word and if there's some little prick in your heart lord would be drop courage into your heart you say lord i want that and if it just takes a little sometimes it just takes a little push to really just to step over that little edge and say lord i need you i want give me the courage tonight just to say lord i want you as my savior i want you as my savior you know i was i pondered that as we just close and you can have all sometimes the hardest thing to do is to wait and i thought i had just the next little part was the courage to wait because scripture says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength and sometimes we're waiting in this time as god has moved and he's dealt and you've anchored some faith down and you've made a move and you're just waiting and you're sitting that time and it's hard to wait humans don't like to wait saying lord i'm needing you i i've put something out there and i've prayed for it and i said lord give us courage now to wait as you wait on him and you know we people they have a hard time waiting because it's unknown something's known in the future and so they get unsettled but we are not in an unknown the promise has been given we know what the we know what the promise says that you believed on whether it's healing whether it's a son or daughter whether whatever the need is the promise is true we went through that and this is the word is true and so there's no unknown so in our waiting we can be settled and we wait on him and we keep our eyes focused on him not on the circumstance and so therefore then our faith actually as the scripture says they that wait on the lord shall renew their strength and so your strength and your courage in that time doesn't actually wane it doesn't actually diminish as you're like well lord i'm waiting it actually gets renewed every day as you wait on him as you pray as you seek his face as as you lay it at his feet say lord i'm trusting in you and so as you wait on him your strength is renewed daily amen that's what the scripture says they shall mount up with wings as he goes they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint but it's they that wait upon the lord renews their courage it renews that strength within them and so lord as we are in these times as the lord has been moving and we've been putting our hands on what god is saying maybe an anchor a promise or something that you've done you just said lord that's for me i laid it down on that service there i put a stake down there on that service there i say have courage and now wait have courage and wait on him because in his time it will come to pass amen let's stand i was thinking of a in battle when they would put the line and they'd have a lineup of battle and you'd be on the front lines and the the soldiers would be coming at you and then the general would be saying just wait just hold you'd be more like yelling it hold just just there was a moment when there was a go time there's a moment the right moment for the strategy to come to full effect for for exactly what the general wanted to happen and so he's just saying wait hold and you could be in there and you're just like the enemy's coming right at you it's almost like he's breathing on you and he's saying just hold it's when he says and when he says go then the army let loose and then then the victory or the battle was engaged wait for his time wait for his go god sets that in your heart he's got the exact timing and maybe it just might be a little maybe it's just now you feel like you're just in that hole there's a general saying just hold just wait say lord give me the courage to hold that line as i see the enemy coming but i'm holding my line i ain't moving i ain't stepping aside ain't getting all jittery i don't know what's going on here no just hold the line he knows what's going on stay in position we don't need ranks to be um i'm scared what's going on if this person goes off that person hold the line have courage as you wait he's the general we're just standing there frontlining ready with our armor ready for that moment because when he says go go then we'll then we'll engage in battle and the victor will be one because he's the general not any of us amen i want to sing tonight fourth man in the fire so you're gonna have to help me so you're gonna have to find another drummer amen it took courage to stand there that's fourth there's three men i i enjoy getting into the picture i enjoy getting in the picture as what it felt like as you were getting if you were getting holed up as you stood with courage saying in a bow i ain't going to bend but they were ready to burn they were ready to burn that's courage that's godly courage i went into the martyrs different ones two little ladies oh my goodness god give us courage like that and they stood one one sister excuse me she was giving birth she had she was eight months pregnant and she was travailing not in birth but because if they delayed her martyrdom because she was pregnant and they she wouldn't get to give her life with the rest of the saints she was with and she was anguished that she was going to be delayed in giving her life because of the baby she still they wouldn't execute at this time a pregnant sister and she prayed and she gave birth within the next day or so and the baby was taken and she went and gave her life brutally with the saints that's courage god's here she was saying i'd oh god i want to give my life with the saints that i've been with that i've upheld before you the true gospel i will just just make a sacrifice to the emperor just want to bring in their parents they bring in their daddies they bring in their their family just please don't do this what just just one little sacrifice here and it'll all be gone and you can leave just one little thing it takes courage another realm of courage when you're in that realm in that aspect god when you're like peter who had the fire of god burning inside of you it will be there don't worry about it don't i just worry about lord i'm standing on truth i'm standing on your word that when when you called and beckoned my heart my hand went up in the air i laid my life down on the altar i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and when the moment comes as the songwriter penned down when that moment comes and you might need to step into the fire it don't matter because the courage you need is there amen it's already inside of you don't be wondering and oh man am i going to do it you will and you are you're standing right now the moment matters what matters most is that you're standing in truth when that time comes amen let's sing that song [Music] there's nothing to be done my accuser stand before me and there's nowhere left to run so it is there's nothing more to say i will pay the price for the joys that [Music] is [Music] is [Music] me just [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh is disney i saw is [Music] bye [Music] the fire [Music] yes he fights me in my [Music] [Applause] he is [Music] he saved me just in time no i hallelujah oh my what a moment that would have been as they all stepped into that fiery flame god he said he waited brother branham said god waits he waits and he waited just until they went right into that fiery furnace and boom he was on the scene amen he just wait sometimes you're like oh god i am literally in the flames right now i'm tipping over and i'm feeling the heat and boom there he's there and then he waits have courage saints wait a little bit renew your strength in the lord because at the moment that you need him the most that's when he's there daniel was in the lion's den god waited and he waited and he waited and daniel's being lowered down he waited i can imagine lions roaring and at the moment boom the pillar of fire was in there and it was all quiet why the fourth man was on the scene they had courage to stand until and god showed up amen have courage saints until and god will show up i gotta sing that again i saw the fourth man [Music] just oh hallelujah heavenly father i am so thankful that we have a fourth man lord they weren't left all alone those hebrew boys as they stood on what they knew to be truth lord they were anchored firm on what you had what they had been taught what their fathers and their mothers had taught them lord as those those princes of israel had been brought into into captivity and lord they were in a foreign land they're in a wicked place but lord they had mamas and dadas daddies that could show them the true way of god that prayed with them that showed them scripture so that in the time of need when they were in that fiery furnace situation they knew a god that answered their prayer so they weren't they were scared they didn't have a worry they stood courageous oh god but they knew there was a god that could meet them in the furnace but yet they said if you did not we still won't bend lord they left it in your hands they didn't hold you to it but they said whatever our god wants to do we'll serve him anyhow lord may that be the courage in our hearts tonight lord as we leave this little church service then our courage would be renewed for lord the battle for truth rages but we'll stand sure on the word of god and lord will fulfill the position as we've heard over these last weeks the purpose that you have for us to fulfill with courage and standing so god i commit this little group of people lord to you and if anybody lord lord is on that little edge then he said oh god i want to have the courage i really want to have the courage to serve you i just need lord that courage to put up my hand may they do so tonight lord you see the hand if it goes up i'm not even looking but lord may you give them courage tonight to lift up that hand in a supernatural act and lord in a moment you can save their heart and fill them with the fire of god like you did peter we believe lord jesus that's the services that we believe for that you change hearts you deliver souls lord we didn't believe for that lord we're just men most miserable but we believe a god that can move amongst us and is doing mighty works as you prepare us for a homecoming rapture so god we give ourselves to you lead us this week i pray take your people in your hands in jesus christ's name amen can we sing one more song i want to sing the battle as the lord's i'm so thankful for a holy ghost-filled songwriter i remember ryan you're probably hearing me so i'm glad i'm thankful for it and happy that brother andrew is here to help me sing it here let's sing
