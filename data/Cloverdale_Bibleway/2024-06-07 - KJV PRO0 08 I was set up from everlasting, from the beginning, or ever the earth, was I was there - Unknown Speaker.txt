TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning wherever the Earth was when there were no depths I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face to the depth when he established the clouds above when he strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men
