[0:00] and while the Pharisees were gathered
[0:03] together Jesus asked them saying what
[0:06] think ye of Christ who son is he and
[0:09] they said unto him the son of David and
[0:12] he said unto them how then does David in
[0:15] spirit call him Lord saying the Lord
[0:19] said unto my Lord set thou on my right
[0:21] hand till I make thine enemies thy
[0:24] footstool if David then call him Lord
[0:29] how is he his son and no man was able to
[0:34] answer him a word neither do any man
[0:38] from that day forth asked him any more
[0:43] questions may he add His blessings to
[0:45] that word and now for a few moments I'd
[0:49] like to take this if you'd call it a
[0:51] text um what than ye of Christ had you
[0:55] seen all these meetings and everything
[0:57] what do you think of Christ whose son is
[0:59] he
[1:00] that's been a an old dispute Through the
[1:03] Ages through the scientists and through
[1:06] the the evolutionists and so forth what
[1:09] was Christ who was he and and it's just
[1:12] as simple as the question is which was
[1:15] first the hen of the egg you've heard
[1:17] that what the hen come from the egg and
[1:19] which is first hen of egg well the hen
[1:21] was God made the hen the hen laid the
[1:23] egg now that's the same thing about the
[1:26] scientific research of the bloodstream
[1:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:31] Christ was the Virgin born son of God
[1:34] see and a scientist once told me not
[1:37] speaking science because my brother's
[1:38] here but there was a scientist once went
[1:41] hunting with me out in the west and I
[1:44] met him and he was about to roughest
[1:46] fell I ever seen he said do you mean to
[1:48] tell me when I told him I was the
[1:49] preacher he said you look too
[1:51] intelligent to be there and I said well
[1:54] um I said well not disputing your words
[1:57] sir but I believe that's the mark of
[1:58] intelligence me said he said well
[2:01] anybody would believe such a story as
[2:03] that and I said well what do you mean he
[2:06] said well such as that virgin birth he
[2:09] said you you know you know better than
[2:11] that I said no sir I'll admit I don't
[2:12] know any better I said that's that's
[2:14] just all I know and he said well you
[2:17] mean to tell me that woman could have a
[2:18] baby without being so that was Joseph
[2:21] that man that she was going with is a
[2:23] little slip up like we have all time I
[2:25] said oh no God makes no slip ups that
[2:28] was absolutely God Son he said well
[2:30] there is no such a thing I said do you
[2:32] mean there's not a Creator who made the
[2:34] heavens and earth he said no of course
[2:36] not he said oh it's psychology I said
[2:39] well how'd the world get here said it
[2:40] was here when I come here I said yes
[2:43] that's right in the room you was born in
[2:46] was there when you got there and the
[2:47] furniture was arranged but some
[2:48] intelligent had to arrange it that way
[2:50] that's exact why it would be silly so I
[2:54] say well how'd that watch come well it's
[2:57] just a watch that's all it just happened
[2:59] to be a watch
[3:00] well now the timing the jewels and
[3:03] everything anybody was with mentally
[3:05] balanced right would know that some
[3:07] intelligent made that watch had to time
[3:09] it and regulate it and put the hands and
[3:10] jewels and the operations well then how
[3:13] much greater is your body than this
[3:15] watch see because it was a man that made
[3:18] this watch and somebody had to make the
[3:20] man so a person says that we just happen
[3:23] to be that shows there's a mental
[3:25] deficiency somewhere that's right so he
[3:28] said well now you begin to tell me the
[3:30] ethics of Darwin and so forth about how
[3:32] Evolution came into existence how the
[3:35] world and the Sun and the Moon you've
[3:36] read it perhaps Had A Love Affair and
[3:38] chipped off a little piece and flew off
[3:40] and that made the world and the first
[3:41] man was a sponge and he wore a little
[3:43] Ward on this side and Out Come an arm
[3:45] and then he decided he want a little arm
[3:47] on the other side so it rolled a few
[3:48] thousand years over on that side another
[3:50] Arm come
[3:51] out I said look
[3:53] fell I'm kind of weak and Fai I said I I
[3:57] don't believe that I can't believe it I
[3:58] said I just be wa God said it was I said
[4:01] the only way you can prove that by faith
[4:03] you can't prove it any other way I said
[4:05] my Faith's too weak for that I said I
[4:07] just I haven't got that much faith I
[4:09] just believe that God made it way he
[4:10] said he did and he said I said he said
[4:14] all about the Virgin bir he said it's
[4:16] it's proven Reverend Brown that that
[4:18] corn everything else has to have a poen
[4:21] the poins and the corn and for the trees
[4:24] and the how the bees pack it and
[4:25] everything has to have actual male and
[4:28] female I said sure it was a male in this
[4:30] respect I said that was God well is God
[4:33] a man I said God's the spirit oh
[4:35] impossible to contact the actual human
[4:37] being it has to be the sex part I said
[4:40] oh no I said now look you will admit to
[4:43] me will you that the woman had the baby
[4:46] we'll say that that was right the woman
[4:47] had the baby and he was Jesus yes that
[4:49] that I'll go with you that part because
[4:51] there's some kind of a something going
[4:53] on through the world and to come down
[4:55] history and so forth that there was one
[4:56] here called Jesus but he was no virgin
[4:58] born I said then we'll admit that he had
[5:01] a natural mother yes now he in your
[5:03] estimation he' have to have an a actual
[5:07] father a Earthly man here to be his
[5:09] father or he could not have been born he
[5:12] said that's exactly right I said will
[5:13] you stick with that Mr je he said I will
[5:16] I said all right I want to ask you
[5:18] something then if if this woman had the
[5:22] baby and you said it was impossible it
[5:25] had to have a natural father it had to
[5:27] have an Earthly father as same as it had
[5:29] Earth mother said that's exactly truth I
[5:32] said then how did the first man get here
[5:34] without father or
[5:36] mother or did he come from let he be
[5:38] tadp monkey whatever he want to be
[5:41] according to science he had to have a
[5:43] father and a mother is that right I said
[5:45] who was his father and
[5:48] mother well he asked no more questions
[5:51] from that time saying just settled it
[5:54] their argument is thinner than the broth
[5:57] made out of a shadow of a chicken is
[5:59] star today they haven't got a leg to
[6:02] stand on no sir Jesus Christ was the son
[6:05] of God
