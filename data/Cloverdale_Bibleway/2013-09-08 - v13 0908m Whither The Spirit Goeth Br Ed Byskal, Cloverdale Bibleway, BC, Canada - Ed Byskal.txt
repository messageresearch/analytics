We thank you for healing in the cup this morning. We thank you for the body of Jesus Christ, Lord. That we could be knitly joined together this morning in love. Lord, that which you have put together, let no man put us under. Lord, we claim that this morning, Lord. We stand here as a group of people, Lord, that have been birthed into the kingdom of God, Lord, that you have put together. We stand determined this morning, Lord, that no man can put us aunderder.

Doesn't it feel good to be a Christian this morning? &gt;&gt; Doesn't it feel good to know that you serve a risen savior? &gt;&gt; He's not just in the world today, but he's living &gt;&gt; in you and me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's something to be excited about, friends. Lord, you can get pumped up about anything, but God can give you a real revelation by the stimulation of his Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; that can do something for you. Amen. We love you this morning with a great love. Not as much as God loves you. I trust you can receive that in your hearts today. God loves you so very, very much. He sent his own son. How many fathers do we have here this morning? Really, that's it. A real father loves his son so much. [Music] and he gave himself for you and for me. I have brother Tim come this morning. Pray over the request this morning. Amen. We just ask that the Lord would come and do something so supernatural that you can't miss it. &gt;&gt; He's done it so many so many times. We have thousands of tapes and we can't miss it. But he said one more time. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll come and show himself to us this morning. If we would gather together in his name, he'd be found in our midst. Want to remember a prayer request. Steven Laura Martin, their 5-year-old son, just drowned. It's brother Merl, Earl Martin's grandson. Remember that request this morning, asking for prayer for brother Henry Hayes, Ryan, Brother Ryan's uncle, undergoing chemo radiation. He's been told it would uh damage his hearing and functions and glands. Praying that the Lord would bring him through this process. Rekindle the fire within him. Amen. That's from the Hayes family. Want to remember brother Bus in Ethiopia. I'm sure something else will be said, but he's texted in a request. Just remember them in prayer. Hold them up in prayer. When God is moving, so does the enemy. Amen. And God is moving in Ethiopia. So, we want to remember those requests this morning. If you don't have a request on your heart, thank him. Just thank him this morning. He's done so very much for us. We want to give him thanks, Brother Tim. Amen. Let's let's bow our heads in a word of prayer. [Music] Wonderful redeemer, you are the lover of our souls, as we are standing here in your presence, we have arisen as worshippers before the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords to acknowledge and glorify your holy name. For you are worthy of all praise, all adoration. All of our love is poured out before you, oh God. We love you with all that we are. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, that we sense and feel and we and you are a God that can be felt, but we believe that you love us, oh God. And we're so thankful, Lord, that it wasn't some good thing that made you love us. You always loved us. We were in your mind before the foundation of the world. You were mindful of us this morning. And because of that, Lord, it wasn't something, Lord, that we could ever do that would make you unlove us. Oh God, thank you for your grace. So God, thank you for your mercies. As we come into your presence, we want all things to be under the blood. Lord, if there be any trespasses, if there be any any shortcomings this morning, let it be under the blood this morning. Oh God, we want to come into your presence unhindered. We want you to have your way without reservation. We want the spirit of God to move in power and in demonstration this morning as our pastor comes to the sacred desk. We just asking Lord for a special portion. Lord, you're here. We're here. We just believe that the supernatural shall take place and even now is taking place. If there's any needs in the congregation, Lord, may you meet them even now as they hold it before you, Lord. Lord, may your word answer every question. I was reading in your prophet's message this morning where he said, "Everyone that really believes is healed." &gt;&gt; Lord, may you grant faith &gt;&gt; that everyone that is sick this morning, there's no need that they would go from this place sick. Oh God, may healing be poured into every life. Oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, we remember this man that's undergoing chemotherapy. Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. May you deliver him from the cancer. And Lord, may you give him the victory, not only naturally, but Father, may you spiritually come to his life. I don't know where he's at spiritually, but may you be his savior, his redeemer, and his Lord. And Father, be with Brother Basobosi in in Africa, oh God, in Ethiopia. They're gathering today. Lord, may the new believers be quickened by your word. Oh God, may the ministers be inspired. Lord, may the word go forth in power and in demonstration, even quickening your elect in that country. We thank you for the open door. We give you praise. We thank you for stretching forth your hand to touch your bride there. And Lord, we heard of a family this morning that lost a little child. Some things, Father, in life are just hard to understand. But Lord, our prayers, our hearts go out to that family. May you, the everpresent one who is our comfort, be their comfort this morning, oh God. Lord, may you meet the need. Comfort the mother, the dad, oh God. Lord, may there be something said or done. May there be a presence just come into their midst that Lord they'll know that you've got everything under control and all things happen for a purpose and out of them all you work something good and Lord we commit them into your hands asking your blessing now upon the service upon the ministry of the word upon the remainder of the song service for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen yes if we can have the deacons come prepare to receive the morning offering. We just pray over that as they after they come. We're going to have a baby dedication this morning. Praise the Lord. Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena are going to have their little one dedicated. Why don't we sing as the deacons are coming getting ready? Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Has he been faithful to you? Amen. Great is thy faithfulness, [Music] oh God, my father. There is no shadow of turning with thee. Thou changest not. Thy compassions they fail not. As thou hast been, thou forever will be. Let's bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, we commit this offering to you this morning, Lord. the tithes that'll be placed from the hearts, Lord, of the brethren, Lord, that have labored by their hand even this week, even yesterday. Father, we pray that you would multiply it, Lord, that it would go forth and be used for the purpose in which you desire it. Lord, may souls be one to your kingdom. May those that need to be empowered be strengthened by it, Father, as they give. We pray that you'd bless them in Jesus' name. Amen. Sing the chorus together. Great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. Morning by morning. Through mercies I see. All I have needed, I am proiding. Great is thy faithfulness, Lord, unto thee. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth only presence to cheer and to guide. [Music] Great for today for tomorrow. Blessings are mine with 10,000 beside. Oh, great is thy faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness. My glory. &gt;&gt; His mercies I see. All I have is I am [Music] great is thy faithfulness Lord to me. God bless you as you have your seats this morning. Brother Ryan's, are you ready? All right. Brother Ryan's got a special for us. [Music] When I first began to walk with the Lord, I did not fully trust him. how he longed for me to understand that I could. So through the valley he led me [Music] afraid as I could be till I felt his loving arms embracing [Music] See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. [Music] He's come through too many times that puts my mind at ease for good. Oh, and I'll stake my very life that he's going to take care of me. I've been through enough to know that he be enough for me. How could I ever doubt a God whose hands hold the universe? And why would I ever question his ability? [Music] There's no place that I can go that he does know the things that trouble me. He's always aware of where I am and what I need. I believe him now. After all these years, he's been so faithful. He's proven to be true. Never more will I doubt or question why. Cuz I've seen him work before and I know what my God can do. See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. [Music] Yes, he's come through too many times that puts my mind at ease for good. and I'll stake my very life that he's going to take care of me. See, I've been through enough to know that he'll be enough for me. Yes, I've been through it enough to know he'll be enough for me. [Music] Amen. And we certainly want to take the opportunity to welcome each and everyone that's visiting this morning. Say God bless you. Those that are on the internet hookup and the telephone hookup, certainly say God bless you as well this morning. We'll invite our pastor to come, brother Ryan, your wife, sister Elena, to come for the baby dedication. Maybe we can sing as they're coming. Jesus loves me. This I know. Amen. Jesus loves me. This I know. For the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. [Music] Amen. Well, we need another part here. And here he is. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Ryan. Sister Yolena. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, Brother Ryan and Sister Yolena uh have not only brought their daughter who they prayed for before they knew it would be a daughter. They prayed that God would give them a child. and and here we are privileged to dedicate the child and I believe there'll be other relatives here and grandparents and we're so thankful to have them here as well to witness this. Uh we're not here just to you know to view and to be participants that way but to be participants and to make your presence felt. &gt;&gt; You know we want this child and all children &gt;&gt; to feel and believe me they are very sensitive to an atmosphere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan and uh sister Elena have named their child Elana. That's first name. Elelliana Jewel. Uh Elelliana is actually feminine for Elijah. It's a Hebrew name and meaning my God has answered &gt;&gt; or my God has answered me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? Every time you call your daughter, you'll be saying, "My God has answered me." I think that'll have quite an impact. You've got all the you got all the preachers saying, "Amen." And uh the second name was Jewel. So I looked up Jewel and I said, "Juel in the English means jewel. Jewel in the French means jewel." &gt;&gt; And Jewel in the American language means jewel. And I thought, well, I'll just keep going till I find something. And finally, in the Latin, it means precious. So, we we have Elelliana. God has answered me with something precious. &gt;&gt; And that is indeed brother Ryan. I I felt that this was uh proper to mention that he said the Lord dropped jewel in his heart as he as a second name during work one day and he confirmed it while I was listening to brother Brandham in the fifth seal and he quotes and brother Brandham says you know they call me a woman hater but I'm not but I just think a good woman is a jewel and then further on he said I think a woman, a nice woman that holds herself right and walks like a lady. She's an example of a jewel of the earth. I like I like anything that's graceful and I think a woman that holds her place and tries to be a lady is a statue of honor. So it's our desire, brother Ryan has continued, that she would grow to be a young woman of virtue and character, a true jewel in God's crown, the Bible says, uh, Sister Yolena and Brother Ryan when it was Hannah who was about to have Samuel and, uh, she said, said, "For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him that was a son." And in this case, you did not know what God would give you. But I know and I had the I had that complete witness when I wrote these words down for this child. You have prayed and God has given you this child &gt;&gt; and he has a purpose in it. And so I would like to say you've asked for this child and God has given you this child. And may she be better to you than seven sons. May she be blessed with the quiet spirit of her mother Yolena. And I'm sure we all agree with that. For the Bible says, "For an ornament, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of God of great price. And may God give her the voice to sing and lift up the spirits of the heavy-hearted brother Ryan. May she be gifted and play skillfully music. &gt;&gt; And I pray that'll be a wonderful combination. &gt;&gt; And we're going to pray that God will bless her. &gt;&gt; Do you think she'll allow me to hold her or face? &gt;&gt; My is she ever decked out? That beautiful. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our head heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, how we thank you that we can hold Jewel. Elelliana jewel. God has answered me. Jewel. Oh God, we thank you for your spirit that makes even these uh these types and these times very precious because you have said that you took them up in your arms and you blessed them and I have taken Eleana up in my arms that I might bless her. Oh God, I am unworthy, Father, to be a servant of yours, but you did it and now we have this honor. I pray that you'll bless both father and mother, our brother Ryan and sister Yelena, and you'll give give them, oh God, such wisdom as they bring her up from day to day. I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that as you have given them given them this child, now they return it to you. And I dedicate this child, Elelliana Jewel, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. and may she ever serve you. Keep her from the uh stains of the world. Keep her from the hurts of the world. Keep her, oh God, in the presence, your presence. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See there, you didn't have to be nervous. God bless you, brother Ryan. God bless you, Elena. Amen. Hallelujah. It's always a pleasure to do that. I wanted to mention also that the service for brother Brad brother Langanger, my brother-in-law, it's uh it's somewhat involved. So, we have simply put it on the notice board. We've enlarged it and put it on the on the bulletin board because there are directions and times and things which you probably wouldn't remember. And uh it's uh they are having a uh viewing in Abbottzford on Tuesday late afternoon evening and then you'll have to get the address for that and then there's an in interament in Murrayville on Wednesday morning I believe at 10:30 11 and then it's followed by uh they're going to have then a memorial service Wednesday afternoon at the Church of Living Word on in Abbottzford. So all of those addresses and times are are on the bulletin board. And I I thought if I even if I read it and gave it out, you wouldn't remember it. So I have given you uh we've put it up there for everyone to to have and then you can write it down. and thank you for your prayers. I received an email from uh Shirley this morning, the eldest daughter, and just thank for the prayers and and uh brother Tony in the in the directions that he always also wanted to thank any anyone and everyone for their prayers and we've certainly been praying for them as a family. Uh it's a wonderful opportunity to be able to pray for someone that perhaps otherwise you might not think of them, you know, but when at a time like this, if we were going through a situation similar, I would appreciate people praying for us. Uh amen. I also need to bring you special greetings and I'll just excuse me. I'll just do this quickly. From brother Ron and Sister Connie Spencer, from Brother Tim and Sister Karen Puit, from Brother Joseph Green and his wife Rexan, from Brother Charlie Spencer and his wife, that's father to uh Brother Ron Spencer. I just want to say one thing about Brother Charlie Spencer. He's a he's not a very visible person. He's not one you hear about often, but he's a man that I greatly, greatly admire. He's a man of incredible faith. When Ron Spencer, brother Ron Spencer, fell out of fourth floor building, landed on the concrete on concrete and was just broken up and crushed and rushed to a hospital. And they called the father and the doctors met the father as he came to the hospital just into the hospital. It's how it happened. I've confirmed it many times. And brother Charlie Spencer came in. The doctors met him and the way it is today doctors don't want you to be under any illusion of what the situation is. They said, "Mr. Spencer, we just want you to know your son will never walk again." And brother Charlie Spencer looked up at the doctor, not in disrespect, but he said, "Sir, you just don't know who you're talking to." Said, "I'm a son of God." &gt;&gt; And he says, "Where's my son?" And he walked in to his son in the emergency behind the curtain and whatever more. And Ron told me this, and brother Spencer told me this, but Ron told it to me several times. He said, "My dad looked at me." He said, "I'll never forget his words." He said, "You are my son and I am a son of God and you and I are going to walk out of this hospital tonight." And furthermore, both Ron Spencer, who had just fallen out of fourth floor building, and his dad walked out of that hospital that night, and brother Ron Spencer went to work Monday morning. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Listen, friends, our God's a living God. That's all there is to it. &gt;&gt; And nothing shall be impossible with God. &gt;&gt; Brother Frasier and his good wife, that's Conniey's mom and dad, brother Mike Walls from Washington DC, a pastor there. And another brother was also there. I don't even have all of their names. Brother Joseph Hammed sent a text and wants to be remembered to you. and brother Benny Perry phoned and I and and I just can't remember them all. So, I just have to ask you to thank God for God's servants. &gt;&gt; And when you pray, thank God not only for the bride of Jesus Christ, what he's gone in your life or what done in your life, but listen friends, these are people if you're a son and daughter of God, you're going to spend eternity with them. &gt;&gt; And that's by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I think I'll just have you stand and we're going to pray and turn to the word. Thank you, brother Ryan. Dear heavenly father, how we thank you for this special time once more when we can gather together, be here in a place that we call a sanctuary. It is a sanctuary in the sense that we have not only come to worship you but we've come to separate ourselves from all the activity of the world our work our responsibilities and those things that occupy our mind uh moment by moment during the day and we feel under the pressure of time and everyone is so busy and there's so much to do but we come here now to rest &gt;&gt; we come here to hear your voice &gt;&gt; we come here and I am praying praying especially this morning that the Holy Spirit, the spirit of God, the very life force of the word of God will come and take charge of our minds and charge of our beings and take charge of this service, God. Remove all formality away, Lord, and just sweep in and do what you would like to do. We care not about the order of the service, Lord. Somebody wants to get saved or delivered in the middle of the meeting, it will certainly not be out of order with us, just have your will done in the name of Jesus Christ and we will give you all the glory. We thank you for the ministry, Lord, of the brethren as they minister from service to service and to have our brother Tom back. We pray that you will strengthen him as he comes to deliver the word this evening. We know the difficulties. Father, I just pray that you will overcome every one of those difficulties and you'd help him to minister. Oh God, thank you for the service Wednesday night. Our brother John have been so blessed by the word. Father, our brother Tim Dodd and how he has ministered and taken uh the two portions of service and how we've been so fed. I pray that you will bless this congregation and those of the bride of Jesus Christ around the world. And may all who are within the sound of my voice and especially here in this building will have a a a special appreciation for what you have done and what you are doing. In Jesus Christ's name, &gt;&gt; we ask that your name will be lifted up and glorified and we thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I looked down and saw I believe our sister Elaine McKenzie. So Jane McKenzie, why don't you raise your hand? Do you see that hand? &gt;&gt; She said she first heard the gospel in my mom and dad's house and I was probably four or five years old. I hate to talk about that, but you know, here we are. And Sister Elaine McKenzie, she said, "The first time I heard about the message was in Cloverdale Bible Way in the Log Church." Mhm. &gt;&gt; Those are always precious moments to me. And something that I'll just say personally, after my mother's funeral, I was taken over to your mom and dad's house. Yes. That's wonderful. And her mom, they haven't got it in the written down, but I remember vividly her mom sang at my mom's funeral. So, God bless you, Sister Lane McKenzie. She's strong and quick mind and sharp and we visited and and is here today. I appreciate that. God bless you. God bless you. They say yes. Thank you. Thank you. They say uh some friends are like silver and some are gold, but there are some that are platinum. Amen. All right. and I'll have you turn in your Bibles if you would please to John's Gospel uh 3rd chapter. Now, will you all promise to help me this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. We uh before we read, I'll try to tell you where I'm going. And I I need to tell you I need to tell you where I'm trying to go. So you can kind of use your imagination while I speak and say, "Oh, that that's where he's going. Let's hope he gets there." Amen. Uh I want to speak on this subject whether whether the spirit goeth. That means where it goes. Whether the spirit goeth. taken from the text which we'll read. Jesus saying, "Everyone that's born of the spirit, the spirit is like the wind bloweth where it listeth. You hear the sound thereof, but you cannot tell from whence it came and whether it goeth." And I have seen moves of God &gt;&gt; blow in &gt;&gt; and everyone gets caught up in it and then it's it blows out. But man builds a structure and to keep the movement moving and get caught up in the structure &gt;&gt; rather than what the structure was created for &gt;&gt; which was to carry the word of God for that season &gt;&gt; and become distracted and the structures become known as denominations. &gt;&gt; Right. So I want you to just think about that. So we'll read from John the 3 chapter please starting with verse one. There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews. The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God. For no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him." Jesus answered and said unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he's old, can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born? Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, unto thee, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I say unto thee, you must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it cometh, and whether it goeth, so is everyone that is born of the spirit. And it says, "The wind bloweth where it listeth. The dagot says this, the spirit breathes where it will, and you hear its voice, but know not whence it comes or where it goes. Thus it is with everyone who is born of the spirit." Amen. May God bless his word. Have your seats. And please just try not to be distracted at all the rest of the service. If there's any movement, if you try to keep focused, I'm going to move along quite quickly because I have considerable ground and you'll need just to stay from from one sub one one phrase to another. The Holy Spirit of God is the life force or the power that manifests and brings forth the spoken word of God to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God is the life force. &gt;&gt; It's the power that manifests and brings forth the spoken word into life. And incidentally, I want you to be mindful that the spoken word of God, everything was created by the spoken word of God. And God said, do we all agree? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said that the only thing that Satan could not do was create. &gt;&gt; He was God's right-hand man. Is that what he said? &gt;&gt; And the only thing he could do was not create. So he did not have access to the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And when he was cast to the earth, there was war in heaven. And Satan wanted to be lifted up. And he said, "I'll be like the most high." The only thing he couldn't do was create. Obviously, that's what he wanted to do. &gt;&gt; And so he's cast to the earth and he ends up in Eden. That's the first record we have. Why is he in Eden? Because that's where the spoken word was doing creative things. He wanted to be there. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the first thing that he touched when he approached Steve is hath God said. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; And so it's no surprise that whenever the spoken word of God, wherever it is coming and moving in the earth, you'll find that is where Satan tries to uh focus his full attention there. And that is the proof. That is the proof that that is the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And so now when you have a message, you've received a message. Say God has not only spoken his word, he's vindicated that this is his spoken word. &gt;&gt; You're going to find Satan right there trying to tamper with that word. He's not he's not interested in all this other stuff that he's got. &gt;&gt; You'll find it. And so as believers, we shouldn't say, "Oh my goodness, I never thought." Of course you did. &gt;&gt; Of course you know that's where he's going to be. &gt;&gt; Of course you know he's going to attack that. Of course you know that he's he always has. Why wouldn't he do that? &gt;&gt; And then when Jesus who was that word in flesh came, who comes to see him right after he's baptized? Satan himself. &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed of it. He comes right there. How brazen, how bold, how proud, &gt;&gt; how filled with whatever. And to think that he's changed his character. Not a bit. And wherever the spoken word of God is, you'll find that's where he is. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; I want everybody who believes it to declare that you believe that. In case there's any sitting on the fence, they'll think about it. Wherever the spoken word of God is, that's where you'll find him. Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God now can move over the whole earth or the spirit of God can move in a certain area. The spirit of God can raise up a nation and cause a nation to fall. The spirit of God can breathe and blow in as it has recently. I I want to I hope I come to you young men and ladies from SFU. That's not something that you just generated. That's the spirit of God that just blew in there. And you better take a hold of it and appreciate it, respect it while it's happening because finally the day will come and you'll say, "Wither did it go?" the supernatural happenings and all that the Holy Ghost does as a result of the move of God. Everything that the Holy Spirit does as a result saves individuals and maybe young people. They get a little older. They marry. They have children. families grow. Now we have families. Now we have now we we have things that we need to do. We have families and so on. So we need perhaps a Sunday school. So a Sunday school is set up. We we need a place to worship now because there's quite a few people that have gathered. So we get a place, we get a building or something else. And now the children need to be educated. And so perhaps there you do a let's have a school or let's get them together. And so there's a school or there's this and that and the other thing and then you find that that if the spirit of God if the people don't have the focus &gt;&gt; of why this exists &gt;&gt; this exists only because they had a message in the first place. &gt;&gt; They had the spoken word which they embraced which is the person of Jesus Christ. If they ever lose sight that that is Jesus Christ and lose lose that first love and lose that first connection. If they lose that they if they lose that then the rest of it just moves on as a structure &gt;&gt; and then people become consumed with the structure. Oh, we need this. We need to fix the building. We need another. We need this. We need that. Uh the the music. We need to change this or something and embellish it and make it nicer and make it this better. And and now suddenly all the structure becomes the focus. &gt;&gt; And we say whether did it go. Right. &gt;&gt; The message The message as a body and as a movement is that a crisis at this moment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the crisis in is involved. I'm dealing with it in this service. &gt;&gt; And when you see and you look out and you say, well, you know, then then then people become all taken up. Well, da da da this is happening over there and da da da this is happening over here and this is what has that's just exactly what Satan wants. He wants people to become all consumed and all involved with with the traps trapings of this and that and the other thing. That's not what's important. What's important is that that first initial fire and zeal in life is maintained. That's what necessary in a home. That's what's necessary in the individual life. It's not more buildings and more churches and more this or that that well we have churches and we have more churches and that's right and as long as the move continues but it is absolutely absolutely essential that the people who've been called by this voice re remold it fast in their heart this voice is the voice of my beloved &gt;&gt; and I can never be moved from that &gt;&gt; and it is this beloved that I'm consumed with. It is this lovely spoken word that I'm consumed with. It's this message of the hour and that's the purpose of our existence. That's why we have a building. That's why we have a broadcaster. That's why we have everything. &gt;&gt; And as we're sitting here right now, that's what's happening to fail in many places because Satan would do everything in his power and he's so subtle. He just he comes in when there's been growth and there's been missions and there's been expansion. But you know the life of this congregation or the life of any believer must be that it is reaching out to one more lost one, one more lost one. One more lost one. And and as we're sitting here this moment and sitting here this moment, the meeting, the first one that we've had that we've actually had uh physical to do with has just happened in Ethiopia this morning. &gt;&gt; And brother Basubi from Uganda has gone to Ethiopia. He went there for his honeymoon. And and I tell you, there's a young man just burning up. He's about 30 years old. and he and when we invited him to come to Canada or United States both he couldn't he couldn't get a visa to either place but he had to go to Nairobi to in Kenya to get his visa and he met a brother by the name of brother Paul and brother Paul is with him brother Paul had some connection in Ethiopia and he found some from Nairobi that have been going to Ethiopia why am I talking about that not to give you some information but to let you know and he said please pray for us there's a woman that's bound with a demon of port polio and he had polio in one leg and we've prayed for her and we need prayer. We need strength and he's calling on this congregation. He's calling on you sitting here now. Pray for this woman. Pray for us. This is a He says the fires are burning and they're baptizing some people. They've and he got into a church. He got into a church, a structured church that has 500 churches, Protestant churches in in there. and he's dealing with the pastor of that local church and they had a senior bishop over it. But the local pastor got hungered got hungry for this message and there gave him some message books. I tell you what, we need to hold these brothers up in prayer. Say, "Oh God, let the flame of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; burn and cause them to say things, cause them to speak, take control of their mind, take control of their tongue because it's a sweep. It's never swept there before that we know of or that God has never opened the door to us. But that but the one thing for sure, one day will come when you'll turn around and say, "Wither did it go?" &gt;&gt; It's not the same. And then by that time, you know, men and that that is exactly the critical spot. That's exactly the critical spot where Satan comes in and anoints the human mind. And then the mind men take it and say, "Well, we need to have, you know, we need to keep this ministry going, so we need more ministers, so we build a Bible school &gt;&gt; and we need to for our children." And and and then they're sick. We we might as well be in the hospital business. So we have a hospital. And brother Brandon says, "I have nothing against that. That's all fine. That's all good. But that wasn't it." &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; friends. It's the person of Jesus Christ. It is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that Holy Ghost is as real today as the day it brought you into the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we need to nurture that relationship. We just need to nurture it. When you're in a message, say, "Well, I'm I'm reading message books. I read three or four a day." No, that doesn't impress me. I'm happy that you do, but I would sooner have you read three or four pages and become so acquainted and have that person so speak to you that that you're just affected. Your life is changed and you come under the transforming power of almighty God and say, "I'm not the same person I was a month ago." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Such a faith, such a stability has come to me. And that's why it's so critical to hold to the original word &gt;&gt; and to move with it because the original word will continue to move and you can move with it &gt;&gt; in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed prophetus said the first thing that God wanted to reveal what he wanted to reveal himself to the people. Secondly, to have the preeminence in the body of believers and that is his bride that he might live in people. &gt;&gt; And then thirdly, to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowship with them. He speaks of Moses and he said he was a complete prisoner to the chains of God's word. Oh, I love those words. &gt;&gt; And we can we're not talking about Moses now. We want to talk about one another. Want to talk about yourself. Say, God, let me be a prisoner &gt;&gt; in the chains of your word. &gt;&gt; Could we make that a prayer this morning as I say it again? Let me be in chains love chains &gt;&gt; of your word. Let me be a prisoner to that person. The living word &gt;&gt; let me move with him. &gt;&gt; And whether you go, let me go. &gt;&gt; And when you leave, I'll leave with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said, "When the spirit of truth is come, the spirit of truth, that is the life that animates the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what gives the truth life. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth is come, here's what he will do. He will guide you &gt;&gt; into all truth, &gt;&gt; into all truth. &gt;&gt; And he shall not speak of himself. &gt;&gt; He won't say spirit, spirit, spirit, spirit. He'll say word, word, word, word. And whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak. And lastly, he shall show you things to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "We cannot tell from whence it cometh and whether it goeth. wentes from where from what from how and why. Now I want to give honor to God and I move just quickly through the word. The Bible tells us in the beginning that the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water. I need to make a point. So I'm starting right at the beginning. I'm going to take it through several places now very quickly. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If if he said, "Let there be light." And there was a fog, then it wasn't God's word. &gt;&gt; God, what God's word it'll bring in. The Bible says, "And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them, and whether the spirit went, we know not, but creation was completed. &gt;&gt; The sun didn't stop shining, and trees didn't stop growing, &gt;&gt; and the birds continued to sing and fly and produce, and so on and so forth. God didn't have to keep moving and brooding over the earth. He brooded over it and it happened and it was done. &gt;&gt; It was a finished creation. &gt;&gt; That's the point I want to make. &gt;&gt; It was a finished creation. &gt;&gt; See, God moved over over the people and and I don't want to get ahead of myself, but God moves over the people and he says uh uh this is the message of the hour. This is the evening time light. This is this is the last messenger and so on so forth. He doesn't have to come and say it every week. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to say it every day. It just keeps on moving. &gt;&gt; It's up to the people who get the revelation to keep moving with it. &gt;&gt; It's absolutely vital you keep moving with it. Otherwise, it just gets to be a structure. &gt;&gt; What do you do? I go to church. Where do you go? I go to a message church. No, it's not a message church anymore. &gt;&gt; It's just a building. &gt;&gt; There's lots of buildings. &gt;&gt; All right. And thus the heavens and the earth were finished in the host of them. And on the seventh day, the Bible says, God ended his work which he had made. &gt;&gt; It was finished. And he rested on the seventh day. And the spirit of God ceased its work of creating or brooding over the earth. It was done. Whether it went, I don't know, but it was finished. It was a completed work. The creation was a completed creation. And from that time, the sun continued to shine. The earth has continued to bring forth and man has continued to multiply. The spirit of God moved in the season of creation. The wind came to breathe the breath of the creation over the face of the earth. And it was so. &gt;&gt; The spirit of God displayed in various ways depending entirely upon what God had ordained to take place at that time. The spirit of God entered into Egypt one day in the form of Joseph. &gt;&gt; Whence it came, they didn't know. &gt;&gt; But it finally came to the place after a few events which you can read about. And Pharaoh has his dreams and there's a man with the wisdom of God in him. And Pharaoh finally said, and Pharaoh said unto his servants, can we find such a one uh a man in whom the spirit of God is? And they made him ruler and Egypt under him became the superpower. &gt;&gt; It blew in &gt;&gt; and made it a superpower. &gt;&gt; And then as it began to leave, they said came a king that knew not Joseph. Right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You're following me? &gt;&gt; And they knew not Joseph. And then look what happened to Egypt. Then they began to resist God. And God breathes in in a different form in the form of Moses. Now a prophet with a spirit of God in him. And the word and the spirit of the word and the word in his mouth &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God is with him. And it breathes into Egypt 400 years later and the children are in bondage and he comes in there. Let my people go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that word had to be animated. It had to happen. &gt;&gt; It just couldn't be some empty words. It couldn't just be a structure. Well, we'll manage somehow. No. Let them go. And &gt;&gt; when this message came and spoke to the demons that control your life, said, "Let my son go. &gt;&gt; Let my daughter go." &gt;&gt; There's no way all hell could hold you. &gt;&gt; There was no way. Hallelujah. God was speaking. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when we talk about vindication to this message, friend, don't you ever ever give vindication a second place. Vindication was God proving that that was him speaking, not someone else speaking. That's why cancers died and dropped to the floor. &gt;&gt; Talking to Sam Ray yesterday and he said he just was moved and directed to he hear a a deep call of the deep again. And I had just finished reading it that day, yesterday, reading about and brother Brand was talking to the one woman and he says, "Now this here, it's God. It's not a story, friends. It's God proving who's speaking. &gt;&gt; We don't want to hear just a man. &gt;&gt; If you came here to hear me, you're missing it. &gt;&gt; We only have one focus, and that has to be the one who came and brought this message. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's important. The building's not important. All the structures not important. What is a deacon board? There's all kinds of deacon boards. What's a trustee board? There's all kinds of trustee boards. What are some musicians? Nothing. What's the all the singers? It's only what God. It's only putting forward the focus. And if we lose the focus, we have nothing but a dead f a dead structure. &gt;&gt; Let me just drop this in physically speaking. And some nations are more benefited than others. But in a nation, we have all kinds of benefits. Social network. I'm not talking about internet. I'm talking about network for the unemployed and for the sick and the afflicted and for those that have, you know, the aged and and all of these different things. We have a a social network. And we have this and that. And we have, you know, clubs and communities and different societies and different things to meet the need of the people. But when the life, &gt;&gt; hear me? When the life in your body is gone, you don't need any of that. &gt;&gt; It's all still there. But it's just a dead framework to you. Even this body, even this body, God's given you all of this structure and a breathing apparatus and a mind that sends signals and your muscles move and all of these things happen. It's just for to animate the life. &gt;&gt; It's to express the life. And God gave it cuz he wanted to fill you with the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you express another life. And when this body dies, all of it, all this is is just a a framework. &gt;&gt; It's just a dead framework. &gt;&gt; And that's why a prophet could say of the denominations and everything just a dead framework. &gt;&gt; Meaningless framework. &gt;&gt; I need support from you. &gt;&gt; This is the message. And God breathed in and breathed into Egypt &gt;&gt; through Moses and came and said, "Let my people go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There had rose up a king that knew not Egypt. But here came another one. Now, and God now has is coming in another form. It's coming in a prophet form. And this prophet says now to this this system that has forgot God, he says, "For this cause, for this for this very deed, and for this cause have I raised thee up, &gt;&gt; I raised you up. &gt;&gt; I raised this cruel system up. &gt;&gt; To show my to show you my power &gt;&gt; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. And it'll be declared because these people you say are mudbers and slaves. I'm going to take them out of your hand. &gt;&gt; I raised you up as a great nation one day and you forgot God. &gt;&gt; Think of it America. Think of it Western world. Think of it Le Oysia that [Applause] &gt;&gt; I raised you up for the purpose. But if you lose the focus, why was the Constitution written? Why did men of God? Why did they go come to Plymouth Rock? Why did they find a new world? Not for a better life. For freedom of worship. We want to worship our God. Why are we gathering here? If we're not gathering here to worship our God, it's nothing but a dead structure to you. It is that life that will give you the honor and the respect that is due to the deacons that stand in the door and and the men who lead in the song service and say, "Thank God I can be here where the Holy Ghost is directing and hear a brother pray and see a minister stand up and preach the word of God." Oh God, how much I respect you and thus I honor them. Egypt today is not as it was. &gt;&gt; Egypt today is in chaos. &gt;&gt; Egypt today is slaying one another. &gt;&gt; While you're sitting here, they're trembling. &gt;&gt; While you're sitting here, they don't have hardly a place to of peace, &gt;&gt; right? And the Lord spake to Moses and said, "I've called during this time when they were bringing the children out. My goodness, help me." And and and God wanted to have a place where he could move in and have the people and identify a spot. He says, "You have them build a tabernacle for me." We need a certain kind of a structure. It's not the structure that was important. It was the God that was going to come into the structure. &gt;&gt; You build him a tabernacle. And this is what he said. And so I have called Belal the son of and the son of her of the tribe of Judah. And I listen to me. You young men listen to me now. And I have filled him with the spirit of God in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship. &gt;&gt; I know you drive into this yard and you say, "Oh, oh, there's the school. There's the school." I can tell you something. That scripture came into being in the last 24 months while men who didn't know how to do things under the guidance of brother Kim Dingwall and this congregation outside of four concrete walls did all the design work and all the things and say oh brother Kim my what wonderful wisdom I I took more people in to show them what brother Dingwall had had made and so on. I laid floor with with with people carpet and some of the young men here and brother Joseph and young men came didn't know the first thing about it in in no time they do better and laying the floor for the gymnasium here comes a professional man that's all they do is a business and tell brother Kim they said you're a young man lay that floor better than my man &gt;&gt; and those lines on the floor are absolutely precision and people who are who are doing brother Mark Powell and brother brother Sam Waldner and so many many others and they're bending bending uh uh tubes and conduit and bending it this way that way. I took two men in there. They were here on another subject. They were here on some real estate and they walked in and I said, "Let me show you the church, the school." And walked into the school and there was his mouth just hanging open. I said, "Outside of four concrete walls, the brothers and sisters from the church had did this place. They can't believe it." And we were in a an electrical place. And the man was just standing there looking and he's looking at all these conduit pipes going up just dozens of these pipes and bending and twisting and going this way. They were looking at the work of either brother Mark Powell or Brotherh Sam Walder, one of them. Anyway, and he looked at all those pipes. He said, "It's beautiful." I thought, "I'm just showing him the I'm just showing him the building and he's looking at all these pipes and his friend says to me, he's electrician. &gt;&gt; Where did that come from?" &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, those brothers did a good job." No, no, you haven't got the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The same God says, "I've anointed them. I've given them wisdom. I've given them so they know how to and they know how to work with steel and iron and brass and and gold and silver and and and how they will put the curtains together and how they will sew it. I gave them wisdom. That whole chapter is full of it. And because I've given them wisdom, they'll build a tabernacle." It wasn't the structure that was important. It was the God that was in the structure. and I will dwell with them. And for you school teachers and Mr. Tash and and and and the and all of the staff, it's not just the framework or the people in bodies that are there. It's the God &gt;&gt; that has determined &gt;&gt; my children, my little ones, my beloved ones shall not be under the influence of this demon power. If it's at all possible, I will have it under the influence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; My spirit. &gt;&gt; Friend, you think I'm pumping for a school? You're mistaken for BCA. Not a chance for CBW. Not a chance. That's not it. It's the God that breathed in and blew in and caused this to have its existence. We exist for his sake. We exist for his purpose. &gt;&gt; And then the time of the prophets, the the Bible says in prophecy, you have to help me. I'm so moved. I'm so affected. And the prophecy came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. And thus we have an Old Testament. They were moved by the Holy Ghost, but someone moved on someone else who could write &gt;&gt; and they were scribes and someone moved on someone else so they might interpret it and give it to another person in another language. And thus, &gt;&gt; the Bible came to us in the Hebrew language. &gt;&gt; And I'm coming now. And the spirit of God moves through the land raising up empires, &gt;&gt; kingdoms, &gt;&gt; and nations for his purpose. And when he's done, they pass off the same. &gt;&gt; And thus my title, whence goeth it, whence does it go? Whether does it go? We don't know. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you for sure it comes. And I can tell you for sure people become distracted &gt;&gt; and make nations and whatever more. And I can tell you for sure it goes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it goes to pick up some more of God's elected &gt;&gt; and the church of God moves on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God moves through the land raising up empires, kingdoms, and nations. and they rise and fall according to God's plan, keeping the focus of his will, which is his word, proven and vindicated word. I became interested and you'll have to you that are students now. You'll hear a little history that perhaps you didn't get at school. says that ancient Greek culture dominated much of the known world before the time of Jesus Christ. And at this time, Greek culture and influence and power was at its peak in Europe and Asia, experiencing and progress in the arts, and exploration and literature, in theater, in architecture, in music, in mathematics, in philosophy. And in science, does it sound familiar? &gt;&gt; As at the time of Jesus, &gt;&gt; it reached its peak. &gt;&gt; Why did it reach its peak? &gt;&gt; Because there was someone that was going to be energized and say, "We need this Old Testament Hebrew translated into the Greek because this is the language of the people." And that's why it's called the LXX because there were 70 scholars which this gentleman, this politician uh just forget his name just now. I don't forget it but I can't say it exactly. And he instructed and assigned them to put the Old Testament into English. Tommy, I believe it was if I'm saying that's right. And and then the and then this history says it is often considered a period of transition. This period when it had reached its peak sometimes even of decadence or degeneration and decadence is a luxurious self-indulgent. Does it sound familiar? describes a decline due to erosion of moral &gt;&gt; ethical and sexual traditions. &gt;&gt; I say friends, we've arrived again. &gt;&gt; But that happened at that time for one purpose. God allowed that kingdom. It blew in and that kingdom in Greek be Greece became a great a great kingdom and it actually gave birth to the Roman kingdom at about 31 BC just before Jesus. Why? Because Rome had to come into dominance to crucify the savior. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Where's Rome today? &gt;&gt; Where's Greece today? Where's all the philosophers? Where's all these wise men? Where's all of this? And whether it went &gt;&gt; they know not. &gt;&gt; I can tell you it did come. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you it did go. &gt;&gt; And from whence it came, they can't really say. &gt;&gt; And they may say, "Well, man, you know, man, we established schools and universities and colleges." I tell you what, even in the United States of America, Canada, the Western world, it's only it's only given what it is for one purpose. That's because God knew he was going to send a message at this hour. And the only important thing is the spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet comes up and begins to speak the first message that's recorded, faith is the substance. And he says his first word, "We have a new gadget." &gt;&gt; The tape recorder. &gt;&gt; You think the tape recorder was made for the military? Not a chance. &gt;&gt; And the world says that the that the uh uh computer was made for the military. Not a chance. &gt;&gt; The computer was made that that spoken word, that prophet's message would get up into the heavens and go completely around the earth. And that's the purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God raised up a nation whose spirit was to seek wisdom. For the Bible says, "For the Jews require a sign, but the Greeks seek after wisdom." God gave them that spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm preaching a little bit of what I preached to brother Tim Puit at the camp. And one thing that for all those in America, America, and I said this to them, I said, "One thing that I've admired about America is their uh loyalty &gt;&gt; and patriotism. I I I admire that patriotism." Yay. USA, the greatest on earth. We have the World Series and the World and the World. I said I'll say to you is I said to them it's not the world &gt;&gt; the USA happens to be 4.46 of the population of the world little less than 5%. The World Series and 5% excuse me don't make me an enemy now you're my best friends. 4.46% God &gt;&gt; made America. what it is. &gt;&gt; And part of their patriotism is if it's made in the USA, we've got to get it to the world. &gt;&gt; We got to export it. And they're anointed with economics. But God gave them that spirit because he was going to send a prophet out of their soil. And that message must be exported. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In every language. And this is not just missions, friends. This is the focus of this congregation. It's the focus of the message. And if we lose our focus, we just become a structure. &gt;&gt; And if you lose the focus, you just become a structure. &gt;&gt; Yes, it might be your neighbor. It might be some child. Who cares who it is? But God has you here and has you raised up in this generation for a specific purpose. &gt;&gt; Don't lose that focus. God breathed into those words of the Old Testament because one of them the spirit moved upon him. And hold on to some of these words. The burden, the burden of the word of the Lord that came to Malachi. Behold, the days cometh, says the Lord, and I will send you Elijah the prophet, &gt;&gt; to turn the hearts of the children, the fathers to the children, &gt;&gt; and the children to the fathers. That's a spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; But it came by burden. It didn't come lightly. It didn't come because a person just felt flippant about it &gt;&gt; or felt at ease in Israel about it. You're burdened with the word. &gt;&gt; 400 years of silence. &gt;&gt; And now a prophet is going to speak. &gt;&gt; What's this congregation say? &gt;&gt; I say amen to that. Amen. &gt;&gt; It blew in. &gt;&gt; 400 years of silence. Whether did it go &gt;&gt; and the word of God came as holy men of God were moved by the Holy Spirit. But for 400 years there was no movement. &gt;&gt; And whether it came, they didn't know where it came from. But they knew by the vindication of this prophet of God, he is a prophet and so we will ascribe his words and keep it. &gt;&gt; And then 400 years of silence and then whether it went I don't know. And here it came again. &gt;&gt; And John the Baptist raised on the scene. Strange. And a wind &gt;&gt; blew into Israel. And they came out of Jerusalem and all of Judea and Samaria to see this man baptizing. Who was it? Whether did it come? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; And he came to introduce one. He said, "There's one among you that's greater than I who's who left it. I'm not worthy to unbear undo. And I baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire." Amen. &gt;&gt; And soon that spirit went out &gt;&gt; and the masses ceased &gt;&gt; and all of Judea and Samaria didn't come anymore. &gt;&gt; And he got a bad name. &gt;&gt; Did you hear? He's thrown in jail. &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yes. And did you hear that he had his head cut off? He'd been killed. A young man. And some probably said just so tragic. You know, I enjoyed hearing him. I was really pricricked when he spoke. I knew there was something to it. Sorry, folks. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; And whether did it go? &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; But he did his work &gt;&gt; and he was gone. &gt;&gt; Right. Whether did the spirit go? And now here it was in one. He says, "I am the life. &gt;&gt; I'm the resurrection. &gt;&gt; I'm the living bread that came from heaven. &gt;&gt; No one could say that. Here come a different." Now, there's a different spirit. And he proved it &gt;&gt; and there was a vindication to it. &gt;&gt; And people believed on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he was getting ready to leave. and he stood in end of John's gospel and he breathed on them &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that act it happened in the old testament when God breathed into Adam and he became a living soul &gt;&gt; now there was a life there &gt;&gt; to animate the framework. &gt;&gt; And that was at the conclusion of the old creation. &gt;&gt; Are you listening? &gt;&gt; And now at the beginning of the new creation, the creator himself breathes on them and say, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." because it's his life that must be uh perpetuated through them. And they cannot do it with human life. They must do it with the life of God. &gt;&gt; And if this church exists for any other purpose, we're nothing but a church. [Applause] And he says, "Don't go out and preach, but tar in Jerusalem until you be endued with power &gt;&gt; from on high." &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice, friends, here's election. Don't think that I'm I don't think I'm haywire. No, he breathed on them. &gt;&gt; They weren't the only people around, &gt;&gt; but he breathed on them. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were waiting for his words. &gt;&gt; They had heard his words. You have the word of eternal life. &gt;&gt; This is a different word. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a different church. &gt;&gt; It's got to be a different kind of ministry. This has to have the focus of the message in every message. This is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; And he breathed on them &gt;&gt; said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." John John, I was appreciated your testimony. God began to deal with you. Don't ever forget that. &gt;&gt; That's that's exactly that's him. &gt;&gt; Keep in communion with him. &gt;&gt; Keep in communication with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. You'll go through the fire. You'll go through anything. There are no circumstance in earth that can get that can hinder or or take away from that life. &gt;&gt; Friends, help me. &gt;&gt; Satan hates wherever the spoken word is. And if you think you're going to have a church without difficulty, if you think you're going to have a gathering that harbors the spoken word of God, saying, "We're going to live it. We're going to give a testimony to it. We're going to give expression to it. We're going to see that it gets out, and the burden of the word of the Lord shall be our burden. You will not do it without persecution. You will not do it without reproach. You will not do it with every without the things that Jesus suffered. We'll suffer it all. But we suffered with joy. &gt;&gt; Are you with me folks in the balcony? &gt;&gt; Raise your hand in the balcony so I know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I want to see this same life, this same Holy Spirit coming in this building today. &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching to hear my voice. I'm preaching that I might that he might confirm what I've said &gt;&gt; as the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; And if he speaks conviction, he'll come to convict the world of sin. And if he comes with conviction, you get rid of that conviction now by confessing it. &gt;&gt; And the only way to get rid of it is to repent. This place is a living body of believers. &gt;&gt; And this place is a place of prayer. &gt;&gt; Just get rid of that conviction. Forgive me, Lord. What's difficult about that? &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for my last condition. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for the things I've spoken. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for the attitudes I've held. &gt;&gt; It's not worth it. &gt;&gt; We want to be a pure, clean vessel. And the spirit of God moved over that part of the earth in a local place in called Palestine for the specific purpose to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children. I said, "Did he do it?" &gt;&gt; Did he do it? &gt;&gt; One more time. Did he do it? &gt;&gt; Faithful &gt;&gt; spirit of Elijah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And they were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins." Once that was accomplished, the breath of the wind of God moved on. &gt;&gt; Whence did it go? &gt;&gt; Whether did it go? I don't know. But that was God life. &gt;&gt; And he's going to continue. I'm coming to your address, young men. You hang on to your seats. &gt;&gt; It's got to pass off to somebody. &gt;&gt; Young ladies, &gt;&gt; young families &gt;&gt; to take your place. &gt;&gt; Not to hold a structure together &gt;&gt; to give framework &gt;&gt; through which the life of God &gt;&gt; in this living spoken word can continue. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, we have to have jobs. And the God goes to that job. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; God goes to that bus, brother David. God goes to that house. God goes to that shopping center. You sisters, God goes there. &gt;&gt; And you have to know that when you're wheeling that cart around, I have God in me. &gt;&gt; Yes. This thing is Satan's Eden, but I'm greater than Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; You believe it? You're in school, in the education realm, and whatever more. Uh, but don't forget, you've got a purpose in this life. &gt;&gt; And your purpose isn't just for higher education. For higher education that you might attain something else, per eternal, permanent for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus was leaving, then he breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." And there's a notation here. Just as the original creation was completed, the original creation in Genesis was completed by an act of God. So the new creation was completed by an act of God in flesh. &gt;&gt; The head of the new creation. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful, friends? That's where we came from. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they were all gathered together in one place in one accord, &gt;&gt; a mighty rushing wind and I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Just comes to me now. There's two places in two messages and but one in spec in particular. Listen close. I believe it's West Palm Beach, Florida. And my I asked my wife, I said, "Find the place." We found the place. We failed to get it to the brothers on time. I want you to hear it. And the prophet of God is speaking about the Holy Spirit coming and the wind of God and the mighty rushing wind and it just goes right through the building louder than the people's praises and everything else. I tell you, &gt;&gt; do we have a message that's confirmed and confirmed and confirmed over and over? How many times does he have to do it? &gt;&gt; How many times like like Tommy Osborne says, "How many times does God have to do it for people to believe?" &gt;&gt; I heard it once, he said. &gt;&gt; We've heard it many more times and he didn't even hear what we have heard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. And they were gathered in the upper room. And there came a sound as a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all of them that were in the place. and the rushing wind. It says it says of this when the day of Pentecost was fully come and they were all in one accord in one place and suddenly suddenly whence it came we know not I don't know where it came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues lick as of fire and it sat upon each one of them and They were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues or languages as the spirit gave them utterance, a rushing mighty wind, a new message. The greatest week in history in all of history has happened. The first time that a man that a god, the God man &gt;&gt; has lived, died, and rose again. And the prophet and the messengers of that there were the apostles all of them well known and unknown those that had been visible those were not very visible and they said and we are witnesses &gt;&gt; this thing happened and we are witnesses &gt;&gt; somebody could have said well you produce it that's beside the point that's irrelevant we are witnesses of what God did &gt;&gt; that's what we are witnesses of what he did &gt;&gt; and they said a rushing wind. And this rushing wind is to carry some burden. The burden of the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is a rushing wind to carry a burden. &gt;&gt; We don't know how far or how long, but we've been sent to carry a burden. &gt;&gt; And it is to move by bearing with the suggestion of force and speed. And the prophet said it's an urgent message. Do you people of Cloverdale Bible way accept it? It's an urgent message. &gt;&gt; We haven't got lifetimes to carry it. You've been called at this late hour. Late late hour in a place that's it's a duplicate of what it was in the in the great Greek kingdom in the great Roman kingdom. It has sunk down into immorality into filth and such vulgarity. I'm almost ashamed to live here. Listen friends, I was in New York a few days ago. I was at LaGuardia Airlines, uh, LaGuardia Airport, rather, and and we had a little time and I said, "Let's get a little bite to eat." And there's a place and you could sit down on this side and and you could receive your bun or sandwich or something over here, just help yourself sort of thing and pay your bill. So I walked up and and the place was just absolute tens of thousands of people and the noise and and at first do we want to get something to eat? So I said to the lady, uh, can can we sit down here someplace? Well, yeah, you can sit. I said, is do they wait on us here? Well, yeah, you just sit down. I said, will you take our order? No, you you just punch it on the iPad. I looked on every table had iPad and I I just didn't want to do anymore. I got an iPad and my wife has an iPad and I said I said to her, "What happens if you don't know how to run it?" Oh, she says, "I'll help you." So, we sit down. She goes, "Oh, it's not working. It's I can rub it all off. Get another page. Start all over again." Finally, some pictures came up. She says, "You know what? What do you want?" So, I can't smell the picture. I mean, I guess we I guess we'll have that. So, you just poke that. And I thought, man, where are we? Where are we? And then and then then we sat there. Our order is gone now. We poked the right thing. And and we we sat there and and the music then then then I'm listening to all the sounds. I'm trying to I'm trying to decipher the different sounds because, you know, I could have been stoned deaf and I'd have still heard plenty. And some woman was screaming out her lungs on the other side. I was just wishing somebody should put her out of her misery. That's just terrible. That woman must be suffering something terrible. And she just screaming out. And I thought I couldn't understand a word. And then over here they're announcing the late flights and everything was late. So the flights and they were competing with her and they were telling that this flight has changed and you go down to A19 and you know and and I couldn't even make it out and I looked at the people. I saw how everyone was dressed and so on and I just began to see a whole big picture. &gt;&gt; We're in hell. &gt;&gt; We're in hell. I said I said this is a combination of hell and an and insane institution all at the same time. I said to my wife we are in an insane institution. She says absolutely we're an insane institution. I said all this noise and everything get me out of here &gt;&gt; as fast as I can. I'm just getting to be a nervous wreck. &gt;&gt; Blessed quietness. Holy quietness. What assurance in my soul &gt;&gt; on the stormy sea. He speaks peace to me. And how the billows ceased to roll. &gt;&gt; Well, the billows wouldn't cease to roll there. So, I got up and left. But in the midst of this chaos, &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And I thought much about this &gt;&gt; and the spirit of God blew in. &gt;&gt; Spirit of God blew in &gt;&gt; to the Lord Tweeds High School. &gt;&gt; And there's several ste sitting here yet. Who all went to the Lord Tweeds High School? Would you raise your hands? One, two. Janet, did you go to Lord? David, three, I know. Linda went Marilyn. You went. Where's your hand? What's that mean? Anita, people are ashamed to have gone to that school. But you know what happened? A wind &gt;&gt; was it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A wind blew in. &gt;&gt; A wind blew into that school. I'm talking about a wind, a breath of God. And they started coming and and and the wind had blown upon yours truly. And we had an empty house downtown and that became Bible Way House. And this wind, this wind, they came, they came stoned and they came drunk. One was so drunk he was 6'5 or 6'6 and he'd hover over Maryland back there and and you know, ridiculed her about some stuff. And and I got fed up. I said, "You tell that big guy. You tell him the next time he comes to you, you look up in his face and you tell him, "My father said I'm to tell you you're a chicken. You're not a great big hulk. You're a chicken. You're afraid to come to that place." And he was afraid. Doesn't matter how big, how strong, how muscular, how many steroids a person takes, they're scared. and he himself walked up and was standing before the hedge and he actually fell over the hedge drunk without coming in. But you know what? He came in. &gt;&gt; He blew in &gt;&gt; and God blew into his life. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Furthermore, 530 of the prophet's messages were cleaned. I'm talking about cleaned by him, filtered by him in a room. Took four years. Whether did it come, I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it happened. Whether did it go, I'm not sure. But I can tell you one thing. It happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about young men from school, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; With a mind to do something for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. just being available. Can I just finish, please? Can you give me another few minutes? &gt;&gt; Have we got that 90 second clip? This This is just a informal. I I didn't do this. I just found this. It it shows uh just the spreading of of of uh Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and so on, Islam. Uh if we don't have it, I'll let's continue on here. We'll need the lights right down. That was quite self-explanatory. birth of Abraham and Judaism and that's where it was conquest of Katan Canaan that's Africa uh North Africa and the Arab states h ch India over here and there's Hinduism death of Jesus and Christianity and just immediately following that then Christianity that Buddhism over east and China and Christianity. The birth of Muhammad and Islam, Islam now in green, Islam spreading like that. Muslim conquest, Muslim conquest, Muslim conquest and Islam came over there. in Christianity. Christianity versus Islam they say and watch Christianity. This is just Christianity as a whole. Those that believe believe in Jesus Christ, missions abroad, Israel founded. Can you find Israel? Not a very big spot. That's where it all started. Abraham was there. The prophets were there and they sent this word. Look at where it went. All right, you can turn it off. I'm going to close in a few minutes, but I'm not done quite. Brother Brandham said in the message, "Look, if you can focus your camera till you can see that," he was speaking of something specific. He says, "And know it cost the life of God himself when he made his life here. Didn't have to give it up. He laid it down freely. He was God." Listen, church, he was God. He didn't have to die, but he did it freely. Amen. &gt;&gt; Gave his own life that he might bring sons to him. &gt;&gt; That his work might continue on. That his work might continue on. May I say it again &gt;&gt; to you that are alive in this day? That his work may continue on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not a bunch more structure. &gt;&gt; But his work. &gt;&gt; His work. He is the word. He is not just a Bible or just not just books and not just tapes. He's a living word, the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the work that I do, John 14:12, the work that I do, you will do also. If the things could be done like that and you can see him and see him only and see him only, I'd like to I'll take John's John often asks you to say a word. Could you say only for me? &gt;&gt; Only to see him only. Now let's say him only. &gt;&gt; Him only. &gt;&gt; Not the church. &gt;&gt; Not that church. This church, not that denomination, another denomination. Him only. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can see him only, &gt;&gt; then you'll get your camera in focus. &gt;&gt; Not till you see him only. &gt;&gt; When you see him only, then you'll know my camera's in focus. My life's in focus. Now I have purpose for this structure. Now I have purpose for the church I go to. And I'm happy to clean it or do whatever I have to do because I see him only. &gt;&gt; And he says a camera in focus to see a place to where God can use you &gt;&gt; certainly. &gt;&gt; Now in these last days and I'm closing with this and this was really the heart of my message. You are here. You may be here as guests. Some may have come as a result of the baby dedication or whatever more. You're not here because the baby was dedicated. You're here because God wanted you to hear this. &gt;&gt; You may have just been invited or you may be visiting for the first time. God wants you to hear this. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm I'm closing in just a few moments, but give me your attention. Oh, here comes now another wind begins to blow. Here's a boy. God works in such strange way you couldn't duplicate it again. &gt;&gt; And he's carrying water to his father's still. &gt;&gt; His father's a bootleggger. &gt;&gt; His father's an alcoholic. The family is Catholic. And he's carrying in two little cans water to the still to make more alcohol. He says, "And I heard &gt;&gt; a wind blowing." And it was real still everywhere. And I wondered where that sound was coming from. It was a tall tree that I was sitting under. And I stepped back to look around to see where that was coming from, where the wind was coming from. and about halfway up the tree about the size of a barrel and the leaves were going around and around. You know, it could have been Moses telling the people while I was standing there and the sheep were behind me and I I was standing there with my staff and I I saw this bush and it looked like it was on fire and I I drew I was attracted and it drew near I drew near to it and there was a flame that was burning and suddenly I heard a voice [Applause] I'm the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Remove your shoes. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, friends, a challenge to you. They believed him. &gt;&gt; Believed him to action. &gt;&gt; Believed him to say, "What did he say? That's true. &gt;&gt; And about halfway up the tree, about the size of a barrel, the leaves were going around and around and around, milling in the tree. And a voice came out of the tree saying, "Don't you never smoke?" &gt;&gt; That voice, &gt;&gt; hear me had you specifically in mind. &gt;&gt; That's the all knowing God. that voice had you in mind because knew that one day I'm going to speak to some other people. &gt;&gt; I'm going to use this vessel. I'm going to send out this voice. I'm going to use technology that's just being invented. I will use that which Cain has devised in Satan's Eden. I will use it, but it'll be my voice that will be going out and people will be quipped by my voice. And they shall love my voice. &gt;&gt; And it will be the voice of the bridegroom. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And to others, they will hate the voice. &gt;&gt; And some will say, "Oh, he's a good teacher, nice preacher, so he he screams or he does this." But others will say, &gt;&gt; "Well, what did he say? &gt;&gt; I love that voice. Amen. &gt;&gt; What have we done, brother Mike? &gt;&gt; Hear this message. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Don't you never smoke or drink &gt;&gt; or defile your body in any way? There'll be a work for you to do &gt;&gt; when you get older. And I want you to bring I want to bring you to Miami, Florida. Not to Miami, West Palm Beach, Florida. I want to play. I will still do it, Lord willing. And when it comes over these speakers, I guarantee you, you're going to get goosebumps. &gt;&gt; That's the voice and the messenger that was sent &gt;&gt; in this day &gt;&gt; to you folks. &gt;&gt; To you folks, &gt;&gt; to you young men, ladies, you folks. You folks, us folks. &gt;&gt; That's the voice. That's the focus. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose that all this structure even exists. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; And whether he goeth, &gt;&gt; I trust to go with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the work that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father. Now listen real close. I'm at the actually the hub of my whole service. I spent so much time and then God raised up. There has to be people that will raise this voice. &gt;&gt; So I will I will introduce &gt;&gt; a Pentecost. And the wind blew into Isuza Street. How many have heard of Isuza Street? &gt;&gt; Show me your hands. And the wind blew into Isuza Street. Go on Google and go to Isuza Street and read what happened. And uh and the wind blew into Isuza Street. And uh it was a black brother that was the pastor had one eye and only one eye. Brother Bam, Daddy Seymour, and he was standing there. But it had also happened in a in a Kansas, I believe, in a Bible school uh run by a brother Parnum. And there were there was other early Pentecostal fathers, and Pentecost blew in. And they were having this uh they were having like what would be a seminar, but they were having gatherings and they were having prayer meetings and they prayed earnestly. And this woman, one woman in Isuza Street began to speak in an unknown language. And they didn't know what was happening. And then it just went like a flame. Went like a fire. But the focus went from the life that was causing that to speaking in tongues. You had to speak in tongues. And so they became distracted. They became distracted. And then we got to establish. We got to establish and have Bible schools and train men. And we got to have meetings. And we've got to establish churches because people have to speak in tongues. That became the focus. That was only something that God did at that time. Are you with me? Do you understand it? &gt;&gt; But God had a further purpose. Listen now, I'm preaching. And God had a further purpose. He was raising up a whole movement. A whole movement that would be all over the earth called the great Pentecostal movement. The last age, &gt;&gt; the Leodysian age. that would receive the messenger and hear him and give open doors. And because of that, and he said, "You Pentecostal people received me." He said, "I was as one born out of due season for you." But the purpose was to advance the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Now, a prophet is in the land. And this whole movement suddenly has a new purpose. And they thought, "Oh, this man will cause our movement to grow, our organization to grow." God's not interested in the organization. He not interested in the denomination. &gt;&gt; He raised it up like he raises up empires and nations and kingdoms to give advancement to his word. &gt;&gt; And they moved his word &gt;&gt; and it faded off the scene &gt;&gt; and began to decline. and go into a backsliden state. &gt;&gt; And in 1952, God raises up the Christian Businessman International by Deus Shakarion. Why? Because God knew the organization would shut the door and they'd use a non-denominational group of businessmen to give it to to advance it and to keep doors open until the message could be heard. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And he raised up certain men like Carl Williams. And Carl Williams said to the Christian businessman, he was a powerful man in Phoenix. And he said, "If you if you close the door on William Brandham, I'm leaving." &gt;&gt; And I was I was present in some of the last last times know the difficulty. And you can feel the air turns almost acidic. because they're even closing the door because God hear me now. Because God knew there'd be another fresh breath of air, another breeze of the Holy Spirit, and people like you and I would begin to see this is God's message. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. This is the opening of the scripture. This is the opening of the word of God. [Applause] and we enter into a relationship with what is in the book. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now, here's where I'm going to lose some of you, and I hope I don't lose anybody. I came to you Pentecostal people kind of late. I'm one born out of due season, but I remember reading history in Isuza Street. Now I want you, he said him speaking, visitors and all, young people, mothers, listen close. I want you all to be very careful here and see this. God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; is going to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It has to be for it has to it is the spirit quickened word of God &gt;&gt; spoken by the prophet of Malachi. Jesus referred to it. &gt;&gt; It's just before Christ comes the second time. &gt;&gt; And by the time Jesus comes, all scripture must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; The Gentile dispensation will be in its last church age. &gt;&gt; That's why there'll be no more after Pentecost. &gt;&gt; And you can't denominate this message. It doesn't say people can't leave it or backslide or whatever more. You can't denominate the message. You may be left with just a structure. But the you can't denominate the message because the message is Jesus Christ. Nobody can handle and and put Jesus Christ into a human framework. &gt;&gt; When they think they have whether he went, he's gone &gt;&gt; and all they're left is holding an empty framework. Oh, we got a church. We got singers. We got this beautiful choir. All the rest of it &gt;&gt; doesn't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; The gentile dispensation will be in its last age when that messenger of Malachi for Malachi comes. And here's three lines. And I want you to hear it. You've heard it many times perhaps, but maybe no time like this. He will be right with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care how many ifs, buts, whatever these human little puny, insignificant minds try to figure out about the word of God. You only show your ignorance by even asking. [Music] &gt;&gt; The first thing you need to deal with is all the vindication. &gt;&gt; Amen. deal with him saying to this woman, "Deal with what I heard and or what brother Sam heard, what I read uh yesterday morning, deal with this one." And he tells her all about her her her illness and disease and so on. Then he says, "And don't they call you Eva?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; York. &gt;&gt; And you live at 613 6th Street. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Answer that. Where did that come from? &gt;&gt; What's that got to do? Oh, it was a beautiful building. It was a great auditorium. The the sound system was this or the uh or the air conditioner was that? Who gives a care? &gt;&gt; The messenger &gt;&gt; was speaking. &gt;&gt; And you think that woman said, "Well, I I think the carpet's the wrong color." No. She was so anxious. Yes, my name's Eva. And yes, my last name is York. And yes, I live at 613. And she could go out of there saying, "God spoke to me. &gt;&gt; That's why we're here. That's why we're in existence. &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose." Amen. &gt;&gt; And he he will take this messenger will take &gt;&gt; this now close. This is not a preacher just preaching. He will take the whole Bible. &gt;&gt; He will take the whole Bible. Friends, &gt;&gt; I don't know what means this to you, but without this, you're going to be nothing but a teaspoon of dust and ashes. &gt;&gt; He will take the whole Bible &gt;&gt; from Genesis &gt;&gt; to Revelation. He will start at the serpent seed. &gt;&gt; That's where it started. &gt;&gt; And he will carry on. He will carry on from the serpent seed. He will carry on through the scripture &gt;&gt; through every move and every breath of God, every breath that blew in, kingdoms rose, kingdoms fell. God's men came. The Savior came and he will carry on to the very end &gt;&gt; to the to the messenger in the latter rain, &gt;&gt; the teaching rain. &gt;&gt; The rain is there will be a messenger in the latter rain. &gt;&gt; I said to my wife, "Isn't there a song they used to sing? That was a a a song in the world. Just a whirly song. There's a a a voice in the wind. Yeah. I think that was it. Voice in the wind or sound in the wind or was that Margaret voice in the wind? I said they didn't know what they were saying. &gt;&gt; There is a voice in the wind. &gt;&gt; I heard that voice. &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed, friends. I'm not ashamed in the least to say I'm not ashamed in the least to say that voice has holding power. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what kind of wind or what kind of persecution or what happens to you. The voice in the wind, the voice in that breeze will hold you and you come through &gt;&gt; and whether it come &gt;&gt; I do not know. And we had a whole wind blow through the school and they even said what's happening. &gt;&gt; Do you know down Lord Twemer school they put up banners of some of the young people who've been changed transformed overnight. &gt;&gt; Listen to me kids in grades 8 through to 12. Almost 25 came and almost 25 were killed one for one. And when the wind went, you say that was tragic. There was a young man and he came and he was affected and he he wanted to he wanted to believe. He knew that something was to it. and he came and I was there and we just finished our little service. The place was packed. People were sitting up on the steps. In fact, we didn't have room for them. 50, 60 people. It was a wind. &gt;&gt; They couldn't help themselves. Brother Jim, they couldn't help themselves. They were just attracted and drawn like bees to the honey. &gt;&gt; Brother Kyle, I'm here to say to you, it's a wind in Victoria. And where it come from, we don't know. &gt;&gt; And when it's gone, you can never bring it back. You can have better musicians in a nicer place, in a nicer structure. You cannot repeat what's happening &gt;&gt; you at SFU. I say you want to thank God for what's happening at SFU &gt;&gt; and just realize that there's a there's a messenger in the wind. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not just speaking idle words, friends. And I said to this young man, I knew that the Holy Spirit was on him. And the little flighty girl that was on his arm was a Baptist minister's daughter. She just had too much religion. And she just said, she grabbed him by the arm right while I was talking to him. She said, "Let's get out of here." And she walked out. They jumped in their car, drove up to drove up to Cam Loops, and the car went off the road and he was killed. Is that the end of it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; As far as I know, I don't have any more story to tell, but I can tell you she will stand before God on the day of judgment and give answer for saying, "Let's get out of here." when the messenger in that breeze was trying to speak to him, trying to persuade him, and I don't know where he is. Friends, when the Holy Spirit's moving, there's one thing for us to do. Move. &gt;&gt; Move with it. &gt;&gt; We don't pay any attention to the structure. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened. When the Holy Spirit moved and groups had been formed and churches been established and ministers have been recognized and deacon boards and all kinds of things and musicians and everything and the structures all in place and then they and and it's a it's a critical moment that Satan can come in and start to use the human reasoning say, you know, well, we don't feel the same, but we got to keep it going. &gt;&gt; Just got to keep this thing going. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they'll find find another preacher and find another this and find a song leader and find something else. And we got to keep this going because we got to keep it moving. &gt;&gt; That's when it's empty structure. &gt;&gt; And God's not a God. I have the words of a prophet who said, "I hate a powerless church. [Music] and hearing you young people being Friday night and just sitting at the back and seeing over a hundred maybe 150 young men and young women and those counselors that were at the camp &gt;&gt; and hearing the various testimonies and hearing your testimony John. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you young people. I was just in a meeting and I'm ending with this truly. I was just in a meeting at brother Spencer's and the people coming from different places and the place was packed and several hundred people there and a lot of the ministers and and brother PR took two services. I took two services and uh brother came up to me and he said, "I heard you preach once and he said, you told me how you had a a relationship before you were married as a young man. You had a relationship with God and the Holy Spirit would just spirit of God would just move on you." and I worked for the Hudson's Bay Company in a gatorial. I was manager, assistant manager and um and the grosserian. So I was in charge of the produce and the Holy Spirit would come on me and I want to I want to express myself so bad. I just want to tell him how much I loved him and thank him for it. I just saw beauty everywhere. That was the messenger in the in the wind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I had to get away from everybody. I got to get away. Got to get away. And I go between the stacks of the groceries and sat and stand there and weep and tell him. And here's a man 50, 60 years later talking to me a few days ago. He said, "I never forgot that." He said, "That's what I want." And he said, "And you and I said, ' And I'd go into the cooler." Yeah. He said, "You said you'd go in the cooler where it was so cold and I knew people wouldn't come in there." And I just go in there and talk to him. And I can tell you, friends, that same one that I'm talking about, this is not tears of joy or tears of sorrow. They're just tears of love. &gt;&gt; And he's still the same today. &gt;&gt; And I'm speaking this way because I'd love to introduce him to you. &gt;&gt; I'd love for you to be able to know him in the same way. &gt;&gt; And you can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham says, "Don't miss this. This prophet will take the whole Bible from Genesis right through to the messenger in the rain. To me, that's the crux. That's the whole message. Why do the message churches exist? For one purpose, on behalf of him. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I'm absolutely consumed life. Nothing in life means anything outside of him. people saying, "Well, these are falling away and these have this to say and that have that to say and that that has nothing to do with it, friends." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When you when when when you have a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And without that, without without him, this is dead. A dead framework. The church, everything else a dead framework. &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me? Yes, &gt;&gt; it's him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we say the word, we're talking about him. A person. &gt;&gt; A person. I've been saying this week and saying, "Lord, all I want to know is I'm pleasing you. I don't care what anyone else thinks. I just want to please you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here in this church of Cloverdale, if we ever should lose the focus, the focus is him. &gt;&gt; The focus is him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; I've tried to speak of you through this entire service when the wind blew all through these places and countries and nations and kingdoms and churches and seasons and times. s and when the wind blew and you raised up a Luther and they had a message, the just shall live by faith. And that was their theme. The just shall live by faith shall just shall live by faith. But you moved on and now here we are and we have a messenger who said there can't be anymore. &gt;&gt; And we see that everywhere. &gt;&gt; There can't be anymore. &gt;&gt; And we've entered into a relationship with you, Lord. And I'm here standing here not as a young man but as a senior. And I'm so thankful, so thankful. I can declare before these people, you're more real, more precious, more wonderful. I just want to adore you. I want to give you all the praise. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Some want to focus that just on healing, but you are the healer. And for every sick person here, may they rise in the name of Jesus Christ and be healed by the divine physician, Jesus Christ. For any that are here and out of out of fellowship with you, Lord, I do not want to close this service as a Sunday morning service. I want to come to a close with you speaking to them and to let them know that you are here to step beside them now and so that they will sense and feel you and know you and you will create within them such a desire such an intensity and they say Lord I must I must have you beside me. I must have you in me. Oh come and those that may not have the baptism or the infilling of the Holy Spirit sweep in. Oh God, sweep in. Fill these structures. Fill these vessels with the holy divine spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Cause us to be the kind of reflection that you have. God the prophet messenger. He he is gone. But we are here. We are here to complete this age. Father in the name of Jesus I commit everyone here for you and to you in Jesus name. Amen. I want to sing in a more in a moment pleasing. Now while you're quiet and while you're listening just listen just come to my mind. you didn't say it. And I said, "Yes, didn't say it. We can't duplicate what we speak of in the quotes. Your name is Eva, last name York. You live at 6136th Street." I can't duplicate that. And I could say whether it went, I don't know exactly. I just know there never was a ministry like it. And like Tommy Osburn said, "Don't mistake me. That will not happen again." And he said something very strong. He said, "That was God. God walked our way. &gt;&gt; God in flesh once again." &gt;&gt; Amen. friends. That ministry passed off the sane. And then and then there was a wave and there was a move and there were people, please excuse the personal reference, but there was a brother sorrel in Australia. There was a Perry Green from Bulmont, Texas in Tucson. There were other men. There was a brother Gunther over in Saskatchewan. There was a brother Willard Collins that took the church. and Jeffersonville and there were others and they began to carry on and now the word had to be it had to be introduced. &gt;&gt; It had to be spoken of &gt;&gt; and another era came into being and there was a lot of mechanics involved. There was uh we had to find and seek out men that could interpret and translate and have a certain education and try to find them in Finland and try to find them in Poland and try to find them in India and several in India for the Tamil and Telugu and the Hindi and all the different languages and God helped us. &gt;&gt; Did this a man do this? No. 30 years friends is a messenger in the wind. &gt;&gt; If I started to tell you and I and my wife were speaking this morning, I said, "This has been a most supernatural gospel." I could not even begin to write the miracles and supernatural things and God speaking directly and saying this these certain words and it happens &gt;&gt; because it was him [Music] &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; I want to close but I want to also tell you there's another era [Music] brother brother brother Lee Vale is gone on a lot of other men that were around brother Brandham are gone. And those that now were with him and those that can say I was a witness. I stood there and I saw that and I heard that your grandpa, Sister Joy, Brother Joe Riley recently gone and other men have gone. It's another whole era that is passing off of the same and we do not have much more time. And and and as that happens, listen to me now. As that happens, I'm burning up with this. As that happens, people tend and and and Satan gets in right then. That's a crisis moment. Gets in right then and tries to just index the people to human reasoning and human intelligence and to structure the thing to keep it going. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. This messenger, the Lord Jesus Christ, will never need a human structure to keep him going. &gt;&gt; Whence he came, I know not. And whether he goeth, I know not. But I can tell you one thing, he will keep moving until there's a until there's a a a union at the marriage supper of the lamb. He will keep taking this bride forward until there's a trans there's a transformation of of the changing of these bodies. It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; You young ladies believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This side believe it. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; This is what we believe. &gt;&gt; And this is the driving force. &gt;&gt; And it's the only force. &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we? Please. We sing. Pleasing. Pleasing. Let me be pleasing to you. Let everything that you be pleasing to you. [Music] Let everything I pursue bees. [Music] Everything I do [Music] pleasing to you. [Music] Pray [Music] everything I pursue be pleasing [Music] to you. &gt;&gt; This lesson before we close, we're going to sing it. Going to sing I surrender all in a moment. Some of you know real well, and I'm going to make a statement. Don't go out of here the way you came in. You come in here hungry. You come in here dry. You don't need to go out that way. Say, "This is going to change as of this moment." You know what I've been doing? Dedicating myself in the even the last few days. So, I want to be pleasing to you, Lord. I don't want to be I don't want to be obsessed with taken up with structure. I don't want a structure. I want you. I want the person. I want somebody I can feel. &gt;&gt; Somebody I can love. Somebody who can respond back. &gt;&gt; If you haven't got that, I'm going to be praying for you. Not after you leave. I'm going to pray for you while you're here. Going to ask all that God has spoken to in a very specific way if you want to come. And we'll just have a word of prayer. It It's good for you to take a step, hides out. It takes and exposes and just says, "I'm just I'm done with this. I'm just not going to stand here back in the shadows. I'm going to walk up there. I'm going to identify myself. I want God to meet with me. &gt;&gt; Brother Ed, I want this kind of relationship. I want the messenger that's in the wind. &gt;&gt; That's what I want in my life. We'll sing I surrender all. And then we're just going to have prayer and then we'll dismiss at that time. [Music] Jesus Christ to him. [Music] I will love and trust in his presence. Sing [Music] [Music] to meior. I surrender all and I'd like a few brothers would you come and just join me here going to pray for these people. We're going to pray together. Just stand here. Brother Tom, I think we just stand and we'll just pray together if two or three are gathered. I want you people to know we not may not be able to touch you all, but there's one here has already touched you. [Music] And I've asked him and I'm asking him. We don't know exactly what's what's pulsating in your heart, but he feels every vibration. And I'm sure if the God's prophet was here and took you by the hand or spoke to you, he would say, "I feel a welcome spirit. You're welcoming this spirit. You're welcoming this messenger. &gt;&gt; The messenger that was in the prophet. The messenger that was in the spoken word. The messenger that's in the wind. The messenger in in the word. Not just a Bible, but the messenger, my Lord Jesus, blessed Holy Spirit. These people that have stepped out of their seats have come forward and something beating in their heart, something beating in their heart. Touch them, oh God. Touch them with the divine touch. Touch them down into the soul realm. Oh God, further than the emotional realm, touch them in the soul realm, oh God.

Transform them, oh God, until their mouth will speak forth the glories of the Almighty Quad. Speak, my Lord. Speak, my Lord. Touch them, I pray. Touch them, oh God. Let the Holy Spirit fall. Fall like a cloud upon them and fill them with the Holy Spirit. Refill with the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ, I resist every hindrance. I resist every hindrance. And say to the people, be loosed in Jesus Christ's name. Be loosed to express and make known your heart's desire. be loose to express your love to him. This holy one of Israel. This holy one of Israel. Oh, bless his holy name. Jesus, my Jesus, how we love you. How we love you. Oh, lovely messenger in the wind of God.

If you feel to pray for different ones, that's fine. Wherever God lead you. If you feel to pray for anyone, it's fine. Okay. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you sing in faith? Take a step of faith. &gt;&gt; Everyone here so thankful all you young men raise out to say, "Oh God, what brother Bis was speaking about today. Let me participate. Let me have let me possess that in Jesus Christ's name." Yes. Hallelujah. Why don't you lay hands on one another? Why don't you lay hands on one another?

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come near. Come near. Elijah said, "Come near, oh God. Come near to me. Touch me, oh God, with a living fire, with a living flame. Oh my god, my God.

Oh, he that hath the ear to hearing time is here. [Music] We do not know what the next hour holds or what the next afternoon or this afternoon holds. [Music] But I pray that God's presence. The very nearness of this one go with you and that you'll have the testimony even tonight coming to the service. It's different. And that's what I caught from you young men and the young ladies that were speaking at the at the Friday night meeting. And I was moved by some of the sisters that got up as well. But a common phrase that was is different. What happened to me is different. I've had a lot of things. I trust it'll be different with you. And let it be known to you. This was not a sermon. I announce to this congregation that the era within the message &gt;&gt; is is changing and Satan knows that &gt;&gt; and he tries to inject human reasoning and human skills and human abilities to keep the structure going. And I want to announce the structure is not important. Amen. &gt;&gt; The structure is only a means to advance and further the messenger Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; him that's in the voice in the wind. God bless you with this mess. Father, I know the hearts have been really reached out and took a hold speaking in faith and you're responded. You've responded to it and you're answering and it will indeed be different for them. I pray that you'll just cause the level of revelation to intensify from one service to another. You you'll bless the ministers that minister to the bride of Jesus Christ. Anoint them mightily, I pray. Dismiss us now that we might come back refreshed this evening in Jesus Christ's name with blessings now. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. We'll see you this evening. [Music] Wonder. [Music] Here [Music] we go. [Music] [Music]
