[14:48] about my uh the memorial service for my
[14:52] dad. It's going to be a Bible fellowship
[14:54] church, which is at uh on 66A Avenue,
[14:58] just west of 152nd Street. It's going to
[15:01] be uh at 2 o'clock on uh Saturday,
[15:04] August the 13th. And maybe just before
[15:07] Brother Mike sings, I'll share
[15:08] something. I shared part of it, but I
[15:09] didn't tell the whole thing. So, uh and
[15:11] I know it was a real blessing to some
[15:13] people, and it certainly uh has given me
[15:15] just a huge amount of peace. um you know
[15:19] about 15 years ago. Um actually before
[15:23] that my dad when he was around 63 he
[15:26] started getting really depressed cuz his
[15:28] dad had died when he was 63. And so he
[15:30] thought you know probably my time's not
[15:33] much longer for this world. And so he uh
[15:36] he was uh he was kind of uh depressed
[15:40] cuz he thought that was it. He was going
[15:42] to go any moment. And uh and then it was
[15:44] a little bit after that he kind of came
[15:46] out of that a little bit after that he
[15:48] was just praying and he said Lord
[15:50] cuz I guess he was thinking about you
[15:52] know u the Lord looking after him and he
[15:55] said Lord do I have an angel that looks
[15:57] after me. He said you know you showed
[16:00] brother Brandham an angel. He said do
[16:02] you think you could show me my angel if
[16:04] I've got one? You know he wasn't sure
[16:06] whether he did or not I guess. And so
[16:09] that night he was he was uh he was in
[16:12] bed and uh he was asleep. He woke up cuz
[16:15] there's a light in the room. He thought,
[16:17] "Oh, my mom had left the you know so big
[16:21] left the light on." So he woke up and
[16:23] looked and there at the end of end of
[16:25] the bed was a he said a really big guy
[16:28] with his arm crossed looking at him and
[16:30] dad just said I got real scared. He said
[16:32] Lord that's enough. I see nothing. said
[16:34] he just went up through the roof
[16:37] and uh
[16:40] so uh
[16:42] about I guess it was
[16:45] two weeks ago Friday.
[16:48] Um
[16:50] dad we got back from uh we were away for
[16:52] a week on vacation. We got back and I
[16:54] went over to see dad on Saturday when we
[16:56] got back and he said uh I kind of had a
[17:00] vision yesterday I think Rod. And I said
[17:02] well what happened? He said
[17:06] well he said I heard the doorbell ring
[17:09] and uh he said uh he said and a voice
[17:14] came he said when when mom answered the
[17:16] door voice came and said I'm here to
[17:19] take Lindber home and he said I looked
[17:22] around the corner it was the same guy
[17:24] I'd seen 15 years ago
[17:26] &gt;&gt; standing at the edge of my bed so you
[17:29] know I just knew his time to go you
[17:31] didn't you know you knew how to pray I
[17:33] And I really thank everyone. Just before
[17:35] he passed on, my brother, you know, was
[17:38] uh sitting there with him. He says,
[17:39] "Dad, are you in pain?"
[17:42] No. Are you comfortable?
[17:44] Yeah. He couldn't talk cuz he's just so
[17:46] weak. And he said, "Uh, is your mind
[17:49] sharp?"
[17:51] You know, and he was uh he was just gone
[17:53] a few hours later. So, we're just
[17:54] thankful, you know. I I mean, I'm happy
[17:57] cuz he's he's over on the other side.
[17:59] you know, you just are thankful for uh
[18:02] for those little things God gives you.
[18:04] And um you know, Brother Biscll sent me
[18:06] a little email on uh on Wednesday. I
[18:10] just, you know, so thankful for the
[18:12] confirmations God gives.
[18:14] It was scripture Job 14. And I turned on
[18:18] I got my Bible on my little Blackberry.
[18:20] I turned the Blackberry on and uh cuz
[18:23] I've been reading the Bible on uh
[18:25] Tuesday evening after dad had died and
[18:28] uh I was in the same chapter that
[18:29] brother Ed had had directed me to. So
[18:31] just thankful for God's God's direction
[18:33] and confirmation. Amen, brother Mike.
[18:37] Bless the Lord.
[18:40] Just so wonderful to have the
[18:41] confirmation of the Lord. I wanted to
[18:44] read you a scripture uh before I sang.
[18:47] Um it's uh we've been reading out of
[18:49] Romans 8 uh our pastor has and this is
[18:53] Romans 8:20 uh 29 and 30 for whom he did
[18:57] forno he did predestinate to be
[19:00] conformed into the image of his son that
[19:02] they might be
[19:04] the firstborn among many brethren.
[19:07] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[19:10] he also called, and whom he did call,
[19:13] them he also justified. And to whom he
[19:16] justified, them he also glorified.
[19:20] And it just um it just shows to us that
[19:24] it's uh it's all God. It's none of us.
[19:29] Um, this song I wrote it several years
[19:31] ago and it was in a in a kind of a
[19:34] perplexed time in my life when uh you
[19:37] have that uncertainty, you know, uh, am
[19:41] I going to make it? Am I bride? And the
[19:43] devil comes to you all the time with
[19:44] that. Um, but um, this was kind of a a
[19:49] rebuke to me and it could be to you, but
[19:52] at the same time was a comfort uh,
[19:55] because it's all him. And uh I just
[19:57] wanted to sing it for the glory of the
[19:59] Lord.
[20:17] [Music]

[28:35] also offerings during this service. Uh,
[28:38] the camp meetings. The first two nights
[28:41] are going to be for the camp expense.
[28:44] We have expenses dur during the camp. We
[28:47] like to have those. There are some that
[28:49] can't afford to come, but we want the
[28:52] children to be there. And uh that's all
[28:55] there's to all the young people. We want
[28:56] them to be there. And so you'll give
[28:59] towards those expenses the first two
[29:01] nights. And Saturday night, I have felt
[29:04] to take a missionary offering. We're
[29:07] going to take up a missionary offering
[29:08] for the missions on Saturday night. And
[29:11] on Sunday morning will be our regular
[29:13] tithes and offerings. So, uh, Thursday,
[29:16] Friday, and Saturday, as brother Rod has
[29:18] already announced, at 7 p.m. and Sunday
[29:21] at 10:30, I want you to be praying for
[29:24] the speaker, Brother Ron Spencer. Uh uh
[29:28] probably if he were just judging
[29:31] everything from the natural man because
[29:35] he spent he he was in the hospital a few
[29:37] days uh about a week in fact just about
[29:41] 3 weeks ago or so a month ago and uh
[29:45] meetings like this are a great strain on
[29:48] a on a person. So, we want to be praying
[29:51] for the man of God because you you come
[29:54] to service sometime you say, "Oh, the
[29:56] devil has just really fought me." Well,
[29:58] just imagine how he fights a minister.
[30:01] Imagine how he's fighting this guy right
[30:03] now. So, you're in you're in prayer,
[30:05] aren't you?
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; There's about 30 of our congregation
[30:10] that are down there at the camp right
[30:11] now. They feel very very bad to miss the
[30:13] service this morning, but they're
[30:15] getting things set up and it was
[30:17] necessary to to start today because we
[30:20] have to be out the following Sunday. All
[30:22] right, let's just sing this. This is
[30:24] your house. Dedicate ourselves to the
[30:26] Lord and we're going to be turning to
[30:28] the word right away.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; This is your house.
[30:36] Father
[30:38] and
[30:41] this is your house.
[30:47] A holy house of prayer
[30:51] where the lost and lonely
[30:56] bring their
[30:59] tears. This is your house.
[31:05] This is your house.
[31:10] Come and watch the course. Oh, this is
[31:15] your house.
[31:19] Oh, father.
[31:24] This is your house.
[31:29] It's a holy house of prayer
[31:34] where the lost and lonely
[31:39] bring their burdens and their cares.
[31:43] This is your house.
[31:48] This is your house.
[31:52] would come and dwell
[31:57] in prayer now. Lovely Lord Jesus,
[32:02] we say with everything that is within
[32:04] us, oh God, this is your house.
[32:07] Come and dwell. That is the invitation.
[32:11] And you have already told us, I will be
[32:13] in you. We believe that to be the case.
[32:17] You are in us by your living Holy Spirit
[32:23] dwelling in us and we in you, you and
[32:28] the father and we are one. Oh God, thank
[32:32] you for the revelation of your word, the
[32:34] knowing, the understanding of it. And I
[32:37] pray that you'll come this morning in
[32:39] all of your beauty and all of your
[32:42] loveliness.
[32:44] Come, oh God. I pray you'll touch every
[32:47] life that is gathered here, every life
[32:51] under the sound of my voice. And I pray
[32:54] it will be the Holy Spirit that will be
[32:56] the minister. I pray, oh God, we'll just
[32:59] be an oracle, a useful tool in your
[33:03] hands. And I pray, Father, that the
[33:06] needs which are many, those that are
[33:09] afflicted,
[33:10] oh God, just coming to service this
[33:14] morning, feeling the burden for those
[33:16] that are in need, not only physically
[33:19] but emotionally and spiritually, those
[33:22] that may be bound. May the divine power
[33:26] of almighty mighty God strike those that
[33:29] are in prison, oh God, and burst the
[33:32] prison bars of and bring the captive
[33:36] out, oh God, by the power of the word.
[33:40] Let no bondage of the enemy be able to
[33:42] withstand, I pray, Lord, the power of
[33:46] your word today. Bless your people.
[33:49] Anoint me, Father. anoint the hearers
[33:52] and we will be careful to give you all
[33:54] the praise in Jesus' name. Amen.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I would like you to
[34:02] turn in your Bibles if you would please
[34:04] to mark the 10th chapter.
[34:11] We're going to begin reading at the 17th
[34:13] verse.
[34:17] And then I will read also a few verses
[34:20] from John 14
[34:24] from the 17th verse of Mark 10. And when
[34:27] he was gone forth into the way, there
[34:30] came one running and kneeling kneelled
[34:32] to him and asked him, good master, what
[34:35] shall I do that I may inherit eternal
[34:38] life? And Jesus said unto him, why
[34:41] callst thou me good? There is none good
[34:43] but one that is God. Thou knowest the
[34:47] commandments. Do not commit adultery. Do
[34:50] not kill. Do not steal. Do not bear
[34:53] false witness. Defraud not. Honor thy
[34:57] father and mother. And he answered and
[35:00] said unto him, Master, all these have I
[35:03] observed from my youth. Then Jesus
[35:06] beholding him loved him. And said unto
[35:09] him, One thing thou lackest. Go thy way.
[35:13] Sell whatsoever thou hast and give to
[35:16] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[35:19] heaven and come take up the cross and
[35:23] follow me. And he was sad at that saying
[35:27] and went away grieved for he had great
[35:31] possessions.
[35:33] Then please in John the 14th chapter
[35:42] verses 1-6.
[35:50] Let not your heart be troubled. You
[35:53] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[35:56] my father's house are many mansions. If
[35:58] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[36:02] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[36:04] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[36:07] come again and receive you unto myself,
[36:10] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[36:14] And whether I go, you know, and the way
[36:17] you know. Thomas said unto him, Lord, we
[36:20] know not whether thou goest, and how can
[36:23] we know the way? Jesus sth unto him, I
[36:28] am the way, the truth, and the life. No
[36:31] man cometh unto the father but by me.
[36:35] May God bless his word to us. So you
[36:37] have your seats.
[36:42] As you that have been attending the
[36:45] services here know well, I have been
[36:48] speaking in from the last four services
[36:52] uh that brother Brandham preached and
[36:54] they've been really astounding to
[36:56] myself.
[36:59] Uh this 14th chapter was the second last
[37:02] service and Mark 10 was the last
[37:06] service.
[37:08] Now I have been speaking the last this
[37:11] is the third service I want to speak on
[37:15] your identification for rapture your
[37:18] identification for rapture. We've been
[37:21] taking those that are not merely types
[37:24] but we have strengthened that very very
[37:26] substantially by saying that the same
[37:30] spirit the same holy spirit of God that
[37:34] caused the people prophets to speak
[37:37] certain things and caused them also to
[37:40] do certain things. They lived uh they
[37:43] lived a certain life. They lived and
[37:45] acted out certain events and those
[37:47] events were actually prophetic
[37:51] uh of of uh something that was going to
[37:54] take place. Something that they did on
[37:56] an individual basis is going to happen
[37:59] or is taking place now or has taken
[38:02] place on a on an entire uh uh group of
[38:07] people called not only a church but a
[38:10] bride of Jesus Christ. There were brides
[38:12] in the Old Testament that are distinct
[38:14] type of the bride right now. But we
[38:16] wanted to strengthen the fact that they
[38:19] are not just a type or a shadow, but it
[38:22] was the spirit that was in them
[38:25] &gt;&gt; actually lived out a prophecy and the
[38:29] same spirit now in you is fulfilling
[38:32] that prophecy. And that's very important
[38:36] because that gives the true meaning of
[38:39] identification.
[38:41] Identification as we have been
[38:43] establishing is the act or process of
[38:48] showing to be the same. Not to be like
[38:52] but to be the same. Not that the that
[38:55] that life back there in in Rebecca or
[38:58] that life life back there in Ruth or
[39:01] that life back there in Enoch or because
[39:04] Enoch the seventh from Adam is a type of
[39:06] the bride and uh the bride is typed all
[39:10] the way through.
[39:12] We're not like that. It is the same
[39:14] spirit, the same life. And that that's
[39:18] the only way you can look back by
[39:21] knowing the spirit that is living out
[39:24] through you. You look back and can
[39:27] identify not I am like that but that was
[39:30] me.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; The same as Christ was in Abraham.
[39:34] Christ was in Isaac. Christ was in
[39:37] Moses. Christ was in David. Christ was
[39:40] in the the kings and the prophets. It
[39:44] was Christ in him in them that was
[39:47] reflecting that portion of his life that
[39:50] he would live out. And that is why he
[39:52] could look back and quote those
[39:54] scriptures and say they must be
[39:56] fulfilled.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; He was now fulfilling those.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; And as I said and it bears repeating,
[40:03] John the Baptist is asked now great
[40:06] group of people have come out to hear
[40:08] him. Who are you? Well, he he could have
[40:11] said, uh, you know, you know my father,
[40:14] you know my mother, you've seen me, you
[40:17] know, uh, I've lived here amongst you,
[40:19] you know who I am. No, he said, I am the
[40:22] voice, not I am like the voice, I am the
[40:25] voice of one crying in the wilderness.
[40:28] That spirit that was speaking there
[40:30] spoke of me. And that same spirit that
[40:33] was in Isaiah when he said it is the
[40:35] same spirit that is here now living it
[40:37] out. He spoke it. I'm living it.
[40:40] Amen. I said they lived it in a shadow.
[40:42] We're living it in a reality. They lived
[40:45] it in the negative. We're living it in
[40:47] the positive. But it's the same spirit
[40:50] all the time.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; That is identification.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; When you take out that uh photo in your
[40:56] passport, that is me.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not like me, that's me.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; And we also thought uh and spoke. I
[41:05] think it's also significant. It is
[41:07] timesensitive.
[41:09] That's right.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You can't show your baby picture at the
[41:11] passport office.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; You can't go to the border with your
[41:15] baby picture.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; It won't have very much resemblance for
[41:19] most of us at least.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; It's got to be current.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; So, we're not here talking about what we
[41:26] were 20 years ago or 10 years ago. We're
[41:29] talking about what we are now.
[41:31] Identifying where we are now. This is a
[41:34] moving living word.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. denominations and maybe and those
[41:39] in the message can look back and say,
[41:40] "Oh, you know, we're not just talking
[41:42] about what the message was 40 years
[41:43] ago." We're talking about what the
[41:45] message is today.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; And we have to be able to identify
[41:49] ourselves and say, "I am that."
[41:54] &gt;&gt; One thing that you want to be able to
[41:57] identify
[41:59] and that is
[42:01] this last service I thought so
[42:03] significant. The last service
[42:06] prophet is laying down leadership.
[42:10] I want to speak about identify
[42:15] leadership for your rapture.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; You need to identify leadership.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Opinions
[42:24] are plentiful.
[42:26] Opinions are cheap. Anybody can give an
[42:30] opinion, give advice, tell you what they
[42:33] think. But then when disaster strikes,
[42:37] &gt;&gt; who you going to nail it to? Who you
[42:38] going to pin it to?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; But God has granted leadership.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; And I thought that was that is so
[42:45] astounding that that would be the last
[42:48] service.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation,
[42:56] that is something. And I'm going to
[42:58] speak in all sincerity
[43:01] this morning once again. I I have felt a
[43:03] different just a different angle on my
[43:06] whole entire ministry. In fact, during
[43:08] this time and I'm going to just speak
[43:11] easy. I'm just going to speak as God
[43:14] enables me. I'm going to say really
[43:16] what's on my heart. I've been speaking
[43:18] the meetings as though they're my last
[43:21] each time. I said, "What do I want to
[43:23] say to this congregation?" I want to say
[43:26] this to you this morning.
[43:29] You might be able to afford some measure
[43:32] of error in the kind of advice, the kind
[43:36] of counsel
[43:38] that you get, the kind of leadership
[43:40] that you take. I'm going to be speaking
[43:41] about leadership, but you cannot afford
[43:43] any error in leadership for the rapture.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot afford any guesses. So,
[43:50] &gt;&gt; you can't afford to be influenced.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Influence is also leadership. And I want
[43:56] to speak about this. Brother Brandham
[43:58] said in leadership, now I don't want you
[44:01] I don't want you to take this just as
[44:02] quotes out of a message,
[44:05] &gt;&gt; but that he's laying out he's actually
[44:08] laying out the seeds of what you need
[44:12] &gt;&gt; to enter into the rapture.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; And he said because the people didn't
[44:16] understand it, I'm sure he said, "I have
[44:18] a message I feel from God. It's a little
[44:22] odd to some people and I can't help
[44:25] being no more. He said, I just got to be
[44:28] what I am. I don't mean to be different.
[44:31] It's just that I am living at a changing
[44:35] time. And I thought, how incredible in
[44:38] his last service to say, I am living at
[44:41] a changing time.
[44:46] when Jesus was telling the disciples and
[44:49] once again he's they're sensing that
[44:52] something is happening. They're sensing
[44:54] that a changing time is coming even in
[44:56] his in the ministry of Jesus Christ
[44:59] because he's speaking different and I
[45:02] can say and he can't say anything
[45:04] different. He has to say what he's
[45:06] saying because he's at that time. He's
[45:08] at that season. He has to tell them
[45:10] don't be troubled.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Let not your heart be troubled. You
[45:14] believe in God. believe also in me and
[45:17] in my father's house are many mansions
[45:20] and I go now this was this was this was
[45:23] not accustomed they weren't accustomed
[45:25] to hearing this I go
[45:30] &gt;&gt; where are you going I go to prepare a
[45:33] place for you and if I go
[45:35] &gt;&gt; it's got I go I go I go
[45:41] where are you going
[45:44] this was the one who came by their way
[45:47] and said follow me
[45:50] &gt;&gt; and they did and they left all and they
[45:54] followed they left father they left
[45:55] mother and you have also
[45:58] &gt;&gt; many of you have left your way of life
[46:01] you left even your uh perhaps your uh
[46:05] your your job your profession some have
[46:09] &gt;&gt; some have left families some have left
[46:13] friends and associates and whatever Ever
[46:15] more they've left. Many of you here have
[46:17] left the everything that you knew. Like
[46:20] Abraham, your father, you left your
[46:22] culture. You left what was comfortable
[46:25] to you. You left your environment that
[46:27] you knew and was and you felt stable.
[46:30] You left your comfort zone
[46:33] &gt;&gt; and you you were thrown to the wind as
[46:35] it were. You jumped over the cliff as it
[46:37] were and then hoped you could swim after
[46:39] you jumped in. You cast yourself
[46:43] &gt;&gt; into the at the mercy of God said I
[46:46] don't know but I have heard something
[46:49] and I must go this way
[46:52] you find your type and Rebecca and uh
[46:55] once Eleer found her he said I cannot
[46:59] wait they said well delay give us a few
[47:01] days at least give her at least 10 days
[47:04] he was a stranger just came in and and
[47:06] simply because of the act of of Rebecca
[47:09] watering ing uh giving him to drink and
[47:12] then watering all of the camels. And
[47:14] incidentally, this was a very remarkable
[47:16] thing. Camels, as you know, hold a lot
[47:18] of water to begin with. But that wasn't
[47:20] all. Ele was not by himself. He had men
[47:25] traveling with him and they sat by while
[47:29] this woman refreshed the word of God.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; While she refreshed and did you say the
[47:36] word of God? Yes. because Alzar had
[47:38] already prayed.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Let the woman who who waters the camels,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that was the word of God.
[47:46] And the prophet said she watered the
[47:48] very word that carried her back to
[47:50] Isaac.
[47:52] [Applause]
[47:54] &gt;&gt; You didn't know it. She didn't know she
[47:56] was refreshing the word. She didn't know
[47:58] she was refreshing the power she was
[48:00] going to ride on to go back to Isaac.
[48:03] You didn't know when you responded the
[48:05] way that you did. You didn't know that
[48:07] you were actually refreshing.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; The word of God,
[48:11] &gt;&gt; which is Christ.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; He's pleased with what he saw.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; We didn't know it and you've left and
[48:21] departed. It was the same Jesus. It must
[48:24] have comforted them
[48:26] to hear him say as they stood by and
[48:29] watched him minister. And he'd say to
[48:31] the Pharisees which were at him one day
[48:36] and he said, "You're from beneath
[48:40] and I'm from above.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; You're of this world. I am not of this
[48:46] world." And they absorbed that. They
[48:49] took that in. But they had been called
[48:51] by him to follow him. So they were just
[48:54] following along. He's not of this. They
[48:56] were hearing strange things. He's not of
[48:59] this world. He's of another world. His
[49:02] kingdom is not of this world. It's of
[49:04] another world. They don't know anything
[49:05] about that world. All they're doing is
[49:07] following him. They're following him
[49:09] through the great miracles and the signs
[49:11] and the astounding things and they're
[49:13] identified with it. All they know this
[49:15] is the master. This is our Lord. This is
[49:18] the Messiah. We're following him.
[49:21] Hallelujah. We're following him. And now
[49:23] he starts to say, you know, I I go.
[49:28] Where are you going? We're the ones
[49:30] who've committed ourselves to you. We're
[49:32] the ones who've given up everything. We
[49:35] We We've left our We've left our
[49:37] incomes. We've left our jobs. We've left
[49:40] our fishing behind and our boats and our
[49:43] nets. We've left it all.
[49:46] Where is it you're going? Well, he said,
[49:48] "Well, you know the way, but we don't
[49:52] know the way."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "I am the way. Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; I'm the way and I'm the truth.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; I tell you it it was an answer but it
[50:04] didn't completely answer. They were
[50:06] caught into the vortex of a rapid uh
[50:10] fulfillment of events one after the
[50:12] other and they saw him coming into
[50:14] judgment. They saw him betrayed. They
[50:16] saw him before pilot. They saw him in
[50:18] the sentence. And surely there must be
[50:20] coming uh uh uh some kind of a release,
[50:23] some kind of a great mighty deliverance
[50:25] because it's impossible that all of this
[50:27] happens and the whole thing is caught in
[50:29] a vortex and their leader
[50:32] is being ripped away from them.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; We've given everything to follow this
[50:38] this one, this Jesus of Nazareth,
[50:42] this God man,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; this man that spake like no other man.
[50:48] Oh, how can he be taken from us? And the
[50:52] prophet has gone to that for leadership
[50:56] because
[50:59] of the rich young man which we'll come
[51:00] to in a few moments.
[51:04] It was Jesus who had said to them,
[51:08] "Follow me and I'm going to make you
[51:10] fishers of men." And the word that Jesus
[51:12] used was, "Come hither.
[51:17] Come here and come now.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; That word has such emphasis. It's so
[51:22] potent. It's pregnant with meaning.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Come, follow me.
[51:27] Follow me." He's saying, "Come here.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Come now," it comes with exclamation
[51:34] marks, I tell you, God, he expects us to
[51:37] move
[51:38] &gt;&gt; and to move quickly.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; We're not here to sit and weigh
[51:42] everything out. But when he speaks to
[51:45] you and I feel that this meeting today
[51:48] is a part of the camp meeting.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; We've been in a camp meeting for some
[51:52] days here now and this is in
[51:54] preparation. I feel it's just moving on
[51:56] up. I have no idea what brother
[51:59] Spencer's going to be ministering on.
[52:01] But I feel that this is I have felt a
[52:04] great anticipation for this family camp
[52:06] more so than any other that we've ever
[52:08] had. It's about 19 years now or 20
[52:11] years. And and I feel more anticipation
[52:14] because I feel that God has been moving
[52:16] us into a realm, moving us into a
[52:19] sphere, friends. We ought to be able to
[52:21] receive a whole lot more than we could
[52:23] last year.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Follow me. Come here and
[52:29] come now."
[52:31] The simplicity of this call
[52:35] &gt;&gt; did not require
[52:37] any interpretation. Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't need that deciphered.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't need to look around at one
[52:43] another and say, "What did he mean?"
[52:47] &gt;&gt; The Lord speaks to us in such
[52:49] simplicity.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; When we get it, you know, we often
[52:53] complicate it.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Well, how will we do it and this and
[52:56] that and all we begin to we we begin to
[52:59] weigh out all the things that are around
[53:00] us. Forget all of those things. If he
[53:03] says come, that's the thing to do.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And when should I do it? Do it now. Do
[53:08] it with everything that's in you. Do it
[53:09] with all the energy you have. I will
[53:11] come and follow you.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; But then when Jesus
[53:18] he began to speak further,
[53:21] verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[53:24] enterth not in by the door into the
[53:26] sheepfold, but climbth up some other
[53:28] way, the same as a thief and a robber.
[53:30] But he that enterth in by the door is
[53:32] the shepherd of the sheep. And to him
[53:34] the porter openeth, and the sheep hear
[53:37] his voice. And he calleth his own sheep
[53:40] by name, and leadth them out. And they
[53:43] heard these things, and they said, "Oh,
[53:46] how wonderful to have such a shepherd is
[53:49] this."
[53:50] &gt;&gt; How wonderful it is not only to be
[53:52] following, but to be led.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Those are two things. One can lead, but
[53:57] they have to have somebody follow. He
[53:59] says, "But
[54:01] &gt;&gt; the sheep follow me." Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; He leadth them out and they follow him.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus was establishing. And when he
[54:12] puteth forth his own sheep, and he goeth
[54:15] before them, and the sheep follow him,
[54:19] for they know his voice. What a comfort.
[54:22] And a stranger they will not follow,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; but will flee from him, for they know
[54:29] not the voice of strangers. In other
[54:32] words, the sheep recognize the voice of
[54:35] the shepherd and they follow him. It
[54:38] doesn't they just hear his voice, but
[54:40] they follow him.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; There's a further aspect
[54:47] to this
[54:49] word follow. A further aspect to what
[54:52] was in the mind of Jesus when he said
[54:55] come and follow me. The further aspect
[54:58] of this call that is also in included in
[55:02] these words follow me and here's the
[55:05] further aspect it's not only just come
[55:08] come hither and come now
[55:10] but it is come from a further compound
[55:13] word come hither to this place
[55:19] in an urging and calling
[55:23] to come here. It is to come to this
[55:26] place. And so Jesus as he first met his
[55:28] disciples says, "Follow me. I'll make
[55:30] you fishers of men." And as they
[55:32] followed in further on, he said, "I'm
[55:35] the good shepherd. My sheep hear my
[55:37] voice." Oh, said that's us. We identify
[55:41] with that.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; But further in the depths of the mind of
[55:46] Christ was when he said, "Follow me." He
[55:49] didn't just intend to take them to feed
[55:51] the 5,000 on the hillside on the grassy
[55:54] slopes. He didn't mean to just follow
[55:57] him along the seashore of Galilee and to
[56:00] catch a, you know, to to uh bring them
[56:03] from their fishing occupation. He didn't
[56:06] mean just that. He meant because Christ
[56:08] knew where he came from. He's going back
[56:11] to and now he's simply here on a mission
[56:14] to gather that the those that are going
[56:16] to give birth to the early church and he
[56:19] also is going to enlighten them to
[56:21] reveal to them I when I said to you
[56:24] follow me the intent is I'm taking you
[56:27] to another place
[56:31] &gt;&gt; and he comes to this and a prophet comes
[56:34] to this very verse these very verses
[56:39] for his last mission, his last words
[56:44] before his lips are sealed.
[56:47] And this is what God in Luke 17:30 in
[56:52] the revealing of the son of man. The son
[56:54] of man is saying these last things
[56:57] before nothing more will be uttered.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; And it is, is it significant? It's more
[57:03] significant than anybody in this
[57:05] building will ever realize.
[57:10] And a prophet is taking a young man. And
[57:12] I'm so glad for our young people that
[57:15] are going to be going to camp. I'm
[57:17] preparing you for some great things.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Come follow me. Come quickly. Come now
[57:30] and you'll come hither
[57:32] &gt;&gt; to this place.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] You know,
[57:39] you're not even where you used to be a
[57:41] short time ago. Everything's changed for
[57:43] you.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; Your whole environment,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; your whole your whole character,
[57:49] everything's changed. When Jesus came
[57:51] and first uttered these words, "Come and
[57:53] follow me. Follow me and I'll make you
[57:55] fishers of men." They were bound by
[57:57] tradition. They were keeping all the
[58:00] laws and they all the all the law of the
[58:04] Old Testament and keeping all of those
[58:06] as Rabbi Richmond talks about 613 laws
[58:08] and they keep all those laws and all
[58:10] those rituals and that's all they knew
[58:13] washing of hands and washing of pots and
[58:16] pans and and the cooking a certain way
[58:18] and absolutely everything to a certain
[58:20] letter and now they begin they begin to
[58:23] walk into a release from that begin to
[58:27] see all that There's only a only a
[58:29] picture of a shadow of something to come
[58:32] and realizing now even the Passover lamb
[58:35] here's the lamb of God for John who was
[58:38] a voice of one crying in the wilderness
[58:40] said behold the lamb of God. Oh the
[58:43] whole world is taking on a different
[58:45] meaning.
[58:47] this one we're following is completely
[58:49] different and we're being we're walking
[58:52] into a new world and he actually shall
[58:54] we say in in a in I don't want to be
[58:57] scientific but in an emotional
[59:01] their whole psychological aspect of
[59:04] their whole life changed
[59:07] &gt;&gt; and they found themselves in another
[59:09] place
[59:10] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham said they could in
[59:12] no wise go back
[59:14] &gt;&gt; to where they were. And I say anybody
[59:18] who has actually been birthed by this
[59:20] word, you're spoiled forever.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; There is no way you can go back to where
[59:28] you were. You'll be the most miserable
[59:31] person on the face of the earth. You
[59:34] cannot know this kind of deliverance,
[59:37] this kind of richness of the word of
[59:40] God. You cannot you cannot have absorbed
[59:42] this message and and go back to what you
[59:45] were feeding on before.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; I say never.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Never.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; You and a good number of you were
[59:55] Catholics. Go back. Can you go back and
[59:58] kiss your idols and hold your medals
[1:00:00] around your neck and twirl your beads?
[1:00:02] You can never do it.
[1:00:05] You can never go back to the life in the
[1:00:07] world and your drugs and your drink and
[1:00:10] all the rest of it and the little uh uh
[1:00:13] superficial uh you know circles and
[1:00:16] parties and all of that nonsense. It's
[1:00:18] empty.
[1:00:20] It's vain.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; It's gone and gone forever.
[1:00:26] And you're in another place. You're in
[1:00:29] another place. He's already moved you
[1:00:32] into another place. I'm hither to this
[1:00:35] place.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; You're ruined.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; As far as the world is concerned.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; God in his grace
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; and his abundant mercy has taken and
[1:00:52] already moved you.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; You have followed him.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Seated here today. His just a multitude
[1:01:01] of miracles.
[1:01:03] Oh, brother Mike, sister Debbie, it's
[1:01:06] not just a miracle in the making. It's
[1:01:08] miracles that have already happened.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And it is a miracle in the making.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; You are a miracle.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil or anybody else say
[1:01:19] anything otherwise.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; You're a miracle.
[1:01:29] He said, "And will the church go through
[1:01:31] the tribulation or will the church go
[1:01:33] before the tribulation?"
[1:01:36] He said, "Well, I've heard that before.
[1:01:38] You might say, you might hear it your
[1:01:41] last time. Let this be the time." He
[1:01:44] said, and he was asking people to raise
[1:01:46] their hands. Said, "God bless them. God
[1:01:49] bless you."
[1:01:51] He said, "Don't be included in the
[1:01:53] world. You get out of there."
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; God's coming for his church and he's
[1:01:58] chose you and that's the reason he's
[1:02:01] speaking to you. He said the message is
[1:02:04] urgent. Come quickly.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; You might be here and have not made a
[1:02:10] maybe you've been even in this church
[1:02:12] for months or years and haven't made the
[1:02:15] kind of commitment. And I say the
[1:02:17] message is urgent. It's more urgent
[1:02:19] today than it's ever been.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Come quickly.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Come follow.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; The true leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; You can't afford to error on this one.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; You can take a lot of advice, hear a lot
[1:02:37] of opinions,
[1:02:39] hear perhaps a lot of criticism and
[1:02:41] faultf finding, and I'll enlarge on that
[1:02:43] later on, but find out where it's going
[1:02:45] to take you first.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you want to find the
[1:02:48] leadership? You say, "What is the
[1:02:49] leadership?" The leadership is the
[1:02:51] angel. I'll send an angel before you.
[1:02:53] That's our type.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; I'll send an angel before you and he
[1:02:58] will lead you in the way
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and you'll find a woman and that woman
[1:03:02] will come. And the prophet said the
[1:03:04] angel of the Lord will persuade her. You
[1:03:08] have been persuaded. You've already come
[1:03:09] under the influence of the angel of the
[1:03:12] Lord and he has persuaded you.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:18] That's the leadership.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Not somebody that sat in the church
[1:03:22] persuaded you, but the angel of the Lord
[1:03:25] persuaded you. Said, "Well, I heard I
[1:03:27] heard a message preached delivered by a
[1:03:30] servant of God." That is right. But that
[1:03:32] message first came from the angel of the
[1:03:34] Lord, which is the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:03:36] down to his prophet, messenger, and from
[1:03:39] there to the ministry, and the ministry
[1:03:41] picks it up. Otherwise, we don't have a
[1:03:43] message.
[1:03:47] That's how the angel of the Lord speaks
[1:03:48] to you.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; You can have all kinds of people say,
[1:03:56] "Well, I think it ought to be this way.
[1:03:58] I think it ought." We're not into I
[1:03:59] think it should be this way.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; We're interested under the foolishness
[1:04:03] of the preaching of the gospel.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And it may be haltingly. It may be even
[1:04:09] with incorrect words or whatever more.
[1:04:11] And in weakness, his strength is made
[1:04:13] perfect. Amen.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; When Jesus began to tell his disciples
[1:04:22] of his going away to prepare a place for
[1:04:25] them, they could not understand it. In
[1:04:29] his final hours of teaching, the subject
[1:04:31] of following became very difficult to
[1:04:34] understand.
[1:04:38] I go
[1:04:40] to prepare a place for you.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; They couldn't grasp that. And if I go
[1:04:45] and prepare a place for you, I will come
[1:04:48] again.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; This was this was for us 2,000 years
[1:04:53] down. For them, totally different.
[1:04:55] You've been following him. Now, put
[1:04:56] yourself there. You've been walking with
[1:04:58] them. You're going Well, they also knew
[1:05:01] that he'd been born there and and
[1:05:03] raised.
[1:05:05] And they walked with him and they ate
[1:05:07] with him and they slept with him. He
[1:05:08] said, "I'm going away and I'm coming
[1:05:09] back and I'll receive you." And all of
[1:05:12] this set them in a blur.
[1:05:15] They didn't understand that. And whether
[1:05:17] I go, you know, and the way you know.
[1:05:19] Says,
[1:05:21] James, do you do you, Peter? Do do you,
[1:05:24] John? Do you do you understand that?
[1:05:26] Whether I go, you know, and the way you
[1:05:28] know. All we've been doing is following
[1:05:30] him for three over three years.
[1:05:34] This is mysterious. And Thomas, he got
[1:05:37] enough courage says that Lord, we know
[1:05:40] not whether thou goest. We don't know
[1:05:41] where you're going. And if we don't know
[1:05:44] where you're going, how do we know the
[1:05:45] way? They knew one thing that they had
[1:05:48] to be following him.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; There was no other choice. They had to
[1:05:51] be following him. We don't know where
[1:05:53] you're going. And if we don't know where
[1:05:54] you're going, how can we know the way?
[1:06:02] Perhaps they thought
[1:06:04] you've led us all this time and we have
[1:06:07] followed you and now we do not know
[1:06:10] where you're going. Then how are we
[1:06:12] going to go to that place? How are we
[1:06:14] going to go?
[1:06:17] When he said I go,
[1:06:20] that also had depth to it. And you need
[1:06:23] to understand, you need to know. I need
[1:06:25] to know. And I've been pondering this
[1:06:27] now. And I've been in these messages for
[1:06:30] some weeks,
[1:06:32] actually some years, but some weeks for
[1:06:34] these services.
[1:06:36] He said, "I go." That is a that's a
[1:06:39] wonderful word. I go, but the actual
[1:06:41] word in the Greek is to lead over.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I go, but the purpose of my going is to
[1:06:48] lead you over.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; To continue on one's journey.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet in his second last
[1:06:56] message, things that are to be, third
[1:06:58] last message. He said he was telling
[1:07:00] them,
[1:07:02] this is in John 14, he's in reference to
[1:07:04] John 14, our scripture reading. He said
[1:07:06] he was telling them in my father's house
[1:07:09] are many mansions. If it were not so, I
[1:07:10] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:07:12] place for you. He was telling them that
[1:07:14] after death there is life because I go
[1:07:18] to prepare a place. He refers to the
[1:07:21] same scripture. He said Jesus. Now here
[1:07:23] we have a prophet describing what the
[1:07:26] Lord Jesus is seeking to bring to them.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And he's seeking also to bring to us
[1:07:32] that afterlife. Now, we listen as this
[1:07:36] this whole generation, this whole
[1:07:37] civilization that we're in, all the
[1:07:39] different peoples of the world believe
[1:07:41] in an afterlife from a happy hunting
[1:07:43] ground that the natives had and uh the
[1:07:46] Muslims they have there uh heaven with
[1:07:48] all the 70 virgins or whatever more. If
[1:07:51] they give themselves in some terrorist
[1:07:53] blast or whatever more and everybody's
[1:07:55] got uh something that is beyond that
[1:07:57] some bliss that is a hoax
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; perpetrated upon humanity that is not
[1:08:04] the case and Jesus in this leadership
[1:08:07] Jesus in these in the in the Bible told
[1:08:10] of the rich young ruler and the prophet
[1:08:12] takes him up and moves him through the
[1:08:14] scripture because there's three accounts
[1:08:17] of a rich young man or or a man who had
[1:08:20] abund abundance. And the last account is
[1:08:22] when he says, "Uh, what'll I do? I've
[1:08:25] increased. My barns are full. I know
[1:08:27] what I'll do." And brother Brandham ties
[1:08:29] him up as the same young man.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; The same young man. And now he's come to
[1:08:35] the end of his life. He's he's now in
[1:08:38] his mature years. I'm going to uh I'll
[1:08:40] tear down my barns and I'll build
[1:08:43] greater. That's what I'll do. And I'll
[1:08:45] lay it up in store. And a and a god
[1:08:47] spoke to him, "Thou fool, this night."
[1:08:50] When was he a fool? He was a fool the
[1:08:53] day he ran to the knee to the feet of
[1:08:55] Jesus and kneel down and said, "What
[1:08:58] must I do?" And Jesus told him, and the
[1:09:00] prophet said, he turned down eternal
[1:09:02] life that day.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; That's when he turned down eternal life.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He said he was confronted with eternal
[1:09:11] life. And he uses those words over and
[1:09:13] over again. He was confronted with
[1:09:16] eternal life.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I want to talk about this young man.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; He's not unlike a whole lot of young men
[1:09:25] and young ladies
[1:09:28] that are here.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I don't say that you are him. I don't
[1:09:34] say that's your identification, but we
[1:09:37] have
[1:09:38] we have some common ground here.
[1:09:43] He said
[1:09:45] as he was a boy, he said probably the
[1:09:47] first hand
[1:09:49] that took him by the hand was this kind
[1:09:54] mother
[1:09:55] and no doubt he said or it may be that
[1:09:57] that mother's hand is laying silent in
[1:09:59] the grave someplace.
[1:10:01] But he said that was the first hand that
[1:10:03] took him and led him in his first steps
[1:10:07] and he had leadership.
[1:10:11] And then she committed him to a teacher,
[1:10:14] a school teacher. And I thought of our
[1:10:17] teachers. I Brother Brennham is relating
[1:10:21] how his upbringing was impeccable.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; His upbringing was right.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; His mother brought him up right. But he
[1:10:30] was just brought up as the people in
[1:10:33] Palestine were brought up and he was
[1:10:36] taught in the religious order. But they
[1:10:38] said then he was given to the teacher. I
[1:10:42] thought of I thought of you young people
[1:10:44] that are here
[1:10:46] and I'm talking about senior young
[1:10:47] people. This young man
[1:10:50] said he was brought up right.
[1:10:54] He had such character. He had such
[1:10:56] integrity.
[1:10:58] He had the right kind of home.
[1:11:02] And then his teacher took him and
[1:11:03] continued to lead him.
[1:11:07] He had a good teacher. He'd been taught
[1:11:08] in everything.
[1:11:11] And he absorbed it. He had the kind of
[1:11:14] mind that could catch it.
[1:11:17] And he was such a fine
[1:11:21] young man,
[1:11:24] one that Jesus looked upon and couldn't
[1:11:26] help but love him. Right?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He had something in him.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; He had an inquiring mind. He He wasn't
[1:11:36] satisfied with just what he had.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And I thought, Lord, are you describing
[1:11:43] in this last service? Are you describing
[1:11:46] some that I'm going to be speaking to
[1:11:47] this morning? They come out of the
[1:11:49] finest of homes.
[1:11:51] They have the finest of mothers,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; the finest of fathers, and perhaps even
[1:11:56] spent seven years in the Bible way
[1:11:58] Christian Academy and had the finest of
[1:12:01] of teachers as far as I'm concerned in
[1:12:03] the world.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; This church ought to be able to say amen
[1:12:08] to that.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; teachers,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; and when you're in a a public school,
[1:12:17] God watched over you and protected you.
[1:12:20] Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; And you're here and you came to the
[1:12:22] house of God and you heard the word of
[1:12:25] God and you're under the influence of
[1:12:27] the word and then would go out of course
[1:12:29] and then you're under the influence of
[1:12:31] friends and your peers and and and the
[1:12:34] world and maybe had a little jobs and
[1:12:36] whatever more and and the whole world
[1:12:38] environment and what the other fellas
[1:12:40] are doing, what the other girls are
[1:12:42] doing and how they dress and how they
[1:12:43] act and how they speak and everything
[1:12:45] else. You don't want to be odd. And so
[1:12:47] you know those those things what really
[1:12:50] what they're doing when we talk about
[1:12:51] influence that's leadership.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; It's starting to lead you in a certain
[1:12:56] direction.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And maybe someone suggested you ought to
[1:13:01] try this or you ought to do this. That's
[1:13:03] leadership.
[1:13:08] And after the teacher was done with him
[1:13:09] and he had his schooling, then he was
[1:13:11] handed back to his father. And his
[1:13:13] father taught him in the ways of the
[1:13:16] ways of life,
[1:13:18] how to conduct himself, how to conduct
[1:13:21] his affairs,
[1:13:23] how to have his business in integrity.
[1:13:26] And he was he could absorb and have such
[1:13:28] retention that he just followed in his
[1:13:31] father's footsteps and came out a very
[1:13:34] successful young man.
[1:13:36] and had gathered
[1:13:38] of this world's possessions.
[1:13:41] Brother Brandham says,
[1:13:44] and he's not speaking of this man here,
[1:13:46] he's speaking of some here.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Say, but he saw something
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; that he wanted.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; He saw something that he knew was real
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; and he wanted it.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; He actually identified it. and he wanted
[1:14:06] it
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; but he says he didn't want the way it
[1:14:11] had to come
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; right
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; that's what he didn't want he didn't
[1:14:14] want the way it didn't it didn't fit him
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; he didn't want the way it had to come
[1:14:19] you know there are many people and
[1:14:20] actually when the prophet was speaking
[1:14:21] this just imagine he's telling the
[1:14:23] people in his last service you see
[1:14:26] something you see a ministry here you
[1:14:29] see the supernatural here you see this
[1:14:31] mighty gift from God here and you know
[1:14:34] it's a of prophet ministry, you know,
[1:14:36] and you want it, you see it, you want
[1:14:38] it, but you don't want it the way it
[1:14:40] come. In other words, you don't want the
[1:14:42] leadership that it came through. You
[1:14:44] don't want this messenger.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "You want what I got, but
[1:14:48] you don't want me."
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what Jesus said.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; That's precisely what he said. Oh, you
[1:14:55] want all the bread and the the loaves
[1:14:58] and the fishes and you want all of that.
[1:15:00] You want I I realize why you want to
[1:15:02] make me a king. You want all these
[1:15:05] benefits. You see the power. You see the
[1:15:08] healing. You see the miracles. You see
[1:15:10] all these things. You want all these
[1:15:12] benefits. But you don't want the way
[1:15:13] it's coming. It's coming in such
[1:15:15] simplicity.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It's coming in in such a fashion. You
[1:15:22] want something that's a little more
[1:15:23] dignified and something that's got a
[1:15:25] little more pizzazz to it.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; I'm using our own language. You want
[1:15:30] something that's a little more, you
[1:15:31] know, glossy and something that's a
[1:15:33] little better and something a little
[1:15:34] finer.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:15:40] we don't want to be spoiled,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; spiritually spoiled.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So, we want better preaching and we want
[1:15:47] better music and we want better singers
[1:15:49] and we want better this and better that.
[1:15:52] I just say, God, give us what he wants
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; and give us how he wants it. give it to
[1:15:58] us in his order. All I want is the power
[1:16:01] of God in the house of God doing the
[1:16:04] will of God. And let God be pleased.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Hey, the congregation say, "Amen."
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; We want lives that are pleasing to him.
[1:16:19] This young man,
[1:16:23] he was
[1:16:25] something that
[1:16:28] the Bible says that Jesus loved about
[1:16:30] him.
[1:16:32] Now he's confronted with this
[1:16:34] leadership.
[1:16:36] He sees it. He wants it.
[1:16:40] I've talked I've prayed with
[1:16:44] lots of people that have come and gone
[1:16:47] in this congregation
[1:16:50] and they see it, they feel it. Brother
[1:16:54] Rod sang, I feel the pull. They have
[1:16:56] felt the pull
[1:16:58] and then they go and settle back and
[1:17:01] weigh it all out. Oh, my friends or my
[1:17:04] family or my boyfriend or my girlfriend
[1:17:06] or my children or my job or my this or
[1:17:08] my that or my
[1:17:12] Who's leading you?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And he asked the question, who's leading
[1:17:17] you now?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; My position or my job or my wife or my
[1:17:24] husband or my friends or my
[1:17:26] circumstances? Who's who's leading you?
[1:17:36] Even,
[1:17:37] you know, we we occasionally we get
[1:17:40] experts
[1:17:42] that come into the church. Brother
[1:17:44] Brandham speaks about them. I've got
[1:17:46] quotes on them
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; and they've got all kinds of advice.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; They can find everything that's wrong
[1:17:52] with the church.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; They can see this is wrong, this is
[1:17:55] wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong. But
[1:17:57] if you looked at them,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; they've never preached a sermon.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; They've never been a deacon. Right?
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; They've never had the burden. Hadn't had
[1:18:06] to go to the hospital, pray for the
[1:18:08] sick. That's right.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; They know nothing about those burdens.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about some of
[1:18:13] them even young men, young women
[1:18:15] perhaps. Young men not have no
[1:18:18] leadership over a home.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Have never fostered children to lead
[1:18:23] children and see all the pain and agony
[1:18:25] that all that. But they're expert on it.
[1:18:28] They can tell me how to preach to that
[1:18:30] the young people need
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; but they've never preached a sermon in
[1:18:33] their life.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And then you know that kind of a person
[1:18:37] always is anxious to advise others
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; on stuff they know nothing about. And I
[1:18:44] say God give you to be aware of that
[1:18:48] kind of thing
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; because when I what I end up with as a
[1:18:54] pastor is wrecks on the side of the road
[1:18:57] and I have to pick up the pieces and
[1:18:59] sometimes I can't put the pieces back
[1:19:01] together. And even if God takes a hold
[1:19:04] of it, they're so wounded, they're so
[1:19:06] marred and they're left in some desolate
[1:19:08] place. Why? Because they took the wrong
[1:19:10] leadership.
[1:19:12] The leadership. You say, "What is the
[1:19:13] leadership?" The leadership is the angel
[1:19:15] of the Lord. The leadership is from him
[1:19:18] to the prophet of the age and from that
[1:19:20] to the ministry.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; And that is God's order. And God will
[1:19:25] never change that order.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Never change that order.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Advice, the world's advice, good
[1:19:33] intending advice.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; It's it's a dime a dozen. You know what
[1:19:37] brother Brandon calls it? Poison.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. He called it poison. Said he'll
[1:19:42] bring someone in in the quietness and
[1:19:44] fellowship with you,
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; fellowship with you and shoot poison.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz it's criticism.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the person that could
[1:19:55] stand up here and I am standing that
[1:19:57] could stand up and say, "You can find no
[1:19:59] fault with my life.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I can find some fault with your life."
[1:20:03] And I found those kind of people even
[1:20:05] when I spoke to them, I speak about what
[1:20:07] about your life. Oh, they don't want to
[1:20:08] talk about that.
[1:20:10] Oh, well, you know, it's these other
[1:20:12] things and it's the other folks and the
[1:20:13] other people.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I tell you, my brother, my sister, that
[1:20:17] kind of a spirit's a demon
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; and it will wreck lives if it can. And
[1:20:23] that is leadership will will never put
[1:20:25] you, hear me, never put you in a
[1:20:28] rapture.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; In fact, it will keep you out of a
[1:20:32] rapture.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; What spirit will put you in a rapture?
[1:20:36] The spirit that you see in Jesus Christ.
[1:20:38] The spirit that you see in the in the
[1:20:41] apostles of the early church and the
[1:20:43] spirit which was displayed in this day
[1:20:45] in the messenger of this hour. This
[1:20:48] message has the power to put the people
[1:20:50] in the rapture. This message is the
[1:20:53] leadership
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; and that's the only leadership.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; It's the last service.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hear me now. It's the last service.
[1:21:03] The prophet spoke leadership
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; and one man ends in heaven and one man
[1:21:07] ends in hell.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; One man accumulated everything he could.
[1:21:12] The other man gave himself and he left
[1:21:15] it and accepted the reproaches of
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; the Christ as more treasure than that of
[1:21:22] the world,
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; more than the power of Egypt, more than
[1:21:25] become a come of Pharaoh
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; of the great superpower of the world. He
[1:21:31] could have been, in other words, he
[1:21:32] could have been the president of the
[1:21:33] United States, a superpower of this age.
[1:21:36] He could have been that president and he
[1:21:38] turned it down.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; He turned it down. Is it where to go to
[1:21:43] Jeffersonville?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; If you want to put it in our language,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; he turned it down. So, you can have your
[1:21:52] White House. You can have your Pentagon.
[1:21:54] You can have your power. I'm going to
[1:21:56] Jeffersonville.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; They're going to Jeffersonville. What in
[1:22:00] the world are you going down there for?
[1:22:01] There's a voice.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; There's a certain sound.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; There's a certain something. There's a
[1:22:08] pillar of fire.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; I've heard a voice.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; I didn't know it. I'm sitting in the
[1:22:21] 19th floor of the Toronto Dominion Tower
[1:22:24] overlooking Lake Ontario and have the I
[1:22:27] think I got the world in my hands
[1:22:30] for this ignorant little fellow from up
[1:22:32] in northern British Columbia. I thought,
[1:22:35] you know, uh things are coming out all
[1:22:37] right.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; At least I don't have to worry about
[1:22:40] where my next meal's coming from for the
[1:22:42] first time in my life. And my kids got,
[1:22:44] you know, the things that they need and
[1:22:46] and everything's coming up roses.
[1:22:48] Driving a nice car and telephone in the
[1:22:51] car. Even back in the 60s, I got a
[1:22:53] telephone in the car. Did they have
[1:22:54] telephones then? Yeah.
[1:23:00] Yeah, we had telephones.
[1:23:02] And God gave me a president that was
[1:23:05] just couldn't do enough for me. Wouldn't
[1:23:07] let me pay for nothing. Wouldn't even
[1:23:09] let me pay for the newspapers. Come in
[1:23:10] my home. We're going to pay the
[1:23:12] newspapers. we're going to you. He said,
[1:23:14] "Buy a house for the company and you
[1:23:16] live in it and I'll talk to the
[1:23:18] accountant and see how cheap we can give
[1:23:19] it to you."
[1:23:22] And he get to give it to the very rock
[1:23:23] bottom. I paid $120 a month for a four
[1:23:27] bedroomedroom, I mean fourlevel brick
[1:23:29] home on a creek bank and terrace back
[1:23:31] down. I Hey,
[1:23:34] I always knew the Lord was, you know, I
[1:23:37] knew it was going to happen someday, but
[1:23:38] I didn't know.
[1:23:42] and I'm just working away and oh,
[1:23:43] everything's just going wonderful. And
[1:23:45] then little voice inside.
[1:23:48] Little voice inside says, "Leave it."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; No, that can't be. That just can't be
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; That can't be the Lord. Can't be this
[1:23:57] confusion. How can I leave it when he
[1:23:59] just gave it to me?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Says, "Leave it."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Leave it. Go west.
[1:24:07] You must return.
[1:24:09] And finally, I had a dream and the dream
[1:24:13] troubled me terribly. And I had a second
[1:24:16] dream and it troubled me terribly. And I
[1:24:20] didn't know if I'd ever get down to see
[1:24:21] Brother Brandham again. But I had such a
[1:24:23] pull that I want to go back west. I I
[1:24:27] thought, well, maybe my f my
[1:24:28] father-in-law may not live too long. I
[1:24:30] didn't know my wife's dad. He'd had this
[1:24:33] heart attack. And
[1:24:36] brother Brandham said he'd be all right.
[1:24:39] I just didn't know what to do.
[1:24:42] And you know how long I struggled? Nine
[1:24:44] months. Nine months. You know, young
[1:24:47] men, young ladies, Brother Biscos knows
[1:24:51] what he's talking about.
[1:24:53] This actually happened. I thought, leave
[1:24:56] this job,
[1:24:58] leave this position, leave. Where am I
[1:25:00] going to live? Where am I going to take
[1:25:02] three children? One just coming into her
[1:25:04] teens. Where am I going to take them? I
[1:25:06] haven't got a clue where I'm going.
[1:25:09] It's not I'm moving to a church or
[1:25:11] something. I don't know. I don't have a
[1:25:12] clue where I'm going.
[1:25:16] And I bought a truck,
[1:25:19] a van. I've never told the congregation
[1:25:21] this. And I loaded all my stuff in that
[1:25:24] van.
[1:25:26] I told the owner of the company I'm
[1:25:29] leaving.
[1:25:31] One of the hardest times of my life. I
[1:25:33] went up to Dawson Creek and spoke at at
[1:25:35] a service there and I was I was doing it
[1:25:40] covertly.
[1:25:41] I didn't want my boss to know I was in
[1:25:43] British Columbia. So, I just flew from
[1:25:46] Toronto and I'm up there having a
[1:25:48] service and he heard and he traced me
[1:25:50] down
[1:25:52] and he says, "I want to see you. Fly to
[1:25:55] Prince George and I'll fly up to Prince
[1:25:57] George and see you. and he got a hotel
[1:26:00] room and we talked about big things. We
[1:26:03] talked about General Motors which I had
[1:26:06] negotiated a contract with and we talked
[1:26:08] about different things and you know
[1:26:09] things going big and finally I had asked
[1:26:13] some brothers to pray for me and I I'm
[1:26:17] certain that brother Brena Langd was
[1:26:19] there that night and prayed for me and I
[1:26:22] thought and I put it to the Lord while
[1:26:24] his brethren are praying if a certain
[1:26:25] thing happens then I'll know that now is
[1:26:28] the time to tell him that I'm done that
[1:26:32] I'm leaving
[1:26:34] and uh
[1:26:37] it did and and the thing was if he got
[1:26:40] if he found out that I was here and I
[1:26:42] had to make contact and he made contact
[1:26:44] and I went there. I don't know why I'm
[1:26:46] telling you this and I flew to Prince
[1:26:48] George
[1:26:50] and we sat there together and we talked
[1:26:52] about other things and finally his name
[1:26:53] was Art. Art Roberts.
[1:26:57] And I said, "Art,
[1:27:00] I'm leaving the company."
[1:27:04] That man
[1:27:07] went to pieces.
[1:27:09] Not because of me. I think just the
[1:27:10] sadness and the shock of it. And he he
[1:27:12] he treated me like a son. And I so
[1:27:15] appreciated it. I could do no wrong. He
[1:27:18] could let me pay no expenses. I went
[1:27:20] preaching. They paid the motel. They
[1:27:21] paid the gas. I didn't pay any expenses.
[1:27:25] I thought, you know, this is God. And
[1:27:27] that's why I was in such a confusion.
[1:27:30] How how do you leave this? You know, how
[1:27:32] do you leave this? I go preaching and
[1:27:34] take take the churches while the pastors
[1:27:36] were away on weekends. There was no
[1:27:38] message churches at the time. We go down
[1:27:40] to Fred Victor Mission. They had about
[1:27:41] 400 425 men meeting there every night.
[1:27:44] And we'd had services there. And the
[1:27:46] girls would sing and we'd have meetings.
[1:27:48] And the leaders come up to me and said,
[1:27:50] "You know, these people, these men, they
[1:27:53] just start coughing and they start
[1:27:54] making a commotion after just 15, 20
[1:27:56] minutes. You can't keep them after 20
[1:27:58] minutes." And I thought, "We're not just
[1:27:59] here to sing. We're here to sing and I'm
[1:28:01] going to preach." And I preached. We had
[1:28:02] the altar full of people. Men seeking
[1:28:05] God. And men came out of there with
[1:28:07] their lives changed
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; and contacted us afterwards. And they
[1:28:11] said, "No one else who comes here has
[1:28:13] those kind of results." Well, we knew
[1:28:14] where it's coming from. we we have some
[1:28:16] knowledge where it's coming from. And I
[1:28:18] said, "Mr. Roberts, I'm leaving."
[1:28:22] And he broke down and he sobbed for an
[1:28:26] hour and a half.
[1:28:28] It was the hardest, one of the hardest
[1:28:29] times of my life. He just sobbed and
[1:28:33] shook till he couldn't speak. I didn't
[1:28:36] know, but I think he already knew he had
[1:28:38] cancer.
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:41] And but I could not change my mind.
[1:28:44] And I gave him five months notice and I
[1:28:47] worked hard as hard and as as honest as
[1:28:50] I could
[1:28:52] and left and had an RCMP officer who was
[1:28:57] on vacation drive the truck out right
[1:29:00] away. If you're going to go God's way,
[1:29:02] you're going to have trouble.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Here he just gets loaded up right to the
[1:29:07] gunnels with this van. And I bought this
[1:29:09] van in an auction. And my boss said to
[1:29:12] me, it was one of the things that it
[1:29:14] didn't pain me, but it stung me at the
[1:29:16] time. He said, "I've lost respect for
[1:29:18] you, Ed.
[1:29:20] Instead of going back first class, you
[1:29:23] know, with a big Allied van and all the
[1:29:25] rest of it, I'm now now I'm starting to
[1:29:28] count my pennies. Now I got to pay for
[1:29:31] things." So, I got this RCMP officer and
[1:29:33] he's going to drive it. He calls me from
[1:29:35] way up northern in the boondocks of
[1:29:37] Ontario and he says, "I blew the motor.
[1:29:41] I blew the motor out of the truck. Now I
[1:29:43] got my stuff stranded northern Ontario
[1:29:46] and I'm going out of a job and it's up
[1:29:48] there and the RCMP officer's there and
[1:29:51] he only got so many days and I have to
[1:29:53] get a new motor for the truck."
[1:29:56] And then I bring my family out here in a
[1:29:59] little 19 ft trailer
[1:30:02] and parked it over the plaza. You can
[1:30:04] drive past it if you want now, but it
[1:30:06] was just a rat's nest. I think it still
[1:30:08] might be. I don't want to get sued, but
[1:30:13] up on the King George highway. And I
[1:30:15] parked that 19 ft trailer. And God, he
[1:30:17] saw to it that he made it real difficult
[1:30:20] because it rained. It rained and rained
[1:30:23] and rained and rained. And there we
[1:30:25] were, five in that little trailer. I
[1:30:28] won't tell you the rest of the story,
[1:30:29] but there was no church that I knew of
[1:30:31] to go to. And when I finally did go into
[1:30:34] one, Hollywood was just coming right on.
[1:30:37] Mini skirts, the whole works, coming
[1:30:40] right onto the onto the platform in this
[1:30:43] in those that are singing. And I said to
[1:30:45] my wife, I can't stay here. I can't let
[1:30:49] my children see that. I don't want my
[1:30:52] girls to admire those young ladies that
[1:30:54] are dressed like that. And we walked out
[1:30:56] and we were we were in the wilderness.
[1:30:58] Friends, I just want you to know it's
[1:31:01] not always simple to follow and go God's
[1:31:05] way.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; But God's way is the right way.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; God's way will always succeed
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; in the end. And the truth shall prevail.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you come through
[1:31:17] the test, God knows how to do whatever
[1:31:20] he wants to do.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:25] I thank God for the for those
[1:31:27] experiences. I say this, I wouldn't I
[1:31:31] wouldn't go through it again for a
[1:31:32] million dollars
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't take a million dollars
[1:31:35] for the experience.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; It's God's way. Amen. Praise God.
[1:31:44] But when I confronted
[1:31:48] eternal life,
[1:31:50] when I confronted when I was confronted
[1:31:53] with eternal life,
[1:31:55] and I was
[1:31:57] I realized
[1:31:59] I realized that coming out of this man's
[1:32:01] mouth, this prophet messenger, this
[1:32:03] little man that was being turned out
[1:32:06] being turned out by the churches by the
[1:32:09] hundreds
[1:32:12] this little man called William Brham
[1:32:14] being turned out and spoken against.
[1:32:18] But when I heard the word coming out of
[1:32:21] just the scriptures coming out of his
[1:32:23] mouth,
[1:32:25] I saw something I wanted.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And I saw something that he had.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't see it any other place.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I couldn't see it in myself. And I
[1:32:38] couldn't see it anywhere else. All I
[1:32:40] could see was questions and confusion
[1:32:43] and all kinds of things and turmoil
[1:32:45] amongst the ministry. And there I hear a
[1:32:48] clear sound coming out of his mouth. I
[1:32:52] thank God for grace to say whatever it
[1:32:54] takes.
[1:32:57] If it costs my family, if it costs my
[1:33:00] friends, if it costs my job, if it costs
[1:33:03] all the minister friends I have,
[1:33:05] whatever it cost, if it cost my
[1:33:08] ministry, I've got to follow this.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm here today to say that became my
[1:33:14] leadership because that is Jesus Christ.
[1:33:19] That's none other than Jesus Christ. And
[1:33:21] that needs to be your leadership.
[1:33:25] And I have to say to you, I'm trusting
[1:33:27] him to take me through into this
[1:33:29] rapture.
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; There is no other leadership.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do,
[1:33:41] you can error in a lot of areas of life.
[1:33:45] Don't error in this one.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You only got one chance at this one.
[1:33:49] This is the rapture, the change of the
[1:33:52] body. Don't leave it to your reasoning.
[1:33:54] Don't leave it to someone else's advice.
[1:33:56] Don't leave it to a council of people.
[1:33:59] Leave it only to the word of God that
[1:34:01] has come to us.
[1:34:04] Glor,
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; this leadership,
[1:34:20] your destiny.
[1:34:24] I hope I can make it
[1:34:27] the way I had to make it this morning.
[1:34:31] your destiny.
[1:34:35] Don't just trust this church.
[1:34:39] Don't just trust
[1:34:41] maybe something that you had your
[1:34:43] passport and your identification 10
[1:34:46] years ago or 15 years ago. You want to
[1:34:48] know how it is this morning.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You want to know that passport's
[1:34:52] current. Your identification is current.
[1:34:54] You see yourself in the word. You see
[1:34:56] yourself moving along. Your soul is fed.
[1:35:00] Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Rebecca is our prophetic type.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; As I thought this as I just put it down.
[1:35:11] Rebecca is our prophetic type.
[1:35:15] And I spoke earlier that she had watered
[1:35:17] the very power that took her back to
[1:35:19] Isaac. I just want to look at her for a
[1:35:21] moment because there's something
[1:35:23] important here.
[1:35:30] in time of decision.
[1:35:33] He said, "And so she watered the camel,
[1:35:35] the animal, the power that was to take
[1:35:37] her home to her new home and anything."
[1:35:41] And another thing he said, "Did you
[1:35:42] notice when she went over now being
[1:35:45] blood relation, she was a blood
[1:35:47] relation, that is our type.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; We are a blood relation of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:53] He's not of a Jew. And he's not of a
[1:35:57] gentile.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; He is the blood of God.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; And you are not of just a human descent.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; God ordained that you would come and
[1:36:07] that the seeds would be mingled and
[1:36:09] would bring you down to this day. But
[1:36:11] you have been born again by the
[1:36:13] incorruptible word of the living God.
[1:36:16] And that word could only come by the
[1:36:19] created blood of God, the second Adam.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:36:25] That's why the prophet called it the
[1:36:27] bleeding word.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You have the token in you. It's a
[1:36:32] bleeding token. We have the very blood
[1:36:35] of God in us.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; We are the royal seed with royal blood
[1:36:41] in our veins.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; How can you say that, brother Bisl?
[1:36:46] Because God has said it.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends, just
[1:36:52] so you can think about it. The word of
[1:36:55] God is stronger, more powerful than
[1:36:59] anything physical you may have.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; That's why healing is stronger than
[1:37:05] sickness.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; The word of God as the seed of God is
[1:37:11] stronger than the seed of the human
[1:37:13] semen by which you came into the world.
[1:37:17] By that seed and through the birth of a
[1:37:19] woman, you die. But by the seed of God,
[1:37:22] the spoken word of God, you live
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; by the human nature, you have weaknesses
[1:37:31] that you've tried to overcome for years
[1:37:33] and they hang on.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; They hang on and you hate them.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Is that not right? But by the
[1:37:40] supernatural seed, hallelujah, you have
[1:37:43] the nature of almighty God.
[1:37:47] You have the nature of God. I say that
[1:37:50] by the scripture
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; being born again of the incorruptible
[1:37:54] seed of God.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; You have the nature of God because the
[1:37:58] seed carries that nature.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; So will I go on in my weakness? That's
[1:38:05] up to God. Whatever he does with you,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; however he molds you and fashions you
[1:38:10] and we're waiting for things maybe to
[1:38:12] drop off and we're waiting for other
[1:38:13] things to come on. And we're waiting.
[1:38:16] This is no license to continue on in
[1:38:18] sin. nothing of that. I'm talking about
[1:38:20] the human nature,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; the human weakness.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Some are prickly and some are really
[1:38:28] backward and the ones that are backward
[1:38:30] wish they could be forward and the ones
[1:38:32] that are forward wish they could be
[1:38:33] backward.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; The ones who are noisy wish they could
[1:38:36] be quiet and the quiet ones wish they
[1:38:37] could be more
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; expressive. Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; We we we're just not happy with
[1:38:42] ourselves. And
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; as I've said here before, if we had the
[1:38:45] chance to remold ourselves, we'd all
[1:38:47] work ourselves right out of the will of
[1:38:49] God cuz he made you the way you are.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He caused the families and the and the
[1:38:55] forefathers to come on down to bring you
[1:38:57] here to this day. But you are here. You
[1:39:00] came across a certain voice and
[1:39:02] something within you believed it.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; And at the time, maybe you didn't even
[1:39:06] know why you believed it. But you
[1:39:08] believe it
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and you can't help yourself. You
[1:39:12] believed it. You believed it in spite of
[1:39:15] yourself.
[1:39:17] You believed it in spite of your own
[1:39:18] reasoning.
[1:39:20] You just believed it
[1:39:23] and difficulties came and all kinds of
[1:39:25] adversity came and you continued to
[1:39:27] believe it and you felt like you were
[1:39:29] lost. As our brother uh Mike G sang, he
[1:39:32] you know at a low point at a low point
[1:39:34] but he wrote a song that's blessed
[1:39:36] multitudes.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Who doesn't hit a low point? We all hit
[1:39:42] low points.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Hit them regularly. That has nothing to
[1:39:45] do with it.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; So I hit a low point. So I'm not a
[1:39:48] biscuit.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That's that's who I am.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; You are who you are. And if that can be
[1:39:54] so by a natural birth
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; by a sperm from a father into the
[1:40:00] bedding ground of a human mother and can
[1:40:02] bring you forth into this world subject
[1:40:04] to sin and unbelief and all the rest.
[1:40:06] Surely, surely the seed of Almighty God
[1:40:10] that comes down into the woman of mind
[1:40:13] and into the soul, into the soul of a
[1:40:16] man makes him or her a new creature in
[1:40:19] Christ Jesus.
[1:40:21] Old things have passed away, have passed
[1:40:24] away, and behold, all things are new.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, this is what I'm
[1:40:31] experiencing." I don't care what you're
[1:40:32] experiencing. I don't care where you are
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; because the di disciples might have said
[1:40:37] when at the time and this is what was
[1:40:39] part of my message when he said I go to
[1:40:41] prepare a place for you that that's one
[1:40:43] of the most beloved things and the
[1:40:45] prophet said he was telling them about a
[1:40:46] life hereafter he was telling them life
[1:40:48] doesn't end here this life continues
[1:40:50] right on and here the Lord Jesus is in
[1:40:53] such an intimate and there they're well
[1:40:55] that's not where I'm at I'm confused
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; and Thomas Thomas voiced all of them
[1:41:01] Lord
[1:41:02] where are Are you going?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; We don't know where you're going. And if
[1:41:06] we don't know where you're going, how
[1:41:08] can we get there?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He just made it simple. I'm the way
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; you've been doing. Just keep doing it.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Just keep following. I'm still the way.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah. You heard my word. Just keep
[1:41:20] following those words
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; and you'll get there.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; You'll get to where I am.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And where I am, there you'll be. And I'm
[1:41:29] going to come and receive you unto
[1:41:31] myself. And here he come. Luke 17:30. In
[1:41:34] the day when the Son of Man is revealed,
[1:41:37] here he comes down, I tell you, from the
[1:41:39] heavens, descending down into our
[1:41:41] generation.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; And he did exactly what he did when he
[1:41:44] was here on earth. He told them the
[1:41:46] secret of their heart. Hallelujah.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And he began to pull the people, pull
[1:41:50] the masses,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and then spoke the word, and the masses
[1:41:54] left him. But out of there came one
[1:41:56] here, a few there, some over here. And I
[1:41:59] say, here we are today. Here we are
[1:42:01] today.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; We're here because we've heard a voice.
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; There's no voice like it.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And you know right well you can't go
[1:42:15] back where you were.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; You can never go back where you were.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; I defy any hutterite in this place and
[1:42:21] go back to a colony. If you can go back,
[1:42:23] you never did have it in the first
[1:42:25] place. I defy every Catholic, including
[1:42:27] myself, to go back to Catholicism. If
[1:42:30] you can go back, you never did have it.
[1:42:32] If you can go back to the world, you
[1:42:34] never did have it. Hallelujah.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; One of these days, I think I'm going to
[1:42:51] do it. I'm going to put up some pictures
[1:42:53] of people sitting in this congregation
[1:42:55] that that I know. I know from their
[1:42:57] pictures. I know what they wear. I'd
[1:42:59] like to I told brother Dave Chberov, I'm
[1:43:02] going to put his up. You want to see him
[1:43:04] coming out of the mud? I'm talking about
[1:43:06] literal mud with a cigarette in one hand
[1:43:09] and a can of beer in the other.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, he looks like he has
[1:43:13] just come out of the out of the west
[1:43:16] side of hell.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right, Brother David?
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; And you don't mind me putting that
[1:43:20] picture up?
[1:43:26] He hesitated just for a moment there.
[1:43:30] Oh, where we've been,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; but we can't go back.
[1:43:36] Wherever you're going, Lord, that's
[1:43:37] where I'm going.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord came as leadership
[1:43:42] in this hour and it's the last thing he
[1:43:45] spoke was leadership. And I say I'm
[1:43:47] devoted and committed to that
[1:43:49] leadership.
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:52] And if you can see anything that would
[1:43:55] seem
[1:43:57] to you to be
[1:44:00] worth following
[1:44:02] in this life and in this ministry,
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; I say come and go with me
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; and I go with you
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and let us journey together.
[1:44:13] And the Bible says of our type, our
[1:44:15] prophetic type,
[1:44:18] when they saw that Eleazar was not going
[1:44:22] to be detained anymore.
[1:44:24] I'm going to go. Please don't hold me
[1:44:27] back. I must go.
[1:44:32] So he said,
[1:44:34] "Then he blessed
[1:44:36] Rebecca
[1:44:38] and said unto her, thou art our sister.
[1:44:42] Be thou the mother of thousands of
[1:44:44] millions, and let thy seed possess the
[1:44:48] gate of those which hate them." Wasn't
[1:44:50] that a strange sendoff?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Was a strange sendoff?
[1:44:55] The Lord bless you
[1:44:58] and cause you to be a mother of
[1:45:00] thousands. She hasn't even found the man
[1:45:02] yet.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; She hasn't even seen him yet. And let
[1:45:06] your seed possess, let thy seed possess
[1:45:08] the gate of those that hate them.
[1:45:14] Could get into some pretty deep swimming
[1:45:16] water here, but I think I'll
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; The woman has got a seed.
[1:45:25] The only seed she could bring forth was
[1:45:26] the promise.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Mary didn't have any seed. She had the
[1:45:34] promise word. Hallelujah. And we as a
[1:45:38] bride of Jesus Christ, we have the word,
[1:45:40] the promised word. We have the seed with
[1:45:42] us.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That brings forth the image of Jesus
[1:45:46] Christ.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Shove it over. Let your seed
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; be the mother of thousands of millions,
[1:45:55] and let thy seed possess the gate of the
[1:45:58] of them which hate thee. And Rebecca
[1:46:00] rose
[1:46:02] and her damsels, and they rode upon the
[1:46:05] camels, and here it is,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; followed the man.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, and people say, "I'm not going to
[1:46:17] follow a man." Yeah.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes, you are.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Here. Somebody say, "You're following
[1:46:21] somebody."
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; I've had it said to me, "I don't follow
[1:46:32] a man." Say, "Is that right? No, I'm not
[1:46:34] going to follow a man." In other words,
[1:46:37] you know, they're saying in a
[1:46:38] left-handed way, you're following a dead
[1:46:40] man.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not following a man. Oh, is that
[1:46:44] right? I talked to a Bible school
[1:46:46] student once said, "You want to talk
[1:46:48] about the serpent seed?" So, we talked
[1:46:49] about the serpent seed. And then when
[1:46:50] the serpent seed came right down so
[1:46:52] tight, they couldn't even answer it.
[1:46:53] They just went, they always expected to
[1:46:55] go to Genesis. I always start in
[1:46:56] Corinthians and go back to Corinthians,
[1:46:59] you know, where apostle Paul says,
[1:47:01] "Would the God be bear with me and bear
[1:47:03] with me? Indeed, I'm jealous over the
[1:47:05] godly jealousy. I suppose you only one
[1:47:06] husband, one husband, even Christ, you
[1:47:09] know, I present you chastening the
[1:47:11] virgin so on."
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; I said, "Who's Paul talking about?
[1:47:13] What's he talking about? You know,
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; did did Eve have a headache?
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Is that what happened? They said was in
[1:47:23] her mind. Did she have a headache? Was
[1:47:25] she get migraines?
[1:47:27] No. I said her her productive organs.
[1:47:31] Anyway, he went back went back to John's
[1:47:34] gospel, the eth chapter, talked about
[1:47:37] the eth chapter. Jesus said, "You're of
[1:47:38] your father, the devil, and his deeds
[1:47:40] you do.
[1:47:42] you're of your father and I'm of my
[1:47:44] father. And he just se separates them
[1:47:46] right there trying to, you know, then
[1:47:47] they get in a place where they can't
[1:47:49] wiggle. They said, "Well, I just follow
[1:47:52] uh I don't want to follow a man. I just
[1:47:53] follow Christ."
[1:47:56] I said, "Okay." I said, "Uh, how was
[1:47:58] Bible school this year?" "Oh," he said,
[1:48:01] "It was a you know, I'm not too much of
[1:48:04] a book man." "Oh, did you study quite
[1:48:08] hard?" "Yeah." "Did you finish your
[1:48:09] exams?" "Yeah." "Yeah, yeah.
[1:48:11] You you studied though? Well, you know,
[1:48:13] yeah, I studied. I said, 'What'd you
[1:48:15] study?
[1:48:17] He stopped
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; cuz he saw the trap was set.
[1:48:22] I said, "What'd you study?" And he held
[1:48:24] his peace. I said, "Books written by a
[1:48:27] man.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; You studied man's books?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Dead men's books.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You studied dead men's books?"
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; And you're saying something to me about
[1:48:39] following a man? I say, "Glory to God.
[1:48:41] I'll follow this man
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; as he follows Christ."
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Going to close right away. And it says,
[1:48:54] "And they followed the man." Now, we're
[1:48:56] talking about leadership. And I'm just
[1:48:58] closing.
[1:49:02] How have been if Eleazar said, "You
[1:49:04] know, Rebecca, I'm going to have prayer
[1:49:06] for you and uh you stay with your mother
[1:49:09] 10 days. I'm on my way. Uh, where are
[1:49:12] you going? Well, just go west or
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; go out there. Uh, go across the desert
[1:49:18] here. Uh, hopefully the wind hasn't
[1:49:20] blown over the camel tracks and you'll
[1:49:22] find the way.
[1:49:25] Can you imagine Rebecca trying to find
[1:49:28] Isaac
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; without a leader?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; She's our type. You're not going to find
[1:49:36] Isaac
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; unless you have the God orained
[1:49:39] leadership to take you to him.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And we all been there
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; and we've said, "Who is this?
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Who is this that
[1:49:52] who is this wonderful, glorious one that
[1:49:55] I see rising
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; out of the field?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I see Christ. Oh my precious brothers
[1:50:03] and sisters,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; I say to you in my closing comments,
[1:50:07] when I look upon the believers of the
[1:50:09] message,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus Christ.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; I see him.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I feel him.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I hear him
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; in ways that perhaps we don't recognize
[1:50:22] at the time, but I appreciate it. And as
[1:50:24] I appreciate you, I say that from the
[1:50:27] depths of my heart. I appreciate you.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. and have a deep love.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; I said to my wife today coming to
[1:50:33] church, I I could never leave this
[1:50:35] place. Not simply because of family, but
[1:50:38] this is our this is our life.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; This is our people.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I this is where this is where Christ has
[1:50:46] been made known to me
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; in such a wonderful way.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm filled with such anticipation
[1:50:53] for how he will lead us at this camp
[1:50:55] this year. Amen.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; And I thought of some of you young
[1:50:58] people are listening to me this morning
[1:51:04] and you have to don't forgive me but I
[1:51:06] had to bring it this way. You have
[1:51:08] followed you have been following and
[1:51:10] perhaps up till even now have followed
[1:51:13] the wrong leadership.
[1:51:19] You've got close friends and they might
[1:51:22] be here in this church, but you know
[1:51:25] they're not a good influence on you. You
[1:51:29] know that when you're near them, the
[1:51:32] influence and that influence becomes
[1:51:34] leadership. And you know, you know this
[1:51:37] morning, you know right now while I'm
[1:51:38] speaking, it takes you down.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; It doesn't lift you up. And if you were
[1:51:44] to say, "Brother Biscoll, what would you
[1:51:47] do?" Then if you were me as a young
[1:51:49] person, what would you do? Cut off
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; every relationship. Cut off every
[1:51:55] friendship that's going to turn you away
[1:51:58] from this word, this Christ. Cut it off
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; and begin to associate with others.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Who would you associate with? I'd find
[1:52:09] some strong ones. I'd find some real
[1:52:12] established ones.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; I'd find some that had real spiritual
[1:52:16] integrity and character and someone I
[1:52:19] would not be ashamed saying he or she is
[1:52:21] my friend.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; And I admire them.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; They've got something
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and I want it
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; and I'm prepared to do what I need to do
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; to get it.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking I I'm tired of the
[1:52:38] splash in the pan. I don't want you to
[1:52:40] come to camp and just have a a weeping
[1:52:42] time around the altar. I want you just
[1:52:44] to make a solid decision. Say, I am
[1:52:46] headed for the kingdom of God. I am done
[1:52:49] with the world. I'm done with all the
[1:52:52] flesh. I'm done with all this
[1:52:55] ambition of the teenage life.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; I'm done with it.
[1:53:04] a young man
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said
[1:53:09] in leadership
[1:53:11] here you are young ladies
[1:53:14] young men and might be some here that
[1:53:17] aren't so young but I had a very special
[1:53:21] pull yesterday in my heart talk to our
[1:53:25] young people are going to be at camp and
[1:53:27] prepare them now and this service is a
[1:53:30] preparation.
[1:53:32] He knew it was there. And I say I stop.
[1:53:35] I say, you know it's here.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; You know this word is true.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; You know it's real.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; We don't have to invent stuff. I don't
[1:53:44] have to pound it into you. You know it's
[1:53:46] right.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; I've had people walk into such a
[1:53:53] so wound themselves and so hurt
[1:53:56] themselves. And yet if you ask them, "Do
[1:53:58] you believe that brother Brandham was
[1:54:00] God's prophet?" They say, "Oh,
[1:54:02] absolutely." And they do.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; But somehow they haven't found it within
[1:54:06] themselves yet to make that.
[1:54:10] We don't want to just say commitment,
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; But that final resolve,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; brother Ernie. So it's all over.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; And he knew it was there. He said
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; he believed in it.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And you do, too.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; You do, too. You believe in it.
[1:54:27] And
[1:54:29] he wanted it.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; He actually wanted it.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; He knew it was here
[1:54:38] and he believed in it
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; and he wanted it.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; But he but when he was confronted with
[1:54:47] how he had to do it,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; it was different from his ritual.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:54:56] Oh, I just want somebody to pray for me.
[1:55:00] I knew an old Norwegian. I guess he's
[1:55:03] Norwegian. His wife is Danish, I
[1:55:04] believe. My sister and my brother-in-law
[1:55:07] know him. Brother Steiner, Brother
[1:55:09] Brena.
[1:55:12] And this man up in Norway, I believe it
[1:55:15] was, he was in the hotel business. I
[1:55:18] think he inherited the hotel business.
[1:55:20] And of course, they sold alcohol and
[1:55:22] things. That's how you make your most
[1:55:24] your money. His mother was a real
[1:55:26] Christian
[1:55:28] and she was going to a camp meeting and
[1:55:31] some campgrounds and he told me this
[1:55:34] account more than once and he went with
[1:55:37] her just to be with his mother because
[1:55:39] his mother was quite aged and he heard
[1:55:41] somebody preach
[1:55:44] and it just so gripped him and he went
[1:55:48] out of there with a heavy weight and
[1:55:50] went back home and he got back to his
[1:55:53] room.
[1:55:55] And he was back in his room. He was so
[1:55:57] troubled. He could not rest. And now it
[1:56:01] was the middle of the night. He thought,
[1:56:03] "I have to go back. I have to somehow I
[1:56:05] have to find this Christ."
[1:56:09] And he went back. There was nobody in
[1:56:12] the camp campground. Stark, empty,
[1:56:14] middle of the night now, maybe one or
[1:56:16] two in the morning. And I think he found
[1:56:18] one man. They wanted to know where the
[1:56:20] minister was. He's up in a certain
[1:56:22] dormatory or whatever. He got to his
[1:56:24] room and knocked on the door
[1:56:27] and this old man got up. He had a long
[1:56:29] night gown on, you know, night shirt.
[1:56:33] And he came to the door.
[1:56:36] Yeah. He says,
[1:56:39] "I I I want to receive Christ or
[1:56:41] something. I forget how he said it. I
[1:56:44] need to be saved."
[1:56:46] The old man, come on in.
[1:56:51] The old man sat down.
[1:56:55] So you want to be saved?
[1:56:57] Yeah.
[1:56:59] He said, "Then kneel there."
[1:57:02] So he knelt down. The old man never
[1:57:05] moved. He says, "Now pray.
[1:57:08] Pray."
[1:57:10] He didn't hardly know how to pray. And
[1:57:12] him old man didn't do a thing. He let
[1:57:14] him sweat it out.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; You pray.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; You did the sinning. You do the praying.
[1:57:19] You did the unbelief. You do the
[1:57:21] praying. And he sat there while he
[1:57:23] prayed through. And that man became a
[1:57:25] preacher.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; It's not me that needs to pray. It's you
[1:57:30] that needs to pray.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Not me that needs to believe. I already
[1:57:34] believe. It's not me that needs to
[1:57:35] commit myself. You got to separate from
[1:57:38] it.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; I'm done with the world.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I'm done with the trash.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I'm done with the magazines. I'm done
[1:57:45] with the videos. I'm done with all this
[1:57:48] nonsense of the world. And down inside,
[1:57:50] you know it is. And that you say, well,
[1:57:52] does it take that? It takes that to get
[1:57:54] it.
[1:58:05] it.
[1:58:06] I see it
[1:58:09] and I know it's here and I want it.
[1:58:14] But will you do what it takes to get it?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; You can't get it any other way. I'm not
[1:58:20] talking about having a little better
[1:58:22] life here. I'm talking about the
[1:58:24] rapture.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about following that
[1:58:27] leadership into the rapture. Amen. And
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; my brother, my sister, as far along as
[1:58:33] I've gone in this life, there's one
[1:58:35] thing I have no regret. I have no regret
[1:58:38] over every moment, over every hour,
[1:58:40] every day, every meeting I've been in. I
[1:58:42] have no regret. Have you made mistakes?
[1:58:45] Many of them.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And anybody who doesn't say they've made
[1:58:49] mistakes is not telling the truth.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; We've all made mistakes.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; That's not the point. If you said to the
[1:58:56] disciples, he's talking about going and
[1:58:58] I don't know where he's going. Well, the
[1:59:00] reason why you don't know is the way you
[1:59:02] fellas have lived and you've been
[1:59:03] running scared and you've been this and
[1:59:05] you've been that. They could have found
[1:59:06] all kinds of things wrong with the
[1:59:08] disciples. It wasn't that. Jesus never
[1:59:10] pointed to that. He said, "I'm I'm going
[1:59:12] away and I'm going to take you and I'm
[1:59:14] preparing a place for you." He didn't
[1:59:15] talk to them about their weaknesses. He
[1:59:17] didn't tell them that you fellas need
[1:59:19] the Holy Ghost.
[1:59:21] They did need it.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; But he knew as they followed him,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; they would get what they need.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, my friend, I'm consumed with this
[1:59:32] this morning. They would get what they
[1:59:35] need. And as you follow it, you will get
[1:59:37] what you need.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; You know, it's going to be more real
[1:59:44] than it is this morning.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; This isn't some pie in the sky. This
[1:59:49] isn't some dream. This is This is a fast
[1:59:52] fading.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; This life here is fast fading.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; It's going to be gone.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; And Jesus told of that rich young man,
[2:00:07] you know, I'm closing now in just a
[2:00:09] moment.
[2:00:11] I have actually seen people that I
[2:00:14] walked with and fellowshipped with
[2:00:20] I met one not long ago down White Rock.
[2:00:24] He was standing there in a pair of
[2:00:26] shorts and telling me,
[2:00:29] "I need to talk to you." Said, "Is that
[2:00:31] right?
[2:00:33] I can prove to you. I can prove to you
[2:00:36] that William Brandon was false." Said,
[2:00:38] "Is that right?"
[2:00:41] I'm looking at a a man
[2:00:44] so far from God,
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how he can open his
[2:00:48] mouth
[2:00:49] and talking to a minister of the gospel
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; and turned around and told me, "The
[2:00:55] night I was in your home is when I led
[2:00:58] them to Christ."
[2:01:00] He says, "That's the that yet today is
[2:01:03] the happiest moment of my life."
[2:01:06] And right after that going to tell me
[2:01:07] the very thing that made me what I am is
[2:01:09] all false. Right?
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; And I can prove it to you. You know, all
[2:01:13] this intellectual stuff.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Going to prove it to you. I thought, you
[2:01:18] poor soul.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; He said, for example, the serpent seed.
[2:01:23] I said, just a second. Open your eyes,
[2:01:26] man.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Open your eyes.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; I said, it's everywhere around you. Look
[2:01:31] at this. I said, you got serpent seed
[2:01:32] everywhere here. He said, oh, come on.
[2:01:35] You not call that serpent seed. I said,
[2:01:37] well, then call it God's seed. What do
[2:01:38] you are you going to tell me this is of
[2:01:40] God? You going to tell me all this is of
[2:01:41] God?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me everything walking down
[2:01:44] this beach is of God.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Get real.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; This is of Satan.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; I said this is his kingdom. This is his
[2:01:53] Eden and he's designed it the way he
[2:01:55] loves it. I'm out of here.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; I'm history. Stay here if you want.
[2:02:02] [Applause]
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:08] You can consider me a fanatic if you
[2:02:10] want, but I'm about to do a dance.
[2:02:13] I'm just as happy as I can be. I'm so
[2:02:16] glad I've committed myself to this life
[2:02:19] and this word and this message. It's
[2:02:21] none other than Jesus Christ.
[2:02:25] [Applause]
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:30] [Applause]
[2:02:36] And I say to you in closing,
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; whatever you need to do,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; to have it, do it.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Do it.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; And say
[2:02:50] with Rebecca, if you want to say,
[2:02:52] "Rebecca's not just my type, but
[2:02:55] whatever was in her is in me." Now, if
[2:02:59] you can't make that connection,
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; then she's not your type.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; And as I said at the beginning, the type
[2:03:06] is not just likeness.
[2:03:09] It is the same. So, I'm saying to you
[2:03:12] today, whatever was in this young woman
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; of maybe 4,000 years ago, whatever was
[2:03:19] in her, you want to make sure today that
[2:03:22] the same spirit is now influencing you,
[2:03:26] surging through you, and moving you even
[2:03:29] in a way you cannot explain.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; And here's this young woman now. She's
[2:03:34] going to leave her mother
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; and her family.
[2:03:40] Praise God.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And he won't delay. I must go.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; So they said, "Well, let let us hear it
[2:03:47] out of her mouth."
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Especially you women, young ladies, I'd
[2:03:54] like to hear it out of your mouth.
[2:03:58] Will you go with this man?
[2:04:03] She said, "I will go."
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; That's not a big
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; long discourse.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for some great big
[2:04:14] long fancy prayer. He's just wanting to
[2:04:17] hear, I will go.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; I will follow.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; This man called Jesus Christ represented
[2:04:26] himself in a prophet messenger and I
[2:04:29] believe is speaking to my own soul
[2:04:31] today. I will go. Amen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; You know it's here
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; and you know he's here
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; and you know this is the time and you
[2:04:42] know you want it.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; And God's got a little preacher here
[2:04:49] telling you today how you have to get
[2:04:51] it.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; And if you just say, "Well, that's old
[2:04:55] brother Ed." Then you've already gone.
[2:04:57] You've already lost it.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; If you say, "Well, that's just a
[2:04:59] message. That's just, you know, I
[2:05:01] don't." Then you've already lost it.
[2:05:05] You say, "I see it.
[2:05:08] I know it's real.
[2:05:10] I want it.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; And I'll do whatever it takes."
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; To have it, sir.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Then you're in the right road.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; And the Lord's going to lead you.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; And dear friend.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly,
[2:05:33] We are going to cross over.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; And some of us are going to cross over.
[2:05:37] Some of you are going to cross over very
[2:05:39] young as far as this world is concerned.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you. Even though you've
[2:05:44] never had a boyfriend or maybe you have
[2:05:45] a boyfriend or maybe you've never
[2:05:46] married, you've never had children. You
[2:05:48] say, "Oh, I want to marry. I want to
[2:05:49] have children. I want this." I can just
[2:05:51] tell you the bliss of that
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; is so far beyond anything here.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; And when we get across, when we get
[2:05:57] across, we say across is just a step.
[2:05:59] Just a step. It's going to be so simple.
[2:06:02] It's going to be so simple. You're just
[2:06:03] simply going to find yourself there.
[2:06:05] You're going to take one breath here and
[2:06:06] take the next one there. You're going to
[2:06:07] have one footstep here. You're going to
[2:06:09] take the next footstep there. And people
[2:06:11] aren't going to know where you've gone.
[2:06:13] It's a secret catching away of the
[2:06:15] church is that we will be changed in a
[2:06:18] moment, in the twinkling of an eye. And
[2:06:20] this is my message of the rapture. Our
[2:06:23] identification is back there. I'll
[2:06:25] follow this man. I'll go this direction.
[2:06:27] And I'll do whatever is necessary to do.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, heavenly father,
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; this is such a mighty hour that we're
[2:06:40] in.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm sure I'm not the only one that
[2:06:43] is feeling it. Oh God, to say I feel a
[2:06:46] pull would be a understatement. To feel
[2:06:49] the drawing of the Holy Spirit. I pray,
[2:06:52] oh God, that you'll move men and women.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Move them to repentance. those that need
[2:07:01] to repent, may they turn from sin. May
[2:07:05] they turn from the works of the flesh.
[2:07:08] May they turn, oh God, before the
[2:07:10] destruction that will come in the
[2:07:12] tribulation that will surely come. For
[2:07:15] even now we see it in the making. Oh
[2:07:18] God, if it were not for this
[2:07:21] gospel, if it were not for what we are
[2:07:24] experiencing,
[2:07:27] if it were not for the fact that I know
[2:07:30] there are those and by your grace, by
[2:07:33] your promise, I include myself
[2:07:36] in the group, Lord, that you are have
[2:07:39] come to take out of this world. And oh
[2:07:43] God,
[2:07:44] I want so bad
[2:07:47] when I see what goes on around
[2:07:51] and I hear it and the conversation of
[2:07:55] the people.
[2:07:58] I feel as though I'm already in another
[2:08:00] world. You've already brought us into
[2:08:03] another place.
[2:08:05] Lord, I know that there's perhaps
[2:08:06] fathers here
[2:08:08] which are responsible to lead homes and
[2:08:11] lead families and lead children.
[2:08:14] They need to lead them by example.
[2:08:18] Mothers here, oh God, who have families,
[2:08:21] mothers who have already been called
[2:08:25] as the fifth gospel,
[2:08:28] let them be as Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[2:08:30] John, a true witness. Amen.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; All the things and the works of Jesus
[2:08:38] Christ.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; May they be a true witness and may they
[2:08:42] be relentless.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; May they say the same thing as the
[2:08:46] spirit speaks. May the spirit and the
[2:08:49] bride say the same thing. And today Lord
[2:08:53] I feel and sense the spirit and the
[2:08:56] bride saying come come
[2:09:00] for the and drink of these waters and
[2:09:03] let your thirst be quenched
[2:09:06] and turn from sin and death certain
[2:09:11] death. Lord I pray that you'll help us
[2:09:14] to bring a close to this service that
[2:09:16] will not really be a close but it'll
[2:09:18] just be another
[2:09:20] another step forward. I pray father that
[2:09:23] this service will not conclude until you
[2:09:26] have accomplished your work within the
[2:09:29] hearts of the people. Strive on oh God.
[2:09:33] Strive, oh God. I pray it'll not be as
[2:09:35] it was in the days of Noah when the
[2:09:37] spirit of God would strive no longer.
[2:09:39] Strive on
[2:09:41] speak on oh God. Draw them. Bring them.
[2:09:46] bring them with such a strong compulsion
[2:09:50] that they need to make their lives right
[2:09:52] with you. Oh God, a need to separate off
[2:09:56] from other forms of leadership.
[2:10:00] Oh God, I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:10:03] Christ, you'll smite the enemy. I pray
[2:10:07] you'll bring uh uh you'll bring
[2:10:09] destruction to his efforts. I ask you,
[2:10:12] oh God, to loose, I pray in the name of
[2:10:15] Jesus, every struggling soul that is so
[2:10:18] bound, so tied down with chains, oh
[2:10:22] chains of influence from the world,
[2:10:25] break those chains. Oh God, now
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; I say as the old Norwegian preacher, I
[2:10:33] say to you, forget who's beside you. You
[2:10:36] need to pray, pray. You need to con
[2:10:39] consecrate your life. Do it now.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't wait for another thing. I'd
[2:10:44] pray now as so it was the last five
[2:10:46] minutes of your life.
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Just as I am without one plea,
[2:10:58] there's a lot of folks that's ready to
[2:11:00] pray.
[2:11:02] Not only with you, for you, but I say
[2:11:05] you need to pray for yourself. you and
[2:11:08] you've been hiding back there in the
[2:11:09] bushes of the congregation and say,
[2:11:12] "Well, nobody really knows." You need to
[2:11:14] rise up out of there and say, "I'm my
[2:11:16] heart's not right with God." And I want
[2:11:18] the people to know that I need their
[2:11:20] prayers and I need the deliverance of
[2:11:22] the Holy Spirit. And I'm coming here
[2:11:24] today to obtain that by the grace of God
[2:11:27] and by the power of God. And by coming
[2:11:29] here, you'll be saying, "I it isn't only
[2:11:31] something that I see. It isn't only
[2:11:33] something that I want, but it's
[2:11:34] something I'm prepared to pay whatever
[2:11:36] it takes to get.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; And I'm not going to beg. But if God's
[2:11:45] dealing with you, you better respond.
[2:11:47] You hear the voice of Jesus Christ
[2:11:49] saying, "Come." He means come now.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Come quickly.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Come here.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Stand behind beside him.
[2:12:00] Don't don't don't let the service slip
[2:12:02] down into a Sunday morning meeting just
[2:12:04] closing.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; Don't let it happen. You'll be missing
[2:12:06] it.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Listen to that voice that's inside just
[2:12:10] now.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; I want everybody to be in prayer. If
[2:12:14] you've ever taken my word, I ask every
[2:12:17] believer to be in prayer now
[2:12:20] just as
[2:12:23] I am
[2:12:26] without
[2:12:29] one plead
[2:12:31] but that
[2:12:34] my blood
[2:12:37] was sh
[2:12:39] for me
[2:12:42] and
[2:12:44] Thou fix
[2:12:46] me. Come
[2:12:49] to thee,
[2:12:51] oh lamb.
[2:12:54] How come
[2:12:57] I come?
[2:13:00] I
[2:13:02] come
[2:13:06] with whom
[2:13:09] I am.
[2:13:12] and waiting
[2:13:15] on
[2:13:17] to bring
[2:13:19] my soul.
[2:13:22] of one
[2:13:24] dark one
[2:13:27] to thee
[2:13:29] whose blood
[2:13:31] can cleans
[2:13:34] each
[2:13:37] lamb
[2:13:39] of God.
[2:13:50] I'm going to invite whoever God has been
[2:13:52] talking to. If you don't come, that's
[2:13:56] fine with me. I haven't got any agenda
[2:13:59] and I'm not trying to win any medals.
[2:14:02] I'm talking to you like my family, like
[2:14:04] my children, like I'd talk to my own
[2:14:06] daughters or my own sons if I had them.
[2:14:11] If God is speaking to you, then I'd say
[2:14:14] you need to you need to respond to him.
[2:14:18] If you don't, then it's him you're
[2:14:20] rejecting.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; It's his voice you're rejecting.
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't respond, you can respond in
[2:14:28] your seat. You respond where you are.
[2:14:31] But I wouldn't hide there. I wouldn't
[2:14:33] hide just behind the testimony of the
[2:14:35] whole congregation. I'd make a
[2:14:37] declaration today. Yes,
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I need God.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; I need deliverance. There's people and
[2:14:43] you parents, if you have young people or
[2:14:45] children that come here,
[2:14:48] I would come, if it were mine, I'd come
[2:14:50] and be praying with them.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; That's what I'd be doing. I'd be with
[2:14:53] them. And I would enter into prayer so
[2:14:55] they would know dad is praying,
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; mother's praying.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; They have a deep concern for me.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe in prayer?
[2:15:07] Let me see your hands.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; I want you to be praying. I want you
[2:15:12] praying now.
[2:15:14] We'll sing it once again.
[2:15:18] Just as
[2:15:21] I am
[2:15:23] and waiting
[2:15:26] not. Don't wait to rid
[2:15:31] my soul
[2:15:33] of one
[2:15:36] dark blood to thee
[2:15:40] whose blood
[2:15:43] can cleanse and will cleanse each part.
[2:15:48] Oh lamb
[2:15:50] of God.
[2:15:53] Speak out.
[2:15:55] Speak on, oh God.
[2:15:58] Speak on, oh God. Speak on. Speak on.
[2:16:03] Just as
[2:16:06] I am with
[2:16:10] one plea,
[2:16:13] my lamb
[2:16:16] by blood
[2:16:18] was shed
[2:16:21] for me.
[2:16:24] and that you have made me
[2:16:28] to come
[2:16:31] to the
[2:16:34] lamb
[2:16:36] of God.
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:16:44] Why not? Why not? Why not? Why not? Why
[2:16:47] not come to him now? Others, if there's
[2:16:50] deacons there, others that ministers,
[2:16:52] please come and just pray together. But
[2:16:54] let the people pray. I want you that are
[2:16:57] kneeling, you pray. You pray. You say,
[2:17:00] "Lord, it is me. I have failed you, and

[2:23:56] name of Jesus, the name of every
[2:23:59] deliverance, oh God, the name by which
[2:24:01] every healing takes place. There are
[2:24:04] those, oh God, whose lives need to be
[2:24:07] healed. They're bound by Satan. They're
[2:24:10] bound by habits of life. They're bound,
[2:24:14] oh God, by all kinds of superstition. I
[2:24:17] pray that you'll send your Holy Spirit.
[2:24:20] Send your Holy Spirit into the room,
[2:24:24] into the automobile, in the place where
[2:24:27] they are in their apartment. Oh God,
[2:24:30] send your room, send your spirit, oh
[2:24:33] God, to that room. Send it with
[2:24:35] deliverance. Send them in a shaking
[2:24:38] time. Oh God, spare them. I pray the
[2:24:42] awful judgments. Oh God, spare them. We
[2:24:46] pray. Bring them. Father, bring them. Oh
[2:24:50] God, we pray. Deliver them from their
[2:24:53] spirits of religion.
[2:24:55] Deliver them from their religion. Oh
[2:24:57] God, they're trusting in a false
[2:24:59] religion. Bring them out of that
[2:25:01] religion, oh God,
[2:25:04] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:25:09] [Music]
[2:25:10] May a mighty sweep of deliverance come

[2:25:16] this camp meeting, oh God, I pray, echo
[2:25:19] across the nation and all over this
[2:25:21] land.
[2:25:23] Let the lives of your saints, oh God,
[2:25:26] let the lives of your believers testify
[2:25:29] of your mighty power and your
[2:25:31] deliverance. In the name of Jesus
[2:25:33] Christ, we lift up the name of Jesus. We
[2:25:37] lift up the name of Jesus. We lift up
[2:25:40] the name of Jesus, the revealed word of
[2:25:43] God.

[2:28:07] their hand in the testimony say I want
[2:28:08] them to take full control.
[2:28:10] Whatever it is, take full control, Lord.
[2:28:13] Have full control of my life. God sees
[2:28:17] that. Oh, as we as we sing it to him
[2:28:20] again as a prayer, just keep our hands
[2:28:24] in dedication to him. I feel the

[2:28:35] heard the call, Lord, and now we're
[2:28:37] answering.
[2:28:39] and his spirit
[2:28:42] moving me to hear my heart. Whatever it
[2:28:48] takes, whatever it takes for

[2:29:34] I feel
[2:29:36] the pull.
[2:29:39] Have you felt the pull? Have you felt
[2:29:42] the pull of the Holy Spirit? That is
[2:29:45] him. That's Jesus Christ. The same one
[2:29:47] that was back there last year now.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:29:50] [Applause]
[2:29:54] You hear his voice.
[2:29:56] He's saying go free
[2:29:59] saying be free. You're going free
[2:30:03] [Applause]

[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; I believe in this gospel. I believe in
[2:30:12] this Jesus Christ.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Almighty God.
[2:30:19] In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:30:22] may this meeting continue on from here
[2:30:25] straight on into the campgrounds this
[2:30:27] afternoon and night after night and day
[2:30:30] after day. A mighty sweep of the Holy
[2:30:32] Spirit.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Eternal things done. Things will be done
[2:30:38] and things are being done now that Satan
[2:30:40] cannot undo.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; I declare it in the name of Jesus
[2:30:45] Christ. Satan has no power against this
[2:30:48] friends. We have the power.
[2:30:51] It's the eternal power of almighty God.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:57] We're just going to dismiss because have
[2:31:00] to have those that are going to camp
[2:31:02] soon go. I'm going to ask brother Dave
[2:31:04] Tberoff if you'd come just pray a prayer
[2:31:07] upon the people. We're not closing the
[2:31:09] service. We're just we're just taking a

[2:31:28] I want it to be the best one. I wanted
[2:31:32] to just go screaming out of the message
[2:31:34] throughout this whole land. Seattle,
[2:31:36] Tacoma, all of Washington, all the way
[2:31:39] down Oregon, wherever, all through this
[2:31:42] whole Northwest area.

[2:31:51] something about this message because of
[2:31:53] your life. And I say, glory be to God.
[2:31:56] Let the hallelujah roll.
[2:31:59] [Music]

[2:32:07] Lord Jesus, it's
[2:32:10] Lord, we want to just thank you, Lord.
[2:32:12] It's just been incredible this morning
[2:32:13] to be in your presence, Lord.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; God, we've heard from you, Lord.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; We've heard from you and it's been
[2:32:23] clear.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; It's been clear, Lord.
[2:32:29] God, we're going to follow you, Lord.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; This is eternal life, Lord.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; This world has nothing for us. Nothing.
[2:32:37] [Music]
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; God, it just blesses me to see these
[2:32:42] young lives up here,
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; to hear them calling on you.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; I know you could never turn that away,
[2:32:50] Lord.
[2:32:51] [Music]
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; I just agree with brother Biscllow this
[2:32:54] morning. Lord, we just want it to be
[2:32:57] finished, Lord, for these for these
[2:32:59] lives, Lord, with the world. We just
[2:33:02] want it to be, Lord, have them let them
[2:33:04] have that experience that'll keep them
[2:33:06] from this world and the the pain and the
[2:33:09] hurt that it brings. Lord Jesus,
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:33:15] [Music]
[2:33:19] what a start to a camp, Lord.
[2:33:23] [Music]
[2:33:25] Lord, we're just indebted to you.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; I'm just one
[2:33:30] one amongst many that have experienced
[2:33:32] your grace in this building, Father.
[2:33:37] And Lord, I just pray that you keep
[2:33:38] those
[2:33:40] there are those that commenced amongst
[2:33:42] us with poison. And we just want to pray
[2:33:45] that you would stop our ears from things
[2:33:47] that want to derail us. Lord,
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; when you strive so hard from this pulpit
[2:33:52] to lift us up and encourage us, Lord,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; and we just pray for a spirit of love
[2:34:00] and unity amongst the the saints.
[2:34:04] [Music]
[2:34:08] Blessed brother Biscoll, Lord,
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; we love him so much, Lord.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; He's given his life
[2:34:17] to lead us, Lord. And we appreciate it,
[2:34:19] Lord, what you have done through him.
[2:34:22] This word is
[2:34:24] it's given us counsel
[2:34:26] [Music]
[2:34:29] that set us on a solid rock. Father,
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; I am moved. I am so thankful for another
[2:34:36] opportunity be to be washed in your
[2:34:38] presence
[2:34:39] from this world. Father,
[2:34:42] I know the people have to go. There's a
[2:34:44] lot to be done.
[2:34:46] Bless this place. Bless each one in
[2:34:49] divine presence, Lord. Let none none
[2:34:51] escape your dealing this morning. I
[2:34:54] pray, Lord,
[2:34:56] and we turn we turn thanks to you, Lord.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; For all that you've done this morning.
[2:35:01] It's been it's been divine. It's been
[2:35:03] supernatural, Lord.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; And again, we pray for your servant.
[2:35:07] Bless him and his family. Strengthen
[2:35:09] him. And we do pray that you would
[2:35:11] continue to lead him as he leads us
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:35:19] Amen.
[2:35:22] Brother David bless you.
[2:35:25] God bless you.
[2:35:29] We're just going to dismiss you all in
[2:35:30] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:35:33] like you to go in this sacred atmosphere
[2:35:37] and really seek to maintain it. You
[2:35:40] know, keep the conversation from getting
[2:35:42] off on maybe light frivolous things.
[2:35:44] Just maintain a godly atmosphere if you
[2:35:47] would. And we'll just carry it right on
[2:35:49] through the week. Hallelujah. Those
[2:35:52] you've been here that are praying, I
[2:35:54] want to give you some instruction. You
[2:35:57] take and you you you build on from what
[2:36:00] God spoke to you this morning. You build
[2:36:03] on from it. You're not going to lose it.
[2:36:05] Don't worry about losing it. You're
[2:36:06] going to build on from here to say, "I
[2:36:09] know that was God that talked to me. I
[2:36:12] know it was God that was pulling me,
[2:36:14] drawing me. And now now if if he does
[2:36:17] that, he doesn't do it in vain. He has a
[2:36:19] he has a purpose for it. And I want to
[2:36:22] instruct you. You go on from here." And
[2:36:24] you say, "What more would you have me
[2:36:26] do, Lord? What would you have me do?"
[2:36:28] But don't don't stop at this critical
[2:36:30] point. Brother Brandham said he was
[2:36:32] confronted with eternal life.
[2:36:36] And he wanted it. He saw it. He knew it
[2:36:40] was here. He wanted it. But it was how
[2:36:42] what he had to do. You may have friends.
[2:36:46] You may have something that you know you
[2:36:49] you hold in your heart and only you know
[2:36:52] it.
[2:36:54] But you say, "Whatever I need to do, I'm
[2:36:57] ready to lay it all down."
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; That's good for everybody.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; A lot of us older folks, we need to do
[2:37:02] exactly that. We need to lay it all
[2:37:04] down. Leave all of our thoughts and all
[2:37:06] of our feelings, lot of our ideas. Say,
[2:37:08] "We just lay it all down. God, come and
[2:37:10] take absolute control in the name of
[2:37:12] Jesus Christ." You're all dismissed in
[2:37:16] Jesus name. I I tell you what, you know,
[2:37:17] to see Brother David up here, I even
[2:37:19] hesitate saying this, but you know, my
[2:37:22] heart, some of the most precious things
[2:37:24] in this congregation, I can't sh I can't
[2:37:26] hardly share with you. I only do it when
[2:37:28] I feel I have somebody that would
[2:37:30] forgive me for it. But brother David
[2:37:32] Jabbernov
[2:37:34] met a girl that he knew, just met her,
[2:37:39] you know, on a bus or something and he
[2:37:41] thought he'd just date her. How about a
[2:37:44] date? Oh, she says, "I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm
[2:37:47] going to church now." Oh, okay. That's
[2:37:49] fine. I can I can handle that. And she
[2:37:52] was nice girl, pretty girl.
[2:37:55] You don't mind me saying it's Brother
[2:37:57] David?
[2:38:00] Says, "I go to church now." Okay, I'll
[2:38:02] go to church. You know, I figured he go
[2:38:05] to church.
[2:38:07] Comes to church, the little log church.
[2:38:11] And the girl goes one way. I don't know
[2:38:13] where she is today. And he's never
[2:38:16] moved.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; He heard the call.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; He heard the voice.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; And he was transformed.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; Transformed from a lost bound creature.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; And God has used him to be a witness to
[2:38:30] his family, to his mother, and so on.
[2:38:33] Tell you what, friends, it's not been
[2:38:34] easy. It's not easy for any one of us,
[2:38:36] but it's worth it.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; It's worth it.
[2:38:39] &gt;&gt; And we're going to spend eternity
[2:38:40] together. You believe that? Amen.
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; You don't tire about that, do you?
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you, brother David. God bless
[2:38:47] you. And you've been having large groups
[2:38:49] of young people over to your place.
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Just keep doing it. I enjoyed the
[2:38:55] hamburgers, too.
[2:38:57] God bless you. You're all dismissed in
[2:38:59] Jesus name.
[2:39:02] God bless you.
