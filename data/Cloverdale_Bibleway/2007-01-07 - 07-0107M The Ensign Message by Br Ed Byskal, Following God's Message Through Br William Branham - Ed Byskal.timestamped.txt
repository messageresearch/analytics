[3:26] was called to be with the Lord in the
[3:29] last couple all days and uh this is the
[3:32] brother he had uh he had a some heart
[3:37] difficulty and I think a kind of a minor
[3:40] heart attack or a major heart attack I
[3:42] don't know which and here he was he came
[3:45] right to the pulpit a day or two right
[3:48] afterwards and has been taking his post
[3:50] there and we don't have any other
[3:52] details and just to say that he was
[3:55] called to be with the host of
[3:57] witnesses just quickly
[4:00] we've prayed for our sister Norma Smith
[4:03] uh who has pneumonia she was taken to
[4:04] the hospital last night about uh
[4:07] midnight and her daughters and
[4:10] granddaughter sister Jen Johnson and
[4:12] other sisters are with her and sister
[4:15] Sharon braxon I believe I really have a
[4:18] great deal of respect for sister Norma
[4:21] Smith just as quiet Spirit godly woman
[4:27] and comes always to the house of of God
[4:31] under any circumstances or condition and
[4:34] so I know that she'd just dearly loved
[4:36] to be here this morning and we say may
[4:39] God's holy spirit over in that room and
[4:42] be near our sisters that are there and
[4:45] may his perfect will be done I don't
[4:47] want to see her suffering at all so God
[4:50] be with
[4:51] her we didn't have a Time on New Year's
[4:55] Eve to say everything we would like to
[4:58] have said uh but but I I want to make a
[5:01] comment uh regarding our our brother
[5:04] Richard Drake who's standing here and
[5:08] our brother Richard Drake is a has been
[5:11] a been here since been a a young teenage
[5:14] boy been a long time and he has a a
[5:18] responsible position with the TransLink
[5:20] and the bus system but he has a
[5:23] responsible position also amongst the
[5:25] Bride of Jesus Christ and he has taken a
[5:30] personal commission really to send
[5:33] humanitarian Aid to the Ukraine to
[5:37] orphanages to Russia to Siberia in the
[5:41] far north has worked with brother gido
[5:44] and it unbeknown to perhaps many in the
[5:48] congregation that we need to take time
[5:50] and think about it uh and because I
[5:53] believe that as much as you have done it
[5:55] unto one of the least of these my
[5:57] brethren you've done it unto me and
[6:00] brother Richard has collected clothing
[6:03] from
[6:04] schools uh because he used to work in
[6:06] the school system and has connections
[6:09] gets clothing that's left at the schools
[6:12] uh that's left on the buses that is sent
[6:15] here from churches in different places
[6:17] until we've had to tell people don't
[6:19] send anymore but this year's this last
[6:22] year's shipping totals was 9,752
[6:30] to the Believers and Orphans of the
[6:32] Ukraine that was a total of 212
[6:37] boxes and 29
[6:40] boxes uh to the Believers and orphans in
[6:44] Siberia and from the initiation of each
[6:47] of these projects from the initiation of
[6:50] each of these projects our monthly
[6:52] average for boxes that have been shipped
[6:56] stand at 16 boxes per month
[7:00] to the Ukraine and one and a half boxes
[7:03] per month to Siberia that's since the
[7:06] program was initiated and I want to say
[7:10] to uh Brother Richard and uh the men of
[7:14] vision under whose offices this has all
[7:16] been happening during this time God
[7:18] bless you for the last year and God
[7:21] Prosper you even much more in the F in
[7:24] the future years and it's not just
[7:26] clothing but other things they sent
[7:28] dried food and the and the thanks
[7:31] letters of thanks that have come from
[7:34] these places in fact is the the director
[7:36] of the
[7:37] orphanages in the Siberia has said that
[7:41] men of vision is the only
[7:43] organization that stood by their promise
[7:47] and said they would do something and
[7:49] have done it and I say God bless you

[10:08] we thank you for it amen amen we believe
[10:12] it don't
[10:14] we turn in your Bibles please to John
[10:19] John's gospel the 12th
[10:22] chapter and we're going to read some
[10:25] verses from starting with verse 27
[10:50] now is my soul
[10:52] troubled and what shall I say father
[10:56] save me from this hour but for this this
[10:59] hour came I but for this cause came I
[11:03] unto this hour father glorify thy name
[11:07] then came there a voice from Heaven
[11:10] saying I have both glorified it and will
[11:15] glorify it
[11:17] again then down to on to down to verse
[11:20] 32 the people therefore that stood by
[11:23] and heard it said that it thundered
[11:26] others said an angel spake to him
[11:29] Jesus answered and said this voice came
[11:32] not because of me but for your sakes now
[11:36] is the Judgment of this world now shall
[11:39] the prince of this world be cast out and
[11:43] I if I be lifted up from the earth will
[11:47] draw all men unto me I'll have you read
[11:51] that verse 32 together with me and I if
[11:56] I be lifted up from the earth with will
[11:59] draw all men unto me while you're still
[12:03] standing brother Bram made
[12:07] uh I think a very very significant point
[12:11] when he came to this verse he turned to
[12:15] it in the first
[12:16] seal before the seals were now to be
[12:19] delivered and
[12:20] preached and he turned to John the 12th
[12:24] chapter and began with the 23rd verse
[12:29] and he said now listen here real
[12:32] close and then you won't have to wonder
[12:36] no more what it is and Jesus answering
[12:40] them said the hour is come that the son
[12:43] of man should be
[12:45] glorified so you're at the end of an
[12:49] age
[12:51] there his ministry is
[12:54] ending I want to draw your attention the
[12:57] prophet's Ministry too was ending
[13:01] the hour has come that the son of man
[13:03] should be glorified and he said then
[13:06] what about the hour has come that when
[13:10] his bride must be taken
[13:13] away what that hour what the hour has
[13:17] come that time shall be no more and the
[13:21] angel is ready to set one foot on land
[13:23] and the other on the
[13:25] sea with a rainbow over him that's the
[13:28] Covenant
[13:30] with his with feet and say times run
[13:33] out and besides that he raised up his
[13:36] hand and swore that
[13:38] time would be no more and the scripture
[13:42] says that it's that time will be no more
[13:45] there'll be no more delay for those
[13:47] things that have been sealed amen and
[13:49] now he says and and he says time has run
[13:53] out and besides that he raised up his
[13:54] hand and swore that that would be that
[13:58] time would no more when this happened
[14:01] how perfect it is he said a sworn
[14:05] affidavit to the church the hour is come
[14:09] that the son of man should be
[14:11] glorified Hallelujah and he is glorified
[14:15] in the fulfilling of his
[14:18] promise I'll have you read with me two
[14:20] other scriptures three scriptures
[14:22] actually Isaiah the 11th
[14:27] chapter and we'll read verses 10 11 and
[14:34] 12 and in that
[14:37] day there shall be a root of Jesse which
[14:40] shall stand for an ins sign of the
[14:43] people to it shall the Gentiles seek and
[14:47] his rest shall be glorious and it shall
[14:50] come to pass in that day that the Lord
[14:54] shall set his hand again the second time
[14:56] to recover the remnant of his people
[14:59] which shall be left from Assyria and
[15:01] from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kush
[15:04] and from Elam and from shinar and from
[15:07] hammoth and from the islands of the sea
[15:11] and he shall set up an an sign for the
[15:14] Nations and shall assemble the outcasts
[15:17] of Israel and gather together the
[15:20] dispersed of Judah from the four corners
[15:23] of the earth God bless you as you have
[15:25] your seats
[15:32] I want to greet you
[15:33] all the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[15:36] Christ and all
[15:39] who are joined with us
[15:42] today from many places around the world
[15:46] and it's an increasing
[15:48] congregation and we say God blessings
[15:51] upon them as well gathering in
[15:55] rooms in
[15:57] perhaps places where they've chosen to
[16:00] gather and so they are with us and we
[16:02] are one
[16:03] body in
[16:05] Christ I want to speak to you today on
[16:09] the ins sign message n sign e NS I GN
[16:16] the N
[16:18] sign the scripture says that he will set
[16:22] up an N
[16:24] sign and an N sign is simply something
[16:28] that is is lifted up a
[16:32] standard a signal or a
[16:35] banner and end sign is a rallying point
[16:40] something we rally
[16:42] around it is something that is not only
[16:46] to be lifted up but we think of an ins
[16:48] sign as a a flag or something that we
[16:51] identify
[16:53] with and
[16:57] uh we all are identified is as as
[17:02] individuals we are identified
[17:05] immediately we think of we're identified
[17:07] with a certain
[17:09] Nation I understand that even this month
[17:13] there has been a great deal of pressure
[17:15] upon the Canadian government by the
[17:18] American
[17:19] government to cause the people within
[17:22] this country that do not yet have uh
[17:25] legal status as a as a passport
[17:29] they're perhaps on visas student visas
[17:33] visitors visas Etc within Canada and
[17:38] America wants them to have Canadian
[17:42] passports and so there's a enor enormous
[17:45] Russian Crush at this time for everyone
[17:48] to get their passports and hundreds are
[17:51] lining up trying to get their passports
[17:54] so that they will be able to freely
[17:56] cross the border back and forth what is
[17:58] a America saying we want we want a a
[18:02] country to step up to the plate and take
[18:06] responsibility that these people are
[18:08] indeed citizens of the country and then
[18:11] they have freedom to go back and forth
[18:13] and uh of course I don't want to get
[18:15] into this but Canada says well give us a
[18:17] little more time because there's so many
[18:19] people that are here and we've got to
[18:21] process all of these documents as
[18:25] individuals we are I identified with
[18:28] them a country or a nation or a place or
[18:31] a people but yet we we may not have
[18:36] been uh personally in attendance when
[18:41] great events took place and unfolded
[18:45] within the country to which we are
[18:48] associated with or identified with but
[18:50] yet we are identified with what that
[18:53] country stands for and when they put up
[18:56] their flag and uh uh we we have respect
[19:01] and awe and reverence to what that Flag
[19:04] represents because it represents a
[19:07] people it represents a culture it
[19:09] represents an idea it represents uh
[19:13] either democracy or dictatorship or
[19:15] Freedom or or whatever it it represents
[19:19] a free market or it represents something
[19:21] that we say I identify with that and uh
[19:25] uh however we we may not
[19:29] you know be in agreement with everything
[19:31] that our nation stands for but uh we are
[19:37] still identified with it and brother
[19:39] brandom says to be an
[19:42] American I must be
[19:44] identified with my
[19:47] nation when I am born here in this
[19:51] country I become a citizen and I'm
[19:54] identified with this nation all it is
[19:58] all that it is I am all that it has been
[20:03] I am for I'm identified as an American
[20:07] then I have to take all of its
[20:10] shame all of its Glory whatever it is I
[20:14] am because I'm identified with it and a
[20:18] mighty God unveiled he said I'm
[20:21] identified with a group that feels the
[20:24] spirit of
[20:26] God I'm identified with a group that
[20:29] knows he's
[20:31] unveiled I'm identified with that group
[20:34] I can say that you can say that I trust
[20:37] you can say that I'm identified with a
[20:40] group of people that believe that the
[20:42] Bride of Jesus Christ has been called
[20:45] I'm identified with a group of people
[20:48] that believe we have heard indeed the
[20:50] Rapture call and we're on our way in
[20:53] that direction I believe that and he
[20:56] said he's identified with the group that
[20:59] knows that he's unveiled and knows he's
[21:03] the same yesterday today and forever
[21:06] we're identified with that group of
[21:09] people identified with that kind of a
[21:11] message do you believe
[21:14] that just laying a foundation
[21:18] now there was only a
[21:20] few I would say Brave American
[21:24] marines that were actually on uh
[21:29] the hill called
[21:31] eima but a whole
[21:33] nation
[21:35] identifies with it one of the most
[21:39] famous
[21:40] pictures that's many know perhaps and
[21:44] don't even
[21:45] know why it's a famous picture but they
[21:49] they they see it but there's a people
[21:51] and a nation that is identified with it
[21:55] and there's a reverence and respect
[21:59] that is attached to such an
[22:03] event when a
[22:05] flag or an En sign is
[22:09] desecrated stepped on spit on and
[22:14] burned there's
[22:16] a a resentment or a disgust that comes
[22:19] within a person that that because there
[22:24] is a a feeling that's being expressed
[22:27] not not to a piece of cloth but to a
[22:32] whole people to a whole idea to a whole
[22:35] thought to a whole way of life we're
[22:37] saying these people hate the way I live
[22:41] they hate the country and the things
[22:43] that we stand for and so it's something
[22:46] that is really raises feelings of
[22:51] resentment and N sign is raised to be
[22:54] looked upon with a sense of pride
[23:00] awe
[23:02] respect and to give
[23:06] courage also it identifies ownership
[23:12] it's an Evidence of
[23:16] ownership we Fellowship around a message
[23:19] and I want to come to just a moment in a
[23:23] few moments but I'm going to show you
[23:28] some end
[23:30] signs and just a recap in visual form
[23:35] what we
[23:36] have uh what I've been saying up to this
[23:39] point and thanks brother Aaron Hardy for
[23:41] assisting me and I wonder now if the
[23:44] brothers would just run through these
[23:45] video clips all that you see here are
[23:49] identified in this congregation and
[23:51] perhaps we've missed some
[24:09] just about couple two three seconds
[24:13] Congo
[24:15] Trinidad
[24:17] Bosnia
[24:19] Germany
[24:22] Holland
[24:27] Belgium for
[25:21] I want to show you
[25:23] short actually clip of what took place
[25:27] before this this famous
[25:33] picture of the Marines
[25:35] on
[25:40] iima just takes a moment for the
[25:42] brothers
[25:44] to bring it around
[26:00] this
[26:01] cost while we're going back to the
[26:04] picture this cost
[26:07] 4,000 uh American
[26:09] lives in just a very very short time
[26:14] 4,000 more than died in
[26:17] 9911 and 20,000 Japanese that were
[26:22] attempting to
[26:23] defend just they say well it's just a
[26:26] piece of Rock
[26:30] uh but it has some
[26:33] significance and it was a strategic
[26:37] point and when these boys you'd think
[26:39] when there's
[26:40] artillery and mortar shells and ships
[26:44] blasting the this piece of stone this
[26:48] rock and dive bombers bombing it just
[26:52] bombing it to gravel to Pebbles and all
[26:55] of this cost and men like lying
[26:58] everywhere wounded and crying and
[27:01] screaming and men dying uh that's
[27:07] 24,000 men in a short
[27:10] 24,000 a reasonable City that perished
[27:13] in a short time in an island that has
[27:16] that has no buildings on it no nothing
[27:19] and in the boy's
[27:21] Minds in the boys' Minds with all of
[27:25] this noise and the D of War and the
[27:28] emotion of the moment
[27:32] somehow they had it in their hearts and
[27:35] Minds to go up that Steep Hill several
[27:39] hundreds of feet and there raise the
[27:44] flag of their Nation Old Glory and this
[27:48] picture was shot and it's a very very
[27:51] famous picture and we may go to the next
[27:54] one we have a
[28:00] an AM
[28:07] sign this came at Great
[28:11] cost this is the one that's been raised
[28:14] up he was lifted on this
[28:20] pole for the world to
[28:23] see
[28:25] desecrated spit upon
[28:30] beaten hated despised
[28:33] rejected and still is
[28:36] today this one has gone through a second
[28:40] crucifixion you know that this living
[28:42] Christ is alive today and is despised by
[28:46] the world and hated by the world but God
[28:51] Has Lifted him up high and lifted up is
[28:56] this end sign is this this banner and
[28:59] he's in our ins sign
[29:02] Hallelujah and we'll rise to whatever
[29:06] position we need to we'll climb whatever
[29:08] Hill we'll span whatever country we'll
[29:12] cross whatever ocean we'll go up to
[29:15] Every Mountain and cross the mountain
[29:17] ranges whatever is necessary to lift up
[29:20] this end sign and say he's not dead He's
[29:25] Alive Hallelujah and the life of him
[29:28] it's not a piece of cloth but the life
[29:31] of him has come down into me into you as
[29:35] by the Holy Spirit and he I can declare
[29:39] he's
[29:40] alive he represents my
[29:43] country
[29:44] [Music]
[29:46] Hallelujah that's more than Stars and
[29:48] Stripes friends it's more than crosses
[29:51] and emblems different kinds this is our
[29:55] end sign and God sent and a messenger in
[29:59] our time to declare to you he's not in
[30:03] the grave he's
[30:05] alive Hallelujah and to tell us we are
[30:09] citizens of another country our
[30:12] citizenship is not here hallelujah maybe
[30:17] something went through our heart as we
[30:19] saw the different flags of my country
[30:22] some are more patriotic than others but
[30:24] I'll tell you when this when this one
[30:26] comes up that I identify with him
[30:30] identify with this end sign identify
[30:33] with this message to some people perhaps
[30:35] the message doesn't mean anything but
[30:38] when I say the message of the hour it
[30:40] has come here at Great cost and I say
[30:43] this is he identifies he represents my
[30:47] nation he represents my citizenship I
[30:51] have my passport in his
[30:53] country
[30:56] Hallelujah and he will turn
[30:58] he will turn and reveal
[31:02] himself to the people of this next flag
[31:08] sir and they too shall know that this
[31:13] one is their King this one is their end
[31:18] sign
[31:20] also thank you
[31:28] thank you
[31:32] Brothers we're
[31:34] identified with all of its
[31:37] Glory we're here today as part of the
[31:40] human
[31:42] community and as humans were identified
[31:45] with all of the failures of
[31:48] humanity we're identified with Adam and
[31:51] Eve's
[31:52] transgression and their fall we're
[31:55] identified with the deception that took
[31:57] place place in the Garden of Eden we
[32:00] might say well I don't identify it as a
[32:02] human in the human Community we all are
[32:07] marked in our bodies by what happened in
[32:11] Eden because every man every woman every
[32:14] child here is identified by
[32:18] death in a as a human we're
[32:21] dying but as a Son of God we're
[32:25] alive we have eternal life and that
[32:28] eternal life never had a beginning and
[32:31] does not have an
[32:33] end and if we don't have that you're
[32:36] lost hopelessly lost and if you haven't
[32:40] come to the time where you say I switch
[32:42] my allegiance from my country to that
[32:47] ins sign of the word of God hallelujah
[32:52] doesn't mean we reject our country not
[32:54] at all I say that the only real true
[32:57] good CI czen of a country is a born
[33:00] again son or daughter of
[33:08] God we are identified with
[33:10] it we're identified with Adam's
[33:13] transgression and the Bible says for If
[33:17] by if by one man's offense death reigned
[33:22] by
[33:24] one I may be misunderstood and perhaps I
[33:28] may have to even go back and explain
[33:30] some things but the scripture says that
[33:33] death rained rained that's Supremacy by
[33:39] one death became
[33:45] king much more they which receive
[33:48] abundance of Grace and of the gift of
[33:50] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[33:55] Jesus Christ amen that as Sin hath
[33:58] reigned unto death even so might grace
[34:03] Reign through righteousness unto eternal
[34:06] life by Jesus Christ Our Lord now the
[34:09] believer can say grace is
[34:12] King
[34:13] Hallelujah death was King death reigned
[34:17] by one man and in the human life in the
[34:20] human body we're identified in our body
[34:23] we're marked by his
[34:26] transgression you you can can say this
[34:28] morning as I spoke last Sunday on
[34:30] attribution by attribution you can say I
[34:33] didn't ask for this I didn't ask to be
[34:35] born in a world filled with sin and
[34:38] trouble and Injustice and I didn't I
[34:41] didn't ask to be born in a world that's
[34:43] full of war and our best boys dying on
[34:46] the
[34:47] fields 54 million died in the last
[34:51] second world war 54 million and you
[34:54] never heard it until a prophet came and
[34:56] said the Earth was suffering a birth
[34:58] pain it had a great birth pain in the
[35:02] first world war and men were gasped and
[35:05] laid out on the on the grounds of of the
[35:08] best of all of the countries we're not
[35:11] in we're not here to take up the sight
[35:13] of one against the other or this one
[35:14] against that one it's it's it's sin it's
[35:18] the devil it's death it's is all that
[35:21] comes it's from Satan and the pride of
[35:25] man and the deception of man has cost us
[35:28] a very great price no wonder I mean it
[35:33] it should beat in the heart of every of
[35:35] of any man any woman that even has a
[35:38] basic human intelligence they ought to
[35:40] say whoever started this entire Globe
[35:44] here this little piece of dust that's
[35:46] circling out into the great Universe
[35:49] whoever started it it's time for him to
[35:51] come back it's time for him to correct
[35:54] it all it's time for him to take and
[35:56] burn his ution out of the earth and out
[35:59] of the air and the prophet says and he
[36:01] shall do it and make it a fit dwelling
[36:04] place for himself and his bride
[36:07] Hallelujah I rejoice in that friends
[36:10] it's going to be a whole lot more than
[36:11] an
[36:12] eima Calvary that piece of rock on
[36:15] Calvary where they put the cross of
[36:18] Jesus Christ and hung the Son of God
[36:20] there dying for you and dying for me I
[36:24] tell you that's our end sign
[36:28] the boys fought a bloody battle getting
[36:30] up on top of me with Jer but I'll tell
[36:33] you another one he didn't go with a
[36:35] whole bunch of guns he didn't go with a
[36:37] bunch of ships backing him up he didn't
[36:39] go with dive bombers coming down he
[36:42] walked up there
[36:43] alone Hallelujah he walked up alone God
[36:48] In the Flesh hallu
[36:51] Hallelujah and he would not be deterred
[36:54] from his footsteps those are the blood
[36:57] footsteps that walked up to the Mount
[37:00] Calvary go and there hung alone before a
[37:05] world I tell you my brother my sister
[37:08] that's why you're here we're not here
[37:10] just having Church we're here to say I
[37:13] swear allegiance to the
[37:14] [Music]
[37:16] Lamb with all that I am with all that I
[37:21] can be with all that I have and all that
[37:23] I am I swear allegiance to this one amen
[37:29] hallelujah and the scripture goes on to
[37:32] say
[37:34] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[37:38] Moses death reigned death was
[37:40] King from Adam to Moses why because it
[37:44] was not until Moses when God would raise
[37:49] up this one who was first a prophet with
[37:52] the word in his mouth and come down from
[37:55] Another Mountain sin
[37:58] with the word in his mouth and it says
[38:00] and death reigned from Adam to Moses
[38:03] even over them that had not sinned after
[38:07] the similitude of Adam's
[38:10] transgression you might say I didn't sin
[38:14] like Adam sinned I didn't do that I
[38:16] didn't want
[38:18] that but we're identified with it right
[38:22] as
[38:23] humans and the penalty Came Upon Us by
[38:30] attribution I know a little bit about
[38:33] death so do
[38:36] you I've stood
[38:38] by the caskets of too many people I've
[38:41] stood in the in the rooms of too many
[38:46] people that are
[38:48] dying how brother Bram says nothing
[38:50] wants to die animals don't want to die
[38:53] things always are doing everything they
[38:55] can to escape death in the agony of
[38:58] death they don't want to die birds don't
[39:00] want to die nothing wants to die they
[39:02] try to escape it as a man
[39:05] struggles and he says with the death
[39:07] gurgling in his throat striving trying
[39:10] to struggling to just get another breath
[39:13] and live a little bit longer he doesn't
[39:15] want to die but he says the dying tree
[39:18] and the dying flower and the dying man
[39:20] down here only testifies that there's
[39:23] another land where the tree doesn't die
[39:26] and the flower doesn't die and the man
[39:28] the woman doesn't die Hallelujah do you
[39:31] want to go there do you plan to go there
[39:36] have you made your reservations you plan
[39:38] to be
[39:41] there that's why we're here we're not
[39:44] here just having Church we're not here
[39:46] just to have a good time we're certainly
[39:49] not here to be entertained we're here to
[39:51] be a participant in this great body
[39:53] called the body of Jesus Christ The
[39:56] Bride of Jesus Christ Christ and the
[39:59] message that you say you believe and
[40:00] we've come here in comfort of your car
[40:03] your automobile and come into this into
[40:05] this sanctuary and sit here today in the
[40:07] comfort of this room just remember this
[40:10] message did not come here in that kind
[40:12] of comfort this message came here with a
[40:15] little Prophet you ought to you ought to
[40:17] listen to and and hear a service and
[40:19] just watch where he went the next day
[40:21] and the next day and the next day week
[40:23] in and week out and month in and months
[40:25] out with Harley moment rest for his body
[40:29] and I I can't even imagine knowing what
[40:31] time it takes for me to study and
[40:33] prepare for a service and he's going
[40:35] night after night after night and having
[40:38] the people come forward and and the
[40:40] pulling on him and the visions that are
[40:43] coming till they almost packing him out
[40:45] literally are packing him out that's how
[40:47] this message
[40:50] came didn't come for us to sit and
[40:52] quibble about didn't come for us to sit
[40:55] and try to find some little uh special
[40:58] thing that excludes everybody else that
[41:01] isn't why it came it came so we could
[41:03] include the
[41:06] others
[41:11] Hallelujah and as we did not transgress
[41:14] after Adam's transgression after the
[41:18] similitude of his transgression the
[41:20] penalty of his transgression passed upon
[41:24] all okay what is the way of out what is
[41:28] the answer for this God has made a
[41:32] program and the program happens to be
[41:35] very simple but it is absolute and that
[41:40] program is this God speaks his
[41:44] word god confirms that word as being his
[41:49] word you and I are responsible to
[41:53] believe that word and in the simple Act
[41:57] of believing it God looks down and says
[42:01] you are
[42:04] righteous Hallelujah by my decree you
[42:08] are righteous on this side as an
[42:11] unbeliever by his decree you're a dying
[42:16] human and you're already dead
[42:19] spiritually but by his decree if you
[42:22] simply believe what he said and believe
[42:25] it's his word and say I believe it he
[42:28] declares you're
[42:31] righteous and he he gives you the gift
[42:34] of eternal life though you could never
[42:36] earn it it is that
[42:40] simple some say I want a deep res
[42:43] Revelation that's a deep
[42:46] one that's a deep one because if Satan
[42:50] wants to do anything he'll he'll
[42:52] Sidetrack people get their minds going
[42:55] many a multitude of different directions
[42:58] trying to get you away from the main
[43:00] main uh theme and that theme is do you
[43:03] believe or do you
[43:12] disbelieve as I mentioned last
[43:15] week when God had
[43:18] raised Out of the Dust of the
[43:22] earth you might not youve looked at
[43:25] flags and whatever you thought when your
[43:28] flag came
[43:30] up it it it wouldn't even begin it
[43:33] wouldn't even be a spark of what was in
[43:38] God's mind and
[43:41] heart when he saw all of his creation
[43:45] was made and came up and let the grass
[43:47] bring forth and let the waters bring
[43:49] forth and created Created his
[43:54] Eden and it was so marvelous
[43:59] and then he put his own son
[44:01] there an end
[44:03] sign that this is mine this is mine and
[44:08] it was so
[44:09] wonderful when he had finally took out
[44:13] of the Dust of the earth and raised the
[44:14] dust to its highest position and had one
[44:18] like
[44:19] himself and he came
[44:21] down and had to have fellowship with his
[44:25] son oh and he walked with him I believe
[44:28] there's just something very special in
[44:31] the very mind and heart and bosom of God
[44:34] it's coming now the cool of the
[44:37] day oh I look forward to this time in
[44:40] the cool of the day when I'll be able to
[44:43] go down and fellowship with my son and
[44:46] walk with them in the in the beautiful
[44:49] gardens of paradise and have the trees
[44:52] and the and the uh the birds singing and
[44:56] be there and have
[44:58] Fellowship that was his ins sign and he
[45:01] raised it up this is my standard this is
[45:05] my image and then the image fell the
[45:10] image was worse than spit on the image
[45:14] was
[45:15] disgraced and it was crushed and it no
[45:19] more resembled
[45:24] him the prophet says he went right
[45:27] away I will raise it up
[45:30] again Hallelujah I will rebuild it again
[45:34] I cannot leave it laying down there in
[45:36] the dust I cannot leave it there stepped
[45:38] on I can't leave it there
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:42] dying I will raise it up
[45:46] again and he could only raise it up by
[45:48] finding those that would
[45:52] believe him and Abraham believed God and
[45:58] the scripture says and it was counted to
[46:01] him for
[46:02] righteousness in other words Abraham
[46:05] believed God and God took the
[46:08] attribution of death from him and
[46:10] attributed him with righteousness and
[46:13] said you are as you were supposed to be
[46:17] Hallelujah you're dying you're an old
[46:19] man but I I decree that you are as you
[46:24] were supposed to be as you were int
[46:26] intended to be in my mind in my
[46:30] thoughts we walk
[46:32] again in the paradise of God and all
[46:36] down through the centuries of time came
[46:40] people and God Faithfully in each
[46:44] generation sending his word for his word
[46:47] was his ins sign and the people would
[46:49] look upon the end sign and they would
[46:51] see the ins sign and something would
[46:53] move in their heart say that's that's my
[46:56] country
[46:59] read in this ins sign it
[47:04] spoke these flags can't speak we just
[47:08] have something in our heart because our
[47:10] mind and our memory and our imagination
[47:12] is filled with what it what it
[47:15] represents and we say I'm identified
[47:18] with that representation amen but now
[47:22] was another one and this s sign
[47:25] spoke that I go to prepare a place for
[47:28] you Hallelujah and where I am there you
[47:32] shall be
[47:34] also this IGN speaks this IGN has a
[47:41] voice this n sign had a
[47:44] secret so I'm going to hold the
[47:46] secret till the very end time when I'm
[47:49] ready to call them home to the place
[47:52] that I've got ready for them and then
[47:55] I'm going to come myself
[47:57] I'm going to come oh my friends I'm
[48:00] going to be short this morning even I
[48:02] got so much in my heart but he said I'm
[48:05] going to hold it and this secret only
[48:08] the lamb himself can speak this and can
[48:11] loose it I'm going to I'm going to come
[48:13] to receive them to myself and the
[48:16] prophet says that that was the very
[48:17] Revelation that was the message in
[48:19] hearing the message and receiving it was
[48:21] him receiving you not you receiving
[48:25] him Amen to receive them I will come and
[48:29] receive them to myself and that is when
[48:31] you heard his
[48:33] voice and he drew you to himself
[48:36] Hallelujah he was already receiving you
[48:38] which is part and parcel of his
[48:41] coming Hallelujah that's part of his
[48:44] coming people are waiting to say oh when
[48:46] the Lord comes when the Lord comes he he
[48:49] already has
[48:50] arrived in word
[48:53] form his word coming to speak the word
[48:58] and a group of people will say I don't
[48:59] believe that I can't swallow that but
[49:03] there's another one says and they're CH
[49:05] they're Abraham's children by
[49:08] attribution and they're like their
[49:10] father they're like Abraham I can't
[49:13] understand that I don't understand how
[49:15] my body is going to be changed I don't
[49:17] understand how I'm going to bring forth
[49:18] Christ I'm so
[49:20] [Music]
[49:22] needy he knows
[49:24] that but he attributes
[49:27] his life by
[49:34] attribution I say is there nothing for
[49:36] us to do oh yes of course but our
[49:40] works our works do not bring us any I
[49:45] say zero
[49:48] righteousness his righteousness is
[49:51] because he attributed it to you our
[49:54] works is that what we do because he has
[49:58] because he has loved us because he has
[50:01] saved us we do it out of love we don't
[50:03] do it out of service we do it out of
[50:06] love
[50:12] Hallelujah
[50:14] sin through an inherent sinful
[50:18] nature and death through
[50:21] sin passed upon
[50:24] all and now I'm going to read a number
[50:27] of
[50:28] scriptures and this if you want to
[50:30] follow along it'll be good for you to
[50:31] turn to Romans the 5th
[50:41] chapter we start reading at verse
[50:45] 12 just so it gets really established in
[50:49] your
[50:50] heart wherefore as by one man sin
[50:53] entered into the world and death by sin
[50:57] so death passed upon all men for that
[51:02] all have sinned for until the law sin
[51:06] was in the world but sin is not
[51:09] imputed when there is no law
[51:13] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[51:16] Moses even over them that had not sinned
[51:19] after the similitude of Adam's
[51:21] transgression who is the figure of him
[51:24] that was to come
[51:26] but not as the offense so also is the
[51:29] free gift for if through the offense of
[51:33] one many be dead understand that for if
[51:39] through the offense of one many be dead
[51:41] the many are dead by attribution they
[51:44] did not sin as as the original Parent
[51:47] did much more the grace of God and the
[51:52] gift of by Grace which is by one man
[51:56] Jesus Christ hath abounded unto many and
[52:01] not as it was by one that sinned and not
[52:05] as it was by one that Sinn so is the
[52:08] gift for the Judgment was by one to
[52:11] condemnation but the free gift is to
[52:14] many offenses unto justification and the
[52:19] people could say
[52:20] amen for If by one man's offense death
[52:24] Reign by one see death became king much
[52:28] more they which receive abundance of
[52:31] Grace and of the gift of righteousness
[52:34] shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[52:39] therefore as by the offense by of one
[52:42] judgment Came Upon all men to
[52:47] condemnation even so by the
[52:49] righteousness of
[52:51] one the free gift came upon all men unto
[52:56] to justification of Life
[52:59] hallelujah oh we want to say grace is
[53:04] King let's say it together Grace is king
[53:08] king of my life I Crown thee now my
[53:13] thine let the the glory be king of my
[53:16] life Grace this morning is
[53:21] King remember that not condemnation is
[53:25] King not death is King you say well I am
[53:28] dying I am getting older but Grace is
[53:31] King because who is greater the one who
[53:35] brought the offense or the one who
[53:36] brought the free gift the grace he's the
[53:39] great
[53:42] one and one more
[53:45] verse verse 21 now that as Sin hath
[53:50] reigned unto death even so might grace
[53:54] Reign through righteousness unto eternal
[53:57] life by Jesus Christ Our Lord and to
[54:02] Reign I say grace is King but to Reign
[54:06] it is not only to be king but to
[54:09] exercise kingly power to exercise the
[54:12] highest influence there was a time and
[54:15] you know what there are people who say
[54:17] they are believers say they are
[54:19] Christians but condemnation Reigns in
[54:23] them
[54:27] and I'm not surprised that you're here
[54:30] this
[54:31] morning and you live with
[54:35] condemnation you can never tell me that
[54:37] condemnation makes you feel and have a
[54:40] sense oh I just want to worship God I
[54:43] just want to serve him condemnation
[54:45] doesn't do that condemnation drives you
[54:48] down drives you down and I can tell you
[54:51] that Satan is filled with Glee when he
[54:53] sees you under condemnation and death is
[54:57] King condemnation which came by death
[55:00] which comes by this this uh foul enemy
[55:03] condemnation is a real
[55:06] thing you C you cannot find manic
[55:09] depression in the Bible but you can find
[55:12] condemnation in the Bible and all of
[55:15] these nice terms that they have and they
[55:17] have a uh medicinal uh you know uh the
[55:21] pharmacy the local pharmacy can give you
[55:24] something the local doctor can prescribe
[55:27] something for for this depression I got
[55:29] a name for depression the letter is
[55:31] still D and it's called the devil it is
[55:35] the devil the prophet says You may call
[55:37] it cancer that's a name you give it it
[55:40] is a devil and I respect I respect with
[55:44] all my heart not just what a man was
[55:46] saying said brother brandom said that to
[55:48] me he
[55:50] represented he represented and spoke a
[55:53] word that for my part is the ins sign in
[55:56] the end
[55:57] time
[55:59] Hallelujah and unless you are prepared
[56:03] to hold that ins sign up I mean you you
[56:07] should be
[56:10] prepared even more so than the brave
[56:14] Marines on eima you should be more
[56:17] prepared whatever the cost and whatever
[56:20] it takes and whatever resource whatever
[56:23] energy I have a loyalty in my heart to
[56:26] this one who's hung on
[56:29] Calvary Hallelujah and my allegiance
[56:32] goes to
[56:34] him and if that's not in your
[56:37] heart it's a hypocrisy to say I'm a
[56:41] Christian we're not riding along On Easy
[56:44] Street just to be identified so I'm
[56:47] identified with Bible way you can go
[56:49] straight to hell with that people say
[56:52] I'm identified with Christianity you can
[56:55] go straight to hell still with that on
[56:57] your lips but when you say God has
[57:00] spoken God has sent his word God has
[57:03] confirmed his word God has clearly
[57:06] identified that this is of him that he
[57:09] sent
[57:12] this I say who did this
[57:15] Vindication who did this
[57:18] Vindication in this message who
[57:20] Vindicated this
[57:24] message I wouldn't advise you to do this
[57:27] but I have done it amen I've sat with
[57:31] people that were
[57:33] antagonistic against the servant of God
[57:36] against the prophet of God against his
[57:38] ministry against his
[57:41] message and when I get right into that
[57:43] tight tight time when they're so opposed
[57:46] to
[57:47] it I say to them and I have said it on
[57:51] occasion but I don't recommend unless
[57:53] you've been fully led by the Holy Spirit
[57:56] to do so but I felt I was led and I
[57:58] said well then say that he was of the
[58:05] devil say that this message is of
[58:09] Satan and they becomes
[58:11] silent and I don't let them go brother
[58:14] Ernie I said say it I want you to say
[58:17] it go ahead and say it say this message
[58:21] is of the devil and say this ministry is
[58:24] of the devil and say that he was of the
[58:25] devil
[58:27] and their own silence condemns them
[58:34] Hallelujah they may be very religious
[58:37] and they'll tangle and antagonistic
[58:39] against it but they're
[58:42] afraid but this Prophet wasn't afraid to
[58:45] say your denomination is of the
[58:47] devil your denomination came from Rome
[58:51] it was birthed at n and it's of the
[58:54] devil
[58:57] he wasn't afraid to say what was of
[58:59] Satan and I say today uh before this end
[59:03] sign that's been lifted up in this end
[59:05] time this Vindication was none other
[59:08] than God
[59:09] himself that's why he said he's a mighty
[59:12] God
[59:13] unveiled not veiled not hidden
[59:17] unveiled why unveiled so the people
[59:19] would be forced to look at
[59:22] it this cross that hung on Mount Calvary
[59:25] on that rock pile called gotha and he
[59:29] the prophet said that day The Mercy Seat
[59:33] which was always hidden in the in the
[59:35] holy of holies of the Tabernacle but
[59:38] this day God pulled the veil off and he
[59:42] hung there he said The Mercy Seat was
[59:44] fully
[59:48] exposed and the Bible says they walked
[59:52] by people who never were able to see see
[59:56] The Mercy
[59:57] Seat walked
[59:59] by and looked on The Mercy Seat in full
[1:00:04] View and Bible says they wagged their
[1:00:07] heads they thought it was such a failure
[1:00:10] they thought it was such a a
[1:00:12] loss he was a good man he was a great
[1:00:15] teacher what a
[1:00:18] shame and there was God when they
[1:00:21] thought all they thought the whole
[1:00:24] system was collapsing there was God
[1:00:27] taking off the veil and the
[1:00:29] seals and say it's in full view the
[1:00:33] mercy seats in full of
[1:00:35] view God's ins sign was hanging on
[1:00:38] Calvary on another pole not eima Mount
[1:00:48] Goa there came another mountain called

[1:00:52] Sunset and a redeemed
[1:00:54] son a SA d a born again a redeemed son
[1:00:58] had come to
[1:01:00] maturity and now the time has come a
[1:01:04] sworn affidavit to the people and a
[1:01:07] sworn affidavit is a legal document
[1:01:10] absolutely binding not by some attorney
[1:01:15] or Not by your attorney or your lawyer
[1:01:18] not by that but by God himself says I
[1:01:21] bind myself to this word and he
[1:01:24] descended with one foot upon the land
[1:01:27] and one foot that was amongst the people
[1:01:30] the land and the Sea identify the people
[1:01:33] it came down amongst the people
[1:01:36] hallelujah my goodness and declared this

[1:01:42] document and I have a servant on Earth
[1:01:44] that's been proven and tested and
[1:01:46] everything that he spoke has been true
[1:01:48] true true this is the spirit of Truth he
[1:01:52] is my ordained vessel predestinated as
[1:01:55] the last messenger and now I give to the
[1:01:58] people my binding
[1:02:01] document and I raise up for
[1:02:04] them the end

[1:07:17] Thomas he's going to be baptized

[1:07:25] going up in Bima something moved in his
[1:07:27] heart that was a marine Brother Gary St
[1:07:31] John was a marine something moves in
[1:07:34] their heart when they see Oh
[1:07:36] Glory raised up but in this
[1:07:40] day in this day something moves in my
[1:07:44] heart and I see him raised up before the
[1:07:48] people and that why you see the Prophet
[1:07:51] The Prophet I tell you what he was so
[1:07:53] moved he was so moved by his Beauty when
[1:07:57] he saw him raised up he saw the message
[1:07:59] being raised up and I can see as I wear
[1:08:02] his hands on that pool raising it up so
[1:08:07] the raise it up high on the hill so the
[1:08:10] people can see people can see far it'll
[1:08:14] go far and wide and he knew there'd be a
[1:08:17] company of
[1:08:18] people I I I'm amazed sometime when he
[1:08:21] be speaking to just a handful of people
[1:08:24] and he said these tapes go to the
[1:08:27] jungles these tapes go around the world
[1:08:31] you saw there would be people that would
[1:08:33] come and they would be gather when I saw

[1:09:14] I give my all I believe it with all my
[1:09:17] heart I don't understand it but I
[1:09:19] believe it with everything that's in
[1:09:22] me and the life the life from that
[1:09:26] inside either I'm a liar or this is the
[1:09:29] truth of God's word the life from that
[1:09:31] inside will come into you and dwell in
[1:09:35] you and make you make you one with
[1:09:40] it we can stand before our flag and say
[1:09:45] what it is I am amen I'm identified with

[1:09:54] there at the Boston tea party I was
[1:09:56] there with George Washington I was there
[1:09:58] and yet it all has to Be
[1:10:01] Imagined but this identification doesn't
[1:10:04] have to be imagined this identification
[1:10:07] is a
[1:10:09] reality this identification is the same
[1:10:12] spirit that was in him comes into
[1:10:18] you do you believe
[1:10:22] it we are one
[1:10:25] with him amen and if God is dealing with
[1:10:28] you and speaking to you I would take
[1:10:31] about one tenth of one second to respond
[1:10:33] to it I wouldn't I wouldn't wait and say
[1:10:36] well I'm drafted and I'm pulled and I'm
[1:10:38] trained before I come up to my this
[1:10:42] mountain I would say no I'm going to

[1:10:46] I am to him right
[1:10:52] now and he will pass upon you

[1:11:08] transgression in this flesh you didn't
[1:11:10] get half of the penalty you're not half

[1:17:56] this it's not a
[1:17:59] flag it's a
[1:18:03] life not a
[1:18:06] flag and let us not have
[1:18:10] men and women who've devoted their lives
[1:18:14] to fight for their country put you and I
[1:18:17] to
[1:18:18] shame with the allegiance that they have
[1:18:22] for a country that is passing in off the
[1:18:26] scene and you and I that are sitting
[1:18:29] here let us not be put to shame by men
[1:18:32] and women who belong to some
[1:18:34] denomination or some organization and
[1:18:37] they would just serve that thing just
[1:18:39] night and day I urge you with all that's
[1:18:41] in me give your
[1:18:44] best to this Kingdom to this an sign
[1:18:49] that is raised up in this end
[1:18:52] time and I'll close with this
[1:18:56] in
[1:18:58] 1962 in Phoenix I believe it was brother
[1:19:01] Brandon preached an N
[1:19:04] sign and he just what the ins sign
[1:19:09] was and what it is today and who it is
[1:19:13] he preached on an end sign he says I've
[1:19:15] lifted it up before you and he calls the
[1:19:18] people to prove that that was our ins
[1:19:22] sign and he tells one after after the
[1:19:25] other after the other after the other
[1:19:27] the supernatural truth of indication so
[1:19:30] that we can sit here today and say oh
[1:19:33] God how wonderful it is it's without
[1:19:38] error without a mistake it's truth my
[1:19:43] ins sign I don't care which flag came up
[1:19:46] today I don't care which flag you're
[1:19:49] represented with there isn't a man or
[1:19:51] woman in the right mind that can stand
[1:19:53] up and say My Flag represents
[1:19:59] truth it
[1:20:01] doesn't the you can put the best men the
[1:20:04] best woman in the government but the
[1:20:07] there a system will corrupt
[1:20:10] them even the prophet said that even men
[1:20:13] that go into the priesthood or a nun
[1:20:15] that goes to be a nun and cloer
[1:20:18] themselves he said they don't go there
[1:20:20] to be bad people they go there to be
[1:20:22] good people but the system corrupts
[1:20:26] them politics corrupt the people
[1:20:29] politics in the church corrupts people
[1:20:32] we're not interested in politics we're
[1:20:34] interested in truth but I can point to
[1:20:36] my end sign my Christ that's lifted up I
[1:20:40] can say he is truth all truth there's no
[1:20:44] error in him there's no weakness in him
[1:20:48] there's no Frailty in
[1:20:51] him he deserves amen your allall your
[1:20:56] all and I would urge you today to give
[1:20:59] him your all sir and don't hesitate amen
[1:21:04] give him your all I wonder if we could
