[17:43] Ask Brother John Andy's, Brother John,
[17:45] if you would just come open the service
[17:47] in a word of prayer. We want to remember
[17:50] brother Ricardo Gonzalez this morning
[17:52] and his father's family. Uh Ricardo's
[17:56] sister passed away this uh father's
[17:58] sister passed away this morning. So we
[18:00] just want to uplift the family as I
[18:02] believe brother Ricardo and Buffy will
[18:03] probably be with the family this
[18:04] morning. So we just want to uplift them.
[18:07] If you have a need on on your heart,
[18:09] just raise it as we would a prayer.
[18:10] Brother John, if you would come.
[18:13] [Music]
[18:17] Hallelujah Jesus.
[18:20] Thank you Jesus. We just want to worship
[18:23] you for a moment, God.
[18:26] Seeking shepherd, God, you found us.
[18:29] So lost, so undone
[18:32] on our road to hell.
[18:36] Caught in the thicket somewhere, God,
[18:38] you found us. Lord, we just want to take
[18:41] a little time to give you glory this
[18:43] morning. Open up these mouths of ours.
[18:47] Open up these hearts of ours. We were
[18:50] undone.
[18:51] We were broken.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; We were shattered.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; We were in despair.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; We were in the shadows. We were sick.
[19:03] [Music]
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Something somewhere came by our way this
[19:08] morning. We're worshippers, Lord.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; We just want to lift up these hands of
[19:12] ours, these hearts of ours.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[19:18] It's still amazing after all these years
[19:22] to think that you had come to the likes
[19:23] of us,
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus, God. And give us another chance,
[19:29] another opportunity, even to live in
[19:32] this life and victory, but then to
[19:34] promise us eternal life and a land
[19:37] beyond the river and a future home. And
[19:41] &gt;&gt; it goes beyond our minds, Lord. We don't
[19:43] even know how to think, Lord, when it
[19:46] comes to these things.
[19:49] Lord, we're in need of healing this
[19:51] morning, Jesus. Hands are lifted up.
[19:53] There's burdens on our hearts, unspoken
[19:56] requests, burdens. Lord, we're
[19:59] approaching you as our father, our God,
[20:03] the only true living God. We sing about
[20:07] you. We hear about you.
[20:09] Lord, we're mindful of everyone that's
[20:11] here. Lord, they've come from all over
[20:13] the globe. from India, Africa, China,
[20:17] Vietnam, Europe, North America,
[20:20] Australia. We've come to worship you,
[20:23] God. We are here for a thirst. We have a
[20:26] hunger for you. See your glory, Lord.
[20:31] See you in our mothers, see you in our
[20:33] fathers, see you in our children, see
[20:37] you in the brother next to us, the
[20:38] sister next to us. to see your glory
[20:42] manifested in our flesh. Lord,
[20:46] &gt;&gt; you are our healer.
[20:48] &gt;&gt; You are our savior.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; You're the miracle worker, God. You're
[20:53] the provider, Lord.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're able to do what we cannot
[20:58] do. And you've done that in the past.
[21:01] And we're here this morning as believers
[21:04] because we love you. This isn't just a
[21:08] church or a gathering. We're not just
[21:10] going to hear words of a sermon. We're
[21:12] not just hearing music. We're in your
[21:15] presence. Lord, your atmosphere is here.
[21:18] The theophanes are in this building.
[21:21] Lord, your your angels have been
[21:23] dispatched to this place. They love this
[21:26] presence. We love this presence. We want
[21:28] to get out of the way this morning, God.
[21:31] If there's sin among us, we want to deal
[21:34] with it right now.
[21:37] forgive us of our sins. We're putting
[21:40] our hands upon the lamb of God. The
[21:43] quivering lamb of Calvary.
[21:46] Calvary was sufficient for our sins, for
[21:49] the sins of the world. You are so great
[21:52] and so mighty. You're able this morning
[21:55] to go to the deepest hearts, the deepest
[21:58] hell or the lowest valley. And Lord, I
[22:02] pray that you would go to those places.
[22:04] Lord, hands are lifted up. Our hearts
[22:06] are lifted up. We want to see you, Lord,
[22:09] manifested in issues and lives and
[22:12] situations.
[22:13] And we just come humbly, Lord, asking
[22:15] you to go with Brother Ricardo and his
[22:18] wife and his family, those that'll be
[22:20] gathered for this season. There's loved
[22:23] ones. There's unspoken requests that are
[22:26] here. God, would you be our strength,
[22:28] Lord? Would you be our salvation? We're
[22:31] looking to you, Lord, to win our hearts,
[22:34] to heal lands, to restore, Lord, all the
[22:38] years. Only you are able to do the
[22:41] supernatural, God. But we believe we're
[22:44] in the presence of a supernatural, God.
[22:47] So come down this morning and consume
[22:49] every sacrifice.
[22:51] Affect us, God, eternally. Impact our
[22:54] lives, Lord, not just on the emotion or
[22:57] on the body, but in our souls. create
[23:01] Lord this morning from your very heart
[23:04] what needs to take place. And we're all
[23:07] praying according to your will be done.
[23:09] Come down in this meeting and take our
[23:11] pastor, use his gift, Lord, that you've
[23:14] placed in his life. Once more, Lord,
[23:17] would you just breathe across the keys
[23:20] of our souls and our lives, Lord?
[23:23] Someone would be sick among us that you
[23:25] would just come by their way this
[23:27] morning. Maybe today is the day that the
[23:30] angel would visit their address, God.
[23:34] You can do anything, Lord. Nothing is
[23:37] too hard for you. And we release our
[23:40] faith and pray throughout this service,
[23:42] God, that you would release more faith
[23:45] to our lives, revelation, and hearts and
[23:49] and minds and thoughts that are from
[23:51] that other dimension. that it would just
[23:53] drop down into this place that demon
[23:56] spirits would lose their grip.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Things that are undone, things that are
[24:02] in the darkness, that you would bring
[24:04] them to the surface. And may the light
[24:06] of God shine, Lord, in areas that only
[24:10] you, God, can do, Lord. Lord Jesus,
[24:14] we're in your presence now. May you just
[24:17] speak to our lives, speak to our hearts.
[24:20] We want to see you moving, Lord, in our
[24:23] lives, in this meeting, God, from the
[24:25] front to the back, in the on the
[24:27] internet, Lord, on the phone hookup, in
[24:29] the nursery, in the fellowship hall.
[24:32] Lord, we're here. We're waiting to hear
[24:34] your voice, God. We love you this
[24:36] morning, Jesus.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; Come by this way again,
[24:41] &gt;&gt; and we'll respond appropriately, God.
[24:44] take our lives and consume us with your
[24:48] spirit and by your fire, God, take us
[24:51] away into that other dimension where all
[24:53] things are possible. Lord,
[24:56] &gt;&gt; we worship you, Jesus. And we thank you
[24:58] already for what you're doing, what
[25:00] you're going to do, what you've done,
[25:02] Lord.

[35:25] We walk by faith
[35:29] and not by sight.
[35:33] Our eyes look to the unseen,
[35:38] the Lord Jesus Christ. For he has

[35:45] that we will reign with him.
[35:49] But the pathway to glory is through
[35:54] suffering.
[35:57] So count it all joy when you fall in
[36:02] diverse temptations
[36:05] for it's only to bring you to that
[36:09] perfect place.

[36:16] and we are dry
[36:20] yet in the midst of it all.

[36:32] patience.

[37:04] Sometimes we pray,
[37:08] "Oh Lord, please take my life.
[37:12] I just can't go on. I don't know what to
[37:17] do."
[37:19] But in that hour,
[37:23] we find our juniper tree
[37:28] where the angel comes to strengthen for
[37:32] the journey ahead.
[37:35] For in our weakness
[37:39] his strength is made perfect and his
[37:44] grace is sufficient for us.
[37:50] We are testing
[37:53] and we are trying
[37:57] yet in the midst of it all.
[38:01] We get a piece of mind
[38:05] for the tri of our faith. working
[38:12] for in my lowest valley. He restores
[38:18] my soul
[38:20] and he gives me strength to keep
[38:23] pressing on.
[38:34] In the midst of it all,
[38:37] we get a peace of mind
[38:41] for the tri of our faith work.
[38:49] In my lowest valley, he restores my soul
[38:56] and he gives me strength to keep
[38:59] pressing on.
[39:02] For though we are testing it all and we
[39:07] are trying
[39:10] the midst of
[39:13] we can have peace of mind every day.
[39:18] The tri of our faith
[39:25] and the my
[39:29] restore my soul
[39:32] and he gives me strength to keep
[39:35] pressing on.
[39:38] Although we are testing
[39:42] and we are trying
[39:45] [Applause]
[39:48] [Music]
[39:50] we get a piece of mind
[39:53] for the trying of our faith work
[40:02] [Music]
[40:05] restoring my soul
[40:08] And he gives me strength when I'm down
[40:10] in the valley. He gives me strength
[40:13] &gt;&gt; in the midst of my trial. He gives me

[40:20] strength to keep pressing on.

[40:32] soul.

[40:38] And he gives me strength to keep
[40:42] pressing on.
[40:46] Yes, he gives me strength to keep
[40:49] pressing on.
[40:53] [Music]
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:12] Amen. Thank you, choir. Definitely gives
[41:14] us strength to keep pressing on. I know
[41:17] brother Derek and his wife Debbie are
[41:19] going to have their baby dedicated if
[41:20] they want to come and get ready at this
[41:21] time. Brother Derek was telling me in
[41:23] the back study he says the choir is
[41:24] going to be singing this song. The
[41:26] reason I'm having him sing this song is
[41:27] because this is the exact song that's
[41:28] kept us through this little trial we're
[41:30] having with our little baby and song
[41:33] that came to my heart by the Derek is I
[41:35] believe God I know you kind of you said
[41:38] last last week you said when I come up
[41:39] here next Sunday I'm going to have a
[41:41] testimony. Well the song I want to sing
[41:43] next is he's already provided.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to believe as a church
[41:47] that God's going to meet brother Derek
[41:49] Sister Debbiey's need this morning.
[41:50] Amen. So as they come and get ready for
[41:52] baby dedication, let's sing.
[41:56] He's already
[41:59] proided.
[42:02] He's already
[42:06] proided.
[42:09] Oh, everything
[42:14] he's already provided.
[42:18] [Music]
[42:21] Every pro you can make
[42:27] just as he is
[42:33] everything you need.
[42:37] He's already provided
[42:41] [Music]
[42:45] and provided abundantly.
[42:47] Amen.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; We see that our brother Derek and sister
[42:51] Debbie are being
[42:54] provided for
[42:56] abundantly in many ways with this uh
[43:01] latest edition which is David Alexander
[43:06] and Sister Debbiey's mother and father
[43:08] are here
[43:10] also. her sister Brittany, her mother
[43:14] and father Terry and Joanne Savory. I
[43:18] wonder if they could just stand and we'd
[43:19] like to recognize them as well.
[43:22] Here they are
[43:28] here.
[43:32] For those of this congregation, we've
[43:34] been praying for David
[43:38] and uh for his physical need.
[43:42] The Bible says that they brought young
[43:46] children to him that he should touch
[43:49] them. That's about as far as I got.
[43:51] Brother David, I mean, Brother Derek,
[43:54] for David,
[43:59] I uh actually I want to tell you,
[44:02] Brother Derek, Sister Debbie, I really
[44:05] sense the presence of God
[44:08] as I waited on the Lord just in the
[44:10] study. Now
[44:12] generally I have uh families they inform
[44:15] me on Saturday that who's coming and
[44:20] everything is on and
[44:22] brother Derek because he's a very
[44:27] you know uh
[44:30] he does things
[44:32] all you know by the book and so he let
[44:35] me know two weeks ago and that's a good
[44:38] thing but that's not good enough. I I I
[44:41] need to be reminded.
[44:44] But it was actually good. It was
[44:45] actually good. I had so much on my mind
[44:47] with the studies and now this morning I
[44:51] I said I like being honest with the
[44:53] congregation, you know. So I said to
[44:56] have the baby dedication. I thought I
[44:58] said, "Who's taking it, Brother Derek?"
[45:00] He said, "I don't know. I told you about
[45:02] it two weeks ago."
[45:06] So that really allowed me to focus
[45:09] and I just went to the Lord and I I I
[45:11] got to that particular line and they
[45:15] brought the children
[45:17] that he would touch them
[45:20] and then just begin to Holy Spirit just
[45:23] begin to deal with me.
[45:26] We're here not to only dedicate the
[45:29] child, but to dedicate the to dedicate
[45:32] in the scripture
[45:34] also means to consecrate.
[45:37] And to consecrate in the scripture means
[45:40] to to complete, to bring to a
[45:43] completion, to bring to perfection.
[45:47] And this little one here is going
[45:51] through many tests every day, blood
[45:55] tests every day, medication every few
[45:59] hours.
[46:01] And I said, "Oh, God.
[46:04] We're going to dedicate. We're bringing
[46:06] Sister Debbie and Brother Derek are
[46:08] bringing this child and it needs a lot
[46:11] more than my touch."
[46:14] And I'm praying that the great high
[46:16] priest
[46:17] will come now and touch him as we
[46:20] dedicate him and consecrate him because
[46:24] consecrate is to not only to separate it
[46:27] but to bring him to completion and I
[46:29] pray that he will be brought to a
[46:31] physical completion but my prayer is
[46:34] going to go far beyond that. I'm going
[46:36] to pray that God will bring him also as
[46:39] he matures and grows to a spiritual
[46:41] completion.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And may he
[46:46] hear things
[46:48] that other children don't hear.
[46:51] May he hear a voice that maybe others
[46:53] don't hear.
[46:56] May he see things that others don't see.
[46:59] When Jesus said, "The world won't see
[47:02] me, but you'll see me." May he see him
[47:04] according to the words of Jesus.
[47:08] May he hear him.
[47:11] May he now feel his touch. And that is
[47:14] what I'm going to be praying in this
[47:17] dedication.
[47:19] And may you join your heart with me as
[47:22] we dedicate David Alexander
[47:25] to the Lord Jesus Christ. And his he
[47:28] shall be. And I pray that the great
[47:31] shepherd will lead him
[47:35] and that he'll have a great appetite for
[47:38] spiritual things and the Lord will feed
[47:41] him.
[47:43] All of his spiritual and physical senses
[47:46] will be met and fully satisfied
[47:49] in the presence of Jehovah. He has
[47:52] provided. Amen.
[48:02] Praise God.
[48:04] Dear heavenly father, as we hold this
[48:06] gem,
[48:08] this jewel of life that you have given
[48:10] to our brother Derek and sister Debbie
[48:12] and to this extended family,
[48:15] I pray, Father, as I lay my hands upon
[48:18] him and hold him and embrace him in
[48:19] yourstead. I'm a poor substitute. But I
[48:22] pray, Father, that you will see me now
[48:24] and I I dedicate him to you and
[48:27] consecrate him to you that you might
[48:30] complete the work, the healing work in
[48:32] his body.
[48:34] Deliver him from this infirmity in the
[48:36] name of Jesus Christ. Let him be raised
[48:40] to be a healthy, normal, strong boy. May
[48:45] the chemistry in this system now be
[48:48] corrected. Father, in the name of Jesus
[48:51] Christ, let it baffle, oh God, even the
[48:54] medical people.
[48:56] Lord, let him be a real testimony for
[48:59] you. And as he grows and matures, I pray
[49:02] that this touch will extend beyond his
[49:04] physical being to his spiritual being.
[49:06] May he see the things, Lord, as I have
[49:09] waited on you, and ask that he will see
[49:11] the things that others may not see
[49:13] around him, other children. Give him an
[49:15] appetite, oh God, for spiritual things.
[49:18] Let him hear the voice of the master
[49:21] calling him, calling his name. David
[49:24] Alexander,
[49:25] you're mine.
[49:28] I have I have lent him I have lent him
[49:32] to this family for a short time, but he
[49:36] he is mine. Lord, I dedicate David
[49:39] Alexander to you in the name of the Lord
[49:41] Jesus Christ. And I pray that his
[49:44] parents, brother Derek and sister
[49:45] Debbie, will be given divine wisdom to
[49:49] raise him, to provide for him. And to
[49:53] give him, oh God, all that is needed to
[49:55] nurture him up in the admonition and
[49:58] fear of the Lord in the name of the Lord
[50:00] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[50:04] Hallelujah.
[50:06] Bless you, brother Derek.
[50:10] Bless you, man. Bless you.
[50:17] Three girls
[50:19] and the family's got to be okay.
[50:24] Amen.
[50:29] I'll have you stand with me
[50:32] and
[50:38] I want to tell the congregation because
[50:40] we prayed in the last service
[50:43] for another little child 6 months old,
[50:46] the cowen baby that had a tumor,
[50:49] cancerous tumor the size of a grapefruit
[50:52] in its body and it was laying in the
[50:56] Seattle Children's Hospital
[50:59] and uh I just spoke to the congregation
[51:03] because we had met the greatgrandfather
[51:06] uh Mr. Cen who is the uh he's the
[51:11] founder of Cen Sand and Gravel and
[51:14] Concrete. They've been very generous to
[51:18] us for the camp. Mr. Cen, the senior
[51:24] came to the camp. I believe it was
[51:26] Friday
[51:27] and was speaking to brother Jack Aguary
[51:31] and brother Chris
[51:33] and uh they suggested that he they they
[51:36] phoned and suggested that we speak
[51:38] together. I was speaking with Mr.
[51:41] Leonard Cen. He's the greatgrandfather.
[51:44] Told me that the doctors had operated
[51:47] and found no cancer in the body.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[51:54] [Music]
[51:57] Praise God.
[52:00] I believe they did remove the tumor, but
[52:03] they said something to the effect that
[52:05] the cancer had stopped
[52:08] &gt;&gt; and did not go any further in the body.
[52:11] Isn't that wonderful? Isn't our Lord
[52:13] wonderful?
[52:16] Amen.
[52:18] And that's why I was touched when we
[52:21] began to pray for brother Derek and
[52:24] Sister Debbiey's baby. Excuse me.
[52:28] I'd like to just sing a a chorus of a
[52:30] song and I hope we have it on the
[52:34] screen. For he knew me yet he loved me.
[52:38] He whose glory makes the heaven shine.
[52:41] Can you help me with that please?
[52:47] For he knew me.
[52:54] He love
[52:56] me.
[53:00] He's
[53:02] glory.
[53:04] The heaven
[53:06] shine.
[53:10] I was so
[53:12] worthy.
[53:16] mercy.
[53:18] [Music]
[53:22] And when he was on cross,
[53:28] I was on his
[53:35] fore.
[53:39] [Music]
[53:43] Heat. Heat.
[53:46] [Music]
[53:56] I'm sorry.
[54:04] [Music]
[54:09] He was on the cross.
[54:14] I was on his mind.
[54:21] Yet while he was on his cross,
[54:28] I was on his
[54:33] once again.
[54:45] is
[54:49] &gt;&gt; just before we go to the word, I'm going
[54:50] to ask brother Tom Ray if he'll come and
[54:53] ask God's blessing upon the
[54:56] preaching and upon the word this
[54:58] morning.
[55:00] [Music]
[55:03] Hallelujah.
[55:05] [Music]
[55:10] This is the grace of God, Lord.
[55:13] [Music]
[55:16] Just such
[55:20] such mercy.
[55:23] Lord, how we've been dwelling on this
[55:25] thought that
[55:28] in my own life, Lord, how I found myself
[55:31] in your mind.
[55:33] It's marvelous,
[55:37] Lord. Hanging between
[55:40] [Music]
[55:42] heaven and earth,
[55:46] hanging as my redeemer,
[55:50] my savior,
[55:52] my substitute,
[55:55] my lamb.
[55:58] I was on your mind, Lord. This is a
[56:00] great thought.
[56:02] And so Lord, you've got us in your mind
[56:04] this morning. Bleeding lamb, come forth.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Anoint your servant. Lord, anoint.
[56:12] Let that word
[56:15] have its way within our souls this
[56:17] morning.
[56:18] [Music]
[56:19] Anoint your servant. Anoint our ears to
[56:22] hear and move upon us, Lord,
[56:26] that we can say, "You're my redeemer.
[56:30] You're my savior. You're my all and all.
[56:34] So Lord, we commit this service asking
[56:36] thy will be done.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Meet our every need.
[56:41] In Jesus name we pray.
[56:44] Amen.
[56:45] [Music]
[56:48] I'll invite you to open your Bible to
[56:51] the book of Romans,
[56:54] 8th chapter.
[56:57] We're going to begin reading at verse
[56:58] 26.
[57:03] Very, very common scripture. I'm sure
[57:06] some of this you quote frequently by
[57:09] heart.
[57:12] Starting at the 26th verse. Likewise,
[57:14] the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities.
[57:17] For we know not what we should pray for,
[57:22] as we ought, but the Spirit itself
[57:24] maketh intercession for us with
[57:26] groanings which cannot be uttered.
[57:30] And he that searchth the hearts knoweth
[57:32] what is the mind of the Spirit, because
[57:35] he maketh intercession for the saints
[57:37] according to the will of God.
[57:40] And we know that all things work
[57:42] together for good to them that love God
[57:45] and to them who are the called according
[57:48] to his purpose.
[57:50] For whom he did forno, he also did
[57:53] predestinate
[57:55] to be conformed to the image of his son
[57:58] that he might be the firstborn among
[58:01] many brethren.
[58:03] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[58:06] he also called.
[58:08] And whom he called, them he also
[58:10] justified.
[58:12] And whom he justified, them he also
[58:15] glorified.
[58:17] What shall we say then to these things?
[58:20] If God be before us, who can be against
[58:23] us?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; The God spoke through the prophet Isaiah
[58:29] and he said these words.
[58:32] You don't need to turn to it. Just a few
[58:34] line, a few words rather in Isaiah
[58:37] 43:21. This people have I formed for
[58:40] myself.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; They shall show forth my praise.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that marvelous?
[58:48] &gt;&gt; This people have I formed for myself.
[58:52] I've been preaching for six weeks now,
[58:54] the seventh time on the heavenly
[58:58] bridegroom
[58:59] has created or created his own bride. He
[59:03] made her, formed her,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; created her. There's all kinds of words
[59:10] that we could use in a descriptive way
[59:13] to say that God has created a people.
[59:15] And I took so much time on describing
[59:20] perhaps millions of years that was in
[59:23] God's mind, unfolding it down. And here
[59:26] we are. Here we are. We're here to be uh
[59:31] we're been formed by God. Where we find
[59:33] ourselves right now is God's doing.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; You agree with that?
[59:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat.
[59:45] the the environment of our homes or the
[59:49] environment of
[59:51] where you live
[59:54] uh your upbringing
[59:58] perhaps the country you came from
[1:00:03] or the part of the country you came from
[1:00:05] there's a quite a vast difference
[1:00:07] between say the southern United States
[1:00:10] and the northern United States the uh
[1:00:12] certain areas of of uh Canada or any
[1:00:16] country come within the city there's a
[1:00:19] big difference of environment and
[1:00:21] culture from a city to the country life
[1:00:25] and however a person was raised
[1:00:29] and uh uh uh whatever type of
[1:00:32] environment you were raised in has a
[1:00:35] good deal to do with how our lives are
[1:00:37] shaped,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; how we look at things and how we see
[1:00:41] things. There are some here who have
[1:00:44] gone through war
[1:00:46] and terrible conflict
[1:00:50] and struggle. It has no doubt uh shaped
[1:00:55] their lives. There are those here who
[1:00:58] have lived in dire need in poverty
[1:01:03] and that will have shaped their lives.
[1:01:06] People who have gone through difficult
[1:01:07] times and in poverty and perhaps their
[1:01:10] parents have had to be extremely frugal
[1:01:13] even though they may not have missed
[1:01:15] many meals in their life or uh really
[1:01:19] gone hungry but they have they have had
[1:01:22] to get along with meager fair even when
[1:01:24] those people have been uh perhaps uh uh
[1:01:29] financially become wellto-do they they
[1:01:32] will remain I won't say always but quite
[1:01:35] often remain in that frugal state
[1:01:38] because that had shaped their lives. And
[1:01:41] they learned what the value of a of a of
[1:01:44] a a penny or a dime or a nickel or a
[1:01:48] dollar or a pound or whatever more or a
[1:01:50] mark wherever you came from. They
[1:01:52] learned what the value that was and they
[1:01:55] remained in that because they were they
[1:01:58] were shaped uh that way. And it didn't
[1:02:00] happen overnight.
[1:02:03] Uh for those of you that are parents,
[1:02:05] and not only parents, but especially
[1:02:07] parents, one thing that needs to be
[1:02:11] really upfront in our minds is that our
[1:02:14] lives,
[1:02:16] whether we realize it or not, or whether
[1:02:18] we're trying to affect an influence on
[1:02:20] our children, but our lives are shaping
[1:02:24] those lives.
[1:02:26] they are getting something uh almost on
[1:02:30] the basis of osmosis. They just receive
[1:02:34] something from the way the our lives are
[1:02:37] conducted, how we look at things, they
[1:02:39] will they'll be shaped into looking
[1:02:41] things that way and looking at life the
[1:02:45] way we look at it. Uh a family member
[1:02:50] uh just a family member can have a a big
[1:02:52] effect on others. Thus, spiritual
[1:02:55] leaders also
[1:02:57] are uh contribute a great deal and have
[1:02:59] a powerful influence
[1:03:02] uh in the way people live in the way
[1:03:04] people worship.
[1:03:06] And uh speaking about that, just taking
[1:03:09] a little twist,
[1:03:11] uh there was uh some comments made about
[1:03:15] uh two great leaders who just met
[1:03:18] recently, president of the United States
[1:03:21] and uh the the Pope Benedict. Uh those
[1:03:26] are two powerful men. A person made some
[1:03:29] comments and I thought I would just uh
[1:03:32] draw a little bit from it. I said
[1:03:33] yesterday, this was the day after
[1:03:36] uh two great pious leaders of the world
[1:03:40] met in Washington.
[1:03:42] Excuse me. President Bush an immense
[1:03:46] has immense temporal power leading one
[1:03:49] of the richest countries on the planet
[1:03:52] with the most potent military force and
[1:03:56] Pope Benedict is a spiritual leader to a
[1:04:00] billion people with immense influence
[1:04:03] and the responsibility of a long
[1:04:05] religious legacy.
[1:04:08] What could they have talked about?
[1:04:11] It was the question. What could they
[1:04:13] have talked about?
[1:04:17] This gentleman was not too in he this
[1:04:19] gentleman was not too influenced by it.
[1:04:22] He said they seem to have patted each
[1:04:25] other on the back and congratulated each
[1:04:28] other on their commitment to
[1:04:32] superstition.
[1:04:35] In remarks greeting the pope at the
[1:04:39] White House,
[1:04:40] President Bush called the United States
[1:04:42] a nation of prayer.
[1:04:45] Uh Bush was interrupted by applause as
[1:04:48] he said, "In a world where some treat
[1:04:51] life as something to be debased and
[1:04:53] discarded, we need your message
[1:04:57] that all human life is sacred and that
[1:04:59] each of us is willed. that each of us is
[1:05:02] willed.
[1:05:05] Benedict responded by praising the role
[1:05:07] of religion in the United States.
[1:05:10] And from the dawn of the republic, he
[1:05:13] said, this is a quote, from the dawn of
[1:05:15] the republic, America's quest for
[1:05:18] freedom has been guided by the
[1:05:21] conviction that the principles governing
[1:05:23] political and social life are intimately
[1:05:26] linked to a moral order based on the
[1:05:29] dominion of God, the creator. He said,
[1:05:33] "I thought it was ironic that he should
[1:05:36] speak about the freedom when the
[1:05:38] forefathers of America that established
[1:05:41] it fled from his system to get freedom."
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That to me seemed like a paradox.
[1:05:52] This nation of America received a
[1:05:55] prophet. I tell you, a holy prophet,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; a prophet of God. Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And these are his words. And so so is
[1:06:05] this great nation of ours.
[1:06:08] We came here and on Plymouth Rock. This
[1:06:12] nation was founded on freedom of
[1:06:14] religion because our forefathers had
[1:06:17] fled Roman persecution
[1:06:20] of the modern Jezebel system.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Roman persecution. He said of the modern
[1:06:27] Jezebel system. He bridges the
[1:06:30] establishing of America
[1:06:34] at Plymouth Rock and bringing it forward
[1:06:36] in just one sentence of the modern
[1:06:39] Jezebel system that had come up and
[1:06:42] stood many great persecutions and
[1:06:44] martyrdom under the false system of
[1:06:46] Jezebel and according to the Bible of
[1:06:50] Revelation the 13th chapter which he
[1:06:52] says America is identified in 13th
[1:06:55] chapter God had promised them an oasis
[1:06:59] in a place for the woman was carried
[1:07:01] into the wilderness where she was fed
[1:07:04] for a time time and a dividing of time.
[1:07:07] God had made the promise to America or
[1:07:10] to the church to the woman to come into
[1:07:14] this country.
[1:07:16] It goes on in Revelation 13, all of the
[1:07:18] other beasts that came up out of the
[1:07:21] sea, out of the waters, all other beasts
[1:07:23] that are spoken of in Revelation coming
[1:07:26] up out of the sea. But he and and he
[1:07:29] said, "The waters which thou sawest is
[1:07:32] thickness of multitudes of people." So
[1:07:35] when they speak of the waters, it is
[1:07:37] speaking of multitudes, thickness of
[1:07:39] multitudes of people. All the other
[1:07:42] beasts, they came up out of the water
[1:07:46] thickness of multitudes of people. But
[1:07:49] when the United States came up, it came
[1:07:52] up out of the earth where there was no
[1:07:55] people. Remember, when it came up, it
[1:07:58] looked like a lamb.
[1:08:01] A lamb has two horns. And that's civil
[1:08:05] and ecclesiastical powers. And as for my
[1:08:09] thinking, those two were the ones that
[1:08:12] were identified in the last few days.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Immense civil power
[1:08:20] with immense immense influence
[1:08:23] throughout the entire globe
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; of this planet and immense
[1:08:28] ecclesiastical power. The prophet said
[1:08:31] those were the two horns. You won't find
[1:08:34] anyone else saying that. A prophet could
[1:08:37] uncover that ahead of time and forewarn
[1:08:41] us of what was happening.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; The civil and ecclesiastical power.
[1:08:48] Don't forget their horns. And a horn
[1:08:50] represents power.
[1:08:53] He says, "But when they've united,
[1:08:56] remember then that lamb spake like the
[1:09:01] dragon before him, and the dragon was
[1:09:04] Rome."
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; So when they join together,
[1:09:10] it's not that Rome is going to say what
[1:09:13] the lamb says. It's the lamb is going to
[1:09:16] speak like the dragon
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; going to acquire the same language.
[1:09:23] He says and then we find that this
[1:09:25] country
[1:09:26] come up as a free country and was a lamb
[1:09:30] which means the lamb of God. But after a
[1:09:33] while this same system that we have
[1:09:37] spoke like the dragon and exercised all
[1:09:40] the power uh that the the dragon had
[1:09:43] before him. They parallel one to the
[1:09:46] other perfectly. And remember when
[1:09:48] Israel came up and uh and took her
[1:09:52] homeland in Palestine, drove back all
[1:09:55] the occupants of that land and possessed
[1:09:57] the land. We came in and took it from
[1:09:59] the Indians, drove them back and
[1:10:02] possessed the land. God had a reason for
[1:10:04] that. God was going to show the world
[1:10:08] what he could do with a little band of
[1:10:10] people that wanted freedom and freedom
[1:10:13] of religion to serve God. I thought that
[1:10:16] we have lived in some very remarkable
[1:10:18] time. I'm just starting the message
[1:10:21] today by saying that we've been shaped
[1:10:24] by something
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; and this power enormous powers which
[1:10:29] have been unleashed
[1:10:31] uh upon the earth
[1:10:33] are shaping nations shaping the way
[1:10:36] people think. America is shaping the
[1:10:40] economy largely of the world and other
[1:10:43] nations are rising. China is rising and
[1:10:47] shaping the economy and nations are
[1:10:50] having to respond. In order to do so,
[1:10:53] they have to have the G7 or the G8 or
[1:10:57] they have to have the United Nations or
[1:10:59] they have to have in in the
[1:11:01] ecclesiastical realm, they have to have
[1:11:04] the world council uh the council of
[1:11:07] churches or or the ecumenical council.
[1:11:11] They're having to come together into
[1:11:12] these great uh uh
[1:11:17] unions of of religion or unions of
[1:11:20] nations or unions of economics in order
[1:11:24] to try to control and balance things.
[1:11:27] You know that that's what's happening.
[1:11:29] We know that's what's happening. But we
[1:11:31] know also from the from the scripture
[1:11:34] and now as it's been made known in a
[1:11:36] prophet messenger's message, we have
[1:11:39] such a clear understanding of what's
[1:11:41] taking place. So don't get carried away
[1:11:44] by these things. And on the other hand,
[1:11:46] we're not just sitting here, you know,
[1:11:49] being in opposition to everything. We're
[1:11:51] not so much uh contrary to things as we
[1:11:54] are as and you don't have to be contrary
[1:11:57] to to something to be pro something
[1:12:00] else. I'm pro the word of God. Uh we're
[1:12:03] pro the message and what God has said
[1:12:06] that's what we believe
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; and we see it unfolding around us. Amen.
[1:12:12] So the world itself
[1:12:15] is is uh they are set on a course of of
[1:12:19] influence and influencing people and oh
[1:12:22] I we could stand here and speak about it
[1:12:25] the whole afternoon but you know we see
[1:12:28] our our youth
[1:12:30] you know they're very powerfully
[1:12:32] influenced by what is seen in the media
[1:12:35] on the televisions or or the newspapers
[1:12:38] or magazines or whatever more and and
[1:12:41] the prophet even mentions it. You know,
[1:12:42] a woman will come on, she'll have a
[1:12:44] certain hairdo, and suddenly everybody,
[1:12:45] what is it? It's a power of influence. A
[1:12:48] certain dress, a certain hat, a certain
[1:12:50] this, a certain that, and it's just a
[1:12:52] power of influence. I was speaking to my
[1:12:54] wife about it yesterday because the
[1:12:56] message on my mind, you see, you know,
[1:12:58] the young fellas that come out with a
[1:13:00] hat, a cap that's worn one day and and
[1:13:02] uh and then a a few months or two, three
[1:13:05] years down the road, that's that's old
[1:13:07] stuff. We do it a different way now. and
[1:13:09] and uh you know you to look nice one
[1:13:12] time, next time if you got to look as
[1:13:14] frumpy and as as you know
[1:13:18] they actually have clowns clothes.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Those long baggy shorts that the young
[1:13:24] guys wear with a crotch somewhere down
[1:13:27] around the knees. That's clowns. That's
[1:13:29] clowns cloth.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; That whole style come from clowns. As
[1:13:33] far as I'm concerned, they look like
[1:13:35] clowns and soon they act like clowns.
[1:13:38] Right.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not being, you know, I'm not being
[1:13:42] facitious or nasty. I'm just saying
[1:13:44] that's that happens to be the truth. If
[1:13:47] I had my son like look like that, I'd
[1:13:50] take him to the woodshed.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Teach him some things.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be swayed and
[1:13:58] influenced
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; even in our services. We don't have to
[1:14:03] be influenced. The world has nothing to
[1:14:05] offer us.
[1:14:09] in our speaking, in our delivery, in the
[1:14:11] in the message or or how we conduct our
[1:14:15] service or how we sing songs or how we
[1:14:17] play our instruments. The world has
[1:14:20] nothing to offer us.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; We need to be inspired by the Holy
[1:14:24] Spirit and sing from the heart. And I
[1:14:27] appreciate when people do that and and
[1:14:29] play from our soul, play uh uh the music
[1:14:33] to God and and do things. And when we
[1:14:36] testify or whatever we do, is there
[1:14:38] anything wrong with what I'm saying?
[1:14:48] Jesus said, "I'm I'm against
[1:14:50] denomination, religion, because it's the
[1:14:52] mark of the beast." He said, "Rome." You
[1:14:55] understand? Now, always said the system,
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; not the people.
[1:15:09] moment. Just a few presidents ago in the
[1:15:12] United States, we had President Reagan
[1:15:14] and Pope John Paul II. Now, those two
[1:15:20] powerful influences in the world, they
[1:15:23] were dead set on a course to destroy the
[1:15:27] system of communism
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; and were successful as far as the former
[1:15:32] Soviet Union. I'm not speaking of
[1:15:34] political message. I'm talking about
[1:15:36] influence. I'm talking about the
[1:15:38] bridegroom creating his own bride. He
[1:15:40] made her by influencing her. That's
[1:15:43] where I'm coming to now. Just watch it.
[1:15:46] And th those men were set on a course to
[1:15:49] destroy communism.
[1:15:51] Now you see the reason I'm saying this
[1:15:53] is because so many people and you could
[1:15:56] even be here or could be listening or
[1:15:58] someone who I don't know who all will
[1:16:00] hear this service but they say, "Oh,
[1:16:02] those in the message you're so
[1:16:04] judgmental." Excuse me.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Is it not our right to be against
[1:16:11] something that we believe is evil
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; that brings an evil influence, brings
[1:16:17] people into bondage?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Can't we be opposed to something
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; because I'm opposed to perhaps a
[1:16:27] lifestyle that the people live or choose
[1:16:30] to live? I'm against the lifestyle, not
[1:16:32] the person.
[1:16:37] the alcoholic. I'm against his style of
[1:16:40] living. I'm against the alcoholism.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm against same-sex marriage.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; I'm against homosexuality.
[1:16:50] Not the person, but the system he come
[1:16:52] under
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; or she come under.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; We can be opposed to something. America
[1:16:59] was opposed to communism. Did they hate
[1:17:02] all the Russians? No, I don't think so.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Did they hate the the people that were
[1:17:10] under the communist system? No. They
[1:17:12] were against the system and set on a
[1:17:16] course to destroy the system and use any
[1:17:19] manner of of method that was available
[1:17:22] to them to destroy the system because
[1:17:24] they said the people are bound. the
[1:17:27] people uh the people are they're
[1:17:29] enslaved to the system and we need to
[1:17:32] break that system. That is why a prophet
[1:17:35] come said I'm against why I'm against
[1:17:38] organized religion
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; and then people want to twist it and say
[1:17:44] he was against those people that he
[1:17:46] hated the the Pentecostals or the
[1:17:49] Lutherans or the Methodists. Absolutely
[1:17:51] wrong. Absolutely wrong conclusion. If
[1:17:54] you say that, then you say America hates
[1:17:57] all communists. Not at all. Not at all.
[1:18:01] Not at all.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You get my point. I want to make this
[1:18:04] very, very clear. You when you're
[1:18:07] opposed to a system, you're not opposed
[1:18:10] to the people.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You cannot hate any person. Right.
[1:18:17] Right.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; The the scripture teaches us to love the
[1:18:21] people,
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; but we do not love the sin.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; We do not love the system.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; We do not love what they're bound by.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; We have so many of the people here that
[1:18:34] came from the colonies
[1:18:36] and the finer people you can't find.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; They're wonderful, wonderful people that
[1:18:42] have come from the colonies. and and I
[1:18:45] like to commend them. They're like a
[1:18:47] trouble-free people. They've been so a
[1:18:50] wonderful wonderful uh addition to this
[1:18:53] congregation. And I thank God that that
[1:18:56] that God led them here.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe 150 or so that are here. And if
[1:19:03] those of you that have married the young
[1:19:05] ladies and the young men from the
[1:19:07] colonies, you you have wonderful people,
[1:19:10] the salt of the earth.
[1:19:14] as our brother Ernie has uh made
[1:19:16] reference to them. They're not gold,
[1:19:18] they're platinum.
[1:19:20] So I I like to give them that bouquet
[1:19:22] this morning. But the system I could not
[1:19:25] say enough against it.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; It's a system of fear. It's a system of
[1:19:30] bondage. And I would do anything I can
[1:19:33] and and contribute anything that we can
[1:19:35] to break that system to loose the people
[1:19:38] out of that fear.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Terrible fear. They have no right to
[1:19:44] hold those people. And I'll say these
[1:19:46] denominations that try to influence
[1:19:48] people are much worse, even much worse
[1:19:51] than any political system because they
[1:19:53] promise a spiritual a spiritual uh
[1:19:57] benefit that they can't deliver on.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Look at the churches of this day and how
[1:20:03] far they have slipped. Look at what's
[1:20:05] taking place in churches today while I'm
[1:20:08] ministering and promising them heaven.
[1:20:10] And they cannot deliver on that promise.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to get to heaven.
[1:20:15] That's by believing the word of God. If
[1:20:18] you believe the word of God, your life
[1:20:19] will be transformed because the Holy
[1:20:22] Spirit will come and give you truly a
[1:20:24] new birth.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And the new birth will not slip back
[1:20:28] into the old world.
[1:20:32] These people that come and say they've
[1:20:34] had a new birth, but they live exactly
[1:20:36] as the world. Something doesn't jive.
[1:20:40] Something doesn't uh rec I can't
[1:20:42] reconcile that.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And you might be sitting here today and
[1:20:48] and even as visitors come in or whatever
[1:20:51] and and see the the mode of dress or the
[1:20:54] mode of life of the of the people. We
[1:20:59] have no strings, no no bonds to bind the
[1:21:03] people. It has to be something from the
[1:21:06] heart, something that God has done
[1:21:08] within you.
[1:21:10] And we're not interested in reforming
[1:21:12] people and simply having them dress a
[1:21:14] certain way or speak a certain way or
[1:21:17] use a certain language. It's got to be
[1:21:19] from the inside out,
[1:21:23] from a transformed individual, born
[1:21:26] again by the spirit and the word of God.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And then you'll be a different person.
[1:21:40] Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; The scripture said
[1:21:47] which we read.
[1:21:49] The scripture says this and I just want
[1:21:52] to get I could say so much along the
[1:21:54] lines I was just on but I want to move
[1:21:56] forward.
[1:21:58] Whom he did forno. Now, the scriptures
[1:22:02] which we read this morning,
[1:22:04] you might as well understand
[1:22:07] they're very, very troublesome to the
[1:22:10] Christian community.
[1:22:12] Very troublesome.
[1:22:14] But let's just look at this scripture
[1:22:16] because it's important in in in context
[1:22:19] of the subject and I hope that this is
[1:22:22] the last time I have to deal on this
[1:22:25] subject. I'd like to maybe go on to
[1:22:26] something else. For whom he did forno,
[1:22:30] forno
[1:22:32] in our scripture reading and in your
[1:22:34] Bible happens to be the key word.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Whom he did forno,
[1:22:40] he also did predestinate. He also did
[1:22:44] predestinate. He predetermined. I'm
[1:22:47] going to go into the meaning of these
[1:22:48] words. So he forneew them. And notice
[1:22:51] the word that's important before the
[1:22:53] word forneo. Whom.
[1:22:58] Whom he forneew
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; just didn't say all peoples of the earth
[1:23:04] but whom he forneew
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; them he also did predestinate.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; This is very clearly defined.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And what did he predestinate them to? To
[1:23:20] be conformed
[1:23:22] to the image. I'm going to make them to
[1:23:25] a certain image. I'm going to shape them
[1:23:28] to a certain image. I'm going to deal
[1:23:31] with them till they come into this
[1:23:32] image. And it may cause some trials. It
[1:23:35] may cost it that they may come under a
[1:23:38] certain sound of the preaching. They may
[1:23:41] have to be in a certain place. They have
[1:23:43] to hear certain sermons. I have to deal
[1:23:46] with them in a certain way. And God has
[1:23:49] such a a a massive amount of directions
[1:23:53] that he can come to a person. He can
[1:23:55] deal with a person individually. Right
[1:23:57] now, you know, you've been praying for
[1:23:59] individuals that they would come to
[1:24:01] Christ. God can meet a person in the
[1:24:04] darkest spot. They can be in a bar. They
[1:24:07] can be watching television right now.
[1:24:10] They can be at some sports event. They
[1:24:12] can be in some uh drunken or drug
[1:24:15] stuper. And this Holy Spirit I know can
[1:24:19] go down to their room and meet them at
[1:24:21] this very instant.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's where our faith is anchored.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And reveal the need to them.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Whom he also did forno, he did also
[1:24:36] predestinate to be conformed to be
[1:24:39] conformed. God's not done working on us.
[1:24:43] God's not done shaping us. He is the
[1:24:47] master sculptor. And he knows what he's
[1:24:50] going to make out of this stone. This
[1:24:53] stone, this rock that's you and that's
[1:24:55] this stone that's me. He's he's shaping
[1:24:58] us and making us. And but he does not go
[1:25:01] in here what he's using as his tools.
[1:25:04] But the greatest tool he has and I
[1:25:07] suggest to you at this moment is his
[1:25:09] word. He shapes people by his word. If
[1:25:13] you go to our last service, I just made
[1:25:15] the analogy of the young man. He may be
[1:25:18] in his teens and he's a very awkward
[1:25:20] young man, but he has a desire within
[1:25:23] him. He wants to be a brain surgeon. He
[1:25:26] wants to be some kind of uh uh he wants
[1:25:29] to specialize in surgery as a as a brain
[1:25:32] surgeon. And what what takes him from
[1:25:35] that awkward teenager to be an
[1:25:37] accomplished professional surgeon? What
[1:25:40] takes him in that span of time is books
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; and things that he hears and men that
[1:25:47] speak to him, instructors and advisors
[1:25:50] and someone who will be a mentor for him
[1:25:54] and counsel him. And over a period of
[1:25:57] time and years and through intense
[1:26:00] dedication that young a very cumbersome
[1:26:03] young man will become a someone who is
[1:26:06] regarded in the community as the finest
[1:26:10] brain surgeon in the whole area.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; It was a book
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; and we were a people without form.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; We were a people who didn't have a
[1:26:21] direction.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; We were a people that were in confusion.
[1:26:25] We were a people who did not under even
[1:26:27] understand the book. But we had a guide
[1:26:31] called the Holy Spirit of God. And that
[1:26:34] Holy Spirit sent the word directed to us
[1:26:38] in each generation in each season. He
[1:26:41] took this time locked word and and and
[1:26:45] sent it through his messenger at each
[1:26:48] season. And he sent a messenger in this
[1:26:51] season to be able to say to the
[1:26:53] children, here's the word. Amen.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Here are the scriptures for this time.
[1:26:58] And now when when the Holy Spirit
[1:27:01] unlocks it and reveals it to you, you
[1:27:03] don't have to understand it completely,
[1:27:05] but reveals it to you. Yes, that is the
[1:27:08] word for this time. I believe that. I
[1:27:11] see that. Then the Holy Spirit comes
[1:27:14] within you and and unlocks the dynamics
[1:27:18] of that word and it begins to change
[1:27:21] your life.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; And as it transforms your life, you take
[1:27:27] on the appearance, you take on the
[1:27:31] character of the very word you believe.
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; That's the principle. Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; So whom he did forno them he also did
[1:27:49] predestinate
[1:27:50] and them that he did forno.
[1:27:53] To forno
[1:27:56] is to fore ordain to know before
[1:28:00] or to have knowledge of beforehand. So
[1:28:03] now whom
[1:28:04] is identifies individuals or people whom
[1:28:10] he forneew.
[1:28:12] He had knowledge of them beforehand
[1:28:15] to predestinate or predetermine
[1:28:19] those whom God forneew so that they
[1:28:22] would love him.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I like that content. He forneew them
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; because he knew that they would love
[1:28:32] him.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; It also comes from uh from a compound
[1:28:39] word whom he forneew is to know, to
[1:28:42] understand, and to perceive and to have
[1:28:45] knowledge of.
[1:28:48] He forneew them.
[1:28:51] Now
[1:28:53] to to know to know something
[1:28:58] uh uh we're not talking about God now.
[1:29:00] We're just talking about you as a
[1:29:01] moment. But in the Bible to know
[1:29:03] something
[1:29:05] it had it is a Greek word but to the
[1:29:08] Greeks they understood it one way and
[1:29:10] the Jews understood it another. And
[1:29:13] here's the way the Greeks understood it.
[1:29:15] To know meant to know facts. Doesn't the
[1:29:18] Bible say the Greeks seek wisdom?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; And so to the Greeks to know something
[1:29:23] was to know facts that may or may not
[1:29:26] affect may or may not affect one's
[1:29:29] conduct. It just to know facts but it
[1:29:32] didn't have any any effect on the
[1:29:35] individual's conduct. To the Jew,
[1:29:38] completely different. To the Jew, true
[1:29:41] knowledge always
[1:29:44] manifested itself in one's conduct. If
[1:29:48] you really know something, you say,
[1:29:50] "Well, I know something about God," it
[1:29:53] will change your conduct. If you say, "I
[1:29:56] know Jesus Christ." And m millions will
[1:30:00] say, "Yes, I know Jesus Christ." But
[1:30:03] they don't know him as a Jew would
[1:30:05] understand it. If you know him, it
[1:30:08] changes your conduct.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of us being able to
[1:30:14] change ourselves through a series of
[1:30:17] good works. It's not that. It's a matter
[1:30:19] of the going back to the principle. If
[1:30:22] we know, if we know
[1:30:26] that this message,
[1:30:28] if we know by the kind of knowledge that
[1:30:31] God's talking about, I know that this is
[1:30:34] God's vindicated word, I know that it's
[1:30:38] the truth. That knowledge will change
[1:30:41] your conduct because the Holy Spirit
[1:30:44] will come and and give the dynamics to
[1:30:47] it within you.
[1:30:50] Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; To the Jew, one did not know something
[1:30:54] until the fact had a practical
[1:30:57] outworking in their life.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; He didn't know the fact until that had
[1:31:02] happened. And then he said he would
[1:31:04] predestinate. He also would
[1:31:06] predestinate. To predestinate, and these
[1:31:09] are just foundation for me. To
[1:31:11] predestinate is to determine before
[1:31:15] or to ordain.
[1:31:19] See, it's not him that runth,
[1:31:22] but it's him. It's God that shows mercy.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; It's not we that run or we that will to
[1:31:29] do a certain thing, but it's God that
[1:31:32] chooses and for ordains things to pred
[1:31:36] to predetermine
[1:31:38] to decide beforehand.
[1:31:40] And in the New Testament, to pre to
[1:31:42] predestinate is God decreeing from
[1:31:47] eternity.
[1:31:50] to for ordain to a point beforehand
[1:31:54] and that also
[1:31:57] is to mark out the boundaries that comes
[1:31:59] from another word
[1:32:02] to to predestinate is to define. It's
[1:32:05] not just to determine that a certain
[1:32:07] thing a certain individual will be a
[1:32:10] certain will have a certain experience.
[1:32:14] It isn't God just predestinating that
[1:32:16] you would hear the word.
[1:32:20] Not just that. Not just that you would
[1:32:22] come to salvation, to redemption, to the
[1:32:26] revelation, all of those things. It's
[1:32:28] not just that, but it comes to
[1:32:31] predestinate. It's important that we get
[1:32:33] this. to predestinate is that God in
[1:32:37] determining that by his fornowledge
[1:32:40] determined that you would be what you
[1:32:42] are. He also made a definition and
[1:32:46] defined what you would be within that.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; It is to mark out certain boundaries or
[1:32:55] limits.
[1:32:57] You see, so one person is birthed by a
[1:33:02] new birth by the Holy Spirit and by the
[1:33:04] word by God's decree.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; You know, this is difficult for a lot of
[1:33:10] people in this day where everybody has
[1:33:12] their rights.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Well, I can tell you one thing in this
[1:33:16] day and age, it's God that has his
[1:33:18] rights. And God's rights are absolutely
[1:33:23] uh
[1:33:24] it it's it's a it's a it's an absolute.
[1:33:28] That's the best way to describe it.
[1:33:29] That's God's rights. God has a right to
[1:33:32] choose who will be his bride, his wife.
[1:33:35] God has a right to choose who will be in
[1:33:37] his family. You may choose that we're
[1:33:40] going to have a child, but you don't
[1:33:42] choose whether it's a boy or a girl. You
[1:33:45] don't you don't have the choice in
[1:33:47] conception. God holds that to himself.
[1:33:50] And you know, with all of this business
[1:33:52] about rights, there's there's really the
[1:33:55] world doesn't get uh they don't get into
[1:33:57] that because they know it's out of their
[1:33:59] hands.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; God makes a choosing
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; of what the conception is.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And you as parents, you never have had a
[1:34:07] choice what color their eyes are going
[1:34:09] to be.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Whether they're left-handed or
[1:34:13] right-handed, you don't have a choice.
[1:34:15] There's so many things you don't have a
[1:34:17] choice at. And we don't have a choice
[1:34:20] when it comes to salvation.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; If God maybe have maybe have a question
[1:34:25] on that say, "What about my free will?"
[1:34:28] I can tell you one thing. Your free will
[1:34:31] will not supersedes God's will.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; That's for sure. and of God's wills that
[1:34:37] you shall come to redemption and that
[1:34:39] you were in him and in his mind and in
[1:34:42] his thoughts before the foundation of
[1:34:44] the world. There's no way for you to
[1:34:46] stay out of it.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And if you were never there, there's no
[1:34:49] way to get into it.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; And that has nothing to do with I'm in a
[1:34:54] downtime. I'm in a low moment. I'm I'm
[1:34:57] I'm I'm being, you know, just hounded
[1:35:00] and pounded by doubts and unbelief and
[1:35:03] so on. That has nothing to do with it.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with it.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; You just come to a place and quite
[1:35:13] frankly, I'd sooner serve God. Even if I
[1:35:16] was not going to be,
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; if I was never in his mind, I'd still
[1:35:20] want to serve God.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; How can I compare this life with
[1:35:25] something else of debauchery in the
[1:35:27] world?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; What emptiness there is out there. waste
[1:35:31] your life and have Satan just be so
[1:35:34] disrespectful upon people. What in the
[1:35:37] world? Why would a person want to give
[1:35:39] their life? Why would a person want
[1:35:40] Satan to rob a man of his respect of his
[1:35:44] health or a woman of his respect of his
[1:35:47] health, of his mental intelligence, and
[1:35:50] just destroy him physically with all of
[1:35:53] the all of the they call enjoyments of
[1:35:56] the world?
[1:35:59] Well, to me, friends,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; you know, there's big things today about
[1:36:03] where you can smoke and where you can't
[1:36:05] smoke and whose smoke you're going to
[1:36:07] breathe and who smoke you're not going
[1:36:08] to breathe and, you know, you got to be
[1:36:10] so many feet from the from the front
[1:36:13] door or whatever more. All kinds of
[1:36:15] things are going on. It's just idiocy.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; It's bizarre. Amen.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I think the thing that is
[1:36:28] just so incomprehensible
[1:36:30] is that a man or a woman who know that
[1:36:33] this is destroying them will go to the
[1:36:36] counter, a cash counter and pay about60
[1:36:38] or $70 for a carton of cigarettes
[1:36:42] and walk home and inhale that stuff into
[1:36:45] their systems and then wonder why
[1:36:47] they're poppers.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Right. and wonder why they've got health
[1:36:53] problems.
[1:36:55] They they paid for it.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Actually paid for it. Isn't that
[1:37:02] incredible?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I have been out of the loop for so all
[1:37:06] my life really. But I stood and you
[1:37:08] maybe heard me say this once, but I
[1:37:10] stood behind a man in a in a pharmacy
[1:37:15] and uh he didn't have anything. Uh and
[1:37:19] he said something to the lady. I was
[1:37:21] right behind him and uh and he pulled a
[1:37:24] $100 bill out of his pocket. I thought,
[1:37:26] "Wow, he's, you know, buying something."
[1:37:30] And she reaches up behind her and pulls
[1:37:33] down a carton of cigarettes.
[1:37:37] And I was just like a little kid, I
[1:37:39] guess. I thought,
[1:37:41] a $100 bill. I have a lot of respect for
[1:37:44] $100.
[1:37:46] And there laid a carton of cigarettes
[1:37:48] and a $100 bill beside it. And she
[1:37:51] scooped up that $100 bill, rang thing,
[1:37:53] and and gave him a little bit of change
[1:37:55] after he was done to 20 or $30 or
[1:37:58] whatever it was. And
[1:38:02] I was so delirious. I didn't hardly know
[1:38:04] what I was standing there for.
[1:38:07] I just couldn't believe I couldn't
[1:38:09] believe that a man with any intelligence
[1:38:11] was going to give up that kind of money
[1:38:14] so he could go home and be sick.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Do you ever imagine things that are kind
[1:38:21] of, you know, just childish?
[1:38:25] Now that I kind of got your attention on
[1:38:26] that, I'll just take a moment. I've
[1:38:29] imagined sometimes they always talk
[1:38:30] about these extraterrestrial, you know,
[1:38:33] beings coming to the Earth,
[1:38:37] these, you know, people from Mars or
[1:38:39] something. I'd like to see if one of
[1:38:41] those came to the Earth and they're
[1:38:42] trying to figure out, you know, how
[1:38:43] you're living
[1:38:46] and they come and they can see you
[1:38:47] eating. Yeah. All right, that makes some
[1:38:49] sense. See, then they see this fellow
[1:38:51] and he's got a cigarette
[1:38:54] fire.
[1:38:56] gets all red,
[1:38:59] inhales a bunch of smoke, blows it out.
[1:39:02] So their leader is trying to figure out
[1:39:04] what this what he's doing.
[1:39:08] So he goes and asks him, "What are you
[1:39:09] doing?" Well, is is uh well, I'm you
[1:39:15] know, he tries to explain what he's
[1:39:16] doing. Does it make you feel good? No.
[1:39:20] Quite frankly, takes my breath away and
[1:39:22] makes me cough.
[1:39:24] Uh oh. Are you getting paid to do it?
[1:39:28] No, I pay to do it.
[1:39:33] And by the time this thing this
[1:39:35] conversation has gone over, I can say
[1:39:38] this guy probably says, "Let's go back
[1:39:39] to Mars."
[1:39:43] One thing's for sure, these people here,
[1:39:45] they need they need a whole lot more
[1:39:47] help than we can give them.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:39:54] Now I've come to the point
[1:39:57] God predestinated. He said he forneew
[1:40:00] people and predestinated
[1:40:03] here it is to be conformed
[1:40:06] to come under a a process of being
[1:40:10] conformed
[1:40:12] to the image
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; of his son.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; He's going to conform them. And to
[1:40:19] conform them is to fashion them. Your
[1:40:22] hardships are used by God to fashion
[1:40:26] you.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; The people that you really like and the
[1:40:31] people, some that you don't really like
[1:40:35] are there to fashion you.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not the smooth thing that
[1:40:40] really uh
[1:40:43] has a has a shaping or designing, but
[1:40:46] it's the rough. It's the knife or the
[1:40:48] horn or the chisel or the hammer or all
[1:40:53] of these things that don't really
[1:40:55] indicate something that is delightful.
[1:40:57] But it is those things. It's the
[1:40:59] sandpaper. It's the grit. It's the
[1:41:02] agitation. It's the irritation. And you
[1:41:05] put a stone into a into a ball mill and
[1:41:09] let the let it has to have it. It won't
[1:41:11] just work by itself. It has to have some
[1:41:13] grit. It has to have some powder in
[1:41:16] there. and finally it comes out of
[1:41:17] beautiful shiny stone. God has a way of
[1:41:20] sculpting us
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; and he uses all kinds of things. You
[1:41:25] might say that preacher I don't really
[1:41:27] enjoy. Well, you better just sit and
[1:41:29] listen to him. Maybe this morning you're
[1:41:32] not really getting a whole lot. But you
[1:41:33] need to just sit and listen. I believe
[1:41:35] that God brought you here. I believe
[1:41:38] that God sent me here.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. And these
[1:41:42] things uh that we are hearing and that
[1:41:44] you're hearing aren't just for this
[1:41:46] moment, but it is so that God will take
[1:41:49] you as an individual. If you believe
[1:41:51] you're one of those that are fornown,
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; you believe you're one of those
[1:41:56] predestinated,
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; then God has ordained that you shall be
[1:41:59] conformed to the image of his son.
[1:42:04] And incidentally,
[1:42:08] incidentally, I'd like to I I want to
[1:42:10] make a very very emphatic statement at
[1:42:14] this moment.
[1:42:17] Whenever we speak of us being conformed
[1:42:19] to the image of the son
[1:42:22] uh or conformed into the image of God
[1:42:26] and whenever we speak of the rapture and
[1:42:29] these kind of things I have found that
[1:42:34] our our thinking and I have found that
[1:42:36] our words are very very uh selfc
[1:42:39] centered.
[1:42:41] We think about being into the image of
[1:42:43] his son so that we so that we, you know,
[1:42:47] we'll have that ful fulfillment so that
[1:42:49] we we think of the rapture so that we
[1:42:52] will escape this terrible place. But
[1:42:54] that's not God's thought. God's thought
[1:42:57] is that they will be conformed to the
[1:42:59] image of his son so that his son can be
[1:43:03] the firstborn among many brethren. All
[1:43:06] the emphasis is on him. Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; All the emphasis, the reason why there
[1:43:13] is a rapture and the reason why there is
[1:43:15] to be a resurrection is because this
[1:43:18] shall be the final assault of our Lord
[1:43:21] Jesus Christ upon his enemy death.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; And it is to bring him the ultimate
[1:43:28] victory that I have brought a people and
[1:43:30] bypass death, overpowered death. He has
[1:43:34] done it. It's not for us to be, you
[1:43:36] know, to finally get some escape.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; That's not the emphasis so that I'll get
[1:43:42] out of this world and I'll be beyond
[1:43:44] temptation. It's that he might be
[1:43:46] glorified that his that his uh purchase
[1:43:49] at Calvary, the full purchased price
[1:43:52] will now be brought down effective upon
[1:43:56] Satan's head.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. It's like he has clubbed him
[1:44:04] on the head to crush his head. He did so
[1:44:06] at Calvary, but it's like the final blow
[1:44:09] because it says the last enemy to be
[1:44:11] destroyed is death.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; That is what we are awaiting.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And we're awaiting that so our God, our
[1:44:20] Lord will have the full consequence of
[1:44:23] his victory.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I just don't have enough words to say
[1:44:27] it, but it's all in him, friends. Yeah.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. We will have an escape. It's like a
[1:44:33] side benefit.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We will get out of we will have
[1:44:36] the change of the body, but he's doing
[1:44:38] it for his glory to demonstrate his
[1:44:42] complete power.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; So, he's going to conform us to the
[1:44:50] image of his son. And the image is the
[1:44:53] figure or the likeness, the image of the
[1:44:56] son of God which true Christians are
[1:45:01] transformed into.
[1:45:03] Brother Brandham says and who's this
[1:45:05] Melzdc?
[1:45:06] What happens to the plant?
[1:45:09] It rots.
[1:45:12] What's the first thing he goes through
[1:45:13] now process? A stock.
[1:45:17] What's next? The tsel.
[1:45:19] What's the next? It's the shock.
[1:45:22] Then the grain comes out of that just
[1:45:27] the three stages of it till it gets to
[1:45:31] the grain.
[1:45:33] He said God vindicates that. In other
[1:45:36] words, God vindicate. What is the
[1:45:38] vindication? I I pondered this a good
[1:45:40] deal. I want to bring it to you. God
[1:45:43] vindicates that. The vindication of it
[1:45:46] is that it started with a grain of wheat
[1:45:50] and it ends with a grain of wheat.
[1:45:53] That's the vindication. When the little
[1:45:56] blade comes out of the out of the
[1:45:58] ground, God sees wheat. We see a blade.
[1:46:04] It does. It's not the same color. It's
[1:46:07] not the same shape. And that has no
[1:46:10] resemblance of what went into the
[1:46:11] ground. But it is God's vindication. And
[1:46:15] God is vindicating when it comes into
[1:46:17] the stalk, into the tossel, and into the
[1:46:20] shock that holds it. But it's it's held
[1:46:22] in the shock. It's the those three
[1:46:25] stages
[1:46:27] until
[1:46:29] until the grain appears.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; See, until the grain matures.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; The church has come. We've come through
[1:46:37] Luther and justification. We've come
[1:46:40] through sanctification. We've come now
[1:46:42] through Pentecost and the baptism of the
[1:46:45] Holy Spirit, the restoration of gifts.
[1:46:47] We've come through all of those things
[1:46:50] and are held there. He said in these
[1:46:53] words now till it gets to the grain
[1:47:04] to redeem.
[1:47:07] This is the process of redemption.
[1:47:11] If we put it into botney life,
[1:47:15] if if if seeds were sown and they just
[1:47:18] rotted,
[1:47:22] I would say that that seed is not
[1:47:24] experiencing any redemption.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; But when it's sewn in the ground, rot
[1:47:32] and life comes up, it's in a process.
[1:47:36] It comes into the stalk into the tossel
[1:47:40] and into the shuck. And in that shuck
[1:47:43] now within the shock is being held wheat
[1:47:47] again. That seed has had a full
[1:47:51] redemption because what it was and it
[1:47:54] appeared to be lost has now come back
[1:47:57] the full distance and it is and that's
[1:48:00] God's vindication. That's what he's
[1:48:02] referring to. Now the church, my
[1:48:04] brother, my sister, I'm speaking on, the
[1:48:07] heavenly bridegroom has created his own
[1:48:11] bride. He has brought her through all of
[1:48:14] the uh uh a whole process. your physical
[1:48:19] body. I took a service on came from the
[1:48:22] eternities when God was was seeing a a a
[1:48:28] clinker
[1:48:30] a spark come off of the planet and it
[1:48:34] dropped for millions of years and said
[1:48:36] stop.
[1:48:38] And then this spinning mass that we're
[1:48:42] on today, it didn't always look like
[1:48:45] this. And then there was within the
[1:48:49] elements and the chemistry of that very
[1:48:53] planet, this planet earth began to be
[1:48:58] potachsh and calcium and various things
[1:49:01] that make up your body. And a prophet of
[1:49:04] God, how I'm glad I have these words
[1:49:06] that have come from him. Said, God, what
[1:49:09] was he doing? Asked the question. He was
[1:49:11] making you.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; That's this. If God went to that kind of
[1:49:19] degree, if God, eternal God, took that
[1:49:24] kind of span of eons of time, ages upon
[1:49:28] ages to bring a little body out of the
[1:49:31] dust of the earth that's going to last
[1:49:33] here for a few short years. Will it
[1:49:36] disappear, be like a vapor? Every one of
[1:49:39] us, if if we go the way of the grave,
[1:49:42] not going to be here that long. If my
[1:49:44] God, your God, did that for this body,
[1:49:47] how much more will he do, how much more
[1:49:51] did he will he shape and make that image
[1:49:54] of the soul?
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; That's why I took I took that over the
[1:50:02] over the weeks that we've been the
[1:50:03] physical part, the spirit part, but the
[1:50:07] soul part. And God's whole focus is that
[1:50:10] he's going to conform
[1:50:13] conformed. This body is not being
[1:50:15] conformed to the son of God, but that
[1:50:17] life that's in you, that seed that was
[1:50:20] predestinated in you is ordained and
[1:50:23] appointed to to become in the very image
[1:50:27] of the son of God.
[1:50:30] And I want to just say quickly
[1:50:32] because we are where we are in time
[1:50:35] because God's time piece of Israel
[1:50:39] all indicators indicate to one thing the
[1:50:42] world leaders where they are you can
[1:50:44] speak about politics you can speak about
[1:50:46] religion you can speak about it from any
[1:50:48] direction you want to speak and brother
[1:50:50] Brandham uses a another term which I
[1:50:53] think of quite often the position of the
[1:50:55] nations at this time. Amen.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; The position of the nations at the all
[1:51:01] of these things are pointing to one
[1:51:03] thing and that is we we talk about
[1:51:06] rapture. We have a rapture message. If
[1:51:09] that is the case, then the word of God,
[1:51:11] listen close now. I'm coming to what I
[1:51:14] really want to speak on. Then then God
[1:51:16] has reserved a certain word and has
[1:51:22] brought a certain people whom he
[1:51:26] forneew.
[1:51:28] He also did predestinate to this time
[1:51:31] and to this season and to the very seat
[1:51:34] you're sitting in this morning. He's
[1:51:36] ordained and appointed you to that time.
[1:51:40] And and in God's mind, it was that you
[1:51:43] should hear certain things that would
[1:51:46] speak to the inner soul of your being.
[1:51:49] And then by hearing that word the
[1:51:52] channel to the soul which is one channel
[1:51:55] is it can either have unbelief or faith
[1:51:57] in it. And this morning I'm praying that
[1:52:00] there will be channel after channel that
[1:52:02] will have nothing other than faith in
[1:52:05] it. And that channel of faith hears the
[1:52:08] word and it goes down to the soul. That
[1:52:13] is the instrument of God whereby he
[1:52:16] begins to transform that individual
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; into the image of his son. Now his son
[1:52:22] is the word
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and it transforms that individual you as
[1:52:27] the individual into the image of the
[1:52:30] word. The word which is spoken
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; your word body.
[1:52:39] Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; There is no other way for you to take on
[1:52:43] the shape of the word. The young lad is
[1:52:46] becoming a brain surgeon, but you are
[1:52:50] becoming a a candidate for the rapture.
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Follow this closely.
[1:53:05] God came to Abram
[1:53:08] before his name was changed
[1:53:11] and the prophet said an idol worshipper.
[1:53:15] God came to Abram and called him and
[1:53:18] spoke to him and how it happened how it
[1:53:22] was registered in Abram's life. I don't
[1:53:24] know. But it moved him so deeply that
[1:53:27] and God said, "Leave your kindred,
[1:53:30] leave your people
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; to a land that I will show you." And
[1:53:36] listen now to these words,
[1:53:47] and I will make of thee
[1:53:50] a great nation,
[1:53:53] and I will bless thee.
[1:53:56] It's amazing.
[1:53:59] Where's Abram's choice here?
[1:54:02] Where's his choosing? Where's his free
[1:54:05] will?
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; It doesn't exist.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; This is all God.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen friends. This happens to be
[1:54:12] our father.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; We're living here in Leodysia, but you
[1:54:16] haven't got anything to do with what God
[1:54:18] is doing.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; All you can do is say, "Here I am.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Take me.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Whatever there is, just take me.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I yield myself." That's the only thing
[1:54:28] you can do is give yourself over and
[1:54:29] yield yourself. And he says, I will
[1:54:32] bless thee and make thy name great, and
[1:54:37] thou shalt be a blessing, and I will
[1:54:39] bless them that bless thee, and curse
[1:54:41] them that curse thee, and in thee shall
[1:54:44] all the families of the earth be
[1:54:47] blessed.
[1:54:49] And God went on to say to Abraham, Abram
[1:54:53] at this time I just use Abraham says, "I
[1:54:57] will make you
[1:54:59] I will make you I will form you."
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; I'll form you. I'll make you a father of
[1:55:07] nations.
[1:55:10] Now listen,
[1:55:12] just listen now close and then it can
[1:55:13] take a quantum leap to the rapture. This
[1:55:16] is our father in the faith.
[1:55:19] and he's hearing some words. I'm going
[1:55:22] to make you a father of nations.
[1:55:26] How is he going to get from where he
[1:55:28] was, perhaps a sterile man, certainly
[1:55:32] with a barren wife? How is he going to
[1:55:35] get from where he's standing to be a
[1:55:38] father of nations?
[1:55:40] What's going to change him? What's going
[1:55:43] to transform him? He had to take on
[1:55:46] those words.
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:50] And when he took on those words and
[1:55:52] believed them, th those words shaped him
[1:55:55] into the father of nations.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Here you are.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Here I am in bodies that are essentially
[1:56:05] corrupting.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; How are we going to get from this
[1:56:09] corruption to incorruption?
[1:56:13] It's no different than Abraham being his
[1:56:16] wife barren, him perhaps sterile, having
[1:56:19] no child, being an idol worshipper, and
[1:56:23] God saying, "I'm going to make you a
[1:56:26] father of nations. How was God going to
[1:56:29] make him? How was God going to shape him
[1:56:33] from where he was to what God had in his
[1:56:36] mind he shall be?" Amen.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; God used no other tool,
[1:56:43] no other tool
[1:56:45] but his word.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; And he just kept speaking his word.
[1:56:50] Spoke his word, Abraham believed him.
[1:56:53] Spoke it again, Abraham believed him.
[1:56:56] Spoke it again, Abraham believed him.
[1:56:59] And God was conforming him. Actually
[1:57:01] transforming a man into the father of
[1:57:04] nations.
[1:57:06] Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Here we sit today and we can say, "Well,
[1:57:11] I'm afflicted or I'm sick or I'm this or
[1:57:14] I'm that or I've heard about this
[1:57:16] rapture. I've heard about the change of
[1:57:18] the body so many times that that is
[1:57:22] irrelevant to me in this service today."
[1:57:24] It is what do you believe?
[1:57:27] Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; And if you uh are absolutely thoroughly
[1:57:32] spiritually convinced this message is a
[1:57:36] final word sent from God that this
[1:57:39] message is indeed the rapture call.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; There's something in us.
[1:57:50] There's something in us. There's a
[1:57:51] promise
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; in the scripture
[1:57:54] that somebody
[1:57:57] is going to experience the resurrection.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that when God
[1:58:04] promised Abraham a land and God told him
[1:58:08] to go walking over the land,
[1:58:11] the only thing that was motivating him
[1:58:14] was some words that he had heard.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; You go and walk. and he began to
[1:58:19] physically walk over the land.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; We have a word that tells us and now
[1:58:26] it's a vindicated word. This isn't my
[1:58:29] idea. It's not William Brham's idea.
[1:58:32] It's no one else's idea. God said, "This
[1:58:35] is the time.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm going to do.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; And this is the kind of ministry it's
[1:58:40] going to be and I'm going to vindicate
[1:58:43] it.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to prove it." Yes,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; God identified by his own
[1:58:47] characteristics. Let us see Jesus.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, show us the father. What are all
[1:58:54] those messages? God confirming his word.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; God coming back be in behind those words
[1:59:01] and confirming it by the supernatural.
[1:59:03] And now we take that supernatural say
[1:59:06] that is the reality. God himself did
[1:59:08] this. No one did this. It has nothing to
[1:59:11] do with me or this service this morning.
[1:59:12] Has nothing to do with that. All All I
[1:59:14] can do is say God did that.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Brandon pray for some
[1:59:20] somebody and he he he just said if if
[1:59:22] you're desiring that stand. I just stood
[1:59:24] up where I was in the middle of my
[1:59:27] studies. I said that's for me.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; What am I doing? I'm putting footsteps
[1:59:32] on that promise. I'm walking in this
[1:59:35] promise. We shall be changed.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm walking. That's where
[1:59:43] you must walk. I am walking on this
[1:59:46] promise. We shall all be changed.
[1:59:50] We walk on that promise. We put
[1:59:53] footsteps on that promise. And by
[1:59:55] believing that word, that word will
[1:59:58] change your body.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Some of us just
[2:00:04] listen friends, don't get it wrong. You
[2:00:07] can't just live any way you want and
[2:00:08] just say, "Oh, the change is going to
[2:00:10] come somehow." You know, the message
[2:00:11] says this. The message is that just
[2:00:13] forget it.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; It's something that has made a reality
[2:00:18] to you that you think about every day.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; And you're walking on it. You're walking
[2:00:23] on that land. You're walking on that
[2:00:26] promise.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; I shall see those who have gone on
[2:00:33] before.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to meet those that have gone
[2:00:38] on before. I have a mother that's gone
[2:00:40] and a father that's gone. We have
[2:00:42] friends out of this assembly that have
[2:00:44] gone. I have a prophet messenger that's
[2:00:46] gone. I'm walking on that pro. I'm
[2:00:48] walking on that promise. I'm putting
[2:00:50] footsteps on it. We think about it every
[2:00:52] day. Listen to me, my brother, my
[2:00:54] sister. Without that, you can't be
[2:00:56] changed. It is the word of the promise
[2:00:58] that you receive and it comes down into
[2:01:01] your soul. You walk on that promise and
[2:01:04] that word changes you.
[2:01:08] That's the change.
[2:01:16] That's the change.
[2:01:17] [Music]
[2:01:19] And because the prophet says there'll be
[2:01:21] a sweep that'll go over you. How long is
[2:01:23] that sweep? This may be it now.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; In fact, as I suggest to you, you've
[2:01:29] been under the sweep.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; You've been under the breath of God.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:36] And like Peter said, hear my words.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; I say the same things today. You've
[2:01:42] heard things of your own idea, things of
[2:01:44] your own thoughts, but now you need to
[2:01:46] hear these words that God is speaking.
[2:01:49] This is a sweep.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; This is a change.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not something up high in the
[2:01:55] sky. Not just something in the future.
[2:01:57] You're being changed that they might be
[2:02:00] transformed, conformed into the image of
[2:02:03] his dear son. that he not to get us out
[2:02:06] of this trap, but that he might be the
[2:02:10] firstborn among many brethren.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And when we stand beyond the curtain of
[2:02:15] time, he is the one that's going to be
[2:02:18] glorified.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; This is the people I bought.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; This is the people I paid for. Look at
[2:02:27] them without spot, without wrinkle,
[2:02:30] without any such thing. Hallelujah.
[2:02:34] Hallelujah.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; We'll cast our crowns at his feet. The
[2:02:40] angels will cast down themselves.
[2:02:43] Hallelujah.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; This is the change, friends.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; That's the word that changed them.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; What changed Peter from being a coward
[2:02:56] and cursing
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; like two months ago?
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's it. You folks, now be honest with
[2:03:04] yourself.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; If you had heard that I had entered into
[2:03:08] a curses, saying, "I know nothing about
[2:03:11] this message. I know nothing about this
[2:03:14] Christ. I have nothing to do with that."
[2:03:16] And then see me 60 days later and say,
[2:03:18] "Hear my words."
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, just a second."
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; That just shows us how carnal we can be.
[2:03:28] But what happened was
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; what happened was Peter had believed the
[2:03:34] words.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; He did have a revelation that this was
[2:03:38] the Christ.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And under the pressure and under the
[2:03:43] bombardment for a moment he let go.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said when you're converted
[2:03:49] strengthen the brethren.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; We have to look beyond the weaknesses of
[2:03:54] our individual self and those around us.
[2:03:57] We are people under the promise.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; We're a people under the Exodus promise.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit will come to bring
[2:04:08] into effect the word for that season.
[2:04:11] And the word for this season is a change
[2:04:13] of the body.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; And we believe the word that we heard.
[2:04:19] That's the only way. Peter simply
[2:04:22] believed the word that he heard. He
[2:04:24] believed when Jesus said, "Go to
[2:04:26] Jerusalem and tarry."
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And he did it.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; You've heard me say it before. I'll say
[2:04:34] it again. The Holy Spirit did not come
[2:04:38] just say to
[2:04:42] Peter,
[2:04:44] James,
[2:04:46] John,
[2:04:47] the other disciples,
[2:04:52] the women. The Holy Spirit didn't come
[2:04:55] to 120 only.
[2:05:00] The Holy Spirit came to the word,
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; right? It just so happened that 120
[2:05:06] believed it.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he was seen of above 500
[2:05:13] brethren
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; after his resurrection,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; but 380
[2:05:19] did not get to the upper room.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; If you'd have gone to them and said, "Do
[2:05:25] you believe that was Jesus Christ the
[2:05:26] resurrection?" "Yes, I do." "Do you
[2:05:28] believe what he says? You believe he's
[2:05:30] God in the flesh?" "Yeah, I sure do.
[2:05:33] What were you doing when they were in
[2:05:35] the upper room? Well, you know, the
[2:05:36] pressures of life and the things I had
[2:05:38] to do and all of these things made it
[2:05:41] quite impossible for me. The Holy Spirit
[2:05:44] didn't come just to individuals is my
[2:05:47] point. The Holy Spirit came to the word.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; God's not coming to you with this change
[2:05:55] because you're a nice person or a bad
[2:05:58] person or for any other reason. He's
[2:06:00] coming to you because you happen to be a
[2:06:02] vessel of his word.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit cannot help but come to
[2:06:08] the word.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; He is the author of that word.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; He must come to it and he will come to
[2:06:13] it in spite of who you are, what you do,
[2:06:16] your failings or whatever more. The Holy
[2:06:18] Spirit will come to the word.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; My question as I come to a close and I'm
[2:06:24] far from over, but I'll say my question
[2:06:26] is, believe thou this
[2:06:33] Hallelujah. Yes sir.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Believest thou this
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; will come to the word he has given
[2:06:44] authorship to the word for this season.
[2:06:48] And God has done more than he should
[2:06:51] have had to d do by sending a messenger
[2:06:54] for 33 years across the globe letting
[2:06:58] the people know this is the time
[2:07:00] children
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; and you are the people.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And thus he would end his ministry by
[2:07:07] speaking
[2:07:10] rapture
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; things that are to be.
[2:07:18] modern events
[2:07:20] which was the event after the
[2:07:22] resurrection.
[2:07:24] Modern events made clear
[2:07:27] by the prophecy
[2:07:30] and the last one leadership
[2:07:33] and took a few minutes in another
[2:07:35] service for communion
[2:07:37] which is exactly what Jesus did in his
[2:07:40] life.
[2:07:42] gave him the final third pull ministry,
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; concluded with it with the messages that
[2:07:48] were largely from about chapter
[2:07:51] 15 or so on in John's gospel to the end.
[2:07:55] He's giving those in the upper room
[2:07:57] actually in the in the banquet room, the
[2:08:00] last supper room. He's giving his most
[2:08:03] intimate to those that believed him and
[2:08:06] those that had followed him. You read in
[2:08:09] John, it'll show you ahead of the
[2:08:11] chapters spoken in the Passover chamber.
[2:08:16] Those were to an intimate. Those were
[2:08:18] whom
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; he forneew.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; They were ordained
[2:08:24] to that time.
[2:08:27] God knew that they may fail and and
[2:08:30] flounder yet, but God was sending his
[2:08:33] spirit to that word
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; and they shall fulfill their pro their
[2:08:40] purpose in that time
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; as God knows there's a people that have
[2:08:45] believed the message that he has sent
[2:08:47] and they will fulfill his purpose in
[2:08:50] this time. If there isn't a rapture, God
[2:08:53] has failed. If there isn't a
[2:08:55] resurrection, God has failed. But God
[2:08:57] sent a word for his children to believe.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; And that word when it's believed
[2:09:04] changes, transforms you into the image
[2:09:06] of his son. Who is his son? The word.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; You believe the word.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; The word transforms you. You come into
[2:09:15] your word body.
[2:09:17] [Applause]
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:22] [Music]
[2:09:28] Well,
[2:09:30] I had 19 slides,
[2:09:33] but I'm not getting to them. And we're
[2:09:35] we'll do it another time.
[2:09:37] Isn't it wonderful?
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; When he was on the cross,
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; we were on his mind.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And he's at the right hand of the
[2:09:50] majesty on high at this moment. and and
[2:09:53] we're on his mind.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; And he's not only there, but he's here.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; And his children are on his mind.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:10:07] I hope this is a reality to you.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it?
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Is it to you a reality?
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:10:20] Glory. The whole theme of the message
[2:10:22] this morning, the whole theme is
[2:10:28] we are being transformed
[2:10:32] by the word that he has sent.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; And as it is spoken by the inspiration
[2:10:38] of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:41] and you receive it,
[2:10:43] you don't have to worry anymore.
[2:10:46] You're going to come into the image of
[2:10:49] his son.
[2:10:51] And listen, listen as I close. His son,
[2:10:57] it was appointed that he should be just
[2:10:58] a lad.
[2:11:00] It was appointed that he at 12 years old
[2:11:02] would be in the temple with the great
[2:11:04] leaders. It was appointed that he should
[2:11:08] live his life 30 years and then start
[2:11:09] his ministry. It was appointed and he
[2:11:11] lived it all out because that was the
[2:11:13] word for the season. If there's anything
[2:11:15] that's clear in brother Brandham's
[2:11:17] message, it is that there's a word
[2:11:19] allotted for a certain season. And
[2:11:23] there's a word allotted to the
[2:11:25] individual.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Your part
[2:11:28] no one can take that. You have a part of
[2:11:31] the word might be small, might be large,
[2:11:35] might be of a few days.
[2:11:38] I've thought about this very thing in
[2:11:40] the context of Silas's life.
[2:11:44] Very short,
[2:11:46] not long.
[2:11:49] God dealing with and then God takes him.
[2:11:52] I don't understand that. But I leave
[2:11:54] that entirely in God's hands. That is
[2:11:58] another thing we have no choice about.
[2:12:00] You'll be here as long as God wants you
[2:12:03] here and God will take you from here.
[2:12:06] But while you're here, you have a part.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen once again?
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; You have a part and you will live that.
[2:12:15] And that part is Christ.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; That part is the word.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; And that word is tied to what not only
[2:12:21] is over here. You're here in a physical
[2:12:23] form, but that word is tied to beyond
[2:12:26] the realm, beyond the curtain of time.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; The theophony that's beside you.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; You cannot separate that word from that.
[2:12:33] That is a word body. You skipped around
[2:12:36] that by a natural birth that brought you
[2:12:38] into this condition, into this state,
[2:12:40] into a into into a dying condition. But
[2:12:43] that word body knows nothing about
[2:12:45] dying. The word body knows nothing about
[2:12:48] corruption. How are you going to get
[2:12:50] from this one into that one? By
[2:12:52] believing that portion of the word that
[2:12:54] God has sent.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; I hope that's clear.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:13:03] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand, shall we?
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just thank him?
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. Raise your voice.
[2:13:10] Whatever you'd like to do. Say, "I thank
[2:13:11] you, Father. Thank you for sending what
[2:13:13] you sent. Thank you for the presence of
[2:13:16] the Holy Spirit. Thank you for what
[2:13:18] you're doing, oh God. Here I am. Here I
[2:13:20] am, Lord. Just take me. Take me. Do what
[2:13:23] you would. Mold me. Shape me. You're the
[2:13:26] creator. Make me into that image. Oh
[2:13:29] God, I'm here surrendering myself,
[2:13:31] submitting myself. Oh, Father,
[2:13:36] we thank you for the goodness for your
[2:13:38] mercy and your great great love that
[2:13:41] you've shown to the children of men.
[2:13:44] What you're doing, Lord, amongst us. Oh
[2:13:47] God, I pray you'll bring your word with
[2:13:49] a greater reality. Give us a mind. Give
[2:13:52] us a spirit, oh father, to receive the
[2:13:55] full measure
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; of your word.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:18] Glory, glory.

[2:16:03] I was on his

[2:16:10] hath no terrors.
[2:16:14] Look at the words if you would please
[2:16:17] as we Death hath no terrors for the
[2:16:22] bloodbought one. Oh, glory, hallelujah,
[2:16:24] to the lamb.
[2:16:26] I one of the things I like about the
[2:16:28] song is it's very praise and worship
[2:16:30] oriented. And I believe we should just
[2:16:32] give him glory. Friends,
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; if you're thankful for what you've
[2:16:35] received, if you're thankful for what
[2:16:36] God has,
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Exodus people,
[2:16:45] people come under the transforming power
[2:16:47] of almighty God.
[2:16:50] people who's not having to eat
[2:16:53] what other people are having to eat.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; It would make you sick.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; Here you are.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; What has done that? God and God alone.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful?
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. Just break loose of your
[2:17:08] shackles and give him praise and do
[2:17:11] what's in your heart to do. But let's
[2:17:13] just sing this together as we come to a

[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Okay, I want everybody under 25 to sing
[2:19:42] that chorus. Glory, hallelujah.
[2:19:45] Sometimes it kind of tells what age a
[2:19:47] person is. But anyway, everybody under
[2:19:49] 25, all the young people, let let me
[2:19:52] hear your voice now.

[2:20:25] didn't let it loose.
