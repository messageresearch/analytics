[0:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[0:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[0:03] sound the mystery of God should be
[0:05] finished as he hath declared to his
[0:08] servants the
[0:14] prophets the female only produces the
[0:16] egg the incubator she is to pack the the
[0:19] The Brood but the blood comes from the
[0:21] male that's the reason the child takes
[0:23] the father's name and the woman married
[0:26] to a man takes his name on account of
[0:27] children she becomes an incubator of for
[0:30] the child that she shall Bear for the
[0:32] man but like a as I said a hen can lay
[0:35] an egg but she hasn't been with the male
[0:37] bird it won't hatch that's I said that's
[0:40] Reas we got so many old cold farmer
[0:41] churches today they got on this nicadan
[0:44] idea got a bunch of nest full of rotten
[0:46] eggs and they never will hatch because
[0:47] he a you could do anything to them call
[0:50] them Bishops deacons and whatever know
[0:51] they'll never believe in signs following
[0:52] the Believers because they've never been
[0:54] with the mate Jesus Christ if you ever
[0:57] get fertilized with that mate of the
[0:59] power of God when that blood cell was
[1:01] broke down on Calvary and that life that
[1:04] was in there teeny Jehovah oh it ought
[1:07] to be stting
