Description:
Lyrics
I’ve been changed
Healed
Freed
Delivered
I’ve found joy
Peace
Grace
And favor
I’ve been changed (I’ve been changed)
In the presence of the Lord, I’ve been
(Healed)
Freed (freed), delivered (delivered)
In your presence Lord
(I’ve found joy)
(Peace)
Grace (grace)
And favor (and favor)
And right now (right now is the moment)
Today (today is the day)
I’ve been changed (I’ve been changed)
I’ve been changed (I’ve been changed)
And I have waited (I have waited for this moment to come)
So we say
I won’t go back, can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before Your presence came and changed me
Say, I won’t
I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before Your presence came and changed me
(All my shame)
They’ve been forgiven (forgiven)
No more chains
Fear
My past (my past) is over (is over)
Say, right now (right now is the moment)
Today (today is the day)
I’ve been changed (I’ve been changed)
Come on someone declare that, I’ve been changed (I’ve been changed)
And I have waited (I have waited for this moment)
This moment right here, I have waited all my life (to come)
(And I won’t let it pass me by)
So we say
I won’t go back, can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before Your presence came and changed me
I need somebody, lift up your voices and declare
I won’t (I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be)
Before Your presence came and changed me
I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before your presence came and changed me
Somebody say… I won’t go back
I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before Your presence came and changed me
Would you lift your voice and say
I won’t (I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be)
Before Your presence came and changed me
Come on, somebody, lift your voice and declare it and say
I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to the way it used to be
Before Your presence came and changed me
Somebody say… I won’t go back, say
I won’t go back, I can’t go back, to ...
