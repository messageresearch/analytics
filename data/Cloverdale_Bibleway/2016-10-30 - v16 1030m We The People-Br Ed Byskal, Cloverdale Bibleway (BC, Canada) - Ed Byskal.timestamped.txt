[0:00] of Alexander David on October 27th at
[0:04] 1:37 a.m. weighing in at 8 lb and 8 o
[0:10] and um 21.6 in long. They're very
[0:13] accurate.
[0:16] Both baby and mommy are doing well.
[0:18] Praise the Lord.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; And then a testimony from Brother Norm
[0:23] and Sister Louise.
[0:25] Um you got to excuse me. I got to put on
[0:28] these cuz I don't want to make a
[0:30] mistake.
[0:34] Uh, Brother Norm writes in, "Thank you
[0:36] for your prayers. Two weeks ago, Sister
[0:39] Louise saw her diabetic specialist. She
[0:43] was almost hospitalized
[0:45] due to an extremely high sugar count.
[0:48] She was given insulin in the office. Her
[0:51] sugar count dropped
[0:53] and she was allowed to go home.
[0:56] As of Friday, her number was below the
[0:59] target seven. She hasn't been there for
[1:03] many years. She wants to give the Lord
[1:05] all the glory for the remarkable
[1:08] turnaround. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:11] you so much. God bless you richly and
[1:13] continue to heal you and raise you up.
[1:15] Amen.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Let's sing uh victory
[1:19] in Jesus.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; I heard an old old story.
[1:27] Praise God. Let's sing it with all your
[1:28] heart. I heard an old old story. How a
[1:33] savior came from glory. How he
[1:38] on Calvary
[1:40] save a rich life for me. And I heard
[1:44] about his gro
[1:48] at.
[1:50] And I repented of my sins and won the
[1:54] victory.
[1:56] Oh, victory in Jesus my savior forever.
[2:03] He sought me and he bought me with his
[2:08] redee blood. He loved me and I knew him
[2:13] and all my love.
[2:17] He bunched me to victory
[2:21] in the cleansing blood. I heard about
[2:25] his healing of his cleansing power
[2:29] healing. How he made you walk with me
[2:34] and he caused the blind to see
[2:37] [Applause]
[2:39] Jesus come and he
[2:43] spit
[2:44] and somehow Jesus came on to the
[2:49] victory.
[2:50] Oh, victory
[2:53] Jesus my savior forever.
[2:57] He saw me and he bought me his
[3:03] blood. He
[3:08] and all my
[3:11] blood.
[3:18] I heard about a mansion he has built for
[3:22] me.
[3:25] And I heard about the streets of beyond
[3:29] the crystal
[3:31] world
[3:34] and the orange
[3:37] story. And someday I'll sing our song
[3:43] victory.
[3:45] Oh,
[3:47] Jesus my s
[3:51] [Music]
[3:54] and me
[3:59] [Music]
[4:02] and all my
[4:08] victory.
[4:12] Oh, victory.
[4:16] I see.
[4:18] [Music]
[4:21] And
[4:23] [Music]
[4:26] of my
[4:30] [Music]
[4:33] blood.
[4:35] Victory
[4:36] in the cleansing blood.
[4:40] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed
[4:46] and I'm following
[4:49] a price.
[4:52] Jesus
[4:53] has changed my whole life.
[4:57] [Music]
[5:03] I see
[5:06] who I am.
[5:11] that I
[5:13] [Music]
[5:17] I'll tell
[5:19] his face
[5:22] tell of his precious love.
[5:26] I'll tell
[5:28] his goodness
[5:30] to me.
[5:34] He purchases my redemption
[5:39] with his precious blood
[5:43] and sing
[5:48] [Music]
[5:56] and I'm
[5:57] [Music]
[6:01] Jesus
[6:02] and
[6:06] [Music]
[6:09] If anybody
[6:11] ask you to guess who I am,
[6:18] there
[6:28] was
[6:30] the
[6:33] of
[6:35] where there was confusion
[6:38] peace now.
[6:42] Oh, when I walk in
[6:45] with Jesus, I follow
[6:50] the king
[6:51] and it's all because
[6:54] I am
[6:57] [Music]
[7:01] I am
[7:04] and I
[7:07] [Music]
[7:12] Make my life.
[7:16] [Music]
[7:20] Yes.
[7:22] Yes.
[7:24] I am
[7:26] [Music]
[7:29] I am.
[7:32] [Music]
[7:35] Let's try that song. He signed the feet
[7:37] number 302. I don't know how many of you
[7:39] know this song. We used to sing it a lot
[7:43] years ago and it's been going through my
[7:45] mind and I just think the words are just
[7:48] perfect.
[7:51] He signed the deed with his atoning
[7:52] blood. He ever lives to make his promise
[7:55] sure. Though all the hosts of hell march
[7:58] in to make a second claim, they all have
[8:01] to march out at the mention of Jesus
[8:03] name. Amen. Praise God. Let's all stand
[8:07] together.
[8:08] We'll learn it together.
[8:11] He signed the deed with his atoning
[8:16] blood. He ever lives to make his
[8:22] promise.
[8:24] Though all the hosts of hell march in to
[8:28] make a second claim,
[8:31] they all march out at the mansion of his
[8:36] name.
[8:37] He signs us
[8:40] with his atoning blood. He ever
[8:46] will make his promise.
[8:50] Though all the hosts of hell march in to
[8:53] make a second claim,
[8:56] they all march out at the manion of his
[9:01] name. One more tiny sign
[9:05] with days of joining
[9:10] lives to make his promise.
[9:14] Though all the hosts of hell marching to
[9:18] make a second claim, they all march out
[9:23] at the manion of his name.
[9:28] And he's everything.
[9:32] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[9:38] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[9:43] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[9:48] He's everything
[9:50] to me. Oh yes, he's everything.
[9:57] He's everything to me. He's everything.
[10:03] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[10:08] my mother, my sister, and my brother.
[10:12] He's everything
[10:15] to me. Oh yes, he's everything.
[10:20] [Music]
[10:22] everything to me. He's everything.
[10:28] He's everything to me. He's my father,
[10:32] my brother, my sister, and my brother.
[10:37] He's everything
[10:40] to me.
[10:44] Let's just sing that song. Jesus. Jesus.
[10:46] There's just something about that name.
[10:50] As we prepare to go to the throne of
[10:52] grace, I'm just going to ask brother
[10:53] Norm Wood if you'd come and lead us to
[10:55] the throne of grace. I don't have no
[10:56] written requests this morning, but we
[10:59] are a needy people and we know that God
[11:02] supplies our need.
[11:04] Praise God. Jesus. Jesus. There's just
[11:07] something about that name.
[11:10] Oh, Jesus.
[11:14] Jesus.
[11:16] Jesus.
[11:20] There's just something
[11:23] about
[11:25] that name.
[11:30] Master,
[11:33] Savior
[11:35] Jesus,
[11:39] like a fragrance
[11:42] after
[11:44] the rain.
[11:46] [Music]
[11:49] Jesus,
[11:52] Jesus,
[11:54] Jesus.
[11:58] Let all heaven
[12:01] and earth
[12:03] proclaim.
[12:08] Kings
[12:10] and kingdoms
[12:12] will all
[12:14] pass away.
[12:16] Yet there's nothing
[12:19] about
[12:21] that. As brother Norm comes, let's just
[12:23] sing that in worship once more. Oh
[12:27] Jesus,
[12:29] Jesus.
[12:31] Jesus.
[12:35] There's something
[12:38] about
[12:40] that day.
[12:45] master
[12:48] save
[12:50] Jesus
[12:54] like the rain
[12:57] and
[12:59] the rain.
[13:00] [Music]
[13:02] Oh hallelujah
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[13:06] Jesus
[13:08] Jesus
[13:12] let all heaven
[13:15] and earth
[13:17] proclaim
[13:22] kings
[13:24] and kingdoms
[13:27] will all
[13:28] pass away
[13:31] but
[13:32] something
[13:34] about
[13:36] that day.
[13:39] [Music]
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Just hold your request before the Lord.
[13:44] The Lord Jesus is very present and very
[13:46] near. God bless you, brother Noah.
[13:51] If I may just add a couple more things
[13:53] that testimony I couldn't write down. Um
[13:56] when she went there, of course, the
[13:58] doctor took the sugar number. It was off
[14:00] her scale.
[14:01] So at that point she says, "I should
[14:03] send you to the hospital, but I'll give
[14:04] you an hour. You take this insulin and
[14:06] if it's not done an hour, are you going
[14:08] to go?" Well, it did drop.
[14:10] And then um you know, she's given the
[14:12] ultimatum. Okay. And if it you come back
[14:14] in a week and if it's not good, you're
[14:16] not going to Hawaii either.
[14:18] So that was a bit of a bombshell. But um
[14:21] anyways, it worked. Come back in a week.
[14:23] It was dropped down lower than what
[14:24] she's ever been at. Even with insulin
[14:26] before, she'd never been able to get to
[14:28] these numbers. And then Friday morning,
[14:32] which is uh 2 weeks and a day after
[14:35] she'd been in there, it was under seven.
[14:37] She'd never ever been there. Probably 20
[14:39] 25 years, something like a long long
[14:41] time since she was a much younger
[14:43] person. Anyways, the Lord took care of
[14:45] it all. And um you know, I think it's
[14:48] just the Lord doing it. I mean, there's
[14:50] insulin for sure, but she never been
[14:52] able to get to these numbers with the
[14:53] insulin before. So, the Lord had to be
[14:55] undertaking. So, anyways, God bless you.
[14:58] Thanks again for your prayers. And let's
[14:59] just ask the Lord now to be with us.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your grace,
[15:05] your mercy, and Lord, truly it is your
[15:07] name, Lord, that makes the devil
[15:09] tremble. And we've seen that again in
[15:11] our lives and in the church, Lord, have
[15:14] you undertaken for different souls. And
[15:17] we thank you for that, Lord. We ask now
[15:20] that you'd be in our midst that you
[15:21] might continue to forgive us, Lord,
[15:24] where we fail you and do things a miss,
[15:27] have maybe wrong thoughts. We just ask
[15:29] you'd help us rise above those things.
[15:32] Ask now you'd be in a ministry, be with
[15:34] the brother, bringing the word, Lord,
[15:37] just anoint them that we could hear the
[15:39] words of life and that it would change
[15:41] our lives, Lord, and just be a benefit
[15:43] to us. We ask you to just be with us, be
[15:46] in our midst, Lord, be with the tithes
[15:49] that are offerings that are taking up
[15:50] this morning. May just bless the hands
[15:52] that give richly those that are not able
[15:54] to. Father, just be in our midst. We
[15:57] pray now on the balance of the service
[15:59] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[16:06] Appreciate that so much. Just thank the
[16:09] Lord Jesus. As I take up the tithe and
[16:12] offering this morning, you have your
[16:13] seats.
[16:15] Let's uh sing that little chorus. Oh,
[16:18] how I love Jesus. There is a name I love
[16:20] to hear.
[16:24] There is
[16:26] a name
[16:28] I love to hear
[16:32] and I love
[16:35] to sing.
[16:37] It's worth
[16:41] it
[16:43] like the music
[16:45] in my ear.
[16:49] the sweetest
[16:51] saint.
[16:54] [Music]
[16:56] Oh, sing it to him. Oh,
[17:00] how I love Jesus.
[17:04] [Music]
[17:06] Oh,
[17:08] how I love Jesus.
[17:16] How I love Jesus
[17:22] because
[17:23] we
[17:25] love me. We're going to have a special
[17:28] and those that will be doing this
[17:30] special will just get ready. We'll sing
[17:31] the second verse
[17:33] and the chorus again. It tells
[17:38] the
[17:40] Savior's
[17:42] love who died
[17:45] to set me free.
[17:49] He
[17:51] carous.
[18:00] [Music]
[18:16] Oh,
[18:18] I
[18:19] love Jesus.
[18:24] Oh,
[18:26] I love Jesus.
[18:30] [Music]
[18:31] Because
[18:33] he'll
[18:35] sing verse three.
[18:39] It tells
[18:41] me what my father
[18:46] [Music]
[18:57] I
[19:01] so bad
[19:03] sun shine all the way.
[19:11] Oh,
[19:13] how I love Jesus.
[19:17] [Music]
[19:19] Oh,
[19:21] how I love Jesus.
[19:29] How I love Jesus
[19:33] [Music]
[19:35] because
[19:37] first
[19:39] of
[19:41] [Music]
[20:03] I know what
[20:08] my f
[20:12] on.
[20:18] I know not what
[20:22] my future holds.
[20:27] Lord, I have
[20:32] no way of knowing,
[20:38] but I know the one
[20:43] who holds my future.
[20:48] And I have no fear
[20:53] of where I'm going.
[20:59] Sometimes it seems
[21:03] like I'm standing still
[21:08] until I
[21:11] [Music]
[21:12] look back and see
[21:17] how deep my valley,
[21:22] how high the hill
[21:27] And each step nearer
[21:31] to eternity,
[21:36] I know not what
[21:40] my future holds.
[21:46] Lord, I have
[21:50] no way of knowing.
[21:54] But I know the one
[21:59] who holds my future.
[22:04] And I have no fear
[22:07] [Music]
[22:08] of where I'm going.
[22:14] Sometimes my friends
[22:18] misunderstand
[22:20] me
[22:22] cuz I hear the sound
[22:27] of a different drummer.
[22:32] But I know my life
[22:35] [Music]
[22:37] is in his hands.
[22:41] Just as sure as autumn
[22:46] follows
[22:48] summer.
[22:50] I know not what
[22:55] my future holds.
[23:00] Lord, I have
[23:04] no way of knowing,
[23:09] but I know my love.
[23:14] Who holds my future,
[23:18] and I have no fear
[23:23] of where I'm going.
[23:28] I know not what
[23:33] my future holds.
[23:38] Lord, I have
[23:42] no way of knowing.
[23:47] But I know the one
[23:52] who holds my future.
[23:56] And I have no fear
[23:59] [Music]
[24:01] of where I'm going.
[24:04] [Music]
[24:06] And I have no fear
[24:11] of where I'm going.
[24:15] [Music]
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. And we'll just invite
[24:26] our pastor to come at this time and
[24:28] let's just sing that song together. Oh
[24:30] yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king.
[24:32] Let's stand together.

[24:59] now can sing. Praise God. Praise God.
[25:05] Oh, I'm a child of the king. Oh yes.
[25:12] Oh yes. I'm a child of the king.
[25:19] His royal
[25:21] blood
[25:22] now blows through my face and died who
[25:29] was wretched and th
[25:33] now can sing. Praise God.
[25:37] Praise God. Oh, I'm a child of the king.
[25:43] I'm amazed that he loves me.
[25:48] I'm amazed
[25:50] [Music]
[25:52] that you love me.
[25:56] I'm amazed
[25:59] how you came
[26:03] through. Your preious
[26:05] [Music]
[26:07] glory
[26:10] and my sins
[26:12] are
[26:15] all away. Oh my
[26:20] god.
[26:23] [Music]
[26:28] [Applause]
[26:31] [Music]
[26:46] and my sins are
[26:51] all washed away all my
[26:59] [Music]
[27:03] father
[27:05] we are for this day that you've given us
[27:09] and the
[27:11] counsel that you've left us
[27:13] &gt;&gt; the words that you've spoken to us we I
[27:16] pray father in the name of Jesus Christ
[27:19] that you will take and uh have control
[27:22] of the speaker and the hearers.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord
[27:25] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:40] Too many wires.
[27:43] Amen. Good to look down into your faces
[27:45] today. And uh we're going to go directly
[27:51] to the word.
[27:53] So thank you musicians.
[27:58] I have a very different type of a
[28:00] service today.
[28:02] So
[28:04] uh
[28:06] I want to include everyone
[28:09] in a very special way.
[28:12] And this is more of a lesson.
[28:15] Uh there's something that I've observed
[28:17] over the years and that is people come
[28:19] to church and they hear a message. The
[28:23] message has a content, has a beginning,
[28:26] has an end
[28:29] quite often an appeal to the people or
[28:31] the needy at the end.
[28:34] But there's one thing that I have seen
[28:36] that is uh missing as far as the message
[28:39] itself is concerned.
[28:41] The message
[28:43] and the messenger
[28:46] are is a it's a dispensational and by
[28:49] saying dispensational that involves the
[28:52] economy of a season that in involves
[28:55] events within a season
[28:58] and it involves all of that time that's
[29:03] involved in what is termed as an age and
[29:08] brother Brennham refers to the age and I
[29:11] want to if we miss that element within
[29:14] the message you essentially miss really
[29:18] what the message is all about and I feel
[29:21] that there are people especially uh
[29:24] young people and children and all of us
[29:30] so I'm going to include us all in this
[29:33] uh particular time so I have asked for
[29:35] God's
[29:37] help and I'm going to try to move along
[29:40] as as quickly as possible.
[29:43] Um,
[29:45] and I don't want you to look upon this
[29:47] as a just a service and you listening
[29:51] and hearing and the people gathered and
[29:53] me speaking. I don't want you to get
[29:56] that. I've got I've got a lot of slides.
[29:59] I'm going to try to tie the whole season
[30:03] together.
[30:04] The age of the Leodysans.
[30:09] Uh,
[30:12] I'll just have you have your seats for a
[30:15] moment.
[30:16] Keep your Bibles ready.
[30:25] I'm going to do something different just
[30:27] now.
[30:29] Brother Brandham said that the Leodysain
[30:31] church age
[30:33] began about 1906.
[30:38] So I will ask all of those that were
[30:42] born
[30:43] from 1900
[30:46] to 1950
[30:49] to stand.
[30:54] All right.
[30:56] You notice I'm standing also. Now you
[31:00] remain standing. Then I'll have 1950
[31:04] to 2000 stand.
[31:12] All right.
[31:14] Now, the younger ones from 2000
[31:18] to October 2016,
[31:21] I'll have you stand. You've been born
[31:23] during that time.
[31:27] I don't think there's anyone here
[31:29] standing
[31:33] or there's anyone still seated.
[31:36] So I think that the message actually
[31:40] refers to all of us
[31:42] and the events. So you might think, oh
[31:44] well that was long time ago. No, no, I
[31:47] don't think so.
[31:49] I think that it involves you.
[31:53] And uh I'm going to read now some uh
[31:55] some scripture, but I'm going to put it
[31:57] up on the
[32:01] on the screen.
[32:09] and unto the angel
[32:11] of the church of the Leodyans
[32:14] write these things. So now this is a
[32:16] letter
[32:19] that is from God
[32:24] sent through John
[32:28] to the angel or the messenger and that's
[32:31] none other than brother Brennham and
[32:33] I'll we'll be able to declare that
[32:37] there's abundant we've had services here
[32:40] services you've heard on the vindication
[32:43] the vindication the vindication
[32:46] E even if you heard it once, if God just
[32:49] vindicated it once, that should be
[32:51] sufficient for all of you.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; So this letter came from God by the Holy
[32:58] Spirit. And the last scripture we will
[33:01] read, we will read this the the
[33:04] scripture to the church of the Leodysans
[33:07] is not a very nice one, but it gives a
[33:11] tremendous and wonderful invitation at
[33:14] the end.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; And then it says that we should hear
[33:19] what the spirit saith to the church.
[33:23] So it's not John, it's not brother
[33:26] Brandham, it's not any person, it's not
[33:29] the preacher standing behind the pulpit.
[33:31] You are to hear what the Holy Spirit is
[33:35] saying to the church
[33:38] and then the events that took place. I
[33:40] intend to by God's help to
[33:45] uh just tie together some of the events.
[33:48] Now I I tried this out on one or two
[33:52] people mostly my wife just to see what
[33:55] their reaction is. And do you know that
[33:58] the events there's one thing that is
[34:01] outstanding about this age? The events
[34:04] are just incredibly
[34:07] fast.
[34:09] Incredibly fast. They're merging one
[34:12] with another scarcely. one is over and
[34:15] the other one is coming in.
[34:19] The brother Brandham said that the age
[34:22] started about 1906.
[34:25] He was born in 1909.
[34:28] 3 years later,
[34:31] 1914,
[34:33] he's just a boy and that's just a few
[34:36] years has gone by just a very few years
[34:38] and the first world war has happened.
[34:42] And it happened the first world war
[34:44] happened because
[34:46] uh
[34:49] his name was France Ferdinand
[34:53] of in Sievo
[34:56] which you might think of just being
[34:58] Sievo was one one of the winter Olympics
[35:01] was there it was in I don't know whether
[35:03] it's Bosnia is it Bosnia now Sievo is in
[35:06] Bosnia but it was s and so war was
[35:10] declared on Serbia.
[35:13] Brother Milco came from Yugoslavia which
[35:16] involved all of that area at that time.
[35:21] And uh and that was the first world war.
[35:23] It was a brutal war. My wife is standing
[35:26] back there. Her daddy was in that war.
[35:30] He was in the trenches.
[35:32] She just read a letter that he had
[35:34] written
[35:36] and he had a comp there was a company of
[35:38] people. He became a sergeant and he
[35:41] looked around at one time and he was the
[35:43] only one standing.
[35:46] They were all all killed.
[35:49] Uh these things were not funny times.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; These things were not joyous times, but
[35:55] they're real times. This happened.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; It's happened in your age, Leodysian
[36:02] age. And then that war was over in uh
[36:06] November of
[36:08] uh 1918
[36:12] and the Roaring 20s started.
[36:15] And the Roaring 20s were a was a
[36:18] hilarious time of liberation of the
[36:21] people
[36:23] making vast amounts of money. And then
[36:26] came the 1929 crash
[36:29] and people leaped out of buildings in
[36:32] New York and other places and destroyed
[36:35] themselves, committed suicide for the
[36:37] loss of the trillions of dollars.
[36:41] And that was the roaring 20s. That's
[36:45] barely over. In fact, as I hardly think
[36:48] it is over and the depression starts and
[36:52] the Great Depression, we'll just I'm
[36:55] going to show you clips of slides and I
[36:59] won't get into some of the brutality of
[37:02] it all. I just feel it would be too
[37:05] harmful for our perhaps our young
[37:07] people. Didn't even leave me feeling
[37:11] very happy. And then the great
[37:14] depression and and then the second world
[37:17] war commences
[37:19] and the second world war ends with a
[37:22] incredible cloud of destruction.
[37:27] And that cloud is barely gone. And that
[37:31] war of second world war is just
[37:34] beginning.
[37:35] And while it's beginning and in the
[37:37] midst of it is an incredible persecution
[37:40] on one people,
[37:43] mostly one people called the Jews. And
[37:47] while they're being driven back home
[37:49] during the same time, God now has
[37:53] released and loosed a messenger, the
[37:56] messenger to the Leodysian church.
[38:00] He's released him and begins uh a a
[38:05] indisputable indescribable and
[38:08] indisputable irre just indisputable
[38:13] ministry of healing and miracles.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; That he's going to call this age and the
[38:19] people of this age which you are all
[38:21] standing. He's going to call them to be
[38:24] accountable
[38:26] for what you did, what I did with this
[38:30] message.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; And he releases this message with he
[38:34] himself standing at the platform
[38:37] and the messenger saying until he comes
[38:41] &gt;&gt; I can't do anything. Right?
[38:44] &gt;&gt; It's him
[38:46] &gt;&gt; from another dimension, from another
[38:48] realm, a breath away that's going to
[38:50] call the people of this age to be
[38:53] accountable.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, what did you do with it?
[38:57] &gt;&gt; And you folks that are here this morning
[38:59] are going to be doubly accountable
[39:02] because I have I have felt so oppressed
[39:07] and to lay this out this way.
[39:10] And then Israel is born.
[39:14] And that's a birth, a new birth for them
[39:16] while a new birth is being announced to
[39:20] a bride of Jesus Christ.
[39:23] And I end up with
[39:26] Israel being chopped. Brother Brandham
[39:28] says, chopped from the nations
[39:32] at the same time he's chopping a bride
[39:34] from the denominations.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; It is really incredible.
[39:39] And I think that you will be benefited
[39:42] by this. I'm reading now. You have here
[39:47] Revelation 3:14. And we'll continue to
[39:50] read.
[39:53] I know thy works
[39:56] that thou art neither hot
[39:59] uh nor co nor hot. I would thou art cold
[40:04] or hot. So then because thou art
[40:06] lukewarm, this was the message of the
[40:09] church. Was he popular? Of course any
[40:11] messenger was going to say this couldn't
[40:13] be popular. And neither cold nor hot. I
[40:16] will spew thee out of my mouth. Because
[40:19] thou sayest, I am rich and increased
[40:22] with goods and have need of nothing, and
[40:25] knowest not that thou art wretched and
[40:27] miserable, and poor, and blind, and
[40:30] naked.
[40:34] I counsel thee to buy of me gold ti
[40:37] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[40:40] rich and white raignment that thou
[40:42] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[40:45] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[40:48] thine eyes with eyes have that thou
[40:50] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[40:53] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[40:55] repent behold I stand at the door and
[40:58] knock and I I would say that he is doing
[41:02] that even this morning.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; And knock. If any man hear my voice and
[41:09] open the door, I will come into him and
[41:12] will s with him and he with me. To him
[41:15] that overcomemeth will I grant to sit
[41:17] with me in my throne, even all as I also
[41:21] overcame, and am sat down with my father
[41:24] in his throne.
[41:26] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[41:29] the spirit saith unto the churches. God
[41:33] bless his word to us. You may be seated.
[41:40] I'm going to just interject before the
[41:43] slides. I'm going to interject
[41:46] the scripture that actually was inspired
[41:49] to me to uh come to this message in this
[41:52] direction.
[41:54] Uh in Moses time,
[41:59] he went up and we uh all know of the
[42:02] account. It's in Exodus actually 32.
[42:05] Don't turn to it. I'm just going to uh
[42:07] be referring to some scriptures out of
[42:09] it later on if I have time. But Moses,
[42:13] he was now he's the first prophet
[42:16] because the people had said don't we
[42:19] don't want to hear directly from God
[42:21] anymore. It was too fearful.
[42:24] So
[42:25] you go and you hear from him and then
[42:28] you come and tell us what he said.
[42:31] So now that's the first instance that
[42:34] God begins to speak and he said there's
[42:37] been no man like Moses. I spa I spake to
[42:41] him um mouth to ear and and then Moses
[42:47] was on the mountain receiving the words
[42:49] from God himself
[42:52] and he comes down the mountain with
[42:54] Joshua his servant and he hears uh all
[42:58] the sound and and uh it's a sound and
[43:02] and there's a confusion about the sound.
[43:05] Well, it sounds like victory. And and uh
[43:08] there's a sound down there Joshua sang.
[43:11] And Moses speaks to him said, "No, this
[43:14] is not the sound of anyone that's
[43:16] rejoicing from a victory, and this is
[43:20] not the sound of those that have been
[43:22] overcome."
[43:24] And they got down, and they they had
[43:26] made the golden calf,
[43:29] and they were uh having realry and so
[43:33] on. And there's some confusion a little
[43:35] bit. Perhaps I can straighten out if the
[43:37] Lord will help me. Uh concerning the
[43:40] sound. And it says, "And they they were
[43:43] naked and they rose up to play and so on
[43:45] and so forth, eating and drinking and
[43:48] making marry."
[43:50] And uh but when the the word that is
[43:54] used, the Hebrew word that Aaron had
[43:57] made them naked is that they were
[44:00] leaderless.
[44:02] They Moses Moses was on the mountain
[44:05] getting the word from God and they now
[44:08] were without a leader
[44:10] and uh they they had gone to gone to
[44:14] Aaron the people and here's where I get
[44:16] the message now. We the people I'm
[44:20] speaking on. We the people. That's why I
[44:23] had you stand so you could give
[44:26] testimony to yourself. We the people are
[44:30] the people of Leodysa. This age of this
[44:34] age all of these things happened
[44:38] not maybe in my time of life but in the
[44:41] age.
[44:42] And God says he sent a messenger to the
[44:45] age.
[44:47] Now and then the people said to Aaron
[44:51] what's happened to this prophet we don't
[44:53] know.
[44:55] got people like that today.
[44:58] And then they said, "Make us gods." They
[45:02] they want something physical, something
[45:04] we can hang on to, something we can see
[45:06] with our eyes. So they were reverting
[45:10] back to the senses
[45:12] which God had only given them by the
[45:14] natural birth had given us senses to
[45:18] contact this world. I feel this. It
[45:21] feels like wood. I look at it. It is
[45:24] wood. as far as I can see. And so, you
[45:28] know, I look at you and I see you in the
[45:30] body that you're in. But like the
[45:33] prophet of God said, "We don't really
[45:36] see each other. You have never seen me.
[45:39] I've never seen you. The real you.
[45:43] That's the That's the one that you have
[45:46] difficulty describing.
[45:48] You you're you're able to have emotions
[45:52] in that next realm. Th this physical
[45:55] realm touches the physical world and
[45:58] that we are living in. But then there's
[46:01] another realm that's beyond that. And we
[46:04] have emotions and we have feelings that
[46:07] are
[46:09] impossible to describe.
[46:12] And then we h we we can have grief that
[46:15] goes even beyond a h human ability to to
[46:19] tell anybody. And we have feelings. Uh
[46:22] you've been married. Many of you are
[46:25] married and you you have partners, but
[46:27] you can't you can't fully describe what
[46:32] you perhaps go through or how you feel
[46:35] or the depth of your love or the depth
[46:37] of your devotion. You love the Lord. You
[46:40] come to church.
[46:42] So there has to be another place. There
[46:45] has to be another birth.
[46:48] This one
[46:50] I have a I didn't I I wasn't able to
[46:53] bring it. Anybody got an iPhone?
[46:59] Who's got an iPhone here? Nobody. You
[47:03] got one? I've got an iPad and it's got
[47:07] the Apple on front
[47:13] and the Apple's got a bite out of it.
[47:18] All the slides that I'm going to show
[47:20] you is because of the bite.
[47:28] And you and I sitting here in these
[47:31] bodies that are not getting younger, by
[47:33] tonight you'll be older, that's also
[47:36] because of the bite.
[47:42] And uh uh the the the computer that I
[47:46] have, it's it's very very useful and I
[47:49] get very frustrated if it's not working
[47:51] right. and I call brother Aaron, my hard
[47:54] disk minister, and and he fixes
[47:58] everything up or Michael, one of the
[48:01] two, and they're the IT guys, and we
[48:05] have some experts here. Uh, and so they
[48:08] get things fixed up, and then and then
[48:10] the knowledge starts flowing again. And
[48:14] I can get Wikipedia or I can find how to
[48:17] spell a word correctly or I can find a
[48:19] country or I can find a city. I can find
[48:22] people
[48:24] uh generally and so I don't want to take
[48:27] up too much time with that but uh that's
[48:29] the knowledge part of it but there's
[48:32] also a bad part of it
[48:34] &gt;&gt; there's a bad part it it it happens to
[48:36] be from a tree of good and evil
[48:41] &gt;&gt; and we all are
[48:44] experience that. So we live in a world
[48:47] there's some nice things and there's
[48:49] some advancements and so on so forth but
[48:52] you'll always find and the prophet will
[48:55] say it so clearly there's always he said
[48:58] what is science got in store for you
[49:01] more death
[49:04] &gt;&gt; that just happens to be the truth I
[49:06] don't care whether you uh agree with
[49:09] that doesn't make any difference but
[49:10] there's more death associated with it we
[49:13] got our cars out there we're happy for
[49:16] and we're going to drive home or go
[49:17] someplace and uh it's fine. But that's
[49:22] not the answer. We get into an aircraft
[49:25] as they did people in Chicago day before
[49:29] yesterday I guess it was and the right
[49:31] engine blew into flames and they all got
[49:34] out but just got out
[49:37] and the plane was going to explode if it
[49:41] got to the fuel. So anyway, there's evil
[49:44] attached with everything and in this
[49:46] body which came from the first bite
[49:50] uh which was a sexual thing. We weren't
[49:53] born in the right way. That's why you
[49:56] have to be born again. Amen.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; And I thank God that we have known more
[50:04] clearly through the messenger
[50:07] &gt;&gt; what it is to be born again,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; born of the spirit,
[50:12] born of the word. Amen.
[50:18] And in this account in in Exodus,
[50:22] the people the people rose up and said,
[50:25] "Make us gods. We don't know what's
[50:27] happened to this Moses. We don't know
[50:31] what's happened to this prophet.
[50:34] Make us make us God's. Make us something
[50:36] that we can see. So now this will be an
[50:39] answer for many of you. Just listen very
[50:42] closely. Now
[50:45] that's why even in the age of the
[50:47] message in the message churches
[50:51] I'll just call them message gatherings
[50:54] because people are not in the message
[50:57] it's the message which is Christ the
[50:59] person in the individual
[51:02] &gt;&gt; and until that happens
[51:05] it's not a message church
[51:08] &gt;&gt; but there are those that are associated
[51:10] and have associated themselves They they
[51:13] like the standards of it. They like how
[51:16] the young people are to respect their
[51:18] parents and husbands and their
[51:20] relationship with their wife and so on
[51:22] so forth. And it's just good. It's
[51:25] better class of things. And so they they
[51:28] associate themselves with it because of
[51:30] the benefits. That's not it. It's it is
[51:34] a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That is what is necessary.
[51:41] And so there are people that uh they
[51:44] they need somebody they need a person.
[51:48] They they want somebody physical or they
[51:52] want something physical and doctrines
[51:55] will maybe a brother will in the message
[51:58] and I may be uh uh I may I'm stretching
[52:02] it myself a wee bit now could be
[52:04] misunderstood but I'm I'm I want you to
[52:08] receive this.
[52:10] people get a a certain
[52:14] maybe a it's or we always attach
[52:16] revelation to it because that's a word
[52:19] nice word and we all understand it. So
[52:21] they get a revelation or they think they
[52:24] see something in the message and
[52:26] probably do
[52:28] and then voom
[52:31] it goes way off. goes spiraling way out
[52:35] of control and all kinds of doctrines to
[52:38] support of things that are happening.
[52:41] What it really is is the people of we
[52:45] the people we and Mo and and Aaron said
[52:49] to Moses, "Don't be angry with me. Don't
[52:52] let your wrath wax hot against me." He
[52:56] said, "You know, the people
[53:00] &gt;&gt; they the people are uh they wanted
[53:03] something they wanted something physical
[53:06] &gt;&gt; because they hadn't really got the
[53:09] message of God."
[53:12] &gt;&gt; And here Moses was coming down with the
[53:14] words that God had actually inscribed
[53:16] himself.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And while they were waiting, they had to
[53:21] have something physical. So there are
[53:24] men that have been in the message. They
[53:26] are I would say uh
[53:30] perhaps highly visible people.
[53:34] And I can I can speak this because right
[53:38] as of this moment I am being called
[53:41] because people are becoming I'm talking
[53:44] to you now as a family. People are
[53:46] becoming rather uh
[53:50] desperate.
[53:52] They they feel they got to have somebody
[53:55] that was with the prophet. And if we can
[53:58] just have him, he doesn't have to speak.
[54:02] Even if he's just visible here in his
[54:04] presence here. So this last week or few
[54:08] days I have had calls and incredible
[54:12] incredible pressure from Africa, Malawi,
[54:16] from Nigeria, a whole a representative
[54:19] was in Florida, the whole council of
[54:21] ministers. Please come call yesterday
[54:24] from Mexico City. Uh we're having a
[54:29] convention. It is a 60th or 70th
[54:32] anniversary of the message in Mexico
[54:35] City. We're having it at Easter and we
[54:38] want you and brother Billy Paul to come.
[54:41] Well, those are probably maybe two of
[54:45] the last remaining eyewitnesses of
[54:48] things and uh and and I told them I said
[54:52] I'm past 82. I I can't do these kind of
[54:55] long trips anymore. And it's just like I
[54:57] didn't say anything. They're just
[55:00] waiting for that and want you to pray
[55:02] about it and expect you to be there and
[55:05] so on and so forth. I'm not saying that
[55:08] it doesn't mean something. Of course, it
[55:10] means something to them. But uh there's
[55:13] a time when there was a time when
[55:15] brother Brandon left. I thought if he
[55:17] left
[55:19] everything ended.
[55:21] I thought the only thing to do would be
[55:23] to run across the country and just
[55:25] scream it's over.
[55:27] That's what I thought at that time.
[55:30] But then there was a
[55:34] uh uh Are you following me?
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Then there was a urgency.
[55:40] What about the people that don't speak
[55:42] English or speak French or speak clearly
[55:48] and don't understand what the messenger
[55:50] said? So I was gripped very very early
[55:54] when this church was in the log church
[55:56] back maybe yet in the house. People have
[55:59] to get these tapes and they have to get
[56:02] to hear what this message is all about.
[56:06] And that's what you have been busy with
[56:09] and we've been busy with all of these
[56:12] years.
[56:15] But when Moses said to Aaron,
[56:19] "What did you do?" He said, "Well, the
[56:21] people are given over to mischief
[56:25] and that's and and then when they were
[56:28] eating and drinking and that, you know,
[56:30] they're having fellowship and hilarity
[56:32] and and it was almost a mocking sort of
[56:36] thing. That's what it finally reduced
[56:38] down to." And they were kind of mocking,
[56:41] I guess, their own conviction. I don't
[56:42] know. And the and the Bible says that
[56:45] they were made naked. They, in other
[56:47] words, they didn't have any leadership
[56:49] anymore. No one had actually led them
[56:51] into that. He said, so Aaron said, "So I
[56:54] just told them to break off the earrings
[56:56] and things." In other words, they had
[56:59] the substance to make God very angry.
[57:03] They had that potential. And they broke
[57:07] off their earrings. And Aaron says one
[57:09] place, it says one place in chapter 32
[57:13] that he graved the the molten calf. Then
[57:18] it says uh and Aaron was repeating he
[57:22] said and so the I told the people break
[57:24] off the earrings and they threw the
[57:26] earrings into the fire and out came this
[57:29] calf. He couldn't really tell how it
[57:32] developed and that's exactly what
[57:34] happens. There's doctrines that have
[57:37] swept into the message. You heard them.
[57:41] Maybe some of you been touched by it.
[57:44] I've studied them. I've studied most of
[57:46] them because I I didn't want to I I'm
[57:49] listening to and being influenced by
[57:51] what the prophet of God says. And he
[57:54] says that error can be 99% true. So I am
[57:59] desiring to know the truth. But I want
[58:01] to know if they stayed with what the
[58:04] messenger said.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And then some perhaps go in a fanatical
[58:11] way of every last, you know, every last
[58:15] word. And if he made a mistake or he
[58:17] said seven thou 700 instead of 7,000 or
[58:21] he said something, oh that's somehow it
[58:26] just does away with the message. What
[58:28] nonsense?
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Because I stutter or fumble around. And
[58:34] brother Brandham's a human.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; He He's got a He's got a human body that
[58:39] wears out.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; He's got a human body that he pulled
[58:43] back from the ministry
[58:45] &gt;&gt; for a season.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; You understand? People have certain
[58:49] convictions.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; He said, "If we have a meeting and we're
[58:53] not able to pay for it, then we just
[58:54] stop."
[58:56] Well, you might say, "Well, where was
[58:58] this faith?" And God is going to provide
[59:01] if the message is from God. You know,
[59:04] you can't figure God out.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody here can figure God out. And one
[59:11] thing that people make a huge error in
[59:13] this day, and I've they've done it right
[59:16] in this church, and that is that they
[59:18] try to put a timeless God into a time
[59:22] slot.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; You can't do that. The message, the
[59:26] message when it comes from God, the
[59:29] message,
[59:32] it can't be put into just a 24hour time
[59:35] frame.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[59:39] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:41] What I want you to see now in the next
[59:43] few moments
[59:45] is the events.
[59:48] And I want you to absorb the events.
[59:51] These are some of them are catastrophic.
[59:57] Some of them are still have hang over
[1:00:00] the world with
[1:00:03] a a
[1:00:05] just a
[1:00:08] heavy heavy atmosphere
[1:00:12] because there are even things we don't
[1:00:14] want to remember. You might as well
[1:00:15] remember them is your age. That's why
[1:00:18] you stood up.
[1:00:21] So he said that the age
[1:00:25] uh
[1:00:28] started about 1906.
[1:00:33] Now by 1914,
[1:00:36] here's what's going on. They're marching
[1:00:38] in the streets.
[1:00:40] Then they're in the trenches.
[1:00:43] This the first world war. In fact, this
[1:00:46] let's put it in the messengers language.
[1:00:48] This is the first birth pain.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. and they had gas
[1:00:55] and then they went to the trenches
[1:01:00] and my wife's daddy,
[1:01:03] my father-in-law, was in these trenches
[1:01:06] and we went to them on Vimeie Ridge. If
[1:01:10] you ever go
[1:01:12] get over to Belgium and
[1:01:16] in France and that area,
[1:01:19] you want to see Vimemy Ridge.
[1:01:22] They have about a 100 ft statue of a
[1:01:26] mother
[1:01:28] and she's looking over the valley
[1:01:32] and in the trenches. And we went into
[1:01:34] the trenches
[1:01:36] and the Canadians at that at that one
[1:01:39] point and the Americans were in another
[1:01:41] area and the Canadians were fighting
[1:01:45] there and the Germans
[1:01:47] 30 40 yards apart
[1:01:50] yards meters
[1:01:53] and sometimes only gain a few meters in
[1:01:55] a day. and they've left the soil how it
[1:01:59] was bombed and it was just craters
[1:02:03] everywhere
[1:02:06] and uh the German troops were very well
[1:02:08] fortified.
[1:02:11] In fact is I had a lot of respect for
[1:02:13] one German comedant who sent a man out
[1:02:17] of their trenches. They're looking at
[1:02:19] each other. sent a man out of their
[1:02:21] trenches with a white flag
[1:02:24] and came to the Canadian trench and
[1:02:27] said, "May I see your common dant?"
[1:02:32] And he said, "My common dant says, we
[1:02:36] shall have a truce. You have so many men
[1:02:40] that are wounded and also killed in
[1:02:43] between the trenches." just maybe maybe
[1:02:47] 50 60 70 up to 100 meters. And he said,
[1:02:51] "We will cease fighting
[1:02:54] for uh for a day and we'll help you
[1:02:58] bring your men back." And so they all
[1:03:01] worked together, the Canadian troops and
[1:03:04] the US troops, I should say, the
[1:03:06] Canadian troops and the German troops in
[1:03:08] this case. And they helped carry the men
[1:03:11] back to
[1:03:14] the Canadian trenches so they could get
[1:03:18] first aid and hospitals and etc. And the
[1:03:21] trenches were sometimes two and three
[1:03:24] stories deep. They had hospitals and
[1:03:27] kitchens and food and everything in
[1:03:29] there.
[1:03:30] And it was really a a bitter bitter
[1:03:33] bitter and uh something that we don't
[1:03:37] like. We have all our letters from my
[1:03:39] father-in-law that he was writing home.
[1:03:43] So we've been close to that. We've been
[1:03:46] touched. We're in this Leodysian age.
[1:03:47] This is an event that happened started
[1:03:49] in 1914, ended four years later or five
[1:03:53] right at the end of uh 1918.
[1:03:58] And this statue that they have is on a
[1:04:01] white marble.
[1:04:03] They said it's the only marble that
[1:04:05] there is no more marble like that. And a
[1:04:09] Toronto uh architecture
[1:04:12] uh sculpture I should say from Toronto.
[1:04:16] And I stood beside that woman. She's
[1:04:18] about 100 ft in the air.
[1:04:21] And her she draped with a cloak. She's
[1:04:24] holding a bouquet of flowers and they're
[1:04:27] just hanging down by her side and she's
[1:04:30] looking like this down over where her
[1:04:34] sons have given their lives.
[1:04:38] That's a part of our history. You think,
[1:04:40] "Oh, that's a long time." No, it's not
[1:04:42] very long ago.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You've got people here.
[1:04:49] I might say some things, which I will.
[1:04:52] My wife,
[1:04:55] the mother of my daughters
[1:04:58] and a spiritual mother to many of you,
[1:05:02] she always wondered about,
[1:05:06] I shouldn't say always wondered, but at
[1:05:08] certain times wondered about not her
[1:05:11] salvation, but when the prophet of God
[1:05:14] says, "You're a gene of God."
[1:05:17] And I, as her husband, I felt so
[1:05:20] impressed to preach that. And I stayed
[1:05:23] on that subject.
[1:05:26] And one day she said to me after the
[1:05:29] service,
[1:05:31] I got it.
[1:05:33] It's over. And she realized, she said, I
[1:05:36] realized that my father
[1:05:39] when he had his comrades and his
[1:05:41] colleagues and his buddies dropping
[1:05:44] beside him, she said, "And he would walk
[1:05:49] out. He was wounded, but he walked out.
[1:05:52] She said, "He could not perish because I
[1:05:55] was still in him."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you friends,
[1:06:00] an experience like that helps you
[1:06:03] realize the reality
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; of a prophet saying, "And we needed that
[1:06:08] message.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Needed somebody to come and say, as you
[1:06:12] were in the loins of your father,
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; so were you in the loins of God.
[1:06:19] That's not some poetic license. That's
[1:06:22] not just some fancy words. That's the
[1:06:24] truth.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; You're in the loins of God.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; And a seed from God came out to give you
[1:06:31] a new birth.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; You had a new birth, but you discovered
[1:06:34] it. And so, and so it was. And so, they
[1:06:39] go from the trenches
[1:06:42] to some of the wounded.
[1:06:44] And the war was over. And now the
[1:06:46] depression starts.
[1:06:49] I'm sorry. Uh
[1:06:55] then yeah, we got somehow
[1:06:58] uh then the roaring 20s came and then
[1:07:01] the collapse in 1929 and then starts the
[1:07:06] depression. This is a school. All of you
[1:07:09] in that are in school, there's a teacher
[1:07:11] there
[1:07:14] and uh a mother in the kitchen.
[1:07:19] uh lined up to get some soup.
[1:07:24] My father-in-law
[1:07:27] sold entire
[1:07:29] entire hay racks of hay
[1:07:33] or I should say he bought entire hay
[1:07:36] racks of hay for 50 cents and didn't
[1:07:40] have the 50 cents to pay for it. And I
[1:07:43] met the people that sold it to him and
[1:07:45] they said, "So we waited till he could
[1:07:48] pay it.
[1:07:52] That's our world.
[1:07:54] Well, you got money in your pocket.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; That money may not be worth very much.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; You can have an absolute collapse.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; And there are people who are smart
[1:08:06] people who are predicting that. I'm not
[1:08:08] predicting it. I'm not here to predict
[1:08:10] that. I'm not here as a politician, but
[1:08:13] this is this is the real world. They
[1:08:15] lined up. I think this was in Chicago or
[1:08:18] someplace.
[1:08:20] And then
[1:08:22] the
[1:08:24] during this time they're trying to find
[1:08:27] work.
[1:08:29] So they have the only way they couldn't
[1:08:31] buy gas and didn't have cars. And so
[1:08:34] they're hitching rides on the railway.
[1:08:38] There's a couple there.
[1:08:41] Why can't you give my dad a job?
[1:08:44] Boy sang because there isn't work
[1:08:47] either.
[1:08:53] Then the dust storms,
[1:08:56] incredible dust storms
[1:08:58] after all of this uh or during all of
[1:09:03] these things and then the commencement
[1:09:04] of World War II.
[1:09:07] And here, this actually was a dust
[1:09:09] storm. I want to get it before that.
[1:09:12] That's one of the dust storms coming.
[1:09:14] And this is another dust storm. It
[1:09:17] literally blew
[1:09:19] the soil that could bear a crop, blew it
[1:09:23] off.
[1:09:27] I know with those kind of winds, you
[1:09:30] think God knew anything about it? They
[1:09:33] couldn't grow things and they didn't
[1:09:35] have seed and they didn't have anything
[1:09:37] to eat. And those were tough times. And
[1:09:41] now I come to my time. I stood and
[1:09:44] watched my father, my dad, cuz he want
[1:09:48] had two children to feed and a wife. And
[1:09:51] he's peeling ties that are under the
[1:09:55] railway for 10 cents a tie. But he was
[1:09:58] happy to have work. And then he got
[1:10:01] work. That's the only two jobs I know
[1:10:03] that he had. He had the second job was
[1:10:06] in an alalfa plant cleaning the bags and
[1:10:09] made enough to so we could eat
[1:10:14] and then
[1:10:16] would start the second world war.
[1:10:25] There's a load of US troops
[1:10:29] there. They are heading for the beaches.
[1:10:35] This is some of the cities that have
[1:10:37] been bombed out.
[1:10:40] Now we're This is La Le Oia.
[1:10:45] And technologies advancing.
[1:10:47] They've gone from gas to be able to make
[1:10:51] bombs and larger bombs and larger bombs
[1:10:56] until they have a cloud.
[1:11:00] And that is part of it all well as well
[1:11:03] taken from the ground and that's what
[1:11:06] was left the next morning.
[1:11:13] There's a man surveying it.
[1:11:20] And there's two US officers
[1:11:23] at uh maybe Flanders Fields.
[1:11:31] That's a different kind of a cloud.
[1:11:39] And when they were there,
[1:11:41] I'm going to just show you some clips
[1:11:46] slides.
[1:11:48] Now, you need to see this. If you
[1:11:50] haven't seen it, you need to see it. You
[1:11:53] need to see it in relationship to a
[1:11:55] message.
[1:11:57] Message I'm looking down into your faces
[1:11:59] that God sent you
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; and he allowed this to happen for a
[1:12:04] certain reason.
[1:12:06] And during this time
[1:12:09] when these people were suffering this
[1:12:12] incredible,
[1:12:14] who's going to describe this?
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Who's going to say what's in that man's
[1:12:19] heart?
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It's a real person.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Got feelings like you, like me, maybe
[1:12:26] had a family. I don't know. I don't know
[1:12:29] anything about it.
[1:12:33] But at this time they were far too
[1:12:36] gruesome and I wouldn't show you. I have
[1:12:40] I have a volumes of the books that
[1:12:43] detailed the building of the
[1:12:47] concentration camps.
[1:12:52] And I never heard and neither did you
[1:12:56] hear any person say
[1:13:00] when millions of people
[1:13:03] were going to the gas chambers
[1:13:06] to have a man stand an intelligent man
[1:13:10] stand behind the pulpit and say it was
[1:13:13] the hand gracious hand of Jehovah.
[1:13:19] How could you say that?
[1:13:24] I personally
[1:13:27] was in a I can't say a state of shock,
[1:13:29] but my mind couldn't work around it. The
[1:13:32] tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:13:37] Listen folks, this is your message. This
[1:13:41] is a letter, a letter been sent from
[1:13:44] God. Hear what the spirit says
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:13:59] How can you go through
[1:14:01] Ashwitz for example which I have
[1:14:05] and stand in front of the crematorium.
[1:14:11] Forget about the people or putting blame
[1:14:14] anywhere.
[1:14:16] And I said to
[1:14:19] uh Gishon Solomon that had spoke here,
[1:14:23] drove him to the ABC
[1:14:27] motel down the street and his wife is
[1:14:30] just opening the door to the motel and
[1:14:33] I'm still sitting with him in the car
[1:14:35] and I'm talking to him about God sent us
[1:14:38] a prophet. I had already told him that I
[1:14:41] guess but I was saying you know our
[1:14:44] prophet
[1:14:46] said when you people
[1:14:50] when your nation was going through it
[1:14:53] wasn't a nation yet was going through
[1:14:55] the Holocaust
[1:14:58] and the Jews were being slain
[1:15:02] literally slaughtered genocide by the
[1:15:06] tens of thousands and hundreds of
[1:15:08] thousands until your mind cannot grasp
[1:15:11] it anymore. I said, "Our prophet said it
[1:15:13] was a tender hand of Jehovah."
[1:15:17] And he just looked down at the glove box
[1:15:22] and he said, "It's something that my
[1:15:24] wife," and I just looked out the window
[1:15:25] and she was opening the door, glass
[1:15:27] door. She said, "It's something that's
[1:15:30] so hard for her." Said, "It's so hard
[1:15:33] for her." I said, "And our prophet said
[1:15:36] it was the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:15:39] because it was driving you back
[1:15:44] to Israel and God cannot bless the Jew
[1:15:48] outside of Israel." And he just said,
[1:15:50] "That is right."
[1:15:54] Listen friends,
[1:15:57] if you want to if you want to hear it,
[1:16:01] it's it's a it's one of the stronger
[1:16:04] messages. I will say recognizing your
[1:16:07] day
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; in its message.
[1:16:10] I'm saying what I'm saying today and
[1:16:13] showing the slides that I am to say this
[1:16:15] all happened in Leodya.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; This all happened.
[1:16:22] under the message message that the
[1:16:25] messenger which was sent to our time and
[1:16:28] the people of this time and we've got to
[1:16:31] do more than just go to a church that we
[1:16:35] identify as a message church. That's not
[1:16:39] the point.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; The the purpose of this church is to see
[1:16:43] that you get the person this the word
[1:16:48] was made flesh again.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The message came in such a way it's not
[1:16:53] a bunch of words like you hear
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; at some other church. Is this different?
[1:17:00] Absolutely different. Not because I'm
[1:17:03] saying it because because we have been
[1:17:06] sent a message and we take it as a
[1:17:08] personal responsibility.
[1:17:13] Are you with me?
[1:17:22] And during this time
[1:17:26] then happens another type of cloud and
[1:17:30] another type of cloud
[1:17:33] that is all making reference to a
[1:17:36] message.
[1:17:38] In fact, is I was with brother Brandham
[1:17:40] when he talked about this pillar of fire
[1:17:42] coming into this auditorium at the arena
[1:17:46] at the Sam Houston, Texas in Houston,
[1:17:50] Texas. He was relating that and he was
[1:17:54] up in the balcony. He didn't want to
[1:17:56] come down. He didn't want to be part of
[1:17:58] the uh debate.
[1:18:01] And uh brother,
[1:18:04] what's his name?
[1:18:09] the tall brother that was with him all
[1:18:10] the time
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; that took the debate.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Bossworth.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Bosworth. Brother Bosworth.
[1:18:20] Brother Bosworth said to brother
[1:18:22] Brandham, "I would like to take the
[1:18:24] debate." And he didn't want. He said,
[1:18:26] "As long as there's no debate about the
[1:18:28] scriptures as such." No. No. He said,
[1:18:31] "There won't." He had another plan.
[1:18:34] Brother Brandham said he was up in the
[1:18:36] balcony and he said he just felt like a
[1:18:38] little voice, a little urge to go down
[1:18:43] because the debate was over in a in a
[1:18:45] few minutes.
[1:18:49] And the debate was over because of this.
[1:18:53] Are you all listening now? Don't be
[1:18:55] distracted.
[1:18:57] Brother Bosworth said to Reverend Best,
[1:19:01] the Baptist minister, "You can go
[1:19:04] first." No, no, he says, "You go first."
[1:19:07] Because the one who goes first doesn't
[1:19:10] get the last last 10 minutes to speak.
[1:19:14] So, I think it was 10 minutes. So,
[1:19:16] Brother Bosworth got up and he said, "I
[1:19:18] have one question I would like to ask
[1:19:21] Reverend Best.
[1:19:23] I'd like him to answer it yes or no.
[1:19:28] The question was, is the seven
[1:19:30] redemptive names of Jehovah in the Old
[1:19:34] Testament, does it refer to Jesus
[1:19:38] Christ? Yes or no? If he said no, it
[1:19:42] would mean that he was not Jehovah's
[1:19:44] savior.
[1:19:46] If he said yes, it would mean that he
[1:19:48] also was Jehovah Rapha, Jehovah healer.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; And he said he couldn't answer it. and
[1:19:55] the and the committee handed the debate
[1:19:58] down to brother Bosworth and that caused
[1:20:02] some strife and trouble there and that's
[1:20:05] where the picture was taken and brother
[1:20:08] Brandham said he felt a little voice
[1:20:11] just say urging him because the people
[1:20:14] had come for a meeting and the whole
[1:20:16] service was over
[1:20:19] and so he went down
[1:20:22] and he went up the steps and and he's
[1:20:25] standing at the pulpit. In fact, is I'm
[1:20:28] sorry you don't see all of the picture
[1:20:30] because brother Brandham actually is
[1:20:32] holding a small piece of paper,
[1:20:36] very small piece of paper in his hand.
[1:20:39] It is just a little piece of white paper
[1:20:43] and it's about
[1:20:47] about this size
[1:20:51] and he's holding in his hand like this.
[1:20:55] And he said, "It is true."
[1:20:58] Brother Bam said to me, he said, he was
[1:21:00] saying to the people, "It is true that
[1:21:02] an angel from God
[1:21:05] did speak to me." He was just referring
[1:21:08] to the angel. And then he said, "Just a
[1:21:12] moment,
[1:21:13] he of whom I speak
[1:21:16] is now here."
[1:21:19] And this light moved down the audience
[1:21:24] and came and hung where you see it
[1:21:26] there. And it was Reverend Best's
[1:21:30] photographer
[1:21:32] who he had had come because he said, "I
[1:21:35] want you to take my picture when I have
[1:21:38] my finger at William Brandham's nose in
[1:21:40] front of his nose in front of his face
[1:21:43] declaring him a fraud."
[1:21:45] And it was his photo photographer
[1:21:48] photographer rather that took this
[1:21:50] picture. And that's why this picture
[1:21:53] went to George J. G. Lacy or George J.
[1:21:56] Lacy for examination.
[1:22:03] That's the kind of cloud I want to
[1:22:05] follow.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; This cloud did not come to bring death.
[1:22:13] Came to bring life.
[1:22:15] This didn't come to injure people. Came
[1:22:18] to heal people.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that health thee.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; That's the cloud.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Now, you that are high-tech people,
[1:22:29] one thing that you do get and you that
[1:22:32] aren't high-tech,
[1:22:34] you get upgrades
[1:22:36] all the time. I said, "When will
[1:22:39] Microsoft end upgrading? When will these
[1:22:42] people ever end up upgrading? I got
[1:22:45] reams of upgrades.
[1:22:47] And then my uh computer, you need to
[1:22:50] restart it and reboot it.
[1:22:55] This word has been here a long time.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; And God never had to upgrade it.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Not one time.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Back in the beginning, the tithing was
[1:23:06] 10%.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; It's still 10%.
[1:23:12] That's right.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Can't the people say
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, you're just excited,
[1:23:20] Brother Biscuit." You better get
[1:23:22] excited.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; This is probably the most glorious thing
[1:23:27] that ever has happened.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Got a book that never needed to be
[1:23:32] upgraded.
[1:23:43] And while this was taking place,
[1:23:46] the Jews were returning. The tender hand
[1:23:50] of Jehovah in motion.
[1:23:53] Incidentally, that's a Hagena ship. That
[1:23:57] was one of the kind of the renegade
[1:24:01] uh groups, breakaway groups. And there's
[1:24:05] another boat. They got stopped by the
[1:24:08] British and sent to Cyprus
[1:24:12] after all of the suffering,
[1:24:15] all of the incredible suffering
[1:24:19] and lost their homes and lost their
[1:24:21] possessions, lost everything.
[1:24:25] Rings on their finger and their clothes
[1:24:28] and hair, toothbrushes,
[1:24:32] combs. dehumanized
[1:24:34] and scentlike. And the prophet said
[1:24:39] in recognizing your day in this message,
[1:24:43] he said they
[1:24:46] drove, they were driven back. They were
[1:24:49] herded back. The wolves the wolves
[1:24:53] chased them. The wolves tore at them and
[1:24:58] chased them until they established their
[1:25:01] own to the protection of their own land,
[1:25:04] their own country.
[1:25:10] Here they're pulling them
[1:25:16] to shore in the water.
[1:25:19] They walked. This is over the Alp
[1:25:22] Mountains. walking from Europe to
[1:25:26] Israel.
[1:25:28] Tell you what, friends,
[1:25:32] I wish that there was more of that
[1:25:34] spirit driving
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; us with that kind of urgency to church.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; God sent me a message.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I have a chance to go to church and hear
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; something of what he said.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, my car won't work. Or come on,
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to climb over the Alps.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to walk through the snow.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to do whatever I need to do.
[1:26:06] I'm going to hear what the messenger
[1:26:08] said. Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And they walked
[1:26:15] and I thought they're still in their
[1:26:18] concentration prison guard
[1:26:21] and one is uh I guess
[1:26:25] not washing his feet but soaking them.
[1:26:36] Israel has become a nation. itself. The
[1:26:40] oldest nation in the world, the oldest
[1:26:42] flag in the world has their own nation,
[1:26:46] their own flag, their own army, their
[1:26:49] own money and everything else. The mis
[1:26:53] mysterious of how that bunch of Jews
[1:26:56] persecuted everywhere and turned out and
[1:27:00] run out and thrown out like the church
[1:27:02] down through these ages of rejection.
[1:27:05] And yet Jesus said, "When you see the
[1:27:08] fig tree putting forth its buds, that
[1:27:12] nation returning back to be a nation
[1:27:15] again, the time is at hand, even at the
[1:27:19] door."
[1:27:21] Israel is already a nation. She is
[1:27:23] established now with her armies, navy,
[1:27:26] postal system, flag, and all that
[1:27:29] pertains to nationhood. But there's
[1:27:31] still to be uh fulfill the scripture
[1:27:34] that says a or shall a nation be born at
[1:27:39] once. Isaiah 66 and8 that day is coming
[1:27:43] soon. The fig tree has put forth her
[1:27:46] buds. The Israelites are waiting for the
[1:27:48] Messiah. They are expecting him and
[1:27:52] their expectation are about to be
[1:27:54] fulfilled. Israel be reborn spiritually
[1:27:58] for her light and her life are about to
[1:28:01] be revealed to her.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; He said though through Hosea I have
[1:28:08] heeded. Now watch Israel he's talking to
[1:28:13] I have heed or in other words I have
[1:28:16] chopped chopped them out through the
[1:28:18] prophets. That's how God does his
[1:28:21] people. He chopped them out from the
[1:28:23] rest of the nations. What? By his
[1:28:26] two-edged sword, his word. He chopped
[1:28:29] them. His nation from the nations. He
[1:28:33] chopped his nation from the nations. By
[1:28:35] the prophets, his vindicated word. So
[1:28:39] has he chopped his bride from the
[1:28:41] denominations?
[1:28:43] By his word promised by Malachi 4. in
[1:28:47] the last day chopped out his bride,
[1:28:50] hewed her from the rest of the churches,
[1:28:53] hewed out his bride. This is where some
[1:28:56] people maybe I don't know if you're here
[1:29:00] this chopping.
[1:29:02] God is not
[1:29:05] he was not
[1:29:09] slack
[1:29:11] in hewing his people.
[1:29:15] There was a man I spoke to in Israel.
[1:29:20] His name was
[1:29:22] Hama,
[1:29:24] I believe it was.
[1:29:27] He was the originator of a kibuts.
[1:29:32] And I said, "Kaman," that was his name.
[1:29:35] And I said, "How how is it that you came
[1:29:38] here to Israel?" He said it was 1939
[1:29:42] be just before the war just as it
[1:29:44] started. He said and my father I was one
[1:29:47] of four sons.
[1:29:49] My father had a successful tailoring
[1:29:52] business. And he said and I was the
[1:29:55] eldest son. The tailoring business would
[1:29:58] fall to me. But he said something within
[1:30:01] me was sending me back here to Israel.
[1:30:05] And I I have come back here and became
[1:30:08] one of the originators of this caboots
[1:30:11] in uh in in Galilee. And we stayed there
[1:30:16] actually and I got to know him and we
[1:30:19] went and he showed me the dairy, showed
[1:30:21] me the farm, showed me the the whole
[1:30:23] kabuts and the children and the school
[1:30:26] and so on. And I was I was uh quite
[1:30:29] affected by it. And I had a little bit
[1:30:31] of a debate uh with him about it because
[1:30:34] I thought that maybe we treated our
[1:30:36] children better. And uh before I was
[1:30:39] done talking to him, I can see they
[1:30:42] spend more time with their children than
[1:30:45] the parents do in this day and age with
[1:30:48] their children. And uh
[1:30:52] I was I was really quite affected by it.
[1:30:55] So he said, "And and then we have been
[1:30:57] chopped out."
[1:31:00] If you ever are inclined to think
[1:31:05] that this message has caused you to
[1:31:08] suffer,
[1:31:09] I say think it again.
[1:31:15] If you think that maybe a a code of
[1:31:19] dress
[1:31:21] or a code of living or anything, I just
[1:31:24] want to say to this church, there's
[1:31:27] nobody here that is really suffering.
[1:31:31] The kind of suffering
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about suffering.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; You haven't lost family. You haven't
[1:31:37] lost friends. You haven't lost, you
[1:31:39] know, God is good.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And however he feels to do things,
[1:31:46] we say yes.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; His way is the right way.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:32:06] and since that time
[1:32:10] since that time but I I would like you
[1:32:13] to just see if you'd see the continuity
[1:32:16] God taking the natural church Israel the
[1:32:20] natural the natural nation and the
[1:32:23] spiritual sending a message to a group
[1:32:26] of people to chop them out.
[1:32:30] Chop them out from wherever they were.
[1:32:33] And God could not be handle you with kid
[1:32:37] gloves.
[1:32:38] Some of you have come from very very
[1:32:40] distant places and I don't want to even
[1:32:43] enter into a personal personal testimony
[1:32:48] but I stand here as a witness to this
[1:32:50] message.
[1:32:52] I have not known what it is to have a
[1:32:54] bedroom of my own or a room of my own.
[1:32:58] I've not known that
[1:33:01] I lost my mother when I was 6 and 1/2, 7
[1:33:04] years old and moved and moved and moved
[1:33:08] and lived in camps and lived in other
[1:33:12] people's homes and was more like a
[1:33:15] native person just drifting from one
[1:33:17] camp to another, one place to another.
[1:33:23] I can tell you one thing. God's way is
[1:33:28] perfect.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't trade it for anything.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; You could be brought up in a king's
[1:33:37] palace and that would be perfectly fine.
[1:33:41] You could have little or nothing and
[1:33:45] that would be perfectly fine. You could
[1:33:47] have abundance of material things and
[1:33:50] that would be fine. But I want to I want
[1:33:54] to uh just say to you,
[1:34:00] do we have a few minutes?
[1:34:12] I have just a a few quotes that tie into
[1:34:17] everything that I've shown thus far
[1:34:20] in the in the message invisible union.
[1:34:25] Brother Bram talked about the pilgrim
[1:34:27] fathers
[1:34:32] and I have a question that I want you to
[1:34:35] be able to go home with.
[1:34:39] the US Constitution.
[1:34:42] Now, to our beloved American
[1:34:46] brothers and sisters,
[1:34:51] their constitution starts out, we the
[1:34:54] people,
[1:34:55] and that's why I use that as a title.
[1:35:00] We the people
[1:35:02] of the United States
[1:35:04] in order to form a more perfect union,
[1:35:09] establish justice,
[1:35:12] ensure
[1:35:14] uh domestic tranquility,
[1:35:18] provide for the common defense,
[1:35:22] promote the general welfare,
[1:35:25] and secure the blessings of liberty to
[1:35:29] ourselves and our prosperity, our
[1:35:32] posterity
[1:35:34] to ordain and establish this
[1:35:37] constitution
[1:35:38] for the United States of America.
[1:35:42] That's their constitution.
[1:35:46] And then uh in uh I think the
[1:35:49] Declaration of Independence
[1:35:52] starts out in the name of God.
[1:35:56] Amen.
[1:35:58] And then starts the preamble
[1:36:03] and the preamble to the US Declaration
[1:36:06] of Independence in 1776.
[1:36:10] We hold there we hold these truths to be
[1:36:15] self-evident
[1:36:17] that all men are created equal
[1:36:20] and they are endowed
[1:36:24] they are endowed by their creator
[1:36:27] with certain inalienable rights
[1:36:31] that among these are life, liberty and
[1:36:35] the pursuit of happiness.
[1:36:42] How did we get here?
[1:36:45] How do we get where we are?
[1:36:50] I listened to some of the earlier
[1:36:52] messages
[1:36:57] and we need
[1:36:59] the very spirit of God
[1:37:02] that forced and drove that messenger
[1:37:06] with uh tirelessly
[1:37:11] to bring a rugged message.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; And it is to give birth to a rugged
[1:37:17] people. Amen.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; We're not wishy-washy.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; We do not have to have our bread
[1:37:24] buttered for us.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; God has something that is worthwhile in
[1:37:32] this life.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And it's not this, you know, just come
[1:37:38] breath go breath and if it doesn't
[1:37:40] happen and if we don't just have
[1:37:42] everything just right.
[1:37:45] That's why I have a lot of respect
[1:37:47] personally
[1:37:49] for
[1:37:52] many of our African people
[1:37:55] because some of you have come out of
[1:37:57] great suffering.
[1:38:01] We do not want to be diluted.
[1:38:06] We don't want to be reduced.
[1:38:10] When I see the message and I hear the
[1:38:13] messenger crying out as he does and
[1:38:15] recognizing your day and your message
[1:38:19] and he cries out and I know it's in the
[1:38:21] scripture,
[1:38:24] the Holy Spirit is commissioning John,
[1:38:28] write this letter to the messenger.
[1:38:33] And I even almost cringed
[1:38:37] because he's screaming at the top of his
[1:38:39] lungs, you are blind.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; You are naked.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; I just thought I was listening to it
[1:38:48] last night again. I thought, who can
[1:38:51] hear that?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; We the people who are predestinated,
[1:38:58] we can hear it.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; We the people. There's another we the
[1:39:02] people and that's those that are
[1:39:05] ordained to eternal life
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; and to this word.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; We're not ordained to a church.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; We're not ordained to Cloverdale Bible
[1:39:15] way.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; We're ordained to eternal life.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; We are the Exodus people.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; He spoke of the Exodus people. We are
[1:39:28] the people.
[1:39:31] How did we the people
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; do we have to have soft benches or
[1:39:38] it's too hot, it's too cold, or
[1:39:42] it's not quite bright enough or the
[1:39:44] lights are too bright or
[1:39:47] where are we?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; You people are going to be happy that I
[1:39:55] only preach once in a while.
[1:40:01] But I can tell you this message came to
[1:40:04] foster.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; A bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; To foster and bring forth a virgin
[1:40:12] bride. Do you know that this that these
[1:40:15] words are strong enough the messenger's
[1:40:17] words because they were not his words.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; It's thus saith the Lord.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that thus sayaith the Lord
[1:40:26] said
[1:40:28] it's not him saying he doesn't have the
[1:40:31] power to say you never did it in the
[1:40:33] first place.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; You just learn those things. You hear
[1:40:36] them and we become accustomed to them.
[1:40:38] You can't you can't just receive those
[1:40:41] things. A man can't say it.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; But when God says it,
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; you're not just forgiven.
[1:40:52] When you have a father, an eternal
[1:40:54] father, a heavenly father that says,
[1:40:57] "I'll annihilate your sin."
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I tell that's the kind of cloud I want
[1:41:04] to hear from.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of cloud I want to be
[1:41:08] left with.
[1:41:14] And he says uh
[1:41:16] the pilgrim fathers were very thankful
[1:41:19] for their new found way of life being
[1:41:23] separated from the old English
[1:41:25] denominations and creed. They could
[1:41:28] marry to the new anointed word.
[1:41:34] They could marry to the new I want you
[1:41:37] to think about that. marry to the new
[1:41:40] anointed word.
[1:41:43] For their age. That's right.
[1:41:46] The new anointed word for their age.
[1:41:51] The reason I spoke like this to you
[1:41:53] today is that I had you stand so you'd
[1:41:57] give testimony to yourself.
[1:42:01] I'm an individual
[1:42:04] who this message has been sent to.
[1:42:09] And I am here called of God to repeat
[1:42:12] that to you.
[1:42:14] Not to fluff it, not to
[1:42:18] make it more palatable, but to let you
[1:42:21] know that this is your only way out of
[1:42:25] this age.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; This is your only way that you will get
[1:42:30] from here to the other side.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; We don't want to die like dogs. We don't
[1:42:36] want to die. And they think of those
[1:42:38] people that went to the crematorium and
[1:42:40] then you have a prophet stand up and say
[1:42:43] every one of them received white robes.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; They didn't even know it.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Just think of it.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, friends, what I'm saying
[1:42:57] to you, either this message is true or
[1:43:00] it is the wildest nightmare you could
[1:43:03] possibly think of. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Give me another man that will save 10
[1:43:08] million Jews going to the gas chambers
[1:43:12] and have him stand up and say this is
[1:43:15] the tender hand of Jehovah.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; You have to you have to account for
[1:43:21] that.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; That is the message of your messenger
[1:43:26] declared.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't invent those things. And if it
[1:43:30] wasn't from the spirit of God, if it
[1:43:32] wasn't from God Almighty driving his
[1:43:35] people back to their homeland, to the
[1:43:38] safety of their homeland, and at the
[1:43:40] same time,
[1:43:42] simultaneously,
[1:43:44] the message that says those things is
[1:43:48] coming to another group of people. We
[1:43:50] just come out of the war. Oh, we've come
[1:43:53] into and he talks about it himself. And
[1:43:56] I I've got the quote here. I don't know
[1:43:57] if I can even find it. And and some are
[1:44:00] being married to the new word for the
[1:44:04] age.
[1:44:06] You girls that have a desire to marry
[1:44:09] and you young men who have a desire to
[1:44:11] marry, you have no desire like the
[1:44:14] people who hear this message say, "I
[1:44:17] must be united with that word."
[1:44:22] I don't want to just go and hear a
[1:44:24] preacher preach and tickle my ears. I
[1:44:27] want to be united. I must have that come
[1:44:30] into me.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; I must come. I must become one with him.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; I feel like asking you to forgive me,
[1:44:42] but on the other hand, I don't feel like
[1:44:44] asking you to forgive me. This church
[1:44:46] and the bride of Jesus Christ needs to
[1:44:49] hear these things. We need to be chopped
[1:44:52] out of where we are by the two-edged
[1:44:54] sword of the word of God and united,
[1:44:58] reunited in a marriage union with Jesus
[1:45:01] Christ himself, the person,
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; so they could marry the new anointed
[1:45:08] word for their age. a new anointed word
[1:45:11] for their age,
[1:45:13] for their day.
[1:45:15] So can we be thankful as pilgrims
[1:45:19] like Abraham
[1:45:21] separated ourself from the things of the
[1:45:24] world? All of our associates,
[1:45:28] Abraham was a pilgrim. I'm calling you
[1:45:32] to this pilgrimage.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Hello, church. I'm calling you to this
[1:45:39] pilgrimage.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; There are certain ones
[1:45:54] that I thought of this morning
[1:45:57] and I'm glad you're here.
[1:46:05] How did we get here?
[1:46:10] Are we just going to sit back and let
[1:46:16] Satan
[1:46:20] come in with whatever you know he he's
[1:46:23] Listen friends, he's a slicker.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; And if you think for a minute
[1:46:30] that you can outwit him, you're sunk.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; You'll never outwit him. He'll use more
[1:46:37] regulations
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; and more laws
[1:46:42] and things. He'll use the economics.
[1:46:44] He'll use whatever.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want to divulge things.
[1:46:50] But you realize
[1:46:54] regulations and laws that have just been
[1:46:57] passed down. Listen, in this country, in
[1:47:00] this country,
[1:47:02] in your country,
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:05] in the United States of America
[1:47:09] or the dominion of Canada.
[1:47:14] Well, I will say it, Brother Kim. You
[1:47:17] can forgive me.
[1:47:20] They want this school over here
[1:47:24] to be transgender.
[1:47:29] And if you don't cope with it, you may
[1:47:33] lo your lose your status
[1:47:41] and perhaps and I have well I've thought
[1:47:44] about it for some few years.
[1:47:50] I'm just going to ask you, what are you
[1:47:52] going to do if they say, "Well,
[1:47:55] you're going to lose your you either
[1:47:58] have to bend to the homosexual
[1:48:00] standards
[1:48:02] or you lose your society
[1:48:09] designation.
[1:48:12] And as such,
[1:48:14] we can't allow you to give
[1:48:18] receipts for your giving.
[1:48:26] You think that this is just some kind of
[1:48:30] excitement? No. This is the real world.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's right where you're headed.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; I might be in I might be gone. I hope I
[1:48:38] am.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I hope I I hope I hope we all are gone.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But just in case,
[1:48:46] some of the little things that you've
[1:48:47] seen, horrible things that you've seen,
[1:48:51] could be just a kindergarten
[1:48:54] compared to what they want to do.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Do you think the enemy
[1:49:00] Do you think that the enemy of Christ,
[1:49:03] do you think the enemy of this word has
[1:49:05] good things all lined up for you?
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Not for a second.
[1:49:11] So, I'm just trying to prepare you.
[1:49:16] We have a good friend in Malawi.
[1:49:21] He had 600 people.
[1:49:24] How many people have we got here?
[1:49:29] And the church organizations got
[1:49:33] together and put the finger on the
[1:49:36] government and said, "This is what these
[1:49:38] people are. these are heretics or this
[1:49:41] or this or whatever more.
[1:49:44] And the building that they were using,
[1:49:47] I've been there.
[1:49:49] I preached to these people. The building
[1:49:52] that they were using, one group could
[1:49:55] use it and then the next group could use
[1:49:57] it. And there was a there was a I think
[1:49:59] a Pentecostal group that used it just
[1:50:01] ahead of them always.
[1:50:03] And when they came to enter, they found
[1:50:07] a big padlock on the door.
[1:50:10] and the message books that you hold in
[1:50:12] your hand thrown out in the ground
[1:50:15] and their song books and everything
[1:50:17] thrown out.
[1:50:20] And a bunch of them were going to be
[1:50:21] thrown in prison
[1:50:23] and one sister did go to prison. I only
[1:50:27] mention her because she gave a birth to
[1:50:29] a child in prison. She was in it about
[1:50:32] 30 days. They let most of them out.
[1:50:38] You know how many people they had the
[1:50:40] next Sunday?
[1:50:41] About 150.
[1:50:44] About 150.
[1:50:49] I'm asking you fellas, you girls,
[1:50:53] are you one of the 600 or are you one of
[1:50:55] the 150?
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm asking.
[1:51:08] What are you a part of?
[1:51:10] Are you part of what we are here today?
[1:51:21] God bless you, Sister Patricia. I
[1:51:23] thought of you this morning.
[1:51:25] I know what's deep down in your heart.
[1:51:32] Brother Kim, think these things over.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; I stand with the three Hebrew children.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; I will not bend.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; I will not bow.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; And I will not burn.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; They can heat the fire up as hot as they
[1:51:53] want to,
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; but the son of man will be there.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; There's a God we know.
[1:52:00] There's a God we understand.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; And if it means persecution
[1:52:09] or whatever it means,
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; What do you fellas think about it?
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I'm ask you some serious questions.
[1:52:23] This is a service you won't forget.
[1:52:31] I want to say with Moses
[1:52:35] who's on the Lord's side.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; You decide that in your own heart and
[1:52:43] say, "God, I'm resolved."
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Israel.
[1:52:53] I think of you often.
[1:52:57] It's not been that easy,
[1:53:00] but it still may be difficult. We don't
[1:53:02] know.
[1:53:04] But I want to say and I'd like to hear
[1:53:07] the people say, "Whatever the cost,
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; the cost,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; we the people,
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; we the people."
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:53:27] It's 12:30. Can I just have a few
[1:53:29] minutes and then I'm going to end?
[1:53:43] I asked the question a few times this
[1:53:45] morning. How do we get here?
[1:53:50] And I want to say this is how
[1:53:59] the name Leodysia
[1:54:01] the name is a Leodysian age. The name
[1:54:05] Leodysia
[1:54:08] means the people's rights.
[1:54:14] one of the most politically important
[1:54:16] and financially
[1:54:18] flourishing cities in Asia Minor. This
[1:54:22] Pacific Northwest
[1:54:26] is is
[1:54:32] by all standards of the world I would
[1:54:34] say
[1:54:36] very very
[1:54:38] fine place to live.
[1:54:42] Yes, some of you have hardships.
[1:54:47] I don't believe and I'm going to speak
[1:54:49] very personally now. I don't believe
[1:54:51] that a person is experiencing any
[1:54:53] hardship if there's anything they can do
[1:54:57] to survive.
[1:55:03] Maybe I've said enough.
[1:55:08] They worshiped one god in Leodysa.
[1:55:14] And their god was Zeus.
[1:55:17] He was the father of gods.
[1:55:26] This forecast, the prophet said, this
[1:55:29] forecast, the 20th century,
[1:55:32] one God, father of us all, religious
[1:55:36] premise that sets forth the brotherhood
[1:55:40] of man,
[1:55:42] and is even now bringing together the
[1:55:45] Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Hindus,
[1:55:48] etc.
[1:55:49] with the intent, here's the intent. How
[1:55:51] did we get here? with the intent
[1:55:56] that a mutual
[1:55:58] form of worship will increased our love
[1:56:03] and understanding
[1:56:05] and care for each other.
[1:56:08] This very attitude was seen, this is a
[1:56:10] prophet speaking now. His very attitude
[1:56:12] was seen in the United Nations
[1:56:15] organization
[1:56:17] when the world leaders refused to
[1:56:21] recognize
[1:56:22] any one individual concept of spiritual
[1:56:27] worship, but recommended putting aside
[1:56:30] all those separate concepts with the
[1:56:33] hopes that all religions become leveled
[1:56:38] into one. For all desire the same goals,
[1:56:42] all have the same purposes and all are
[1:56:46] basically right.
[1:56:49] I say we are not one of them.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; And I want to go on record to say and to
[1:56:59] emphasize
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; we are not one of them. Our form of
[1:57:05] worship cannot be leveled down
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; to the level of the United Nations. They
[1:57:11] cannot dictate to us what kind of
[1:57:14] worship we have and how we worship. Who
[1:57:17] else will talk about another cloud?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Who else talks about the seals being
[1:57:23] opened?
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Listen to friends. Those might just be
[1:57:27] phrases to you, but now I'm talking
[1:57:29] about events.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] Hallelujah.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I look into the faces of you young men
[1:57:41] and I
[1:57:43] I may look stern. I'm not stern. I'm
[1:57:46] earnest. Very earnest.
[1:57:53] I don't want anybody in here to say,
[1:57:54] "Well, that's fine for you to say,
[1:57:56] brother Bis, you got to get out and get
[1:57:58] in a fine car." And so on so forth. I
[1:58:01] want you to know, would you be part of
[1:58:06] me and my work when you didn't know if
[1:58:09] you had a milk for your kids in the
[1:58:12] morning?
[1:58:15] I could still say we the people. I
[1:58:18] wasn't intent on giving up.
[1:58:22] This hand here reached over to my dear
[1:58:26] sisters listening. This hand reached
[1:58:29] over to a little promise box and I
[1:58:32] pulled a a promise box out of there
[1:58:34] because I I didn't have anything.
[1:58:38] I was down here in Ever, Washington.
[1:58:42] And I couldn't I couldn't work cuz I
[1:58:44] wasn't allowed to work.
[1:58:47] And I pulled a promise out of the box
[1:58:50] because I didn't have 25 cents to go and
[1:58:53] buy my daughter's milk.
[1:58:56] And the promise box said, "Jehovah Gyra,
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; the Lord will provide."
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And I said, "If the Lord will provide,
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; then I will go now to the post office."
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; But nobody knew I was down there. And I
[1:59:14] went to the post office and I stood
[1:59:16] before the
[1:59:18] wicket or the counter
[1:59:21] and the man was in front of me and he
[1:59:23] left. And then I stepped forward and I
[1:59:26] said, "Do you have any mail for Ed
[1:59:28] Biscll?"
[1:59:30] And the post person turned around and
[1:59:33] reached up to the bees
[1:59:36] and threw a letter out.
[1:59:39] It was from my father. I didn't. It had
[1:59:41] been It had been forwarded.
[1:59:44] Nobody knew we were there.
[1:59:47] Nobody knew our condition. And in there
[1:59:50] was $20
[1:59:53] that got us through that difficult time.
[1:59:57] I say I say fine, we're here now on, you
[2:00:00] know, we have all of these things. Yeah.
[2:00:03] So I come to church Wednesday and Sunday
[2:00:06] and so on forth. That's not really what
[2:00:08] God wants to know. That's not what I
[2:00:10] want to know. Where would you be if
[2:00:12] there just a few?
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:18] That's what I want to ask you. They that
[2:00:21] said we the people,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; but they don't want to make that
[2:00:25] declaration today. You from the United
[2:00:28] States of America, you know that. That's
[2:00:30] not what they want to say. They don't
[2:00:32] want to say we the people. They don't
[2:00:35] want to start out with in the name of
[2:00:37] God. Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; They have no desire for that. That is
[2:00:43] repulsive to them. I say what is dear to
[2:00:46] you and it's repulsive to somebody else
[2:00:49] so be it.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; And we need to take that kind of
[2:00:55] character and let it build down.
[2:00:59] Speaking about character, I hope I'm not
[2:01:02] boring you. But speaking about
[2:01:05] character, the god of this age, the god
[2:01:10] of Leodysa,
[2:01:12] he is so uh merged himself and
[2:01:16] homogenized himself with technology.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Till you come into a place and the sound
[2:01:25] has to be just right and emphasized and
[2:01:28] the lights shining in a certain way.
[2:01:33] And we must not suffer. We must not have
[2:01:35] any pain. And we must not have any
[2:01:39] hardship.
[2:01:42] And the God of this age has taken and
[2:01:45] watch now just for a moment. And I'm
[2:01:46] coming to a close. And he's he's merged
[2:01:50] together the technology
[2:01:53] and the sounds of things
[2:01:56] and the emotions of the inner man,
[2:02:01] the memories and the imagination.
[2:02:06] and it's telling you what you could be
[2:02:11] or where you go to church
[2:02:15] and will get the sounds and and then
[2:02:18] then then captures also the uh brother
[2:02:23] Brandham says you'll have to stay with
[2:02:25] me now this was a difficult part for me
[2:02:27] to come to brother Brandham says some
[2:02:30] people are boisterous
[2:02:32] some people are really back quiet,
[2:02:36] laidback,
[2:02:38] some are dogmatic,
[2:02:41] some are unexpressive,
[2:02:44] maybe they're think deep thinkers,
[2:02:47] etc. And he says, "God made everything
[2:02:52] for us." He just he said, "I like
[2:02:54] mountains."
[2:02:56] Somebody says, "Ah, I wouldn't I I I
[2:02:59] don't care for mountains. God cleaned
[2:03:01] out his mortar box when he created the
[2:03:03] mountains." said, "Well, he said, "He
[2:03:04] did it for me."
[2:03:06] Some like the deserts,
[2:03:09] some like the plains.
[2:03:12] There are some that are like Peter,
[2:03:14] impetuous Peter,
[2:03:17] put his foot up on the
[2:03:20] railing of the boat and say, "Lord, if
[2:03:22] that's you, let me come to you."
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; And he starts walking on the waves.
[2:03:28] People say, "Oh, yeah, but he sunk."
[2:03:30] Yeah, but he stepped out.
[2:03:41] My goodness,
[2:03:44] it's wonderful, isn't it?
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not lost for words. I'm just trying
[2:03:49] to cut them back so I don't go on too
[2:03:51] far.
[2:04:00] What about Paul? He said he's scholarly.
[2:04:06] And then Paul said in his day, he said,
[2:04:10] "Some say we're following this one or
[2:04:12] we're following that one or we're
[2:04:14] following somebody else." It's exactly
[2:04:16] the same today.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "One sws and one reaps and but
[2:04:21] God gives the increase." It's God. He
[2:04:23] was trying to get everybody to see some.
[2:04:26] And then you say, "Oh, Apostle Paul,
[2:04:29] what would you do if Apostle Paul was
[2:04:31] here?"
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; What would you do when Apostle Paul
[2:04:35] stood up and said, "All men have left
[2:04:38] me?"
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Think I'd never I'd never leave you,
[2:04:49] Paul.
[2:04:53] I don't know. I'm I'm I'm really digging
[2:04:56] deep.
[2:04:59] I'm digging deep. So, this church, this
[2:05:02] congregation of people, I love you, and
[2:05:05] I think I think you're just the cream of
[2:05:08] the crop,
[2:05:10] but I wouldn't want anything to creep
[2:05:13] in.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want any worm to start eating
[2:05:16] at the at the heart of it.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; So, you settle in your own mind.
[2:05:23] You have, you're the one. I can't nip it
[2:05:25] in the bud. You have to nip it in the
[2:05:27] bud.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; You have to identify something.
[2:05:38] I become very I feel that I become very
[2:05:41] vulnerable because this is going on the
[2:05:43] internet as well.
[2:05:47] And Joanne, perhaps you won't mind if I
[2:05:50] just say this.
[2:05:52] I have a chair in my office
[2:05:57] and it's soft and
[2:06:00] should be redone and should be re
[2:06:03] covered and so on so forth. Tom, you'll
[2:06:07] allow me this space.
[2:06:16] And occasionally I have somebody come in
[2:06:19] and say, "Well, sit. you can just sit
[2:06:23] here so I can talk to you. And they sit
[2:06:26] and they sink down and you know, doesn't
[2:06:29] look like
[2:06:31] Could I afford another chair? Yeah,
[2:06:34] probably could.
[2:06:43] I said to one of the last brothers that
[2:06:45] came into my office and I was just
[2:06:46] looking up a phone number and I said,
[2:06:49] "Excuse me
[2:06:51] for that chair. I'm I'm making an
[2:06:54] apology for the chair."
[2:06:57] But I said, "You know, I never have
[2:06:58] covered that chair."
[2:07:05] I said many years ago,
[2:07:10] my daughter sat in that chair
[2:07:14] and I had just detected
[2:07:18] some little
[2:07:21] kink in the character.
[2:07:25] Good.
[2:07:27] Just a wonderful girl.
[2:07:30] Never complained. Come to church all the
[2:07:32] time. sat quiet,
[2:07:35] listened to the sermon.
[2:07:38] She had one or two good friends.
[2:07:41] One was a minister's uh the Anglican
[2:07:44] minister was next door and his girl was
[2:07:47] an adopted girl and she was a good
[2:07:50] friend. And you know, as a father,
[2:07:53] you're just scanning. As a pastor,
[2:07:55] you're just scanning. as
[2:07:57] your fathers and mothers and as elder
[2:08:01] sisters, you're just scanning and
[2:08:04] and I had scanned. I thought they can't
[2:08:06] I can't lay a finger there. She's not a
[2:08:09] bad girl at all. She's very very good.
[2:08:14] I had her I called her and she sat as my
[2:08:18] little office under the stairway and
[2:08:21] she sat in my chair
[2:08:24] and I said, "You know, honey,"
[2:08:28] I said, "U, I I've noticed you in church
[2:08:31] and you've just been real excellent
[2:08:33] young lady."
[2:08:35] I said, 'When the Holy Spirit is moving
[2:08:41] and and when he's moving, do you ever
[2:08:44] feel a
[2:08:46] feel a drawing
[2:08:49] to him?
[2:08:51] And she kind of pursed her lips
[2:08:55] and shook her head.
[2:08:59] I said, "Not even a little tinkle.
[2:09:06] No.
[2:09:10] I said, "You know, dear,
[2:09:13] you're sitting in the chair where daddy
[2:09:16] prays.
[2:09:19] I pray in that chair.
[2:09:23] I talk to God in that chair
[2:09:26] and God talks to me."
[2:09:32] I said, "I've noticed just a little
[2:09:35] something in your character."
[2:09:39] And I said, "When you get older
[2:09:42] that could cause you a lot of trouble."
[2:09:49] And I I saw be and I was digging deep
[2:09:53] and I saw a tear come down her face. Not
[2:09:56] because the tear mentioned anything, but
[2:09:59] I saw a tear coming down her face.
[2:10:02] She said, "I've tried. I've tried."
[2:10:06] Maybe you're here.
[2:10:09] You've tried. You've tried.
[2:10:12] I've got there. I've tried. I've tried.
[2:10:15] It's just not real.
[2:10:24] And the next Sunday was the Sunday
[2:10:26] morning.
[2:10:28] We were just in the church in a house.
[2:10:31] Doesn't have to be a church like this.
[2:10:32] It was just in a house.
[2:10:36] And the only me only message I ever
[2:10:39] published that I did myself that I
[2:10:42] preached myself was this one.
[2:10:46] Sinners die alone.
[2:10:50] That's the only one.
[2:10:53] And the reason now you'll hear why I
[2:10:56] published it.
[2:10:59] And I was I was weeping.
[2:11:03] I was preaching on the the man at the
[2:11:07] gate and the angels came and gathered
[2:11:10] him and took him. And the rich man died
[2:11:14] alone.
[2:11:16] And I said he died alone. sinners die
[2:11:18] alone.
[2:11:20] And I was weeping
[2:11:22] and I cried out,
[2:11:27] Joanne, it's you.
[2:11:30] And she was sitting at the back on the
[2:11:33] chair. She shot up out of that chair and
[2:11:36] ran down to the front. I don't know if
[2:11:38] she even remembers it.
[2:11:41] And from that day to this,
[2:11:44] from that day to this, that's what you
[2:11:48] see.
[2:11:49] And what you see is what you got.
[2:11:52] That is her life,
[2:11:55] friends. That's the God I'm talking
[2:11:58] about.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; That's the God I'm inviting you to.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; That's the reality
[2:12:08] that I know. That's the only God I know.
[2:12:10] That's the only God that's worth our
[2:12:12] time and worth your time. I would not be
[2:12:15] trying to persuade you any other way. I
[2:12:18] know
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; this message
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; works.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; I know this message is none other than
[2:12:26] Jesus Christ
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; and I want to follow him all the way.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; All the way.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Will you bow your heads?
[2:12:49] Dear Lord Jesus, dear Lord Jesus,
[2:12:57] I do not know how further to express
[2:13:02] what's in my heart. It's it's a mixture
[2:13:05] of feelings.
[2:13:07] Such a love for the people,
[2:13:11] such a love and determination. Oh God,
[2:13:16] Lord, if we would leave this world, we
[2:13:18] want to leave it with such a testimony
[2:13:22] that people would need to say they're
[2:13:25] committed,
[2:13:27] completely devoted.
[2:13:30] God, I pray that you will take this
[2:13:33] congregation of people,
[2:13:36] cause their character,
[2:13:39] cause their witness,
[2:13:41] cause their life to speak out
[2:13:46] truth,
[2:13:49] cause them to be a testimony,
[2:13:52] a witness of the true vine.
[2:13:55] Let them be a witness, Lord, that it
[2:13:57] works. It's a living testimony. It's a
[2:14:01] living Christ.
[2:14:03] It's a living life.
[2:14:05] Father,
[2:14:08] I pray in the name of Jesus that you'll
[2:14:10] take the words
[2:14:12] and chopped up service that we have, but
[2:14:16] we know whereof we speak. I know the
[2:14:20] reality. Oh God, you've been so good, so
[2:14:23] true, so so dependable and reliable.
[2:14:28] Lord, I pray that you'll prove yourself
[2:14:31] to everyone here. And I'm going to stop
[2:14:34] in this moment of prayer to say if you
[2:14:37] would like to be included in the prayer,
[2:14:39] if you would just stand to your feet
[2:14:41] just now, say, "I desire, I hunger after
[2:14:45] that reality." And I pray father in the
[2:14:49] name of Jesus Christ that every
[2:14:52] individual,
[2:14:53] every person whose beat heart is beating
[2:14:57] and yearning and responding to your call
[2:15:01] and your voice.
[2:15:04] Oh God, I'm so thankful that one day
[2:15:09] in the honesty and sincerity of my own
[2:15:12] soul,
[2:15:14] I found nothing out there that could
[2:15:16] satisfy
[2:15:17] and then found you.
[2:15:21] Oh God, you came to me and now I can say
[2:15:24] we the people, we the individuals, we've
[2:15:28] heard your voice. Your prophet has said
[2:15:32] once a person sees you, they can never
[2:15:35] be the same. And truly, Lord, we can
[2:15:39] never be the same. I can never be the
[2:15:41] same. I needed to see you. I needed to
[2:15:45] hear your voice.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; And I know that you can speak
[2:15:50] until a person hears it. Lord, I pray
[2:15:53] you'll give a special sensor,
[2:15:57] special hearing to the individuals that
[2:16:00] are here, gathered here. I do not even
[2:16:03] know for certain to whom these words
[2:16:07] were sent, but send them on the wings of
[2:16:11] the dove of the Holy Spirit. Send them
[2:16:15] and flutter over the hearts, oh God.
[2:16:18] flutter over the soul where there needs
[2:16:22] to be a determination. Oh God, let there
[2:16:25] come a resolve that only can come from
[2:16:28] the throne of God. As Jesus, you set
[2:16:32] your face towards Calvary, towards
[2:16:35] Jerusalem, and nothing and no one, even
[2:16:38] your closest friends, even your own
[2:16:41] disciples could not change your
[2:16:43] direction. You were headed for Calvary.
[2:16:47] You're headed for
[2:16:50] paying the price for my redemption.
[2:16:53] How I thank you. Father, I thank you.
[2:16:56] Oh, I want to give you praise before
[2:16:58] this congregation of people. I want to
[2:17:01] give this praise to you. You are so
[2:17:05] gracious and so so loving and caring. Oh
[2:17:09] God, there's none like you. There's none
[2:17:13] like you.
[2:17:15] Lord Jesus, I pray for the people.
[2:17:18] I pray for those that are hungering
[2:17:23] a life of reality,
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:27] something special.
[2:17:29] Pray that you will do it, Lord,
[2:17:33] in Jesus' name.
[2:17:36] Could
[2:17:38] we sing? Only you Lord only you.
[2:17:44] Only you Lord only you.
[2:17:49] Only you.
[2:17:55] Only you.
[2:17:59] [Music]
[2:18:02] Only
[2:18:04] you.
[2:18:08] Only
[2:18:10] you.
[2:18:15] You're the fountain.
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:21] I run to
[2:18:27] only
[2:18:29] you, Lord.
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:34] Only
[2:18:36] you
[2:18:40] only you
[2:18:43] Lord.
[2:18:46] Only
[2:18:48] you.
[2:18:53] Only you
[2:18:56] Lord.
[2:18:59] only
[2:19:00] you.
[2:19:05] You're the founder.
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:18] Holy
[2:19:20] God,
[2:19:25] you
[2:19:28] Here's
[2:19:29] [Music]
[2:19:35] some words I want to leave you. Brother
[2:19:38] Brandham starts off listen.
[2:19:43] So I would like you to listen.
[2:19:45] You young people today. I don't know
[2:19:48] whether you come to this church
[2:19:51] or where you come.
[2:19:54] you young boys and girls
[2:19:57] and I gave things today that you might
[2:19:59] have said, "Well, that is so much
[2:20:01] history." No,
[2:20:04] you stood up. Remember,
[2:20:07] you were born in this time.
[2:20:11] [Music]
[2:20:13] Did you realize
[2:20:15] here's the messenger that received the
[2:20:17] letter?
[2:20:21] He's saying, and I'm just repeating, do
[2:20:23] you realize
[2:20:27] the things that you're doing,
[2:20:30] if there's another generation,
[2:20:34] or you might say, "Well, this is just so
[2:20:36] simple, you know, you just text
[2:20:38] something
[2:20:40] or send a picture or send something."
[2:20:44] And he says, "Your children will be
[2:20:46] judged for what you do.
[2:20:49] Haven't
[2:20:52] you know
[2:20:57] respect or decency?
[2:21:00] You girls out there
[2:21:03] wearing these little old shorts and
[2:21:05] things around. You might say we don't.
[2:21:10] Praise God. You can say we the people.
[2:21:13] There's another group of people. But he
[2:21:15] was speaking to some. And there may well
[2:21:18] be. I have it here. So it is for
[2:21:21] somebody
[2:21:24] that's reflecting
[2:21:27] on your daughter. Things that we do now,
[2:21:29] things that we live now is reflecting on
[2:21:33] our children, on our daughter, on our
[2:21:35] son.
[2:21:38] Did you know your grandmommy, your
[2:21:41] grandmommy
[2:21:42] was a flapper? That's back from the
[2:21:45] roaring 20s.
[2:21:48] That's when that word was invented.
[2:21:51] That was one kind of a person.
[2:21:54] Never throwing putting on dresses and
[2:21:57] just a new whole new way of life because
[2:22:00] this is this is standard for this
[2:22:03] generation. And I can tell you that uh
[2:22:06] things that I see, things that you see,
[2:22:09] things that you see in church, things
[2:22:12] you don't see in church, but maybe you
[2:22:14] see in the in in in the school. It's
[2:22:18] madness.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Let the people say what they want to
[2:22:22] say. Is it true?
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Is it true?
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not an old crank.
[2:22:28] [Music]
[2:22:33] I see people our age,
[2:22:37] this generation,
[2:22:39] where you go, you're going to go to
[2:22:41] work, you're going to go outside and rub
[2:22:43] shoulders with the world. You know, it's
[2:22:46] insanity.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Let me hear it again.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; It's insanity,
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; which is just a offbalance, off off the
[2:22:56] middle. You cannot associate with that.
[2:22:59] That's not your colleagues. That's not
[2:23:02] your friends. That is not your
[2:23:04] associates. You are to be a light in
[2:23:07] this world. There's a world of darkness,
[2:23:09] friends. Gross darkness. That's what
[2:23:12] this Bible says.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness upon the people. And that
[2:23:18] doesn't need an upgrade.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; That's been the same for hundreds of
[2:23:23] years and is still the same. Amen.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; And your mommy a course girl from
[2:23:32] flapper to mommy and that's the reason
[2:23:36] you're a strip tease today. It's
[2:23:39] certainly
[2:23:40] what will your children be. See it's not
[2:23:44] something that is on a trend upward.
[2:23:47] It's on a trend down because the one
[2:23:50] who's inspiring it came and is destined
[2:23:55] for hell.
[2:23:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way he can think.
[2:24:02] And as I said, I said to my own girls
[2:24:06] going to a school of maybe a thousand
[2:24:08] people. Now there's 2,000 there. And one
[2:24:11] of their teachers listened to the
[2:24:13] prophets tapes till they wore them out.
[2:24:17] don't think ever darkened the door of
[2:24:19] the church even though he wanted to.
[2:24:26] His wife held him back.
[2:24:29] Dy friends, we've been through it. We've
[2:24:30] seen it. Seen every kind of situation
[2:24:33] you can imagine.
[2:24:35] Don't allow anyone to stand in your way.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Stand with the few.
[2:24:42] Even when I I hear the messenger say, I
[2:24:45] can tell you one thing, there'll be very
[2:24:48] very few. That always strikes my heart.
[2:24:52] Oh God,
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; let me be one of the few.
[2:24:56] [Music]
[2:25:12] Let me sing one of the few shall we
[2:25:14] please.
[2:25:16] [Music]
[2:25:31] one of the few and by faith in God's
[2:25:36] word I can claim it
[2:25:41] though the way makes
[2:25:45] and the opposition strong for the bride
[2:25:50] is away
[2:25:52] from my
[2:25:55] I
[2:25:58] just to hold my
[2:26:02] I must be firmly deciding
[2:26:09] to follow
[2:26:12] my oy
[2:26:15] and
[2:26:17] I
[2:26:19] will.
[2:26:21] [Music]
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to ask the congregation
[2:26:29] about the service today
[2:26:32] and I've taken my liberty.
[2:26:36] Is there something inside that says I'm
[2:26:38] I'm resolved.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Friends, there is no option.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; There actually is no option.
[2:26:51] It's God's word, God's way, God's
[2:26:54] promise. And I know for perhaps many of
[2:26:57] you, well, brother Biscll, my life and
[2:27:02] what's happened to me and the people who
[2:27:04] have affected me and everything else,
[2:27:06] you've got to separate yourself. Say, I
[2:27:09] walk with God. Even if I walk alone, I
[2:27:12] walk with God. I will not compromise on
[2:27:15] my commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:27:19] You are my savior.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you as I close the

[2:35:06] person wouldn't be much of a preacher.
