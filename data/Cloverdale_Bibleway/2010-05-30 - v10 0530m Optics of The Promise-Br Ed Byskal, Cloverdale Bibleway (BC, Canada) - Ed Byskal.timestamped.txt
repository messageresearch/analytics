[32:34] replace with thorns
[32:38] if through fiery pain a sinner soul can
[32:42] be reborn.
[32:47] But even as you walk away,
[32:52] I see you restored.
[32:57] Though your first love has died,
[33:00] I see it alive.
[33:05] As you build a wall of lies,
[33:08] truth will prevail.
[33:13] I see you fully satisfied
[33:20] behind the veil.
[33:25] You can no wonder
[33:28] again.
[33:32] Perfect.
[33:34] Release in him.
[33:39] Please yield as he speaks
[33:43] today.
[33:47] Time
[33:49] is slipping
[33:51] away. Yeah.
[33:54] Heat.
[33:59] [Music]
[34:04] Heat. Heat.
[34:06] [Music]
[34:43] Even as you walk away,
[34:49] I see you restored.
[34:51] [Music]
[34:54] Though your first love has died,
[34:58] I see it alive.
[35:02] As you build a wall of lies,
[35:06] truth will prevail.
[35:10] I see you fully satisfied.
[35:18] Fully satisfied.
[35:20] I see you there.
[35:26] behind the veil
[35:31] and I'm belieing
[35:33] here
[35:35] [Music]
[35:38] behind
[35:40] the veil
[35:51] behind Find the
[35:55] veil.
[36:07] [Music]
[36:21] Hallelujah. We're thankful for the
[36:22] token. Amen.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; And just we want to turn the service to
[36:26] our pastor. Now, if we just sing, we are
[36:29] standing on holy ground. And there's a
[36:32] announcement here from the deacons. All
[36:33] the vehicles in this middle section of
[36:35] the parking lot where the handicap
[36:36] spaces are and down need to be moved
[36:38] immediately at the close of the service.
[36:40] They're going to pull the portables out
[36:41] and they can't exit here without those
[36:44] vehicles being moved. So, if you're
[36:45] parked in this section immediately right
[36:47] out here, uh if you could just move your
[36:48] vehicles when the service is done so
[36:50] that they can haul the portables out.
[36:53] Amen. Let's uh invite our pastor now as
[36:56] we sing. We are standing on holy ground.
[37:00] Oh, we are standing
[37:08] on holy
[37:10] ground.
[37:14] Oh
[37:16] my god.
[37:21] [Music]
[37:40] [Music]
[37:44] and
[37:46] his presence.
[37:52] [Music]
[37:55] Heat.
[38:05] Heat.
[38:07] [Music]
[38:15] Oh,
[38:16] [Music]
[38:27] Jesus.
[38:34] We are standing
[38:37] in his presence on holy ground. We
[38:43] dancing together.
[38:50] [Music]
[39:18] Jesus.
[39:23] [Music]
[39:25] We are standing
[39:28] in his presence.
[39:33] [Music]
[39:36] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful place to stand. Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; We haven't come here to greet one
[39:41] another, but we've come here indeed to
[39:44] stand on holy ground and to meet with
[39:47] our our Lord Jesus Christ in a special
[39:51] way.
[39:52] Uh
[39:55] I know they've already announced the
[39:56] service for the camp this evening at
[39:59] 5:00
[40:01] and uh brother Dioka
[40:04] uh really had some trials. We had some
[40:07] trials as a result of the immigration
[40:10] department and uh so he got uh delayed
[40:15] down in Seattle. Uh but everything
[40:18] worked together for good.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; So they were able then to have a Friday
[40:24] night service, Saturday night service,
[40:26] and uh Sunday uh the they're meeting
[40:30] with us now streaming. And then tonight
[40:34] we're we'll be all together at the camp.
[40:36] So we invite everyone who can possibly
[40:38] come and we're not able to stream that
[40:42] service uh the evening service I don't
[40:46] believe but you uh we we want you there
[40:49] in the flesh.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; To be at the camp and uh brother Dio is
[40:58] going to be speaking
[41:00] and I really feel humbled, you know,
[41:01] that he comes this far and he spoke to
[41:04] perhaps 100 people or less last night.
[41:06] Uh but you know, God's ways are not our
[41:09] ways
[41:10] &gt;&gt; and God's not number conscious.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care whether we're 50 or five
[41:15] or 5,000. He just doesn't care.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; He cares about his will being done. So
[41:21] we pray that today his perfect will will
[41:23] be done here
[41:25] &gt;&gt; and we want to greet all who are on the
[41:27] streaming uh congregation also from
[41:30] whatever countries. It would just be a
[41:33] joy to have them from, you know, whether
[41:35] it would be from Nigeria or Zambia or
[41:38] the United Kingdom or Norway or
[41:41] Switzerland or New Zealand and that part
[41:44] of the world down there. Singapore, we
[41:47] just hear from them regularly. Probably
[41:49] no less than 25 nations right at this
[41:53] moment are live streaming uh the
[41:56] service, hearing you sing, hearing you
[41:57] worship, and they're worshiping with
[41:59] you.
[42:01] Uh,
[42:03] brother Randy sent me uh an attachment
[42:07] this morning which I didn't read alto
[42:09] together but uh somebody you know they
[42:12] get all stirred up some groups about
[42:15] this branomism
[42:18] and this cult
[42:20] and generally when you read it you know
[42:21] you say well there's some little groups
[42:23] and they're scattered off here and there
[42:25] and everywhere but this was quite
[42:27] different. This was saying this movement
[42:29] happens to be the fastest movement,
[42:33] fastest growing movement in Africa and
[42:36] we must do something to stop it.
[42:40] I just kind of smile. I just say go for
[42:42] it fellas.
[42:44] The more you do, the better it is.
[42:49] How can you fight God? How can you fight
[42:52] his word? So, I I just uh uh thanks for
[42:56] sending that to me, Brother Randy. And I
[42:59] was thinking while we're standing here
[43:01] and while I was in the study and brother
[43:03] Ryan was leading you in worship and it
[43:05] was just so wonderful in the songs, I
[43:08] thought, you know, they come from the
[43:11] east and west.
[43:13] Even here, they've come from so many
[43:15] different places. They come from the
[43:17] lands a far. There's brother Dioa there
[43:21] in Seattle streaming the service right
[43:23] now and brother Caillou's up in Edmonton
[43:26] preaching uh I guess for brother Harold
[43:28] Hilderbran and and my they can just come
[43:31] uh uh truly well the whole earth is the
[43:34] Lord's
[43:36] &gt;&gt; and the fullness thereof
[43:38] &gt;&gt; and he can do what he wants.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so here we are. I'm going to
[43:43] ask that you'll join with me and we're
[43:44] just going to sing that verse.
[43:47] They come from the east and west. They
[43:49] come from the lands afar. But we have
[43:51] we've come with a purpose and that's to
[43:54] dine with the king.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ryan, would you just lead
[43:57] us, please?
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Come from the east and west.
[44:05] They come from the land of
[44:11] peace with the king.
[44:14] as his guest. How blessed his children
[44:19] are.
[44:21] Behold his
[44:24] name.
[44:30] [Music]
[44:32] Bless my
[44:36] praise and his
[44:40] shine.
[44:42] Oh Jesus has set me free
[44:47] and I'm happy as I can be.
[44:53] No longer I
[44:57] care. His joke is so sweet to me.
[45:03] Oh my soul was as bright as night.
[45:08] My darkness has taken light.
[45:14] Now I shout the vtory
[45:18] for Jesus has set me free.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:28] Lord Jesus, we are so thankful that we
[45:32] are free. Free. Free.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And whom the sun sets free is free
[45:36] indeed.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; We rejoice in this glorious deliverance
[45:41] and freedom.
[45:43] Now you have prepared Lord your word for
[45:45] us. And I ask that you will give us
[45:47] hearts to receive. Give us the capacity
[45:51] to receive by faith the engrafted word.
[45:55] Oh God, which is able to save the word
[45:58] that washes us. Cleanse us, oh Lord.
[46:01] Cleanse us, I pray. And I ask, oh God,
[46:04] that you will present yourself amongst
[46:07] us. And may you be the only one that
[46:10] receives the glory. You are indeed
[46:13] lovely to us. Lord,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; we love you, Lord.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Bless your people wherever they are
[46:20] gathered today in the name of Jesus
[46:22] Christ. Amen.
[46:25] [Music]
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll have have you turn in the
[46:28] Bible
[46:30] uh to two scripture readings. The first
[46:32] one is Colossians the first chapter.
[46:38] And if you just bear with me, my voice
[46:40] is a little bit on the horse side, but
[46:44] I'm
[46:46] I'm here to conquer.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:55] In Colossians, we'll start at verse 12.
[46:59] Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath
[47:02] made us meat to be partakers
[47:05] of the inheritance of the saints in
[47:07] light,
[47:09] who hath delivered us from the power of
[47:11] darkness, and hath translated us into
[47:14] the kingdom of his dear son,
[47:17] in whom we have redemption through his
[47:19] blood, even the forgiveness of sins.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] Who is the image of the invisible God?
[47:28] I'd like you to notice that please. Who
[47:31] is the image of the invisible God, the
[47:34] firstborn of every creature?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; For by him were all things created that
[47:40] are in the heaven
[47:42] and that are in the earth, visible and
[47:44] invisible,
[47:45] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[47:48] principalities or powers. All things
[47:51] were created by him and for him.
[47:54] and he is before all things and by him
[47:58] all things consist. I'd like to read
[48:01] also in 2 Corinthians 4 and starting at
[48:04] the 14th chapter I'm sorry fourth
[48:07] chapter 14th verse.
[48:16] I'd like you to just really be prayerful
[48:19] as we read these scriptures.
[48:23] knowing that he which hath raised up the
[48:26] Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
[48:31] Jesus and shall present us with you.
[48:35] For all things uh are for your sakes
[48:40] and the abundant grace that the abundant
[48:44] grace might through the thanksgiving of
[48:47] many redounded to the glory of God. For
[48:51] which cause we faint not? But though our
[48:56] outward man,
[48:58] the visible man,
[49:00] &gt;&gt; the natural man, perish,
[49:02] &gt;&gt; yet the inward man,
[49:05] &gt;&gt; the invisible man, the unseen man,
[49:08] &gt;&gt; is renewed day by day.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; For our light affliction,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; which is but for a moment,
[49:17] &gt;&gt; workketh for us. You've got an employee.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; And it's your light affliction.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; He's working for you.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Our light affliction is working for us.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; How many have this employee?
[49:35] &gt;&gt; I I've got a whole army of them.
[49:38] You ever feel that way? We've got a
[49:41] whole army of light affliction, but
[49:42] they're working for us.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:45] and uh workketh for us a far more
[49:49] exceeding and eternal weight of glory.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And we should be able to say glory
[49:54] &gt;&gt; glory
[49:55] &gt;&gt; while we look not at the things which
[49:57] are seen are late afflictions but at the
[50:01] things which are not seen
[50:03] &gt;&gt; for the things which are seen are
[50:05] temporal
[50:06] &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen are
[50:09] eternal.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[50:13] You may be seated.
[50:20] Every once in a while,
[50:23] uh, a minister stands at his pullpit
[50:28] to preach, wherever that might be, or a
[50:31] pulpit he's been given.
[50:33] And uh
[50:38] many times I won't say many times but
[50:40] there are some times when we
[50:44] are perhaps not absolutely certain you
[50:48] know just how to phrase something
[50:51] or how to convey it.
[50:54] But I I I would like to say to you this
[50:57] morning
[50:58] uh try to look on this service as a
[51:00] different service if you would please.
[51:04] Uh
[51:05] I'm trusting that out of this service
[51:08] you will receive something to ponder
[51:12] very very deeply
[51:14] and uh maybe even young your young
[51:16] people will remember
[51:20] something. I I think that we have lived
[51:23] I believe that we have lived in our
[51:25] living in a a very very
[51:30] unique time.
[51:32] Jesus said to the people in of of his
[51:36] day, he said, "If if you'd known
[51:39] at least if you'd known even thou at
[51:43] least in this thy day." In other words,
[51:46] this was for you. This was in your day.
[51:49] The things which belong unto your peace,
[51:52] they belong to you. But uh sadly to the
[51:56] people that Jesus was speaking, he said,
[51:58] "But now they are hid from thine eyes. I
[52:01] always while I don't take that uh
[52:04] personally and I don't take it for this
[52:06] congregation, I don't take it for
[52:08] believers in this area or wherever they
[52:12] are, the believers that I know and
[52:14] fellowship with.
[52:16] I I I still hold that before me that I
[52:20] don't want because this message is so
[52:24] unique. It is so set apart from all
[52:27] others.
[52:29] You see the message that you have been
[52:31] called by and that the the reason that
[52:34] you're here today, this message is
[52:37] unique in that it is connected
[52:41] inseparably to the unseen realm
[52:44] &gt;&gt; through a prophet's ministry.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; And I have said here behind this pulpit
[52:49] before and I want to really emphasize
[52:52] today, this is not another church. This
[52:57] is not just another way to worship. We
[53:00] can sing the same songs as other people
[53:02] sing or whatever more. We open the same
[53:06] Bible that all kinds of denominational
[53:08] churches and people open. But we don't
[53:13] they do not have I'm not setting
[53:15] ourselves up. I'm simply saying they do
[53:17] not have the same connection because we
[53:21] are connected by a prophet who was
[53:25] connected
[53:27] connected continually to the unseen.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; We have a connection with the unseen
[53:32] realm.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; We have a message that was born in the
[53:36] unseen realm. We have revelations which
[53:39] we take I think quite casually uh most
[53:42] of the time but they came from the
[53:45] unseen realm and that is very very
[53:48] special
[53:49] &gt;&gt; very special and the way that the
[53:52] apostle Paul has worded this. He said,
[53:55] "For our light affliction uh which is
[53:58] but for a moment workketh for us a far
[54:02] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[54:05] glory while we look." I want to tie
[54:07] those together. Apostle Paul didn't put
[54:10] those in verses.
[54:12] Man afterward put those in verses. So
[54:15] he's saying that our light affliction
[54:17] which is but for a moment workketh for
[54:19] us a far more exceeding eternal weight
[54:22] of glory while we look at the things
[54:23] that are not seen.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; It depends on where we're looking.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Whether the affliction is doing us what
[54:33] it's supposed to do while we look not at
[54:35] the things which are seen but at the
[54:37] things which are not seen. And so I I I
[54:42] believe that we also as message
[54:44] believers, we have
[54:47] uh uh we have the opportunity, we have
[54:51] the privilege, we have the availability
[54:55] that has been made to us to reach into
[55:00] the unseen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Uh if we so desire and hunger to do so.
[55:06] So I I want to just take this
[55:10] uh service in uh I want to take my time
[55:13] if you would and I want you to ponder it
[55:15] very deeply. I want you to take a note
[55:18] if you wish or make a reference if you
[55:20] wish and uh uh we'll we'll just see how
[55:24] far we go. Now uh
[55:28] apostle Paul he also states
[55:32] that though our outward man perish
[55:37] or the visible man, the physical man
[55:44] perish.
[55:45] Yet the inward man, the unseen man, the
[55:49] one you cannot visibly see is being
[55:53] renewed day by day.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Now if you look at the visible, if you
[55:58] look at the outward, the outward will
[56:02] declare to you that you are going
[56:03] through a very hard time. Sometimes the
[56:07] outward Satan will use what you see
[56:10] physically
[56:12] &gt;&gt; and we are very very much controlled by
[56:15] our physical senses and we should not be
[56:19] &gt;&gt; amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; We should not be
[56:22] &gt;&gt; and we should remember that statement.
[56:24] We should not be controlled by what we
[56:27] see or what we are going through or what
[56:30] we experience. Be it good or bad, be it
[56:33] positive or negative,
[56:35] &gt;&gt; because all positive things are not
[56:37] necessarily great either.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; It can be a real trap of Satan. So we we
[56:44] need to remember that.
[56:47] And uh so he says that while the one
[56:51] this is these are my words while the one
[56:53] the outward man because he's perishing
[56:57] becoming weaker and weaker the inside
[57:00] man or the unseen man is actually being
[57:04] renewed daily. And you cannot look at
[57:08] that. You can't you cannot put your hand
[57:10] on it. You can't write it down into a
[57:13] into a book or make any diary of it. But
[57:16] God's word has already declared it that
[57:20] while the outward man perishes or
[57:22] becomes weaker and weaker, and I'm not
[57:24] necessarily talking about age, it could
[57:27] be circumstances. It could be a lot of
[57:29] different things that just weaken us. If
[57:32] we if we look on the outward things, we
[57:36] will become weaker. And Satan will be
[57:39] very very faithful to point to those
[57:42] things and to I and and to magnify them
[57:47] to distract you. And but God is saying
[57:51] here that we need to be looking at the
[57:54] at the unseen because the unseen man is
[57:58] actually being renewed daily. Amen.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Our light affliction workketh for us a
[58:05] far more exceeding weight of glory while
[58:08] we look at while we look not at the
[58:11] things which are seen, but that the
[58:13] things which are not seen. There isn't a
[58:15] person here alive that hasn't got a
[58:18] whole basket full of difficulties or
[58:21] problems that we're working through or
[58:23] decisions that we have to make. And that
[58:26] is I I I will just tell you that's
[58:28] that's what life's all about. Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That is what life's all about. And
[58:33] there's no use of thinking, oh, when
[58:35] this is done or when I come to that,
[58:38] when I have finally achieve this or when
[58:41] this happens, uh that's not the case.
[58:44] Don't wait for that. Just make your
[58:46] decision. If you not made it, make it
[58:48] this this morning. Now, I'm going to be
[58:51] guided by the unseen. If God's word says
[58:55] I'm being renewed daily, I confess I am
[58:59] being renewed daily. That's what he has
[59:02] said
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and I I'm not going to be guided by what
[59:07] I don't see.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Or guided by what I see rather.
[59:13] Things which are seen are temporal. Now,
[59:15] these are scriptures and I'm just using
[59:17] these words in a little different
[59:19] phrasing. Things which are seen are
[59:21] temporal. The Bible speaks of the
[59:24] temporal, those things which are
[59:25] temporal. And the temporal is it's for a
[59:28] while, for a season,
[59:32] &gt;&gt; enduring only for a little time, for a
[59:35] little while. So, are we going to be
[59:37] dictated by something that is temporal?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You say, well, the outward man perishes.
[59:43] Well, why why be directed by something
[59:45] else that's perishing? Right.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; It's also it's also it's a moving
[59:52] target.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; What is affecting you isn't going to be
[59:55] the same tomorrow.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; It might be better. It might be worse.
[59:59] But the unseen will always remain
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; because the unseen is God's word.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm speaking today on and you
[1:00:07] can remember this title if you would.
[1:00:10] Optics of the promise.
[1:00:14] the optics of the promise. Now, let me
[1:00:19] just put that in a in a natural uh uh in
[1:00:24] a in a natural setting first for a
[1:00:27] moment.
[1:00:30] Governments make promises,
[1:00:33] nations make promises,
[1:00:36] uh parents make promises, children make
[1:00:39] promises, friends make promises.
[1:00:43] we have we're all well acquainted with
[1:00:45] that and if you know and I said to my
[1:00:48] wife because I was just trying to you
[1:00:51] know get her thought in this channel and
[1:00:55] if I said to her you know cuz she loves
[1:00:58] her car.
[1:01:00] Brother Gary White used to call it a
[1:01:02] tank and so I almost acquired that same
[1:01:05] thing. I said Gary calls this a tank and
[1:01:09] she said I love it.
[1:01:11] So, my wife loves her tank. Don't try
[1:01:14] and take it away from her. It's 20 years
[1:01:16] old. And she says, "I'm going to keep
[1:01:18] it. There's nothing wrong with that
[1:01:20] car." So, I just said to her, I said,
[1:01:21] "Now, if I said to you, I'm going to
[1:01:24] make you a promise. I'm going to buy you
[1:01:26] another car."
[1:01:28] Well, right away, that activates the
[1:01:30] mind,
[1:01:32] does it not? Say, "I'm going to make you
[1:01:34] a promise. I'm going to buy you a car
[1:01:36] for your birthday."
[1:01:38] Oh, uh, you know, what color is it and
[1:01:42] what kind is it and what make is it and
[1:01:45] all the, uh, whole array of things that
[1:01:48] you could be thinking about. Uh, because
[1:01:51] the the the promise itself
[1:01:55] gives you optics,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; you understand?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And the word of God is absolutely full
[1:02:02] of promises. the promises concerning
[1:02:06] uh the new body, the promises concerning
[1:02:09] heaven, the promises concerning the
[1:02:12] resurrection, they've been here for
[1:02:14] hundreds and hundreds of years. They've
[1:02:17] been in the scripture, but God made a
[1:02:19] promise, and I'm just I I'm just giving
[1:02:22] a little bit of background now, and I'll
[1:02:23] probably give a more detail to it as we
[1:02:25] move along. God God gave a promise to
[1:02:28] Abraham and said, uh, I'm going to give
[1:02:30] you I'm going to give you a land. Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Well, he doesn't know. Is it is it
[1:02:34] desert? Is it mountains? What what is
[1:02:36] it? What kind of land is it? Where does
[1:02:38] it go from, you know, point A to point
[1:02:41] B? What what is this land like? Is it is
[1:02:43] it barren? Is it inhabited? Is it got
[1:02:45] water? What kind of land is this? Uh and
[1:02:48] it's I'm going to give you a seed. I'm
[1:02:51] going to give you a seed and your seed's
[1:02:52] going to inherit this land. And then as
[1:02:54] time goes on, God takes he takes the
[1:02:57] same promise and he keeps he keeps
[1:03:00] refining it or redefining it so he gets
[1:03:03] a little clearer picture of what it is,
[1:03:06] you know. And that's exactly what God
[1:03:08] has been doing for the bride of Jesus
[1:03:11] Christ down through the last uh 2,000
[1:03:14] years from the time of uh of of the book
[1:03:17] of Acts, from the time that Jesus walked
[1:03:19] here physically until today, the
[1:03:22] promises haven't changed. But God has
[1:03:24] sent messengers and he has sent moves of
[1:03:27] God to redefine and to become uh clearer
[1:03:30] to us what our expectation should be.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what I find is very
[1:03:37] important.
[1:03:39] So the material things are the that's
[1:03:42] why we cannot afford to be guided by the
[1:03:44] material things or the temporal things
[1:03:47] because they're vanishing and they're
[1:03:49] passing away and the things which are
[1:03:51] not seen are eternal. Now, the optics of
[1:03:55] the promise, and I said all of these, I
[1:03:58] I don't want to spend time because I've
[1:04:00] got so much else I wish to say, but you
[1:04:03] know, nations, they have the G8 and the
[1:04:05] G20 and all of this. They're going to
[1:04:07] have it in Toronto in a few days. And
[1:04:09] they're they're they're spending almost
[1:04:11] a billion dollars, just under $1 billion
[1:04:14] to protect for a few days the leaders of
[1:04:17] the world from, you know, the security
[1:04:20] is going to cost uh the people or uh
[1:04:24] Canadians at least all of this money to
[1:04:28] try to protect them. and they're going
[1:04:29] to come together and they're going to
[1:04:33] hopefully some nations want other
[1:04:36] nations to make a promise that they'll
[1:04:39] they'll do something with greenhouse
[1:04:40] gases and they'll have a certain level
[1:04:44] so we can have an expectation and they
[1:04:46] make a promise then they try to
[1:04:49] determine you know if that nation will
[1:04:51] keep their promise or if they'll work
[1:04:52] towards certain targets etc and that's a
[1:04:55] nation and and really I don't think they
[1:04:58] have a whole lot of confidence that it's
[1:05:01] going to happen. But anyway, they make
[1:05:02] promises. Uh uh churches make promises.
[1:05:07] Religions make promises. And I've just
[1:05:10] been reading and it would probably
[1:05:11] surprise you and I just decided I
[1:05:14] wouldn't even take the time because it
[1:05:15] wasn't worthwhile. But there are a
[1:05:17] number of religions, major religions. If
[1:05:20] I read for you the
[1:05:23] c main fundamental criteria of the
[1:05:26] belief of the Muslim people, brother
[1:05:28] Brandham talks about Muhammad and would
[1:05:30] say Muhammadanism which it was mostly
[1:05:33] known as known as Islam Islam today. But
[1:05:36] they have certain uh fundamental faiths.
[1:05:39] If I read them to you, you'd identify
[1:05:41] with most of them.
[1:05:43] one God.
[1:05:46] The seek religion, one God.
[1:05:49] And and he he's a giver of grace. He's a
[1:05:52] giver of life. He can only be approached
[1:05:55] a certain way. But they don't never
[1:05:58] neither one of them come with Jesus in
[1:06:00] it. They deny that God has a son. That's
[1:06:03] for sure. He hasn't got a son and he
[1:06:05] doesn't have a chosen people because
[1:06:07] they don't want to identify that the
[1:06:09] Jews have any special place. But but
[1:06:13] you'd be surprised. You'd be shocked.
[1:06:15] And I just decided I wouldn't do it to
[1:06:17] you because it would really shock you
[1:06:20] that that many. Listen, friends, we're
[1:06:23] not unique with believing in one God. In
[1:06:27] fact, is if the trinitarians, you know,
[1:06:30] and the trinitarians come down on you
[1:06:32] say, "Well, you only believe one God."
[1:06:34] Well, I can tell you what the
[1:06:36] trinitarians are in the minority
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; as far as the world is concerned.
[1:06:42] most the rest of the world that that's a
[1:06:45] Catholic faith
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; that trinity born and invented by the
[1:06:51] Catholic church nan council but the the
[1:06:54] the one god many many believe that
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; hundreds and hundreds of millions of
[1:07:00] people believe in one god and they
[1:07:03] believe in the seek religion for example
[1:07:05] which is a huge uh religion from India
[1:07:09] they definitely believe that they have
[1:07:12] The final revelation.
[1:07:14] It is the final revealed truth.
[1:07:18] Same kind of terminology that you are
[1:07:20] very very familiar with. Islam. They
[1:07:23] have the final truth. They have the
[1:07:26] prophet from God Muhammad. They believe
[1:07:28] in Jesus Christ and he was a prophet
[1:07:31] also. And they say so all kinds of
[1:07:34] people believe. I walked into where this
[1:07:36] guru was in India and uh and and and
[1:07:40] right on right on the wall probably the
[1:07:42] largest figure he had was that of Jesus
[1:07:46] standing there as a statue with his hand
[1:07:48] up. Uh you know
[1:07:53] why you're saying all this brother Ed
[1:07:55] because I think a lot about it. I think
[1:07:58] what separates me?
[1:08:03] What really separates me from all these
[1:08:05] people? They say one God. I say one God.
[1:08:07] They say the God of grace and I say he's
[1:08:09] a God of grace. I say he's the only one
[1:08:12] that can. They believe in heaven. They
[1:08:14] believe in eternal life. They believe in
[1:08:16] the resurrection
[1:08:18] just like you do like I do. What what
[1:08:20] what separates us? What makes us really
[1:08:22] different?
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Because listen, we're staking our
[1:08:25] eternal destiny on this. That's right.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; We have promises
[1:08:31] that God has has stood behind and
[1:08:35] confirmed. But for us in this day,
[1:08:38] there's the one thing that I can tell
[1:08:40] you. You have a prophet
[1:08:43] that stood before multitudes of people,
[1:08:46] thousands,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; upon thousands.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; And you can hear it if you wish. And
[1:08:51] people say, "Well, first pull, second
[1:08:53] pull." Listen, forget that for the
[1:08:55] moment. God gave the first pull and God
[1:08:58] gave the second pull to catch the
[1:09:01] attention of the people so that he can
[1:09:03] he can he can require them to uh at
[1:09:07] someday say you were in the meetings you
[1:09:09] saw this and and millions did but the
[1:09:14] but the but the the defining aspect here
[1:09:17] for me is that God and the message we
[1:09:21] have connects us with the supernatural
[1:09:25] and the unseen world
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; I can't bring down to you today
[1:09:31] unless God would give me some divine
[1:09:35] uh opportunity and some opening but just
[1:09:39] to think that a vessel in your time and
[1:09:43] my time that's why that's why I would
[1:09:45] say Jesus said if you'd only known this
[1:09:48] day
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; when these things have happened
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; we should know and I know that we do
[1:09:56] know. But it it it has to have a greater
[1:09:59] effect than simply knowing it.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture says while we
[1:10:03] look, so we we keep looking at the
[1:10:05] unseen at the unseen. We have a we have
[1:10:10] messages and specific things within the
[1:10:13] word, within the message that we can
[1:10:16] say, I have something
[1:10:19] that was born in the unseen realm. Yeah,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; I have something that was delivered to
[1:10:25] me by a proven vindicated messenger.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Who else has that?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Does a billion Catholics have it? Don't
[1:10:33] have it.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not opposed to them. I'm just saying
[1:10:35] they don't have it.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Do other denominations have it? They
[1:10:38] don't have it.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Sorry, folks. They just don't have it.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; There's a over a billion uh Muslims. I'm
[1:10:45] not opposed to them at all. A lot of
[1:10:47] very fine people, very fine people,
[1:10:50] cultured people, good people. Not all of
[1:10:53] them are terrorists at all. There are a
[1:10:55] lot of good people, but they do not have
[1:10:57] what we have what you have.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; They they cannot say, "I have heard a
[1:11:02] voice." And here God's been so gracious.
[1:11:05] You have it available. You can I I
[1:11:08] plugged it in, listened for a couple
[1:11:09] hours this morning or in the middle of
[1:11:11] the night. Uh just to think there's Who
[1:11:15] else can do that? Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Who else can do that?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Did God just send it to make a sound
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; or did God send it to give us uh some
[1:11:24] eyesight into the invisible realm?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; So that you have something to look at.
[1:11:32] Who else can take Paul's words? Who else
[1:11:35] can take Paul's words? Looking to the
[1:11:37] unseen, looking at the unseen. But you
[1:11:40] can.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; And and and you don't have to be
[1:11:44] learned. You don't have to be a certain
[1:11:46] age. You can look at the unseen.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; So we we have uh do you mind if I just
[1:12:01] take my time now?
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to stay very very alert. We
[1:12:05] have three levels of of eyesight. We
[1:12:08] have the
[1:12:10] physical sight.
[1:12:12] We also have the sight of uh I would say
[1:12:15] the imaginary
[1:12:17] which is one of the channels of the
[1:12:19] spirit and we all imagine things and
[1:12:23] like I said soon as a promise is made
[1:12:25] then the im imaginary goes into action
[1:12:29] we begin to imagine things and that's
[1:12:32] where I would say that your emotional
[1:12:34] realm listen to this your emotional
[1:12:38] realm is full of illusions.
[1:12:43] something you think you see but it's not
[1:12:46] accurate
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; and as you get closer or in your
[1:12:50] expectation it vanishes or it changes
[1:12:52] and it's different and it might prove
[1:12:55] just to be a complete illusion.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; That's why people serve even in the
[1:13:00] message they serve the message. Oh, what
[1:13:03] a revelation. Oh, they're just ecstatic.
[1:13:05] And a few years ago they're gone. Where
[1:13:08] are they? Oh man, they're off in the
[1:13:10] street. They're with some hockey game or
[1:13:14] baseball game or something else. They're
[1:13:15] gone.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Was it a revelation to them? No, it was
[1:13:20] no revelation. A revelation becomes a
[1:13:22] part of you.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; A revelation is not something you learn.
[1:13:26] A revelation is something you
[1:13:28] experience.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; It becomes a part of your body, part of
[1:13:32] your whole soul, your whole being.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; And so there is a an illusion. And don't
[1:13:38] forget the emotions.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; You can just feel so wonderful one day.
[1:13:43] You just ask yourself, "What made me
[1:13:46] feel so wonderful today?"
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; And you you'll find it'll be some
[1:13:50] circumstance or something else or or you
[1:13:53] feel down.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; You feel just so discouraged. You feel
[1:13:57] so low. They need to pick you up with a
[1:13:59] shovel. You say, "Well, what made me
[1:14:02] feel so low?" You'll find it's things
[1:14:04] that you see.
[1:14:07] things that are visible,
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; things which have set up uh uh the
[1:14:13] optics of your imagination
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and you begin to project it out there.
[1:14:17] Projected projecting things that never
[1:14:20] happen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're going to be
[1:14:26] quiet. I'm going to preach it anyway.
[1:14:31] And the third thing is there is sight
[1:14:33] which originates
[1:14:35] in the realm of the soul.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; A call of God
[1:14:42] like a call and I've spoken of that the
[1:14:45] call the gifts and calling of God are
[1:14:47] without repentance. Brother Brandham
[1:14:50] refers to it as eyes of faith. Faith is
[1:14:54] not in the imaginary realm. Faith is not
[1:14:57] in the emotional realm at all. And it is
[1:15:01] a faith and absolute belief in the
[1:15:04] promise of God. And it's the same today.
[1:15:07] It was the same yesterday. And it'll be
[1:15:09] the same as long as we are around.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] Now,
[1:15:17] um, Brother Brandham, he he gave this in
[1:15:20] his life story, and I hope this doesn't
[1:15:22] sound too fundamental because hang on to
[1:15:25] your seats.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; I hope you can stay with me where I'm
[1:15:31] going. I was trembling, but where I'm
[1:15:34] going,
[1:15:37] there was a great gigantic tree.
[1:15:41] He said it was most beautiful. Now it's
[1:15:43] a great gigantic tree. This is the
[1:15:48] visible.
[1:15:50] And he said it was most beautiful.
[1:15:54] I could see its great mighty branches
[1:15:58] sway in the wind. Great huge trunk. He
[1:16:03] was a It was impressive
[1:16:05] because the physical makes it
[1:16:07] impressive.
[1:16:09] and he said, 'You know, I believe that
[1:16:11] this tree will be here for hundreds and
[1:16:14] hundreds of years.
[1:16:16] He was impressed with it. He said, 'Not
[1:16:19] long ago, I took a look at that old tree
[1:16:21] and it's just a snag.
[1:16:25] I said, Lord, I I just took that
[1:16:28] personally. I said, 'Lord, even if I'm
[1:16:31] just a snag, whatever's left, you know,
[1:16:35] you're the one we're not looking at,
[1:16:37] whether it's just a snag or whether it's
[1:16:39] a great big flourishing something, we're
[1:16:41] not going to be moved either way.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And he said, for here we have no
[1:16:49] continuing city. No, nothing here on
[1:16:52] earth that you can look at will
[1:16:55] continue.
[1:16:57] He said it's got to have an end.
[1:16:59] Everything that's mortal has to give way
[1:17:03] to immortality.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; So no matter how good we build our
[1:17:07] highways, how fine we make our
[1:17:09] structures, it all has to go. For here
[1:17:14] there is nothing can continue. Just the
[1:17:17] unseen is what continues.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; So right here today,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; this is announcement to you. There is an
[1:17:24] unseen there. There's an inner man.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; There's an unseen realm. There's angels
[1:17:30] here.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ himself is here.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire is here.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; And if we actually saw that through the
[1:17:40] promise, it would make us even act
[1:17:43] differently.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; We would have a reverence. We would have
[1:17:48] a certain kind of an attitude that it
[1:17:50] would bring us into if we if we could
[1:17:53] see that clearly that the unseen is
[1:17:56] present. The unseen is eternal. The
[1:17:59] unseen is more real than the physical.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; More real.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The unseen is going to outlast your
[1:18:08] problems.
[1:18:11] The unseen is going to outlast your
[1:18:13] sickness
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; or your difficulties
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; or whatever they might be. The unseen is
[1:18:21] going to outlast your successes
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; and the good life
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; are we on track
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; in why Christ speaks
[1:18:37] faith doesn't look at the present time.
[1:18:41] Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks
[1:18:45] to see what God wants.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And works accordingly.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He said that's what faith does.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; It sees what God wants
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; and what God wants done and faith
[1:18:58] operates through that.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; He said faith is a long range vision.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; It don't lower its sights. It holds to
[1:19:09] the target.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Faith holds to the target.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Some of you young people are going to be
[1:19:15] soon graduating or you have graduated.
[1:19:18] You'll have graduating ceremonies and
[1:19:20] another year has has gone by. You've had
[1:19:25] your you you have your marks and certain
[1:19:27] achievements etc. and you have your
[1:19:28] plans for the future. Just remember
[1:19:31] that's all a moving target.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; It's very much a moving target. Right?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith picks up God's
[1:19:41] binoculars, both of them, both sides,
[1:19:43] the New and the Old Testament."
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; And sees every promise that he made, and
[1:19:49] faith sees it out yonder.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Faith sees the promise. We don't want to
[1:19:54] read it like a promise box. We don't
[1:19:56] want to read it like just a scripture or
[1:19:58] a book that we have. But this is a great
[1:20:01] eternal unseen God.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; The invisible God that actually uh came
[1:20:07] down and spoke certain things and gave
[1:20:11] promises to human people
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; of what he will do and how he will do
[1:20:16] it. And we see that he has been doing it
[1:20:20] and that should give us a lot of a lot
[1:20:22] of confidence. Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Faith chooses that." Faith
[1:20:27] chooses that regardless of what the
[1:20:29] present tense says here.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; He looks at the end.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; He doesn't drop his sights down to look
[1:20:38] this way.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Have you ever had a pair of binoculars
[1:20:42] and and tried to look down here?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Tell you, you won't do very well.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; You need the binoculars for a long range
[1:20:50] vision.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; You won't walk very stable if you have
[1:20:54] it right in front of you.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; And then in the third Exodus,
[1:20:59] he says, "May we be led to the tree of
[1:21:01] life that we might be a possessor of
[1:21:03] eternal life and see the hand of God and
[1:21:06] by the eyes of faith look beyond these
[1:21:10] shadows."
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm speaking to a congregation
[1:21:13] whether it's a whether uh on the
[1:21:16] internet or wherever you live or
[1:21:19] whatever background you have. We all
[1:21:22] have our life of shadows.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody does.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And and if everything is bright and
[1:21:29] sunshine and glorious today, don't
[1:21:31] worry. I'm not speaking about the time
[1:21:33] that everything is easy and flowing. I'm
[1:21:36] talking about when you have the day of
[1:21:38] shadows. And we all have the times of
[1:21:41] shadows, but there's an unseen hand.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; That's guiding us.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; There's an unseen promise.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; The promise, it may be visible, but the
[1:21:53] promise sets up optics. There's optics
[1:21:56] of the promise.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And when you hear the promise, when you
[1:22:00] see the promise, even though you may not
[1:22:02] understand it clearly, you want to just
[1:22:05] declare that promise. I see something
[1:22:08] and not in a imaginary and illusionary
[1:22:11] way, but I see a promise and and you
[1:22:14] don't have to know a lot of things about
[1:22:15] the promise. You have to say, I know God
[1:22:18] said that.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And I know that God will never deny
[1:22:22] that.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; I know that that is God's word. And even
[1:22:25] if I don't physically see what I think
[1:22:28] that promise should be doing,
[1:22:30] nevertheless, God's promise is absolute
[1:22:33] truth.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Yay and amen. Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Because your faith, you see, your faith
[1:22:42] reaches far beyond even this life.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Your faith reaches into the eternal.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; In the message, Door of a Door,
[1:22:55] he said, uh,
[1:22:57] I've often wondered when they would see
[1:22:59] his word manifested.
[1:23:02] What do they do about it?
[1:23:05] Uh oh. Well, he says some say, well,
[1:23:07] it's telepathy and another says it's
[1:23:10] some wild imagination.
[1:23:12] He said, examine it by the word. God's
[1:23:16] word promised it. The heavens and the
[1:23:19] earth shall pass away, but my word shall
[1:23:23] never fail.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Open up the door of faith. And if your
[1:23:27] faith will put you in position to know
[1:23:31] that every divine promise of God's Bible
[1:23:34] is for you,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; just as sure as that pertained to him,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; every promise pertains to you.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; As sure as it pertained to him, every
[1:23:46] promise pertains to you. And he said,
[1:23:50] "Your healing, the salvation, your
[1:23:53] freedom from sin and from selfishness
[1:23:56] and from your indifference and your
[1:23:58] little turtle shell that you pull
[1:24:01] yourself into, Christ wants to come in
[1:24:05] and be Lord and ruler and to set you
[1:24:08] free from these things."
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; And whether you have it now or whether
[1:24:13] you experience it now, I'm going to
[1:24:14] preach down where we're at. I believe
[1:24:16] that he was.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; We all have experienced a little turtle
[1:24:20] shell.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; We kind of pull in. I'm going to just be
[1:24:23] here all by myself.
[1:24:26] Won't work.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; You've had that.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He said Christ wants to come in
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; and be the Lord and ruler.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; So, we are not uh as I said earlier,
[1:24:40] we're not unique in that we believe in
[1:24:43] the unseen.
[1:24:46] Uh
[1:24:48] we're not unique in the world in that
[1:24:50] this world is filled with sincere
[1:24:53] believers
[1:24:55] of different faiths and many believe as
[1:24:58] I said earlier in one God. But we are
[1:25:01] children of the promise of this day. Now
[1:25:04] this is where I really need your
[1:25:06] attention.
[1:25:08] We are children. We're actually we just
[1:25:10] say well children here we are. We're all
[1:25:14] children. We're brothers and sisters.
[1:25:16] All kinds of people call each other
[1:25:18] brothers and sisters, but I want to put
[1:25:20] this in a different context.
[1:25:23] Hello.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; You walked into this church. I want you
[1:25:29] to know that when you walk out, I'm I'm
[1:25:33] perhaps laying a heavy on you.
[1:25:36] The fact that you're here
[1:25:39] is a you are testifying
[1:25:42] and you're saying something.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You're saying I I believe something.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; You're saying, "I'm here because I have
[1:25:55] a certain connection."
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] And perhaps you looked around in the
[1:26:01] service and to see who's here and who's
[1:26:05] not here and whatever more
[1:26:08] and those are all the physical things
[1:26:11] and they're all changing. The next time
[1:26:13] we meet it'll be a different crowd.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Some of the same people will be here but
[1:26:18] others may not be here and then there
[1:26:20] may be more people here and whatever
[1:26:22] more that should have no effect on us.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I feel really good here now
[1:26:27] because I see so and so is here. That
[1:26:29] has nothing to do with that. That's a
[1:26:32] moving target. That might not be the
[1:26:34] same tomorrow
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; or the next Sunday or whatever more. So,
[1:26:37] let's put that one aside.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; The things that are the things that are
[1:26:43] seen are are are temporal and they're
[1:26:47] passing. You're sitting here today and
[1:26:50] you feel reasonably well. you feel
[1:26:52] healthy and strong and say, "I feel
[1:26:54] really good today." That has nothing to
[1:26:56] do with it. Next Sunday, you might feel
[1:26:58] terrible.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Might say, "I don't know what happened.
[1:27:01] I don't feel well." That has nothing to
[1:27:04] do with it.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That has absolutely nothing to do with
[1:27:06] it because that book of promises is not
[1:27:09] going to change by how you feel or what
[1:27:11] has happened or something good has
[1:27:13] happened to me. I uh you know, I I got I
[1:27:16] got a raise. I got a I got a refund from
[1:27:19] the tax department. Well, wonderful. We
[1:27:21] could all rejoice about that, but that
[1:27:23] that's not going to change things,
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; It might just, you know, help out with
[1:27:29] something that is is for the moment. And
[1:27:31] so the one critical thing and I'm going
[1:27:34] to stay close to my notes right now. The
[1:27:36] one critical thing critical thing that
[1:27:40] separates message believers from all
[1:27:42] others is the abundant evidence
[1:27:46] of the unseen God
[1:27:49] manifesting himself
[1:27:52] through his prophet messenger.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That is the one thing
[1:27:58] by irrefutable proofs.
[1:28:01] Irrefutable proof. What does it mean to
[1:28:03] you?
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I tell you, they're very, very
[1:28:06] important.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; They're very, very important.
[1:28:10] Irrefutable proofs of the attendance of
[1:28:14] angels.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Of the unseen presence of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see that light? No. Well, maybe
[1:28:25] they don't. Do you see that light? It's
[1:28:29] moving. is over this woman here.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:28:34] people could be looking all around
[1:28:36] physically. So their optic nerve isn't
[1:28:39] registering anything because they don't
[1:28:41] see it.
[1:28:43] And emotionally
[1:28:45] they might even be sitting in the in the
[1:28:48] in in the congregation feeling uh uh
[1:28:52] very very very much doubting
[1:28:56] uh perhaps even critical of the ministry
[1:29:00] of the prophet. But he's saying there's
[1:29:01] a light and it's hanging over this
[1:29:04] woman.
[1:29:06] But then he begins to speak
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; and from somewhere from some source
[1:29:15] they say well you came from a certain
[1:29:17] place I see your daughter wrote you a
[1:29:21] letter and said I was you were going to
[1:29:23] visit her but your daughter wrote you a
[1:29:25] letter the letter's in your purse and
[1:29:27] said I was going to be in this city and
[1:29:29] so you you stayed at come to this
[1:29:31] meeting and this is your ailment and
[1:29:33] this is your problem or this is your
[1:29:35] dilemma.
[1:29:36] This is what your heart's cry is. Who
[1:29:38] did that?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Now, what do we do with it?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Say, well,
[1:29:46] no, it's on your hands.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Is this too simple?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, we're talking about
[1:29:53] you're you're you're sitting here today
[1:29:55] as a testimony. I plan to go to an
[1:29:58] unseen realm.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; You better have an unseen power to lead
[1:30:02] you there.
[1:30:04] You better have some proof that you
[1:30:06] believe in the unseen and you are
[1:30:08] connected with it.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; You're connected to it.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; How are you connected? Because God from
[1:30:19] the unseen realm has sent a certain word
[1:30:22] at this time and confirmed it was for
[1:30:25] this day and he spoke of it out of the
[1:30:27] heavens.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:31] Even I think of David Edwin Herrell,
[1:30:34] professor David Edwin Herrell from the
[1:30:36] University of Birmingham, Alabama when
[1:30:39] he wrote his book on the great movement
[1:30:41] that stirred the great revivals and
[1:30:44] stirring and changed the face of America
[1:30:46] and how he said and then when he came
[1:30:48] and I spoke with him as he came came up
[1:30:51] here and I spent a Saturday with him and
[1:30:54] I said why did you put brother Brandham
[1:30:56] first? You said the two giants Or
[1:30:58] Roberts and William Brandham and you put
[1:31:00] William Brandham first. I said and then
[1:31:03] you said in there that if it were not
[1:31:06] for the abundance
[1:31:10] of record
[1:31:12] of visitation of angels
[1:31:15] and if it were not for the supernatural
[1:31:17] which was in attendance.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Irrefutable proof. Oh,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; they would have good reason to doubt
[1:31:25] concerning the visitation of the angels,
[1:31:27] but they had to believe that there was
[1:31:29] visitation of angels because of the
[1:31:31] material things that were happening.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Why am I emphasizing it? That's your
[1:31:38] connection.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; The Mohamadan's a billion strong and
[1:31:46] Buddhist by hundreds of millions and all
[1:31:48] of these people. Listen, God God is a
[1:31:52] God is a God of the people of the whole
[1:31:54] earth. He filled the earth. He's given
[1:31:56] life to all people. And there are
[1:31:58] sincere people and innocent people and
[1:32:01] and ignorant people and humble people
[1:32:04] and people living in hardships and all
[1:32:06] the rest. I think of the whole the whole
[1:32:09] masses of the entire earth.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; I think of them.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I think of how God looks on them. And
[1:32:18] when I do, I I get reduced down to see
[1:32:22] that there are certain scriptures that
[1:32:24] have been spoken of and prophecies which
[1:32:27] have been made
[1:32:29] and see that God in his grace, abundant
[1:32:33] grace, marvelous grace
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; allowed you
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; and I
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and a few others to somehow get
[1:32:43] connected
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; and to see what we see. and he reached
[1:32:48] out wherever you were in the world or in
[1:32:51] a colony or in some other country and
[1:32:55] got a hold of you and you heard the word
[1:32:57] and somehow it spoke a reality to your
[1:33:00] soul and you said I cannot deny this.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; This is marvelous. And God in his
[1:33:10] sovereignty in his sovereign way
[1:33:12] connected you with the unseen realm.
[1:33:17] [Applause]
[1:33:19] And here you are today.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Nothing good that you did. God connected
[1:33:24] you.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And now for the first time you can say,
[1:33:29] "I can look to the unseen. I have some
[1:33:32] substance."
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; All kinds of churches can make promises.
[1:33:39] Preachers can make promises. I'm not
[1:33:41] here making some great promise to you.
[1:33:43] I'm here telling you that God sent a
[1:33:46] vessel
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; to do a specific part and fulfill a
[1:33:51] certain part of the scripture
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; and somehow God connected you to that
[1:33:56] ministry and that's the only thing that
[1:33:59] separates you from all six billion of
[1:34:01] humanity
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; and you ought to be very very grateful.
[1:34:07] You ought to be very thankful. You ought
[1:34:10] to be very respectful. Say, "Oh God,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; have mercy on me.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Help me to understand,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; help me to appreciate
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; what you've done.
[1:34:28] Thank you.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; As I said earlier, and I'm just going to
[1:34:34] go very very quickly
[1:34:37] because I just one one thought I want to
[1:34:41] uh
[1:34:42] derive from these about three or four
[1:34:44] verses.
[1:34:46] And the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[1:34:48] unto him, unto your seed will I give
[1:34:50] this land. This is right at the very
[1:34:52] beginning of Abraham's contact with God.
[1:34:55] and unto your seed will I give this
[1:34:57] land. And there he builded an altar unto
[1:34:59] the Lord that appeared to him.
[1:35:03] Then later on in Abraham's life,
[1:35:08] he says, "And behold, the word of the
[1:35:10] Lord came to him, saying, this shall not
[1:35:13] be thine heir." Now, he's defining it
[1:35:14] because he's got a son, Ishmamail.
[1:35:18] And now God is defining it a little bit
[1:35:21] clearer. This will not be your heir.
[1:35:24] and and also he had he was speaking
[1:35:27] regarding his servant at this time who
[1:35:30] was over all of his household. He said
[1:35:33] he won't be your heir but he that shall
[1:35:35] come out of thine own bowels
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; shall be thine heir.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; So now he's redefining it or not
[1:35:42] redefining it but defining it finer. And
[1:35:45] then further in Abraham's ministry um
[1:35:48] Abraham's life and walk with God, God
[1:35:51] said, "And I will give unto thee and to
[1:35:53] thy seed after the the land wherein thou
[1:35:56] art a stranger all the land of Canaan."
[1:35:58] Now he's told him that what what land it
[1:36:01] is
[1:36:02] for an everlasting possession and I will
[1:36:05] be their God. So now he's enlarged on
[1:36:07] it. He said more and it gives the the
[1:36:11] promise has optics. I hope I'm saying
[1:36:14] that right.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Paul picks it up in Hebrews. He says,
[1:36:21] "For when God made promise to Abraham,
[1:36:23] because he could swear, now I want you
[1:36:27] to stay real real attentive
[1:36:32] when God made promise to Abram." But now
[1:36:35] we are Abraham's
[1:36:37] royal seed.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; And there is a royal seed of Abraham.
[1:36:42] Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Abraham the father of faith.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He has children.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And I trust by God's grace we are one of
[1:36:55] those.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; And we had made promise to Abraham
[1:37:01] because he could swear by no greater.
[1:37:03] Oh, it wasn't enough to make a promise.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; No. Now he's going to swear because he
[1:37:08] could swear by no greater. He swore by
[1:37:11] himself. Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Saying surely blessing I will bless thee
[1:37:18] and multiplying I will multiply thee.
[1:37:21] And so after he had patiently endured he
[1:37:24] obtained a promise. He said for men
[1:37:26] verilely swear by the greater and an
[1:37:29] oath for confirmation is to them an end
[1:37:33] of all strife.
[1:37:36] He says, "Wherein
[1:37:38] God," now I'll be dwelling on this a
[1:37:41] while,
[1:37:43] wherein God
[1:37:45] willing more abundantly
[1:37:48] to show unto the heirs. Now, he's not
[1:37:50] talking just about Abraham, but he says
[1:37:52] to show unto the heirs of promise the
[1:37:56] immutability of his counsel, unchanging,
[1:38:00] inflexible,
[1:38:02] impossible to change to show, he said,
[1:38:07] willing more abundantly
[1:38:10] to show to the heirs of the promise. Are
[1:38:14] you are you Abraham's children?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham's God
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; was determined not only to make him a
[1:38:24] promise
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; but to continue to define the promise as
[1:38:29] time went on.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; We have not just remade had promises
[1:38:34] salvation and the resurrection and
[1:38:36] eternal life. Jesus spoke of that. But
[1:38:39] then the apostle Paul came the first
[1:38:41] church age messenger and he speaks of it
[1:38:43] more. We shall not all sleep. Some have
[1:38:46] slept in Christ but we shall not all
[1:38:48] sleep. But we shall all be changed.
[1:38:50] Jesus never said anything, but we shall
[1:38:52] all be changed. Paul said we shall all
[1:38:54] be changed. And so now it it's it's a
[1:38:56] promise and it sets up our our uh the
[1:38:59] optics of our imagination or our mind or
[1:39:03] maybe just within the realm of our soul.
[1:39:05] We shall be changed. Nothing can change
[1:39:08] that. This is inflexible. This is
[1:39:11] unchangeable.
[1:39:12] This is something spoken by almighty
[1:39:14] God.
[1:39:17] Hallelujah.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And he says to show unto the heirs of
[1:39:22] the promise. You pray for yourself and
[1:39:24] pray for me now because this is where
[1:39:26] I've been questioning how I can say this
[1:39:28] and how I will get it across.
[1:39:31] The immutability of his counsel. He
[1:39:35] confirmed it by an oath. You know, you
[1:39:38] can make a promise. Then you may stand
[1:39:41] up in court and they say, "Do you swear
[1:39:43] to me that this is the truth?" the
[1:39:45] absolute truth and nothing but the
[1:39:47] truth. I do.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; So help me God.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; They would require that in a court. Or
[1:39:54] you might go down and say
[1:39:57] this. This is my record of the events.
[1:39:59] This is precisely what happened. Do you
[1:40:01] swear that that's the truth? Some say,
[1:40:03] well, you can't swear. All right. Do you
[1:40:05] will you make an oath that that's the
[1:40:07] truth? Will you confirm it with an oath
[1:40:10] that this is the truth? Will you sign
[1:40:12] this before before a representative of
[1:40:15] the court? Will you sign this before a
[1:40:17] notary republic and have a stamp on it
[1:40:20] and put the seal on it and this is
[1:40:22] exactly and and if there's anything in
[1:40:25] there that error it'll come back on you.
[1:40:27] And so you say this is precisely what
[1:40:29] happened. I was there and brother
[1:40:31] Brandham said you can't do that unless
[1:40:32] you were a witness and you had to be
[1:40:35] there and you had to hear it yourself
[1:40:37] and then you're a witness.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Say I was a witness. This is exactly
[1:40:41] what happened. That car was driving. It
[1:40:43] went through a red light. I was standing
[1:40:45] there. This is what happened. And I
[1:40:47] struck this other vehicle, struck this
[1:40:49] man, struck this bicycle. Then you're a
[1:40:51] witness and you you can declare it and
[1:40:54] you make an oath.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; It's not just enough to say, "Well, I
[1:40:58] was there and and so on." Now a promise.
[1:41:01] So God
[1:41:03] he he willing abundantly willing more
[1:41:07] abundantly to show to the heirs of the
[1:41:11] promise
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; that he that that that his promise that
[1:41:17] his counsel his counsel is immutable.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; The immutability of his counsel he
[1:41:24] confirmed it with an oath.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] God willing, more abundantly to show
[1:41:30] unto the ears of promise, I speak now of
[1:41:32] Abraham's royal seed.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; If we don't believe in Abraham's royal
[1:41:37] seed, we have no business being here.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; We're just playing a game.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; We're just playing a game. All kinds of
[1:41:44] people have churches. All kinds of
[1:41:46] people have uh uh doctrines and all
[1:41:49] kinds of people have promises and
[1:41:51] beliefs and pie in the sky things and
[1:41:54] resurrections and whatever more. All
[1:41:56] kinds of them have it. Can you believe
[1:41:58] today that the scripture says the same
[1:42:00] Bible that you're standing here sitting
[1:42:02] there saying you believe says all whose
[1:42:05] names are not written in the lamb's book
[1:42:07] of life before the foundation of the
[1:42:09] world they shall worship the beast.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; They'll be under the control of the
[1:42:14] antichrist. That is anti-word.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; That really starts to slim things down.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; But that's the word of God. And that's
[1:42:24] also a promise.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; There's other promises. Promises that
[1:42:30] says that uh that Satan in his defeat
[1:42:34] will be cast into the lake of fire.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And there's great shouting and rejoicing
[1:42:41] that he's gone to his doom.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you if God allows me to
[1:42:45] have a voice in that realm, I will
[1:42:48] certainly be heard.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; I'll be saying, "Glory to God. The
[1:42:53] tempter's gone.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; The evil one is gone.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Never to be a trouble anymore.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:04] [Applause]
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; We're here as Abraham's royal seed.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:43:16] and God has provided a way. Listen, if
[1:43:19] this starts going over your head, don't
[1:43:21] worry about it. You'll think about it
[1:43:23] and you come back to it. He said, "You
[1:43:27] shall receive power." He's he's quoting
[1:43:29] the scripture now. You shall receive
[1:43:31] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:43:33] you and then you shall be witnesses of
[1:43:36] me in Jerusalem and Judea. And this was
[1:43:39] happened to be in Victoria where he was
[1:43:41] preaching this. So he said, "And in
[1:43:42] Victoria, I was sitting on the
[1:43:44] platform."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. and to the uttermost part of the
[1:43:47] earth. He said, after 2,000 years of
[1:43:52] unbelieving and falling away and creeds
[1:43:54] and doctrines and dogmas being added to
[1:43:57] the church, they needed a sign to find
[1:44:00] out whether he still lived or not.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my, he said God had provided a way.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The proof of his resurrection,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; a sign that he had promised to Abraham.
[1:44:15] Abraham's royal seed.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Hey, he's referring to a promise that
[1:44:19] was made to Abraham's royal seed.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; And it was the same one he gave. He said
[1:44:25] he promised Abraham, he promised to
[1:44:28] Abraham's royal seed that the same sign
[1:44:31] that Abraham's seed seen, his royal seed
[1:44:35] would see the same sign.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And we're living in the evening time.
[1:44:42] This has been declared in British
[1:44:43] Columbia in 1962.
[1:44:48] and the same sign.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I happened to sit on the
[1:44:51] platform and I saw him I saw uh the
[1:44:55] almighty God from the unseen realm take
[1:44:58] a human vessel in the visible realm. And
[1:45:00] he because the sign he gave to Abraham
[1:45:03] is that he turned his back and the tent
[1:45:06] was behind him and he spoke of Sarah and
[1:45:09] that I will I personal pronoun will
[1:45:12] certainly come to her according to the
[1:45:14] time of life and Sarah shall have a
[1:45:16] child. That was the sign.
[1:45:20] How did he know he was married? How did
[1:45:22] he know her name was Sarah? How did he
[1:45:23] know these things? It came from the
[1:45:25] unseen. It was wisdom from the unseen
[1:45:28] realm. And now we had a messenger on
[1:45:31] earth stand and put his back to the
[1:45:34] congregation and began to connect to the
[1:45:37] un invisible realm and turn right around
[1:45:41] say, "Isn't that so? Isn't that so?" I
[1:45:44] said, "Where did that come from?
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; That's the unseen realm.
[1:45:50] and that's why you're here.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; That is your connection.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; If it's not, we might as well just go
[1:45:58] and worship at 7th Day Adventist or
[1:46:00] Baptist or any other place. They're all
[1:46:02] fine people
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; and they all make wonderful promises.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He did.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "And he promised to Abraham's
[1:46:16] royal seed
[1:46:18] that the same sign that Abraham seen
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; maybe several thousand years ago."
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; And to think that that sign was brought
[1:46:28] right in front of the people.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I wish I could see it."
[1:46:33] You have it on tape
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; and you can listen to it and you can
[1:46:38] hear it.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Over and over and over again. Yes, Lord.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that is proof
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; of the connection to the unseen.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus promised.
[1:46:57] Now, this was in the trial. Let notice
[1:47:00] where I'm going. In the trial,
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus promised that as it was in the
[1:47:06] days of Noah and as it was in the days
[1:47:08] of Lot,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; it would be in the days in the last
[1:47:11] days.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; So what it was in Noah's time, what it
[1:47:14] was in Lot's time, it would be in the
[1:47:16] last days. He said, what happened to
[1:47:18] Abraham would return back again to
[1:47:20] Abraham's royal seed, which is which is
[1:47:23] Christ. Christ returning in the form of
[1:47:26] the word
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; working in human beings.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:31] Christ,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; back again,
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; working in a human being
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; and showing the sign that he promised it
[1:47:41] would. He said it would do. He promised
[1:47:44] that it would do it and God promised it
[1:47:46] and God will keep his promise. And God
[1:47:49] did it.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; God did it.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a witness. I saw it.
[1:47:54] [Applause]
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's fine.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You rejoice. Let this sink in deep.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Now, it's like a class this morning. The
[1:48:08] immutability of his counsel.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; And the immutability
[1:48:13] is a very interesting word. I've been
[1:48:15] wrestling with it. Yes, sir.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; I've been wrestling with it for many,
[1:48:19] many hours over the last couple days.
[1:48:23] The immutability
[1:48:26] in the Greek
[1:48:28] essentially it's not changing
[1:48:31] or not able to be changed.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. His counsel
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; his word
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; his promise or his his counsel can't be
[1:48:43] changed.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; But this is very very interesting and
[1:48:46] this is where you need to hang on to me.
[1:48:49] Hang on to what I'm saying for this
[1:48:51] moment.
[1:48:52] So it's unchangeable
[1:48:55] not to be transferred,
[1:48:57] not to be. It's fixed.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; It's unalterable.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; His counsel God more willing, abundantly
[1:49:06] willing to show to the heirs of the
[1:49:09] promise. If you're not heirs of the
[1:49:11] promise, you can forget it. But to show
[1:49:13] to the heirs, what does he want to show
[1:49:14] to the pro to the heirs of the promise?
[1:49:17] The immutability.
[1:49:19] My words will not change.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Governments may change, nations may
[1:49:27] change, wars may happen, all kinds of
[1:49:30] things, turmoil may take place, but my
[1:49:33] counsel cannot change.
[1:49:37] [Applause]
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the Lord.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; But that that word is a that word is a
[1:49:48] derivative from this and this is where
[1:49:51] the difficulty comes but I hope I will
[1:49:54] be able to make it clear to you. It's a
[1:49:56] derivative of a a second Greek word.
[1:50:00] And the second Greek word is to to
[1:50:03] translate,
[1:50:05] to carry over,
[1:50:08] to to remove,
[1:50:11] to change. This is where the difficulty
[1:50:14] is.
[1:50:15] It's immutable. It cannot be changed.
[1:50:17] It's unalterable. It's fixed. But it
[1:50:20] comes from this
[1:50:23] other Greek word which I won't even
[1:50:24] attempt to say it. But also to transpose
[1:50:28] and here here's the key.
[1:50:31] Two things
[1:50:33] one of which is put in the place of the
[1:50:36] other.
[1:50:38] Two things
[1:50:40] to transfer. He said the Greek says to
[1:50:44] transfer oneself or to suffer oneself to
[1:50:50] suffer or to allow oneself
[1:50:53] to be transferred
[1:51:04] in music.
[1:51:07] They may
[1:51:09] transpose. Is that the word?
[1:51:14] The lyrics are immutable.
[1:51:18] They shall not be changed from the
[1:51:20] author
[1:51:22] who received the inspiration.
[1:51:25] And here's the lyrics of the song.
[1:51:28] And the author perhaps sang it
[1:51:32] with their beautiful
[1:51:35] voice or whatever. But now down through
[1:51:38] the times,
[1:51:40] I don't think we sing Amazing Grace.
[1:51:42] Perhaps the way
[1:51:45] who was it that composed it,
[1:51:49] the way perhaps he sang it. But the
[1:51:52] lyrics are the same.
[1:51:55] This is immutable.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; If you change it, you haven't got the
[1:51:58] same song.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; But the lyrics are immutable. But you
[1:52:02] may transpose the music so another
[1:52:06] person can sing it.
[1:52:09] And so the other person it is as though
[1:52:12] they have been transferred.
[1:52:16] The person who now sings it may not be
[1:52:19] they may change the key they transpose
[1:52:22] it but the next person will pick it up
[1:52:26] and sing it but the lyrics remain
[1:52:29] exactly the same.
[1:52:31] Now, God's word is absolutely immutable.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; It's unalterable.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; It is fixed.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; But as time went on,
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; God would raise up someone to define or
[1:52:47] to perhaps redefine
[1:52:50] exactly what the promise was saying.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; But in the end time,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; there was a promise
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; made by Jesus Christ himself.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you see the days of Noah once
[1:53:03] again,
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; and when you see the days of Lot once
[1:53:07] again, even so shall it be when I, the
[1:53:11] son of man, shall be revealed,
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; a different season,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; hundreds of years apart,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; but it's the same one
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; that will transfer,
[1:53:24] [Applause]
[1:53:29] it had to be a prophet. prophet that
[1:53:31] could utter the words of God
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; and that Christ himself could reveal
[1:53:37] himself through the vessel
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; and thus the immutability of his will
[1:53:43] the promise remained absolutely
[1:53:46] irrevocably
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; unalterable
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; but the vessel
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; that has been used
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; to achieve the same thing that's right
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; it's not a different word.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; It's not a different promise.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; It's the same promise, the same
[1:54:06] immutable word that now has been
[1:54:08] transposed. As it said, one suffers
[1:54:12] himself to be removed to another one to
[1:54:16] take the place of.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; I'm just starting.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:29] That is why this vessel said
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; and I heard him and you can hear it on
[1:54:36] tape
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; and I have some quotes.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; That is my voice.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; But that is not me speaking.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; This is the other part of the
[1:54:53] immutability.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will transpose himself
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; transfer
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; move himself
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; into another age into another generation
[1:55:07] to another people at the end time when
[1:55:10] the conditions are right and Lot's time
[1:55:12] is there and Noah's time now not
[1:55:14] localized in Palestine but throughout
[1:55:17] the whole earth.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. And that is why the vessel
[1:55:26] would have to say that's me.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; That's my voice but it's not me
[1:55:32] speaking.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; That's your connection.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Whoever it was that was speaking
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; that's the one who's called you.
[1:55:53] That's why you're here.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; That's why you believe what you believe.
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what separates you from all
[1:56:02] others.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And I pray that'll become a revelation
[1:56:07] to you.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Is true.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; To transfer oneself
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; or to suffer or allow oneself to be
[1:56:25] transferred.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; He allowed himself to be transferred.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Message believers. Listen close. Now
[1:56:46] in Revelation 10, won't turn to it, just
[1:56:49] listen to me
[1:56:51] in verse one, Revelation 10,
[1:56:55] the angel of the covenant, the mighty
[1:56:57] angel is descending,
[1:57:00] the prophet of God says clearly, it's
[1:57:02] Christ.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; In the verse two, he's holding a open
[1:57:07] book in his hand which had been closed
[1:57:09] in chapter five.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:12] In verse three, he cries with a loud
[1:57:14] voice.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Hold this now, class.
[1:57:19] He cries with a loud voice as a lion
[1:57:21] roar. Because the lion is king.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; he's coming into his kingship. And seven
[1:57:28] thunders uttered their voices. Seven
[1:57:30] thunders uttered their voices.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:35] Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; And when they thought it had thundered
[1:57:38] in John's gospel, when a voice spoke out
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; confirming that I have glorified it and
[1:57:45] will glorify it again,
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; it was it was a voice from the unseen
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; speaking of Christ himself. And when he
[1:57:55] cried with a loud voice, this angel,
[1:57:57] this messenger, which was Christ, seven
[1:57:59] thunders uttered their voices because
[1:58:01] the book was sealed with seven seals. So
[1:58:04] there had to be seven voices, seven
[1:58:07] thunders. And they said that some said
[1:58:09] it thundered, but it was the voice of
[1:58:11] God speaking.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; And I was about to write. John was about
[1:58:16] to write. And I heard a voice from
[1:58:18] heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those
[1:58:21] things and write them not." All right.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:58:27] sea and upon the earth, listen closely
[1:58:30] now, lifted up his hand
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; to heaven and swear
[1:58:36] by him that liveth
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; forever and ever.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; This is the same one that made the oath
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; to Abraham.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; And now he's coming to Abraham's
[1:58:49] children.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. And John is writing a
[1:58:53] prophetic word that this shall take
[1:58:55] place in the end time. Jesus said, "When
[1:58:58] you see the days of Noah and you see the
[1:59:00] days of Sodom again, that's the day I'll
[1:59:02] be revealed." Now, we have a prophet and
[1:59:04] he says, "Revelation 10, here he comes.
[1:59:07] It's him descending."
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10, a mighty angel
[1:59:11] descending. He's got the book in his
[1:59:14] hand. It's now open. The seals have been
[1:59:18] open. And John is about to write its
[1:59:20] content. Said, "Don't write it.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; These thunders will be uttered."
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; The truth of the word, seven of them
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; said, "Seal it up until the end time."
[1:59:32] And this angel put one foot on the land
[1:59:35] and one on the sea,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; raised his hand, and swore by him that
[1:59:41] liveth forever and ever.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; That and this is what he this is what he
[1:59:46] what he put up. And there he said he'd
[1:59:49] swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:59:51] ever that there should be no longer
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; time. That there should be time no
[1:59:58] longer. If you read the dagot of the
[2:00:00] Greek, you'll say no longer delay
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; when this happens. There'll be no longer
[2:00:08] a delay
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; for those things that the thunders have
[2:00:11] uttered, those voices of God. When that
[2:00:14] time comes,
[2:00:18] Hallelujah.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; You readers of the message and you
[2:00:29] we find new things all the time.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And I I I made an incredible discovery.
[2:00:38] I thought
[2:00:40] Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the
[2:00:42] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[2:00:44] shall begin to sound all the mysteries,
[2:00:46] well, that's the that that's the
[2:00:47] fundamental of this message. I wonder I
[2:00:51] wonder when brother Brandham I I wonder
[2:00:53] when he first referred to this covenant
[2:00:56] angel of Revelation 10:1. I wonder saw
[2:00:59] another mighty angel. So I put down
[2:01:01] another mighty angel descend
[2:01:07] first time. First time
[2:01:10] in the message,
[2:01:13] sir.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Is this the time?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; I thought, well, that can't be.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; it was in this end of 1962. He must have
[2:01:25] said that hundreds of times. So, I
[2:01:28] punched in Revelation 10:7.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[2:01:33] seventh angel,
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; same message, sir. Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Is this a sign of the end?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Is this the time?
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; That's the title of the message. Is this
[2:01:46] the time?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And the one that swore, he said, the
[2:01:50] time
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; given
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; shall be no longer.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; And here's the prophet of God. Now, he
[2:01:56] enters into one of the one of the most
[2:01:58] astounding of his experiences in vision
[2:02:00] form. In vision form. Listen. You
[2:02:04] believe what he said?
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:08] He's in his room and his wife is
[2:02:11] knocking actually rattling the door to
[2:02:13] get his attention. Want just wanted to
[2:02:16] see if say something.
[2:02:20] He'd been caught up
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; into a consolation.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Of seven angels.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And left him trembling. He said he's
[2:02:32] over in the corner
[2:02:34] and he has his Bible open. Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; He said it seemed to the last verse of
[2:02:40] Romans 9.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Now, how do you have a Bible open to one
[2:02:45] verse?
[2:02:47] That was the verse that he at this time
[2:02:50] in this particular instance
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; was directed to. Behold,
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; I lay in Zion
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; a stumbling stone.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:02] rock of offense
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; because God was announcing. I'm laying
[2:03:08] down my word. There will come a time.
[2:03:11] I'll lay it down. I'll confirm it again.
[2:03:14] I'll swear with an oath.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; The immutability of my will and my
[2:03:19] counsel,
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; but I'll transpose myself and use a
[2:03:24] different vessel to say the same thing.
[2:03:28] [Music]
[2:03:31] Thank you.
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Is this a sign of the end, sir?
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; And a short time later,
[2:03:52] he's in Arizona.
[2:03:55] Others are there as witnesses. Yeah.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; And the great cloud picture which you
[2:04:00] are so accustomed to seeing
[2:04:04] happened.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; He's literally caught into
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; that constellation.
[2:04:10] Now you can say, well, you know what? I
[2:04:12] doubt that. I don't know about that. I
[2:04:15] wasn't there. I didn't see it. That's
[2:04:17] all fine.
[2:04:19] But do you know that from that time to
[2:04:21] the end of his life that same connection
[2:04:24] with the unseen remained absolutely
[2:04:27] intact?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know that pillar of fire remained
[2:04:32] in constant in constant attendance with
[2:04:35] that same messenger?
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; And how would God who cannot lie?
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; How could he come and confirm something
[2:04:44] that wasn't the truth? He cannot do
[2:04:46] that.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? No. In fact, as he
[2:04:49] was doing the opposite, he was
[2:04:50] confirming the immutability of his
[2:04:52] counsel. I cannot change.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And this is what it said in the word.
[2:04:58] And here's the vessel I'm fulfilling it
[2:05:00] through.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Have you been able to follow me thus
[2:05:05] far?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Just just a few minutes.
[2:05:18] and he swear by him that liveth. And to
[2:05:21] swear is to affirm a promise with an
[2:05:23] oath. In swearing to call a person or a
[2:05:27] thing as a witness
[2:05:30] in the you have to follow me very close.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now in the trial in the message
[2:05:35] of trial
[2:05:38] in 1964 just within 12 months or so 15
[2:05:42] months of this time
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; he said we got so many witnesses we
[2:05:46] could call but if you'll excuse me I'd
[2:05:48] like to be his next witness.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; I'd like to put myself up for his
[2:05:53] witness.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; If you if I if if it don't sound too
[2:05:58] personal I'm his witness.
[2:06:01] I want to be his next his fifth witness.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; You know his position. He knew who he
[2:06:09] was. He knew what he was called to do.
[2:06:11] So he spoke the trial. And Satan as a as
[2:06:15] a pro as a prosecutor. And he says,
[2:06:17] "I'll be his witness."
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; There was never anyone that had more
[2:06:22] substantial evidence that could be a
[2:06:24] witness.
[2:06:28] That's true.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; And then in the first seal, he said,
[2:06:31] "The entire mystery is unfolded."
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's the ministry of that angel.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Be so simple, people. Just drop off the
[2:06:40] top of it. He said, "People won't
[2:06:41] understand it." In other words, but yet
[2:06:43] it'll be perfectly a vindicated
[2:06:45] everywhere. Just be perfectly normal.
[2:06:48] Everybody that wants to see it can see
[2:06:51] it.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Why don't we say that together?
[2:06:54] Everybody who wants to see it can see
[2:06:57] it.
[2:06:59] [Applause]
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Friends,
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; you might ask,
[2:07:11] I've had people say, "What sustains you,
[2:07:14] Brother Ed?
[2:07:16] What sustains you over the time you've
[2:07:19] gone through and the things that have
[2:07:21] been said? What sustains you? The unseen
[2:07:24] sustains me.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; The fact that I believe in a messenger
[2:07:28] that is connected to the unseen.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; I have a reverence for that word. I have
[2:07:34] a love for that word and may you may
[2:07:37] miss a whole lot of things in life. But
[2:07:39] if you love that word
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; and sers is just the time
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; just give a few more moments.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; He said in the 10th chapter of the book
[2:07:55] of the revelation of Jesus Christ I wish
[2:07:58] to read a few verses. The first seven
[2:08:00] verses 1 to7 first time
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; he did it.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the message he's asking
[2:08:08] the congregation he says and I am going
[2:08:10] almost like presumptuous myself he said
[2:08:14] because of the strange event that is
[2:08:16] taking place he said but sers is this
[2:08:19] the time
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; is this the time for this to happen
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; is this the time for revelation 10 to
[2:08:27] happen is this what's happened is this
[2:08:30] what these angels that have come from
[2:08:32] heaven and they took a picture it's in
[2:08:34] the life magazine it says the
[2:08:36] encyclopedia.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; I've had uh
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; critics
[2:08:44] come and say to me,
[2:08:46] "That cloud,
[2:08:49] that cloud was in the heavens."
[2:08:52] It was 30 miles high. I believe it was
[2:08:54] 27 miles across.
[2:08:56] And this man actually came and
[2:08:58] fellowshipped with us in the early days.
[2:09:01] He was an engineer of some kind. Had to
[2:09:03] do things very, very specifically. and
[2:09:06] he got questioning the cloud
[2:09:09] and he said uh he came back to me and he
[2:09:12] has a whole book on it. He said they
[2:09:15] they there was a missile destroyed uh
[2:09:18] from Edwards Air Force Base in
[2:09:20] California and the winds that re that
[2:09:24] that were pre prevalent that day would
[2:09:27] have put the debris at that approximate
[2:09:30] location at that time. I said, "Uh,
[2:09:33] okay."
[2:09:35] I said, "The scripture says Elijah,
[2:09:38] Elisha, Elijah said to his servant, "Go
[2:09:41] out and tell me what you see."
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see a little cloud
[2:09:49] rising from the ground."
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; What else is the shape of a man's hand?
[2:09:57] I said to this critic, I said, "What
[2:09:59] what what was that cloud? Was it mist?
[2:10:05] What formed the cloud?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; You don't know.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; He was totally silent. I said, I'm not
[2:10:13] interested what formed the cloud. I'm
[2:10:15] interested in what the cloud
[2:10:17] represented.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; And what Elijah needed to hear, it's the
[2:10:21] shape of a man's hand.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; He didn't say where did it come from.
[2:10:25] Did it come off the water? Did it come
[2:10:26] from the dew? Did it come that was irre
[2:10:29] irrelevant. It was what was relevant is
[2:10:32] the right people were there looking at
[2:10:34] it.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; What I'm telling you what was relevant
[2:10:38] is that God's messenger never won was
[2:10:41] like this
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; since Jesus Christ out in the desert in
[2:10:46] the wilderness and here's the cloud. I
[2:10:48] don't care what made it.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; But when you look at it and I saw it for
[2:10:52] the first time when it was turned and he
[2:10:54] said, "Have you seen this?" And he
[2:10:56] turned it. He said, "Now what do you
[2:10:57] see?" Both my wife and I sitting there.
[2:10:59] We saw the head of Jesus Christ, the
[2:11:01] face of Jesus Christ.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; And it's Jesus Christ that was
[2:11:05] descending in Revelation 10:1. And e
[2:11:08] even in the vision now in the vision in
[2:11:11] his room, he comes out in December, end
[2:11:14] of December, end of December 1962.
[2:11:20] He says, "Uh, it is so strange.
[2:11:24] I I don't know what it is.
[2:11:27] Perhaps it's the end of my life. It's a
[2:11:28] great explosion.
[2:11:31] And and angels, he said, they came. I I
[2:11:35] looked into eternity
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; and they came like little dots in just a
[2:11:41] splash
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; and a moment of time.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Said, he said, I didn't have time to
[2:11:46] count. He said, it was not less than
[2:11:49] five and not more than seven
[2:11:52] mighty angels.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; He said, I was caught up into it
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; and I was left in the vision. And I was
[2:11:58] left in the corner. I was in the corner
[2:12:00] of the room with my Bible open. It
[2:12:03] seemed to be ro He's speaking this just
[2:12:06] after it happened. It seemed it was
[2:12:07] Romans the 9th chapter, the last verse.
[2:12:11] Behold, I lay in Zion
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; a stone.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's what God was doing.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; He was laying in Zion a a stone.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; The word once again,
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; you with me?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; And about two months later in Arizona,
[2:12:32] here it happens.
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "They took the picture. We
[2:12:39] didn't take it."
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; How about when the Pillar of Fire, you
[2:12:44] know, Brother John has thrown up this on
[2:12:45] the screen many times. Uh, Brother
[2:12:47] Brandham in Houston, Texas, and the Sam
[2:12:49] Houston uh arena when the and brother
[2:12:53] Brandon wasn't even on the platform.
[2:12:54] They were going to have a debate.
[2:12:56] and FF Bossworth took the debate and the
[2:13:00] debate was over in just a few moments
[2:13:02] because Reverend Best, a Baptist
[2:13:04] minister, had his had his group and had
[2:13:06] his photographer there from Douglas
[2:13:08] Studios to take a picture. He said, "I
[2:13:11] want you to take the picture when I have
[2:13:13] my finger at William Brandon's nose
[2:13:17] declaring him to be a false prophet."
[2:13:25] Brother Brandham said, "I don't want any
[2:13:27] arguing over the word." FF Bosworth
[2:13:30] said, "There'll be no arguing."
[2:13:34] And FF Bosworth, he said to Reverend
[2:13:36] Best, you you can be the first speaker.
[2:13:39] Each one was going to take, I think, 20
[2:13:41] minutes or whatever, and then the next
[2:13:44] one would have opportunity to respond.
[2:13:47] But if if if he took first, then he
[2:13:50] wouldn't have the last place to respond.
[2:13:52] So he said to FF Bosworth, you speak
[2:13:55] first.
[2:13:57] So it was on divine healing.
[2:14:01] And FF Bosworth, a great stately
[2:14:05] man,
[2:14:07] godly man of the word. And he said, "I
[2:14:11] would like to ask our honored guest just
[2:14:15] one question,
[2:14:18] and I would like him to answer that
[2:14:20] question just yes or no."
[2:14:24] This is the question.
[2:14:27] Do all the redemptive names of Jehovah
[2:14:30] of the Old Testament
[2:14:33] refer to Jesus in the New?
[2:14:37] and he saw himself trapped because if he
[2:14:40] said no, it would mean that Jesus was
[2:14:42] not savior. If he said yes, it would
[2:14:46] mean he's also healer.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't answer that." He said,
[2:14:52] "Br bring on that bring on that divine
[2:14:55] healer."
[2:14:56] No, the panel said, "Answer the
[2:14:58] question."
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; So, make a long story short, it was over
[2:15:02] in a few minutes.
[2:15:04] And they handed the they handed the
[2:15:07] debate to brother Bosworth. And brother
[2:15:10] Bosworth see you've seen the picture so
[2:15:12] many many times but brother Bosworth
[2:15:14] said I don't know if brother Brandham
[2:15:16] came to the meeting of the thousands of
[2:15:18] people in the arena. And brother
[2:15:20] Brandham told me himself
[2:15:23] this account. He said, "I was up high in
[2:15:25] the in the not in the balconies, but in
[2:15:28] the U
[2:15:30] stadium
[2:15:32] in the bleachers
[2:15:34] and he said, I was uh just sitting there
[2:15:38] and he said, I just felt something
[2:15:40] urging me, you should go down." So he
[2:15:44] went down. He has that little piece of
[2:15:45] paper in his hand about this size right
[2:15:47] here.
[2:15:50] And you could take and look at that
[2:15:51] picture when you leave here. go and get
[2:15:53] it
[2:15:54] because I want to remind you about
[2:15:56] something. And so he's standing there
[2:15:59] with this little piece of paper and he
[2:16:02] said, "I
[2:16:04] I have never uh
[2:16:08] claimed to be a divine healer."
[2:16:11] He said, "But I do believe in in divine
[2:16:13] healing." He said, ' And I'm sure that
[2:16:16] our our good friend, Reverend Best,
[2:16:19] would not want to be called a divine
[2:16:21] savior,
[2:16:23] but he certainly believes in salvation.
[2:16:27] And he said, "It is true
[2:16:30] that uh visitation,
[2:16:33] an angel from God has visited me and
[2:16:37] ministered this gift to me." And he just
[2:16:40] stopped and said, "Just a moment.
[2:16:46] The one of whom I speak is here."
[2:16:51] And it came right down. That pillar of
[2:16:53] fire came right down one of the aisles
[2:16:56] of that great auditorium. And some saw
[2:17:01] it and some did not.
[2:17:03] Brother Brandham said, "Women screamed
[2:17:05] and some fainted and others didn't see a
[2:17:08] thing. and it came right up and hung
[2:17:11] over his head. And when you look at the
[2:17:14] picture, I've said this many times, I'm
[2:17:16] saying it to you again. When you look at
[2:17:18] the picture, one thing that's very
[2:17:21] outstanding is that the profile of
[2:17:24] brother Brandham,
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; the piece of paper he's holding in his
[2:17:28] hand is just crisp
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; and clear with its in its definition of
[2:17:34] of of the edges. But the pillar of fire
[2:17:38] because brother Brandham said it's
[2:17:39] always moving.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; It's whirling pillar of fire over his
[2:17:43] head and it's blurred.
[2:17:47] And when they took the of all the
[2:17:50] pictures that were taken by Douglas
[2:17:52] Studios cameraman took it to Douglas
[2:17:55] Studios. They had the gathering and
[2:17:59] Reverend Best was there. FF Bosworth was
[2:18:01] there. Brother Brandham was there. They
[2:18:04] called them because he he had the
[2:18:08] film was was was developed and of all
[2:18:12] the pictures only one picture
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; developed and it was that one.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; He says God would not share
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; himself with another.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And uh and when they came out after
[2:18:28] examination of it they said who's
[2:18:30] William Brham? Brother Bam said, "I am,
[2:18:32] sir." He said, "I want to present you
[2:18:34] with the first known picture of a
[2:18:37] supernatural being." And he said, "Well,
[2:18:39] I I'm sorry, but he said, it's not it
[2:18:42] it's not my picture. It was taken by
[2:18:44] this man from Douglas Studios." He said,
[2:18:46] "If I may, I would like to make one
[2:18:48] request that is never sold that it's
[2:18:51] never sold for a profit. If people would
[2:18:55] like to have one, then that it would be
[2:18:57] available to them." That picture is in
[2:19:01] Washington DC. One of our brothers went
[2:19:04] to Washington and it is there in the
[2:19:06] archives in Washington DC. It is the
[2:19:10] only known photograph of a supernatural
[2:19:13] being. Why am I saying all this?
[2:19:17] While we look not at the things which
[2:19:20] are seen but the things which are
[2:19:22] unseen. Amen.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, if these were even
[2:19:26] my last words, as believers,
[2:19:30] we have a connection.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; With the unseen,
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; with the invisible,
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; and it should give you great confidence
[2:19:39] and also great thanksgiving should well
[2:19:43] up in our hearts that God brought you to
[2:19:46] that place where you could have that
[2:19:48] realization.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; May God bless you.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] Hallelujah.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; I would like to sing if we could.
[2:20:16] There is an unseen hand.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; But if you would stand, I'd like to have
[2:20:20] prayer first.
[2:20:29] Father, this has been a different
[2:20:31] service, a different service for me and
[2:20:34] perhaps a different service for many of
[2:20:36] the people that are here. But I felt it
[2:20:39] was a critical service. I felt it was
[2:20:43] very very important.
[2:20:47] It was essential that there is a
[2:20:50] confirmation
[2:20:52] that these children of the royal seed of
[2:20:55] Abraham
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; would know that you were not ashamed
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; to come before the heirs of the promise
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; and show yourself immutable in your
[2:21:06] counsel. And yet then you could take one
[2:21:10] born again,
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; one that was forgiven the same as all
[2:21:14] others need to be forgiven and take and
[2:21:17] use him and transpose yourself, oh God,
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; in such a way so that you have a vessel
[2:21:23] in our time, speaking openly over the
[2:21:27] years and decades, thus saith the Lord.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Irrefutable proofs
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; over and over. again. Father, we're so
[2:21:36] thankful. We're so thankful. I want to
[2:21:40] stand before this congregation today and
[2:21:42] say thank you, Lord, on my own behalf.
[2:21:45] Thank you that you called. Thank you
[2:21:48] that we've seen what we've seen, Lord.
[2:21:50] And we're not looking at the things
[2:21:52] which are visible, temporal, passing
[2:21:55] away, perishing, but we're looking to
[2:21:58] the eternal.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; For the people that are here today,
[2:22:02] Lord, how I thank you for them.
[2:22:04] for their prayers, for their strength,
[2:22:06] for their encouragement. Thank you for
[2:22:08] their presence here today. And I pray,
[2:22:10] oh God, that you'll bless them for their
[2:22:13] sacrifice. I'm asking even now that
[2:22:15] you'll take brother Dioa in your hand.
[2:22:18] Cause him to utter things that are not
[2:22:20] even in his mind. Cause him to speak
[2:22:23] what you'd have him to speak to the
[2:22:25] people tonight, Father. And as everyone
[2:22:28] gathers, I pray that it will be a Holy
[2:22:30] Ghost time. May it be a Holy Ghost
[2:22:32] moment.
[2:22:34] Yes Lord.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; For surely
[2:22:37] we will not ask is this the time
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; for the sign of the end.
[2:22:43] We will say it is the time.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; It is the time.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; It is the time.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; It is taking place
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; and we find ourselves in that moment
[2:22:54] in Jesus Christ's name. Bless the people
[2:22:57] I pray.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Bless the visitors, oh God.
[2:23:01] May your grace be upon us all
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:10] Before we sing,
[2:23:13] I want to say to you
[2:23:18] as a friend, as a father, as a pastor, I
[2:23:21] want to say to you,
[2:23:25] we are
[2:23:27] indescribably
[2:23:29] privileged people.
[2:23:32] And what you say, you say, well, we have
[2:23:34] the the next time you hear that, you
[2:23:36] know, the message this and the message
[2:23:37] that and the message something else,
[2:23:39] please remember this one thing. God has
[2:23:43] permitted you to actually see.
[2:23:47] Let's not talk about the tech age of
[2:23:50] technology
[2:23:52] or the other age of entertainment.
[2:23:55] You've actually seen the age. You've
[2:23:58] seen the immutability. You've seen the
[2:24:01] visible
[2:24:02] immutability
[2:24:04] of Almighty God. You have had an
[2:24:07] opportunity to view.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; The swearing of Almighty God.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; That I change not.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; No wonder he preached the same thing.
[2:24:20] Same thing.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; God cannot change.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; You have seen that, friends. Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; We're not just seeing some doctrine or
[2:24:30] seeing some, you know, another group of
[2:24:33] people. That's not what we're here for.
[2:24:35] That's not what we're seeing. We're
[2:24:37] connected to a
[2:24:40] invisible unseen realm.
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; I hope it's not too strong for you.
[2:24:48] [Music]
[2:24:59] Have a good look at me.
[2:25:04] I stood beside this vessel.
[2:25:09] I stood beside this prophet vessel when
[2:25:12] a horse was trying to kill a man,
[2:25:16] my friend, brother Bud Southwick,
[2:25:20] and struck him on the chest with both
[2:25:22] front hooves.
[2:25:24] And I said, "Brother Brother," I said,
[2:25:26] "That horse is going to kill brother
[2:25:31] Bud."
[2:25:33] Yeah. He said, "He is mean, isn't he?"
[2:25:36] [Music]
[2:25:37] And that horse had bucked and had ruined
[2:25:40] gear and had broken saddles and done all
[2:25:43] kinds of damage already the day before.
[2:25:46] Now he was actually after brother
[2:25:48] Southwick
[2:25:50] and I saw brother Southwick. I saw the
[2:25:52] horse start to tremble in his flanks in
[2:25:56] his his whole flank start to tremble. I
[2:25:59] know a horse will do that when he's
[2:26:01] filled with fear.
[2:26:03] And and brother Bud is saddling him and
[2:26:07] getting all the pack on him and getting
[2:26:09] the tarp. And when you when you have a
[2:26:11] horse like that, if you get the tarp and
[2:26:13] throw the tarp over, he goes crazy. And
[2:26:16] he gets a tarp on and he starts to cinch
[2:26:18] him up.
[2:26:20] I thought he he's got him. He's saddling
[2:26:23] him up. I I I turn I said, "Oh."
[2:26:27] Brother Brandham just had his head
[2:26:30] turned, had his hat off,
[2:26:33] and turned around, slid his hat back on
[2:26:35] his head.
[2:26:38] Do you see me? That horse become a
[2:26:41] kitten.
[2:26:43] That horse become the most timid animal
[2:26:46] that you could imagine. From that
[2:26:48] moment,
[2:26:52] he was like an old pet
[2:26:55] that never gave a moment's problem from
[2:26:58] that moment forward. Listen, folks, who
[2:27:00] is that?
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; What is that? That's not a man. That's
[2:27:05] not a man from Jeffersonville. Indeed,
[2:27:07] it is. It's William Brandham. But that's
[2:27:08] not what's in him.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; It's the one who can control the
[2:27:13] animals. It is. It is the restoration of
[2:27:17] Eden once again to take control of all
[2:27:20] things.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; You see me?
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; I sat 4 days in a storm.
[2:27:28] I had that same man walk up to me and
[2:27:31] say, "This is on account of me and it's
[2:27:34] all over."
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; And we will ride out of here dry. Four
[2:27:39] days of drenching rain in the mountains.
[2:27:42] We'll ride out of here dry. I I I I was
[2:27:45] stunned. I didn't I couldn't even say
[2:27:47] anything. You say, "Were you believing?
[2:27:48] You're disbelieving? You don't have any
[2:27:50] chance to say anything." Do you see me?
[2:27:52] 20 minutes.
[2:27:55] 20 minutes from that time.
[2:27:57] I was sitting there and a poof, a little
[2:28:02] puff of wind went by. I thought, "My
[2:28:05] that was warm.
[2:28:08] That was unusually warm." And then they
[2:28:10] start to blow a little bit like this.
[2:28:12] Within 20 minutes, there's a big blue
[2:28:15] hole in the sky. And before we before my
[2:28:19] horse took its first step, I was peeling
[2:28:22] off my my jacket into my shirt sleeves
[2:28:26] and rode for eight hours bone dry.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Who is that?
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; That's the same one.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; Transposed into another vessel. I hope
[2:28:39] you understand this so you could
[2:28:41] misunderstand it. If you do, forgive me,
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; it's a man
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; saved by grace,
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; adopted son of God,
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; like you and I.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; But that power that was in him was the
[2:28:57] same one who spoke to the storm 2,000
[2:29:00] years ago and said, "Peace be still."
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that, come and tell
[2:29:06] me what it was. Amen.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; Come and tell me what it was.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; And the same one who took the words and
[2:29:14] said, "My words will never pass away."
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; He's the one who came and swore in this
[2:29:22] time.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; The immutability.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; These things are true. And now I confirm
[2:29:31] it to Abraham's children.
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Royal seed. God bless you. Royalty of
[2:29:38] Abraham, God bless you.

[2:29:50] an
[2:29:54] seed

[2:30:02] in ways
[2:30:05] I cannot see
[2:30:10] while going through
[2:30:16] this world
[2:30:20] [Music]

[2:30:24] [Music]

[2:31:33] thy will
[2:31:36] [Music]

[2:35:27] I don't get a chance to shake hands with
[2:35:29] all of you here
[2:35:31] who meet on that on that shore.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; It's come pretty clear.
[2:35:39] You talk about it really being defined.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; The same messenger
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; saw millions
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; and said, "I saw you over there."
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:51] [Music]
[2:35:52] [Applause]
[2:35:53] [Music]
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; I bit my finger. He said,
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; squeezed my hand. Had all my hair back.
[2:36:03] Ah, that's where we want to go.
[2:36:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Darren, do you want to just come
[2:36:11] and dismiss us
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; in prayer?
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; And we'll see you tonight, Lord willing,
[2:36:18] 5:00 out at the camp. I trust you can
[2:36:21] all be there. We're going to have a
[2:36:22] glorious time.
[2:36:26] Let's bow our heads.
[2:36:30] Heavenly Father, we are indeed a
[2:36:32] privileged people. We are a blessed
[2:36:34] people.
[2:36:36] And Lord God, we show our appreciation
[2:36:40] by saying thank you by worshiping you,
[2:36:43] by laying down our lies, by casting
[2:36:45] aside our own reasonings, our own
[2:36:48] understandings, Father. And we say,
[2:36:50] Lord, just fill us, just feed us, Lord.
[2:36:53] All we want is your word. Take this
[2:36:55] whole world, but give us Jesus Christ.
[2:36:57] Give us that revealed word, dear Lord,
[2:37:00] that that same life that was manifested
[2:37:02] in the prophet would be manifested in
[2:37:04] us, Lord. was at first fruits. Lord,
[2:37:07] we're the harvest, Father. We're part of
[2:37:10] your children. We're Abraham's children.
[2:37:13] Children of the promise, dear God. And
[2:37:14] we've heard about the promise this
[2:37:16] morning. We heard about our our new
[2:37:18] home, dear Lord. We heard about the
[2:37:20] promises you have in store for us, Lord.
[2:37:22] And they are within reach, Father.
[2:37:25] They're closer than they've ever been
[2:37:26] before, Lord. So it behooves us, dear
[2:37:29] God, to stretch forth, to reach forth
[2:37:31] for those promises, dear God, to claim
[2:37:34] them, to walk in them, Lord, to meditate
[2:37:36] upon them, Father, that that word, dear
[2:37:39] God, would manifest itself in our lives.
[2:37:42] That our theophanes would just be
[2:37:44] manifested around us, dear God. And one
[2:37:46] day, Lord, we'll be caught away. One
[2:37:49] day, dear God, that promise will be
[2:37:51] manifested. That there will be a
[2:37:53] catching away, dear God, that will be
[2:37:55] changed. will be transformed in the
[2:37:57] atoms, Lord.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's the next greatest thing
[2:38:00] that we're looking for, dear Lord, is a
[2:38:03] change of these bodies,
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, where we can truly have that rest.
[2:38:08] We can live in peace, Lord, with the
[2:38:10] saints on high,
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; Lord. But while it is still called this
[2:38:14] day, dear God, while we are still in the
[2:38:16] battle, Lord, just give us the strength
[2:38:19] to keep pressing on.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Give our pastor strength, Lord. We so
[2:38:23] appreciate the man of God. We appreciate
[2:38:25] the gift that you've given him, Lord.
[2:38:28] That gift is for us. That gift is to
[2:38:31] bless us. That gift is to strengthen us.
[2:38:33] To give us eyesab, dear God, to look to
[2:38:36] the unseen, Lord, to get our eyes off
[2:38:39] our natural existence, Lord, to get our
[2:38:42] eyes off of our problems, off our
[2:38:44] situations, off our trials. And dear
[2:38:46] God, while we look to these things, dear
[2:38:49] God, these things will work for us, dear
[2:38:51] God. These things will perfect us, Lord.
[2:38:54] We thank you for your word. We ask, dear
[2:38:57] God, that you would go with us, Lord.
[2:38:58] And we pray that you'll give us
[2:39:00] traveling mercies as we'd head down to
[2:39:02] the camp. We pray your blessings upon
[2:39:04] brother Doka, Lord, as he's prepared his
[2:39:06] heart. We just expect, Lord God, there
[2:39:09] just be a continuation of your presence,
[2:39:11] a continuation of worship, of giving of
[2:39:14] thanks to you, Father, from the depths
[2:39:17] of our souls. So go with your children
[2:39:19] now. I pray, Father, bless each one as
[2:39:22] we go our way now in Jesus Christ's
[2:39:24] name. Amen.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Thank you, Father.
[2:39:30] So, you're dismissed in Jesus name. I'd
[2:39:32] like to just say to the deacons, perhaps
[2:39:34] you can take the offering baskets, if
[2:39:37] you would, to the to the camp. We don't
[2:39:39] have any other way. We'd like to receive
[2:39:41] an offering tonight. And so, God bless
[2:39:44] you. You're dismissed. Have a nice
[2:39:46] afternoon. And after the service
[2:39:48] tonight, they're going to have a little
[2:39:50] snack or something in the uh in the uh
[2:39:54] dining hall. And so uh you can expect
[2:39:57] that also. Won't send you home too
[2:39:59] hungry. God bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:40:04] God bless you, brother John.
