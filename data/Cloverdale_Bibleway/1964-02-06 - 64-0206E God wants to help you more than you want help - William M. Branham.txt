Description:
64-0206E  God's Provided Way For This Day: William Marrion Branham
Video clip with End Time Message through God's vindicated prophet of Malachi 4:5-6, William Marrion Branham, from 1909 to 1965. It's all about Jesus Christ revealing Himself just before the end time. See Luke 17:30 and Rev 10:7

AMOS 3:7
  7    Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.

REVELATION 10:7
  7    But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and When God says he'll do a certain thing that he doesn't there's no more question to it that's the way he does it so God has made a way for us God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help them he wants to help you more than you want help you can just get that in your heart that God's more willing to help you than you are to help yourself but he has a way and that's the only way that he work us through his way you must come to his terms not your terms his terms you it certain way but he he gives it to you his way like non dipping in the the the Waters of Jorden why he said the waters up in his country is much cleaner and better but that wasn't what the prophet said dip here he dipped once leprosy still there six times it was still there he had to obey and come God's way and when he fully obeyed God's way the leprosy left and I say tonight that if we obey God's provided way leprosy will lead sickness will leave everything will leave but we've got to come his way for this day now dipped in the jardan wouldn't do any good now that was for nonon the law was for the for the Jews RAC is by Christ but each age has its part of the Gospel already predicted
