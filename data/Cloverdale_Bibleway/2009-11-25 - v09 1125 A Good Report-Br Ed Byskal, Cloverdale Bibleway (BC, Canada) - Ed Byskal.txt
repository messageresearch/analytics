Our hearts in one accord this evening. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Brother Ken Andes, why don't you just come and lead the church in prayer this evening? We want to unite our hearts together. How many were blessed by the Cochman family? They need your prayers tonight. Their little sister Caroline's 7-year-old son Samuel is in the hospital with an infection that has paralyzed half of his face. Just praying that the great physician will step in and on their behalf. So, why don't we unite our hearts together for that need? If you have a need upon your heart this evening, we'll pray with you as well. Just make it known by the uplifted hand. Brother Ken, would you come and pray? Let's bow our heads. Our blessed savior Jesus Christ, we give you praise tonight, thanksgiving from our hearts for all things. You have changed us from what we were to what we are. &gt;&gt; We are thankful for all that you've done for us in your redeeming work. You're keeping power. And Lord Jesus, is a scripture that's quoted so often at church gatherings that where two or three are gathered together, there you are in the midst. Lord Jesus, we accept that tonight that you walk with the redeemed. You walk with your children. You embody a people that will stay with your word and your nature lives through them. We believe Lord that we're a part of that great universal body of Jesus Christ and gathered here tonight. So we accept you Lord. We welcome you into our midst. We feel privileged tonight to have the creator of the universe here within us. &gt;&gt; We are thankful to have the great healer of the sick &gt;&gt; and the discouraged and the infirmed to have you with us tonight, embodied in this people. We are thankful, Lord, that your Holy Spirit that come 2,000 years ago is embodying us. And I pray, heavenly father, that as the word is preached tonight from your ministry, we will receive that word. Lord Jesus, give us hungry hearts. Help us to rightly divide the word as we receive it into our hearts. We would not as your children just swallow anything. We've come here tonight to swallow and to feed upon the great body word of Jesus Christ. That's what we're looking to receive. Heavenly Father, we pray that you'll stretch forth your hand and touch this musical family. They have a little one that's infirmed and hurt right now, Lord. And we pray God that you'll touch and heal the child in the name of Jesus Christ. May he be a testimony for you as the child rises up. And Lord Jesus, our families here tonight. We here tonight are represent representatives of a family. Maybe all of our family isn't here tonight, but our hearts reach out to them. And in the name of Jesus Christ, we lay hands upon those that are part of the extended family, both physical and spiritual. Lord Jesus, tonight we want to leave this building closer to you in a greater reality and understanding of your word and appreciation of you. Bless our pastor, brother Bisll. We pray God that you'll guide this assembly through his leadership and the ministry that's here. Continue to feed our souls Lord and make us strong make us strong stalwart Christians to be first of character and of nature of God in our lives. And then after that we can minister, we can sing, we can preach, we can do something after we have lived the life and we have seen you incarnate within us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask your blessing upon the continuation of the service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you each and everyone as you have your seats this evening. Greet you all once again in the name of the Lord. Do you feel encouraged after the weekend of meetings? &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe your body's a little bit in weary, but certainly encouraged and strengthened on the inner man. &gt;&gt; We can deny our flesh for a few more minutes, another half hour, another 45 minutes, maybe endure another hour. The inner man was encouraging the flesh to sit still &gt;&gt; because a lot a lot was said. I trust that you gleaned a lot from the meetings. Did you memorize the three things that were on the little demand here for three days before your eyes? Okay, there will be a test later. So, if you haven't, I'll let you check your notes. Tomorrow, big Thanksgiving US holiday. A great opportunity for believers to get together and give thanksgiving unto the Lord who is we're most thankful for. The Americans have probably forgot the true meaning of thanksgiving, but believers can celebrate it truly. For the forefathers came and and escaped religious persecution. And so we today truly can celebrate Thanksgiving. So we'll do that tomorrow. It's a Thanksgiving potluck. So if you're coming down, make sure that you bring a small dish or a dessert or something. And if you don't know what to bring, call the the office there at the camp and I'm sure they've got a fairly large list of things that uh that are coming down and those that might be needed. So, make sure you touch base with them if you're interested in spending the weekend down or spending the night down there after Turkey. Sometimes you can get a little sleepy. I don't know if anybody's experienced that, but uh there's plenty of cabins that are still available, so you're welcome to uh make a reservation and spend the weekend down there. Sunday morning will be the only service here this weekend. So, we trust that uh you'll come with your lick of fire and your pull of faith and we'll be able to enjoy a great time in the presence of the Lord on Sunday together. Sunday morning service be no evening service. Well, we want to turn right to the word, invite our pastor to come, minister what the Lord has in store for us this evening. We do believe that it's a spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's exactly what we have need of today. The great heavenly father knows what we need. Why don't we just sing as we unite our hearts together? Only believe, only believe. as we invite Brother Ed to come. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Holy really, only [Music] all things are possible. Believe. Oh Lord, I believe. Yes, Lord, I believe [Music] that all things are possible. Lord God I believe. Lord I [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible. Lord, I believe for Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Yes, Jesus [Music] is here. And all things are possible since Jesus is here. Jesus [Music] is here. Jesus is and all things are possible since Jesus is here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't he wonderful? I just got an email uh within the last hour from from Israel and uh there's a small group that has come to the message over there and uh they're now they're now 10 plus children and they're they're meeting they have two meetings a week in the home and they're even looking to get a place where that will a a a place where believers meet. And I thought this is just so remarkable. So wonderful. They're uh Russian Jews. I mean a Russian people who have moved to Israel. And I think one I understand is a Russian Jew. And uh so they're just, you know, please come over and help us. that kind of a an email, but I guess I email it just about every week. It's it's uh it's wonderful that I want you to feel the connection &gt;&gt; because they're not somebody on another planet someplace. They're just not very many hours from us uh by way of jet travel. and uh and they want to be they want to feel that you're connected. They want you to feel connected with them. &gt;&gt; And the reason I I'm saying that so that you might be able to respond is because they're going to see this service also. And uh and so we want to be able to say, "God bless you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stand firm. &gt;&gt; Be a witness for Christ. There's no word like this word. &gt;&gt; And uh it is just so remarkable. The one sister, she's uh praying for her husband, good man, a Christian man, has not embraced fully the message yet at this time. But uh it's in their home where they have the meetings. So I think that's wonderful. I I we're not don't want to say too much, but uh we want to let you know. And also uh brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother Ernie forwarded a uh a letter from a pastor Henry Rance in in the Philippines and he wanted uh us to convey thanks to the congregation to the people those that perhaps are streaming that have given and provided uh help for the for the people in the Philippines during the terrible devastation and that they've had and he wanted you to know that they have visited uh the various groups and places and churches and have made distribution as as uh we we were able and other churches were able to provide for them. So they wanted to be sure and give thanks to you. So you we receive that in the name of the Lord as well. Uh we're going to I'm going to ask our brother Victor Vamora if you would come down, brother Victor. And I want to say a few words. Brother Victor is uh leaving in a few days. And um I think about the 28th, excuse me. And he's going uh he's going to Nigeria. only this time he is not going to Nigeria uh for his work his profession he's going he wants to go because of a spiritual purpose brother Victor has a brother in the flesh that's a pastor uh but brother Victor was also uh you could come here brother Victor would be fine brother Victor was also so instrumental in in I would say presenting the message there to his brother and to the people and more or less having uh a a very real part in that work being birthed. His brother has never been ordained to the ministry. So, they're going to be having an ordination min uh ordination service and a pastor from another place is coming and they're going to have a meeting and his brother is going to be ordained. Brother Victor is going for that to be part of that service and part of that ordination. Brother Victor feels a real burden on his heart for the word has for years but has never uh had the say the freedom perhaps because of his employment and so on to to be able to give himself but he has a special burden and a vision for getting the message into the languages of the people. This brother is just and one more brother who became consumed and it just uh it it it connected. I could think it would fit like a glove when he had brother Kim speak to him and he heard about the the hub. Brother, brother Victor then made contact with a a a very well-known and wellestablished uh minister in Nigeria. And incidentally, Nigeria, for those of you that don't know, is the most populated country in Africa with 150 million people. 150 million. That's five times and half the half the size of United States. And this brother, brother Victor, uh, felt that there was three languages that really needed to be translated of the African languages. And this pastor, he said, I have translators for all three of those languages. So part of this journey is to go over and to meet also with him to initiate that part of the program. And you know, it's just mind-boggling to think that as soon as a translation is done in these various languages that have never been perhaps ever done, I don't know, and then they will be made available over that entire vast country immediately ready &gt;&gt; for them to uh little pastors and so on, whatever corner of Nigeria they're in or other countries, they will be able to have access to that. That is astounding. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I I trust that you have the same, you know, the same burden and same vision. And so they're been very very excited about that. And then brother Victor will continue on from there down to Ghana. And is there a convention in in Ghana? Uh conventions, a special meeting in Ghana. And uh so he's very very burdened that God will also not only direct and I've called him forward because we're going to have prayer here. I'm I'm going to ask you to stand. I'm going to ask brother Ken Andes if you come. Brother Kim I would like you to come as well because you have such a part in directing what is taking place. And perhaps I don't even I trust I've said everything right. It's pretty close. It's accurate enough. All right. And we want to just have prayer with our brother Victor. And this was what he desired that God will give him spiritual direction because he wants to give his life as much as is possible to the work of the Lord. and uh representing what uh brother Kim and Bible believers is seeking to do. And isn't it, say friends, to me it's just absolutely marvelous. &gt;&gt; Somebody just steps out of, you know, uh I thought he was going back to do some more work, employment with Shell Oil. And so he tells me the other day, "No, I've retired. I I I just I want to do something for God." &gt;&gt; I say, "God bless you, Brother Victor." &gt;&gt; Let's all stand, shall we? And I wonder brother Kim and brother Ken if you would come. Brother Tom, we're going to have prayer together. Yeah. We'll just have you here. Wonderful Jesus. Wonderful Jesus. Wonderful Jesus. Heavenly Father, we join hearttoheart, attribute to attribute. Sons and daughters of God that are standing together. We have one ambition that your will shall be done. &gt;&gt; In this vessel, our precious brother Victor Adam, you have dealt with him for years. He has been burdened for years. He has done everything that his hand was able to do. He has spoken. He has been a witness. He has caused others to come to the message. He's caused ministers to be stirred, Lord. And now I pray, Father, that there will be a fresh and new endowment of the Holy Spirit upon him. I pray that he will be empowered. I ask that you'll give him words and you'll give him wisdom. Lord, I pray, Father, as he had desires to set himself aside for the ministry and for what your will is in his life to minister and bring the word to the people, Lord, to bring this glorious gospel &gt;&gt; and to work, Lord Jesus. I pray that the vision, Father, that has been so fruitful throughout the world, oh God, he desires to work with the the people here and our brother Kim and the Bible believers and Lord, wherever they are in the world, but especially in Africa, Lord, and the let him find those needy places, Lord. Let him find those hungry ones, oh God. And I pray that you'll prosper his way, Lord. you'll prosper the work and the translators, I pray, oh God, you'll find the right ones and they will be gripped by the need and they will give themselves. Oh Lord, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ with this group of people tonight, this congregation. You will send him with the blessings of almighty God upon him. Lord, &gt;&gt; I pray that his labors will be fruitful &gt;&gt; and that he'll have a sweet a sweet fulfillment, Lord, &gt;&gt; that he is walking in your perfect will. Protect him on the way &gt;&gt; and bless his family that is here, Lord. Oh God, I pray you'll bless the Adam family, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Victor. Amen. And greet the people wherever you go for us. Hallelujah. That's wonderful. While you're standing, we'll uh I'll uh have you join with me in reading some scripture. Thank you all for coming on this not so nice I won't say a day it's just another one just another day. God bless you for coming and uh I hope you're able to make it out to the camp and bring something with you as our brother Derek was saying. you know, because I got a little afraid after I announced because I got thinking maybe everybody's going to come down and and we have we we'll all be expecting cuz brother Derek said he said something about five turkeys. Well, I don't know. But I've never seen a believer short on food. But but anyway, I hope you're able to come down. We'll have a wonderful time of fellowship. I want to read out of he out of Hebrews the 11th chapter. And we'll start at the 32nd verse. I'm just expecting a nice relaxed time with you tonight. &gt;&gt; I hope you are. &gt;&gt; And we're just going to dig into some scriptures here and perhaps be able to come to this subject in a fuller way in another time. Verse 32. And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson and of Jeffy, of David also and Samuel and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword. out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to uh flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead, raised to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were saw a sunder. Were tempted. Were slain with a sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world is not worthy. &gt;&gt; They wandered in deserts and mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise. God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Amen. God bless his word to us. Together as you have your seats. I I I want to uh speak to you on a good report. And uh it says these all having obtained a good report. The people that are listed here and not only here but throughout the whole chapter, the 11th chapter, which is called the uh heroes of faith. So, I'm just going to go slowly. I want you to absorb. I want you to absorb because we want to bring it right to this time and to our lives and to our individual walk. These people, they lived over an a very long period of time, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years apart. They lived in different uh geographical locations. They lived under very different conditions. They went all the way from being uh royalty. Some of these that are spoken of, they were almost like gods to the people. Uh Moses on his way to be a pharaoh. So they knew what it was to be at the epitome, the apex of of wealth, fame, royalty, almost worship by the people. And that was that was a above and beyond success. And God allowed that God allowed them to have that kind of a life. And at the same time then there were these others which we've read about destitute wandered about caves and lived in caves and dens of the earth and scourgings and bonds and imprisonments and we're we're somewhere in between. None of us are are are in royalty. None of us are having that measure of what the world might call success. Uh we're not in bonds. We're not imprisonments. Uh we're we're not experiencing scourgings. We're not spat upon. We're we don't have that. But we are believers. &gt;&gt; We are believers. &gt;&gt; And we're somewhere in between uh these two extremities. But the Bible says, "And these all obtained a good report." Now, I want to introduce to you right away a thought that I've been pondering for uh quite a long time. And that that's why I was determined to speak tonight regardless of my voice or anything else. I wanted to introduce I want you to ponder it in the coming days, weeks, months, whatever. And that is that regardless of who we are and what our station in life is, we're all quite different here tonight. We've come from different backgrounds. We have different educational levels. We have different levels of skill and and and uh uh we're we're made up different. We have different characteristics and uh different natures and all of these things are very very different. And yet we have one thing in common that these had all in common that is they had a faith in God the true living God. They could not be moved but what he was their God and they were going to serve him. Live, die, be successful, be a failure. they were going to serve him. They had that one thing in common. &gt;&gt; We have something in common here tonight. We have something in common because you wouldn't even be here at service if you didn't have that in common. That you have a unqualified commitment to the God that called you, to the God that spoke to you, to the God that has provided salvation for you. And we have that in common. And that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Absolutely wonderful. But God allows things and he has he allowed these people and he allows these people he allows us to be confronted uh with things. He allows things circumstances conditions uh of this time. Brother Brandham talks about the pressures of the age of the the different ages that the people lived in. So there was the dark ages and they had their pressures. There was there was the age of perhaps the renaissance and all of and there's been the great times and the good times and the poor times and all kinds of things that perhaps we are even blindsided. We're not expecting uh you know something to take place. We're not expecting that that would happen in our lives. We're not expecting that we'd be called on to do or to uh that we wouldn't be called on by God to answer to some situation that whether it be in our life or in our home or in our family or in our church or or in the nation or in the country. And yet we are called on. So there there's another aspect that I that needs to merge with this thought as we move through and that is that and I can't answer the question exactly but I have asked myself over and over why is it that when uh the good times or we can say the fullness of life and things are just going just uh unre with unrestrained success and just a wonderful. We have good health and we have good friends and we've got uh good this and good that and we don't have any need and we just come oh it's just a blessing of God and it is. There's no question about it. But it's amazing how in the fullness and I'm going to give you several examples. When the fullness comes, people there's like a a debilitating, if that's the right word. It's like a deterioration of spiritual strength and the ruggedness and and and you know that rugged faith that rugged Christian you know if when we get kind of spoiled &gt;&gt; and you know uh things that didn't bother start to irritate us and you know it's cold in the church or infatismal things or it's too hot or the preacher's too loud or he's too quiet or he's too short or he's too long or or we you know and and these things start to uh affect us and afflict us and then and then there are other things that maybe even amongst uh not always young people but and I I'm I'm you are here tonight will benefit if I if I'm able to approach this again and I want to carry it quite quite a bit further. But in the fullness, we'll find and and as I move forward now, you'll you'll see it in the scripture. What could be more complete and full than the perfection of Eden? Harmony with God that we know nothing about. a perfection that we've never seen and won't see until we come into another Eden. &gt;&gt; Nothing wanting, nothing lacking for body, spirit or soul. Nothing. You talk about a fullness, they had the fullness. They had the absolute perfection, the perfection of everything. And yet you'd wonder how in that fullness could anyone even hanker or how could Satan be successful at even uh uh uh causing Eve to desire something more than they had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's unthinkable. &gt;&gt; But yet in the midst of that perfection, there was a a a deterioration of some sort. And we can call it a deception. We can call it whatever we want. But and I'm not trying to define it too clearly tonight, but the amazing thing is that it could even happen in that environment. &gt;&gt; And so the downfall came in the state of fullness. And so it's it's it's it's uh it's also amazing to me that in this chapter 11 of Hebrews, Adam and Eve are not mentioned. Of the heroes of faith, they're not mentioned. Their son Abel, who the prophet continually declared, "By revelation, he took a lamb. By revelation, he shed blood. By revelation, he built the altar. Cain built an altar, too, but not by revelation, just by religion. So, we don't know. But here's one that had revelation. And so, now, Apostle Paul picks it up and says, "By faith, Abel &gt;&gt; offered a more excellent sacrifice." &gt;&gt; And so, Adam is not mentioned and Eve is not mentioned. A Abel is the one that is mentioned and they're not included. The scripture says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. So in this place of perfection and plenty, in this place of abundance, in this place of fellowship and harmony and nothing lacking, we find this something taking place. I want to refer you to the fullness of Israel. And this wasn't spoken just once. Now God said it several times. And there's he spoken uh I'm going to just read for you. You can just listen. Now these are the commandments and statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that you might do them in the land whether you go to possess it. Now, this was the word of God coming to them. They didn't have any script. They didn't have any books about it, but they had a prophet that was speaking it. Our conditions today are entirely different. All of the temptations and all of the evil and all of the and not only evil, all of the success, all of the good and all of the bad. Uh we're living under a completely different scenario, but it's the same devil &gt;&gt; that was in Eden. The exactly the same devil. Nothing's changed. He works the same kind of devices, the same kind of suggestions. He's got the same enticements, the same kind of the the the conditions have changed. The environment has changed, circumstances have changed, but the same devil trying to achieve the same thing. Right. &gt;&gt; And so they had a fullness. Adam and Eve had their fullness. But now we have another fullness. And here we are. And I I don't want to get ahead of myself, but here we are now having a prophet. And just perhaps I can give you this uh little bit of lead in in the thought. Brother Bram says, "Since the seals have been opened, since the fullness of the word has come, &gt;&gt; it's wonderful, &gt;&gt; but it's very dangerous." &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's true. And I'm speaking from the perception which is astounding to me, absolutely leaves me speechless sometimes where people that have proclaimed to be believers and are walking in the uh as professing believers. But then when we come to what this prophet has said, they find that in this and and find it everywhere. The same devil, he is trying to entice people and and is successful enticing people to not take the word of God very seriously. &gt;&gt; And it's so innocent. And that's where the problem starts. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't take the word that God has sent very seriously. Yeah. Well, you know, he said it, but then there's there's this and you know, and then uh the conditions and the circumstances that I live under and different things that are happening in my life or in my home or in my and so somehow the the surroundings seem to cause people to put less importance upon the word and the circumstances and conditions that we're living in begin to take precedence. idence &gt;&gt; over it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Anything that comes ahead of God &gt;&gt; is what?" &gt;&gt; As an idol, &gt;&gt; it's idolatry. &gt;&gt; And he said, "You can make anything an idol." He said, "You can make the piano an idol. &gt;&gt; You can make your car an idol. You can make your family an idol. Anything that comes between us and God is an idol." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I thought I would just throw that in. And so, now God is speaking through Moses and he says, now he refers immediately to the commandments that thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command with thee, thou and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life, and that thy days may be prolonged. That's quite comprehensive. Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with thee, and that you may increase mightily, as the Lord thy God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that flowth with milk and honey. This isn't a this isn't a a a destitute desert desert place. Here's a land that flows with milk and honey. And I want you to increase mightily here. O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. Thou shalt teach them uh diligently unto your children, and you shall talk of them, when you sit uh in in thine house, and when thou walst by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou riseest up. This word shall have precedence. &gt;&gt; They have to establish that first. This word must be have precedence over everything else. This is what you shall do. And you young people here and you parents that are here and all of us grandparents or whatever more. This is the thing that God is saying through Moses and he's never going to change his nature his his mind on this. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand. That's why the Jewish people have the straps over their hands like that. And and they shall be frontlets between thine eyes. And if you've seen these Orthodox Jewish people, they have that little box right here, right as a front lit for their eyes. This is this is where they're getting it from. And thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on and on thy gates. And it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildest not, and houses full of good things, which thou filest not, and wells digged, which thou digest not, and vineyards, and olive trees which thou plantest not. When thou shalt have eaten and be full, then beware, lest lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. And I can say when you come into the land when God has called you and brought you in and things that you couldn't see, things that were so complicated and mysterious and you were so steeped in religion, you were so steeped in whatever you were in and and suddenly you became set free &gt;&gt; and sight that you didn't purchase, &gt;&gt; vision that you didn't have, an understanding that was completely beyond your ability. and I give you lands and I give you fellowship and I give you brothers and I give you sisters. I give you family. I give you all of these things. &gt;&gt; In that fullness, he said, "Beware lest you forget the Lord &gt;&gt; which brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and serve him. And thou shalt swear and shalt swear by his name. H ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are around about you. These people going to be all around about. And so it was the people all around about which were having some kind of an effect. And I'm not just speaking here to the congregation that is here tonight, but I I I'm I'm speaking this to you that you can perhaps have a better grasp. Uh, and I guess I'm speaking from the perspective of one that, you know, I' I've traveled a a good deal and I've been to a lot of churches and a lot of places and a lot of people and hear about the kind of meetings that people are having. And then I find that there gets to be a maybe a longing within my own soul and spirit. And uh you you think of the simplicity. Uh you think of the rugged faith of people. You think of what people went through and even what they're enduring today in different places. And I'm sure as our brother uh Victor Adamora goes uh to Nigeria, he will find himself in in a very few days, he'll find himself in conditions which are extremely different from this &gt;&gt; and people don't have the same access. uh they maybe don't have the same ministry certainly don't have the same comfort and don't have and so we have you know here in uh America the western world uh we're we're rather consumed with a good life &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham talks about which I don't want to get into just now and I don't want you to feel any sense of condemnation this is this is to help you and to and to help you to help others as well but brother Brandham talks about the pressure of soft living. &gt;&gt; Now, you and I didn't develop the soft living. This whole thing is part of Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; It's all part of his program. And and soft living certainly isn't what they had in ancient times. And these are wandered around in deserts and caves of the earth, etc., etc. They they they certainly didn't have anything to they didn't have the pressure of self-living. They had a a different kind of a pressure. But the God that kept them is the same God that sees us through in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 8, the 8th chapter. I won't take time to read it, but it goes it says very much the same that God's going to bring you into a good land, a land of brooks. He describes it differently. A land of brooks and fountains and depths and spring that spring out of the valleys and hills of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of uh oil, olive and honey, a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness. Thou shalt not lack anything. Say, you'll have revelation upon revelation. You move from glory to glory. You will have one experience after another. Or you might have a complete dry spell. You might hear God speak. You might you might be with someone, they have spectacular experiences. You sit right beside them. You don't have any. It's the same God will take you through whichever situation you are in. Whichever one, whichever category. I can't describe everybody's category, but God will bring you through. I've experienced enough even amongst the assembly and amongst the believers in this area and those that are not with us tonight. I've experienced with them where God allowed things to shake them to their very foundation until it looked like they wouldn't survive. But they they didn't only pull through, they came through stronger. &gt;&gt; And you have to believe that &gt;&gt; because whether you feel it or not, it has nothing to do with how you feel. You wouldn't go to one of those that were huddled down in a cave and say, "How you feeling, brother?" &gt;&gt; Well, I'm I'm baking in this in incredible heat. I' I've I've been breathing dust till I can hardly hardly breathe anymore. My lungs are so full of it. Uh my eyes are burning. Uh I haven't had water to even bathe and to be clean. These conditions are unbelievable. Does God see me? Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; They knew God saw them &gt;&gt; and they were even driven out into these places. They said they didn't care what happened. We're going to saw you aunderder. Go ahead and do it. And I can tell you if you were in that condition, if you were there, you would say the same thing because that God, that spirit that dwells in you, we we you might think, well, I break. No. The spirit that's in you that's gripped you, the spirit that even brought you to church tonight, you may you don't know how strong that is until you'd be faced with it. You have no idea. And it regardless of how dark &gt;&gt; this age gets, regardless of how deceptive this age becomes, regardless of whether hell rises as it has to the streets of our cities and our towns and our communities, regardless of uh demons walking in flesh, regardless of that, I want to announce to the congregation tonight, those that are streaming, whoever hears this service, the bride of Jesus Christ will overcome in every case. [Applause] She will not surrender because she cannot surrender. &gt;&gt; Are they moved? Do they get discouraged? Of course. &gt;&gt; But God allows it. &gt;&gt; In fact is God allows it for a purpose of bringing forth something in you &gt;&gt; that he couldn't do any other way. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's really the hub of my message that Lord willing if I come to it. God allowed these things. God allowed down through the ages different things to happen, different uh circumstances. And brother Brandon says in each age they had to pressure and God counseledled them. You read the church ages. If you go home in chapter 2 and chapter 3, God knew there was going to be different under Luther, under Wesley, under Columbus, under all of these, under St. Martin. God knew exactly. They were completely different. &gt;&gt; But the people were victorious in every age. &gt;&gt; They had to be because they couldn't do anything else. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God speaks here when he gives all of these. And when you are eaten, when you have eaten and you're full, he says, "Then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. And beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God." Don't forget him. Don't sideline him. Don't make him just a sideline issue. He has to be the focal point. And don't forget to keep his commandments and his judgments and his statutes. I say don't forget to keep the message first place &gt;&gt; in your life. You say what is the message? Don't confuse the message with the word of God. The message is God's voice which he sent which we have in different forms that that speaks to us and unfolds and points us to those scriptures in this word of God that are applicable to our time. And you read that word and then you say, "Oh, I know the messenger spoke of that." And there it is. And you find strength pouring into your system. &gt;&gt; Amen. the blessings of the fullness. It's hard for me to say, but the blessings of the fullness actually turned them to other gods &gt;&gt; because of this. I even asked my wife, I said, "What is the word almost like a debilitating? It's like a a a weakness comes in and and a frailty and and that rugged they've not been exercised in their faith. We don't want to, you know, just find ourselves in a social environment. Now, fellowship, I like we're going to have tomorrow. I believe in that and we've been invited to different places and and I believe there's such strength in fellowship and I believe that you people ought to fellowship with one another but that's not the main uh that's not our main course. Uh our main course is the word of God and when we get together then we fellowship about the word and around the word and what God is doing. Amen. I'm excited about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So after receiving the fullness, now listen to what brother Brandham said about Jesus and this is in the message and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemy. He said Jesus as soon as he received the fullness of the spirit on the river when John baptized him, immediately the devil took him into the wilderness to go through a time of temptation. As soon as he had received the fullness, then he's led into the wilderness. But when he took the word of God and overcame the devil, it is written, it is written, he said he came back out then ready for his ministry. &gt;&gt; It didn't it didn't take away from it. Didn't he didn't become weakened. &gt;&gt; But when the when the fullness came &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; then He was uh tempted. The Bible says he was tempted in all points &gt;&gt; as we are. I want you to see tempting temptation the way the Bible says of of Abraham and God did tempt Abraham. And the temptation is the best explanation for it is the word to assay like a miner. like a minor that is that is uh uh drilling a core sample and they bring core samples uh round core samples out of the earth long core samples and then they grind that down and they maybe use chemicals. They put it through a testing all kinds of of uh all kinds of testing till it's just ground to nothing and they find out what kind of chemicals or I mean what kind of minerals and what kind of uh riches are in it and they can only do that by an assay or attempting a a test of the a test of the material and and that's what the Bible says. But now now I want to just come to Paul's time just quickly. I'm moving very quickly. Paul says this now the Apostle Paul. So we had the fullness of Eden, all the fullness that God gave his children that he loved so dearly, the children of Israel. And now we have the fullness of Jesus and now the fullness of the early church. Just quickly and briefly for apostle Paul says for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. The people might have uh they might not if you sat and spoke if you were sitting listening to Apostle Paul and said do you know that you've just heard all the counsel of God? Do you know that you've just heard the first church age messenger? They didn't know that. But God was giving them what they needed. It wasn't what Moses gave them. It was completely different. But it was the same God. &gt;&gt; And they knew that the same devil that fought those people back there in Moses time is the same one that's going to fight the early church. And the same one that fought the early church is going to fight in the last age. And our conditions are completely different. They had no idea of stepping into a car and turning the key on and having a motor fire up and drive away and all the comfort and, you know, turn the heat up, turn it down, turn the fan up, turn it down. Hey, you know, I mean, this is all they saw was chariots jostling in the straits, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And here we are. We don't think anything of it but it is a soft &gt;&gt; and with the softness is pressure &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says also in the tension &gt;&gt; tension nervous tension of this age we'll come to it a little later on so now he says the fullness I've not I've not shun to declare unto you all the counsel of God. And then he says to the Galatians, "I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel." Here's this mighty apostle, first church age messenger, this this uh uh intellectual he was, and yet he counted everything as lost that he might win Christ. been such an articulate man who was such a command of the Old Testament and he could turn the law to grace and what what an incredible man. Wouldn't you like to have lived and sat and listen to the Apostle Paul? Brother Bren says that little bald uh with a rim of of of gray hair, white hair around there and a little sharp eyes, glinting eyes and a mouth with such words and and such a command of the language. What what a tower of of a person he was. What a tower of character. And then he tells the people, I've I declared the whole gospel to you. I've revealed the whole plan of God through Jesus Christ. Have declared the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And he has to say to the Galatians, I I I I marvel how so soon &gt;&gt; you've been moved from the gospel and yet and to another gospel. And there isn't another gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Friends, I'm not just speaking here about this church. I'm speaking what's happening in the message. &gt;&gt; So when you look here or you hit there or you travel over there, don't be moved &gt;&gt; by anything. you remain steadfast and just say like one man and it's in the message Christian businessmen and they were saying something well this way that way and so forth and brother Carl Williams I believe it was he stood up and said that's not the way brother Brandham says it &gt;&gt; right that's right &gt;&gt; God bless him for that &gt;&gt; God bless him for that &gt;&gt; and then He says, and through Peter, the Apostle Peter says, "Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren. See that you love one another with a pure heart fervently." So here we are. This is a perhaps another aspect of it. Seeing you have purified your hearts and your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeign love of the brethren. see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently. Why? Because that's the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've been challenged. I have to confess many times throughout life. I've been very challenged. Sometimes I you may see me sitting behind the minister even as I was listening to our our brother France Leakar. Incidentally, they just are are have left. I suppose their plane has probably just left now, but they were going through all the various relationships and and things. And you know, it's it's it's tough. It's hard. It's hard sometime to keep all those relationships. I mean, you know, when he talked about how and I I read how brother Brandham says about, you know, how a man treats his wife and so on and how the wife, you know, she's supposed to be at the door and meet her husband and all these things. Uh, it's hard. That's why you were quiet &gt;&gt; and that's why I just had my lips puckered and I wasn't even saying amen. Not because you don't agree. &gt;&gt; You do agree. &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Amen." But I don't want to be a hypocrite like, "Amen. Here I am, folks. I do all of this." Well, I don't do all of this. And uh uh you know, I just be honest. I My wife and I back my car out every day. You know, I wave like this and she waves like that and and that's our that's about it. So, I guess people are made up different. I don't I I don't know. They're just made up different. But I absorbed it and I realize whatever the word says, that's where success is. &gt;&gt; And if we start running into any snags or start running into any uh difficulties in our relationships or in our inter relationships with one another, I'll I'll say this to you. Retreat to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Retreat to the word every time. Find out what the word says and do that. &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or don't feel it, that's irrelevant. Do what the word says. And I I know that God will prosper you. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; So now we'll talk about the fullness in the end time. Just quickly, we do not deny that the fullness of the word has come. We may not understand the fullness, but the fullness is unfolding from glory to glory in the message proving his word. Just a few quotes now. He said, "You believe we're living in the last days when the son of man is to be manifested. That would be all the word that's gathered if in the last days when the son of man is to be manifested. He said that would be all the word that's gathered up through Luther and Wesley Baptist and all that and the Pentecostals all gathered up to the revelation of what it's all been. The seventh angel was to open the sixth seal mystery. Uh it's all to be gathered up in the son of man which is Christ. His fullness of time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body. &gt;&gt; Isn't that powerful? The fullness of the time has come to the fullness of his word to manifest the fullness of his body. And I can say whether I understand that completely. I'll say amen to it. That's God's messenger said it. I know we're at that time. We're in a harvest. The harvest time is always the fullness of time. Everything everything that's going to be gathered. Everything that has been multiplied is in its multiplied form in the harvest time. And so here we are. And here we find ourselves. Maybe you have your your uh unique situation, your home, your family, your children, whatever more uh our church, our realm of fellowship, our family, my friends, etc., etc. So, what do we do uh if we've run into a a a difficult what do we do when we say we the the rubber has hit the road? We what do we do in a case like that? I want to say unequivocally, I want to say unqualified, retreat to the word so that you can say this is what the message says. &gt;&gt; Unvarnished, unpolished. This is what we've been taught. &gt;&gt; This is the word. I And I'm not ashamed to say that. I just want to say that. I want to declare it. This is what we live by. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what has called us. This is our richness. This is the good land. This is the houses. This is the vineyards that God has given. We didn't who who paid anything for for Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Like brother Lipar was saying to the children, I mean, did you do you pay to have your food cooked and brought to you and served? Well, that's that's very that was very wonderful. Have we paid anything? Do we pay anything towards brother Brandham's coming? &gt;&gt; We didn't, did we? How could we re how could we repay a man for going into the hospital and rushing in just in time to see her breathe her last and call her and she opens her eyes and speaks a few words and she passes out of this life. Just a young young woman. How could we pay anything for that? And God was grinding, assaying, tempting, trying &gt;&gt; fiery trial, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then he just gets home. &gt;&gt; Gets a call. Come quick. Your baby Sharon Rose is dying. Oh, not my baby. Not Not Sh. Rush to the hospital. Cry out to God. He says, "The heavens are brass." And as he sees her eyes crossed from the excruciating pain that she was in and her eyes crossed and God was grinding the servant grinding, you know, and the devil said to him, you know, he won't hear you. &gt;&gt; Friends, this isn't now we're not back in Hebrews 11. We're right here. &gt;&gt; This is the mouth. His mouth was the mouth that God used, but God was preparing that mouth and preparing that vessel. And he says, furthermore, he says there's been about 400 cases of of cross eyes and God has never failed to heal one of them. &gt;&gt; He said he said because of what he experienced. Was there even one of those parents that contributed anything to that kind of compassion? How he was gripped? God was grinding him out while he looked at her dying in front of his eyes in the hospital. God was preparing that vessel for hundreds of people who would have children with crossed eyes. And he would have such faith that God would heal that baby. God would heal that child. And it never cost us a penny. &gt;&gt; And we couldn't even say thank you &gt;&gt; because God was saying the same thing. I give you a message. I've sent this fullness in this end time with the spirit of revelation with the spirit of adoption. And we don't take it. We must not take it for granted. We must not allow this relaxation to deteriorate that rugged faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say may this church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise to the occasion. &gt;&gt; This is a great opportunity for us. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's a great opportunity. It's not a time to be sad and it's not a time to be withdrawn. It's not a time to dig down into a hole and and and be uh uh you know, pity me. No, no. It's a time to rise &gt;&gt; because God is allowing you to go through what you're going through because he wants to give you a good mark in your report card. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This is a test, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; You're going through a test. They say, "Oh, there's been a big economic meltdown." Yes, there has. But it's a test. You think God in heaven didn't know there's going to be the economy the way that it is and difficulty and some of you even had to move from your homes and whatever more. God knew all of that. God knew all of that. God's greater than that. God's greater than the economy. God's greater than the conditions that we're in. &gt;&gt; I want to give him glory. &gt;&gt; I want to praise him because he's in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'm not here tonight just to preach you a service. I'm here tonight with a very something very real within my heart. I'm not here tonight because we have all the answers. We don't. I don't even pretend to have all the answers. Not at all. I probably got more questions than I have answers. But I know one thing. God, our God, and we have to say it different. My God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knows it all. &gt;&gt; And he's got it in his hand. And he has you in his hand. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the message, the evening messenger, he said this is repeated each time through the Bible. We find that the sacred that in the sacred scriptures all the way through that just at the ending of the old age and a new one coming in that that age fades out and a new age comes in and God sends a messenger. And as always, every time that a messenger comes, it's always a call back to the word. Never fails. He says it's always the same. Call back to the word. Why call back to the word? cuz they drifted from the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying tonight. That's what we don't want to do. &gt;&gt; There's a possibility that we don't feed enough on the word. &gt;&gt; And I think that's a good possibility. And I would say that if you find yourself tonight and say, "Well, I really there's much of the word and much of the message I haven't heard." You should feed on it. &gt;&gt; You should make it a diet &gt;&gt; and you will gain strength that you didn't even know existed. Like you ate your food today and you got strength from it. That's exactly what we need to do spiritually as well. You need to redeem the time. You need to you need to plan it. It won't it won't fall into your lap. It won't just come of its own accord. You have to make that a a purposeful decision, a conscious decision on your own behalf. And then he says, remember this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. There cannot be nothing added to it or taken from it. It's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. complete revelation. So we can say on one hand, oh hallelujah, you know, we can do a jig and a dance and so on so forth. Oh, we've got the complete revelation. But in the time of fullness, always, always in the time of fullness, there is that lurking danger that's looming there. Lest we just lax back and say, "Oh, we've had the fullness of the word. Hallelujah. the preacher is going to get up and tell us all about it and he's going to preach us happy and we're going to have, you know, people sing and we're just going to have a wonderful time. That's all great and I hope that we will continue to do that, but don't ever let it take away from when when when things start going absolutely in reverse from what you expected, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. from what you expected &gt;&gt; in life &gt;&gt; in your home, &gt;&gt; in your job, &gt;&gt; in your church, in your own individual. When things go absolutely backwards, then you have to know, be certain of God. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Be certain of God. God is God. Whether I'm drinking branch water and eating soda crackers or whether I've got a t-bone steak, the same God that gave one gave the other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then brother Brandham says in the message, "Shalom. Can I just have a few more minutes?" He said, "Listen, I'm your brother." Well, first he said, "We're creatures of time." And he said, "God's a creature of eternity. He never began and we and he'll never end. So why not just commit yourself to him? &gt;&gt; Look up and shine for the joy of the light of God's word that's shining today. Why can't people see that, friends? He said, listen, he said, I'm your brother. I love you. Wouldn't it be easier for me just to tolerate or go ahead and say, oh well, I'll compromise on this. I'm so glad he didn't. He said, "I'm not made out of that. &gt;&gt; Can't you just compromise a little bit, Brother Brandham?" He says, "I'm just not made out of that." Oh. Uh I I want us to be able to to confess that and to say that the reason I'm here and the reason I'm not uh laying out at home or the reason I'm not taking this message in a relaxed way is because I'm not made that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And tonight you want to say, "Thank God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I didn't pay anything for it. &gt;&gt; I didn't buy it. I didn't vote for it. I didn't do anything for it. God just dropped it down and gave it to me. And I'd sooner have that than oil homes or cars or lands or money or anything. I'd sooner have that that that uh strength and that character that comes from the seed of God. &gt;&gt; So that you know whatever happens, you're going to be right here. You're going to be right at God's post of duty. Wherever that is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just give me another minute or two. He said, "I'm not made that way." No, sir. He said, "When it's the word, it's the word. God help us to stand for that. Which is true. And then he said, "Yes, sir. It would be fine. Sure, you'd get more pats on the back. But what will I do standing there that day when them bony fingers point in my face and say, "You knew better, but you failed to tell me." He said, "No." He said, "I'll be like Paul. I've not shunned to declare to you the whole council of God. &gt;&gt; And he already on earth declared, I'm not going to I'm not going to uh uh uh I I'm I'm going to be like Paul. I'm not going to be like that. I'm going to be like Paul say, "I've not shun to declare unto you the whole council of God. No man's blood upon me. Let it go where it may be." And that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And I uh I I'm I'm being very honest and open and transparent tonight. I read that and I feel a sense of conviction because I've got neighbors around me. I have witnessed to some and there's others I haven't. And I've wondered about this. You know, I don't want their blood on my hands. And I've thought about that, don't we? &gt;&gt; Yeah. you've thought about those things. So we want to be a witness. I it's not always what a person says but you want to live in such a way so that if there is any hunger there or any uh if they see anything that they would ask or open the door and I always look for that. Brother Brandham talks about this day, this day that we're in. And I can't possibly uh uh cover this now, but I'm just going to mention a couple of the a couple of uh thoughts that you can be pondering. Brother Bam talks about the shrine of Hollywood. We we talk about, you know, things that uh I think that I I personally I get affected by the environment. &gt;&gt; I get affected. &gt;&gt; I I I I like to maybe hear some news and then I hear something I'm sorry I heard. &gt;&gt; And so I don't have any newspaper coming to my home, but I'll go and buy a newspaper maybe a couple times a week. I'll be in a a service station. So I'll I'll pick up a newspaper and somewhere along yeah you know you find there's interesting things and you find out what's happening in the community etc etc happening in the city and then you just hit the skids and you run into something and just say h what well what's this age coming to &gt;&gt; this is insanity &gt;&gt; look at you know we we had a paper the other day and and and there's you know one one whole section generally when I get to the section that says life, I just throw it because I know it's death. &gt;&gt; That's true. True. &gt;&gt; That'll be one and it's it's fashion. And brother Brandham says that fashion the the they've taken the virtue of women &gt;&gt; and called it fashion &gt;&gt; the strength the virtue of women and called it and he says in this age and he talked to the Pentecostal people at that time he says and they bowed down to the shrine of Hollywood &gt;&gt; you know what a shrine is it's a place of worship &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so it's no wonder that Satan has called them stars cars and idols and the American idol and the Canadian idol and the British idol. You know why they even even he knows it &gt;&gt; and he's telling them you're you're going to worship this thing. &gt;&gt; You're going to worship this program. There's going to be millions of you watch this stuff &gt;&gt; and you're you're going to you're going to commit fornication because you're going to give your heart and soul to the thing. And he just gets them. I was in a huge factory some years ago in Los Angeles and a Jewish friend of mine, the owner of this factory, it was maybe you've heard of the garment of a sasson and uh so we we went we're going to go out and have lunch together. He was Jewish too, I guess. I don't know. But anyway, so we're walking through this factory and this whole aisle here on each side of the aisle was young fellows and young ladies at drawing boards and they're drawing and sketching because they're artists and they're sketching fashions that they're going to make in this factory. So, I'm I'm going through I'm walking through and they're looking and of course this was California, so I don't know what you'd expect, but were they dressed in weird stuff? And I just looked at them, I thought, "How in the world could that person ever draw anything that would be worth wearing?" And I'm walking through. Finally, I say to Ceson, I said, "Hey, how do you know what the people are going to buy? What are they going to wear? How do you know they will? He He just snapped right back. He says, "We tell them what they're gonna wear." &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; And that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And those those young people, I felt sorry for them. So twisted and so perverted. And then and then here we are as message believers and good godly people and we're subjected &gt;&gt; to what some man &gt;&gt; has said and they're all the same. We're going to tell them what they're going to wear and they fill the stores and all the ladies fashions and men's fashions. Fill the stores, plug them full and walk through. And that's why some of you sisters, you go there and you've got tears running down your face before you're done. I can't find anything worthwhile. I can't find anything that would give me a clear conscience. And that's why brother Brandham said way back then, he wasn't trying to be he was trying not trying to be humorous. He said they still have sewing machines and and and goods. &gt;&gt; In other words, material because he knew it was going to come to that. Is this all right? Just for a moment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I'm I'm going to close in five minutes. I'm just going to list off a number of things and then if God so grant me to be able to stand before you again and I trust that we will you'll have all of this background. So in our report card uh how do we handle these all had good good report. So it would be a question how do we handle success? How are we handling the pressure of the soft life? How do we respond to failure? Have you ever had failure? If you haven't, you will have. You'll experience. So, what do we do? I will help you when you have failure. God allowed it. You might say, "No, I brought it on myself." That's fine. Or you might say, "He brought it on. She brought it on. This person did it or that person did it." And that also might be true. Or you might say, "I'm just reaping. I'm reaping what I sowed." And that might be true. God happened to know all of that. &gt;&gt; And when you came to a place, and this was just an absolute crushing failure. Now, this is why brother Biscll is speaking this so that you can look at that and say, I can't change it. And God has allowed this. God knew it. &gt;&gt; Whether I did it or he did it or she did it or my relative or somebody else did it. One thing, my God knew it. &gt;&gt; My God saw it. &gt;&gt; And my God, my God is going to use it. Whether this is a cave in the desert, whether this is wandering around in sheep skin. You know something, friends? I've been in situations where I'd have been happy to exchange my place for a sheep skin. &gt;&gt; You don't believe me. &gt;&gt; You don't believe me? Just try me. I'd be happy to exchange some of the spots I've been in for a sheep skin or a goat skin and go wandering out in some wilderness. I wouldn't want to be in town doing it, but I' i'd be out in the wilderness. How do we respond to failure? How do we respond to offense? Jesus said when the men came and he said they asked about John are you he that we should look for or do we look for another? And he said, "Go back and tell John." The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because people were offended in him. &gt;&gt; He offended. Jesus offended people. says, "I don't like that. I'm offended with that. &gt;&gt; That's why they left him." &gt;&gt; Many were offended. &gt;&gt; And I've I've spoken it years ago, and I I just marvel. It used to be something, you know, that I was just intrigued with how the Bible says he had about 5,000 people and then and then a few verses later he has 4,988 left him. And the Bible says clearly he was left with the 12. &gt;&gt; So how do we respond? I'm not I'm not even preaching on it. How do we respond to being rejected? I never forget, and I've mentioned this a time or two, and if you've heard it before, just uh bear with me a moment, a a couple came into the into the log church, and there was no service, but they came into the log church, and we were there, and and this young lady, and she's a lovely young woman, and she come and and just looked at that log church. Oh, she said, "Isn't this beautiful?" And and her husband, I mean, her boyfriend because they were going to get married. I didn't know why they were there. Oh, she said, "This is just so beautiful." And they were so taken by it, you know, and she said, "We we want to be married here." And she thought that I just rejoice with her. And I said, "Well, we I don't conduct any marriages other than the people here, the people who come here and have this faith and believe what we're believing." And it was like I struck her in the head with a hammer. And she said, "You're rejecting me." And I was smitten. I said, "Well, I guess so." He said, "I can't believe that you would reject us. You are rejecting us." And that poor girl was absolutely smitten. She couldn't even bring a tear to her eyes. She couldn't believe. She was nice, lovely, fresh, bright, someone that you'd shake hands with or have over to your house. But I just had to let her know we I can't marry you. Even though you love this place and love this building and it is everything that you would wish, so quaint and nice. I never forgot that. Never forgot that. You're rejecting us. You're rejecting me. And I didn't really see it that way, but it was it was difficult. So, how do we how do we handle it's not easy to be rejected. Samuel, he was rejected. And God had to speak to him. And I'm I'm leaving now. We're going to close. But I'd like to ask you because you know we have a nice group here this evening. How how do you handle being alone? Say, "Oh, Brother Ed, don't crunch me. Don't don't don't come don't come down where I live like that cuz I know there are those that are alone. You're alone. There are those that perhaps would like to be married aren't married. There are those who have been married that don't have their partners. There's uh young people and older people and you can be amongst a whole group of people. You can be amongst a crowd of people and be terribly alone. &gt;&gt; You understand me? &gt;&gt; I listened to a program on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation many years ago. I never forgot it. 30, 40 years ago. in Toronto and they opened up the phone lines and the and the subject was loneliness. And their lines were plugged. People called and called and called and they asked, "Well, where are you? I'm here. I'm I have my apartment. I work here. I have this, but I'm lonely, you know." something friends. Uh I could take in the scripture and God had to get Moses alone. God had to get brother Brandham says he gets his prophets and so and sometimes we feel well that's so distant from us. You know, I'm not there. I'm not way back there. But Jesus got left alone. &gt;&gt; He knew what it was to be alone. And I can show you in the scripture and one very very man one man that was very very much alone was the very messenger that brought this message &gt;&gt; and I was with him when his heart was breaking because someone tried to worship him and he couldn't hardly tell anybody and we drove in the car and he was going with a nervous conversation. And he says, "Please forgive me, brother Ed." He said, "It just was so I'm I'm so troubled." He said, "What would cause what have I done?" He said, just like that, "What have I done that would cause a woman to give to take praise and worship away from my Lord? What have I done?" And he just on the verge of breaking down. Do you know what, friends? He was alone. He was very much alone. And when you're alone, see, I want I'd like to speak on, but I've got to close, but I want to be able to send you from this place. There's a whole array of things. So, we say, "Oh, yeah. These heroes of faith, they were rejected. &gt;&gt; They were cast off. &gt;&gt; They were alone. They had all of these things that we experience. We're in a different kind of a building. We're in a different environment. We're in a different society, but we have these things are a reality in our lives. And I'm speaking that to you to say this. He knew you be feel alone. And that's why he said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you." because he knew not necessarily that everybody would leave you, but he would he knew that you would be isolated and you'd be alone and you'd be bearing your own burden and no one fully understands. But I'm glad we got one that understands us &gt;&gt; and he'll never leave you alone. He understands even better than you understand yourself. I love him. &gt;&gt; Little over the time and I'm just going to start again another time. Will you stand with me? Oh Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, I come to you. I'm speaking with you before these people and on behalf of these brothers and sisters in Christ, dear friends, and many that are not here. Lord, dear friends, you've given us a promise that you'll never leave us nor forsake us. I'm asking that you will guide our footsteps. Lord, I'm praying especially for those that have felt led and directed to come tonight, this Wednesday night. Father, I pray that there will be now something that the Holy Spirit has planted deep into their heart that they might know the answer for every situation in their lives. You have already given us. You have provided for us because you're Jehovah Gyra and there's none like you. You are alone, oh God. And you you you are you are alone. There's no God like you. There's there's no one that would take your place in our lives. And so we want to thank you tonight, Lord, for us allowing us to gather like this. And I pray that your Holy Spirit will hover over us, Lord, and cause these words to be a reality. And I pray that there'll be a virtue and a strength that will come into your children, your daughters, your sons and daughters tonight, Lord, these families. Oh God, hear us when we pray. Oh God, we're praying, oh God, for our loved ones and for all those that have touched us and those that we love and those that love you and those that are your bride and your body. Lord Jesus, bless your people, I pray, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory, we thank you. We thank you. Amen and amen. Amen. I wonder, brother Derek, if you could just help us to sing Jehovah Gyra, if you would please. Was it all right? &gt;&gt; I kind of smiled at uh at the I watched you during the services and you're a hearty people. My goodness, you're hurting people. You sat and listened and it was so wonderful. I'm so proud of you. Amen. Our brother Fransis, isn't it amazing? I mean, just went from one statement to the next to the next to the next. And do you know why he covered it all? Cuz he's Swiss. What is Swiss known? What's Switzerland known for? [Music] Not to keep time with, but when you're speaking, you don't leave a cog out. Right? You don't leave a spring. You don't leave anything out. You put all the jewels in and all the cogs in. Otherwise, if you don't, it won't work. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; So, I I'm glad that brother Fras now he's just he's already gone. So now we've got it and we've got it on on uh DVD for you. All right, let's just sing it and then we're going to close in prayer. Jehovah, [Music] [Music] you are more than enough. for me. You're my [Music] I am set free. [Music] All I [Music] [Music] I need you are [Music] more than enough. You are more than enough. Glory. [Music] You are more than enough. You are much more. You are more than enough. Let us sing those lines again. You are more than enough. You are more than enough. Oh yes Lord. You are more than enough for me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to say God bless you. Hallelujah. May God be with you in the next days. May he prosper your life. And I pray that you'll take these these words. Please take these words and say those scriptures are true. Those quotes are true. And help me to absorb them. Help them to become part of my fiber. And if I've been weakened, I have been uh you know wearied, let that strength &gt;&gt; cuz he's not weary. &gt;&gt; He's not lost any strength. He's not discouraged. &gt;&gt; And whatever you and I have need of, &gt;&gt; he's Jehovah Gyra. He's going to provide for us. Who might want to be remembered in prayer as I just close in prayer? Our [Music] dear Lord, hands are raised and they represent something, a heart that is beating, a heart that is yearning, a heart that is hungry, perhaps a soul that is thirsty. Father, someone needing an answer. They've got a question. They have a they need an answer. And Lord, uh received an email tonight just before service. Oh God, a brother who's standing here is dear family. They need an answer from you. I pray, Father, you'll shine down, oh God, that you'll come as the great counselor and that you'll take charge of the situation in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, I pray that you will cause minds to be changed. Oh Lord, I pray you'll work on behalf of my brother and his wife and family. And oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, may you turn the thing around. Oh God, our brother Jerry is needing a job. I pray, Father, you'll provide work for him and allow his family to be able to be by his side very soon in the name of Jesus Christ. And every hand that has been raised, you are such a personal God. You're such a personal savior. You know every detail even better than we know it ourselves. You will undertake. I know that you will. I know that you will. And when we've crossed over to on the other side, we'll then realize more fully and more completely and perfectly how much you really cared for us. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We're asking it in your name that you'll be glorified. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Going to dismiss you in the name of Jesus Christ. You're all dismissed. Thank you for being here. Lord willing, you'll be here on the Lord's day. Fill this place. My wife and I can be taking a rest for a few days. And I'm sure you're not going to uh you won't you won't be upset with that. God bless you. You're dismissed. Thanks, Brother Derek. [Music] with you. Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
