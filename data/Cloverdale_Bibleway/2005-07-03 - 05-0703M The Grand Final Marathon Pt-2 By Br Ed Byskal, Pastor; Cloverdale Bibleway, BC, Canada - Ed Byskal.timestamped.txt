[11:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord
[11:44] Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[11:48] Thank you, Lord.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. I'm going to ask our
[11:52] brother John Andy's, Brother John, if
[11:54] you'd come. There's some requests here
[11:56] that we desire to be taken before the
[11:58] throne of grace. Sister Sigret is
[12:01] requesting prayer for her sister Margot
[12:05] um who's been just diagnosed with
[12:07] cancer. Praying for her salvation,
[12:10] complete healing. And we give the Lord
[12:12] thanks and praise for his love and
[12:14] mercy. And truly we do. Just asking to
[12:16] continue to pray for my dad who's not
[12:18] doing well physically, but you know, he
[12:20] just says, "I'm ready to go home. I'm
[12:21] done with this place. I want to go see
[12:23] the Lord." So, uh we just are thankful
[12:26] for his life and just pray that he
[12:28] doesn't uh suffer too much and and uh
[12:31] we're just thankful for what God did for
[12:34] him. Um there's a request for um a
[12:39] testimony from our sister Bobby Graham.
[12:41] One year ago, I broke my arm in three
[12:43] places. One of the breaks went up into
[12:45] the joint. Because of this, the doctor
[12:47] said I might not get the use of my arm
[12:49] back. Started to heal. Then the
[12:51] specialist said I would only get 75% use
[12:54] back. I said I was going for 100%. He
[12:56] smiled kindly at me and said that's a
[12:58] good thing to go for. I am now at 98%.
[13:01] With God all things are possible. Just
[13:03] wants to thank the Lord. Amen.
[13:06] Praise God.
[13:10] Uh brother uh Wim Congo uh has been
[13:13] diagnosed as having a large kidney
[13:15] stone. the doctors uh have to make a
[13:18] decision to do surgery or ultrasound on
[13:20] Monday and uh just want us to pray that
[13:23] God would dissolve it and have his
[13:26] perfect way. Amen. And also uh brother
[13:30] uh Ladic uh Kris I'm probably saying
[13:34] this wrong. It's the Polish translator
[13:38] resting prayer for his wife who has
[13:40] broken her leg and also for troubles
[13:42] that he's facing on his farm. trials are
[13:45] great battles of my faith and my
[13:47] obligations at home into the work of the
[13:48] Lord to translate brother Brandham's
[13:51] messages. So I want to pray for our
[13:52] brother. Amen. That God would just
[13:54] undertake for him. And how many have a
[13:56] need this morning? Amen. If you're
[13:58] listening in on the internet and you
[14:00] have a need that you desire to be taken
[14:02] before the throne of grace, you just
[14:04] lift it to our Lord as we go to prayer.
[14:06] And John, if you come,
[14:11] let's all join our hearts together in
[14:12] our faith.
[14:16] Father, we've come into this sacred
[14:18] atmosphere this morning.
[14:21] All of us as believers speaking from our
[14:24] hearts would know that something has
[14:26] changed. In the last few weeks, in the
[14:30] last few months, a change is happening
[14:32] to us. We've come into this sacred
[14:36] moment of the congregation.
[14:38] We are throwing back every unbelief,
[14:41] every doubt, every fear. All of the past
[14:45] is behind us. All of the failures, all
[14:48] of the mistakes,
[14:50] all of what we were is behind us. All of
[14:54] what we thought, all of our own
[14:56] thoughts, our physical birth is behind
[15:00] us. Our old life, our sin, our unbelief.
[15:05] Even up until right now, this prayer,
[15:08] all of our hearts agreeing together. It
[15:10] is the past. We are looking to you right
[15:14] now. You're the author. You're the
[15:17] beginner of our faith. It is because of
[15:20] you that we stand. It is because of you
[15:22] that we live. You are our breath. You
[15:26] are our faith. You are the syllables.
[15:28] You are our eyes and our ears. You are
[15:31] our heart. And we love you for that,
[15:35] Jesus. Right now, our faith is being
[15:38] lifted up to you.
[15:41] Not just a dying lamb, but a living lamb
[15:44] walking among us, Jesus Christ. The same
[15:48] yesterday, today, and forever, standing
[15:51] at attention in your bride. Our hearts
[15:54] that are quivering, Lord. lives that are
[15:57] standing in need of the next step,
[16:00] Father, that we do not know might be in
[16:03] a new body.
[16:05] Jesus, the very brush across our cheeks,
[16:09] could be our theophanes.
[16:11] The very air that's rustling near us
[16:15] could be bodies in another dimension
[16:17] blending into this place, Lord. And we
[16:20] believe that you've allowed crystals
[16:23] that's come across our pathways, Lord,
[16:26] that's brought the vision of that other
[16:28] realm so much closer, so much nearer.
[16:31] Father, they're in this building right
[16:34] now. Colors and rooms and and pictures
[16:37] and voices. Your will, your desire.
[16:41] Healing is in this room right now.
[16:44] Deliverance is in this room right now.
[16:46] Our theophanes are calling to us from
[16:49] another dimension. And we hear their
[16:52] voices. We hear their desires. We hear
[16:55] their call. And we are surrendering to
[16:58] it right now. We're throwing up our
[17:00] hands, Jesus. We're throwing up our
[17:02] hearts. We're saying, "Thy will be done
[17:04] in this dimension as it is in that other
[17:08] dimension." Let it blend this morning,
[17:11] Father. All of our hearts are saying,
[17:13] "Come, Lord Jesus. Come rescue us and
[17:17] deliver us, Father, from these pest
[17:20] house of sin and vile corruption. Lord,
[17:23] we desire that change more than any
[17:26] other thing that we could breathe out in
[17:28] a prayer more than any other desire. We
[17:31] want to see births. We want to see
[17:33] missing limbs. Lord, we we have qu
[17:36] requests before us. Lives that need a
[17:39] touch from you. Unspoken requests.
[17:41] Father, I'm even remembering Sister
[17:43] Deborah Lowry that needs a touch in her
[17:46] spinal cord. Father, there's needs out
[17:48] among us. Lord, names, Lord, they just
[17:51] are a blur. We need a change. We need a
[17:54] healing. Lost loved ones, there must be
[17:57] a season when they come back to you.
[17:59] There must be a time, that time is no
[18:02] more, and it blends into an eternal
[18:04] manifestation.
[18:06] All that we was, we are right now. Lord
[18:10] Jesus, we confess that as your bride, as
[18:12] your people, let the sperm come to the
[18:14] egg. Let there be a life. Lord, the
[18:17] sweetness that's around us, the
[18:19] accumulation of all of our expectation,
[18:22] our desires, I believe, is present here
[18:25] this morning. And we desire that rapture
[18:27] cycle to be culminated even as we speak.
[18:30] Lord, what if it would be a service like
[18:33] this, a moment like this, that our
[18:35] thoughts could be so blended that
[18:38] sisters and brothers would begin to
[18:39] speak. Lord, their desires would begin
[18:42] to not be just a groan, but it would
[18:44] become a living life. Missing limbs be
[18:47] created, lives would be changed, hearts
[18:51] would be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[18:53] Even yet while we hear the word, Father,
[18:55] the new birth, Lord, is just a a thought
[18:59] expressed from you and an individual
[19:01] receiving that. Father, we surrender
[19:04] this morning. We yield, Father, every
[19:07] heart in this building, out across the
[19:09] internet, into the phone hookups. We
[19:12] welcome your appearing, Jesus. We
[19:14] welcome your appearing, Father. We throw
[19:17] out the w red carpet. We yield our
[19:20] members, Jesus. Let the supernatural be
[19:23] breaking out upon us, Father. Let our
[19:25] minds be exploding. Let the thoughts of
[19:28] Christ just change us from glory to
[19:31] glory as we move under this great order
[19:34] of the shout and the voice and the
[19:36] trumpet. Father, we're in the season of
[19:39] the change. We hear the call of our new
[19:41] bodies. Oh, Father, we hear that
[19:44] theophony calling to us. Come a little
[19:47] higher. Come a little higher. Don't you
[19:50] want to be changed? And we are saying
[19:52] yes, Lord Jesus.
[19:55] Touch these lives, Father. Even our
[19:57] Polish translator and his wife needs a
[20:00] touch from you, Father. Pray that you
[20:02] would go across the miles. Go into that
[20:05] little room. Go into that little farm
[20:07] and make the difference. Our sister
[20:09] Cigret's family, Lord, and sister with
[20:12] this cancer, nothing is too small for
[20:15] you. Our brother Rod's father, his life
[20:19] has come this far and he wants to
[20:24] step across, Lord. And we're asking for
[20:27] the pain to be minimal, for his life on
[20:31] earth, not to be taken a moment before
[20:33] you desire, but not a a moment later.
[20:36] Jesus, I believe we'd all ask one
[20:38] another, what would be your greatest
[20:40] desire? it would be to step across the
[20:42] pale
[20:45] and other requests. We thank you for the
[20:46] miracle you did in Sister Bobby. Father,
[20:49] we could have a testimony service right
[20:51] now. Even this past week and past few
[20:54] weeks, what you're doing in our
[20:56] families, what you're doing among us, it
[20:58] is truly great things, Lord. And as we
[21:01] pale into that other dimension closer
[21:03] and closer, it should be happening,
[21:05] Father. even in the next hour or two,
[21:08] great things are going to happen here. I
[21:11] pray that you'd be so near to us that
[21:14] that time would pass away. That our
[21:17] energy, Lord, and our focus would be so
[21:19] divine and heavenly that none of us
[21:21] would miss your appearing, Jesus.
[21:24] Father, we're praying one for the other
[21:26] as we come into this communion time that
[21:29] not one would miss it. Don't let one
[21:32] life be distracted. Don't let one person
[21:35] miss the thing that you would have for
[21:37] us today. Bring our attention, Father,
[21:40] in line with thus sayeth the Lord.
[21:44] We love you this morning, Jesus. We
[21:47] appreciate the miracles what you're
[21:49] doing among us.
[21:52] We just give you the next few moments of
[21:54] our time, of our life here.
[21:57] Our reward is your presence. Our desires
[22:01] is your nearness. So would you come by
[22:04] this place, Lord, and minister to us
[22:07] this morning as we minister back to our
[22:10] husband and give you everything that we
[22:12] are. Let the service be a love token of
[22:16] our praise. Let there be a reservoir
[22:18] unleashed in every heart of thanksgiving
[22:20] and adoration, true worship from our
[22:23] hearts in Jesus name.
[22:27] Amen.
[22:32] May you may be seated.

[25:20] There's a fresh building
[25:25] our wings
[25:29] preparing
[25:31] a people to
[25:34] fly
[25:37] And I feel this
[25:41] in the air.
[25:45] Yet his spirit
[25:49] whispers to my soul
[25:54] that with patience
[25:56] I must still press to the go.
[26:03] be steady.
[26:05] It will strengthen me to know.
[26:10] I've got to be in condition
[26:14] to
[26:16] go home.
[26:19] So I surrender
[26:22] to the fire that brings me chain.
[26:28] holding loose
[26:31] all that I possess
[26:36] in this season
[26:40] I find rest

[27:25] embrace the heat of battle,
[27:28] taking back our ground.
[27:34] Till the captain says you've conquered,
[27:38] trade your armor for a crown.
[27:43] I've got to be conditioned

[28:43] And the pain and heartache we carried on
[28:47] the earth
[28:50] alone.
[28:51] They seem afraid now as we kneel before
[28:56] the throne.
[29:00] They served a purpose
[29:03] to ready me for home.
[29:07] I rejoice in the testing
[29:11] for I will overcome.
[29:16] I've got to be commissioned
[29:19] to
[29:21] go home.
[29:24] So I surrender
[29:27] to the fire that brings me chase.
[29:32] [Music]
[29:33] Holy loose
[29:36] all that I possess
[29:41] in this season.
[29:44] I find my rest.
[29:49] I've got to be in condition
[29:52] to
[29:54] go home.
[29:57] So I surrender
[30:00] to the fire that brings me change.
[30:06] Holy loose
[30:09] all that I possess
[30:15] in this season.
[30:18] I find rest.
[30:23] Holy loose.
[30:26] All that I possess
[30:31] in the season.
[30:34] I find rest
[30:39] in rapture season.

[31:53] where I'd be.
[31:56] Your love is light to me.
[32:01] Oh Lord, your love is life to me.
[32:07] My truest longing, my deepest need.
[32:14] Without you one moment, I don't know
[32:18] where I'd be.

[34:09] to prepare a place for you
[34:13] that where I am, there you may be." also
[34:19] from the earthly
[34:23] to the heavenly
[34:27] from this body
[34:30] to our theophony.
[34:32] [Music]
[34:34] Oh, from this old pest house to our
[34:39] father's house.
[34:42] That's the mansion he's built for you
[34:46] and me.
[34:50] That's the mansion he's built for you
[34:53] and me.
[34:56] [Music]
[34:58] In this body we grown,
[35:01] designed to be clothed upon
[35:05] your body
[35:08] celestial in the heavens.
[35:13] So when this corruption
[35:16] shall have put on incorruption,
[35:20] then mortality shall be swallowed up.
[35:26] Oh, from the earthly
[35:30] into the heavenly,
[35:34] from this body

[35:41] Oh, from this old test house to our

[36:01] me.
[36:03] [Music]
[36:06] Soon we'll lay aside
[36:08] this old ragged robe of flesh in
[36:12] exchange for a glorious one
[36:15] prepared in the heavens.
[36:21] And at the resurrection,
[36:23] at the sounding of the trump, my body
[36:27] will be glorified.
[36:31] Just like Jesus,
[36:34] oh from the earth, oh my God, into the
[36:39] heavenly
[36:42] from this body
[36:45] to my theophony.

[41:45] Yes, I

[42:07] Hallelujah.
[42:09] A lot of folks praying right now. Come
[42:13] by here. Do what you'd like to do. May
[42:17] you be pleased with what takes place
[42:21] today. What is said and the response of
[42:24] our hearts.
[42:26] Amen.
[42:28] I'm going to go directly to the word.
[42:31] Greeting you all in the name of Jesus
[42:33] Christ and all that are
[42:37] streaming. We say God bless you in your
[42:42] rooms and homes and different places of
[42:46] gathering. We're so happy to have each
[42:49] one
[42:51] present and each one that is with us
[42:55] that
[42:57] look forward to this time together.
[42:59] Amen. We want to remember that they're
[43:01] there. It's a good number of people that
[43:04] are with us. Brothers and sisters, how
[43:06] nice it would be to see them.
[43:09] Amen.
[43:10] Uh we're going to be turning to John's
[43:13] Gospel, the 14th chapter. While you're
[43:16] turning, I'd just like to make mention
[43:18] that my sister-in-law, my wife's sister,
[43:22] Sister Dorothy McGown, she's streaming
[43:24] the service this morning from her home
[43:27] back in Dawson Creek. She moved back to
[43:30] Dawson Creek. She has uh family there
[43:34] also and she wanted to go back and be
[43:37] near them.
[43:39] Three of her six children live here in
[43:41] the Vancouver area, but so she will be
[43:45] back here occasionally for a visit and
[43:48] she'll certainly be missed by all of us
[43:51] and especially Sister Lynn Douly who we
[43:55] appreciate so much. uh spent uh many
[43:59] hours together and I think mostly every
[44:01] Monday morning they spent together and
[44:03] we were so thankful for that. also uh
[44:06] brother Lloyd and sister Alice uh Siller
[44:09] who always sat right here in this middle
[44:12] section. They have uh moved back to
[44:14] Chatwind and that is uh I think almost
[44:18] all of their family live there in
[44:20] Chatwin and they have grandchildren and
[44:23] you know when people get a little bit up
[44:25] in years it's nice to have the family
[44:27] around and to be near them. So, we uh
[44:30] appreciated Brother Lloyd and Sister
[44:33] Alice Siller and uh we trust they're
[44:36] having a a wonderful time. We're glad
[44:38] that so many of their children are uh
[44:42] birthed into this word into this message
[44:45] and uh we're so we just want you to know
[44:48] these things. All right, we're going to
[44:51] read from John's Gospel.
[44:54] And I I trust that those of you that
[44:57] were here last Sunday have taken
[44:59] advantage of this week and have had
[45:01] opportunity to uh to be in the last four
[45:05] messages that Brother Brandham spoke. I
[45:09] appreciate the songs that the sisters
[45:11] sang. They're right in line and right in
[45:15] harmony with what the Holy Spirit has
[45:17] been speaking to me. And uh I I do
[45:20] appreciate the words that they the were
[45:24] inspired by the by the sisters to sing.
[45:29] On the 14th chapter of John, we'll start
[45:34] to read.
[45:36] Let not your heart be troubled. Ye
[45:38] believe in God, believe also in me. In
[45:42] my father's house are many mansions. If
[45:46] it were not so, I would have told you. I
[45:49] go to prepare a place for you. And if I
[45:52] go and prepare a place for you, I will
[45:57] come again and receive you unto myself,
[46:02] that where I am, there ye may be also.
[46:06] And whether I go, you know, and the way
[46:09] you know. And Thomas said unto
[46:12] him,"Lord, we know not whether thou
[46:14] goest, and how can we know the way?" And
[46:17] Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the
[46:22] truth, and the life. No man cometh unto
[46:25] the Father, but by me. If you had known
[46:29] me, you should have known my Father
[46:32] also. And from henceforth you know him
[46:35] and have seen him.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; May God bless the reading of his word.
[46:39] Let's just have a word of prayer.
[46:41] Father, we are so dependent upon you. We
[46:46] are depending on you to take our minds
[46:51] and the thoughts, oh God. Direct them
[46:54] into channels that will lead us up into
[46:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Uh tear
[47:00] us away, oh God, from old traditions,
[47:04] old ideas,
[47:06] concepts, Lord, that bind us and hold us
[47:10] down. May we may they fall away, oh God.
[47:14] May the chains of of our minds, Lord,
[47:18] that that have kept us chained over the
[47:21] years, I pray, Lord, that they will just
[47:23] drop away. And may the power of the Holy
[47:27] Spirit release us, oh God, to soar where
[47:31] believers should be soaring, Lord. This
[47:34] is a rapture season certainly. And I
[47:37] pray you'll prepare us, Lord, and make
[47:39] us so ready. I pray that all of our
[47:42] spiritual senses will be so alerted and
[47:46] brought, oh God, to a place where we can
[47:49] believe and have that rapturing faith.
[47:52] the name of Jesus Christ. Take control
[47:55] of my being. Lord, take control of each
[47:58] one and all who listen now and may hear
[48:02] in the future. I pray, oh God, that you
[48:05] will do uh do something special for us.
[48:09] For we ask it for your glory and may the
[48:13] name of Jesus Christ be lifted up. We
[48:16] pray our savior and lord. Amen. You may
[48:20] be seated.
[48:27] I'm continuing on from last Sunday. So
[48:31] once again
[48:33] uh you will need to keep your thoughts
[48:37] very very focused and don't be
[48:41] uh moving about and soon as people get
[48:43] settled and all the
[48:46] musicians and so are settled because I
[48:49] want so bad that you'll be able to enter
[48:53] into what I've been entering into and if
[48:57] I can tell you that after you know so
[49:00] many many years, you you just begin to
[49:04] see things from a different perspective
[49:06] and not merely seeing things from a
[49:08] different perspective, but you feel as
[49:10] though God is is moving you and wanting
[49:14] to move the people and move the
[49:16] congregation. you know, we we speak uh
[49:20] that, you know, it's a different time,
[49:21] it's a different season, and and I think
[49:24] a minister gets behind the pullpit, and
[49:27] he so hungers and desires that God will
[49:32] be able to take and captivate the minds
[49:35] and thoughts of the people and bring
[49:37] them into that channel so that we can be
[49:42] the recipients of all that God has for
[49:46] us in this season. And listen friends,
[49:49] we're we're believing and we do believe
[49:52] not only that we're in a rapture season.
[49:55] Those can just be idle words. And I I
[49:59] believe also that some of our
[50:00] terminology
[50:02] uh we have we in the message we give
[50:06] different terminology
[50:08] to the same old
[50:10] sometimes religious thought or religious
[50:14] upbringing and rapture is not a unique
[50:17] word to the believer. Yeah, rapture. Uh,
[50:21] all kinds of Christianity use the word
[50:23] rapture and we think of one thing and
[50:26] perhaps they think of another. But I can
[50:28] tell you that there's a lot of things
[50:31] concerning the rapture and aspects of
[50:33] the rapture that we believe that
[50:36] Pentecostals believe, the oneness
[50:38] believe, trinitarians believe, the
[50:40] Baptists believe exactly the same. you
[50:44] know, they have a flash whisbang that
[50:46] the whole thing's over and it's all in
[50:48] the moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[50:50] And the message the message to me
[50:55] has been more and more and more I've
[50:57] been realizing that uh there's there's
[51:01] some things that are so significant
[51:03] within the message that I believe and I
[51:07] can just bring this to you this way. I
[51:10] believe that God ordained at this season
[51:14] that the last messenger had to indeed be
[51:18] a prophet messenger so he could take out
[51:22] those selected
[51:24] scriptures,
[51:25] bring them forward, deliver them under
[51:28] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit so
[51:31] the people could get a hold of that and
[51:34] that would generate the faith to make
[51:37] the change that needs to take place
[51:40] &gt;&gt; and that's the only thing that's going
[51:42] to bring about the change.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] My my
[51:50] the grand and final marathon.
[51:55] This is a part two. God bless you,
[51:58] brother Gary.
[52:04] the
[52:06] the Athenians which is of Athens
[52:12] uh they commemorate the the marathon
[52:18] because it was a run by a soldier
[52:23] and I don't know if I can say his word
[52:25] exactly right but it appears to be
[52:27] Fidipities
[52:29] and this soldier by the name of Phip
[52:31] Fidipities
[52:33] he ran from a battlefield
[52:36] from Marathon which was 26.2 two uh
[52:41] miles
[52:42] and uh
[52:45] because the Athenians were outnumbered
[52:48] by the Persians and looked like they
[52:52] would be certainly defeated
[52:55] and they had won a they had actually won
[52:58] a victory at at Marathon and so
[53:02] Phidipodes ran the entire distance from
[53:06] Marathon to Athens.
[53:09] And uh and when he arrived, he delivered
[53:12] the momentous message, Nike,
[53:16] which is not a running shoe.
[53:18] It's a Greek word for victory. And he
[53:21] cried Nike and collapsed and died.
[53:27] And from that time from that dramatic
[53:30] conclusion of running from marathon to
[53:34] Athens that was the thing that initiated
[53:38] and inspired the marathon run.
[53:42] Now there's a fellow
[53:46] and uh I'm kind of glad for some help
[53:49] that I get from time to time and they
[53:50] say you ought to see this site after I
[53:52] finish preaching. They say you ought to
[53:53] see this.
[53:55] uh there's a fellow
[53:58] and uh they've said about him there are
[54:00] those of us whose idea of the ultimate
[54:04] physical challenge is the 26.2 mile
[54:08] Boston marathon
[54:10] and then there is Dean Carnazas I guess
[54:13] it is Carnazas I may have his name
[54:17] spoken
[54:18] not pronounced correctly but he has run
[54:22] 262 miles
[54:25] non-stop
[54:28] 262 miles. I actually saw him on my
[54:32] computer. They interviewed him and he he
[54:35] has run 262 miles. He has won the
[54:40] 135mile
[54:41] Badwater Ultra Ultra Marathon across
[54:45] Death Valley. He's considered the
[54:48] world's toughest which is considered the
[54:50] world's toughest foot race in 130 degree
[54:53] weather.
[54:54] He has run a marathon to the South Pole,
[54:58] to the frigid area.
[55:01] He has uh done has has has committed
[55:04] himself to absolutely mind-boggling
[55:07] adventures
[55:09] in these non-stop tres
[55:12] said the hell of Death Valley
[55:15] and the incomprehensible frigidity of
[55:18] the South Pole and the breathtaking
[55:20] beauty of the mountains and canyons of
[55:22] Sierra Nevada.
[55:25] They said that he captures the euphoria
[55:27] of outofbody heights in these adventures
[55:32] and uh he he's describes him as as
[55:37] gruesome terrible terribly gruesome but
[55:40] on the other hand he's a he's also a
[55:42] father has a family wife and a family
[55:46] and uh so he's written of course a lot
[55:48] of things and I suppose a lot of people
[55:50] want to uh inquire he said he believes
[55:54] it's possible possible possible for a
[55:56] human to run 500 miles non-stop. He has
[55:59] learned how to run and sleep while he
[56:02] runs.
[56:03] He said the only problem was he found
[56:05] himself running right down the middle of
[56:07] the road and was almost hit by a car and
[56:09] he'd wake up, but he keep running, eat
[56:12] while he run, and uh sleep while he run.
[56:15] And he didn't think it was possible, but
[56:17] it is possible. And this has all been
[56:20] documented and everything else. He has
[56:22] officially run 262 miles through the
[56:25] Hell of Death Valley. But there is a
[56:28] people who maybe never run the Boston
[56:32] Marathon and they have never run 262
[56:36] miles, but they have run through
[56:38] Leodysia.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; They have run through the hell, not of
[56:42] Death Valley as a geographical location,
[56:45] but they have run every day of their
[56:47] lives since God got a hold of their
[56:50] lives. And I tell you, it's been a run
[56:53] through the forces of hell. That has
[56:55] been a run through the darkness of demon
[56:59] powers that has been operating in every
[57:02] in every field and every area of your
[57:06] lives. And they have run with one goal
[57:10] in mind. And it is the prize.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; It's not having some acclaim of man. And
[57:17] it's not having some metal around your
[57:19] neck. But oh, I tell you, I want to be
[57:22] greeted. I want to be greeted with the
[57:25] host on the other side. And it's
[57:28] probably a lot closer than any of us
[57:31] think.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; We're speaking of the rapture.
[57:39] The prophet of God said, "Must I be
[57:41] carried home to heaven on a flowery bed
[57:45] of ease?" This was in the junction of
[57:48] time.
[57:49] While others fought to win the prize and
[57:52] sailed through bloody seas. No sir said
[57:55] God doesn't promise ease and prosperity
[57:58] but he promises grace to endure in every
[58:02] trial. It's the grace that we look to.
[58:06] And he quoted from the poem.
[58:09] Must I be carried home to heaven on a
[58:12] flowery bed of ease while others fought
[58:14] to win the prize and sail through bloody
[58:17] seas? No, I must fight. I must reign.
[58:22] Increase my courage, Lord. He said,
[58:24] that's my prayer. And he went on this uh
[58:28] long fellow's poem. Tell me not in
[58:31] mournful numbers. Life is just an empty
[58:34] dream, and the soul is dead that
[58:37] slumbers, and things are not what they
[58:40] seem. Yay, life is real, and life is
[58:43] earnest. The grave is not its goal. Dust
[58:48] thou art to dust returnest was not
[58:51] spoken of the soul.
[58:54] Lives of great men all remind us. And we
[58:58] can make our lives sublime
[59:01] with partings leave behind us footprints
[59:04] on the sands of time. Footprints that
[59:08] perhaps another sailing or life's solemn
[59:11] man. For a forlorn and ship shipwrecked
[59:15] brother seeing shall take heart again.
[59:19] Let us then be up and doing with a heart
[59:22] for any fate, still achieving, still
[59:26] pursuing, learn to labor and to wait.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; In the rapture message, the word
[59:34] rapture, as he points out, is not in the
[59:38] Bible,
[59:39] but it is a a word that the Bible said
[59:43] we shall be caught up. Caught up. uh he
[59:47] said we read in first Thessalonians
[59:50] and in the rapture message I'm part of
[59:54] this we'll just summarize last Sunday
[59:58] but I feel it's very essential I'd like
[1:00:00] to move this subject just forward slowly
[1:00:04] in the last in the rapture message which
[1:00:07] I I want to stress for all of you that
[1:00:09] were here and those of you that were not
[1:00:11] here if you were not here listen
[1:00:12] especially close to me the last four
[1:00:16] messages are So very very significant
[1:00:19] because as he was preaching the rapture
[1:00:21] message and as I was going through that
[1:00:24] and especially things that are to be and
[1:00:26] then modern events, I began to thinking
[1:00:28] about the place where I was in the
[1:00:30] message and having heard them. I just
[1:00:34] came to the awareness
[1:00:36] this ministry unlike any I can say since
[1:00:41] Adam.
[1:00:43] Adam didn't have this ministry.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] Jesus himself
[1:00:48] they the scripture says that if all the
[1:00:50] books were written of the things that he
[1:00:52] did the world itself couldn't contain
[1:00:54] them because all the things were done by
[1:00:56] him but Jesus himself it's not even
[1:01:00] recorded what he allowed to be recorded
[1:01:02] in this generation there have been no
[1:01:05] ministry like that and we have come we
[1:01:08] have come and have been born by a
[1:01:11] natural birth in a season that almighty
[1:01:15] God knew we would be here and ordained
[1:01:19] that we should be here in this very very
[1:01:23] significant season. And I am stressing
[1:01:26] it because I think I cannot stress it
[1:01:28] enough. This is of all people who need
[1:01:32] to say why am I here?
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; You need to say that
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; of all people. Why did God have me here
[1:01:39] in this season of time? Why did God have
[1:01:42] me in this end time? In the days of the
[1:01:46] days of Noah
[1:01:48] are certainly here. The days of Sodom
[1:01:50] are certainly here. The days when the
[1:01:53] messengers are certainly here and
[1:01:56] everything comes crashing together in
[1:02:00] one such significant time of all people.
[1:02:04] We need to say, why am I here?
[1:02:07] Why did God have me to be birthed in
[1:02:10] this season? Why did God in his divine
[1:02:15] program have me hear this message that
[1:02:19] I've heard?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Why did he do that? And surely he must
[1:02:24] have a divine purpose in it. And so here
[1:02:27] comes brother Brandham. He's ending his
[1:02:30] his just a few hours left of ministry.
[1:02:33] And at the point I was at, it was like I
[1:02:36] estimated about six more hours. Six more
[1:02:39] hours that he was going to preach. And I
[1:02:43] was living at that time expecting to go
[1:02:46] down and hear more services and great
[1:02:49] things were going to happen and so on
[1:02:51] and so forth. And suddenly the voices
[1:02:53] silenced and there's been nothing sight
[1:02:56] like that. And Tommy Osbborne, who
[1:02:59] actually spoke a memorial service, he
[1:03:02] said, "I'm going to be misunderstood." I
[1:03:04] wish he could hear those same words
[1:03:05] again himself. He said, "I'm going to be
[1:03:07] misunderstood, but God walked amongst us
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; in a little man." And he said, and he
[1:03:14] said, "Make no mistake. You won't see
[1:03:17] this again."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; If he ever prophesied, that was one time
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; and it has never been happened since.
[1:03:26] Make no mistake, it won't happen again.
[1:03:28] It won't be duplicated again. And as
[1:03:31] long as you live, I guarantee you, you
[1:03:35] won't see that again. That happened for
[1:03:38] one purpose, to get a people to prepare
[1:03:41] a people for the catching away. And if
[1:03:44] that is so, then those secrets of the
[1:03:46] catching away are right there. The
[1:03:48] secrets of the change. It's not going to
[1:03:50] be some flash from heaven or some carpet
[1:03:53] that rolls down like the Jews expected
[1:03:56] the Messiah would come. And
[1:03:57] unfortunately, the Gentiles are
[1:03:59] believing exactly like the Jews that
[1:04:01] somehow, you know, the heavens are going
[1:04:03] to burst wide open and the son of man is
[1:04:05] going to come descending down. He's
[1:04:07] already descended down.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:13] And so some of the things that I have to
[1:04:16] say um may be just to to shake your
[1:04:20] thoughts and to index them and turn them
[1:04:23] to see things uh just a little bit
[1:04:25] differently. So we read in Thessalonians
[1:04:27] he said first Thessalonians
[1:04:30] and this is the only time he said these
[1:04:32] words if you were to search through the
[1:04:34] computer you'd find and I I I marvel at
[1:04:36] this because when when he says something
[1:04:40] that is so startling
[1:04:43] and uh it it leaves your mind and leaves
[1:04:47] a question almost at the end something
[1:04:50] you have to search to to answer.
[1:04:55] uh that is when I pay special attention
[1:04:58] to it. And so he said we read in first
[1:05:00] Thessalonians the order of this great
[1:05:03] rapture and he never never before put
[1:05:07] the rapture into an order. Said this
[1:05:09] order
[1:05:11] of this great rapture that will take
[1:05:16] place in this in the last days.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want you to notice this
[1:05:22] great
[1:05:24] thing taking place here. Don't miss this
[1:05:29] from the 13th to the 16th verse. And he
[1:05:32] said three things that has to happen
[1:05:36] before the Lord himself appears. The
[1:05:39] first thing happened, notice a shout, a
[1:05:43] voice, and a trumpet.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Now the he said three things happen. A
[1:05:49] shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen
[1:05:54] before Jesus appears. Jesus does all
[1:05:58] three of them when he's descending.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; A shout. These are selected phrases.
[1:06:06] Now, a shout. What is a shout? It's a
[1:06:09] message going forth. The living bread of
[1:06:13] life, bringing forth the bride. So, it's
[1:06:17] to gather the living.
[1:06:20] Shout a messenger getting the people
[1:06:23] ready.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And this messenger now is going to be
[1:06:26] gone in just a matter of days and only
[1:06:29] going to speak another few hours.
[1:06:31] So,
[1:06:33] what I'm going to say is this that the
[1:06:35] shout has already been declared
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; and he at the end of the shout he was
[1:06:40] simply telling people that was the
[1:06:42] shout.
[1:06:44] In fact, as I want you to notice very
[1:06:46] very carefully what what he is actually
[1:06:50] doing. He is progressing
[1:06:54] himself.
[1:06:55] He is progressing through the process
[1:06:59] of these three stages. He's actually
[1:07:02] moving through in his ministry because
[1:07:06] now the shout has already been completed
[1:07:08] and he's simply notifying the people
[1:07:11] that's been the shout. Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; The shout is the message to gather the
[1:07:16] people and that had already been laid
[1:07:18] down
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; and now he's notifying them. That's what
[1:07:21] you've heard.
[1:07:25] And the second is a voice of the
[1:07:28] resurrection.
[1:07:30] The same voice that allowed a loud voice
[1:07:34] in John 11:38-44
[1:07:38] that called Lazarus from the grave.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Getting the bride
[1:07:43] together and then the resurrection of
[1:07:45] the dead to be caught up with it."
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; And then the trumpet, the trumpet was
[1:07:52] always a gathering. So all three of them
[1:07:54] are a gathering. The shout is a
[1:07:56] gathering of the living. The voice is a
[1:07:59] gathering of those that are asleep. And
[1:08:02] the trumpet is a gathering of both of
[1:08:04] those together to to meet the Lord in
[1:08:09] the air, as they say. All right. And
[1:08:11] don't don't let these terminologies
[1:08:14] be locked into your fixed idea of what
[1:08:17] it is. Let's let's just hear what it is.
[1:08:21] He said, "And then what the next is what
[1:08:24] was a trumpet." The third thing is a
[1:08:27] trumpet which always at the feast of
[1:08:30] trumpets is calling the people. See,
[1:08:33] they're all calling the people together.
[1:08:35] is calling the people to the feast and
[1:08:39] that'll be the bride's supper,
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; the lamb's supper with the bride in the
[1:08:45] sky.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; The first things comes forth. I'm just
[1:08:49] summarizing from last week. The first
[1:08:52] thing comes forth is his message calling
[1:08:55] the bride together. Repeating it. See,
[1:08:57] I'm repeating,
[1:08:59] but he's repeating.
[1:09:02] The next thing is a resurrection of the
[1:09:05] sleeping bride and they're caught
[1:09:08] together and the trumpet, the feast of
[1:09:11] the feast in the heavens in the sky.
[1:09:13] That's the thing that takes place,
[1:09:15] friends. And we're right there, ready
[1:09:19] now. Amen.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham moves through this
[1:09:23] sequence
[1:09:26] essentially living out the message
[1:09:30] in the in the in this process. This
[1:09:32] actually the process of the rapture.
[1:09:36] And now I'm going to have you go to uh
[1:09:39] the rapture scripture text if you would
[1:09:43] to uh Psalms 27.
[1:09:52] When people go to school or you go to
[1:09:54] any other place, it's common to do
[1:09:56] review, isn't it?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; And we got most important thing to
[1:10:01] review. We want to have this firmly in
[1:10:04] our minds. And I'm just going to read
[1:10:06] for the shortness of time. Going to read
[1:10:09] from verse 3 to 5.
[1:10:12] Though a host
[1:10:14] should encamp against me, my heart shall
[1:10:17] not fear, though war should rise against
[1:10:21] me, in this will I be confident.
[1:10:25] In this will I be confident. Remember
[1:10:27] last Sunday, this one thing I'll be
[1:10:30] confident. One thing have I desired of
[1:10:32] the Lord. This is where David's
[1:10:34] confidence was anchored. I'm I'm in this
[1:10:39] one thing will I be confident because
[1:10:41] one thing have I desired of the Lord and
[1:10:44] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[1:10:47] in the house of the Lord. The house is a
[1:10:50] dwelling place all the days of my life
[1:10:53] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:10:56] enquire in his temple which is also a
[1:10:59] dwelling place. For in the time of
[1:11:02] trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:11:04] pavilion. that also is a temporary
[1:11:07] dwelling place. And in the secret of his
[1:11:10] tabernacle shall he hide me, and he
[1:11:13] shall set me upon a rock.
[1:11:17] Now, now that was just be mindful of a
[1:11:20] moment, please. And and I'm I'm going to
[1:11:23] uh
[1:11:25] I'm going to try to be as clear as
[1:11:27] possible.
[1:11:31] when the Apostle Paul, just digressing
[1:11:34] for a moment, when the Apostle Paul was
[1:11:37] going to bring uh and introduce to the
[1:11:41] Hebrews the that the Hebrews that had
[1:11:45] come into uh had had come into an
[1:11:49] experience of the New Testament, he
[1:11:51] begins to introduce Melzdc.
[1:11:55] They they don't know a whole lot about
[1:11:57] MelzDC. But he goes back and he picks
[1:12:01] just a scripture, a line out of the
[1:12:03] Psalms concerning Melzdc and back into
[1:12:08] Genesis and he just takes those
[1:12:10] scriptures, brings them forward, goes
[1:12:12] back thou art to priest after the order
[1:12:14] of Melzdc. Brings it forward and ties it
[1:12:17] all together in a marvelous package to
[1:12:19] the Hebrews in verse in chapter five and
[1:12:22] six and seven in there. And now he's
[1:12:25] bringing these just these selected lines
[1:12:28] as it were selected verses bringing them
[1:12:30] forward as as a prophet apostle he's
[1:12:32] bringing it forward saying now this is
[1:12:34] it.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Now this is the high priest
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; and he's an or after the order of Melzdc
[1:12:40] and he has to turn it around. It has
[1:12:42] nothing to do with Aaron. Aaron died but
[1:12:44] this is one without a beginning of days
[1:12:46] or an end of life. This is a whole
[1:12:47] different priesthood. We're under a
[1:12:49] different priesthood. You're entering
[1:12:50] into another era now. And you see, he's
[1:12:53] ordained to do that. But the thing I
[1:12:55] want to point out to you is that he will
[1:12:56] take just a a a scripture, just a line,
[1:12:59] because they were all, it was already
[1:13:01] laying there. But it took God by the
[1:13:04] Holy Spirit through a selected vessel to
[1:13:07] pick that scripture up, bring it
[1:13:09] forward, and say to the people, "This is
[1:13:11] now."
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That's precisely what Brother Brandham's
[1:13:14] doing at the very end of his life, being
[1:13:17] divinely led of the Holy Spirit. goes
[1:13:20] back to Psalms 27 to bring it forward
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; as a prophetic. I will dwell in the
[1:13:26] house of the Lord. He'll hide me in the
[1:13:28] secret of his in in his pavilion, in the
[1:13:30] secret of his tabernacle, and I I will
[1:13:33] dwell there. This is this is it. And the
[1:13:35] prophet is saying that's rapture.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; It's not just David desiring, you know,
[1:13:41] having a certain desire or something.
[1:13:43] The prophet now has taken those
[1:13:45] scriptures, bringing them forward to a
[1:13:47] people that that that have it in their
[1:13:50] heart that they are a rapture
[1:13:52] generation. We see the world. We see the
[1:13:55] governments. We see the nation. We see
[1:13:57] Israel. We see everything that's
[1:13:59] happened in just the last 50 years. And
[1:14:02] we can't shake it. We can't get away
[1:14:04] from it. We can't close our eyes and say
[1:14:06] it didn't happen. It's all here. All the
[1:14:08] signs are here. All the evidence is
[1:14:10] here. And the word of God is being
[1:14:12] fulfilled on every front.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Why would it be considered unreasonable
[1:14:16] that God would send a messenger and at
[1:14:19] the very end of his life pull out those
[1:14:21] certain selected scriptures? Say that's
[1:14:22] not just Psalms 27. That's rapture.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; This isn't Psalm 27 now. This is
[1:14:30] rapture.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I will one thing I've desired of the
[1:14:33] Lord to dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:14:36] to to dwell in his habitation.
[1:14:39] And so we we went over we went over
[1:14:42] that. And this to me is the great prize.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; We're in the marathon, but this is the
[1:14:47] great prize.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Listen, my brothers, my sisters, by
[1:14:51] God's grace, I trust I'll be able to
[1:14:54] enter the rapture.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; And if I am called away and am sleeping,
[1:14:59] I pray by his grace. I don't feel worthy
[1:15:01] of it, but I pray by his grace that I
[1:15:04] will hear that voice. All right. And I
[1:15:09] tell you what, whether it be ashes or
[1:15:11] what it is, you rise out of the elements
[1:15:16] and and and and take a hold of uh uh
[1:15:19] take a hold of the next the next uh
[1:15:22] event that is for us.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I know that if a person sleeps, you're
[1:15:27] in your theophony, but in the
[1:15:29] resurrection, you're into a glorified
[1:15:32] state. It takes this body, the theophony
[1:15:35] body and the resurrected one, those
[1:15:38] three to make the glorified one.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; God has perfected in threes.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:15:47] when the disciples when they were so
[1:15:51] enthralled that the spirits were subject
[1:15:54] to them,
[1:15:56] Jesus said, "Don't rejoice in that.
[1:16:00] Maybe you have something to be happy
[1:16:02] over this last week. Something has
[1:16:05] happened. Oh, you just see God doing
[1:16:06] things and oh, you're you're thrilled
[1:16:08] and you're excited about things. I'd
[1:16:10] like to say to you today, don't rejoice
[1:16:12] in that.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; We have one prize. Rejoice that your
[1:16:17] names are written in heaven. Rejoice
[1:16:19] that you found out one day your name was
[1:16:21] in heaven. Has nothing to do with your
[1:16:23] job. Has nothing to do with this life.
[1:16:25] has nothing to do with things down here
[1:16:27] being socially better or economically
[1:16:30] better or anything else or even
[1:16:32] spiritually better. It has to do rejoice
[1:16:34] that your names are in heaven.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's the prize.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why Apostle Paul I I press
[1:16:44] toward the mark
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; for the prize of the high calling of God
[1:16:50] in Christ Jesus. And as Jesus was
[1:16:53] nearing the end of his race, he looked
[1:16:57] to the prize that was before him, always
[1:17:00] just towards the end of his marathon,
[1:17:04] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[1:17:05] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[1:17:09] that was set before him, he endured the
[1:17:13] cross. He ran through death valley. He
[1:17:16] ran through hell. He descended down to
[1:17:19] the depths where souls were in prison
[1:17:22] and preached to them. And he emptied out
[1:17:25] paradise. What a marathon he ran.
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; That's the al ultimate marathon.
[1:17:37] He ran the ultimate marathon. He's the
[1:17:40] ultimate marathon man. Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] He came down from the realms of glory
[1:17:47] and descended down here and took upon
[1:17:49] himself a vile body of this flesh and it
[1:17:52] was mutilated in a short time going to
[1:17:55] the cross standing there in his
[1:17:58] quietness and saying no man takes my
[1:18:00] life from me.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; I will lay it down and I will take it up
[1:18:04] again. Oh, what a marathon.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And it's not a myth.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; It's not a story. It happened and it
[1:18:14] happened just like that.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon refers to it in
[1:18:23] things that are to be. You heard me say
[1:18:26] it last Sunday and he and he refers to
[1:18:28] it and it actually is so applicable.
[1:18:30] He's
[1:18:32] I won't say he's speaking of himself,
[1:18:33] but he's speaking of
[1:18:36] the revealing of the son of man. His
[1:18:39] life is fixing to end here on earth as
[1:18:42] also was the prophets was fixing to end
[1:18:44] on earth. And as brother Brandham was
[1:18:47] nearing, I would say the finish line of
[1:18:49] his marathon through life,
[1:18:52] he left an example and clear
[1:18:55] instructions of what we must do to
[1:18:58] finish the race.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] the prize of a new dwelling place.
[1:19:09] He even brings up brother Daddy Dao was
[1:19:11] sitting there. He said a good friend of
[1:19:14] mine, Daddy, he was bringing a point and
[1:19:16] I'm trying to draw from all of these
[1:19:17] different areas and you'll have to
[1:19:19] collect it in your mind and and hold it
[1:19:22] there and meditate it on, ponder it. I
[1:19:24] can't tell you how deeply I've been
[1:19:25] pondering these things.
[1:19:28] He said, "Now there's Daddy Da. He's 93.
[1:19:32] I think he said he's 40 years older than
[1:19:35] he was. He said, "Now put 40 years on
[1:19:38] him." He said, "Aren't we glad there's a
[1:19:41] door called death?
[1:19:44] Look where we'd be."
[1:19:47] That's what science and that's what this
[1:19:50] life holds for us. If that's all there
[1:19:54] is, I say, "Thank God that there's a
[1:19:57] word. Thank God there's a promise. Thank
[1:20:00] God there's something to believe.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Thank God that he confirmed it.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And so these last four messages and he
[1:20:12] begins to speak about the rapture and
[1:20:15] the rapture message there is a place.
[1:20:17] I'm going to go quickly over this
[1:20:19] because I want to get to some other
[1:20:22] things this morning. But the house,
[1:20:25] I wanted to have it on the screen for
[1:20:27] you, but perhaps we'll be able to do it
[1:20:28] yet another time. The house, he said,
[1:20:30] the house, which is a it's a dwelling
[1:20:33] habitation.
[1:20:35] It also figuratively speaks of your own
[1:20:38] body.
[1:20:40] It also speaks of the collective family,
[1:20:43] the household. I want to dwell in the
[1:20:47] house of the Lord.
[1:20:50] I want to dwell in that household.
[1:20:54] I want to be with those that belong to
[1:20:56] him.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And then it also has direct reference to
[1:21:03] something that's established that has
[1:21:05] continuity.
[1:21:07] He could see David had a lot of trouble
[1:21:09] in his household. Do you know that
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; David had a lot of trouble with his sons
[1:21:15] and his daughters. He had a lot of
[1:21:17] trouble. And it must have been on his
[1:21:19] mind. He'd been a man of war and he shed
[1:21:23] a lot of blood. And even the word went
[1:21:26] out. They said, "David, you you've
[1:21:28] stirred him up. He's like a lion. He was
[1:21:32] and and and the military were telling
[1:21:35] telling the men, you got trouble on your
[1:21:37] hands. You stirred up David. He He was a
[1:21:42] perhaps unassuming kind of man, but when
[1:21:44] he went to war, he was a he had
[1:21:46] violence. And yet he there was something
[1:21:49] about him. He have such a love for God.
[1:21:52] My soul pantth after thee as the heart
[1:21:55] panth after the water brooks. So pantth
[1:21:58] my soul after thee. And God saw that. I
[1:22:02] want to dwell in your house. I want to
[1:22:04] be in your pavilion. I want to be in
[1:22:06] your tabernacle. I want to be in your
[1:22:08] temple. God loved him.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; He had his eyes set on something else.
[1:22:17] He can say, "My my household is
[1:22:20] changing. My children, everything is
[1:22:23] it's taking a
[1:22:26] I've had some disappointments, but I
[1:22:28] want to be in yours. One that's
[1:22:30] established,
[1:22:32] one that is permanent, one that has
[1:22:34] continuity."
[1:22:36] And then I want to inquire. I want to
[1:22:38] ponder this one who remembered no doubt
[1:22:41] that as as a shepherd boy. He remembered
[1:22:43] the pastoral
[1:22:45] green pastures and the still waters.
[1:22:49] That's why it came back to him. The Lord
[1:22:51] is my shepherd. I shall not want. Oh, he
[1:22:55] leadeth me beside the still waters. He
[1:22:58] had he had experienced that. He could
[1:23:00] draw that from his memory.
[1:23:02] But when he said, "I want to I want to
[1:23:05] sit down and ponder and reflect in his
[1:23:08] sanctuary."
[1:23:10] And that his sanctuary is also coming
[1:23:13] from a a Hebrew word that is to prevail,
[1:23:19] to overcome, to endure, and to have
[1:23:23] power. I'm not going to be weakened in
[1:23:26] his in his temple. I'm going to endure
[1:23:30] and I'm going to have victory.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; And Apostle Paul's saying, "Know ye not
[1:23:36] that your body is a temple of the Holy
[1:23:39] Ghost?" That temple is no different than
[1:23:41] the temple David was desiring to dwell
[1:23:45] in. He I don't have a desire to dwell in
[1:23:49] a Your body is a temple of the Holy
[1:23:51] Ghost. I don't have a desire to to dwell
[1:23:55] necessarily in a body that is weakening,
[1:23:58] a body that is aging, a body that has
[1:24:01] less ability, the body that has less
[1:24:03] perhaps mind or mental retention. We
[1:24:06] don't desire that. You don't desire
[1:24:08] that. That isn't something we desire.
[1:24:11] But I but while we are here, I desire
[1:24:14] overcoming power while we are here.
[1:24:17] continuity of faith to remain steadfast,
[1:24:21] unmovable. I don't want to go the way
[1:24:23] that others have gone.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; You want to be steadfast. I'm going to
[1:24:28] be here as long as God chooses that this
[1:24:31] temple shall be a temple of the Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost. We're going to remain steadfast.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what David is crying
[1:24:39] out for.
[1:24:41] Prevailing and overcoming power and be
[1:24:44] hid in his pavilion. And you notice
[1:24:45] there's always his temple, not my temple
[1:24:48] or a temple, his temple, his pavilion,
[1:24:51] the secret of his tabernacle.
[1:24:54] And hidden his pavilion, it's the the
[1:24:57] security that was found in Jehovah's
[1:25:00] presence. And his pavilion is actually
[1:25:03] from the Old Testament, which I covered
[1:25:05] last Sunday, the the the thicket or the
[1:25:09] booth that they had to dwell in and
[1:25:11] remembered. Every year they have to put
[1:25:14] up a booth and dwell in there seven days
[1:25:17] to recall their journey through uh the
[1:25:21] wilderness. And we have are reminded in
[1:25:24] this feast that we are not permanent
[1:25:27] residents here. We are aliens. We are
[1:25:32] foreigners. Don't get too settled down
[1:25:36] here because you are a transient.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are transients, young people.
[1:25:42] You might think you have years and years
[1:25:44] and years ahead of you. You never know.
[1:25:47] We are all transients here. As the
[1:25:49] prophet said, in five minutes from now,
[1:25:52] you could be a corpse.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And in five minutes from now, we could
[1:25:56] all be in glory.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; We have here no permanent dwelling
[1:26:02] place. Remember, this is just a booth.
[1:26:05] Yes.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; But David is saying, "Oh, I want to
[1:26:08] dwell in your booth.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; I want to dwell in one that's never
[1:26:12] going to be taken down. I want to dwell
[1:26:15] in one that's never going to age or
[1:26:17] become ancient. I want to dwell in one
[1:26:19] that is permanent forever
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; in your pavilion."
[1:26:25] And lastly,
[1:26:28] well, perhaps I should just stay on this
[1:26:29] a moment. It was not only a temporary
[1:26:34] uh shelter,
[1:26:36] but it was a rude
[1:26:38] a rude temporary shelter. And the
[1:26:43] scripture says, "Who shall change our
[1:26:45] vile body that it may be fashioned like
[1:26:49] unto his glorious body?" And I don't
[1:26:52] care how expensively or how wonderfully
[1:26:55] a person may doctor up this old frame,
[1:26:58] it's still a vile body. There's nothing
[1:27:01] very glamorous about it. It's a vile,
[1:27:04] weak body of flesh. But the scripture
[1:27:07] says that that he may fashion
[1:27:10] that it may be fashioned like unto his
[1:27:13] glorious body according to the working
[1:27:16] whereby he is able to subdue all things
[1:27:19] unto himself. And that vile body is a
[1:27:22] body of low estate. A body of
[1:27:25] humiliation
[1:27:27] has been my part. You know, and and and
[1:27:30] I it's a paradox to me how they aged
[1:27:37] go the whole cycle
[1:27:40] almost from a child. You see them, they
[1:27:43] can't feed themselves.
[1:27:45] I always feel that's so sad and they
[1:27:48] lose their independence
[1:27:50] and their kids rise up and say, "No, you
[1:27:52] can't do that." When it was them at one
[1:27:55] time that told the kids, "No, you can't
[1:27:57] do that." Now the kids rise up and say,
[1:27:59] "No, you can't do that. Now sign over
[1:28:01] your bank account. No, you can't. Now
[1:28:03] we'll tell you what to do. We'll tell
[1:28:04] you where to live. We'll do everything
[1:28:06] else.
[1:28:10] You're quiet."
[1:28:12] But that comes that comes for all of us
[1:28:15] at some point in time.
[1:28:19] And it's a I've been by the bedside when
[1:28:22] it's been a most humiliating. You lose
[1:28:24] all the independence
[1:28:26] and you become totally totally a
[1:28:29] dependent on someone else.
[1:28:34] It's a vile body,
[1:28:42] a humiliating body.
[1:28:46] And we don't have any promise here
[1:28:50] for this frame. But oh, do we have a
[1:28:53] glorious promise.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:00] And the scripture says of him, "And
[1:29:03] being in fashion, found in fashion as a
[1:29:05] man, he humbled himself and became
[1:29:10] obedient unto death, even the death of
[1:29:13] the cross."
[1:29:15] Oh, people have crosses up and crosses
[1:29:17] in their cars and crosses in their
[1:29:19] churches and crosses around their necks.
[1:29:21] And I see some of the most vulgar people
[1:29:26] with crosses around their neck. I think
[1:29:28] what a blasphemy that is. Has nothing to
[1:29:31] do. The cross of my Lord Jesus is a
[1:29:34] cross of shame, a cross of suffering, a
[1:29:37] cross that you wouldn't want to look at
[1:29:39] right now. Had blood probably on it and
[1:29:42] flesh from his body on it. And to see
[1:29:44] Spittle hanging on his beard and part of
[1:29:47] his beard tore out and his black and
[1:29:50] mangled with the with the thongs of the
[1:29:52] whip. And to see him laying standing
[1:29:56] there naked so we could be clothed. It
[1:30:00] was not something of beauty. It was a
[1:30:03] horror
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; sight.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; But he was humiliated
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; so that we could have his glory. Amen.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we can never be thankful
[1:30:15] enough. And then David says,
[1:30:20] David says, "Oh, that
[1:30:23] to hide me in the secret of his
[1:30:25] tabernacle."
[1:30:27] Which is precisely,
[1:30:29] we won't get to it today, but that is
[1:30:31] precisely where brother Brandham moves
[1:30:34] in the in the second from the last
[1:30:36] service, which is modern events. modern
[1:30:40] events, your event, in other words, made
[1:30:43] clear by the prophecy. And when you read
[1:30:46] Luke 24, starting at about the 13th
[1:30:49] verse, I believe it is, and two men on
[1:30:51] the way to Emmas, soon as you read that,
[1:30:53] and I want you all to read that. Soon as
[1:30:55] you read that, you say to yourself, I am
[1:30:59] reading a prophecy.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I am reading a prophecy. And a prophecy
[1:31:06] is something that's to be fulfilled. And
[1:31:09] the prophet has said now these are this
[1:31:12] is a modern event made clear by the
[1:31:15] prophecy. So what is hidden here? Those
[1:31:19] key truths that are here are for another
[1:31:22] people to fulfill this prophecy. And I
[1:31:25] will say to you, you are those people
[1:31:28] that will fulfill that prophecy. And
[1:31:30] that prophecy to me was the trumpet
[1:31:33] because he said the trumpet was a
[1:31:35] gathering of the resurrected with those
[1:31:38] that were still alive. And and Luke 24
[1:31:41] is Jesus Christ the resurrected walking
[1:31:44] with two that were mortal.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And it could be you.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Already women had been to the tomb. Some
[1:31:51] of the ladies had been to the tomb and
[1:31:54] saw a vision of angels. And to them it
[1:31:56] was strange. They were so close to it
[1:31:58] and yet they couldn't grasp it. They
[1:32:00] were so close to it. The women of our
[1:32:03] company have already been to the tomb
[1:32:05] and he's not there and we don't know
[1:32:07] what's happened and this is already the
[1:32:09] third day. They were right on the verge
[1:32:11] of it. They were seeing it. They
[1:32:13] remembered everything he said and it's
[1:32:15] so close to them and now he the
[1:32:17] resurrected one is actually walking with
[1:32:20] them and they cannot see now he's
[1:32:23] already in that other place.
[1:32:26] And he was and in John the 14th chapter,
[1:32:30] the only thing that's why the the
[1:32:32] resurrection did not happen when Jesus
[1:32:33] spoke to John. But Jesus only had a few
[1:32:36] hours.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Like brother Brandham only had a few
[1:32:39] hours
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; when when brother Brandham was reading
[1:32:42] John 14. He's at the same place in his
[1:32:44] ministry Jesus was in his. He only had a
[1:32:47] few hours left. He's already in his he's
[1:32:50] in the Passover chamber when he's
[1:32:52] talking to them. And he only has a few
[1:32:54] hours to be with them. He's only going
[1:32:56] to say he's maybe going to say even much
[1:32:58] less than brother Brandham said in the
[1:33:00] next three services much less. And he's
[1:33:02] only going to be with him a few hours.
[1:33:04] And he said in that in John 14, I go to
[1:33:07] prepare a place for you. And notice what
[1:33:09] he said that where I am.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Not where I will be, but where I am that
[1:33:16] there you might be also.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And what if you shall see the Son of
[1:33:22] Man? No man hath ascended up to heaven
[1:33:25] except the son of man that came down
[1:33:27] from heaven.
[1:33:30] And he said, "And the son of man which
[1:33:32] is in heaven."
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says that'll take
[1:33:35] an inoculation.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; To understand that one, he said that'll
[1:33:40] take an inoculation.
[1:33:42] I say, "Oh God, inoculate us.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; We'll understand these things. Inoculate
[1:33:50] us.
[1:33:53] Give us revelation. Inoculate this
[1:33:55] congregation today with revelation.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; And here here the prophet is taking John
[1:34:06] 14.
[1:34:07] I go to prepare a place for you that
[1:34:10] where I am there ye may be also. And the
[1:34:14] only thing that's going to happen
[1:34:16] between then and the next few hours and
[1:34:19] they're totally mystified. They cannot
[1:34:21] see it. But in the next few hours, a
[1:34:23] resurrection is going to happen. In the
[1:34:25] next few hours, paradise is going to be
[1:34:27] actually emptied. In the next few hours,
[1:34:29] there's going to be there's going to be
[1:34:31] uh the resurrected going to be walking
[1:34:33] in the streets of Jerusalem appearing to
[1:34:35] the believers
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; in the next few hours.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And here they are. And he's telling
[1:34:43] them, he's forewarning them. And they
[1:34:44] said, "Well, we don't know where you're
[1:34:45] going. How do we know the way?" He says,
[1:34:47] "I'm the way." Amen.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; And he's still the way.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That revealed word is still the way.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; And when you're in it, you're on your
[1:34:54] road.
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so imperative to have
[1:34:59] the word. Not say, "I'm a message
[1:35:01] believer. I believe Malachi 4." It's got
[1:35:03] to be the word for this season right
[1:35:04] now.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And he's moving the people. and the and
[1:35:11] between John 14 and Luke 24
[1:35:16] what notice now where God has directed a
[1:35:18] prophet to take those between John 14
[1:35:21] talking about I'm going to uh I'm going
[1:35:23] to prepare a place for you that where I
[1:35:24] am there you may be also between that
[1:35:26] and Luke 24 which he says is a prophecy
[1:35:29] because it was a prophecy for people
[1:35:30] that were yet to come.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; And between those two are you following
[1:35:34] me?
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And between those two, Jesus Jesus
[1:35:38] has the resurrection himself. And now
[1:35:40] he's into the trumpet.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He's into the great order. The shout has
[1:35:46] already been laid down.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Between John 14 and Luke 24, a
[1:35:50] resurrection has taken place which only
[1:35:52] the voice can raise them.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And so the resurrection has taken place.
[1:35:57] People are being street seen in the
[1:35:58] streets of Jerusalem. The resurrected
[1:36:00] and Jesus the resurrected. And the
[1:36:02] prophet said the gathering the trumpet
[1:36:04] is a gathering of the resurrected with
[1:36:06] those that are those that are still
[1:36:09] living. And here they are two Cleopus
[1:36:12] and his friend on the way to Emmas and
[1:36:15] one steps up beside them. A prophecy to
[1:36:18] be fulfilled.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope that we're alert enough. Say,
[1:36:23] "Oh God, let me fulfill that prophecy.
[1:36:32] And the secret was his tabernacle, his
[1:36:34] dwelling place had changed.
[1:36:37] That was the secret. David and here,
[1:36:39] brother Brandham, now just day before
[1:36:41] yesterday, he had taken uh Psalms 20:27.
[1:36:45] Hide me in the secret. Let me have the
[1:36:48] security in the secret of knowing who
[1:36:51] you are and where you are. Don't let me
[1:36:53] be confounded. Don't let me be ignorant.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let me be clouded. Don't let me be
[1:36:59] dull. Let me know where you are. And
[1:37:01] here they are. They're they're
[1:37:03] heavy-hearted. Why? Because they haven't
[1:37:06] seen. They've lost the secret of his
[1:37:08] dwelling place.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; They don't know where he is.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; He's not in the tomb.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And he's certainly not walking with us
[1:37:15] as he was a few days ago.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Where he is? Where is he? The women said
[1:37:19] they saw angels. We don't know where
[1:37:21] he's gone.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And the only thing that had happened,
[1:37:24] his dwelling place had changed.
[1:37:30] And it wasn't them. As I've said here
[1:37:32] before many times, it was not them who
[1:37:34] was determined to find him. They were
[1:37:36] heavy. They were heavy-hearted. They
[1:37:38] were reasoning between themselves. They
[1:37:40] were mystified. What is happening to
[1:37:43] this message
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; to the message that we've believed?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; The disciples are hiding in a locked
[1:37:52] room. The apostles of the Lord, the
[1:37:55] women are running to from the tomb
[1:37:58] saying the tomb's empty, the stones
[1:38:00] rolled away. The soldiers have gone into
[1:38:03] the city to report all of this chaos and
[1:38:06] everything that's happened that they
[1:38:07] can't explain. The whole thing is
[1:38:09] getting to be a bit of an uproar and we
[1:38:12] don't know what's happening. and they're
[1:38:14] still walking with the word.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; And it's Christ that's determined to
[1:38:21] bring them into the secret,
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; not Christ.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; You have to understand that Christ, who
[1:38:30] is this word, the spirit of this word is
[1:38:33] determined to bring you and hold you in
[1:38:36] his grasp and bring you into the
[1:38:38] reality.
[1:38:40] Oh God, I I trust your souls are
[1:38:43] hungering after it to bring you into the
[1:38:46] reality of where we are now today.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, he could come any time or
[1:38:51] whatever more." What if it is that he's
[1:38:54] here right now, trying to get next to
[1:38:56] you, trying to get your mind to be
[1:38:59] loosed from the chains and the bondages
[1:39:02] of all traditions and things. And people
[1:39:04] have even made a tradition out of the
[1:39:06] message. Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; You need to be loosed from it.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; All the little phrases and coin little
[1:39:13] jargon that we got de developed. All it
[1:39:15] is is message jargon. It has to be a
[1:39:18] reality
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; The very word laid out there changing
[1:39:25] you.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; So that was the secret of his
[1:39:34] tabernacle. Then he goes into let not
[1:39:37] your heart be troubled. He said, "Last
[1:39:40] night I was speaking in Yuma, the
[1:39:42] Christian businessman spoke on the
[1:39:44] rapture."
[1:39:47] He said, "If being Christians, I think
[1:39:49] we ought to be kind of notified
[1:39:53] ahead."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Listen what he's saying. As Christians,
[1:39:58] we ought to be notified ahead. That's
[1:40:00] what the message was all about.
[1:40:04] things that are to be.
[1:40:07] And Jesus explained,
[1:40:10] Jesus explained to the people, now I'm
[1:40:13] getting down to the nub of today.
[1:40:17] Jesus explained to his disciples and to
[1:40:20] the people,
[1:40:22] the dwelling place of God on earth,
[1:40:26] trying to get across to them
[1:40:29] without saying it right outright. Like
[1:40:32] the prophet said, he never went around
[1:40:33] saying, "I'm the son of God. I'm the son
[1:40:35] of God. I'm the son of God." Never went
[1:40:37] around saying that. Call himself the son
[1:40:40] of man, but acted in such a way and did
[1:40:44] things that the those that were hungry,
[1:40:46] those that had the call of God, the
[1:40:49] elect of God out there, would search for
[1:40:51] it and would observe it and would ponder
[1:40:54] it and and meditate upon it until the
[1:40:57] Holy Spirit would open their eyes and
[1:40:59] they could look past the flesh.
[1:41:02] Look past his garment. Look past his
[1:41:05] lowly Galilean language and say, "Thou
[1:41:07] art the Christ."
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Blessed art thou, Peter. And I say,
[1:41:14] "Blessed art thou,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; members of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:41:19] whoever you are,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; God knows those that are his." Blessed
[1:41:23] art thou.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; If God has revealed this Christ to you,
[1:41:30] Hallelujah.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Let not your hearts be
[1:41:36] troubled."
[1:41:38] He was talking to the Jews. "You
[1:41:41] believed in God,
[1:41:44] believe also in me."
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, it was a it was a a
[1:41:49] million light years
[1:41:51] between what the Jews believed God was
[1:41:54] and what they saw dwelling there.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; You believed in God.
[1:41:59] You believed in this great being. Now
[1:42:01] believe in me.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; As you have believed in God, believe in
[1:42:10] me because I am the son of God. Brother,
[1:42:13] I'm saying that now clearly. In other
[1:42:15] words, I and my father are one.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; My father is dwelling in me.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; And what you see me doing, it's not me.
[1:42:25] It's my father that dwelleth in me.
[1:42:31] Now, brother Brandham was not just
[1:42:33] talking historically.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; He was telling the people right then
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; cuz he just finished telling them. He
[1:42:43] said talking about after 3 years any
[1:42:47] move of God they denominated and they
[1:42:50] died. And then he said, "This
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; this has been going for 20 years and
[1:42:56] there's no denomination and there never
[1:42:58] will be."
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Because it can't denominate.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; You can't denominate this word. It never
[1:43:04] will be.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And so he's going on now. Jesus was
[1:43:11] trying to get those Jews to believe in
[1:43:14] who it was that was dwelling in him and
[1:43:16] working through him. and the prophet is
[1:43:19] making. Oh, I hope God just gives you
[1:43:22] perception now and understanding
[1:43:26] because it's not that we elevate brother
[1:43:30] Brandham as a man but in so in so
[1:43:33] recognizing what was operating in him
[1:43:36] then we can recognize who it is that's
[1:43:39] trying to deal with you.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; You give that honor. See Jesus, that's
[1:43:47] why it was so critical that they would
[1:43:49] look upon his flesh and see it was God.
[1:43:53] By so doing it, transferred to them
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; and gave them position.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And so by recognizing what God did now
[1:44:03] in this prophetic ministry, it it it
[1:44:05] it's then it's not William Bran's
[1:44:07] message. It is almighty God
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; hiding behind a veil of flesh that
[1:44:13] called you and you say oh God not a man
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; and he's saying I can't do these things
[1:44:20] it's God that dwelleth in me my father
[1:44:24] that dwelleth in me and this is like
[1:44:27] right when he said Jesus life now he
[1:44:30] goes right on because he's actually
[1:44:31] describing his own ministry it's not me
[1:44:33] that have done this work this great
[1:44:35] ministry that has not denominated for 20
[1:44:37] years it's Not me that's done this work.
[1:44:39] It's been God. As Jesus said using the
[1:44:43] same words that dwelleth in me, he has
[1:44:45] done these works. He said, "And now
[1:44:47] Jesus life was fixing to end on earth."
[1:44:49] So so was this revealing of the son of
[1:44:52] man. This revelation that was taking
[1:44:54] place was was going to cease to be seen
[1:44:58] as it was.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to take on another form.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And Jesus life was fixing to end on
[1:45:06] earth. And he'd showed the people and
[1:45:09] had proved to them that was precisely
[1:45:11] his own ministry. Had showed to the
[1:45:14] people and had proved to them that he
[1:45:17] was he was Jehovah manifested in the
[1:45:20] flesh by the great signs and wonders.
[1:45:22] And I will say if Jehovah was not
[1:45:24] dwelling in a man called William
[1:45:26] Brandham, he wouldn't have done any of
[1:45:28] the things he did.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You understand what
[1:45:32] I'm saying? And if Jehovah didn't dwell
[1:45:34] in you, you're a failure.
[1:45:37] And if Jehovah is not dwelling in you,
[1:45:39] you're lost.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; It's God in his people.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; And all that he was, he poured into
[1:45:46] Christ. Do you believe that?
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ, he poured
[1:45:50] into the church. All a ll he poured into
[1:45:55] the church.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He was one that had proved that God was
[1:46:04] in him.
[1:46:07] preached on proving. You say now talk
[1:46:10] about the three messengers and told and
[1:46:13] the one was God in flesh and ate ate
[1:46:17] meat, drank milk, ate buttermen
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; and told what was in Sarah's heart
[1:46:23] behind in the tent behind him. And I sat
[1:46:26] on the platform as you know and I'm
[1:46:27] going to say it again. So I'm turn his
[1:46:30] back and say let's see if that same God
[1:46:32] is present. Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Let's see if that same God is here. And
[1:46:36] he would do exactly the same thing.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Who is it? It's the same person.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; And he was telling them that after his
[1:46:47] death, there is life because I go and
[1:46:50] prepare a place that is to receive you.
[1:46:56] I want to stop.
[1:47:00] It is like he says a phrase and then
[1:47:01] interprets the phrase. I go to prepare a
[1:47:05] place.
[1:47:08] He interprets it. That is to receive
[1:47:13] you.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; I want to get you a jump start.
[1:47:21] You are already
[1:47:24] in that place.
[1:47:29] because he has received you.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; And by walking,
[1:47:40] by walking
[1:47:43] in each word as he makes it known,
[1:47:48] there's no more guarantee you'll come up
[1:47:50] out of the grave than there is a
[1:47:52] guarantee right now. or you'll just go
[1:47:53] right from where you are into what
[1:47:56] you're supposed to be, what you're
[1:47:58] ordained, because it's the the word that
[1:48:00] has brought you to where you are right
[1:48:02] now.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; I I want you to see that
[1:48:06] I go to prepare a place for you that is
[1:48:10] to receive them.
[1:48:13] And he said that shows that there's a
[1:48:15] life after this life is ended.
[1:48:21] It's important that you see that you've
[1:48:24] already entered into that process.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; He said it it's the continuing.
[1:48:34] Are you with me?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; I want your full attention. It's the
[1:48:38] continuing
[1:48:39] of this same life.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; In another world,
[1:48:46] another place.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's the continuing of the same
[1:48:50] life that you have. It won't be the same
[1:48:52] body,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; but it will be the same life.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You have desires and you have a love for
[1:49:00] him that will only intensify.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Says television will show you and I
[1:49:08] won't go into it because you all know it
[1:49:09] well. Television will prove to you that
[1:49:12] there's sounds going through this room
[1:49:14] and there's voices going through this
[1:49:16] room and there's colors going through
[1:49:18] this room. We don't have the instrument
[1:49:20] here on the platform to capture it. All
[1:49:23] of these things are going through this
[1:49:25] room. And he said bodies are going
[1:49:27] through the room because the the signals
[1:49:30] in the machine do not invent it. It only
[1:49:33] captures what's already in the air.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; And brings it down, makes it real. And
[1:49:39] he said it was here when Elijah was
[1:49:41] here. It was here when Moses was here.
[1:49:44] But they wouldn't believe it back then.
[1:49:46] But science now has brought it forward
[1:49:48] to this time because this is the time.
[1:49:51] And these are the people that believe
[1:49:52] that. And the children aren't surprised
[1:49:54] with it. It's just a it's a common place
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; and we're attuned to another realm.
[1:50:01] We're attuned to another dimension.
[1:50:04] Hollywood is completely playing on it
[1:50:06] all the time. all these video games
[1:50:08] continually playing on it. But there is
[1:50:10] a real place
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; and there's a real dimension.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; He said it was easy for those Jews who
[1:50:24] had been taught through generations to
[1:50:26] believe that there was a great
[1:50:28] supernatural God. But to think that that
[1:50:31] God had come down,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; that's the problem.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; That's the challenge. To think that that
[1:50:40] God had come down and was manifesting
[1:50:44] himself through the person of his son
[1:50:48] Jesus Christ, God tabernacled in a body
[1:50:51] of flesh. That was too much for them to
[1:50:53] understand.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; It was imperative. And furthermore, the
[1:50:58] prophet was speaking to groups of people
[1:51:00] at this time that couldn't see it and
[1:51:03] furthermore didn't want to see it and
[1:51:06] furthermore were resisting it.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; You can sense it. You can hear it.
[1:51:13] because he was chastising them also for
[1:51:16] the Pentecost, for the way that they
[1:51:18] were living, for the way they were
[1:51:19] dressing, for the way that the women cut
[1:51:22] their hair and the way that they dressed
[1:51:24] and the the type of dress and the men
[1:51:26] for hanging on to their denominational
[1:51:29] theories and and and and being resistant
[1:51:32] to letting that go to believe what was
[1:51:35] being said.
[1:51:43] He said, "And when you see my life
[1:51:47] ending,
[1:51:48] it's ending for a purpose."
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; I say believers should have been even
[1:51:54] awake and I have pondered these things
[1:51:57] for many. What you're hearing right now
[1:52:00] is things I pondered for about six or
[1:52:02] eight years.
[1:52:03] So don't think this was last week that I
[1:52:06] dreamed this up. things that have been
[1:52:09] moving in my heart for a lot of years
[1:52:11] and I wondered if I could just continue
[1:52:14] to approach it and you'll give me some a
[1:52:16] little bit of time. Brother Lance is
[1:52:18] preaching tonight, but he has all the
[1:52:20] time in the world. This is the Lord's
[1:52:22] day
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; and as long as you're able to to
[1:52:27] stay with me. I'll just carry on for a
[1:52:29] few more minutes.
[1:52:31] When you see my life ending, it's ending
[1:52:33] for a purpose. and I'm going away to
[1:52:36] prepare a place for you that where I am,
[1:52:41] there you may be also.
[1:52:43] Jesus therefore telling his disciples
[1:52:45] that his life is not ended in death. Now
[1:52:50] I want to take you on a little journey.
[1:52:55] It's not only that he came down,
[1:52:58] but how did he come down?
[1:53:03] How did God come down?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; That's the question. Do you know why
[1:53:08] it's critical? Because that's the way
[1:53:10] you're going to go up.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:23] And no man
[1:53:25] hath ascended up to heaven,
[1:53:28] but he that came down from heaven,
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; even the son of man which is in heaven.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And the prophet quotes that and says
[1:53:38] that'll take an inoculation. Amen.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because there was
[1:53:44] something there.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; No man hath descended or ascended up to
[1:53:49] heaven, but he that came down from
[1:53:52] heaven.
[1:53:53] How did he come down?
[1:54:00] The process
[1:54:02] of how he came down.
[1:54:04] Now I want to remember something.
[1:54:10] Matthew and also Luke's gospel.
[1:54:13] One takes it from the royal lineage and
[1:54:17] one takes it from the natural lineage.
[1:54:20] Luke takes it from a natural lineage
[1:54:23] and Matthew takes it from the kingly
[1:54:25] lineage because Matthew was anointed
[1:54:27] with the lion spirit
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; and Luke was with the man's spirit. So,
[1:54:32] he took it on the human side. But both
[1:54:35] of them took the genealogies. Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Why? What is the genealogy?
[1:54:40] You are a descendant
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; of your genealogy.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; You have descended.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; There was a time when you were not the
[1:54:53] person you are.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; And you were in the geneal
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; of your greatgrandfather, great great
[1:55:00] great all the way back. You are the gene
[1:55:03] which is the biological unit
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; by which the character is carried
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; from the parents to the children.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And the prophet goes into that and he
[1:55:14] uses spiritual gene in these last
[1:55:17] messages because he needs to get across
[1:55:19] to the people. You are a spiritual
[1:55:22] geneal
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; from the loins of your father
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; and you've come down.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have descended down
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; all through the uh all through the
[1:55:36] centuries. You've descended down. And
[1:55:39] God knew precisely the moment of your
[1:55:42] birth.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; He knew precisely who would give you
[1:55:46] birth in this life.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; And it's not dependent on what your
[1:55:54] parents or your greatgrandparents or
[1:55:57] your forefathers were. It's what God
[1:55:59] predestinated
[1:56:01] that you shall be in this season.
[1:56:04] And that's why he sent the light of the
[1:56:06] gospel. You're from many different
[1:56:08] countries and from many different
[1:56:10] places, but God in his wisdom ordained
[1:56:13] that the light of the gospel shall reach
[1:56:16] that seed.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Some of you are in hell holes.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you are giving yourselves to
[1:56:25] pleasure and sin.
[1:56:28] and others were steeped in religion.
[1:56:32] It made no difference what kind of chain
[1:56:34] held you. God came and broke the chains
[1:56:37] of thunder.
[1:56:41] brought light to that spiritual gene
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; which is the unit the spiritual
[1:56:46] biological unit
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; that God has ordained in his great
[1:56:51] scientific laboratory
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; that you shall be a portrayer of his
[1:56:57] character.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; That's the plan of God. But how did he
[1:57:06] come down? How did God himself come
[1:57:09] down?
[1:57:13] Well, because
[1:57:16] the human seed had become contaminated
[1:57:21] through the disobedience and the serpent
[1:57:22] seed in the in the beginning and God
[1:57:25] saying to the serpent,
[1:57:28] I'll put enmity between you and the
[1:57:30] woman and between your seed. Anyone who
[1:57:33] doesn't believe the serpent seed got to
[1:57:35] hang right there and answer that
[1:57:37] question. Whose seed was that?
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; His son portrayed who he was. Jesus said
[1:57:46] that Satan was a murderer from the
[1:57:48] beginning. But when he became expressed,
[1:57:50] he was expressed in Cain because that
[1:57:52] was his son and he was a murderer
[1:57:55] humanly speaking. But Jesus speaking in
[1:57:58] another realm says Satan was a murderer
[1:58:00] from the beginning
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; and his instrument was the serpent who
[1:58:05] God changed his entire physical
[1:58:07] structure.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't have he's on a cursed he was
[1:58:11] of the highest nature
[1:58:14] spoke and knew the m knew the voice of
[1:58:17] God and knew what God had said.
[1:58:33] Hallelujah.
[1:58:37] So now God's got to come down.
[1:58:41] So how he comes down first,
[1:58:44] he inspires
[1:58:46] the prophets quickly. I hope you stay
[1:58:49] with me.
[1:58:51] to inspire Moses and spirit came in him.
[1:58:55] A prophet shall the Lord your God raise
[1:58:57] up like unto me.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass who doesn't
[1:59:01] hear him shall be cut off.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And and the word is laid there.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; It's like
[1:59:10] like the food that you eat to sustain
[1:59:13] this body. It's all laid out here.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Rice was growing long before you lived.
[1:59:19] potatoes and carrots and the fruit and
[1:59:21] things to live. We're were we're here
[1:59:23] long before you came on the scene. God
[1:59:25] put it here for you
[1:59:28] to sustain you. Now just hold that.
[1:59:32] So on down
[1:59:34] here comes Isaiah.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, who has believed our report? And to
[1:59:40] whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? He
[1:59:42] shall go before him and he begins to
[1:59:44] speak about Jesus. He was wounded for
[1:59:47] our transgressions. He's bruised for our
[1:59:48] iniquities. The chastisement of our
[1:59:51] peace was laid upon him. And by his
[1:59:53] stripes, we're healed. And the word is
[1:59:55] laid out there.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; But he wasn't here yet.
[1:59:59] And all through the scripture,
[2:00:02] it's laid out. The word is laid out for
[2:00:05] him. But because sin had come and all
[2:00:09] humanity had come through sexual birth,
[2:00:12] through human bloodstream, God had to
[2:00:14] start a new bloodstream.
[2:00:17] And so he laid a he laid a seed out
[2:00:19] there also that says a virgin shall
[2:00:22] conceive
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; and shall bring forth a son. And now on
[2:00:27] generations down a little girl
[2:00:29] descended.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; A little virgin girl descended. Simple
[2:00:34] enough to believe.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; She wasn't interested in science. She
[2:00:39] wasn't interested in how it is going to
[2:00:40] happen exactly. But she says, "Let it be
[2:00:43] unto me according to your word.
[2:00:47] And the prophet said, the prophet of God
[2:00:50] said those prophet's words,
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; that prophet's word, because the word of
[2:00:55] a prophet is God's word, but God had to
[2:00:58] speak it. And the prophet's words lodged
[2:01:01] in her womb.
[2:01:06] If a prophet's word, God's word in a
[2:01:09] prophet can lodge in the womb of a woman
[2:01:11] and bring forth the son of God, I say
[2:01:15] that God's word lodged into your flesh
[2:01:18] can take you from this world into
[2:01:20] another one.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; And not only can it, it will.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; And the word's already been laid out.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to go up the same as he
[2:01:31] came down.
[2:01:35] Exactly.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And it was a prophet
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; who brought rapture.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Things that are to be modern events made
[2:01:47] clear by the prophecy and leadership
[2:01:50] which is two men having gone to two
[2:01:52] different places.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; It's all a place a place. A place
[2:01:58] changing dwelling place. That's the last
[2:02:01] four messages of the prophet. You're
[2:02:04] changing a dwelling place.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; But let me notify you folks, and I love
[2:02:12] you all, but you're not going to sit
[2:02:15] here on your hands.
[2:02:17] You're not going to sit here ho h
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; and well, God said it and it's just
[2:02:21] going to happen all the rest of it.
[2:02:22] Don't don't you fool yourself.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; It doesn't happen that way.
[2:02:28] And Jesus,
[2:02:29] he didn't only descend, but he also
[2:02:31] ascended.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; And he ascended the same way that he
[2:02:35] descended.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; He descended by while he was
[2:02:42] ma Mary believed the word and that those
[2:02:45] words lodged in her womb and she brought
[2:02:47] forth a son called his name Jesus.
[2:02:52] even as a boy 12.
[2:02:54] So I must be about my father's business.
[2:02:57] He wasn't being directed by the school
[2:02:59] master. He wasn't being directed by the
[2:03:02] rabbi. Oh, it ought to shake us from
[2:03:05] being directed by our our our professors
[2:03:08] and our, you know, our mentors and so
[2:03:12] on. We should have one mentor in this
[2:03:14] generation as a prophet of God is our
[2:03:17] mentor.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and Jesus. That's why I said
[2:03:23] last Sunday and say once again and and
[2:03:25] when when the disciples they you know
[2:03:27] they they they can manipulate things.
[2:03:29] Maybe we can arrange things so you're
[2:03:31] not going to suffer like this.
[2:03:34] How then shall the scriptures be
[2:03:36] fulfilled?
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; If I move to escape this, how then? If I
[2:03:40] move to escape this hardship, how then
[2:03:43] shall the scripture be fulfilled? Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And they will say all kinds of nasty
[2:03:48] things about the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:50] Those cultish people, the way they
[2:03:53] dress, the way they act, what kind of
[2:03:55] nonsense you say it must be. So
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; rejoice
[2:04:00] when men speak evil of you.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; For great is your reward in heaven.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; How shall it be? The scriptures must
[2:04:15] thus be fulfilled.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Because you are in your ascension.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; You are in your ascension.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; It's not something going to be. You're
[2:04:27] in it now.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; And as each word comes and is made known
[2:04:32] and the prophet said and you'll come
[2:04:34] into a service, he said there's
[2:04:36] something in you that's calling.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; There's something in you that's saying I
[2:04:41] shouldn't do that. Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; That is, he said, that body
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; over there that's calling out for this.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; I come to this pulpit today realizing I
[2:04:54] haven't got just some little sermon for
[2:04:56] you. That's not what it is. But I am
[2:04:58] responding to by the Holy Spirit to what
[2:05:01] your body yonder is calling for.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; And he brings it to the natural again.
[2:05:07] He always brings it to the natural. How
[2:05:09] I said when you were a baby you were
[2:05:11] being formed in the womb of your mother
[2:05:13] coming from your natural gene or your
[2:05:15] father coming out for expression
[2:05:18] descending into this world.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; You say descending? Where was I? You
[2:05:23] were in the mind of God.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; You were in the thoughts of God. And I
[2:05:29] tell you what, it's a far cry down here
[2:05:32] from where we once were.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; There was no darkness in that mind.
[2:05:37] There's no sin in that mind. There's
[2:05:39] none of the things in that mind that we
[2:05:42] have here. We've descended down
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; into a very dark place.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; But that's why he said, "Have no fear. I
[2:05:50] won't leave you here. I'm going to take
[2:05:52] you out of here.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take you home."
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; And you're going to come up. You're
[2:06:01] going to be resur. You're going to
[2:06:02] ascend the same way I ascended.
[2:06:05] How how was it? But following every word
[2:06:08] by taking that prophet's word that is
[2:06:11] your mentor and you eat it and you
[2:06:13] digest it
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; and while you pray and while you call
[2:06:16] upon him and you have a sense I have a
[2:06:19] certain need within me. Have no fear.
[2:06:22] God's going to call someone behind the
[2:06:24] pulpit and they're going to speak
[2:06:25] exactly what your body needs.
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:33] You ought to be standing and shouting.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm preaching because that's
[2:06:39] the truth of God's word.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Isn't he a kind heavenly father?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Isn't he a kind heavenly father?
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; And he says, I came I came from a poor
[2:06:51] family. He said we didn't hardly have
[2:06:54] anything. But he said, "Mother would
[2:06:57] start craving for something." Oh, she'
[2:06:59] just start craving for something. Her
[2:07:01] body was calling for it, for the child,
[2:07:04] for the oncoming child. And how they
[2:07:07] want to make everything just right. Why
[2:07:09] is he referring to that? Because he's
[2:07:11] saying to those people, "Almighty God
[2:07:14] has prepared everything for you. He laid
[2:07:17] out every word." Do you realize the
[2:07:19] change of this body, the change of its
[2:07:21] atoms is already there in the word? It's
[2:07:24] already laying there and God's going to
[2:07:25] just anoint it at the right time and
[2:07:27] you'll take one more step.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; But you're taking a step right now.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; You're taking a step today.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; I announce to you, you are in an
[2:07:37] ascension already.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; You're a long ways from where you used
[2:07:45] to be.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; You're in an ascension now.
[2:07:53] And that's how he descended.
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; He descended
[2:07:58] cuz the word said he must.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; The word said he must suffer. The word
[2:08:05] said he must go to a suppler. The word
[2:08:08] said all of those things. But the word
[2:08:10] also said that his body would not see
[2:08:13] corruption.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; And before he went there, he had
[2:08:17] confidence in that word as well. He had
[2:08:20] confidence in the word that said he must
[2:08:21] die. He must suffer. He must be put to
[2:08:25] shame. He had confidence in that word.
[2:08:27] But he had confidence in the next one
[2:08:29] also that said that his body shall not
[2:08:32] see corruption.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; And he knew he's going to come out of
[2:08:35] there.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; He He did He didn't just sit back home
[2:08:40] in Galilee and say, "Well, you know,
[2:08:41] Father, I know it's all been
[2:08:42] predestinated. It's just going to
[2:08:44] happen." And don't be deceived.
[2:08:47] doesn't happen that way.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; It happens from that fervent spirit,
[2:08:52] zealous spirit, holding and feasting on
[2:08:55] every word, hanging on to every word.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; You young men with the mind of God,
[2:09:01] don't waste it on all the stuff of the
[2:09:03] world and just trying to learn a whole
[2:09:05] bunch of stuff that's going to pass
[2:09:06] away. This that I'm telling you about
[2:09:08] will never pass away.
[2:09:10] [Applause]
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; You want to leave here, folks.
[2:09:15] You don't want to be left for what? You
[2:09:17] don't want to be left here for what
[2:09:18] Satan's got in store.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; You just take this that you have. Take
[2:09:22] the Holy Spirit out. Take the bride out
[2:09:24] and multiply what's here. Turn it loose.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; It'll be rampant.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; You talk about same-sex marriage, that's
[2:09:32] just nothing
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; compared to what's in store.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; All this pornography
[2:09:39] and the abuse of children. You think
[2:09:42] when our Lord Jesus said suffer the
[2:09:44] little children to come unto me and
[2:09:45] forbid them not. You think his mind has
[2:09:48] not changed about children, it has not
[2:09:50] changed one bit. And here they're
[2:09:52] killing these children and abusing these
[2:09:54] children. Things just hennious things
[2:09:57] that are taking place. You think God
[2:09:59] doesn't say that God's going to destroy
[2:10:01] this world for that?
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, I'll just
[2:10:12] take another few minutes. I'm going to
[2:10:13] quit now. For what the law could not do
[2:10:16] in that it was weak through the flesh.
[2:10:18] God sending his own son in the likeness
[2:10:21] of sinful flesh. That's where he came
[2:10:24] like sinful flesh
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; to to condemn sin in the flesh
[2:10:33] who his own self bore our sins in his
[2:10:37] own body
[2:10:39] on the tree that we being dead to sin
[2:10:42] should live unto righteousness
[2:10:44] by whose stripes we are healed.
[2:10:49] The type
[2:10:51] I want to leave this with you. The type
[2:10:55] and form of body
[2:10:58] is paramount in the first coming of
[2:11:01] Christ. Paramount because the body had
[2:11:06] to pay the sacrifice.
[2:11:09] In this coming there is no body to go.
[2:11:14] He has paid the price.
[2:11:16] And now what he has said and he
[2:11:18] concluded it with his prophet in his
[2:11:20] last few words.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; I go and I'm preparing a place for you.
[2:11:26] And if there's anything we ought to hear
[2:11:27] in the message, we certainly ought to
[2:11:29] hear those last comments,
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; those last instructions.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; And if you know who was speaking
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; then it will have the positive effect
[2:11:39] upon you.
[2:11:42] So I don't say, "Well, this is what
[2:11:45] brother Brandham said." No, I say
[2:11:49] 2,000 years hence from when he spoke it
[2:11:52] in the in up in a Passover chamber.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; 2,000 years later,
[2:11:59] he
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; came back
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; to manifest himself
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; in a prophet, in a perfect ministry, and
[2:12:07] he proved who he was.
[2:12:10] Hallelujah.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; And he's sealing off that ministry and
[2:12:15] he's telling uh people that will hear it
[2:12:17] and he's putting it on a tape so that
[2:12:19] the that the children that are still to
[2:12:21] be born shall hear it
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; and not mistake it
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; go to prepare a place for you
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; that where I am.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; We're not listening to something spoken
[2:12:35] 2,000 years ago. I was spoke here hear
[2:12:37] something spoken to this generation
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; and to a people who can say I have been
[2:12:41] called and birthed under this very
[2:12:44] ministry
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; which ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:12:49] in Luke 17:30 I've been birthed under
[2:12:52] the revealing of Jesus Christ
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; and he told me
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; he told me just before he would silence
[2:13:01] the lips that could speak it.
[2:13:06] I go to prepare a place
[2:13:09] for you
[2:13:12] that where I am,
[2:13:15] where he where he is.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; You too will come there and be there.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; And it's so close.
[2:13:28] feels like I can reach out and just
[2:13:31] touch that other realm.
[2:13:34] If I took all the other things the
[2:13:37] sisters sang about the theophony, that
[2:13:39] theophony is right beside you.
[2:13:45] You say, "Well, that sounds spooky."
[2:13:48] Paul said, "If this body be dissolved,
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; we have another."
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; Not we will have. Do you believe it? Do
[2:13:57] you believe the Apostle Paul?
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; We have another
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Aeonian eternal
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; in the heavens.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; It's in the heavens. That's where heaven
[2:14:07] is.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Not 150 million light years. It's
[2:14:10] another dimension. It's another realm.
[2:14:11] It's a faster one
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; right beside you.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; And God is going to pull. You've had a
[2:14:17] yearning. You've had something calling
[2:14:18] you. And God will call someone to the
[2:14:20] pullpit because your body over there is
[2:14:22] calling for it.
[2:14:35] If
[2:14:36] we have borne the image
[2:14:40] of the
[2:14:43] earthly,
[2:14:46] we shall also
[2:14:48] bear the image of the heavenly.
[2:14:55] I haven't lost my thought. I have a
[2:14:58] picture.
[2:15:00] I wonder if the brothers can you show
[2:15:01] this picture, please.
[2:15:29] How many here know who that is?
[2:15:32] Let me see your hand.
[2:15:34] One,
[2:15:36] two,
[2:15:38] three,
[2:15:41] four.
[2:15:47] One is not too sure. He's going like
[2:15:48] this.
[2:15:50] I'll call him five anyway. Six. All
[2:15:52] right.
[2:15:55] I wonder if this person would come down
[2:15:57] here and join me a moment.
[2:16:05] Hope he didn't have to go home.
[2:16:17] He's coming. He just moves a little
[2:16:18] slower now
[2:16:21] than he used to.
[2:16:31] Deacons open the doors and
[2:16:34] let the man in.
[2:16:40] He's nervous, too, cuz he doesn't know
[2:16:41] what I'm going to do.
[2:16:57] I'll let you get even with me someday.
[2:17:02] Now we know who it is.
[2:17:05] Now here's a book up here.
[2:17:08] This fellow here,
[2:17:13] his knowledge of mechanics
[2:17:15] is pretty much zero.
[2:17:18] He doesn't know anything about
[2:17:20] mechanics.
[2:17:21] His
[2:17:23] knowledge of taking hold of a motor and
[2:17:26] tearing it apart and replacing parts and
[2:17:30] by the time he's done not having half of
[2:17:32] them left over
[2:17:34] and doing it right
[2:17:38] and seeing the thing drive out his
[2:17:40] knowledge there of that is just I think
[2:17:44] pretty close to zero.
[2:17:47] That'd be about right.
[2:17:50] This is one of his books.
[2:17:53] It's quite comprehensive.
[2:17:55] It's the fundamentals.
[2:17:59] And this man here, who once was this boy
[2:18:02] here, had to start going through here
[2:18:06] and learning how the crankshaft turned,
[2:18:10] learning how the gears in the cam shaft,
[2:18:13] and had to understand the engine
[2:18:15] components.
[2:18:17] And and as he studied this and as he
[2:18:20] moved through the pages of this, he
[2:18:23] actually ascended
[2:18:25] from a boy that couldn't make a living
[2:18:28] to a man that supports a family
[2:18:32] to a man that gets other people out of
[2:18:35] trouble. And only thing he could do it
[2:18:38] is take and literally devour this a page
[2:18:42] at a time. Did you have any trouble
[2:18:44] along the way?
[2:18:47] Some
[2:18:49] didn't understand it all first time.
[2:18:53] Did you ever fail a test?
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; Probably. He doesn't remember. There are
[2:18:59] some things we blank out of our minds.
[2:19:04] We have other people here and I
[2:19:06] guarantee you they could only be
[2:19:09] transferred. It was a transferral. They
[2:19:13] get transferred from what they were to
[2:19:16] what they are. And I can tell you it
[2:19:19] depended very very much on the book.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; It depended on the book.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you do. It depends on
[2:19:30] the book.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; I can guarantee you. You might, you
[2:19:33] know, Brother Edwin Dodge was a flew a
[2:19:37] incredible jet. just sends chills on
[2:19:40] down my back when I see that uh uh
[2:19:43] monstrous machine that he flew as a jet
[2:19:46] with four nuclear bombs on it. And to
[2:19:49] think that that brother sits here, I
[2:19:52] admire him because I I look at that that
[2:19:54] you know his head you know gray but one
[2:19:58] day and he didn't get it by just getting
[2:20:01] and sitting in another seat and flying
[2:20:03] beside somebody and says well brother
[2:20:05] Edwin this is what you do. He wouldn't
[2:20:06] have said, "Brother Edwin, but captain,
[2:20:08] this is what you do. You pull this
[2:20:09] stick. You do that. You push all these
[2:20:10] buttons here all over the ceiling and
[2:20:12] all the rest of it." Got it? You're on
[2:20:14] your own. I tell you what, he'd have
[2:20:17] been on his own for sure. No, they study
[2:20:20] they study the winds and study this and
[2:20:23] study the atmosphere and this kind of
[2:20:24] cloud and that kind of cloud and and
[2:20:26] everything all about it and how to
[2:20:28] navigate and how to move and the
[2:20:30] engineering and how the system works,
[2:20:32] etc., etc. For those of you that were
[2:20:34] here at Brother Edwin got a citation
[2:20:37] from the from the president, I guess it
[2:20:40] was for for something very very
[2:20:42] ingenious that he didn't even learn in
[2:20:44] the book, but he was flying his jet and
[2:20:46] one of the engines caught on fire. And
[2:20:48] they put on put on the extinguishing
[2:20:51] system. Brother Randy, this should
[2:20:54] excite you. He put on the extinguishing
[2:20:56] system to put out the fire and the and
[2:20:58] the instrument said the fire's out. But
[2:21:02] there was something in him that caused
[2:21:04] him and I believe it was nothing less
[2:21:06] than God himself caused him. He changed
[2:21:10] the attitude of his plane and flew into
[2:21:12] the clouds because the engines cannot be
[2:21:16] seen from the cockpit and he wanted to
[2:21:19] make sure the instrument said the fire's
[2:21:21] out. But he flew into the clouds and saw
[2:21:24] in the reflection of the clouds that his
[2:21:27] plane was still on fire.
[2:21:30] And he took other measures and other
[2:21:32] extinguishing measures. And the and the
[2:21:34] citation that he got from the government
[2:21:37] said, "Captain Edwin Dods saved his
[2:21:41] plane and his crew and gave him a high
[2:21:45] award for that because he used something
[2:21:48] else." Now, that was something that
[2:21:50] wasn't in the book, but I can guarantee
[2:21:51] you he learned a big percentage of what
[2:21:54] he knows by going through a book. I've
[2:21:56] got another book. And they didn't. You
[2:21:59] don't just go to the end of the book and
[2:22:01] say, "Okay, now I think I'll do this
[2:22:03] first." A lot of people like to read the
[2:22:04] last chapter.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; They don't want all the work that goes
[2:22:09] in between. Tell you what, friends,
[2:22:10] we're not just last chapter people, but
[2:22:13] we we go through this book.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; This has got the mechanics and the
[2:22:18] dynamics.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. God bless you. God
[2:22:24] bless you. From that to this.
[2:22:28] Maybe sometimes he wish he was that once
[2:22:31] again, but nevertheless, and we're going
[2:22:33] to go from
[2:22:37] here
[2:22:40] to the final
[2:22:43] even so
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; come Lord Jesus.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; And I trust that this mo this morning
[2:22:53] you'll be able to take these things as
[2:22:55] far as I got. Lord, helping me. I took a
[2:22:58] long time,
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; but the purpose, the full purpose is so
[2:23:04] that you walk out of here and not
[2:23:05] putting the ascending or the ascension
[2:23:08] or the rapture up someplace as some
[2:23:10] future event. But it's important that
[2:23:12] you say, "I'm in it now.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; I'm in it now." And how you get higher
[2:23:18] is hearing the next word. But it
[2:23:21] wouldn't mean anything. Listen to this
[2:23:22] as I close. No, the key really is he
[2:23:26] says God you you have something in you
[2:23:31] and what he has said I want to say to
[2:23:33] this people today do you have
[2:23:37] just something in you
[2:23:40] it might be saying that's not exactly
[2:23:42] right you've talked to me about that or
[2:23:46] it might be oh God what a yearning I
[2:23:50] have what a thirst I Now what a hunger
[2:23:54] is laying here in my heart.
[2:23:58] And when you look at that, listen to me
[2:24:00] now. That isn't something that many
[2:24:04] times we think that this spiritual thing
[2:24:06] hunger came because we had a certain
[2:24:09] circumstances that happened around us
[2:24:11] and kind of created and we got
[2:24:12] melancholy and so on. It's not that. But
[2:24:15] it's when God when God himself begins to
[2:24:20] create within you that
[2:24:23] deep
[2:24:25] longing
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; that you cannot escape.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; That didn't happen because certain
[2:24:32] things happened around you. That was
[2:24:34] created because your body on the other
[2:24:37] side right not far from you is calling
[2:24:39] for it. Amen.
[2:24:41] &gt;&gt; It's calling for it
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; and it is fulfilling the words of the
[2:24:44] Lord Jesus. I go to prepare a place for
[2:24:47] you. And if you have that desire, if you
[2:24:50] have it within you and you have had it,
[2:24:52] then you're one person that ought to
[2:24:53] say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you, oh
[2:24:56] God. You created a wonderful place here
[2:24:59] and we created this for us."
[2:25:03] Mountains. Some people like mountains,
[2:25:06] plains.
[2:25:08] Some people like the plains, the
[2:25:09] deserts, whatever more. He created it
[2:25:12] for you so you could enjoy it. Just
[2:25:15] think, what will it be when we get over
[2:25:18] yonder?
[2:25:20] Father,
[2:25:24] it's hard to quit. It's hard to stop
[2:25:27] talking about the place that I feel is
[2:25:30] so near to us.
[2:25:33] Oh God,
[2:25:36] let this not be a day like other days,
[2:25:39] and let not the coming days be as the
[2:25:42] last week, but let the people I pray,
[2:25:45] Father, you'll make them, even as I have
[2:25:48] been so conscious,
[2:25:52] eating and partaking
[2:25:54] of what you have laid down. And uh some
[2:25:58] of the last things, Lord, surely it must
[2:26:01] have been so significant, so significant
[2:26:04] that you would inspire,
[2:26:07] prompt, and guide the very words that
[2:26:11] were to be left for us, Lord. And how it
[2:26:14] quickens the word and makes it alive to
[2:26:17] us. Father, I pray that you'll grant
[2:26:19] that for each of the people that are
[2:26:22] listening today. Bless this day
[2:26:25] immensely and the day we have a time of
[2:26:30] refreshment and rest and we'll come back
[2:26:32] this evening. Oh God, do anoint dear
[2:26:35] Lord the service and our brother Lance
[2:26:37] as he delivers his word, the word that
[2:26:40] you've given him and his soul in Jesus
[2:26:43] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Let's
[2:26:47] stand, shall we? What will it be when we
[2:26:49] get over here? What will it be when we
[2:26:54] over yonder
[2:27:04] sea.
[2:27:08] We'll join our loved ones at Crown
[2:27:11] Christ forever.
[2:27:16] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[2:27:21] me. What will it be?
[2:27:25] What will it be when we get over yonder
[2:27:33] and
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; the glassy sea
[2:27:40] and we
[2:27:44] [Music]
[2:27:45] forever.
[2:27:49] Oh, this is just what heaven means to
[2:27:54] me.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; We just had July 1st, which is called
[2:27:58] Canada Day, and tomorrow is July 4th.
[2:28:02] This is Memorial Day, I believe.
[2:28:05] And and the people become very patriotic
[2:28:07] and fly flags and sing their anthem,
[2:28:12] and that's all good. I think people
[2:28:15] should be loyal, patriotic, so on.
[2:28:19] But we have another land.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; We have another city. We have another
[2:28:23] country. We have another citizenship.
[2:28:25] And I think whenever we sing, the song
[2:28:27] leader has us lead in song. We sing and
[2:28:31] worship to him. See this one who's
[2:28:34] called you.
[2:28:36] Hallelujah.
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, I'm just ready to
[2:28:40] burst.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; I feel like this old these bars of bone
[2:28:45] got to burst open.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; Why? because I've been feeding on the
[2:28:49] word.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Feeding on the next word, brother David.
[2:28:53] Feeding on the next word. Feed on it, my
[2:28:55] friends. Feed on it. It's an ascending
[2:28:57] word. You'll never believe this message
[2:28:59] and go in a descent.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; You'll never believe this message and go
[2:29:03] into a tail spin.
[2:29:06] [Applause]
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Only one way. It's up.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it, friends?
[2:29:18] Sing it then for me. What will it be
[2:29:23] when we get over young?
[2:29:27] [Music]
[2:29:31] [Applause]
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; This is a promise now. We'll join our
[2:29:39] loved ones hands
[2:29:42] forever.
[2:29:45] Oh.
[2:29:46] This ain't just what heaven means to me.
[2:29:55] Hallelujah.
[2:30:00] Father,
[2:30:02] as the people depart this place and
[2:30:05] ponder these things and hold it in their
[2:30:08] heart, I ask, oh God, that the Holy
[2:30:13] Spirit
[2:30:14] will make it such a reality.
[2:30:18] and father
[2:30:20] kind he heavenly father who has brought
[2:30:23] us here to this time
[2:30:26] let us not be weary and welloing
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; I want to pray for each one and you that
[2:30:34] might have something
[2:30:36] pulling strong within you may want to
[2:30:39] just lift up your heart open up your
[2:30:42] heart lift up your hand oh God it's me
[2:30:45] it's me see me Just now look down. See
[2:30:50] this great thirst I have. Oh God,
[2:30:55] let the people know the shortity.
[2:30:59] There is one just beyond this little
[2:31:04] transparent curtain of time. A body you
[2:31:09] have prepared. A mansion. Not one
[2:31:12] that'll get old. Oh God, not one that's
[2:31:16] got to struggle through the teenage
[2:31:18] years, but one that is in the perfection
[2:31:21] as you saw us in the first place. And
[2:31:24] that's how it will be. And how your
[2:31:26] messenger said we'll live together. And
[2:31:29] I say amen.
[2:31:31] And one that we we will work together,
[2:31:33] we'll live together, we'll be happy. And
[2:31:35] I said, amen. Take away the heaviness,
[2:31:38] oh God. Take away the discouragement, oh
[2:31:40] God. Take away the depression, oh God.
[2:31:43] those things that come from this life
[2:31:45] and this world, take it away.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; May the people live with that joy and
[2:31:51] anticipation.
[2:31:54] Send us from this place with our hearts
[2:31:56] filled
[2:31:58] and let us be fulfilled, oh God, in this
[2:32:01] life. We want to be faithful to you.
[2:32:04] Bring us back now, Lord, in just a short
[2:32:07] while. We hear this service this
[2:32:09] evening. Let no one miss, oh God, what
[2:32:12] you have for us. In the name of Jesus
[2:32:14] Christ, dismiss us now we pray. Amen.
[2:32:18] Amen. God bless you. I'm dismissing you.
[2:32:22] The name of Jesus Christ. I pray that
[2:32:24] you'll have a a little rest. Don't wear
[2:32:27] yourself out this afternoon. Come back
[2:32:28] fresh for the evening service 5:00. God
[2:32:30] bless you.
[2:32:32] [Music]
[2:34:43] Thank you.
