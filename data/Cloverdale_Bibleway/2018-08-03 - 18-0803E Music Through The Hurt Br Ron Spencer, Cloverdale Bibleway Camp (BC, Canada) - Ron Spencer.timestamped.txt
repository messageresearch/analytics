[0:05] Saint in your position. Watch the
[0:08] miraculous
[0:10] come into action.
[0:14] My God is tremendous. His strength never
[0:18] failth. He goes through the fire just to
[0:22] save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty.
[0:27] He sends his angels
[0:30] to guide me.
[0:33] There is no storm too powerful. My God
[0:37] cannot handle. Our God in simplicity
[0:41] revealing you and me came down from his
[0:45] glory and gave us the victory. The
[0:49] greatest goal. Just one more time. My
[0:51] God is tremendous. My God is tremendous.
[0:55] His strength never failth. He goes
[0:59] through the fire just to save a sinner.
[1:03] Yes, he is almighty.
[1:06] He sends his angels
[1:09] to guide me.
[1:12] There is no storm that my God cannot
[1:16] handle. My God in simplicity
[1:20] revealed in you and me came down from
[1:23] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[1:28] greatest love story.
[1:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's my God.
[1:35] My God is tremendous. Hallelujah. Even a
[1:39] little testimony last night. A young man
[1:41] in our cabin began to be struck with a
[1:43] seizure and it woke me up. I got down
[1:45] with him. I just laid my hands on and
[1:47] just began to say the name of Jesus and
[1:48] within seconds that seizure stopped. He
[1:51] just continued to breathe labor and I
[1:52] just began to sing there's power in the
[1:54] name of Jesus. Within two minutes he was
[1:56] completely peaceful and God had changed
[1:58] the situation. I said that's the power
[2:00] of my God. Hallelujah.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Praise our God. There is power in the
[2:06] name of Jesus. We don't have to bow down
[2:08] to those spirit saints. We know that
[2:11] seizure is a demon that has to bow
[2:13] before the name of Jesus.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, is there a need on your heart
[2:17] that you just need to speak the name of
[2:18] Jesus over? Tonight, we're going to ask
[2:20] the brothers to come. We're going to
[2:21] have an offering this meeting. Our
[2:23] brother Tom's going to come. I felt
[2:25] maybe we should sing that song. There is
[2:26] power in the name of Jesus to break
[2:29] every chain. I believe we've been
[2:31] hearing chains break this weekend
[2:32] already. We hear him hit the ground and
[2:35] hands that are free have been lifted in
[2:36] worship to our God. And hearts that were
[2:39] bound, amen, have been set free to
[2:41] worship our God. And he's not done. He
[2:43] has something he wants to do tonight for
[2:45] you saints. Hallelujah. Let's just
[2:47] worship him together as we sing this. We
[2:50] do have a prayer request. A sister
[2:51] that's just asked to remain anonymous
[2:54] has just asked that we'd please remember
[2:55] the family of a young man named Juan
[2:57] who's just passed away. And as they are
[2:59] grieving during this time, that God
[3:00] would just be with them, be a comfort to
[3:03] them, and make himself known to them.
[3:04] And how we would just desire the prayers
[3:07] of the saints if we were in that
[3:08] situation. So, let's remember this
[3:10] family tonight. If there's a need on
[3:12] your heart, just as we would go to
[3:14] prayer and the brothers would come,
[3:15] let's sing this. There is power in the
[3:17] name of Jesus. Hallelujah.
[3:20] Oh, there is power
[3:25] in the name of Jesus.
[3:30] There is power.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; There is power.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. In the name of Jesus,
[3:43] there is power
[3:47] in the name of Jesus.
[3:53] To break every chain to break every
[3:58] chain. Break every chain.
[4:04] to break every chain. Break every chain.
[4:10] Break it. Let's sing that chorus again.
[4:12] Let's pick it up.
[4:14] Oh, there is power.
[4:19] Oh, in the name of Jesus.
[4:23] There is power.
[4:27] Oh yes. In the name of Jesus.
[4:35] There is power
[4:39] in the name of Jesus
[4:44] special that had had a
[4:52] chain. Let's sing that again.
[4:56] Break every chain. Break every chain.
[5:01] Break every chain. There is power. There
[5:07] is power
[5:10] in the name of Jesus.
[5:17] There is power
[5:20] in the name of Jesus.
[5:27] There is power
[5:31] in the name of Jesus
[5:37] to break every chain. Break every chain.
[5:43] Break every chain.
[5:48] Break every chain. Break every chain.
[5:53] Break every chain.
[5:58] Part of our worship
[6:01] is our giving. And the brothers have now
[6:04] put the different tables out as you
[6:06] enter the uh tent. And there are um
[6:10] envelopes made available to everyone if
[6:13] you'd like to put uh something in that
[6:16] and mark it to where you'd like it to
[6:18] go. But we would like to um give an
[6:22] offering of course to the servants of
[6:24] God and how that he has been used by God
[6:29] and we want to show our appreciation and
[6:32] we have uh we have over the years young
[6:34] people at winter camp and summer camp.
[6:38] This is a part of our worship. Don't
[6:40] expect your mommy and daddy to do it.
[6:42] That is not your sacrifice. That is not
[6:45] your offering and that's not your
[6:47] giving. You need to be able to dig deep
[6:49] and say, "Lord, I want to give a part of
[6:52] my worship,
[6:53] &gt;&gt; what substance you give me."
[6:55] &gt;&gt; And if you if you can sacrifice for God,
[6:58] that's what you should do and learn
[6:59] early and watch God come behind and and
[7:02] and and show his blessing upon your
[7:05] life. But we don't do it for the
[7:06] blessing. We do it because it's a
[7:08] commandment in the scripture. And don't
[7:11] and and don't just put it off. You
[7:13] should be a willing giver. A willing
[7:17] giver to the kingdom of God. And so we
[7:20] just want to ask the Lord just to to
[7:22] bless this service, bless this meeting,
[7:24] and bless this offering to the Lord.
[7:27] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[7:29] Our dear heavenly father,
[7:32] we've been amazed
[7:34] at the moving of the Holy Spirit. how
[7:38] you've taken men of God to minister
[7:40] deeply to the lives and the hearts of
[7:43] your children. And Lord Jesus, as we
[7:46] even heard this morning, you've called
[7:48] kings to battle, and we're willing to do
[7:51] battle this evening. We're willing to
[7:53] stand on the word of God. As brother
[7:56] Spencer said last night, we're willing
[7:58] to mark the spot where you've dealt with
[8:00] us and moved upon our lives. And so,
[8:04] Lord, I'm asking that you will move once
[8:06] again, anointing your servant to
[8:08] minister life to your people. Break the
[8:12] bread of life to us. Lord, feed the
[8:14] hungry, Lord. Break the bread.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Heal the sick.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Deliver the needy. Lord,
[8:21] &gt;&gt; you're the same yesterday, today, and
[8:24] forever. A family is grieving. They've
[8:27] lost someone, a loved one. Lord, would
[8:30] you pour in the grace to them this
[8:32] evening? But as the scripture says to
[8:35] the believer, we do not grieve as
[8:37] others. We have a promise of the
[8:39] resurrection. And so, Lord, we pray that
[8:41] you'll deal with that family that they
[8:44] would have a hope within the
[8:45] resurrection, our Lord Jesus Christ. And
[8:49] so, Lord, a part of our worship tonight
[8:51] is in our giving. And we just pray,
[8:54] Lord, that you will bless those that
[8:57] have given to the kingdom. They haven't
[9:00] given it to man, but they've given it to
[9:02] you, Lord. Would you multiply it? And
[9:06] God, may you be glorified through it,
[9:08] Lord. Bless these young people as they
[9:12] learn not only to worship in the
[9:14] natural, but they're willing to worship
[9:18] in their giving. Lord bless each and
[9:20] everyone as we commit now this offering
[9:23] to you and this evening service in Jesus
[9:26] name. Amen. Amen. You may have your
[9:30] seats.
[9:34] You can keep on playing. Brother Ben,
[9:36] I'd like to make a a couple of
[9:38] announcements as we are um having a
[9:42] special I believe. Uh, Sister Hannah and
[9:44] Ava, you'll be ready, if you wouldn't
[9:46] mind, to come up and be ready after I'm
[9:48] finished these announcements.
[9:50] I'd like to make a quick announcement
[9:52] regarding the home church. On Sunday,
[9:55] last Sunday, we had suggested that those
[9:58] that were unable to come across the
[10:00] border that we would open the church and
[10:02] we would have um a streaming there. But
[10:05] we have our own challenges and it's a
[10:08] streaming challenge even here. And so,
[10:11] uh, we won't be able to have the church
[10:12] open. And so, those that will be
[10:14] streaming this evening at your home, um,
[10:18] and you can't make it, it would be best
[10:20] then, to stream in your own residence,
[10:25] mark that down. And if you know of
[10:28] somebody that is not able to come across
[10:31] that you'd get a hold of them and let
[10:33] them know that there will not be
[10:35] streaming at the local church on this
[10:38] Sunday.
[10:39] On Sunday, uh the our last service, the
[10:44] campgrounds is open for all those that
[10:47] want to stay and have a have a picnic or
[10:50] time to fellowship with one another. the
[10:53] um the eating hall is only open to those
[10:58] that are registered campers here at at
[11:03] uh at the camp. Um I'm sorry to we would
[11:06] love to feed everybody if it was
[11:09] possible, but the uh kitchen only has
[11:12] limited amount of of space, limited
[11:15] amount of equipment, just limited amount
[11:18] that we can only feed so many. So there
[11:21] are those maybe that have been eating
[11:22] with with the campers over this week and
[11:26] we'd again we'd love to have you but
[11:28] it's impossible to feed everybody. We
[11:30] have some more people coming from um uh
[11:33] the local assembly onto grounds this
[11:36] this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon
[11:38] being that it's a weekend a long
[11:40] weekend. So if you're not a registered
[11:42] camper on grounds there are restaurants
[11:45] down the road. Uh Cloud9 is one that uh
[11:48] I've eaten with the brothers. It's It's
[11:50] fine. That's good. Um and if if you need
[11:53] to go towards Bellingham, there's many
[11:56] restaurants down that way. Um
[12:04] I think that's it for those
[12:06] announcements. We have uh a precious
[12:09] brother Stephen from Malawi that has
[12:12] come and he's here this this service and
[12:15] I believe he's standing in the back.
[12:17] Brother Steven, we'd like you to stand,
[12:19] please. We'd like to acknowledge you.
[12:22] Welcome.
[12:26] God bless you, Brother Steven. Many
[12:29] years have gone by. Brother Biscll was
[12:31] saying that you were in the meetings
[12:32] when Brother Ed was in in Zimbabwe and
[12:35] now you're here these many years. We
[12:37] we're happy to see you. Happy to have
[12:39] you with us this evening. God bless you
[12:42] and all those that have joined from
[12:44] Edmonton, from all the provinces, from
[12:47] Europe, from the States. God bless you.
[12:50] We've had a wonderful time. We've had a
[12:53] wonderful camp. Now, we had a wonderful
[12:56] day today, young people.
[13:02] Nobody got killed.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[13:13] Now, a lot of people will never
[13:15] understand that statement because they
[13:17] were not here and we don't want to let
[13:19] them know what we did. But Sister Joanne
[13:22] breathes uh a lot easier today knowing
[13:26] that nobody got hurt, everybody was
[13:28] fine, and we had a wonderful time. Now,
[13:31] if you took that amount of energy that
[13:33] was spent today and brought it to camp
[13:37] tonight,
[13:38] What kind of a service, brother Sam,
[13:41] would we have?
[13:42] &gt;&gt; So, I I don't want to see anybody
[13:44] sleeping or nodding off that energy that
[13:47] I saw and you know, I went to every
[13:50] station and we checked you out
[13:54] and if you could do that for natural
[13:57] enjoyment, we are here to put in our
[14:00] best
[14:02] &gt;&gt; for the kingdom of God. So, I say God
[14:05] bless you and God bless this uh time
[14:08] that we've had together and welcome
[14:11] everyone that has made this meeting
[14:13] possible. Hannah, Ava, and whoever else
[14:16] is uh singing, would you please come?
[14:20] God bless you. Be pulling on the word
[14:22] tonight. Our dear brother Ron Spencer
[14:25] will be ministering this evening. He
[14:27] won't need uh any introduction. He's
[14:30] going to come straight to the pulpit and
[14:32] God is going to use the man of God to
[14:35] minister to every heart. So, God bless
[14:37] you.
[15:18] When I'm feeling afraid,
[15:24] full of uncertainties,
[15:30] when the plans that I made
[15:34] all fall apart
[15:42] when the future's unclear.
[15:48] And all that I can do is wait.
[15:55] There is a promise
[15:58] echoing in my heart.
[16:05] that he will be faithful to the end.
[16:12] He will provide time and time again.
[16:18] He will be faithful,
[16:22] faithful to the end.
[16:30] He will be there when all else fades.
[16:36] His love is stronger than my pain.
[16:42] He will be faithful,
[16:47] faithful to the end.
[16:57] There is grace I can't measure.
[17:03] Mercy I don't deserve.
[17:09] There's forgiveness that's endless
[17:14] for me.
[17:21] Oh, what a blessed assurance
[17:27] to know how deeply I'm loved.
[17:33] And I'm always reminded
[17:36] he will be all I need.
[17:41] All I need.
[17:45] faithful to the end.
[17:50] He will provide time and time again.
[17:56] He will be faithful,
[18:01] faithful to the end.
[18:08] He will be there when all else fades.
[18:14] His love is stronger than my pain.
[18:21] He will be faithful,
[18:25] faithful to the end.
[18:33] He will be faithful to the end.
[18:39] He will provide time and time again.
[18:45] He will be faithful,
[18:50] faithful to the end.
[18:57] He will be there when all else fades.
[19:03] His love is stronger than my pain.
[19:09] He will be faithful.
[19:14] faithful to the end.
[19:21] He will be faithful,
[19:26] faithful to the end.
[19:34] He will be faithful,
[19:38] faithful to
[19:41] the end.
[19:57] Amen. Thank you, sisters. We're going to
[19:59] ask the young people to come. from uh
[20:00] the young people from Edmonton if they
[20:02] would come and sing for us. Uh maybe as
[20:04] they do, let's just sing Faithful One.
[20:06] So unchanging.
[20:08] Amen. You can just come immediately and
[20:10] start getting ready if you don't mind.

[20:26] of peace.

[20:58] rock in times
[21:02] of trouble.
[21:06] You lift me up
[21:10] when I fall down
[21:14] all through the storm.
[21:17] Your love
[21:20] is
[21:22] the anchor.

[25:25] emancipator as we just turn the service
[25:27] now to our brother Ron as he would just
[25:29] like to come at this time. Once my heart
[25:32] and soul were fed.
[25:35] Amen. There we go. Oh, once
[25:38] my heart and soul were fed.
[25:45] Yes. By
[25:47] the binding chains of sin.
[25:53] Oh yes, but
[25:55] but the great emanipator,
[26:01] he set me free
[26:05] to worship him.
[26:09] Oh glory, glory,
[26:13] glory, hallelujah.
[26:18] Blessed be
[26:21] his holy name.
[26:26] I know he's
[26:28] the great emanipator.
[26:34] That's the song
[26:37] of the redeemer. Amen. And like a lost
[26:40] lamb.
[26:42] And like a lost lamb, I was drifting.
[26:50] I was oh so helpless
[26:54] and alone.
[26:56] But the seeking shepherd,
[26:59] but the seeking shepherd found
[27:04] me. Amen. He led me to led me to my
[27:10] father's home. Oh, worshiping saints.
[27:13] Glory, glory. Oh, glory,

[27:25] be his holy name.
[27:30] Yes, he's
[27:32] the great emancipator.
[27:38] And that's
[27:40] the song of Oh, one more time. Glory,
[27:43] glory. Let's just worship him. Glory,
[27:47] glory,
[27:49] glory, hallelujah.
[27:54] Blessed be
[27:57] his holy name. And let's stand together
[28:01] as we sing it. I know he's
[28:04] the great emanipator.
[28:10] Yes, that's
[28:12] the song.
[28:14] God bless you. Hallelujah.
[28:26] Hallelujah.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; What a day.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] Hallelujah. What a night.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:38] I believe if Satan knew what was good
[28:40] for him, he'd leave the building now.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; Could we amen that?
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have you had a great day?
[28:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I've enjoyed watching you put
[28:54] forth incredible efforts today.

[29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I I believe I've got some
[29:36] good ones on the other end of the line
[29:38] now tonight.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many come expecting something
[29:41] from him?
[29:46] I walked into the service this evening
[29:48] expecting great things.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely great things.
[29:53] Amen. Amen. Could we talk to him just
[29:57] now?
[29:59] Heavenly Father, we bow our heads before
[30:01] you now
[30:04] and we would like to express how much we
[30:07] love you.
[30:09] But our human vocabulary
[30:12] is just not enough.
[30:16] We'd like to tell you how sorry we are
[30:18] for our mistakes and failures and sins.
[30:23] We'd like to thank you for the blood of
[30:25] Jesus Christ that you have provided for
[30:28] us.
[30:30] Lord, we'd like to thank you for this
[30:33] opportunity.
[30:36] another opportunity to stand in your
[30:38] presence
[30:40] in this realm of human
[30:43] instrumentality.
[30:46] Now Lord, this is an opportunity that
[30:50] that all of hell would like to have
[30:54] if they could have the opportunity to
[30:56] step back into this in this arena to
[30:59] hear one more sermon.
[31:02] Just to hear one more sermon. and have
[31:05] an opportunity to make a another choice.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[31:12] &gt;&gt; but there's another dimension that is
[31:14] screaming, a higher dimension screaming.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; They kept the faith.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; They ran the race with everything that
[31:23] was within them.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; And they're screaming for us to finish
[31:27] this race.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I ask you that you would sweep
[31:32] across this audience. Yes, God.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; May may the mighty angels of God sweep
[31:37] into this building tonight. And
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Lord, drive back every enemy of doubt
[31:42] and frustration and fear and unbelief
[31:45] tonight. And I ask you that you would
[31:47] come in a mighty way.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, you've dealt with me in a specific
[31:54] way for this service.
[31:56] And and I ask you now that you would
[31:58] focus our mind and our heart and all of
[32:01] our thoughts even now.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Not about tomorrow or next week or the
[32:06] coming weeks, but
[32:08] &gt;&gt; about where we're standing right now.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; May you just allow us to stand in an
[32:14] eternal bubble just for a bit
[32:17] &gt;&gt; and you speak to our hearts, Father.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; May it be you, Father.
[32:22] May you borrow our bodies as our prophet
[32:25] would say. Give us a temporary
[32:27] resurrection.
[32:29] Lord, speak to us tonight.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Bless the ministry that is here. Bless
[32:35] brother Biscll. Give him strength this
[32:37] afternoon. Sister Bisll.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we're thinking of Brother Ken
[32:42] Ber and Sister Shalley tonight.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Father, you're greater.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; You're greater than tumors and cancers.
[32:51] Hallelujah.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; You're greater than all of that tonight,
[32:54] Father.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; So, we tell Satan, turn him loose
[32:58] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; He's defeated by the power of the word
[33:04] of God.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for these things. And
[33:08] we thank you, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[33:12] name. Amen. And amen. And amen. Amen.
[33:16] God bless you.
[33:18] God bless you.
[33:19] I'd like to turn to Isaiah chapter 65
[33:22] this afternoon.
[33:33] Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16.
[33:39] I would like to speak to you tonight on
[33:41] music through the hurt.
[33:49] Music through the hurt.
[33:56] I'd like to take your mind to I Isaiah's
[34:00] life for a moment.
[34:02] This is a man that's going to face much
[34:04] rejection through his life.
[34:06] This is a man that will be commissioned
[34:10] to lay naked at the gate of the city,
[34:14] not for a day, but for many, many, many,
[34:17] many, many days.
[34:19] This is a man that will be saw aunder.
[34:25] But God will allow him to write some of
[34:28] the most beautiful words,
[34:31] not of literature, but prophetic words.
[34:36] Sometimes we look at the results and we
[34:38] want to see results, but I'd like to
[34:40] read to you results for a little bit and
[34:43] go backwards if I may.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Would that be okay?
[34:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[34:51] Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16.
[34:55] That he who blessth
[34:57] himself in the earth shall bless himself
[34:59] in the God of truth. And he that swearth
[35:03] in the earth shall swear by the God of
[35:05] truth,
[35:06] because the former troubles are
[35:09] forgotten,
[35:11] &gt;&gt; because they are hid from mine eyes.
[35:14] For behold, I create new heavens and new
[35:17] earth, and the former shall not be
[35:21] remembered, nor come into mine.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; But be ye glad and rejoice forever in
[35:27] that which I create. For behold, I
[35:30] created Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her
[35:33] people of joy, and I will rejoice in
[35:37] Jerusalem, and and enjoy in my people,
[35:40] and the voice of weeping shall be found
[35:42] no more heard in her, nor the voice of
[35:46] crying. There shall be no more thin of
[35:50] infant of days, nor an old man that hath
[35:53] not filled his days. For the child shall
[35:57] die a hundred years old, but the sinner
[35:59] be 100 years old shall be accursed. And
[36:02] they shall build houses and inhabit
[36:04] them.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; They shall plant vineyards and eat the
[36:07] fruit of them. They shall not build and
[36:10] another inhabit. They shall not plant
[36:13] and another eat. For as the days of a
[36:16] tree are the days of my people, and mine
[36:19] elect
[36:21] shall enjoy the the work of their hands.
[36:24] They shall not labor in vain, nor bring
[36:27] forth for trouble, for they are the seed
[36:32] of the blessed of the Lord, and their
[36:34] offspring with them.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; And it shall come to pass that before
[36:38] they call, I will answer.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And while they are speaking, I will
[36:43] hear. The wolf and the lamb shall feed
[36:47] together, and the lion shall eat straw
[36:49] like the bullock, and the dust shall be
[36:52] the serpent's meat. And they shall not
[36:54] hurt, nor destroy in my holy mountain,
[36:58] saith the Lord.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; It's talking about you.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[37:10] in Revelations chapter 19. I'd like to
[37:13] read in more scripture about you.
[37:18] This writing comes
[37:20] from a man that's in prison,
[37:23] the worst prison
[37:25] of that day. It's an exile.
[37:29] It's a prison that where that he has
[37:32] been boiled in all. It's a prison to
[37:35] where that there's every kind of a viper
[37:37] and all kinds of spiders and
[37:41] some of the worst prisoners in the
[37:43] entire world are very dear to near to
[37:46] him.
[37:48] But he is commissioned to come up with
[37:50] them
[37:52] &gt;&gt; and to come and see.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; He is brought to a realm to where that
[37:57] he can write prophetic things. Right.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Though his body be trapped in a prison,
[38:06] yet in that realm,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; he can write.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; I'd like to hear him write about you
[38:13] just now. And I heard it was a voice of
[38:16] a great multitude and as a voice of many
[38:20] waters, as a voice of mighty
[38:22] thunderings, saying, "Hallelujah, for
[38:25] the Lord God omnipotent reignth." Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[38:33] honor to him. For the marriage of the
[38:36] Lamb is come, and his wife
[38:40] &gt;&gt; hath made herself ready.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; And to her was granted that she should
[38:46] be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
[38:49] white. For the fine linen is the
[38:52] righteousness of the saints.
[38:55] And he saith unto me, write,
[38:58] blessed are they which are called to the
[39:02] marriage supper of the lambus.
[39:09] Hallelujah.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; That's you.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; With all your critics
[39:17] &gt;&gt; and all the tormentors that have been
[39:19] against you through your life
[39:22] &gt;&gt; and the scars that you have been through
[39:24] in your life and the whispers that have
[39:27] been in your ear over and over and over
[39:30] again. And if you could have a volume
[39:32] button, you'd like to cut them down. I
[39:35] want to say this to you. God writes you
[39:37] a love letter. Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And sings to you, "Blessed are ye
[39:42] because you're called to the marriage
[39:44] supper of the lamb."
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Revelations 21:1,
[39:55] "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[39:58] for the first heaven and the first earth
[40:00] were passed away, and there was no more
[40:03] sea.
[40:05] And I, John, saw the holy city, the new
[40:09] Jerusalem,
[40:11] coming down from God out of heaven,
[40:12] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[40:15] husband. And I heard it, a great voice
[40:19] out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the
[40:22] tabernacle of God is with men,
[40:26] and he will dwell with them, and they
[40:29] shall be his people, and God himself
[40:34] shall be with them,
[40:36] &gt;&gt; and be their God,
[40:38] &gt;&gt; and God shall wipe away all tears from
[40:40] their eyes, and there shall be no more
[40:43] death,
[40:45] &gt;&gt; neither sorrow,
[40:47] nor crying, neither shall there be any
[40:50] more pain.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; For the former things are passed away.
[40:54] And he that sat upon the throne said,
[40:56] Behold, I make all things new.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, rot, for these
[41:04] words are true and faithful.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to remember the author
[41:10] behind the author.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; It's the one that said, "Let there be
[41:15] son." and moon and stars, right?
[41:19] &gt;&gt; And God believed his own word and it
[41:22] came into existence.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; This is the God that is the alpha and
[41:27] the omega, the beginning and the end. He
[41:32] knows what you've been through in your
[41:33] life and he knows where you've came from
[41:36] and where you're going. He's got the
[41:39] whole world in his hands. He is in
[41:42] complete control of everything in our
[41:45] lives.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; This is a promise.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; This is my future.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; This is a reality.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to a place where there's no
[42:04] more death.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Grass won't die. Trees won't die. Leaves
[42:10] won't wither.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Flowers will never fade away again.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; I'll never have another gray hair.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Never have n of glasses.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Never have aching bones. Are you with me
[42:24] now?
[42:26] &gt;&gt; I'm headed to a place that God made me a
[42:29] promise.
[42:31] And the same God that allowed me to to
[42:35] enjoy salvation here on this earth, to
[42:38] know that my sins are forgiven
[42:41] &gt;&gt; and that I can live in perfect peace in
[42:44] this earth.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; When you can come to a spot to where
[42:49] that you realize that your sins are
[42:52] forgiven
[42:54] &gt;&gt; and he paid the price of your
[42:56] redemption, you can live in perfect
[42:59] peace.
[43:01] The same God that said, "Let there be."
[43:04] &gt;&gt; And that said, "I'm going to have a
[43:05] place where there's no more death and no
[43:07] more sorrow." Can stand there tonight
[43:09] and say, "There is therefore now no
[43:11] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[43:14] Jesus."
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Boo devil.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; We do not have to constantly relive sin
[43:22] in our lives.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; We do not constantly have to fall and
[43:27] get back up again. We do not constantly
[43:30] have to be beat over the head by the
[43:32] tormentor. We can live in peace.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; We are not a slave to sin no longer.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story of let it
[43:56] for pressure.
[43:58] He said as a little rabbit.
[44:02] The story
[44:04] the hounds was right behind him.
[44:08] He could feel their hot breath upon his
[44:11] feet.
[44:13] Just a little while, another jump jump
[44:15] or two, the hound was going to get the
[44:18] little fella.
[44:20] He would be gobbled up in just a moment.
[44:24] But after a bit, he saw a hole in the
[44:26] rock
[44:28] and he thought, "If I could only get to
[44:32] that rock,
[44:35] then I'm safe."
[44:38] Just as a dog made a last jump at him,
[44:41] he felt his hot breath on his heels, but
[44:45] he run under the rock.
[44:48] Then he could set down and let off the
[44:50] pressure.
[44:52] The hound could not scratch
[44:55] through that rock.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; We have a rock of ages tonight that's
[45:01] greater than the rock of Jibralta.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; In this rock of ages, you're safe.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; In this rock of ages, God has made a
[45:11] covenant with you to take care of you.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; I'd like to share this with you tonight.
[45:20] I find it incredible. Interesting.
[45:22] Brother Brandham talks about in
[45:24] thirsting for life in Phoenix, Arizona.
[45:28] He said, 'If we could take a trip
[45:30] tonight and go up to heaven,
[45:33] and I'd meet with Father Abraham and I'd
[45:35] say, Abraham,
[45:38] what is the most glorious thing that you
[45:40] have ever known?
[45:42] What's the most essential thing that you
[45:44] have ever known?
[45:46] And Abraham would say to me,
[45:50] "Life
[45:51] eternal."
[45:55] &gt;&gt; And then I take a little trip and we'll
[45:57] go again and we'll go around to the
[45:59] great archangel Gabriel
[46:02] who is the messenger of the covenant to
[46:05] the Jewish people who stands at the
[46:08] right hand of God, one of the highest
[46:11] order of angels in heaven. And I would
[46:14] say to him, Gabriel, thou art a mighty
[46:18] angel.
[46:21] You're loved of God.
[46:24] And you've been here for the eons of
[46:26] time.
[46:28] And you perhaps know everything in the
[46:31] heavens.
[46:33] And where everything is placed, think of
[46:35] this conversation now.
[46:42] You're one of God's right-hand angels.
[46:45] You know the great secrets of heaven.
[46:49] You sounded the trumpet at the coming of
[46:50] the Lord Jesus. You announced the his
[46:54] first coming and you shall announce his
[46:56] second coming.
[46:59] You must be a mighty man or angel.
[47:03] I want to ask you in all of God's
[47:05] treasures,
[47:08] what is the greatest thing that you have
[47:10] found amongst his treasures?
[47:13] And I can see Gabriel bring himself to
[47:15] attention.
[47:20] He said, "The greatest thing that I
[47:21] found in all of God's great treasures
[47:24] since he created me is life.
[47:28] God made me to live eternal
[47:31] for eternity
[47:33] and life is the greatest thing that
[47:37] there is.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; No matter how rich you may be or how
[47:43] popular you may be, no matter how you
[47:45] might be, the greatest thing that there
[47:47] is is that a man can achieve in this
[47:50] earth is to achieve eternal life.
[47:54] Though you might be a king or a
[47:56] potentate, though you rule the world for
[47:58] a million years
[48:01] as a king or a young man and you fail to
[48:04] find eternal life, you've lost the
[48:06] greatest thing that anyone can lose.
[48:11] I've often said if I could be a young
[48:13] man of 25 years old and if God would
[48:16] appear on the platform tonight and say I
[48:18] will turn you to 25 years of age and
[48:22] there you'll remain for a million years
[48:25] and I'll make you king over all the
[48:27] universe.
[48:29] Everything will be at your command or
[48:32] I'll give you a hundred years of misery
[48:34] and woe and trouble and sorrow. But at
[48:38] the end of that hundred years,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; I'll give you eternal life.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; But at the end of the million years, you
[48:46] are lost. Oh, I'd say, Lord God, don't I
[48:50] don't have to wait no longer to make my
[48:53] choice.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Let me have a hundred years of misery
[48:57] and woe and
[48:59] &gt;&gt; any kind of death that you choose for me
[49:02] to die only. Lord, give me eternal life.
[49:07] That's what we're under this tent for
[49:09] tonight.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for riches or fame or
[49:15] I'm not looking for great popularity. I
[49:17] have a great desire for eternal life.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:32] Couple
[49:38] of years ago, my mother who believed
[49:40] this message with all her heart,
[49:44] love this message with everything that
[49:46] was within her.
[49:51] She had a heart attack.
[49:57] And I was at her side. Brother Andrew
[49:59] was at her side. We got there and she
[50:03] was coding.
[50:06] Great doctors were working on her
[50:09] and they were telling us there's just
[50:11] nothing we can do.
[50:13] There's just absolutely nothing we can
[50:15] do. And she was as conscious as I'm
[50:18] conscious now.
[50:20] And she was as in control as I'm in
[50:22] control now. And she began to speak not
[50:27] about what she missed out in life.
[50:32] But she began to speak about her love
[50:34] for Jesus.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; This is what I've lived for.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; The doctor told her one more time,
[50:44] Christine, I have to ask you,
[50:48] can I put you on a machine that you
[50:50] might live and we could hold try to hold
[50:52] your life? And she said these words,
[50:55] "I'm ready to go.
[51:00] I'm ready to go.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, she slipped into
[51:05] another dimension.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; It was not a defeat.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to know tonight, it was not a
[51:15] defeat. It was a victory.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; She stepped out of an old body into a
[51:21] brand new body.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Everything that this message says is
[51:26] reality.
[51:29] And she stepped into another realm where
[51:33] there's no death, where there's no
[51:35] sorrow.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Services like tonight are preparing us
[51:46] for that moment.
[51:54] If I could ask you tonight,
[51:58] he shared a few of these comments in
[52:00] Edmonton, but if I could ask you
[52:01] tonight,
[52:04] God who predestinated you
[52:07] before the foundation of the world,
[52:12] if you could have a conversation with
[52:13] you
[52:16] and call your name,
[52:20] Let me tell you, Sister Tracy,
[52:24] this will be a time to which I'm going
[52:26] to release you into the earth.
[52:31] You'll be born at a certain time in
[52:33] Leoa.
[52:36] It's going to be the darkest age.
[52:40] It's going to be a It's going to be an
[52:41] age full of sin.
[52:44] It's going to be an age to which that
[52:46] insanity
[52:48] is just going to almost rule the world.
[52:51] It's going to be age to where that
[52:54] become no right, no wrong. It's going to
[52:58] be an age of incredible perversion.
[53:01] It's going to be an age of the even the
[53:03] the church world won't even know where
[53:06] they stand.
[53:08] But I'm going to allow you to be born on
[53:10] a certain day at a certain time.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to watch over your seed all
[53:17] the way through.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And when you're born, I'm going to watch
[53:21] over you
[53:22] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to protect you
[53:25] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to be with you.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; And there's some things that you've got
[53:28] to go through in life, but I'm going to
[53:31] be with you. Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you word that I'm
[53:36] going to sustain you with.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; There will be a season to which that you
[53:42] will feel alienated from the
[53:44] commonwealth of God,
[53:47] but you always will be a seed.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; You always will be a son.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; But there will come a day that you
[53:56] recognize where you came from and where
[53:59] you're going.
[54:03] young man, young woman from that
[54:04] dimension. If he could have that
[54:06] conversation with you, he could talk to
[54:09] you about what you will develop while
[54:11] you're here.
[54:13] It'll be the development of character.
[54:19] By developing your character, you'll be
[54:22] fit to reign.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; You'll be born with complexes.
[54:29] You'll be born with fears.
[54:31] You'll be born with natural anxieties in
[54:34] your life.
[54:36] Your greatest battle will be in your
[54:38] mind.
[54:39] But I'm going to equip you with
[54:41] something.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you my word.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; And this word is not a word that has to
[54:48] evolve. But I'm going to give you my
[54:50] word that will sustain you.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:57] You remember just a few moments ago I
[54:59] wrote to you I told you about Isaiah.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; We could just we could just think about
[55:05] this just for a moment.
[55:07] It comes a time to where the prophet
[55:10] writer comes into fellowship
[55:13] with the author.
[55:16] And as a man,
[55:19] he would like to have perfect fellowship
[55:21] with Jesus Christ
[55:23] and not have to wrestle with his
[55:25] humanity
[55:27] of feeling lost.
[55:30] His humanity of
[55:32] of more than turtle doves and bullock
[55:35] and offering of sacrifice of doves.
[55:41] this humanity of of as becoming an old
[55:44] man and feeling weak.
[55:48] Now God allows him to step into a
[55:51] channel to where that God allows him to
[55:55] begin to speak of a kinsman redeemer.
[56:01] Now he'll scream it out and it'll be
[56:03] read by literally billions on the earth.
[56:07] He is despised
[56:10] and rejected of men.
[56:14] A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief.
[56:20] He'll understand what I'm going through.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; He'll understand my deep scars.
[56:30] He'll understand the depth of my
[56:32] anxieties.
[56:36] You'll be acquainted with my grief.
[56:40] We did. We hid as it were our faces from
[56:43] him. He was despised.
[56:47] We esteemed him not.
[56:50] Surely
[56:53] he hath borne our griefs.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; This is not only prophetic.
[56:59] In one sense, he's to come, but it's
[57:02] prophetic for us to grab a hold of it
[57:04] and say, "He took my pain for me."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; I just pray I can grip this audience
[57:11] tonight. Whatever turmoil that you're
[57:13] going through now that you're wrestling
[57:16] with,
[57:18] young people, God knows what you're
[57:20] going through.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:28] We could talk of the fox's book of
[57:30] martyrs which is beyond belief
[57:35] &gt;&gt; of what people have had to go through
[57:39] &gt;&gt; saw us under
[57:41] &gt;&gt; stoned burn at the state
[57:45] &gt;&gt; murdered for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[57:49] And they could look at this scripture.
[57:53] God paid the price for this.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; In my deepest heartache and agony, I've
[58:00] got a I've got a savior.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; My heart is torn, but I've got a savior
[58:09] that has paid the price for me.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And I can get through this.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; I want to speak this to you. You can get
[58:22] through this.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I feel so alone. You don't
[58:29] know what I heard. I can't share it with
[58:31] nobody else. You can get through this.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I've got some deep darkness in my life.
[58:40] I can't tell a soul, Jesus knows.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows. Brother Ron, I've got loved
[58:50] ones that it seems absolutely
[58:52] impossible. He sent a word to you
[58:55] tonight. He's on the scene and he knows
[58:59] how to come to their case.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7.
[59:19] that the trial of your faith
[59:24] being much more precious
[59:26] than that of gold that perisheth.
[59:31] Though it be tried with fire,
[59:34] might be found into the praise and the
[59:37] honor and the glory of the appearing of
[59:41] Jesus Christ. the trial of your faith.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; It's not the faith of God. It's your
[59:49] faith.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God's got confidence
[59:56] in his seed, brother Matt.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; And things beyond our control.
[1:00:12] I don't know why I picked him, but I
[1:00:14] believe God knows
[1:00:17] things beyond our control.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; God is saying tonight,
[1:00:22] I got this.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; I got this. Amen.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Job,
[1:00:36] he'd be a good testimony for us.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; But he knoweth the way that I take.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And when he hath tried me,
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; when he hath tried me, I shall come
[1:00:51] forth
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; as go.
[1:01:00] Revelation chapter 3,
[1:01:03] which be a theme of your church age
[1:01:04] book. I counsel thee to buy of me. Go
[1:01:09] try it in a fire that thou mayest be
[1:01:12] rich and white raignment that thou
[1:01:15] mayest be clothed and the shame of thy
[1:01:17] nakedness do not appear, and anoint
[1:01:20] thine eyes with eyes, that thou mayest
[1:01:22] see.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen.
[1:01:26] Be zealous, therefore, and repent.
[1:01:31] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:01:34] And if any man hear my voice and open
[1:01:38] the door, I will come into him and will
[1:01:41] s with him and he with me to him that
[1:01:43] overcometh.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said overcome is
[1:01:48] recognize Satan and his trick and
[1:01:51] overcome him.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You're an invincible army. Amen.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; And that's more than a statement.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God's given you a word
[1:02:02] that you can overcome in this day.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; We're more than some rehab center.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; We're more than some sinner where you
[1:02:12] learn to live with your devils.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We're more than some social gospel
[1:02:17] gathering. We have been sent here with a
[1:02:20] message that said she's the final voice
[1:02:23] to the final age. and she will overcome.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I would say this to you. This has been
[1:02:35] my banner. Refuse to give up.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; There is no going back.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I've never had a day where I said I just
[1:02:49] quit.
[1:02:51] If I've got Jesus on my side, I am a
[1:02:53] victor every day of my life. It may not
[1:02:57] look like it. It may not feel like it.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; But I don't care what the devil says,
[1:03:03] Brother Steven. We're more than
[1:03:05] conquerors through him that loved us.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; The song says, "Onward, Christian
[1:03:15] soldiers."
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:20] 1 John chapter 4 and verse4. Is this all
[1:03:23] right? Year of God, little children.
[1:03:27] Listen, I don't have to hear anymore.
[1:03:30] Year of God,
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Tim. God, you're of God.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; John Andy's year of God.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And when God says that,
[1:03:42] I don't even need no negotiations with
[1:03:45] the devil.
[1:03:46] If I came from God, I'm going back to
[1:03:49] God.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; And you become Satan's worst nightmare
[1:03:57] on the earth because that's where you
[1:04:00] came from and that's where you're
[1:04:01] heading.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; You have got little children and have
[1:04:07] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:04:09] is in you than he that is in the world.
[1:04:13] God's greater than every temptation of
[1:04:15] hell.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; He's greater than every pornographic
[1:04:18] demon.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; He's greater than every lustful desire.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; He's greater than every popularity. He's
[1:04:25] greater than every Hollywood demon that
[1:04:27] there is. He's greater than every music
[1:04:29] devil that there is.
[1:04:42] Brother Ron, I just get so far and then
[1:04:44] I fall back and I get so far and I fall
[1:04:46] back and I get so far. You put your
[1:04:48] hands in the hands of the man that steal
[1:04:50] the water.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; You put your trust in Jesus Christ. Are
[1:04:55] you with me now? You lay it at his feet.
[1:04:57] Lay temper at his feet. Lay lust at his
[1:05:00] feet. Lay passion at his feet.
[1:05:04] Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 3:5.
[1:05:14] Not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:05:17] to think anything as of ourselves,
[1:05:20] but our sufficiency
[1:05:24] is of God.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Our sufficiency is of God.
[1:05:34] Paul would say it like this. And he
[1:05:37] saith unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[1:05:40] for thee.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; For my strength is made perfect in
[1:05:45] weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
[1:05:48] rather glory in mine infirmities, that
[1:05:50] the power of Christ may rest upon me."
[1:05:53] Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29. He
[1:05:56] giveth power to the faint,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; and to them that have no might. He
[1:06:01] increasth strength. Even to the youth
[1:06:04] shall he thou shalt faint and be weary,
[1:06:07] and the young men shall utterly fall.
[1:06:09] But they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:06:13] renew their strength. They shall mount
[1:06:15] up on wings as an eagles. They shall run
[1:06:18] and not be weary. They shall walk and
[1:06:22] not faint.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:06:29] Isaiah 54 and verse 16. I'm in the great
[1:06:32] quote book tonight. Behold, I have
[1:06:35] created the smith that bloweth the coals
[1:06:38] in the fire that bringeth forth an
[1:06:40] instrument for his work. I have created
[1:06:43] the waster to destroy.
[1:06:48] This is one of my favorite scripture.
[1:06:52] No weapon.
[1:06:58] No weapon
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; shall prosper.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And every tongue that shall rise against
[1:07:07] thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; This is the heritage of the servants of
[1:07:15] the Lord.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And their righteousness is of me, saith
[1:07:19] the Lord.
[1:07:22] No weapon.
[1:07:25] no weapon.
[1:07:28] I'd like to share with you some of
[1:07:30] Paul's testimony.
[1:07:32] Paul was a man that would spend much of
[1:07:34] his life in in in a dungeon
[1:07:37] for the cause of Jesus Christ,
[1:07:40] not in a beautiful tent or building like
[1:07:42] we have, but most of this the New
[1:07:46] Testament would be written from a
[1:07:48] dungeon guarded by men.
[1:07:52] Brother Brandon would use the term he
[1:07:54] said he would eat with rats, chains on
[1:07:57] him.
[1:07:59] Did that make him want to quit?
[1:08:02] Stupid devil.
[1:08:06] Just stupid devil. Listen to second
[1:08:10] Corinthians chapter 11. We talk about
[1:08:13] hurt.
[1:08:14] Somewhere in your mind's eye, I'd like
[1:08:16] you to just capture some of the hurt
[1:08:18] that's happened in your life. And we're
[1:08:20] going to do something with it in a
[1:08:21] little bit.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Some of the gathering of the hurt and
[1:08:26] the scars in the life.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to do with something with it
[1:08:30] for a little bit. Are you with me now?
[1:08:31] Is this okay?
[1:08:41] I know I spent a little time this
[1:08:43] afternoon just saying, "Satan, get
[1:08:44] ready."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
[1:08:52] Israelites? So am I. Are they seed of
[1:08:56] Abraham? So am I. Are they ministers of
[1:08:58] Christ? I speak as a fool. I am more.
[1:09:01] and labors more abundant and stripes
[1:09:03] above measure
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; in prison more frequent and depth of the
[1:09:08] Jews five times received I 40 stripes
[1:09:11] save one thrice I was beaten with rods
[1:09:14] once I was stoned
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; thrice I suffered shipwreck a night and
[1:09:20] a day in the deep
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; can you imagine believe the sign I'm
[1:09:24] having enjoyment with this
[1:09:39] Ah, your prophet has been beat over and
[1:09:42] over again. Yep.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He's been shipwrecked over and over
[1:09:47] again. Yep.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Your prophet spends most of his time in
[1:09:51] prison. Yep.
[1:09:57] He's been stoned and left for dead. Yep.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; In journeys and often in perils and of
[1:10:05] waters and perils of the robbers and
[1:10:07] perils of my own countrymen, in perils
[1:10:10] by the nation, in perils in the city, in
[1:10:13] perils in the wilderness, in perils in
[1:10:15] the sea, in perils amongst false
[1:10:17] brethren. It's probably the most
[1:10:19] dangerous one. in weariness and
[1:10:21] painfulness, in watching often, and in
[1:10:24] hunger, and in thirst, and fast often,
[1:10:26] in cold, and in naked. Besides all these
[1:10:28] things worth without, and that which
[1:10:31] cometh upon me daily, the care of all
[1:10:33] the church, who is weak?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Who is weak?
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; I am not weak.
[1:10:45] Who is offended? I burn not.
[1:10:49] If I must needs glory, I will glory in
[1:10:51] the things which all concern mine
[1:10:53] infirmities. The God and Father of our
[1:10:56] Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed
[1:10:59] forever more, knoweth that I lie not.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Can I paraphrase here for a moment? I
[1:11:08] refuse to allow these hurts
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; to destroy my music.
[1:11:20] I refuse to allow these things to
[1:11:23] destroy me.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Forgive me if I get a little bit
[1:11:32] excited.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Romans 8.
[1:11:39] And we know that all things
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; all things
[1:11:47] There's nothing that has exclusivity to
[1:11:50] it.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; All things. Brother David.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; This service. Let's just destroy the
[1:12:06] enemy.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're taking your time. I
[1:12:14] want you to get it.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:18] Brother Ron, nobody knows what I go
[1:12:20] through. Listen, let me just say, get
[1:12:22] out of your personal pity party.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Climb up out of your personal pity
[1:12:29] party.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Dust your clothes off.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's dust our clothes off for
[1:12:36] a little bit. We were sent here to
[1:12:38] conquer this day. Let's dust our clothes
[1:12:39] off a little bit.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to fight.
[1:12:46] This is a day that the Lord has made.
[1:12:49] This is my day. This is my battle.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Every one of you's got different battles
[1:12:58] in this building. But you've been built
[1:13:00] to overcome. You've been given the armor
[1:13:02] to overcome your battle. Not somebody
[1:13:05] else's battle or this is what I would
[1:13:07] do. You overcome. Speak to your
[1:13:11] mountain.
[1:13:15] Woo! It feels good up here.
[1:13:31] We know that all things
[1:13:33] work together for the good
[1:13:36] to them that love God,
[1:13:39] to them who are they called according to
[1:13:42] his purpose.
[1:13:46] For whom he did forno,
[1:13:48] he also did predestinate
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; to be conformed to the image of his son,
[1:13:54] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:13:56] many brethren.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[1:14:01] he also called.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And whom he called them, he also
[1:14:04] justified.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; And justification is though you never
[1:14:07] did it in the first place.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; So God that had you in your hand here
[1:14:13] knows he's going to have you in your
[1:14:14] hand there.
[1:14:18] and whom he justified them he also
[1:14:20] glorified.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; What shall we then say to these things?
[1:14:24] If God be for us,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; if God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Let's just ask a question. Who?
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Who? Brother Random stood there that day
[1:14:42] when they were contesting him on the
[1:14:44] Godhead.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And they were warned by another brother,
[1:14:49] be careful.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; There's an angel of God with them. None
[1:14:52] of them would step up.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I find it interesting that many devils
[1:14:58] stepped up after he was gone a long time
[1:15:00] ago.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; But now they want to take you on.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Welcome to our world.
[1:15:10] Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Who can be against us?
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Who can be against us?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He that spared not his own son, but
[1:15:27] delivered him up for us all. How shall
[1:15:30] he not with him freely also freely give
[1:15:34] us all things?
[1:15:37] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:15:39] God's elect?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; It is God that justifith.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[1:15:45] that died, yay, rather, that is risen
[1:15:47] again, who is even at the right hand of
[1:15:49] God, who also make us intercession for
[1:15:51] us. Who shall separate us from the love
[1:15:54] of Christ? Shall tribulation,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; distress, persecution, or famine, or
[1:16:01] nakedness, or peril, or sword. For as it
[1:16:04] is written, for thy sake we're killed
[1:16:06] all the day long, and we're accounted as
[1:16:08] sheep for the slaughter. Nailed all
[1:16:10] these things,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; we're more than conquerors through him
[1:16:16] that loved us.
[1:16:21] For I am persuaded that neither death,
[1:16:24] nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:16:26] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:16:29] present, nor things to come, nor height,
[1:16:32] nor death, nor any other creature shall
[1:16:36] be able to separate us
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; from the love of God, which is in Christ
[1:16:43] Jesus,
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; our Lord.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:54] I'd like to remind the devil he's in for
[1:16:56] a really bad night.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 4 and verse one.
[1:17:10] I charge thee before God, and the Lord
[1:17:14] Jesus Christ, who shall judge the
[1:17:17] quicken the dead at the appearing of his
[1:17:19] kingdom.
[1:17:20] Preach the word, be instant in season,
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; out of season,
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all
[1:17:26] longsuffering and doctrine. For the time
[1:17:29] will come when they will not endure
[1:17:30] sound doctrine, but rather their own
[1:17:32] lust shall heap to themselves teachers
[1:17:35] having itching ears. For they shall turn
[1:17:37] away their ears from the truth, and they
[1:17:39] shall be turned into fables. But watch
[1:17:41] thou in all things. Endure afflictions.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Don't quit.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Don't turn away and run.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Do the work of an evangelist. Make full
[1:17:52] proof of thy ministry. For I am now
[1:17:54] ready to be offered, for the time of my
[1:17:56] departure is at hand. I have fought a
[1:17:59] good fight.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; What can you do with a seed of God?
[1:18:05] I have fought a good fight. I have
[1:18:08] finished my course. I have kept the
[1:18:10] faith. Henceforth is laid up for me a
[1:18:13] crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
[1:18:16] the righteous judge,
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; shall give me at that day, and not to me
[1:18:21] only,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; but unto all of them,
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; sir. All of them
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; that love his appearing.
[1:18:44] Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13.
[1:18:47] Brother Murphy, you're still alive.
[1:18:51] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[1:18:53] apprehended,
[1:18:55] but this one thing that I do, forgetting
[1:18:59] those things which are behind.
[1:19:04] Can I say it to you? Forgetting those
[1:19:06] things which are behind.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things which are
[1:19:11] behind.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; What happened to you yesterday?
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Put in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:17] walk on.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; What they said to you yesterday, walk
[1:19:21] on.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; How they hurt you years ago. Walk on.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; The scars that have been in your life
[1:19:29] and you're still standing. Walk on.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'd like to see a great
[1:19:46] miracle. You are.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; A great miracle.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; You are
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; a great miracle.
[1:20:01] You are a great miracle.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You're still standing.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Satan has put every challenge that he
[1:20:14] could against you.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; He's bent all of hell against you.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; You're living in Satan's Eden and he's
[1:20:22] did everything. He's placed every media,
[1:20:24] every outlet against your mind
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; and you're still standing.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is a tremendous victory when
[1:20:39] you walk into church and you sat down
[1:20:41] with your Bible in your hands and you're
[1:20:43] sitting there
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and Satan's done everything that he can
[1:20:47] to discourage you and to stop you and to
[1:20:50] pull you away from your position and
[1:20:53] you're still standing at your post of
[1:20:56] duty.
[1:21:00] Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, you don't know. Well,
[1:21:14] maybe over the next few minutes I can
[1:21:16] help you with some things.
[1:21:20] There was a girl that laid in a
[1:21:22] condition
[1:21:24] and her mother and father were not
[1:21:26] believers,
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; but she got a hold of a book.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And she began to believe that all things
[1:21:36] are possible.
[1:21:38] And though she was surrounded by
[1:21:40] unbelief,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; somehow she be to pray to a faithful
[1:21:45] high priest
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; that could touch the helm of a garment.
[1:21:49] And beyond her little feeble body that
[1:21:52] couldn't get herself out of the bed, she
[1:21:55] be to believe in a vision of the word of
[1:21:58] God that she didn't have to live in that
[1:22:00] prison of a body forever.
[1:22:06] She be to believe, God, you can send me
[1:22:09] your prophet. You can come on the scene.
[1:22:11] You can minister to my body. You can
[1:22:14] raise me up out of this bed.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Georgia Carter lived that testimony.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, she did.
[1:22:35] a lady born blind
[1:22:39] and would be a pulper
[1:22:42] all of her life.
[1:22:46] But yet there was such a relationship
[1:22:48] with God on the inside of her. She
[1:22:50] didn't need to see the sun come up in
[1:22:52] the morning.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; She didn't need to see the stars to know
[1:22:55] that there was a God.
[1:22:58] She could reach into another realm and
[1:23:01] the anointing of God would sweep down
[1:23:04] over her and somehow she would begin to
[1:23:07] write songs.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; She would begin to write songs. She
[1:23:13] didn't have money. She didn't have a
[1:23:15] great family. She didn't have a
[1:23:16] beautiful home. But the hurt didn't
[1:23:20] destroy the music.
[1:23:24] Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Her blind eyes didn't destroy the music
[1:23:34] that was coming out of her.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Savior,
[1:23:40] Savior,
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; pass me not, oh gentle Savior,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; hear my humble cry.
[1:23:51] How many, maybe even to the millions,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; have walked to the altar,
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; stepped out of a pew,
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; behind a chair,
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; been invited,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; laid down sins that was more than them
[1:24:06] and slavery more than them, and walk to
[1:24:10] an altar because someone was inspired
[1:24:13] from the depths of blindness.
[1:24:16] Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; She was inspired from the depths of
[1:24:20] blindness
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; and it forced her
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; into a deep relationship with Christ.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Stupid devil.
[1:24:41] Stupid devil.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; He's ignorant. just have to say, "Let me
[1:24:45] just place it how it is." He's ignorant.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; God knows what he deposited.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; And he permits pressure.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; To make goal.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; He certainly does.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm coming to your
[1:25:05] house in a minute.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You didn't need to pity Fanny Crosby.
[1:25:18] There was there was thousands of people
[1:25:20] walking by her that didn't have eternal
[1:25:23] life.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; But what the darkness of poverty and the
[1:25:29] darkness of blindness did to her, it
[1:25:31] forced her into a relationship
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; of such depth
[1:25:37] that all of her critics were hush.
[1:25:42] How will you know him?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; How will you know him?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; You're blind. How will you know him?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And she turns under inspiration. And in
[1:25:52] that very moment, that criticism caused
[1:25:54] her to write a song. I shall know him. I
[1:25:58] shall know him. I shall know him by the
[1:26:01] nail prints.
[1:26:06] Hallelujah.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; John Wesley,
[1:26:22] his mother,
[1:26:24] it's recorded in one place that their
[1:26:27] home was burned out five times.
[1:26:30] They lost five homes to fire.
[1:26:33] husband wasn't in and out of the home,
[1:26:37] but his mother had a desire to see a
[1:26:39] revival
[1:26:42] and she was called the mother of
[1:26:44] Methodists.
[1:26:46] They will label that later the mother of
[1:26:48] Methodist, but she was crying for
[1:26:51] revival.
[1:26:53] Pressures forced her to where she was.
[1:26:58] She wanted life.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And she refused the status quo.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; She had to have more.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; One of her sons would be Charles Wesley
[1:27:09] and he would be one of the greatest
[1:27:11] songwriters of all time. But the other
[1:27:14] one would be a messenger
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; to the agemen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Great big man. 5'1.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great.
[1:27:26] redheaded.
[1:27:30] Hallelujah.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; He would marry a woman somewhere through
[1:27:35] the changes of life. She would lose her
[1:27:37] mind and she would be mentally
[1:27:41] very afflicted
[1:27:43] and tormented.
[1:27:46] Talking about pressure,
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; You're a messenger.
[1:27:50] We read about Paul in the dungeon. We
[1:27:53] read about Fanny Crosby. But here's a
[1:27:56] messenger.
[1:27:57] A messenger to a generation.
[1:28:01] A messenger of reformation. A messenger
[1:28:04] preaching with passion with everything
[1:28:07] that was within him. And he stowed up
[1:28:09] out of every every church. And his home
[1:28:12] seems unstable.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And he preached. and he rode on the back
[1:28:22] of a horse and he spoke 88,000
[1:28:27] sermons
[1:28:32] in his life.
[1:28:41] He was stoned
[1:28:44] five times.
[1:28:48] You can read it in his diary.
[1:28:53] Today I was stoned
[1:28:55] and they thought I was dead.
[1:28:59] But I came to myself and I shook the
[1:29:02] rocks off of me.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And I will begin to preach again
[1:29:07] tomorrow.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Don't come to me with your pity party.
[1:29:14] Somebody didn't shake your hand. Amen.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Don't come to me with, you know, my
[1:29:22] personal feelings got hurt last week and
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; my name didn't get called in the
[1:29:26] service.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; I want to just rehearse it again to you
[1:29:29] today. I was stoned and left for dead.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; And after my perpetrators were gone, I
[1:29:34] shook myself and got out of the rocks.
[1:29:36] And I'm determined to preach again
[1:29:38] tomorrow.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; To God be the glory.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:46] To God be the glory.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Our messenger was under every pressure
[1:30:04] from hell.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Witch doctors trying to destroy his
[1:30:08] meetings. Preacher sitting on the
[1:30:11] platform trying to destroy his meeting.
[1:30:13] His physical body had had situations in
[1:30:17] it that every few years would go through
[1:30:19] another cycle and would try to destroy
[1:30:21] itself over and over again. But he knew
[1:30:23] where he stood. He knew where he was
[1:30:25] commissioned.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He had lost his wife.
[1:30:31] It's almost beyond measure when I I've
[1:30:34] heard it over and over and hundreds of
[1:30:36] times. Life story.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; And every time I hear life story, I'm
[1:30:41] consumed.
[1:30:44] with what went on.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; I'm consumed with the trial that he went
[1:30:52] through.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; But the extreme hurt,
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; the extreme pressure,
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; did not destroy the music.
[1:31:13] when he steps to the pullpit and speaks
[1:31:16] sermons like future home.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; It's like John standing and writing
[1:31:26] Revelations 21.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; God's messenger looking into another
[1:31:32] realm and telling you what it's going to
[1:31:34] be like and what kind of people that
[1:31:36] you'll be. He walks to the pull pit and
[1:31:38] speaks choosing of a bride and he's
[1:31:41] looking for you and he's looking at you
[1:31:43] knowing that you're coming
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; knowing that he's dressing a bride for
[1:31:48] Jesus Christ knowing that regardless of
[1:31:51] the hurts that you go through and the
[1:31:54] critics that you will have to walk
[1:31:55] through and the thermal that you will go
[1:31:57] through that the dress will fit exactly
[1:32:01] right.
[1:32:06] Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; oh, glory.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; When he speaks sermons like things that
[1:32:22] are to be,
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; it's more than just some pretty message,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; but it's prophetic.
[1:32:33] It's prophetic and it's for you
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; and you grab a hold of it
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; and you hang on to it with everything
[1:32:40] that's within it
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; when he stands to the pull pit and under
[1:32:50] great pressure in one meeting. He's now
[1:32:53] forced
[1:32:55] into a sermon
[1:32:59] and he speaks on the wings of a snow
[1:33:02] white dove.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; And he tells how bird goes out, there's
[1:33:09] been a war,
[1:33:11] how that bird gets shot, explaining his
[1:33:13] own life.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; But toward the end, he says the message
[1:33:18] got through.
[1:33:30] Oh, how he must have felt, Brother Ed.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; And he stood there night after night
[1:33:36] after night throughout all of the years
[1:33:38] and decades now.
[1:33:40] And God allows him to say, "And the
[1:33:44] message got through.
[1:33:51] It's going to accomplish what it set out
[1:33:53] to do.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Let every devil in hell rage. Let the
[1:33:59] heathen rage and say vain things. The
[1:34:03] message got through.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:21] One more round.
[1:34:35] Men of God grabbed this message with all
[1:34:38] their hearts.
[1:34:42] They sit in pullpits all over the world
[1:34:46] studies.
[1:34:48] They treasure this message with all of
[1:34:50] their hearts.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, you could poke
[1:34:56] you could poke faults at them and look
[1:34:59] at their humanity
[1:35:02] and they even struggle with their own
[1:35:04] humanity.
[1:35:07] Every man of God struggles with his own
[1:35:09] humanity
[1:35:12] and he realizes
[1:35:15] that the greatest gift that any of us
[1:35:17] has is to get herself out of the way.
[1:35:22] But you eat the book and you eat the
[1:35:24] book and you eat the book and you eat
[1:35:25] the book.
[1:35:27] Then there will be certain occasions
[1:35:29] that you're given the opportunity to
[1:35:30] speak.
[1:35:33] Now, God has allowed you to build
[1:35:34] character in your life. And he's sent
[1:35:36] you trial after trial after trial. You
[1:35:38] see, God is the potter and we're the
[1:35:41] clay.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; And he knows exactly where to squeeze us
[1:35:44] and word to put pressure on us because
[1:35:47] he wants the bell to sound a certain
[1:35:49] way,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; a trumpet to sound a certain way, and
[1:35:53] he's got a certain music for us to.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; But even though our hurt,
[1:36:05] Even though our incredible frustrations
[1:36:08] of life
[1:36:12] through all of our hurt,
[1:36:14] the music comes through.
[1:36:41] Brother Brandon used a man named
[1:36:43] Beethoven.
[1:36:46] And Beethoven was known as one of the
[1:36:48] greatest composers that there would ever
[1:36:49] be.
[1:36:56] But Beethoven's
[1:36:58] gift would be perfected.
[1:37:01] It would be forced to be perfected.
[1:37:05] by becoming deaf.
[1:37:14] Sometimes we wonder why these things.
[1:37:18] We're forced into channels to be
[1:37:21] perfected.
[1:37:25] Now, I'm going to cut a lot of heads
[1:37:27] off.
[1:37:32] He's forced into isolation
[1:37:37] now. He can't enjoy the orchestra,
[1:37:41] but he'll put his ear against the floor
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; and cut the piano off
[1:37:49] and play by the rhythm
[1:37:51] on the floor.
[1:37:54] And he from that stage of life will
[1:37:58] create the greatest music
[1:38:01] known to man.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Why did Isaac have to go blind and
[1:38:11] stagger in the darkness?
[1:38:14] He would have never allowed Jacob
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; to get the birthight.
[1:38:25] Why did David fall to a horrible sin?
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; God had to produce grace
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; and show grace.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Character after character in the
[1:38:43] scripture, but I'd like to go character
[1:38:45] after character after character setting
[1:38:47] this tent tonight.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes. Amen.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, God God has allowed certain
[1:38:55] things in your life
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; to force you to be the man that you are.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Are they easy?
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; I'd say absolutely not.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Did it hurt the music?
[1:39:21] No,
[1:39:23] it actually made it better.
[1:39:33] Brother Tom,
[1:39:35] you shared with me your life story.
[1:39:42] We wept
[1:39:44] together. We've cried together.
[1:39:50] We spent a lot of time together.
[1:40:01] You watched him be developed.
[1:40:06] You watched him, right?
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; You watched him be developed.
[1:40:19] Did it hurt the music? I'd say not.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we listen to a sermon
[1:40:31] and we watch a man tell us, "I'm trying
[1:40:33] to slow down." You know good and well he
[1:40:35] can't.
[1:40:39] And he's delivering message with passion
[1:40:42] like never before.
[1:40:46] You just don't know. Sometimes you don't
[1:40:49] value or appreciate
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; the work that has went on
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; to make him
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; the gift that he is.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I haven't asked these men's
[1:41:05] haven't asked them permission. I'm just
[1:41:08] venturing without authority.
[1:41:13] I'm going to come down here so lightning
[1:41:16] don't strike me.
[1:41:29] It seemed like a few years ago that the
[1:41:32] whole world turned on your pastor.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Did it shake him?
[1:41:44] Did he quit?
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you,
[1:41:55] right in the midst of all that pressure,
[1:41:58] he just delivered his greatest messages.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; That's what pressure does to you.
[1:42:10] And you heard Rahab
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; and you heard Kmart.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; You heard the administration of the son
[1:42:21] of man.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You think those thoughts some man
[1:42:25] thought up?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; God got a vessel to a spot. I can speak
[1:42:30] through him.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:42:36] and you went through some of those spots
[1:42:39] with him
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; and you were shaken to your core.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Did it cause you to quit? I'd say
[1:42:48] absolutely no.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; It only made you stronger.
[1:43:16] Brother Jumbo,
[1:43:19] you're a friend of me and I hope you're
[1:43:21] a friend of mine after tonight.
[1:43:27] You have a brother-in-law
[1:43:29] who's one of my best friends of life and
[1:43:32] his name is Tim Puit. Brother Tim, if
[1:43:35] you're on right now, just cut it off for
[1:43:37] just about 10 minutes.
[1:43:49] You were his brother-in-law.
[1:43:52] And I'm sure you had a good
[1:43:53] relationship.
[1:43:59] When I first met you,
[1:44:02] it seemed like you didn't you had went
[1:44:04] through a horrible and I'm not going to
[1:44:05] say a lot of things here. You had went
[1:44:07] through a horrible situation. Your first
[1:44:10] wife had passed
[1:44:14] and you were very, very distant. Very
[1:44:18] distant.
[1:44:21] Now to be the man that he is,
[1:44:25] God allowed God allowed, Brother Bam
[1:44:28] uses the term God permits
[1:44:31] him to have a disease in his life that
[1:44:34] would him.
[1:44:38] That didn't make him quit.
[1:44:41] At 15 years old, he began to pastor a
[1:44:43] church.
[1:44:47] If you've ever met a a man that's a lion
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; from a little bitty body
[1:44:57] that stands about as high as I stand.
[1:45:01] He stands with determination.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; He stands with ferveny in his voice
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; through all the hurts of his body.
[1:45:15] through all the DNA that had that had
[1:45:18] bound him.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; He's preached masterpiece after
[1:45:24] masterpiece after masterpiece through
[1:45:26] his life.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; I would say tonight, brother Kim, the
[1:45:31] hurt
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; did not destroy the music.
[1:45:52] Sister Melody and Brother Calvin,
[1:45:57] this building doesn't understand the
[1:46:00] incredible pain that you've went through
[1:46:02] in your life.
[1:46:09] But the hurt
[1:46:11] didn't destroy the music.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes when you shake
[1:46:18] somebody's hand,
[1:46:22] you don't know what they're going
[1:46:24] through.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You literally do not know what they're
[1:46:28] going through.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; You don't know.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; You just don't know.
[1:46:41] There was a day you really didn't like
[1:46:43] me,
[1:46:48] but today it's not that way.
[1:46:53] Where's your brother?
[1:46:56] I don't think there's ever been a day
[1:46:57] you didn't like me.
[1:47:08] the hurt.
[1:47:16] You were told everything against this
[1:47:18] message,
[1:47:21] but the hurt
[1:47:24] didn't destroy your music.
[1:47:34] We could go all over this building
[1:47:37] tonight.
[1:47:39] What about your book, Sister Anne?
[1:47:43] It's got some difficult chapters in it.
[1:47:54] The hurt will not destroy the music.
[1:48:04] Can I use one last?
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I haven't found Ella yet. I've been
[1:48:10] looking. Where's Ella? Ella.
[1:48:18] There's no accidents with God.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; There's no accidents with God.
[1:48:34] There's absolutely no accidents.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Ella, you've cried a lot at night
[1:48:44] and there's been days of great darkness
[1:48:49] and no doubt Satan's whispered a lot of
[1:48:51] times in your ears.
[1:48:54] Where's her parents? Where's her parents
[1:48:56] now? her parents in the building.
[1:49:00] They know what the pain that she's went
[1:49:02] through.
[1:49:09] But I've never never met a lady with
[1:49:11] more character
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; than Ella.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I say that by the grace of God.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:28] The hurt
[1:49:30] didn't destroy
[1:49:34] music.
[1:49:45] I've tried to lead myself out of this
[1:49:46] tonight, but for you that know me,
[1:49:54] know that there's been a faith walk.
[1:49:58] Faith to get out of a wheelchair.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Faith to preach again.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Faith to be able to get up out of the
[1:50:06] bed.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Faith to move forward.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look around the building,
[1:50:15] we go, "Where's God?" I'll tell you, in
[1:50:17] every seat, God's here.
[1:50:40] in your mind. Just make a list
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; of all the hurts.
[1:50:47] Just make a list
[1:50:50] of all the hurts that's detained you and
[1:50:53] hurt you. All your pity parties,
[1:50:57] all your I'm sorry for me stations,
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; all the stages of trying to destroy your
[1:51:04] life. Put it on the altar and just start
[1:51:08] tearing it up tonight.
[1:51:20] This night I lay it at your feet.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; This night I commit it to you and thank
[1:51:27] you
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; for putting me under the pressure
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; that go would come out of it.
[1:51:39] Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:51:52] Grace,
[1:51:54] how sweet.
[1:52:31] I was blind.
[1:52:43] through men
[1:52:46] needed.
[1:52:57] I have
[1:53:01] already
[1:53:18] save
[1:53:20] the song
[1:53:24] and Gra
[1:53:28] will be
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; I want to deal with you just now.
[1:53:49] I want to talk to you.
[1:53:52] I want to talk to you.
[1:53:59] You don't have to write me a blog. You
[1:54:01] don't have to write me a text.
[1:54:04] I want just now.
[1:54:07] You know what you've been battling in
[1:54:09] your mind.
[1:54:11] And you know what you've been battling
[1:54:13] in your life.
[1:54:15] I want you right now to bring it to a
[1:54:16] consummation. Say, "I'm done with this
[1:54:19] devil.
[1:54:24] I'm done with this devil that's
[1:54:26] tormenting me.
[1:54:28] I'm tired of fighting it on my own.
[1:54:33] And I want to lay it at Jesus's feet
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:54:42] Would there be anybody in this building
[1:54:46] that would be willing to be vulnerable
[1:54:48] enough to say
[1:54:51] I want to lay it at Jesus's feet just
[1:54:54] now
[1:55:02] yes
[1:55:07] Yes.
[1:55:10] Yes.
[1:55:13] Yes.
[1:55:16] You were a team today.
[1:55:18] An absolute team today.
[1:55:22] Forced not to compete against each
[1:55:23] other, but to help each other.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; We need one another.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; We need to realize we're not
[1:55:31] isolationist. We need one another.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; We crawled through mud. We crawled over
[1:55:37] fences. We crawled up ropes. We crawled.
[1:55:40] We We're dashed in the water.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; We've been forced in our face issues
[1:55:46] tonight.
[1:55:48] God wants to deal with our lives
[1:55:50] personally.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; And I want to deal not just with young
[1:55:54] people now. I want to deal with you
[1:55:57] all over this building.
[1:56:00] There is a deliverer in the building.
[1:56:05] There is a deliverer in the building.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; The prison doors can come open tonight.
[1:56:12] Oh, but I'm a Christian. But you don't
[1:56:14] have to carry those chains.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You don't have to carry those anxieties.
[1:56:20] Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; I I would like for you to follow your
[1:56:28] hand up and I'd like for you to step out
[1:56:31] of your seat tonight and stand and be
[1:56:34] identified as an overcomer. I'd like for
[1:56:36] you to step up here around this this
[1:56:38] this stage.
[1:57:08] Oh, glory to God.
[1:57:10] Oh, glory to God.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:57:20] We have found the bullseye.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer afraid of him.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer ashamed.
[1:57:37] I stand here tonight and make a
[1:57:40] declaration.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; I'm free.
[1:57:45] And I accept my freedom tonight.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; I sound the Jubilee trumpet tonight. I'm
[1:57:52] free.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Young man to a young man, I want you to
[1:58:00] lay your hands over on one another now.
[1:58:02] Young lady to a young lady,
[1:58:06] we're together in this battle.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; We're together in this battle.
[1:58:13] Your tongue has the power of life and
[1:58:16] death inside of it.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Your tongue
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; the power
[1:58:21] to speak life to bring speak freedom.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; You see, God dealt with me to speak this
[1:58:36] sermon to you.
[1:58:38] And if God sends us a word, then he's
[1:58:41] got an action that's going to happen
[1:58:43] behind it. God amens his own word.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; God echoes his thoughts.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And those thoughts are eternal. And he
[1:58:51] would have a service such as this
[1:58:53] because of your condition. And we have a
[1:58:55] high priest that knows where you're at.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at. And there's
[1:59:00] not a condition too great. There's not a
[1:59:03] situation that's impossible.
[1:59:19] He's here.
[1:59:21] We don't have to ask him to come. He's
[1:59:23] here.
[1:59:26] There will come tremendous testimonies
[1:59:28] from this service tonight.
[1:59:31] There will come phenomenal testimonies
[1:59:33] from this service tonight. The angel of
[1:59:36] the Lord has passed by your way.
[1:59:39] He's come to your house.
[1:59:42] He came to Georgia Carter's house. He's
[1:59:45] came to your house tonight. He knows
[1:59:47] your needs tonight.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus
[1:59:56] Christ,
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; we lift your name on high.
[2:00:04] Father,
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; your name is above every name.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; You're the mighty conqueror tonight.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; You're the mighty angel that is among
[2:00:16] us.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You've come to confirm your covenant
[2:00:21] this afternoon
[2:00:23] to make a declaration in this building
[2:00:26] amongst your bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:30] Let freedom ring.
[2:00:33] We've raised flags this week,
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; but we raise another flag tonight. An
[2:00:38] unsung son. Calvary paid the price of
[2:00:42] redemption for us.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; And it declared that we're free
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; and we're no longer a slave to sin.
[2:00:51] We don't have to be a slave to habits.
[2:00:54] We don't have to be a slave to
[2:00:55] anxieties.
[2:01:02] We speak to circumstances and situations
[2:01:04] tonight.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Turmoils of life,
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; give way in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; give way in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:19] tonight.
[2:01:22] Lord, all of our pressures that have
[2:01:24] been placed upon us,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; you've sent us a word that'll give us
[2:01:31] victory.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; It'll give us overcoming power in the
[2:01:35] name of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; We accept it right now.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; We accept it right now.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Come to our house. Come to our spot
[2:01:49] right now.
[2:01:51] Oh rock of angels.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Oh rock of rages for me.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Consume us dear God.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Consume us with your presence. Dear God,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; consume our lives.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; We give it all to you now.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; We give it all to you, Father.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Consume us.
[2:02:22] touch my brothers, my sisters. Now
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; we worship you.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves to you.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; You hold tomorrow. You hold next week.
[2:02:34] You hold our futures in our hands,
[2:02:36] Father.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:48] Oh hallelujah.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We give it to you now.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; We lay it at your feet now.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:07] God.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; We give it to you now.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Give it to you now in the name of Jesus
[2:03:24] Christ.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Won't you just let him do the work now?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Just give it to him now. I commit it to
[2:03:33] you tonight. Father, there's no need to
[2:03:36] me carrying this another day forward. I
[2:03:39] give it to you. I give you my pain. I
[2:03:41] give you my sorrow. I commit it to you
[2:03:44] now.
[2:04:14] Just worship the Lord now.
[2:04:20] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:04:32] break.

[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Just commit it to him. Wherever you're
[2:04:51] standing now, just commit it to him. Let
[2:04:53] him pass by your way now.
[2:04:58] Let me pass by you.
[2:05:18] Pass by your light.
[2:05:35] I break your chain.
[2:05:38] your favorite.
[2:06:07] Heat. Heat.
[2:06:34] on your mind.
[2:06:38] Every
[2:06:45] chance
[2:06:47] every
[2:06:49] Heat.
[2:06:56] Heat.
[2:07:11] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:21] Another
[2:07:29] heat.
[2:07:40] Heat. Heat.
[2:07:50] Heat. Heat.
[2:08:08] Heat. Heat.
[2:08:18] Heat.
[2:08:24] Heat.
[2:08:35] You are able
[2:08:41] to reach
[2:08:47] my
[2:09:01] heart.
[2:09:03] Oh
[2:09:07] yeah.

[2:11:07] Because

[2:11:16] me
[2:11:22] and
[2:11:26] just make love to him, saints. Now just
[2:11:30] open your heart and lift up your voice.
[2:11:33] Tell him how much you love him for the
[2:11:34] work that he's doing within your heart.
[2:11:39] All
[2:11:41] can
[2:11:44] brea
[2:11:52] Lord. I
[2:11:55] love you.
[2:12:01] I I
[2:12:04] love you
[2:12:09] because
[2:12:12] you
[2:12:16] love
[2:12:18] me
[2:12:25] and
[2:12:29] is my
[2:12:32] sal
[2:12:49] tree.
[2:12:54] Maybe you just want to speak to him.
[2:12:57] Take this little time now just to tell
[2:12:59] him
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; he's near and he's present.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; You have asked when the enemy comes and
[2:13:13] now it's your time to give him thanks.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; It's not just asking,
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; but now it's receiving
[2:13:23] and it's thanking him.
[2:13:26] Why don't you just thank him now?
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just thank him for
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; what he's done in your life at this
[2:13:34] moment?
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just lift up your hearts
[2:13:37] and just say, "Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're a a faithful God.
[2:13:45] You're a loving God.
[2:13:48] You're mindful of my need. And you sent
[2:13:51] a man of God to speak.
[2:13:54] And I don't want it to go unsaid, Lord.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; But I want to give you thanks. I want to
[2:14:00] give you praise. I want to worship you.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; I want to thank you.
[2:14:07] I want to rejoice in my deliverance. I
[2:14:10] want to rejoice in the word of God
[2:14:13] that's been spoken.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; We're always asking, but now I just want
[2:14:18] to rejoice.
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; Not not not with closed mouth. I I want
[2:14:23] to open my mouth. I want to say thank
[2:14:26] you Lord Jesus.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you for my brethren. Thank you for
[2:14:32] here my sister, my mother. Want to thank
[2:14:36] you Jesus.
[2:14:38] People aren't grateful enough these
[2:14:39] days. They want to don't want to thank
[2:14:42] anybody. But I tell you one thing, I
[2:14:44] want to thank the Lord Jesus tonight. I
[2:14:47] want to thank him for what he's doing
[2:14:49] amongst you.
[2:14:54] I want to bless his holy name.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; how can we say thanks
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; for the things you have done for us?
[2:15:15] How can we say thanks, Lord,
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; for what you're doing in the
[2:15:20] supernatural realm?
[2:15:24] Satan's kingdom has suffered great
[2:15:26] defeat.
[2:15:28] Kingdom of God has come down amongst his
[2:15:31] redeemed.
[2:15:34] Victory is taking place in the hearts of
[2:15:37] your children.
[2:15:40] And Lord, we don't want to be dilatory.
[2:15:42] We want to be able to express from the
[2:15:45] depths of our soul to God be the glory.
[2:15:49] Great things he has done.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; We want to praise your name. We want to
[2:15:54] lift up that name.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Truly, Lord Jesus, we're thankful
[2:16:05] people.
[2:16:08] service. Now after the service and now
[2:16:11] another service,
[2:16:14] surely the sons and daughters of God can
[2:16:17] express Lord within their heart, I am
[2:16:20] free.
[2:16:21] I am free.
[2:16:24] Whom the sun sets free is free indeed.
[2:16:26] I'm free. I am free to worship the true
[2:16:30] and living God. I'm free to open up my
[2:16:33] lips and to give you all the glory. I am
[2:16:36] free to lift up my hands to praise your
[2:16:38] holy name. The dead will never praise
[2:16:42] you. The dead won't rejoice in this. But
[2:16:45] Lord, we are the church of the living
[2:16:47] God. And we will bless your holy name.
[2:16:50] And we will give you all the glory. It's
[2:16:53] not the workings of man. It's not the
[2:16:55] instrumentality of a man. It's God
[2:16:58] himself coming down speaking and dealing
[2:17:03] with our lives.
[2:17:08] So, Father God, from the front to the
[2:17:11] back of this little tent,
[2:17:14] we want to express our thanksgiving to
[2:17:17] you for your faithfulness.
[2:17:22] The music is not
[2:17:25] going to be heard.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Still going to go on.
[2:17:32] Lord, may our lives be a melody in the
[2:17:35] presence of Almighty God.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for the word of God that
[2:17:42] we've heard this evening.
[2:17:46] We're thankful, Father.
[2:17:50] Amazing Grace will always be my song of
[2:17:53] praise, Brother Ryan. Amazing
[2:17:59] grace
[2:18:02] shall
[2:18:05] be my song of praise.
[2:18:12] For it was praise
[2:18:17] that
[2:18:19] my mercy.
[2:18:23] This is the grace of God.
[2:18:26] I do not know
[2:18:32] just why he came to love me so
[2:18:40] think of it now.
[2:18:45] Oh, I just want to praise my heart and
[2:18:49] all my need.
[2:18:56] I shall forever
[2:19:02] lift my eyes to
[2:19:11] you.
[2:19:16] where Jesus died
[2:19:20] for me.
[2:19:26] Oh my
[2:19:41] he
[2:19:56] Amazing
[2:19:57] grace
[2:20:00] that save me from
[2:20:07] shame. That's what this is about. Draw
[2:20:11] me close
[2:20:15] and keep me by
[2:20:19] his side
[2:20:24] forever. I'll sing
[2:20:31] how glory
[2:20:33] to
[2:20:34] his name
[2:20:39] for him.
[2:20:43] Oh, bless his name. Bless his holy name.
[2:20:46] Bless his name.
[2:20:48] Hallelu.
[2:20:52] I shall forever
[2:20:59] my eyes to
[2:21:07] you. The cross
[2:21:12] where Jesus
[2:21:29] My heart
[2:21:37] be
[2:21:42] I shall forever. I shall forever. One
[2:21:46] more time.
[2:21:48] Oh, I shall forever.
[2:22:09] Where Jesus?
[2:22:24] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:22:34] Oh
[2:22:37] my go
[2:22:41] my need.
[2:22:47] Hallelujah.
[2:22:54] Hallelujah.
[2:22:59] Hallelujah.
[2:23:01] Look what the Holy Spirit is doing,
[2:23:03] young people. Look what he's doing.
[2:23:07] God's doing wonderful things. He's doing
[2:23:09] a miraculous thing.
[2:23:12] And I I really don't understand
[2:23:14] sometimes how we just can't lift up our
[2:23:17] hearts and voices today.
[2:23:21] And I I I see the Holy Spirit just doing
[2:23:24] marvelous things.
[2:23:26] And may you continue in this. May God
[2:23:29] continue to start breathing continually
[2:23:33] in your lives that you can say, "I
[2:23:35] marked the spot one more time.
[2:23:38] God's called us to this great battle."
[2:23:40] He's called kings to come and fight.
[2:23:46] And it's by the grace of God that we've
[2:23:48] been able to have a camp and that the
[2:23:51] Holy Spirit would have men of God come
[2:23:53] and minister in such a way as this. Now,
[2:23:57] you must determine, I'm not going to be
[2:24:00] the same.
[2:24:02] Is that your determination?
[2:24:05] I I I'm not going to be the same. I'm
[2:24:07] not going to fall in that same old rut.
[2:24:11] I've taken God at his word and I'm going
[2:24:13] to take him at his promise.
[2:24:16] And by the grace of God, I am totally
[2:24:19] free.
[2:24:20] Free now. Not by your emotion.
[2:24:24] Not by this emotion of it.
[2:24:27] But by the faith of it, you've heard the
[2:24:30] word. Faith cometh by hearing in what?
[2:24:33] Hearing the word. You've heard the word.
[2:24:36] You say, "Well, it's not just a camp
[2:24:38] experience. I'm going to go back to
[2:24:40] wherever I come from, and I'm going to
[2:24:42] fall in that same old rut." If Jesus has
[2:24:44] done something eternal, you can never go
[2:24:47] back to what you were.
[2:24:50] And you might as well tell the devil, "I
[2:24:52] am never going back to what I was.
[2:24:56] God sent a word for my life.
[2:25:01] God spoke to my heart. You didn't move
[2:25:03] here because somebody said, "Why don't
[2:25:05] you just go up front? Why did you come
[2:25:08] here tonight? Why did you move up here
[2:25:10] tonight? Why did you get out of your
[2:25:12] seat tonight?" It wasn't Brother Tim
[2:25:15] saying, "Just get up here. this is a
[2:25:18] time to to react to the things of God or
[2:25:21] brother Tom screaming out or no it was
[2:25:24] the beckoning of the still small voice
[2:25:28] of God that moved Elijah has moved you
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; and you can say you can when you read
[2:25:36] that scripture you said it wasn't in the
[2:25:38] thunder wasn't in the lightning it
[2:25:41] wasn't in the earthquake but it was in
[2:25:43] that still small voice
[2:25:46] that you can say moved me to this spot.
[2:25:50] And if God could speak to Elijah like
[2:25:52] that, then he could speak to me like
[2:25:54] that. And why would we want to go back
[2:25:56] and be the same? We're never going to be
[2:25:59] the same again.
[2:26:03] Are you thankful?
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; He will continue the deal. He doesn't
[2:26:08] stop just because of you have a
[2:26:10] wonderful time in his presence. It does
[2:26:13] not stop.
[2:26:15] Brother Tom's never stopped and said,
[2:26:18] "Boy, I'm so thankful what he did for me
[2:26:20] in 1985.
[2:26:22] I don't live in 1985. I'm in 2018." And
[2:26:26] if God can't speak to me tonight, then
[2:26:29] what kind of a God do we have? People
[2:26:32] live on the laurels of their past
[2:26:33] history. Not so for the bride of Jesus
[2:26:36] Christ and not so for the redeemed of
[2:26:39] God. He will deal tonight. He will deal
[2:26:41] tomorrow. He will continue to deal with
[2:26:43] us. Just make yourself available.
[2:26:47] Just make yourself available and just
[2:26:50] say, "Lord, here am I."
[2:26:52] Now, can I ask you one more time? Did
[2:26:54] God do something for you?
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; You know why I asked you that? Because
[2:26:59] now confession is good for your soul.
[2:27:04] And the prophet said, "If you confess
[2:27:06] it,
[2:27:08] your confession will make your body
[2:27:12] subject to it. It's not in your mind."
[2:27:15] And I can't stand mind people where it's
[2:27:19] just all in their mind. There's no
[2:27:21] expression because the prophet taught us
[2:27:24] to put the word on our lips to speak the
[2:27:27] word of God and make that body line
[2:27:30] right up to it. You've confessed it and
[2:27:34] you watch God now come behind you. Amen.
[2:27:37] Let's bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:27:44] He knows my name.
[2:27:46] He knows our name.
[2:27:50] As brother Ron had said, Lord,
[2:27:55] we know our own address
[2:27:58] and we know our name.
[2:28:01] And we know our own situations.
[2:28:04] We know our own hurts.
[2:28:07] And we know our own problems.
[2:28:11] We know that. But Lord, the wonderful
[2:28:13] part is you know that.
[2:28:16] And you said in your word, Lord, that
[2:28:18] you are the great healer.
[2:28:22] And you're the healer of the broken
[2:28:24] pieces.
[2:28:26] You're the healer of these lives that
[2:28:28] are standing represented here. Young men
[2:28:32] and women in the beauty of their youth
[2:28:37] and they're standing here for a reason.
[2:28:40] And so Lord God, we have committed them
[2:28:43] into your divine care.
[2:28:46] Would you lead them, Lord, not just as
[2:28:49] you have this evening, but as they leave
[2:28:51] out of the tent and go to their cabins
[2:28:56] and in the next couple of days they will
[2:28:57] go home. Will you be their friend that
[2:29:01] stickketh closer than a brother? The
[2:29:05] presence that is here, may it minister
[2:29:07] them on a daily basis.
[2:29:11] May you be that friend and be that
[2:29:14] guide.
[2:29:15] Lord, don't let it be just by emotion.
[2:29:20] Let it be by an experience
[2:29:23] of God himself
[2:29:25] speaking and dealing in an individual
[2:29:28] soul.
[2:29:30] I commit this lovely group to you
[2:29:33] tonight, asking Lord you'll continue to
[2:29:38] guide and to keep them in your perfect
[2:29:41] will. We pray.
[2:29:43] In Jesus' name.
[2:29:45] Amen. Let's just sing that as we make
[2:29:48] our way back to our seats. And you're
[2:29:51] dismissed in Jesus' name. God be with
[2:29:54] you, watch over you on the road, and may
[2:29:57] the presence of God
[2:30:00] lead you and keep you in his perfect
[2:30:02] will. He knows
[2:30:06] my name.
[2:30:10] I have a
[2:30:18] before
[2:30:19] my heart
[2:30:25] and before
[2:30:28] even time began.
[2:30:32] My life was in
[2:30:36] his hand.
[2:30:42] He knows
[2:30:44] my name.
[2:30:49] He knows
[2:30:51] my every
[2:30:54] thought.
[2:30:57] He sees
[2:30:59] each
[2:31:04] and
[2:31:07] I
[2:31:21] He calls me
[2:31:29] and
[2:31:35] no matter where
[2:31:38] I go.
[2:31:46] Heat. Heat. Heat.
