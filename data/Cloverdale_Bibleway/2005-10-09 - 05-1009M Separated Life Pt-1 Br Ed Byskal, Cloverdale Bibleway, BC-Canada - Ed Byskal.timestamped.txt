[13:28] the service in a word of prayer this
[13:29] morning. Um, as a testimony, Brother
[13:33] Joseph and Sister Bobby, uh, after a
[13:36] very long struggle for 18 months, the
[13:38] Lord sold their house. Amen. And they're
[13:41] very thankful for that.
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] I want to thank everyone that was
[13:47] praying and uh also a testimony this
[13:50] morning from our brother Darren Hoffman.
[13:52] He was riding his bike home from school
[13:54] was hit by a car. Brother Benjamin,
[13:57] brother Darren's son, and uh uh hit him
[14:01] in the leg, struck threw him onto his
[14:03] back. It's a lot of pain, but no broken
[14:06] bones. And the next morning, the pain
[14:09] was gone. He was able to walk on his
[14:11] own. And uh other than a few scrapes and
[14:13] a sore leg, he's doing great. And they
[14:15] want to thank the Lord for that. Thank
[14:18] [Music]
[14:26] uh Brother Milo's requesting prayer for
[14:29] uh Johanna, his wife. She's been told by
[14:32] the doctor she has cancer on one of her
[14:34] kidneys. Scheduled to have an operation,
[14:37] the removal of the kidney on November
[14:38] the 10th. Uh just want to pray that God
[14:41] would use this situation to draw her
[14:44] close to him and heal her spiritually
[14:46] and physically.
[14:47] Um Chris has got praying for Candy Rose
[14:51] for salvation, restoration back to her
[14:53] husband. Uh it's a request for a number
[14:56] of people here who are in need of
[14:58] salvation. And uh uh Sister Sally Dods
[15:02] is requesting prayer that God would
[15:04] continue to bless Sister Jerry and
[15:06] health. And uh I want to remember her
[15:09] sister Karine Clement. Uh yesterday her
[15:12] niece gave birth to a baby boy with a
[15:15] severe cleft pallet, cleft lip, just
[15:17] requesting for encouragement, strength
[15:19] for them that God would show himself.
[15:22] Sister Lorie Lane is requesting prayer
[15:24] for Ava. A lot of prayer. Sister Marilyn
[15:27] Hunts at home ill this morning. Chris
[15:30] Walman's requesting prayer for Kendra
[15:32] who's at home sick with a fever. And
[15:34] Sister Geneva hurt her foot. Wants us to
[15:36] pray. They're going to to the hospital
[15:38] this morning to have it checked. She's
[15:39] in a lot of pain. We had a lot a lot of
[15:41] needs this morning. I know there's
[15:43] people listening in on the internet who
[15:44] have a request and needs on their
[15:46] hearts. If you've got a need here this
[15:48] morning, just lift before the Lord a
[15:49] good prayer.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] Let us bow our heads.
[16:01] our gracious most loving father,
[16:05] Lord, so many requests and so many
[16:08] needs,
[16:10] but you have already provided, Lord.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; And I thank you, dear God, together with
[16:16] my brothers and sisters here this
[16:18] morning that we have one confession and
[16:22] that is that Jesus has already overcome
[16:24] for us.
[16:25] And Lord, no matter what the need be,
[16:28] &gt;&gt; we have one need this morning. That is
[16:30] to believe.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we come to honor the
[16:34] resurrection
[16:35] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ that is living within
[16:38] us.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we do not look to a God who
[16:41] cannot be touched by the feeling of our
[16:43] infirmities.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; But we look to the God who dwells within
[16:46] the soul.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, our five senses lead us astray.
[16:50] Hallelujah.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; And we Lord God fall by the way often
[16:54] during the week. But when we come
[16:56] together Lord and just one God is just a
[16:59] thought away. And Lord here we come this
[17:02] morning together with faith believing
[17:05] Lord that every prayer request that has
[17:07] been made you've heard them Lord. I
[17:09] don't even know half these people Lord
[17:12] but you knew them before the foundation
[17:14] of the world. And you knew that this
[17:16] trial and temptation would come their
[17:18] way. And this is the hour for them to
[17:20] confess that Jesus Christ is the one who
[17:25] will overcome.
[17:27] So Lord, as we raise our hands this
[17:29] morning as needy people, we pray God
[17:32] that as the word will go forth, may the
[17:35] word bring victory Lord in our lives
[17:38] from the youngest to the oldest. Oh God,
[17:41] set us Lord apart from this world.
[17:44] Separate us Lord from our unbelief Lord
[17:47] that we may lay ourselves in the
[17:49] presence and let Jesus Christ as Jesus
[17:52] said, "I do nothing but what the Father
[17:54] first shows me." So likewise, oh God,
[17:57] may we do nothing this morning. No, may
[17:59] no thought enter our minds but what
[18:01] comes from above. Lord, come as we feast
[18:04] around thy word. Take the vessel that
[18:06] would minister, Lord, hiding behind that
[18:08] rugged cross. And Lord, may the living
[18:11] blood speak, Lord, that it may cleanse
[18:14] us as we hear the word. May it wash us
[18:17] whiter than snow. We thank you, Lord,
[18:19] for this grand opportunity, Lord. For we
[18:22] know that this opportunity will be taken
[18:24] away from us soon, Lord. Our Bibles and
[18:26] the books will be taken away in our
[18:28] buildings, but they cannot take the word
[18:31] that has been planted in the soul. They
[18:33] can never remove that, Lord. for that is
[18:35] what you're coming back for. Lord, you
[18:37] come into rapture take away the word
[18:39] that you planted on the earth. So Lord,
[18:42] I pray may the word take a deep anchor
[18:44] in the soul this morning. Lord, there is
[18:47] no trial for a believer who's in Christ
[18:50] for you have already overcome. And we
[18:52] give you all the honor and the praise
[18:54] and thanksgiving. But we remember to
[18:56] thee, Lord, again the names that have
[18:58] been called forth this morning, the many
[19:00] thanks, Lord, that have gone forth for
[19:03] the blessings upon each family. We
[19:06] acknowledge that you are the one who
[19:07] gives every good gift. And Lord, you are
[19:10] the one that removes everything that's
[19:12] unclean. Hallelujah.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; So we lay ourselves in your presence
[19:14] this morning to be washed whiter than
[19:17] snow. For we ask these mercies in giving
[19:20] thee all the praise and the honor and
[19:21] the glory in Jesus precious name. Amen.
[19:25] Lord
[19:31] seated.
[19:34] [Music]
[19:46] Want to welcome everyone who's visiting
[19:48] with us this morning. We're real happy
[19:50] to have you if you're visiting here. And
[19:53] a special welcome this morning to our
[19:55] brother Ron and sister Mary Borthwick
[19:58] here with us from Scotland. We get them
[20:00] to stand up so everybody can see them.
[20:03] Amen. They're up at the back. God bless
[20:04] you. We're happy to have you here.
[20:11] Um there's a baptismal service tonight.
[20:14] I think we got uh a few that are being
[20:16] baptized. So if you uh the Lord's been
[20:21] dealing with you with respect to
[20:22] baptism, um you might want to see one of
[20:25] the senior brothers here at the church.
[20:27] Um there's an announcement the deacons
[20:30] asked me to make and uh that is to
[20:33] please ensure prayer requests and
[20:34] testimonies are given to the deacons at
[20:36] least 10 minutes before the start of the
[20:38] service.
[20:40] Uh there a couple reasons for that. One,
[20:42] so that whoever is leading the song
[20:44] service can read it ahead of time. Um,
[20:47] and uh, so the deacons don't have to
[20:49] interrupt the service by bringing
[20:50] something up during the service. So, um,
[20:56] and I can just say I just put my own
[20:58] spin on it. There's only one reason why
[21:00] they aren't here 10 minutes before, and
[21:01] that's because you're late coming here
[21:02] to service. And you say, well, you know,
[21:06] I got kids. Oh, I've been there. Okay.
[21:08] Had kids. I've leaned song service all
[21:10] the time. I had kids. Had to be here
[21:11] early, you know. So say, "Well, how do
[21:15] you get there early?" "Uh, leave in
[21:16] time." "Yeah, it's real hard. H hard to
[21:19] figure out." "Yeah, but I, you know, I'm
[21:21] so tired. Go to bed earlier.
[21:24] You know, I mean, I get up in the
[21:25] morning, 5:00 every morning." He said,
[21:27] "How can you do that? It's easy. I just
[21:29] move to the Toronto time zone. I
[21:30] actually get up at 8:00 in Toronto, you
[21:33] know, and I go to bed, you know, late in
[21:36] Toronto, but I get enough sleep for
[21:38] myself that in Toronto I'd have, you
[21:40] know, I'd be I'd be doing okay." They'd
[21:41] say, "Hey, Rod's sleeping in." You know,
[21:43] but just you just move your time zone.
[21:45] Depends where you want to live, you
[21:46] know, and if it's important for you to
[21:48] be here in church on time. Is it
[21:50] important for you to be here in church
[21:51] on time? Right. They just get up early,
[21:54] go to bed early, you have to stay up
[21:56] late, you know, it's tough. I know.
[22:00] Anyways, they uh I told them I'd be the
[22:03] bad guy. So,
[22:06] Amen.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We've got some uh sisters
[22:10] who have a song to sing this morning.
[22:12] Sister Patricia, if you could bring the
[22:14] girls this morning. They've got uh group
[22:16] of girls want to sing a song and they
[22:19] were too nervous to say to actually say
[22:23] something. Although they're in front of
[22:24] everybody and they're singing, they're
[22:26] dedicating the song to Sister uh Vidy
[22:29] who's leaving. And so they want to make
[22:31] sure that uh she knows that this song is
[22:33] specifically for her.
[23:00] [Music]
[23:28] I've been blessed with many
[23:33] things.
[23:34] God's been good to me.
[23:39] [Music]
[23:42] I have family and friends who share
[23:48] in all I do.
[23:55] But if I lose it all and I am left with
[24:02] nothing.
[24:08] If I have the Lord I know I'll make it
[24:15] through.
[24:21] He's the only reason I live.
[24:26] But oh, what a reason.
[24:29] [Music]
[24:34] He's the only reason I live.
[24:38] But oh, what a reason.
[24:42] [Music]
[24:45] You see, there's nothing in this world
[24:49] worth living for.
[24:52] It only leaves you empty and longing for
[24:56] more.
[24:58] He's the only reason I live.
[25:02] But oh, what a reason.
[25:09] You may have tried a whole lot of things
[25:15] to find real happiness.
[25:22] But if you look very long, then you'll
[25:26] know that it just cannot be found.
[25:33] [Music]
[25:34] until you find the Lord. And you know
[25:39] the power of his spirit,
[25:42] his sweet Holy Spirit.
[25:46] He'll be your reason to live and he'll
[25:50] never let you down.
[25:56] Oh,
[25:59] he's the only reason I live.
[26:03] But oh, what a reason.
[26:11] He's the only reason I live.
[26:15] But oh, what a reason.
[26:22] You see, there's nothing in this world
[26:26] worth living for.
[26:28] It only leaves you empty and longing for
[26:33] more.
[26:34] He's the only reason I live.
[26:39] But over.
[26:40] [Music]
[26:45] You see, there's nothing in this world
[26:49] that's worth living for. It only leaves
[26:53] you empty and longing for more.
[26:58] He's the only reason I live.
[27:02] Oh, he's the only reason I live.
[27:07] Oh,
[27:09] he's the only reason I live.
[27:14] Oh,
[27:17] what a reason.
[27:21] [Music]
[27:24] [Applause]
[27:34] Praise God.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Glad you got a reason to live. Thanks,
[27:39] sisters. That was wonderful.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:44] We're going to be turning to the word
[27:45] now just as we come. Let's uh sing the
[27:48] song that the choir sang couple of weeks
[27:50] ago. Holy words long preserved. Amen.
[27:54] Aren't you thankful for the word of God
[27:56] this morning? Amen. And uh those of you
[27:58] in the choir who know this song and sang
[28:00] it, you can sing it real loud. Help me
[28:02] out here.
[28:04] [Music]
[28:08] Holy words
[28:11] are preserved
[28:13] for our walk
[28:15] in this world. They resound with God's
[28:21] own heart. Oh, let the word of God
[28:25] inspire.
[28:27] Words of life,
[28:30] words of hope.
[28:32] Give us strength.

[28:37] in this world where we roll. The word of
[28:42] God will guide us all.

[28:51] Changing me,
[28:53] changing you.
[28:55] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[29:00] the word of God inspire.
[29:04] Holy words
[29:07] of our faith
[29:09] handed down
[29:11] to his
[29:16] sacrifice.
[29:18] Oh, he faithful words.
[29:23] Holy words
[29:25] long preserve
[29:27] for our
[29:29] in this world
[29:32] [Music]
[29:33] with God.
[29:36] Oh let the word of God
[29:40] word of God
[29:43] ever true.
[29:45] Changing me and changing you.
[29:49] We have come with holy heart forever. A
[29:55] single sac.
[29:58] Holy word
[30:01] of our faith
[30:03] handing down
[30:05] to
[30:07] [Music]
[30:09] sacriice
[30:11] for the faithful words of Christ.
[30:16] Holy word, our preserve
[30:20] for our
[30:23] is
[30:28] high. Oh, let the world go.
[30:33] Word of God.
[30:38] Changing me and changing you.
[30:42] We have come before high
[30:46] and the word of God is
[30:50] the word of God
[30:58] you
[31:00] have
[31:04] for the word of God.
[31:09] of God.
[31:17] We are
[31:19] open
[31:21] for the word of God.
[31:25] The word of God
[31:28] [Music]
[31:32] changing you. We are
[31:36] Open
[31:39] the word of God
[31:42] today.
[31:44] [Music]
[31:48] Changing me,
[31:50] changing you. We have come with open
[31:55] hearts
[31:57] and the word of God.
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] We're going to sing that chorus once
[32:04] more before we sing it.
[32:06] I would like to remind you of the words,
[32:10] it could only change if we come with
[32:14] open heart.
[32:15] If we don't come with open heart,
[32:17] depends on why we came to church this
[32:19] morning to the gathering of the people.
[32:21] But if we didn't come with an open
[32:23] heart, if we just came because you know
[32:26] someone else is coming or because we our
[32:29] wife or husband or our family or
[32:31] whatever more is here, that's not
[32:33] enough. it won't impart and then the
[32:36] service will just be a social a
[32:38] gathering. We don't want it as a social
[32:40] gathering. We want the word now by the
[32:43] Holy Spirit to come and impart to us
[32:45] what we have need of. Amen. And he will
[32:48] do that if we come with open heart. And
[32:51] so just in case that had not been on
[32:53] your mind, let it be on your mind now.
[32:56] I've come with open heart. Lord, come
[32:58] and feed me, great shepherd of the
[33:00] flock.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know exactly what I
[33:03] need. Just take me to that part of the
[33:05] pasture and feed my soul. Amen. Word of
[33:10] God
[33:11] ever through
[33:14] changing me
[33:16] changing you.
[33:18] We have
[33:20] open heart.
[33:22] Let the word of God be.
[33:26] The word of God
[33:29] ever true, changing me,
[33:34] changing you.
[33:36] We have come with open heart so that the
[33:41] word of God impart.
[33:45] Hallelujah.
[33:47] This is our prayer, dear Lord.
[33:51] While we have sung and worshiped in this
[33:54] service, we have prayed. We've had
[33:57] needs. We've brought them before you.
[33:59] But now we come, oh God, with perhaps
[34:02] our greatest need. And that is each one
[34:04] of us bearing ourselves before your
[34:07] throne, saying, "Lord, here I am.
[34:10] I am yours. I've come to be molded. I've
[34:15] come to be cleansed. I've come to be
[34:18] moved upon.
[34:19] We are here that we might be uh set
[34:23] aside, Lord, and for your purpose, for
[34:26] your call. We are here that we might be
[34:30] equipped that when we leave here, we are
[34:33] more prepared to meet the future. Lord,
[34:36] I pray that you will endow us with the
[34:38] Holy Spirit. fill those that are not yet
[34:42] filled, sealing them with that sealing
[34:45] of the Holy Spirit. I pray, oh God,
[34:48] you'll bless each one, not only present,
[34:51] but those that are present now in the
[34:54] invisible audience wherever they may be
[34:57] around the world. Oh God, we're
[34:59] remembering Brother Murphy and Brother
[35:02] Ivan in China. Oh God, cause them to be
[35:06] fruitful in your kingdom. and those that
[35:08] may be listening just now in China and
[35:10] Europe and Africa, wherever they might
[35:13] be, we just pray that your blessings
[35:15] will be upon them. And Lord, that your
[35:18] presence will come into that home
[35:20] directly into the room directly wherever
[35:23] they might be into the room. Oh God,
[35:26] praying for Sister Marge Miller again
[35:28] this morning. Lord, I pray, oh God, that
[35:31] the divine touch of the almighty
[35:34] miraculous God, touch her body, Lord,
[35:37] and do according to your will. For you
[35:40] have said, I am the Lord that health
[35:43] thee, healeth all thy diseases, oh God,
[35:46] all thy diseases. Cancer is nothing
[35:49] before you, Lord. None of these things
[35:51] are anything before you, oh God. You're
[35:54] the God of all might and power and
[35:56] strength. And we don't only pray for
[35:58] these deliverances and healings, Lord,
[36:00] for the benefit of the people, but that
[36:02] the name of Jesus Christ will be
[36:05] glorified.
[36:07] [Music]
[36:08] Be glorified amongst us this morning.
[36:10] Anoint the hearers and the speaker in
[36:14] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[36:17] bless you.
[36:19] Thank you for your prayers. I'm feeling
[36:22] a good deal better and we're happy over
[36:25] that. We're so thankful to
[36:28] have you welcomed our brother, brother
[36:31] and sister Borthwick. And we are
[36:35] uh this is I think our first time to be
[36:38] able to have our brother Borthwick and
[36:40] his wife here visiting their son
[36:42] Jonathan and daughter-in-law Crystal who
[36:45] formerly was Crystal McNeel. And now
[36:48] they have a they have a child. Isn't it
[36:50] amazing how someone has a child and his
[36:54] son daughter-in-law have a baby and
[36:57] causes them to come all the way across
[36:58] the ocean to see us? Well, uh we're
[37:02] thankful too. And now I prayed upon our
[37:04] brother Borthwick to to speak for us
[37:07] next Sunday night and he's consented
[37:11] even though he let me know he didn't
[37:12] come to speak and uh I know that no
[37:15] preacher comes to preach. He'd like to
[37:17] have a vacation. So, we'll just pray
[37:19] that God will make the vacation a little
[37:21] bit better and uh and then he'll be able
[37:24] to share with us the burden of his
[37:26] heart. Amen. So, that'll be next Sunday
[37:28] night. And then tonight, we're having
[37:29] baptismal. Uh so, those of you that uh
[37:34] are going to be baptized and maybe
[37:35] somebody didn't plan to be baptized, if
[37:38] you've not been baptized in the name of
[37:39] the Lord Jesus Christ, now's the time to
[37:42] do it.
[37:44] Amen. Now, we're going to be reading in
[37:47] Corinthians 2 Corinthians 6 and we're
[37:51] starting with verse 11,
[37:54] but I would like to say that uh
[37:58] brother Bram said a number of things
[38:00] about the Corinthians and there's some
[38:02] wonderful just the whole word is the
[38:05] whole word is Christ.
[38:08] Christ is every scripture.
[38:10] But as far as the people of Corinth were
[38:14] concerned, brother Brandham says a good
[38:16] deal about them that Paul could not deal
[38:20] with the Corinthians like he could deal
[38:22] with the Ephesians or the Romans and
[38:26] some of the others, but he mentions
[38:28] especially the Ephesians. He said of the
[38:30] Corinthians, you're you're maturing,
[38:32] growing, but when you ought to be
[38:35] teachers, you're still babes
[38:37] uh needing teaching.
[38:40] He said another place, the Corinthians
[38:43] didn't know how to set the church in
[38:45] order.
[38:46] He said, uh Paul couldn't teach the
[38:49] Corinthians deep things. He couldn't go
[38:52] into the deep things that he taught the
[38:54] Ephesians and the Romans.
[38:57] And he said another place that
[38:59] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[39:02] how that before the foundation of the
[39:04] world they were predestinated
[39:07] unto the adoption of sons of God. The
[39:10] the Corinthians didn't understand that
[39:13] they couldn't be taught that because
[39:15] that's somehow they just didn't have the
[39:17] capacity. And I believe in every
[39:19] congregation
[39:21] uh I spoke to some ministers meetings
[39:24] and
[39:26] in speaking to them I said you know we
[39:28] all have Corinthians and we all have
[39:31] Ephesians in our congregations
[39:35] &gt;&gt; but the the purpose of the ministry
[39:38] if there's anyone here that struggles
[39:41] with the predestination of God and maybe
[39:44] you know it hasn't become a reality to
[39:46] you you know that starts taking people
[39:48] into a deeper realm. But any that are
[39:52] here that may have may still be in the
[39:54] Corinthian church, I say move out of
[39:56] that church and come over into the
[39:58] Ephesians. We're here to move people
[40:01] from the Corinthians to the Ephesians.
[40:03] Don't don't sit where you can't be
[40:05] taught. So, well, I don't really, you
[40:07] know, I don't really grasp that. That's
[40:09] just a little too deep for me or
[40:10] whatever. None of it's deep to the
[40:12] believer cuz the Holy Spirit's here to
[40:14] make it all a reality to you. Amen. I
[40:18] want to speak this morning on the
[40:21] separated life.
[40:24] The separated life.
[40:27] Uh we will start by reading Corinthians
[40:30] the 11th uh 6 the 6th chapter 11th
[40:33] verse.
[40:36] Oh ye Corinthians
[40:38] our mouth is open unto you. Our heart is
[40:41] enlarged.
[40:44] Ye are not straightened in us, but ye
[40:47] are straightened in our your own bowels.
[40:52] Now for a recompense in the same, I
[40:55] speak unto my children, but ye also, be
[41:00] ye also enlarged.
[41:03] And then he goes into the next three
[41:05] verses. I'd like you to notice he's
[41:07] making comparisons here. Be ye not
[41:10] unequally yolked. and that is to have
[41:14] fellowship with one who is not an equal.
[41:18] Be not unequally yolked together with
[41:21] unbelievers.
[41:23] Now he asks the questions, for what
[41:26] fellowship hath righteousness with
[41:28] unrighteousness?
[41:30] And what communion hath light with
[41:33] darkness? And what concord agreement
[41:37] hath Christ with bile? And bal is a name
[41:40] that has been used for Satan or
[41:42] wickedness.
[41:43] Or what part hath he that believeth with
[41:47] an infidel? And what agreement hath the
[41:50] temple of God with idols? We can say
[41:53] with all of those, none.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; None is the answer.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the point that Paul's trying
[42:00] to make. There is none.
[42:03] For ye are the temple of the living God,
[42:06] as God hath said, I will dwell in them,
[42:10] and walk in them, and I will be their
[42:14] God, and they shall be my people.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:19] Wherefore come out from among them, and
[42:22] be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and
[42:25] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[42:29] receive you, and will be a father unto
[42:31] you, and you shall be my sons and
[42:34] daughters, saith the Almighty, the Lord
[42:37] Almighty.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to read a scripture. You
[42:42] can just hold your attention.
[42:44] It is Hebrews 7 and 26 speaking of Jesus
[42:48] Christ as our high priest. For such an
[42:50] high priest became us who is holy,
[42:55] harmless, undefiled,
[42:58] separate from sinners and made higher
[43:01] than the heavens.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Although he was separate from sinners,
[43:04] yet he was right amongst them and called
[43:06] the friend of sinners. So yet he was
[43:08] separate from sinners. You may have your
[43:11] seats.
[43:13] And just while you
[43:17] are perhaps want to keep your Bible
[43:18] handy because we'll be using it
[43:22] as we go along. Now in this context
[43:29] all right
[43:32] Ephesians church.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] In case you say well maybe I'm a
[43:41] Corinthian. Well, we just wanted to move
[43:43] you over to Ephesians.
[43:46] In the Leodysian church age message,
[43:50] church age, brother Brandham said, "But
[43:52] thank God at this moment, this age is
[43:56] not over."
[43:58] He said, "He is yet crying, and his cry
[44:02] is not in the spiritual ears." I'm
[44:05] sorry. And his cry is not only in the
[44:09] spiritual ears of men by his spirit, but
[44:13] once again a prophet is in the land.
[44:15] Aren't we thankful for that?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Once more, God will reveal the truth as
[44:21] he did to Paul. In the days of the
[44:24] seventh messenger, in the days of the
[44:26] Leodysian age, its messenger will reveal
[44:30] the mysteries of God as revealed to
[44:34] Paul. Now, I'd like you to notice these
[44:36] lines. He will speak out, and those who
[44:40] receive that prophet in his own name
[44:43] will receive the beneficient
[44:46] effect
[44:47] of that prophet's ministry.
[44:50] And they that hear him will be blessed
[44:54] and become part of that bride of the
[44:58] last day, who are mentioned in
[45:00] Revelation 22:17.
[45:02] The spirit and the bride say come.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; The corn of wheat in brackets, the bride
[45:11] word, that's the corn of wheat, the
[45:12] bride word that fell into the ground at
[45:16] Naa
[45:17] has come back to the original word grain
[45:22] again.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever. Yes. Listen to the
[45:26] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[45:30] in this last age. What he says from God,
[45:34] the bride will say
[45:37] &gt;&gt; what he says from God, the bride will
[45:40] say.
[45:42] The spirit and the prophet and the bride
[45:45] will be saying the same thing.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; And what they will say will have already
[45:51] been said in the word.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; They are now they are saying it now.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; They are saying it now. The bride is
[46:02] saying it now.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Come out from among the from come out
[46:08] from among her now and be separate. The
[46:12] cry has gone out. The cry is going out.
[46:17] How long will the voice cry? We do not
[46:19] know. But one thing we do know, it won't
[46:24] be long. For this is the last stage.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; And if any part of it's true, it's all
[46:29] true. what has just been spoken. It
[46:31] won't be long for this is the last age.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; This is the last time. I think we're a
[46:38] very highly privileged people
[46:42] &gt;&gt; to know what you know to whatever degree
[46:45] you know it. Thank God for that.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Whether it's little or whether it's
[46:49] much. Whether it's been a short time or
[46:52] whether it's been a long time, I think
[46:54] we need to really be grateful to God
[46:57] that he's brought us where he has and
[47:00] we're hearing what we are hearing. Now,
[47:03] separation is twofold.
[47:06] Separation is coming out from and being
[47:09] joined to. I was going to entitle this
[47:13] message that we are we are separated to
[47:17] be connected. And that's really what
[47:19] it's all about. And we can't be
[47:21] connected till we're separated.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; We need to have experience a separation.
[47:26] We have to be separated maybe uh well
[47:29] there are so many many things but we
[47:31] need to be separated from our from our
[47:34] own ways
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and our own in in when we were in sin or
[47:38] whatever more. We had to be separated
[47:40] from that before we can be joined. We
[47:42] got to be separated from unrighteousness
[47:44] to in order to be separated to right
[47:46] joined to righteousness. We have to be
[47:48] separated from unbelief so we can be
[47:50] joined to the life of faith. We have to
[47:53] be separated in order that we can be
[47:55] joined. So the believer's life
[47:58] speaks loud and clearly
[48:02] many different things. The believer's
[48:05] life, your life speaks loudly and
[48:09] clearly many different things to many
[48:12] different people.
[48:14] One thing that the believer's life does
[48:17] say,
[48:19] your life says it, come out from among
[48:22] them
[48:23] &gt;&gt; and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord.
[48:26] Now, I want you to think about your life
[48:28] because your life, I'm going to be
[48:30] speaking about the expression of your
[48:31] life because it is that expression
[48:35] that you perhaps, you know, it's just
[48:38] your own life. And so, you don't think a
[48:40] whole lot about it is this is the way I
[48:42] live. this this has become this just
[48:45] this is what I do. This is how I do it.
[48:46] This is the way I live and so on and so
[48:48] forth. But the things that have be
[48:50] you've become very accustomed to are
[48:52] very strange to most people.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; And so they look at that. I want you
[48:59] just I want to get you in the right
[49:00] track now in the right channel. They
[49:02] look at how you approach things, how you
[49:06] see things, how you speak. Now this says
[49:09] of Jesus that he was separate of
[49:12] sinners. He was separate of sinners and
[49:15] yet he was a friend of sinners. He was
[49:16] right amongst them. So how was it that
[49:18] he was separate? He was separate in that
[49:22] he looked at things differently.
[49:25] He spoke differently.
[49:28] what he heard and how he received uh
[49:32] what he heard and how he responded, how
[49:35] he reacted was completely different from
[49:38] others. And when they observed that,
[49:40] they could see this man is different.
[49:44] This man speaks differently. This man,
[49:48] they they watched observed how he
[49:50] reacted when a certain in a certain
[49:53] situation he reacted. the people would
[49:55] react one way but he'd react a different
[49:57] way and that is why it was so essential
[49:59] for the disciples
[50:01] you know just as a little bit personal
[50:04] testimony when I I found myself thrust
[50:08] right in the presence and with brother
[50:10] Brandham and going with him that was the
[50:13] one thing at a as a young man 27 years
[50:16] old that was the one thing that I it was
[50:19] just I suppose it's part of my nature
[50:22] I'm an observer I observe people. I'm
[50:25] observing you right now. I've I've had
[50:27] ministers come and say, "We notice that
[50:29] you really watch the congregation. You
[50:32] see their responses." Absolutely.
[50:34] Because I don't want to be up here just
[50:36] talking to the air. I want to see I can
[50:38] see from the faces. I can see the way
[50:41] the you know the way you look in the
[50:43] eyes and I can see the very you know the
[50:46] very attitude that you have. I can see
[50:49] what is happening. And if a p if a pre
[50:51] preacher is not getting there and then
[50:53] there's no use preaching. And I watch
[50:55] brother Brandham. I would just observe
[50:58] him. I watch him in all kinds of
[50:59] situation. I want to see how he held his
[51:02] Bible. I never told him any of this. I
[51:04] want to see how he held his Bible. I
[51:06] want to see how he, you know, did he
[51:08] say, "Oh, amen. Glory to God.
[51:10] Hallelujah." All the time. I want to see
[51:12] that. He He never did that. And I
[51:13] observed that. Say he hasn't got a bunch
[51:15] of filler words. He doesn't he doesn't
[51:18] he he's got he's not got a bunch of
[51:20] religious jargon out there. He just he's
[51:22] himself. He just his own life. I saw him
[51:25] in in times when I was I was starting to
[51:28] burn inside, you know, with a little
[51:30] frustration cuz things aren't going just
[51:33] right. But he thought it was just fine,
[51:35] you know, and then go on one hunt and he
[51:38] never got to fire a shot that I know of
[51:40] unless it was just a target shot. Never
[51:42] got to fire a shot. Driving all the way
[51:44] from uh from Jeffersonville and all the
[51:48] way up there probably 3,500 miles. Never
[51:50] fire a shot. Drive all the way back.
[51:52] Have bad weather. I thought, you know,
[51:56] why don't you stay a little longer? Oh,
[51:58] he said, "That's fine, Brother Eddie."
[52:00] He said, "That means I can come again. I
[52:03] can come next year." I thought, man,
[52:04] that's a wonderful way to look at it. I
[52:06] I'm just not there yet. I I think I'm
[52:08] still in Corinthians or some
[52:12] when you have a big disappointment, it's
[52:15] nice to be able to see it from another
[52:16] side. Oh, that's just fine. Everything's
[52:19] just fine.
[52:22] Well,
[52:23] uh,
[52:25] we live our lives, as I said a moment
[52:27] ago, and it becomes, you know, just like
[52:29] common place. But people are observing.
[52:32] They're observing things about you that
[52:35] to you, you don't think they're
[52:36] anything, but they're looking at it.
[52:38] They're seeing how you speak, how you
[52:41] respond, what you think, the conclusions
[52:44] you come to, what is valuable to you,
[52:48] what is not, what's important, what is
[52:50] not important.
[52:52] You know, the fact that you come to
[52:53] church three times a week, that just
[52:55] shocks people.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Three times a week. I go probably three
[53:00] times a year.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; You're three times a week. You come, you
[53:05] move from Arkansas to go to church.
[53:07] What? You move from Phoenix. You move
[53:10] from someplace. You move from South
[53:13] Africa or wherever it is. You moved here
[53:16] from Congo or whatever more to go to
[53:18] church. You you quit the direction. You
[53:21] quit a good job. You quit. That doesn't
[53:24] compute.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; How does that work?
[53:28] But you were, what were you expressing?
[53:31] You're expressing that you're separated
[53:34] from the way they think. You're separate
[53:37] person. And Jesus was separate from
[53:39] sinners. Right amongst them, but
[53:41] separate. And so now I've kind of given
[53:43] you my theme.
[53:46] We start out.
[53:48] I'll get preaching along in a few
[53:50] moments.
[53:52] The Bible said to Abraham, "Now the Lord
[53:55] said unto Abram, get thee out of thy
[53:58] country, and from thy kindred, and from
[54:02] thy father's house, unto a land that I
[54:05] will show thee." So get out from your
[54:08] country, have a separation, out from
[54:10] your kindred, have a separation, out
[54:13] from your father's house. And brother
[54:16] Brandham said he was he was comfortable
[54:18] there. That was from his friends, his
[54:21] family, and all of these things. That
[54:23] was everything that he knew. And that
[54:26] was his whole comfort zone. You leave
[54:29] all of this unto a land that I will show
[54:31] you. You'll be joined to something else.
[54:34] But you have to leave this first.
[54:36] Abraham now is regarded as our father in
[54:39] the faith. And he was called out into a
[54:43] separated life. Now in the 12th chapter
[54:46] in verse 7 it says and the Lord appeared
[54:49] unto Abram because I know that I'm
[54:52] speaking to a congregation of people
[54:54] that have been called out. Anybody that
[54:58] uh s is sustained I will say becomes
[55:01] consistent listener of the message of
[55:05] the hour I believe is a calledout
[55:08] person.
[55:10] You cannot be a consistent lover of the
[55:13] message. I'm talking about a lover not
[55:16] of your favorite sayings, but a lover of
[55:19] the message as a whole.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; They are called out.
[55:28] And the Lord God appeared unto Abram and
[55:30] said unto him, and said, "Unto thy
[55:33] seed." Now he's left. And so now the
[55:35] Lord is giving him a promise. unto thy
[55:38] seed I will give this land and there
[55:40] buildeth he an altar unto the Lord who
[55:43] appeared unto him. Now, God speaks to
[55:47] each individual.
[55:49] Whether you're young or elder, whether
[55:52] you're parents or whether your children,
[55:55] whether you're seniors here, or whether
[55:57] you're listening on the internet, every
[56:00] person that God has called. With that
[56:02] call comes a promise,
[56:06] a personal promise. It may not be thus
[56:09] sayeth the Lord. I will do this and I
[56:12] will give you this land or I will give
[56:13] you this job or I will give you this
[56:15] profession or whatever more or I will
[56:17] see that all of your cares are taken
[56:20] care of. It may not come like that. But
[56:21] when a call comes, when God moved upon
[56:25] the individual heart, some of you it may
[56:28] be further back than with others, but it
[56:30] may be recent to some of the young
[56:32] people and so on. But when God called
[56:35] that call, there there's there's like a
[56:40] like a horizon opens up
[56:42] &gt;&gt; and you see something out there. Perhaps
[56:45] you see a life.
[56:47] When many people were called, they were
[56:50] bound by something, shackled by
[56:53] something, shackled by religion,
[56:56] shackled by sin, shackled by habits,
[57:00] shackled by their own complexes, and
[57:03] they're terrible. Shackled. It's
[57:06] terrible to be in slavery. And they're
[57:09] shackled by something. Everyone was. And
[57:12] then and then when the call come, you
[57:14] begin to see perhaps a a a free person.
[57:18] Oh, I could be free.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful thing. I tell you
[57:22] what, I've seen people when the when the
[57:25] realization came on them that they were
[57:27] suddenly free.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; I've seen people, lots of people,
[57:30] hundreds if not thousands seen when the
[57:33] shackles fell from them. And I'll tell
[57:35] you the glory of God that comes upon
[57:37] their face and how they could say as
[57:40] that young soldier says, "I'm free. I'm
[57:42] free. I'm free." That was the only thing
[57:44] that was important to him. Three times,
[57:46] "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free." There's
[57:49] something glorious about being free, my
[57:52] brother, my sister.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And maybe God didn't say you're free,
[57:57] but but you saw some new horizon. You
[58:00] saw something for your life. It was. And
[58:02] that's God's promise to you. That's what
[58:05] God intended for you. Intended you to be
[58:08] perhaps free or turned around for
[58:12] myself. I was free of my questions. I
[58:15] was free of my uh curiosity that was
[58:20] overcoming me in a sense and confusion
[58:24] because when you when you're curious and
[58:26] you're asking questions, is this right
[58:27] or is that right or is this is this
[58:30] which way do I baptize? thou shall be
[58:31] baptized. What would it be if we had a
[58:34] confusion here about baptism? But it's
[58:36] so wonderful to be able to declare we
[58:38] have a thus sayith the Lord and we know
[58:40] how you should be baptized and that what
[58:43] you will receive after you are baptized
[58:45] and we've received it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And so
[58:52] Abraham does something that's very very
[58:54] important here. The Bible says that he
[58:58] builded an altar
[59:02] and Abraham went up out of uh it says
[59:05] that he Genesis 12:7 and the Lord
[59:08] appeared unto Abraham said unto thy seed
[59:12] I will give this land and there he
[59:16] builded an altar. He built a marker.
[59:21] He builded a place
[59:24] that he could remember and recall and he
[59:27] went back to this place more than once.
[59:29] I've spoken on that. But in today's
[59:32] service, I want to especially
[59:35] instruct those of you that God has
[59:38] spoken to recently
[59:40] and those of you that God first came to
[59:44] you perhaps even years ago. I want you
[59:46] to go back in your mind and remember
[59:49] that altar, that place that God spoke to
[59:52] you. We need to put down markers.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; We need to build
[59:58] markers or altars and their worship. The
[1:00:02] God that gave us that new horizon in our
[1:00:05] life allowed us to see what we could be
[1:00:10] in Christ.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] allowed us to see things in the message
[1:00:15] that your blinded mind could not see
[1:00:18] maybe a short time ago.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Excuse me.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Are you understanding me?
[1:00:30] You need to
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; you need to make a marker in that life
[1:00:35] in that part of your life so you can go
[1:00:38] back to it and recall it. And Abraham
[1:00:42] does go back to this
[1:00:45] place where he built this altar.
[1:00:49] You know, the reason why you need altars
[1:00:51] is because between those spots,
[1:00:54] lots of other things happen.
[1:00:57] All kinds of difficulties happen. And it
[1:01:00] was he had just built this altar and he
[1:01:02] got going just a short distance. Hadn't
[1:01:05] been on the way very long. And there
[1:01:08] came a a a family blow up.
[1:01:12] No one really likes that. But there got
[1:01:15] to be strife between
[1:01:18] his herdsmen, Abram's herdsman, and
[1:01:22] Lot's herdsmen because of the blessing
[1:01:25] of God actually.
[1:01:27] And now this may be a little strange for
[1:01:29] you, but God so blessed them and their
[1:01:32] herds so increased
[1:01:35] that it caused some dissension between
[1:01:38] the uh the herdsmen of of both Lot and
[1:01:42] his nephew or Abram and his nephew. And
[1:01:46] so Abram said, now notice, God has
[1:01:49] already promised Abram, the land is
[1:01:52] yours. I'm bringing you to this land.
[1:01:54] It's yours. But now he says to Lot, he's
[1:01:57] got such confidence, such faith in God's
[1:02:01] word. He says to Lot, Lot, just whatever
[1:02:06] you want, you choose. If you go to the
[1:02:10] right, I'll go to the left. If you go to
[1:02:13] the left, I'll go to the right. Have
[1:02:16] whatever part you want of the land.
[1:02:22] I'm going to read it.
[1:02:26] and then I want to come back to it.
[1:02:30] If you'd like to follow along, it's
[1:02:31] Genesis 13
[1:02:37] and we're going to start at the first
[1:02:39] verse.
[1:02:46] And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and
[1:02:49] his wife,
[1:02:50] and all that he had, and Lot with him.
[1:02:53] notice, and Lot with him into the south.
[1:02:57] And Abram was very rich in cattle, in
[1:03:00] silver and gold. And he went on his
[1:03:03] journeys from the south, even to Bethl,
[1:03:06] unto the place where his tent had been
[1:03:10] at the beginning between Bethl and Hi is
[1:03:14] where he had under the place of the
[1:03:16] altar which he had made there at the
[1:03:20] first. And there Abraham called on the
[1:03:24] name of the Lord. I just want to stop
[1:03:25] there. There are times
[1:03:28] in your life
[1:03:31] and listen to me especially young
[1:03:32] people. There will be times in your life
[1:03:36] that it will be very very essential.
[1:03:40] You'll come to a situation and he had
[1:03:43] just come out of Egypt and in Egypt
[1:03:45] Pharaoh almost took his his his own wife
[1:03:48] Sarai to be his wife.
[1:03:51] and Pharaoh sent him away
[1:03:56] and he had he had actually told a
[1:03:59] partial truth which in a sense is a lie.
[1:04:03] He said Sarah you're very beautiful say
[1:04:06] that you're my sister. He did it on two
[1:04:09] occasions and this was the first one.
[1:04:12] And so she went in as his sister.
[1:04:15] Pharaoh almost took her to wife and he
[1:04:17] found out he was his his his sister his
[1:04:20] wife. He said send send them away out of
[1:04:22] here. He's just left Egypt. He's had has
[1:04:25] had this now and he's just facing
[1:04:27] another dilemma and it's going to be a
[1:04:30] problem with Lot and the herdsmen and
[1:04:31] the finally separation. They've been
[1:04:33] together now for some time. And so now
[1:04:36] he goes to the altar that he built. It
[1:04:39] is very essential that a believer can
[1:04:43] have have built those markers. You young
[1:04:46] people, whatever God did for you,
[1:04:48] however God spoke to you, yet I want you
[1:04:51] to recall the time that maybe in the
[1:04:54] last few weeks you stood maybe at an
[1:04:57] altar in the tent, maybe you heard one
[1:05:00] of your counselors at the camp, or
[1:05:02] you've been in the services uh this last
[1:05:04] summer and even more recently. And while
[1:05:07] the preaching of the word is and God
[1:05:10] strikes your heart with something, you
[1:05:11] begin to you begin to see yourself. Yes,
[1:05:15] I I I can live higher. I can go further
[1:05:18] in God. Yes, I believe I can consecrate.
[1:05:22] I believe it with all my heart. I
[1:05:24] believe that I can dedicate myself. I
[1:05:27] believe I can have victory.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; I believe that I can You put a marker
[1:05:31] there.
[1:05:33] You build an altar there and say, "I
[1:05:35] thank God
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; that you have shown me this.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; I thank God you have spoken to me in
[1:05:40] such a way because what he's showing you
[1:05:43] is your territory. He's showing you your
[1:05:46] land. He's showing you what he bought at
[1:05:48] Calvary. And he's opening up your eyes
[1:05:51] so you can see something that belongs to
[1:05:53] you,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; whatever it might be."
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, there's a
[1:05:57] whole array of things here in this in
[1:05:59] this service this morning. a whole array
[1:06:01] of things. Some have to believe for
[1:06:03] family. Some have to believe for
[1:06:05] healing. Some have to believe for their
[1:06:08] own life and what God uh not knowing
[1:06:11] what tomorrow holds. Say, "Oh God, I
[1:06:14] build an altar here. I'm making a marker
[1:06:16] here. There was a moment in that service
[1:06:19] uh service a certain time. There was a
[1:06:21] certain message that I heard. There was
[1:06:23] a certain place or when I was listening
[1:06:25] to a tape, I was reading the scripture
[1:06:28] and there was a certain moment where you
[1:06:30] touched me and it seemed like the my
[1:06:32] whole vision was expanded. I begin to
[1:06:35] see something. I begin to see levels of
[1:06:37] glory. I begin to see a a level of
[1:06:40] victory and a victorious light. I begin
[1:06:42] to see power in my life. I could
[1:06:44] envision it. I could taste it. I could
[1:06:46] feel it. You build an altar there.
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You put a marker there. Why? Why,
[1:06:53] brother Briscoll, do I need to put a
[1:06:54] marker there? Because you're going to
[1:06:56] need to go back there.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to go back and
[1:07:00] recall that. And I've done that.
[1:07:04] You folks don't know it.
[1:07:07] But I p I I jumped into my pickup
[1:07:10] few years ago
[1:07:13] and I went to have a conference with God
[1:07:15] and I went alone and I drove for several
[1:07:18] hundred miles
[1:07:20] and I sat
[1:07:23] and just looked over some of the vast
[1:07:25] country.
[1:07:28] I just sat there way below me was a bit
[1:07:32] of a lake
[1:07:34] and the sun was shining. It was warm and
[1:07:36] the fall breeze was blowing and I was
[1:07:40] way down the road from the time I gave
[1:07:42] my life
[1:07:46] and this is all I I I felt like this
[1:07:48] spiritually like that piece of wood
[1:07:52] I didn't feel. Do you feel any glory?
[1:07:54] None. Zero.
[1:07:56] You hear any voices? None. Zero.
[1:08:00] Have any emotion? None. Zero.
[1:08:03] just felt like a telephone pole.
[1:08:06] But I sat on that bank
[1:08:10] and I started going back
[1:08:14] along the trail.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; And all I could say is I said back
[1:08:19] there,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; God, I know it was you.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; I know that was you. That's all I can
[1:08:28] say. I know that was you. and on down in
[1:08:31] my life and maybe some years went by and
[1:08:34] there was another special spot and I
[1:08:37] built an altar there and I went back to
[1:08:39] it and I said and I know that was you.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And I just begin to go back to one altar
[1:08:46] after another after another. Each time I
[1:08:49] said that was you. That was you. And
[1:08:51] before I got to my feet the presence of
[1:08:54] God came down
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; was with me. That's why I went several
[1:08:58] hundred miles for that very moment. I
[1:09:00] just went to have a conference with God.
[1:09:03] But if I hadn't made those spots as
[1:09:05] special markers, you could never go back
[1:09:07] to them. Abraham, your father made
[1:09:10] markers at these spots. Don't forget
[1:09:12] them. And don't let the devil take them
[1:09:15] away from you. They're very special
[1:09:17] occasions.
[1:09:19] That's where God opened up your
[1:09:20] horizons, opened up your eyes
[1:09:24] and seemed to just give you a
[1:09:26] spontaneous faith and maybe nothing
[1:09:28] happened physically, but you just said,
[1:09:30] "Yes, glory. Hallelujah."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Don't forget the time that you felt such
[1:09:36] a release that you could do things that
[1:09:38] you never thought you could do. and you
[1:09:40] raised your hands to God and gave your
[1:09:43] life and you said things that perhaps
[1:09:45] you didn't even know you could ever
[1:09:47] keep, but you said them anyway. Go back
[1:09:49] to that place.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; And we'll read on.
[1:09:58] Fourth verse says, "Unto the place of
[1:09:59] the altar which he had made there at the
[1:10:02] first. And there Abram called on the
[1:10:05] name of the Lord. And Lot also
[1:10:09] which went with Abram had flocks and
[1:10:12] herds and tents. And the land was not
[1:10:15] able to bear them that they might dwell
[1:10:18] together, for their substance was great
[1:10:21] so that they could not dwell together.
[1:10:25] And there was a strife between the
[1:10:26] herdman of Abram's cattle and the
[1:10:28] herdman of Lot's cattle. And the
[1:10:31] Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then
[1:10:35] in the land. And Abram said unto Lot,
[1:10:38] "Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
[1:10:41] between me and thee, and between my
[1:10:43] herdman and thy herdmend, for we be
[1:10:47] brethren. Is not the whole land before
[1:10:50] thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee,
[1:10:53] from me." Excuse me.
[1:10:57] If thou wil take the left hand, then I
[1:10:59] will go to the right. Or if thou wilt
[1:11:01] depart to the right, then I will go to
[1:11:03] the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes,
[1:11:06] and beheld
[1:11:09] all the plain of Jordan,
[1:11:13] that it was wellwatered everywhere
[1:11:18] before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[1:11:20] Gomorrah, even as the garden of the
[1:11:22] Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou
[1:11:25] comest unto Zor.
[1:11:28] Then Lot chose him all the plain of
[1:11:30] Jordan. And Lot journeyed east, and they
[1:11:33] separated themselves to one from the
[1:11:35] other.
[1:11:37] Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and
[1:11:40] Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain
[1:11:42] and pitched his tent towards Sodom. How
[1:11:45] tragic.
[1:11:47] He pitched his tent towards Sodom. And
[1:11:49] it wasn't long before he was in Sodom.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; But the man of Sodom, it's important,
[1:11:55] friends, how you pitch your tent.
[1:11:57] But the men of Sodom were wicked and
[1:11:59] sinners before the Lord exceedingly. And
[1:12:02] the Lord said unto Abram after that Lot
[1:12:05] was separated from him, "Lift up now
[1:12:08] thine eyes, and look from the place
[1:12:11] where thou art, northward, southward,
[1:12:16] eastward, and westward. For all the land
[1:12:19] which thou seeest, to thee will I give
[1:12:22] it, and to thy seed forever."
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abram
[1:12:33] had said
[1:12:36] to Lot, "Separate thyself." He realized
[1:12:39] they could not continue with this
[1:12:41] conflict between them. So he said, "You
[1:12:44] separate
[1:12:46] from me and go whichever just the whole
[1:12:50] land is before you." And I found it very
[1:12:52] remarkable that Abraham was prepared to
[1:12:57] the very thing that God had promised
[1:12:59] him. He just said, "Here it is. You
[1:13:01] know, whatever you choose, and I will I
[1:13:04] will you go to the right, I'll go to the
[1:13:06] left. You go to the left, I'll go to the
[1:13:08] right."
[1:13:10] Lot lifted up his eyes.
[1:13:13] He just didn't lift them quite high
[1:13:14] enough.
[1:13:18] and he saw
[1:13:20] the well-watered plains of Jordan.
[1:13:23] If he'd lifted up his eyes a little
[1:13:25] higher, he would have seen the fires
[1:13:27] hanging over Sodom.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Fire hanging yonder.
[1:13:34] today
[1:13:36] sitting here. We don't want to lift up
[1:13:39] our eyes just so high and see the
[1:13:42] economics the way it is and see my job
[1:13:45] the way it is and see the life that I
[1:13:47] can have down here and see the things
[1:13:49] that I that that this will offer me. We
[1:13:51] must not lift up we must lift our eyes
[1:13:54] just a wee bit higher and we'll see the
[1:13:56] fires of God.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; The believer, we lift up our eyes a
[1:14:02] little higher and we see the promise of
[1:14:05] God that came through Peter that the
[1:14:08] fires, the heavens will be on fire.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And the elements will melt with fervent
[1:14:13] heat. That is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; That's what the believer looks and
[1:14:21] that's what dictates the believer's
[1:14:22] movements.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That's what dictates his life.
[1:14:28] And that's what makes him a different
[1:14:30] person.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And he's different then because he's
[1:14:33] separated.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; He's separated. He cannot see things the
[1:14:37] way the world sees them. He cannot have
[1:14:39] the same kind of anticipation. Oh, we
[1:14:42] move about. We do the same things. We
[1:14:44] work at jobs. We we pay taxes. We do all
[1:14:47] the same things. But we do not have the
[1:14:50] same vision. We are entirely separated
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; by the very actions that we live.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; In uh
[1:15:04] in hearing, recognizing and acting on
[1:15:06] the word,
[1:15:08] brother Brandon said, "But the spiritual
[1:15:10] seed of the living God,
[1:15:13] though it has to be a sojourer, and we
[1:15:15] are."
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Though it has to be a rambler and we may
[1:15:21] be,
[1:15:22] he said it always causes separation. We
[1:15:26] all have experienced that. He said,
[1:15:28] "Esau didn't last very long with Jacob."
[1:15:32] As soon as Jacob obtained the birthight,
[1:15:35] praise God.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; It called for separation. As soon as he
[1:15:39] received the birthight, now if you'll
[1:15:42] notice, please that it was the blessing
[1:15:44] of God. I noticed you were just a little
[1:15:46] bit silent because your mind's probably
[1:15:47] trying to work around it and I had to
[1:15:49] think about it as well. It was the
[1:15:51] blessing of God. Their herds increased.
[1:15:55] Their cattle increased, their camels
[1:15:57] increased, and all the sheep and all the
[1:15:59] flocks all increased and there was all
[1:16:02] the blessing of God. And because of the
[1:16:04] blessing at that level,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; but the real blessing was God's promise
[1:16:10] to Abraham, not of the sheep and the
[1:16:12] cattle and so on. It was the land, the
[1:16:14] inheritance, a people, a nation. God had
[1:16:18] big plans for Abraham
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't these natural blessings or
[1:16:25] the there are lesser blessings and
[1:16:27] sometimes they get in the way but
[1:16:30] they're not to be in the way. Your
[1:16:32] blessings are are much greater much
[1:16:34] higher. Your blessings are an
[1:16:36] inheritance in the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; And those kind of blessings are in
[1:16:41] Ephesians and you don't find them so
[1:16:43] much in in Corinthians even though in
[1:16:45] Corinthians the resurrection is very
[1:16:47] very clear there.
[1:16:50] But it was those blessings that caused
[1:16:53] the separation.
[1:16:56] You know, you go back, many of you,
[1:17:00] you had to make some hard choices at
[1:17:02] some point in time, and you'll find that
[1:17:05] it was even the blessings of God that
[1:17:08] were coming to you.
[1:17:10] And uh and then but the but those are
[1:17:14] not th that's not really what God has
[1:17:16] his eyes on. Listen to me, church. God
[1:17:20] has big plans for you. Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; God has big plans for you. It's not just
[1:17:29] what you've experienced for the moment.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; It's not just the increase that you may
[1:17:33] have. It's not just the life that you
[1:17:35] have here. And thank God for it. But
[1:17:37] God, I say in the name of the Lord, has
[1:17:40] big plans for his people.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; We don't want to get buried buried down
[1:17:48] under, you know, just the cares of this
[1:17:50] life. And he said that
[1:17:54] that the birthright, Jacob had his eyes
[1:17:57] on the birthright. And the birthright
[1:17:59] happens to be big plans. The birthright
[1:18:03] is a man's right to be in the lineage of
[1:18:06] bringing forth Jesus Christ. That is a
[1:18:10] big plan.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; What what Esau was really saying is, I
[1:18:17] don't care whether I'm in the lineage at
[1:18:19] all. I really don't care if I have a
[1:18:20] part of bringing forth Christ at all.
[1:18:22] That's what he was saying. But Jacob and
[1:18:25] he didn't even he if you had asked
[1:18:27] Jacob, Jacob, explain this. Tell me
[1:18:29] what's going on inside. Tell me why you
[1:18:32] have that drive within you. Tell me why
[1:18:34] you're so different. Tell me why it's
[1:18:36] why it's just an insatiable desire that
[1:18:38] you're willing to do anything to get
[1:18:40] that birthright. He'd say, "I don't know
[1:18:42] why, but I must have it." Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; We can't explain that driving desire
[1:18:48] within us that we must go this way. We
[1:18:51] must believe what we believe because God
[1:18:53] has big plans for that believer.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And big plans it was for Jacob that he
[1:18:59] would be in the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:19:02] and one of the great fathers of the
[1:19:04] faith and become named by God himself. I
[1:19:08] am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac
[1:19:13] and the God of Jacob.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I tell you, it means something to me
[1:19:18] today. It means something to you. I'm
[1:19:20] the God of Edward Biscll. I'm the God of
[1:19:23] of of of whoever put your name in there.
[1:19:27] In other words, you're saying that is
[1:19:28] the object that this person worships.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when that God spoke to
[1:19:34] me back there, I built an altar. I made
[1:19:37] a marker there in my life and one I can
[1:19:40] go back to and I'll say no matter what
[1:19:42] kind of difficulty I'm in right now, no
[1:19:44] matter how low I feel, no matter what
[1:19:47] kind of reversal, I'll point back and
[1:19:49] say that was God that did that.
[1:19:52] That was God that set me free. That was
[1:19:55] God that delivered me. That was God that
[1:19:58] showed me a life.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I may not be in it right now, but that
[1:20:02] was God. It was you who did that.
[1:20:05] Hallelujah.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; How many here remember a certain point
[1:20:10] in God's in your life that God did
[1:20:12] something very special for you?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; I say we should give him glory and
[1:20:19] praise.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You remember when you were a slave?
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the shackles?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the feel of those
[1:20:31] shackles? You remember when you couldn't
[1:20:34] set yourself free
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; and God set you free.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And from that time, you couldn't see
[1:20:48] things like others,
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; things that seemed kind rather normal
[1:20:52] and you're just one of the people and
[1:20:53] one of the group, one of the crowd, one
[1:20:55] of the students or whatever more. But
[1:20:57] suddenly it's different.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's Christian, but when
[1:21:01] you are born of the spirit by this word,
[1:21:04] it's not the same anymore.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; We can't say we're the same. Everybody's
[1:21:09] Christian, but I'm not that kind of
[1:21:11] Christian.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; People are Christians. They can do all
[1:21:13] kinds of things, but I can't do it. You
[1:21:15] can't do it. Why? Because God spoke to
[1:21:18] you. God dealt with you. God met you.
[1:21:21] And you built an altar there. And if God
[1:21:23] speaks to you even in this service, I
[1:21:25] want you to build an altar
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; and worship
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; there
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; cuz someday you'll have to go back to
[1:21:33] it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:41] He says, "And when a man, I don't care
[1:21:44] what church you belong to, if it's
[1:21:46] cornal and your associates that you run
[1:21:49] with, the people you play cards with or
[1:21:52] your literature, societies, and so
[1:21:54] forth. When you obtain the birthight,
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; that's something that's down in your
[1:22:00] heart that's hungered for God. And when
[1:22:03] you receive that, it calls for
[1:22:05] separation.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're separated people. That
[1:22:10] thing that has hungered after God, and
[1:22:12] we obtain that birthight,
[1:22:15] it set you apart.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; It makes that individual different.
[1:22:21] Now, there's some major differences
[1:22:22] between Abraham and Lot. I'll say
[1:22:25] there's some major differences between
[1:22:28] ourselves and others.
[1:22:33] Lot did not build any altars that I know
[1:22:35] of.
[1:22:41] And you don't want to be a lot.
[1:22:45] I'm instructing you
[1:22:49] to identify those places
[1:22:53] that God did speak to you that God did
[1:23:00] meet with you
[1:23:02] in a special way. God especially when it
[1:23:05] comes that that experience comes also
[1:23:07] with a promise
[1:23:11] and the promise is not perhaps in uh in
[1:23:15] certain terminology that you can
[1:23:18] identify say well I heard certain words
[1:23:21] but it was his voice comes that you can
[1:23:25] like he said to Abraham lift up your
[1:23:27] eyes and Abraham saw land is what he saw
[1:23:31] he saw property
[1:23:33] But there was something within him said
[1:23:35] that's mine.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Even though he lived his entire life and
[1:23:39] never owned any of it, never had title
[1:23:41] to any of it. The only title he had was
[1:23:44] that God at one point in time told him
[1:23:47] it's yours.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; I have seen
[1:23:53] just for myself and that's the best way
[1:23:55] for me to talk to you. I every once in a
[1:23:59] while I get a glimpse and you do too.
[1:24:02] You get a glimpse of a life in Christ,
[1:24:07] a life that you hunger after.
[1:24:11] You get a glimpse of the kind of father,
[1:24:14] the kind of mother,
[1:24:17] the kind of minister perhaps or
[1:24:20] whatever, the kind of person and you get
[1:24:23] a glimpse of it and you see
[1:24:26] really in the word what it is that God
[1:24:30] has
[1:24:32] and you can see it's there for you. I
[1:24:35] say there you want to build an altar.
[1:24:39] You're not saying I'm there
[1:24:41] because when when Abraham built the
[1:24:44] altar, he did not own the land yet. He
[1:24:49] he did not have any evidence of
[1:24:51] possession. That's right.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; At this time when these moments come,
[1:24:57] you do not have any evidence that you're
[1:24:59] there, that you own it, that you've
[1:25:01] arrived,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; that you're that kind of man, that kind
[1:25:05] of woman, that kind of deacon or
[1:25:07] preacher or trustee or whatever more.
[1:25:09] You don't have any evidence that you are
[1:25:11] that, but you're building an altar that
[1:25:13] that God who spoke to you has given you
[1:25:17] that kind of vision.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I'm saying you said it. Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; What do we hunger for?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about your
[1:25:27] hunger for it. What are you hungering
[1:25:29] for? What are you hungering for? What
[1:25:31] are you thirsting for? It's for
[1:25:33] something more in God.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Is that not so?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; That's the thing that God chose a
[1:25:40] person. He's chosen. The thing you
[1:25:42] hunger for is yours.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; The thing you hunger for, I will give
[1:25:47] you.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; The thing you hunger for, you shall
[1:25:50] attain.
[1:25:55] And there you want to build an altar.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You want to build a structure. You want
[1:26:00] to make a monument. You want to make a
[1:26:02] special make that a special dedicated
[1:26:05] spot.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And then worship.
[1:26:09] Oh God of my fathers, you're the one
[1:26:12] that made the promise. You're the one
[1:26:15] that spoke to me there. I'll remember
[1:26:17] that place. It might be just it might
[1:26:20] even be a certain geographical place. It
[1:26:22] might be in your room. It might be in
[1:26:24] your automobile. It might be at the
[1:26:26] church. Who knows where it might be?
[1:26:28] That is irrelevant. But build a place
[1:26:32] and make a monument out of it so you can
[1:26:35] go back to it.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; We hunger for it. And that's what God
[1:26:41] shows a person.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; The world catches on to this.
[1:26:48] They tell people dream a dream,
[1:26:52] have great expectations and then pump
[1:26:55] them full of, you know, uh uh
[1:26:59] encouragement
[1:27:01] or to
[1:27:04] vitalize and energize themselves and
[1:27:07] tell them you can do it. Well, I I I I'm
[1:27:11] going to say you can't do it, but God
[1:27:14] will do it.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; God who made the promise What did he
[1:27:18] speak to you? I'm going to just ask you
[1:27:19] young people over the last few weeks and
[1:27:22] been focusing on you. What do you think
[1:27:24] God What do you think was in God's mind
[1:27:30] in the last few weeks? I just I want to
[1:27:33] ask the young people directly throughout
[1:27:35] the building wherever you are
[1:27:38] from before camp to past camp to even
[1:27:41] now. I'd say in the last two three
[1:27:43] months, how many you young people can
[1:27:45] recall
[1:27:47] that there was a very special moment, a
[1:27:50] very special service,
[1:27:53] and God touched you very deeply. You may
[1:27:56] not understand what it was, but God
[1:27:58] touched you. I'd like to see your hands
[1:28:00] as a confession.
[1:28:03] Just hold them up for a moment.
[1:28:10] All right.
[1:28:13] What you do?
[1:28:16] This is from my experience. If this be
[1:28:17] the last service I would ever speak to
[1:28:19] you, I would want you to do this.
[1:28:22] You, if you've not done so already, you
[1:28:26] build a marker.
[1:28:29] I want you to think about that very spot
[1:28:32] that God brought you to.
[1:28:34] I'd like you to go back and ponder what
[1:28:37] God what it was that God told you.
[1:28:45] What was it that he was saying to you at
[1:28:48] that time?
[1:28:53] And I can only
[1:28:57] I can only hypothetically
[1:29:00] draw conclusions.
[1:29:02] Some of you might be that you be
[1:29:04] delivered
[1:29:06] from your sinful ways,
[1:29:09] from your old life.
[1:29:12] To some of you, it might have been,
[1:29:14] you've tried this before, but this is
[1:29:16] different.
[1:29:17] It's going to be different now. You've
[1:29:19] tried it before. Didn't work. Tried it
[1:29:23] again. Try it again. Didn't work. It's
[1:29:26] And there's something within you said,
[1:29:29] "This is different.
[1:29:32] Has there been some of that?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; This is different."
[1:29:37] You build an altar there. Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And even if you have to go back a year
[1:29:41] from now, go back to that point or a
[1:29:43] month from now and say, I built an altar
[1:29:46] there and what God said to me, this will
[1:29:48] be different.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; This is not you. I'm doing it.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; To some of you, it might have been,
[1:29:59] I just want to give my life. And some of
[1:30:02] you have come forward and said that I
[1:30:04] just want to give my life.
[1:30:06] I want to give my life to the Lord. and
[1:30:08] and and your vision is just now just
[1:30:11] here for the moment, but God is looking
[1:30:13] at the big picture. And don't forget,
[1:30:16] God is seeing down the road what it is
[1:30:19] you're going to do. Whether it be a year
[1:30:22] or 10 years, I don't know how much time
[1:30:23] we have, but God looks at the big
[1:30:25] picture.
[1:30:27] Don't forget that God looks at the big
[1:30:30] picture. He sees us not only here, he
[1:30:34] sees the victorious church here. Let me
[1:30:38] tell you friends, this bride of Jesus
[1:30:41] Christ shall go out of this world in a
[1:30:44] blaze of victory.
[1:30:47] And she is victorious.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; She's absolutely victorious in Christ
[1:30:51] today.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And that is why God has to give us each
[1:30:56] one our own little vision. But remember,
[1:30:59] when you see a vision, Rich, remember it
[1:31:00] is little. It's much bigger than you can
[1:31:02] see. And God's got much bigger plans
[1:31:05] than you have for your life. He's got
[1:31:07] much bigger plans. You're affecting
[1:31:09] people. You're influencing people you
[1:31:12] didn't even dream you're having an
[1:31:13] effect on.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Lot did not build an altar
[1:31:22] as a result of any personal revelation
[1:31:25] or promise of God to him.
[1:31:28] These are major differences. Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; It seems that the promised word to
[1:31:36] Abraham,
[1:31:39] the promised word to Abraham was really
[1:31:43] it was like for uh a a phase or just for
[1:31:47] a season.
[1:31:51] One type or one kind of blessing was all
[1:31:55] that Lot could see.
[1:31:58] And you know, friends,
[1:32:00] uh, I have to just speak honestly,
[1:32:05] every once in a while within a
[1:32:06] congregation,
[1:32:08] I do find those that I counsel with or
[1:32:12] speak with, and it seems their entire
[1:32:15] conversation is wrapped up and their
[1:32:18] eyes are not quite high enough. It is
[1:32:21] just around
[1:32:24] here and where we are right now. And th
[1:32:27] that has to consume a great deal of our
[1:32:29] thought and so on. But that must not
[1:32:31] maintain or be our main objective.
[1:32:36] We are eternal beings and we will
[1:32:40] certainly discredit our own selves and
[1:32:43] live at a lower a lower level of life if
[1:32:46] we don't have our vision are focused on
[1:32:51] the eternal realm. And it's very very
[1:32:54] important and I say especially with our
[1:32:56] young people because they have so much
[1:32:58] of this life that's before them. But it
[1:33:01] is it is critical. It is vital that we
[1:33:05] live the life that we do live with a
[1:33:08] eternal focus, an eternal vision, an
[1:33:12] eternal viewpoint
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; that's dictating what we're doing here.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Not not our our job or our profession.
[1:33:21] Don't let that dictate it because Satan
[1:33:23] can use that so much to to change our
[1:33:28] course so that we're not really
[1:33:31] fulfilling what God wants us to fulfill.
[1:33:43] Just remember as we read these
[1:33:45] scriptures,
[1:33:47] Lot went the direction he went by what
[1:33:50] he could see. And Abraham went the
[1:33:53] direction he went by what he saw. What
[1:33:56] Lot saw was physical. What Abraham saw
[1:34:00] was invisible.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; We need to be directed by the invisible.
[1:34:07] When Abraham offered I have some notes I
[1:34:09] pondered over very deeply. That's why I
[1:34:11] want to say it to you specifically. When
[1:34:13] Abraham offered Lot the choice part of
[1:34:16] the land, he demonstrated his unshakable
[1:34:19] faith in the promise of God. In other
[1:34:22] words, what he was saying, you're
[1:34:23] impossible to choose. It's impossible.
[1:34:26] These were the unspoken words. It's
[1:34:28] impossible lot for you to choose what
[1:34:31] God has promised me.
[1:34:34] Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; You know, when people tell say, "Oh, we
[1:34:38] have miracles and we have healings and
[1:34:40] it happens over here and it happens over
[1:34:42] there and all the message isn't the only
[1:34:44] place this happens." That's perfectly
[1:34:46] fine. I say, "Praise God. Glad they're
[1:34:48] getting healed. Glad they're having
[1:34:49] miracles." All the rest of it. But they
[1:34:51] can never never take away
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; from the promise of my inheritance.
[1:34:57] That's not my inheritance. Not just a
[1:34:59] healing. That is a benefit that comes
[1:35:01] along with the inheritance. But my
[1:35:03] inheritance is a revelation of this word
[1:35:06] right here. That's that's my
[1:35:07] inheritance. That's your inheritance.
[1:35:10] Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And this doesn't come just with signs
[1:35:14] and wonders and feelings and emotional
[1:35:15] things. It happens to come with a divine
[1:35:19] inspiration of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And it can't come from a many, many
[1:35:24] sources. It only come from one source.
[1:35:26] If God hadn't sent a prophet, we
[1:35:27] wouldn't be seeing these things. If God
[1:35:29] hadn't sent a prophet, you and I
[1:35:30] wouldn't be friends. we wouldn't know
[1:35:32] one another. You wouldn't be sitting
[1:35:33] with one another. You wouldn't be
[1:35:35] shaking hands with one another. You
[1:35:37] wouldn't have traveled across land and
[1:35:38] across sea and and the people are
[1:35:40] gathering wherever they're gathering. It
[1:35:42] is the word itself that has gathered us
[1:35:44] together.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Lot lifted up his eyes,
[1:35:52] as I said earlier, but not high enough.
[1:35:54] He saw the well-watered plains of
[1:35:56] Jordan.
[1:35:58] Had he looked a little higher, he would
[1:35:59] have seen the fires of God hanging
[1:36:01] yonder over Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:36:04] And we need to keep our eyes fixed on
[1:36:06] the heavens that will be on fire in the
[1:36:09] elements melting with fervent heat. We
[1:36:12] do not want those things that shall melt
[1:36:14] with fervent heat to be our guide
[1:36:17] through this life or become gods before
[1:36:20] us. Our automobiles will melt with
[1:36:23] fervent heat. Our homes will melt with
[1:36:25] fervent heat. All of these physical
[1:36:28] things shall melt with fervent heat. And
[1:36:30] it is that kind of thing that dominates
[1:36:33] our thinking so that we can choose
[1:36:35] correctly. We can make the right kind of
[1:36:37] decisions. Hallelujah. And even this
[1:36:41] body of dust shall just be a teaspoon of
[1:36:43] ashes someday unless it's changed in a
[1:36:46] rapture and a body changed. And so I
[1:36:49] want to I want to by God's grace dictate
[1:36:51] the movements and dictate this life so
[1:36:54] that it will be God-honoring
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; for the purpose of God.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Abram, after that
[1:37:11] Lot was separated from him, lift up now
[1:37:14] thine eyes, and look from the place
[1:37:17] where thou art northward and southward,
[1:37:20] and eastward, and westward.
[1:37:23] Brother Brandham said he couldn't bless
[1:37:26] him until he was separated.
[1:37:28] And once Abraham separated from Lot, one
[1:37:32] whose eyes could not see the full
[1:37:35] promise.
[1:37:36] Desires were limited to earthly things.
[1:37:39] Once he was separated from him, he could
[1:37:42] only see partially. And once he was
[1:37:45] separated, then he could see more
[1:37:48] glorious things.
[1:37:50] in the midst of confusion and chaos
[1:37:54] of this age
[1:37:56] when I read and now it's something for
[1:37:59] us we just pick up a message we read say
[1:38:01] oh brother Brandham said this I'd like
[1:38:03] you to put yourself back 30 40 years ago
[1:38:05] when he said that
[1:38:09] I tell you what friends what an example
[1:38:11] we've had he was in the midst of such
[1:38:14] utter chaos
[1:38:16] he was in the midst of all kinds of
[1:38:18] supernatural things happening and big
[1:38:20] tent meetings happening and you couldn't
[1:38:23] have convinced anybody that that revival
[1:38:25] was dying dying down. I lived in it and
[1:38:28] their competition was who had the
[1:38:31] biggest tent and this tent holds 25,000
[1:38:34] and this tent now my tent holds 30,000
[1:38:37] and they did held 25,000 people tents.
[1:38:41] Ours holds about 1,500. Put 25,000
[1:38:44] people under canvas and they were going
[1:38:46] great guns and doing big things and
[1:38:49] great organization was going on. Here's
[1:38:52] a humble little prophet with a little
[1:38:54] office with a uh like a kitchen chair in
[1:38:56] it that he's sitting in. And what you
[1:38:59] and I are gathered in was coming at that
[1:39:01] time.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Coming to that kind of a place, that
[1:39:05] kind of a humble little office.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:16] But that that whole movement had to
[1:39:19] separate and it did.
[1:39:22] There are believers, unbelievers, and
[1:39:24] make believers in every gathering.
[1:39:28] And I would say if there's any here that
[1:39:29] are make believer today, move over and
[1:39:33] become a believer.
[1:39:36] make believer can have all the blessings
[1:39:38] and all the benefits and hitchhike
[1:39:40] along, but that's not what we're
[1:39:43] interested in. Get your mind off of
[1:39:45] these natural things and put them on to
[1:39:48] spiritual things
[1:39:51] and let the spiritual dictate the
[1:39:52] natural.
[1:39:59] Brother Brandham says in Watchmen, "What
[1:40:01] of the night?
[1:40:07] in 1960
[1:40:14] says, "Then I see the spiritfilled
[1:40:16] church with its sign reflecting the
[1:40:19] coming of the sun, the morning star
[1:40:22] putting off its rays. Oh, how happy I
[1:40:26] am." Can you imagine?
[1:40:29] Now, I want to put this in perspective
[1:40:31] for you, congregation. I want you to
[1:40:33] listen closely. Here's a man that has
[1:40:36] had a half a million, 300,000,
[1:40:41] tens of thousands of people, crowding
[1:40:44] auditoriums, lined up, several people
[1:40:48] across trying to get in at 3:00 in the
[1:40:51] afternoon and 2:00 or 3:00 in the
[1:40:53] afternoon in Vernon lined up waiting for
[1:40:55] the evening service. All of that has
[1:40:58] gone. Those people have all sifted away
[1:41:01] because the word started to come. The
[1:41:04] serpent seed message started to come and
[1:41:06] the godhead started to be made clear and
[1:41:09] the baptism was set out and the word was
[1:41:12] beginning to be restored. And as the
[1:41:14] word which is the inheritance,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; it's like a prophet starting to look
[1:41:19] over the entire inheritance of the land.
[1:41:22] And the people began to flock away. And
[1:41:25] he said they flocked away. He said they
[1:41:27] flocked away from Christ. And so it was
[1:41:29] Christ once again they were flocking
[1:41:31] away from. And now he's speaking to just
[1:41:34] a perhaps a handful of people.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; But he's saying, "I see a church.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; I see the rays of the son of God."
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; He's lifting his eyes
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; far above.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He's seeing you.
[1:41:58] He's seeing what's happening.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; He's seeing the rays of the glory of God
[1:42:05] shining
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; not only on a people but through a
[1:42:08] people.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He sees the word coming.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He sees the message coming.
[1:42:15] He knows the promise of God. He knows
[1:42:17] there's a third pull and he knows it's
[1:42:19] on the verge of coming cuz he sees the
[1:42:22] first one and he sees the second one and
[1:42:24] he knows the third one has to come on
[1:42:27] the scene. He's beginning to rejoice. He
[1:42:30] sees what it's going to do.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; He sees the people it's going to
[1:42:35] collect.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I wish I had a voice to proclaim it to
[1:42:43] the world. God sent a messenger
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; and he could say it. He said, "I see the
[1:42:52] morning star putting off its rays. Oh,
[1:42:55] how happy I am. I'm glad that God has a
[1:43:00] church
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; that can put off the rays.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has a church that can
[1:43:07] put off the rays.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that God has a church that can
[1:43:11] reflect the rays of the morning sun.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:20] Now I have to lay a lot of foundation.
[1:43:24] Not going to keep you long, but this is
[1:43:26] what's really on my heart. This is what
[1:43:28] I really feel to preach. You are called
[1:43:32] of God
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; to be the reflection.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And it is not by works of law. Amen.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; If you do it by law, there's no value to
[1:43:43] it whatsoever. If you do it of your own
[1:43:45] accord, there's no value to it at all.
[1:43:48] You can have your hair long. You can
[1:43:49] wear your dress right. You can have the
[1:43:52] right kind of shoes on. You men can wear
[1:43:54] the right kind of clothes. You can talk
[1:43:56] the right kind of conversation. But if
[1:43:58] you do it restricted by a law, there's
[1:44:00] no value to it. What is it? It's not
[1:44:02] law, it's life.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; That is the difference.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Not law, but life.
[1:44:10] That's thus sayaith the Lord. It's the
[1:44:12] life. If it comes by any other means
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; then it's your efforts.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Now I want to come to that in just a
[1:44:24] moment.
[1:44:26] Says Balum
[1:44:28] he failed to see the pillar of fire. He
[1:44:32] failed to see the smitten rock. He
[1:44:34] failed to see the brass serpent going
[1:44:37] before Israel for an atonement. How
[1:44:39] could a man who was a prophet fail to
[1:44:41] see it?
[1:44:43] Preachers failed to see
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; something that is so evident.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Failed to see it.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; He failed to hear the shout of the camp
[1:44:57] of the king among them. He judged them
[1:45:01] by their works.
[1:45:03] He failed to see it.
[1:45:17] Now, this is a kind of an
[1:45:20] all-encompassing
[1:45:21] quote
[1:45:25] just before I'm going to take what the
[1:45:26] next 10 minutes and conclude.
[1:45:29] He said, "The church that professes to
[1:45:31] be a Christian church will have to have
[1:45:34] the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:45:37] Christ."
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; For at the resurrection of the church,
[1:45:41] the church and his bride will come
[1:45:43] together and doveetail.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; They will dovetail.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; They will come together. They can only
[1:45:49] come together because because the church
[1:45:51] was separated,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; brought out. I did.
[1:45:55] And he says, "For at the resurrection of
[1:45:58] the church, Christ and his bride will
[1:46:00] come together and dovetail. The writings
[1:46:03] and promises of God will be made
[1:46:06] fulfilled there."
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; So it cannot come together unless the
[1:46:12] same spirit that was in Christ is in you
[1:46:16] and me. He said
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; it cannot
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:21] It cannot come together.
[1:46:25] So there cannot be a uniting
[1:46:28] unless the same spirit that was in
[1:46:30] Christ is in you and me. And then if
[1:46:33] that same spirit is in there, it'll do
[1:46:37] the same works
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; and live the same kind of a separated
[1:46:41] life
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; and do the works that he did.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; The spirit will do the works. Not and
[1:46:49] then they will do the works, nor the
[1:46:51] spirit will do the works. The life that
[1:46:54] you have received will do the works.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; So let me just bring it down to a
[1:46:59] practical way.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; I'll just bring it down real practical.
[1:47:07] Maybe you girls that are at home, your
[1:47:10] mother has taught you
[1:47:13] and and perhaps you've never been in a
[1:47:16] pair of pants. You've only been an
[1:47:18] address.
[1:47:20] You were raised that way
[1:47:23] and you've been obedient to it. You
[1:47:25] didn't mind it. That that became that
[1:47:28] became natural. It'd be very very
[1:47:30] uncomfortable for you to even put on a
[1:47:32] pair of slash. You and you look at it
[1:47:34] and you see it in the world and so on
[1:47:36] and and it seems so foreign to you and
[1:47:40] that's all wonderful.
[1:47:42] And so you just naturally do it.
[1:47:46] But that's not what I'm talking about.
[1:47:49] And people look at you and they see that
[1:47:51] you are different. You are different.
[1:47:54] But then one day
[1:47:57] you have a meeting someplace.
[1:48:00] You have you you sisters, you young
[1:48:03] ladies, one day you have a Bethl,
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; It might be here at this altar. It might
[1:48:11] be in your seat. It might be at home.
[1:48:14] But one day you have a meeting with this
[1:48:18] one that mother and dad talk about
[1:48:23] that you've heard the preacher preach
[1:48:25] about. You've seen others moved at and
[1:48:29] one day your heart has just melted and
[1:48:33] his presence comes and you're not
[1:48:36] thinking about dress. You're not
[1:48:38] thinking about you're not thinking about
[1:48:39] anything to do with that. You're not
[1:48:41] thinking about your hair. You've been
[1:48:42] brought into his presence and somehow
[1:48:45] your heart just wants to explode with
[1:48:48] love for him.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And something is taking place and oh you
[1:48:52] begin to see and he begins to talk to
[1:48:54] you begins to tell you what you are to
[1:48:56] him and and you feel his love emanating
[1:48:59] and you feel feel such a you just feel
[1:49:02] such a closeness and you just feel oh I
[1:49:06] want to live here forever.
[1:49:09] I want to live here forever.
[1:49:10] I I I don't even want to go out. I don't
[1:49:12] even want to go to school. I don't want
[1:49:14] to go to work. I just feel like it'll
[1:49:16] live here forever.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; That's where you build an altar. And
[1:49:19] right away, you want to say, "Oh, thank
[1:49:21] you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:49:23] Lord. Don't ever let this dissipate.
[1:49:25] Don't ever let this e away. But if it
[1:49:27] ever does, let me build an altar. And I
[1:49:29] thank you that you had this moment. I
[1:49:31] thank you that you met me here. I thank
[1:49:33] you that you spoke those words. I thank
[1:49:35] you that you told me I was your
[1:49:36] daughter."
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:40] Then when you stand up and walk out of
[1:49:42] there, you say, "Now I know why I dress
[1:49:45] the way I dress."
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz it pleases him.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Now I know I act the way I act. Now I
[1:49:52] know for the first time. And it is the
[1:49:55] life now that came in you that separates
[1:49:57] you.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; And a young man is brought up a certain
[1:50:03] way. or we as adults, we came under the
[1:50:07] sound of the message and we began to
[1:50:10] hear it and maybe could have lived the
[1:50:11] most upright life. Maybe he was in a
[1:50:13] church and all the rest of it. Maybe
[1:50:15] could out of a good Baptist Pentecostal
[1:50:17] church or whatever more whatever
[1:50:19] whatever brand it was is irrelevant. And
[1:50:22] you come and you hear the message and
[1:50:24] strikes your heart and maybe it isn't
[1:50:26] instantaneous, but you know it's I know
[1:50:28] that's true. I know that's true. And
[1:50:30] there's a still small voice. Maybe your
[1:50:32] mind is saying one thing.
[1:50:34] But your heart is saying something else.
[1:50:37] In your heart, there's a still small
[1:50:38] voices down there saying, "Amen." Amen.
[1:50:42] I know that's true. I know that's true.
[1:50:45] It sounds too good to be true, in fact.
[1:50:48] But I know it's true. Do you feel it
[1:50:49] calling you? Do you feel it pulling you?
[1:50:51] Yes, I do. I know it's for me. But I've
[1:50:54] got so much encumbrance. I've got so
[1:50:55] much that tying me down. I got so much
[1:50:58] so much burden and so many shackles and
[1:51:00] so many complexes and so many this. But
[1:51:03] there's something inside that's saying
[1:51:04] it's for you. It's for you. And excuse
[1:51:08] me.
[1:51:10] And and then at an appointed time, I
[1:51:13] don't know where, but you have your
[1:51:15] Bethl.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And you meet him. Say, "Oh God.
[1:51:19] Oh God,
[1:51:23] I've heard about you, but now my eye
[1:51:26] sees you.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; This is so different.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; This is so marvelous. Don't ever let it
[1:51:33] happen. Don't ever let it leave me.
[1:51:36] Don't Don't ever let me Don't ever let
[1:51:38] me get out of this presence. Even though
[1:51:40] you know that life is going to demand
[1:51:42] that you won't feel that way all the
[1:51:44] time, but you build an altar there.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; You build an altar and say, "I know that
[1:51:48] this one who I met, I couldn't see him.
[1:51:51] My eyes couldn't see him, but I know
[1:51:54] that he's real. I know he's more real."
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. Let
[1:52:02] me tell you something. Don't ever forget
[1:52:03] this young people. When that pillar of
[1:52:06] fire, who I never saw with these people
[1:52:07] say, "Did you see it with your eyes?"
[1:52:09] No. It was more real than I saw with my
[1:52:11] eyes. I'm going to say something I've
[1:52:13] never said before in my life. That
[1:52:16] pillar of fire that came between that
[1:52:18] angel of the Lord that came between
[1:52:20] Brother Brandham and I was more real
[1:52:22] than Brother Brandham himself.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Far more real.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "How? How so, brother Ed?
[1:52:31] Because it wasn't brother Bram's
[1:52:33] presence that I felt was going to usher
[1:52:34] me into another realm. Wasn't brother
[1:52:36] Bram's presence that I felt I I sat with
[1:52:38] him. It wasn't his presence that made me
[1:52:40] feel that way. But one came and I can't
[1:52:44] deny the effect it had. And I can say I
[1:52:48] thank God that he met me there in that
[1:52:51] way. And I'll never forget. I'll take it
[1:52:53] to my I'll take it to the change of my
[1:52:55] body. You can never deny that you've had
[1:52:58] experiences and you know it's true. You
[1:53:01] know it's real. You know it's him.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; You can never deny that.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; He spoke to you. The
[1:53:13] word came so clear.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; You know it was him.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; All I say today is identify that.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Just say that was you. Oh God. That was
[1:53:23] you my Lord Jesus. You spoke. You touch
[1:53:26] me.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; And now
[1:53:33] Abraham physically was separated.
[1:53:36] Physically he was in our father was
[1:53:38] physically separated. He wasn't even in
[1:53:40] Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus came, he was amongst
[1:53:44] them. He was a friend of sinners. But
[1:53:46] yet the scripture says he was separated.
[1:53:48] And that same son of God is here today
[1:53:52] in this last terrible age. He's still in
[1:53:56] this he he's come into Satan's Eden to
[1:53:59] take his bride out.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And here we are right in the midst of it
[1:54:03] mingling with them. You're amongst them,
[1:54:05] but you're separated.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; You're not separated because I'm saying
[1:54:10] so. You're separated because the life
[1:54:12] that is in you is living a separated
[1:54:15] life.
[1:54:17] You're completely separated. You're not
[1:54:19] part of the system.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not part of their
[1:54:22] religion. You're not part of their
[1:54:24] economics. And that is why I so thank
[1:54:26] the Lord that he said, "Father,
[1:54:30] I'm not in the world, but these are in
[1:54:32] the world.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; They're in the world.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; We're in the world.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; We're in their workplaces. And we have
[1:54:43] friends. We have colleagues. We have
[1:54:47] school friends or whatever more. We're
[1:54:49] in the world.
[1:54:51] But you're indeed different from the
[1:54:53] world.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; So you say now I'm coming to the close.
[1:54:59] How how brother Ed am I different? How
[1:55:02] are we different?
[1:55:04] I'll tell you. It's Jesus Christ the
[1:55:07] same yesterday, today, and forever. How
[1:55:08] was he different
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; as he moved through life?
[1:55:14] and he connected with people.
[1:55:19] Here's how he's different. A woman was
[1:55:22] rushed into his presence with men who
[1:55:24] had stones in their hand. Said, "We
[1:55:26] caught her in the very act of adultery."
[1:55:30] Actually caught her in adultery. And the
[1:55:32] word has said that she should be stoned.
[1:55:34] And what do you say?
[1:55:38] He showed that he was even greater
[1:55:43] than any of their thoughts or any of
[1:55:45] their conclusions and greater than the
[1:55:47] law because the life that was in him
[1:55:51] poured out grace to the woman.
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Said, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go and
[1:55:56] sin no more." Do you know what, friend?
[1:55:58] She had never heard such words in her
[1:56:00] life. She never heard such words in her
[1:56:02] life. She never heard a rabbi in the
[1:56:04] synagogue ever say such a thing. Neither
[1:56:06] do I condemn thee. He was separate. And
[1:56:08] you know what they said? That's
[1:56:10] different.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; I'm sure the disciples who pinned the
[1:56:14] words down said, "Wow, we've never heard
[1:56:18] that before." Why?
[1:56:20] He was in the world, but he was separate
[1:56:23] from sinners. He was separate from the
[1:56:25] unbelievers. He was separate from the
[1:56:27] lawkeepers.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He was greater than the law. He was
[1:56:31] greater. Why? Because he was the law
[1:56:33] fulfilled.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; He's greater than the law. And that's
[1:56:36] why it can't be by works. Thou shalt do
[1:56:39] this and you'll dress a certain way and
[1:56:41] you'll speak a certain way and it make
[1:56:43] you all perfect. That would be nothing
[1:56:45] but rotten filthy works.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Just rotten works cuz it's your own.
[1:56:50] It's your own energy, your own thing.
[1:56:52] But when a life is in you,
[1:56:55] hallelujah, a life is in you living it
[1:56:58] out. Says this is the way I want to be.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; This the way I want to live. There's
[1:57:03] something in me driving me.
[1:57:11] I was thinking about what is what is my
[1:57:14] own experience.
[1:57:17] There's something there's something that
[1:57:19] that eats on me. And here's what it is.
[1:57:22] I don't find it in a lot of other
[1:57:25] places. I don't even find it
[1:57:28] somehow in a lot of people that are
[1:57:30] professed to be believers.
[1:57:38] I hadn't planned on saying this. I have
[1:57:41] a message book in my hand.
[1:57:45] I have a life in me
[1:57:49] that cannot rest to think that I can
[1:57:53] hold this book and someone else can't
[1:57:55] hold it.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; I can't rest.
[1:58:00] I can't rest to think that I can look
[1:58:03] and immediately I start and my mind and
[1:58:06] my soul is fed and I begin to
[1:58:08] understand. I begin to grasp things and
[1:58:10] to know that I could put this in someone
[1:58:12] else's hand. He say, "Well, I uh it's a
[1:58:16] total mystery. I don't I don't read this
[1:58:18] language."
[1:58:20] I'd want to say right away, what
[1:58:21] language do you read?
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's missions." That
[1:58:26] is the mission.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; That's not missions. That is the
[1:58:30] mission.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; That is the call.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; And that Holy Spirit
[1:58:35] has got an insatiable thirst to bring
[1:58:38] that last elected seat in. But when that
[1:58:40] last elected one comes in, we go home
[1:58:43] according to the word. Isn't that so?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; And so the way that you live, the way
[1:58:48] that you act, the way you see things now
[1:58:51] people, it has changed. Everything's
[1:58:53] changed. That's right.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful change in my life has
[1:58:57] been wrought since Jesus came into my
[1:59:00] heart.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Is that so?
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Is that true?
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; And that's how he was. He was amongst
[1:59:06] sinners but not joined to them. We're
[1:59:09] amongst them. We're in them. We're in a
[1:59:11] sodom condition, but we're separated.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; We see things differently. We analyze
[1:59:16] them differently. Our mind is different.
[1:59:18] Our mind is clean.
[1:59:20] It's been washed by the word of God.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Things that are normal to people are
[1:59:31] very abnormal to us.
[1:59:34] I heard two men in conversation this
[1:59:37] last week
[1:59:40] and they started on the teacher strike
[1:59:43] and uh before 3 minutes had gone by the
[1:59:48] one was ranting and raving on President
[1:59:50] Bush.
[1:59:52] The other fellow was taken up for him
[1:59:53] and said, "Well, what's that mean to
[1:59:55] you? That doesn't mean anything to you.
[1:59:56] You're here." Well, he says, "I've got a
[1:59:59] master's degree and I'm in I'm I'm a
[2:00:01] retired teacher and da da da da." And
[2:00:03] they went on and on and on. I was just
[2:00:05] sitting there listening and this man
[2:00:07] with a master's degree
[2:00:11] and he was giving all of his education
[2:00:14] and for how little he worked for and he
[2:00:16] was down on this and down on the other
[2:00:18] thing. But while he's going along, he
[2:00:21] takes the Lord's name in vain.
[2:00:25] I just said, "You'd never teach my
[2:00:27] children.
[2:00:30] I'd never have you cursor
[2:00:33] and blasphemer of the name of the Lord
[2:00:35] Jesus Christ. You'd never utter the
[2:00:37] words to teach my children.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; And right then I thank God for the
[2:00:41] teachers we had here at the school.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Thank God we have people whose lips do
[2:00:46] not use cursing
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; and sitting here teaching our children
[2:00:50] at school. I say and soon as he said
[2:00:52] that I just said, you know, that's where
[2:00:54] you and I part ways.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; We're totally separated. I'm separated
[2:00:58] from that. Thank God
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; we're separated from this world. What's
[2:01:03] normal to them, what's just normal
[2:01:04] conversation them is foreign language to
[2:01:06] me.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; And their hopes, their aspirations.
[2:01:14] I see them, you know, and they're going
[2:01:17] across the parking lot and they've got
[2:01:20] their case or six of of six-pack of of
[2:01:23] their pillser beer or labats or whatever
[2:01:25] it is and going across there and oh man,
[2:01:28] they what are you going to do? Are you
[2:01:30] going to see the game tonight and you
[2:01:31] know, I mean, they're just so they're
[2:01:33] all wrapped up in their world. I just
[2:01:35] say, "Oh, thank God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; I know nothing about that world."
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; We're in another world.
[2:01:46] They haven't just lift their eyes high
[2:01:48] enough.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; But I don't condemn them.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? It's the best they'll
[2:01:56] have in this world.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; He's got his best. And while I'm sitting
[2:02:01] there looking at him or looking at her
[2:02:04] running with their best, I say, "Thank
[2:02:07] God, this is my worst."
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; And then it's not too bad. This is the
[2:02:12] worst you'll ever have. had it so bad.
[2:02:14] It has not that bad. This is the worst
[2:02:16] you'll ever have. Oh, thank God. We're
[2:02:19] separate from sinners. The son of God is
[2:02:22] still separate from sinners, but we're
[2:02:23] amongst them. We're in the midst of
[2:02:25] them, and we're here to reflect
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; the only hope of the world.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I say, God bless you as you
[2:02:34] reflect it.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:45] Praise God. Praise God. Let's stand,
[2:02:49] shall we?
[2:02:56] heard a wonderful report from brother
[2:02:59] Murphy this last week
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; and how the people over there have been
[2:03:05] so diligently
[2:03:07] working and getting the message and but
[2:03:12] they've been putting a a search uh
[2:03:15] engine to the message in Chinese
[2:03:19] and he said they've just finished it
[2:03:20] now. Can you believe that? They've
[2:03:23] developed the brothers have developed a
[2:03:25] search engine. So the brothers in China,
[2:03:28] anyone in China can search the message.
[2:03:32] I I don't know if you've ever searched
[2:03:33] it. How many here have ever searched the
[2:03:35] message? Oh my, look at all those hands.
[2:03:37] See there? And those of you that
[2:03:39] haven't, it's a wonderful wonder. It's
[2:03:41] it's just there for you, available for
[2:03:43] you. It's just a marvelous thing. And
[2:03:45] here they're so eager to hear something
[2:03:47] more about it. I thank God.
[2:03:50] Heavenly Father,
[2:03:53] I address you as our Father, my Father,
[2:03:57] which art in heaven. We say, "Hallowed
[2:04:00] be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will
[2:04:05] be done on earth as it is in heaven." We
[2:04:08] pray, oh God, you'll forgive us our
[2:04:10] trespasses as we forgive those who
[2:04:13] trespass against us. We pray, oh God,
[2:04:16] that you will work in us and through us.
[2:04:18] We ask Lord that your will will be
[2:04:20] accomplished.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; And if there be any here Lord as they
[2:04:24] heard the service this morning, I pray
[2:04:27] Father that you will impress them
[2:04:30] indelibly mark them that and and that
[2:04:33] they will be guided Lord. They will be
[2:04:35] directed to look back and to treasure
[2:04:38] those moments, those times, those
[2:04:40] seasons, those days when you drew near
[2:04:43] to them. and they'll make that a marker
[2:04:45] in their life, oh God, that they can go
[2:04:48] back to. Or perhaps someone is even here
[2:04:50] today that needs to go back, Father.
[2:04:53] Perhaps they've not felt the closeness
[2:04:55] and the nearness of your presence with
[2:04:58] them. They need to go back, oh God, and
[2:05:02] begin to begin to confess that there you
[2:05:05] spoke certain things to them. And
[2:05:08] another place you talked with them. And
[2:05:10] oh Lord, then your nearness, your
[2:05:12] presence comes close to them and the a
[2:05:16] real love relationship
[2:05:18] begins between
[2:05:20] your children, your son, your daughter,
[2:05:23] and yourself.
[2:05:25] Lord, as I was preparing in this service
[2:05:29] and I thought of
[2:05:32] the bride in the Song of Solomon
[2:05:37] and how she was searching for you
[2:05:41] says, "Have you seen my beloved?"
[2:05:45] And to all the others
[2:05:48] they could not see any such attraction.
[2:05:52] What is your beloved more than all the
[2:05:55] beloveds?
[2:05:57] And oh Lord Jesus, we say along with
[2:06:00] her, my beloved is the fairest of
[2:06:03] 10,000.
[2:06:05] There's none like you. There's none like
[2:06:08] you, Lord. Oh, we love you, Lord. If we
[2:06:11] could just have our hearts open up. And
[2:06:14] I pray you will give me a greater
[2:06:15] capacity to express my love, Lord, to
[2:06:18] you. and that you will come down near
[2:06:21] each one that is here today, Lord. And
[2:06:23] if we achieve nothing more in the
[2:06:25] service than to cause people to love you
[2:06:27] and to hunger and thirst after your
[2:06:29] presence and nearness to them, that is
[2:06:32] what we ask for, Lord.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I will feel that this service and the
[2:06:37] objective will be achieved. Lord, we can
[2:06:41] somehow inspire people to call upon you
[2:06:45] and ask you that they may draw near to
[2:06:47] you. Jesus, I pray in your name, that
[2:06:51] you will be with us throughout this
[2:06:53] afternoon and as we prepare for the
[2:06:55] service tonight and those that are going
[2:06:57] to be baptized, oh God,
[2:07:00] the Holy Spirit will overshadow the
[2:07:02] place where they're baptized. May it be
[2:07:05] a real altar building place for them in
[2:07:09] Jesus Christ's name I ask it. Amen.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:16] I want to sing 2163.
[2:07:20] Oh to be like thee. I've been
[2:07:25] trying to on it all morning. I feel it
[2:07:28] many times when I begin to hum and begin
[2:07:31] to sing a song. I won't even know why.
[2:07:33] But then when I come to church, finish
[2:07:36] the service, and then we begin to
[2:07:40] we begin to sing it, then I find the
[2:07:42] words. And I don't even know what all
[2:07:44] the words are here, but I've been on
[2:07:46] this song, and I just know that God
[2:07:48] wants us to sing. There's something
[2:07:49] there for us for you. Let let let let
[2:07:52] the inspired words minister to you.
[2:07:57] Oh to be like
[2:08:00] thee.
[2:08:02] Blessed.
[2:08:08] This is my
[2:08:13] longing and praying

[2:12:14] th
[2:12:23] with our heads bowed.
[2:12:26] We're going to sing the chorus again.
[2:12:31] And I I know that there are
[2:12:34] needs, very real needs that are here
[2:12:36] present with us.
[2:12:40] And what my heart is so moved about is I
[2:12:42] know that the need that exists right now
[2:12:47] need not exist in another five minutes.
[2:12:53] friend,
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; brother, sister.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Believe me,
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; he's present here now to meet that need
[2:13:04] and to send you out from this place.
[2:13:08] You'll be in the camp of the
[2:13:12] righteous. You'll be in the beloved
[2:13:14] children of Abraham.
[2:13:17] Don't dwell below your inheritance.
[2:13:20] Don't dwell. Don't let Satan seduce you
[2:13:24] to tell you you cannot have victory over
[2:13:27] that. I say in the name of the Lord,
[2:13:29] victory is yours.
[2:13:32] Deliverance is yours.
[2:13:35] He died to make it so
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; and he's presence himself here now.
[2:13:42] Do you have that craving?
[2:13:45] I ask, do you have that hunger? And if
[2:13:48] you're saying, "Oh yes, brother, brother
[2:13:50] Ed, I do have that hunger." Then thus
[2:13:52] sayith the Lord to you. It is your
[2:13:54] portion. You wouldn't be hungering for
[2:13:57] it if he didn't give it to want to give
[2:13:58] it to you.
[2:14:00] It is yours, my sister.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; It is yours.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; He's here now
[2:14:10] to receive you as you are. Lay yourself
[2:14:13] down. Lay yourself upon the altar.
[2:14:17] and built an altar here.
[2:14:20] May the Lord that met Abraham and spoke
[2:14:23] to him.
[2:14:28] I believe he's here to speak to you. I
[2:14:29] know that he is. I know that he is. I
[2:14:32] feel such an urgency within me.
[2:14:35] Oh God. Oh God. Don't let the enemy take
[2:14:39] rob the people of that victory. Don't
[2:14:41] let the enemy rob them. Oh God, don't
[2:14:43] let that son or daughter be bound any
[2:14:46] longer. Don't let them go out of this
[2:14:47] place bound when you are you've come
[2:14:49] here in a special way to notify them and
[2:14:52] to let them know
[2:14:54] it is not your will. They shall continue
[2:14:57] on where they are.
[2:14:59] [Music]
[2:15:01] Oh to be like
[2:15:06] thee.
[2:15:09] Oh,
[2:15:10] you are
[2:15:16] blessed.
[2:15:17] [Music]
[2:15:28] Here's your invitation. Come.
[2:15:32] Come, oh Lord.
[2:15:34] Come in all of your beauty and your
[2:15:35] power.
[2:15:38] Come on.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Come to that one Lord.
[2:15:46] [Music]
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, Holy Spirit, it is said of you that
[2:15:59] you'll bring to remembrance. You'll
[2:16:02] bring all things to our remembrance.
[2:16:04] Lord, I'm asking that you'll come now.
[2:16:07] Take charge of the thoughts and minds of
[2:16:10] various individuals, oh God, who are on
[2:16:13] the very heart of God at this moment.
[2:16:15] They're on your heart, Lord. And you're
[2:16:18] wooing them. You're even speaking to
[2:16:20] them at this very moment. And you're
[2:16:22] calling them, "Come, my son. Come out of
[2:16:25] that. Come out of that life of defeat.
[2:16:28] Come out of that place. For I am calling
[2:16:30] you, Lord Jesus. Let them know that you
[2:16:33] are calling them. And I pray you'll
[2:16:35] bring to remembrance those times of
[2:16:38] great and glorious victory in their
[2:16:40] lives. And even when Satan tries to lie
[2:16:43] and say that it wasn't a reality, we
[2:16:46] deny that. We say it is a reality. Oh
[2:16:50] God, who can bring uh a clean thing out
[2:16:53] of an unclean? Only God. Who can bring
[2:16:56] these things? Who can bring this church?
[2:16:58] Who can bring a bride out of the labor
[2:17:00] to see an age? Only you, Lord Jesus.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we give you praise and glory for
[2:17:05] your might is glorious. Your power is
[2:17:08] perfect.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father, that Satan, who's
[2:17:14] seeking to hold his ground, will lose it
[2:17:16] at this moment. I pray that you will
[2:17:19] uproot him. I pray that you'll cast him
[2:17:22] out and that you will send him, oh God,
[2:17:25] far from the lives of those that you
[2:17:28] have come to deliver today.
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:32] We believe it, Lord. We believe it. We
[2:17:35] strive for. That's what we preach for.
[2:17:38] That's what we pray for. That's what we
[2:17:41] sing for. That's what we're here for. Oh
[2:17:44] God, that men and women come into the
[2:17:46] house of deliverance,
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; that they will not depart the way they
[2:17:51] came.
[2:17:53] I pray that your somnity of your holy
[2:17:57] presence and nearness will be with each
[2:18:00] one, Lord. And as we depart this place,
[2:18:04] you will go with us each one as we
[2:18:08] fellowship, as we refresh and become
[2:18:11] refreshed and come to see what you will
[2:18:14] speak to us this evening.
[2:18:17] Send us Lord with your
[2:18:20] rich, rich blessings in the name of
[2:18:23] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. We dismiss you
[2:18:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:18:32] God send you from here with his presence
[2:18:35] as we've felt this morning. Take it with
[2:18:38] your friends. Claim it as your own.
[2:18:41] Build your altars. Amen. God bless you.
[2:18:45] You're dismissed. Bless you, brother.
[2:18:50] [Music]
[2:19:00] [Music]
[2:19:20] Amen.
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:40] You're looking
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:20:35] Heat. Heat.
