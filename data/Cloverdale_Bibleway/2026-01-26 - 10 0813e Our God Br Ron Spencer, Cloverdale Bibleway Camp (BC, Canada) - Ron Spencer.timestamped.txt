[14:08] tell him he's worthy tonight, saints.
[14:10] Hallelujah. Let's start with the first
[14:12] verse. Oh, hear the cries
[14:16] of the shackle.
[14:19] From the onset
[14:22] of time.
[14:24] From the chains
[14:26] of defeat, there's no key.
[14:34] See the tears
[14:36] of the broken,
[14:39] the cries
[14:41] of the slave.
[14:44] Is there no one
[14:47] worthy to set us free?
[14:52] This is our verse when the crying
[14:56] is still
[14:58] as the chorus
[15:01] rings out.
[15:03] Oh, the shackle
[15:06] released from their chain.
[15:13] Oh, when thousands
[15:16] of voices
[15:18] were
[15:20] the song

[16:16] the saints of
[16:19] all time.
[16:21] They're holding
[16:24] their crowns in there.
[16:30] Oh, they fall down
[16:33] before him
[16:36] joining

[21:15] God.
[21:17] Lord, we thank you that we are a part of
[21:19] your predestinated plan. Oh God, as we
[21:21] heard last night, Lord, how she was the
[21:23] one that was predestinated to wash his
[21:25] feet, oh God, and we have been
[21:27] predestinated in this service, oh God,
[21:29] that we would be here, Lord, to pour our
[21:31] praises upon you, oh God. Lord, we don't
[21:34] want to be silent tonight. We want to
[21:36] tell you that you're worthy, Lord. We
[21:38] want to tell you that we love you, oh

[21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We want to open the service
[21:57] in a word of prayer. Ask our brother
[21:59] Daniel Floren if you would just come and
[22:00] open the service for us. Have one prayer
[22:02] request for our sister Cindy Vineyard.
[22:04] She's still in the hospital. Want to
[22:06] pray that the Lord will continue to give
[22:07] her strength and restore her lungs. The
[22:10] family wants to thank the saints for
[22:11] their prayer. We want to believe that
[22:13] God's going to raise up our sister
[22:14] Cindy. We we don't just bring these
[22:16] requests here because we just want the
[22:19] people to hear about them. We expect God
[22:21] to move. We want to see him move on the
[22:23] scene. So, let's pray for Sister Cindy
[22:25] tonight. If you have a request, just
[22:26] want to raise your hand and let it be
[22:28] made known. Brother Daniel, would you
[22:29] come just open the service for us? God
[22:30] bless you.
[22:38] Let's bow our heads.
[22:40] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just we come
[22:42] to you now, Lord.
[22:44] trying to quieten our spirits, Lord, and
[22:46] try to feel your presence, Lord. And
[22:48] &gt;&gt; let your spirit wash over us, oh God,
[22:51] and we want to submit ourselves to you,
[22:53] Lord, and let you have your way, Father.
[22:56] Your perfect will and your way in our
[22:57] lives in this service, Lord. Oh God, we
[23:00] open up our hearts, Lord. We open up our
[23:02] souls, Lord. Whatever you would have for
[23:04] us, Lord, we are here to hear from you,
[23:06] Lord. We are here to receive from you,
[23:08] Father. We heard it today, Lord. We
[23:10] don't want to just let it go into our
[23:12] our our mind, our body, our spirit. We
[23:14] want it to touch that inner man, Father.
[23:16] We want it to burn deep within us, Lord,
[23:18] deep inside, oh God. We want we want you
[23:20] to be in the core of our being, oh God,
[23:23] to be the foundation of our being, Lord.
[23:25] And to let you have your way in our
[23:27] lives, Father, so that you might be
[23:29] reflected from our lives, Lord. So that
[23:31] we might be our your sons and daughters,
[23:32] Lord. Not just be hearers of your word,
[23:35] but be doers of your word, oh God. We
[23:38] pray now, Lord, for those that have been
[23:40] sick this camp. Lord, we just ask you,
[23:42] oh God, that we let your spirit wash
[23:44] over them, Father. Touch them in a
[23:46] special way, oh God. Heal their bodies,
[23:48] Lord. Whatever them problem may be, Lord
[23:50] Jesus, you are more than able, Lord. You
[23:52] are the conqueror, oh God. Oh Jesus,
[23:55] many years ago, oh God, you came down.
[23:57] You stole the keys from Satan. You You
[23:59] defeated death. You defeated hell. You
[24:01] defeated sickness, Lord. You died on the
[24:03] cross for our sins, Lord. Sickness is an
[24:05] attribute of sin, Lord. We we we we WE
[24:08] BIND IT IN your name, Jesus. You have
[24:10] given us the power, oh God, to speak, oh
[24:13] God, to claim it, claim our brothers and
[24:15] sisters, oh God. We just we pray for
[24:17] them, Lord. We pray, Lord, that you
[24:19] would just raise them up even now, Lord.
[24:21] Let them feel a touch from you, feel
[24:23] your spirit wash over them, Lord, that
[24:26] they might get something out of the
[24:27] service, Lord. That they might be
[24:28] touched by you, oh God.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Father, we ask for brother Ron as he
[24:34] comes and speaks, oh God.
[24:36] Jesus,

[24:39] Father. You have spoken to us last
[24:41] night, Lord.

[24:44] Jesus.

[24:46] coming more, Lord. More and more, Lord
[24:48] Jesus. We are here to hear from you,

[24:57] sacred desk. Oh God, anoint the spirit
[25:00] behind him, Lord Jesus. Let your spirit
[25:02] come through. Let his spirit be in unity
[25:04] with your spirit, oh God.

[25:09] oracle of God. Lord,

[25:18] Lord. We just ask, Lord, that you would
[25:19] purge our minds, Lord Jesus. Purge our
[25:22] hearts, Lord Jesus. Let us be new, Lord
[25:25] Jesus, sitting in your presence with a
[25:27] new birth, Lord. a fresh understanding

[26:37] Thank you, Father.
[26:39] Amen. We're going to prepare to take an

[26:44] Maybe just before we do that, why don't
[26:46] we sing He's already provided
[26:49] everything we need. He's already
[26:50] provided. So, the brothers will prepare
[26:52] for that. He's already
[26:58] proided.

[28:46] &gt;&gt; He's already provided.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; And how much has he provided? I was
[28:50] standing thinking while we were singing
[28:53] and the prophet of God said, "If you
[28:56] hunger for more,
[28:58] it's because there is more."
[29:01] &gt;&gt; So, do you hunger for more?
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Had a wonderful time last evening. We've
[29:06] had wonderful times in previous camps as
[29:09] well. And there's been those times when
[29:11] it just you seem to get so full you
[29:14] could just burst open. But do you hunger
[29:17] for more? Amen.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; There is more
[29:21] &gt;&gt; for you.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; And we have uh whatever needs we may
[29:28] have or whatever burdens or concerns we
[29:31] may have or whatever prayers we have
[29:33] prayed,
[29:35] he has heard them.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; He's a living God. He has ears to hear,
[29:40] eyes to see, and a mouth to speak.
[29:42] Tonight, we expect him to speak through
[29:46] these lips of our brother Ron Spencer.
[29:49] As I said last night, and I will not
[29:52] fail to give thanks to God, I thank God
[29:55] when he spares a man, then we know that
[29:58] there's a purpose for that man. And he
[30:01] spared you and there's a purpose in your
[30:03] life.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, I was just reading
[30:08] before the service, uh, the words of our
[30:11] Lord Jesus,
[30:13] and he said, "I am the good shepherd
[30:16] and,
[30:18] uh, know my sheep
[30:20] and am known of mine. And as the Father
[30:24] knoweth me, even so know I the Father.
[30:28] And I lay down my life for the sheep.
[30:32] And other sheep I have
[30:36] which are not of this fold.
[30:40] Them also I must bring,
[30:44] and they shall hear my voice.
[30:48] Oh, I'm glad. I'm glad he spoke and I'm
[30:51] glad we heard his voice.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; We don't know how to be thankful to the
[30:58] degree we should be. When Jesus said,
[31:01] "Ears they have, but they hear not."
[31:05] &gt;&gt; But there were others that have ears and
[31:08] they hear.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are your ears.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes."
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Blessed are your ears and
[31:16] eyes." You'll hear something tonight.
[31:19] And I trust you will see something
[31:20] tonight. And then he said, "Them also
[31:24] must I bring. They shall hear my voice.
[31:28] And there shall be
[31:31] onefold
[31:33] and one shepherd."
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; And I've been very
[31:38] mindful of that thought. You know,
[31:40] there's only one marriage table.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; There's only one marriage supper table.
[31:46] And we're all going to be at that table.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; There's only one shepherd.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; There's only one fold.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Praise him.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; Those are the unfailing words of
[32:05] promise.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; And the Apostle Paul said, "And you are
[32:09] one bread."
[32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Tonight we're going to receive an
[32:14] offering.
[32:16] And now the water of life is free, but
[32:20] sometimes the pipes need some repair and
[32:23] upkeep. And don't they, brother Ron?
[32:29] The delivery system sometimes needs to
[32:32] be cared for. And uh so this tent and
[32:36] the campgrounds and the chairs and
[32:39] everything else is just part of the
[32:41] delivery system.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; The water that you'll receive and every
[32:44] spiritual blessing is absolutely free.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; So we're going to give tonight liberally
[32:49] and and uh for these servants of God
[32:52] that uh deliver the word. And so uh
[32:56] we're going to ask the Lord to bless the
[32:57] offering. I wonder if the brethren will
[32:59] come forward and and we'll we'll we'll
[33:02] just have a word of prayer.
[33:05] It's a pleasure to give.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; I was disappointed last night because I
[33:09] had my offering in my hand, but they and
[33:12] I couldn't get their eye for nothing. I
[33:15] couldn't even get it for $20.
[33:19] So, I want to get
[33:22] I'm looking at you, Brother Glenn. So
[33:24] you'll come up this way and let us give
[33:26] our offering. Let's bow our heads.
[33:29] Heavenly Father, what a grand privilege
[33:32] it is to be assembled here with people
[33:36] of like precious faith. How we love you
[33:39] and we've entered into worship as
[33:40] brother Ryan has led us in worship,
[33:42] Lord. And your uh smile of approval, I
[33:46] believe, will be upon this service. And
[33:49] you already have spoken to your servant.
[33:51] You have already given him certain
[33:53] words. You have given him certain
[33:55] thoughts. May they come with such
[33:57] clarity and such power, oh God. And I
[34:01] pray, Father, that each person that's
[34:03] ordained to this service tonight will be
[34:05] sitting here and the enemy perhaps has
[34:08] tried to rob some that have that have uh
[34:11] gotten some bug and got some sickness. I
[34:13] pray that you'll raise them up, Lord,
[34:15] and bring them into this tent, Father,
[34:17] and let them hear the word OF GOD IN THE
[34:20] NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. THE AIR AND the
[34:23] very atmosphere is FILLED WITH HEALING
[34:25] FOR GOD. YOU are the healer and you are
[34:28] you fill all time and space. You're here
[34:31] tonight, Lord, to do the supernatural
[34:34] far above our expectation. Bless the
[34:36] offering. Bless the giving, I pray, and
[34:39] the givers in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[34:42] Amen.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And everybody said, "Amen."
[34:45] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you give the offering.
[34:47] And our brother
[34:52] &gt;&gt; because he lives.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Because He lives. This
[35:02] is one of the first songs I learned as a
[35:03] young person of the message, 5 years
[35:05] old. Means more to me today than it did
[35:08] then, than it ever has. Because he
[35:10] lives, I can face tomorrow. Amen. So
[35:12] let's sing it together.
[35:14] Because he lives,
[35:20] oh, I can face tomorrow.
[35:36] Heat. Heat.
[35:47] And I
[35:53] love
[36:04] I
[36:15] hearing
[36:21] I know. Yes. I
[36:25] behold my
[36:28] true
[36:31] and I
[36:36] become
[36:44] prepare to sing special for us just as
[36:46] Andrew comes because
[36:49] He
[36:53] might be
[36:55] all
[37:10] I know. Yes, I know. Behold my future
[37:20] and life is worth the living
[37:26] because he
[38:05] Holy Father,
[38:09] love me still.
[38:13] I have fallen
[38:16] from your will.
[38:20] I am broken.
[38:24] Hear my humble
[38:27] cry.
[38:29] My cry.
[38:34] Take my life and make it yours. Lord,
[38:42] fill me with your love.
[38:48] You are all I need.
[38:54] I surrender
[38:57] all
[38:59] of me.
[39:04] I have wondered
[39:08] for so long.
[39:11] Tired and weery
[39:15] on my own.
[39:18] In your arms I
[39:22] know I'm home. Oh God,
[39:27] my God,
[39:31] take my life and make it yours. Lord,
[39:39] fill me with your love.
[39:45] You are all I need.
[39:51] I surrender
[39:54] all of me.
[40:00] Take my life and make it yours, Lord.
[40:08] Fill me with your love.
[40:14] You are all I need.
[40:20] I surrender.
[40:24] I surrender.
[40:28] I
[40:29] surrender.
[40:33] Oh,
[40:36] love me.
[41:01] We're not going to delay the service
[41:02] anymore. We've come here to hear the
[41:03] word
[41:05] &gt;&gt; and our brother Ron Spencer has come
[41:06] here to speak the word.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; So now with open hearts
[41:10] Can we all agree?
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Right. From one side of the tent to the
[41:14] other, we're here to hear God's word.
[41:16] Come, brother Long. Preach the word of
[41:18] God to us.
[41:24] God bless you, brother Ed.
[41:28] Amen. Amen. Let's stand to our feet this
[41:31] afternoon.
[41:36] What a wonderful time we've had already
[41:37] today.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:39] Amen. Have you had a good time today?
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful service this
[41:44] morning. Brother Tim just delivered a
[41:47] masterpiece this morning. And uh I I
[41:50] tell you what, if that didn't touch your
[41:53] heart, nothing will. It addresses the
[41:55] battles of our lives and what we go
[41:57] through and what we have great need of.
[42:00] and and I I just have enjoyed being with
[42:03] you as a as a group today and shaking
[42:06] your hands and spending some time with
[42:08] you and each and every one. And we love
[42:11] you with all of our hearts. How many's
[42:13] come under expectation to
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to speak to my heart,
[42:19] &gt;&gt; my heart personally. I want you to come
[42:21] come to where I'm at. Amen. Let's pray.
[42:24] Lord Jesus, we love you with all of our
[42:26] hearts this evening.
[42:30] Lord, as we step to our positions, we're
[42:32] very much aware that angels have been
[42:35] dispatched.
[42:38] This meeting was predestinated before
[42:40] the foundation of the world.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Why? The very ground here was
[42:44] pre-arranged.
[42:47] When men were marking it out, they
[42:49] didn't know that they were marking it
[42:51] out for a future job
[42:54] to save this place that your children
[42:57] could come and gather.
[43:01] Oh Lord, we ask you just now that you
[43:03] would drive back every enemy
[43:06] &gt;&gt; that would try to distract our minds,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; that would try to attack our bodies.
[43:12] We ask you that you would just come and
[43:14] anoint lips of clay one more time.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would use the term give
[43:19] us a temporary resurrection.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Oh God, may you come and borrow our
[43:24] bodies tonight. Anoint our minds, anoint
[43:28] our hearts, not only the man in the pull
[43:30] pit, but even to the back of this tent.
[43:33] Father, Lord, to those that will hear
[43:35] these services later, I pray that you
[43:38] would just come and speak to our hearts.
[43:41] you know where these words are ordained
[43:43] to go and I pray that you would just
[43:46] gather us just now and we give you all
[43:49] the glory and the praise in Jesus
[43:51] Christ's name. Amen and amen. Amen. He's
[43:54] good to us, isn't he?
[43:56] &gt;&gt; If you will turn with me to Exodus
[43:58] chapter 3 and then we will go to
[44:00] Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[44:05] I would like to speak this afternoon on
[44:08] our God.
[44:10] Our God.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Exodus chapter 3 and 1. Very familiar
[44:17] portions of scripture.
[44:26] Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro, his
[44:29] father-in-law,
[44:31] the priest of Midian, and he led the
[44:34] flock to the backside of the desert, and
[44:37] came to the mountain of God, even to
[44:39] Horeb. And the angel of the Lord
[44:42] appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
[44:44] of the midst of a bush. And he looked,
[44:48] and behold, the bush burned with fire,
[44:52] and the bush was not consumed.
[44:55] And Moses said, "I will now turn aside
[44:59] and see this great sight,
[45:02] why the bush is not burnt." And when the
[45:05] Lord saw that he turned aside to see,
[45:09] God called unto him out of the midst of
[45:12] the bush, and said, "Moses,
[45:15] Moses." And he said, "Here am I."
[45:18] And he said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put
[45:21] off thy shoes from off thy feet. For the
[45:24] place whereon thou standest is holy
[45:26] ground. Moreover, he said, I am the God
[45:30] of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
[45:34] God of Isaac, God of Jacob. And Moses
[45:38] hid his face, for he was afraid to look
[45:42] upon God. Deuteronomy chapter 6, if you
[45:45] can turn there with me,
[45:49] verse one. Now these are the
[45:51] commandments, the statutes, and the
[45:53] judgments which the Lord your God
[45:57] commanded to teach you, that ye might do
[46:00] them in the land whether ye go to
[46:03] possess it,
[46:05] that thou mightest fear the Lord thy
[46:08] God, to keep all his statutes, and his
[46:10] commandments, which I command thee, thou
[46:13] and thy son, and thy son's sons, all the
[46:17] day of thy life, and the thy days may be
[46:21] prolonged.
[46:23] Hear therefore, oh Israel, observe to do
[46:25] it, that it may be well with thee, that
[46:27] thou may that that ye may increase
[46:30] mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers
[46:33] hath promised thee in the land that
[46:36] flowth with milk and honey. Here, oh
[46:39] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Now notice these statements. And thou
[46:46] shalt love the Lord thy God with all
[46:49] thine heart, with all thy soul, with all
[46:54] thy might. And these words which I
[46:57] commanded thee this day shall be in
[46:59] thine heart. And thou shalt teach them
[47:02] diligently unto thy children, and shall
[47:04] talk of them when thou sitest in thine
[47:06] house, and when thou walst by the way,
[47:09] and when thy liest down, and when thou
[47:11] risethest up, and thou shalt bind them
[47:14] for a sign upon thy hand. And they shall
[47:16] be as frontlets between thine eyes. And
[47:19] thou shalt write them upon the post of
[47:22] thy house, and upon thy gates. And it
[47:24] shall be when the Lord thy God shall
[47:27] have brought thee into the land which he
[47:29] swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
[47:33] Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great
[47:37] and goodly cities, which thou buildest
[47:39] not. Yeah.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; And houses full of all GOOD THINGS WHICH
[47:45] THOU FLEST NOT,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; AND WELLS DIGS, WHICH THOU DIGEST NOT,
[47:50] and vineyards, and olive trees, which
[47:52] thou plantest not, and when thou shalt
[47:55] have eaten, and be full,
[47:57] &gt;&gt; notice this next statement. Then beware,
[48:00] lest thou forget the Lord,
[48:03] &gt;&gt; which brought thee forth out of the land
[48:05] of Egypt from the house of bondage.
[48:08] Amen. You can be seated.
[48:15] Hallelujah.
[48:19] Our God.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[48:27] Notice how that he made quite
[48:31] incredible precedents to make sure that
[48:33] they knew him as a very personal God.
[48:38] He was God to Abraham.
[48:41] He was God to Isaac. He was God to
[48:44] Jacob. He's now God to Moses. He's God
[48:47] to the fathers. He's God to the son and
[48:50] the son's son and to the son's son.
[48:53] Notice how he says it. Teach this
[48:56] diligently.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Teach this diligently.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Diligently to thy children. Notice how
[49:06] HE SAYS THIS.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; TALK of them when thou sitest in thine
[49:10] house. When thou walkest by the way, and
[49:13] when thy liest down, and when thy riseth
[49:15] up. Now notice these statements. Now,
[49:18] and it shall be that thy God shall have
[49:21] brought thee into the land which he
[49:22] swear unto thy fathers to Abraham and to
[49:24] Isaac and Jacob, and to give thee great
[49:27] and goodly cities, which thou buildest
[49:29] not. Notice God is letting them know,
[49:32] I'm the one that did this for you. Are
[49:35] you with me?
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Now notice in Deuteronomy 6 and 20. And
[49:39] he said, "When thy son askketh thee in
[49:41] time to come, saying, "What meanth the
[49:44] testimonies and the statutes and the
[49:47] judgments which the Lord our God hath
[49:49] commanded you? THEN SHALT THOU SAY UNTO
[49:52] THY SON, WE WERE in Pharaoh's bondman in
[49:56] Egypt. And the LORD BROUGHT US OUT of
[49:58] Egypt with a mighty hand. And the Lord
[50:01] showed signs and wonders and great and
[50:04] soar upon Egypt and upon Pharaoh AND
[50:07] UPON ALL OF HIS HOUSEHOLD before our
[50:11] eyes. Deuteronomy 7 and verse one. And
[50:14] when the Lord thy God shall bring thee
[50:17] into thy land, whether thou goest to
[50:18] possess it, AND HAS CAST OUT MANY
[50:20] NATIONS before thee, the Hitites, the
[50:23] Geresites, the Amorites, the Canaanites,
[50:26] the Persites, the Hivites, the
[50:29] Jebusites,
[50:31] SEVEN NATIONS GREATER AND MIGHTIER than
[50:34] thou. Brother Ram said, these were
[50:37] squatters.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; THESE WERE SQUATTERS IN THE LAND. THEY
[50:43] DIDN'T own the land. It wasn't their
[50:45] land. AND JUST BECAUSE Israel showed up
[50:48] and the people OF GOD SHOWED UP DIDN'T
[50:50] MEAN THEY JUST THREW UP THEIR HANDS AND
[50:52] QUIT AND WENT HOME.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SENT HORNETS BEFORE THE CHILDREN
[50:57] of Israel.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THEM COURAGE TO TAKE THE LAND.
[51:02] NOTICE WHAT HE SAID. I GIVE IT TO YOU.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And when the Lord thy
[51:09] God shall deliver them before thee, and
[51:11] thou shalt smite them, and utterly
[51:12] destroy them, thou shalt make no
[51:14] covenant with them, nor show mercy unto
[51:16] them, neither shalt thy marriages among
[51:18] them, with them. Thy daughter thou shalt
[51:21] not give unto a son, and daughter the
[51:23] daughter, and to take unto the son, and
[51:25] they will turn aside thy son following
[51:28] me, and and serve other gods. So will
[51:30] the anger of the Lord be kindled against
[51:32] you, and destroy THEE SUDDENLY. BUT THUS
[51:35] SHALL YOU DEAL WITH THEM, and you shall
[51:36] destroy their altars, break down their
[51:38] images, cut their groves, burn their
[51:41] graven images WITH FIRE. FOR THOU ART A
[51:44] HOLY PEOPLE UNTO the Lord thy God. THE
[51:47] LORD THY GOD HATH CHOSEN THEE TO BE A
[51:50] SPECIAL PEOPLE UNTO HIMSELF.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS ISRAEL. BUT REMEMBER,
[51:56] THEY'RE ONLY A TYPE.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE UNTO GOD.
[52:02] GOD CHOSE YOU
[52:04] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; GOD PREDESTINATED YOU BEFORE THE
[52:08] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. GOD ORDAINED
[52:11] YOU. HE ELECTED YOU.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A SPECIAL PEOPLE.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Above all the people that are upon the
[52:22] face of the earth. ABOVE ALL THE PEOPLE
[52:25] THAT ARE UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
[52:28] THE NEXT TIME THE ENEMY TELLS YOU YOU'RE
[52:30] NOTHING, TAKE HIM TO THE SCRIPTURE.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; I want you to get it. And the Lord did
[52:38] not set his love upon you, nor choose
[52:40] you because you were more in number than
[52:43] any people. FOR YE WERE FEWEST OF ALL
[52:46] THE PEOPLE, BUT BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED
[52:49] YOU.
[52:51] AMEN.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED YOU,
[52:54] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE WOULD KEEP THE OATH WHICH
[52:57] HE HAD SWORE UNTO YOUR FATHERS, HATH THE
[53:00] LORD BROUGHT YOU OUT WITH A mighty hand,
[53:03] and redeemed you out of THE HOUSE OF THE
[53:05] BONDMAN, FROM THE HAND OF PHARAOH, KING
[53:08] OF EGYPT.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; OH, don't you love the Lord this
[53:11] evening?
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us?
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Chapter four. And just just just kind of
[53:18] going back before your eyes have seen
[53:20] what the Lord did because of Balpr.
[53:23] Notice what he says. He said HE'S SEEN
[53:26] THIS. TAKE heed unto thyself. Verse 9.
[53:29] Keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
[53:31] forget the things which thine eyes have
[53:33] seen, and lest THEY DEPART FROM THY
[53:35] HEART ALL THE DAYS OF THY LIFE, BUT
[53:38] TEACH THEM TO THY SONS AND THY SONS,
[53:40] ESPECIALLY THE DAY THAT the Lord that
[53:43] thou stoodest before the Lord THY GOD IN
[53:46] HOREB, WHEN THE LORD SAID UNTO ME,
[53:48] GATHER me people together, AND I WILL
[53:51] MAKE THEM HEAR MY WORDS, THAT THEY MAY
[53:53] LEARN TO FEAR ME ALL THE DAYS THAT they
[53:56] shall live upon the earth, and they that
[53:58] shall shall teach their children. Are
[54:00] you with me now? Deuteronomy 11:18. Just
[54:03] forgive me for just taking just a few
[54:04] moments. THEREFORE SHALL YOU LAY UP
[54:06] THESE words in your heart and in YOUR
[54:09] SOUL, AND BIND THEM FOR A SIGN upon your
[54:11] hand, that they MAY BE AS FRONTLETS
[54:14] BETWEEN YOUR EYES, AND YE SHALL TEACH
[54:16] them to your children, speaking unto
[54:18] them when thou sitest in thine house,
[54:20] AND WHEN THY WALEST BY THE WAY. SIMPLY
[54:22] PUT, TESTIFY OF IT EVERY HOUR, EVERY
[54:25] DAY.
[54:28] DON'T FORGET THAT GOD DID THIS FOR YOU.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T DO IT. YOU DIDN'T BUILD THIS
[54:34] LAND.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T PLANT THESE VINEYARDS.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; I gave them to you.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1 John chapter 1. That which
[54:45] was from the beginning, which we have
[54:47] heard,
[54:49] &gt;&gt; which we have seen with our eyes,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; which we have looked upon, our hands
[54:54] have handled of the word of life. Are
[54:57] you with me? FOR THE LIFE WAS
[54:58] MANIFESTED, AND WE HAVE SEEN IT.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SEEN IT AND BEAR WITNESS AND
[55:05] SHOW UNTO YOU THAT ETERNAL LIFE WHICH
[55:09] WAS WITH THE FATHER AND WAS MANIFESTED
[55:12] unto us. Notice the scripture. JOHN 15
[55:14] AND VERSE ONE. I AM THE TRUE VINE,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; AND MY FATHER IS THE HUSBAND. Every
[55:21] branch IN ME THAT BEARETH NOT FRUIT, HE
[55:23] TAKETH AWAY, and every branch which
[55:25] beareth fruit, he purgeth it, THAT IT
[55:27] MAY BRING FORTH MORE FRUIT. NOW YE ARE
[55:30] CLEAN through the WORD WHICH I HAVE
[55:31] SPOKEN UNTO YOU. ABIDE IN ME, AND I in
[55:34] you.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; That's the branch cannot BEAR FRUIT OF
[55:36] ITSELF EXCEPT IT ABIDE IN THE VINE. NO
[55:39] MORE CAN YE EXCEPT YOU ABIDE IN ME. I AM
[55:42] THE VINE. NOTICE THESE STATEMENTS. I AM
[55:44] THE VINE AND ye are the branches. AND HE
[55:48] THAT ABIDETH IN ME AND I IN HIM THE SEED
[55:50] BRINGETH FORTH MUCH FRUIT. FOR WITHOUT
[55:53] ME you can do nothing.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham speaks in Minneapolis.
[56:02] Believest thou this? He said, "Abraham
[56:05] 25 years before Isaac was born testify."
[56:10] And believe God when he was a hundred
[56:13] years old, Paul before the storm ever
[56:17] ceased knew what was going to happen
[56:21] because he had God's word for it.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "NOW YOU'VE GOT GOD'S WORD FOR
[56:26] it this afternoon." He says, HE SAID,
[56:29] "OH, I WISH YOU COULD DO THIS. IF YOU'LL
[56:31] DO THIS, HERE'S A CHALLENGE THAT I MAKE
[56:34] AS A MINISTER of the gospel. If you'll
[56:36] believe this afternoon AND THE HOLY
[56:39] SPIRIT WILL COME DOWN IN OUR midst and
[56:41] you can actually while you're praying,
[56:44] feel the Holy Spirit IN YOUR HEART THAT
[56:46] HE'S ACCEPTED YOUR PRAYER. IF YOU'LL
[56:48] STAND ON THAT RIGHT THERE, BELIEVE IT.
[56:51] DON'T FOOL WITH IT ANYMORE. PRAYER IN
[56:53] THE PRAYER LINE. He says YOU DON'T NEED
[56:55] IT. IF YOU'LL BELIEVE IT RIGHT THERE
[56:57] WHERE YOU ARE, THEN THAT SETTLES THE
[56:59] SICKNESS FOR the rest OF THE WAY OUT.
[57:02] THAT'LL DO IT. THEN RISE WITH A STERN
[57:05] FAITH. WALK BOLDLY.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE WELL? BECAUSE GOD
[57:10] SAID SO.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; AND I BELIEVE HIS WORD. THAT'S WHY.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS YOU'RE NOT SAVED BECAUSE YOU
[57:18] FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SAVED.
[57:20] HE SAID, "IF SOMEBODY SAY, "I KNOW I'M
[57:22] SAVED BECAUSE I HAD A CHILL RUN THROUGH
[57:24] ME AND SO FORTH." THAT'S NOT WHY I'M
[57:26] SAVED. SATAN WOULD WHIP ME AROUND THE
[57:29] STUMP ANYWHERE. HE CAN'T UPON YOUR
[57:31] FEELINGS. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEN WHEN I
[57:34] WALK BACK AND SAY, "THUS SAYAITH THE
[57:36] LORD," MY FAITH IS BUILT UPON THE WORD
[57:38] OF GOD. HE CAN'T WHIP ME THAT WAY.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; As a minister, you watch you watch you
[57:48] watch when you don't even consult with
[57:50] other men and you watch when they read a
[57:52] scripture. You watch when they read
[57:53] quotes and then you know that's the
[57:55] first quote you're getting ready TO
[57:56] READ. YOU KNOW AUTOMATICALLY THAT'S GOD
[57:59] ORCHESTRATING an entire meeting.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; He said he says remember Jesus had all
[58:06] the qualities of the father in him. Do
[58:08] you believe that? SURE HE DID. ALL THE
[58:10] FINE GIFTS OF GOD WAS IN CHRIST HIS SON.
[58:13] FOR HE WAS THE OFFSPRING OF GOD. HE WHEN
[58:15] HE MET SATAN, HE SAID, "FOR YOUR
[58:17] EXAMPLE, HE NEVER USED ONE GIFT ON HIM."
[58:20] WHEN SATAN CAME TO HIM, HE SAID, "IT IS
[58:23] WRITTEN." DEUTERONOMY 7:14,
[58:26] HE SAYS 8:14, HE SAID, "MAN SHALL NOT
[58:28] LIVE BY BREAD ALONE." HE SAID, "BUT
[58:31] EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDTH OUT OF THE
[58:32] MOUTH OF GOD, SATAN CAUGHT HIM UP AGAIN
[58:34] IN THE PINNACLE OF THE TEMPLE." AND
[58:36] JESUS SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN."
[58:38] &gt;&gt; AND HE TOOK HIM ON THE TOP OF THE
[58:39] MOUNTAIN, AND JESUS SAID, "IT IS
[58:41] WRITTEN. IT IS WRITTEN.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HERE IT IS. I WANTED YOU TO SEE
[58:46] IT AND GET IT NOW. HE SAID THE WORD OF
[58:49] GOD, THE WRITTEN WORD OF GOD WILL DEFEAT
[58:52] SATAN ANYWHERE,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; ANYWHERE,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; ANY PLACE, ANYTIME.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S WRITTEN. HE SAID, "THERE IT IS."
[59:09] DON'T YOU LOVE HIM? AMEN.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; SAID, "What does a farmer do? He sews
[59:15] the wheat."
[59:18] He said, "Well, look for the harvest."
[59:19] The next morning, what does he do? He
[59:21] goes out there and he uncovers this why
[59:22] it ain't sprouted. There's nothing to
[59:23] it. Ain't going to have no wheat. And if
[59:27] he isn't going to have any weight and he
[59:29] just digs it up looking for it, he will
[59:31] never have wheat.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "You just sew it and leave it
[59:34] alone. It's up to God to bring it forth.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; It's up to God to send the rain.
[59:40] It's up to you to accept God's word.
[59:42] It's up to God to bring it to pass.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No man's worth any more than
[59:49] his word. AND HE SAID, "AND GOD'S NOT
[59:52] WORTH A BIT MORE THAN WHAT his word SAY
[59:55] THIS." AND I SAY THIS WITH A CHALLENGE
[59:58] IN FAITH THAT EVERY PROMISE OF GOD WILL
[1:00:01] BE BROUGHT TO PASS IF YOU TAKE THE RIGHT
[1:00:04] MENTAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS IT.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. perfect faith. He said,
[1:00:10] "Let's just stand still just a minute.
[1:00:13] Let's just worship him in our heart." He
[1:00:15] said, "He's here. God, he's here." WHO
[1:00:19] THE IDENTIFIED CHRIST HIMSELF as being
[1:00:21] the word. In the beginning was the word
[1:00:24] and the word was with God and the word
[1:00:27] was God and the word was made flesh and
[1:00:29] dwelt among us. He's the same yesterday,
[1:00:32] today, and forever.
[1:00:35] He said the word is sharper than any
[1:00:38] two-edged sword. He said he said it's a
[1:00:41] discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:00:43] intents OF THE HEART. HE SAID WHAT
[1:00:45] YOU'VE COME HERE FOR. WHAT'S YOUR
[1:00:47] PURPOSE OF BEING HERE? WHO YOU ARE
[1:00:49] IDENTIFY JESUS CHRIST TO BE MESSIAH
[1:00:52] TODAY. IT IDENTIFIES HIM OF BEING THE
[1:00:55] SAME MESSIAH YESTERDAY, TODAY AND
[1:00:57] FOREVER. DO WE BELIEVE THAT?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:02] the great physician who is here.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM
[1:01:07] THAT BELIEVE. IF THEY LAY HANDS ON THE
[1:01:09] SICK, they shall recover. And if you say
[1:01:11] to the mountain, "Be moved." And don't
[1:01:13] doubt in your heart, BUT CAN BELIEVE
[1:01:15] that he can CREATE SQUIRRELS. WHO HAS NO
[1:01:18] WAY AT ALL OR NOTHING THERE TO BELIEVE?
[1:01:20] HE SAID, "IT'S MY OWN FAITH THAT GOES
[1:01:22] AND DOES THAT." MY FAITH IN WHAT HE
[1:01:25] CHALLENGED ME TO ASK. HE CHALLENGED ME
[1:01:27] TO ASK IT. AND I RECEIVED HIS CHALLENGE
[1:01:30] IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS WORD. I ASKED IT AND
[1:01:32] IT APPEARED.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; GOD IN HEAVEN KNOWS THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:01:36] CAN HE ALSO HEAL THE SICK?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; AND IF HE CAN LIFT me up WITH A FAITH
[1:01:40] THIS WAY, EVEN WITH THE PEOPLE, HE SAID,
[1:01:43] IF THEY CAN'T CLIMB TO THAT BRACKET, IF
[1:01:45] THEY CAN'T DO IT, HE CAN USE MY FAITH.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I'M CLIMBING FOR YOU. I'M
[1:01:52] BELIEVING FOR YOU. I'M SPEAKING for you.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; He makes a statement. HE SAID, "YOU
[1:02:02] TESTIFY OF FAITH THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T
[1:02:04] SEE,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T FEEL."
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; WHY? IT'S THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; AND IT WILL MAKE THESE ELEMENTS AND
[1:02:13] THESE MOLECULES
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; come to order
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; anywhere, ANY PLACE, ANYTIME.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And we believe it with all
[1:02:25] of our hearts.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Children of Israel, as they begin to
[1:02:29] move, and notice very quickly, God
[1:02:31] provided for them everything that they
[1:02:33] had need of.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; They never did build an industry for
[1:02:38] taking care of clothes,
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; cuz their clothes never wore out.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO SHOE FACTORIES.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz their shoes never wore out.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Brother John, can you turn that just a
[1:02:52] little bit? That wind
[1:02:54] their their their food. They never did
[1:02:57] have to build FARMS BECAUSE GOD PROVIDED
[1:03:01] FOR THEM THE FOOD THAT THEY HAD need of.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE WIND ACTUALLY
[1:03:07] THE WATER THAT THEY HAD NEED OF. GOD
[1:03:11] PROVIDED a rock
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; in THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT. BROTHER
[1:03:17] BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, THAT MAN TOOK THAT
[1:03:19] MADE THAT PICTURE AND THAT THAT THAT
[1:03:21] THAT BEAUTIFUL ARTWORK AND HE SAID THERE
[1:03:23] WAS A ROCK, BUT HE HAD A LITTLE TEACUP."
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THAT'S NOT MY GOD."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY THIS TO YOU. TWO MILLION
[1:03:35] PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK FROM A TEACUP.
[1:03:40] ALL OF THEIR ANIMALS,
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD, EVERY BIT OF
[1:03:44] HER
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; HAD TO DRINK FROM THIS WATER.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; AND GOD, LISTEN. IN ALL, IT WOULD TAKE
[1:03:53] INCREDIBLE COMPUTERS TO BE ABLE TO JUST
[1:03:56] HAVE THE MIND ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO
[1:03:58] CALCULATE HOW MUCH FOOD IT'S GOING TO
[1:04:00] TAKE.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; HELP ME, brother Raymond.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] HOW DO YOU GET CLOTHES THAT THAT THAT
[1:04:11] HAS A WARRANTY? 40 YEARS.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; SHOES THAT HAS A WARRANTY. MY LORD. EVEN
[1:04:19] FOR SISTERS. 40 YEARS. BROTHERS, you
[1:04:22] should at least said amen right there
[1:04:24] real quickly.
[1:04:32] THEY NEVER BUILT A REHAB CENTER.
[1:04:35] Come on. Come on.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER BUILT A HALFWAY HOUSE.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER BUILT HOSPITALS.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; They never had a merger of care.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; THEY NEVER HAD A NATIONAL HEALTH CARE
[1:04:47] SYSTEM.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NOT POLICE STATIONS
[1:04:50] EVERYWHERE.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY GOT SICK, GOD GAVE THEM A
[1:04:57] BRASS SERPENT.
[1:05:00] AND HE TOLD THEM, "I AM THE LORD THY GOD
[1:05:03] THAT HEALTH THEE.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; HE HAD EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEEDED.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; I'M THE ONE THAT DID THIS FOR YOU. I'M
[1:05:14] YOUR GOD.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FORGET THIS.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; NEVER ALLOW AMNESIA TO COME AMONG YOU.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; NEVER LET NOTHING GET BETWEEN ME AND
[1:05:26] YOU.
[1:05:31] I'm the one that brought the plagues
[1:05:33] upon Egypt.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; When Moses walked in and he looked at
[1:05:37] the greatest army and the greatest king
[1:05:39] on the earth, HE SAID, "JUST TELL HIM I
[1:05:41] AM."
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "HE'S STILL THE I AM."
[1:05:44] TONIGHT,
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; don't you love the Lord?
[1:05:50] When Jesus was standing here in flesh
[1:05:54] and he was standing and he was looking
[1:05:56] at our enemy,
[1:05:58] here stood the lamb of God that taketh
[1:06:00] away the sins of the world.
[1:06:03] Had fasted 40 days and was quite weary
[1:06:06] in his flesh. Listen, God knows when we
[1:06:09] get kind of weary in our flesh. Yes,
[1:06:12] sir.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; And so he he stood there and he could
[1:06:17] have used his great gifts upon him.
[1:06:21] And when the enemy came and he asked
[1:06:22] him, "If thou art a message believer,
[1:06:28] IF THOU ART THE SON OF GOD," AND HE
[1:06:31] BEGINS TO MAKE HIM some offers. Jesus
[1:06:34] did not use his gift to destroy the
[1:06:37] enemy. He simply knowing he was the word
[1:06:41] begin to quote the word to him
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; because there's going to be times IN
[1:06:46] LIFE THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL
[1:06:49] ANOINTED WITH A PILLAR OF FIRE AROUND
[1:06:51] YOU.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR THE anointed
[1:06:54] music.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; YOUR FAVORITE PREACHER IS NOT GOING TO
[1:06:58] BE SCREAMING IN YOUR EARS.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES YOU'RE GOING TO BE STANDING
[1:07:02] ABSOLUTELY ALONE. AND YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
[1:07:05] GOD ON A PERSONAL LEVEL.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; WHEN THERE'S NO CHILLS RUNNING UP AND
[1:07:13] DOWN YOUR SPINE, WHEN YOUR FEET AREN'T
[1:07:15] GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR,
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO STAND THERE AND THROUGH
[1:07:21] YOUR MORTAL LIPS OF CLAY, QUOTE, GOD'S
[1:07:24] ETERNAL COVENANT WITH YOU. IT IS
[1:07:27] WRITTEN,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; "IF YE ABIDE IN ME AND MY WORDS ABIDE IN
[1:07:32] YOU, ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND IT SHALL BE
[1:07:35] DONE."
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL TAKE THOSE WORDS, THE COVENANT OF
[1:07:38] GOD, AND YOU'LL BEGIN TO QUOTE THEM
[1:07:40] ACROSS YOUR LIPS, YOUR LIPS, BECAUSE
[1:07:43] YOUR LIPS HAVE THE POWER OF LIFE AND
[1:07:45] DEATH IN IT.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Your lips.
[1:07:50] Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus would stand there and he would
[1:07:54] quote to them, "I am the resurrection
[1:07:56] and I am the life."
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; When he came to Lazarus's tomb and he
[1:08:00] was standing there and he went three
[1:08:02] days out of his own jour out of his own
[1:08:04] way and and went away even when Lazarus
[1:08:06] was sick. I'm sure there was a lot of
[1:08:08] people around that said if he was really
[1:08:10] a friend of Lazarus, he would have
[1:08:12] already come and took care of him. BUT
[1:08:14] YOU SEE, GOD KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT THAT
[1:08:17] we have NEED OF. YOU SEE, HE KNOWS OUR
[1:08:19] TRIALS BEFORE THEY WOULD EVER COME TO
[1:08:21] US.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; BROTHER RAM SAID, "AND HE'S GOT
[1:08:23] CONFIDENCE IN us to allow us to go
[1:08:26] through our trials."
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus went a completely different
[1:08:33] direction. His disciples didn't even
[1:08:34] understand even why he would go in that
[1:08:36] direction. And I'm just kind of
[1:08:38] gathering our thoughts just here just
[1:08:39] for a little while. And as and as he
[1:08:41] goes to and he goes to where Lazarus is
[1:08:44] laying, he meets his sister. and his
[1:08:47] sister tells him he's late. He's already
[1:08:50] dead. And Jesus tells her, "I am the
[1:08:53] resurrection and the life."
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And she begins to talk about the
[1:09:00] resurrection.
[1:09:02] And she begins to say, "He surely he'll
[1:09:04] come in that resurrection."
[1:09:06] And then he begins to come and he begins
[1:09:08] to bring her the revelation of who he
[1:09:10] is. Now notice when he walks to the
[1:09:13] tomb,
[1:09:15] he is already clothed in his grave
[1:09:18] clothes.
[1:09:20] The worms are already starting to eat
[1:09:22] him.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; But the circumstances
[1:09:28] WITH OUR GOD
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; IS NOT WHAT HE'S LOOKING AT.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; LAZARUS WAS ALREADY IN ANOTHER
[1:09:37] DIMENSION. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; ALREADY TALKING WITH THE ONES THAT JESUS
[1:09:42] HAS ALREADY quoted to Moses or God has
[1:09:45] already quoted TO MOSES. I AM THE GOD OF
[1:09:48] ABRAHAM. I AM THE GOD OF JACOB. I AM THE
[1:09:51] GOD OF ISAAC. AND LAZARUS IS NOW
[1:09:53] SPENDING TIME WITH THEM.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; No doubt testimonies are going backwards
[1:09:58] and forwards. THEY'RE EXCHANGING LITTLE
[1:10:01] TESTIMONIES AND LITTLE STORIES AND
[1:10:03] THEY'RE GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.
[1:10:05] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S A VOICE THAT
[1:10:08] IS VERY FAMILIAR TO LAZARUS
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ACROSS HIS LIPS HE CALLS LAZARUS
[1:10:17] BY NAME.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; And brother BROWN SAID HAD HE NOT CALLED
[1:10:22] HIM BY NAME THERE WOULD HAVE CAME A
[1:10:24] GENERAL RESURRECTION
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE IS OUR GOD.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:34] when he went to the places in the tombs,
[1:10:36] there was a man named Legion and no
[1:10:38] doubt he had he had many devils for the
[1:10:41] scriptures tells us that. BUT IF WE
[1:10:44] COULD GO BACK, SOMETHING TOOK HIM TO
[1:10:46] FROM FROM a realm of being a normal
[1:10:49] human being to one demon came in, then
[1:10:51] another demons comes in, another other
[1:10:53] demons comes in. And let ME JUST SAY
[1:10:55] THIS SHOULD GIVE US GREAT GREAT CAUSE OF
[1:10:58] FAITH TONIGHT. WE MAY THINK OUR LOVED
[1:11:00] ONES IS IS LOST AND THEY'RE WITHOUT GOD
[1:11:03] AND THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THEM. BUT JUST
[1:11:05] ALLOW JESUS TO COME THEIR WAY.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE NAKED IN THE
[1:11:11] TOMBS AND THEY'VE GOT CHAINS ALL OVER
[1:11:13] THEM. THEY'RE NOT WELCOME IN SOCIETY.
[1:11:16] JESUS KNOWS KNOWS HOW TO GO TO A
[1:11:18] PREDESTINATED SEED.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:26] LISTEN, NO DOUBT HE LIVED AMONGST THERE
[1:11:28] WAS HOLD FARMERS THAT WERE CLOSE AND
[1:11:29] THEY WERE GOOD. THEY WERE BUSINESSMEN
[1:11:32] AND THEY THEY WERE VERY UNHAPPY WHEN
[1:11:35] JESUS CAST OUT THOSE THOSE THOSE DEMONS
[1:11:38] AND THEY WENT INTO THE HOGS AND THE HOGS
[1:11:40] HAD MORE SENSE THAN THOSE PHARISEES AND
[1:11:42] SADDUCEES AND THEY WENT AND DROWNED
[1:11:44] THEMSELVES.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU NOTICE THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT
[1:11:50] LEGION WAS FOUND CLOTHED AND IN HIS
[1:11:53] RIGHT MIND. AMEN.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; You heard this morning about our right
[1:11:57] mind.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; You can't be in your right mind without
[1:12:01] God.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus stood there and said, "Destroy
[1:12:07] this temple and in three days I'll raise
[1:12:09] it up again."
[1:12:12] He said, "I have power to lay my life
[1:12:13] down and power to take it up again."
[1:12:16] because he could look at the word and
[1:12:19] the word said, "I will not suffer mine
[1:12:21] holy one to see corruption."
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Watch this statement. HE SAID, "ALL
[1:12:28] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE TO THEM THAT
[1:12:30] BELIEVE."
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; And if YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, WHATEVER GOD
[1:12:34] WILL LEAD YOUR SOUL to believe,
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; he said, "That is yours."
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; EVERY PLACE THE SOULS OF YOUR FOOT CAN
[1:12:41] SET UPON BY FAITH, GOD GIVES IT TO YOU.
[1:12:44] IT'S YOURS.
[1:12:46] YOU POSSESS IT. HE SAYS IF YOU CAN FIND
[1:12:49] THE KEY TO THIS LAW OF FAITH THAT OPENS
[1:12:52] IT TO YOU. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? THAT
[1:12:54] POWER IS CONTROLLED. IF YOU'RE A SON OF
[1:12:56] GOD AND YOU'RE A DAUGHTER OF GOD, THAT
[1:12:59] NEVER LEAVES YOU.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S WITH YOU ALL THE TIME, BUT YOUR
[1:13:03] FAITH GETS AWAY FROM IT, BUT IT'S STILL
[1:13:05] THERE. HE SAID, WHEN YOU'RE SAVED, GOD
[1:13:08] GIVES YOU FAITH TO RISE FROM THE MUCK OF
[1:13:10] THE EARTH. YOUR FAITH OVERCOMES THE
[1:13:12] THINGS OF THE WORLD. WHAT IS YOUR FAITH?
[1:13:14] YOUR FAITH IS THAT ACT THAT GOD HAS DID
[1:13:18] IN YOU TO MAKE YOU A SON OF GOD.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU QUIT YOUR LYING. YOU QUIT
[1:13:27] YOUR STEALING. YOU QUIT YOUR DRINKING
[1:13:30] BECAUSE YOUR FAITH RISES UP FROM ABOVE
[1:13:32] IT. AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT, YOU DON'T
[1:13:34] HAVE ANY FAITH. AND BY FAITH ARE YOU
[1:13:36] SAVED. AND THAT THROUGH THROUGH GRACE.
[1:13:38] AND AS MUCH AS YOUR FAITH WILL BE
[1:13:40] RELEASED, THAT'S HOW MUCH POWER THAT YOU
[1:13:42] CAN HAVE. BECAUSE IN YOU DWELLS THE
[1:13:45] POWER TO MAKE HEAVENS AND EARTH.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; God dwells in you.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; GOD DWELLS IN YOU.
[1:14:02] I WAS THINKING AS I WAS sitting at the
[1:14:04] table this afternoon reading these
[1:14:06] quotes and I was thinking
[1:14:08] there's huge huge buildings
[1:14:12] of some of the greatest theologians in
[1:14:14] the minds of that has been evoluted
[1:14:16] through time
[1:14:18] and they don't have a clue what's been
[1:14:20] released to you. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; If this world only had any kind of
[1:14:27] revelation of what's been released to
[1:14:29] you,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; you'd be sitting in rooms to where
[1:14:32] they're trying to settle peace and
[1:14:34] economic conditions.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WHY IS THE WORLD WHY
[1:14:38] IT'S AT WHERE IT'S AT TONIGHT? BECAUSE
[1:14:41] THEY REJECTED THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BROWN SAID THEY'D HAVE NO NEED
[1:14:46] FOR HOSPITALS.
[1:14:48] IF THEY'D ACCEPTED THIS MESSAGE, THEY'D
[1:14:50] HAD NO NEED FOR A HOSPITAL.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; They'd have HAD NO NEED FOR PRISONS OUT
[1:14:54] THERE.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; THEY'D HAVE NO NEED FOR MARRIAGE
[1:15:00] SEMINARS.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; THEY'D have no need. Are you with me
[1:15:03] now?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; THEY'D HAVE NO NEED FOR REHAB CENTERS.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "GOD DWELLS IN YOU. YOU ARE
[1:15:13] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THERE YOU
[1:15:16] ARE. BUT IT'S YOUR FAITH. JESUS SAID,
[1:15:18] "ACCORDING TO YOUR FAITH, BE IT UNTO
[1:15:20] YOU. IF THOU CANST BELIEVE, ALL THINGS
[1:15:24] ARE POSSIBLE."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, IF YOU CAN SAY
[1:15:28] TO THIS MOUNTAIN, "BE MOVED." DON'T
[1:15:30] DOUBT, BUT BELIEVE WHAT YOU HAVE SAID.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT KIND OF A PEOPLE OUGHT WE TO
[1:15:37] BE HAVING FAITH IN THIS GREAT REDEEMING
[1:15:40] CHRIST THAT LIVES IN US, this smitten
[1:15:42] ROCK THAT NEVER LEAVES THE CHURCH.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:46] NOTICE THE STATEMENT. I AM WITH YOU
[1:15:50] ALWAYS,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; EVEN TO THE END OF THE WORLD.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, Brother Ron, I've never seen
[1:16:05] a miracle."
[1:16:09] Let me let me just share a couple of
[1:16:12] things with you tonight.
[1:16:15] The greatest miracle you'll ever see is
[1:16:18] a transformation
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; of a sinner.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle you will ever see
[1:16:30] is a transformation of a sinner.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; I remember in 1978 when brother Ed
[1:16:39] walked into into Christiansburg, he
[1:16:42] actually walked in. He probably flew
[1:16:44] into Christiansburg, but he came into
[1:16:47] the tabernacle where I was a I was a
[1:16:50] teenage boy and I sat and I listened to
[1:16:53] experiences and and as he was just we
[1:16:55] were just talking about it at the table
[1:16:58] and he had preached on the resurrection.
[1:17:02] He was an eyewitness to the supernatural
[1:17:05] that we have had in this day.
[1:17:09] And there were certain pieces of the
[1:17:11] puzzle that for a teenager I was sitting
[1:17:13] there and I I had listened to the tapes
[1:17:17] and I as a little as a young man coming
[1:17:20] up in a message church I listened to the
[1:17:22] tapes but now pieces of the puzzle was
[1:17:24] beginning to be put put together in the
[1:17:27] right places for me.
[1:17:30] We hear brother Brandham talk about
[1:17:32] Congressman Upshaw.
[1:17:34] We realize that an angel of the Lord
[1:17:36] meets him in a cave in 1946. And and
[1:17:39] this angel tells him he's going to pray
[1:17:41] for kings.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to pray for statesmen. And
[1:17:46] you see, he can't see what's coming down
[1:17:48] the road. And I have reasons for these
[1:17:50] statements. He can't see what's coming
[1:17:52] down the road.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; BUT HE SENT FROM THE PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:17:57] and to tell him of the gift and the
[1:17:59] strange things that's happened in his
[1:18:01] life. BUT YOU SEE, THERE'S A STATESMAN
[1:18:04] that has ran for president at 1926.
[1:18:08] HIS NAME IS UPSHAW. HE'S HAD AN
[1:18:10] ACCIDENT. HE'S GOING TO BE IN A
[1:18:12] WHEELCHAIR. All of THESE YEARS, 49 PLUS
[1:18:16] years at one statement says, one place
[1:18:18] says 66 years ON CRUTCHES IN A
[1:18:21] WHEELCHAIR. ON THIS NIGHT, HE'S BEEN
[1:18:23] PRAYED FOR. HE'S BEEN PRAYED FOR AND
[1:18:25] CRUTCHES HAS BEEN JERKED OUT OF HIS
[1:18:27] HAND. IN WHEELCHAIRS BEEN JERKED OUT
[1:18:28] FROM BEHIND HIM. BROTHER BRAM SAYS IN
[1:18:30] ONE PLACE MANY A MAN HAS HAS TRIED TO
[1:18:33] PRAY FOR HIM AND HE SAYS AND HE SAID
[1:18:35] HE'S SITTING IN THE BUILDING AND HERE
[1:18:37] STANDS A PROPHET OF GOD STANDING THERE
[1:18:39] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN A VISION BEGINS TO
[1:18:41] BREAK before him. Man in a brown suit
[1:18:44] TIPPING HIS HAT AND HE BEGINS TO TELL
[1:18:46] ABOUT AN ACCIDENT TAKING PLACE.
[1:18:49] CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW BEGINS TO REALIZE
[1:18:52] THIS MAN IS NOW TALKING ABOUT ME
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; AND IT IS HIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; IT IS HIS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND. I'M
[1:19:03] THAT MAN.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, WHEN THE WORD CAME ACROSS,
[1:19:07] HE BELIEVED THE WORD.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; He believed WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT PROCLAIMED IT WAS MORE THAN
[1:19:15] GUESS WORK. IT WAS MORE THAN A MAN
[1:19:17] TRYING TO GET HIM OUT OF A WHEELCHAIR,
[1:19:20] BUT THE WORD WAS BECOMING FLESH.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; AND OUR GOD WAS GOING TO HIS PEW.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS. HE
[1:19:30] WAS NOT GOING TO NEED AN ATTENDANT TO
[1:19:32] HELP HIM WITH A WHEELCHAIR GET INTO THE
[1:19:34] BUILDING EVER AGAIN.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE NEED AN ATTENDANT
[1:19:39] FOR HIS WHEELCHAIR TO PUSH HIM IN. NEVER
[1:19:42] AGAIN WOULD HE HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY
[1:19:43] HAND HIS CRUTCHES AND KIND OF SAY TO HIM
[1:19:46] TO GET SPECIAL ATTENTION BECAUSE GOD HAD
[1:19:49] VINDICATED HIS UNFAILING WORDS OF
[1:19:51] PROMISE TO HIM AS AN INDIVIDUAL.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD LIFTED HIMSELF OFF OF THE PAGES
[1:19:58] OF HIS WORD WHERE IT SAID I AM THE SAME
[1:20:01] YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:14] I can only imagine.
[1:20:18] It's just hard for me to fathom.
[1:20:21] Here's a woman with a dead baby.
[1:20:24] And the doctors look at her and tell
[1:20:26] her, "Go bury your baby.
[1:20:30] Why do you even have it here at the
[1:20:32] hospital? Go bury your baby."
[1:20:35] Instead of taking it to the proper
[1:20:38] facility
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; to bury the baby and say goodbye,
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; she wraps it in a blanket
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; because she's heard a word the night
[1:20:49] before.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And yes, it's raining and the conditions
[1:20:55] are bad.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And yes, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
[1:20:58] WILL TRY TO KEEP HER FROM GETTING WHERE
[1:20:59] SHE NEEDS TO GO.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; AND SHE PRESSES HER WAY THROUGH 300
[1:21:03] USHERS.
[1:21:05] AND SHE'S VERY PERSISTENT,
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; CATHOLIC IN HER BACKGROUND,
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE KNOWS IF I CAN GET THIS BABY TO
[1:21:16] TO TO TO
[1:21:18] THIS MAN,
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT NOT TAKE HOME A CORPSE,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; IF WE HAD THAT KIND OF REVELATION IN OUR
[1:21:28] HEARTS.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT TAKE HOME A CORPSE TONIGHT.
[1:21:36] She carries this baby and even brother
[1:21:37] Brandom, you know, they begin to make
[1:21:40] notice that, you know, she's making some
[1:21:42] SHE'S MAKING SOME NOISE NOW. SHE'S NOT
[1:21:44] TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER. SHE'S NOT
[1:21:46] ALLOWING SOMEBODY TO JUST BRUSH HER
[1:21:48] ASIDE. SHE'S NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO MOVE
[1:21:51] HER BACKWARDS. SHE WILL NOT TAKE THE
[1:21:53] PRESSURE OF OTHER MEN. SHE LITERALLY IS
[1:21:55] MAKING HER WAY
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A FAITH THAT HAS SETTLED
[1:21:59] IN HER HEART. SHE MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING
[1:22:01] ABOUT THE THIRD POLE OF THE SEVENTH
[1:22:03] SEAL, BUT SHE KNOWS THAT GOD IS
[1:22:06] OPERATING THROUGH THAT MAN.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN, MANY OF US DON'T
[1:22:14] HAVE A GREAT GREAT EDUCATION. WE CAN'T
[1:22:17] EXPLAIN ALL THE DOTS AND THE EYES AND
[1:22:19] THE TE'S, BUT KNOW YOUR GOD.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:30] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; FINALLY, brother Brown says, "You know
[1:22:34] these stories."
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Won't you go pray
[1:22:39] for her? She don't know who who Brandham
[1:22:42] is. Won't you go pray?" And a vision
[1:22:45] breaks. He sees a baby well alive. Bring
[1:22:50] the woman to me.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And he's standing there holding the
[1:22:55] baby. And he begins to pray.
[1:22:58] Hallelujah.
[1:23:00] He begins to pray.
[1:23:04] Warmth begins to come.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; A baby begins to kick.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; This girl has had faith. If I can get
[1:23:15] that baby,
[1:23:19] if I can get that baby into the presence
[1:23:21] of God,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; not a man, in the presence of God,
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; I'll take my baby home.
[1:23:28] Oh my God have mercy.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Says only about an hour later, a man
[1:23:35] steps BEFORE HIM AND HE'S and he's even
[1:23:37] his feet are very wrinkled up and his
[1:23:39] skin's very dry looking. It's very
[1:23:42] wrinkled in his face and he's blind
[1:23:46] about my daddy's size.
[1:23:50] HE'S BLIND AND COMPASSION BEGINS TO
[1:23:53] MOVE.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Move on, brother Brandham.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OUR GOD IS AN AWESOME GOD.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; THIS MAN HAS IF HE CAN GET INTO THE
[1:24:08] PRESENCE OF GOD, NO LONGER DOES HE HAVE
[1:24:10] TO STAGGER IN THE DARKNESS.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; WELL, RON, WHY WOULD YOU GO THIS WAY
[1:24:18] TONIGHT? BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENEMY TELLS
[1:24:20] US THAT GOD DON'T DO THESE THINGS
[1:24:21] ANYMORE.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO TELL THAT ENEMY, MY GOD'S
[1:24:25] STILL ALIVE AND WELL.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; PULLS THIS MAN UP CLOSE TO HIM. IT'S
[1:24:38] ALSO IN BOMBAY.
[1:24:40] THERE'S A BLIND MAN STANDING BEFORE HIM.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALSO IN JONESBORO. THERE'S A BLIND
[1:24:45] GIRL
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; STANDING BEFORE HIM IN A PARKING LOT
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S COME WITH A TESTIMONY AND HER
[1:24:54] TESTIMONY IS HER TESTIMONY IS WE HEARD
[1:24:57] ON THE RADIO
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; THAT A MAN FROM KENNETH MISSOURI CAME TO
[1:25:02] THIS MEETING AND HIS EYES CAME OPEN
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAYS MY DADDY BROUGHT ME DOWN
[1:25:09] HERE AND WE'RE IN A BUS WE COME DOWN
[1:25:12] HERE MY I'M LOST MY I'M LOST FOR MY
[1:25:15] DADDY.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN BEGINS TO TALK TO HER.
[1:25:18] HE'S WONDERING WHERE HER DADDY MIGHT BE.
[1:25:20] AND AND HE AND HE SEES THE BUS, THE ONE
[1:25:22] THAT SHE COME OFF. AND LISTEN, THERE'S
[1:25:24] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INTERMINGLING WITH
[1:25:26] ONE ANOTHER. THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE WHO
[1:25:28] BROTHER BRHAM IS. AND HERE HE'S STANDING
[1:25:30] ONE- ON-ONE WITH THIS WOMAN.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THESE OPTICAL
[1:25:35] NERVES THAT THESE THESE CATARACT HAS
[1:25:38] WRAPPED AROUND HER OPTICAL NERVES AND
[1:25:40] THEY'VE GRIPPED HER AND AND SHE'S BECOME
[1:25:42] BLIND. THEY WANTED TO DO AN OPERATION
[1:25:44] WHEN THE CATARACTS GOT RIPE. BUT BUT
[1:25:47] THEY WAITED TOO LATE. NOW THESE
[1:25:49] CATARACTS HAVE TAKEN HER EYESIGHT.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; IF I CAN ONLY GET TO THIS THIS THIS THIS
[1:25:54] HEALER. AND BROTHER BRANDON BEGAN TO
[1:25:56] EXPLAIN TO HER, I'M NOT YOUR HEALER.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; WILLIAM BRANDON'S NOT THE HEALER. JESUS
[1:26:03] CHRIST IS YOUR HEALER.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:09] BROTHER, brother Brandham began to speak
[1:26:10] to her
[1:26:13] and he said, "I'm William Brandham."
[1:26:15] NOTICE WHAT SHE DID. SHE GRIPPED HIS
[1:26:18] LAPEL.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; SHE GRIPPED HIS LAPEL AND SHE HELD ON.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE LET ME JUST SAY, SHE HAD CAME IN
[1:26:26] THIS CONDITION, BUT SHE WAS DETERMINED
[1:26:29] NOT TO LEAVE IN THIS CONDITION.
[1:26:32] LISTEN, IF YOU'RE DETERMINED HERE
[1:26:34] TONIGHT,
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S SIN, WHETHER IT'S HABITS,
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; WHETHER IT'S SICKNESS IN YOUR LIFE, OUR
[1:26:41] LORD JESUS IS IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT.
[1:26:43] WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE WAY THAT WE
[1:26:45] WALKED IN HERE.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; HE CAN LOOSE THE CHANGE FROM OFF OF YOU
[1:26:49] TONIGHT.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LISTEN TO BROTHER BRANAM AS
[1:26:56] HE BEGINS TO PRAY, "FATHER, WHILE YOU
[1:26:59] WERE CLIMBING UP THE HILL TO CALVARY,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Simon Subserene
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; carried your cross
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; UP CALVAR'S HILL. NOTICE HIS STATEMENT.
[1:27:20] HERE STANDS ONE OF HIS DAUGHTERS.
[1:27:23] REMEMBER
[1:27:25] HER, LORD.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HER FAITH.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; NOTICE HER FAITH. SHE SAID,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; "If you pray FOR ME, I'LL FIND MY OWN
[1:27:37] DADDY."
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:58] Sometimes
[1:28:00] sometimes time seems to, if we're not
[1:28:03] careful, rob us
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; and numb us
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; and cause glare and
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; even kind of dims our faith if we're not
[1:28:17] careful.
[1:28:27] As God began to lay these things
[1:28:28] together for me a few weeks ago,
[1:28:33] I'd like to talk about this place just
[1:28:34] for a few minutes.
[1:28:38] We're very much aware that we're at
[1:28:40] Mount Baker Bible Way Camp.
[1:28:47] This place was reserved so you could
[1:28:49] come and worship the Lord.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; This place was dedicated before the
[1:28:55] foundation of the world where his
[1:28:57] children could come and be at.
[1:29:02] Now
[1:29:05] we sit here tonight and we're sitting
[1:29:06] here 2010
[1:29:09] and we know that we are into the ver the
[1:29:11] very divine orchestration of God.
[1:29:16] Don't get real quiet on me. Make me
[1:29:19] nervous.
[1:29:23] You see, it was about two and a half
[1:29:24] years ago or about three years ago,
[1:29:28] 2007.
[1:29:31] It was on a Monday evening
[1:29:34] and and I was getting ready to to set a
[1:29:37] fire and you know this story very well.
[1:29:39] set a fire to some brush, not knowing I
[1:29:44] was getting ready to go through one of
[1:29:45] the trials of my life. You see, I
[1:29:48] already knew God as a healer
[1:29:51] because I had seen God when I fell 40 ft
[1:29:55] and I landed on concrete and every
[1:29:57] vertebrae from my neck to my cockbone
[1:30:01] was broken and shattered and cracked and
[1:30:04] the doctors told me I'd never walk
[1:30:05] again.
[1:30:07] with all of their X-rays and all of
[1:30:09] their knowledge, they looked at me and
[1:30:11] said, "You'll never walk again." And
[1:30:12] within a few hours after prayer, feeling
[1:30:15] begin to came back in my feet. They
[1:30:17] actually they actually put me in a
[1:30:19] wheelchair and sent me out the back
[1:30:20] door.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THEIR HIGHEST
[1:30:28] PHYSICIAN COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD JUST
[1:30:30] TAKEN PLACE.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. AMEN.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; GOING FROM A SPOT OF NOT EVER BEING ABLE
[1:30:41] TO WALK AGAIN
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; TO WALKING WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO.
[1:31:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; THESE ARE NOT STORIES OF DECADES AGO.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; NOT 2,000 YEARS AGO, BUT MY GOD
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; WALKED INTO AN ICU UNIT ROOM WHERE A
[1:31:13] TRAUMA CENTER WHERE DOCTORS WERE DOING
[1:31:15] THEIR BEST LOOKING AT X-RAYS SAYING,
[1:31:17] "THIS IS WHAT WE SEE." BUT I HAVE A HIGH
[1:31:19] PHYSICIAN.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHO CAN BE TOUCHED WITH THE
[1:31:24] FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH me now?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; But laying in a coma for four weeks,
[1:31:38] SISTER CONNIE WAS WAS GOING BETWEEN ONE
[1:31:41] HOSPITAL AND THE OTHER HOSPITAL, my
[1:31:43] oldest son, who had had been just right
[1:31:45] on time to save my life in the midst of
[1:31:48] that fire AND THAT EXPLOSION. GOD
[1:31:51] PROVIDED ME A A SON STRONG ENOUGH TO DO
[1:31:53] THE JOB.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah for that.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; But somewhere around the first week, the
[1:32:01] end OF THE FIRST WEEK, WHILE THE DOCTORS
[1:32:04] WERE TELLING HER, "HE'LL NOT LIVE.
[1:32:06] THERE'S NO WAY HE can make it through
[1:32:08] WHERE THE THE LIFE SUPPORT system was at
[1:32:11] running at AT 100% FULL CAPACITY." I had
[1:32:14] had I had literally I had really all of
[1:32:17] my stomach fluids had came up into my
[1:32:19] lungs AND MY ALREADY CHARRED LUNGS, MY
[1:32:22] THROAT, MY EVERYTHING. AND HERE HERE ON
[1:32:24] THE OTHER END OF THE LINE HERE IN THIS
[1:32:27] AREA,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS UNDER ORCHESTRATION
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; FOR THIS NIGHT.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:44] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD ORDAINS, GOD CALLS, GOD
[1:32:48] ELECTS, GOD PREDESTINATES.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T GET NERVOUS.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; GOD IS NEVER IN A CRISIS MEETING.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER CALLS HIS ANGELS TOGETHER AND
[1:32:59] RUBS HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAY, "OH MY
[1:33:01] GOODNESS, THINGS HAVE FELL APART." LET
[1:33:03] ME JUST SAY, GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERY
[1:33:06] SITUATION, OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:13] FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "AND WE KNOW ALL
[1:33:15] THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD."
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Tim, I HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS
[1:33:26] WITH YOU to preach in your meeting with
[1:33:28] Brother Biscll. Sorry I didn't show up.
[1:33:31] I slept right through it. I'm sure it
[1:33:34] was a good meeting.
[1:33:40] Hallelujah. I'D STOOD IN THE FIELD WITH
[1:33:43] BROTHER TIM. WE'D WENT TO AN OPEN FIELD.
[1:33:47] WE TOOK A SEED OF WHEAT. STILL HAVE IT
[1:33:49] IN MY OFFICE TODAY. A SEED OF WHEAT AND
[1:33:52] WE HAD HELD IT. LISTEN, THEY HADN'T EVEN
[1:33:55] BOUGHT THE PROPERTY YET. IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:33:57] HADN'T EVEN BROUGHT THE PROPERTY.
[1:33:59] BROTHER RON, WE WANT TO BELIEVE.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; WE WANT TO AGREE TOGETHER. THIS IS WHERE
[1:34:05] THE PLACE IS THAT I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD
[1:34:08] BUILD A PLACE, BUY THIS PLACE AND BUILD
[1:34:11] US A CHURCH.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; I FELT A PART OF THAT.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HAD BIGGER PLANS.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVED WITH BROTHER CAM.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY I'LL PREACH IN THAT PLACE.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I'm coming.
[1:34:43] There's movements being made.
[1:34:49] We want to buy this place. We want to
[1:34:51] buy this piece of ground. God has laid
[1:34:54] it on Brother Ed's heart
[1:34:59] to have me as a speaker.
[1:35:02] on the other end of the line. That's the
[1:35:04] last thing
[1:35:07] that any doctor would think
[1:35:10] about nine months from now, you'll be
[1:35:12] the speaker at a convention.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Lungs are 75% burnt. Throat is burnt.
[1:35:22] Lips are burnt. Face is burnt.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Arms is burnt. Neck is burnt.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. BROTHER HAROLD HILDERBRANDT
[1:35:32] ROLLS OFF OF THE BED THAT NIGHT WHEN he
[1:35:33] gets the CALL AND HE CALLS ALL OF HIS
[1:35:36] DEACONS AND GOD LAYS ON HIS HEART.
[1:35:39] LISTEN, EVERY ONE OF YOU DEACONS, I WANT
[1:35:41] YOU TO MAKE FOR SURE THAT YOU PRAY THAT
[1:35:44] BROTHER RON HAS NO SCARS ON HIS FACE.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; I may NOT BE PRETTY, BUT I DON'T HAVE
[1:35:51] ANY SCARS ON MY FACE.
[1:36:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; BROTHER ED CALLS SISTER CONNIE AND IT'S
[1:36:08] JUST A MIRACLE TO GET A HOLD OF HER.
[1:36:10] SHE'S STANDING PUMPING GAS AND SHE'S
[1:36:12] SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO SPOTS AND HE
[1:36:14] BRINGS HER STRONG CONSOLATION AND HE
[1:36:16] TELLS HER IN HER EAR. HE SAYS, "YOU," HE
[1:36:18] SAYS, "WE UNDERSTAND TO HEAR YOU. IT'S
[1:36:20] THE LAST TO GO." AND HE SAYS, "I WANT
[1:36:23] YOU TO WHISPER IN YOUR IN HIS EARS THESE
[1:36:25] WORDS THAT WE HAVE BOUGHT MOUNT BAKER
[1:36:28] BIBLE WAY CAMP.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MEETING NEXT
[1:36:32] YEAR AT A CERTAIN CERTAIN TIME." AND GOD
[1:36:35] HAS LAID ON OUR HEART THAT BROTHER RON
[1:36:37] IS GOING TO BE THE SPEAKER.
[1:36:49] HALLELUJAH.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? THERE'S
[1:36:53] WORDS THAT'S BEING PROJECTED
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE
[1:36:58] CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; SHE COMES IN THAT THAT LISTEN, NOT JUST
[1:37:03] AN ICU UNIT, BUT A BURN CENTER.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; AND I'M IN THE MOST CRITICAL ROOM IN THE
[1:37:08] WHOLE COMPLEX. I'M IN A GLASS ROOM IN A
[1:37:11] IN A PLACE WITH 100% CAPACITY AND I'M
[1:37:14] HAVING BAD NIGHTS AND SHE WHISPERS
[1:37:17] ACROSS HER LIPS THOSE WORDS.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with me?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME AS A HUMAN BEING
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. TO RESPOND TO THAT
[1:37:40] SITUATION. BUT THERE'S AN ETERNAL JEAN
[1:37:43] SEED OF GOD LAYING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A VOICE WITHIN THE VOICE THAT IS
[1:37:50] LAYING THERE.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; FORGIVE ME FOR MY FOLLY. THERE'S
[1:38:01] SOMETHING ANCHORING ME.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hanging on. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT
[1:38:06] THROUGH THIS. LISTEN,
[1:38:10] LET ME JUST SAY HE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
[1:38:11] IT THROUGH THIS.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW DARK YOUR TRIALS ARE.
[1:38:19] YOU WERE PREDESTINATED TO GO THROUGH
[1:38:21] THIS.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE CHANGED A COMPLETE
[1:38:26] DIRECTION. BUT GOD ALLOWS US BECAUSE
[1:38:30] HE'S GOT CONFIDENCE IN US THAT WE'LL
[1:38:33] MAKE IT THROUGH IT.
[1:38:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Are you with me now?
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. I feel like I'm 10 foot tall here
[1:38:49] just for a few minutes.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Of all of the men.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; BUDD OF ALL OF THE MEN.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; HOW GREAT DOES GOD DO TO YOU?
[1:39:04] I WISH I wasn't on internet here just
[1:39:06] for a few minutes, but I want to talk to
[1:39:08] YOU PERSONALLY. HOW GREAT IS GOD TO YOU?
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Of all OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
[1:39:15] MINISTERS, HE PICKS YOUR PASTOR TO BE
[1:39:18] SITTING IN THE CAR.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD COMES.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:39:28] VISITS HIS PROPHET,
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; HE PICKS IS THIS all right? I DON'T
[1:39:32] CARE. HE PICKED YOUR PASTOR.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; HE PICKED YOUR PASTOR TO BE THE ONE TO
[1:39:50] HELP ORCHESTRATE BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVE
[1:39:53] THE PROPHET A VISION. YOU'LL KILL AN
[1:39:55] ANIMAL CHOCOLATE AND HAVE 42 IN HORNS.
[1:39:59] AND THEN BEFORE HE GETS BACK TO
[1:40:01] CAMPSITE, HE'S GOING TO KILL A SILVER
[1:40:03] TIP GRIZZLY BEAR.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THERE'S NOT A GUIDE IN
[1:40:08] CANADA OR IN AMERICA OR IN AFRICA THAT
[1:40:11] CAN PRE-ARRANGE THAT KIND OF A TRIP.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S THE SAME KIND OF GOD THAT
[1:40:16] TURNED AROUND TO A TO A DISCIPLE THAT
[1:40:19] HAD A HABIT OF CARRYING A HOOK WITH A
[1:40:21] WITH A STRING ON IT.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAXES. GO DOWN AND
[1:40:25] DO SOME FISHING, PETER.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU PUT IT IN A CERTAIN
[1:40:30] SPOT.
[1:40:31] YOU'RE GOING TO PULL OUT A FISH, OPEN
[1:40:33] HIS MOUTH. IT'S GOING TO HAVE MONEY IN
[1:40:35] IT.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY YOUR TAXES.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here tonight, parents,
[1:40:49] and you may be going through a financial
[1:40:51] disaster, and there's no way in the
[1:40:53] world physically you can MEET YOUR
[1:40:54] NEEDS. PUT IT IN GOD'S HANDS.
[1:41:02] QUIT WRESTLING WITH IT. PUT IT IN GOD'S
[1:41:04] HANDS. GOD SIGNED A COVENANT WITH YOU.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD. OUR GOD.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; We don't have to HAVE AN IMAGINARY GOD.
[1:41:20] WE GOT A GOD THAT'S ON THE SCENE.
[1:41:23] WE HAVE A GOD THAT IS AMONG US RIGHT NOW
[1:41:26] IN THIS BUILDING.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SERVING A REVIVAL OF 500 YEARS
[1:41:30] AGO OR 200 YEARS AGO OR 50 YEARS AGO.
[1:41:32] OUR GOD IS RIGHT AMONG US RIGHT NOW.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; And God's pre-planning.
[1:41:52] He sees a boy in a checkered shirt
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; THAT HIS WIFE WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW
[1:41:56] AWAY. You know these stories over and
[1:41:59] over AND YOU'VE HEARD IT. YOU'VE HEARD
[1:42:01] IT LIP TO EAR to you.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; AND WHY DID GOD ALLOW YOU TO BE A PART
[1:42:05] OF THAT? ARE YOU WITH ME? TO SUPPORT
[1:42:07] THAT.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT GOD ORDAINS,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD ELECTS, ARE YOU WITH ME NOW?
[1:42:19] YES.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You've heard brother Brown quote it
[1:42:25] hundreds of times as they're walking
[1:42:27] back down the mountain. I see no grizzly
[1:42:29] bear. I see no silver tip.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Are you doubting the vision?
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:40] How in the world could the rapture take
[1:42:41] place? Are you doubting the vision?
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; HOW WILL WE SIT AT A TABLE A THOUSAND
[1:42:47] MILES LONG? ARE YOU DOUBTING THIS?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; OH NO.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; OH NO.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; IF I COULD TALK TO HIM PERSONALLY, I'D
[1:42:55] SAY I LAID IN A COMA FOR 4 WEEKS AND GOD
[1:42:58] KNEW I WAS GOING TO PREACH ABOUT NINE
[1:43:00] MONTHS LATER.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I came here. I preached
[1:43:19] at that time. You didn't realize it, but
[1:43:21] I was still suffering with a lung
[1:43:23] condition
[1:43:24] because my lungs were so scarred.
[1:43:28] God gave us grace.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; God blessed us.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; But you see, God is mindful.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; He is extremely mindful.
[1:43:38] your pastor.
[1:43:40] We went to North Carolina the week the
[1:43:42] two weeks later at brother Joe Green's
[1:43:45] meeting.
[1:43:50] It was
[1:43:52] it was either Thursday night or Friday
[1:43:54] night. I believe it was Friday night.
[1:43:57] I was s set sitting it's kind of a
[1:43:59] theater type setting and there's a
[1:44:02] balcony area that actually wraps around
[1:44:05] and I was sitting on the left side if
[1:44:07] you were looking at the back of the
[1:44:08] building and I sitting on the left side
[1:44:10] with sister Connie and my father-in-law
[1:44:13] and my mother-in-law
[1:44:16] and I was sitting there and I was wore
[1:44:18] out
[1:44:20] and at that time I was struggling just
[1:44:22] to go up steps
[1:44:24] to run on a treadmill would be out of
[1:44:26] the question.
[1:44:28] I had not been able to ride a bicycle,
[1:44:31] which is one of my passions to do
[1:44:34] because I just didn't have the lung
[1:44:35] strength to do it.
[1:44:38] Doctors were telling me different things
[1:44:41] that I should be happy with what I had.
[1:44:44] But the Lord said, he said, "I am the
[1:44:46] Lord that health thee."
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And I understand something about God. He
[1:44:52] doesn't do halfway work.
[1:44:57] Brother Biscll begins to preach.
[1:45:01] And as he begins to preach, he preaches
[1:45:03] on bringing order out of chaos.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And he talks about the earth and how
[1:45:10] this earth is without form and void. AND
[1:45:12] GOD BEGINS TO SPEAK to the earth. You've
[1:45:15] you've probably heard him preach that
[1:45:17] same sermon. He begins to speak to the
[1:45:19] earth and God has a vision of what it's
[1:45:21] going to be like and he begins to bring
[1:45:23] it forth.
[1:45:24] And then brother Briscoll goes to the
[1:45:26] I've told this many other places so I
[1:45:28] can rehearse it easy. And and he begins
[1:45:31] to go to the spirit realm and how that
[1:45:33] we go through different things in our
[1:45:34] life like brother Tim talked about this
[1:45:36] morning. Many things that we go through
[1:45:38] and depression and nervousness and and
[1:45:41] anxiety and strains of our life AND AND
[1:45:44] GOD SPEAKS TO IT AND HE BEGINS TO BRING
[1:45:46] THAT BACK INTO ORDER.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE COMES TO THE PHYSICAL REALM
[1:45:51] AND SOMETHING QUICKENS IN MY HEART.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I AM SITTING HERE AT THE RIGHT TIME.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD IN THE
[1:46:01] BUILDING.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; I'M AWARE OF WHAT THE DOCTORS HAVE SAID.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; I'M AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY IN THIS
[1:46:08] CONDITION. BUT HE SAID, "I AM THE GOD
[1:46:11] THAT HEALTH THEE."
[1:46:14] AND AS THE WORD BE TO GO FORTH IN THAT
[1:46:17] VERY SECTION OF MINISTRY, I GRABBED A
[1:46:20] HOLD OF IT. AND JUST AS CONGRESSMAN
[1:46:22] UPSHAW HAD SAID, JUST AS A LITTLE
[1:46:24] MEXICAN GIRL THOUGHT, JUST AS THE
[1:46:27] MEXICAN MAN AND THOUSANDS AND TEN
[1:46:29] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT STEP BEFORE
[1:46:32] BROTHER BRANDHAM.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO, BROTHER BIS IS NOT
[1:46:36] BROTHER BRHAM. AND NO, I'M NOT BROTHER
[1:46:38] BIS OR BROTHER BRHAM. I CAN'T I CAN'T
[1:46:41] CARRY THEIR LUNCH BOX. WELL, LET ME JUST
[1:46:42] SAY THIS TO YOU. THE GOD THAT LIVED IN
[1:46:44] WILLIAM BRANA,
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; THE VOICE THAT WAS BEHIND THE VOICE,
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; THE MAZDC OF THIS AGE,
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY ANGEL
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; DID NOT DIE IN 1965.
[1:47:06] BUT THERE'S A MINISTRY ON THE EARTH
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; THAT IS ANOINTED TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE
[1:47:12] AND SWEEP IT TO THE COMING OF THE LORD.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU TONIGHT, YOU'VE GOT A
[1:47:19] CHECKBOOK.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A WORD FROM GOD.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IT'S OUR OPPORTUNITY TO
[1:47:26] RESPOND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT AND SAY,
[1:47:28] "RIGHT NOW'S MY TIME.
[1:47:36] HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; God gave me this one. So, I'm going to
[1:47:40] deliver it to you.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I was there when my father had his
[1:47:45] fingers cut off and literally rolled
[1:47:47] them off and the doctor looked, he had
[1:47:49] about 10 guys standing around him and he
[1:47:51] was training the other doctors said,
[1:47:53] "Well, this is what we do when a man
[1:47:56] gets his fingers rolled off like that.
[1:47:57] We just make nubs off of them, pull skin
[1:47:59] over top of them.
[1:48:02] And I heard him say it. I said, "Just a
[1:48:04] moment. If I could have your if I could
[1:48:06] talk to you just a minute." He said,
[1:48:07] "Yes, sir." I said, "Who are you?" And I
[1:48:08] said, "I'm Charles Spencer's son."
[1:48:14] And you got him on morphine and he can't
[1:48:16] speak for himself. But I want to tell
[1:48:19] you what we've been taught by a prophet
[1:48:20] of the Lord.
[1:48:22] We've been taught by a prophet of the
[1:48:24] Lord
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; that said you were God's agent on the
[1:48:28] earth
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; that God anoints your gift because your
[1:48:33] care for humanity
[1:48:35] and we COME HERE WITH THE CONFIDENCE FOR
[1:48:37] YOU TO PUT THOSE FINGERS BACK ON. AND WE
[1:48:40] BELIEVE THAT GOD WILL HEAL THOSE
[1:48:42] FINGERS.
[1:48:46] THAT MAN TURNED TO HIS INTERNS AND HE
[1:48:48] SAID, "THEN WHAT WE MUST DO RIGHT NOW IS
[1:48:50] GO PUT SOME FINGERS ON."
[1:48:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; I'LL JUST TELL YOU THIS STORY JUST VERY
[1:49:04] QUICKLY. LET ME JUST SAY WHEN THE DOCTOR
[1:49:05] HE WENT BACK ABOUT 7 TO 10 DAYS LATER
[1:49:08] AND HE UNWRAPPED THOSE FINGERS, THEY
[1:49:10] WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK AND BLUE.
[1:49:12] THOSE FINGERS NEVER even bruised.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? MY FATHER-IN-LAW WHO
[1:49:28] BROTHER FRASIER, brother Frasier, who
[1:49:30] brother Biscll has met many times and
[1:49:32] and listen, if you're just around
[1:49:34] brother Homer any minute OF TIME, YOU
[1:49:37] REALIZE that brother Homer really needed
[1:49:38] to be saved.
[1:49:44] Hallelujah.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; He's kind of man that when he looks at
[1:49:51] you when I WAS A BOY, I WAS GETTING
[1:49:53] ready to marry his daughter. He said,
[1:49:55] "We need to go to the gas building." And
[1:49:57] I thought, "Well, no, I don't want to go
[1:49:58] to the gas building." And he looks at
[1:50:01] says, "Brother Ron, we're going to the
[1:50:03] gas building." I don't have no reason to
[1:50:05] go to the gas building. We're going to
[1:50:07] the gas building.
[1:50:10] and he points that 45 looks like a 9 mm
[1:50:14] finger.
[1:50:27] Don't you never lay a hand on her or
[1:50:30] you'll have to face me.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, I don't care if she'd pull a gun
[1:50:35] and shoot me. I wouldn't lay a hand on
[1:50:37] her.
[1:50:43] God bless you, Brother Homer.
[1:50:49] Brother Homer,
[1:50:52] I was preaching at Brother Jeff Jenkins
[1:50:57] and it would take God to wake me up at
[1:50:59] 3:00 in the morning, get me to drive
[1:51:01] home. And I woke up at three and I just
[1:51:05] felt impressed to drive, start driving.
[1:51:08] I start talking to Connie in the
[1:51:11] morning. She said, 'What are you doing
[1:51:12] on the road?' And I said, 'I don't know.
[1:51:13] The Lord must have woke me up and sent
[1:51:15] me home. And I was awake as much as I am
[1:51:17] standing here. I hope as awake as you
[1:51:20] are.
[1:51:22] And I begin to drive
[1:51:24] and I drove and I get there just in time
[1:51:26] to eat a little supper. I eat supper
[1:51:29] with them. Brother Homer says, "You want
[1:51:31] to go, honey?" No. No. I I haven't even
[1:51:34] unpacked my bags. I hope you have a good
[1:51:36] evening.
[1:51:38] And I start home and he starts towards
[1:51:40] the woods
[1:51:42] and within about 20 minutes he calls me.
[1:51:44] He said, "Brother Ron," he said, "Where
[1:51:46] are you at?" And I told him I was going
[1:51:48] up the road to the house. He said, "I
[1:51:49] fell out of the tree.
[1:51:53] I need you to bring a canvas and get the
[1:51:56] boys and carry me out of the woods."
[1:52:00] First of all, Brother Homer weighs about
[1:52:02] 230 lbs. He's just a bit over six foot
[1:52:04] tall. He's a man.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe 70 a couple years old, but he's a
[1:52:08] man.
[1:52:11] And he said, uh, I can't feel my legs.
[1:52:16] When I get there, his leg is laying on
[1:52:18] his back
[1:52:21] and he's white as a ghost. And we begin
[1:52:23] to pray and we feel the presence of the
[1:52:25] Lord.
[1:52:27] When the rescue team comes, they they
[1:52:29] they don't even know how to move him
[1:52:32] because his pelvis is shattered all the
[1:52:35] way through. We would later see that it
[1:52:38] was just literally mangled bone and
[1:52:41] shattered bones. They bring in
[1:52:43] architects and they begin to restructure
[1:52:45] with metal and all kinds of screws and
[1:52:48] all kinds of And here was his statement.
[1:52:52] I'll preach again,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll dance again.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I did this to THIS TO MYSELF. ARE YOU
[1:53:04] WITH me now?
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Incredible pain,
[1:53:09] incredible rehabilitation.
[1:53:12] BUT TO LOOK AT IT, NO WAY.
[1:53:16] NO WAY WOULD YOU EVER THINK HE'LL EVER
[1:53:18] WALK AGAIN.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; BUT WE HAVE A HIGH POSITION.
[1:53:23] AMEN.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; We have a HIGH PHYSICIAN.
[1:53:28] AND LISTEN, EVEN AS HE'LL PREACH FOR ME
[1:53:31] THIS WEEKEND,
[1:53:33] LISTEN, WE HAVE THE KIND OF PHYSICIAN
[1:53:34] THAT CAN WALK INTO A HOSPITAL ROOM
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN DOCTORS ARE SHAKING THEIR HEAD AND
[1:53:41] CAN'T PUT THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. WE HAVE A
[1:53:44] HIGH PHYSICIAN THAT CAN WALK INTO A
[1:53:46] HOSPITAL ROOM. WHEN THEY GIVE NO HOPE,
[1:53:49] WE CAN HAVE HOPE.
[1:53:55] YOU FORGIVE me for taking my time here
[1:53:57] just for a few minutes.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Well, ONE OF MY DEACONS CALLS ME AND
[1:54:00] SAYS, "MY LITTLE BOY'S GOT A FEVER."
[1:54:02] LATER ON, HE'S GOT A HIGHER FEVER.
[1:54:04] BEFORE LONG, HE'S GOT A HIGHER FEVER.
[1:54:06] LONG AND SHORT OF IT, FROM THAT MORNING
[1:54:08] TILL THAT EVENING, THEY'VE GOT HIM IN AN
[1:54:10] ICU UNIT IN IN the university hospital.
[1:54:13] And the doctor walks IN AFTER QUITE A
[1:54:15] SPELL AND SAYS HIS TEMPERATURE HAS WENT
[1:54:18] TO A LEVEL until it has caused brain
[1:54:20] damage.
[1:54:23] AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS MORNING
[1:54:25] EVERYTHING'S BEEN WELL.
[1:54:27] A FEVER STRIKES AND NOW IT'S TO THIS
[1:54:29] POINT.
[1:54:32] LISTEN, 24 HOURS.
[1:54:34] WHAT A DIFFERENCE 24 HOURS CAN MAKE.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Let me just say THIS TO YOU. YOU'RE
[1:54:40] YOUNG AND YOU FEEL GOOD TODAY, BUT 24
[1:54:42] HOURS CAN MAKE AN INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CLAUS ME. AND HE SAID,
[1:54:49] "BROTHER RON, THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE TOLD
[1:54:51] ME." I SAID, "THE SCRIPTURE ISAIAH SAID,
[1:54:54] WHOSE REPORT DO WE BELIEVE?"
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; AND I WALK IN THERE. I WALK IN THERE AND
[1:55:03] WE BEGIN TO PRAY AND I TAKE A
[1:55:05] HANDKERCHIEF THAT WE'VE ANOINTED BECAUSE
[1:55:08] THAT'S WHAT ACTS 19 TELLS US TO DO. AND
[1:55:10] WE LAY HANDS ON THAT LITTLE BOY AND WE
[1:55:13] PRAY FOR THAT LITTLE BOY AND WITHIN 50
[1:55:16] MINUTES THAT LITTLE BOY IS BACK IN HIS
[1:55:18] RIGHT MIND.
[1:55:31] HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Let the redeemed say so.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S AN AWESOME GOD.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; We have a man sitting in this tent
[1:55:49] tonight. I'm not GOING TO POINT HIM OUT,
[1:55:51] BUT HIS SISTER, HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT HER
[1:55:53] TWO years living with another woman, HAD
[1:55:56] MOVED STATES AWAY. AND SHE WALKS TO THE
[1:55:59] ALTAR AND SAYS, "I WANT MY HUSBAND BACK.
[1:56:01] I WANT HIM TO BE A REAL CHRISTIAN.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; WE PRAY. WE PRAY. IT'S NOT A HUNDRED
[1:56:07] PEOPLE PRAYING. WE PRAY."
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; FOR THE SCRIPTURE SAID, "WHATSOEVER
[1:56:13] THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, ON
[1:56:16] TUESDAY, THAT MAN'S BACK AND HE SAID,
[1:56:18] "SUNDAY ABOUT A CERTAIN CERTAIN TIME,
[1:56:20] SOMETHING SPOKE TO ME TO GO HOME.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE IF YOU'LL HAVE ME." THE NEXT
[1:56:24] WEEK, I'M PREACHING AT A CHURCH. THAT
[1:56:27] MAN IS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE AND HERE
[1:56:29] HE COMES RUNNING TO THE ALTAR.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; I just share this with you. I WAS
[1:56:52] SITTING ON A BALCONY. WE WAS TAKING A
[1:56:55] FEW DAYS HOLIDAY. And something
[1:56:57] impressed ME TO GET UP AND go to the
[1:56:58] door and look out AND HERE COMES BROTHER
[1:57:01] JOEL Ray just say just all right here
[1:57:03] he's coming walking down the walking
[1:57:05] down the aisle and he's he's walking
[1:57:08] down the this this hallway. Come on in
[1:57:11] here. Come on in here. We've already had
[1:57:13] this meeting.
[1:57:18] He comes in. He sits down with me and
[1:57:21] we're enjoying the day and all of a
[1:57:23] sudden I begin to feel the presence of
[1:57:25] the Lord and I begin to speak to him.
[1:57:32] Before long
[1:57:34] he begin something be to move
[1:57:39] like brother Tim preached this morning
[1:57:41] without a whole lot of emotion God moves
[1:57:43] us from one stage of our life to the
[1:57:45] next.
[1:57:47] And he takes a boy that's very confused.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; He's got a lot of scattered directions
[1:57:53] and clears it right up.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; That's our God.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Not a whole bunch of explanations of
[1:58:09] quotes and psychologist sitting around
[1:58:12] saying this is the direction you need to
[1:58:13] go.
[1:58:15] Brother Ron, I'm worried about my
[1:58:16] children. They're on drugs. Just Just
[1:58:18] let them GET IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR GOD.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, MY MARRIAGE IS ALL TO
[1:58:23] PIECES. JUST GET IN THE PRESENCE OF OUR
[1:58:25] GOD.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; In that same meeting, MY BOYS HAD CAME
[1:58:31] HERE BECAUSE OF OF BROTHER BISCLL'S
[1:58:33] VISION. I BROUGHT MY BOYS BECAUSE MY SON
[1:58:35] HAD SAVED MY LIFE. THE OTHER SON HAD
[1:58:37] TOOK ME TO THE RESCUE AND AND AND IT
[1:58:39] MADE US A TIGHTER FAMILY. WE STILL ARE.
[1:58:42] BUT MY SECOND SON DIDN'T HAVE WHAT HE
[1:58:44] NEEDED. HE WAS MARRIED, BUT HE DIDN'T
[1:58:45] HAVE WHAT HE NEEDED. YOU KNOW WHAT I
[1:58:47] MEAN?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE A STAGE IN MY LIFE, I DIDN'T
[1:58:50] HAVE WHAT I NEEDED.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; I KNEW GOD SENT A PROPHET. I KNEW THE
[1:58:55] DOCTRINES OF THE WORD, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
[1:58:56] WHAT I NEEDED.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, WHAT MOSES LACKED WAS INSIDE
[1:59:00] OF THAT BURNING BUSH.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; AND HIS WIFE SAID ABOUT WHERE BROTHER
[1:59:06] JOEL IS SITTING. AND SHE SAT THERE TWO
[1:59:08] YEARS AGO. AND SHE SAT THERE AND SHE
[1:59:10] SHOUTED AND SHE HOLLERED AND SHE
[1:59:12] SCREAMED AND SOME ASKED, "HAS SHE DID
[1:59:14] THAT MANY TIMES?" IT WAS HER FIRST TIME.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; IT WAS HER FIRST TIME.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; ANDREW SAT THERE AND HE WAS JUST KIND OF
[1:59:25] NUMB BY ALL THE EVENTS THAT WERE GOING
[1:59:26] ON AROUND HIM. BUT WE WENT TO WE WENT
[1:59:29] AND TOOK A FEW DAYS HOLIDAY THIS WITHIN
[1:59:31] HOURS OF MY TALKING TO TO BROTHER JOEL.
[1:59:35] LISTEN, I HAD NOT TALKED TO BROTHER TOM.
[1:59:38] BROTHER ANDREW DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
[1:59:39] WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE EARLIER IN THE DAY.
[1:59:41] AND WE'RE STANDING IN THE STREET.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER ANDREW TURNS TO BROTHER TOM
[1:59:46] AND BEGINS TO TALK TO HIM AND OPENS UP
[1:59:48] HIS HEART.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; OPENS UP HIS HEART. LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE
[1:59:53] BYPASSING HIM LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE. BUT
[1:59:56] GOD CAME DOWN.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME DOWN.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; GOD MET MY SON.
[2:00:09] OUR GOD.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'VE GOT THE PICTURES ON
[2:00:16] THE WALL OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR GOD,
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT OUR GOD LIVING ON THE
[2:00:22] INSIDE OF US.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's why I say this to you. DON'T
[2:00:31] NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GIVE UP ON
[2:00:33] YOUR CHILDREN.
[2:00:37] BOO DEVIL
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ENEMY WILL TRY TO CRUSH
[2:00:42] THEM. HE'LL TRY TO ABUSE THEM. HE'LL TRY
[2:00:45] TO PUT DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND PORNOGRAPHY
[2:00:47] AND THE WRONG KIND OF PEOPLE AROUND THEM
[2:00:49] AND SMOTHER THEM.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T NEVER GIVE UP ON THEM.
[2:00:56] AMEN.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; And I say this tonight, at the turn of
[2:01:06] this last year, God be to deal with
[2:01:08] Andrew. And Andrew now is a minister of
[2:01:11] this gospel.
[2:01:13] Hallelujah.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; You see, THIS IS A SUPERNATURAL GOSPEL.
[2:01:41] IT WAS SUPERNATURAL TO THE CHILDREN OF
[2:01:43] ISRAEL.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD GIVE YOU HOUSES YOU DIDN'T
[2:01:46] BUILD. OUR GOD GIVE YOU VINEYARDS YOU
[2:01:49] DIDN'T PLANT.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH. OUR GOD STOOD
[2:01:54] THERE AND SAID, "I AM HE THAT HAD THE
[2:01:56] KEYS OF DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. AND
[2:01:58] I AM ALIVE FOREVER MORE. I AM ALPHA AND
[2:02:00] OMEGA."
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD STOOD STEPPED FORTH WHEN THE
[2:02:05] MIGHTY ANGEL SAID, "WHO IS WORTHY TO
[2:02:07] TAKE THE BOOK?" OUR GOD STEPPED
[2:02:11] HE BECAME MY KINSMAN REDEEMER.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT 10 MILLION MILES AWAY.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; The requirement if two or three are
[2:02:21] gathered, TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED. TWO
[2:02:24] OR THREE ARE GATHERED IN MY NAME, I'LL
[2:02:26] BE IN THE MIDST. WE HAVE COME WITH GREAT
[2:02:28] EXPECTATION.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe you WASN'T EXPECTING THIS TONIGHT,
[2:02:36] BUT I TELL YOU, HE'S HERE. HE DEALT WITH
[2:02:39] MY HEART. I WANT TO SAY THIS TO YOU.
[2:02:41] SURE, HE WAS HERE 2,000 YEARS AGO AND
[2:02:44] HANG ON THE CROSS. HE WAS HERE AND HE
[2:02:46] RESURRECTED. BUT OUR GOD IS HERE
[2:02:48] TONIGHT.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Can you give me about five more minutes?
[2:03:08] Ron, but you just don't know my
[2:03:10] circumstances.
[2:03:19] I want you to listen to the prophet of
[2:03:21] God's words. The devil hates me.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, I KNOW HE HATES YOU, TOO.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; You ever feel that?
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; He's my enemy.
[2:03:34] BUT AS LONG AS GOD IS MY FRIEND, I DON'T
[2:03:36] HAVE NO FEAR OF HIM.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Why did Stonewall Jackson could sit
[2:03:47] there on his horse with a confidence? He
[2:03:49] said, "I'm as safe on the battlefield as
[2:03:51] I am at home in my bed."
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; For always say to be absent from this
[2:03:58] body is to be present with the Lord.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; I stepped off of the stage one night and
[2:04:08] brother Lonnie Jenkins shook my hand and
[2:04:09] he said, "Brother Ron, you make that
[2:04:11] look so easy."
[2:04:14] He said, "While you're smiling and
[2:04:16] you're cutting our hearts out
[2:04:19] doing heart surgery,
[2:04:22] I enjoy cutting the devils away.
[2:04:35] The devil hates me and I know he hates
[2:04:37] you, too.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; And he's my HE'S MY ENEMY. BUT AS LONG
[2:04:41] AS GOD IS MY FRIEND, I HAVE NO FEAR OF
[2:04:43] HIM. I JUST DRIVE HIM RIGHT BACK AND
[2:04:46] TAKE THE WORD of God and move him right
[2:04:48] back out of his out of the place that he
[2:04:50] THINKS HE'S A HOLDING. HE HASN'T GOT NO
[2:04:53] STRONGHOLDS. HE'S ABSOLUTELY LEGALLY
[2:04:55] DEFEATED IN EVERY PLACE. THE DEVIL
[2:04:57] HASN'T GOT ONE LEGAL RIGHT AT ALL.
[2:05:00] NOWHERE. HE'S JUST A DEVIL AND A
[2:05:03] PASSWORD. THAT'S ALL. HE HASN'T GOT NO
[2:05:05] LEGAL RIGHT TO ANY MAN THAT'LL ACCEPT
[2:05:08] THE PROMISE OF JESUS CHRIST. HE'S
[2:05:10] WHIPPED.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; He's whiffed IN SICKNESS. HE'S WHIFFED
[2:05:17] IN DISAPPOINTMENTS. HE'S WHIFFED IN
[2:05:20] EVERYTHING. HE'S WHIFFED IN DEATH. HE
[2:05:23] CAN'T SCARE ME. HE CAN'T SCARE YOU.
[2:05:25] THAT'S ALL HE IS. HE'S JUST A BIG OLD
[2:05:27] SHADOW.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brown and pray. Oh
[2:05:33] Satan, YOU WHO HAVE BOUND THE SICK, COME
[2:05:35] OUT OF THE PEOPLE. YOU'RE DEFEATED
[2:05:37] BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPOSED. CHRIST IS RAISED
[2:05:40] FROM THE DEAD AND IS ALIVE TONIGHT and
[2:05:42] forever more. HE SAYS, "AND WE DECLARE
[2:05:44] UNTO YOU THAT YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS.
[2:05:47] CHRIST STRIPPED YOU OF EVERYTHING THAT
[2:05:49] YOU HAD AT CALVARY AND IN HIS GRACE,
[2:05:51] VICARIOUS SUFFERING, AND IN HIS DEATH,
[2:05:53] HIS TRIUMPH OF RESURRECTION. HIS
[2:05:55] APPEARING HERE TONIGHT HAS BROUGHT US
[2:05:57] THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'S A LIVING AND
[2:06:00] HE'S ANOINTED US
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; AND HIS PRESENCE IS HERE NOW. AND SATAN,
[2:06:08] YOU CAN'T HOLD THEM ANY LONGER.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THEM IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[2:06:14] CHRIST.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; You've heard this before. I'll say it
[2:06:16] again. And the word of God will DEFEAT
[2:06:18] THE ENEMY ANY PLACE.
[2:06:22] ANYWHERE.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ANYTIME.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. No matter if he was in a
[2:06:43] storm of the gales and knocking the boat
[2:06:44] from one side to the other and he was
[2:06:46] standing in the face of a mess of
[2:06:47] demons. If he was hanging anywhere, it
[2:06:50] never moved him. He walked on just as
[2:06:52] calm and quiet as he could be. Why? He
[2:06:55] was simply unconscious of fear or
[2:06:57] anything around him.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; He said whether it's going to happen or
[2:07:04] whether it wasn't going to happen. He
[2:07:06] knowed it was going to happen because
[2:07:07] God said so. He didn't say, "I wonder if
[2:07:10] I prayed long enough. I wonder if I
[2:07:12] fasted long enough. I wonder if I did
[2:07:14] this or that." He just simply walked
[2:07:16] right on unconscious. That's right. He
[2:07:19] believed what God said was the truth.
[2:07:21] The words must BE FULFILLED. HE KNOWED
[2:07:24] WHAT HIS LIFE WAS TO FULFILL THEM. HE
[2:07:26] WAS PERFECTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FAITH
[2:07:28] THAT HE HAD. HE JUST SPOKE IT AND KNEW
[2:07:31] THAT IT WOULD BE SO.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. BROTHER SAID, "I'M SO
[2:07:36] GLAD THAT A MAN CAN SO COMPLETELY SERVE
[2:07:39] GOD TILL THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
[2:07:42] WITH HIM."
[2:07:47] OH YEAH. FAITH KNOWS NO DEFEAT. FAITH IS
[2:07:50] PERFECT. FAITH BRINGS THINGS WHEN
[2:07:52] THERE'S NO THINGS TO BE BROUGHT. FAITH
[2:07:54] CREATES. FAITH TAKES DOUBTS AWAY. TAKES
[2:07:57] NEGATIVE AND MAKES IT POSITIVE.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:08:04] PERFECT FAITH IS A MASTER TO ALL
[2:08:07] CIRCUMSTANCES.
[2:08:09] PERFECT FAITH MASTERS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.
[2:08:12] NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IT MASTERS IT ALL.
[2:08:15] WHEN YOU BELIEVE ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING,
[2:08:16] YOU GOT FAITH IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING. NO
[2:08:18] MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE IS, THAT
[2:08:21] DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT
[2:08:22] MASTERS THE CIRCUMSTANCE.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; Notice the statement. And we BECOME
[2:08:28] ANOINTED WITH THAT SAME SPIRIT, ANOINTED
[2:08:31] MESSIAHS, MESSIAHS OF THE LAST day to
[2:08:34] shine forth the resurrection of Jesus
[2:08:36] CHRIST TO SHOW THAT HE'S NOT DEAD.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; OUR GOD THAT WAS IN A CAR. OUR GOD THAT
[2:08:52] SAW A 42IN HORNS ON A CARIBOU. OUR GOD
[2:08:56] THAT SAW A GRIZZLY BEAR. OUR GOD THAT
[2:08:58] SAW A BOY IN DEAD TH HIT BY A CAR AT 60
[2:09:02] M AN HOUR. OUR GOD SAW ALL OF THAT.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OUR GOD THAT SAW THE
[2:09:09] ACCIDENT I WOULD BE IN. OUR GOD.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:25] I am the God of Abraham,
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; the God of Isaac, THE GOD OF JACOB.
[2:09:34] And Moses hid his face, for he was
[2:09:36] afraid to look upon God. Let's bow our
[2:09:39] heads.
[2:09:51] Lord Jesus,
[2:09:58] as we stand here this evening,
[2:10:06] I did my best to behave myself,
[2:10:09] but Lord, there's something about it
[2:10:10] gets me excited
[2:10:14] when I think about the things that we
[2:10:16] have seen you do.
[2:10:22] We have seen you work one miracle after
[2:10:25] another miracle.
[2:10:29] Lord, in this message that has been
[2:10:31] brought to us,
[2:10:34] supernatural vindication to it,
[2:10:38] it was more than just a pillar of fire
[2:10:43] joining our prophet
[2:10:45] in Houston.
[2:10:48] It was more than just to a boy in
[2:10:49] Finland. It was more than just a Hatty
[2:10:52] Wright's children.
[2:10:54] It was more than just a congressman
[2:10:56] upshaw.
[2:10:58] It was a revealed word to this bride,
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we become anointed with that
[2:11:04] word and step into this word of this
[2:11:06] day.
[2:11:07] We sit in this building tonight and
[2:11:09] aware that we're literally walking
[2:11:12] within the vision of your mind.
[2:11:16] And Lord, IN OUR HUMANITY, WE SOMETIMES
[2:11:18] feel like quitting.
[2:11:21] We get discouraged.
[2:11:26] Circumstances of LIFE SEEM TO TURN US
[2:11:28] UPSIDE DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS TRIES TO
[2:11:30] PREVAIL.
[2:11:33] BUT LORD, GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN US
[2:11:35] THAN HE THAT IS IN the world.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, TONIGHT WE'VE HEARD THE WORD
[2:11:41] SAY God will defeat the enemy anywhere,
[2:11:45] any place, anytime.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see the conditions behind
[2:11:50] every heart and every hand that would be
[2:11:52] here this afternoon.
[2:11:55] Lord, you know the battles that we're
[2:11:56] going through.
[2:11:59] Lord, I ask you that you'd sweep across
[2:12:01] this audience tonight.
[2:12:04] Lord, as David stood there and testified
[2:12:07] about a to a to a backsliden king,
[2:12:10] he was facing a great champion
[2:12:14] and all he had was a sling and some
[2:12:16] stones,
[2:12:17] but he had a testimony that God had gave
[2:12:20] him a bear. He had A TESTIMONY THAT GOD
[2:12:22] had gave him a lion. and that God would
[2:12:25] give him Goliath.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; LORD JESUS, YOU RAISED ME OUT OF A COMA.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE DOCTOR SAID I HAD NO BRAIN
[2:12:36] ACTIVITY FOR 36 HOURS,
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, WHEN ALL HOPE SEEMED TO BE
[2:12:42] GONE,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; your servant of THE LORD, BROTHER TIM,
[2:12:45] WALKED INTO MY ROOM
[2:12:48] AND PRAYED FOR ME.
[2:12:51] OH GOD, LORD JESUS, TONIGHT WE STAND
[2:12:54] HERE AS A TESTIMONY.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; AS MUCH AS SATAN HATES US,
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; HE HATES THE WORD THAT LIVES ON THE
[2:13:01] INSIDE OF US.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; LORD, WE'RE A TESTIMONY THAT THIS
[2:13:06] MESSAGE IS TRUE. AND IT'S MORE THAN
[2:13:08] MIRACLES.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S A LIFE THAT LIVES INSIDE OF US.
[2:13:13] IT IS A LIFE THAT KEEP THESE YOUNG GIRLS
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; IN THEIR PURITY IN THE HOLINESS OF THE
[2:13:19] WORD.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; IT'S A LIFE THAT KEEPS EVERY DEMON AWAY
[2:13:23] FROM THEM
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; THAT CAUSES YOUNG MEN TO BE REAL MEN
[2:13:28] THAT KEEPS THEM AWAY FROM PORNOGRAPHY.
[2:13:30] KEEPS HIM AWAY FROM DRUGS. KEEPS THEM
[2:13:33] CALL AWAY FROM THE WRONG KIND OF AN
[2:13:34] INFLUENCE. LORD, OUR GOD IS AN AWESOME
[2:13:37] GOD.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; And we STAND HERE TONIGHT WITH A
[2:13:40] TESTIMONY OF VICTORY.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; WE MAY NEVER SPEAK A WORLD INTO
[2:13:45] EXISTENCE. WE MAY NEVER SEE A GREAT
[2:13:48] MIRACLE BEFORE OUR EYES, BUT GOD, JUST
[2:13:51] BECAUSE WE'RE STILL STANDING, IT'S AN
[2:13:53] INCREDIBLE MIRACLE.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Oh God, tonight,
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT A VICTORY IT IS JUST TO BE HERE.
[2:14:03] LORD, I ask you, Father, that you'd go
[2:14:06] across this audience just now,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, may the f faith that has been
[2:14:13] stirred in this building,
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; may the anointing that I have felt
[2:14:17] across this audience,
[2:14:19] Lord, may that word be quickened in
[2:14:21] their hearts
[2:14:23] and may they respond, "This message was
[2:14:26] for me.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; This message was for me.
[2:14:32] MAY I GRAB A HOLD OF THIS ANCHOR TONIGHT
[2:14:34] AND hold on. No matter how bad the wind
[2:14:38] gets, NO MATTER HOW DARK the night gets,
[2:14:42] he's our God.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; Our God.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; My God.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; More than Paul's God.
[2:14:54] More than the disciples God. More than
[2:14:57] Martin Luther's God. More than JOHN
[2:14:59] WESLEY'S GOD. MORE THAN WILLIAM BRANDHAM
[2:15:02] GOD, MORE THAN MY DADDY'S GOD,
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MY GOD TONIGHT.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PERSONAL GOD TO ME.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE A PERSONAL GOD TO my
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:15:17] go to every pew. Settle this in their
[2:15:19] life right now tonight.
[2:15:22] Oh God, they have to stand alone. Let
[2:15:25] them know you're with them.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Could you stand to your feet
[2:15:30] just now? Raise your hands over your
[2:15:33] hands. God.
[2:15:36] Lord, I bring you my needs right now.
[2:15:41] It may seem impossible of what you're
[2:15:43] going through. How in the world am I
[2:15:44] going to ever get through this? I want
[2:15:47] you to give it to him right now with
[2:15:48] your lips, right where you're standing
[2:15:50] at right now.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; You have a need standing here this
[2:15:54] evening. Would you just lift it before
[2:15:56] God and say, "God, I have need of this.
[2:16:00] Hallelujah.
[2:16:02] Just bring him your needs right now
[2:16:05] WITH A GREAT EXPECTATION THAT HE'LL MEET
[2:16:07] that need.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; He'll meet that need. He knows.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HE ALREADY KNOWS. BUT ASK HIM.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; ANCHOR IN YOUR SOUL TONIGHT. WE'VE HEARD
[2:16:21] THESE TESTIMONIES.
[2:16:33] He knew WHERE YOU'D BE SITTING AT.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW WHO YOU'D BE STANDING BESIDE OF.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THE CONDITION THAT YOU'D BE IN.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Let it be settled right here tonight.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:54] He's all I need. He's all I need.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's all
[2:17:08] I need.
[2:17:11] He's all
[2:17:14] I need.
[2:17:18] Jesus
[2:17:20] is all
[2:17:23] I need.
[2:17:29] He's all
[2:17:32] I need.
[2:17:35] He all
[2:17:38] I need.
[2:17:42] Jesus
[2:17:45] is your
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Won't you just let him come to you just
[2:17:59] now?
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Our God. Our
[2:18:14] God
[2:18:16] is all
[2:18:25] I need.
[2:18:29] Jesus
[2:18:31] is all
[2:18:33] I need.
[2:18:41] All
[2:18:47] I need.
[2:18:51] Jesus
[2:18:53] is all
[2:18:56] I need.
[2:19:01] He is all
[2:19:04] I need.
[2:19:07] is all
[2:19:10] I need.
[2:19:13] Jesus
[2:19:16] is all
[2:19:18] I need.
[2:19:25] He is all
[2:19:28] I need.
[2:19:34] Jesus
[2:19:40] is all
[2:19:42] I need.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Let's just be in prayer now. Let's just
[2:19:48] be a prayer.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; He's all I need.
[2:19:54] He's all
[2:19:57] I need.
[2:20:00] Jesus
[2:20:02] is all.
[2:20:09] Look, I'd like your undivided attention.
[2:20:11] If you look this way for a few moments,
[2:20:13] the service is not over.
[2:20:17] The word has been preached and now
[2:20:19] you're going to confirm that word with
[2:20:21] signs following.
[2:20:24] There are some here, maybe a few, maybe
[2:20:26] many, I don't know. But you are at you
[2:20:29] are at your moment.
[2:20:32] God takes his word very very serious.
[2:20:36] And if he's been speaking to you, he
[2:20:38] doesn't intend for you to go out this
[2:20:40] tent without doing business with him.
[2:20:44] It doesn't have to be some big flash,
[2:20:47] some big thunder, some great uh
[2:20:51] emotional thing. When you do business
[2:20:53] with God, like brother Tim said this
[2:20:56] morning, when God dealt with him, he
[2:20:59] just became very quiet. I'll tell you
[2:21:02] the morning I was sitting in my study
[2:21:06] and I just began to get real heavy and
[2:21:08] burdened for Sister Connie.
[2:21:12] And I then my mind thought because now
[2:21:14] my heart was burdened. I knew it was the
[2:21:17] Holy Spirit. And I I thought her husband
[2:21:22] who's the head of her home and her life
[2:21:25] is hanging just on a thread between life
[2:21:28] and death. And her son is also burned
[2:21:32] badly and she's she's alone and the Holy
[2:21:37] Spirit
[2:21:39] says call her.
[2:21:43] And I looked up the phone number and the
[2:21:45] only phone number I had was her home.
[2:21:48] And right away your mind starts to
[2:21:50] reason and the enemy is saying, you
[2:21:53] know, she's not home.
[2:21:56] And I said, I I know she's not home, but
[2:21:58] I it's the only number I have and I'm
[2:22:00] going to call her home. I called her
[2:22:03] home number and she picked up the phone
[2:22:06] and I said, "Sister Connie, where are
[2:22:10] you?"
[2:22:11] She says, "I'm between two hospitals." I
[2:22:14] said, "But I called your home phone
[2:22:16] number." And she said, "I had it
[2:22:18] forwarded to myself."
[2:22:20] And she says, "I'm between two
[2:22:22] hospitals. My son is in one and my
[2:22:25] husband is in the other." I said, "We've
[2:22:28] been following close the condition of
[2:22:31] brother Ron and I know that the
[2:22:33] condition that he's in." I said, "Right
[2:22:36] now," I said, "My burden is for you
[2:22:40] because you haven't had any headship."
[2:22:42] And and and and
[2:22:44] you know what? I want you to tell you
[2:22:46] one thing that God is mindful of you
[2:22:48] right now. He's mindful.
[2:22:52] Listen folks, God's not only mindful of
[2:22:55] Connie, he's mindful of you where you
[2:22:57] are right this minute.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; He knew that you were going to be in
[2:23:01] this service. He knew that you were
[2:23:03] going to hear this message and all of
[2:23:06] these supernatural testimonies, as
[2:23:08] brother Ron has said, not of 2,000 years
[2:23:11] ago or even 50 years ago. Right now,
[2:23:15] you're looking at the evidence. You are
[2:23:16] eyewitness of it.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; And perhaps there's something stirring
[2:23:22] in your heart and saying, "God, I need
[2:23:25] to do business with you.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; I need to do business with you. This
[2:23:29] thing has hung on to my life long
[2:23:32] enough, and I'm here." Maybe someone's
[2:23:35] here still living in sin as an
[2:23:37] unbeliever. Listen to me, friends.
[2:23:40] Listen to me. The time is now. The time
[2:23:43] is up.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; It's our God that wants to deliver you.
[2:23:47] I'm not going to beg for you to come if
[2:23:50] you haven't got enough sense to come and
[2:23:52] you'll have to stay bound in sin. But if
[2:23:55] you want to be delivered from it, I'm
[2:23:57] saying that God IS HERE NOW, OUR GOD,
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; and you can pass by here AND NEVER BE
[2:24:03] THE SAME AGAIN.
[2:24:07] And I said to Sister Connie, "Sister
[2:24:09] Connie,
[2:24:12] we've just bought a camp."
[2:24:14] And I know from the medical people, from
[2:24:17] talking to them, that when a man or a
[2:24:19] person is in deep unconscious state, the
[2:24:22] last sense that leaves them is their
[2:24:24] hearing. I want you to go up to brother
[2:24:27] Ron's ear and you say to him, "Brother
[2:24:31] Biscll and the people have just bought a
[2:24:33] camp and he is going to preach next year
[2:24:37] in that camp, the camp meeting." And you
[2:24:40] speak that in his ear. Hallelujah. And
[2:24:43] friends, it wasn't just an emotion. It
[2:24:46] happened.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; It happened EXACTLY THAT WAY. AND YOU'RE
[2:24:50] AN EYEWITNESS TO IT. And many of you
[2:24:52] were here in this tent. You don't know
[2:24:54] THE BACKGROUND, BUT THAT'S WHAT
[2:24:55] HAPPENED. AND THAT'S OUR GOD. AND IT'S
[2:24:58] THE SAME GOD THAT SPOKE TO THE WOMAN AT
[2:25:01] the well. IT'S THE SAME GOD THAT OPENED
[2:25:03] UP THE RED SEA. IT'S THE SAME GOD
[2:25:06] TONIGHT. AND I'M A WITNESS to it. IT'S
[2:25:09] THE SAME GOD
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; that opens the eyes of a blind girl
[2:25:13] while I stood and looked at her from a
[2:25:16] few feet away. And the prophet of God
[2:25:18] said, "Satan,
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; you cannot withstand this."
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; And her eyes, which were just white, no
[2:25:28] pupils, and straightened out right in
[2:25:30] front of MY FACE. THAT'S THE SAME GOD.
[2:25:33] THAT'S MAYBE 50 years ago, BUT IT'S NOT
[2:25:35] THAT GOD that we're not looking back
[2:25:38] there. We're looking at right now, right
[2:25:40] here. And I'm saying to you that if you
[2:25:42] have it in your heart, you can put them
[2:25:44] to the test.
[2:25:49] I'm looking at two young women here
[2:25:51] standing here with you young people that
[2:25:54] were that were cursed with leukemia and
[2:25:58] God cursed the leukemia.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Amanda Snow, raise your hand to
[2:26:04] the glory of God. Raise it up high.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; That girl had leukemia.
[2:26:09] She's here tonight.
[2:26:17] That's our God.
[2:26:20] Sister Beth Dingwall, raise your hand.
[2:26:24] ABOUT SIX YEARS. SIX years of leukemia
[2:26:27] AND SATAN COULD NOT TAKE HER LIFE
[2:26:30] BECAUSE God wanted her to stand here
[2:26:32] tonight so you could see it.
[2:26:37] HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:40] AND HOW MANY here were BOUND BY SIN,
[2:26:43] BOUND BY DRUGS, BOUND BY FEAR, BOUND BY
[2:26:46] SUICIDE DEMONS, bound by every KIND OF
[2:26:49] ENEMY. AND SATAN, HIS POWER HAS BEEN
[2:26:53] BROKEN.
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; This might be your moment. God does not
[2:27:04] intend that his people live under a
[2:27:06] cloud of fear. Yes, sir. That's right.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; You know, it's not of God.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Your life may not be right with God. I'm
[2:27:15] going to ask you. We're going to just
[2:27:17] sing the chorus once again. All things
[2:27:19] are I want to sing. All things are
[2:27:21] possible. Lord, I believe.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe. All things are
[2:27:25] possible. Lord, I believe. And perhaps
[2:27:29] you are at that state where you are
[2:27:32] intent to do business for a specific
[2:27:35] thing. I'm talking about serious things.
[2:27:37] It might be a sickness, but it might I'm
[2:27:40] more concerned about spiritual things.
[2:27:43] Friends,
[2:27:45] I think that we should be done
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; with some of these spiritual
[2:27:49] afflictions.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; It should end tonight.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; And if you're prepared to do business
[2:27:56] with God, I've asked Brother Ron to
[2:27:58] remain here. I know he's very weary. He
[2:28:01] preached hard. He preached God's word.
[2:28:04] And that power going through a person.
[2:28:06] But I asked them and the brothers are
[2:28:08] prepared to maybe put a chair here. If
[2:28:11] if you feel I don't want to hold, you
[2:28:13] know, the whole audience, but if you're
[2:28:15] prepared to do business with God and
[2:28:18] said, I got something and that has to be
[2:28:21] broken tonight and I've come to this
[2:28:23] moment and I'm done with playing I'm
[2:28:26] playing church. I'm done with playing
[2:28:28] religion. Hallelujah. I'm here to do
[2:28:31] business with God. AND IF YOU'RE AT THAT
[2:28:34] STATE, I'm just encouraging you. If you
[2:28:37] wish, you can do it right in your seat.
[2:28:39] You don't have to come forward, but if
[2:28:41] you want to come pass by here, perhaps
[2:28:43] you could come this way and pass by
[2:28:46] here. And brother Ron, you're not going
[2:28:48] to tell a story. You're not going to
[2:28:50] say, "Pray for this, pray for that." You
[2:28:53] already in your heart have made the
[2:28:55] decision.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; You don't need any more than a just a
[2:28:58] word or a phone call or or a touch. And
[2:29:00] brother Brandham talks about uh uh uh a
[2:29:04] point of contact. And this might be your
[2:29:06] point of contact. Think about some of
[2:29:08] you young people. I'm going to tell you
[2:29:11] after this service, you're either going
[2:29:13] to go and get yourself messed up proper
[2:29:15] or you're going to get delivered
[2:29:16] tonight.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; God, you can't play games with God. YOU
[2:29:24] CAN'T FOOL WITH GOD. GOD WILL not be
[2:29:27] mocked.
[2:29:29] WHAT YOU LIVED LAST WEEK WON'T WORK NEXT
[2:29:32] WEEK BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HEARD TONIGHT.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; You got a man here not only been do not
[2:29:38] only been healed from being burnt the
[2:29:40] way HE WAS. THERE'S A man that's been in
[2:29:42] uh been bound BY DRUGS AND GOD DELIVERED
[2:29:45] HIM.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; Like some OF YOU YOUNG PEOPLE RAISED UP
[2:29:50] IN THE MESSAGE, YOU'VE HEARD IT OVER AND
[2:29:52] OVER and over and all the quotes and you
[2:29:53] could almost go to sleep on it. You
[2:29:55] could almost quote it YOURSELF BY HEART.
[2:29:57] THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. IT'S GOT TO
[2:29:59] BE SOMETHING THAT'S ALIVE INSIDE OF YOUR
[2:30:01] HEART.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; A QUICKENED THING. SAY, "TONIGHT'S MY
[2:30:06] NIGHT FOR OUR GOD, MY GOD."
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; And we'll just sing that.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; All things are possible. Lord, I
[2:30:15] believe. And if you're the one that's
[2:30:18] prepared to do business with God, you
[2:30:20] can make your way around and just pass
[2:30:22] by here. Let Brother Ron lay his hand on
[2:30:24] you. Brother Brandham prayed for
[2:30:26] hundreds and all he said was God bless
[2:30:28] you. God bless you. God bless you. God
[2:30:30] bless you. And that is not an idol word.
[2:30:33] That is God bless you.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE YOU THE ANSWER to your to your
[2:30:39] need. Amen. Will everyone pray?
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Will everyone believe what I'm speaking
[2:30:46] now?
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; And I like you to believe. And if you're
[2:30:48] sitting right in your seat, receive it
[2:30:50] right there at this time. All right.
[2:30:53] Lord, I believe.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; And if you want to walk by, that's fine.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Just make your way here if you want him
[2:31:10] to pray with you.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[2:31:16] Lord, I
[2:31:18] believe.
[2:31:22] Lord,
[2:31:25] I believe.
[2:31:28] Lord,
[2:31:31] I believe
[2:31:34] you mean business with God. Only come if
[2:31:37] you mean business with God.
[2:31:40] God's got to break that at this time.

[2:32:06] leave. The prophet of God said, "Now,
[2:32:08] thank him." You that are being prayed
[2:32:11] for, you thank him. Go with your hands
[2:32:13] in the air thanking him. Lord, I
[2:32:17] believe. Oh, Lord.

[2:50:25] aside and take control of the whole
[2:50:27] meeting.
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; And maybe you wake up an hour, hour and
[2:50:30] a half later and the glory of God is
[2:50:34] over the people. We've prayed earnestly
[2:50:37] that the cloud of the Holy Spirit will
[2:50:40] overshadow this campground. We didn't
[2:50:43] buy it for volleyball. That's fine. We
[2:50:46] didn't buy it for fun and games. That's
[2:50:49] fine. We didn't buy it to eat together,
[2:50:51] ALTHOUGH THAT'S FINE. WE BOUGHT IT THAT

[2:51:00] and into this tent. HALLELUJAH. AND GET
[2:51:04] GLORY TO JESUS CHRIST. He's the worthy
[2:51:08] one.
[2:51:10] AND THERE'S NONE LIKE HIM.
[2:51:13] I want to give him praise.
[2:51:16] I JUST WANT HIM TO BE GLORIFIED. He's
[2:51:19] not glorified in playing church or just
[2:51:21] HAVING CHURCH. HE'S GLORIFIED WHEN
[2:51:23] PEOPLE LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE SPIRIT OF
[2:51:27] GOD. HE'S GLORIFIED WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT
[2:51:30] BAPTIZES THOSE THAT ARE EMPTY. Who's
[2:51:33] empty tonight? WHO NEEDS TO BE FILLED
[2:51:35] WITH THE HOLY GHOST? RAISE YOUR HAND AND
[2:51:37] BE FILLED.
[2:51:39] Be ye filled with the spirit of God.
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; Receive it from him. He's the baptizer.
[2:51:50] &gt;&gt; No man is a baptizer. He's a baptizer.
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, I'd like to sing. Behold,
[2:52:01] &gt;&gt; what manner of man is this?
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:10] &gt;&gt; Can we put that on the screen, please?
[2:52:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Who stills the raging sea? Is the first
[2:52:18] verse.
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; Behold, what manner of man is this? Who
[2:52:24] steals the raging sea? He heals the
[2:52:28] sick, the lame. Amen. And takes the
[2:52:31] blind to see.
[2:52:34] He opens all the prison doors and sets
[2:52:38] the captive free. Yes, he does. The dark
[2:52:41] line exists by the plan.
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; Who is he? He's the Lord of glory. He is
[2:52:51] the great I am. The alpha and only God,
[2:52:57] the beginning and the end. His name is
[2:53:03] wonderful. The prince of peace is he.
[2:53:07] He's the everlasting
[2:53:09] father throughout all eternity.
[2:53:14] Behold what manner of man is this whose
[2:53:17] faith to the woman at the well.
[2:53:20] everlasting life I will give to you my
[2:53:25] man can tell
[2:53:27] and who surrenet
[2:53:34] behold what manner of man
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; he's alive he's here he's more than a
[2:53:40] song
[2:53:42] of glory he is the great I am the alpha
[2:53:48] and omega God, the beginning and the
[2:53:52] end. And his name is wonderful. The
[2:53:58] prince of peace is he. He's the
[2:54:01] everlasting father.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; I want to have that verse. Behold, what
[2:54:09] manner of this who stands between God
[2:54:11] and man? Go on to sing that verse,
[2:54:14] please.
[2:54:17] His
[2:54:19] eyes are as a flame of fire. His fan is
[2:54:22] in his hand. John saw him in the seven
[2:54:25] churches as the sun in brilliancy.
[2:54:29] And the prophet of God saw him in this
[2:54:31] day in brilliancy. And that's our God.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. That's our God.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; Let's make it personal. That's my God.
[2:54:45] right now.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus.
[2:54:58] Make love to him. Love him.
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; This is real, friends.
[2:55:07] Amen.
[2:55:08] &gt;&gt; It's the same God
[2:55:11] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[2:55:17] Man is pushed between God and his eyes
[2:55:22] as a flame of fire. His is in his hand.
[2:55:27] John saw him in the seven churches as a
[2:55:31] son in William Sea.
[2:55:34] Behold, what manner of man is this?
[2:55:39] This is who it is. He's the Lord of
[2:55:43] glory. He is great. I am
[2:55:48] the alpha and
[2:55:51] the beginning and the end. And his name
[2:55:56] is wonderful. The prince of Jesus.
[2:56:00] He's a everlasting father.
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; Let's have all the sisters sing ahead.
[2:56:08] He's the Lord.
[2:56:12] All the sisters.
[2:56:15] Oh, give it up.
[2:56:17] Give it praise to him.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; We're worshiping him.
[2:56:30] Sisters are worshiping him. Now all the
[2:56:33] brothers worship him.
[2:56:50] is wonderful.
[2:56:54] He's the everlasting
[2:56:57] father.
[2:57:00] All right. Just before we sing it again
[2:57:02] now, how many here know someone perhaps
[2:57:05] even a young person that's not here
[2:57:08] tonight because their lips are stilled
[2:57:10] in death?
[2:57:13] How many know someone who's not here
[2:57:16] that raise your hand?
[2:57:19] You young people, you know some young
[2:57:20] people.
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand.
[2:57:24] &gt;&gt; They're not here
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; and they can't sing this song.
[2:57:30] &gt;&gt; And the psalmist David said, "The dead
[2:57:32] praise not God."
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; They don't have that opportunity. YOU
[2:57:37] STILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; How some WOULD LOVE TO SAY HIS NAME IS
[2:57:44] WONDERFUL.
[2:57:46] THE PRINCE OF PEACE THEY OFFER any
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; and you can say it tonight. You can say
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; one more chance
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; and you haven't got any guarantee of
[2:57:59] tomorrow morning.
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; And if YOU DO HAVE TOMORROW MORNING WAKE
[2:58:03] UP SAYING HE'S WONDERFUL.
[2:58:10] All together now we're singing and
[2:58:12] brother Tom Ray will come and dismiss us
[2:58:20] of glory. He is the great I am. He's the
[2:58:25] alpha and only God.
[2:58:28] Receive our thanks. Receive our praise.
[2:58:32] Is wonderful. The prince of peace is he.
[2:58:37] Amazing everlasting
[2:58:39] father through God. All together once
[2:58:43] again the Lord of glory. He is the great
[2:58:48] I am. He has only
[2:58:53] the king and the end. His name is
[2:58:58] wonderful.
[2:59:01] He
[2:59:03] the everlasting father. One more time,
[2:59:07] Saint.
[2:59:08] For he's the Lord of glory. He is the
[2:59:14] great I am, the alpha and only God, the
[2:59:19] beginning and the end. His name is
[2:59:24] wonderful. The prince of peace is he.
[2:59:28] He's the everlasting father throughout
[2:59:33] eternity.
[2:59:38] Hallelujah.
[2:59:41] Praise him.
[2:59:43] Glory.
[2:59:47] The alpha, the omega, the beginning, the
[2:59:50] end. He's my God.
[2:59:53] Glory.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; How do you close a meeting like this?
[3:00:01] How do you close a meeting like this,
[3:00:02] saints,
[3:00:04] where the presence of God just comes
[3:00:05] wave after wave after wave after wave?
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; I am so thankful I serve that God.
[3:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful I'm with the
[3:00:15] PEOPLE THAT LOVE THAT GOD.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:00:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you saw tonight. I saw
[3:00:27] God.
[3:00:31] I'm sorry friends. I I've been in
[3:00:32] unveiling of God too long.
[3:00:39] &gt;&gt; Whatever he said.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; That's what I was taken on Sunday.
[3:00:43] Whatever he said. Is that true, sir?
[3:00:46] Whatever he said.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; But we think that's brother Biscll.
[3:00:51] He will take our camp meeting. Whatever
[3:00:54] he said. Amen.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; Was that brother Biscll or was that God?
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[3:01:04] &gt;&gt; The veil is becoming very thin, saints.
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; And I believe we're living at that hour
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; where the fulfillment now of the
[3:01:12] prophecy of that word is coming to pass.
[3:01:15] &gt;&gt; The bride form,
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; the word of God being manifested.
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; You see, the thing of it is, if you
[3:01:22] don't mind me just taking one man more
[3:01:24] minute, Here's
[3:01:28] a a little bit of a window inside of the
[3:01:31] events that were spoken this evening if
[3:01:33] Joanne does not mind.
[3:01:36] When brother Biscll announced that to
[3:01:38] brother Ron that he will take this camp.
[3:01:41] I had a weward son
[3:01:45] and I couldn't have children
[3:01:49] and I've got a godly wife.
[3:01:52] We prayed and God gave us a son through
[3:01:54] a man of God who prayed and God told him
[3:02:00] his name shall be Joel.
[3:02:02] &gt;&gt; Now you say well how do you love I love
[3:02:05] the spirit of God that dwells within a
[3:02:07] man sir.
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; And just like that woman that great
[3:02:13] woman of the scriptures I'll call my
[3:02:14] wife that great woman. And that son had
[3:02:17] died. Elisha had prayed
[3:02:21] and she got on a donkey. She got on a
[3:02:23] power and she went to that man of God
[3:02:25] and
[3:02:26] she said, "Dad, I'm going to approach
[3:02:28] you as a man of God.
[3:02:31] My son needs a resurrection."
[3:02:35] Brother Ron comes, Brother Ed has
[3:02:37] brother Ron come to this camp, preaches
[3:02:40] a message.
[3:02:42] Was that Brother Ron or was that God?
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; And we experienced the resurrection. and
[3:02:48] two years. Here's brother Joel sitting
[3:02:50] here with his wife. I say he's a great
[3:02:52] God.
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:59] YOU MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE WEWARD,
[3:03:01] BUT YOU GET A HOLD OF A MAN OF GOD AND
[3:03:03] YOU TAKE THAT PROMISE AND YOU WATCH GOD
[3:03:05] MOVE ON the scene.
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF GOD? THAT'S MY GOD. SAINTS
[3:03:09] OF GOD.
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; But I I know what that woman of God went
[3:03:15] through. The agony, the prayer, the
[3:03:17] word, the search, the waiting on God, it
[3:03:20] doesn't come on a platter. We wonder,
[3:03:22] why don't we have what we got? We need
[3:03:24] to be perseverant. We need to be
[3:03:26] PRESSING IN.
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; SAY, "OH, GOD, GIVE ME MY CHILDREN."
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CAMP'S ALL ABOUT. GIVE ME MY
[3:03:33] PROMISE.
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; And you wonder why I love Brother Ron.
[3:03:40] Love his ministry. Love Brother Biscll.
[3:03:42] Love his ministry. All I've seen is God.
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:48] &gt;&gt; And what I'm seeing God being unveiled
[3:03:50] amongst us again.
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; Come praying for them tomorrow night.
[3:03:59] This mighty God unveiled before us is
[3:04:01] moving amongst his children once again.
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:04] &gt;&gt; He's not only the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[3:04:06] and Jacob.
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; The God of William Brham. He's my God
[3:04:10] and he's the lovely Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:04:13] May God bless you tonight and thank you
[3:04:16] heavenly father.
[3:04:21] These were wonderful words of life we
[3:04:23] heard tonight
[3:04:26] and we can say that that God has been
[3:04:28] raised out of history and he's alive
[3:04:31] living in me to tell.
[3:04:34] And so Lord, Brother Ron has poured out
[3:04:38] his strength.
[3:04:41] A man has given himself to the spirit of
[3:04:44] God. And we are thankful for the word of
[3:04:48] God that we heard tonight through the
[3:04:50] vessel. And so Lord, we want to tuck
[3:04:52] that deep within our hearts. We want to
[3:04:54] go our separate ways tonight and pray
[3:04:56] that the grace of God will overshadow us
[3:04:59] all. And Lord, let these words be
[3:05:02] ringing in our hearts tonight to know
[3:05:05] you're a personal God
[3:05:08] in an impersonal age. You are a God that
[3:05:11] is a very present help in time of
[3:05:13] trouble. And we're believing for
[3:05:15] everyone that passed through this line
[3:05:17] this evening. We're praying God that you
[3:05:20] have granted to them according to their
[3:05:22] desire. We pray Lord that you'll be
[3:05:24] glorified through all of our lives. go
[3:05:27] with each and every one of us now. We
[3:05:29] pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you richly.
[3:05:39] Those that have come on grounds, we
[3:05:40] thank you again for attending these
[3:05:42] services and making them what they are.
[3:05:44] And if you just be kind enough to make
[3:05:47] your way when you're finished here,
[3:05:50] you can stay here as long as
[3:05:53] you would like. But once you're finished
[3:05:55] in the tent, would you just mind making
[3:05:58] your way off the grounds and all the
[3:05:59] count uh counselors and campers and
[3:06:02] registered campers here on the grounds
[3:06:05] kitchen has something for you. It will
[3:06:08] be closed at 11:00, but if you choose to
[3:06:10] be here, that's just fine, too. We thank
[3:06:14] you for your kind attendance. God bless
[3:06:16] you. You're dismissed. Greet one another
[3:06:20] in Jesus name. God be with you. Amen.
[3:06:56] might
[3:07:12] be.
[3:07:17] I am so glad.
