[4:12] morning. Welcome to the house of the
[4:14] Lord. Those that are streaming with us,
[4:16] God bless you this morning as well.
[4:23] Let's sing the chorus.
[4:27] I anored my soul
[4:31] in the haven
[4:34] of rest.
[4:36] I'll sail the wild seas
[4:40] no more.
[4:44] The tempest
[4:47] may sweet
[4:49] or the wild story.
[4:53] It's in Jesus
[4:55] I'm safe
[4:57] ever more. My soul
[5:02] my soul in sad exile
[5:06] was out on life seek.
[5:11] burdened
[5:13] with sin and distress
[5:17] till I heard till I heard a sweet voice
[5:23] say make me your choice
[5:28] and I entered
[5:30] the heaven
[5:32] of grace.
[5:36] I anchored
[5:39] my soul
[5:41] in the haven
[5:43] of rest.
[5:45] I'll sail
[5:47] while sea go.
[5:52] [Music]
[5:54] The tempest
[5:56] makes me
[5:58] the wild
[6:00] or believe me.
[6:02] In Jesus
[6:05] I'm safe
[6:07] ever more.
[6:11] I yielded
[6:14] myself
[6:16] to his tender
[6:18] embrace
[6:20] and faith,
[6:22] taking hold of the word.
[6:28] There my feathers
[6:31] fell off and I anchored my soul.
[6:38] The haven
[6:40] of rest is my Lord.
[6:46] I've angered
[6:49] my soul
[6:51] in the haven
[6:53] of rest.
[6:55] I'll fail the wild
[6:59] no more
[7:06] this place
[7:08] for the wild
[7:10] for me.
[7:12] It's in Jesus
[7:15] I'm safe
[7:17] ever more.
[7:19] The song,
[7:21] the song of my soul, since the Lord made
[7:28] me whole,
[7:30] has made the old story
[7:34] so blessed.
[7:39] of Jesus
[7:41] will save
[7:43] whoever
[7:45] will have a home.

[7:52] How we thank you for that home, Lord.

[8:33] to the Savior.
[8:36] He patiently
[8:39] waits to save
[8:42] by his power divine.

[8:51] your soul
[8:53] in the haven
[8:56] of rest
[8:58] and say
[9:00] my beloved
[9:03] is mine. Do you feel that way this
[9:05] morning? For I've angered
[9:09] my soul.
[9:13] The heaven of rest
[9:16] I'll s
[9:21] [Music]
[9:24] the tempest
[9:27] place may sweep
[9:29] for the wild
[9:32] deep.
[9:33] But in Jesus

[23:33] you come this morning, Brother Joe, take
[23:36] us before the throne of grace as a
[23:38] congregation.
[23:40] My heart's very full this morning. I
[23:42] trust that yours is, too.
[23:45] We do want to remember Sister Leverne.
[23:47] She's not sitting here this morning.
[23:49] She's at home not feeling well. When I
[23:51] first read the request, it says, "I
[23:53] would like to request prayer."
[23:56] And I thought it said, "I would like to
[23:58] request power."
[24:01] And I thought after I reread it, I said,
[24:02] "Well, I like the first version first."
[24:05] She needs power. She needs that wonder
[24:07] working power. Amen. To come down and
[24:10] energize her body. We also want to
[24:12] remember Brother Ryan Hayes this
[24:14] morning. Faithful musician and song
[24:16] leader in our congregation. A wonderful
[24:18] gift that God has placed in our body. We
[24:20] want to remember him this morning as
[24:22] well. Brother Joe,
[24:26] bow our heads and our hearts this
[24:28] morning.
[24:31] Precious heavenly father, dear Lord
[24:33] Jesus, come before thy holy presence
[24:36] this morning. We're so thankful for your
[24:37] goodness, grace, and love and mercy
[24:39] towards us, Father. Because you are our
[24:42] father, we come before thee, Father,
[24:44] with encouraged hearts, oh God, knowing
[24:45] we're your children. If children, we're
[24:48] heirs of these great, exceedingly
[24:50] precious promises that you've laid
[24:51] before us in thy word, oh God. So we
[24:54] come boldly, Lord God, knowing that
[24:56] you're still the same yesterday, today,
[24:58] and forever. You say, "I'm the Lord God
[25:00] and I change not." Lord, you are today
[25:03] what you've always been, Father. Oh God,
[25:05] we can come with the token on our lives
[25:08] applied, Father, that we know, Lord God,
[25:11] Father, that we have now the earnest of
[25:15] our inheritance, Father, and the Lord
[25:17] Jesus Christ, knowing that you're still
[25:19] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[25:22] And you have given us the Holy Spirit,
[25:24] oh God, that we can rejoice, that can
[25:26] lead and guide us, Father. And that we
[25:29] can ask anything in thy name, Lord. You
[25:31] said you will do it, Father. Oh God. So
[25:34] Lord, this morning also, we just want to
[25:36] lift up thy wonderful name, which name
[25:38] is above every name. A name that's far
[25:41] above every principality and every
[25:42] power. You are ruler, Lord. You rule
[25:45] this world, Father. Oh God, and
[25:47] everything is your hands. You set up
[25:48] kingdoms and you make kingdoms to follow
[25:51] God because you are God and beside you
[25:55] there is no other Lord God. So we lift
[25:58] you up this morning and we want the word
[26:01] to lift you up father. We want our
[26:03] minister to come and exalt you, Father.
[26:06] Oh God, and to learn of thee once again,
[26:09] Father, encourage our hearts, encourage
[26:11] our life, Father. Oh God, we lift you up
[26:13] this morning, oh God. Lord, and we want
[26:16] to lift up those that are sick and
[26:17] afflicted today, oh Father. We just lift
[26:20] up, oh God, our sister and our brother,
[26:23] oh God. They have they have they have
[26:26] brought in this request, oh God. Father,
[26:28] and surely, Lord God, you know the need,
[26:30] oh God, this morning, oh God.
[26:32] I also want to lift up our brother Jerry
[26:35] Schul, oh God, who's in the hospital,
[26:36] sick and afflicted. Oh God, down in
[26:38] Louisiana, Lord. Lord, a brother, oh
[26:40] God, that's been faithful. He's been
[26:42] addicted for many years, Father. He
[26:44] stood before thee, oh God. Lord, he has
[26:47] his lungs are so bad, Lord, having to be
[26:49] on oxygen most of the time, Father.
[26:52] Lord, my desire, oh God, is that you
[26:54] give him a new set of lungs, oh God.
[26:56] Lord, not just to be just healed for a
[26:59] moment, oh God. We lift them up, oh God.
[27:01] We also want to lift up the children
[27:03] that surround him. His wife, Father, the
[27:05] ministering brethren that
[27:06] brother-in-laws, Father, that are
[27:08] burdening their hearts for them, oh God,
[27:10] in the church and brothers Tim and
[27:12] Timothy, oh God. We just want to lift
[27:14] them up, oh God, at this time being
[27:17] discouraged, oh God. And I'm sure, Lord,
[27:19] they need prayer this morning, Father.
[27:21] Lord, and for our congregation here as a
[27:24] whole, oh God, we want to lift every
[27:25] soul up in your divine presence, oh God.
[27:28] Oh Lord, you know every need, oh God.
[27:30] Father, oh Lord, and we we have need. We
[27:33] we ask thee, oh God, that you'll meet
[27:35] every need. Lord, anoint your word as it
[27:38] come this morning in power and
[27:40] demonstration of the Holy Ghost. Oh God,
[27:42] Father, we need you in this hour to come
[27:45] in power and in strength. Oh God, bless
[27:47] thy people once again. Oh God, we give
[27:50] you thanks and honor and glory. Heavenly
[27:52] Father, bless this day to us. We commit
[27:55] it to you and your wonderful name, Lord
[27:56] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:02] Praise the Lord. Why don't you have your
[28:03] seats this morning as the deacons
[28:05] receive the offering?
[28:11] Amen.
[28:14] Thank you.

[28:37] and up. So, if you're in the young
[28:40] people's bracket between 13 and up, make
[28:42] sure that you're there. That's from

[28:53] the Sunday school helpers that are
[28:54] involved in that from the young people's
[28:56] group if you could be there at 3:00 as

[29:01] where that's at, but I'm going to say
[29:04] I'm going to say in the chapel, but if
[29:06] it's not, head over to the fellowship
[29:07] room. I know the fellowship room can be
[29:09] kind of full during the services, so

[29:15] if I have anything else here.
[29:19] All right, let's sing. Uh, I shall not

[29:25] the offering, Jesus is my savior. I
[29:29] shall not be moved

[30:38] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[30:44] That's planted by the waterers.
[30:48] Lord, I shall not be moved.
[30:55] Amen. That's a good testimony.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Well, this morning I have a couple
[30:58] announcements I'd like to make. Seeing
[31:00] that we're coming into the season that
[31:03] we are, they call it Christmas season.
[31:05] Um, number one, I'd like to um, uh, let
[31:09] you know that there will be a schedule
[31:11] posted up in the foyer in around the
[31:14] office to let you know the service
[31:16] times. I'll go over that. But uh this
[31:20] morning we'd like to recognize a couple
[31:22] of brothers that um that uh we'd like to
[31:25] put forward as um as deacons or they
[31:29] would like to step into a position or
[31:32] they wouldn't mind step into a position.
[31:34] But the brethren have a need for more
[31:37] brothers. Uh seeing that the
[31:39] congregation is growing, the needs are
[31:41] many and uh the names have been put
[31:44] forward. We want to put them forward to
[31:46] you. They'll be going through what we
[31:48] call a trial period over a couple next
[31:50] three months. See how they work in and
[31:53] how you work in with them. And uh I'd
[31:56] like brother uh Jeff Wman if he would
[31:58] mind standing so everybody would know.
[32:00] Brother Jeff Wman and brother Leon
[32:02] Garland. Would you like to stand up?
[32:04] Brother Leon, these are the two brothers
[32:06] that the brethren have names have been
[32:08] put forward. So if you see them helping
[32:10] the deacons over the next few weeks and
[32:12] months, they're there for a reason. And
[32:14] we thank God that God have put uh
[32:16] faithful and loyal brothers amongst us.
[32:20] And may God use them and may you be
[32:24] comfortable in the position that God has
[32:27] now placed you in. They are faithful
[32:29] brethren and of a good report. So God
[32:32] bless you and thank you for standing.
[32:34] Amen. Next is a Christmas schedule we'll
[32:37] be going into um coming into the
[32:40] Christmas time on December the 25th. It
[32:43] is Christmas morning and the greatest
[32:46] gift that we could have is to come and
[32:48] and worship the giver himself, the giver
[32:50] of the great gift. So, we'll have one
[32:53] service that morning at 11:00 on
[32:55] December the 25th. Uh that following
[32:58] Wednesday will be a regular service.
[33:00] Praise the Lord. And look forward to
[33:02] that. Then on December the 31st at 9:00,
[33:07] uh that is our watch night service. It
[33:09] will start sharply at 9. And of course,
[33:12] the next morning is New Year's, January
[33:16] the 1st. So, we thought we'd start an
[33:18] early service around 7 in the morning.
[33:23] I knew that would keep you awake. I just
[33:24] wondering whether you were listening.
[33:26] No, we will have a 1:00 in the afternoon
[33:28] service so that all of you people that
[33:31] need to sleep in and get your rest can
[33:33] get some rest. So, again, December the
[33:35] 25th, one service at 11:00, regular
[33:39] service the following Wednesday. Our
[33:41] watch night service December the 31st at
[33:43] 9:00 and our January the 1st service
[33:46] will be 1 in the afternoon. God bless
[33:49] you. Looking forward to the word.
[33:51] Pastors preaching this morning.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; I'm under great expectation.
[33:56] Amen. May we just pull on the gift. God
[33:59] bless you.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Let's just sing a couple more verses of
[34:05] that song we were singing. Um we've got
[34:08] a special this morning and a baby
[34:09] dedication. So, those that are singing,
[34:11] the Vanenter children, if they would
[34:12] come up and get ready, we'll just sing
[34:14] this another time or two while they're
[34:16] getting ready, and then we'll move right
[34:17] into the dedication at the end of their
[34:20] song.
[34:22] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[34:27] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[34:32] Just like a tree that's planted by the
[34:35] water.
[34:38] I shall not be moved.
[34:42] It's on his word I'm leading. I shall
[34:46] not be moved.
[34:50] He's leading. I shall not be moved. Just
[34:53] like a tree that's planted by the
[34:57] waterers.
[34:59] I shall not be moved. I shall not be I
[35:05] shall not be I shall not be moved.
[35:10] I shall not be I shall not be just like
[35:14] a sea that's planted by the water.
[35:20] I shall not be. Glory hallelujah.
[35:25] Oh, glory halleluah.
[35:28] I shall not be moved. I'm anchored in
[35:32] Jehovah.
[35:33] I shall not be moved. Just like a tree
[35:37] that's planted by the waterers.
[35:41] I shall not. Oh, sing it out now.
[35:46] Will I shall not be? I shall not be
[35:51] moved.
[35:52] I shall not be I shall not be moved.
[35:56] Just like
[35:58] that by the water.
[36:03] I shall not be moved. I shall not be. I
[36:09] shall not be. I shall not be moved.
[36:14] I shall not be. I shall not move just
[36:18] like
[36:20] that's planted by the waterers.
[36:24] I shall not be
[36:28] [Music]
[36:57] I read about
[37:00] how Paul and Silas were in jail and no
[37:04] one there.
[37:06] Nobody there to pay their bill. But when
[37:09] they prayed,
[37:10] &gt;&gt; But when they prayed, they found that
[37:13] God was on their side. The jailhouse
[37:15] door,
[37:16] &gt;&gt; the jailhouse door swung open wide.
[37:20] If you believe,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; if you believe, you shall receive. You
[37:24] shall receive. There's not a trouble or
[37:28] the Lord can't relieve.
[37:31] Oh, he is just the same today. All you
[37:35] have to do is trust and pray and
[37:37] believe.
[37:39] You must believe
[37:42] when Daniel said
[37:45] within the hungry lion's den, nobody
[37:48] thought nobody thought that there was
[37:51] any hope for him. But all night long
[37:56] the lions never took a bite. God took
[37:59] away. God took away their time.
[38:04] If you believe, if you believe, you
[38:07] shall receive. You shall receive.
[38:09] There's not a trouble or can the good
[38:12] Lord can't believe.
[38:14] Oh, he is just the same today. All you
[38:19] have to do is just pray.
[38:23] You must believe.
[38:25] When David stood when David stood before
[38:28] the giant with his ling alive
[38:33] as such a puny little thing. But David
[38:37] knew what David knew. His faith in God
[38:40] would stand the test. He slung the rock.
[38:43] He slung the roof. God did the rest.
[38:47] If you believe in you shall receive. You
[38:51] shall receive. There's not a trouble
[38:53] ahead. The good Lord can't believe.
[38:57] Oh, he is just the same today. All you
[39:01] have to do is trust and pray. Believe.
[39:05] You must believe.
[39:09] All you have to do is trust and pray and
[39:11] believe.
[39:13] You must believe.
[39:17] All you had to do is trust and pray and
[39:19] believe.
[39:21] You must believe.
[39:25] [Applause]
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Wow, that was some singing, wasn't it?
[39:44] We're going to have a baby dedication
[39:47] and uh we parents arranged for them to
[39:50] sing just in front of the baby
[39:52] dedication.
[39:54] So uh wow.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; I hope that this daughter that we're
[40:02] going to dedicate will know what kind of
[40:05] singing we're expecting of her.
[40:09] Amen. Amen.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Isn't that all right?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; And you know they weren't just singing a
[40:15] special. I think that was an example to
[40:17] all of us.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; You sing like that. We'll all have the
[40:21] same response.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; I looked over the congregation and they
[40:25] were everybody was smiling.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice?
[40:32] &gt;&gt; Joy. I thought you should be up here
[40:34] singing too, but maybe there'll be
[40:36] another time. All right.
[40:56] Well, this is the family that
[40:59] the medical world said couldn't happen.
[41:04] That's what they said.
[41:07] How many years was that?
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Five years. Yeah.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Five years.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Five years.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; Five years. Five years can't happen.
[41:18] And never will have a natural birth. And
[41:21] this fourth one came with by natural
[41:23] birth. Everything was natural.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:31] And uh
[41:34] Andre has said to me in the email which
[41:36] and and in person
[41:39] that she is an absolute miracle.
[41:43] So I feel somewhat honored today to not
[41:46] just merely be here but to dedicate a
[41:50] miracle to God.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; God sent a miracle down. Now we dedicate
[41:56] a miracle.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:00] Uh,
[42:03] brother Rickart and sister Andrea
[42:07] have
[42:09] desired to dedicate this baby. This
[42:13] child is a daughter and they have named
[42:17] her Adele
[42:20] Lorraine.
[42:22] Adele because of the meaning of being
[42:26] noble, kind and tender.
[42:30] And uh
[42:33] they said we thought it appropriate to
[42:35] have tender as a meaning
[42:38] because in this world not too many
[42:41] people are tender towards the Lord and
[42:45] that would be a great attribute for her
[42:47] to have.
[42:48] And I thought it would be a great time
[42:51] in this service for everyone to say,
[42:55] "Lord, let me be tender
[42:58] &gt;&gt; towards your Holy Spirit. Let me be
[43:01] tender to the words that you have chosen
[43:03] to be spoken today. May I be tender to
[43:07] the word of God." And I'm going to just
[43:09] say a word more about that in a moment.
[43:12] And the second name they named her
[43:15] Lorraine,
[43:17] named after her greatg grandmother Ruth
[43:20] and after her mother
[43:24] Andrea. They both carry that same name
[43:27] Lorraine. And in case you don't know,
[43:29] it's a place in France
[43:33] and it's connected to nobility.
[43:37] They good thing for ancestry.com. they
[43:39] can find out it goes all the way back to
[43:41] Charlemagne.
[43:45] We're all We're all kings and priests
[43:47] somehow.
[43:51] But I love the word tender because it
[43:54] made reference to my I think one of my
[43:59] favorite
[44:00] of kings of the Old Testament, which was
[44:03] a young lad, Josiah.
[44:06] And for you boys that are seated here,
[44:10] it might surprise you that he came to
[44:12] the throne at 8 years old.
[44:16] 8 years old. And sometime between 8 and
[44:21] 18,
[44:23] he some of his people were digging and
[44:27] found a holy book, the book of the law.
[44:32] and and in the book they had read of the
[44:35] judgments of God that came against the
[44:38] people
[44:39] because they had not adhered to the
[44:41] word. And uh he just was in anguish over
[44:46] that.
[44:48] And the Bible says this, he sent he sent
[44:52] messengers to uh to uh Halda. He sent
[44:57] messengers to Hilkaya the high priest.
[45:00] And God spoke to him through them and
[45:04] said this because thine heart was
[45:08] tender.
[45:11] That's always been special for me.
[45:13] Because his heart was tender. And he was
[45:16] just a young lad, a young man. Because
[45:19] your heart was tender and thou hast
[45:21] humbled thyself before the Lord.
[45:25] When thou heardest what I spake against
[45:28] this place, it wasn't a compliment. It
[45:30] was something against the place and his
[45:33] heart was tender and against the
[45:35] inhabitants thereof. And they should
[45:37] become a desolation and a curse.
[45:41] Now what he did, he rent his clo his
[45:44] clothes
[45:46] and wept before God.
[45:49] And God heard him.
[45:51] Now friends, I just want to say to you,
[45:53] this is a big dedication, but this is
[45:56] more than a big this is a service and
[45:59] God has a purpose in this
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and that is that we when we hear
[46:03] something even if it's against us, we we
[46:07] come before God with a soft tender heart
[46:11] and he tore his clothes in in humility
[46:15] and came to God with such desperate and
[46:19] wept before God. God said, "Send words
[46:22] back to this young man." And I pray
[46:27] that that will be the case with Adele.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; And
[46:32] and all that she may affect in life. So,
[46:36] we're going to dedicate Adele
[46:39] Lorraine Vanenter to the Lord.
[46:45] Do I dare hold her? I'm like,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; she w we thought she was going to be
[46:51] quiet, but she wants to say amen.
[46:57] We'll pray. Heavenly Father,
[47:01] we hold this jewel that you have sent
[47:03] down into the Vanenter home.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; And you ordained that Andrea should be
[47:10] her mother
[47:11] &gt;&gt; and brother Rickart shall be her father.
[47:14] And we pray, oh God, that you will watch
[47:17] over her.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; I pray that there will be a holy cloud
[47:20] of the Holy Spirit upon her
[47:23] &gt;&gt; and that she will indeed be a noble
[47:25] child.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Indeed, she shall be one, oh God, that
[47:29] will be tender to your Holy Spirit. And
[47:32] as you have given her through a
[47:34] miraculous birth and conception to this
[47:37] couple, Lord Jesus, our brother Rickart
[47:40] and Sister Andrea, now we dedicate them
[47:43] as as not only as husband and wife, but
[47:45] as father and mother. And I pray that
[47:48] this child, Lord, will grow up with the
[47:50] glory of God upon her face. I pray,
[47:53] Lord, that you will let her hear your
[47:56] name and understand it.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Then she may understand your word, Lord.
[48:01] Pray that you'll give her that gift and
[48:04] we dedicate this child back to you
[48:06] father in the name of Jesus Christ.
[48:09] Adele Lorraine van enter
[48:13] given back to you on this day in Jesus
[48:17] name.
[48:19] Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That was a glory hallelujah.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:27] Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[48:30] Thanks for the song.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[48:37] I want to put up a a slide also of our
[48:40] brother Kobas's work and what we've
[48:43] done. We've adjusted a wee bit, brother
[48:45] Kobus, just to show what had been taking
[48:48] place in the last week. So, can we put
[48:51] that slide up and then we'll
[48:56] we'll need to dim the lights.
[49:01] So, this is since last week
[49:06] uh the previous week the top one of
[49:09] Chinese was at 16% and now at 30% 14%
[49:14] change. The next one was from 0% to 2%.
[49:19] The IG pool uh proof reading is uh this
[49:25] week is 100%. Last week was 82. Now it's
[49:28] 100%
[49:30] and that's already set to go up. The
[49:34] lingala
[49:36] was from 22% up to 27%. This is just
[49:40] this week friends what people have been
[49:42] giving.
[49:44] and uh a German proof reading which was
[49:47] 1% that remains unchanged this week.
[49:51] Shona proof reading from zero went up to
[49:54] 6% in one week and the shona the bottom
[49:59] Shona was 100% and it is 100% yet today.
[50:06] So it hasn't changed. It's 100% last
[50:08] week, 100% this week. Amen. Brother
[50:12] Kobus, uh, you haven't been that visible
[50:16] with the people, but I will speak about
[50:19] a certain part of the body of Christ.
[50:22] And to those of you that have not been
[50:27] forward or visible,
[50:30] you won't forget this service.
[50:34] you mothers
[50:37] and sisters,
[50:38] women
[50:40] uh that you hear a lot of things in the
[50:42] message that you perhaps have felt
[50:45] touched you in a derogatory way
[50:48] and there are others who never are
[50:51] forward,
[50:52] never are seen, do not play an
[50:55] instrument, do not sing.
[50:58] Uh,
[51:00] I want to talk about you today
[51:04] and so you will remember this service.
[51:10] I'll have you stand and read with me
[51:16] and you can turn in your Bibles to
[51:18] Ephesians the 5th chapter.
[51:33] And just before we read, I'd like to
[51:35] pray with you. Have you pray with me?
[51:40] And while you bow your head and while
[51:42] you ponder what to say, say this.
[51:47] Father, open my eyes
[51:50] as you did Josiah's
[51:53] and let me hear your voice.
[51:56] Let me hear what you want
[51:59] me to hear. May it touch my heart.
[52:03] Heavenly Father, this is what I pray.
[52:06] This is what I desire for every one of
[52:09] these
[52:11] your elected that are gathered here in
[52:13] this place. And there are so many others
[52:17] around the globe.
[52:19] Those that you died for,
[52:22] those that were on your mind when you
[52:26] did the act of redemption.
[52:29] Lord Jesus, we are here to thank you for
[52:33] giving yourself freely and heavenly
[52:36] father expressing what was in your
[52:40] thoughts before the foundation of the
[52:42] world. You would not allow the enemy of
[52:46] our souls to have any victory. You
[52:50] conquered him. You smoked him. You left
[52:54] him helpless on the ground and cast him
[52:57] to the dust of the earth. And Lord, we
[53:00] believe and we live in the joy of that
[53:03] victory. We are here today, oh God, to
[53:06] declare you have indeed sent your Holy
[53:09] Spirit which came forth from your body.
[53:13] And I pray that today, Lord, you will
[53:15] make this so clear and so evident to the
[53:18] people. And may the people of the Lord
[53:20] rejoice in knowing that you are mindful
[53:24] of every member in Jesus Christ's name.
[53:28] Now I pray you will touch us each one
[53:30] speaker and hearers alike and those that
[53:34] are streaming and wherever they may be
[53:36] may be may those that are afflicted rise
[53:39] up in the name of the almighty one the
[53:42] conqueror of all sickness and all
[53:45] frailties and all death in the name of
[53:48] Jesus Christ. Thy say thy will be done
[53:52] and all the glory shall go to you Lord
[53:55] Jesus. Amen and amen. Hallelujah to our
[54:00] God. Glory to our God. Thank you for
[54:03] your word, Lord. Thank you for the
[54:05] message that you sent. Thank you for the
[54:07] prophet messenger that you sent, oh God.
[54:10] Faithful to our word, and we have
[54:12] received it. We have received it. We
[54:14] believe on him who sent him. We believe
[54:18] on you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:23] Now in Ephesians 5 and30
[54:36] I'm going to read one verse and then I
[54:38] would like to read two quotes
[54:41] and then you may have your seats after
[54:43] that.
[54:45] Ephesians 5 and30.
[54:48] We'll be reading other scriptures later.
[54:52] For we are members of his body. Who's
[54:56] members of his body? We are.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; We are. Whoever can include themselves.
[55:04] And we we are members.
[55:08] I don't care where you're seated this
[55:10] morning or where people are that are
[55:14] streaming the service.
[55:17] We are members of his body,
[55:21] of his flesh, and of his bones.
[55:25] And I'm going to be stressing the bones.
[55:29] Because when we see one another,
[55:32] you don't see bones.
[55:35] You see the physical part.
[55:38] You see the flesh part.
[55:41] So we say flesh of his flesh. But that
[55:43] doesn't they don't stop there. And the
[55:45] Bible doesn't stop there. And brother
[55:47] Brandham doesn't stop there. He says,
[55:48] "And bones of his bones."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's the revelation Adam had when Eve
[55:57] was taken from him from a rib.
[56:00] Not from a muscle, not from a ligament,
[56:02] but from a rib, a bone. Took that the
[56:08] invisible part and made it visible.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And here we are for a season. You're
[56:14] visible. We see you.
[56:18] Uh I'm sure you're happy that you're not
[56:20] sitting beside a skeleton.
[56:23] But on the other hand, if it wasn't for
[56:25] the skeleton, you wouldn't be standing.
[56:31] So that's the invisible part. And we're
[56:34] very happy that we have the invisible
[56:36] part. I was thinking of you, Brother
[56:39] David, and happy to have
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Brother David here this morning.
[56:46] He can tell you about some of the bones
[56:50] when they become broken.
[56:53] It becomes very painful.
[56:55] And I can tell you that you might be an
[56:58] invisible part of the body of Christ.
[57:02] But if you get fractured or broken,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; we have a lot of pain.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And the pain radiates through the rest
[57:08] of the body. And I want you to know that
[57:11] that's not poetic language and that's
[57:14] not in the dream world. That's in the
[57:16] real world.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; And God's provided place of worship.
[57:25] Brother Brandham has said, "Now remember
[57:28] in Christ we are flesh of his flesh,
[57:32] bone of his bones.
[57:35] When God wounded Christ at Calvary, he
[57:38] was wounded for me and you. We are flesh
[57:42] of his flesh and bone of his bone, body
[57:47] of his body,
[57:49] name of his name, bride of him. See, we
[57:54] are in him.
[57:56] We are his flesh and his bones. And God
[58:00] has already raised us up potentially.
[58:04] The quickening power that raised us up
[58:08] raised us rather from the uh from a life
[58:11] of sin and changed our being. It has
[58:14] potentially raised us up in Christ Jesus
[58:18] which the resurrection will bring us
[58:20] forth in the full maturity.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the resurrection will be.
[58:26] But you have been raised up. Flesh of
[58:28] his flesh, you that are more visible and
[58:33] bone of his bone. You that are not that
[58:36] visible,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; but not less important.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; In fact, is very much the other way.
[58:46] And in the seed shall not be heir with
[58:48] the shock.
[58:50] I read this. Jesus is the word and he is
[58:54] the bridegroom
[58:56] and the bride is part of the groom.
[58:59] Therefore, the word that is to be
[59:02] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[59:05] the word that was fulfilled in his day.
[59:08] And it's the same word, same experience,
[59:12] same life.
[59:14] For when God separated Adam, he was both
[59:19] uh he was both. We find out Adam was
[59:22] spirit
[59:24] to begin with and incidentally that's
[59:27] invisible.
[59:30] the invisible world.
[59:32] He made man of his own image, created he
[59:37] he him male and female
[59:40] and the male became visible and the
[59:42] female remained invisible
[59:46] until he took a bone from Adam and then
[59:50] Genesis 2 and and on he created man out
[59:54] of the dust of the earth. Now he became
[59:57] visible.
[59:59] Man was created in God's image. God is a
[1:00:02] spirit. So he's a spirit man.
[1:00:06] Then when he became flesh man, animal
[1:00:10] flesh on the earth. He is showing
[1:00:13] portraying here the bride. He never the
[1:00:16] bride he never taken and made another
[1:00:20] being but he took part of Adam the
[1:00:24] original creation and took from him a
[1:00:28] rib. You came from an original
[1:00:31] creation of Jesus Christ. He took from
[1:00:34] him a rib from his side and took the
[1:00:38] feminine spirit of Adam and left the
[1:00:41] masculine spirit in there and placed it
[1:00:44] in the feminist part. Therefore, part of
[1:00:48] his spirit, part of his body, flesh of
[1:00:52] his flesh, bone of his bone, word of his
[1:00:56] word, life of his life. And that's the
[1:00:59] way the bride is to Christ.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Can the congregation agree with that?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated
[1:01:13] and keep your Bibles ready if you would
[1:01:15] please.
[1:01:20] I want you to think about the flesh as
[1:01:23] being the visible part
[1:01:26] and the bone as being the invisible
[1:01:28] part.
[1:01:31] Those are both parts. I have just so we
[1:01:35] could get as as good a
[1:01:39] understanding as possible.
[1:01:43] I've taken I had brother John
[1:01:47] uh
[1:01:51] photocopy for me
[1:01:54] so we could get a little better
[1:01:55] understanding.
[1:01:58] But instead
[1:02:00] instead, excuse me, there is absolute
[1:02:04] necessity
[1:02:06] for the parts of the body that are
[1:02:09] considered the more weak
[1:02:13] And those parts of the body which we
[1:02:16] consider rather ignoble
[1:02:19] are the very parts which we invest with
[1:02:23] additional honor
[1:02:26] and our unseemly parts and those
[1:02:31] uh unsuitable for exposure
[1:02:35] are treated not not unsuitable for
[1:02:38] exposure because of appearance But their
[1:02:42] office or their position may be that
[1:02:46] they are not called of God to be
[1:02:50] visible. He says they are treated with
[1:02:53] seemingless modesty and uh something
[1:02:58] less than uh they use the word decorum
[1:03:03] which are
[1:03:05] more presentable parts do not require
[1:03:11] but God has so adjusted
[1:03:14] he's mingled
[1:03:16] harmonized
[1:03:18] those parts and subtly proportioned the
[1:03:22] parts of the whole body, giving the
[1:03:25] greater honor and richer endowment to
[1:03:29] the inferior parts which lack apparent
[1:03:33] importance.
[1:03:36] Now you're you're going to this is going
[1:03:39] to
[1:03:41] kind of set the mind in a different
[1:03:43] channel and needs to be
[1:03:46] because sometimes we've had
[1:03:50] a lot of emphasis
[1:03:53] and no emphasis at all or not even maybe
[1:03:57] mention of
[1:04:00] those that are not visible and do not
[1:04:04] have any recognized honor. But I'd like
[1:04:08] you to know that when
[1:04:10] there are just so many scriptures, so
[1:04:13] many scriptures.
[1:04:15] God took Ezekiel to a valley of dry
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; what? What? Fleshones.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Bones.
[1:04:24] He says, "Can these live?"
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; It looked hopeless.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel said, "Thou knowest.
[1:04:35] And the Bible says that he caused them
[1:04:38] to stand.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Not a heap of flesh, but he caused the
[1:04:42] bones to stand. He put senu on them and
[1:04:46] flesh on them and skin on them. And it
[1:04:49] was a being. And then God breathed into
[1:04:52] it.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Became a living person.
[1:04:56] When Jesus was resurrected from the
[1:04:59] dead, it was the women that came and
[1:05:01] rushed and came early to the tomb and
[1:05:05] and the and seeing two men in uh white
[1:05:10] garments. They said, "See where he lay.
[1:05:14] This is where he was laying." And when
[1:05:17] they stepped outside, they found that he
[1:05:19] was standing there and they held him by
[1:05:21] the feet. He wasn't standing without
[1:05:24] bones.
[1:05:27] He required the body of Christ required
[1:05:32] flesh and bones
[1:05:34] and that was exactly the way it was.
[1:05:36] We'll be going now. I get your mind in a
[1:05:39] certain direction and I want to major on
[1:05:42] that. I've been pondering this and
[1:05:44] actually studying it for probably two
[1:05:46] weeks or more
[1:05:49] and spending a lot of time on it. I want
[1:05:51] to read some scriptures because I would
[1:05:54] like to give a little uh background to
[1:05:57] some of these things.
[1:05:59] I'm I'm just you don't have to follow
[1:06:02] with me uh in your Bible. I will just
[1:06:05] read these scriptures. Acts 1 and3
[1:06:08] to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:06:12] after his passion by many infallible
[1:06:15] proofs being seen of them. I wanted to
[1:06:18] have these on the screen but I'll make
[1:06:20] the emphasis to whom to whom this was a
[1:06:24] certain segment of people a certain
[1:06:27] group of people. If you want to include
[1:06:29] yourself, God bless you. If you don't
[1:06:31] want to include yourself, I can't say
[1:06:34] God bless you. But I I will say you
[1:06:36] should be able to include yourself to
[1:06:38] whom he showed himself. That should
[1:06:41] cause this congregation to say, "Oh God,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; let that resurrected Christ be seen of
[1:06:48] me.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Let that resurrected Christ speak and
[1:06:52] give me ears to hear him."
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:06:58] after his passion by many infallible
[1:07:01] proofs. And that continued on into the
[1:07:04] prophet's ministry. And that has
[1:07:06] continued on since the prophet's
[1:07:09] ministry because it's the same
[1:07:11] resurrected Christ. And he cannot do
[1:07:14] anything but the supernatural things. He
[1:07:17] has done many, many supernatural things.
[1:07:19] And some of his most wonderful things
[1:07:21] cannot even be mentioned over the pulpit
[1:07:24] for one reason or another. But there are
[1:07:27] glorious things,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; glorious things, supernatural miracles
[1:07:32] have happened right here in this
[1:07:34] building. Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; And he was being seen being seen of
[1:07:42] them. Notice the way the scriptur is
[1:07:45] written. 40 days and speaking of the
[1:07:47] things pertaining uh to the kingdom of
[1:07:50] God. He wasn't seen of Caiaphas. He
[1:07:53] wasn't seen of Herod. He wasn't seen of
[1:07:55] Pilate. He wasn't seen of Pilot's wife.
[1:07:58] He wasn't seen of all of these various
[1:08:00] people that were so visible.
[1:08:04] But these that were invisible, they were
[1:08:07] part of his structure,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; part of his flesh and part of his bones.
[1:08:12] And they would rise and under the power
[1:08:16] of the Holy Spirit and take this message
[1:08:19] of his resurrection, he said, "You'll be
[1:08:21] witnesses of me."
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And here we are. We're part of his
[1:08:26] flesh. We're part of his bones. And all
[1:08:29] of us are witnesses of his resurrection.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. I'm getting started here. I
[1:08:36] haven't even haven't even got to the
[1:08:37] beginning. In Acts 4:20, he says, "For
[1:08:41] we cannot but speak the things which we
[1:08:45] have seen and have heard." Others hadn't
[1:08:48] heard it. Others hadn't seen it. Maybe
[1:08:50] they heard a voice, but they didn't see
[1:08:53] who it was that was speaking. In Acts
[1:08:55] 26-16,
[1:08:57] Paul is telling of his uh of his
[1:09:00] conversion. And he said, "But rise," he
[1:09:03] heard this voice that said, "but rise
[1:09:05] and stand upon thy feet, for I have
[1:09:09] appeared unto thee for this purpose, to
[1:09:13] make thee a minister, and a minister and
[1:09:17] a witness, both of these things which
[1:09:20] thou hast seen, and those things in
[1:09:23] which I will appear unto thee." You
[1:09:26] know, there's no record of those men
[1:09:28] that were even with Apostle Paul, that
[1:09:30] close to the pillar of fire, that close
[1:09:35] to the voice of almighty God, creator of
[1:09:39] heavens and earth, that close
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; and missed it. Somehow missed it. I'm
[1:09:46] not being derogatory on them. I'm just
[1:09:48] saying this confirms to us the election
[1:09:51] of God. I'll take one. I won't. I'll
[1:09:54] show myself to him. I'll speak. He'll
[1:09:57] hear me. I'll show him many visions. I'm
[1:10:00] going to bring him into the third
[1:10:01] heaven. Going to do all of these things.
[1:10:04] And the others weren't called to it.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; And that same God that makes that kind
[1:10:10] of selection says, "This will be flesh.
[1:10:14] You'll be a deacon or you'll be a
[1:10:17] preacher or you'll be an evangelist or
[1:10:19] you'll be a witness or you'll be
[1:10:22] whatever." And somebody might not be at
[1:10:25] right in this congregation. This church
[1:10:28] could not function could not function
[1:10:31] and could not God would not bless it
[1:10:34] with supernatural things unless it had
[1:10:37] those that were willing to be part of
[1:10:39] the structure.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Never seen, never heard, never put
[1:10:45] forward. But they are bone of his bone.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] I had the title of this as bone of his
[1:10:54] bone, but I thought I'll change it to
[1:10:56] make it the body of Christ.
[1:11:02] While we look not at the things which
[1:11:05] are seen,
[1:11:07] but at the things which are not seen.
[1:11:11] For the things which are seen are
[1:11:13] temporal, but the things which are not
[1:11:16] seen. I'm going to come down to your
[1:11:18] world right now because I know that you
[1:11:20] become subjected to celebs,
[1:11:24] celebrities.
[1:11:26] I'd like to see them walking out,
[1:11:30] walking down the street in their
[1:11:32] skeletons
[1:11:34] and see how attractive they would be.
[1:11:39] That's what God sees.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; They're not only flesh, they're bones.
[1:11:45] Isn't that the truth?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; And one day that flesh will rot away.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; In a very short time there'll be a pile
[1:11:57] of bones.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; But there were men in the scriptures
[1:12:04] who had a handle. They had a knowledge
[1:12:07] of God in such a way they said, "Don't
[1:12:10] leave my bones down there.
[1:12:14] Jacob said, "Don't leave my bones down
[1:12:16] in Egypt."
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; And I say, "Oh, Father, we have been
[1:12:22] called with a holy calling. Don't leave
[1:12:25] our bones down here.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Resurrect us.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; I'm here for a resurrection."
[1:12:35] Through faith we understand that the
[1:12:37] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:12:41] that things which are seen are not made
[1:12:44] of things which do appear.
[1:12:48] So I wonder now the scientists and all
[1:12:51] of these things they talk about a a
[1:12:53] mirror universe
[1:12:55] or another one. This one certainly can't
[1:12:58] be. I mean foreign earth we're we're
[1:13:01] standing on earth and we feel important
[1:13:03] people but the earth they say has been
[1:13:05] here for hundreds of millions of years
[1:13:08] and you're going to live what 70 80 90
[1:13:11] whatever
[1:13:12] that's a very short period of time
[1:13:14] you're not going to live as long as the
[1:13:16] bark on the trees outside
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; I mean that tree we cut it down use it
[1:13:22] for wood it's going to last longer than
[1:13:24] most people
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; we're insignificant ificant without God.
[1:13:30] [Applause]
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; We're very insignificant without God,
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; without eternal life.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And here's a verse I want to stress now.
[1:13:45] For the invisible things of him
[1:13:50] from the creation of the world are
[1:13:52] clearly seen.
[1:13:54] Isn't that a paradox? the invisible
[1:13:58] things of him. Now don't shut your mind
[1:14:01] off think you can't you many of you are
[1:14:03] students and university students etc.
[1:14:07] Others are teachers and teach Sunday
[1:14:10] school teachers or teachers in school.
[1:14:12] You can grasp this. For the invisible
[1:14:16] things of him
[1:14:19] from the creation of the world are
[1:14:21] clearly seen, being understood
[1:14:25] by the things that are made. So the
[1:14:29] things that are made, the things that
[1:14:32] can be seen are evidence of invisible
[1:14:35] things.
[1:14:37] This isn't the only world. The prophet
[1:14:40] said, "I'm standing in two worlds."
[1:14:42] Well, do you think the one he was
[1:14:44] standing in simply because you couldn't
[1:14:46] see it was less important? No, by all
[1:14:50] means, far more important. It was an
[1:14:52] eternal realm. We call it another
[1:14:55] dimension. It's another world.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; There's another life.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; A life that was stronger than the life
[1:15:01] of the cancer that was taking this
[1:15:03] person to death.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You're taking them illegally.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; You have no right to this body. Are you
[1:15:11] with me, friends? That you have no right
[1:15:13] to this body. Come out of her, Satan.
[1:15:17] Come out of him in the name of Jesus
[1:15:19] Christ. And that word still works today.
[1:15:23] You may be afflicted right in your chair
[1:15:26] now. You may be afflicted in your room
[1:15:28] now. But I say by the same authority,
[1:15:32] not from this world, but from another
[1:15:34] world that was poured into us and called
[1:15:38] us and elected us to be a special
[1:15:41] elected people. Satan, we have control
[1:15:44] over you. Come out of those people. Come
[1:15:48] out of the church of the living God. Do
[1:15:51] you accept that? Do you accept that?
[1:15:54] Come out of them in the name of Jesus
[1:15:57] Christ.
[1:15:59] Hallelujah.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Now, we just start at Genesis for a
[1:16:07] little background. And God said, "Let us
[1:16:09] make man in our image after our
[1:16:12] likeness, and let them have dominion
[1:16:15] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[1:16:17] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[1:16:20] and over all the earth, and over every
[1:16:23] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:16:25] earth." So God created man in his own
[1:16:30] image.
[1:16:32] This was the invisible man.
[1:16:35] God is a spirit. The Bible says and the
[1:16:39] prophet says the first man he made was a
[1:16:42] spirit man.
[1:16:45] And the spirit man is not visible.
[1:16:51] Brother Brandon even when he was coming
[1:16:54] to the place where he would stand
[1:16:56] between two worlds or stand in another
[1:16:59] world
[1:17:01] I want to say to you I sat where you say
[1:17:04] are sitting and looked upon a physical
[1:17:07] man I didn't see the bones of him but I
[1:17:11] saw the physical part of him
[1:17:15] and I saw God use that flesh
[1:17:18] a God's a God saw him and used him in
[1:17:21] such a way that me as an individual who
[1:17:25] could not go there
[1:17:28] had to had to confess that there was
[1:17:31] another realm there's another place
[1:17:33] there's another world and he would step
[1:17:35] into it and bring down a knowledge so
[1:17:39] that my ears in this this realm I could
[1:17:42] hear it and he could speak it sometime
[1:17:45] would say can you hear me at the back
[1:17:47] can you here because he said I I don't
[1:17:51] know whether you can hear it and he's
[1:17:53] talking now he's bringing wisdom down
[1:17:57] he's bringing knowledge from another
[1:17:59] world going through this orphice or this
[1:18:01] vessel that prophet vessel called of God
[1:18:05] and speaking to humans the truth
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; that made the thing that was afflicting
[1:18:11] them a lie
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; who is proposing that lie upon them and
[1:18:16] say well I got this affliction, I have
[1:18:18] this medication. Listen, friends, don't
[1:18:21] let that that's fine, but don't let that
[1:18:23] be where they end your confidence is
[1:18:26] we're connected to another world. We're
[1:18:28] connected to another life, and we have a
[1:18:31] direct connection by the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:18:40] upon Adam, and he slept and took one of
[1:18:43] his ribs.
[1:18:45] God took one of his ribs.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Man tries to figure out which rib,
[1:18:50] forget it. God took it.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Whether it's still there, we don't know.
[1:18:56] Whether it's gone, we don't know. But he
[1:18:57] took a bone.
[1:19:06] slept. And he took one of his ribs and
[1:19:10] closed up the flesh thereof instead
[1:19:14] instead thereof.
[1:19:16] And the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:19:19] from him made
[1:19:22] he a woman
[1:19:28] and brought her unto the man. So he took
[1:19:32] an invisible part. He took the bone, a
[1:19:36] rib, an invisible part and made.
[1:19:42] Think of the wisdom.
[1:19:44] Think of the plan.
[1:19:47] Think of the scheme.
[1:19:49] I'm going to make something that this
[1:19:52] man will have such a revelation about
[1:19:56] that he will leave his father
[1:19:59] and he will leave his mother
[1:20:01] and join himself to this woman.
[1:20:06] This that was invisible which I have
[1:20:10] made visible. He will join himself to
[1:20:14] her and they will live till death do
[1:20:18] them part.
[1:20:23] And Adam said
[1:20:25] when he brought the woman to him,
[1:20:28] and Adam said, "This now is bone of my
[1:20:31] bones
[1:20:33] and flesh of my flesh.
[1:20:37] she shall be called woman because she
[1:20:40] was taken from the man.
[1:20:45] And that's why you have a prophet that
[1:20:47] says they're both the they're both the
[1:20:49] man,
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And says in the when she's manifested,
[1:20:54] when the bride of Jesus Christ, the
[1:20:56] bride of Jesus Christ is manifested to
[1:21:00] the world, both flesh and bones, both
[1:21:03] visible and invisible, that makes up the
[1:21:07] body of Jesus Christ. And Paul is
[1:21:10] writing, just in case you don't see it
[1:21:13] that way, I will rest all members of the
[1:21:16] body of Jesus Christ and those that are
[1:21:19] more in noble or more unseen. And you
[1:21:23] give them greater honor because without
[1:21:25] that, the body can't function.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm getting my point across.
[1:21:40] You that are married, your wives leave
[1:21:44] and are gone for a while and you have to
[1:21:47] make your own bed and make your own
[1:21:50] breakfast and so forth.
[1:21:55] I don't like it.
[1:22:00] And I and I even feel less secure.
[1:22:04] My My wife's not there to protect me.
[1:22:06] I'm supposed to protect her, but I'm
[1:22:08] more insecure when she's not there.
[1:22:11] I go checking the doors and make sure
[1:22:14] the doors are locked cuz I don't want
[1:22:15] anybody coming. My wife's not here to
[1:22:17] protect me.
[1:22:23] It's just a It's just a sense.
[1:22:27] And now if if if this is the body of
[1:22:30] Christ, that's the way Christ, he has a
[1:22:34] much just a grasp and understanding of
[1:22:37] things, how significant and how
[1:22:40] important every part is.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And so you are members
[1:22:46] of my body.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; You are members
[1:22:51] of my body. What's he saying? He's
[1:22:53] saying, "I can't function without you.
[1:22:57] I'm not going to come down as a flame of
[1:22:59] fire. You're the only thing that people
[1:23:02] are going to see and not only see, but
[1:23:04] they're going to be affected."
[1:23:09] Jason, I just see you in for a moment.
[1:23:13] Excuse me. But you went to China
[1:23:16] with the school
[1:23:18] and you plan to, you know, interpret for
[1:23:21] the kids. So you'd use your voice and
[1:23:24] they'll see you and you'll meet your
[1:23:26] parents and you'll embrace them etc etc.
[1:23:30] But after
[1:23:32] some days,
[1:23:34] I just want to make my point. After some
[1:23:38] days, your father who had no outward
[1:23:43] inclination
[1:23:45] of having a desire towards godly things,
[1:23:48] was not a believer, was not a Christian,
[1:23:51] but he comes to Murphy and he says,
[1:23:56] "Whatever Jason has,
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; I want."
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:24:06] It's part of the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It's the invisible part that has become
[1:24:12] visible through a witness.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; But the witness wasn't saying anything.
[1:24:17] The witness was just being a witness.
[1:24:20] Just just expressing a part of Christ,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; but that part's a living part.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; This congregation should be mature
[1:24:29] enough
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; to catch that.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And that's not deep. You might say
[1:24:34] that's very elementary. Then rejoice in
[1:24:36] the elementary part of it.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He said the first man was in the image
[1:24:46] of God. This is in God's power to
[1:24:48] transform. 65. The first man was in the
[1:24:52] image of God which is spirit. John 4
[1:24:56] says God is a spirit and they that
[1:24:59] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:25:01] and in truth. But God is a spirit. And
[1:25:04] the first man that he created was spirit
[1:25:07] man. And he was in the image and in the
[1:25:11] likeness of God. And then he put this
[1:25:14] man in flesh. Watch this. Now I have
[1:25:18] this highlighted.
[1:25:19] Then he put this man in flesh and man
[1:25:22] fell. So then God came down and became
[1:25:26] in the image of man that he might redeem
[1:25:30] that fallen man. That's the real gospel
[1:25:34] story
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; to my opinion. He said
[1:25:41] took man from the invisible world
[1:25:46] to a physical world and now is taking
[1:25:49] the redeemed back to the eternal unseen
[1:25:53] invisible world that we came from.
[1:25:56] That's why we talk about body change,
[1:25:59] but we kind of lose it there because we
[1:26:01] say, "How's that going to happen? I
[1:26:03] don't know how it's going to happen. He
[1:26:05] said it.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; I don't even know why I'm here. Why are
[1:26:08] you here? How did you come? Oh, you came
[1:26:11] by a birth, did you? Do you understand
[1:26:13] the birth? People don't understand the
[1:26:15] birth. Everything that happens in those
[1:26:17] last moments, a few moments when a child
[1:26:19] is born and takes a gasp of breath and
[1:26:22] mother and dad are there and you're
[1:26:24] looking at an invisible world. You don't
[1:26:27] even know what's happening. Science
[1:26:29] can't even figure out what's happening.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And we're going to tell God what he's
[1:26:33] doing or God's word when it's right or
[1:26:35] wrong. Forget it, friends. We're We're
[1:26:38] so insignificant. We're only here by the
[1:26:41] grace and mercy.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; That's that's true humility. I believe
[1:26:51] when we realize that we're not too much.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; And as God taken from Adam, is is that
[1:26:59] thy word?
[1:27:01] And as God taken from Adam a rib,
[1:27:04] unseen, I I'm I'm adding the word
[1:27:07] unseen. And made Eve out of it. He taken
[1:27:10] from the side of Christ, unseen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Taken from the sight of Christ and made
[1:27:16] the church out of it. And we together
[1:27:19] will walk in the paradise of God
[1:27:22] someday. Amen.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; In one of these uh quotes, it's a
[1:27:31] wonderful part.
[1:27:34] Brother Brandham was I was trying to
[1:27:36] explain it to my wife yesterday, but and
[1:27:38] I may not explain it to you, but some of
[1:27:40] you ministers might be able to take a
[1:27:41] hold of it. And and I hadn't recalled
[1:27:45] reading that quote exactly like that. He
[1:27:48] says, "And they came to break the bones,
[1:27:53] the legs of Jesus."
[1:27:55] And that was very prominent in my mind.
[1:27:57] I was reading that quite a bit. And they
[1:28:00] came to break the bones of it because
[1:28:02] the scripture says, "There shall not a
[1:28:05] bone of him be broken."
[1:28:07] And he says he drew back the hammer
[1:28:10] to break the bones. says, "And then a a
[1:28:14] a soldier drove the spear into his side,
[1:28:18] and out came blood and water into from
[1:28:21] his heart, and he said he was already
[1:28:23] dead."
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So, they didn't need to break the bones.
[1:28:27] He was already dead. And then he just
[1:28:30] goes into another world. He said the
[1:28:33] bride was already redeemed
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and it didn't need that.
[1:28:41] The bride was already redeemed. He says,
[1:28:44] "Now for those that are coming in the
[1:28:46] tribulation, they believe in Jesus,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; but they're not in the bride."
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; See, oh, he just sees it all over the
[1:28:55] place, friends. And they'll go through
[1:28:58] the tribulation,
[1:29:00] but they're not in the bride.
[1:29:02] Friends, I'm so glad I can speak and say
[1:29:06] to this church and have breath in my
[1:29:09] body to tell you that we were redeemed.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; He took the invisible world once again.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; He took the spirit of God. Hallelujah.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; And he became the he he became the uh
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:26] I don't want to say orphice but he
[1:29:28] became the vessel through which he
[1:29:30] carried that re power of redemption.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And we became redeemed by that act.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; And when God says a person's redeemed
[1:29:40] and if you're in the mind of God, you're
[1:29:42] redeemed. There's no way to become
[1:29:44] unredeemed. You are redeemed.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel like singing I am
[1:29:50] redeemed.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; I am redeemed.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; If anybody asks you who I am, tell them
[1:29:56] I'm redeemed.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Let the church say so.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Took from the woman. Took the woman the
[1:30:11] bride from the sight of Christ.
[1:30:15] invisible
[1:30:16] from the invisible world to the flesh
[1:30:20] brought it down and that's why the Holy
[1:30:22] Spirit came on the day of Pentecost and
[1:30:25] what was it that were like drunk people
[1:30:27] that were like humans that was flesh
[1:30:30] people that was flesh flesh of his flesh
[1:30:34] not only that bone of his bone
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; life of his life
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; you're not just making plans down here
[1:30:43] and going and getting ahead head. That's
[1:30:45] not it, friends.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not here just serving
[1:30:52] flesh.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; We're flesh of his flesh.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Bone of his bone.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Word of his word.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Let's hear the people say it. Word of
[1:31:03] his word.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Word of his word.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Word.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; And life of his life.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; She is him.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. She is him.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; What he desires, we desire. What he
[1:31:19] wants said, we say.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Where he wants a person to go, we go.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have to have feet.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I haven't got some flesh. I got
[1:31:29] some bones in there.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And the bones and the feet work together
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; to accomplish the word of God.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "And who is this Melzdc? You
[1:31:43] come like Adam, like me.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Talking to the people. You come like
[1:31:48] Adam. You come like me.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; You came like brother Brennan.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; You become from the attribute.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; The invisible.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; To the flesh.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; You have an attribute.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; You are an attribute.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You come from an attribute to the flesh
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; to be tempted. Oh, we don't maybe like
[1:32:13] that. But that's why you came down. You
[1:32:16] become visible to be tempted.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; But you are an attribute. So don't just
[1:32:22] say, "Well, I'm, you know, my mother's
[1:32:24] this." And go back and figure out where
[1:32:26] you come from and all the rest of it.
[1:32:29] That's not important.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; It's nice to maybe find out.
[1:32:42] I've had several say to me every once in
[1:32:44] a while, "Why don't you go back and
[1:32:48] search your search your roots and find
[1:32:52] out? I think you're Jewish."
[1:32:57] Well, that's a compliment, but what does
[1:32:59] that mean? Does that mean I won't get
[1:33:01] older or you're Jewish? You're royalty.
[1:33:06] blah blah blah.
[1:33:12] You know, God has chosen quite a few in
[1:33:14] this message. It's royalty.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; What's that mean? Going to sit in a
[1:33:21] different seat. They're going to have
[1:33:23] different friends. So, it's nothing.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; But now I can say I have his the royal
[1:33:30] blood
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; flows through my veins.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Now you're saying something. You're
[1:33:36] saying a new creation. I'm part of a new
[1:33:39] creation. Hallelujah. I'm not part of
[1:33:42] this world. I don't love this world. I
[1:33:46] can't stand this world. And like
[1:33:48] Marilyn's song is, this world is getting
[1:33:50] cold to me. I'm getting un on I I don't
[1:33:55] have any affection for it.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because my home is in another
[1:33:59] place.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; And that's not just a dream world.
[1:34:03] That's not some some fictitious
[1:34:05] something. That's a reality.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; You come like Adam did from an attribute
[1:34:17] to the flesh to be tempted. But when
[1:34:20] this life is finished here,
[1:34:23] and it will be,
[1:34:26] whether it's by change or whatever, if
[1:34:29] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we
[1:34:32] have one already waiting.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Already waiting. Already waiting.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; How many can say already?
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Already
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; waiting.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:48] That's where we go.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That is the word. When we can look back
[1:34:54] and see what we done.
[1:34:57] Now you now we don't understand it.
[1:35:01] We have never become the word. We've
[1:35:04] just become the flesh man, not the word.
[1:35:08] But uh and and look, he said clearly
[1:35:11] makes it clear. You will never be the
[1:35:14] word unless you was a thought at the
[1:35:16] beginning. Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; This is not saying you're not the word.
[1:35:20] Period. No. If you were a thought, you
[1:35:24] shall be the word.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; If you're a thought, you are whatever
[1:35:28] God thought about.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "But look clearly." Makes it
[1:35:34] clear. You will never be the word unless
[1:35:36] you were a thought at the beginning.
[1:35:38] That proves the predestination of God.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; You can be the You can't be the word
[1:35:44] unless you're a thought. Amen.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; You had to be in the first.
[1:35:53] But you see, in order to stand
[1:35:54] temptation,
[1:36:00] you're going to really think this is
[1:36:02] strange.
[1:36:04] But when Satan comes to you, and he
[1:36:05] does, and he will,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; and he comes to you with temptation,
[1:36:10] just tell him to get lost
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; and come back someday and tempt your
[1:36:16] skeleton.
[1:36:19] Just tempt my bones.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You know, it's the flesh we have problem
[1:36:24] with. True.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Is this getting way off someplace?
[1:36:31] Anyway, as long as you don't say, "Oh,
[1:36:33] God, ship Brother Red off."
[1:36:38] I thought about this a long time. I
[1:36:41] thought about and I was thinking about
[1:36:43] you sisters and I thought, "Boy, people
[1:36:44] aren't going to understand this. How in
[1:36:47] the world do you get people to think
[1:36:48] about the bones?"
[1:36:51] Nothing very attractive about your
[1:36:52] bones.
[1:36:54] when you look and say like Dan Daisley
[1:36:57] gets up in the morning and in case you
[1:37:00] don't know Dan Dasley he was a little
[1:37:01] short stubby guy great big and you know
[1:37:04] and he wore real thick glasses like
[1:37:07] looking through the bottom of two coke
[1:37:09] bottles
[1:37:10] and he says he says he says every man
[1:37:13] that loves himself loves his wife or
[1:37:15] something like that you know and he says
[1:37:18] and he gets up in the morning and looks
[1:37:20] into the mirror
[1:37:23] and
[1:37:25] if you knew him as I did and he'd say,
[1:37:28] "You handsome dog."
[1:37:34] I thought anybody that could be that
[1:37:37] shape of a guy and say, "You handsome
[1:37:39] dog," he wasn't seeing very clear
[1:37:42] through those coke bottles.
[1:37:48] But if you could stand in front of the
[1:37:50] mirror and all you'd see is bones.
[1:37:54] tomorrow morning.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Just bones.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't be very handsome either.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; But God put them there.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Put everyone there.
[1:38:12] You wouldn't want to be brother Tom and
[1:38:14] having
[1:38:16] being laying on a on a bed and I think
[1:38:19] they were pulling out the slivers of
[1:38:21] bones
[1:38:23] with the tweezers
[1:38:25] the whole ankle bone gone
[1:38:28] taking and the doctor saying you golf
[1:38:33] yeah he loved golfing said you won't uh
[1:38:38] you won't golf came.
[1:38:41] Why?
[1:38:43] It was the bones.
[1:38:46] Wasn't the flesh. It was the bones. Your
[1:38:49] whole life has changed
[1:38:52] because these bones are just splinters.
[1:38:56] What you did, what you enjoyed, what you
[1:38:58] loved, you won't do it anymore
[1:39:01] because the bones are gone.
[1:39:04] Brother Dave was David Jernoff was
[1:39:07] telling me when he laid under that truck
[1:39:11] and he said he was crushed.
[1:39:15] He's going to give his own testimony
[1:39:19] soon.
[1:39:21] We're waiting to hear it. But when he
[1:39:23] was crushed,
[1:39:25] he had eight ribs, eight bones, eight
[1:39:28] ribs broken. Eight. I've never heard of
[1:39:30] eight ribs broken.
[1:39:33] and he knew that he had to move somehow,
[1:39:37] but he was pinned. And if he didn't get
[1:39:40] that truck off of him and get free of it
[1:39:43] just so he could breathe, he'd be gone
[1:39:46] in a few minutes.
[1:39:48] Tell you what, friends, there will come
[1:39:50] a time
[1:39:52] there will come a time in your spiritual
[1:39:55] life, you'll find out that those that
[1:39:58] were not important in the church were
[1:40:02] very important.
[1:40:05] And the Bible says on those that are are
[1:40:08] seem in noble and they seem uh
[1:40:11] insignificant, heap more honor on them.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. God heaps more honor on them.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not done preaching
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; now. You know, we're so affected by what
[1:40:32] we see.
[1:40:35] A theophony is something
[1:40:38] you could
[1:40:40] that you could not see, but it could be
[1:40:43] right here now.
[1:40:47] So that's what I want to get across to
[1:40:49] you.
[1:40:51] There's a there's a part of this message
[1:40:57] that we really are don't understand.
[1:41:00] And because we don't understand it, we
[1:41:02] don't give it any importance.
[1:41:05] And the prophet said that your theophony
[1:41:07] is here.
[1:41:10] And because you don't see it, you don't
[1:41:13] think about it.
[1:41:17] your theophony that when you were born,
[1:41:20] you bypassed that
[1:41:22] through natural sexual life, birth. We
[1:41:27] all came the same way and we all
[1:41:30] bypassed that.
[1:41:32] But he said it's here.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; It's waiting for you.
[1:41:37] This one that you have now by your
[1:41:40] mother you die. By the woman you die,
[1:41:44] and by the man I'm giving I'm giving
[1:41:47] quotes now to the scripture. By the man,
[1:41:50] Jesus Christ, you'll live.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; What came from his side, you live. But
[1:41:56] the body that came from your mother, by
[1:41:59] that you die. You get older and you just
[1:42:02] die.
[1:42:04] I don't know how beautiful you are or
[1:42:06] how how much sports you ability you have
[1:42:10] or how skilled you are or how smart you
[1:42:12] are or what skills you have or what you
[1:42:16] have in the in uh in the world. That's
[1:42:19] only for this world and I just want to
[1:42:22] tell you about it. It's just going to
[1:42:23] kind of fade away and fade away. you'll
[1:42:27] get where you're not so
[1:42:30] you're not so agile and you're not so
[1:42:34] quick to respond and that that'll just
[1:42:37] be natural. That's the natural that's
[1:42:39] this body. I want you to get acquainted
[1:42:43] with the one that's near you
[1:42:46] and that's the one that you feed when
[1:42:49] you feed on the word. Don't come here
[1:42:51] just to hear something.
[1:42:55] come here realizing that there's one
[1:42:57] beside you that needs to feed and it's
[1:42:59] actually a part of you. It's a part of
[1:43:02] you. It's it's if you're an attribute
[1:43:04] from God and you come from God, you have
[1:43:07] another
[1:43:09] I want to I want to give you a
[1:43:10] description of a bone.
[1:43:15] Hello.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want to speak to a bunch of
[1:43:20] skeletons.
[1:43:23] You're all you all got a skeleton
[1:43:26] and it's not very handsome or very
[1:43:29] pretty, but you're here in a in a body
[1:43:32] of flesh that God gave you. But inside
[1:43:35] you have a capacity.
[1:43:38] And that's that capacity that hungers
[1:43:40] after God.
[1:43:42] They that hunger after God
[1:43:45] and after righteousness. Invisible.
[1:43:47] Invisible. They that hunger. Describe
[1:43:50] your hunger to me.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Describe Describe your thirst for me.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Show it to me.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Where? And I have so many people say,
[1:44:03] "Well, I love you, Brother Biscol. I I
[1:44:06] take it with a not a grain of salt, but
[1:44:08] a ton of salt
[1:44:10] so much of the time because I Brother
[1:44:12] Brenam says, "Well, you know what is
[1:44:16] love? go down to the drugstore and get
[1:44:18] me some.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; What is love? You it's it's it's it's
[1:44:24] invisible. It's part of a realm I don't
[1:44:26] understand.
[1:44:29] And I've had all kinds of I've I've
[1:44:32] married over a hundred young couples.
[1:44:35] Brother Tom and the other ministers,
[1:44:36] Brother John has ministered some more. I
[1:44:38] don't know how many others have been
[1:44:40] married,
[1:44:43] but I tell you,
[1:44:45] I and my wife, we're coming to an
[1:44:47] anniversary in in the spring. And I can
[1:44:50] tell you something about love that
[1:44:54] you probably don't know. And you
[1:44:56] wouldn't recognize it with the with the
[1:44:58] human
[1:44:59] understanding. You wouldn't recognize
[1:45:01] it.
[1:45:05] And don't come and ask me about it
[1:45:07] because I can't describe it. But all I
[1:45:10] can tell you, I I know enough about it
[1:45:12] to tell you that that most people don't
[1:45:15] understand
[1:45:16] the path that they're going to be
[1:45:18] taking.
[1:45:22] So if theophony is something that you
[1:45:24] have, it's yours.
[1:45:26] It's what God intended in the first
[1:45:29] place
[1:45:33] and standing beside you. And if you pass
[1:45:36] this world, you're going to go to it.
[1:45:44] Do you know the message?
[1:45:47] If you want to read who is this MelzDC,
[1:45:49] a theophony is something that you could
[1:45:51] not see. It could be here now
[1:45:55] yet you cannot see it. It's just like
[1:45:59] television.
[1:46:02] You all know what television is.
[1:46:06] That's another dimension. Now, here's
[1:46:08] here. This isn't an IT man. He's way
[1:46:10] beyond it.
[1:46:12] He's way beyond.
[1:46:17] We have men here understand all of that.
[1:46:19] Way beyond me, but they're not beyond
[1:46:21] this
[1:46:23] prophet here.
[1:46:25] People are moving right through this
[1:46:27] room now. I had to think of that.
[1:46:31] People are moving right through the Can
[1:46:33] you see them? No, you don't see them.
[1:46:35] There's people moving through this room.
[1:46:36] They got birth marks on them. They're in
[1:46:38] certain color clothes. You don't see it.
[1:46:43] And he said, "People are moving right
[1:46:45] through this room now singing. Do you
[1:46:48] hear them?"
[1:46:51] I can't hear them. He said they're
[1:46:54] singing.
[1:46:59] He said but the eye is only subject to
[1:47:02] five senses. So he said your whole being
[1:47:04] is only subject to five senses rather
[1:47:07] and you are only subject to what the
[1:47:09] sight has been limited to see. But there
[1:47:13] is another dimension
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; there is another dimension
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; and it is here. Whether you believe in
[1:47:23] it or don't believe in it or have your
[1:47:25] own ideas about it has nothing to do
[1:47:27] with me. Here's
[1:47:30] someone who was ordained of God to
[1:47:33] describe it for you.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And you do well to ponder it very
[1:47:38] seriously
[1:47:43] that can be seen by a transformation
[1:47:47] by a television. There's another
[1:47:49] dimension.
[1:47:52] Now, television does not manufacture a
[1:47:54] picture. A television only channels it
[1:47:57] into a circuit and then the television
[1:48:00] screen picks it up. But the picture is
[1:48:03] there to begin with.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Now we have a television.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Someone who stood here and told a
[1:48:11] vision.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; And spoke and the the spoke the words of
[1:48:15] the vision and the words of the vision
[1:48:17] got scribed onto paper. And you are so
[1:48:21] you are so privileged to be able to read
[1:48:23] what the television said, what the
[1:48:26] vision was.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; And the television was here when Adam
[1:48:31] was here.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Television was here when Elijah was on
[1:48:35] the mountain.
[1:48:38] On Mount Carmel, television was here
[1:48:40] when Jesus of Nazareth
[1:48:43] walked the shores of Galilee. We don't
[1:48:46] see him. Television doesn't pick it up
[1:48:48] now, but it was here back then.
[1:48:51] This is This isn't This isn't strange.
[1:48:53] This isn't weird.
[1:48:56] This is the truth. This is what's
[1:48:57] happened. This is what's happening. This
[1:49:00] isn't history.
[1:49:02] He's saying this is what's happening
[1:49:04] now. And your theophony is here.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Your theophony was here. God God thought
[1:49:13] if you are elected, it it had nothing to
[1:49:16] do with the oh, Satan's going to get a
[1:49:18] hold of you and you're going to be
[1:49:19] brought down into a hell on earth. And
[1:49:22] that doesn't mean nothing to God. I've
[1:49:25] provided a way.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; I've provided not an escape away.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; They are my sons.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; They are my daughters
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and sin and hell can never have them.
[1:49:40] They shall not corrupt.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; You know what started this?
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; You know what started this service? I'll
[1:49:50] just tell you. In the middle of the
[1:49:52] night, night after night,
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; I think she's bone of my bone.
[1:49:57] Bone of my bone. I hadn't even read the
[1:49:59] scripture.
[1:50:01] The brightest bone of my bone.
[1:50:05] So I thought, I'll look at that. And you
[1:50:07] know what? the bone in the Old Testament
[1:50:09] and the bone in the New Testament.
[1:50:12] I don't know if I can just get get to it
[1:50:15] now.
[1:50:17] Will you give me just a moment?
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you uh just from what I
[1:50:33] have been studying, is it all right for
[1:50:35] me to take my time like this?
[1:50:39] The bone is not the invisible. I've been
[1:50:41] telling you that. But it has to do with
[1:50:45] uh those that are
[1:50:48] uh the comy parts. C O M E L E Y L Y
[1:50:53] rather. Comely parts. And the calmly
[1:50:56] parts are those parts are uh calmly in
[1:51:01] in one
[1:51:03] translation is the the honorable
[1:51:08] the graceful
[1:51:11] perhaps elegant in figure
[1:51:14] in bearing
[1:51:17] oneself be in speech or behavior
[1:51:21] one in good standing.
[1:51:23] Just listen close now.
[1:51:26] Honorable, respectful,
[1:51:29] and something that a person has and
[1:51:32] holds dear.
[1:51:36] I'll tell you, you want to describe all
[1:51:39] those things. It is the the graceful
[1:51:42] part,
[1:51:44] the delicate part perhaps.
[1:51:50] Doesn't say it's ever weak. is strong.
[1:51:54] I I want to describe now you sisters for
[1:51:56] a moment. There are sisters here who
[1:51:59] have never said a word.
[1:52:03] They've never sang a song.
[1:52:07] They've never played an instrument.
[1:52:12] You are as much a part of the body of
[1:52:15] Christ as a man who stands behind the
[1:52:17] pulpit.
[1:52:23] You may not be eligible for a certain
[1:52:25] office.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; You may not be an evangelist or a pastor
[1:52:31] or a prophet or an apostle.
[1:52:35] You may not be eligible. You may not be
[1:52:38] a deacon.
[1:52:41] And there's there's churches out here
[1:52:43] will say you can be a deaconist.
[1:52:46] You can turn on the television. You can
[1:52:48] see them preaching
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; completely haywire out of their place.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen close,
[1:52:58] but not any less important.
[1:53:02] They might be part of the skeleton
[1:53:05] because I want you to believe this word
[1:53:08] now. They are flesh of my flesh. And you
[1:53:11] may see the flesh of a deacon coming
[1:53:14] down the aisle
[1:53:16] and so on. You may see the flesh of the
[1:53:19] minister or the flesh of the song leader
[1:53:22] or the people that are playing
[1:53:25] instruments,
[1:53:27] but there is bone of my bone. And I can
[1:53:31] tell you in God's economy, there is not
[1:53:34] a single bone
[1:53:36] that is less important than another
[1:53:38] bone. And there's not a single bone
[1:53:41] that's less important than the most
[1:53:43] prominent of flesh.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; I said that because I felt I had to say
[1:53:55] it.
[1:54:01] And I'm continuing on.
[1:54:09] When brother Brandham was talking about
[1:54:11] the
[1:54:13] the unseen, the television, another
[1:54:17] world, he's he's not just talking about
[1:54:19] television. Let's not get hooked on
[1:54:21] that. Talking about there's another
[1:54:23] place.
[1:54:26] Let me say I feel like preaching.
[1:54:30] If you could just get a glimpse for the
[1:54:32] next three, four, five seconds of that
[1:54:35] other world, you'd never want to be in
[1:54:37] this one again.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me, kids?
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; Do we hear me? Young people, you young
[1:54:46] attractive ladies and young fellows,
[1:54:51] you might be able to pump a lot of
[1:54:53] steel. You might not, you won't pump any
[1:54:55] over there.
[1:54:56] You wouldn't even want to say, "Oh, if I
[1:55:00] could just be there." And I'll tell you
[1:55:02] what's going to impress you is the
[1:55:06] Brother Bisclled.
[1:55:09] Brother Biscll and I can tell you I'll
[1:55:12] tell you a little bit about it.
[1:55:17] It was a place like where color
[1:55:21] and feeling merge.
[1:55:24] The color is just like emerald. Soft,
[1:55:28] beautiful green.
[1:55:30] And the feeling is like so
[1:55:34] so peaceful
[1:55:37] body, soul, spirit. You not a thought,
[1:55:40] not a problem, not nothing.
[1:55:44] Not worried about your job or not
[1:55:46] worried about a bill to pay. And you
[1:55:49] know the first thought that came through
[1:55:50] me? I said, "Just let me live here
[1:55:54] forever.
[1:55:59] I want to live here forever."
[1:56:02] It just just lasted a few seconds.
[1:56:07] And that's what it is, friends.
[1:56:10] And that's right beside you.
[1:56:14] There's another world.
[1:56:17] And you people are here. how privileged
[1:56:19] you are to to believe in a a prophet
[1:56:22] that God called. The people that say all
[1:56:25] kinds of nasty things and the people who
[1:56:27] turned against him, they didn't have a
[1:56:29] clue what they were turning because they
[1:56:31] couldn't see it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; It was invisible.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; And just because it's invisible doesn't
[1:56:40] it's right here. It it's it's here. It's
[1:56:42] close as your next breath. And I can
[1:56:45] tell you every person here, I'm not
[1:56:47] lying to you. I'm telling the truth. If
[1:56:50] if you just had a few seconds there,
[1:56:53] you'd say,
[1:56:55] you'd be exactly like brother Bam. You
[1:56:57] say, "Do I have to go back?"
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Do I have to go back across the curtain
[1:57:03] of time? It's only a breath away.
[1:57:07] And then he'd say something. This isn't
[1:57:09] some great great revelation, but I'd
[1:57:12] like to say I'd like to repeat. Yeah.
[1:57:14] He'd say, "Don't don't miss it."
[1:57:18] Whatever you do, don't miss that.
[1:57:23] And brother Ed is standing here today
[1:57:25] saying, "Whatever you do, don't miss
[1:57:26] that."
[1:57:28] I don't care what this world is, all all
[1:57:31] the stuff that you get in all engaged
[1:57:33] in. And
[1:57:35] you know we have at our homes and your
[1:57:37] families you have your soccer and you
[1:57:40] have your games and you have this and
[1:57:42] you have your school and you have your
[1:57:44] studies.
[1:57:47] Don't don't let it become too prominent.
[1:57:51] Just say I'm just getting through this
[1:57:53] world. Give it your best shot. Do your
[1:57:56] best.
[1:57:58] But just remember you're not staying
[1:58:00] here very long.
[1:58:03] What you learn will last you. And do
[1:58:05] your best. Be real be real diligent
[1:58:08] about it. Do your very best.
[1:58:34] I had to write this. I had to get this
[1:58:37] down on the computer again. And
[1:58:41] what you want to be able if if God gives
[1:58:43] you life upon earth
[1:58:47] see I I can say some of these things cuz
[1:58:49] I'm here
[1:58:52] but whatever I said and uh I had to I
[1:58:56] had to write and I pasted in my Bible
[1:58:59] all the way. If you ever get to be
[1:59:01] brother Ed's age
[1:59:04] or where you are right now, what you
[1:59:08] want to be able to say is all the way
[1:59:11] my savior leads me.
[1:59:15] What have I to ask besides?
[1:59:20] Can I doubt his tender mercy?
[1:59:24] Who through life has been my guide?
[1:59:36] You know, young people love to go to
[1:59:38] BCA.
[1:59:39] You know why I'm so dedicated to BCA?
[1:59:43] Cuz I'm a dropout.
[1:59:47] What grade are you in?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Eight.
[1:59:55] What grade are you in?
[1:59:59] 10.
[2:00:01] That's when I dropped out.
[2:00:04] I didn't finish my 10th year.
[2:00:15] That is why we are so
[2:00:19] gripped in our heart. Something it's not
[2:00:22] visible.
[2:00:26] If I could have only been in a school
[2:00:31] where people prayed,
[2:00:36] it was so terrible
[2:00:38] and whatever was in me.
[2:00:43] One of the last things I remember
[2:00:45] they're having Satie Hawkins day. I
[2:00:48] said, "What? I've never heard of that."
[2:00:51] Well, that's when the girls are out cuz
[2:00:53] there's a dance or something going on
[2:00:57] and the girls get to pick who they want.
[2:01:01] And I remember riding my bicycle to
[2:01:03] school to big new high school, nice high
[2:01:06] school. It's the only time I was in that
[2:01:08] school.
[2:01:11] And I rode my bicycle and there's a girl
[2:01:14] standing at the front door. Bunch of
[2:01:17] them waiting for the guys to come from
[2:01:21] lunchtime.
[2:01:24] And I thought
[2:01:26] isn't for me.
[2:01:29] This isn't for me. Do you know why
[2:01:31] friends?
[2:01:33] Maybe don't understand it now, but there
[2:01:35] is something inside calling.
[2:01:38] I wasn't scared.
[2:01:40] I said, "This just isn't this isn't my
[2:01:43] life. This isn't my world." I was
[2:01:45] uncomfortable.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; I could yell
[2:01:52] to make it more impressive for you.
[2:01:56] But do you ever feel uncomfortable?
[2:02:00] It's because you weren't made for this
[2:02:03] world. Amen.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; It's not because you are going through
[2:02:08] hardship
[2:02:09] or whatever you went through, but you
[2:02:11] don't feel comfortable here
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; because it's you're not made for this
[2:02:16] world.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; You're made for another place.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; And God has prepared it for you.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; He said even a prophet comes here and
[2:02:24] says he he made it lovely for you. He
[2:02:27] made it for he you have certain likes
[2:02:30] and certain desires. He made it it just
[2:02:32] for his bride. He suited it out. Made it
[2:02:35] just perfect for her.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; This is so different for me.
[2:02:46] And now I'm I'm actually speaking just
[2:02:48] right of my heart.
[2:02:51] You know why? I said God
[2:02:54] I don't even know. I don't know how God
[2:02:57] provided. I don't I don't know how God I
[2:02:59] don't know how this building and I don't
[2:03:01] know how all this how all you people
[2:03:04] came
[2:03:07] I don't understand all those things but
[2:03:10] I can say one thing Jesus led me
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; all the way
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; and if there's anything I can say to you
[2:03:19] when you get there
[2:03:21] and you don't don't want to wait till
[2:03:23] you get there what you want to say this
[2:03:25] morning is I want I want him to lead me.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; What do you know about your future? Very
[2:03:32] little. What do you know about your
[2:03:34] skills? What do you know about what do
[2:03:36] you know about what's going to happen?
[2:03:39] You don't want to call on him in the
[2:03:40] midst of a disaster.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate what brother Dave was
[2:03:46] able to say when he's being crushed.
[2:03:50] It really affected me. He said there he
[2:03:55] was crushed under that truck and he
[2:03:57] didn't know if he was going to live for
[2:03:59] another five minutes. But he he thought,
[2:04:03] "I'm glad I don't have to make anything
[2:04:06] right."
[2:04:10] What a statement. I'm so glad I don't
[2:04:13] have to make anything right.
[2:04:15] Everything's okay.
[2:04:18] And if I have to go, I have to go. Can
[2:04:22] you say that, folks? Can you say that?
[2:04:24] Young people, can you say that, kids?
[2:04:28] It's okay.
[2:04:30] If he wants to take me now, I'll go.
[2:04:35] Serious business, friends.
[2:04:38] Serious business. But that's what life
[2:04:39] is all about.
[2:04:59] I just had to hold back
[2:05:03] otherwise I maybe would have gone into
[2:05:07] area that I didn't want to go.
[2:05:12] But you young men and you young ladies
[2:05:18] that you have a future. Maybe you have
[2:05:20] some marriage
[2:05:23] in your future.
[2:05:26] You want God to be your guide.
[2:05:32] You want God to be your guide.
[2:05:37] I'll tell you that you're looking
[2:05:39] towards a time that Satan's got all of
[2:05:42] his target on
[2:05:45] the home, the family,
[2:05:48] husband and wife.
[2:05:51] He's got all his target. He's got all
[2:05:52] his ammunition. He has all of his
[2:05:57] and you've waited for a short time.
[2:06:01] You think about marriage,
[2:06:06] whatever you do,
[2:06:08] don't step into a piece of hell.
[2:06:14] You're better to wait.
[2:06:17] You're better not to get married
[2:06:21] than to step into hell itself
[2:06:24] because it'll either be heaven or hell.
[2:06:29] And in in the best mar listen I'll never
[2:06:31] say this to you but in the very best
[2:06:34] marriages
[2:06:40] there's plenty of
[2:06:42] there's plenty of trouble
[2:06:45] in the very best marriages.
[2:06:47] But when you have flesh and bones both
[2:06:51] and you agree
[2:06:54] there's nothing that can stand against
[2:06:56] that.
[2:07:40] I don't want you to go from this
[2:07:42] building and forget this.
[2:07:48] When the scripture speaks about
[2:07:50] husbands, love your wives.
[2:07:55] She may not have the prominent place
[2:07:57] that you have,
[2:08:01] but you are too. Give more honor to the
[2:08:03] calmly part.
[2:08:06] Give more honor to it.
[2:08:11] I think of a man
[2:08:14] and he was a believer
[2:08:16] and his wife was not a believer
[2:08:20] and he wanted to know how he could cast
[2:08:22] the devil out of her.
[2:08:25] You know what the prophet of God, you
[2:08:26] know what the said?
[2:08:30] Buy our box of chocolates.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; And I know that. Yeah. Maybe we smile at
[2:08:38] that.
[2:08:39] No, he's giving you a big secret.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; You'll get more you'll get more distance
[2:08:48] and you'll get more achieve. You'll
[2:08:50] achieve more with a box of chocolates
[2:08:53] than trying to cast the devil out of
[2:08:55] her.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; What am I saying? Why am I saying this?
[2:09:01] Why am I speaking this way? It's because
[2:09:03] we are so human. We are so attached to
[2:09:06] physical things. We're so controlled by
[2:09:09] our senses and it's time that we depart
[2:09:12] from that and get in tune by the Holy
[2:09:16] Spirit. It might take more prayer. It
[2:09:19] might take more contemplation
[2:09:27] these messages. The reason I'm speaking
[2:09:30] from my heart is
[2:09:32] I I may not
[2:09:37] I may not be on my knees and wailing
[2:09:40] before God over what I should be saying,
[2:09:42] but I'm saying, "God,
[2:09:45] give me something that touches
[2:09:46] somebody's life."
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm waiting on you and I'm I'm
[2:09:50] pondering these words and I'm I'm I I'll
[2:09:54] read something that the prophet did and
[2:09:55] then I'll say, "Why did he do that?
[2:10:00] Why did he say that?"
[2:10:02] And I seek to go down into it and to
[2:10:05] become a part of it. And I see something
[2:10:08] happen in the scripture and I I I read
[2:10:11] about it. The people did different
[2:10:12] things. I had different actions to
[2:10:14] Christ and he was the word. He's the
[2:10:17] word. We got the word and have different
[2:10:19] actions to him. I said why did they do
[2:10:21] that? Why didn't they offer themselves?
[2:10:25] Why didn't they? And it's like something
[2:10:27] says to me, what would you do? And
[2:10:30] brother Brandman then when he says you
[2:10:32] know you have to say yourself in the
[2:10:33] scripture where would you be what would
[2:10:36] you be doing in this I I I asked myself
[2:10:39] serious questions. Would I be loving
[2:10:41] him? Would I be rejecting him? Would I
[2:10:44] be just casual about this thing or would
[2:10:47] I you know and it takes more it takes
[2:10:50] more than just hearing it. You you've
[2:10:53] got to take it into yourself. And like I
[2:10:56] said in this prayer for this baby
[2:10:58] dedication,
[2:11:00] we gave her this name
[2:11:02] because she we want her to be tender.
[2:11:06] Not very many are tender. You were
[2:11:08] right, brother Rickard, Sister Andrea.
[2:11:10] Not too many are tender. Oh God, make us
[2:11:14] tender. When the minister gets up
[2:11:16] tonight to speak, oh God, make me
[2:11:20] tender.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; To the word.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:25] I've got pages more, but I'm not going
[2:11:27] to go any further. I'm going to ask you
[2:11:29] to bow your head with me.
[2:11:35] Dear father,
[2:11:38] you yourself know alone.
[2:11:42] You know how much more I would I could
[2:11:45] continue on and say and my human mind
[2:11:48] feels it may be important.
[2:11:51] But just now, Lord, I feel that
[2:11:55] there are people here.
[2:11:57] They're precious people.
[2:12:00] There are people that you died for,
[2:12:02] Jesus. You thought of them while you're
[2:12:05] on your journey to Goltha.
[2:12:09] You're thinking of them. I must I must
[2:12:11] give myself for them. They will hear it
[2:12:14] sometime.
[2:12:16] I'll have faithful messengers.
[2:12:20] And in this day, Lord, how thankful as
[2:12:22] my wife and I spoke on the way to to the
[2:12:25] church this morning. Oh God, how
[2:12:28] thankful how thankful we are that you
[2:12:32] sent our precious brother Brandham, a
[2:12:35] faithful one that would not he would not
[2:12:40] compromise on your word. He would say it
[2:12:43] even say things that we hear and maybe
[2:12:46] we cringe Lord because we think it was
[2:12:49] so hard. But yet from the things that he
[2:12:52] was seeing, he saw that harlot church.
[2:12:55] He saw the denomination. He saw how
[2:12:59] Satan was slithering around like a
[2:13:02] serpent using all these acceptable
[2:13:05] things in the world. acceptable to the
[2:13:08] flesh,
[2:13:09] acceptable to the human senses,
[2:13:12] acceptable but yet unacceptable to you
[2:13:15] because you had something better for
[2:13:17] them. It didn't stop at this life. It
[2:13:19] didn't stop in this world. It wasn't
[2:13:22] bound to these few things. And we see
[2:13:24] and we hear him say, the more what does
[2:13:27] science have in store for you? The more
[2:13:30] death it has more death and finer car, a
[2:13:33] nicer car, a nicer home. You have all of
[2:13:37] these all of these things, Father. You
[2:13:39] saw it all and how he would use it to
[2:13:42] his advantage. And yet you seek to point
[2:13:44] us to another place, another world,
[2:13:47] another creation, oh God. And you've
[2:13:50] left all of these special secrets, very
[2:13:54] very uh unique secrets. You've left
[2:13:56] them. And you sent a prophet to uncover
[2:14:00] them so that we could see them. And then
[2:14:02] you'd come into meetings such as this
[2:14:05] and touch our hearts and move upon us.
[2:14:08] Oh father, achieve your goals. Achieve,
[2:14:14] I pray. Oh father, these hearts are
[2:14:18] yours.
[2:14:20] The bride that you
[2:14:23] have called is yours,
[2:14:27] Lord. And we are here for one purpose.
[2:14:30] We are here to demonstrate our love for
[2:14:33] you. Jesus, my Jesus, I love you.
[2:14:39] I ask for the people whose hearts have
[2:14:42] been touched.
[2:14:44] Oh God, thou knowest.
[2:14:47] Thou knowest.
[2:14:50] [Music]
[2:14:54] Relax.
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:15:19] I'd like to say, "Speak my Lord. Speak
[2:15:21] my Lord. Speak my Lord.
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:31] Speak my Lord.
[2:15:36] Speak my Lord.
[2:15:42] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:15:49] [Music]
[2:15:50] Speak my
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Don't sing it as a song now.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord.
[2:16:02] Seek and I will answer.
[2:16:06] Lord, send me.
[2:16:10] Wonder if you'll sing it again. Maybe
[2:16:12] you like to stand.
[2:16:15] And I' I'd like to ask a request. This
[2:16:18] is a request from brother Biscll. Now,
[2:16:21] please don't sing it just as a
[2:16:24] song.
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:27] Don't think we're at the end of the
[2:16:28] service. We're not at the end of the
[2:16:30] service.
[2:16:32] Going to continue on. You're going to
[2:16:34] think about these things after you leave
[2:16:36] this building. You're going to be
[2:16:39] thinking about these things. And I'm
[2:16:42] praying
[2:16:43] and it'll be different because I'm
[2:16:45] praying that the Holy Spirit this
[2:16:46] afternoon stay right with you, right by
[2:16:50] you, impregnate your mind and will not
[2:16:54] you will not be able to get it out of
[2:16:56] your mind. Don't try to get it out of
[2:16:58] your mind because I'm going to pray now
[2:17:00] that it will stay in your mind. It'll
[2:17:04] stay within you. Uh you won't be able to
[2:17:07] shake it. You say some of the things
[2:17:10] that I've heard, God affect my life.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Let me come under the transforming
[2:17:16] power.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Let me sense it.
[2:17:20] Let me feel it. Guide my
[2:17:23] footsteps. Lord,
[2:17:26] keep me out of trouble.
[2:17:29] Keep me from making wrong decisions.
[2:17:33] Keep me from any trap
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; that the devil sets for me.
[2:17:40] Friends, you realize that the enemy is a
[2:17:43] lot smarter than any of us.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; He'll set traps for people they don't
[2:17:48] even realize they walk into them. Say,
[2:17:50] "Oh God, keep me from them."
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. I want you
[2:18:01] to say it. Sing it that you desire him
[2:18:05] to speak to you now.
[2:18:09] My
[2:18:13] scream my Lord.
[2:18:18] Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:18:25] [Music]
[2:18:27] Speak my Lord.
[2:18:31] Speak my Lord.
[2:18:37] Speak and I will answer.
[2:18:42] Lord, send me. Now everyone singing
[2:18:46] please. Speak my Lord.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, dear Lord Jesus. Speak my Lord.
[2:18:58] speak and I'll be quick to answer thee.
[2:19:07] Oh, speak my Lord.
[2:19:12] Speak my Lord.
[2:19:18] Speak and I will answer.
[2:19:23] Lord, send me.
[2:19:28] While you're playing it,
[2:19:32] dear Lord Jesus,
[2:19:35] somebody may want to just if you feel to
[2:19:39] lift your hand,
[2:19:41] but above all things,
[2:19:44] just pray with me. Father,
[2:19:48] I would love to put my arms
[2:19:51] around the brothers, lay my hands upon
[2:19:55] the sisters
[2:19:58] and pray with them. And so I'm here now
[2:20:01] praying with them. Oh God,
[2:20:05] God of the future, God who's the same
[2:20:08] yesterday and today and forever. The God
[2:20:14] that has raised up messenger, our
[2:20:18] messenger, the God that raised up the
[2:20:21] ministry, the God that has called the
[2:20:24] bride, Lord. And many perhaps do not
[2:20:27] know what they've been called to. But
[2:20:29] let them realize that there's another
[2:20:31] realm that we are hearing a voice from
[2:20:34] another place. We are hearing, oh God,
[2:20:37] something calling from another world. Oh
[2:20:40] God, and it's a real place. We hear your
[2:20:43] prophet's voice. Don't miss this. Oh
[2:20:47] God, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:20:50] you'll prepare hearts, Lord, that they
[2:20:52] may live here like strangers. Let the
[2:20:55] people here live here like strangers and
[2:20:58] pilgrims. Lord, just traveling through.
[2:21:02] Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:21:05] take these homes, take these families,
[2:21:08] and you will care for them. Oh God,
[2:21:11] you'll watch over them. Some of them may
[2:21:13] be right now in in the destitute straits
[2:21:17] or in some circumstance of life. They
[2:21:20] might have some family or children
[2:21:23] difficulties that is causing a pain to
[2:21:26] their heart. Let them know, oh God, that
[2:21:29] you're the almighty one, you have
[2:21:31] control of these things. We pray that
[2:21:34] you'll go out and deal with those that
[2:21:36] need to be dealt with. I pray, oh God,
[2:21:39] those that have been swallowed up by
[2:21:42] this world and this life, let let it all
[2:21:45] fall from them like a super structure.
[2:21:48] Let it fall away from them. Let them
[2:21:50] find themselves, oh God, hanging on to
[2:21:53] the the the very very shaky ground where
[2:21:57] they may be, but let them find, Lord, uh
[2:22:00] something solid that they can be
[2:22:03] recalled. Let a re let a recollection of
[2:22:05] a message they heard, something that was
[2:22:08] said, a sentence. Oh God, I pray in the
[2:22:12] name of Jesus Christ that you'll speak.
[2:22:15] Oh father, take the few words that have
[2:22:18] been spoken and take these words that
[2:22:20] have been uttered. Oh God, I know that
[2:22:23] it's reached down into the soul of those
[2:22:26] those that are here. I pray, Father, in
[2:22:29] Jesus Christ's name, that they shall not
[2:22:33] be able to forget those words. Lord, I
[2:22:36] pray that you will work with it. I pray,
[2:22:38] oh, Holy Spirit, I commit the message to
[2:22:41] you. I commit the people to you. I
[2:22:44] commit this day to you. This is the
[2:22:47] Lord's day. Continue to speak throughout
[2:22:49] the day, oh God, and bless your people,
[2:22:52] I pray, in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:22:56] Amen.
[2:22:58] Amen.
[2:23:02] You know, a few days ago, uh, in the
[2:23:05] faith challenge report,
[2:23:07] Brother Matthew Redell, you sent me an
[2:23:09] email. I don't want to belabor this, but
[2:23:13] I want to I got another email from a
[2:23:15] pastor in another country. Said, I've
[2:23:18] read the Faith Challenge report.
[2:23:20] He said, "Now, I want to ask you a
[2:23:22] question. I still have to answer this."
[2:23:25] And it's it was quite long and detailed.
[2:23:29] He said, "You said in there,
[2:23:34] she hath done what she could." You've
[2:23:36] heard brother Murphy preached on it.
[2:23:39] Different ones have mentioned it. And he
[2:23:42] comes up with it also. And he says, "Now
[2:23:45] I'm wondering,
[2:23:47] I worked with Bible believers for some
[2:23:50] years.
[2:23:51] I am pastoring now for some years.
[2:23:56] But now I wonder
[2:23:58] as time has gone on,
[2:24:01] family has grown into their teens and
[2:24:04] maybe into their early 20s. I wonder
[2:24:07] now,
[2:24:09] what does God what would God have me to
[2:24:11] do?
[2:24:13] I'm asking the question.
[2:24:16] She has done what she could. I wonder if
[2:24:18] I've done what I could.
[2:24:21] And and that's what I want to leave with
[2:24:23] you. We want to do what we can.
[2:24:27] Oh God, maybe convey something from your
[2:24:32] just live some kind of a
[2:24:34] I want to say to you graceful.
[2:24:38] You are the you are the people of the
[2:24:40] earth that is able to extend a real
[2:24:44] grace. This is not emotion. This is not
[2:24:47] sympathy. This is not just holding
[2:24:50] somebody's hand and helping them through
[2:24:52] life. But this is something that I want
[2:24:55] to convey and I'm saying this in my last
[2:24:58] comments. You possess it.
[2:25:01] You hold it. Hold it to yourself. You
[2:25:05] have a certain grace that God has given
[2:25:08] you. You're not just flesh of his flesh,
[2:25:11] but you are bone of his bone. You're his
[2:25:14] dignity.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; You're his grace.
[2:25:17] You're the essence. And that's a word
[2:25:20] that I hoped I wouldn't forget during
[2:25:22] this service. You're the very essence of
[2:25:24] his being. It's not something that you
[2:25:27] do,
[2:25:30] but it's something that you are. You
[2:25:33] possess it. You possess it. And God sent
[2:25:36] you this message. He sent you this
[2:25:38] message. Young people, you think you
[2:25:40] hear the message, the message, the
[2:25:42] message. He sent it to you to give you
[2:25:44] qualities that this world can never give
[2:25:47] you. He sent to give you things uh uh
[2:25:51] certain graces and certain qualities and
[2:25:54] and and certain things that are in
[2:25:57] impossible for me to describe. But I can
[2:26:00] tell you one thing, they will be
[2:26:02] resident in your life and in your body.
[2:26:06] They'll be resident in your home.
[2:26:09] They'll be resident with your family.
[2:26:12] They'll be resident when you meet as it
[2:26:15] was Joshua. Uh Josh
[2:26:18] unsaved father preachers couldn't move
[2:26:21] him. Maybe other things can't move him,
[2:26:24] but it's something that is is so
[2:26:27] impossible to describe, but I'm here to
[2:26:30] scream it out to you. It's real.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; It's absolutely real. Absorb it.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; Let it soak in.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[2:26:46] I'd ask you to go home and when you
[2:26:49] leave this place, ask yourself this
[2:26:51] question.
[2:26:54] What did a female dear?
[2:26:59] What kind of sermon did she preach
[2:27:03] to a man that brother Brandham said had
[2:27:05] kind of lizard eyes,
[2:27:07] real man,
[2:27:11] and blew a whistle in this life
[2:27:14] in the visible world blew a whistle
[2:27:20] of a wounded fawn or a lost fond dear
[2:27:25] and a big mother do
[2:27:27] steps boat in front of the gun in front
[2:27:31] of a
[2:27:33] evil evil hunter,
[2:27:37] shoots to kill.
[2:27:40] And brother Brandham, here a prophet
[2:27:42] that you say is a prophet. He's your
[2:27:45] prophet and he stands there. Oh God,
[2:27:47] don't let him do it. Don't let him blow
[2:27:50] the loyal heart of this mother dear out
[2:27:55] just for sport. Don't let him do it.
[2:28:01] And he's got a gun up.
[2:28:03] I want to ask
[2:28:06] this congregation, what kind of a sermon
[2:28:08] was she preaching?
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; What was she conveying to him? Tell me
[2:28:14] about it. Get me a glass full of it.
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:19] go down to the store and buy me a
[2:28:21] dollar's worth. Buy me a $100 worth of
[2:28:25] what it was.
[2:28:27] And I'm saying to you men and women of
[2:28:31] this congregation,
[2:28:33] don't let us stand here and take that so
[2:28:37] in such a casual way or so flimsy. That
[2:28:41] was real.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; She was real. She was conveying
[2:28:46] something. I'm saying something to you.
[2:28:49] You have a right. You have an essence.
[2:28:52] You have a possibility to take the
[2:28:56] substance of this message. Something
[2:28:58] that's indescribable. Something that's
[2:29:00] unseen. But take that unseen. Say, "Oh
[2:29:04] God, let it exude out of my body. I
[2:29:07] don't even know what to say. I don't
[2:29:08] know how to say it. I don't know how to
[2:29:10] describe it, but there needs to be
[2:29:12] something within me. Oh God. Oh God, I
[2:29:17] grant I I I pray he grant it to you in
[2:29:20] Jesus Christ's name. Now I just unloaded
[2:29:23] my heart a little bit more and I say God
[2:29:26] bless you. God bless you. God bless you.
[2:29:30] You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:29:34] It's 1:00. I don't want to keep you any
[2:29:36] longer.
[2:29:37] You go pondering these things.
[2:29:40] God bless you.
[2:29:50] [Music]
[2:30:04] Quick correction to the announcement
[2:30:06] that I made earlier about the Sunday
[2:30:08] school. There is not a Sunday school
[2:30:09] practice at 3:00. It's for the helpers.
[2:30:13] So, if you're one of the helpers, make
[2:30:14] sure that you're there at 3:00.
