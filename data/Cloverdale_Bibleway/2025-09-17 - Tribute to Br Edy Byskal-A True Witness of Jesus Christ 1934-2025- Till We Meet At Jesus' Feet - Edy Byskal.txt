TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I thank Brother Byskal, Edy, as I know him, a real precious boy. I really fell in love with this young lad when I met him up at Dawson Creek. My first time was Grand Prairie, but he was at Dawson Creek at the time, and I met him there. And and he was telling me about he was missionarying to the Indians, and I said, Eddie, I'm coming up to Canada again one of these days, and I'll drop in and see your friends. He said, Just fine. just a little story to my Indian brethren and all. I like to hunt, oh I just love to hunt my, my! That's my second nature. My conversion never took that out of me and I...I like to tell you a little story about hunting right here where God told me exactly your pastor brother Byskal remembers it, Brother Sothman back there where he told me exactly what I was going to do where I'd go a caribou I'd get where he'd be land a man would have a green checkered shirt on and would kill a grizzly bear before it got back that right Hundreds of people I told went right there and Edy heard me tell it. The day before we left down there two days later he stood right there and seen every bit of it come just to pass. I said the horns will be exactly 42 inches high. And the guide said 42 exactly. He said brother Banham after he said where's that grizzly bear up on top of this mountain? Said brother Branham according to what you told me that you're going to kill a grizzly bear before you get back to where Edy Byskal standing with a green checkered shirt on and his wife and put it in a camp bag and he told me he didn't even have one. Go be somebody's gonna have it. Well, it's going to be there. And he had that green checkered shirt on, said before we get back there. I said that, he said. Brother Branham, I had a brother had epilepsy and you told me when he had this fit again, to jerk his shirt off and throw it into the fire and he wouldn't have it anymore. Well. He did and God healed him of it. Now, he said then I can't disbelieve it, but where's that bear going to be? I said, he's Jehovah Jireh. He can provide himself a bear to make his word come to pass. And when we just about half a mile from him, being about three miles from him, was about a half a mile from him, said, Brother Branham, we just got a half a mile farther. Where's the bear? I said, don't you... I said, what's that, Bud? There was a nine- foot silver tipped grizzly standing up on top of the hill looking right at me. He said we got in 500 yards and said, brother Branham, did you ever shoot a grizzly? I said I shot many bear. He said you better shoot him from here. I said no, the vision said I was right up on him. He said, oh, brother Branham, you said shoot him in the back now, he said, cause if you don't shoot him in the back they are great fighters. I said I know, but this one in the vision I shot in the heart. He said ooh! And I said, just keep going, Bud. We went over another little coulee and came up and it was right close to him, about 200 yards. I said, this is just right. I said wait it until it looks around, looked like a big haystack. H e turned and looked at me, and just as he turned and looked at me, I shot he right smack in the heart. And here he rolled over the hill like that, as far as he could come like that. Bud stood there, turned white in the mouth. He said, brother Branham, I didn't want him on my lap. He said, now if them horn s are exactly 42 inches when I get down there, I'm going to have a screaming fit. I said, you better have it right here because it's going to be. He said, I got a measure in my saddlebag, and we got down there. The vision said a little hand would hold the horns. I pulled up beside of Brother Edy there. I said I watch that boy hold that horn and he went around, got that tape measure, brought it out, put it down the base of the head, that little hand, his boy, Blayne, held it, went up there. Bud said mercy, Brother Branham. Right smack on the nose, 42 inches! I said, Bud, He never fails. He was just exactly. Oh, ohh he's God! When we can see something real is genuine. That's what that queen wanted to see, something real.
