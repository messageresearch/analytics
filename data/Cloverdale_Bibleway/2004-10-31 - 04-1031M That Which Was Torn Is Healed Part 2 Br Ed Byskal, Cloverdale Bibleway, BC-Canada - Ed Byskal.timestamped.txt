[11:10] Amen. Lord Jesus, ask our brother John
[11:13] Andes to come and open the service in a
[11:16] word of prayer.
[11:19] Uh our brother Morris Cochril is
[11:21] requesting us to pray for sister
[11:23] Glattis. mother passed on to be with the
[11:27] Lord and just wanting us to pray that
[11:30] the Lord would give Glattus wisdom to
[11:32] witness and be a comfort to her family.
[11:35] And uh Sister Claire is requesting
[11:37] prayer for a friend who was stricken
[11:40] suddenly with a crippling disease. She
[11:42] and her husband are Christians and ask
[11:45] or asking the congregation to pray for
[11:47] her healing. Sister Claire has witnessed
[11:50] to her husband already. Uh, sister Liz
[11:53] Neighbor is requesting prayer for Sharon
[11:56] uh Stzman, a young mother from Indiana,
[11:59] Indiana who's been given a few days to
[12:02] live. Apparently, her lungs are full of
[12:04] cancer. She has battled through brain
[12:06] tumors, surgeries, bone cancer, pancreas
[12:09] cancer. Her faith is very high and she
[12:12] is asking to live to be able to take
[12:13] care of her family. Amen. So, let's just
[12:16] unite our hearts
[12:18] this morning with these. If you're here
[12:21] and you have a request in your heart, if
[12:23] you're listening in,
[12:25] you just lift before the Lord as we go
[12:27] to prayer. Amen.
[12:32] I wonder again this morning if we could
[12:34] all just pray out in your own way right
[12:36] there where you're at, even our
[12:38] musicians up to the sound people into
[12:41] the nursery, wherever you're at in the
[12:42] building. Don't have the person leading
[12:45] in prayer say your prayer for you. Just
[12:48] cry out to the Lord. Speak to him right
[12:50] there where you're at. And I believe God
[12:51] will do
[12:53] &gt;&gt; greater things for us when we just let
[12:55] go and let him have his way right at
[12:57] this time. Let's lift up our hearts
[12:59] together. Father, our hearts are lifted
[13:01] up. Our hands are lifted up. Father,
[13:04] we've come this morning expecting the
[13:06] supernatural. Lord, our hearts are ready
[13:09] and prepared for your presence. Lord,
[13:11] right now at the start of this service,
[13:13] we've sang. We've praised you. We want
[13:16] to lift up our hearts in total
[13:17] surrender, Lord. Father, this whole
[13:20] congregation, myself, we want to lift up
[13:22] our voices in adoration and praise.
[13:25] Father, you've done a miracle in our
[13:27] lives. You've done a new creation right
[13:30] among us, Lord. You've healed our
[13:32] bodies. You've healed our souls. You've
[13:34] healed our wounded spirits. Lord, we
[13:37] want to thank you for that, Lord. You
[13:39] are the same yesterday, today, and
[13:41] forever. You're alive and you're the
[13:44] same, Father. We want to confess it,
[13:46] Lord, that you are our Lord. You're our
[13:49] savior. You're our husband, Father. We
[13:52] want to adore your name and put you in
[13:54] your rightful place. We want you to have
[13:56] preeminence, Jesus. Lord, we don't want
[13:59] to have this service without you. We
[14:01] want you to come down among us in a
[14:03] special way, Father. God, there's lives
[14:05] here. My hands are lifted up, Father. We
[14:08] need your appearing, God. We love your
[14:10] appearing. We love your word. We love
[14:13] your presence. Father, if somebody could
[14:15] just speak the right word, somebody
[14:17] could pray in the right way. These
[14:20] demons of cancer, these demons of of
[14:23] torment, demons of lethargy, demons of
[14:26] of fear, and whatever would stand in the
[14:29] way, Lord. Father, may they be broken
[14:31] this morning in the name of Jesus
[14:33] Christ. Loose every brother, every
[14:36] sister, every young person, every older
[14:39] one. Father, Father, we're headed to
[14:41] award communion service, Lord. We want
[14:44] to prepare ourselves. We want our hearts
[14:46] to be right. Lord, even this morning,
[14:48] Lord, we want your word to be direct to
[14:51] our lives as disciples. Lord, we want to
[14:54] watch and wait and pray with you, not be
[14:57] falling asleep, but we want to be right
[14:59] there, Father, hearing your voice,
[15:02] praying with you, having the mind of
[15:04] Christ.
[15:06] We want your will to be done in earth as
[15:09] it is in heaven. All across the
[15:12] building, our hands are lifted up.
[15:13] Unspoken requests, these that were read
[15:16] out, Father,
[15:18] nothing is impossible for you.
[15:22] Let your will be done in these lives.
[15:24] Father, glorify yourself for the glory
[15:28] of God. Let your will be manifested in
[15:31] healings, in character. Lord, we want to
[15:34] wait on you. Let the mind of Christ drop
[15:37] down inside of each one of us. Jesus,
[15:43] we say yes, Lord. Have your way today,
[15:46] God. We've waited for this day and we
[15:48] believe that today is a wonderful day
[15:51] because we're near our homecoming time
[15:53] and there must be precious words that
[15:56] will proceed to our hearts from your
[15:58] throne. I believe somebody's going to be
[16:00] healed today. Somebody could be saved,
[16:03] Lord, right even now.
[16:05] someone could be filled with the Holy
[16:06] Spirit as we stand waiting in your
[16:09] presence. Our lives being cleansed,
[16:11] sanctified, filled up. Oh God, I just
[16:14] pray that your presence would be so
[16:16] pleased today
[16:18] by the gathering of your people even out
[16:21] over the internet and the phone hookups
[16:23] that lives would stand and be delivered.
[16:25] Oh God, may it happen, Father. Take
[16:29] control of every life, every need. We
[16:32] surrender it to you now, believing
[16:35] already the answer is on the way. You're
[16:38] giving us what we have need of. We thank
[16:41] you for it. Bless Brother Rod. Bless the
[16:44] service. Bless the remainder of the
[16:46] service. Bless every worshipper in
[16:48] spirit and in truth. Come down among us,
[16:51] Jesus. Do the impossible. We pray in
[16:54] Jesus name. We thank you, Lord. Amen.
[17:00] Amen.
[17:03] You may be seated.
[17:17] Want to welcome all those who are here
[17:19] visiting with us. And I know we got a
[17:20] lot of the saints from Seattle that are
[17:22] here today uh to be with us. and we're
[17:25] happy to have each and every one of you
[17:27] and want to make sure that everyone here
[17:28] at the church makes a real welcome. Um,
[17:33] uh, note from brother Jason, there's
[17:34] going to be no senior choir practice
[17:36] after the service this morning. And, uh,
[17:39] we have a special this morning for
[17:41] brother Mark Hegman and brother Matthew
[17:43] Wilson. Why don't you guys come and get
[17:46] ready at this time, brothers? And, uh,
[17:48] while they're uh, while they're doing
[17:50] that, let's sing together. Consume me
[17:53] Lord with the fire of your spirit. Is
[17:55] that your desire this morning?
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be burnt up. The zeal
[18:00] of the Lord.
[18:02] Consume
[18:04] me Lord
[18:07] with the fire of your spirit.
[18:13] Come to
[18:15] me Lord
[18:18] and make me all like you.
[18:23] Break
[18:25] me, Lord,
[18:28] and bless the broken
[18:31] pieces of my life.
[18:34] [Music]
[18:37] Let me be used
[18:42] by you.
[18:47] Consume
[18:49] me, Lord. Lord, with the fire of your
[18:55] spirit,
[18:57] come to
[18:59] me, Lord,
[19:02] and make me more like you. Oh, praise
[19:09] me, Lord,
[19:12] and bless the broken pieces
[19:16] of my life.
[19:21] Let me be you
[19:26] by you.
[19:40] The gates and doors were barred and all
[19:43] the windows fastened down. I spent the
[19:47] night in sleeplessness and rose at every
[19:51] sound.
[19:52] Half in hopeless sorrow and half in
[19:56] fear. The day would find the soldiers
[19:59] breaking through
[20:01] to drag us all away.
[20:08] Just before the sunrise, I heard
[20:11] something at the wall. The gate began to
[20:15] rattle and a voice began to call. I
[20:19] hurried to the window and looked down
[20:22] into the street, expecting swords and
[20:25] torches
[20:27] and the sounds of soldiers feet.
[20:31] [Music]
[20:34] There was no one there but Mary, so I
[20:36] went down to let her in.
[20:39] John stood there beside me as she told
[20:42] us where she'd been. She said they moved
[20:45] him in the night and none of us knows
[20:48] where. The stones been rolled away and
[20:51] now his body isn't there.
[20:55] We both ran toward the garden. Then John
[20:58] ran on ahead. We found the stone and the
[21:02] empty tomb just the way that Mary said.
[21:05] And the winding sheet they wrapped him
[21:07] in was just an empty shell.
[21:11] But who or where they'd taken him was
[21:14] more than I could tell.
[21:20] Something strange had happened there.
[21:22] Just what I did not know. John believed
[21:26] a miracle, but I just turned to go.
[21:30] Circumstance and speculation couldn't
[21:33] lift me very high.
[21:36] because I'd seen them crucify him. And
[21:40] then I saw him die.
[21:44] [Music]
[21:46] Back inside the house again, the guilt
[21:49] and anguish came, and everything I'd
[21:53] promised him just added to my shame.
[21:57] When at last it came to choices, I
[22:00] denied I knew his name.
[22:04] And even if he was alive,
[22:07] it wouldn't be the same.
[22:14] Then suddenly the air was filled with a
[22:16] strange and sweet perfume. A light that
[22:20] came from everywhere drove shadows from
[22:22] the room. Jesus stood before me with his
[22:26] arms held open wide.
[22:30] I fell down on my knees
[22:34] and clung to him and cried.
[22:38] [Music]
[22:40] He raised me to my feet. And as I looked
[22:43] into his eyes,
[22:47] love came shining out from him like
[22:50] sunlight in the skies.
[22:53] The guilt and my confusion disappeared
[22:56] in sweet release.
[23:00] And every fear I'd ever had
[23:03] just melted into peace.
[23:08] [Music]
[23:17] He's alive.
[23:19] He's alive.
[23:22] He's alive and I'm forgiven. Heaven's
[23:25] gates are open wide. He's alive. Alive.
[23:29] He's alive.
[23:32] He's alive and I'm forgiven. Heaven's
[23:35] gates are open wide. He's alive.
[23:42] Hallelujah.
[23:45] He's
[23:47] our life.
[23:50] [Music]
[24:00] Praise God.
[24:02] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's alive this morning?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's here.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[24:08] Praise God. And we can know him this
[24:09] morning. We believe we're going to be
[24:10] here from him. Amen. We're going to be
[24:12] turning to the word at this time. And uh
[24:15] let's sing together. Oh, how He loves
[24:17] you and me. Oh, how he loves you and me.
[24:20] He gave himself. What more could he do?
[24:24] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[24:33] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[24:41] He gave himself.
[24:45] What more could he do?
[24:50] Oh, how he loves you.
[24:54] Oh, how he loves me.
[24:58] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[25:07] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[25:15] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[25:23] He gave himself
[25:26] what
[25:28] could he do.
[25:31] Oh, how he loves you.
[25:35] Oh, how he loves me.
[25:39] Oh, how he loves you and me. Say it once
[25:45] again, saints.
[25:47] Oh, how he loves
[25:51] you and me.
[25:56] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[26:04] He gave himself
[26:07] what I want to hear you.
[26:12] Oh, how he loved you.
[26:17] Oh, how he loves me.
[26:21] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[26:29] Quiet
[26:31] in me.
[26:34] Let peaceful waterers flow
[26:38] [Music]
[26:41] to be still
[26:44] my soul. Oh,
[26:49] let me hear
[26:54] Jesus.
[26:59] Touch me, Lord.
[27:01] Quiet.
[27:04] That's your prayer this morning. Sing it
[27:06] to him. Oh, quiet.
[27:10] [Applause]
[27:12] Oh, and peace. Oh, I s
[27:17] [Music]
[27:19] to be still my soul
[27:27] and let me
[27:31] let me hear my Jesus call me.
[27:37] Touch me Lord.
[27:40] [Music]
[27:42] Just sing it to him now.
[27:46] Why
[27:52] are
[27:57] you to
[27:59] my soul?
[28:05] Let me
[28:08] be my Jesus.
[28:15] Touch me Lord in quiet.
[28:20] Let's just sing it without any
[28:21] instruments now. Just to him. Oh,
[28:29] let peaceful
[28:36] be still
[28:38] my soul.
[28:43] [Music]
[28:44] and let me
[28:49] hear my Jesus walking.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[28:56] Lord.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:05] Thank brother Rod.
[29:07] Wonderful to be in his presence this
[29:09] morning.
[29:11] Amen. It's good to be in the house of
[29:13] God.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; A lot of other places that we could be
[29:17] today, but we're here. We're here to
[29:20] worship him and
[29:23] here to receive and we're also here to
[29:25] contribute.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:34] We had a had a phone call from brother
[29:38] brother Ken Ordeal. He's been with
[29:41] brother Vin and they were together in uh
[29:45] Grenada
[29:46] where there's been such destruction
[29:48] which we are well aware of
[29:52] and they went down initially to see uh
[29:55] the homes of homes that don't exist
[29:58] anymore
[30:00] of about 15 believers homes turned out
[30:05] to be about 38.
[30:08] He's coming back uh with pictures. He
[30:11] said took pictures of some of the
[30:13] families just standing on the rubble of
[30:15] their homes. Nothing exists anymore.
[30:20] Some are under just some tarps, some
[30:24] pieces of tin, and when any wind comes,
[30:27] which they have had since the hurricanes
[30:31] and the wind has blown that away.
[30:34] So, but there it's not been an easy
[30:37] time. Also, there's two churches that
[30:39] are now non-existent.
[30:44] And so, uh, men of vision are desiring
[30:48] to,
[30:50] uh, build and put up some structures for
[30:53] them, for these homes, and, uh, for
[30:56] these churches. So, we'll know more
[30:58] about this this coming week.
[31:01] uh
[31:02] we are
[31:05] naturally burdened for them
[31:08] uh people in great need. So let's
[31:11] remember and pray for the brothers. It's
[31:13] not easy. There's a lot of hurdles that
[31:16] we are not a uh we're not privy to. We
[31:21] don't know all the details, but we uh we
[31:24] just pray that God will help the
[31:26] brothers and help us to do what we can.
[31:29] Uh this afternoon,
[31:31] we'd like to start the meeting just a
[31:33] wee bit early. And it's it's a difficult
[31:36] thing because I know some of the
[31:38] congregation here, if we start at 4:00,
[31:40] it's a little too early and they don't
[31:43] seem to have enough time between
[31:44] meetings. But we have so many that have
[31:47] come from far away from Seattle, Tacoma,
[31:50] and so and perhaps even further and they
[31:52] wish to be with us tonight at the
[31:55] communion table, a footwashing service
[31:58] tonight. We have baptism tonight as
[32:01] well. There's several are going to be
[32:03] baptized. I would like to say to those
[32:05] that are going to be baptized, if they
[32:07] will meet me, please at 4:00 in the
[32:10] office at 400 p.m. And we're going to
[32:13] start the service at 4:30. That just
[32:16] gives us a little bit of head start so
[32:18] that those that have driven so far,
[32:20] another half hour earlier, especially
[32:22] with them and their families and all, it
[32:24] will make it uh so much better. So, I
[32:27] think that'll be fine for everyone.
[32:30] And uh well the Lord gave us a gracious
[32:34] time Wednesday
[32:36] and uh as can be expected whenever
[32:39] whenever God you know comes and meets
[32:41] his people in in any special way you can
[32:45] be sure that Satan's going to go on the
[32:47] rampage.
[32:48] And he has certainly been doing that. He
[32:51] has been on the rampage ever since. Uh
[32:54] we don't fear him. We're not going to be
[32:58] disturbed about it. And uh and if you
[33:01] have experienced that, you should just
[33:02] say, "Well, praise God. We did stir his
[33:05] nest. He's not he's not sitting there uh
[33:09] taking things easy. He we stirred his
[33:12] nest. Got him angry." Now, I'll tell you
[33:15] what, we ought to have every service
[33:17] that gets him good and angry. Amen. We
[33:20] want to remember uh those that uh
[33:22] there's been all kinds of things take
[33:24] place that have just unbelievable. And
[33:28] uh we just want uh we want the people to
[33:31] know and those that are are our internet
[33:34] congregation as well that are listening
[33:36] and streaming today wherever they are
[33:38] some in different countries whatever
[33:40] more but we we want to be in the midst
[33:43] of the battle.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be at ease in Zion.
[33:48] Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:52] Praise the Lord. I'm just checking the
[33:55] congregation.
[33:57] Hallelujah.
[34:00] I would like to
[34:03] uh sing just before we turn to the word.
[34:06] We have a wonderful atmosphere just now,
[34:09] but I would like to sing we place you in
[34:13] the highest place. Wonder, brother Rod,
[34:14] if you can just take a microphone and
[34:17] and let's stand. We'll get ready to read
[34:19] the word.
[34:22] On Wednesday, I I spoke on that which
[34:26] was torn is healed. And I would like to
[34:31] continue on from there. I I You'll have
[34:34] to pray for me. I've got some slides. Uh
[34:38] forgot my computer at home. Came without
[34:41] the slides, so I sent someone else back
[34:43] to get it. And I want you to be able to
[34:46] read some of these things. So, I hope
[34:48] that that all gets together. That isn't
[34:51] what I was referring to when I was
[34:53] talking about all hell breaks loose and
[34:55] Satan. We have Sister Sister Marjorie
[34:58] Miles is is lying in my office right now
[35:01] having some kind of an attack. Uh it's
[35:04] just the devil.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Just the devil. He'd like to disturb the
[35:08] her and the service and others, but
[35:11] we're going to take authority over it in
[35:14] the name of Jesus Christ. So, let's just
[35:17] prepare ourselves for the word now.
[35:19] Brother Rod, we place you
[35:24] in the highest
[35:29] for you
[35:33] on a great high.
[35:36] Oh yes, Lord, we place you
[35:41] high above
[35:44] all.
[35:46] [Applause]
[35:47] [Music]
[35:49] All else
[35:53] have we come to you
[35:57] and worship
[36:00] at your glory.
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] Everyone once again please
[36:07] we place you
[36:12] in the highest place
[36:16] for you
[36:19] by great high.
[36:24] relationship
[36:28] far above
[36:31] all
[36:32] else.
[36:36] all else
[36:39] and we come to you
[36:43] and worship
[36:46] at your feet.
[36:53] Indeed, our Lord Jesus, we come and
[36:56] worship at your feet.
[36:58] such a sacred, holy, privileged place
[37:03] that we as poor, needy humans could come
[37:08] before the almighty God. And we could
[37:11] not come unless there was a sacrifice
[37:13] there and that sacrifice is hanging
[37:17] there for us. The blood has been shed.
[37:20] The price has been paid and the way has
[37:24] been made for every believer to come. We
[37:27] do not come with doubts and fears. We do
[37:30] not come with insecurity.
[37:33] We come Lord with assurance. For we have
[37:36] read in your word and we believe those
[37:39] words are true. That if we know that we
[37:42] are heard and you hear us, then we have
[37:45] the assurance. We have the we are
[37:48] certain that we will have the answer for
[37:51] those things which we ask. We ask for
[37:54] your presence.
[37:56] We ask for your presence that you will
[38:00] be amongst us mightily. We ask that you
[38:03] will be in attendance and that the
[38:05] angels of God which are encircling the
[38:09] believer's camp this morning that you
[38:12] will be Lord made known to the people
[38:15] through your word and through the
[38:17] preaching and through the mighty
[38:20] manifestation.
[38:22] for we need a God that comes down
[38:25] amongst us and heals the sick and
[38:27] delivers the bound. Touch our sister
[38:29] Marjorie Miles just now. Touch her we
[38:32] pray. Oh God, I pray you'll give wisdom,
[38:35] Father, to brothers and sisters that
[38:37] need divine wisdom at this time. They're
[38:40] facing decisions in the coming days and
[38:43] they need your wisdom. I pray that you
[38:44] will endure them now with a special gift
[38:47] of wisdom. Oh God,
[38:50] others Lord, how the enemy's come to
[38:52] torment them. I pray that you'll bind
[38:55] that tormentor and send him far from
[38:58] their place, Lord cast him far from the
[39:02] people. And may your sheep this morning
[39:06] within the fold. May they sense that not
[39:10] only your presence and nearness of the
[39:12] great shepherd, but then we can rest and
[39:14] be at peace.
[39:17] Lord, I ask that you will grace this day
[39:20] with the divine nearness of of our Lord
[39:24] Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. And as
[39:27] we come to the communion table tonight,
[39:29] Lord, and and the baptisms, I pray that
[39:32] you will just mightily, mightily
[39:35] presence yourself, manifest yourself, do
[39:38] all manner of things that will get glory
[39:41] to your name. And now anoint the people
[39:43] to hear. Anoint myself to speak. Anoint
[39:47] and bless all that are connected with us
[39:49] whether by telephone or through the
[39:51] internet. And all that may ever hear
[39:54] this service in the name of Jesus
[39:56] Christ. Amen.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[40:02] If you'll take your Bible, we're going
[40:03] to read a few verses from Ephesians
[40:07] which we read on Wednesday. Ephesians
[40:10] the 2 chapter and then I'm going to read
[40:14] from Hosea, the prophet Hosea,
[40:18] which is the book immediately following
[40:21] Daniel.
[40:24] But we'll read in Ephesians first
[40:31] starting with verse one.
[40:35] And you hath he quickened, who were dead
[40:39] in trespasses and sins, wherein in time
[40:42] past ye walked according to the course
[40:45] of this world, according to the prince
[40:49] of the power of the air, the spirit that
[40:52] now workketh in the children of
[40:54] disobedience,
[40:56] among whom also we all had our
[40:59] conversation in times past, in the lusts
[41:02] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[41:06] the flesh and of the mind, and where by
[41:09] nature the children of wrath, even as
[41:12] others. Verse 12, that at that time ye
[41:17] were without Christ, being aliens from
[41:20] the commonwealth of Israel, and
[41:23] strangers from the covenants of promise,
[41:26] having no hope, and without God in the
[41:29] world. And then in Hosea I want to read
[41:34] uh from chapter 6
[41:40] verses 1 2 and 3.
[41:44] Come and let us return unto the Lord for
[41:48] he hath torn and he will heal us. He
[41:52] hath smitten and he will bind us up.
[41:56] After two days will he revive us. In the
[42:01] third day he will raise us up and we
[42:04] shall live in his sight. Then shall we
[42:07] know if we follow on to know the Lord.
[42:10] His going forth is prepared as the
[42:12] morning and he shall come unto us as the
[42:16] rain as the latter and former reign unto
[42:20] the earth.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; May God bless his word to our hearts.
[42:24] You may have your seats.
[42:31] Now, I'd like you to be just as
[42:32] attentive as possible and as still as
[42:36] possible
[42:38] and as little movement as possible
[42:42] because uh we need to pray for one
[42:45] another. You need to pray for me and I
[42:47] and pray for yourself also. I have so
[42:50] much that I I feel I need to say and
[42:54] it's sometimes it's a challenge to get
[42:57] the people just up and moving in the
[43:00] same channel. So I wish to try to uh
[43:04] accomplish that by God's help as quickly
[43:07] as possible. the scripture which we've
[43:10] now just read in Hosea.
[43:15] Uh this is a very prophetic scripture.
[43:20] Brother Brandham used this scripture as
[43:23] his text in recognizing your day and his
[43:26] its message. recognizing your day and
[43:30] its message, that day's message.
[43:33] Uh
[43:35] there is a there is a continuity
[43:40] between Hosea and even in the prophet's
[43:44] ministry there is a continuity of
[43:46] scripture.
[43:48] Uh brother Brandham calls it uh
[43:52] compound. We all have used that
[43:54] terminology
[43:56] and anyone who has studied or read the
[43:59] Bible.
[44:01] Many ministers, they will use that uh
[44:05] phrase that the Bible has a compound
[44:07] meaning. I'm going to give you some
[44:09] examples of that in just a little while.
[44:12] Uh, brother Brandham uses the term it
[44:16] goes in cycles because what happens is
[44:20] the same conditions will come about at a
[44:24] future time and then we'll find that
[44:27] scripture that has been spoken for an
[44:29] event of maybe two or 3,000 years ago.
[44:32] That scripture will come into effect
[44:34] again. Now the scriptur is always
[44:37] effective but the scripture will be
[44:41] spoken and dealt with uh in a in a at a
[44:45] certain specific time to meet a certain
[44:48] conditions which are at that time. And
[44:51] then when they come again one of
[44:53] outstanding one is out of Egypt have I
[44:55] called my son. And the direct reference
[44:58] was God calling his people out of Egypt.
[45:02] But it had a greater reference to
[45:05] calling Christ. Christ coming out of
[45:07] Egypt after Jesus was born and Joseph
[45:12] and Mary had to flee into Egypt. And
[45:14] then after Herod had died, they came
[45:17] back that it might be fulfilled, out of
[45:20] Egypt have I called my son. But that
[45:22] scripture had already been spoken
[45:25] concerning Israel coming out of Egypt.
[45:27] But it had a greater meaning and a more
[45:29] fuller meaning when Jesus was brought
[45:32] out of Egypt. And I can say that you
[45:34] were brought out of Egypt
[45:36] &gt;&gt; that you might manifest the son
[45:39] &gt;&gt; of God revealed in this time. And so he
[45:43] called you out of Egypt. And now it has
[45:45] even a fuller meaning uh when we come to
[45:48] that aspect of it. Now
[45:52] uh
[45:54] Hosea begins here by saying
[45:59] come let us return unto the Lord for he
[46:04] hath torn
[46:07] and he will heal us and he hath smitten
[46:11] &gt;&gt; and he will bind us up.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; This is an aspect of God that very few
[46:17] people understand.
[46:20] uh even we we hear a question well why
[46:23] is there sin and why did God you know
[46:25] allow sin and where did iniquity come
[46:28] from and all these kind of questions.
[46:31] one of the one of the foundation
[46:35] uh ingredients that a believer must have
[46:40] and that is God is sovereign
[46:44] and God can do things and will do things
[46:48] that you and I have no business
[46:50] questioning
[46:52] &gt;&gt; and we say well are we just that
[46:53] gullible in the in in the case of God I
[46:56] will say yes that we just believe that
[46:59] God is sovereign He does what he wishes
[47:02] to do. And he his mind and the scope of
[47:06] eternal God is so far beyond us little
[47:10] puny insignificant creatures creeping
[47:13] here upon the earth that we don't even
[47:15] hardly have a a scarce breath of time
[47:18] within the scope of time and we're gone.
[47:21] And God is God. He's always He's always
[47:25] been. And if he desires to allow
[47:28] something, so be it.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; So be it. Whatever he desires, so be it.
[47:35] And we have to learn that the
[47:37] sovereignty of God,
[47:39] Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people don't even like to
[47:46] quote that scripture. And the scripture
[47:49] also tells us, "For this cause I raised
[47:52] thee up," speaking of Pharaoh. And the
[47:55] Bible says that God hardened his heart.
[47:58] Well, a lot of people don't understand
[47:59] that and they don't even like to read
[48:01] that scripture because they don't
[48:02] understand it. Well, the f the first and
[48:05] most basic thing is that you just say
[48:07] that whatever God did that is perfect.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Whatever he did is perfect.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; I can tell you how he hardens a person's
[48:16] heart is he presents him with the
[48:19] presents him with his word first. God
[48:23] never sent uh you know some spirit there
[48:25] to harden his heart. God presented him
[48:28] with the word and he hardened his heart.
[48:31] So God hardened his heart.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Because God presented him with the
[48:35] gospel.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; You see before you can reject, you have
[48:38] to be presented with something. And so
[48:40] God presents the people, God presented
[48:43] this generation with his word through a
[48:45] prophet, a spoken word through a
[48:47] prophet. God God presented Israel with
[48:51] the living word in perfection in Jesus
[48:55] Christ and they rejected it. But they
[48:57] couldn't reject it till it was presented
[48:59] to them. And so God allowed their heart
[49:02] to be hardened.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; God allowed sin in the world, believe it
[49:08] or not, so he could become more great.
[49:10] Greater.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Amen.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; And so he hath torn to rend or to tear
[49:19] in pieces. And we went into that a wee
[49:22] bit on Wednesday night. We've become a
[49:26] callous generation. We've heard so much
[49:29] and we've been so connected to uh a
[49:33] world by the media uh of tragedy and we
[49:38] hear it every day from childhood. We
[49:41] hear it. Uh we hear of all the
[49:44] catastrophic things and people being
[49:46] slain and people being beheaded and uh
[49:50] uh all the terrorism that's taking place
[49:53] and the tragedy that's taking place and
[49:55] pretty soon it runs off our back. It's
[49:58] just some more news in the day. It's the
[50:00] same kind of thing happening. Same
[50:02] tragedies just different people's names
[50:07] &gt;&gt; and we become callous to it. It's
[50:09] unfortunate we become callous to it and
[50:11] then uh there's all kinds of uh all
[50:14] kinds of support things that are given
[50:17] so that even when uh uh a a tearing
[50:22] experiences which taken which take place
[50:24] and I spoke on Wednesday I don't want to
[50:26] take any time this morning but on uh the
[50:29] wars how wars have tore away some of our
[50:34] finest young men and young women out
[50:36] from the arms of their loved ones and
[50:40] and fathers from their young children
[50:42] and babies and and from their young
[50:45] wives and have taken them and they're
[50:47] laying in some foreign soil and some of
[50:49] them have never been found. Those are
[50:52] those are horrific friends. That that is
[50:54] something that God never designed that
[50:58] that has been allowed but God has never
[51:00] designed it. It's absolutely horrific.
[51:03] homes are absolutely shattered and torn
[51:06] and fathers and mothers from children uh
[51:10] all kinds of habits of life be it drug
[51:12] or be it uh uh a life of crime or be it
[51:16] alcohol or be it whatever it is it's
[51:18] it's a Satan's world
[51:21] &gt;&gt; it's a Satan's Eden and it's just
[51:24] rending and tearing lives and homes
[51:27] until people uh don't only become
[51:30] callous to it but they find that they
[51:32] have to kind of protect themselves and
[51:34] they're afraid to give themselves out,
[51:36] afraid to uh, you know, to expose
[51:39] themselves or make themselves vulnerable
[51:41] because they feel that they have to
[51:43] almost protect themselves. All kinds of
[51:45] complexes come in, opens the door for
[51:48] the enemy, for Satan to put all kinds of
[51:50] complexes and fear upon the people. Uh,
[51:54] and and that is true, is it not?
[51:56] &gt;&gt; That's the world that we're living in.
[51:58] But it's the devil's world. And I'm
[52:00] telling you, we're here today on our way
[52:03] to another world that will know none of
[52:04] those things.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; We talk about all these things that are
[52:09] severed. I'm going to going to speak
[52:11] very personally just for a moment.
[52:15] I can my my mind
[52:19] barely can cope with the thought of
[52:22] certain separations in life.
[52:25] I don't like to think I like to think
[52:27] about the rapture. I like to think about
[52:29] going home. I don't like to think about
[52:31] going by the way of the grave, but it is
[52:33] a reality.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; It's a reality that a lot of people
[52:36] don't want to face. Neither do I want to
[52:38] face it. I have difficulty talking about
[52:41] to my wife in the event that I go, "This
[52:44] needs to happen. That needs to happen."
[52:46] I don't like to think about that. And I
[52:48] I I hate to think about her being left
[52:51] without me. Uh I don't want to be
[52:53] selfish, but I I think that I would have
[52:55] a more difficult time perhaps being
[52:57] without her.
[52:59] These are kind of separations that we we
[53:02] can't hardly cope with. But one my mind
[53:05] one that my mind short circuits on.
[53:09] I want you to listen close
[53:11] is to pass from this life and be
[53:14] separated from God.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; My mind short circuits.
[53:21] I can't grasp.
[53:24] I could grasp falling into a 6-ft hole
[53:28] and if that was the end of it, that
[53:30] would be fine. But to know that's not
[53:32] the end of it.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; That is not the end of it for you. And
[53:37] it's not the end of it for me. It's just
[53:39] the beginning of a whole another phase.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; And that jars me into reality every day.
[53:47] I want to live as he wants me to live. I
[53:51] want to live pleasing. I want to be able
[53:53] to come before him, not in a series of
[53:56] good works, but I want to be able to
[53:58] come before him and say, "Father, in
[54:00] life, I sought to have the smile of your
[54:03] approval. And I trust I can come into
[54:06] your presence now through the shed blood
[54:08] of your son, and I want to know that I
[54:11] have done what I should do in this
[54:14] life." Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I cannot think and every person here
[54:18] needs to think seriously and live with
[54:20] that before them that we cannot afford
[54:25] to be separated from him.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that's in the heart of every
[54:30] believer.
[54:32] That is one separation you cannot
[54:35] afford.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:37] I would recommend every man woman live
[54:40] as fervently live for God and forget
[54:45] this world and forget all of its
[54:48] attractions, its enchantments, its
[54:51] snares to snare a person whether it be
[54:56] uh the cares of life or whether it be
[54:58] the advancement in this world or we want
[55:01] to live here for eternity and whatever
[55:05] doors God opens s for you. Whatever
[55:07] positions you are called on to take, let
[55:10] it be a life that you will live in this
[55:12] life for eternity to have an effect on
[55:16] someone to influence someone or whatever
[55:19] it might be. If God blesses you, that
[55:21] you might use it for the kingdom of God
[55:23] in every which way. Hallelujah. If God
[55:26] gives you a car, use it for God. Gives
[55:28] you a home, use it for the kingdom of
[55:30] God. gives you a better job or whatever
[55:32] it gives you gives you a a super
[55:34] intelligence, use it for the kingdom of
[55:36] God, whatever it might be.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; There was a horrific moment of
[55:46] separation
[55:48] in the garden. Yes.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us Paul speaking to
[55:54] Timothy, for Adam was first formed, then
[55:58] Eve,
[55:59] and Adam was not deceived, but the woman
[56:02] being deceived was in the transgression.
[56:05] Adam typing Christ.
[56:08] And as I just refer back to Wednesday,
[56:12] for those of you that were here, I'm
[56:14] saying it for those that were not here.
[56:19] Satan through the serpent succeeded by
[56:22] perverting just one word
[56:25] and thus tore Eve away from the headship
[56:31] of Adam.
[56:33] And Adam typing Christ
[56:36] was tore from his fellowship, from his
[56:39] dominion, from his position that God had
[56:42] given him was tore from that fellowship
[56:45] and that position because he he he loved
[56:48] her. He loves his wife and he went in
[56:51] and took her quickly, the prophet said
[56:54] to himself.
[56:55] I want to read this most marvelous. It
[56:59] really is marvelous descriptive
[57:02] language.
[57:03] It is almost as though
[57:07] it's almost as though brother Brandham
[57:08] is actually looking into Eden
[57:12] and seeing and I wouldn't be surprised
[57:14] he was
[57:16] &gt;&gt; prophet looks into the past looks into
[57:18] the future
[57:20] but you won't find this kind of
[57:22] description
[57:24] said I see speaking of Adam I see his so
[57:28] shoulders stooping
[57:30] around his big body here Comes an old
[57:34] bloody sheep skin
[57:37] running down those big banny legs with
[57:40] blood.
[57:42] Tears is dripping off his cheeks,
[57:45] patting on the top of Eve's head
[57:48] as she leans over on his bosom. And
[57:53] little Eve crying. Another place he says
[57:55] they can cry now. They're mortals now.
[58:03] And she leans over on his bosom and
[58:05] little Eve crying and tears patting down
[58:08] as it mixes with blood running down her
[58:11] bosom. What's the matter? Something's
[58:15] happened.
[58:17] They can cry now.
[58:19] They're mortal now. They're dying now.
[58:24] There you are. I can see God say,
[58:26] "Depart out of my presence.
[58:30] couldn't stand it. I can see Adam start
[58:34] walking away. And as he did, I can hear
[58:36] something going,
[58:38] slapping
[58:40] skins against his legs, old bloody sheep
[58:43] skin flopping against his leg as he's
[58:45] going out. And oh, I can see God who
[58:48] covers space and time, who has no
[58:51] beginning and no ending. I can see it
[58:53] all bottled up,
[58:56] funneled down, coming down like this.
[59:00] for one fourlettered word l o v e.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; He couldn't see his children depart from
[59:08] him. Now why he had made the covenant
[59:12] conditional with Adam, but now he makes
[59:15] an unconditional and said, I will put
[59:18] enmity between the woman's seed and he
[59:22] would bruise the serpent's head and so
[59:25] forth, promising a savior. God did not
[59:29] say, "Is that all right with you, Adam?"
[59:31] God said, "I am doing that.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; I am going to put enmity between the
[59:36] woman and the serpent." And between the
[59:38] serpent's seed and her seed, and her
[59:42] seed, the only seed a woman received
[59:44] outside of a man was Jesus Christ was
[59:47] the seed of God. And the Holy Ghost
[59:50] shall overshadow thee, Mary. and thou
[59:52] shalt conceive and bring forth a son,
[59:55] and shall call his name Jesus, for he
[59:58] shall save his people from their sins.
[1:00:01] Unconditional covenant. How I thank God
[1:00:04] for that covenant.
[1:00:08] And since this
[1:00:11] catastrophic moment in history
[1:00:15] when man lost his inheritance and he
[1:00:18] lost his lost his life and he lost his
[1:00:20] inheritance in that life,
[1:00:23] there's always been a need in man
[1:00:27] to return or to be united because he was
[1:00:30] separated. He was severed. And I believe
[1:00:32] that across the entire spectrum of the
[1:00:36] human uh human existence there's a
[1:00:39] desire there's a desire there's a need
[1:00:42] within the human psyche to be connected
[1:00:45] to be wanted to be a part that's why uh
[1:00:50] we want to be part of a family we want
[1:00:53] to be part of some kind of a community
[1:00:55] or association of people we want to be
[1:00:58] part of of another person's life. We we
[1:01:03] want and and marriage is the most sacred
[1:01:05] and wonderful thing because you have a
[1:01:07] partner. You have someone that you love,
[1:01:10] someone that you can uh relate to and
[1:01:13] associate with uh and and and have your
[1:01:18] most intimate uh conversations with or a
[1:01:23] friend.
[1:01:25] And that is why there's all kinds of
[1:01:29] groups that and even within a nation
[1:01:31] they seek to have somebody they can
[1:01:33] unify behind
[1:01:36] and nations struggle with that.
[1:01:40] Ukraine goes to the polls I think
[1:01:43] tomorrow.
[1:01:44] United States will have a vote in
[1:01:46] another few days this week. And it's
[1:01:49] troubling when they say it's a nation
[1:01:53] divided.
[1:01:55] They wonder if they will have
[1:01:58] uh even a president that is can be one
[1:02:04] for the majority of the people.
[1:02:08] They they they need men that they can
[1:02:11] rally around. Nations look for that.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And they unite
[1:02:16] the United Nations. They unite so they
[1:02:19] can achieve something that they can't do
[1:02:21] individually, but they trust they can do
[1:02:23] it together. we will have more strength
[1:02:26] together. Nations unite that they might
[1:02:29] have economic power, economic benefits
[1:02:31] and so they have NAFTA and they have the
[1:02:34] European Union or whatever more and
[1:02:36] other nations which are ostracized or
[1:02:39] left out such as Turkey is right now.
[1:02:41] They want to get in. Please let us in.
[1:02:44] Open the door.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; So, well, you have to do all of these
[1:02:47] things and after you do all these
[1:02:48] things, we'll check it out and see if
[1:02:50] we'll let you in. And and nations don't
[1:02:52] want to be left out. People don't want
[1:02:53] to be left out. We don't want to be
[1:02:55] excluded. We don't want to be
[1:02:56] ostracized.
[1:02:58] We don't want to be rejected and put
[1:03:01] out. That's bad enough in life. But as I
[1:03:05] said, one place we cannot afford to be
[1:03:08] separated from is from the presence of
[1:03:10] God and from a holy God and from eternal
[1:03:13] life.
[1:03:17] The key to understanding oneness,
[1:03:20] the key to understanding true oneness
[1:03:23] and unity is to understand what it was
[1:03:27] first in the mind of God.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Let's pray that we understand this now.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We need to go back to the beginning. And
[1:03:39] in the beginning,
[1:03:41] God said, "Let us make man in our image
[1:03:46] and in our likeness."
[1:03:49] And for trinitarians
[1:03:51] who may be listening
[1:03:54] or who are struggling with this says,
[1:03:57] "Let us so they have a plurality of
[1:04:00] God." But I always agree say that's
[1:04:03] exactly right. And did God did he did he
[1:04:07] do what he said he was going to do? Let
[1:04:09] us make man in our image and after our
[1:04:11] plural likeness. And so he made man in
[1:04:14] his image. And I always ask trinitarians
[1:04:16] when God was done his work, how many
[1:04:18] people did he have?
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Was it his image? Absolutely. Did he
[1:04:26] only make something part of his image?
[1:04:28] No. He made one in his image. And when
[1:04:31] he was done, he had a man. But in the
[1:04:34] man was qualities. In the man was
[1:04:36] characteristics. In the man he had
[1:04:39] masculine and feminist because God
[1:04:42] separated out from him the feminist part
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; and put it in a woman called Eve.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; But after the creation was done and
[1:04:51] that's why brother Brandon calls it a
[1:04:53] byproduct.
[1:04:54] Don't think that he made less of you
[1:04:56] ladies. Not at all. But after the
[1:04:58] creation was finished, then he took from
[1:05:02] Adam a rib, a part of his body, which
[1:05:05] would be a type because Adam was also a
[1:05:07] type of Christ. He was the first Adam.
[1:05:09] Jesus was the second Adam. And he takes
[1:05:12] a part of his body.
[1:05:15] And now it's after the creation is done
[1:05:18] and makes him a wife.
[1:05:22] But
[1:05:23] he points out
[1:05:26] and he takes and separates from the
[1:05:27] spirit.
[1:05:29] Now the spirit that spirit given by God
[1:05:33] not his spirit was not formed out of the
[1:05:36] earth. You understand?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; His spirit was not formed out of the
[1:05:40] earth. His spirit was not formed out of
[1:05:42] the creation. He was breathed in by the
[1:05:44] nostrils of God into his nostrils by the
[1:05:48] breath of God. And he became a living
[1:05:51] soul
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; that came from God.
[1:05:56] And part of that the attributes
[1:06:00] of that spirit, the feminist attributes,
[1:06:02] and he separated the masculine from the
[1:06:04] feminist and put it into the woman.
[1:06:08] And so in spirit they're one because the
[1:06:12] spirit could never be divided. And that
[1:06:14] is why in the marriage union the two are
[1:06:16] made one
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; by natural birth
[1:06:24] we have come it is like a byproduct.
[1:06:28] This flesh
[1:06:30] will never even though we may be here in
[1:06:32] the image of God but this flesh will
[1:06:35] never become godlike. Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; In that sense, this flesh is weak.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; This flesh is perishing.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; This flesh will turn to dust. Do you
[1:06:46] understand that? You believe that? This
[1:06:48] flesh will not take on a god likeness in
[1:06:51] that sense of the word. But that is why
[1:06:54] it is absolutely imperative
[1:06:57] and a believer has filled becomes filled
[1:07:01] with that holy spirit of promise. The
[1:07:04] Holy Spirit from God is not something
[1:07:06] that's separated from God. It is God.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And so the flesh is a byproduct
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; because we are the bride of Christ. It's
[1:07:17] like a byproduct.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That is why Jesus is the only one who
[1:07:21] could say my flesh is meat indeed and my
[1:07:24] spirit, my blood is drink indeed rather.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; And that is why he said to the
[1:07:29] disciples, do not go and minister. Do
[1:07:31] not go and preach. Not only because they
[1:07:33] were not empowered, but because they did
[1:07:36] not have God in them yet. Go and carry
[1:07:39] in the in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:07:41] you be endued with with power from on
[1:07:43] high. And when the Holy Spirit came,
[1:07:46] that was not a byproduct.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; That was God himself.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; And by that act, they were made one with
[1:07:56] God.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; And that is the unity which was in the
[1:08:00] beginning.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:02] In spirit they were one.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; In flesh they were two. She came after
[1:08:08] the creation. And we have come by a
[1:08:11] birth by a sexual birth. By a natural
[1:08:15] birth. And by the birth of a woman we
[1:08:18] die. But by the birth of the man Jesus
[1:08:22] Christ we live.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:28] In the message on one she said Eve was
[1:08:30] united with Adam.
[1:08:33] She became part of him.
[1:08:36] God created Genesis 1:27.
[1:08:40] Male and female created he them plural.
[1:08:44] Now the man was both male and female
[1:08:48] when it came to being in the spirit. The
[1:08:51] feminist and the masculine God.
[1:08:55] The feminist attributes come from God.
[1:08:59] And so he says, "Then God took from his
[1:09:02] side a rib." And did you notice the body
[1:09:05] part was a byproduct, but not the
[1:09:07] spirit?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; The spirit is not a byproduct. This
[1:09:11] flesh is a perishing flesh. This flesh
[1:09:14] is a problem to every sincere believer.
[1:09:17] It's a big problem. It's a negative is
[1:09:20] it as it were. And yet God has ordained
[1:09:22] that this is the form we come in. But
[1:09:25] there is a higher power and it's called
[1:09:27] the Holy Ghost. It's called the Holy
[1:09:29] Spirit. And when that spirit comes into
[1:09:32] this weakened flesh, it makes us sons
[1:09:35] and daughters of God. Not by the flesh,
[1:09:37] but by the spirit. We're made sons and
[1:09:40] daughters of God. We came as as it were
[1:09:43] by a secondary type of birth. And that's
[1:09:46] why ye must be born again
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; and born by the Holy Spirit. And when
[1:09:54] we're born by the spirit, we take on a
[1:09:58] oneness with God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; And so the body part of the woman was a
[1:10:04] byproduct after the creation had been
[1:10:08] finished. And God took from the sight of
[1:10:11] Adam a rib made a woman. Not but not the
[1:10:15] spirit. The spirit was a part of Adam.
[1:10:19] It was a part of him.
[1:10:22] You might say, well, the rib was a part
[1:10:23] of, but it was after the creation. The
[1:10:26] rib came and and it was after God had
[1:10:30] made man in his image.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:10:34] the flesh, this flesh body born by a
[1:10:39] natural birth cannot be united with God.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to understand dust to
[1:10:48] dust,
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; ashes to ashes. We we are going to
[1:10:53] return to dust unless we have in the in
[1:10:57] the body change. God the creator is
[1:11:02] going to uh by his his power by his
[1:11:05] creative power a sweep go over the
[1:11:08] believers.
[1:11:10] The elect of God will be changed. As
[1:11:12] apostle Paul said, "We shall not all
[1:11:14] sleep, but we shall all be changed in a
[1:11:17] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and
[1:11:20] this body will be changed from mortal to
[1:11:24] immortality." And that is a supernatural
[1:11:27] thing. It's only going to happen once in
[1:11:29] history.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; It's only going to happen once from the
[1:11:32] creation. God before the before before
[1:11:35] all destruction takes place, he's going
[1:11:38] to take a people as a testimony against
[1:11:41] death.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; That the last enemy to be destroyed is
[1:11:45] death. And God is going to take a whole
[1:11:47] people off the earth.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; In a change of the body as a as a last
[1:11:55] testimony to this earth.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And by that they bypass death. But
[1:12:02] outside of that, it's ashes to ashes,
[1:12:05] dust to dust, and ashes to ashes. This
[1:12:08] body will only be a teaspoon of ashes
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; in the end.
[1:12:14] When wife and I were in Turkey, we saw
[1:12:15] these great stone
[1:12:18] uh they would call them caskets, but
[1:12:21] they're not. But they're used the same.
[1:12:25] And the very Greek word for them I
[1:12:27] mentioned here in a little testimony I
[1:12:28] gave is a flesh eater is what it means.
[1:12:33] And the chemicals within the stone that
[1:12:37] these are carved out of when the body is
[1:12:39] put in there. We were told that in a few
[1:12:42] days the body and this man didn't know
[1:12:45] what we believe but he said in a few
[1:12:46] days it's only some ashes in there. Just
[1:12:50] some ashes. That's all that's left. the
[1:12:52] chemistry within the flesheater. Just to
[1:12:55] think, you know, people they've had such
[1:12:57] stature and respect and they've had such
[1:13:00] accomplishments in life and some have
[1:13:02] become great businessmen and some have
[1:13:04] become artists and poets and everything
[1:13:06] and in a moment it's gone
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; and the record of it is gone.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe they wrote books and whatever
[1:13:12] more, but it's gone. The image is gone.
[1:13:15] I thought how tragic that really is that
[1:13:17] it that that the world loses that. We
[1:13:21] can think of the greats all down through
[1:13:23] history and read about them and my what
[1:13:26] marvelous people uh that have have
[1:13:28] walked across the face of the earth and
[1:13:30] in a moment they're they're just
[1:13:31] vanished. They're just teaspoon of
[1:13:33] ashes.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's all that's left.
[1:13:38] Those ashes aren't God. But the spirit
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; that's in the believer is not a
[1:13:44] byproduct. It is the very thing that
[1:13:47] causes you to be one and united with
[1:13:50] God. The spirit that's in the believer
[1:13:52] is God.
[1:14:04] The spirit indeed is willing, but the
[1:14:06] flesh is weak. All flesh is as grass.
[1:14:10] John 3:6.
[1:14:12] That which is born of the flesh is
[1:14:14] flesh. That which is born of the spirit
[1:14:16] is spirit. In first Peter 1 and 24, all
[1:14:20] flesh is as grass, and all the glory of
[1:14:23] man as the flower of grass. In Genesis,
[1:14:26] when God spoke, in the sweat of thy face
[1:14:29] shalt thou eat bread till thou return
[1:14:31] unto the ground. For out of the ground
[1:14:34] thou was taken, for dust thou art, and
[1:14:37] unto dust shalt thou return.
[1:14:43] And ever since that sentence was
[1:14:45] pronounced,
[1:14:47] there's just that unquenchable thirst
[1:14:50] within man
[1:14:53] to want to be
[1:14:57] connected, wants to be part
[1:15:05] Unity.
[1:15:08] Unity is the state of being united
[1:15:12] physically,
[1:15:16] socially,
[1:15:18] morally,
[1:15:21] and spiritually.
[1:15:23] That's unity.
[1:15:27] To unite
[1:15:29] is to join together so as to form a
[1:15:32] whole.
[1:15:35] That's to unite.
[1:15:39] But union
[1:15:42] is the act of uniting.
[1:15:46] I want you to get that very very
[1:15:47] carefully. Those of you that have ever
[1:15:50] done any, you know, plumbing or that
[1:15:53] kind of work, you have two of the same
[1:15:57] thing, two lengths of pipe, but you need
[1:16:00] something to connect them together,
[1:16:03] to make them one. And the only way they
[1:16:05] can be one is with a union.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; So, you have to have a union. You have
[1:16:11] to have an agent in order for the unity
[1:16:15] to happen.
[1:16:17] God used his prophets
[1:16:21] as agents.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; They were the union sir
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; between a wayward civilization
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; and generation and a holy God.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Whether you want to accept that or not,
[1:16:35] that is the truth.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; And that is why God would send and Hosea
[1:16:40] was one of them. Come let us return unto
[1:16:44] the Lord.
[1:16:47] Now, unless God had had an agent to say
[1:16:51] that, not just to speak it, but he was
[1:16:55] the rallying point.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; He was the voice. And not only the
[1:17:00] voice, but he was the vessel through
[1:17:02] which God was issuing his voice and his
[1:17:06] thoughts.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; About them.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; And so often they were slain. And Jesus
[1:17:13] said the prophets were killed. Why were
[1:17:16] they killed? Because when God spoke his
[1:17:18] thoughts concerning the conditions of
[1:17:21] the people, they hated the man. Not
[1:17:24] because of his because of his uh uh
[1:17:27] physical features, but they hated him
[1:17:30] for what he was saying about them. But
[1:17:33] it wasn't him. It was God that was
[1:17:35] saved.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; I wonder what we would do this morning.
[1:17:46] I don't think I'm capable
[1:17:49] to perhaps say it just the way God would
[1:17:51] have it said. But if God had a vessel
[1:17:53] that just came and and uncovered by
[1:17:56] discernment by uncovered by the word
[1:17:59] where we all were living and our
[1:18:02] weaknesses and our frailties and so on
[1:18:05] so forth and just nailed it down,
[1:18:08] uh he'd either have to be our best
[1:18:10] friend or he'd be our worst enemy.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; We'd either have to say that is right.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I confess it. That is true. Amen.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; You've uncovered my my deepest personal
[1:18:23] innermost being. You've uncovered it and
[1:18:26] there's no place to hide. I repent. I I
[1:18:30] I I I agree. I What must I do?
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; And they were pricricked in their heart
[1:18:37] and said to Peter and the rest of the
[1:18:39] brethren, "What must we do to be saved?"
[1:18:42] Amen.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And Peter said,"Repent
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and be baptized, every one of you, in
[1:18:48] the name of Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
[1:18:50] receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In
[1:18:52] other words, repent and you shall be
[1:18:55] brought into union with God.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; You shall be made one.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; But there was a process and God had his
[1:19:04] agent. Now, Brother Brand says the agent
[1:19:07] is the Holy Spirit. That's exactly true.
[1:19:09] But the Holy Spirit has to have a vessel
[1:19:12] that he can move through. And there has
[1:19:15] been no vessel like it since the time of
[1:19:18] Christ that we've had in this day in the
[1:19:22] prophet of God in this generation.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And so there must be this act. And the
[1:19:31] word that kept coming to my mind is one
[1:19:33] that's not used over the pulpit very
[1:19:34] much, but I want you to listen to it
[1:19:36] closely.
[1:19:38] And those of you that are
[1:19:41] have been have trades and are and maybe
[1:19:43] even those of you that just go down to
[1:19:45] Home Depot and get something, there's
[1:19:47] something that's called a catalyst.
[1:19:50] And you can get a certain kind of a
[1:19:52] glue,
[1:19:54] a certain kind of a cement. And the very
[1:19:57] high grades of of those cements which
[1:20:00] which fuse and merge together and will
[1:20:02] not separate are most commonly
[1:20:06] activated by a catalyst.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; And you'll get a little tube that'll be
[1:20:11] a catalyst.
[1:20:12] And I was very very uh curious and
[1:20:16] interested to find out that what a
[1:20:18] catalyst does. It says that the catalyst
[1:20:21] remains stable. It does not change. But
[1:20:25] the catalyst has a certain qualities,
[1:20:28] certain properties that accelerates the
[1:20:31] merging and the union of the other and
[1:20:34] makes it one.
[1:20:37] And I thought, isn't that marvelous? We
[1:20:39] had to have a catalyst. We had to have
[1:20:42] somebody who could speak and accelerate
[1:20:45] within us the desire to be made one with
[1:20:48] God.
[1:20:50] Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And even when that catalyst, that agent
[1:20:53] would say, "You have sinned. You are
[1:20:56] wayward. You're lukewarm.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Leodya, Leodya, how often I would have
[1:21:02] gathered you as a hen gathers her
[1:21:04] chicks." Which he did say, and that's
[1:21:06] being repeated now. Jesus said that. But
[1:21:08] the son of man being revealed has a
[1:21:11] mouthpiece saying the same thing once
[1:21:13] again to a weward generation. And oh,
[1:21:17] how weward we are. I'm not negative
[1:21:20] people. I'm a very positive person. But
[1:21:22] I tell you before God, if we could see
[1:21:25] things in the balance that they are, you
[1:21:27] would say, as I have said, even today,
[1:21:29] we're walking in the midst of an insane
[1:21:31] asylum.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; This is an insane society. And things
[1:21:36] that are taking place that Satan would
[1:21:38] impose upon you as the norm is not
[1:21:41] normal whatsoever. It is total insanity.
[1:21:45] Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; The attitude
[1:21:49] and uh what takes place. I don't want to
[1:21:51] even try to describe it. I do not have
[1:21:53] the words. But it is an insanity.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; The way people dress is an insanity.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; The way people appear, the way people
[1:22:01] mutilate their bodies is an insanity.
[1:22:04] The way people mark themselves up, the
[1:22:06] way people their attitude towards one
[1:22:08] another is an insanity.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said he'd be walking the
[1:22:13] streets. And I tell you, we're there.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; We've arrived.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; In case you don't think that, you need
[1:22:23] to get near to the presence of God on
[1:22:27] your knees or in some quiet place. And
[1:22:30] you'll soon agree. It's an insane
[1:22:34] generation that we're in.
[1:22:38] Every once in a while, we speak about
[1:22:41] you young families.
[1:22:43] My wife and I, we wonder if we were
[1:22:45] young, would we even want to have
[1:22:47] children?
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; The most blessed thing that you can
[1:22:51] have, would we want to have children? I
[1:22:54] tell you what, I would only want to have
[1:22:56] them knowing that my feet were well
[1:22:58] anchored into the promises of God in
[1:23:01] this generation. Outside of that, there
[1:23:04] isn't any hope. Outside of that, there
[1:23:06] isn't any way to keep them and hold
[1:23:08] them. And I tell you, my brother, my
[1:23:10] sister, in the event that you think that
[1:23:12] you've lost a son or a daughter, you
[1:23:14] have an anchor, you have a faith, you
[1:23:17] have a message that is holding true.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And I have more to say about that.
[1:23:25] If you believe, nothing shall be
[1:23:28] impossible to them that believe.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Believest thou this?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Believest thou this? Today, now.
[1:23:37] Amen. And those of you with young
[1:23:40] family, you need to wait till they're
[1:23:42] 17, 18, 20 and see where they're going
[1:23:44] and see where they're headed. And when
[1:23:46] they head the wrong direction, then you
[1:23:48] have to know where your faith is
[1:23:50] anchored.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It's not just a hope. So,
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; it's not just some frivolous thing, but
[1:23:56] it is you have to know in whom you have
[1:23:58] believed and that this one must come
[1:24:01] because I am a son or a daughter of God,
[1:24:04] and I will not let them go.
[1:24:13] God's agent,
[1:24:15] the catalyst.
[1:24:18] Let me just say it this way. God sent
[1:24:23] the prophet of God in this generation
[1:24:27] to unite the bride to the bridegroom.
[1:24:33] And quite frankly, if that was the
[1:24:35] agent, which I am thoroughly convinced
[1:24:40] of, if that was the catalyst, there's no
[1:24:43] other way for it to happen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; God never says, "Well, I'll send this,
[1:24:48] but in case you don't like it, there'll
[1:24:51] be some other ways."
[1:24:53] No.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; God say, "This is it.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; This is me. I'm speaking. This is thus
[1:25:00] says the Lord and it's not thus sayith
[1:25:02] the Lord over here and maybe it's over
[1:25:03] there and maybe it's over there and
[1:25:05] maybe it's elsewhere. This is the voice
[1:25:07] of God
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; and it won't come to your taste. It
[1:25:11] won't come to your, you know, it doesn't
[1:25:13] have to come through your filter or
[1:25:14] anybody else's filter. God does it the
[1:25:17] way he wishes to do it. Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; In the message perfect faith,
[1:25:25] he says, "And now we become
[1:25:28] anointed with the same spirit, anointed
[1:25:30] messiahs, messiahs of the last day to
[1:25:34] shine forth the resurrection of Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ to show that he is not dead, but
[1:25:39] in the form of the Holy Ghost, he's in
[1:25:42] his people."
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:45] moving among his bride with a love
[1:25:48] affair to her,
[1:25:51] pouring out into her
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; himself.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah.
[1:26:03] He says they are becoming one for the
[1:26:07] wedding supper.
[1:26:09] And the same signs
[1:26:12] just please listen very very close and
[1:26:13] attentive promised by the same God
[1:26:18] in the word is making his making the
[1:26:21] same manifestations.
[1:26:23] And I just want to I want you to know
[1:26:26] unequivocally
[1:26:27] there was no other manifestation like
[1:26:30] the manifestation brother Brandham's
[1:26:32] ministry by any other person. Not
[1:26:35] because I'm saying it. That is a record.
[1:26:38] That is historical. That is something
[1:26:40] that God did and all the world has had
[1:26:43] to acknowledge it.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Now, if you look at it just in a
[1:26:50] on a superficial way, my words won't
[1:26:53] have a whole lot of weight to you, but
[1:26:55] you listen now, please. The same signs
[1:26:59] promised by the same God in the same
[1:27:03] word is making his same manifestation.
[1:27:07] There's nothing left for us to do but to
[1:27:09] believe it.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And to believe it is the substance
[1:27:14] and that creates a perfect faith.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; He says now the same one,
[1:27:23] it's not a stranger off somewhere. The
[1:27:26] same one, he's speaking of this Christ.
[1:27:27] He said he's here. He's here and does
[1:27:32] this to create a perfect faith. He said,
[1:27:35] "I feel him." Now, the audience perhaps
[1:27:38] didn't. I feel him and I know that he's
[1:27:41] here now. I know that his spirit is
[1:27:43] here. I know that he knows all things.
[1:27:47] Amen. And I know he wants to do
[1:27:49] something. He's been doing something to
[1:27:52] create this perfection of faith in the
[1:27:55] people.
[1:27:58] Another one, please.
[1:28:02] He asked a question and I feel I ask it
[1:28:05] this morning. I was going to
[1:28:10] I was going to avoid this
[1:28:13] not for the sake of avoiding it but I
[1:28:16] just thought that I would like to have
[1:28:18] carried on with the same theme. But he
[1:28:21] asked this question. Are we going to
[1:28:22] walk into eternity like the days of Noah
[1:28:26] when there were eight?
[1:28:29] The days of Lot and Sodom when there
[1:28:31] were three?
[1:28:35] Or the days of John the Baptist with six
[1:28:37] believers.
[1:28:40] Let us believe
[1:28:43] for his works
[1:28:45] are perfect.
[1:28:48] They're manifested daily, perfectly
[1:28:52] before us, showing that he is the word,
[1:28:54] and the word is the discerner of the
[1:28:57] thoughts and intents of the heart. My
[1:28:59] friends, the message which we hold to is
[1:29:03] not merely some other teaching as
[1:29:06] opposed to everyone else's teaching.
[1:29:09] There is no vindication. There is no you
[1:29:12] can take any church organization and
[1:29:15] incidentally the denominations and
[1:29:18] church organizations all with one voice
[1:29:22] declare or imply that we are the
[1:29:26] unifying power. We can connect you with
[1:29:29] God. And I can tell you it's a false
[1:29:32] claim.
[1:29:35] They claim to be the agent. We are the
[1:29:39] catalyst. step into our organization or
[1:29:43] step into our web. I would say more
[1:29:46] correctly. Step into our net
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; and we will put you in touch with the
[1:29:53] living God and through our method
[1:29:56] through our belief we'll put you in
[1:29:58] touch with God. Can you believe that
[1:30:01] millions unto untold millions of
[1:30:04] churches are claiming to put people in
[1:30:07] touch with God and will not take them to
[1:30:09] water in the name of Jesus Christ?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Deny it and war against it and fight
[1:30:18] against it and will not baptize people
[1:30:20] in the name of the precious Lord Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ who is the only name and the only
[1:30:26] access to the father. And they're
[1:30:28] saying, "We'll unite you with the
[1:30:29] father, but we will not call his name
[1:30:31] out even when you go down in the
[1:30:34] similitude of his burial." Right?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Like the old brother in India said, "Was
[1:30:39] the father did the was the father buried
[1:30:41] for you?
[1:30:43] Was the father crucified for you?"
[1:30:47] No, the father wasn't crucified. Jesus
[1:30:51] Christ the son was crucified.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He was the one who was buried. He was
[1:30:57] the one who was resurrected and going
[1:30:59] into that water. For those of you going
[1:31:01] to be baptized tonight, you are you're
[1:31:03] living now. You're going to die there.
[1:31:07] I'm going to bury you or somebody's
[1:31:08] going to bury you in the name of Jesus
[1:31:10] Christ into the tomb and rise up out of
[1:31:14] the watery grave to walk in newness of
[1:31:17] life. Not by some uh uh uh super
[1:31:21] emotional experience but by the coming
[1:31:24] of the Holy Spirit. Why would the spirit
[1:31:27] come? Is because you have acted
[1:31:29] according to the word
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; and it's the spirit that is not the
[1:31:34] byproduct. He is God.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And he will take a clay, a portion of
[1:31:43] clay of this earth that came by a a
[1:31:46] sexual bar, came by a secondary way as
[1:31:50] it were, and fill that vessel
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; with
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; with something that's not separated from
[1:32:00] God,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; but is a part of God.
[1:32:07] the word made flesh
[1:32:10] and just as this is just as as it was
[1:32:13] it's rushing up through brother Brandham
[1:32:16] in in his prophetic office to the word
[1:32:19] made flesh. Hallelujah. The word
[1:32:22] operating in human flesh by physical
[1:32:25] signs by material signs by scriptural
[1:32:28] signs perfectly. In other words, what
[1:32:31] was this whole ministry? He said to
[1:32:34] bring to you a perfect faith for a
[1:32:38] perfect rapture. Amen.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; I want to major on this morning.
[1:32:46] This congregation,
[1:32:48] believers of this message
[1:32:51] have received
[1:32:54] the agent of God,
[1:32:57] the catalyst,
[1:32:59] that which activates and accelerates
[1:33:02] something within the individual,
[1:33:05] a faith,
[1:33:08] a something that is laying there, a
[1:33:10] seed,
[1:33:11] an eternal seed
[1:33:14] that could not be satisfied. ified by
[1:33:17] anything in the world. You could not be
[1:33:20] satisfied. You've tried this and you've
[1:33:23] tried that. And throughout this audience
[1:33:25] of people this morning, we've tried just
[1:33:26] about everything.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Every church, every kind of belief in
[1:33:31] religion
[1:33:33] and non-religion
[1:33:35] and came to the conclusion there's
[1:33:37] nothing that can satisfy the soul.
[1:33:42] There's a lot that, you know, might
[1:33:44] appease us, but it's not a satisfying
[1:33:46] portion.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; As the eagle stirth his nest,
[1:33:55] he said, "My ministry,"
[1:33:59] now you hear it from him, "is a ministry
[1:34:02] trying to unite the body of Christ
[1:34:05] together."
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Not unite denominations to one another.
[1:34:11] Not trying to unite denominations to
[1:34:13] another denomination,
[1:34:15] but to unite brothers and sisters in one
[1:34:18] group of people in one in purpose, one
[1:34:21] in heart, one in unity.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; That was the purpose.
[1:34:31] And so the Holy Spirit is the unifying
[1:34:35] force.
[1:34:39] Now,
[1:34:43] I hope you don't mind me using these
[1:34:44] quotes. I'm using more than perhaps I
[1:34:47] usually do because I want to be very,
[1:34:49] very definitive today. Have you followed
[1:34:52] me thus far?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; He said, because now I want to return to
[1:34:59] this.
[1:35:01] Because Adam and his bride taken from
[1:35:03] his body,
[1:35:06] Christ has his bride taken from his
[1:35:09] body.
[1:35:10] And when Christ died, there was three
[1:35:12] elements
[1:35:14] that came from his body. Water, blood,
[1:35:18] and spirit.
[1:35:21] Justification
[1:35:22] through believing, water, sanctification
[1:35:25] through the blood, and baptism of the
[1:35:28] Holy Spirit. Now this last great step
[1:35:33] must come into the perfection that the
[1:35:35] Holy Spirit has to live in that church
[1:35:38] so perfectly.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Has to live within
[1:35:44] that so perfectly in Mary's belief. He
[1:35:47] promised in the last days and then I've
[1:35:49] got some slides I want to show you.
[1:35:53] He promised in the last days that the
[1:35:55] church would grow so close from the days
[1:35:58] of Luther
[1:36:00] justification, Wesley sanctification,
[1:36:03] the days of Pentecost, which is the
[1:36:05] restoration of the gifts right into the
[1:36:07] headstone.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And through that through that would
[1:36:12] bring forth the whole body, the
[1:36:15] resurrection of every believer.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; You know these words are so powerful.
[1:36:20] Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So powerful.
[1:36:24] But as the spirit of God grows closer,
[1:36:27] just like the shadow of my hand, the
[1:36:29] shadow gets darker and darker and darker
[1:36:32] until the shadow and the hand become the
[1:36:35] same thing.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; If you hold your hand up, you got a
[1:36:39] shadow against the wall. You move your
[1:36:41] hand towards the shadow. Towards the
[1:36:43] shadow. This is the positive. That's the
[1:36:45] negative. But when you move it closer
[1:36:47] and closer closer, it gets right to the
[1:36:50] wall. Then the shadow, the negative and
[1:36:54] the positive become one.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And you do not see the negative anymore.
[1:36:58] You only see the positive.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; And that is what this ministry was all
[1:37:02] about. That God came down and through an
[1:37:06] agent, through a catalyst,
[1:37:08] through a vessel, reflected himself. And
[1:37:12] it got it went from a first pull to a
[1:37:15] second pull to a third pull because God
[1:37:18] is not just miracles. His attribute is
[1:37:21] miracles. God is not just the revealing
[1:37:24] of the secrets of the heart. But what
[1:37:26] God is is word.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; And so finally God had to say speak
[1:37:31] through it. Not say you're sick, you're
[1:37:33] from a certain city, you have a certain
[1:37:35] disease, you're praying for a certain
[1:37:36] person. Like you said to a woman I heard
[1:37:38] the other day, take that handkerchief
[1:37:40] that your tear just dropped off on and
[1:37:42] take it to that person. They'll be well.
[1:37:44] It those are all wonderful. Those are
[1:37:46] blessings. Those are attributes. But
[1:37:47] that's not it, my brother, my sister.
[1:37:50] God is word. In the beginning was the
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; word
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; and the word was with God.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And the word was
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; and the word was
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; the word is God. And so when that vessel
[1:38:03] finally begins to speak and say, "Thus
[1:38:06] saith the Lord,"
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; that now is not a blessing anymore.
[1:38:11] That's not just an attribute anymore.
[1:38:14] That is God coming forth. That's his
[1:38:16] breath coming forth. That's his life
[1:38:19] coming forth. And all the attributes are
[1:38:21] in that.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; God, that's his spirit. And that's why
[1:38:28] the when you receive that The Holy Ghost
[1:38:33] comes to that.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Doesn't come to marry, John, Susie, and
[1:38:37] and all the rest of it. It doesn't
[1:38:38] matter what your name is. Doesn't matter
[1:38:40] where you were born. Doesn't matter what
[1:38:42] nationality you are. Doesn't matter what
[1:38:45] your physical stature appears as. It
[1:38:48] comes, the Holy Spirit comes to that
[1:38:51] heart that believes.
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:38:55] The Bible says that Jesus he was seen of
[1:38:57] above 500 brethren after his sac after
[1:39:01] his crucifixion and only 120 of the 500
[1:39:05] went to the upper room.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not say to the apostles and
[1:39:10] you've heard me say it many times. Jesus
[1:39:12] did not say to the apostles, Peter, you
[1:39:14] be sure that you're there. John, James,
[1:39:18] Andrew, make sure you're there. You must
[1:39:20] be there. Make sure my mother is there.
[1:39:23] Make sure Mary is there. He never said
[1:39:25] any of those things. He just said it.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Go and Terry
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And 380 had other things to do.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; 380 had things to take care of. I can't
[1:39:39] go. I got responsibilities. I got a
[1:39:41] family. I've got this. I've got that. I
[1:39:43] can't go. So when the Holy Spirit come,
[1:39:46] the Holy Spirit didn't come to John or
[1:39:48] Andrew or Mary or someone else. The Holy
[1:39:51] Spirit came to the word
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; and they were the ones who heard the
[1:39:56] word and took it into their bosom and
[1:39:58] were there waiting caring for the Holy
[1:40:01] Spirit and the Holy Spirit come to the
[1:40:03] word. And so in this day and age when
[1:40:05] the believer when a person who says I'm
[1:40:07] a believer here's thus says the Lord one
[1:40:09] says I got to think that over. He's not
[1:40:12] going to come to what you think over.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I got to figure that out. He's not going
[1:40:15] to come to what you figured out. But to
[1:40:17] that one who says I may not understand
[1:40:19] it. I can't put it together, but I do
[1:40:22] believe it.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit says, I will come to
[1:40:26] that. I will come to that. I will come
[1:40:30] to that heart.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit comes and that is
[1:40:35] oneness with God.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Now full unity has taken place and the
[1:40:41] catalyst has has activated and
[1:40:43] accelerated the little bit of faith that
[1:40:46] was in your heart and you believed it.
[1:40:49] and you're made one with God.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; This is not the doing of man.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; This is God's doing and it's marvelous
[1:41:01] in our eyes.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Can we have slide one?
[1:41:14] The word oneness.
[1:41:20] How long's that been up there?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Just now. Thanks, brother Roger.
[1:41:27] The word oneness means to be one
[1:41:30] with oneness, united.
[1:41:34] He said, "This is teaching doctrine."
[1:41:38] So, what I've been saying this morning
[1:41:40] is not just some, you know, little light
[1:41:42] message or something that I think will
[1:41:45] fit a Wednesday or a Sunday morning
[1:41:47] service. This, he said, is doctrine.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Study it prayerfully and carefully.
[1:41:55] Weigh it out in the balance of God's
[1:41:56] word to see whether it be of God or not.
[1:42:00] Slide two.
[1:42:04] That's God's purpose.
[1:42:07] And his purpose as father supreme was to
[1:42:10] be one with his family, earthly family,
[1:42:13] Adam and Eve. And the only way that they
[1:42:16] could be one with the family. The only
[1:42:19] way they could be one with the family or
[1:42:22] with God was because God's nature was in
[1:42:26] them. Notice how Paul said in in uh uh
[1:42:31] Ephesians that we were by nature the
[1:42:35] children of wrath.
[1:42:37] But now God, he's going to take that
[1:42:41] nature out from you. I'm not just
[1:42:44] talking about, you know, some of our
[1:42:46] natural
[1:42:48] characteristics and idiosyncrasies. I'm
[1:42:51] talking about the very nature of God.
[1:42:54] Hallelujah. We're made new creatures in
[1:42:56] Christ Jesus.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, we need to preach this message with
[1:43:01] force and with power.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Because God's nature was in them. So
[1:43:10] that made them
[1:43:12] with God's nature in them. Then with
[1:43:15] each other and God, they became all one.
[1:43:21] The next slide speaks of the h of the
[1:43:27] scripture I just referred to among whom
[1:43:29] also we all had our conversation in
[1:43:32] times past in the lust of our flesh
[1:43:34] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:43:36] of the mind and where by nature the
[1:43:39] children of wrath even as others
[1:43:42] Ephesians 2 and3 it says in times past
[1:43:46] so that's not to be now in times past.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Next slide, please.
[1:43:55] He said, "Now, isn't that a
[1:43:57] a beautiful picture? God in his family,
[1:44:02] father overall, supreme. No death, no
[1:44:04] sorrow, no heartaches, no nothing, just
[1:44:06] joy, unspeakable, never to be sick,
[1:44:09] never to have a heartache, just one with
[1:44:12] God." What a picture.
[1:44:15] Because the very nature of God was in
[1:44:18] these people and therefore what they did
[1:44:20] they followed just in line with God and
[1:44:23] God with them made them one.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; What's the next slide please? Uh
[1:44:35] the first man and the first woman in the
[1:44:37] garden of Eden was in perfect harmony
[1:44:40] with God. So much so that God could come
[1:44:44] down in any time at any time he desired
[1:44:47] and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve.
[1:44:51] Now that is perfect oneness.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Let me just stop there and have you not
[1:44:56] look at the screen, but just watch me
[1:44:57] for a moment. Please have your
[1:44:59] attention.
[1:45:02] I believe God should be able to speak to
[1:45:04] us at any time.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; At any time. Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; You might be over the sink in the
[1:45:09] morning just washing.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You ladies may be just getting
[1:45:14] breakfast.
[1:45:16] You may be in the laundry.
[1:45:19] You could be in the bedroom
[1:45:22] making the beds or some tedious task.
[1:45:26] But you should never lose
[1:45:28] the awareness that God at any moment
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; could just step in.
[1:45:36] You say, "Well, he's always there." Yes,
[1:45:37] but in I'm I'm speaking of in a special
[1:45:39] way for fellowship.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, God who know who fills
[1:45:46] all time and space.
[1:45:50] He said when Jesus was here, he only
[1:45:52] asked for one thing, fellowship.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; You might not be aware of it just now
[1:45:59] sitting here, but do you know that the
[1:46:01] scripture says of Jesus
[1:46:05] And he was alone.
[1:46:08] And he went and he was alone.
[1:46:11] And when he came to the crisis of his
[1:46:14] life, which was the garden,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; and the crowds had left him. And the
[1:46:19] powerful ministry was gone. Not from
[1:46:23] him, but from ministering to the people.
[1:46:25] They were gone. He lost 4,988
[1:46:30] with just a short short message. He
[1:46:33] preached a short message and 4,988
[1:46:36] left him. And that was when he turned to
[1:46:39] the disciples and said, "Would you leave
[1:46:40] also?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; To whom shall we go? For thou hast the
[1:46:43] words of eternal life."
[1:46:47] But when he came to the garden where the
[1:46:50] prophet said the spirit actually left
[1:46:52] him, he didn't have that sustaining. He
[1:46:55] went as a man.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; He went like you or I to Calvary.
[1:47:01] He walked as a man to Calvary.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; And he went and he was alone.
[1:47:08] He asked the three, "Come and tarry
[1:47:14] with me and wait with me
[1:47:18] God
[1:47:19] in flesh."
[1:47:21] But he desired the companionship
[1:47:24] of those that he had he had spoken to so
[1:47:27] personally and privately.
[1:47:30] those that he loved,
[1:47:33] not necessarily more than others, but
[1:47:34] those that he shared deeper things with.
[1:47:40] It might be at your job.
[1:47:43] Could be at any moment. could be in the
[1:47:46] m in the very midst of your most intense
[1:47:49] occupation of your whole being and your
[1:47:52] mind and all of your faculties and
[1:47:54] you're just so intense upon something
[1:47:56] and you'll just sense you become aware
[1:48:01] of another presence.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is catching a plane. He
[1:48:10] told me this account and I'm going to
[1:48:11] close because I'm not even halfway done.
[1:48:14] is going to catch a plane. The plane was
[1:48:18] brought down on account of a snowstorm
[1:48:20] into Memphis, Tennessee.
[1:48:24] And they had to overnight the
[1:48:26] passengers.
[1:48:28] And in the morning, he had some things
[1:48:30] he wanted to mail. I think some cards
[1:48:33] that he had written. He wanted to mail
[1:48:34] the cards. And so he's just going
[1:48:37] downstairs
[1:48:39] through the lobby. He's going to mail
[1:48:42] his cards. walks out onto the street
[1:48:45] going down the street to find a place to
[1:48:46] post the cards,
[1:48:50] comes to a corner, says there's a
[1:48:51] policeman standing there, just standing
[1:48:54] there
[1:48:56] and he hears just a little something.
[1:48:59] Keep walking.
[1:49:01] He said he actually turned there was a
[1:49:03] store and he looked in the window of the
[1:49:06] store
[1:49:07] so he could just say, "Father, is that
[1:49:10] you?"
[1:49:12] He's not he's not making preparation to
[1:49:16] do any great act or thing.
[1:49:21] He's on his way to mail some cards. He's
[1:49:24] waiting to catch a plane in just a short
[1:49:26] few moments. And there's a little
[1:49:28] something, just a little something
[1:49:30] inside. Keep walking.
[1:49:33] So he keeps on walking.
[1:49:36] Come to another block. Keep walking.
[1:49:39] kept walking. He told me he kept walking
[1:49:42] just every at at just certain intervals.
[1:49:44] He wondered is he there? Is he there?
[1:49:45] And he just kept walking. Keep walking.
[1:49:48] Said finally he got into the area that
[1:49:51] was a colored area of the city of
[1:49:52] Memphis
[1:49:56] and he kept walking. It was early
[1:49:57] morning.
[1:50:01] Looks down the street.
[1:50:04] There's a large colored woman. She's
[1:50:06] leaning on the fence.
[1:50:11] And he walks past her,
[1:50:13] says, "Good morning, auntie."
[1:50:17] Says, "Morning, Parson."
[1:50:21] He stopped.
[1:50:23] He said, "How do you know I was a
[1:50:26] preacher?"
[1:50:27] "How'd you know I was a parson?"
[1:50:30] She said, "I was praying early this
[1:50:33] morning
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; and I saw a man just like you
[1:50:38] come by, only he was carrying a a case,
[1:50:41] a briefcase." He says, "I have one. It's
[1:50:44] back at the hotel."
[1:50:48] He said, "My name's William Brandham.
[1:50:50] Have you been in my meetings or
[1:50:52] something? You know me?" "No," she said.
[1:50:54] I don't know you, but I was praying this
[1:50:57] morning
[1:51:00] and I saw you coming by and I've been
[1:51:02] waiting for you.
[1:51:08] She said, "I got a son."
[1:51:11] She said, "Parson Brandom, he's a good
[1:51:14] boy,
[1:51:16] but he got into some bad company.
[1:51:20] He's got a social disease
[1:51:23] and he's dying. They've sent him home
[1:51:26] from the hospital to die.
[1:51:31] Says, uh, he's inside. Brother Brandon
[1:51:35] walks in.
[1:51:37] He told me
[1:51:39] said the walls were papered with
[1:51:41] newspapers.
[1:51:45] She didn't have wallpaper.
[1:51:47] said, "Over the door, I saw a little
[1:51:49] sign,
[1:51:51] God bless our home,
[1:51:54] and there was a big tall colored boy."
[1:52:00] And he's groaning, "Oh, oh, so dark in
[1:52:05] here," he said. It's so dark in here.
[1:52:08] And he's rising on this bed. So dark in
[1:52:11] here.
[1:52:15] And she says, "Parson Brandon, will you
[1:52:18] pray for him?"
[1:52:21] Yes. He said, "He took a hold of his
[1:52:22] feet and they were already cold. Death,
[1:52:25] they were cold and clammy. Death had
[1:52:27] already come on him and was moving up
[1:52:30] through his body. He was in a state of
[1:52:33] dying at that moment." says he looked up
[1:52:36] at her says a big full th cheeks tears
[1:52:42] coming down her cheeks and she was
[1:52:44] patting him on the cheek says mama's boy
[1:52:50] mama's boy
[1:52:54] Brandon prayed a simple prayer
[1:52:57] that God would heal him touch him raise
[1:52:59] him up
[1:53:01] says and in a few moments he says mama
[1:53:05] I see a little light.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:53:11] Brother Brandham slipped out, went
[1:53:12] quickly back to his hotel, was just
[1:53:15] going through the lobby, and they said,
[1:53:16] "Oh, Reverend Brandom, they're looking
[1:53:18] for you." Cuz the plane was delayed. It
[1:53:21] didn't even get off. And God held it up.
[1:53:24] And he got on that on the plane he was
[1:53:26] supposed to get on. But then he turned
[1:53:28] to me and says, "Brother Eddie,"
[1:53:33] believe me, I was listening.
[1:53:36] He said, "Do you know what brought that
[1:53:37] airplane down in a snowstorm the day
[1:53:41] before? Do you know what brought that
[1:53:42] airplane down?"
[1:53:45] I said, "No." He said, "That woman's
[1:53:48] love."
[1:53:51] That woman's love brought an airplane
[1:53:54] down out of the sky
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; and caused an Elijah prophet to come by
[1:54:00] her way and she was out there waiting
[1:54:03] for him. And that she said she was all
[1:54:06] wet from the dew. She'd been there all
[1:54:09] through the early morning. I tell you,
[1:54:11] my brother, my sister, God had a voice.
[1:54:16] God had something that would answer to
[1:54:18] that kind of perfect faith that woman
[1:54:20] had. And years later, he was getting on
[1:54:23] a train and a young man come running up.
[1:54:26] He was a colored young man, just
[1:54:29] beautiful in his features said, "Oh,
[1:54:31] Brother Brandham, Brother Brandham." He
[1:54:33] said, "Do I you know me?" "Yeah." He
[1:54:34] said, "You prayed for me years ago when
[1:54:36] I was dying." He said, "I'm now a Sunday
[1:54:39] school teacher. I believe in a Baptist
[1:54:40] church.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; God had raised him up.
[1:54:46] You know friends,
[1:54:50] this God that we speak about and this
[1:54:52] message that we speak about, this is a
[1:54:54] supernatural gospel.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; And I want you to be able to go out of
[1:55:00] this place today
[1:55:03] knowing of assurityity
[1:55:06] that God, this message, when you say
[1:55:09] message, I want you to think of this
[1:55:10] phrase, unifying force.
[1:55:14] unifying force.
[1:55:16] This is a power that's not dependent
[1:55:18] upon how good you are or what you do,
[1:55:22] but it is on what you believe.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; And if we can say, Lord, I believe.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Not just this part and that part and my
[1:55:30] selective part, but I believe the word
[1:55:33] that you have sent, I can say to you,
[1:55:36] the Holy Ghost will come to that word.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then you say, "What happens
[1:55:43] then? Do I get a good feeling? Do I get
[1:55:45] Oh, no. Don't worry about the feeling."
[1:55:47] That's not what we're interested in.
[1:55:49] When the Holy Ghost comes to the word,
[1:55:52] there is a union that takes place.
[1:55:55] There's a chemistry that takes place.
[1:55:58] And he said that can never be separated
[1:56:02] from God. It's not something that's just
[1:56:05] given of God. That is why friends, that
[1:56:08] is why it was so well explained to me
[1:56:10] and I'm so thankful for it. Brother
[1:56:12] Brandham took his pen went like this to
[1:56:14] me. He said, "Brother Eddie, this is a
[1:56:17] gift of William Brandham. This is not
[1:56:21] William Brham."
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; And then I understand there's a big
[1:56:24] difference between the gift of the Holy
[1:56:27] Ghost or the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:30] the Holy Ghost himself. Amen.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in just receiving a
[1:56:35] gift of the Holy Ghost. I want him
[1:56:37] himself.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; I want him the person
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; of God.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; It's not another one.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; It's not even a part of God. It's not a
[1:56:48] third person. It is the person.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That comes into you and you
[1:56:55] are fused into one family. Amen.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; I could become a renegade. I could
[1:57:03] disgrace my family. I could drag my
[1:57:05] father's name into the mud. I could be
[1:57:08] the worst criminal, the worst addict,
[1:57:10] the worst anything. I could be a
[1:57:12] scumball of the world. But I can never I
[1:57:17] can never separate myself from being
[1:57:19] Fred Biscll's son.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; His life is in me and I cannot separate
[1:57:25] it. And if that happens at the human
[1:57:27] level, how much more at the eternal
[1:57:30] level,
[1:57:32] my brother, my sister, and God, there
[1:57:34] had to be a certain agent. There had to
[1:57:37] be a way that I could come into the
[1:57:39] world. And there is no other way.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; It came by a birth. My father's seed
[1:57:46] entered into my mother's womb. And as a
[1:57:49] result of conception took place
[1:57:52] and you were born into this world.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; If that happened in the natural, how
[1:57:59] much more in the spiritual and that that
[1:58:01] can never be reversed. My father can't
[1:58:04] reverse it. My mother can't reverse it.
[1:58:06] Nobody can reverse it. No matter who
[1:58:09] what I have done or what it is. And I
[1:58:12] can say to you on the order of God's
[1:58:14] word, on the authority of God's word,
[1:58:17] there's nothing that can separate us
[1:58:19] from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
[1:58:23] You tell that devil he has no right to
[1:58:25] be in your territory.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; What can separate you from the love of
[1:58:32] God?
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Death, no.
[1:58:36] Life, no.
[1:58:38] Nothing can separate. He has torn
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; and he will heal.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; He has smitten and he will bind up.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; He is God.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Say that. He is God.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; He is God.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; He has torn
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; and he will heal.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Isn't that Isn't that the
[1:59:03] song you sing, Sister Margaret? He is
[1:59:06] torn. Hallelujah. and he will heal. He
[1:59:10] has smitten. This is a sovereign God.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; You think I'm excited about this
[1:59:18] message? I'm not near as excited as I
[1:59:20] ought to be.
[1:59:23] When you think the almighty God dames to
[1:59:26] come down amongst us and be united with
[1:59:30] you as an individual, oh I say, what is
[1:59:33] man that darn mindful of him or the son
[1:59:36] of man that thou considerest him?
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; I'm here to give my breath and my lips
[1:59:46] and my tongue to say praise be to God.
[1:59:49] Hallelujah.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; This whole congregation should with a
[1:59:53] one voice say praise be to God.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Let's give him praise.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; He is torn. He is healed.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; He's almighty God.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; He's made us one with him.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Almighty God.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:20] Hallelujah.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; He's God.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; And there's none like him. There's none
[2:00:32] beside him.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:38] Oh God,
[2:00:41] how great thou art.
[2:00:44] How great thou art.
[2:00:52] Hallelujah.
[2:00:55] Hallelujah.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; United.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; United with the Almighty.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; There is nothing else, oh God, that
[2:01:04] could unite us. Nothing.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; It's not just an experience. It's an act
[2:01:11] of almighty God.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You have performed this
[2:01:16] mighty operation.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; We thank you.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Bless the people, oh God. Bless the
[2:01:23] people, I pray.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand to our feet?
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Then sings my soul, my savior God to
[2:01:30] thee.
[2:01:32] Just give it all your voice,
[2:01:35] [Music]
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; all your strength,
[2:01:40] and see what he shall do.
[2:01:46] Then sings my soul,
[2:01:50] my savior
[2:01:53] come to thee.
[2:01:57] How great thou art.
[2:02:01] [Music]

[2:02:34] my soul,
[2:02:37] my
[2:02:39] heart.
[2:02:44] How great are
[2:02:49] [Music]
[2:02:54] you in my soul?
[2:02:59] I say
[2:03:01] are you
[2:03:06] how great are
[2:03:12] how great
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:18] [Music]
[2:03:20] had it not been
[2:03:23] for a place called
[2:03:26] my heart.
[2:03:28] That's where it was torn.
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:40] And that is nothing
[2:03:43] for
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:44] [Applause]
[2:03:46] me.
[2:03:50] and forever.
[2:03:51] [Applause]
[2:04:00] That is not
[2:04:02] for all.
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:09] That is not
[2:04:11] for
[2:04:18] and that is not
[2:04:21] for
[2:04:24] Jesus.
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:27] Then forever
[2:04:30] my soul
[2:04:33] belongs.
[2:04:35] Verse two. I'm so glad
[2:04:39] he was willing
[2:04:42] to

[2:04:48] father
[2:04:51] from me
[2:04:53] [Music]
[2:04:55] and I'm so glad
[2:05:00] he changed
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:04] his hand.
[2:05:06] Oh my

[2:05:36] Jesus
[2:05:40] and forever
[2:05:43] my soul will be lost
[2:05:49] just before we're going to leave and
[2:05:51] there are many here from perhaps Seattle
[2:05:53] Tacoma and elsewhere
[2:05:56] and we did ask if you can possibly make
[2:06:00] room to have someone over.
[2:06:03] Don't be afraid to come forward and
[2:06:05] perhaps brother Diddy perhaps you'd
[2:06:07] stand at the back. Would you please just

[2:06:21] it'll be better for everyone, I believe.

[2:10:07] in this little intercession intermission
[2:10:10] rather than intercession intermission
[2:10:12] until we come this evening. Hallelujah.
[2:10:16] Hallelujah.
[2:10:21] Oh father,
[2:10:24] what a great and mighty God you are that
[2:10:29] you would come and
[2:10:32] sit with us,
[2:10:35] speak to us, explain yourself to us,
[2:10:40] show yourself to us and live in us.
[2:10:45] Oh father, we just so rejoice today
[2:10:49] that Lord we could come even closer to
[2:10:52] you that you are not just a gift to us
[2:10:54] Lord but you are living in us God
[2:10:58] almighty God.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; We just so love you Father. We just so
[2:11:03] rejoice at your presence.
[2:11:06] And father, now as we take this
[2:11:09] intermission, Lord,
[2:11:11] we just ask that you would go with each
[2:11:13] of us, Lord,
[2:11:16] let us fellowship with you amongst the
[2:11:18] saints, Lord, over a meal, a time of
[2:11:22] rest. And Father, as we come back this
[2:11:26] evening, Lord, we just ask that you
[2:11:28] would be here,
[2:11:30] a supernatural presence, Lord, in the
[2:11:32] songs, in the worship, in the prayers
[2:11:35] and the praise, the footwashing,
[2:11:39] the sharing of the Lord's table,
[2:11:42] the communion,

[2:12:11] greet one another and then we should
[2:12:14] depart just reverently. Say, "Well, I'd
[2:12:16] like to stay in this atmosphere." Well,
