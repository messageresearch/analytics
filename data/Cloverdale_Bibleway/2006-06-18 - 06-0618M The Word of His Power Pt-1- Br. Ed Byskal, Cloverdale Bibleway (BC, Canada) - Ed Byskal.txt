Um, Anna, my daughter, has uh wants to thank everyone for praying for her friend. Remember, we prayed for him. I guess it was 2 weeks ago. He was in a very serious car accident and uh he's had a miraculously quick recovery and is already back at school. And uh she's also requesting that we remember her friend Jeff Raul. Uh has been over to our place a number of times. Uh his lung collapsed on Thursday's in the hospital. They don't know what's causing it. So, I want to remember him this morning. Uh there's a request uh to remember Sister Divine from uh Seattle. Um she's in the hospital since Friday after delivering a baby and she's got some complications that resulting from the delivery of the babies. You want to remember her this morning. And sister Lori's requesting uh prayer for a woman who that she works with to get her appetite back. stopped eating and also for a special unspoken request. If you've got any needs this morning, you just lift it before the Lord as we go to prayer. And also, if you're listening in on the internet, we uh are aware that you're there and we just uh you just if you've got a need this morning, you just lift it before the Lord as we come before him for today. Let's pray together. [Music] Our gracious father, we want to thank you, oh God, for gathering us again here this morning. Lord, we know that this is the fulfillment of your word. This is your very desire. You admonished us, dear, Father, that as we see the day that will not forsake the assembling of ourselves. So this morning we come with open hearts, dear God, knowing that this is your will for our lives. This is your purpose for us this day. That you have something good in store for us, Father. We're so glad that you're not an historical God. We're so glad, Father, that you've been lifted out out of history, that you're alive and well this morning. Father alive, our hearts, our soul declare and testify that our God is alive. The risen son is among us. Father, our being pulsate with that faith believing that you even hear this morning. That every needs and divine presence will find oh God the answer. You are the great Jehovah Jara Father. And we just look to you once again that you can provide dear God for every life that is here. You know what we have need of dear God, even beyond our own realization, Father. You know our hearts. You know our condition, Father. And you have the word, oh God, that is more than a much for every need here this morning, Father. So we just invite you to have your full liberty among us. That you move, oh God, freely from pew to pure, from believer to believer, dear God. As we have assembled ourselves this morning, we believe the great pillar of fire is here. And only five minutes in that presence, dear God, can address every need that our lives can have today. How we desire to capitalize on this sacred opportunity. Father, knowing that one of these day, dear God, this kind of gathering will be just history. Father, for you told us by a vindicated prophet that this place will be shut down, dear God. But while we have the opportunity, while we have this privilege, Father, how we want to make much of it, dear God, how we want to draw benefit from your presence that is here, dear God, that will not go empty, Father, that will receive that which you have in store for us, oh God. Remove every hindrance from the way. lay side, oh God, every sin, every contrary spirit, we bind it, oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ, that the freedom of God will be among the church of the living God. That your name once again can be worshiped this morning, that you can be lifted out, that you can be admired, that you can be praised, oh God, that you can be, oh father, exalted in the congregation of the saints. How we so appreciate father every moment that we have in your presence Lord our hearts are open today to say let it be unto us even according to your will father that we can experience a great move of God a revival in our souls oh God for that's what our heart long for as we see the dead becoming more evil we want more of you father that we can be empty of self that you can fill us oh god fill us to overflowing Let your word, oh God, just find an entrance in every soul and every heart that something good will take place this morning. Father, we believe you here, Father, to work your will and your way to anoint your servant, to anoint your children, Father, that the word, oh God, can just minister to every life, oh Father, that when we come to the end of the meeting, our hearts can rejoice, that we can testify that you spoke to us along the way. Move among us, Father. And for need that have been mentioned this morning Lord our sister Anna's friend we ask that you'll go and visit him that is lung that has collapsed you are more than able father to prove yourself alive and for sister Lori dear God having written for this one who is need as well we just ask that your great Holy Spirit will find them dear God and deliver them from this condition and make yourself known to them father and even for sister divine mind. We just believe Father that even as you have given out this child that you can oh God touch the mother and heal her father and deliver her so completely that once again she'll be able to give you praise and thanks. Father we thank you for your servant this morning that has prepared himself to come and stand behind the sacred desk. We know his voice has been weak, but oh God, this is the days of the voice, and we believe that he'll come through and that the enemy will not be able to hinder him. Give him perfect liberty, Father. Give him strength as in the days even of his you, Father, that the word will just go forth and bring what we have need of this morning. Would you just have your way, Father? Glorify yourself among us by working the supernatural, by delivering those that are captive. Father, give healing to those that needs healing. Every unspoken request this morning, visit us each one. Father, we believe that your will concerning us and concerning this gathering. So have your way. Father, we commit this meeting to you in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. [Music] Want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. Um Claude Leance, it's brother Gee from brother Fernandez Fern Ferdinand Fay Church in Quebec City are visiting with us. Could we get you to stand so we know who you are? Happy to have you. God bless you. And also I've got uh someone visiting from Barbados, Nicholas Critslow. Nicholas, we're happy to have you here this morning. Any other visitors? We're just uh we want to extend a real warm welcome and uh trust you'd uh enjoy yourselves this morning in the presence of God. We have um a baby dedication this morning. Uh the Walmans bring their little one and as they're coming um maybe we could sing this morning. He knows my name. I have a father. Amen. Knows the name of this little one even before they were born. Amen. And while brother Tom's coming, we can sing this. I have a father. He calls me his own. And he'll never leave me. No matter where I go, [Music] he knows my name. He knows my every thought. He sees each tears that falls and hears me when I go. He knows my name. He knows my name. He knows my every [Music] me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I think it's very appropriate on a father's day. We wish the fathers all the best today. And we have a special father here this morning. Dear brother Martin, Sister Diana Woman are are uh bringing their little baby to be dedicated to the Lord. And if there's anybody that is visiting here this morning, you might say, "Well, why aren't you baptizing your babies?" Well, we don't find them baptized in the Bible. Uh it says that they took their children and that they took them to Jesus and Jesus would bless them. But I don't know where they get water baptism for babies because the Bible says repent and then be baptized. The baby doesn't know how to repent yet. &gt;&gt; But we would uh have a responsibility as parents to bring our children to the Lord to have them blessed of God and dedicated to him. And this morning we have Philillip Alexi Woman. And uh it's powerful names. You know, I was thinking about names as as we've over the last months have dedicated quite a few children. And I was thinking, did our parents and parents' parents did they really uh take the time to sit down and find out, you know, uh why we've named it you so. And I think today as believers, it is something that's so important. And with Phillip it is um I thought well I I'll just take a look at Philillip and see you know how many times that even in the message brother Brandon mentions Phillip. Well it's 969 times. Uh that's a that's a good name that uh I I think you can hold to I looked up Thomas and it's only about 69 times. So just to give you some sort of uh plum line there. So that's a lot. and Phillip um Phillip is a if you took the name of in the Greek form which I'm sure mom and dad you've done that and uh it says a lover of horses. Well, I didn't know that um Martin had a horse ranch. So, uh and I don't know whether he ever will have one and I don't know whether Philip will ever come up and be a lover of horses. But if you take a a little bit deeper into it is a man that is full of passion. And if you take a look at Philillip throughout the scripture, whether he be the evangelist, whether he be the apostle, whether he was a deacon in the church, there was something about Philillip that is outstanding. It said he had a passion for the word of God. &gt;&gt; He had a love for the word of God. And the scripture starts in uh John 1:43 says, "The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee findeth Philillip and said unto him, follow me." Well, may that same son of man come down and find this Phillip. And may he have the same passion as the Philillip did in the scripture that he finally came to the place where he said Jesus show us the father and that will suffice me that will give me such great contentment and may that anointing that passion be on this Phillip that at a young age he could say show me God let me see you that will be sufficient for me and I tell Saints of God, that is a tremendous attribute and characteristic to have. Alexi, well, you start to follow that chain and that comes from Alexander, defender of men. Well, we just pray that he'll be a defender of the son of man. Stand for that which is true. Stand pure and hold the word of God up high. It's an incredible thing that you can see such a beautiful young couple this morning cradling a gift from God. May God give the parents also the wisdom that's needed to guide and lead this child that Philip would come to know our Lord Jesus Christ and have a passion for the things of God. Let's pray as we dedicate. It's called a chip off the old block. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we're holding in our arms a gift from God. You've blessed this home. A young man one day dedicated his life to Christ. Something cried out and said, "Show me the Father. Show me a living God. I'll serve you and a mother the same. Lord &gt;&gt; and now they've given them this gift. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I dedicate him to you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that he would have a passion and a love for the things of God, a defender of the faith. Let him stand true &gt;&gt; to the word. Bless this son as we give him to you this morning. Give our dear sister wisdom, leadership &gt;&gt; as a mother. Let the fifth gospel ever shine through her life. We pray &gt;&gt; bless this child now as we dedicate him to you Lord in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've got a song this morning from the Episcopal Sisters. And as the children are coming in and they're getting ready uh to sing for us, let's sing together. These are troubled times, my friend, but God is in his people once again. These are troubled times, my friend. So we must be faithful to the end, keeping perfect peace with our Lord and satisfying all his commands, striving till we reach our reward through the awesome power of his word. He's a trouble time, my friend. But God is in his people once again. Oh, God is in his people once again. Fulfilling all the promises he has said, the truth, the word, the life. Manifest the wonders of his glory again in flesh. Preparing for the day when we see no longer through this glass of self dark. God is in his people once again. So we must be faithful to the end. [Music] [Music] The Lord could see [Music] all the guilt in me for the sin that I'd carried. so long. It left a flaw dark as crimson within my soul. [Music] So in love he came and removed the blame, lifting the blemish away. And by his grace he has made me pure and whole, wider than snow. His blood has washed me wher snow with nothing to hide. For deep inside I have been cleansed in Calary soul. All of the sin that tainted my heart with such a wretched scarlet stain has been erased in Jesus name. And I'm wider than snow. [Music] Iniquity [Music] left a mark on me that my best efforts could not purify. But in his sight I am rightous for I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe that redeeming blood is more than enough to go beyond all the shame. [Music] I'm not the same since the Savior made me clean. Wider than snow. His blood has washed me. Wider than snow. With nothing to hide. deep inside. I have been cleansed in Calary Lord. All of the sin the taint in my heart with such a wretch and such name has been erased in Jesus name and I'm lighter than star and I shall be wider than snow. Wash me and I shall be wider deep inside. I have been cleansed in Calary soul. All of the sin that tainted my heart such a sky has been erased in Jesus name. And I'm quieter than snow. &gt;&gt; Quieter than snow. &gt;&gt; You are quieter than snow. Wer than snow. Wer than snow. [Music] [Applause] What a testimony. &gt;&gt; What a joy. &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to rejoice in that. &gt;&gt; Appreciate that. Appreciate the song. Appreciate the all the effort and everyone who participated. I know the girls said they want to sing a song for Father's Day for me. So that's my Father's Day song and we shared it with everybody &gt;&gt; and we sang it to the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Whiter than snow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That wonderful. Are you happy this morning? &gt;&gt; God bless you. Nice to see the church full. Came to church early ourselves this morning. Found probably 30 or 40 cars in the parking lot an hour before church. And I said, 'Well, I don't know why everybody's coming so early. I said, 'Well, to get a seat. That's why they're coming. And we're happy that you're all here. Thank you for your prayers. And I just uh have something on my heart I wanted to preach this morning. So, &gt;&gt; we're we're just believing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I want to say that brother John Tay from Ghana is going to be with us. He's going to be actually with us for about a week starting this Tuesday. He arrives on Tuesday. And so I don't know just uh what he may speak on Wednesday or take a service on Sunday evening. He'll be with us over this next weekend. And just want to he called almost a year ago and said, "I want to make certain that you're going to be home. I want to be there uh on this particular week in June." So, Brother John Tay will be with us. He's only been here once before and uh we're uh looking forward to being with him and speaking tonight. Uh brother Tony is going to be speaking. It's been some time since brother Tony spoke and so you come and be fully expect expecting to hear something that God has put on brother Tony's heart. always burdened for missions but always burdened also for God's people wherever they are. Missions are only God's people. There's really no difference that those are just sister churches around the world. I often am asked, "Are there other churches like yourself?" Oh, I said, "My goodness, we're just a we're just a small little group compared to what God is doing around the world, and we don't even profess to know what all he's doing. I've gotten I've gotten four or five emails this week of what is taking place in Siberia and even under severe persecution. But uh we're we're so grateful for what God is doing. This is his word &gt;&gt; and this is his work and if this message is a message he sent he's responsible for taking it to wherever it's supposed to go and we believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in just another day or two meetings are also starting in Serbia and this is the second uh second annual uh convention that they've ever had there. uh and brother Milco was over there received a word from him also and so brother Vin is going to be speaking those meetings in Serbia and he said the people are filled with such expectation and of course you can imagine you know when something happens the first time it's really wonderful something happens the second time you never want to let it become just normal to you even you are here this morning some of you have been here for many many years but it should just be another special day. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Filled with expectation. And if you are, then God's going to just come and meet. If it's if you're just here to put in time, that's all you'll get is just put in some time. But if you're here to receive something, God will do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart. We're happy for all the godly fathers. &gt;&gt; Well, that was a little sound. Sound like some of you fathers must be very strict or something. But we're happy for all the godly fathers, &gt;&gt; aren't we? Speaking about fathers, we have one that I'm very happy for. &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father. I thought of it this morning early. Touched my heart. So glad I have a father like you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So glad that I have this opportunity to try to be an honor to your name and be an honor to you. So thankful that I'll have the privilege to be with your children, your people, people that you thought so much of that you sent Jesus Christ and paid that supreme sacrifice and bought them. back to yourself. Oh, how I thank you. What a privilege that we can be together today. Tell you, it's a great honor. That's our father and every day is his day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it so? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for you fathers, the world is remembering their fathers. And I just and and a father is not only someone who has brought forth children, but a father can be someone who is a role model. He's has leadership, someone that's an example, someone who has influence on others. And I trust that we will as men of this message will be that kind of an example and that you young men will be able to look up to that and look up to those and say that's a godly brother. You that are sons, you can look up to your father and say to your heavenly father, "I'm so thankful and I want to show my appreciation not just in a card or with a few words, but I want to show my appreciation by living an honorable life that'll bring honor upon my father's head, my upon my dad's life." I thought of Jacob when he called his sons before he was to pass away. It's it's a custom that is not kept today where a father will actually pass blessings that are literally prophetic upon his children, upon his sons. And he called all his sons. And he prophesied concerning each of them and blessed them with blessings. And even when Isaac blessed uh blessed Jacob and Esau cried out for a blessing, when he found that the blessing had already been passed to Jacob, he just cried out cried bitterly, "Isn't there a blessing left for me?" And but the blessing had already passed upon Jacob and his father could not withdraw it and draw it back. And I thought this morning that although we do not have that practice, I'm not sure that God has done away with it. &gt;&gt; Just simply because we do not do it doesn't mean that it it went by the boards, that it doesn't exist. I believe that as fathers, godly fathers, we should be able to come to a place at a time in our life when we can say to our sons and and our daughters, I bless you &gt;&gt; in the name of God, &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I bless you and bless your life and what you shall do and what you shall be for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a little personal note. Would you like to stand with me? And we're going to read out of Matthew's Gospel. And before we read, Brother Roy, I'm going to sing that chorus. If you would, please. We're going to I'm sorry. We're going to just sing this chorus. Father in Heaven, we thank you. Brother Rod, you'll lead it for us. 279 &gt;&gt; Father in heaven, we love you. We lift your name in all the earth. May your kingdom be established in your praises. As your people declare your mighty word, blessing God mighty to bless the mighty who lives forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord God. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who are blessed God mighty who lives forever. ever &gt;&gt; with our heads bowed. Dear Father, how we thank you, how we love you, how privileged we are to be able to say that we are your children and that you brought us forth. You gave us birth into your family and we feel in very deeply honored. We come to you with respects. We come to you with love. And oh God, we know that what you began in our lives is just the beginning. And what you have begun, you have you will finish. You will complete it. And we realize according to your word, we're just in a little journey at this time. We're passing through this veil of human life. But Lord, we have another goal in our eyesight. We've got the prize of the high calling before us. And we will not be deterred from the direction. We will not be deterred from the pathway that you've set before us. I ask you to bless this people, oh God. And Father, if there's any way that I can influence them in a more godly manner, I pray that they will be lifted up into heavenly places. Lord, even today by your Holy Spirit, take control of the speaker and the hearers of the word. I ask, oh God, you will defy and deny the enemy at every corner and every junction. You'll bind his power. You'll cast him out, oh God, of those where he's tried to harbor and and hinder. I pray, Lord, the lives will be set free in the name of Jesus Christ that that lives will be healed, homes will be healed. Lord, I pray that minds and souls will be healed by the power of your word in the name of Jesus Christ. Bless all who are listening with us, all who are watching now on the internet. We say blessings upon them and may they revel in the glory of God today in Jesus Christ's name, Lord. We're depending entirely upon you now. Bless your word. Anoint me, I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Matthew the 12th chapter and we're going to begin reading at verse 33. If you had a Scoffield Bible, Scoffield gives uh like subtitles to various segments of the scripture and Dr. Scoffield has called this this portion starting verse 33 destiny and words. Either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt. For the tree is known by his fruit. Oh generation of vipers, how can ye being evil speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. I'll have you turn also to Hebrews the first chapter and we're just reading one verse there and it's verse three. who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. May God bless his word to our hearts as you have your seats. What I'm speaking to you about this morning is is in this third verse of Hebrews 1 and the text is the word of his power. I will just have you notice it does not say the power of his word but it says the word of his power. Like you to notice that. Now there was another instance in the scripture where uh the father of a son delivered a young man to Jesus and uh there was a demon spirit which was tormenting him and would cast him into the fire and so on and u when they brought him to Jesus they said we brought my son I brought my son to your disciples but they were not able to cast him out. And so Jesus, he uh uh he just said they were of little faith. And then the Bible says that he cast out this tormenting spirit. And the the Bible then says, "And they were all amazed at the power of God." Now that phrase, the power of God, we have the power of God and the word of his power. But that phrase, the power of God, those three words, that phrase does does only appear in the New Testament. There's no place in the Old Testament where you have those three words put together. The power power of God. And of course, I think that that is significant because Jesus Christ was the word made flesh and God used the word made flesh to demonstrate his power. So it was the power of his word. And so this this phrase now has some meaning to us because I I want to take this slowly just to begin with because I have some statements that I want you to think about. God cannot increase in power. &gt;&gt; And God cannot decrease in power. God is absolute. absolute in his wisdom, absolute in his power. He's absolute in his attributes. He cannot diminish in mercy. He cannot diminish in love. He cannot diminish in any attribute and he neither can he increase in them. God is absolute. We agree with that. I'm sure that you do. Now the only thing we could say is that God has set certain laws in place that either control these attributes or control this power and or gives access to the power. He can say this is how you can have access to it and I will not regard anything else. Or you can access my power this way for this season. God arbitrarily can change that access and say now it's this way. I'm going to allow you to access this power by through just mercy. The Bible says God keeps covenant and mercy. There are his chosen way to access say his power and his mercy or his his uh healing power. His his chosen way is through the covenant through the word. God said it and I believe it and that's all finished now. That's his chosen way. But there are some who are of little faith. Some don't have hardly any faith. But they cry out to God and cry out to God, "Have mercy. Have mercy on me." And then God keeps mercy. &gt;&gt; And he allows that as an avenue, as an access to his power. So God, he's sovereign. He can, he can determine how his power will be administered, how his mercy will be administered. And there was a time when he had administered it uh without a prophet prior to Moses. Then it came with Moses and he ministered it through the prophets. And then it came the Lord Jesus Christ. He ministered it through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ departed and said, "Now it'll be through you. It's through the church." And then the church got all messed up and denominated and got their creeds and traditions and God bypassed them and and he would do it only through his chosen channel. And in the end time he said he would restore the word back once again. &gt;&gt; And so that I just like to have that as a set as a to kind of set some uh basis. Now because God is absolute because his power cannot increase and because his power cannot decrease I will say that his power is always present. You will perhaps you that have been listening to the services over the last number of weeks uh you'll pick up on I have a bit of a theme. Forgiveness is always here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's always here. Mercyy's always present. His power is always present. But it's just that we don't access it. Sometimes I his presence is here, but we don't we're not we're not we're not recognizing of it. And uh and so and God is always present because God fills all time and space. We can't do away with that statement. God fills all time and space. God can't be any more present. God can't go up and can't go down whatever more he can. He can show himself as Jesus was here and Jesus departed from them and went up. But God didn't go any place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That manifestation of God. You understand? I think it's an important thing that we settle in our minds that God's not gone off someplace. &gt;&gt; He's not off some distant place. We don't have to bring him down. We don't have to call him up. He is here present with us. The only thing is that we we need to become conditioned by the word of God and by faith and by our own our own uh spiritual awareness. We have to give oursel to that. And Satan's job is to get you fully occupied, get your mind occupied, get your thoughts and everything just consumed with everything else. And you simply don't have time. It it does take time to fellowship with God. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, Jesus came and spake unto them. Matthew 28:18. And he said, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." And that's when he said, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations. All power is given me in heaven and in earth. In John 7:46, the offers uh off the officers answered when they heard the words of Jesus and they saw his power demonstrated. They said, "Never man spake like this man." And proverbs by Solomon, who is the wisest of men, said, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof." I want to just launch out by saying I seriously doubt that anyone here or within the sound of my voice realizes the power that they actually possess &gt;&gt; and the power of the tongue, &gt;&gt; the power of their words. I really doubt that we realize and can grasp the extent of that. I felt some inspiration in the last few days. Some special inspiration I felt and I wrote this and I'm going to it's not profound but uh it it kind of embodies where I want to go. Perhaps more than at any time in history, the world is filled with words. And I've simply titled this world of words. If the sound waves were open to our hearing, it would be a tower of babel once again on a grand scale. Then if it were possible to make an analysis of all these words, most would be without value. Much of it would have to do with the necess necessary issues of this life. However, lastly, there would remain the words of God spoken under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Words echoing throughout the vast reaches of time and space, repeated over and over by countless voices. These words cannot pass away but in fact they evolve and morphe from the sounds of words into a living form not found not bound by time or other limitations. These words of God are indestructible. Paul said, "The fashion of this world passeth away." &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away." &gt;&gt; So now we have a distinction here. The fashion of this world shall pass away. &gt;&gt; But there are words that shall not pass away. And I suggest to you that those words do indeed evolve. They are transformed from mere words into a living event into a living. They become embodied in people that God has intended that these words will be embodied in and those persons repeat the same word that God spoke and those words never pass away. Amen. &gt;&gt; And those who speak them shall never pass away. &gt;&gt; It's not just repeating and becoming repetitious and pariting the Bible. It's more than that. It is God with his initial intent coming and dwelling in a person by his spirit. And that person being not merely convinced but actually becoming one with the word that they have received. And thus that word now becomes an event &gt;&gt; in the message. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And incidentally, some of these things will be profoundly simple. And I think that's where we miss it. In Christ is the mystery of God revealed. Brother Brandham simply said, "Talk nice about one another and say nice things about one another." It's not only what we say, but it's who we say it to. The power of the tongue, life and death lay in the power of the tongue. Jesus said, "And whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man, it shall be forgiven him." That's right. &gt;&gt; But whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. &gt;&gt; The power that is in the word, you cannot circumvent or make that mean something else. It is exactly what it is. And the prophet took it and said to speak against what the Holy Ghost has done because this is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. what the Holy Ghost has done in this age and through that messenger uh the the supernatural which was not a man could be nothing less than God himself using a redeemed instrument and bringing forth and showing demonstrating vindicating confirming proving and speaking to speak against that will not be forgiven &gt;&gt; neither in this world or the world to come and Think about now the power of the word at just an individual at just a tongue like you have and now can form certain words and say things that are that are go out into the space and out into time and are not forgiven by God. And so in this age of people's rights, which is a Leodysian age, this age of people's rights, it's a time when people feel at perfect liberty just to say whatever they want to say, to say whoever they want to say it to, to say it about whoever they want to talk about, and say whatever their mind uh, you know, wants to generate. All I can say is that we are either perpetuating life or we're bringing death. &gt;&gt; One or the other. Or it could just be perhaps some wasteful wasteful conversation, which a lot of it is. On the other hand, I'm using this on a natural basis for just a few moments. On the other hand, there if we think for a moment that we're going to pass through life without having criticism, without attracting all kinds of nasty things being said about you and being said behind your back. If you think that we're going to pass through life without that, you are sadly mistaken. We are not only going to receive that, but we're to expect that. Jesus said, "Beware when all men speak well of you." Now, the only thing we want to beware of ourselves is that we don't uh that we don't bring it upon ourselves. Uh but if those that live godly shall suffer persecution and it's not that we go out trying to find it, but you will people will misunderstand you and people will say uh nasty things about you, but we must not allow ourselves to be adversely affected when those things are spoken. We when they're said, we should say like the prophet said, "Well, you know, that that's all right. that doesn't mean anything. That just had to be it' be wonderful just to be able to take that attitude. &gt;&gt; Now if you know this is very very essential for a church because uh people today feel as I said and they do I do not want you to leave this service and forget this message today because it is something that's very deep on my heart. Uh talk is cheap and talk not only comes cheap but it's it it is either going to be productive. It's either going to advance somebody or it's going to degrade them and it's going to uh uh you know uh shall I say it can bring them into a into a state of uh being discouraged or you can encourage people and uh I'm going to I I I'm going to labor on this for a little bit but this is not the whole substance of my of my service. If what others say are untrue, if what someone says is untrue, let them be responsible for it. &gt;&gt; But why should it affect you? I always feel that if someone brings some kind of a accusation or says something about you as an individual and you will hear it, oh well I I heard this or I heard that. As soon as you respond to that or allow that to affect you, you are lowering yourself to that level. &gt;&gt; I this person wants to say something or that church wants to say something more and they've said nasty things about about the message and about the ministers of the message and about the believers of the message and whatever more. But but now for believer to believer, we are to be in support of one another. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that? We are to be in support of one another at every possible junction, every opportunity. We want to be strengthening one another. And we also want to be living a life that is not drawing fire. &gt;&gt; We don't want to. If somebody says, "Well, somebody says I'm sloughing off." Well, if you are sloughing off, sharpen up. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Well, that's true. I haven't been living where I'm supposed to be living, and I accept that." certainly have a right to say that even though it does trouble me. Well, then the thing to do is to live so that you're not drawing that kind of a criticism. That kind of criticism might be healthy. &gt;&gt; Say, well, that is that is so I I heard this kind of rumble and I heard that this was said and so on so forth. Furthermore, it's actually true. I have not been just what I should be. I haven't been. And uh but on the other hand, regardless, I think the best position for a believer is not to respond. It's just not to respond because all kinds of things will forever be said. But it is for us as believers. I want to impose upon you today that the power of life and death is in your tongue. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible has said. And it's an incredible power that is invested within the believer. In fact, is so much so that it's impossible for me to convey it and impossible for you to grasp it. the things that God has said in the word of God. &gt;&gt; The devil, he's an expert at magnifying things to produce a negative effect upon God's people. Brother Brennham said in a message expectation, keep your eyes on the end. Jesus coming. What will it be then? Now, if I asked for you to raise your hands, I'm not going to do so. But if I asked for you to raise your hands, how many plan to go to heaven? whatever heaven means to you, uh, however you've been taught, whatever your understanding is, but I can tell you heaven is certainly a different place than what you live in right now. &gt;&gt; And I want to go there. &gt;&gt; I plan to go there. &gt;&gt; And I want to live here as though I plan to go there. Right? &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying you need to keep your eyes on that goal &gt;&gt; because if you look too close around you, &gt;&gt; he said, furthermore, no matter what people say about you now and how you're persecuted, for all that live godly in Christ shall suffer persecution, being made fun of and mocked and so forth. But watch what it will be at the end. That's what where it'll pay off. &gt;&gt; That's what we're concerned about. It doesn't matter what people say about you at this time. What does that mean? That's irrelevant. &gt;&gt; You have your eyes on the ultimate goal, and that's how you should live. Live now with that ultimate goal always in mind. He said, "But watch what it will be at the end. That's what that's where it'll really pay off. and just hold steady and keep your eye on the end. He said that'll be good for you. I love the simplicity. That'll be good for you. You keep your eye on the end and don't worry what people say about you. Now I find that what things that are perhaps said are sometimes said in ignorance because uh I I'd like you to make aware make you aware of something. Not that you haven't thought of it. Not that this is some great deep truth but it's very very important. Sometimes you can hear something about someone and they failed God or they slipped or they fell spiritually, whatever more, and by the time someone else picks it up and repeats it to another person, it's already been forgiven and washed under the blood of Jesus Christ, and it's long gone, &gt;&gt; and God can't even find it, but some person can. Then what kind of a state do we put ourselves in when we what power have we uh taken to ourselves to bring up something that the blood of Jesus Christ I don't want you to ever forget this &gt;&gt; that the blood of Jesus Christ has already forgiven &gt;&gt; and it has already been confessed and when it was confessed that drop of ink dropped into the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ. And the prophet said that the properties, these are my words now, but the properties, the very chemistry of the ink dissipates into the bleach and you can't find it. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, it can never come back to be ink again. &gt;&gt; In other words, that sin when it's forgiven by a confession, it can never become sin again. That is a powerful statement. It can never be. How many of your sins have been washed away, my friends? How many of your sins and your background have been washed away? It can never be sin again. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; It can never be a failure again. &gt;&gt; It can never come to the surface again because the very chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ has dispensed and dispersed it. In fact is he says the ink becomes the bleach. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You talk about powerful. That's powerful. What's a confession? What's a confession? Words. &gt;&gt; Words. Just words. The power of life and death are in the tongue. And the tongue says, "Father, forgive me." &gt;&gt; And your sin and the darkness of your iniquity passes into the blood of Jesus Christ and cannot be found again. That's power. That's incredible power. &gt;&gt; Think of it in the spoken word, the original seed. Brother Bram said, "Someone came the other day and said somebody had said something bad about me and accused me of something that was wrong." Now, brother Brandham said three words. This person came to the prophet of God and said, "This is what certain certain person has said about you." And now it wasn't true in this case. It was actually wrong. And now the prophet has a response. Would you like to know what the response is? I would say it's a good example for your response. &gt;&gt; Oh, forget it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that deep? &gt;&gt; Isn't that profound? I tell you, it's a revelation you all need. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation we all need. &gt;&gt; Three words. Oh, forget it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't it nice? I'm just preaching a simple message this morning, &gt;&gt; but it's deeper than a lot of us have ever gone. &gt;&gt; So he said, "Oh, forget it." He said, and the man responds, "How can you take it like that? That involves your family." So it wasn't just Brother Brandham, it involved his family, this accusation. How can you take it like that? And I said, "Oh my." I said that was predestinated before the foundation of the world to give me a trial. What he's really saying is this is a blessing. &gt;&gt; This is a blessing to me because it was predestinated to give me a trial. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something, friends. laying here is one of the greatest secrets that a Christian could ever have is how to handle and deal with these kind of things. People go sideways. People go downhill. People give up. People get all discouraged. Say, "Well, this one said this about me and that one said that about me." I've got the prophet's answer for. Forget it. &gt;&gt; Forget it. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, but they you don't know how nasty it is. Forget it. It's just been a predestinated trial. Just forget it. &gt;&gt; He said, and they and the other gentleman said, "How do you do it?" And I said, "If I look right down this if I look right down this way, I'd be falling all the time." In other words, let me interpret it for you. It's not going to stop. You're always going to hear something. You're always going to have statements being made. You're going to hear things and and if and if you're going to just look here, and that's why I give the other quote, "Where are you supposed to be looking? You're supposed to be looking at the objective. You're looking at where you're going." He said, "Look at the end." And that'll hold you steady. You just keep looking at the end. I want us to have this congregation agree with me that you are you're determined to do that. I'm looking at the end. I'm not going to look here, you know, this little family matter and that little thing here and what my peers said and what my friend said at school or what what my fellow said at the at the uh uh you know at the workplace or what the lady said on the telephone, whatever more. It's not going to end. &gt;&gt; And if you do that, you're going to be falling all the time. You just get up over this and say, "Oh, I got victory over this now." Oh, and you know, somebody said, "I'm sorry, da da da." And and next time you're going to run into it again. You'll be falling all the time. But the one the one that's an absolute victory, it says, "Oh, this came my way." Says, "Oh, forget it." &gt;&gt; That one comes broing in from that way. Oh, just forget it. &gt;&gt; If I look down here, I'm going to be falling all the time. Oh, just forget it. That's just a predestinated trial. And it makes no difference to what degree or intensity or how terrible or how horrible. It couldn't get bad enough. They couldn't say enough bad things you got victory over it because you just got the phrase, "Well, forget it." &gt;&gt; And sometimes it can cut you so deep and hurt you so bad you don't know if you're going to survive. But if you take this attitude, oh, just forget it. You say, "Oh, brother Bisco, we came here for something a whole lot deeper than that." Listen, I'm going to give you something that you'll have victory this week over. This is something you can put into practice tomorrow morning. &gt;&gt; He says, and once again, he said, "Look out here to the end of the road. A man who looks like this, that is down here, he doesn't know where he's going. He's looking this way. But if you look out yonder, &gt;&gt; you don't care what's going on now. &gt;&gt; You know where you're going. &gt;&gt; And that's it. Look where you're going. Stay lined up with the word. So, it's impossible, as I said a moment ago, for us to go through life without uh criticisms of some sort or some sharp thing said about us. But Jesus said, "Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you." For so did their fathers to the false prophets. For so did their fathers to the false prophets spoke well. So we are well instructed what to do and what not to do. Now David, I'm going to read a a portion of Psalms here. David said in the Psalms, "Mine enemies speak evil of me." "Mine enemies speak evil of me." This is Psalms 41, starting at verse 5. "Mine enemies speak evil of me. When shall he die, and his name perish? And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity. His heart gatherth iniquity to itself. When he goeth abroad, he tellth it. All that hate me, whisper together against me. Against me do they devise my hurt. All and an and evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him. And now he that lith he shall rise up no more. I just want your attention for a moment. Can you grasp what these enemies were saying? of David himself that they whisper together. So there wasn't just one against me and against me do they devise my hurt and they say that evil cleaves to him. They say that and now he lith and he shall not rise up anymore. In other words, he's finished. See, he's finished. They're not going to rise up anymore. And that's the message that had come through to David. And he said, he went on further and he said, "Yay, my mine own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat my bread, they ate together. They went to McDonald's together. They were over at, you know, what's her name?" the Dutch mothers &gt;&gt; in Lynden. They ate together. &gt;&gt; They were together. And he said, "And which did eat my bread." So they were over at his house hath lifted up his heel against me. said if if it been he said if it been my enemy that'd been one thing but it was my friend &gt;&gt; my familiar friend and we went and ate together and we had fellowship together and he was at my place and ate my bread now the reason why I am speaking this you might say well is brother B is brother Biscll dealing with some problem in the church not not that any that I know I just feel this is on my heart because actually I'm going to another direction we're going to have to turn a sharp corner and might do it in another service. But this is so vital. This is so important because I am interested in the strongest possible spiritual body of people for I'm jealous over the bride of Jesus Christ. And if you take and put this into practice, you're going to be a powerhouse in your home, in your family, in the church of God, because you will be beyond offense. And we really need to be, we can't wear our nerves, you know, uh h and have them right on the on the top of our our our flesh as it were, hanging out here with uh all the sensitivities of what this one thinks and what that one said and what this one did and that one, you know, and I feel, you know, I I I feel uncomfortable. I feel intimidated. I feel that they don't want me. Da da da on and on and on. That's always going to be. &gt;&gt; And we as believers, we far from us, we should say, "Far be it from me to be that one who's a familiar friend who would lift up my heel." But I want you to know that those words can exit our mouths that can be extremely hurtful. And these things should not be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Not amongst believers. In other words, to say what should I say? Nice things. &gt;&gt; That you say that's your prophet. He said say nice things. &gt;&gt; Do you know anything nice? That's what you want to say. What would you like to hear? You know, someone came and met him and somebody had got up and gave him a compliment and said, "I really enjoyed that service." And someone else came up and I, "Oh, brother Brandham, I really enjoyed that service. I was so blessed by that sermon this morning and so on and so forth and a man met him. He heard these two two persons say that and he met him and he and this man says he says uh I I don't believe you know he that uh person ought to have nice things said about them like that boast on them like that. Brother Bam said, "Well, the only difference between us is I'm I'm being truthful. I do. &gt;&gt; I do." What he was telling is that the other man's not being truthful, but he said it in a nice way. The only difference is I'm being truthful about it. I like to have nice things said. All of us like to have nice things said about us. We'd like to have say, "Well, that's you know, honey, that's the best pie in in the world. I just that's the greatest pie. That's the greatest dinner or something else." Or, you know, just some little thing. And we like to have nice things said. &gt;&gt; Of course we do. And if you don't like this service when I leave, don't say anything to me. Just walk out and shake my hand. At least smile. &gt;&gt; Say nice things. &gt;&gt; He didn't only say it once. He said it over and over. &gt;&gt; All right. No one's going to go through life without having that experience. and uh and perhaps the one that you thought was the closest is the one that may uh really disappoint you the most. Now I I return to the scripture where we said uh who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. And just before I do, I'm going to I I'm going to give you the whole quote. Uh I have it on the screen and I'm going to give you the whole quote. Uh we'll probably what we'll do is just go go through it completely. Now, uh Now I want to go to the first one please. Second the first one up here. We can read it together. Who being the brightness of his glory, the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. This Hebrews 1 and3 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that live it shall eat the fruit thereof. Now this is the beginning of this quote and I have broken it down into statements one after the other and so I didn't want to leave really anything out of it. Brother Bram starts out by saying you've got tapes on what we believe. You got tapes on discipline in the church. How we behave ourselves in the church. How we got to come here together and set together in heavenly places. Set together where? &gt;&gt; Heavenly places. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I can't believe a person comes and sits in heavenly places and then goes out and there's just, oh, some some of it's worthless chatter. That'll just dissipate anyway. But I wouldn't want you to bring condemnation upon yourself by saying or speaking something about someone else, another brother or sister or whoever, minister or deacon or whatever. Uh, we we wouldn't want you to I'm trying to protect you from that. how we got to come together in heavenly places. He said, "Don't stay at home." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't feel that way, then I tell you it's time to you got to praying cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching. &gt;&gt; To love one another with Christian love &gt;&gt; and divine love. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; To love one another with Christian love and divine love. Listen friends, you'll never have a more vindicated instruction than you're getting right this moment &gt;&gt; to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another. And by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you love one another. Jesus said in John 13 and35 said that's right stay right together. Didn't say stay apart. &gt;&gt; Stay together. &gt;&gt; Now you may have some friends that you feel closer to than others, but that doesn't mean that every brother and sister should have a place in your heart. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. If the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister, say, "Lord, don't let me ever have the root of bitterness spring up cuz it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life." Isn't that incredible? &gt;&gt; That poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred, that'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you. It'll run him from the tabernacle here. It'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here, hurt your pastor. It'll do everything. Don't you do that. &gt;&gt; You just wax that much closer. Now he's he's he's described uh he's actually described a scenario uh in the earlier part. Now he's coming with the remedy. &gt;&gt; The remedy for that kind of a scenario. And the remedy is you just wax that much closer together. Take the buckle that buckles on the whole armor of God and just put it on. Tighten up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Move right up close to one another. You know, I could stop right there. Love one another. There may be some that you hardly ever fellowship with or hardly ever get close to. It might be good to kind of break the, you know, the tradition that you have and actually mingle with someone else &gt;&gt; that you haven't been near &gt;&gt; and get to know them and get to feel their spirit and get to be with them. I think that that would be good. And love one another anyhow. You know the word anyhow. It's amazing. I don't know if you read the message like I do, but when he says love them, love one another anyhow, it indicates to me there could be some reason not to not to have that kind of feeling. But love them anyhow. &gt;&gt; It's more like a Wednesday night, isn't it? Talk nice about one another. This is the remedy. Talk nice about one another. Say nice things about one another. You just wax that much closer. Said take the buckle the buckles. Move right up close to one another. I guess talk nice one another. Say nice things to one another. And then there's the last line. And then let's say it together. God will bless you. Oh, &gt;&gt; father in heaven, bless me. &gt;&gt; Have you ever said that? God, bless me. &gt;&gt; And maybe what God is actually answering back is say, "How about saying nice things?" &gt;&gt; The prophet didn't say, "God will bless you. Say nice things about one another." He said, "Say say one say nice things about one another and then God will bless you. You going to try it this week? &gt;&gt; Going to try it today. &gt;&gt; Just go out and start saying nice things about one another, good things about them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right, we're over that part. &gt;&gt; You can breathe easy now. We're over that part. Can I have another few minutes? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power. Now, we're just going to take right angles for a few moments and I'll probably have to finish this at another time. Not the power of his word, but the word of his power. The I'd like you to see the power of God as a great reservoir. Just a great vast reservoir. That's his power. But now he has he has determined in his sovereign mind and will that he will send out a word that is authorized to demonstrate this power. &gt;&gt; Think about it. It'll be the word of his power. It'll be the authority by which the power is exercised &gt;&gt; and it will be that individual or individuals or whoever that has that access to that power. Now he says he's upholding all things. I need to take you just move you in if you'll stay with me please. very close in your hold hold your minds right up tight to the message if you would. He said upholding all things by the word of his power. And the upholding is that it's not just, you know, I'm I'm I'm upholding this this pullpit. No, upholding is that he's actually moving it. is to take take a hold of something and moving it and bearing it carrying it and moving it moving it from one junction to another from one point to another from point A to point B or shall I say in this reference he's upholding all things by the word of his power he's moving and as far as we're here concerned this morning he's moving mortals he's bearing them carrying them from mortal to immortality. He's taking us from a hellridden uh society, from something that's filled with impurities and violence and filth and injustice of every kind. He's moving us upholding it. How? How? How? By the word of his power. He's moving them from one point to another, from one place to another by the word of his power. The power is there, but he's got to give you the word to move you from that place or this place to another. &gt;&gt; Have you followed that? &gt;&gt; He's carrying you, burying you. In the Ephesians, the message Ephesians parallels Joshua. He said that's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church. The church positionally before the foundation of the world. He said when God, now I'm I'm I'm I'm still on this on on this thought of upholding you, burying you. He said when God in his labor pain, have you ever thought of God being in a labor pain? When God in his labor pain was bringing forth you &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do he position he knew you'd repent when the word came by. &gt;&gt; He knew that you would say Lord Jesus forgive me. &gt;&gt; He knew you would agree with the word and say I have sinned and come short of the glory of God. He knew one day you would say that trinitarian doctrine not in the scripture. I'm being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He knew you would come into alignment into an agreement with his word. And he knew you would repeat what he said. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the key &gt;&gt; to repeat what he said because once once you repeat what he said by the same spirit, that spirit of God when he sent that spirit into you and you repeated it and that spirit came to you and began to reveal it to you and you spoke it then then it went out into the airwaves, the eternal airwaves and now now it's there forever recorded and you have said the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus said it. &gt;&gt; Isn't it marvelous? Jesus said it and now you said it. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If we had the instruments and they tell me that we could be able to do it scientifically is to draw the very voice and hear Moses speak and hear Jesus speak." Wouldn't it be marvelous one day to discover that all of your denying and all of your evil things actually have been have been annihilated by the power of the blood of Jesus Christ. And the only thing that came through the filter is the things that Jesus said and you said. &gt;&gt; The things the prophet said and you said it. &gt;&gt; You think that's a fairy tale? That's exactly what it is. Exactly the truth. &gt;&gt; This isn't a fairy tale. This isn't a myth. &gt;&gt; My words today are going out and I cannot draw them back. They're going out. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad they are. &gt;&gt; I'm glad they're recorded. &gt;&gt; And the brother Brandham says that in the judgment, he says, "You you don't have to be judged. You will hear your own words. &gt;&gt; You'll hear your own voice. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be something if they had a court of law? And when we think of all the twisting and the conniving and and all the things that are untrue, which are being declared in courts of law, wouldn't it be marvelous if they had the equipment said, "Just a second. We're going to flick enter here and we're going to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; We're actually going to hear what you said. Wouldn't that be something? &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; But God in his labor pain because he was bringing you forth. He was upholding you. That was his and the and the purpose for it was that he might present you the scripture says faultless. &gt;&gt; I know we're sitting here in a Sunday morning service but God's intent. I don't know what moved you to come to the service today. What caused you to be here or whoever is on the internet and caused you connect but God wants you to hear this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to demonstrate to you the word of his power. &gt;&gt; Not the power of his word, but the word of his power. &gt;&gt; He wants to give you access to that power. If you ever h have if you have something that's unforgiven, don't let it hang here. Unforgiven. Drop that thing. How? With your mouth by confession. I did wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Incidentally, friends, &gt;&gt; just to say I'm sorry is not enough. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry is not repentance. &gt;&gt; If I offended you, that's not enough. That's not what we're talking about. Is to say so, well then what is it? Is to say I did wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I sinned against you and I sinned against God. I did wrong. The word of God says I mustn't do that and I want forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Then it's confessed. &gt;&gt; That's the only way. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And he that the whole thought is to present you faultless. Amen. &gt;&gt; Apostle Paul said, "I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy, for I've espoused you to one husband that I may present you a chasteed virgin." He said in Colossians, "In the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight." And in Jude, Jude said, "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy." &gt;&gt; So what God has promised, he's more than able to perform. &gt;&gt; Now just for the next few moments and I'm going to close because I just will I will like to introduce where I'll go the next time, the Lord willing. And that is to uh to profess or to confess. And the scripture says he is the high priest of your profession or the prophet says it's identical to confession. And if you look it up, it is your profession or your confession. I won't give you the quotes right now. Perhaps I'll next time I'll be able to do it. We've had them here before. He actually said that he doesn't move. &gt;&gt; Christ as high priest doesn't move &gt;&gt; about the power of your word &gt;&gt; until you confess it &gt;&gt; in another realm that you can't see. You talk about the word of his power. Now, here's the reservoir of power. Here's forgiveness. Here's healing. Here's all the attributes of God. Here's everything you're going to need &gt;&gt; from here to eternity. And it hinges on what comes out of your mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And here's the living Christ at the right hand of the majesty on high, ready to move, waiting for your confession. And if a person says one thing one time, now excuse the little uh uh maybe juvenile type of example, but if a child comes up, you know, you take them into a toy store. You take a child into a toy store and they say something, "Oh, buy me this. I want this." And then they forget in just a moment and you go on down. Oh, they want this, they want that. And it doesn't take long for you to decide they don't know what they want. You know, next thing they're just walking out of the store and they say an ice cream cone in the store went, "Oh, I want an ice cream cone." &gt;&gt; So, they don't know what they want. &gt;&gt; You know, God's kids are that way. &gt;&gt; One day we say, "Oh, Lord, I need this. I need that." Next day, we've forgotten all about that. Now, I need something else. &gt;&gt; He just kind of wait till we settle down, &gt;&gt; till we know what we really want. But when we come and and we've got to focus on what we want and the focus on what we need. &gt;&gt; And so the profession is and here's what it is to confess. And I want to I'm just going to convey this now. I'm going to be done in about another five minutes. to confess and you've heard us say it before and actually the Greek terminology is this is to say the same thing as another. &gt;&gt; I'd like you to remember that. Write it down. It's to say the same thing as another. There are many many believers of this message who will say I am a believer of this message. I believe that God sent this prophet confirmed message but on the other hand fail to say the same thing that he said when it comes to confession. And I'm going to give you by God's help, not today, the next time. I'm going to give you things that I think you need to repeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things he said that we need to repeat. We need to say it again and again. We need to repeat it over and over. &gt;&gt; How can a person remain depressed? Have you ever found where the prophet said, I believe we should say we're depressed. &gt;&gt; I'm so stressed out. &gt;&gt; Like one person said, that's Paul's letter to Deuteronomy. It doesn't exist. I'm so stressed out. I'm so this. And we go on and on. I think I'll throw in the towel. I can't go another day. Thus says who? &gt;&gt; You're not repeating. And all that's gone into the air and it all is out there. But it it it's it's not any of the words of God. You're not repeating God's word. It is actually worthless chatter, but it's being destructive to yourself. &gt;&gt; You're defeating your own purpose. totally defeating your own purpose. Can this congregation say amen? &gt;&gt; That's where I want to go. &gt;&gt; Because now, and here it is. I'm closing with this. We didn't before this message come, we didn't know what to repeat. &gt;&gt; We didn't have anything worthy to repeat. People read the Bible but that there was no witness of the Holy Spirit of the truth and the reality of it. And then when a when a prophet come and the message is vindicated, thus saith the Lord, then for the first time you can say, "Thanks be to God. I got something I can repeat." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An apostle Paul is saying by the confession of your mouth by the profession and the word is simply say the same thing as another person said &gt;&gt; and they said and if he said thus sayeth the lord you have such and such a disease you come from such and such a place and so on and the person saying it's true it's true it's true that's fine then the next thing is comes to comes to the scripture &gt;&gt; and the scripture says he's drawing out a bride &gt;&gt; and this bride is a virgin bride and this bride is a spotless bride. Those are things worthy of repeating. [Music] &gt;&gt; With a sense I am included. &gt;&gt; I am part of this company. &gt;&gt; He said he come to an elect group to the elect lady that Paul wrote about. You say the elect lady. The elect lady. &gt;&gt; I'm part of that group because he called me. I'm part of the elect lady. &gt;&gt; Soon as you start feeling say I'm so stressed out. Change it. &gt;&gt; Say I'm part of the elect lady. &gt;&gt; Isn't that a whole lot better? &gt;&gt; I'm so despondent. I I think I need some anti-depressant. You need some gospels is what you need. We finally had we finally had uh some words now come the confirmed words by God himself that were worthy of repeating. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. I said I was a minister before I met brother Bradom. I was a minister and I didn't I had to baptize five people. I didn't know how to baptize them. One of them was Sister Cindy Bergen's dad. He was a deacon in our church and had to baptize him. I asked somebody, "Have you, do you know how brother Vandom baptizer? Do you ever know what he said?" We didn't have any tape or any any word on it at all. I mean, nothing. I said, "You know, I got to baptize these people." I had good friends who says, "It's Jesus name only." Just Jesus name. Here's the scripture. Here's this. Here's Okay. His name Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You don't do them. Father, Son, Holy Ghost. You're disobeying Jesus. I don't want to disobey Jesus. In the book of Acts, they did it in the name of the Lord. In the name of the Lord. Goodness. The name of the Lord. Got three recipes. Some says three times down went to South Africa. Said bury them for every time they every time you can remember a sin. They almost almost drowned one guy. They did. In fact, it was Sister Linda Marissa's dad that went down and says, "You're going to drown him." That every time he came up, he'd remember another sin. And so, what was I going to do? What are you going to repeat? What are you going to say? And finally, you have thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I heard I read it the other day. He said, "If you've never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you've never been baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." Because the Lord Jesus Christ is the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Oh, didn't that come simple? Now, that's why we can go to the water all the time and repeat it. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad since then, I've been repeating it. [Applause] Well, I hope you take some of this meat and potatoes. &gt;&gt; Sister Cindy Bergen's dad, she's a little bit like him, but he's even worse and he's big and tall and muscular and the water is ice cold. If it hadn't been flowing, I think it would have been frozen. Brother, you know the river Kiss Catnel River. I said, uh, and the water's muddy and flowing and cold. We set up two tents for the sister and the brothers to change her clothes. And so I I had I had to scheme this thing out. So I figured I got to put these and all them one was about 6'6 and I have to put all these fellas, three of them over about 6'2. Had to put them down the water. So I I figure out my mind I'm going to lay them down upstream. So when I lift them up, Brother Randy, I have the stream to help me. And then I had another idea to make it even easier. I'm going to have these tall fellas kneel down in the water and it just be a little dip for me. So Tommy was the first one, Sister Cindy Bergen's dad. I said, and I just said to him, "Now, Brother Tommy, I'm going to baptize you upstream." So, I have the stream to help me. And we're going down to the water. And he says, "When I said, when we get down there, I want you to kneel." Oh, no. No. He says, "You're going all the way with me." He said, I said, "No." I said, "It'll make it a lot easier for me, Tommy, if you just It make a lot easier if you'll just kneel down." And he was a strong man. He worked on the heavy equipment. He put his fingers in my arm right here. And he was right behind me. And he just kept moving me right into the river. I wasn't leading him. He was actually carrying me in the water till I started to become buoyant. And I said, "Tommy, is it far this far? Not this far." He only had to go in the water once. I had to go in there five times. I went in one color and I came out purple. It was cold. But you know, God heard me &gt;&gt; because I finally I had found out what I was supposed to repeat over those people. I was able to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And someday &gt;&gt; we'll hear those words again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They'll never be lost. &gt;&gt; Glad you're baptized, Brother Roger. You're glad you're baptized in his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we are so grateful. Our hearts are filled with a with a gratitude and a thanksgiving &gt;&gt; that you have given us, oh God, a clear path &gt;&gt; and a very clear sound, a voice that was so confirmed, so vindicated. and we're unashamed, oh God, of the word that you have given us. We thank you for it. I pray that you'll take these words that have been spoken today and these experiences and you'll make it a blessing to the people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. For your glory, I ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is it all right? &gt;&gt; Thank you for your prayers. I was able to preach this morning. Uh, I wonder, brother Rod, if you could come and help us with a song if you would please. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy it. &gt;&gt; You got power in your words, friends. Absolutely. I hope you take it to heart to such a degree that it'll just be a seal upon your lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just stand to our feet. I'd like to just sing the song that we sang at the start. Father in heaven, &gt;&gt; just lift it up now. &gt;&gt; Father in heaven, we love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. We lift your name above all the earth. Oh, let your kingom be established in our praises as your people declare your mighty word. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. who is and to God. Blessed be the Lord mighty who lives forever. [Music] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the Lord God. Bless blessed beord mighty who was and is to bless the mighty [Music] who lives forever. ever. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to bow our heads, going to do business. I'm sure that every honest heart, every honest person would say, you know, Brother Ed, before God and in the presence of the Holy Spirit, I certainly have uttered things out from my mouth that I'm sorry I have. I really am sorry. And and God, you have spoken to me today. You've used this these simple truths. You've used these quotes. You've used these scriptures. And I want to drop this ink into the bleach at this moment. I want to drop it in. And the only way I can drop it in is make a confession. And I'm taking this time now, Lord. I'm taking this moment. And to you precious believers, my brothers and sisters, I'll give you that opportunity. We can just pray together. And I'm going to pray. I believe that God will bless you immensely for acting upon the word of God as the Holy Spirit is uh urging you to do so. Father, and I I I trust the people, you're not ashamed now. Just be open about it. Lord, I pray that you will see us now in this moment. We are now seeking to act. And not only seeking to act, we are acting upon your word. And Lord, I like all others have spoken things and uttered things I'm ashamed of. I don't want to say those things. And so I'm asking just now you'll take them as I confess them and put it and drop it down into the chemistry of the blood of Jesus Christ. And every sin I don't have to pray it'll be forgiven. I know it'll be forgiven and I know it'll be broken up. It will be taken us it will be taken and dispensed with. it will be annihilated and it can never never come back into the memory of God again. Father, let there be a mighty cleansing and sweeping throughout the whole audience. And wherever my voice is going or will go in the future, I pray it'll have the same effect. For I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Let the mighty Holy Spirit move and breathe now upon every life, oh God. And show your pleasure, show your good pleasure upon the people by blessing them immensely today for their for not only for their action, but for their obedience, Lord, to the to the compelling of the Holy Spirit and the urging of the Holy Ghost. And father, I pray that you'll bring sweet fellowship that perhaps didn't exist before. That you'll cause, oh God, to people to reverse their pattern and their way of life, uh, reverse their conversation. And, Father, you'll put a check upon it in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray you'll bring such a glory cloud upon the people at the service tonight. Lord, will be a be something where the minister can scarcely preach. Oh God, we want your presence and your nearness. And now I pray you'll go with us. Strengthen us as we dismiss from one another, but we're not dismissed from your presence in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And just before you go, I want to sing pleasing. It's been one of my favorite courses, pleasing. And I trust that's exactly the word that's on your heart. Let's lift it up to him, shall we? Pleasing. And then we're all dismissed. Easing [Music] everything. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm praise. [Applause] Everything I worship [Music] you &gt;&gt; just once again. Oh pleasing. Oh, everything you [Music] let But I pray everything I worship you [Music] to. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Why don't you greet one another with a good godly handshake? Say the best thing that you can say. Lord willing, we say this evening. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. [Music]
