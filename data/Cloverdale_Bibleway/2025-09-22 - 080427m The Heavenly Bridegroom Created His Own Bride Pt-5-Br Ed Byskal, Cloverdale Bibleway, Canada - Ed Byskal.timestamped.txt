[17:42] your family as we sing it again? Oh, see
[17:45] the bright light shine.
[17:48] This is just
[17:52] where I can see my
[17:59] world.
[18:03] I'm ready for deliverance.
[18:07] Lord, I've never been this whole sick
[18:11] before
[18:12] [Music]
[18:16] and the church of God is growing.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. My goodness.
[18:23] Boys, boys, boys.
[18:26] Looks like that's some of our lots in
[18:28] life.
[18:30] Little pink things don't seem to be our
[18:32] lot. This morning we have a baby
[18:34] dedication of Aaron Michael words. So
[18:37] just another soldier to this great army
[18:40] of the living God. Amen.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; We read often certain scriptures maybe
[18:47] making reference um to the names of the
[18:50] children. This morning I'm reading a
[18:53] scripture that the Bible says this in
[18:56] Matthew 19 and 13:14 and 15. Says, "When
[19:01] then they were brought unto him little
[19:03] children that he should put his hands on
[19:07] them, pray and the disciples rebuked
[19:11] them."
[19:12] But Jesus said, "Suffer the little
[19:15] children and forbid them not to come
[19:18] unto me, for such is the kingdom of
[19:21] heaven."
[19:23] &gt;&gt; And he laid the hands on them,
[19:27] &gt;&gt; and they thus departed. Well, I'm just
[19:30] so thankful that we have parents
[19:33] that are able to look to the word of God
[19:36] and say, "Bible times are here again. I
[19:40] want my children blessed. I want my
[19:42] children dedicated. We do not have water
[19:45] baptism for our babies because we don't
[19:48] see them in the word. But we see where
[19:50] they took their children, took them to
[19:52] the Lord. And we believe in baby
[19:55] dedication.
[19:57] We believe in in families. We believe in
[20:00] fatherhood. We believe in motherhood.
[20:03] And standing here, I believe, is is uh a
[20:06] real handmaiden of God, Sister
[20:08] Stephanie.
[20:10] this little baby that you've called
[20:12] Aaron,
[20:13] Michael,
[20:17] to be a mountain of strength and a gift
[20:20] from God. Brother Brandon made special
[20:23] mention
[20:25] of Aaron of Old's mother, Joseette,
[20:29] and said she was a real woman of faith.
[20:33] And she had faith enough
[20:38] to take Moses, which was a gift from
[20:41] God, and put him in the jaws of death.
[20:46] He said, speaking about faith, faith
[20:49] doesn't move. No matter how contrary it
[20:52] looks, faith stays right there. It never
[20:55] moves. When Moses was put in the bull
[20:58] rush and that slimy ark pushed out into
[21:01] the sea of crocodiles that were fed with
[21:04] children, that mother joel with faith
[21:09] and assurance she put that child in the
[21:13] water and pushed him in the jaws of
[21:15] death,
[21:17] &gt;&gt; knowing God would raise him up. Amen.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; May the faith of this mother
[21:24] [Music]
[21:25] &gt;&gt; be rewarded
[21:28] &gt;&gt; in this age that we live in.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; She's taking the word of God and she's
[21:34] claiming it. Oh, he says that makes me
[21:37] feel religious. She knew God would take
[21:40] care of him.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; May God take care of this little Aaron
[21:44] Michael for the glory of God. May he be
[21:47] a mountain of strength
[21:50] &gt;&gt; as we believe that he is a gift from
[21:53] God.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham said that
[21:56] little baby was the sweetest little
[21:58] thing.
[22:00] When brother Brandham took that little
[22:01] baby, he always made mention of their
[22:02] hair.
[22:04] He said look at their hair is just like
[22:06] mine. They hardly have any.
[22:12] And they said, "Isn't he the sweetest
[22:14] little thing?"
[22:16] I say he's a sweet little joy. Amen. God
[22:20] bless you. God bless you, sweetheart.
[22:26] Amen. May God make this man a little man
[22:30] a mountain of strength for the glory of
[22:33] God. Let's pray. Father, with great joy,
[22:37] we take that commission, Lord, that we
[22:39] would suffer the little children to
[22:41] come. this little baby dedication. Lord,
[22:44] you've blessed this home with many
[22:46] children. You've given them four boys
[22:48] now. And Father, cradle in my arm as
[22:50] Aaron Michael. I'm praying, God, that
[22:53] your hand will ever rest on him, Lord,
[22:55] that you'll ever protect him and guide
[22:57] him. And may the same faith of a mother
[23:00] well up within the heart of this son,
[23:02] Lord, as a mother and a daddy would try
[23:05] and desire to raise them up in the
[23:07] admonition of God. teach them in the
[23:09] ways of God and when they grow older
[23:11] they shall not depart. May this child
[23:14] have a love for you at a young age and
[23:17] may father God you ever keep your hand
[23:19] of blessing upon Aaron this morning as
[23:24] we dedicate him back to you for the
[23:26] glory of God. Bless his life. Make Lord
[23:30] Jo Jesus his heart be a joy to his home.
[23:35] And father God we ask your blessing now
[23:38] in Jesus name. Amen.
[23:42] Amen. God bless you Aaron Michael.
[23:46] God bless you. Bless you. Bless your
[23:50] voice.
[24:02] Amen. And our Jonathan Walner has a has
[24:04] a special for us. Come and get ready at
[24:06] this time. We'll sing Born Again.
[24:08] There's really been a change in me.
[24:13] Born again. There's really been a change
[24:18] in me.
[24:21] Oh, born again. Just like Jesus said.
[24:29] Oh yeah.

[24:37] I

[25:13] again.

[25:26] morning. I just can't imagine where I'd
[25:28] be if the Lord had not come by my way.
[25:31] It's just so wonderful to be part of
[25:34] God's chosen people this morning, isn't
[25:36] it?
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[30:51] May 2nd and the 3rd, to help at the

[30:56] a call at the camp office, and just let
[30:58] them know that you'll be able to help,
[31:00] that'd be great.
[31:01] And also forgot to make mention that we

[32:40] [Applause]
[32:43] [Music]
[32:56] because of what the Lord has done
[33:02] for us.
[33:05] Give thanks.
[33:09] Amen.
[33:16] Just need a little power.
[33:19] We need more than electrical power.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost power. Well, I glad to report
[33:25] that we have Holy Ghost power,
[33:28] &gt;&gt; evidence of it.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; We're going to be doing some rejoicing
[33:32] and singing and which we've already done
[33:35] some, but I uh there's a few comments
[33:38] that I want to make and some
[33:40] announcements we need to make.
[33:43] Uh this last week they had a a school
[33:48] function and a science fair that had
[33:53] been done by the students and I think
[33:54] there were over 40 if I recall uh the
[33:58] principal's comments, brother Randy
[34:00] Timberman's and I want to commend uh the
[34:04] students. Uh it was just remarkable over
[34:08] 40 of these uh these examples of uh
[34:14] different scientific research that they
[34:17] had done and then uh concluded by
[34:22] wonderful artwork and uh just a lot of
[34:26] effort had gone into it and each one you
[34:28] know I stopped at several and had them
[34:31] explain what it was and I can tell you I
[34:34] was kind of putting them to the test. I
[34:35] thought maybe their mother and dad did
[34:37] the science project and they kind of,
[34:40] you know, brought the materials or
[34:42] something, but no, they could go through
[34:44] the whole thing and just tell you
[34:46] exactly what was happening and and how
[34:49] it functioned and how one thing reacted
[34:51] on other and and uh then they had a
[34:54] handing out of uh different ceremony at
[34:57] the ceremony uh the different awards
[35:00] that were given. But I just wanted to
[35:02] say to all of the students, I thought
[35:05] that you did a marvelous, marvelous job
[35:09] and uh it was just great to the teachers
[35:12] and to the principal
[35:14] uh brother Randy Timberman's to uh the
[35:18] comments that were made throughout the
[35:20] evening were just really wonderful. Then
[35:23] the volunteers, a lot of people
[35:26] volunteered and did things. And you
[35:28] know, these things are are it's a nice
[35:30] evening, but it doesn't happen by
[35:32] accident. There's a lot of preparation
[35:33] that goes into it. And uh quite frankly,
[35:37] I just am so happy every time I see our
[35:40] young people right from kindergarten.
[35:42] You know, there they were over in the in
[35:45] the library.
[35:47] I remember not very long ago that we
[35:50] were attempting to get 3,000 books. The
[35:53] government requires we have 3,000 books
[35:55] in a library. There's over 7,000 books
[35:58] in the library. And I think that is
[36:01] wonderful. And uh you as a congregation
[36:04] have have supported you have uh
[36:07] purchased books and and uh I just want
[36:10] you to know it's worthwhile. It's all
[36:12] worthwhile. We haven't made it official,
[36:16] but uh I'm going to just uh speak in
[36:18] faith right now. And uh and that is that
[36:22] Lord willing uh and we work is underway
[36:26] right now. The plans are well underway
[36:29] to construct a school building in the
[36:32] corner of the property right at the far
[36:34] corner. And it just worked out. Our
[36:36] brother Kim Dingwall is doing a lot of
[36:39] work working with the school board and
[36:42] uh and everyone is having their input
[36:46] and it appears as though we would be
[36:48] able to start on that in the very very
[36:50] near future and it's going to be a
[36:52] building that will include a science
[36:55] lab. Uh it will handle all the students
[36:58] we have now plus substantial growth.
[37:03] uh and we've been able to get sufficient
[37:05] height which at first we were not able
[37:07] to but working with the city uh we're
[37:10] able to get sufficient height to have a
[37:13] gym because as you know here this last
[37:15] winter we've had a lot of inclement
[37:17] weather and the children were out on the
[37:19] playground and they get cold they get
[37:21] wet but this will be a complete facility
[37:24] and we just have uh I don't have enough
[37:27] time to tell you but the regulations for
[37:30] the city are very very tight and And you
[37:33] can only get so much height and they're
[37:34] very strict on the height that you have.
[37:37] And that height depends on how far this
[37:40] church is set, this principal building
[37:42] is set back from the from the street
[37:45] boundaries. And when everything was
[37:48] finally calculated out, it was just
[37:51] absolutely perfect. The size of building
[37:53] that was required fits just perfectly in
[37:56] the envelope of property that is left
[37:58] out there. And uh and you don't know how
[38:01] much I rejoice over these things cuz I
[38:03] have a lot of internal secrets, you
[38:05] know, and one of them is that the
[38:07] congregation that wouldn't know is this
[38:10] entire parking lot is actually under
[38:14] easement. It's registered under easement
[38:16] to the city of Suriri. They own all that
[38:19] parking lot out there. And they wanted
[38:22] us to give them property for detention
[38:25] ponds, for storm detention ponds. and we
[38:28] didn't want to give up land. So we said,
[38:30] "What can we do?" You know, so it was
[38:32] suggested, "Well, let's shape the
[38:34] parking lot so it all drains and we'll
[38:36] give you that land." So they said,
[38:38] "Fine." So that's all series. We've been
[38:41] parking on it for years and we'll park
[38:42] on it till the rapture comes. And uh and
[38:45] so they the consequence of that is we
[38:47] can't build a building on it, but
[38:49] there's a corner there. Guess what? Just
[38:51] the size we need.
[38:54] Just exactly the size we need that they
[38:56] don't have. and they didn't need and so
[38:58] we got space. So I think uh for myself
[39:01] I'm satisfied the Lord that had that in
[39:04] his mind for a long long time ago and
[39:05] just said you know you can't have this
[39:07] corner cuz we're going to need it on
[39:09] down the road. And so I'm very very
[39:11] thankful for that and all the giving
[39:13] that you give and all the contribution
[39:15] all the support you give to the school
[39:17] directly to the school. It doesn't have
[39:20] to come through the church. Uh that is
[39:23] that is completely t tax deductible for
[39:26] you. And I can tell you one thing, it's
[39:28] a very very worthy cause. And for those
[39:31] of you that don't have children, uh it's
[39:34] still a worthy cause. For those of you
[39:36] that are young families and maybe don't
[39:39] have children, you will have children.
[39:41] For those of you who are empty nesters,
[39:43] that won't be long. You'll be
[39:45] grandparents. And uh I can tell you
[39:47] there isn't anybody that doesn't benefit
[39:49] from it. And and you singles that are
[39:52] sitting here and say, "Well, you know
[39:53] what interest do I have in a school?"
[39:54] Well, uh you will have someday and it's
[39:57] best to get a head start and support it
[39:59] now.
[40:02] God bless you. We were out at the camp
[40:04] this last week and the amount of work
[40:07] that has been done there is just
[40:08] staggering. Absolutely staggering. Uh I
[40:12] have to just say a couple of things. We
[40:14] had on real short notice on Friday. uh
[40:17] many of you were called and a lot of the
[40:20] your brothers sp uh you uh responded
[40:26] positively and were out there and I
[40:28] don't know what all took place but
[40:30] there's there's very senior brothers who
[40:32] are giving time up from their businesses
[40:34] they're giving time up from their work
[40:36] and so when you go out there and
[40:39] volunteer I'd like you to remember that
[40:40] there's other brothers that are
[40:42] volunteering businessmen that are
[40:43] volunteering time and taking senior
[40:46] positions our our brother Randy has been
[40:49] spending uh weeks, Brother Chris
[40:53] Peterson has spent full time essentially
[40:57] since we uh purchased the camp. And uh
[41:01] and I just want to tell you, we're going
[41:03] to have a request in a few moments, but
[41:06] uh there was a a a company that's been
[41:08] providing
[41:10] uh providing sand and gravel and
[41:12] concrete and uh they seemed very very
[41:16] favorable towards uh the the camp and
[41:20] the Christian camp and the people that
[41:21] they've met. and they met brother Randy
[41:23] and he spoke to them uh and I'll just it
[41:26] was cowen sand and gravel and they gave
[41:30] a check for $10,000
[41:32] and they said if you need you know if
[41:34] the bill goes more then come back and
[41:37] speak to us and they gave a check for
[41:40] $5,000 last week and the the founder of
[41:44] that company he said I want to you know
[41:48] I want to meet your pastor and he drove
[41:50] out uh last Thursday and we spend about
[41:53] a half a day together and he's just a
[41:56] very very godly he goes to a Pentecostal
[42:00] church and uh he was saved when he was
[42:03] 12 years old and has never looked back
[42:06] and he said I'm interested in in
[42:09] something like this and I want to know
[42:11] kind of where you people are coming from
[42:13] and then we spoke and we had some uh
[42:16] breakfast together and uh shared
[42:18] different testimonies and he just very
[42:22] very fine godly man that's walked in the
[42:25] light that God has made known to him. I
[42:28] appreciated that and actually he gave me
[42:31] a personal check towards the camp as
[42:32] well. But uh putting all of that aside
[42:36] that's irrelevant. What I'm really
[42:38] interested in is that that the
[42:42] involvement that God has allowed us to
[42:45] be involved with has helped us to touch
[42:48] other people and for their lives to
[42:51] touch us and and that's what really
[42:53] makes it worthwhile. You know where when
[42:56] you work at another job or you work in a
[42:58] factory whatever more the kind of work
[43:00] you do and the place you work at is
[43:03] really irrelevant. It is how God
[43:06] arranges things while you're there.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to that?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; See, and where you shop and and what you
[43:14] like and what you don't like, that's
[43:15] really irrelevant. But it's what what
[43:18] God has arranged for who you are to meet
[43:20] and who you are to speak to and who you
[43:23] are to live in front of. So I uh I this
[43:28] week we're having a kind of a final
[43:30] thrust right now and it's just a
[43:34] restoration of the land and some
[43:36] landscaping and brother Gary St. John
[43:38] he's he's been working with brother Jack
[43:40] Aguary. So, we're going to need brothers
[43:43] this coming week. And if you have a day
[43:46] during the week, if you have a day off
[43:47] and you can fit in a day, uh give a day
[43:50] and then next uh a lot can come on next
[43:54] Saturday. But if we can do it in the
[43:56] week time, it will also be a benefit.
[43:58] And we just need a a final push. And the
[44:01] one thing that we're doing to and I
[44:04] can't take time in the morning service
[44:06] to explain why, but the the chapel
[44:10] building which holds about 250 or 300
[44:12] people, it has no washrooms. And so, uh,
[44:17] Brother Randy has worked with the county
[44:19] in in putting the sprinkler and fire
[44:21] prevention system in and said, you know,
[44:24] we've got pipes coming up for the fire
[44:27] suppression system for the chapel and we
[44:30] got to have a place for those pipes to
[44:32] come up. It's called a riser. And so we
[44:34] but we we'll we'll build a washroom
[44:36] there cuz we need washrooms. And so,
[44:39] okay, they said. So, we didn't even need
[44:41] a building permit or anything else. are
[44:43] just letting us go ahead and put
[44:44] washrooms in uh to hold that pipe.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; So, I don't know if you folks know
[44:52] anything about negotiation, but I think
[44:53] that's real good negotiations. Uh we
[44:56] build the washrooms and get nice ladies
[44:57] and men's washrooms in there for 200 250
[45:01] people because they they have to have
[45:03] the pipe in there for the fire uh
[45:05] sprinkler system. Amen. Amen.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Well, uh, this last week we've had some
[45:12] miracles,
[45:14] &gt;&gt; and I believe in praying for answers to
[45:17] God, and I believe in taking time
[45:20] &gt;&gt; and giving God the glory.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Few days ago,
[45:26] uh,
[45:28] uh, Brother Toby and Sister Rebecca, and
[45:30] I'm going to have you, Brother Toby, if
[45:31] you'll come here, please, and join me at
[45:33] the platform, would you?
[45:41] Brother Toby
[45:43] and his wife, Sister Rebecca, they're
[45:45] expecting a child.
[45:48] And uh Sister Rebecca has been carrying
[45:50] this child for 5 months. And they gave
[45:54] her tests on the child
[45:57] and the doctors and specialists
[45:59] determined that the child there was
[46:01] something wrong with the child and it
[46:03] was missing a chromosome
[46:06] and the child wouldn't be normal.
[46:09] And uh for those of you that don't know,
[46:11] quite often that indicates a down
[46:13] syndrome child.
[46:16] And uh brother Toby and his wife just
[46:19] met I and my wife. My family doesn't
[46:22] know about this at this uh at that time
[46:26] because they said we want no one to
[46:29] know. We don't we have not told our
[46:32] parents. We're telling no one. It's just
[46:35] us four in the room. But we've come here
[46:38] for prayer.
[46:39] and uh she is to
[46:42] uh she's to go now and they're going to
[46:45] give us a final word in 3 weeks that
[46:47] they're studying all of these tests and
[46:50] they'll take I think blood work as well
[46:53] and uh brother Toby perhaps you can just
[46:56] can you just tell us a little bit I want
[46:58] to give God the glory and then you can
[47:00] tell us a call that you got from the
[47:02] hospital
[47:05] &gt;&gt; speak up plane there
[47:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you all It's been about two
[47:10] weeks ago. My wife went to the hospital
[47:12] to get what they call I think ultrasound
[47:17] and we got a result from the hospital.
[47:20] The doctor called us and said there's
[47:22] something wrong with the baby. There's a
[47:25] chromosome missing. So the baby may have
[47:28] a problem with uh memory or something
[47:31] that but he said most of the case like
[47:33] 90% of the babies they just died. So
[47:36] there's no hope.
[47:38] So that was like two weeks ago. So I
[47:43] just told the doctor, "Okay, that's
[47:44] fine. We'll go and pray." So walking out
[47:48] of the hospital, me and my wife were
[47:50] just sitting in the car and said, "So
[47:52] what are we going to do?" And she said,
[47:54] "Oh, you know, it's good to call the
[47:56] parents and ask them to pray and call
[47:58] some friends and people that can hold
[48:00] and pray." Said, "I think that's a good
[48:03] idea, but we have a pastor. I think it
[48:05] should be good to call the pastor and
[48:07] mention that to him. So I called the
[48:10] pastor's house and there was sister ro
[48:12] on the phone and I told her uh we really
[48:15] need to talk to a pastor. We have a
[48:17] problem. We have a burden our hearts and
[48:19] we need a prayer. So okay you can meet
[48:21] the pastor before the service that was a
[48:23] Wednesday. So Wednesday before the
[48:25] service we went to meet brother Ed in
[48:28] his office and we told him what happened
[48:30] and said we haven't called our parent.
[48:33] They don't know nothing. We just keep a
[48:35] secret between you and us and God. We
[48:39] can ask you to pray for us. And uh my
[48:42] wife have to go back and get another
[48:44] blood test to make sure what's going on
[48:46] exactly. But they've confirmed by the
[48:48] hospital that the baby has a missing
[48:50] chromosome.
[48:52] Brother Ed said, "Okay, we'll pray." And
[48:54] they give us a testimony of brother West
[48:57] or deal. He had the same case and said,
[49:00] "Uh they've prayed for and God answer
[49:02] pray." Oh, this got a testimony. So,
[49:05] just bring our faith more higher than
[49:08] what we had. So, brother Ed prayed
[49:11] before the service and he just told me
[49:13] Toby, you go and believe. We know we
[49:16] have a God of miracle and our God's
[49:18] alive. So, just keep it keep it secret.
[49:21] Me and my wife, we won't tell nobody
[49:23] until God uh moved in the sand. Uh that
[49:27] was Wednesday. On Sunday, Brother Ed was
[49:30] speaking. I don't know if I I think it
[49:34] was just the Holy Ghost talking uh
[49:37] behind the pulpit but while brother Ed
[49:39] was preaching he mentioned something he
[49:42] was giving a testimony how people could
[49:44] come uh to the prophet and he could tell
[49:48] tell them the secret of their heart and
[49:51] he said our God is more than anything
[49:54] our God is more it's it's able I can't
[49:58] recall it exactly but I think our God is
[50:01] greater than the chromosome that you may
[50:03] missing and I just told my wife I think
[50:06] that is for us and we just kept and
[50:08] believe it so Tuesday morning and we
[50:11] received a call from the hospital and
[50:13] they said everything was fine the
[50:15] chromosome is just want to praise the
[50:18] Lord for
[50:27] [Music]
[50:30] that everything is fine now. You don't
[50:32] have to worry about it.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; They said the chromosome that was
[50:34] missing is back.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; We give him praise.
[50:44] Hallelujah.
[50:48] Amen.
[50:50] Hallelujah.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; That's our God. Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Not many days ago, uh, we've been we
[50:59] made an announcement that no one was
[51:01] permitted to go and visit Sister Megan
[51:05] and, uh,
[51:07] which we didn't we don't say a lot of
[51:09] the things over the pulp, but not able
[51:11] to. But they did say that the doctors
[51:15] felt she had menitis
[51:17] and also a fever. And of course the
[51:20] fever would be fighting against the
[51:22] menitis. I would expect she was not
[51:25] responding a whole lot and there were
[51:27] also times when she didn't recognize her
[51:30] father. That's just a few days ago
[51:33] as of yesterday. I will read this uh
[51:37] which uh Michael has provided for us.
[51:40] Megan has been improving and recovering
[51:43] in a miraculous way. Yesterday she was
[51:47] up in a wheelchair, had strength to
[51:50] cross her legs as well as to write a
[51:52] short note at not only strength, but
[51:55] that's something in in the mind. They
[51:59] have taken her off of oxygen and will be
[52:02] hopefully taking the trick because they
[52:04] had one uh out of her throat uh next
[52:07] week. Uh they will be attempting to have
[52:11] her walk next week as well as uh start
[52:16] her on weights for physical therapy. Con
[52:20] uh considering it has been only two
[52:23] weeks, her progress can only be the
[52:26] result of prayer and the Lord's
[52:28] intervention.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:37] Hallelujah.
[52:38] [Music]
[52:40] We're going to have prayer, but I think
[52:42] before we have prayer, there's other
[52:44] testimonies here
[52:46] uh from brother Emanuel. His his wife
[52:50] had terrible high blood pressure
[52:52] actually was on the floor in the lady's
[52:54] washroom last Sunday and God has
[52:57] intervened and our sister Francine is
[52:59] here and we thank God for that. She was
[53:02] at a stroke level with her and with the
[53:06] medical people we have here in the
[53:07] church. Uh she was at a stroke level and
[53:10] and God has raised her up. And there's
[53:13] another one or driving home Friday night
[53:16] uh
[53:18] uh Absford. I can't re read the whole
[53:22] thing, but this is from brother
[53:23] Gretchen. And he looked in his rearview
[53:26] mirror and the car behind was not
[53:28] stopping and coming at them fast. And as
[53:31] he braced himself for the impact, the
[53:33] car swerved just clipping the rear
[53:36] bumper. And just want to thank the Lord,
[53:39] Brother Gretchen, Sister Elizabeth, we
[53:42] thank God for his protection. I'd like
[53:45] to have you stand. We want to sing to
[53:47] God be the glory. Great things he hath
[53:49] done. And uh and and if you don't have a
[53:52] reason to say, "Praise the Lord. Praise
[53:55] the Lord." I do. And I believe we all
[53:57] do. and I would encourage you to lift it
[54:00] up to him. Uh we want to thank him for
[54:03] what has been done and for what he will
[54:05] yet do. And we're going to then uh have
[54:09] prayer over these prayer cloths as well.
[54:12] We're going to be remembering also Mr.
[54:14] Cen who I just spoke to you about. His
[54:17] greatgrandson
[54:19] has just had a tumor. He's only 6 months
[54:22] old and has just had a tumor the size of
[54:24] a grapefruit removed from his body. I
[54:28] believe just yesterday he's in uh in a
[54:31] hospital in Seattle, Children's Hospital
[54:34] in Seattle. We want to pray and I told
[54:36] him we would pray for his great grandson
[54:40] and his name is Riley. So, we're going
[54:42] to be praying for him. Uh we're going to
[54:45] be pray for our sister Vineyard who's in
[54:49] the hospital with infection. We're going
[54:51] to pray for Hudson uh Drake who has got
[54:55] a lung congestion. And we want to pray
[54:58] for Sister Lana's father. Sister Lana
[55:01] was had to rush to the hospital
[55:03] yesterday. Her father had a cardiac
[55:05] arrest. He's in Royal Colombian
[55:08] Hospital. I have a cloth here. And these
[55:10] are the requests we're going to remember
[55:12] in prayer. But we're going to give God
[55:14] thanks.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thanks for what he has done.
[55:18] Thanks for what he will do. Amen.
[55:22] To God be the glory. to God be the glory
[55:27] great things he have done. So
[55:33] the power that he gave us his son
[55:48] Yeah.
[55:52] Heat.
[56:02] Heat. Heat.
[56:14] Give him the glory.
[56:18] He has
[56:20] praise the Lord.
[56:34] God to the Father
[56:40] and give him the glory
[56:44] things he have done.
[56:49] Now we'll bow together in prayer and
[56:50] unite our hearts. Father, we have come
[56:52] to the altar. We have come where we have
[56:56] received answers. We have come, oh God,
[56:59] to a living God, the only true living
[57:03] God. You're the God of Abraham, the God
[57:06] of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And as
[57:08] our Lord Jesus said, you're the God of
[57:10] the living, not the God of the dead.
[57:12] You're the God that spoke to Moses.
[57:14] You're the God that manifested yourself
[57:16] in this generation with supernatural
[57:19] signs and wonders and all manner of
[57:22] miracles. Oh God, you have never
[57:24] changed. Your attributes are the same
[57:27] today. Your mercy is the same. Your
[57:29] longsuffering is the same. We pray for
[57:32] the souls, oh God, of these that are
[57:34] needy. Sister Lana's father, oh father,
[57:37] how our sister Lana has been such a
[57:39] faithful sister, such a faithful
[57:41] witness, oh God, and always encouraging
[57:44] different ones within the assembly. I
[57:47] pray, Father, that her prayers and arms
[57:50] have come before you even now, oh God,
[57:52] as she holds before you her father and
[57:55] his soul. I pray, Father, that you will
[57:58] reach down into that hospital and
[58:00] whatever awareness he has, I pray that
[58:03] you will cause, oh God, his hearing to
[58:06] remember, Lord, his thoughts to remember
[58:08] the words that his daughter has spoken
[58:10] to him and the prayers that have been
[58:12] prayed for him. And even now, oh God, we
[58:16] just want to know that his soul is in
[58:19] your hands. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[58:21] touch his body. Sister Vineyard, Father,
[58:24] remove this infection from her, I pray,
[58:27] oh God, and raise her up, we pray, from
[58:29] that bed of affliction. Father, we pray
[58:32] for Mr. Cen's uh uh ch grandson, Riley.
[58:37] Father, I pray that you will cause this
[58:41] young lad to grow up and be a healthy
[58:44] boy. I would pray, Father, that he would
[58:46] be brought up in the fear and the
[58:48] admonition of the Lord. I pray, oh God,
[58:51] you'll bless, Father, our brother Cen
[58:53] for his for his prayers, for his faith,
[58:57] for his witness, and for his support of
[59:00] your work. Lord, we pray, Father, you
[59:02] will cause our fellowship to increase.
[59:05] And I just ask that you will hear not
[59:07] only his prayer, but ours today. And we
[59:10] pray for your word and your Holy Spirit,
[59:13] Lord, throughout the land and throughout
[59:15] this uh congregation today. We're here
[59:18] to hear from you, Lord. We're here to
[59:20] receive answers from you, oh God. We're
[59:23] here to receive revelation, oh God. I
[59:26] pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you'll
[59:28] smite every devil of unbelief. I pray
[59:31] that you'll smite every critic. Oh God,
[59:33] I pray that you will bring a mighty
[59:35] mighty outpouring of your Holy Spirit
[59:38] upon your people and in the lands where
[59:41] this is meeting is now being streamed.
[59:44] They are a part of our congregation. Oh
[59:46] God, even into Saudi Arabia, into
[59:49] Switzerland and Norway and New Zealand,
[59:51] oh God, into China and wherever this
[59:53] will be heard. I pray you will bless
[59:55] your people immensely. And now Lord, we
[59:57] wait upon you. Anoint me, I pray to
[1:00:01] utter the words that you'd have spoken
[1:00:03] and the people whose hearts may be good
[1:00:06] ground to receive the seed in Jesus
[1:00:08] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Sorry to be delayed
[1:00:14] as much as we are, but I think this is
[1:00:16] important time.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to turn in your Bibles if
[1:00:19] you would please to second Corinthians.
[1:00:22] We're going to read a portion chapter 4
[1:00:26] and we'll read from verse 14 to 18 and
[1:00:29] then on into chapter 5.
[1:00:35] This is a very full service. I I uh I I
[1:00:39] don't want to make it longer than it
[1:00:41] needs to be, but I felt that I needed to
[1:00:43] take time to just say some things that
[1:00:45] we haven't had an opportunity to say.
[1:00:47] And we've got two that are being
[1:00:49] baptized right soon as I finish
[1:00:51] preaching. So,
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; my goodness,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; have burials. Have burials right after
[1:00:57] the service. Amen.
[1:01:00] Hallelujah. All right. Starting at the
[1:01:02] 14th verse.
[1:01:04] knowing that he which raised up the Lord
[1:01:08] Jesus shall raise up
[1:01:11] uh raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[1:01:16] present us with you. like you to notice.
[1:01:18] We're going to go carefully here knowing
[1:01:21] that he he
[1:01:24] which raised up Jesus, none other than
[1:01:28] God himself, the heavenly father raised
[1:01:31] up Jesus
[1:01:32] uh shall raise up us also by Jesus. So
[1:01:37] this resurrection is certainly not for
[1:01:40] every person. This is those that Jesus
[1:01:43] is going to raise up and shall present
[1:01:46] us with you. For all things are for your
[1:01:50] sakes and the abundant grace uh that the
[1:01:53] abundant grace might through the
[1:01:55] thanksgiving of many redounded uh to the
[1:01:59] glory of God. For which cause we faint
[1:02:01] not. But though our outward man, notice
[1:02:05] that please, perish, yet the inward man
[1:02:09] is renewed day by day. For our light
[1:02:12] affliction, which is but for a moment
[1:02:14] workketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:02:16] eternal weight of glory, while we look
[1:02:19] not at the things which are seen, but at
[1:02:22] the things which are not seen, for the
[1:02:24] things which are seen are temporal, but
[1:02:27] the things which are not seen are
[1:02:29] eternal. Amen.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Into the fifth chapter. For we know that
[1:02:34] if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:02:38] were dissolved, we have a building of
[1:02:41] God and house not made with hands,
[1:02:45] eternal in the heavens. For in this we
[1:02:48] grown earnestly, desiring to be clothed
[1:02:50] upon with our house which is from
[1:02:53] heaven. If so be that being clothed we
[1:02:56] shall not be found naked. For we that
[1:03:00] are in this tabernacle do groan, being
[1:03:03] burdened, not for that which we would be
[1:03:06] unclothed, but clothed upon, that
[1:03:09] mortality might be swallowed up in life.
[1:03:13] Amen. And you may have your seats.
[1:03:17] I'm taking a fifth uh fifth message on
[1:03:22] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:03:25] bride. It's really been uh
[1:03:29] a subject that I've not been able to get
[1:03:32] over
[1:03:33] uh and get through
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; the scripture which we read. We have we
[1:03:40] have a building of God
[1:03:44] our theophony body. I'm going to make
[1:03:46] some comments now. I find that this has
[1:03:48] been uh profitable just to set the tone
[1:03:52] of the service. Our theophony body is
[1:03:56] what we are going to.
[1:03:59] There's a lot of questions about our
[1:04:02] theophony body, the word body, the one
[1:04:06] you skipped around in the beginning. And
[1:04:09] on the one hand, we have one eternal in
[1:04:12] the heavens,
[1:04:14] theophony body, and yet it is calling
[1:04:18] for the word to be preached.
[1:04:21] Brother Brandham has spoken about this
[1:04:23] that that body is calling for the word
[1:04:26] to be preached here so that we might be
[1:04:29] formed into the full stature of Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ,
[1:04:34] the perfect son of God.
[1:04:39] When God said, "This is my son in whom I
[1:04:42] am well pleased." He didn't say that
[1:04:45] when he was 5 years old or 10 years old.
[1:04:50] But there was an appointed time in the
[1:04:53] life of Jesus when that voice spoke and
[1:04:57] he come to the baptism waters of baptism
[1:05:00] and the heavens opened and a voice was
[1:05:03] heard. Uh voice was heard also on mount
[1:05:06] transfiguration. Hear ye him. And so
[1:05:10] there are appointed times when this is
[1:05:12] done. I want you to think about the
[1:05:15] space of time that God has labored in
[1:05:20] bringing forth his son. And in the
[1:05:22] previous services I've been I kind of
[1:05:25] went back and how God in his great mind
[1:05:29] has brought uh the bringing forward of
[1:05:33] his son Jesus Christ and how he labored
[1:05:36] bringing forth his son and how all
[1:05:39] through the Old Testament from the
[1:05:42] foundation stones and the lineage
[1:05:45] uh through the children of Israel until
[1:05:47] a virgin received uh the word of God in
[1:05:50] the channel of her soul. soul and with a
[1:05:53] confession, be it unto me according to
[1:05:57] thy word. And that Virgin Mary received
[1:06:01] that uh the message from the angel, be
[1:06:04] it unto me according to thy word. And
[1:06:07] she had a conception.
[1:06:09] How long is God laboring? I'm asking a
[1:06:11] question. And how long is God laboring
[1:06:14] to bring forth the new man
[1:06:17] into the image of the theophony man?
[1:06:22] You know, is this something that's just
[1:06:24] instantaneous? No, I don't think so. I
[1:06:27] think that this is actually a process.
[1:06:29] Your eternal body,
[1:06:32] your eternal dwelling place is calling
[1:06:36] for what is needed.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:39] Some of the things that people have as
[1:06:41] desires, we have we have just natural
[1:06:44] desires in life. We desire certain
[1:06:46] things. We we have ambitions and goals.
[1:06:51] But there are some desires which I think
[1:06:53] are separated from the other desires.
[1:06:56] They are very very deep abiding. They're
[1:06:59] more than a desire. They're a craving.
[1:07:02] They're more than a craving even. It is
[1:07:06] a it's a yearning. and perhaps even into
[1:07:09] a groaning within a person uh unspoken.
[1:07:14] Many times I think very most of the time
[1:07:18] those kind of cravings are unspoken.
[1:07:21] You crave for something of a very very
[1:07:24] deep spiritual
[1:07:27] uh something that cannot be explained
[1:07:29] because the language regardless of what
[1:07:32] language is your mother tongue that
[1:07:34] language will not fit that spiritual
[1:07:37] hunger and that spiritual desire now I'm
[1:07:40] separating that from just natural
[1:07:42] desires of this life. I believe that
[1:07:44] that spiritual desire actually is
[1:07:48] responding or is created within you as a
[1:07:52] result of what is waiting us on the
[1:07:54] other side and that is calling you to
[1:07:57] that place.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; So it's calling you in this physical
[1:08:02] realm to hear certain things. Now of the
[1:08:06] five senses of the five senses of this
[1:08:09] body, brother Brandham said these five
[1:08:11] senses were not given to contact God.
[1:08:15] But yet God uses it. It is not your
[1:08:19] taste buds. You don't gain faith through
[1:08:22] your taste buds.
[1:08:25] You don't gain faith from what you see.
[1:08:28] What you see might even be a detriment
[1:08:31] to your faith. You don't gain faith by
[1:08:34] your feeling and you don't gain faith by
[1:08:38] your seeing, but you do come to faith
[1:08:41] through your hearing.
[1:08:43] Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; And so there is a channel that God has
[1:08:47] given that you hear the word of God and
[1:08:51] then God gave you a channel that's
[1:08:54] beyond the channel of the the channels
[1:08:56] of the emotions of your memory, of your
[1:09:00] imagination, of your conscience, of your
[1:09:03] affection, and of your reasoning.
[1:09:05] Bypassing those, there's a channel to
[1:09:07] the soul. And that one channel to the
[1:09:10] soul is for your your your belief or
[1:09:13] your unbelief. If you disbelieve or
[1:09:16] believe that's that that's what happens.
[1:09:18] And brother Brandham says one place your
[1:09:20] your free moral agency your choice to
[1:09:24] decide. I'm going to believe it. I won't
[1:09:26] believe it. And yet God has to give it.
[1:09:28] If you are a predestinated son or
[1:09:30] daughter of God, you will come. Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; All that the Father hath given me will
[1:09:36] come.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And I will lose none of them. It just
[1:09:40] depends when you come.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; And I say sooner is is better than
[1:09:45] later.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Come when you hear.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself a lot of trouble.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself some irreparable
[1:09:55] heartaches.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Come and save yourself
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; all of the pain of waiting. So don't
[1:10:02] wait. Don't don't forget the devil is
[1:10:06] still a a terrible taskmaster.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And he he does pay wages, but the wages
[1:10:12] of sin is death.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; And so how long is God laboring to bring
[1:10:18] forth the new man into the image of the
[1:10:21] theophony?
[1:10:23] And your eternal body, your eternal
[1:10:27] dwelling place is calling for what is
[1:10:30] needed. Your desires are evidence of
[1:10:33] that eternal home.
[1:10:36] Not just your not just a blanket
[1:10:38] statement of your desires. Oh, I'd like
[1:10:40] to repaint my house or I'd like to get
[1:10:42] another car. It has nothing to do that's
[1:10:44] irrelevant. That's just here in this
[1:10:46] physical world. But I'm talking about
[1:10:48] those desires that you have that are
[1:10:51] more than a desire. If you had that's
[1:10:54] why this world
[1:10:56] being as busy as it is is really a
[1:10:59] curse. It really is a curse to our our
[1:11:02] faith and our spiritual life. We need to
[1:11:05] minimize the things of this life so we
[1:11:08] can have time to ponder, to meditate, to
[1:11:11] pray, to be quiet, and to ask God on a
[1:11:15] continual basis. What would you have me
[1:11:17] to do? What is your will in my life? And
[1:11:20] give time to that. And get tuned to the
[1:11:23] invisible realm.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just so you can be thinking
[1:11:28] with me, uh when I'm I'm going to be
[1:11:33] coming back to these thoughts, but when
[1:11:36] God made the first man, Adam,
[1:11:39] he was made in the image of God. Brother
[1:11:42] Brandham says clearly he was a spirit.
[1:11:44] God is a spirit. So, the image that he
[1:11:47] made was a spirit man. And for the
[1:11:50] anyone who may be listening or may be
[1:11:52] here and has struggle with the trinity
[1:11:56] uh they said let us who is us let us
[1:11:59] well I just like to leave that there and
[1:12:02] have any trinitarian who may be
[1:12:04] listening or whoever will listen answer
[1:12:06] the answer me a question before I answer
[1:12:09] you like Jesus said when he was asked a
[1:12:11] question he says well I'll ask you a
[1:12:12] question first and when you answer my
[1:12:15] question and I'll answer yours.
[1:12:17] Uh so I ask trinitarians or anybody I
[1:12:21] say when okay you said let us I'll go
[1:12:24] with you. Okay that's exactly what the
[1:12:26] scripture says let us make man in our
[1:12:28] image. Uh my next question is did God
[1:12:32] did he achieve that? Did he make a man
[1:12:34] in his image and they always say yes. I
[1:12:37] said when he was done how many men did
[1:12:39] he have?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; And that was the image. So God is one.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; I don't try to explain who us. All I
[1:12:54] look at at the result when he was done
[1:12:58] he had one man
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; in his image and in that image he had uh
[1:13:03] masculine feminine because his wife was
[1:13:06] taken out from him. That's right.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; But now uh the second chapter says uh 2
[1:13:12] and 7 of Genesis that there was no man
[1:13:15] to till the ground. The prophet brings
[1:13:18] it in such simple language. A spirit
[1:13:21] doesn't have hands to put on the plow
[1:13:23] and to cape the garden and to cape or do
[1:13:26] whatever else. So uh uh so God took of
[1:13:30] the dust of the earth from which we all
[1:13:32] have come uh and formed him and breathed
[1:13:36] into him the breath of life and he
[1:13:39] became a living soul. So now he breathed
[1:13:42] into him the breath of life. That which
[1:13:45] God breathed into him was the invisible
[1:13:49] merging with the visible.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And it's that invisible part that you
[1:13:53] can't understand.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:56] It's that invisible part that your
[1:13:58] English language or French language or
[1:14:00] German language or any other language
[1:14:03] can't really respond to adequately
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; just can't. It's not made for it.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; But it is that that is the from the
[1:14:14] invisible world entering into the
[1:14:16] visible realm. There is a merging of
[1:14:19] those two. Please notice by the breath
[1:14:22] of God.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I have some I have some slides that
[1:14:31] I'm going to
[1:14:35] show please here.
[1:14:42] For we know that if our earthly house
[1:14:46] of this tabernacle were dissolved,
[1:14:49] we have a building of God
[1:14:53] and house. I'd like you to notice our
[1:14:56] earthly house, but we have a building of
[1:14:59] God. And the building of God is the
[1:15:00] build. The word building doesn't mean
[1:15:02] like another house. The word building is
[1:15:05] actually something that is built up,
[1:15:07] something that is constructed, something
[1:15:09] it it it's edifi, something that's an
[1:15:12] edifice. So it's we have a building. In
[1:15:15] other words, we have something that God
[1:15:17] has built and house not made with hands,
[1:15:21] eternal in the heavens.
[1:15:26] We have a building of God and house not
[1:15:29] made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[1:15:33] For we know that if uh our earthly house
[1:15:38] uh of this tabernacle were dissolved,
[1:15:43] we have a house not made with hands
[1:15:44] eternal in the heavens. And the Lord
[1:15:47] God, the Bible says, "Now the Lord God
[1:15:50] formed man of the dust of the earth." So
[1:15:53] God, this is also a building of God. He
[1:15:56] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[1:15:59] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:16:02] life and man became a living soul. So
[1:16:06] the question there's always a a question
[1:16:08] and many people have posed the question
[1:16:10] to me is uh is there any difference
[1:16:12] between an unbeliever and a believer?
[1:16:14] Does an unbeliever have a theophony?
[1:16:17] Have you ever thought of that?
[1:16:20] says he made him out of the dust of the
[1:16:22] earth.
[1:16:24] Now, not in his own image,
[1:16:27] but he had already made the man.
[1:16:31] Then he breathed into him the breath of
[1:16:35] life and he became a living soul. So the
[1:16:40] soul of man is the nature of the spirit.
[1:16:44] Now, brother Brandham said that very
[1:16:45] very early and he says it very late in
[1:16:48] the ministry. The soul of man is the
[1:16:52] nature of the spirit. He never changed
[1:16:54] that. Now you'll find in earlier
[1:16:56] messages he says body, soul and spirit
[1:17:02] and he takes the spirit as the inside.
[1:17:05] But as it comes to the and from the
[1:17:07] seals forward even in greatest battle
[1:17:09] ever fought he drew those three circles
[1:17:12] body, spirit, body, soul and spirit. But
[1:17:16] then uh later on he says body, spirit
[1:17:21] and soul. And he gives the distinction
[1:17:23] of the channels to the body, the
[1:17:26] channels to the spirit and the and the
[1:17:28] channel to the soul. The one channel to
[1:17:30] the soul. Now I'd like you to notice one
[1:17:33] thing. This phrase, the soul of man is
[1:17:37] the nature of the spirit. He never
[1:17:40] changed that at all. That always
[1:17:42] remained the same. So whether it's it
[1:17:45] whether the structures one way or the
[1:17:46] other way really is irrelevant. It is
[1:17:49] what is the function of each and the
[1:17:51] function of each remains the same. And
[1:17:53] the soul your soul is the nature of your
[1:17:56] spirit. And if that soul is changed if
[1:18:00] that soul life is changed it takes
[1:18:03] control of your your spirit realm and
[1:18:07] that spirit realm then is is controlled
[1:18:10] by the soul. If and the soul was made to
[1:18:13] receive the word.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So in that challenge of the soul, a man
[1:18:16] either rejects the word of God with
[1:18:19] unbelief and that happens to be the only
[1:18:22] sin.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Then if you reject that, your affections
[1:18:27] go sideways.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Your reasonings goes haywire.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of your confession, everything
[1:18:35] of that realm, your memory will only
[1:18:37] remember negative things, wrong things,
[1:18:41] your imag, you'll imagine evil things,
[1:18:45] all of that. If that soul is not born
[1:18:48] again,
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; so the soul has to go through the birth.
[1:18:51] When that goes through the birth,
[1:18:52] everything changes.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God keep working on it.
[1:18:58] So now uh so the soul is the nature of
[1:19:03] of the spirit. When you're reborn, you
[1:19:08] don't get a new spirit. You get a new
[1:19:11] nature of that spirit.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's the same spirit, but a new nature
[1:19:20] of it. You take you take two men, stand
[1:19:24] them together. Both look alike and one
[1:19:29] of them is a sinner and the other of
[1:19:31] them is a Christian. One man say uh I
[1:19:37] got a spirit of the same and the same as
[1:19:40] you have but one of them is a different
[1:19:44] his soul his nature is different and
[1:19:47] he's been he's been changed.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; So then
[1:19:54] uh Genesis 126:27,
[1:19:57] he formed them out of the dust of the
[1:19:59] earth and breathed into the nostrils.
[1:20:02] The prophet says, "And so he breathed
[1:20:04] into this man."
[1:20:07] He says, "I don't know how. I don't know
[1:20:09] how he made him. He put him in five
[1:20:12] senses so he could contact his earthly
[1:20:14] home and see, taste, feel, smell, and
[1:20:17] hear. And he made him in that manner. So
[1:20:21] these senses uh was not to contact God.
[1:20:25] It he didn't give the senses to contact
[1:20:28] God. Now in questions and answers
[1:20:32] says what connection does the first man
[1:20:35] have with the second man? The new man,
[1:20:39] the old man, the new man. What
[1:20:41] connection does he have?
[1:20:44] And he says, "The first man is the
[1:20:47] second man made manifest in five
[1:20:50] senses."
[1:20:52] The first man is the second man made
[1:20:55] manifest in five senses. In other words,
[1:20:58] when you're born here in this life and
[1:21:02] the breath of life is breathed into you,
[1:21:05] that is uh like a a human spirit. But
[1:21:08] now, here's where I found uh very very
[1:21:11] revealing for us.
[1:21:13] in the message and knoweth a not. Now,
[1:21:16] inside of that is a spirit which you
[1:21:19] become when you're born here and the
[1:21:22] breath of life is breathed into you.
[1:21:25] That spirit is of a worldly nature
[1:21:28] because it was not given from God but it
[1:21:31] was given
[1:21:33] permitted
[1:21:35] by God. So I I want you to see very very
[1:21:38] clearly that that breath of life that
[1:21:41] you take when a child is born into this
[1:21:45] world that is not the same as God
[1:21:48] breathed into Adam in the garden.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; What God breathed into Adam is not a
[1:21:56] worldly nature.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; It can never be a worldly nature.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; It's a holy God. Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; No evil ever come from him out from his
[1:22:05] being. And so this is very clear. And in
[1:22:08] the message continuing, knoweth it not,
[1:22:13] I want to read. He says, "Now, the only
[1:22:15] way up here in these spheres, I I I wish
[1:22:19] I'd had this on a slide, but uh
[1:22:23] the only way up here in these spheres
[1:22:26] that you could ever be in this little
[1:22:29] inside man, you have to be for ordained
[1:22:33] because you were with God. You are a
[1:22:36] part of God." Said, "I was in my father.
[1:22:40] I was in my grandfather
[1:22:43] and my grandfather's grandfather
[1:22:46] by seed. I was in that and I was in
[1:22:50] Christ.
[1:22:52] You were in Christ before the foundation
[1:22:54] of the world.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem his own.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; His own was what was in him.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He says, "Hallelujah. His children that
[1:23:04] was in him. That's what he came to
[1:23:07] redeem."
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] Now there is a difference between what
[1:23:15] God breathed into Adam when he became a
[1:23:19] living soul and when a child is born by
[1:23:23] natural birth and takes the breath of
[1:23:25] life. Now here I want to make this
[1:23:28] difference very distinct.
[1:23:31] What God did, brother Brandham says in
[1:23:33] blasphemous names. What God did, he
[1:23:36] breathed the breath of eternal life.
[1:23:40] Amen. Then he became a living soul, a
[1:23:44] soul that can't die.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Notice he said he breathed the breath of
[1:23:50] eternal life into his nostrils. He
[1:23:53] became an eternal soul because God
[1:23:57] breathed, not what nature done.
[1:24:01] Not what natural not what nature did.
[1:24:06] Are you following me?
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; See, it was after this God breathed into
[1:24:11] Adam. After this came the fall and then
[1:24:15] children, bisexual
[1:24:18] uh relationship and a natural birth.
[1:24:21] They said it's not by natural, not what
[1:24:24] come by natural. When we have a a
[1:24:26] natural birth and then God permitted
[1:24:30] that a human spirit and and and notice
[1:24:34] when he's praying for the sick, you'll
[1:24:36] hear it on the on the tape all the time.
[1:24:38] He said, "Now be real still. Be real
[1:24:40] reverent." He said, "Because you have a
[1:24:42] human spirit." Now, he wouldn't have to
[1:24:45] be saying that if that was the Holy
[1:24:48] Spirit in each person that was doing the
[1:24:51] moving around. It's not the Holy Spirit.
[1:24:54] You're human spirit. People become
[1:24:56] distracted. They become, you know,
[1:24:58] tired. They become whatever whatever.
[1:25:01] and and and even God himself standing
[1:25:05] present at the platform to heal and to
[1:25:09] reveal the secrets and to do all manner
[1:25:12] of of of supernatural things. But the
[1:25:15] human spirit can get restless. The human
[1:25:17] spirit can become distracted. That's the
[1:25:20] spirit that you're born with.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; But that's not the spirit that God
[1:25:25] breathes into you. When you receive the
[1:25:27] Holy Spirit in the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:30] Spirit, God breathes into you and you
[1:25:32] are an eternal son of God. But that seed
[1:25:35] laid in you from the beginning or you
[1:25:37] never would come.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, the scriptures not
[1:25:41] reconcilable.
[1:25:42] All that the father hath given me will
[1:25:45] come.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; They already were given.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; They already are his.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; My sheep.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Whose sheep?
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; My sheep.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; What do they do? know my voice.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Didn't say they will. Some of them will
[1:26:01] know or some of them might come. My
[1:26:04] sheep know my voice.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And they won't follow another.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; And if they do, they're they're
[1:26:13] troubled. They're not at home. They're
[1:26:15] not at peace. They haven't found and
[1:26:17] they got to keep going. What is it? that
[1:26:19] groaning, that desire, that that just
[1:26:21] drive within them, that yearning. I must
[1:26:24] find the truth. I must find uh what my
[1:26:28] soul is crying for. And for that son and
[1:26:31] daughter of God who is God's child, they
[1:26:34] have a theophony body waiting for them
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; and that is what's calling them. Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; So there's a difference between what God
[1:26:45] breathed into Adam
[1:26:48] uh when he became a living soul and he
[1:26:50] said so now
[1:26:52] notice he breathed into uh breathed of
[1:26:55] eternal life into his nostrils and he
[1:26:58] became an eternal soul because God
[1:27:00] breathed not what nature done but what
[1:27:03] God did. breathed the breath of life
[1:27:06] into his nostrils and he became a living
[1:27:09] soul.
[1:27:12] Before Adam died, he had a lamb that
[1:27:15] redeemed him. Those who he forneew, he
[1:27:20] has called and he got a lamb to redeem
[1:27:24] him. So before before Adam even fell,
[1:27:28] there was already a lamb.
[1:27:31] Before the sickness came, as as uh I
[1:27:34] think Rabbi Richmond said, before the
[1:27:38] sickness came, there was already a
[1:27:39] remedy.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; He said, then you say, uh, brother
[1:27:47] Brandham, but he said, you know, then
[1:27:50] you say Adam died. And he says, but
[1:27:53] remember before Adam died, he had a lamb
[1:27:57] that redeemed him. And redemption is to
[1:27:59] buy him back.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; He says those who he forneew he called
[1:28:04] and he got a lamb to redeem to redeem
[1:28:07] them. He said he was a type.
[1:28:11] Adam was a type. Adam fell. Then the
[1:28:14] lamb was provided for Adam because
[1:28:17] already in his nostrils had become the
[1:28:21] breath of eternal life. He was redeemed
[1:28:24] because already he had in him the breath
[1:28:27] of life. You understand?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; So then Adam and Eve had children and on
[1:28:34] and on till we've come into the world
[1:28:36] and we have when we issue into the
[1:28:38] world, we take that breath of life.
[1:28:40] That's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; That's a human spirit.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And we're born in sin and shape in
[1:28:48] iniquities. But then if that one that's
[1:28:51] been born is a forordained,
[1:28:55] predestinated son or daughter of God,
[1:28:59] they will hear the voice of God
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; and they will come
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and then the Holy Spirit comes to them.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; And so here he's saying he was a type.
[1:29:10] Adam was a type.
[1:29:12] Adam fell.
[1:29:15] We all were in the fall. Then the lamb
[1:29:17] was provided for Adam because already
[1:29:20] why was the lamb provided? Because
[1:29:23] already in his nostrils had become the
[1:29:26] breath of the eternal God and he become
[1:29:30] a living soul. He was a son of God
[1:29:36] says not his breath as the African word
[1:29:39] they call amoya. And I don't know if
[1:29:42] some of our people here from Africa, but
[1:29:44] in in in one of the languages of Africa,
[1:29:47] at least it's called ammoya, which means
[1:29:49] the wind and unseen force. Notice,
[1:29:53] brother Brandham says this, animals
[1:29:56] breathe ammoya
[1:29:58] and sinners breathe amoya.
[1:30:03] That's not the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's not the breath that we're talking
[1:30:08] about.
[1:30:10] Just to bring you right up real quick,
[1:30:12] the breath, so I don't want to lose you.
[1:30:16] The breath of God is something that
[1:30:19] issues
[1:30:20] out of his being.
[1:30:24] Uh,
[1:30:26] you have breath. I have breath this
[1:30:27] morning. So I can go,
[1:30:32] that was breath. Doesn't mean anything
[1:30:35] to you.
[1:30:37] That was breath. I also have voice
[1:30:42] as you have voice. I can say praise be
[1:30:46] to God.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; That's also breath.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; I can say repent and be saved. Every one
[1:30:55] of you be baptized. Every one of you.
[1:30:58] That's also breath.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; I can say forgive me Lord Jesus. I'm a
[1:31:03] sinner. Forgive me. That's breath. And
[1:31:07] God can say, "As it was in the days of
[1:31:10] Noah, so shall it also be in the coming
[1:31:12] of the Son of Man." That's breath.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; God's breath through Malachi said,
[1:31:21] "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:31:23] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:31:25] Lord." That's God's breath. Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; God's breath says, "We shall not all
[1:31:31] sleep, but we shall all be changed in a
[1:31:34] moment, in the twinkling of an eye."
[1:31:35] That's God's breath.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; And why does God issue out his words by
[1:31:41] his breath? That is his breath. This
[1:31:44] here is God's breath.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; And he has given a certain voice, a
[1:31:50] certain portion, a segment, time locked
[1:31:53] segment for every season. So that the
[1:31:57] his children who come up, the
[1:31:59] predestinated, the elected that come up
[1:32:01] in that generation, they will hear that
[1:32:04] voice because that voice belongs to the
[1:32:08] invisible part of them that they've not
[1:32:10] been able to understand. That voice and
[1:32:14] this has to merge.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; And it does merge because one was made
[1:32:19] for the other.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Am I making some headway?
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Just like when God breathed into Adam
[1:32:29] the breath of life. And I'd like to
[1:32:32] suggest to you that wasn't just a a a
[1:32:35] blow of of air.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; God breathed into him the breath of
[1:32:43] life. It's a very very interesting
[1:32:47] thought and I'm going to come to it in a
[1:32:48] few moments. But that breathing, I would
[1:32:51] like you to think of that breathing as
[1:32:55] uh someone who's trying to revive
[1:32:59] someone else
[1:33:01] and they're giving them mouth-to-mouth
[1:33:03] resuscitation.
[1:33:05] And I have read account not very long
[1:33:08] ago, I believe, of a a fireman
[1:33:12] and uh whether it was a policeman or a
[1:33:14] sheriff or what it was, but this person,
[1:33:17] this fireman was terribly
[1:33:20] uh injured in a fire and they began this
[1:33:23] this officer or another uh another one
[1:33:27] of his friends, I don't know what it
[1:33:29] was, whether it was a fireman or a
[1:33:31] police. I think it was a policeman. And
[1:33:32] he began to give him, this happened in
[1:33:35] Ontario, began to give him mouthto-mouth
[1:33:38] resuscitation. And he labored and he
[1:33:41] worked and he blew and he he was trying
[1:33:44] to get the man over an hour. I think
[1:33:46] about an hour and a half. And he labored
[1:33:48] till he just felt he could not go on any
[1:33:52] longer. He had no strength left. He had
[1:33:54] no energy left. But he's trying to blow
[1:33:56] life into this man. And that man came to
[1:33:59] life.
[1:34:00] And the man wrote a large article in the
[1:34:03] Reader's Digest. Outstanding. Very, very
[1:34:06] touching. But he came back and he
[1:34:08] remained unconscious for a very long
[1:34:10] time. And then and then it's it's an
[1:34:12] outstanding account and he woke up.
[1:34:17] It's really incredible. But now if you
[1:34:19] think of that, now I want to I want you
[1:34:22] to think of God breathing.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; So he began to breathe through his
[1:34:28] prophets. He's exerting himself. He's
[1:34:31] sending out his word. He's calling the
[1:34:33] people. He's trying to direct them. He's
[1:34:36] trying to heal them. He's trying to tell
[1:34:38] them of his goodness. And he's blowing
[1:34:40] into them. Trying to get Israel to come
[1:34:43] to life. Trying to get this generation.
[1:34:45] And he's standing and he's blowing
[1:34:48] trying to resuscitate as it were
[1:34:50] Leodysia and saying, "Behold, I stand at
[1:34:54] the door and knock.
[1:34:59] Hallelujah. What's he trying to do? He's
[1:35:01] trying to grow life into a dead church.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; And for centuries, for centuries, he
[1:35:11] been seeking to blow life because
[1:35:13] there's been his word, his voice to the
[1:35:16] people, and his And why does he do it?
[1:35:19] Because he's got sheep out there. He's
[1:35:22] got children out there. And he's going
[1:35:24] to bring them to life. He's going to
[1:35:25] redeem them by his voice.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Didn't happen just with a, you know, we
[1:35:35] read it and we think, oh, it was just a
[1:35:37] had nothing to do with that.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; It was a labor.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; A labor of love.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to resuscitate them.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And that's why he breathed into Adam.
[1:35:51] See God breathing into Adam. This is my
[1:35:54] son. I'm going to bring him back.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to redeem him.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave him in the
[1:36:02] devil's camp.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; He slipped into death. He slipped into
[1:36:07] separation. But I'm going to unite him
[1:36:09] back to myself.
[1:36:11] [Applause]
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Blow my breath into him.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to thrust it through the man
[1:36:21] of God. I'm going to thrust it through
[1:36:23] the minister. He's going to preach with
[1:36:25] every ounce of energy that he has. He's
[1:36:28] going to I'm going to thrust my voice
[1:36:29] through him. I'm going to call out
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; and something's going to reverberate
[1:36:35] inside of somebody. It's going to be a
[1:36:38] daughter or a son of God and it's going
[1:36:40] to respond to that seed. There's going
[1:36:42] to be a vibration and they're going to
[1:36:45] respond to it. What is it? It is the
[1:36:47] invisible merging with the visible.
[1:36:50] And then their life is changed and the
[1:36:53] habits drop off and the attributes all
[1:36:55] the attributes of sin begin to fall
[1:36:57] away. Why? Because they heard the voice
[1:37:00] of God and received the breath of God.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Everything's different from then on.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Your lives have been changed
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; because God breathed into you.
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; What God breathed into Adam
[1:37:26] is equal to what he is breathing into us
[1:37:30] by the breath of his message.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to take these phrases
[1:37:38] as I touch me very very deep. I want you
[1:37:41] to take them. What God breathed into
[1:37:43] Adam is equal to what he's breathing
[1:37:47] into us by the breath of his message.
[1:37:50] This message we've talked about a
[1:37:52] message is the breath of God.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; If it's not, how does it change lives?
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And those that have claimed salvation,
[1:38:01] those that have it, it is a sad we have
[1:38:04] a sad disaster last night. How many you
[1:38:08] have heard about?
[1:38:11] Just a handful.
[1:38:15] Just travel to Abbottzford,
[1:38:20] 30 minutes down the road and you'll come
[1:38:23] to the turnoff, the turnoff circle off
[1:38:25] of the freeway
[1:38:27] on Macllum.
[1:38:29] And you turn off in Macallum, there's a
[1:38:31] huge church right there.
[1:38:35] That church had a rock band they called
[1:38:39] Christian rock band last night and
[1:38:43] hundreds they said about 1,200 young
[1:38:46] people
[1:38:48] were there and they and they said on the
[1:38:51] news they were jumping and dancing in
[1:38:54] front of the stage
[1:38:56] and the floor gave way
[1:38:59] and over a hundred of them fell to the
[1:39:01] basement
[1:39:03] and over 40 of them are injured and
[1:39:06] three critically.
[1:39:09] The senior pastor
[1:39:11] was uh speaking about the event and
[1:39:15] about the structure of the billy and
[1:39:17] everything.
[1:39:19] I can tell you before God, I thank God
[1:39:24] that I wasn't the senior pastor of that
[1:39:26] church
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; trying to go on national television and
[1:39:30] tell. In fact is if I'd have been a
[1:39:33] reporter I would have been asking what
[1:39:36] is this rock band doing and what is
[1:39:40] young people jumping and dancing? Why
[1:39:43] don't they go to a rock concert if they
[1:39:45] want to do that
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; and rock in front of the platform
[1:39:51] where the word of God is supposed to
[1:39:53] come. You think that people with a
[1:39:54] sincere heart can have confidence this
[1:39:57] morning that something's going to come
[1:39:59] across that pullpit? Where's it come to?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Do I have a Do I have a reason to be
[1:40:05] able to cry out?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; They call Christian rock even in
[1:40:15] Pentecostal churches. It's a shame. It's
[1:40:18] a disgrace. I have nothing to do with
[1:40:20] it.
[1:40:22] before God. I thank God for the breath
[1:40:24] of God.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Going the way of the world.
[1:40:31] Our lives ought to cry out against it.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; I can tell you the Lord Jesus Christ, he
[1:40:37] would not be easy on that. He'd say
[1:40:39] false prophets.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; False teachers
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; leading the people to a slaughter. No
[1:40:46] wonder the prophet of God had to scream
[1:40:48] out against that, telling them 45 years
[1:40:50] ago, you're backsliding,
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; letting the women go on in their way and
[1:40:58] nakedness and shorts and cutting their
[1:41:00] hair and all these things and the men
[1:41:02] and and and the men agreeing to it.
[1:41:05] There's any man that hasn't got the back
[1:41:07] backbone to stand up against that, you
[1:41:09] ought to repent yourself.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this congregation, you
[1:41:16] ought to support that and support that
[1:41:18] kind of preaching behind this pull.
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the breath of God.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Not a moy of the wind, but the breath of
[1:41:30] God that has spoken, the word of God.
[1:41:33] And even this morning, he's seeking to
[1:41:35] blow into your being, down into your
[1:41:38] soul. The Holy Spirit is seeking to blow
[1:41:41] the channels of that spirit realm clear
[1:41:44] and get rid of all out of the trash.
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; So that you never go back that direction
[1:41:51] again. We're not directed to by that
[1:41:53] spirit realm, by that emotion and the
[1:41:55] affection and so on. We have it. We
[1:41:57] thank God for it. But it needs to be
[1:41:58] under control of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; that come from the soul.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:42:07] Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; The breath, this breath of life is that
[1:42:13] final act of God in God's labor bringing
[1:42:18] forth our house which is from heaven.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:42:25] it was God's final act to breathe.
[1:42:30] breathe,
[1:42:32] resuscitate, bring back to breathe into
[1:42:35] Adam, to give him his voice, to give him
[1:42:39] his word.
[1:42:42] And I don't know what all God said to
[1:42:44] Adam, but he breathed into him and he
[1:42:48] became a living soul.
[1:42:50] There was a reaction,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; a positive reaction.
[1:42:56] When God breathed into him, he didn't
[1:42:58] say, "Well, it wasn't enough."
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't have any negative
[1:43:03] confession.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't come up with some
[1:43:06] confession. Well, you know, thank you,
[1:43:08] Father, for that, but I need more.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm getting to you or
[1:43:13] not.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; That was the final act.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; This is a key point. Stay with me. Final
[1:43:23] act. When God breathed into Adam and he
[1:43:25] became a living soul, then God was in
[1:43:28] Christ
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; for what purpose? To reconcile the world
[1:43:32] to himself.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; And what is Christ's final act?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Just before he leaves,
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; breathes upon the disciples, says,
[1:43:42] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; And then comes 2,000 years of church
[1:43:49] ages. And at the end of the age, not a
[1:43:53] reformer but a prophet has to come at
[1:43:56] the end of the age because the last act,
[1:43:58] the third pull act, the final act is
[1:44:01] breathing out the word of God to the
[1:44:04] people.
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a resurrection breath.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; It's a rapture breath.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; It's a invisible merging with the
[1:44:16] visible.
[1:44:18] This body according to the breath of
[1:44:20] God, this body that you're sitting in
[1:44:23] must be changed. If you're a son or
[1:44:26] daughter of God, this body must be
[1:44:28] changed. It can only be changed by the
[1:44:31] breath of God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is not a rock band.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is not just some
[1:44:39] entertainment on the platform. The rock
[1:44:42] of God is not some social uh social
[1:44:44] sermon. The rock the the breath of God
[1:44:48] is not about politics.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is the original word
[1:44:52] that's been spoken brought forward to
[1:44:54] this age.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; The breath of God is a messenger that
[1:44:59] can come and that God by the Holy Spirit
[1:45:02] directs him to exactly that portion of
[1:45:05] the scripture. That is his breath for
[1:45:07] this age.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's his breath for these people.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; His breath for you.
[1:45:14] And there is no other voice that will
[1:45:16] satisfy what's inside.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; If you think there is, go on your
[1:45:22] search.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I'll invite you. Go on your search. Go
[1:45:25] your way. If you think it's a television
[1:45:28] evangelist, fill your stomach with it.
[1:45:31] If you think of some loosey goosey, you
[1:45:34] know, something something out there,
[1:45:36] foozy floozy stuff, help yourself. Fill
[1:45:39] your stomach full.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; You'll find out it won't hold you. Amen.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; It'll leave you empty.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; And when you're done, you'll find
[1:45:48] yourself in terrible condition
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; and you'll be crying out. If you're a
[1:45:52] son or daughter of God, you'll be crying
[1:45:53] out, "Oh God, have mercy upon me."
[1:45:57] Hallelujah.
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:00] Hallelujah.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; The breath of God in this final act in
[1:46:07] God's labor, bringing forth
[1:46:10] our house which is from heaven. The
[1:46:14] power of the revealed word of God
[1:46:17] breathing eternal life into us here and
[1:46:20] now. Building our house which is from
[1:46:23] heaven. May I just shock you by saying
[1:46:25] your house which is from heaven is under
[1:46:27] construction.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus said I go
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; to prepare a place for you
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; and if I go and prepare a place who do
[1:46:42] you think the son of man is? Who do you
[1:46:44] think it is that was revealing himself
[1:46:46] when the messenger stood here and come
[1:46:49] in the same pattern of Jesus Christ?
[1:46:51] Come out of nowhere,
[1:46:54] come with no background,
[1:46:56] comes with the same character, the same
[1:46:58] attributes, healing the sick and doing
[1:47:01] all manner of supernatural things and
[1:47:04] the phenomena and the stars and and the
[1:47:07] dove coming from and the lights and so
[1:47:09] on coming. It's all the same pattern.
[1:47:12] Amen.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; It's Bible language.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; And a cloud coming
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; and the cloud meant something.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; To just a few
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; and a voice.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And while baptizing
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; in the water,
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; and the lights that come and the
[1:47:33] different things doesn't mean anything
[1:47:35] to a lot of people, but to the elect, it
[1:47:37] means a lot because it's Bible language.
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:42] It's not sermonizing.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; It's not homalytics.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; It's not out of a seminary.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; It's out of the eternal God.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And somehow it touches you.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Somehow there's something in you because
[1:47:57] that and you have to merge
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; because it is the physical now meeting
[1:48:04] the spiritual.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; It is the new man. Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; There's the old man and the new man.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And then there's just this this man here
[1:48:20] of this flesh,
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; but inside there's an old man
[1:48:25] and and he's got to experience a
[1:48:27] transformation
[1:48:29] and become a new man.
[1:48:31] So the power of the revealed word of God
[1:48:34] breathing eternal life into us here and
[1:48:38] now building our house which is from
[1:48:41] heaven. Amen.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; In his final act, Jesus breathed on his
[1:48:48] disciples, saying, "Receive ye the Holy
[1:48:52] Ghost." And the Son of Man revealed in
[1:48:54] this last age
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; breathes into the bride body as a last
[1:49:00] and final act of his ministry,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; the breath of the third pull.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it doesn't mean anything
[1:49:10] to you, you ought to get a hold of it
[1:49:11] and say, "God, why doesn't it mean
[1:49:13] something to me?" It's the breath of the
[1:49:15] third pull, the third pull of brother
[1:49:16] Brandham's ministry, the third pull of
[1:49:19] Christ ministry was breathed on them.
[1:49:21] Receive ye the Holy Ghost to lead them.
[1:49:24] The last part, where's the people that
[1:49:26] were healed? Where's the Where's the
[1:49:28] people that experienced the miracles?
[1:49:29] Millions of them received the miracles.
[1:49:31] Where are they?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Where's the people whose hearts had the
[1:49:35] the secrets of their hearts were
[1:49:37] revealed? Tens of thousands, millions of
[1:49:40] them. Where are they?
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Where are all the people that ate the
[1:49:45] supernatural food when Jesus was being
[1:49:47] crucified? Where were they?
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; Whose voice was it crying out?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Where were the supporters at that time?
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; As it was then, so is it now.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; But there was a little band. There was a
[1:50:04] little group of elect people.
[1:50:07] Hallelujah. They on whom he had breathed
[1:50:09] and when he breathed as his final act
[1:50:12] because Jesus was the beginning of the
[1:50:14] new creation of God according to the
[1:50:16] word of God. Is that right?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the new
[1:50:20] creation.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; And so the beginning of the new creation
[1:50:23] did exactly what the heavenly father did
[1:50:25] in Eden. Breathe into the nostrils of
[1:50:28] Adam and he became a living soul.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; And now the now that that that first
[1:50:33] Adam fell and the creation fell with it.
[1:50:35] And he says, "And and then this natural
[1:50:37] body," that's why you're dying.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "We must fall with the
[1:50:41] fall.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; We're part of the fall through a natural
[1:50:44] birth, through sexual birth." Even
[1:50:46] though you received a you received a
[1:50:48] human spirit, but that's not what we're
[1:50:50] talking about. We're talking about the
[1:50:52] breath of God that comes by the Holy
[1:50:53] Ghost. And I can tell you what came out
[1:50:55] of that messenger's mouth was the Holy
[1:50:58] Ghost.
[1:50:59] [Applause]
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:03] That's why Jesus said, "Go and tar in
[1:51:04] Jerusalem until he be endued." And so
[1:51:08] 120 went up there and Pentecost has
[1:51:10] tried to replicate and duplicate that.
[1:51:12] It that didn't come to be replicated and
[1:51:14] duplicated because what came out of that
[1:51:16] was Peter and the 120. And then Peter
[1:51:19] stood up and he said, "Men and brethren,
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; hear me.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Hear what I have to say."
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that breath now became his
[1:51:29] breath.
[1:51:32] Hallelujah to God. God was continuing to
[1:51:35] breathe. God was continuing to
[1:51:37] resuscitate the people. And when he
[1:51:40] breathed on the people, they they were
[1:51:42] pricricked in their heart. Men and
[1:51:43] brethren, what must we do? And Peter
[1:51:45] then breathed the Lord.
[1:51:48] Repent.
[1:51:50] Every one of you repent. Turn around. Go
[1:51:53] the other direction and be baptized in
[1:51:56] the name of Jesus Christ. and you shall
[1:51:58] receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; I say praise be to God.
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:18] [Applause]
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; The breath of the third pull.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; The resurrection breath.
[1:52:26] I say breathe on me. Breathe on me. Oh
[1:52:29] third pull, breathe on me. Oh the voice
[1:52:32] of God in this last day, breathe on me.
[1:52:36] Hallelujah. Sometime we get weak and
[1:52:37] sometime we get frail spiritually. You
[1:52:40] need that breath to be resuscitated.
[1:52:42] That's why we say hear the word. Hear
[1:52:44] the message. Hear it.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; You're privileged people.
[1:52:52] There's multitudes who wish they were
[1:52:54] sitting where you're sitting.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily in this church. I'm
[1:52:58] talking about
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; hearing what you have heard
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; in this day.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Resurrection breath, the merging
[1:53:11] of the visible
[1:53:13] with the invisible.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; It's the final act after a very long
[1:53:18] process.
[1:53:20] God in his labor pains bringing you
[1:53:24] forth.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; I'm just got a couple of moments and I'm
[1:53:30] going to close. We're going to go right
[1:53:31] to the baptism. I'm a long ways from
[1:53:33] being done.
[1:53:35] I'm on page three of 13.
[1:53:41] in Ephesians parallels Joshua
[1:53:46] we're reading of Paul's writings
[1:53:49] and that's what he taught the church
[1:53:50] brother Brandham is speaking the church
[1:53:52] positionally before the foundation of
[1:53:54] the world before the foundation of the
[1:53:57] world how long has this been happening
[1:54:02] how long has this been taking place
[1:54:04] before the foundation of the world and
[1:54:06] he says God in his labor labor pain was
[1:54:11] bringing forth you.
[1:54:13] [Music]
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; God in his labor pain before the
[1:54:18] foundation of the world. God in his
[1:54:23] in his contemplation and his death.
[1:54:25] God's a living being.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; What kind of children
[1:54:32] will I have?
[1:54:35] What kind of a family I desire?
[1:54:38] fellowship. Yes, I've made angels and
[1:54:41] they're worshiping me,
[1:54:44] but there was still something in that
[1:54:46] great eternal being.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And he desired
[1:54:50] something closer.
[1:54:52] I want to make them free. I want to let
[1:54:56] them have free will. I want them to have
[1:54:59] choice. I want them
[1:55:01] to respond.
[1:55:05] I'd feel very very shortchanged
[1:55:09] if I would have to live with my wife and
[1:55:13] point her to our marriage certificate
[1:55:16] and say, "Hey, you're married to me
[1:55:21] and don't forget it."
[1:55:24] And I expect a certain standard of
[1:55:27] service here in the home. And she could,
[1:55:30] like brother Bam says, take me by the
[1:55:32] tie and say, "Listen, you know, I don't
[1:55:34] want you to have eyes for anybody else
[1:55:36] and you be the way you're supposed to be
[1:55:38] and you provide for me. Matter of fact,
[1:55:40] we don't have quite enough money in the
[1:55:42] bank. Uh,
[1:55:44] you know, you're my provider. Wouldn't
[1:55:48] that be a terrible place?
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; But we just, you know, we're married to
[1:55:53] each other
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and we don't feel we don't regret over
[1:55:58] that. We don't we're not despondent
[1:56:00] about that.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; God wanted children.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; He wanted a family.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; And you're sitting here today. And you
[1:56:12] know what you're doing by sitting here?
[1:56:13] You are your own witness either for
[1:56:16] yourself or against yourself.
[1:56:20] that you're here in this church
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; hearing this service today
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; being blowed on
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; and blowed into by the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; You're your own witness. I'm here. How
[1:56:33] am I here? Is this an accident? Someone
[1:56:35] invited me. I came here for a certain
[1:56:37] purpose. I came here because I was
[1:56:38] invited. I came here because my parents
[1:56:40] are here. I came here. No, no, no.
[1:56:42] You're here.
[1:56:44] You're here by no accident. whatsoever.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; You're here to hear a special message
[1:56:52] that God is breathing his voice
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; into your very soul.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose that you're here.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; And furthermore, with this I close. He
[1:57:05] said, "And there's something that you
[1:57:08] have that is a craving and a groaning,
[1:57:10] something maybe you weren't even aware
[1:57:11] of when you drove here to the service,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; but you have a spiritual
[1:57:16] hunger.
[1:57:18] And in a message thirst, the prophet
[1:57:20] calls it thirst.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; You have a thirst.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You're thirsting almost painfully
[1:57:28] thirsting after something. Don't blame
[1:57:30] me. Don't blame God. Brother Brandham
[1:57:33] said, "It's your body."
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; In the invisible,
[1:57:39] it's your body calling for those
[1:57:41] vitamins. The vitamins this morning to
[1:57:45] alert you this morning. And he talks
[1:57:47] about when mother was his mother was
[1:57:49] carrying children. He said we are so
[1:57:51] poor.
[1:57:52] And he says then then she be to crave
[1:57:55] for something cantaloupe watermelon
[1:57:58] something strange perhaps. She began to
[1:58:02] my wife and she was carrying Linda. I
[1:58:04] don't know who to blame. My wife or
[1:58:05] Linda but she craved raw potatoes.
[1:58:09] So now the whole world knows dear.
[1:58:12] And we were in meetings
[1:58:16] and I didn't understand it. I'm just a
[1:58:17] young man. Now I'm going to make a
[1:58:18] confession
[1:58:20] and and you ever have anything aggravate
[1:58:23] you?
[1:58:24] And we're trying to practice and sing
[1:58:27] and she's carrying Linda and my wife's
[1:58:30] playing an accordion. Sister McGriff
[1:58:33] playing an accordion. I'm playing a
[1:58:34] guitar. Brother McGriff plays a guitar.
[1:58:36] And we're trying to practice quartets.
[1:58:38] and and and and all I hear is crunch
[1:58:41] clench crunch cl
[1:58:43] when will you be done with these raw
[1:58:45] potatoes?
[1:58:47] Even cooked ones would be more silent,
[1:58:49] but these had to be raw potatoes. And so
[1:58:52] she'd crunch on those raw potatoes. But
[1:58:55] you know the thing was brother Brandham
[1:58:57] says now her body's craving it
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; because the child needs it. Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Now, the bride of Jesus Christ, I'm not
[1:59:07] trying to make a doctor. Now, the bride
[1:59:09] of Jesus Christ as a as a wife of the
[1:59:14] husband says, "I've gone to prepare a
[1:59:18] place for you." Oh, you know, I I could
[1:59:20] preach here for another hour and I would
[1:59:21] just be nicely started. I will go and
[1:59:24] prepare a place. That's who it was that
[1:59:26] was here. Brother says, "It's not me,
[1:59:28] it's him." Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; They're all I I I I was going to speak
[1:59:33] something else, but now I'm I'm to speak
[1:59:36] this. And those messages came as a
[1:59:39] breath of God coming and maybe and and
[1:59:42] you know what the people were there. He
[1:59:44] said to brother Billy Paul in one of the
[1:59:46] seals, he said, "Did you understand
[1:59:47] that, brother Billy?" Says, "Yep." He
[1:59:50] says, "No, Billy, did you understand
[1:59:52] what I preached?" Yeah. Yeah, Daddy, I
[1:59:54] did. Billy,
[1:59:56] did you understand what I spoke today?
[2:00:00] No, I didn't.
[2:00:04] Lots of people didn't understand it back
[2:00:06] then. Do you know why it was for you?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; There was all kinds of things that were
[2:00:12] spoken time locked for you right now in
[2:00:15] this time. Because the end time message
[2:00:18] meets the end time conditions. And the
[2:00:20] conditions are different now than they
[2:00:22] were there. There isn't anything. There
[2:00:24] isn't storm. There isn't earthquake.
[2:00:26] There isn't famine. There isn't anything
[2:00:28] that can take the son or daughter of
[2:00:30] God.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; There isn't enough devils in hell.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; I'll announce to Lucifer himself today,
[2:00:39] the word which we have, the breath of
[2:00:41] God can also blow him away.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; The breath of God with faith coming down
[2:00:48] into brother Toby and Sister Rebecca's
[2:00:50] heart can put a chromosome where the
[2:00:52] doctor said there wasn't one.
[2:00:54] Hallelujah.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; The breath of God takes a menitis away
[2:00:58] and it's one time it's there, next time
[2:01:00] it's not there. That's the breath of
[2:01:02] God.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And we give him all the glory.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful?
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; And so the baby the baby craves for it.
[2:01:15] The mother craves for it cuz the child
[2:01:17] is calling for it.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; And now I'm part of the bride. You're
[2:01:21] part of the bride. We're part of this
[2:01:23] woman called the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:01:26] And then we get under. We we get a
[2:01:29] craving. We don't understand what the
[2:01:32] craving is. And we begin to speak things
[2:01:34] that we don't even know that we're
[2:01:36] speaking sometime. But it's you, your
[2:01:39] body in the invisible world calling for
[2:01:42] that vitamin.
[2:01:44] [Music]
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Your eternal home.
[2:01:50] I go to prepare a place for you. If I
[2:01:52] didn't believe it was Jesus Christ that
[2:01:55] had called me, called these other
[2:01:57] brethren, called you. If I didn't
[2:02:00] believe that, I guarantee you, I would
[2:02:02] not be here. I would not have spent this
[2:02:04] week studying. I would not sp be
[2:02:06] standing behind this pullpit. It's him
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; preparing the place for you. when your
[2:02:13] time comes that you'll be able to go and
[2:02:15] he says so that the child can come into
[2:02:17] the world and be happy
[2:02:19] and be fully developed. That's God's
[2:02:22] plan.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And God's plan is for you to be able to
[2:02:25] pass. And when that moment comes, you'll
[2:02:28] take a step and you have a theophony
[2:02:30] beside you. But what's happening today
[2:02:33] certainly is contributing to what's
[2:02:35] happening on the other side.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:43] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:45] [Applause]
[2:02:48] Those who are going to be baptized, why
[2:02:50] don't you just slip away now and and
[2:02:52] prepare and we're just going to sing a
[2:02:54] song and we're going to have the
[2:02:55] baptismal and immediately after we'll be
[2:02:57] dismissed. I think we've done real well.
[2:03:00] Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Did those raw potatoes do something for
[2:03:04] you, dear? They did. Good.
[2:03:10] We're We're glad God's got everything
[2:03:12] fixed, hasn't he?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that really sounds
[2:03:15] strange." Well, nothing strange in God's
[2:03:17] economy as long as it works.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Just works fine. Amen. Let the Holy
[2:03:24] Spirit just perfectly have his way. I I
[2:03:27] have a a a
[2:03:29] song I want to sing
[2:03:32] our chorus. Maybe you can just stand
[2:03:34] with me.

[2:12:00] Amen. You may be seated. These there
[2:12:03] will be two that are coming to be
[2:12:05] baptized.
[2:12:07] Young man and a young woman. And our
[2:12:09] brother Ben
[2:12:11] came from not that long ago all the way
[2:12:14] from India
[2:12:16] and heard of the prophet's message in
[2:12:18] India
[2:12:19] and immigrated he and his family to
[2:12:22] United States and ended up in
[2:12:24] Mary'sville
[2:12:26] and heard of the church here. And he may
[2:12:29] say more about that. You know, when
[2:12:32] someone walks into the tank, uh there's
[2:12:34] an incredible
[2:12:37] uh just an incredible
[2:12:41] caring that God has led an individual.
[2:12:45] And we're very thankful for our Ben that
[2:12:48] is here today. God bless you.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We're real thankful for
[2:12:53] what God's doing among us. And um I've
[2:12:56] just want to bring our attention to the
[2:12:58] two that'll be baptized. Uh, brother Ben
[2:13:02] uh is 21 years old and sister Tyra is 19
[2:13:05] years old. And it just seems in the last
[2:13:07] uh months that God's been dealing uh in
[2:13:10] a certain uh level with a certain group
[2:13:12] within our assembly. Uh we have brothers
[2:13:14] that have come from England, New
[2:13:16] Zealand, young men, and others that God
[2:13:19] has been uh within this whole area.
[2:13:21] There's a reason why God is dealing with
[2:13:24] a certain generation in this hour. I
[2:13:27] just wanted to bring our attention to
[2:13:29] that before our baptism of our brother
[2:13:31] Ben. Uh brother Ben was aware of the
[2:13:34] message uh back in India. He was born in
[2:13:36] the Punjabi uh region and with his
[2:13:39] family and they he went to be baptized
[2:13:41] actually at one season of his life and
[2:13:44] there wasn't enough water uh in the
[2:13:47] Creek River that they were going to. So
[2:13:49] when they immigrated to uh the United
[2:13:52] States and down into Mary'sville area
[2:13:54] and he began to search for a church, an
[2:13:56] area uh called the office and has been
[2:13:59] coming, this is his third Sunday, he's
[2:14:00] drove up by uh himself and God is uh
[2:14:04] dealing with Ben to give his heart uh to
[2:14:06] him again and wanting to be filled with
[2:14:09] the Holy Ghost. And the very first time
[2:14:11] that I spoke with uh Ben, actually both
[2:14:14] of these individuals have been put off.
[2:14:17] Uh uh we just just waiting and just
[2:14:20] seeking for the right time. Ben came
[2:14:22] last Sunday and wanted to be baptized
[2:14:24] last Sunday. And like we do with all, we
[2:14:27] just want them to know and understand
[2:14:29] who they're getting married to. And uh
[2:14:32] brother Ben uh brother Ben when I first
[2:14:35] spoke to him last Sunday just in a few
[2:14:37] moments my heart went back to the book
[2:14:40] of Acts chapter 8 and I know you're very
[2:14:43] familiar with uh brother Philillip uh
[2:14:45] when he was in a revival in Samaria and
[2:14:48] God was uh moving in that city and then
[2:14:51] God called him to be walking down a road
[2:14:54] and there was an Ethiopian unic that was
[2:14:56] in a chariot uh coming down that road
[2:14:59] that was reading the book of Isaiah. You
[2:15:01] remember that? And it was the angel of
[2:15:03] the Lord that spoke. The Bible says in
[2:15:05] verse 26, chapter 8 of Acts, the angel
[2:15:09] of the Lord spake unto Philillip,
[2:15:10] saying, "Arise and go toward the south
[2:15:14] into the way that goeth down from
[2:15:16] Jerusalem into Gaza, which is in the
[2:15:18] desert." And so it was the angel of the
[2:15:20] Lord that was leading Philillip, a a
[2:15:23] message believer, to come in contact
[2:15:25] with another seed of God. And
[2:15:28] immediately when I was speaking to our
[2:15:30] brother Ben uh this uh Ethiopian unic
[2:15:34] came into my heart because in verse uh
[2:15:37] that when you look in chapter 8 when
[2:15:39] they were riding in the chariot and then
[2:15:41] Philip came up into the chariot in verse
[2:15:44] 36 the Bible says and as they went on
[2:15:47] their way they came unto a certain water
[2:15:50] and the unic said see here is water
[2:15:55] hinder me to be baptized baptized. So it
[2:15:58] wasn't the minister, it wasn't his
[2:16:00] family, but it was the unic that said,
[2:16:03] "I want to be baptized. Here is water.
[2:16:06] What do hinder me?" And brother Ben has
[2:16:08] that in his heart. The same desire to
[2:16:11] give his heart to Christ and here's
[2:16:12] water. I'm at this junction. I've
[2:16:15] received Jesus Christ and I want to be
[2:16:17] baptized.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to allow Brother Ben to
[2:16:20] just speak what's on his heart. Uh I
[2:16:24] want to let you know all my brother and
[2:16:26] sisters because uh uh I'm not a native
[2:16:32] English speaker so I have a sometimes I
[2:16:35] do so so many mistake when I speak so
[2:16:38] please forgive me.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So
[2:16:41] uh in the presence of God or in my all
[2:16:45] brother and sisters I uh I regret or
[2:16:49] confess my all sins what have I have
[2:16:52] have done in my life all evil uh evil
[2:16:55] things what I think used to think in my
[2:16:57] life or
[2:17:00] so
[2:17:03] I'm not a good u I'm not a good
[2:17:05] Christian I wasn't a good Christian but
[2:17:08] I want to be a guru Christian according
[2:17:12] to Bible according to our uh
[2:17:16] uh revelation of our
[2:17:19] through the revelation of our brother uh
[2:17:22] William Mariam Brenon I want to be live
[2:17:25] my life according to Bible or according
[2:17:28] to uh true message.
[2:17:31] So
[2:17:33] uh how much time I can take brother?
[2:17:37] Uh I want to let you know guys I have my
[2:17:41] uh spiritual testimony or my physical
[2:17:44] testimony. So I'll start with my uh
[2:17:47] spiritual testimony. God revealed me his
[2:17:51] uh revelation. He's the God who
[2:17:56] he's the only one God. He's the God of
[2:17:59] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And he he's
[2:18:03] the only one God Jesus Christ. So he's a
[2:18:07] his great revelation he revealed on me
[2:18:10] through our brother William Mary Brham.
[2:18:13] So, so my physical uh testimony is this.
[2:18:18] Uh when I first came in this country, I
[2:18:20] mean in United States, uh I had a uh
[2:18:25] severe uh rupture disc problem. So I can
[2:18:29] barely stand. I can't barely you know uh
[2:18:33] sit. I just I was you know very
[2:18:37] in very bad condition.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. So I went to the doctor uh hospital
[2:18:43] they got everything uh examination they
[2:18:47] said you have only one ch
[2:18:50] uh one option surgery that cost me like
[2:18:54] $40,000 uh $1,000. So I kind of thought
[2:18:58] that so I pray uh my my trust my belief
[2:19:04] in Jesus Christ they said you'll be
[2:19:07] going to paralyzed because my both legs
[2:19:10] was all time you know numb or you know
[2:19:13] uh tingling or what can say
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; low life.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. So,
[2:19:20] but I believe Lord Jesus Christ, he's
[2:19:23] able. He's worthy. He's he's that great
[2:19:27] Lord. He can heal the paralyzed peoples.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; So, Amen.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; So, in front of viewer guys, I'm I'm
[2:19:36] healthy. I can stand. I can walk. I can
[2:19:40] walk. I praise the Lord.
[2:19:45] Amen.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; So I want to uh
[2:19:52] express my feelings about my brother and
[2:19:55] sisters. You know uh the one thing I
[2:19:59] missed in my life when I came here in
[2:20:01] United States in my church my that great
[2:20:04] message that uh brotherly love you know
[2:20:08] I try to find out that place where I can
[2:20:10] get that love where I can get that
[2:20:12] message. I went to a different different
[2:20:14] church right by my home, you know, but I
[2:20:16] never ever get that that thing. So,
[2:20:22] I I I
[2:20:24] just I can just thank God. I'm I found
[2:20:27] that brothers, I found that sister. I
[2:20:30] again I found that love or that
[2:20:33] brotherly love.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:40] Brother Brandham said they stopped the
[2:20:42] chariot and down in the water and
[2:20:44] baptized him and the Holy Ghost caught
[2:20:47] Philillip out of his sight till he
[2:20:48] didn't see no more. We just pray God
[2:20:50] will come to brother Ben today. Fill him
[2:20:53] with this Holy Ghost. Amen. Let's pray
[2:20:55] together.
[2:20:57] Father, your calling and your dealing in
[2:20:59] this end time hour. So many of us
[2:21:02] remember back to the day and to the
[2:21:04] season that you dealt with our lives and
[2:21:06] it was so personal and it was so real.
[2:21:09] Lord, our brother Ben has come all the
[2:21:11] way from India and settled in another
[2:21:13] country. And Lord, I believe in his
[2:21:15] heart he's looking for another country
[2:21:17] and another place that today is one
[2:21:20] footstep closer in that direction, this
[2:21:23] baptism and this time in his life where
[2:21:26] you will seal him with your spirit.
[2:21:28] Lord, may you come today as he's
[2:21:30] repented, he's confessed, Lord, his
[2:21:32] wrong. May you come even this very hour,
[2:21:35] this very season, and fill our brother
[2:21:38] Ben with the Holy Ghost. That he would
[2:21:40] be a testimony to his mother, his
[2:21:42] father, his brother, Lord, and others in
[2:21:45] his family that are searching and
[2:21:47] looking also for this reality. I pray
[2:21:50] that you'd make him a thunderbolt and a
[2:21:52] powerhouse that you are the same
[2:21:54] yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, I
[2:21:58] pray that you would grant the desires on
[2:22:00] his heart. What you've done for his
[2:22:02] physical back and for his life to touch
[2:22:04] him. Would you do for his spiritual
[2:22:06] life, may you continue to reveal
[2:22:08] yourself, make yourself known to our
[2:22:11] brother Ben. And we commit him to you in
[2:22:14] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. and
[2:22:17] our brother Ben, according to your
[2:22:19] desire and your hunger to be filled with
[2:22:23] the Holy Ghost and you've repented, I
[2:22:26] baptize you in the name of our Lord
[2:22:29] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:22:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank
[2:22:37] you, Jesus.
[2:22:42] Amen.
[2:22:44] Amen. Thank you. God bless you. Amen.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I've been to the water and I've
[2:22:55] been baptized.
[2:22:57] I was washed in the blood of the lamb.
[2:23:02] I changed from the creature.
[2:23:15] Heat.
[2:23:20] Heat.
[2:23:31] I had to change
[2:23:34] my sins were
[2:23:42] free
[2:23:44] when I was in darkness. Heat.
[2:23:57] Heat.
[2:24:01] [Applause]
[2:24:08] in the Lord has his way.
[2:24:12] Praise God has been changed.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Well, the dealings of God are so
[2:24:20] sovereign and so supernatural. Uh also
[2:24:23] with this is Sister Tara. She's almost
[2:24:26] 19 years old. She's uh been in middle
[2:24:28] school uh with Sister Patricia Stein and
[2:24:31] others that were in the assembly. and
[2:24:33] she's been raised in a Baptist uh
[2:24:35] background knowing of Jesus Christ from
[2:24:37] a young girl has never been baptized in
[2:24:40] and given her heart to the Lord. And um
[2:24:44] we were actually this afternoon supposed
[2:24:46] to meet together about baptism. And I'll
[2:24:48] just say this um I was going to put it
[2:24:52] off for another season of time. And we
[2:24:55] were just in prayer in my office this
[2:24:57] morning uh contemplating brother Ben's
[2:24:59] baptism.
[2:25:01] And um there was something in our
[2:25:04] hearts. The Lord had already given us um
[2:25:06] some some quotes that we were looking
[2:25:08] at. I've shared it with Tara since that
[2:25:11] I knew that there was something more.
[2:25:13] There was another person that God was
[2:25:15] dealing with and I didn't know if it was
[2:25:17] Tara or someone else in our
[2:25:19] congregation.
[2:25:21] So when I was in prayer and I said,
[2:25:23] "Lord, I need a word from you. I just
[2:25:26] need a witness in my heart." if it's for
[2:25:28] Tara or someone else you're dealing with
[2:25:30] in our congregation. So when I was um
[2:25:34] preparing for Ben and then I was in
[2:25:36] prayer and the Lord had given us this
[2:25:38] quote and when Philip had said here's
[2:25:40] water what does hinder us in adoption
[2:25:43] brother Brinham said nothing if you're
[2:25:46] ready that's the time don't let the
[2:25:50] devil get a chance to wedge something in
[2:25:52] there don't put off for tomorrow the
[2:25:55] things that you could do today tomorrow
[2:25:58] might not come for you I remember one
[2:26:01] time I did that and I learned and it
[2:26:04] taught me a lesson and I put off
[2:26:06] something that I should have done one
[2:26:08] day and the next day it was too late.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, who are you dealing
[2:26:14] with? Is it Terra? Is it someone else in
[2:26:17] our congregation? I got up from my uh
[2:26:20] little chair and I was thinking uh about
[2:26:22] these things, Tara." And I walked around
[2:26:25] to my desk and that's when they called.
[2:26:27] And so I know that the Lord has a mind
[2:26:29] for today, for Tara and also for maybe
[2:26:33] someone else. And I spoke to Tara this
[2:26:35] morning. And still even then I was just
[2:26:38] very hesitant to whether to put it off
[2:26:40] if this was the right time for Tara.
[2:26:43] She's been coming now for the last uh 6
[2:26:45] weeks or so to the young people's
[2:26:48] meetings and to the congregation. Her
[2:26:50] mother's here this morning. I just pray
[2:26:53] that God will fill Tara with the Holy
[2:26:55] Ghost and that he would just vindicate
[2:26:58] his dealings in our lives that are so
[2:27:00] sovereign. And I believe this is a
[2:27:02] special day for Tara. And when we were
[2:27:04] fellowshipping about the scripture and
[2:27:06] the Lord had already laid this on our
[2:27:07] heart uh even for brother Ben, the Bible
[2:27:11] says, "What to hinder us?" And Peter
[2:27:14] said on the day of Pentecost, this is
[2:27:16] brother Brandham speaking in another
[2:27:17] message. Repent every one of you and be
[2:27:21] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:27:23] the remission of your sins and you shall
[2:27:27] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. He
[2:27:29] said that's the one that you see working
[2:27:31] here. For the promise is unto you and to
[2:27:35] your children and to them that's far off
[2:27:38] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:27:41] call. He said follow that correctly and
[2:27:45] find out what takes place. That's what I
[2:27:48] did and that's what took place. And he
[2:27:51] said, "You do it and it'll take place
[2:27:54] for you."
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe this is for Tara
[2:27:58] today. She's desired to give her heart
[2:28:00] to Christ. Even her own mother has
[2:28:02] mentioned to her that since she's been
[2:28:04] coming in these last few weeks, what a
[2:28:06] change she's seen in Tara's life. And I
[2:28:09] pray that it would be even more, Pamela.
[2:28:11] And I just pray for what God is doing
[2:28:13] among us and in this season of time that
[2:28:15] he would just pour into this new
[2:28:17] generation more of himself.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray.
[2:28:25] Father, you're so wonderful to us. Lord,
[2:28:28] you speak into the corridors of our
[2:28:30] lives in so many different ways. The
[2:28:34] beckonings of your spirit, the dealings
[2:28:36] of your presence, your word has mean
[2:28:39] meant so much to us at this junction in
[2:28:42] our time of life. And for Terara, Lord,
[2:28:45] that has walked almost 19 years on this
[2:28:48] earth for the certain season, the
[2:28:51] certain time when the message would come
[2:28:53] by her way. There's been others, some
[2:28:55] have already gone on to their reward and
[2:28:58] others still linger that she's been with
[2:29:00] in middle school and through high school
[2:29:03] and even working. There's a reason why
[2:29:05] you've dealt with her in this way. And
[2:29:07] Lord, we're just praying together as a
[2:29:09] body of believers that you would fill
[2:29:12] Tara with the Holy Ghost. That as she's
[2:29:15] repented, she desires to give her life
[2:29:17] to you. That you would come to her at
[2:29:20] this time and pour yourself into her
[2:29:22] life. what natural mother and father,
[2:29:26] even a church could not do for her. May
[2:29:29] you do for our sister Tara. May you
[2:29:32] satisfy the longing, the aching, the
[2:29:35] soul's cry, as we heard this morning,
[2:29:38] the word that she's been hearing has
[2:29:40] been matching that soul's thirst. And I
[2:29:43] pray from this moment on, as she sought
[2:29:45] to take on your name in baptism, she
[2:29:48] understands that she's being married to
[2:29:50] you. that you Lord from this moment
[2:29:53] would draw closer, nearer, not just
[2:29:57] around her but inside of her soul. Bless
[2:30:00] her today God. In the name of Jesus
[2:30:03] Christ, we commit Tara to you. Thank
[2:30:06] you, Jesus. Amen.
[2:30:09] Amen. Sister Tara, according to your
[2:30:12] desire and your thirst for more of God
[2:30:16] and just responding to his dealings in
[2:30:18] your life, I baptize you in true
[2:30:20] Christian baptism in the name of our
[2:30:23] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[2:30:40] Why don't you stand with me?
[2:30:44] I've been changed. We just sang it.
[2:30:45] Let's sing it again.
[2:30:48] I've been changed
[2:30:50] and I've been reborn.
[2:30:53] All my life has been
[2:31:07] God has been changed.
[2:31:10] Why don't you turn around, shake hands
[2:31:11] with as many as you can while we sing it
[2:31:13] again? I've been changed
[2:31:16] and I've been reborn
[2:31:19] all my life.
[2:31:30] My life God has been changed.
[2:31:35] And with that, we dismiss you in Jesus
[2:31:37] name. We'll see you this evening.
[2:31:39] Brother Tom Ray will be bringing the
[2:31:41] word some more of the breath of God.
[2:31:44] Hallelujah. You're dismissed in Jesus
[2:31:46] name. Amen.
