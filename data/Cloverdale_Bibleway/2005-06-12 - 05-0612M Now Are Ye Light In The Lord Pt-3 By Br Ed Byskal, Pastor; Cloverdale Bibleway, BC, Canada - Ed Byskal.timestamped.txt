[0:11] [Music]
[0:23] I don't know.
[0:29] [Music]
[0:39] Oh.
[0:42] [Music]
[0:56] Hey. Hey.
[0:57] [Music]
[1:48] this week. Not a long time, but I was
[1:50] only there for a couple of days. But I
[1:52] can tell you that I don't know that I've
[1:55] had
[1:56] as supernatural a two days as I've ever
[1:58] had in my life there. And um
[2:03] we uh
[2:08] I still to this this point in time I
[2:10] mean I I uh I was standing in front of
[2:13] on a platform with uh
[2:17] some people from uh a Jewish
[2:19] organization that we're doing some work
[2:21] with. And the reason I was over there
[2:23] was specifically for spiritual reasons.
[2:26] And uh there's a group of people that
[2:28] they call themselves
[2:30] which is the first word in the Old
[2:33] Testament in the beginning. And they're
[2:35] working to try to bring the Jewish
[2:37] people back, restore them to their
[2:39] original faith.
[2:42] And uh
[2:45] so Rabbi led a prayer and I can tell you
[2:48] when it was done I mean I was very moved
[2:51] and I said I could I I can testify to
[2:54] you this morning that as brother
[2:56] Brandham said Holy Spirit you know we're
[2:59] in the we're in the days of the Gentiles
[3:00] is over and the Holy Spirit is moving
[3:03] and anointing the Jewish people and I
[3:06] certainly have seen that could testify
[3:08] with my own eyes and when it was done
[3:10] you know you look for things
[3:13] that uh
[3:16] you know that God's been with you. You
[3:18] know that you're just looking for that
[3:20] little, you know, vindication. Lord, is
[3:23] is this you? Is this really you? And I
[3:26] was heading to the airport. The guy
[3:28] picked me up at 3:15 in the morning to
[3:31] go down to the airport. And I'd uh I'
[3:34] I'd met him the day before, Jewish cab
[3:36] driver. Uh and he knew the people that
[3:39] we were visiting with. So he said, "Uh,
[3:41] look, I'll come pick you up in the
[3:42] morning." And, uh, I said, "Well, that'd
[3:45] be great." So, we started heading out
[3:48] and they were driving down. He was
[3:50] asking about what we were doing. So, I
[3:51] told him, um, and I said, "But, you
[3:53] know, we're not we're not Jewish, you
[3:55] know, we're we're uh Christians." And he
[3:58] said, and he his his head snapped
[4:00] around. He looked at me. He said, "Are
[4:02] you a believer?"
[4:04] And I said, "Yeah, I am." He said, "Uh,
[4:07] I became a Christian a couple years ago.
[4:09] We meet with a few people. It's about 48
[4:11] people we've got. We meet about a half
[4:13] an hour out of Jerusalem. And he said,
[4:16] "Where are you from?" I said, "From
[4:18] Canada." He reached up, picked up a
[4:21] little card out. He said, "Do you know
[4:23] this lady?" And uh and I mean, I
[4:26] couldn't hardly believe it because it
[4:28] was a lady I work with in my office. And
[4:31] uh I said, "In fact, I'm flying a plane
[4:33] right now to Brussels to go meet her and
[4:34] and uh and my boss." And uh that's where
[4:38] I'm headed to Brussels. And uh he said,
[4:41] "Well, I can't believe this. This is
[4:42] just wonderful." And so we fellowshipped
[4:44] over the word the whole time. Uh I went
[4:46] out there and I asked him, I said, "You
[4:48] know, how's your tree?" He says, "It's
[4:49] tough. It's really tough." But he said,
[4:51] "You know, I know God's helped me." I
[4:53] said, "Do you need any help?" He said,
[4:54] "No." He said, "It's tough, but we're
[4:56] doing fine. I mean, a real man of
[4:58] character and uh so I don't think this
[5:00] is any coincidence." Gave me his card
[5:02] and uh we're going to be in contact. and
[5:05] uh he jumped out of his cab, gave me a
[5:07] big hug. He said, "God bless you." It's
[5:09] just wonderful to see another Christian.
[5:11] And I mean, there's not very many
[5:12] Christian Jews over there. So, I just I
[5:15] walked out walked into the airport
[5:17] knowing this was just a vindication. God
[5:20] had been there and we're just we're just
[5:21] so thankful for his hand. And I was
[5:24] singing this little song. We we don't
[5:26] know it, but I got uh I taught it to
[5:29] Sister Linda this morning. You know, the
[5:31] Bible says they that are led of the Holy
[5:33] Spirit, they are the sons of God. And as
[5:36] I was walking over there, I just became
[5:40] very conscious of the fact that God was
[5:42] leading. And if you know this song, you
[5:45] can you can sing it. But these words
[5:48] were just going over and over in my
[5:50] head. Step by step, you'll lead me and I
[5:52] will follow you all of my days. May we
[5:54] can stand together. If you know the
[5:55] song, you can help me.

[6:03] and I will ever praise you.

[24:41] get himself out of the way and help us
[24:44] Lord God. We are needy. We need to get
[24:46] ourselves out of the way, Father, Lord,
[24:48] that we'd put our thoughts aside, the
[24:51] rest of the day, the things that we
[24:53] think we must do, Lord, but how
[24:54] important it is, dear God, just to sit
[24:56] at your feet this morning and to take it
[24:58] all in, Lord, like Mary did, sitting at
[25:01] the feet of Jesus. So, Lord, we pray
[25:03] that you'll be with us now, Lord, as we
[25:05] desire to create an atmosphere, Father,
[25:07] that you'd be pleased to dwell in,
[25:09] Father, that you'd be pleased to come
[25:12] into our midst. just ask your blessings
[25:15] upon the remainder of the service, Lord.
[25:17] Each prayer request and each heart,
[25:19] Lord, we pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[25:21] Amen.

[29:25] Always running running away
[29:29] from your love when it calls
[29:34] just to cry bitter tears all the low.

[30:23] Lord will come to claim his own. I want
[30:28] to be one
[30:30] that he finds standing true.
[30:36] I want to hear him say, "Well done.

[30:54] &gt;&gt; Lord. Shine
[30:56] your light all around me
[31:03] so bright
[31:05] that I surely

[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:09] Praise the Lord. area. Stand right over
[34:13] here.
[34:22] Brother Brandham said it's uh concerning
[34:27] raising children and having having
[34:30] babies come into the world. He was
[34:33] saying that it's like uh didn't say it
[34:35] was like a revolving door, but something
[34:38] that's revolving. There's new ones
[34:40] coming and as new ones come some go off
[34:44] the scene or kind of fade out put out to
[34:47] pasture
[34:49] and uh I'm waiting for that pasture. I'm
[34:52] kind of looking over over the fence
[34:53] right now that pasture. Uh we have
[34:58] sister Roseanne and brother John
[35:00] McCafferty which of course is known to
[35:01] all. and they have their young one here,
[35:05] Justin Paul.
[35:08] And we're going to be dedicating him in
[35:10] a few moments. I want to I want to
[35:12] direct some comments to
[35:15] both the couples and then sister Liz and
[35:17] brother Gretchian Novacowski
[35:20] and they have their young one Katie Anne
[35:26] and Katie being in the Greek is pure and
[35:30] an in the Hebrew is meaning gracious.
[35:33] Now
[35:35] I think it's very wonderful that brother
[35:38] Gretchen's
[35:39] grandparents were able to come just
[35:41] arrived.
[35:43] So that's really wonderful.
[35:45] I want to uh address some thoughts and
[35:49] uh it's it's not only for those
[35:54] couples that are standing here but for
[35:56] all of us and I believe it's very very
[35:59] important and I would like to say to
[36:02] each of you according to the scripture
[36:06] you're building a home
[36:09] having children is building a house but
[36:12] it's not with mortar and bricks and
[36:16] lumber and nails. You're building it
[36:20] with a home and children provide
[36:22] something. They provide an opportunity
[36:26] for brother Brandon makes a big point of
[36:28] love.
[36:30] And he talked about children, he said
[36:33] when they when they scream and have a
[36:36] have a big fuss. Sister Roxan,
[36:39] he said what they really need is love.
[36:42] And he said, "You know, some some
[36:44] doctors, they call them like a witch
[36:46] doctor." He said, said, "Let that baby
[36:48] scream." No. He said, "Don't let grandma
[36:52] touch it." No. He said, "That's wrong.
[36:54] Hold it and embrace it and love it." And
[36:57] that's what they need. That's what they
[37:00] really need. And I know when couples get
[37:01] up here, they get so nervous over is it
[37:03] going to be good? Is it going to cry? Is
[37:04] it going to whatever. Well, if it ever
[37:06] does cry and scream according to the
[37:07] prophet's message, just love it more.
[37:11] do he said don't leave it lay there and
[37:13] just scream pick it up and love it and
[37:16] that's an opportunity for love that's
[37:17] all part of building a home and I think
[37:19] a home is actually built on love and uh
[37:22] what Solomon said through wisdom is a
[37:24] house built and by understanding it is
[37:26] established and raising children
[37:28] Gretchen sister Elizabeth
[37:31] brother John and sister Roseanne is a
[37:34] full-time job I don't need to tell you
[37:37] that but it's a full-time job it not
[37:40] only to be loved
[37:41] But it is an opportunity to train to
[37:45] train the child. And brother Brandham
[37:47] says we're just one by one we're
[37:49] revolving down just like pilgrims
[37:52] traveling through.
[37:54] And uh and Solomon also said that we
[37:59] need to train up a child in the way that
[38:01] he should go and when he's old he'll not
[38:03] depart from it.
[38:06] These are our I think a real privilege
[38:09] and honor that we have today. And the
[38:11] Bible is really your precise book of
[38:14] instruction for raising of a child.
[38:18] And uh I just have another quote here
[38:21] I'd like to refer to.
[38:26] Brother Brandham referred to Moses is
[38:28] Dr. for Moses.
[38:31] And he said, "We really need his
[38:35] satchel.
[38:36] We really need his briefcase." Cuz he
[38:39] said, "There were a lot of babies born
[38:41] in 2 million the night they left to go
[38:45] into the wilderness." And every day
[38:48] there was a lot of children born when
[38:50] they went into the wilderness. And he
[38:53] said, "But in his satchel he had he had
[38:56] some prescriptions." And I thought of
[38:58] you two couples this morning. You will
[39:01] need what he had in his satchel as a
[39:05] prescription. When these children are
[39:08] not well, I am the Lord that health
[39:11] thee. And the instruction of the word of
[39:14] God that was given to Dr. Moses is still
[39:17] the same prescription today. And you
[39:20] have the best medical book. You have the
[39:22] best instruction book there is in the
[39:24] world right here. And so may God bless
[39:28] you as mothers and fathers with the
[39:31] prescription book of the of the word of
[39:34] God and that which Moses had. Amen. I'm
[39:37] going to take Justin Paul. Now
[39:42] you're going to come to me Justin. Of
[39:45] course you going to be a preacher.
[39:49] It's a microphone.
[39:51] Might use that someday.
[39:55] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, for Justin
[39:59] Paul, we lift him up as your prophet
[40:02] said. We lift him up. We lift these
[40:04] children up to bless them in the name of
[40:07] the Lord Jesus Christ. And as you, oh
[40:10] God, have given them, given Justin Paul
[40:13] to my brother John and sister Roseanne,
[40:16] now as I lay my hand upon him, I pray
[40:18] that you'll keep him in health, watch
[40:21] over him. I dedicate him to you in the
[40:24] name of Jesus Christ.
[40:26] Watch over him all his days and on that
[40:30] day he will gather with us. Hallelujah.
[40:34] And the circle shall not be broken in
[40:37] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[40:41] Hey Justin,
[40:44] God bless him. God bless you, Sister
[40:47] Rosanne. God bless you, brother John.
[40:51] Katie Anne,
[40:57] is this your first one?
[41:01] I I knew that, but I just thought I'd
[41:03] ask anyway.
[41:06] Amen. So wonderful that
[41:10] brother Gretchen's grandparents are here
[41:13] and uh so as this child's grandparents
[41:17] on both sides
[41:20] are here with us this morning. So we're
[41:22] going to lift Katie up to the Lord in
[41:25] prayer. Lord, I am holding this treasure
[41:29] that you have given. You have deposited
[41:32] this treasure into the home of Sister
[41:34] Liz and brother Gretchen.
[41:37] You gave her to them because you believe
[41:40] that they would instruct her right. And
[41:43] I pray that they will take oh God the
[41:47] prescription that was given and that Dr.
[41:51] Moses had when this child oh God no
[41:55] doubt at there'll be some time it's
[41:57] upset may not be well may be attacked
[42:00] physically then may they take the
[42:03] prescription I am the Lord that health
[42:05] thee God I pray that they will take the
[42:09] instruction of the word of God and pass
[42:11] it on to this child may this child be
[42:14] loved father may it be watched over and
[42:18] provided for and I know that it will. I
[42:20] have confidence in the mother and
[42:22] father. I pray father now you'll receive
[42:25] as I dedicate Katie and to you in the
[42:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Bless her
[42:31] with bless her with good health. Bless
[42:34] her in the name of Jesus Christ. I pray
[42:36] with salvation at the time when it
[42:39] becomes accountable of its own life and
[42:41] decisions. And we commit her to you now.
[42:44] and may she always have the peace that
[42:46] she's experiencing at this moment in
[42:49] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[42:52] Amen.
[42:55] God bless you, Gretchen. You're learning
[42:57] how to hold her.
[43:02] God bless these parents. Amen.
[43:11] I uh
[43:14] we we were really blessed to have a
[43:18] attend the graduation
[43:21] of our graduating class this year. And
[43:25] uh I wonder if the grad graduates that
[43:28] are present if they could stand please
[43:30] where they are.
[43:36] Two.
[43:39] All right. How How many are we here?
[43:42] One, two,
[43:44] four, five, 6 7 8 9. All right. I'm
[43:49] going to ask you to do something else.
[43:50] I'm going to ask you to come down here
[43:52] in front.
[43:55] Now, the reason I did that is because
[43:57] some of them don't want to do that. We
[43:59] had uh
[44:02] nine of young brothers
[44:07] and uh three
[44:10] of the sisters
[44:13] had been a really a fine class. I want I
[44:16] want the congregation I mean this
[44:17] congregation you know you you weren't
[44:19] able all to be there of course
[44:32] okay I guess everyone wasn't able to be
[44:35] here who are we missing
[44:40] it
[44:42] &gt;&gt; oh Stephen Okay.
[44:45] Yes, that's right. All right. Well, this
[44:48] is part of them. There's a couple that
[44:51] are missing. I want I want you to know
[44:54] these students are
[44:57] my they're accomplished.
[45:00] They had the things laid out that they
[45:02] did and their achievements and
[45:04] everything else. And it just made me
[45:06] despondent reading it.
[45:10] where they're going and their ambition
[45:12] and what they've already achieved. It's
[45:15] been really wonderful. But the other
[45:17] thing is which I think was really
[45:20] remarkable is that every one of them had
[45:23] something in their
[45:25] uh future ambition that had something to
[45:28] do with serving God and serving Christ.
[45:32] And I want the congregation to sing uh
[45:35] with us. All that I have and all that I
[45:39] am. And we're singing that. And I want
[45:42] you graduates to think about it. Not all
[45:45] that you are right now. You got students
[45:48] here that are just so diligent.
[45:52] And I can say one more thing.
[45:55] Not very many, not very many have been
[45:59] birthed and raised under the sound of
[46:02] this voice, this message. And you young
[46:05] people are so privileged. And I pray
[46:08] that this will be a dedication of your
[46:10] lives as well. All that I have and all
[46:13] that I am and all that I ever can be.
[46:19] All that I am.
[46:23] All I
[46:26] am,
[46:28] all
[46:30] I shall ever
[46:37] can not repay
[46:41] the love that I
[46:46] [Music]
[46:49] surrender.
[46:52] Just once more as a prayer. Would you
[46:54] sing it with me? All that I am,
[47:00] all that I am,
[47:05] all
[47:06] I shall ever
[47:09] be.
[47:13] It cannot
[47:16] be made
[47:18] the blood that I
[47:21] [Music]
[47:25] surrender
[47:27] to thee.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; I'd like if you students would just turn
[47:32] around, face me if you would. I'd like
[47:34] the congregation to bow your head if you
[47:36] would with me. I want to pray for each
[47:39] one of you.
[47:43] Almighty God,
[47:46] these moments
[47:49] are not to be taken lightly.
[47:53] These moments, this moment, Lord, will
[47:56] not perhaps occur again just like it is
[48:00] now with these young men and young
[48:03] ladies that are standing here.
[48:06] Father, as I spoke to them the other
[48:09] night,
[48:11] I know that at one point or another,
[48:15] while they move through life,
[48:19] while they have been in their schools
[48:22] and in their places of learning, some
[48:25] have been homeschooled,
[48:28] but they each one have spent many, many
[48:30] hours and days
[48:33] here in the house of God
[48:36] listening to a message.
[48:39] Each one of them have a Bible and they
[48:41] have read your word.
[48:45] At some point in time, Lord, I believe
[48:48] you have already cast the mantle of the
[48:52] word upon them.
[48:55] Something was different at that moment
[48:58] and they can never be the same. And I
[49:01] pray, Father, if it has not taken place,
[49:05] that you will indeed do so.
[49:08] I ask that you will guide them with a
[49:10] supernatural light. I pray that you'll
[49:13] protect them and watch over them. And oh
[49:17] God, preserve them from the wounds and
[49:19] the scars of the world and the enemy.
[49:22] And may they ever, oh God, take the few
[49:26] simple words of this course, all that
[49:29] they have, all that they are, and all
[49:32] that they ever will be, let it be
[49:35] dedicated to you from this day forward
[49:38] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God
[49:43] bless each one of you. God bless you.
[49:46] God bless you. Amen. God bless you. God
[49:49] bless you. You may be may go to your
[49:52] seats now. Allan, God bless you. God
[49:54] bless you. Bless you, Rebecca. God bless
[49:58] you.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; We've got time for these things.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:13] Our
[50:17] trustees are we've had
[50:22] uh
[50:24] very very wonderful trustees that have
[50:27] borne a lot of responsibility here for
[50:29] the church. There's so much that happens
[50:32] on behind the scenes and they were
[50:34] feeling a need of of adding some
[50:37] trustees to the board just to help us
[50:40] and assist in the kind of work and the
[50:43] amount of work that we have to do. And
[50:44] so we have added three and the
[50:49] uh process
[50:51] the trustees felt certain brethren on
[50:55] their heart and and I felt also likewise
[50:59] and I approached these brothers three of
[51:01] them brother Jim Douly, brother Chris
[51:05] Peterson
[51:07] and brother John Briner and we asked if
[51:11] they would pray about it and some of
[51:12] them prayed for quite an extended period
[51:15] of time and we just waited. Nothing was
[51:17] rushed and if they should feel the
[51:20] confirmation to serve in that capacity
[51:24] and each of them have agreed to do so.
[51:27] And I would like to recognize those
[51:29] brothers if they would please stand.
[51:32] Brother Jim Douly where do we have
[51:35] brother John please? And I wonder a few
[51:38] brothers would come down if you would if
[51:40] you would please. We'd like to have a
[51:44] word of prayer. Is Brother Wayne here?
[51:48] Brother Wayne Coral?
[51:50] Yes, brother Wayne. I wonder if you and
[51:52] Brother Bob, Brother Ken, Brother Rod
[51:54] would uh join these brethren here.
[51:58] We've actually only met once
[52:01] uh officially and now I would like the
[52:04] congregation because many of you perhaps
[52:07] are newer and maybe don't even know who
[52:09] serve in this capacity. But these
[52:12] brethren put a lot of hours and a lot of
[52:15] time and bear a lot of burdens
[52:18] and they make decisions on behalf of the
[52:20] congregation to be
[52:23] stewards of God's house. And I can say
[52:28] that if you can see the church is not in
[52:31] debt.
[52:34] The
[52:36] uh the church itself is debt-free.
[52:40] The properties which have have been
[52:43] added to two homes have been paid for
[52:47] and have been a a continual blessing.
[52:51] the school is not in debt
[52:55] and uh the church as a church you have
[52:58] funds in the bank. We've tried to be
[53:01] real astute. The missions and I can tell
[53:05] you it it I'm moved this morning. The
[53:08] missions is incredible. Just absolutely
[53:11] incredible.
[53:13] It's not in debt. It ran at a deficit
[53:15] last year because we of the additional
[53:19] places where we felt to h help people
[53:23] that are less fortunate than us. And so
[53:26] we've taken from the tithes of the
[53:29] church to give the word out to others in
[53:32] other countries and I believe that would
[53:34] be honorable.
[53:36] But everything is paid for and you
[53:40] people are debtree.
[53:42] And if and when God if God should call
[53:45] me and if my heart should stop and I
[53:48] should be called, I want you to know by
[53:51] God's grace and by the
[53:54] uh
[53:56] burden of these men. I've been able to
[53:59] go to them. I've called them at any time
[54:02] whoever I call and they will make
[54:03] themselves available quite often. Some
[54:06] of them are out of town. Brother Ken
[54:08] travels quite a bit. Brother Rod
[54:10] travels, Brother Jim travels. But we
[54:12] need it so we can have three or four so
[54:15] we can call on them to help us. And
[54:18] actually, they're helping you is what
[54:21] they're doing. Caring for the church.
[54:23] So, I just want the congregation. We
[54:24] very, very rarely do this. And I don't
[54:26] think I've ever done it quite like this.
[54:29] But I'm thankful to God for men whose
[54:31] lives are dedicated and freely give
[54:34] themselves in their time and their
[54:36] effort and their own at their own
[54:38] expense often. So I think we could stand
[54:41] and together
[54:45] and I'd like you to join with me
[54:46] hearttoheart if you would and thank God
[54:49] for God giving us brothers such as we
[54:51] have.
[54:53] Almighty God,
[54:56] we are so thankful that you have brought
[55:02] individuals into the kingdom of God that
[55:05] have a heart and a desire to serve you
[55:08] in various capacities. And as your
[55:10] prophet said, not all can be ministers
[55:13] and not all are deacons and not all are
[55:16] trustees, but we all have a place. We
[55:20] all contribute. We all, oh God, are
[55:24] members of the body of Christ.
[55:27] This morning, Lord, I want to ask your
[55:30] special
[55:32] grace upon these brethren that are
[55:34] trustees.
[55:35] And may they ever serve, oh Lord, your
[55:39] bride, your body, your blood purchased
[55:42] people. Serve them, oh God, with dignity
[55:46] and with integrity, with sincerity.
[55:50] Lord, I pray their lives continue to be
[55:53] consecrated and may their love for your
[55:56] word intensify and increase. Oh God, I
[55:59] pray the spirit of revelation and wisdom
[56:02] will be upon them. And when they're
[56:04] called upon to make decisions, may the
[56:06] Holy Ghost give them the gift of wisdom,
[56:08] Lord, they might know what is the
[56:11] correct choice and the correct decision.
[56:14] We thank you as a congregation. And now
[56:16] Lord, as we soon will be turning to your
[56:18] word, we ask your blessing upon the
[56:20] word. We ask your blessing upon all that
[56:23] are all that are uh uh active at this
[56:26] moment so that others around the globe
[56:28] and around the world can hear. Lord, I
[56:32] pray that you'll bless those that are
[56:33] listening this morning and streaming. I
[56:36] pray that you'll bless our sister Marge
[56:37] Miller. Oh God, I pray that your
[56:40] presence will fill the room, Lord, with
[56:43] a holy, holy, sacred light, oh God. And
[56:47] I pray you'll fill her body, Lord, with
[56:50] a resurrection virtue, the token
[56:53] evidence of the resurrection, Lord.
[56:55] We're asking you raise her up, oh God.
[56:58] Dry up, oh God, the tumors in the name
[57:00] of Jesus Christ. May that perverted life
[57:03] deceased, oh God, and be separated from
[57:06] her in the name of Christ. And all
[57:08] others who might be in need. I pray, oh
[57:11] Lord, this meeting will be an unusual
[57:13] meeting and that you'll meet with us in
[57:15] a special way. In Jesus Christ's name,
[57:18] bless, oh God, our conversation together
[57:22] and our fellowship and the service this
[57:24] morning, now and tonight. In your name
[57:26] we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[57:29] brothers. Thank you so much.
[57:40] Wonder if we can just sing together.
[57:42] What we have is a pillar of fire. Did
[57:44] John Jonathan and Sarah get back?
[57:47] Jonathan and Sarah
[57:48] &gt;&gt; not here yet.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; They're not here yet. All right. What we
[57:53] have is the pill of fire.
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] church again
[58:07] to
[58:12] us.
[58:15] [Applause]
[58:17] So he will resurrect his
[58:23] so
[58:26] [Music]
[58:28] what we have is the pill of fire.
[58:39] We're going to sing it one more time but
[58:41] just before we do couple more things.
[58:44] our brother Morris and sister Glattis
[58:46] Cochrell.
[58:48] Uh they
[58:50] feel led. I don't know if I feel led,
[58:53] but they feel led. They're going back,
[58:56] moving back to New Brunswick.
[58:58] They have family in the east in Toronto
[59:02] and also New Brunswick. They're burdened
[59:04] for their family. When they came here
[59:06] several years ago, they told their f
[59:08] children that we, well, we might go for
[59:10] a year. And now they've been here, I
[59:12] don't know, several years, about six I
[59:14] think. And now they're on their way
[59:17] back. We're going to miss them.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; And uh but they said, "We're not leaving
[59:22] the church.
[59:24] This is our church. And we will be
[59:27] streaming every service." I uh get a get
[59:31] a real wide band and a fast cable or
[59:34] whatever it takes so you can be right
[59:36] with us and we'll be thinking of you all
[59:38] the time. God bless you and give you a
[59:40] safe journey. And we had a thanks from
[59:43] brother
[59:45] uh brother Paul Neighbor and sister
[59:48] Heidi
[59:49] uh because uh they wanted to thank the
[59:53] congregation for all the prayers that
[59:56] have been lifted up on behalf of Sister
[59:58] Heidi and she's doing well. So God bless
[1:00:02] you for that. Next week, this next week,
[1:00:05] would you please I would ask you to be
[1:00:07] please mindful on u Thursday, Friday,
[1:00:12] Saturday and Sunday. Thursday, Friday,
[1:00:15] Saturday are going to be like all day
[1:00:18] uh events that are taking place, studies
[1:00:21] and uh and s messages and services
[1:00:25] that'll be taking place in in Serbia.
[1:00:29] And I just have received this letter on
[1:00:32] email and I want to share just a little
[1:00:34] bit of it with you. This actually came
[1:00:37] from not from Serbia but from another
[1:00:40] country in Europe. And this is what I
[1:00:43] said. I have heard you plan to visit ex
[1:00:46] Yugoslavia.
[1:00:48] I was moved to write you a few words
[1:00:51] again.
[1:00:52] With a few lines, I desire to express my
[1:00:55] thoughts to greet you in the name of our
[1:00:58] savior Jesus Christ. Thanks again for
[1:01:01] all you have done for the people in
[1:01:03] former Yugoslavia, for helping the small
[1:01:06] groups of faith on the Balkan, and for
[1:01:09] supporting so many families in need. May
[1:01:13] the Lord recompense to you that selfless
[1:01:16] devotment and all those years you and
[1:01:20] your fellows have invested in that small
[1:01:23] spot of land.
[1:01:26] That's to you. It might be you have gone
[1:01:30] through many sleeplessness sleepless
[1:01:32] nights and also through painful
[1:01:35] experiences considering that land. But
[1:01:38] one thing I would like you not to
[1:01:40] forget, there are a few men and women, a
[1:01:44] few families who love you because of
[1:01:47] that and are still carrying on in their
[1:01:49] prayers. Thank you for all. It was worth
[1:01:53] every effort because those brothers and
[1:01:56] sisters, me and my family included,
[1:02:01] found Christ through the endurance and
[1:02:04] love you brought in that message.
[1:02:07] I hope it will be a small and sweet uh
[1:02:10] reward for you looking into people who
[1:02:14] fall in love with Christ through that
[1:02:18] message and I hope you will enjoy the
[1:02:21] trip and sojourn with those nice people
[1:02:24] in unionizing the body of Christ. Shalom
[1:02:28] my brother. Uh never stop preaching the
[1:02:32] truth for only the truth sets us free.
[1:02:34] Thank you for doing it.
[1:02:36] and he closes will walk in the light,
[1:02:39] the beautiful light where the dew drops
[1:02:42] of mercy.
[1:02:44] Amen. Is it worth it? It's worth every
[1:02:46] bit of it.
[1:02:48] All right. We're going to have you turn
[1:02:50] in your Bible if you would to First John
[1:02:57] uh first chapter
[1:03:02] and we'll just read uh some verses
[1:03:04] starting with verse 5.
[1:03:11] This then is the message which we have
[1:03:14] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:03:17] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:03:21] at all. If we say that we have
[1:03:23] fellowship with him and walk in
[1:03:26] darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
[1:03:29] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:03:32] the light, we have fellowship one with
[1:03:34] another. And the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:03:37] his son cleanseth us from all sin. I
[1:03:41] will just read this while you're
[1:03:42] standing. In John 12:36, while you have
[1:03:46] light, believe in the light that you may
[1:03:50] be the children of light. These things
[1:03:53] spake Jesus and departed and did hide
[1:03:56] himself from them. Walk in light while
[1:03:59] you have the light. And then in
[1:04:01] Ephesians which is our inheritance
[1:04:04] chapter
[1:04:06] chapter 5 and verse 8.
[1:04:09] For ye where sometimes darkness but now
[1:04:13] are ye light in the Lord. Walk as
[1:04:16] children of light. And that is the title
[1:04:20] of these messages. This is a part three
[1:04:22] of now you are light in the Lord. And
[1:04:26] then also Ephesians 5 and 15. So then,
[1:04:31] so then they, so then that ye walk
[1:04:34] circumspectly. See then, I'm sorry. See
[1:04:37] then that you walk cir circumspectly,
[1:04:40] not as fools, but as wise. Amen. You may
[1:04:44] be seated.
[1:04:49] There's considerable in the scripture
[1:04:51] concerning walking, and I'm going to
[1:04:53] just give a couple more scriptures if
[1:04:55] you're jotting it down. 1 Corinthians
[1:04:58] 5:17.
[1:05:00] But as God hath distributed to every
[1:05:02] man, as the Lord hath called everyone,
[1:05:06] how many? Everyone. There's not a person
[1:05:09] here excluded. You cannot isolate
[1:05:12] yourself and say, "Well, I'm not part of
[1:05:14] that." You are part of that if you are a
[1:05:17] believer. And uh it says that God has
[1:05:21] distributed to every man as the Lord
[1:05:23] hath called everyone. So let him walk
[1:05:28] and so ordain I in all the churches.
[1:05:30] Apostle Paul said in Colossians
[1:05:34] uh Paul said as you have therefore
[1:05:36] received Christ Jesus
[1:05:39] so walk ye in him. However you received
[1:05:43] him when you received him you remember
[1:05:45] that time. You remember the freshness.
[1:05:49] You remember how how wonderful it was.
[1:05:51] You remember how pure everything was.
[1:05:54] I've seen I've heard people say the
[1:05:55] grass was greener, the flowers were
[1:05:58] brighter, the the smell and the
[1:06:00] fragrance was just wonderful. Everything
[1:06:02] was so fresh when I came. So walk
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; continue in it.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; It's it it is intended to be that way.
[1:06:12] And he said in Romans, "Therefore, we
[1:06:14] are buried with him by baptism into
[1:06:17] death, and we are having baptism
[1:06:19] tonight."
[1:06:20] Uh we're so thankful for the young
[1:06:24] people as they get baptized. I don't
[1:06:26] know if you know it and I don't know if
[1:06:28] you can appreciate it as much as we
[1:06:31] should. I don't know whether I can
[1:06:33] appreciate it as much as I should. But
[1:06:35] when I
[1:06:37] consider the number of young men and
[1:06:41] young women and children, do you know
[1:06:44] that there's close to 300 in this church
[1:06:48] from the juniors and the seniors? The
[1:06:50] junior camp is about 130 and the senior
[1:06:53] camp's about 130. And that happens to be
[1:06:57] uh uh
[1:06:59] uh something that has been achieved by
[1:07:03] no one other than God himself.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; And God must have a plan. And that is
[1:07:09] why service after service, I always find
[1:07:12] that there's a there's an element of a
[1:07:15] service regardless of what the meeting
[1:07:17] is like. There's an element of that is
[1:07:19] pointed right towards the young men and
[1:07:22] young women and the young uh element of
[1:07:26] the of the congregation. And I want you
[1:07:29] to know I think that that is wonderful.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Absolutely wonderful.
[1:07:35] And so we are buried with him in
[1:07:36] baptism. And like as Christ was raised
[1:07:39] up from the dead by the glory of the
[1:07:42] father, even so also
[1:07:44] uh we also should walk in newness of
[1:07:48] life. Paul said again in Romans 8:1
[1:07:52] therefore
[1:07:55] now there is therefore now no
[1:07:58] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:08:01] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:08:04] after the spirit. In 2 Corinthians 5:7
[1:08:07] he said, "For we walk by faith and not
[1:08:10] by sight." How many can say amen to
[1:08:12] that? We walk by faith. You've
[1:08:14] experienced it. And not by sight. And
[1:08:17] Ephesians once again and walk in love.
[1:08:21] This is not an option. This is a
[1:08:23] commandment. Walk in love. Would God
[1:08:26] require something of us if it was not
[1:08:29] possible? No. He has has made this
[1:08:32] absolutely within our reach and possible
[1:08:36] to us. And furthermore, it's your
[1:08:38] inheritance. And walk in love as Christ
[1:08:41] also hath loved us and hath given
[1:08:43] himself for us as an offering and
[1:08:45] sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling
[1:08:48] savor.
[1:08:50] And uh repeat again, if we walk in the
[1:08:53] light as he is in the light, then we
[1:08:56] have fellowship one with another and the
[1:08:58] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[1:09:01] us from all sin. There are six words in
[1:09:05] the New Testament in the Greek in the
[1:09:07] New Testament there are six Greek words
[1:09:11] which refer to walk which are used for
[1:09:14] the word one English word walk and it's
[1:09:17] very significant these six words but in
[1:09:20] this case if we walk in the light as he
[1:09:24] is in the light John uses the one word
[1:09:27] and it it actually encompasses the
[1:09:31] entire realm
[1:09:33] of of our spiritual walk and our
[1:09:36] spiritual life. The particular word
[1:09:38] which he used and the word which he used
[1:09:42] I found was very very unique and the
[1:09:47] reason why I found it was so unique was
[1:09:50] because it comes from uh several other
[1:09:54] uh several other words.
[1:09:56] It has a very very unique uh part of it.
[1:10:01] Just give me a moment here. Uh,
[1:10:08] and it has it it comes from a very
[1:10:12] diverse root meanings and I want you to
[1:10:15] get it. I'd like to have had it in a
[1:10:16] PowerPoint, but I just didn't have
[1:10:18] sufficient time to do it. It's so much
[1:10:21] clearer when it can be visual for you.
[1:10:24] But in in the in the the word itself is
[1:10:29] simply to make one's way
[1:10:33] to make progress
[1:10:36] to make due use of opportunities
[1:10:42] to regulate one's life
[1:10:46] and to conduct oneself
[1:10:49] to pass one's life. So now I'll just
[1:10:53] review that for just a moment to make
[1:10:56] progress
[1:10:58] to take make and make use of
[1:11:01] opportunities as they're presented to
[1:11:03] you and to also regulate to have
[1:11:06] discipline in one's life
[1:11:10] and to conduct oneself
[1:11:13] as they pass through life. So the word
[1:11:16] it used encompassed all of our spiritual
[1:11:21] and what we might say natural because
[1:11:23] there's nothing natural to a spiritual
[1:11:25] person. I don't care what kind of work
[1:11:27] that you do. It's all within the realm
[1:11:31] of your spiritual life and your
[1:11:34] spiritual journey. But now then it comes
[1:11:36] from two very diverse root words that I
[1:11:40] want you to catch this. This is not a
[1:11:42] study as such but I want to establish
[1:11:44] this in order to be able to preach uh
[1:11:48] what what is really on my heart and I I
[1:11:50] was very very touched with these things.
[1:11:53] The first the first word is from
[1:11:58] and I just touched on it last last
[1:12:00] Sunday.
[1:12:02] The walk is not merely a walk but it is
[1:12:05] it is to tread down and to tread
[1:12:08] underfoot. It is uh it it has the whole
[1:12:11] connotation of of uh being victorious in
[1:12:15] struggle uh not giving up. This is not a
[1:12:19] you know this is not just a Sunday
[1:12:20] afternoon walk. This is a determined
[1:12:24] direction. And so we could say
[1:12:27] determined in in regulating one's life,
[1:12:31] determined in our conduct, determined in
[1:12:34] the opportunity that may be presented.
[1:12:36] Don't don't just run wild with
[1:12:38] opportunities or like we say on
[1:12:40] Wednesday night there may be a dark hole
[1:12:43] at the end which is a sephiler which has
[1:12:46] been prepared a trap a snare not all
[1:12:48] opportunities Satan he can cast he can
[1:12:52] cast roses in your pathway or thorns one
[1:12:55] or the other but if we keep constant
[1:12:59] with this in our mind that that we are
[1:13:02] going to progress we are going to move
[1:13:05] forward ward. Be it in opportunity, be
[1:13:08] it adversity, be it uh uh be it in
[1:13:12] health or be it in sickness or be it in
[1:13:15] plenty or be it in want or whatever it
[1:13:18] is, I'm going to make progress
[1:13:21] spiritually. Nothing is going to move me
[1:13:23] from this goal. That's what Paul is
[1:13:25] talking about. Walk in in the light as
[1:13:29] he is in the light. And so then and then
[1:13:32] this uh the second part is
[1:13:36] now that that's the first part. All
[1:13:38] right. It's coming from that direction.
[1:13:40] We're treading down. It is to advance by
[1:13:44] setting the foot upon to to tread upon
[1:13:49] to encounter successfully
[1:13:51] the greatest perils the greatest perils
[1:13:55] of resistance. You've had resistance.
[1:13:58] And what Paul is saying, keep walking.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; We don't stop because you face
[1:14:04] resistance. You will face obstacles. The
[1:14:07] prophet said, you know, we're not called
[1:14:09] to a picnic. You are called to a battle.
[1:14:12] You young people that have just
[1:14:14] graduated. You're going to sail out into
[1:14:17] into uh the, you know, the future. But I
[1:14:21] can tell you, there are storms ahead.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Don't give up on the walk. You will have
[1:14:27] opportunities, but don't let the
[1:14:29] opportunities sideline you from the
[1:14:32] walk. Keep walking in the light. Because
[1:14:34] if you let Satan lead you by the nose,
[1:14:37] you'll find yourself in shadows. You'll
[1:14:40] find yourself cooling off and you'll
[1:14:42] find yourself soon in darkness.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; That's exactly if if he can have his
[1:14:48] way. He'll separate you off from the
[1:14:50] fellowship of God, from the word of God,
[1:14:52] and you'll be so busy and and that's the
[1:14:55] way the world is. The world is that way.
[1:14:57] But we need to, you know, reassess
[1:15:00] things every once in a while and
[1:15:01] reorganize things once in a while and
[1:15:04] regulate regulate our lives according to
[1:15:07] the word of God.
[1:15:09] And so that is the first. It's not only
[1:15:11] to walk. It's not only to make progress.
[1:15:13] Not only to regulate, not only to
[1:15:16] continue on in all circumstances of our
[1:15:18] life, but it is also now second.
[1:15:21] Secondly, it is to tread upon to be
[1:15:25] victorious. That is what that is the
[1:15:28] word that John has used. But I love this
[1:15:32] other root word. It's actually a couple
[1:15:39] that have to do with this walk. And the
[1:15:42] one is we are doing all of this because
[1:15:46] or on account of there's a there's
[1:15:50] another degree another angle to this.
[1:15:53] We're not just taking seizing upon
[1:15:56] opportunities, walking in the light as
[1:15:58] he is in the light. Uh uh facing our
[1:16:00] adversity or or maybe no adversity. We
[1:16:04] might have fine fine fair sailing for a
[1:16:07] while and just keep moving on. Don't let
[1:16:10] anything detract us. Don't let anything
[1:16:12] uh uh turn us aside. And we just keep
[1:16:15] moving on in a way that we know is
[1:16:17] pleasing to God. But we're doing all of
[1:16:19] that because
[1:16:21] or on account of. It's a one Greek word
[1:16:25] on account of. And the next one which
[1:16:28] that comes from is because the other
[1:16:32] side. We're doing that because of the
[1:16:35] other side. We're doing that. And that
[1:16:38] word actually comes from piercing
[1:16:40] through. We've got to pierce through.
[1:16:43] This is where it finally and that's
[1:16:44] where that's where the meaning of the
[1:16:46] word runs out. That runs out. We are
[1:16:49] walking in the light. We are conducting
[1:16:52] ourselves. We are fellowshipping in this
[1:16:55] word. Whether it's persecution or
[1:16:58] whether it's compliment, whatever it is,
[1:17:01] whatever the circumstance, we're doing
[1:17:04] it because on account of that there is a
[1:17:08] piercing through to the other side.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; There's a goal and that goal is on the
[1:17:14] other side. And now the word ends out of
[1:17:17] it runs out of meaning.
[1:17:19] And I can tell you friends, it runs out
[1:17:22] because when you pierce through to the
[1:17:23] other side, when you pierce through
[1:17:26] the curtain of time, when you pierce
[1:17:29] through from mortal to immortality,
[1:17:33] that's what it's all about here today.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; That is why you're sitting here. Now,
[1:17:41] you know, whether they be young people
[1:17:43] going to school or businessmen and
[1:17:45] business housewives bringing up the
[1:17:47] children, we're doing it all in service
[1:17:50] to God. And the whole purpose, the whole
[1:17:53] objective is to walk, continue to walk
[1:17:56] in the light. And the Apostle John is
[1:17:59] saying, and how well he knew, you're
[1:18:02] going to have to tread upon serpents.
[1:18:04] You're going to have to tread upon the
[1:18:06] neck of the enemy. You're going to have
[1:18:08] to have lots of opposition and you will
[1:18:11] have opposition. Every believer will
[1:18:13] have opposition. I believe every day
[1:18:16] there will you'll feel the powers of
[1:18:18] darkness and resistance. But we're not
[1:18:20] we're not concerned about that. We're
[1:18:22] walking in the light.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; And the reason why we're doing this
[1:18:29] because there's an on the other side.
[1:18:33] There's something on the other side when
[1:18:35] you've arrived there friends. And that's
[1:18:37] really what we're here for. That's what
[1:18:39] it's all about. When we have arrived
[1:18:42] there,
[1:18:44] I I don't know what it's going to be
[1:18:46] like exactly, but I can believe with
[1:18:49] everything that's in me, there's going
[1:18:51] to be a tremendous release as though
[1:18:54] I've arrived home.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a tremendous
[1:18:58] relaxation.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's going to be such a feeling
[1:19:02] of freedom,
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; such a feeling of liberty. The reality
[1:19:06] of the prophet said, "Realization of
[1:19:08] realization."
[1:19:10] I'm sure we're gonna scream out
[1:19:13] something. You're going to say
[1:19:15] something. I've arrived. You're going to
[1:19:18] say, "It's over. Hallelujah." You're
[1:19:21] going to thank God. Praise God. Thank
[1:19:23] God for Calvary. Thank God for my
[1:19:26] brothers and sisters. Thank God for the
[1:19:28] ministry. Thank God for whatever. Thank
[1:19:30] God for the messenger. Thank God for
[1:19:32] everything that he did. I've arrived.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; And that's where the word runs out.
[1:19:42] That's what it's all about.
[1:19:47] Brother Brandham tells about a king, one
[1:19:49] of the kings of England,
[1:19:52] and he said one night a saint baptized
[1:19:54] him.
[1:19:56] Baptized the next morning apparently
[1:19:58] after this had taken place. He said they
[1:20:00] were sitting by a fire
[1:20:02] and it was a great they had a great fire
[1:20:05] going on over a a great I guess said
[1:20:09] large mammoth big place where the logs
[1:20:12] were laying and the saint was trying to
[1:20:15] tell the king about God and a little
[1:20:19] sparrow finished his sermon because the
[1:20:23] sparrow in the nighttime
[1:20:26] flew into the dark and into the light
[1:20:30] and went back out into the light and
[1:20:32] into the dark. And the saint raised up
[1:20:35] and said to the king, "Where did he come
[1:20:38] from and where did he go?"
[1:20:42] And he stopped and he brother Brandham
[1:20:44] said,
[1:20:46] "That's what we want to know.
[1:20:50] Where did we come from?
[1:20:54] And what are we doing here?
[1:20:57] And where do we go from here?
[1:21:00] Now friends, those few those short three
[1:21:04] sentences
[1:21:07] encompasses every person.
[1:21:10] And whatever
[1:21:12] state you're in, if you're drawing
[1:21:15] breath in your body, this is what
[1:21:18] concerns us. Where did I come from?
[1:21:21] And what am I doing here? And where do I
[1:21:24] go when this is all over? And my counsel
[1:21:27] to you is that you take every word of
[1:21:29] the service this morning. And you see
[1:21:31] that every footstep is a determined
[1:21:34] footstep and stay in the light. And if
[1:21:37] you see it goes into the shadows, if you
[1:21:39] got a question about it or a doubt,
[1:21:40] remember a doubt, a doubt is a shadow.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And if you got one doubt and another
[1:21:45] doubt and another doubt, and that's
[1:21:47] exactly why Satan threw the serpent
[1:21:49] asked Eve a question because the
[1:21:52] question cast a shadow right away. And
[1:21:55] if people's got lives and and if your
[1:21:58] life is full of questions, what about
[1:22:00] this and why does that happen and why is
[1:22:01] that that way and why is that person
[1:22:03] this way and why is this? I say put away
[1:22:05] those questions. They only gender more
[1:22:08] questions and those questions gender
[1:22:11] more shadows and more darkness and
[1:22:14] you'll finally find a person walk and
[1:22:15] stumble in darkness. They're in
[1:22:17] confusion. But the believer, they have a
[1:22:20] certain assurance. What's assurance?
[1:22:23] It's light.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a confidence. It's a peace.
[1:22:29] It's a rest. To me, all of those are
[1:22:32] associated with light. And he and
[1:22:36] brother Brandham went on and I really
[1:22:38] felt moved as I spoke about this.
[1:22:42] He said some time ago
[1:22:45] he was out west
[1:22:47] and he was standing in a man's house and
[1:22:49] he'd been invited there for dinner.
[1:22:52] And the man said to him as as brother
[1:22:54] Brandham was in his house,
[1:22:57] Brother Brandham, the man said, "I see
[1:23:00] that you're
[1:23:03] you're interested in this sculptor, this
[1:23:05] sculp uh this uh it was a sculpture that
[1:23:10] he had over the fireplace."
[1:23:13] And he says, "Yes, I am."
[1:23:16] And it was a it wasn't a painting, but
[1:23:19] it was a a a sculpture of an old ox
[1:23:22] cart. It was covered. It was an old
[1:23:25] covered wagon with oxen and a man
[1:23:30] in front and a little boy sitting on the
[1:23:33] seat with his mother. And they were
[1:23:35] traveling.
[1:23:38] And he said, "That was my father and my
[1:23:40] mother.
[1:23:42] And the little boy on the seat is
[1:23:44] myself.
[1:23:46] He said, "We came here in that ox cart."
[1:23:51] But since then, we have so prospered.
[1:23:56] He said, "I want you to step out in the
[1:23:58] yard." Brother Bram, step out in the
[1:24:00] yard with him.
[1:24:02] He said, "I," Brother Bram said, I
[1:24:04] forget how many thousands of acres he
[1:24:07] owned.
[1:24:08] And the man said to him, he said,
[1:24:12] "I own the adjoining ranch to the west.
[1:24:17] I join I own the adjoining ranch to the
[1:24:19] south."
[1:24:21] And he said, "You see the smoke over
[1:24:23] there?" Yes, sir. That's a city. And I
[1:24:27] forget how much property he owned there.
[1:24:29] And he said, "I'm the president in the
[1:24:31] bank there."
[1:24:34] And telling me all that he had. Brother
[1:24:36] Ram said, "I listened for a while
[1:24:40] and I said, 'I would like to ask you one
[1:24:42] question, sir. You have pointed to the
[1:24:45] east and to the west, showing the
[1:24:49] ranches, and you pointed to the city."
[1:24:52] He said, "I would like to have you look
[1:24:54] this way and see and tell me how much
[1:24:58] you own up there."
[1:25:04] And he said that
[1:25:07] is the main thing.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; So folks, it's not what we achieve here.
[1:25:15] It's not what we can appoint to his
[1:25:17] accomplishments here. It's not what we
[1:25:20] gather or is gathered around us here.
[1:25:24] Whatever God gives you here. And he goes
[1:25:28] on to say,
[1:25:30] "This is a short stay here."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And how how thankful I am as I speak
[1:25:38] about the young people here, but I hear
[1:25:40] and brother Tom said mentioned at the
[1:25:43] graduation that they have already said
[1:25:45] 1,200 1,200
[1:25:48] students at graduation. 1,200 lives will
[1:25:52] be extinguished in their parties and
[1:25:56] thousands will be maimed and injured and
[1:25:59] whatever more and we have with one
[1:26:02] calamity after another. We hear of four
[1:26:05] being extinguished yesterday and burned
[1:26:08] beyond recognition
[1:26:11] and we hear of it all the time. You that
[1:26:14] have been raised up under the message, I
[1:26:18] tell you before God, you want to thank
[1:26:20] God you are where you are.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; And all of us here,
[1:26:25] what whatever, be it a a believing
[1:26:28] husband or a believing wife, you want to
[1:26:30] thank God that they're not out someplace
[1:26:33] in some bar or someplace. We ought to
[1:26:36] say, "Thanks be to God for the grace of
[1:26:39] God that's been poured out upon us."
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he say this is a short
[1:26:44] stay but that's an eternal stay there.
[1:26:49] This is a short one. And he goes on to
[1:26:52] say so I think we ought to consider
[1:26:54] where we're going for eternity.
[1:26:57] He said if we can supply
[1:27:00] that has to do with these things here
[1:27:02] and fix our families and so forth here
[1:27:06] on earth with homes, houses and comfort
[1:27:09] and education.
[1:27:11] That's the things we should do.
[1:27:15] But the one and the main things we
[1:27:17] should do, we leave undone till we get
[1:27:21] to the end of the road and drown
[1:27:23] ourselves in an eternity knowing nothing
[1:27:26] about God. Well, I know that that is not
[1:27:29] the case here for the most part. But I
[1:27:32] these messages and these things that are
[1:27:34] being said are not just for this moment
[1:27:37] but also for tomorrow and next week and
[1:27:40] whatever is before you. These are to be
[1:27:43] guiding lights to your future from here
[1:27:46] to up there. Amen.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; And we he when we get to the end of the
[1:27:52] road and I I say to this congregation
[1:27:54] and all that are listening to me today,
[1:27:56] we don't want to drown ourselves in an
[1:27:58] eternity without God about his plan of
[1:28:01] salvation and redeeming grace of Jesus
[1:28:04] Christ. He said it's pitiful if we do.
[1:28:07] But but some would do, some do, and
[1:28:10] that's so so unfortunate.
[1:28:13] You have appeared here at this season,
[1:28:17] at this time in uh in the history of the
[1:28:20] world. You have appeared here according
[1:28:23] to a
[1:28:25] conceived plan of almighty God.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; You're not an accident.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; You're here by design.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And God, if you're a seed of God, he
[1:28:38] arranged for you to be here. He actually
[1:28:40] thrust you out.
[1:28:42] caused you to appear
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; and and and here's this piece. We might
[1:28:47] say, "Well, we're just a little piece of
[1:28:49] clay." But God pushed you out to be a
[1:28:52] reflector.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; God caused you to appear. And even that
[1:28:58] word to appear, the pheno in the Greek,
[1:29:01] caused you to appear so that you could
[1:29:04] shine.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; And you can only shine with the light
[1:29:07] that God has given to put in you. We
[1:29:10] don't have a light of ourselves. We
[1:29:13] don't have our own light. But God has
[1:29:15] promised to shine in us. And Jesus has
[1:29:18] said, "You are light." And you'll never
[1:29:21] know how much light. You don't know
[1:29:22] where it goes. You don't know how far it
[1:29:25] scatters. You don't know the effect of
[1:29:26] it. But as I've been speaking this, that
[1:29:29] light has power. That light has
[1:29:32] intensity. Some will not like it because
[1:29:35] it will uncover their evil deeds. Some
[1:29:38] will not like it because it shows them
[1:29:40] up and it shows the difference between
[1:29:43] darkness and light. And if their deeds
[1:29:45] are evil, they will not like it. But you
[1:29:48] are not to change your course. You're
[1:29:50] not to soften it up. You are light.
[1:29:53] You're children of light. Walk in the
[1:29:55] light as he is in the light. For then
[1:29:57] when we do that, we have fellowship one
[1:29:59] with another. And the blood of Christ
[1:30:02] cleanseth us from all sin. Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Also, as I mentioned, the resurrection
[1:30:09] was associated with light
[1:30:12] and uh prophet preached how he has been
[1:30:16] raised out of history.
[1:30:20] Why did he have to be raised out of
[1:30:21] history in this day? They put him in a
[1:30:24] stone tomb when he was here in his
[1:30:27] physical visitation going to Calvary.
[1:30:31] But and you can go to the tomb. It's
[1:30:33] right there in Jerusalem where brother
[1:30:35] Rogers came from. You can go to the
[1:30:37] tomb. I've gone to the tomb. I've gone
[1:30:39] right where they declare that he laid.
[1:30:42] And it certainly has ever every
[1:30:44] appearance of being that way. It's right
[1:30:46] it's right at Gol Gotha. You can see the
[1:30:49] uh you can see the skull, the shape of
[1:30:51] the skull. You can see the place on the
[1:30:54] hill where the cross are. And nearby it
[1:30:56] says there was a garden. And the garden
[1:30:58] is right below it. And there is the
[1:30:59] there is the tomb. And it's a it's a a
[1:31:03] place to a moving place to visit. And I
[1:31:07] there's just certain feeling about it.
[1:31:09] But the prophet has said
[1:31:12] that is the proof that our that
[1:31:16] Christianity is the truth because we
[1:31:18] have an empty tomb.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And now he also said that when he died,
[1:31:24] you died with him
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; and when he was buried, you were buried
[1:31:29] with him. That is not just poetic. God
[1:31:32] saw you go to that tomb
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; and God saw you come out
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; on the Lord's day on the first day of
[1:31:40] the week. God saw you come out
[1:31:43] resurrected. And that is why brother
[1:31:45] Brandham could only say, "You are
[1:31:47] already resurrected." It's not that
[1:31:50] we're waiting for a resurrection. You're
[1:31:52] already resurrected. And those that fall
[1:31:54] asleep in Christ are already
[1:31:56] resurrected. They only await the moment,
[1:31:59] the time, the season. When when when
[1:32:02] God's clock hits the right moment, then
[1:32:06] the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:32:09] incorruptible. And we that are alive and
[1:32:12] remain shall be changed in the moment,
[1:32:15] in the twinkling of an eye. That's what
[1:32:18] we're walking this walk for.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of it.
[1:32:27] Now,
[1:32:29] I appreciated the song Sister Elizabeth,
[1:32:31] Brother Jeremy sang. I don't know if
[1:32:34] there were others singing, but I I heard
[1:32:37] their voices and the words.
[1:32:42] And the prophet Nehemiah said, "Yet thou
[1:32:45] in thy manifold mercies
[1:32:48] forsookst them not in the wilderness.
[1:32:52] The pillar of cloud departed not from
[1:32:55] them by day
[1:32:58] to lead them in the way and neither the
[1:33:02] pillar of fire by night to show them
[1:33:06] light and the way wherein they shall go.
[1:33:10] Now I come to a segment that I want to
[1:33:12] really drive home to you. This light is
[1:33:16] a leading light.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Say we walk in the light. That light
[1:33:20] might be here today and might be over
[1:33:22] there tomorrow, but we are to walk in
[1:33:25] the light. The children of Israel and
[1:33:27] Moses as their prophet was responsible
[1:33:30] to lead them where that pillar of cloud
[1:33:33] went and where that pillar of fire went.
[1:33:36] When it stopped, they stopped.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; And when it moved, they didn't say, "Oh,
[1:33:41] well, uh uh we'll catch up with you."
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; And God told them, "When it moves, you
[1:33:48] move.
[1:33:49] Hallelujah.
[1:33:51] I say that when when God opens up more
[1:33:53] of this word and when God touches you
[1:33:57] with something by the Holy Spirit and
[1:33:59] I'm trusting that to this morning that
[1:34:01] will happen in if not all the lives and
[1:34:04] hearts a good number that are here that
[1:34:07] the Holy Spirit will speak to something
[1:34:10] someone something direct and something
[1:34:13] specific and soon as that happens you
[1:34:16] want to say I will move with that
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; I will move I will I will take a
[1:34:21] determined step. And if it and if I have
[1:34:24] to step on a on the neck of the enemy,
[1:34:27] if he gets in my way, I will do so. I'm
[1:34:29] taking a I'm taking a conquering walk.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Help me out now.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; We're getting to an important part here.
[1:34:42] This is a leading light.
[1:34:45] This light has been sent with the
[1:34:48] intention to lead and all the way
[1:34:51] through. I can take you all through the
[1:34:53] scripture. The angel of the Lord, listen
[1:34:56] to me closely, please. Is the angel of
[1:35:00] the Lord, you hear that term term often,
[1:35:03] but the angel of the Lord is the
[1:35:05] personal presence of God himself. I'll
[1:35:10] tell you my brother, my sister, that
[1:35:12] angel of the Lord is not only his
[1:35:15] personal presence, but it is what God
[1:35:18] has used. He has used that presence to
[1:35:23] identify his people and to lead them and
[1:35:26] to show them the way as Nehemiah said.
[1:35:31] And I'm going to take you quickly
[1:35:32] through the scriptures. And the angel of
[1:35:34] the Lord in Exodus appeared unto him in
[1:35:37] a flame of fire. Notice it wasn't in a
[1:35:41] black cloud, but it was in a flame of
[1:35:43] fire in the midst of the bush. And he
[1:35:46] looked and beheld the bush burned with
[1:35:49] fire and the bush was not consumed. In
[1:35:53] the 32nd chapter, now that was how Moses
[1:35:56] was initiated into his commission by a
[1:35:59] flame of fire. In Exodus 12 and34,
[1:36:04] God speaking to him, now go. Now,
[1:36:07] therefore, now go lead the people unto
[1:36:11] the place of which I have spoken unto
[1:36:15] thee. Behold, mine angel shall go before
[1:36:19] thee, and nevertheless, in the day when
[1:36:22] I visit, I will visit their sin upon
[1:36:25] them because they had rebelled. And many
[1:36:28] of those that God was even tenderly
[1:36:30] leading
[1:36:33] died in the wilderness.
[1:36:36] No friends,
[1:36:38] you do not have to die in the wastelands
[1:36:40] of Leodysia.
[1:36:42] If you do, it is your own doing.
[1:36:45] It's your own doing. I would I would
[1:36:48] watch and put ask God to put a watchman
[1:36:52] over my thoughts.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let me think negative thoughts.
[1:36:56] Amen.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let me live in shadows. Don't let
[1:36:59] me live in a world of question. Let me
[1:37:01] live in a world of assurance.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Let me live in a world where I know
[1:37:06] where I stand.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Don't let me live in a world of been
[1:37:10] affected by my youth or by what I
[1:37:13] experienced in my home. Some are here
[1:37:15] from broken homes. I say to you in the
[1:37:17] name of the Lord, that is not to affect
[1:37:19] your walk.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; You may have unsaved parents. You may
[1:37:24] have unsaved children. I have find
[1:37:26] parents in this message who are affected
[1:37:28] because their children are not following
[1:37:31] what they stood up for all these years.
[1:37:34] You have no mandate to lessen your walk
[1:37:37] with God regardless of what your
[1:37:39] children have done. No mandate
[1:37:42] whatsoever. Your mandate is to walk in
[1:37:45] the light. Your mandate is to be
[1:37:47] purposeful in your walk. Your mandate is
[1:37:50] to be a light to those that are not
[1:37:52] walking in it yet. Amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; That is your commission. That is your
[1:37:56] responsibility. You have a
[1:37:58] responsibility before God. If someone
[1:38:00] comes and even speaks to you and you see
[1:38:02] that it is not coming from a direction
[1:38:04] of light, it is your responsibility to
[1:38:07] shed the light.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And cast off darkness.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; And don't be a receiver of that
[1:38:13] darkness.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; The light is a leading light.
[1:38:24] I want to just take a quick summary of
[1:38:27] the personal presence of God to our
[1:38:29] time. When God called Abraham,
[1:38:33] it had to do with a move
[1:38:37] and he did not promise him an easy time.
[1:38:39] No, he did not.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; God did lead him
[1:38:44] and God did bless him. Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; God attended to Abraham through his
[1:38:50] journey throughout his journey. God met
[1:38:53] him in different forms in the form of
[1:38:55] Melzdc
[1:38:57] in the form of Elohim.
[1:38:59] And Abraham was absolutely certain that
[1:39:02] this angel messenger would also direct
[1:39:06] his servant Eleazar
[1:39:08] to find his son Isaac a wife. He was
[1:39:11] absolutely convinced this this God
[1:39:15] called me. He has met me. I have talked
[1:39:19] to him
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and he's not going to leave me here high
[1:39:21] and dry.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm now old and now my son needs a wife.
[1:39:26] This God that led me here is not going
[1:39:29] to leave me here forlorn, forsaken, and
[1:39:32] abandoned. This God is not leaving you
[1:39:36] in the midst of your trouble or
[1:39:38] adversity or whatever it is you might
[1:39:41] experience today. I say in the name of
[1:39:44] the Lord, we do not have a God that
[1:39:46] leaves us and forsakes us. We do not
[1:39:48] have a God who will deny his word. I say
[1:39:51] to you, God is with you right where you
[1:39:53] are today in what situation you are. And
[1:39:56] I say, have faith.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believe
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; and do not doubt.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Don't let your heart be filled with
[1:40:05] doubt.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let your heart be filled with
[1:40:08] question.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; That's only bringing more shadow. And
[1:40:11] God through Abraham,
[1:40:14] he spoke and God sending out Eleazar. He
[1:40:18] said, "The Lord God of heaven," now hold
[1:40:21] on because I'm just building up here. I
[1:40:23] want to get this. The Lord God of heaven
[1:40:26] which took me from my father's house.
[1:40:29] Notice where he starts when he's
[1:40:31] instructing Eleazar. Now you're going to
[1:40:34] go. Abraham's been in his he's in his
[1:40:36] walk for many many years now. I shocked
[1:40:41] the people down in Alabama when I told
[1:40:44] them. Do you know how many times and
[1:40:47] what length of time God actually spoke
[1:40:50] to Abraham? I timed it out. I read
[1:40:52] slowly. In 25 years, it amounts to 12
[1:40:57] minutes in the Bible. So now the next 25
[1:41:01] years you have, if God treats you like
[1:41:04] he treated Abraham, you have you you
[1:41:08] can't you can't expect any more than 12
[1:41:10] minutes.
[1:41:16] Say, "Oh Lord,
[1:41:19] don't leave me. 12 minutes I feel like
[1:41:21] I'm forsaken." That would only be just a
[1:41:24] few moments in a day. No, we want more
[1:41:27] than that. But it was it was just a
[1:41:29] short period. And Abraham goes back and
[1:41:32] he says, "The God that took me from my
[1:41:33] father's house and from the land of my
[1:41:36] kindred, he took me, brother Brandham
[1:41:38] said, he took him, he had his kindred
[1:41:40] there, he had his friends there, he had
[1:41:42] his associate there, he had his family
[1:41:43] there, and called him from his comfort
[1:41:46] zone. And he swear to me, he said,
[1:41:50] saying, unto thy seed will I give this
[1:41:52] land, he shall send his angel. In other
[1:41:56] words, he will send his light before
[1:41:58] you, and thou shalt take a wife unto my
[1:42:04] son from then. He was so convinced, you
[1:42:06] shall do it.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham makes makes
[1:42:10] reference back then. I'm just moving
[1:42:12] forward to our time in the message, Time
[1:42:14] of Decision.
[1:42:17] He's talking about Eleazar, Abraham's
[1:42:21] servant,
[1:42:22] and he said he wanted some kind of
[1:42:24] assurance.
[1:42:26] And he kept questioning. He kept
[1:42:28] questioning, "Oh, what if the woman
[1:42:31] won't come with me?"
[1:42:34] See, that cast a shadow on his
[1:42:36] commission. What if the woman won't come
[1:42:39] with me? He said, when I tell her these
[1:42:41] things, what if she doesn't come? Then
[1:42:43] what?
[1:42:45] Then he had to make a decision. He says,
[1:42:48] "Then when he heard from his master's
[1:42:50] lips, when he heard from his master's
[1:42:52] lips,
[1:42:53] the angel of God shall go before you."
[1:43:00] And I don't know in your heart of hearts
[1:43:03] I hear so many wonderful
[1:43:08] moments that I share and you share with
[1:43:10] me and what you have
[1:43:14] spoken
[1:43:16] to myself
[1:43:18] and whatever my life and my ministry
[1:43:21] means to you. But I felt to say to this
[1:43:26] congregation this morning, his angel
[1:43:30] shall go before you. And you might say,
[1:43:34] "How can you say that, brother Biscll?"
[1:43:36] I'll tell you why I can say that. And I
[1:43:39] have very, very good reason to say that.
[1:43:43] The truth is and the fact is you are you
[1:43:47] are here
[1:43:49] because the angel of the Lord that came
[1:43:52] to a prophet messenger and commissioned
[1:43:55] him sending him and brother Brandham
[1:43:58] continues here when he says the angel of
[1:44:01] the Lord shall go before you and he
[1:44:04] stops. Oh,
[1:44:07] I like that so much. It just fits my
[1:44:12] case
[1:44:14] there.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; That fits my case. What he's saying in
[1:44:18] plain language, that is me.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; That is what I'm called to do. Get And
[1:44:26] he said in a message of shame to him, go
[1:44:28] get my son a bride.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; That do you believe that's his
[1:44:33] commission? Amen.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; what called you? What drew you?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; What has what has moved you? And he
[1:44:41] said, "The angel of the Lord shall go
[1:44:43] before you." And brother Brandham puts
[1:44:44] it in this language. And I love this
[1:44:47] language. The angel of the Lord shall go
[1:44:50] shall go before you as Abraham said,
[1:44:52] "And he will persuade her." Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And if you are here,
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; you are here under the sound of this
[1:45:02] message, I have to believe at some point
[1:45:04] in time something got a hold of you. It
[1:45:08] was like the mantle of Elijah upon
[1:45:10] Elisha and he began to persuade you. You
[1:45:15] had obstacles. You had resistance. You
[1:45:18] had fight in you. You had reasoning. You
[1:45:21] had all kinds of reason. But the angel,
[1:45:24] you wonder what it is. What got a hold
[1:45:26] of me? What held on to me? Even when I
[1:45:28] fought like a fish on the line, what was
[1:45:31] it? It was the angel of the Lord
[1:45:34] persuading you.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was persuading you. It is
[1:45:40] the truth.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; And as you walked in it, you found out
[1:45:43] it was light. Oh, this is a light. I'm
[1:45:47] walking in a light as a glorious light.
[1:45:50] The angel of the Lord persuading you.
[1:45:55] Oh, I love that persuasion.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Let us be persuaded. Let us be moved.
[1:46:01] Let us be influenced by that angel of
[1:46:04] the Lord.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says of Christ,
[1:46:12] they which sat in darkness saw a great
[1:46:14] light.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; And to them that sat in the region of
[1:46:20] the shadow of death, light has sprung
[1:46:22] up.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] As Paul journeyied on the road to
[1:46:29] Damascus,
[1:46:31] he came to Damascus and suddenly there
[1:46:34] shined
[1:46:35] round about him a light from heaven
[1:46:40] and he fell to the earth and heard a
[1:46:42] voice unto him. The others didn't hear
[1:46:45] it.
[1:46:47] I told you young people in the
[1:46:49] graduation perhaps a moment you felt
[1:46:53] just as strange something happened in a
[1:46:55] service
[1:46:57] at a camp. So many of you said it was a
[1:47:01] camp one of my most memorable moments. I
[1:47:04] would like this today to be a memorable
[1:47:06] moment for you.
[1:47:08] And you felt something. You felt a urge.
[1:47:10] You felt a persuasion and you thought oh
[1:47:13] it and brother Ben says sometimes we
[1:47:15] just put it off. Well, that's just me.
[1:47:17] Maybe you felt really moved inside to
[1:47:20] even squatchch it and put it down. Don't
[1:47:23] do that. This angel of the Lord
[1:47:27] is he's so timid. It's a Holy Ghost.
[1:47:30] It's the Holy Spirit. And he's so timid.
[1:47:34] He's such a gentleman. Brother Brandham
[1:47:37] says, "And this light that came and
[1:47:41] shone,
[1:47:44] Paul, who was Saul at the time, heard a
[1:47:47] voice. So I do not say that this is just
[1:47:50] a light. This is a light that's a
[1:47:53] leading light.
[1:47:55] It has led all the way from the
[1:47:57] beginning. It's the very nature of God
[1:48:00] to lead his people. This is a leading
[1:48:02] light. This light has a path. This light
[1:48:05] has a program. This light has a has an
[1:48:08] agenda
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; to put it in our language. This light is
[1:48:12] not just a shining light out here
[1:48:13] someplace on the on the roadway. This is
[1:48:16] a light with a thought behind it. This
[1:48:18] is a light with a design for your life.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; And it's a light with a voice in it.
[1:48:25] Amen.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And this scholar
[1:48:32] in the midst of his his particular
[1:48:35] situation which was absolutely going
[1:48:39] full boore against the Christian early
[1:48:42] church. And that voice said, "Saul,
[1:48:44] Saul,
[1:48:46] how clear it is."
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Others didn't even know anything's going
[1:48:50] on, but he hears a specific message to
[1:48:52] himself. Saul, Saul, why persecutest
[1:48:55] thou me? And furthermore, it revealed
[1:48:57] the it revealed his own condition. It's
[1:48:59] hard for you to kick against the pricks.
[1:49:02] He was having a hard time, but yet to
[1:49:05] the outside man looked like he was right
[1:49:07] on top of things. He was in command. He
[1:49:09] knew what he was doing. Sometimes we can
[1:49:12] be we can exhibit a lot of confidence
[1:49:14] and a lot of self asssurance and so on
[1:49:16] so forth, but God knows our
[1:49:17] insecurities. Amen.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; God knows your little complexes.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; God knows what's really down there
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and he wants to point you away from
[1:49:28] that.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you an overcoming
[1:49:32] experience over that. And today I would
[1:49:36] adjure you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:38] Take a step and step on that thing that
[1:49:40] is hindering you and come out from it
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; and take another step for this light has
[1:49:47] been sent to lead you away from that and
[1:49:50] have you victory over it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; God does not expect a people to walk
[1:49:55] through this life browbeaten and barely
[1:49:57] making their way and so on so forth.
[1:49:59] God's people have always been a bold,
[1:50:02] courageous people.
[1:50:04] always have been.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the
[1:50:12] pricks. And then in Zachchariah, and it
[1:50:15] shall be one day, which you've heard
[1:50:17] this perhaps hundreds of times. It shall
[1:50:19] be one day which shall be known to the
[1:50:21] Lord, not day nor night, but it shall
[1:50:26] come to pass.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It shall come to pass that
[1:50:31] at the evening time it shall be what?
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Late,
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; not shadows. This is a prophecy.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Which has come to pass.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; In the evening time at sunset
[1:50:49] when it begins to grow dark,
[1:50:52] it'll be light.
[1:50:55] In the late message, man running from
[1:50:58] the presence, brother Brandham now
[1:51:00] relates and he goes back at the
[1:51:03] beginning. He said, "I stood down there
[1:51:06] on the river bank and we're singing the
[1:51:09] old song on Jordan's stormy banks I
[1:51:14] stand and cast a wishful eye
[1:51:18] to Canaan's fair and happy land where my
[1:51:23] possessions notice what they're singing
[1:51:25] about. cast an eye
[1:51:28] to Canaan's land where my
[1:51:32] possessions like he said to the rancher.
[1:51:35] You look east and you look west and you
[1:51:37] look to the city and you look to the
[1:51:39] bank. So, I'd like you to look this way.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And they were singing that song and many
[1:51:45] were being baptized. And when they stood
[1:51:47] there and witnessed that morning, he
[1:51:50] said, "That morning star."
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. that morning star coming down out
[1:51:56] of heaven circling around
[1:52:00] that said,
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; "A light with a voice in it."
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Not just a light, not just something
[1:52:07] that even the cameras could catch, but a
[1:52:10] light with a voice in it. And the voice
[1:52:12] said, "As John the Baptist was sent to
[1:52:16] forerun or to bring to forerun the first
[1:52:18] coming of Christ, your message will
[1:52:20] forrun the second coming." Amen.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; How could it be?
[1:52:26] How could it be thought? But all God's
[1:52:28] words are true. Another light. This
[1:52:32] message at its very beginnings
[1:52:36] is identified with light.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; A light that will lead. A light that
[1:52:44] will introduce.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Why do you have an introduction? You
[1:52:48] make an introduction. You walk up to
[1:52:49] somebody and you have someone in between
[1:52:52] because you don't know who this is. It's
[1:52:54] all a mystery.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; You're in total darkness. Who is this? I
[1:52:57] don't know. Where do they live? I don't
[1:52:59] know. Where'd they come from? I don't
[1:53:01] know where they going. I don't know. But
[1:53:04] then uh who whoever introduc the
[1:53:06] messenger says, "Oh, brother Bisco, this
[1:53:08] is brother so and so. He just came here
[1:53:10] from Zimbabwe and he's on his way to
[1:53:12] London, but he's going to spend some
[1:53:14] days in Vancouver and he wants to
[1:53:16] fellowship with you." Suddenly the whole
[1:53:18] purpose of the whole purpose of the
[1:53:19] man's life the whole thing all comes
[1:53:21] into into focus.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; That who introduces
[1:53:29] also dissolves doubts.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching a little bit like a lawyer
[1:53:36] now. I'm expecting you to catch the rest
[1:53:37] of it. He who introduces is supposed to
[1:53:42] dissolve doubts. He's a dissolver of
[1:53:44] doubts.
[1:53:46] There was a man, a king, a great king. I
[1:53:48] don't want to take time with him, but
[1:53:49] Belichazar, his name, son of
[1:53:52] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:53:54] powerful man of all, we could go on and
[1:53:56] on and on and describe his power and his
[1:53:59] wealth and all the rest of it. And he
[1:54:00] calls in all the fair ladies and all
[1:54:03] their beautiful, I suppose, Egyptian
[1:54:06] silk gowns and from what all the wealth
[1:54:08] of Babylon.
[1:54:12] We had a minister here once that
[1:54:14] described had studied that palace and
[1:54:17] the columns and how they had carvings of
[1:54:21] ivory of elephants and the columns sat
[1:54:24] on the elephants and and on carvings of
[1:54:27] tigers and sat on those monstrous huge
[1:54:33] gorgeous
[1:54:35] place.
[1:54:37] He felt there was no one,
[1:54:40] no one, how quickly God
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; can cause a man's joints
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; to be loosened in his knees to shake
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and he sees a hand, but he can't see
[1:54:53] where the hand goes and comes from that
[1:54:55] raise a question and the hand begins to
[1:54:57] write and the writing is in a language
[1:54:59] that he doesn't know and he's filled
[1:55:01] with question. This man who felt so uh
[1:55:04] assured and so strong and so confident
[1:55:07] and so victorious and so wealthy and so
[1:55:10] powerful and so respected, so admired
[1:55:14] immediately was in darkness.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? What does it say?
[1:55:18] Where'd it come from?
[1:55:21] And his wife came.
[1:55:23] Hallelujah.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; There is a man.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; There is a man who's a dissolver of
[1:55:30] doubts.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:32] bring us that man. And I want to tell
[1:55:35] you, glory, by the way, and all who
[1:55:38] listen to me, that very spirit, that
[1:55:40] very life that gave Daniel and caused
[1:55:44] him to be a revealer and a a dissolver
[1:55:46] of doubts, that's the very one that is
[1:55:49] leading this bride body of Jesus Christ.
[1:55:53] There isn't any other one that could
[1:55:54] bring these secrets out of the word of
[1:55:55] God like this. It is the angel of the
[1:55:58] Lord.
[1:56:01] that angel.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; And if you walk in that light of the
[1:56:06] word as it's brought to you, you'll
[1:56:08] never be in darkness.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; You'll never be in shadows of doubt.
[1:56:18] And Daniel told him what it was. And
[1:56:20] instantly they want to make him a great
[1:56:22] man.
[1:56:25] Brother Brandham was in South Africa.
[1:56:29] And he and he says, "I and now I watch
[1:56:33] here. He is now
[1:56:37] and like to know if he was this way,
[1:56:41] would it not be wise for us?"
[1:56:45] He feel God's presence come into the
[1:56:47] building.
[1:56:51] He says, "Then he watches."
[1:56:55] Because he is a man, he said many times,
[1:56:57] "He's just as helpless as you or I, but
[1:57:01] he would watch."
[1:57:03] And God knew he had a man that was so
[1:57:06] simple and so humble
[1:57:10] that he would watch for that presence.
[1:57:13] And he says, "And I see that light
[1:57:17] move over somebody."
[1:57:20] and it'll stand there.
[1:57:24] I'm soon going to close,
[1:57:26] but I'm just where I'd like to start.
[1:57:32] I have absolute assurance
[1:57:34] that that same pillar of fire was on the
[1:57:37] Ohio River, that same fire that was in
[1:57:38] the burning bush, that same spirit that
[1:57:41] spoke through Daniel, that same light
[1:57:43] that came when Jesus shone to the
[1:57:45] Gentiles, that same light that was on
[1:57:47] the road to Damascus, I have absolute
[1:57:49] confidence the same light is present
[1:57:51] here today.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And that light has been sent to guide
[1:57:58] us.
[1:58:01] And I'm trying to be real sensitive this
[1:58:03] morning.
[1:58:05] Here's a prophet and he said, "You see
[1:58:06] that light?" I have actually stood here
[1:58:08] at the pulpit and seen God come directly
[1:58:13] to an individual just at an instant of
[1:58:15] time.
[1:58:18] I cannot always explain what it is.
[1:58:23] I can't explain
[1:58:25] the full purpose of it. I don't try to,
[1:58:28] but no one can ever convince me that God
[1:58:31] didn't strike that person's soul at that
[1:58:34] very instant.
[1:58:40] Brother Brandham said, "I'll watch it
[1:58:43] and it'll move."
[1:58:46] Think of it. the angel of God actually
[1:58:51] amongst the people and move
[1:58:54] and stop and stay over an individual.
[1:58:59] Oh God.
[1:59:02] Oh God.
[1:59:04] And there's times when you say he looks
[1:59:06] out there now. He said it's all just
[1:59:08] milky white. Why? He I don't recall him
[1:59:13] ever saying it's just a big black cloud
[1:59:15] over the people. But when the people
[1:59:17] would come in one accord and one mind
[1:59:22] and and their spirits are blending
[1:59:25] together and and all pulling one way and
[1:59:28] for one purpose say oh it's a so it's
[1:59:32] just a great light that's over the
[1:59:34] people. I say Lord don't let us live
[1:59:36] where we are living today. Don't let us
[1:59:38] know what we are knowing. Don't let us
[1:59:40] have experienced what we have
[1:59:42] experienced and live in some dismal
[1:59:44] gloomy place that he talks about. But
[1:59:46] let us live in the bright light of the
[1:59:49] sunshine under the glow and under the
[1:59:52] leadership of this angel of the Lord
[1:59:55] that's been sent with a divine purpose.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Some men I know of
[2:00:10] went hunting
[2:00:13] in Alaska.
[2:00:17] One of them was a one or two of them
[2:00:19] were ministers.
[2:00:21] And while they were driving out,
[2:00:25] they were talking about
[2:00:29] hunting and the game and so on so forth.
[2:00:33] And this this one man, he was so
[2:00:35] assured. They had never hunted with him
[2:00:37] before, but he had such such assurance
[2:00:39] and you know, I mean, he he he knew so
[2:00:41] much about it and everything. And so
[2:00:43] they they just understood from his
[2:00:46] conversation that he was a man of the
[2:00:48] woods and there wasn't much that he
[2:00:50] didn't know about it. So when they got
[2:00:53] uh got to where they were going to get,
[2:00:55] they unloaded and started unloading
[2:00:57] their stuff. And this brother, they're
[2:00:59] all believers. All not believers of the
[2:01:01] message as such. The message wasn't here
[2:01:03] yet. It was in the 50s. And this man
[2:01:05] says, "Uh, okay, you fellas, uh, you you
[2:01:08] set up camp and I'll go and check out
[2:01:11] I'll scout the country out."
[2:01:15] So, he's gone just a little while and
[2:01:17] they're setting up camp and putting up
[2:01:20] the tents and whatever more and all the
[2:01:22] rest of it.
[2:01:24] And after a while, they heard
[2:01:29] and heard a whistle.
[2:01:31] And as one brother was just going to
[2:01:33] whistle back and the other brother says,
[2:01:34] "Don't do it. He's lost.
[2:01:38] I bet he's lost."
[2:01:41] And pretty soon it wasn't whistles
[2:01:44] anymore. It was yelling at the top of
[2:01:46] his voice.
[2:01:49] And these brothers, they never said a
[2:01:51] word. And the thing was, it was so
[2:01:54] close.
[2:01:59] So they they they crawled over one
[2:02:02] little knob, just little rolling knobs
[2:02:03] like that. Just over one little knob
[2:02:05] into one little dip on as they're coming
[2:02:07] up the other knob. They hear he was
[2:02:10] right there
[2:02:12] and he was on his knees.
[2:02:15] God,
[2:02:17] you get me out of here. I'll go to
[2:02:20] Africa. I'll go to some I'll go wherever
[2:02:23] you want me to go. You just get me out
[2:02:25] of here.
[2:02:27] There he was. just a
[2:02:31] just a few yards from his camp.
[2:02:35] We may smile at that, but that's exactly
[2:02:37] where a lot of us get.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; We start straying off and then we get a
[2:02:41] little ways and and we just get off into
[2:02:43] the shadows of
[2:02:45] where am I? Where am I? The problem is
[2:02:48] you just stepped out of the light for a
[2:02:49] short time. Amen.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; You just got into the shadows for a
[2:02:53] short time. And all you really need to
[2:02:56] do only this time, you won't have
[2:02:59] anybody pulling a joke on you or putting
[2:03:02] you to a test. Lord, help me.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; You see where I am? And here I am in
[2:03:08] this service. And I've heard this
[2:03:10] message and I've heard this word. And
[2:03:12] I've heard and I believe with everything
[2:03:14] that's in me. You believe it on the
[2:03:16] balcony. You believe with all your
[2:03:17] heart. This angel of the Lord has been
[2:03:20] sent to me as an individual. I see him
[2:03:23] move. He said, and he comes and moves
[2:03:26] over this person and and stops there.
[2:03:30] You know, friends,
[2:03:32] I hope I can impose this upon your mind.
[2:03:35] And I hope that I can get it down into
[2:03:38] your soul. I would like you individually
[2:03:41] to say to this omnipotent God, this
[2:03:44] omnipresent God that fills all time and
[2:03:46] space, if a prophet could see him move
[2:03:49] over one individual and stop there,
[2:03:51] surely you and I can say, "Oh God, oh
[2:03:55] God, I believe every word of it and move
[2:03:58] over me and don't just move over me, but
[2:04:02] stop
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; and let me abide in the warmth of your
[2:04:08] presence.
[2:04:09] Do what you would have done in my life
[2:04:13] at this time. Do it, oh God. All that I
[2:04:16] am and all that I ever can be. I just
[2:04:21] give it to you now.
[2:04:27] And I'm closing with this.
[2:04:37] They tell us,
[2:04:40] they tell us that Venus,
[2:04:43] which apparently is in the sky right
[2:04:45] now,
[2:04:47] but they say it is so bright, and that
[2:04:50] Venus goes on a certain course, a
[2:04:53] certain orbit,
[2:04:55] and for a certain period of time, and I
[2:04:57] have it all here, but I'm not going to
[2:04:58] bore you with it and take take up time
[2:05:00] in the service because I want to
[2:05:02] But they say that on on on its
[2:05:05] trajectory on its journey
[2:05:07] during certain months
[2:05:10] it is the morning star and it hangs it's
[2:05:13] the brightest and it hangs there
[2:05:17] and then it goes and it's hidden and we
[2:05:20] don't see it and as the earth moves and
[2:05:23] Venus comes back into view then it
[2:05:26] becomes the evening star and he says
[2:05:29] they're they are both the same star
[2:05:32] and uh brother Brandham said in God
[2:05:34] hiding in simplicity. Actually he said
[2:05:36] this but I'd like to start preaching
[2:05:38] just now.
[2:05:41] He says
[2:05:44] the world standing in space and the
[2:05:46] north pole up or the south pole up.
[2:05:49] Which one is it? See he says oh the
[2:05:52] morning star
[2:05:54] and the evening star.
[2:05:57] It's both the same star.
[2:06:00] And he identified the morning star.
[2:06:04] Christ Christ himself is called the day
[2:06:08] star. And the day star in the Greek is a
[2:06:12] word phosphorus.
[2:06:14] And that word in Greek actually says
[2:06:17] Venus. That is the meaning of the word
[2:06:19] in Greek. It's Venus. And it is also as
[2:06:22] you know it identifies identifies light.
[2:06:27] And brother Brandham refers to the
[2:06:29] morning star and refers to brother J
[2:06:33] apostle John not apostle John but John
[2:06:35] the Baptist identifying Christ in
[2:06:38] shalom. He goes on to say now I say to
[2:06:41] the church
[2:06:43] and you are part of that church.
[2:06:46] He says to you shalom.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; God's peace.
[2:06:51] Peace. Every true Hebrew when he meets
[2:06:54] another it's shalom.
[2:06:56] In other words, good morning.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; God be with you. God's peace go with
[2:07:02] you. It's a good morning. Said it's the
[2:07:04] breaking of the day, church. It's
[2:07:07] darkness upon the people, but it's good
[2:07:10] morning to the church. Christ is
[2:07:13] appearing amongst us. Shalom. Peace.
[2:07:16] Shalom. And he speaks about Catholicism
[2:07:19] and what Rome did. You know what he says
[2:07:22] about 20ome times?
[2:07:25] He says
[2:07:28] they took down Venus
[2:07:31] and put up Mary.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; The light,
[2:07:41] the brightest, took down that light and
[2:07:45] put up an idolatry,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; put up a darkness
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; instead of the light. And the scripture
[2:07:54] tells us
[2:07:56] until the day star
[2:08:00] arise where in your hearts.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here this morning. We're
[2:08:07] closing now in a morning service. You've
[2:08:10] sat through another service. You've
[2:08:12] listened. And I'm praying now that the
[2:08:14] spirit of God, that the angel of the
[2:08:17] Lord will now take these things that
[2:08:20] have said been said and now begin to
[2:08:24] expand it into your heart. That the
[2:08:25] light will just begin to permeate
[2:08:29] your entire being. And that you will go
[2:08:32] from this place with a wi with a a
[2:08:35] consciousness
[2:08:36] and a a a sacred
[2:08:40] sincerity.
[2:08:42] You'll take it from my heart. God, I
[2:08:45] believe what I heard this morning that
[2:08:48] it is indeed your angel. I see it all
[2:08:52] the way back in the scripture, but I
[2:08:53] don't have to go all the way back, but
[2:08:55] it was in my time and it was in my day.
[2:08:59] And you said it and you've raised up
[2:09:01] some people. You've raised up some men
[2:09:03] and they have echoed it out. And
[2:09:06] somehow, whether it be my parents or
[2:09:08] whether it be my husband or wife or
[2:09:11] whether it be my friends or some of my
[2:09:13] family, somehow everybody's story is
[2:09:15] different, but somehow I came under the
[2:09:19] sound of this message. I came under a
[2:09:23] great radiant light. And when I did, it
[2:09:26] exposed me. How many can say it exposed
[2:09:28] you?
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; It exposed what it was. It exposed the
[2:09:34] error. exposed the falsehood, exposed
[2:09:36] the sin, exposed everything, and uh and
[2:09:40] the darkness fled away.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And a prophet could say to you, "Good
[2:09:45] morning,
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; cuz the day star has risen in your
[2:09:49] hearts."
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; And I am here today to tell you that day
[2:09:53] star arose in your heart to lead you.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; To He has He has a way. He has a
[2:10:00] direction. He has a certain path that he
[2:10:03] wants you to go in. This is a leading
[2:10:06] light
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; and it's a light with a voice in it
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; and that voice has the answer for your
[2:10:14] question or your dilemma or whatever it
[2:10:17] is you may face.
[2:10:21] I've been listening to that. I've been
[2:10:23] listening very very attentively
[2:10:25] and I'll tell you why I've been
[2:10:27] listening. This is get personal now.
[2:10:30] Sister Biscll and I spoke on it on the
[2:10:32] way to church.
[2:10:38] You can't manufacture that voice.
[2:10:43] You can put yourself in a in in a place
[2:10:45] and you can get yourself and you can be
[2:10:47] conditioned and you can create an
[2:10:49] atmosphere. I can tell you if you just
[2:10:51] keep going, you know, full bore and you
[2:10:54] just your your own world and your own
[2:10:56] activities and where I'm going and what
[2:10:57] I'm going to do and what everything
[2:10:59] else, you won't experience it.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; You got to stop and be quiet.
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; You got to get quiet. You got to get
[2:11:06] next to yourself. You got to get on your
[2:11:07] own little backside of the wilderness.
[2:11:09] You got to have your own time. I say to
[2:11:12] you young people, you haven't got homes,
[2:11:13] you haven't got payment,
[2:11:14] responsibilities, you haven't got a lot
[2:11:16] of those things, make make good use of
[2:11:18] that time because the day will come
[2:11:19] where you'll have you'll have to pinch
[2:11:20] and squeeze every minute that you have.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; But I've been
[2:11:29] I remember as clear as I'm standing here
[2:11:32] today
[2:11:34] on behalf of Sister Marge Miller
[2:11:37] and she's listening right now. And
[2:11:40] Sister Marge, this is what I've been
[2:11:44] really seeking God about with everything
[2:11:46] that's in me.
[2:11:48] And I desire it's everything within me.
[2:11:51] But you know, God is so sovereign.
[2:11:53] I remember the day that Sister Marge
[2:11:55] Miller came over from Vancouver Island
[2:11:57] where they where she was living then
[2:12:00] working in the hospital in Duncan,
[2:12:02] British Columbia I believe it was and
[2:12:04] the doctors had diagnosed her with lupus
[2:12:06] disease which is a terminal illness and
[2:12:10] went sent her to a specialist and the
[2:12:12] specialist confirmed that she had lupus
[2:12:15] disease
[2:12:16] and she came over journeyed over on the
[2:12:19] ferry. I don't remember whether she
[2:12:21] called me or talked to me. I just can't
[2:12:23] remember whether she came and saw or
[2:12:25] just called me on the phone. I believe
[2:12:27] it was in the service. But then we came
[2:12:30] to church and we were in the service in
[2:12:32] the log church and God spoke to me. I
[2:12:35] can't even tell you exactly where, but I
[2:12:37] think it was in the little study
[2:12:40] and said these words, "Call Marge Miller
[2:12:45] and curse that thing."
[2:12:48] That's all it said.
[2:12:50] And we came to the end of the service
[2:12:52] like we are right now. She was sitting
[2:12:54] right about where Sister Ida is
[2:12:59] and I said, "Sister Marge, come
[2:13:01] forward." She came forward and I said,
[2:13:05] "God told me to curse that thing." And I
[2:13:09] tell you, it was no big excitement.
[2:13:11] There was no emotion attached to it. We
[2:13:13] just laid hands on her and cursed it in
[2:13:15] the name of the Lord and it was gone
[2:13:17] from her body. She went back to the same
[2:13:20] specialist and back to the same
[2:13:21] hospital. There wasn't a trace of it.
[2:13:24] And she's lived all those years till
[2:13:26] now. And now she lays there and they
[2:13:28] tell her she's got tumors in her lungs
[2:13:30] and they're giving her a chemo through
[2:13:33] the IV. And I was sitting there and I
[2:13:35] think, "Oh, God,
[2:13:37] you did it before. I just don't I don't
[2:13:40] understand everything. I don't
[2:13:42] understand." But I know it only takes
[2:13:44] just one moment from you. Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; It only takes just one moment.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; He's sovereign. He's sovereign, folks.
[2:13:52] And I can tell you that moment when that
[2:13:54] those moments come, they're so
[2:13:56] priceless, they'll stay with you all of
[2:13:58] your life. What do you want to do? If I
[2:14:00] can, if I could, if I could just this
[2:14:02] morning somehow foster in your heart
[2:14:07] from this day forward a softness towards
[2:14:10] him and a hunger, a thirst, as the
[2:14:14] prophet said, that is painful
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; for him. I will feel I have done my
[2:14:20] service and my duty this morning. And
[2:14:22] I'll say, "Lord Jesus,
[2:14:25] I did everything I knew to do to have
[2:14:27] the people invite you and to have a
[2:14:30] closer love relationship with you." And
[2:14:34] that what I feel is my whole purpose in
[2:14:36] life. and and and then if you should
[2:14:40] have him respond to you in a special
[2:14:45] way. If I could just help create the
[2:14:48] conditions.
[2:14:51] You might be rampaging your own
[2:14:53] direction,
[2:14:55] but even this morning now,
[2:15:00] there isn't anyone.
[2:15:02] There's no one that's beyond
[2:15:04] his reach and beyond
[2:15:08] not only his love but his yearning.
[2:15:12] And I can say to you in the name of the
[2:15:14] Lord, he that called me
[2:15:18] from my kindred
[2:15:20] and called me from the life that I
[2:15:23] thought I was going to live and said,
[2:15:26] "You be here." and came and settled
[2:15:29] right here when there wasn't another
[2:15:31] believer that we knew of sitting here.
[2:15:34] If you'd have told me then there's going
[2:15:36] to be a few hundred people gather here,
[2:15:38] I'd have said, "You don't even know what
[2:15:39] you're talking about. I'm expecting to
[2:15:42] go out of here any day. The prophet's
[2:15:45] gone and the message has been released
[2:15:46] and I'm going out of here any day."
[2:15:49] But that wasn't his plan. And that light
[2:15:52] just kept leading and just kept leading.
[2:15:54] And I know that that light is leading
[2:15:56] this morning, Brother David. I know that
[2:15:58] light is leading, brother Billy Joe. I
[2:16:01] know that light is leading
[2:16:04] and I know that's how come you're here.
[2:16:12] And he intends
[2:16:14] my last words
[2:16:16] that you will walk confidently
[2:16:20] under his leadership and under his light
[2:16:23] until you finally pierce the veil.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and you'll penetrate.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; You'll pierce the veil and you will have
[2:16:30] fulfilled what John said. Walk.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; You're the light.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; As he is in the light and we'll have
[2:16:39] fellowship and every step the blood of
[2:16:42] Christ will cleanse us from all sin.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; We look up where our possessions lie.
[2:16:53] Father,
[2:16:57] your ways are not our ways,
[2:17:02] your thoughts are not our thoughts.
[2:17:05] Your plan and your program is far beyond
[2:17:07] ours.
[2:17:09] And I don't know everything that you
[2:17:10] want to do this morning, but I would say
[2:17:12] do it. Accomplish it.
[2:17:15] Normally, we would close about this
[2:17:16] time, but I doubt if that's going to
[2:17:19] happen.
[2:17:22] I would ask oh God that the very
[2:17:24] presence that very presence more than a
[2:17:26] word but an atmosphere
[2:17:30] and the aura of a being
[2:17:33] that very one that came down on the
[2:17:35] river
[2:17:36] and that very one that's been leading
[2:17:38] ever since.
[2:17:41] Oh God
[2:17:43] my father.
[2:17:45] And as I was studying how the words kept
[2:17:48] coming to me,
[2:17:51] shepherd of Israel,
[2:17:54] oh great shepherd of Israel,
[2:17:58] be our shepherd.
[2:18:02] And causes us your sheep, the sheep of
[2:18:04] your fold
[2:18:06] to be really attracted to our shepherd,
[2:18:10] the great shepherd of Israel, the great
[2:18:12] shepherd of the flock.
[2:18:14] Oh angel of the Lord,
[2:18:17] spirit of the living God,
[2:18:21] come, I pray, and hover
[2:18:24] over each one. And as you do, Lord, as
[2:18:27] hearts are made prepared,
[2:18:30] I pray that there will be things that
[2:18:33] will be accomplished, things that will
[2:18:35] be done,
[2:18:38] confirmations made in hearts that have
[2:18:40] question and doubt. They perhaps don't
[2:18:44] know exactly where they stand. Just
[2:18:46] reveal the secret of their heart, Lord.
[2:18:50] And I pray that you have done so during
[2:18:52] the service
[2:18:54] in name of Jesus Christ
[2:19:00] on on Jordan Stormy Banks. I'd like to
[2:19:03] I'd like to sing that.
[2:19:06] You don't even have to look at the
[2:19:10] words if you don't. I'd like you to keep
[2:19:12] your mind on the Lord.
[2:19:16] You may be here and said,
[2:19:20] "Oh, Brother Ed,
[2:19:24] I just need some help this morning. I
[2:19:27] need an extra boost somehow,
[2:19:30] and I am moved. I'm stirred very deeply.
[2:19:34] and I I would desire that
[2:19:38] you and the church and others would pray
[2:19:40] with me and pray for me. You don't have
[2:19:43] to come forward. I'm not asking you to
[2:19:45] do that. You can if you wish. That would
[2:19:47] be fine. If you want to spend some time
[2:19:49] in prayer, I can't think of anything
[2:19:50] better to do. It's better than eating.
[2:19:53] It's better than drinking. It's better
[2:19:55] than dinner.
[2:19:59] But you just mind the Lord. Just do
[2:20:01] whatever you feel in your heart to do
[2:20:04] because that's what he'll respond to.
[2:20:11] [Music]
[2:20:13] On Jordan
[2:20:16] stormy
[2:20:17] banks I stand and cast a wishful
[2:20:24] eye
[2:20:26] toward Canaan fair and happy land where
[2:20:33] my possessions
[2:20:37] lie.
[2:20:39] I am bound for the prois land.
[2:20:46] I'm bound for the prois land.
[2:20:52] All who will come and go with me. I am
[2:20:59] bound for the prois land.
[2:21:04] I am bound for the prois lamb.
[2:21:11] I'm bound for the prois land.
[2:21:17] All who will come and go with me. I am
[2:21:25] for the pro.
[2:21:28] You know folks as we look east and as we
[2:21:30] look west and we look and we see our job
[2:21:32] or we see our responsibilities we see
[2:21:35] our homes we see our families and all
[2:21:37] those things are necessary and brother
[2:21:39] Brandon says that's
[2:21:42] those are standard those are things that
[2:21:43] we do and the comfort of our families
[2:21:49] but so much of our time is spending
[2:21:50] looking east and west and north and
[2:21:52] south.
[2:21:54] I would like to ask you let's look up.
[2:21:57] Amen. Amen.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Let's look up where our possessions lie.
[2:22:02] And then as we look at one another and
[2:22:03] say, "Come and go with me."
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; Come and go with me.
[2:22:09] It's on the other side.
[2:22:12] And God has admonished us in his word.
[2:22:14] And you heard this morning,
[2:22:17] walk
[2:22:18] conquering,
[2:22:20] walk with a resolve,
[2:22:23] stay tight with the word,
[2:22:26] and keep walking. And one day,
[2:22:30] as sure as I'm standing here, one day,
[2:22:32] fellas,
[2:22:35] sooner or later, but one day,
[2:22:38] we're going to take one step
[2:22:41] and the veil will be right here. And
[2:22:43] you'll have this foot in time. And
[2:22:45] you'll have this foot in eternity.
[2:22:47] You'll have this foot in mort mortal
[2:22:49] life. And you'll have this foot in
[2:22:50] immortality. We're here for just a very
[2:22:53] short time. It's a very short time.
[2:22:56] Where did the last year go to graduates?
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; And I talked to a brother. He said,
[2:23:01] "Five years? Where did that go to this
[2:23:03] brother this last week? Where did the
[2:23:05] five years go?" I said, "Exactly where
[2:23:07] the next five is going.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; Just a whisper and it's gone.
[2:23:15] I am bound for let's stand.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; I'm bound for the pro.
[2:23:27] [Music]
[2:23:34] I am down for the pro
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; on Jordan stormy
[2:23:44] bank
[2:23:46] and cast a wishful
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:23:56] [Applause]
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:24:06] I may not get to speak to all of you the
[2:24:09] way you are this morning.
[2:24:12] Some of the graduates are going
[2:24:14] different places.
[2:24:16] Maybe
[2:24:18] Jonathan is going to Phoenix. Is that
[2:24:21] right?
[2:24:23] And I don't know, brother Jess may be
[2:24:26] going someplace for a short time or
[2:24:28] whatever more. I don't know where where
[2:24:30] life will lead you.
[2:24:35] Don't forget
[2:24:37] if this would be my last service, don't
[2:24:39] forget this.
[2:24:41] The darkness
[2:24:43] also has a plan for you.
[2:24:47] He who abides in darkness has a plan for
[2:24:50] you. And brother Bisco's heart is
[2:24:54] gripped this morning to be violent with
[2:24:56] the enemy that he who has a a design for
[2:25:00] you will not achieve it.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; I want to prevent him of the wounds. I
[2:25:06] want to prevent him of the shackles. I
[2:25:08] want to prevent Satan. And I do stand in
[2:25:11] the name of Jesus Christ with this
[2:25:12] entire audience and oppose the plan and
[2:25:15] the scheme of a enemy.
[2:25:19] There's too many here
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; that have a testimony. Can tell you what
[2:25:23] those bands feel like and what that
[2:25:25] slavery is like. They can tell you what
[2:25:28] that drink is. They can tell you about
[2:25:30] alcoholism. They can tell you about
[2:25:32] drugs. They can tell you about all these
[2:25:34] attributes of the world. I say I say
[2:25:36] cast him out now.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; Don't entertain his suggestions.
[2:25:43] Amen.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; I'm given over to walk in the light as
[2:25:49] he's in the light.
[2:25:51] [Music]
[2:25:56] [Music]
[2:26:01] When shall I reach that happy
[2:26:06] place and be forever
[2:26:10] blessed?
[2:26:13] When shall I see my father?
[2:26:19] [Music]
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; I am bound for the pro.
[2:26:31] I'm bound for the pro.
[2:26:35] [Applause]
[2:26:37] All who will come and go with me. I am
[2:26:44] for the prois land
[2:26:50] with her heads bowed. And if Linda,
[2:26:51] you'll continue to play that.
[2:26:57] Oh Lord,
[2:27:00] I don't know if there's something about
[2:27:01] this song.
[2:27:04] No doubt something about the words,
[2:27:09] but there was also something about the
[2:27:11] people that were gathered on the bank.
[2:27:15] They had heard, I suppose many of them
[2:27:17] had already been baptized or sprinkled,
[2:27:21] but they had heard a word that said they
[2:27:23] should be
[2:27:25] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:27:27] Christ.
[2:27:29] And they were there obeying and one
[2:27:31] after the other walking into the river.
[2:27:35] And your servant and your messenger, one
[2:27:37] you'd call as your prophet to this
[2:27:39] generation.
[2:27:42] And then came a light, oh God, and a
[2:27:45] voice and a light. There was something
[2:27:46] about that atmosphere. And it was also
[2:27:49] the timing and the season.
[2:27:52] And now we're in that season. We're
[2:27:54] still under basking under the leadership
[2:27:59] and the guidance of that light.
[2:28:03] And I want to thank you,
[2:28:06] oh Lord, if I could just speak in some
[2:28:10] angelic tongue and give you the praise
[2:28:13] and the honor that you're due.
[2:28:16] Our lips are so feeble and our tongue,
[2:28:18] oh God, is so incapable of describing
[2:28:21] what's in our heart. But you that have
[2:28:24] led us thus far will lead us all the
[2:28:27] way.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; You that have brought each one that is
[2:28:31] sitting here today, oh God, do not allow
[2:28:34] them to escape the intensity of your
[2:28:38] presence as I feel now moving amongst
[2:28:41] the people. Oh God, do what you desire
[2:28:44] and do what it is that will be pleasing
[2:28:46] to you and do what it is that you can
[2:28:49] look upon and smile with your such a
[2:28:52] glorious smile of approval. There are
[2:28:54] those that are needy here, Lord. Those
[2:28:56] that dwelling in shadows.
[2:29:00] Oh, how I feel sorry for them. Oh Lord,
[2:29:03] I would do anything I could to lift them
[2:29:06] out of that dark place
[2:29:09] and let them walk. Oh God, where the
[2:29:13] saints have trod.
[2:29:16] Lord, our time has slipped on. We have a
[2:29:19] service coming this evening, but we
[2:29:21] don't want to shorten up what you would
[2:29:23] like to do.
[2:29:25] So, Father, I pray that you'll dismiss
[2:29:27] the people as they quietly leave.
[2:29:31] And as they greet one another, may it be
[2:29:33] beating in their heart.
[2:29:35] I'm bound for the promised land. I'm
[2:29:38] bound for the promised land. Oh, won't
[2:29:41] you come and go with me? I'll meet you
[2:29:43] there. I'll meet you in the morning.
[2:29:46] I'll meet you just inside the eastern
[2:29:48] gate. I'll meet you around the marriage
[2:29:50] supper table. I'll meet you there in the
[2:29:53] presence of our King and our Christ.
[2:29:55] I'll meet you there. Oh God, let that
[2:29:58] presence be surrounding everyone and
[2:30:01] permeate everyone as we will dismiss
[2:30:04] from this place. Dismiss us in your
[2:30:07] grace. I pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:30:10] Amen.
[2:30:13] Oh, who will come
[2:30:17] and go with me? I am bound.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Why don't we shake hands with one
[2:30:26] another? I am bound for the promise.
[2:30:35] I dismiss you in the name of Jesus
[2:30:36] Christ. I just dismiss you. We are
[2:30:38] dismissed in Jesus name.
