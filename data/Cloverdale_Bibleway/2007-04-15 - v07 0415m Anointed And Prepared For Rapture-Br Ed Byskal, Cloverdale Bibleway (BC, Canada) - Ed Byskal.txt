We've we've had a request come in this morning for a a very serious uh court case. And so that just kind of jumped out at me knowing that I had this song on my heart. And then brother Larry met me for his niece that's called and and asked us to pray and I thought he's our strong defense. Amen. And that's just a blessing when someone can have a need like that and they know who to call. Amen. They if if they didn't if they didn't have a respect for what brother Larry stands for and brother Dan also, they wouldn't have called and asked pray. Amen. But he's our defense.

You live to die and alone just like a rose trampled on the ground. You took the fall [Music] and thought of me [Music] &gt;&gt; and ask brother Dier if you'd come and open the service in a word of prayer. You know just because we don't have a long list of prayer requests doesn't mean that there aren't needs among us. Amen. And we just want to let the Lord come and just raise our faith. But we do want to remember this request that brother Larry has put in for his niece. She's down in in Costa Rica and was in involved in an accident. Three lives were lost. So, we're just trusting the Lord will come on the scene in a you know in a foreign country and and things like that. Amen. God can just meet every need and every if you're sick, whatever you're whatever you'd have on your heart, God can meet that. Just hearing yesterday the prophet going through the prayer line and he was praying for a lady, she had heart trouble and he just said, "You, sir, when I said heart trouble that something jumped in you and you're healed, too." Amen. So, we just don't know what's here. Amen. We We could pray for a court case. There may be others and and and it could just be over. Amen. Pray for a sickness and if your faith will rise, you can catch that healing. Amen. God's here to heal. Meet our needs. Brother Dier, if you'd come, just pray over this prayer cloth as well. This morning we find oursel again in your court. Father truly within our hearts we feel oh God this divine worship that comes from what you have done for us. Lord when we survey the great wonders whereby you left the rampard of glory to come and walk that way. Oh God, Abgol got a hill. You walk it alone, but to think that we're on your mind and you considered us, oh God, for the joy that was set before you, Father. You despised that cross. You endured the shame, Father. Oh God, you just went all the way, Father, until the very last drop of blood came out of your vein. And you said it was all finished, oh God. The veil of the temple was rent in twin, father to give us back this access into the holy of holies that we can have, oh God, the right to stand within the shakina glory today. Father, no matter what your condition, dear God, we know that behind the veil, the light of God will continuously shine. We know that in this place, the revival is ongoing. Father, the mana never grows still. Even Aaron Roth'sblooded Father, we believe tonight we're st this morning we're standing in that very same presence. Lord, all things are possible. The supernatural is available. Oh God, that which is impossible, oh God, cannot become possible. For the God of our salvation is alive here this morning. Lord, we're depending upon you. We're inviting you on the scene that you can work a mind of wonder today as you minister to our lives as you touch us, Father, from deep inside our soul. Revelate us, oh God. Quicken us by the Holy Spirit. Let your great, magnificent, holy blessing rest upon each son and daughter of God today. That's the purpose of our coming father with empty hands. For we're not depending, oh God, upon any merit that we have, any good things that we have done. Oh God, our unrighteousness is nothing but filthy rags. But oh God, you have clothed us in your very own unrighteousness that is whiter than snow. God, we believe that we're standing accepted in the beloved. Oh God, Father, we look to you again this morning that you'll just visit us. That you'll take your word, inspire your servant, Father, for you brought us in this hour of this great third exodus to be made ready, oh God, for this change of body. We want to lay aside every weight, every burden. Oh God, everything that is contrary, remove it from among us today. Take away the leaven, Father, that we may be one whole lump together, Father, united in one mind and one accord that are supernatural can indeed move among us. Those that are bound can be set free. Those that are discouraged can be encouraged. Oh God, those that are lost, they can be saved tonight. For we know in your presence, the supernatural is available. And we believe, oh God, as we invite your presence today, just come among us. Bring glory to your great name. For truly there's nothing, oh God, that can satisfy a hungry and thirsty soul today. Rather, the dear pentance after the waterbrook are so long after you. You, the living God. You're the only one, Father, that can meet the longing in our soul. Nothing else will do it today. We confess that we're needy. We confess that we have no one else but you, the living Christ. Do your oh God, your own desire today among us. Just take charge of this meeting. We committed to you, Father. We do not want any hindrance today. No spirit to hold back. Oh God, the move of God among us. Take your perfect liberty and speak to every heart. Anoint your servant. Lord, we thank you for the word that we've heard even on Wednesday. Father, I just oh God warm our hearts that you thinking of us Lord in this great hour of preparation. Oh God, we believe this message that came to us. It came to prepare us oh God and you gave the token, the very Holy Spirit of God for a consolation in this hour. You sent back the pillar of fire to vindicate your word. Father, have your way this morning. Glorify yourself. Dear Jesus, touch our lives. We're longing for more of you and we want to walk out of this meeting knowing that our hearts did not only burn within us, but you came and you spoke to us. You came and you touched us. Oh God, you healed the sick and you touched those that are weak. Today, Father, we commit this meeting to you. Even those that are sending the request for brother Larry, today we unite our heart, Father, that his niece will find you in the midst of our trial. that you are the living God. Dear Jesus and this prayer cloth, we lay our hands upon it. Oh God, not oh God having any worth in ourselves but looking at your word that you have justified us. You have sanctified us. Oh God, you have put your very own spirit within us that we can be your representative in this hour. When it goes and be laid upon the sick, cause them to recover that you can be magnified. That you're the same God that walked the shores of Galilee. You're the same one that was in attendance with that prophet. You're the same one today among us. So we believe, oh God, that you'll do what you desire among us. We give you thanks today. We give you praise and glory and honor, Father. We magnify your great name. We salute your August presence, Lord. We yield ourselves before you in humility and reverence. We come laying our lives down at your feet. Send the fire down. consume our sacrifice. Oh God almighty, just bring glory to your name as you move today. We commit this day to you. The morning service, the evening service. Lord, just have your preeminence. Do what you have purpose to do today. Remove all barrier. Take away every resistance and just break loose among us. Lord, do what you intend to do. Father, we yield oursel today. We surrender. Great God. Oh Jesus, there's no one like you today. We just love you, Father. We love your appearing. We love the fact, oh God, that you thought of us. You thought of us today to gather us in your presence, oh God almighty. Just have your way. Have your way Jesus. We give this service unto you in Jesus name. And for your glory alone, we thank you, Father. can have your seats. Ryan, you can keep playing that if you would. We just have a few announcements as well. Want to remind everyone that there's no service this Wednesday, April the 18th. They're going to be uh doing some maintenance and upgrades on the sound system, I guess. So, that's this coming Wednesday. This week, the 18th, there's no service. So just make sure that you uh take note of that. Also, brother Jeremy just has a note here. Senior choir practice for this afternoon has been cancelled. So senior choir, you can rest your voices and sing that much louder tonight. Amen. In the service that it helped me out. We also have uh an announcement. Brother Lyle and Sister Hannie Kemper, Brother Ron, and Sister Pam Gablick like to announce the engagement of their children, Brother Kyle and Sister Sharon. Amen. So, God bless them. Says, "A fall wedding is planned." Amen. We're just happy for them. And I had to think, you know, it's not really a a surprise when something that's that's wonderful, but you think, well, you take two young people that have just given their lives to God, and you know, that's just God. It's not really a surprise or a shock when he just does something like that. We just appreciate that and appreciate them. Let's just sing this one more time. is crucified, laid behind the stone. Oh, crucified, lay behind the stone. You live to die, rejected and alone like a treble on the ground. You took the ball and thought of me [Music] all above all powers. Above all powers. Above all kings. Above all nature and all created, [Music] above all wisdom and all the ways of men. [Music] Oh, you were here before the world began. Above all kingoms, above all, [Music] above all wonderers the world has ever known. of all the treasures of the earth. [Music] There's no way to measure up your word. [Music] Lay behind the stone. You live, you live to die. Rejected and alone like trampled on the ground. You took the fall and guarded me. Sister Natasha and brother Jeremy and Sister Liz have a song for us as they'd come sing. There is none like you Jesus. No one else can touch my heart like you do. I can search for all et [Music] like you. [Music] &gt;&gt; There is none like you. No one else can touch my heart like you do. [Music] I could search for all eternity [Music] and find there is none like you. [Music] Father, it's hard to see it now. You feel you're walking all alone, but he is there. When the storm around you rages and you're tossed to and fro. When you're faced with life's decisions, not sure which way to go. Stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. &gt;&gt; When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. &gt;&gt; When the enemy [Music] And the walls are [Music] wonder [Music] that his arms were reaching out. You can rest assured and be secure. God is moving right now. Stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; When you feel you have reached the end, He'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. Stand still and let God move. Standing still is hard to do. When you feel you have reached the end, he'll make a way for you. Stand still and let God move. The answer will come, but only in his time. Stand still and let God. [Music] Stand still. [Music] Amen. Not worried about so much about whether God will move, but it's just getting ourselves out of the way. Let's stand as brother Ed comes singing I love you Lord and I lift my voice. Amen. Anxious to hear what the Lord has for us this morning. I love you, Lord, [Music] and I lift my voice [Music] to worship you, oh my soul, rejoice. mighty in what you hear. Let it be a sweet sweet sound in glory. [Music] I love &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I lift my voice to worship you, oh my soul, rejoice. Take for my king in what you hear. There be a sweet, sweet sound in your ear. [Music] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord. I [Music] live my [Music] toship you all my soulj [Music] my I [Music] let it be a sweet sweet. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is it wonderful to be in God's house this morning? Nice to see the church is full. Trust your hearts are full. &gt;&gt; We're waiting for the word. My heart is full. &gt;&gt; We're just looking to the Lord. I enjoyed the song that Sister Natasha and Jeremy and Sister Liz sang. Sometimes it's not easy to do to stand still, but that's so important to do. And uh that that's the that's the scripture that's in the front of the brother Brandham's tabernacle right at the front. Stand still. Know that I'm God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I think that we'll uh just go to the word. We'll be done our singing. Thanks, brother Ryan. Musicians. Uh I would like to have you remember in special prayer if you would on a continual basis uh there's a a lot of brothers that are applying for visitation visas to come to the convention and uh we had a I have a email from brother Jeremiah in Zimbabwe. He just said things are difficult there but we have sent him the documents and he is a they're applying for visas to come and there's brethren from all different countries and some countries are just much more difficult to get a visa to come and visit here at this time. So if you would pray that pray this prayer that God will make a way and so that Satan cannot restrict or hinder anybody who's supposed to be here. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to pray that everyone who's supposed to be here will be here. And uh and then also I'd like you to just remember in prayer there are things and I don't know exactly how to describe them but there are I would say some of the more major happenings some of the more major events within the realm of the message especially with propagating and getting the message out. Some of the most I was most significant things are not spoken of over the pullpit because you know when brother like brother Brennham said when you say it and it gets out then the devil gets a hold of it and he sure does he gets a hold of it. So we just came to the conclusion quite some time ago. We just won't say anything and then finally you know it seeps out and there it is. Then it happens and uh sometimes the people don't even know how it happened or where it happened and some of the things been working on for two years, three years, four years. Four years. I've personally been working on things for four years that have not really been made known. And uh I'm sure that happens with perhaps a lot of places. I don't know. But that's something that I have found is is almost essential. You just quietly keep working at it and and and God's work just keeps going on. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't know. Well, I do know, but I know that you rejoice. I just don't know if you rejoice as much as I do when I hear how the how the word of God and the message is getting out. And quite frankly, I don't care how it gets out. And I don't care who does it. I'm just Let's get this over with. Amen. Let's go home. &gt;&gt; Let's get the last one. I can't understand people say, "You can't do it. I got to do it." Oh, no. You do it. I'll be happy if you do it. You do it. Someone else does it. I don't care who does it. I don't care what preacher does it. I don't care what church does it. Let's just have it done. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm sure I have your support in that. So, pray about these things earnestly if you would please. Amen. I appreciate your prayers uh for myself and for the services. And tonight, our brother John Andy's is going to be speaking. So, we'll pray for the services today. Let's just look to the Lord before we turn to the word. Father, we've heard the songs and have joined in in the worship. We prayed this morning, oh God, that the worship would be a sweet incense before you that the spirits, our spirits, for your prophet said that each one of us, we have that human spirit. It needs to be quietened. Needs to be brought into subjection of the Holy Ghost. Pray father today that the your divine spirit will take absolute control of every thought of our minds of our hearts and spirits. Oh God, then the word can be delivered, oh God, down that channel to our souls. We will feed. We'll be strengthened. We'll be benefited. The enemy will be defeated. We'll rejoice over his defeat. We'll rejoice over his loss. We'll rejoice, oh God, as we stand victorious. And I pray you'll come and give us an illumination, Lord. Uh give us revelation, I pray. May the lights go on, oh God. May the darkness be banished, I pray, at this time, for it is the rising of the sun. We're so thankful. We glory in what you're doing. Now, illuminate us, Lord, and anoint us, I pray, each one as I speak as the people here. All those that are streaming in that invisible congregation. Oh God, be so present and near them. May it be a sweet fellowship where they are as well. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I'm going to read three places out of uh the book of Revelation. And you can turn if you will to the seventh chapter. Uh where we will be reading from the ninth verse. And when you get there, I just want to make a couple of comments before we read. I've been speaking to you on the rapture. Anointed for rapture. I want to speak this morning. Anointed and prepared for rapture. Now, uh, in connection with the anointing, brother Brandham makes this phrase many times and you're all familiar with it. I want you to just really think deep as we go through the service this morning. Everything that God was, everything that was in God rather, God poured into Christ. And everything that was in Christ, he poured into the believer. God above us, God with us, and God in us. This phrase actually capsulizes my entire subject of the of of the anointing. Because the very act of anointing of pouring into that is exactly why the anointing they poured the oil on and that is where that whole concept. So the whole concept that took place on earth starting with Jacob and working all the way through the scripture, Jacob anointing a stone, pouring oil on a stone, God commanding Moses to make oil, make sweet sensing, incense type oil, anoint the priests, pour it onto the high priest. Samuel pouring it onto King David, making him king. And that became the whole concept of the anointing. And then Jesus coming and saying, "The spirit of the Lord hath anointed me." And then he breathed upon the disciples before he left. And then the spirit of God came into the church. You understand? Came into the church. And now the anointing actually is the word of God impregnated with the very creative life of God coming to its desired to its ordained place into the believer and that life is ordained by God to bring about what the promise is for the season &gt;&gt; and that's what the anointing is. So we have received the anointing for the promise for this season. The promise for this season is the rapture and the change of these bodies. &gt;&gt; And we have received that. And so all that God was, he poured into Christ. All that Christ was, he poured into the church. And that is the process. And then there's a scripture in which we won't read, but I'll just I wanted just have your attention. There's a scripture in in Exodus that God commanded Moses. They said, "Thou shalt these garments," he said, "Thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother and his sons with him, and thou shalt anoint them and consecrate them and sanctify them." So now we find that the anointing and being consecrated and being sanctified, which is made holy, are all linked together. So I want to extend this this sanctifying of ourselves and making ourselves available to God. And that's really where we are coming to Lord willing this morning. And so if I kind of repeat myself a wee bit, I hope you won't mind. Now reading from Revelation the 9th the 7th chapter verse 9. After this and incidentally just prior from this verse one down through verse 8 is the sealing of the 144,000. And then after this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the Lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands, and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God, which siteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood around about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God, saying, "Amen. Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever. Amen." And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed with white robes? And whence came they? And I said unto them, Sir, thou knowest. See, Brother Brandon makes a point of that. He said, John knew the 12 tribes in their order, in their tribal order. This great vast multitude, he did not know who they were. Thou knowest. And he said unto me, these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God and serve him day and night and in his temple. And he that siteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore, neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. So now we have the sealed 144,000 group. We have this great number. Brother Brandham says that is the bride. And I would like to read then just in ver in chapter 6 uh chapter 6 verse 9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar souls of them, now it's another group, see that were slain uh for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. These were not slain for the testimony of Jesus Christ. They are Jews. They were slain for the testimony of the word of God. The Bible came forth from the Jews. And so that's a distinct group. And uh and verse 10, and they cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" And white robes were given unto every one of them. And it was said unto them that they should rest uh yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled. That souls under the altar. And one last reading. Thanks for remaining standing. Verse uh chapter 20 of of Revelation and verse 11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which are written were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. May God bless his word as we take our seats in these three scripture readings which we have. Every person in this building, every person under my under the sound of my voice, and every man and every woman, every human on earth, these three scriptures encompass them all. And that's a sobering thing. And it's also a glorious thing, but it's a sobering thing. That's why we're here. That's why God sent a messenger. That's why certain scriptures are coming to life. That is why we are to sanctify ourselves to set ourselves aside because we of all peoples are in a very very uh living in a very unique time. Living in a wonderful time and living in a dreadful time. dreadful time for the unbeliever and a glorious time for the believer. But even as believers, we're living in a treacherous time. &gt;&gt; And anyone who can support what I say today, I want you to support it with all your heart and soul. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, grip my heart and grip everyone else's heart." We are living in a glorious time for the believer. And yet it is a treacherous time because Satan has he had he is relentlessly doing everything he can to pressure your life, my life, to affect us, to afflict us, afflict us, to do everything he can to deter us, to detain us. Even though he knows he cannot stop us, but he will do everything he can to do that, to just be a hindrance. That's his nature to be an adversary. That's his nature to be an unbeliever because he's he is an unbeliever. There is no truth in him. So he he will not stop speaking just because there's no truth in him. He will still continue to speak and what he speaks is a lie because Jesus said there's no truth in him. But he will keep speaking in hopes that he can affect your mind and get you to believe something that he's saying. And even if he even if he even if you deny and turn them aside 99% he'll just keep speaking so he can get that 1% there. Got to try to stop these people and hinder this witness and hinder this testimony. And and God on the other hand has given us has given us I believe more than adequate uh strength and enlightenment. So these scriptures that we read this morning, I want everyone to really seriously understand it's not just Brother Biscll speaking. This is your future. &gt;&gt; We're reading about your future. And there's no one here that wants to be so ignorant so as to think that God somehow missed you. We all are here in one of these scriptures. We're not going to be. We're not the souls under the altar. We're not that group. We are called. And the reason why you're here, I trust, is that you have been called by a message. I young people, I wouldn't want you to feel, well, I'm here because I'm forced to be here. I I'm there's an imposition on me to be here. I'm really not interested to be here. If if that is your thought this morning, I would just say, where do you put yourself in these scriptures? &gt;&gt; Because I'm talking about your future. If there'd be someone here that has something that has God has been dealing with and dealing with and dealing with and dealing with and you've kind of become accustomed to having something that you know is displeasing to God, I would I I'm not going to tell you where we are, but I would say you are in these scriptures and so you need to place yourself in those scriptures. But if you say on the other hand, I am I I I I I am the object of the of the love and grace of God that has come to me when I was in such darkness, when I was in such confusion, when I was uh uh didn't even have a desire for it. And God came my way and gripped my soul. And I found these things glorious. I I've moved along and I've had my difficulties, had my troubles, but we've kept going on. And this is my ambition. This is my desire. And I'm consumed by it. And if God speaks to me, to dedicate myself, rededicate myself, consecrate myself, I'm here to be washed by the water of the word. I'm here. Then then you're in another group because God even put that within you. And so the word is being sent to us that we might uh be strengthened, edified, built up, and that the enemy will certainly be defeated. So this scripture and the message this morning encompasses your future. This life is the only time you have to do what you're going to do with regards to your eternal future. We are not having a second chance. We're not going to be improving things after we die. There's no special place. Whatever you're going to do with regards to your future, you're going to do it now. &gt;&gt; You want to establish that. And and so many of us, we're making preparations. We've got to prepare. We go to school. We get further education. We study. We train. We have families. And we have futures to think about. And we always talk planning for the future. Planning for the future. But if we plan for all the future with our thoughts in mind that it's somewhere here on this earth, we're really missing the whole purpose. Our future is on the other side. &gt;&gt; And we're all going to end there. &gt;&gt; Every single one of us going to end there in in one of these groups that's described in the scripture. You're going to be there. Regardless of what you think of of of of this church or of any other religion or whatever more, we are going to be there. And if I were you, and this is my solemn counsel and advice to every person under the sound of my voice, I believe that our future, which the scripture speaks about on the other side, should be the centerpiece of our lives. It ought to consume our thoughts. We ought to be having it in the morning &gt;&gt; and in small things. &gt;&gt; I was I just took a little break and I thought, well, you know, they deliver several local little newspaper rags to my door and I don't even know how to get rid of them. and they just, you know, they drop those local little newspapers for the community out in front of front of our door and we pick them up. And so I was consumed and my thoughts were so engrossed with the message and and after a number of hours, you just need to break away. And I thought, well, I just sit down and I I looked at that that paper that was there and and I just said, now would I be moving towards sanctification by reading that or would I be better off without it? And I just decided I'd be better off without it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing in that paper that's going to sanctify me. going to tell me what the local stuff is and some little society and and and what development is happening here and uh who's who's complaining and the editorial and all the rest of it. It's just a little local harmless rag, but I just decided it had no contribution to my sanctification and had zero contribution to my message this morning. I said, "Let the thing stay there. &gt;&gt; Chuck it in the garbage probably as fast as we can." Not because there's anything evil with it, but it just doesn't have any contribution to a sanctified life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we know we're on the right track. In the text, Apostle Paul, Apostle, I'm sorry, Apostle uh John said, "After this, I beheld and lo a great uh multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues." Some might say this was a great ecumenical gathering, but I would like to say, well, it was a great multicultural gathering. North America, United States, Canada, they I won't say they pride themselves, but yet I think it's a terminology that you understand. They do pride themselves. like to think of themselves. I think both nations like to think of themselves as being compassionate nations. When there's trouble in the world, they want to extend themselves. If there's poverty, extreme poverty in the world, they want to extend themselves and be compassionate. And of of all countries, I think that we can say that they have become identified as melting pots for all tongues and kindreds and of of people and tribes and languages. And I was thinking of this, I thought in connection with the church that is right here, we have probably somewhere between 30 and 40 actual nationalities. These aren't just from way way back your where your roots came from. These are people that have come from different countries and different nations in the world. And each one having their own culture, having their own upbringing, and then yet coming and we gather into one nation or two nations as we're represented here. And uh and then the nation itself whether it be Canada, United States, the nation itself begins to develop its own uh unique kind of culture which is a fusion or a blending of all of the cultures that have come and then it develops into a unique culture of its own. &gt;&gt; You follow me? uh and and so you end up having uh some nations I mean you know that's largely uh they are as their name implies and that is their country when you say United States of America but I mean there are large vast numbers of people be they Hispanics or be they from African and whether they be from Europe or whatever more but it just becomes a huge melting pot and that in itself because the nation opened their doors, opened the open their arms as as Canada prides themselves in that too. Well, there's trouble in a there's trouble in a certain place. People are dying. People are starving. People are under the threat of a cruel a cruel dictator. So they open their arms and and take so many from be it the Soviet Union or be it from Africa or be it from whatever part of the world. Open their arms and and receive them into their nation and then that within itself develops into a very unique uh a unique type of culture of its own. You said where are you going brother Biscol? Well, many of you that are right here are here because the countries opened up and made a way for you to come. And so we can say that the nations, they like to think of themselves as being compassionate. Well, I've read of a group here. I read of a group and I beheld a great multitude. which no man could number. &gt;&gt; And there were all nations and all kindreds and the people and tongues and they stood before the throne and the lamb. You talk about a multicultural gathering. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That is a multicultural gathering. And those that Apostle John saw got there because someone was compassionate. Someone said, "These people are in the shadows, living in the shadows of death. These people are living. They're starving. &gt;&gt; They have no spiritual food whatsoever. These people are in dire straits &gt;&gt; and something has to be done. &gt;&gt; And first we'll make a way. We'll open up the doors. We'll send out ambassadors. We'll proclaim the deliverance and the gospel of Jesus Christ and we'll let them come in. Hallelujah. And it made a unique group of people. They're called the bloodbought. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're called the bride of Jesus Christ. They're called the body of Jesus Christ. And they're one body. They're one bread. But they come from many places, many tongues, many peoples, many kindreds, many tribes, many nations, but they're one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't it a glorious body? and how they how they got there, how they came to be in this in this vast multitude. And so I say to this this church I believe this church is unique not because of you, not because of me, not because of but because of him. And I trust that you're here because you feel God led me here. And if God led me here and God led you here and God led us to be here together such as we are, then we also need to say, "What do you have me here for?" And I can tell you it's for an eternal purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's for an eternal purpose. It's for a witness. It's that the whole congregation, you as an individual are a witness, but we as a body of people are a witness. We're here to be a stable witness. We're here to be able to declare that the unity of the body of Jesus Christ is more blessed. The unity I was thinking on, I want to preach on what is the value of unity. Unity is worth more than my feelings. &gt;&gt; Unity is worth more than the chip that's on anybody's shoulder. Unity is worth more than my ideas. Unity is worth more. Unity is is without without value. We can't put a value on it. Unity is so precious. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why the scripture says you strive for the unity. And God has given us wonderful unity. I got thinking many times how many years that people have sat in this congregation and it's just like a decree that God has given even though Satan has tried to attack it from so many different direction we've been able to go year after year 5 years and 10 years and 20 years and go year after year and just have a be gripped with the peace of God and the stability and the enemy fights and sends his arrows and sends his targets and tries to do tries to take people down and it's as though God says you're not going to do it. I put a wall of fire about them. Hallelujah. We need to maintain that. Not so we can have a happy time. Maintain it for our testimony. Maintain it for the witness of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a rarity. &gt;&gt; It's a rarity and you need to treasure it. You need to treasure it. You need to protect it and say regardless of what comes, I won't allow anything to divide me from my brother, my sister. It is too precious. I won't allow Satan to do it. I won't allow any devil to do it. I won't allow any instrument of Satan to do it. I'm protecting it because God has given it to us and it's a great treasure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now in the future home in the rapture message rather brother Brandham says now we've had three raptures three raptures in the Old Testament as a witness. Enoch was one. Elijah was the other one and Jesus was the other one. Jesus being the keystone. Now, he was the keystone of the three. Says, "We all know that Enoch was translated. We know that Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind in a chariot of fire and Jesus died, buried, rose up, and lived here on earth, and then was raptured up." The keystone, there's three that bear record. Now those are the three I wanted today to take those three and in preparation for the rapture I was going to look at each one of these three which are a witness to our rapture. It happened to them, each one, Enoch, Elijah, and Jesus, so that it would be a witness to us, that this rapture is a reality and how what they did and how they prepared themselves or how God prepared them for it. I thought it would be good to look at, but I can cannot do that today because I feel led in a different direction. He said, "Now there has been one rapture already passed in the New Testament." And that's Matthew 27, chapter uh 27th chapter and the 45th verse. And it says this, "And the graves were opened. And many of the bodies of the saints that slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many." He said one rapture is passed and the second rapture will be the catching away of the bride and the third one is the two witnesses in Revelation 11 11 and 12 and their dead bodies laid in the streets. The two witnesses go to Israel. Their dead bodies are in the streets for three and a half days and then the spirit of life comes into them and they are raptured. are taken up into heaven. And and there are your three raptures of the New Testament. Three raptures of the Old Testament, three raptures in the New Testament. He said, "Now we're ready waiting for the rapture of the saints. And now you have an Elijah vindicated messenger." Now you say, "Well, we believe in it." And the saints have believed in it for all of these centuries. But now we have never, the earth has never had sent to it this kind of a sign, the sign of the Messiah, the sign of the resurrection. He said it. And now he he says these words, "And now we're waiting for the rapture of the saints. It's been spoken and so shall it be." &gt;&gt; You know, we don't have to go any further. It's been spoken and so shall it be. The thing that must consume us is that I want to now prepare myself, sanctify myself, do everything I can to make myself available to how God is dealing, how God is speaking, how God is leading us as a group of people and how he speaks to us individually that I will be prepared for that great moment. &gt;&gt; We might say, well, we can do nothing ourselves. No, we cannot do anything ourselves as far as works for attaining it because it's God in his grace that gives it to us. But there are things that we do. Uh otherwise the scripture which I said on on Wednesday that they the the scripture said that they turn their heart turn their heart towards God. See and that is something that we do on a daily basis but I won't get into that right now. Then in the Sardisian church age, but the rapture, he said the rapture is not the only roll call. There are there at the second there at the second resurrection at the great white throne judgment will names be confessed. Now these are some that are not going in the rapture. They're come up before the great white throne judgment. But even here what he says about the white throne judgment. He says, "Names will be confessed before the father and his angels." He says, "Now I've been told by those who know that the sweetest sound to the human ear is the sound of a person's name." He said, "But no earthly voice will ever sound your name as sweetly as will the voice of God if your name is in the book of life." and remains there to be revealed before the holy angels. What a day that will be when we hear Jesus say, "Father, they confessed me, confessed my name before men in the days of their earthly pilgrimage. Now I will confess their names before thee and all the holy angels." I tell you friends, if we only got that this morning and went home and said, "That will be the criteria for my life." When I wake up in the morning, that'll be the criteria. I want to hear that voice. I want to hear my name called &gt;&gt; before the angels, holy angels. &gt;&gt; I want to bring it to holiness as well, but I can't do it just now. But brother Brandham says that God is so holy that the angels look dirty. That's holy. That is holy. The anointing sanctifying the people, consecrating them is part of the process. God, he cannot diminish in his holiness. He cannot diminish in his sacred presence. He can't. But what God does is he his grace is magnified by taking the likes of us and bringing us through the process of cleansing until we are acceptable in his presence. That to me is the most glorious thing that a God that's so holy, a God that's so righteous, a God that's so unapproachable is a God that can stoop down and make a way for the likes of you and I to come into his presence and call us holy, a holy people. You're a holy generation. How wonderful that is. But we never want to lose sight of the holiness of God. We never want to lose sight of that so that we would become careless. And this world is is determined to make us dull concerning God's things, occupied, busy, consumed. And that's why this dangerous. It's not there's nothing wrong with being busy. We're all busy. But we don't want our busyiness. We don't want the things that occupy our lives to make our to to so consume us and and snare us and trap us. so that our thoughts are consumed with a place that we're not going to spend here very long. &gt;&gt; We're going to go out of here very soon. Friends, I'm talking about being ready for a place where you're going to live for eternity. In these scriptures we read this morning, the plan of redemption has been completed. The plan that was in the mind of God has been completed and we're into another civilization. This civilization, as you know, and I need to really be as emphatic as possible, this civilization is of Satan. &gt;&gt; Every government is of Satan. &gt;&gt; They wouldn't want to hear me say that, but that is the truth. And as I was in Ottawa and that's a s the seat of government for our country and I said to the people you know just down the street just over here in our parliament the party that's in now it has a certain voice and they may institute good things and whatever more. We have nothing to say about that. We're not into politics. But then soon as maybe that government moves out or that administration becomes defeated, another president or another prime minister comes in, they'll have another voice. They'll set aside some of the things that the last government had and they'll institute new things and it'll be another voice. We're going in another direction. We're Republican. We're liberal. We're Democrat. We're conservative. We're this. We're that or the other thing. And they'll have a different voice. But I was saying to the people in Ottawa, this church has one voice. Although although we are here today multicultural, this church has one voice. And it doesn't change with one administration to another. We're under the administration of the son of man. We're under the administration of our husband, the Lord Jesus Christ. And we'll have one voice today. It'll be the same tomorrow, this year, and next year. And it'll be the same when we're carried away into a rapture time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in the in the message, things that are to be, he said, I want to prove to you that education and science, civilization, all of these things, I'd like you to notice, please, this phrase. I take what the prophet of God says with great seriousness. I digest the very phrasing. I want to prove to you education and science and civilization and all of these things that we seemingly so enjoy today. I'm glad he put that seemingly that we seemingly so enjoy is of Satan and will perish. I seemingly enjoy my car &gt;&gt; and I seemingly enjoy the fact that you all have cars and able to get here today. &gt;&gt; I I seemingly enjoy that we have a comfortable place with an atmosphere that we're not shivering too cold and we're not, you know, too hot in here and we've kind of got things balanced out. I seemingly enjoy that the sound system, you know, works and so on and you're able to hear it and all that, but I can't say that I enjoy it because I know there's a better there's a better place to worship and there's a better way to travel. &gt;&gt; You want a Ford or a Chrysler or do you want to travel like a thought? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, I can't even imagine that." Well, few years ago, they couldn't even imagine a man going up in a up in space. They couldn't even imagine. It was just out of their thoughts, out of their mind. Can you imagine people actually going up on on things that are are literally volatile rockets and being thrust up into space? Why? We couldn't have thought of that. I mean, even as a kid, you'd have thought that was insane. I used to say when I was a boy, I was a little tikeke. You know how the how the kids come up with phrases? See, they have little sayings. And when I was a kid, they'd say, "Go like 60." And my dad had thunk me right on the head. Edward, don't say that. You know, nobody can go 60. That's in my lifetime. I got thunked on the head many times. Don't say that. You know, nobody can go 60. That's always brought up. 60. They're saying 0 to 60 in how many seconds? &gt;&gt; Things have changed. &gt;&gt; But is it better? No, it's not better. They're racing down the streets killing people. And they the whole country gets up in arms because maybe one person gets killed and and the and the booze and all the liquor and all the rest of it kills more. And they kill even in the wars, &gt;&gt; but they don't do a thing about it. &gt;&gt; This civilization is of the devil. &gt;&gt; And there's another civilization. &gt;&gt; And he says, he says, "So there will be a civilization in the world that we're going to." Are you going there? &gt;&gt; That we're going to. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Are you going there? &gt;&gt; You ought to be enthused about it. &gt;&gt; Are we going there? There's a civilization that we're going to, but it won't be this kindness of civilization. For in this civilization, we have sickness. We do. And if you're sick here today, the civilization we're going to doesn't have it. In fact, is there's a power there's a power that has come to us from that civilization that tells us we can defeat that sickness in this civilization. There's sorrow, there's lust, there's death. Everything in this civilization's wrong. But in the civilization that there will be there'll be none of these things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At one time all of these things were a great mystery secret in the mind of God. But now it's been completed. &gt;&gt; And God begin to bring forth his thought. And now I just want to rehearse and summarize. God begin to bring forth his thought. God help me now. You followed me all right thus far? &gt;&gt; I don't want you to think I'm too far way off on left field someplace. But God began to bring his thought now. Now I I I want to just take how brother Brandham says we take this little picture and I need to go back to it and this great eternal being little light like spun off of it. He said that was the logos. Another place he says that was the anointed word. Another place he says that was the son. The son, not the s u n but the s o n. That was the son. That's why John one can say in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and all things were made by him. Because that and that's why Jesus when he came he says I proceeded from the father I proceeded I came out from the father now we have a prophet telling us how that happened in this great being eternal being that no one could understand no one could grasp out from at some place in the great vast eternities God was going to begin his creative and and out from him came that little white light the logos the word the anointed word and it's coming out. It's it's the son. It's the son of God. It's the attribute coming out from God that's going to create and God began to create all of these things. And then the fall, the transgression, and still even in that mind of God and that logos which he sent out was also the full redemption. Not only was he going to create and he knew it would fall, but within that within that very attribute he sent out was also the strength and the power for full redemption to bring it all back. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? &gt;&gt; You're following that real close now. And so the fall comes and God comes to an Abraham and gives him a promise to him and his seed. And and it's always a promise. It's the word because it's the logos which came out from God. And now he's he's actually going to create he's going to build a masterpiece. Oh my, you have to help me. I got so much I I've got to try to get it all said here in a little while. And then comes an Isaac and then a Jacob. There's the three corners. Joseph is going to come. Joseph's perfection. But Jacob, he's he's a shyster and he's actually running from his he's running from his uh from his brother. And he lays down. And when he lays down, he takes a stone for a pillow and and he has a dream and he dreams. And in his dream, the ladder's on earth and it goes into heaven. And he sees angels descending and ascending, messengers coming down and going up. And he awakens. And he says, "This is none other than the gate of heaven. This is the house of God. Now, this has gone through his mind because he's dreamed it. It's in his mind. What God is doing, God is actually causing him, not forcing him, but causing him to do something because he's going to express what was actually in the mind of God. It came out of the mind of God. And and what was coming out of the mind of God is that he was pouring out of himself which needed to be identified on earth as a pouring as an anointing. So Jacob gets up and he takes the stone that his head was on. He thought I I've had an experience. This has gone through my mind. This is something that I must not forget. This is a special place. This is the gate of heaven. I'm going to come back to this place. I'm going to remember this place. This is the This is the house of God. I'll call it Bethl. &gt;&gt; What'll I do to identify this place? I'll take this stone that my head was on when all of this went up and I'll pour oil upon it. And that was the first instance of anointing because God was giving an act on earth which actually was out from his own sort, his own bosom because God was pouring out &gt;&gt; onto the earth. of his own self. &gt;&gt; And so he pours it out. Then as I said earlier, then then it moved on to Moses making the oil for the anointing. Then further anoint the priests. Anoint them because there's going to be a priesthood that will be anointed someday. And that's why the scripture says you're a you're a holy priesthood. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're an anointed priesthood. &gt;&gt; You follow me? And then you'll take the high priest and now you'll anoint him because Aaron the the Aaronic priesthood would end and the Melzdc priesthood which was the Lord Jesus Christ would come and that's why he comes in Luke the 4th chapter starts right out he says this he just coming of age the first thing he does comes into the synagogue as was his custom watch in the synagogue if you ever been in a synagogue they have a table over here and the scrolls are brought out the Torah brought out and rolled out and and and the one who stands to read. That's what the bar mitzvah is all about. When a young Jewish boy comes to age, when he's going to be able to come and take and read the scroll and so Jesus now, a young man, he comes and stands at the table and the Bible says the priest brought to him as it was in birth pains. He couldn't find it in his new Bible. And the priest brought to him the word and he's looking for a scripture. Brother Brandham's looking for a certain scripture wanting to preach birth painans. He can't find the scripture. And then the priest brought him the book and he found the scripture where it is to read. And the next time he reads this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears because now it's unveiling to him what's happening. And Jesus came. They brought the scroll to him. And the Bible is very specific. Says, "And he found the place where it was written that the Lord hath anointed me. The spirit I'm anointed. The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me." And he begins to identify what he's been anointed. In other words, it's been poured into me and I'm pouring it out now. I'm anointed to deliver the captive. I'm anointed to heal the sick. I'm anointed to loose the prisoner out of his prison. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then as he comes to the end of his short ministry, he breathes upon the disciples to signify that the very breath of God will not only be breathed onto them, but will breathe into them. And you go and tarry until the Holy Spirit. And when the spirit of God came, it was the very spirit of the creator, the spirit that was in Jesus Christ came into the believer. And that is why the baptism of the Holy Ghost is such a significant and important part because that is the new birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the plan. the plan of redemption. Now, brother Brandham says in uncertain sound it there's a phrase which we all have heard. There's two things that are certain. Death in taxes. You've heard it. And he says, "Oh no, taxes isn't too certain. the Lord may come. &gt;&gt; Not many here pay taxes. You'd be rejoicing. &gt;&gt; I said taxes aren't too certain. &gt;&gt; The Lord may come. &gt;&gt; Sounds better. He says they can charge it off then all over. Then they said death is certain. No sir, death isn't certain. No, indeed there might be a rapture. Then there's no death. Death isn't certain. No, no. He says, "Not in this day." &gt;&gt; It was many years ago, but not now. Death is not too certain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Death is not too certain. And the people said, "Amen. So be it." &gt;&gt; One thing is certain. that after this brief life, we'll either be with God or separated from him. And my entire purpose in life is to see that people are make their calling and election sure. What preparation has God made for us? And this is the preparation that I've been speaking about. The anointing that's been poured out onto us. This preparation, this anointing that I've been speaking about is God's preparation to return us back in our full position as sons and daughters of God. The scripture says, Apostle Paul speaking to all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not just called to be a church, called to be saints. And then he said to the Corinthians unto the church of God which is at Corenth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be saints. Hallelujah. We're not called just to, you know, just to kind of make our way and stumble along through life. We're we are sanctified in Christ Jesus. Separated. Sanctified means set apart &gt;&gt; for the exclusive right of the one who set you apart. &gt;&gt; We are under his we are part of his exclusive property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sanctified, consecrated to him, set apart. Say, well, how do we do that? Well, I think we ought to examine our our life, our agenda, the things that we are engaged in and just say, you know, is this fully necessary or could I spend this time is is this really what he wants me to think about? Is this really what he wants me to uh you know, we have our lives to live. And if we're a farmer, be the best farmer you can. Housewife, be the best housewife. whatever God has led you to be, but don't let it be your master. Let it be your servant. &gt;&gt; Don't let it tell you how you're going to live your life and how you're going to serve your God, lest it become an idol. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Anything can become an idol. &gt;&gt; Your car can become an idol. Your home can become an idol. Your church can become an idol. Anything that is put ahead of God becomes an idol. Your family can become an idol. &gt;&gt; So, we want to move all those idols out of the way. &gt;&gt; So, we're called to be saints. And he says in Timothy, who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. And so now I want to move to this question in view of this holy calling. I felt to really make this service that God would grant that this atmosphere, this service would be indeed different and perhaps even sober because I want you to think so deeply that when you leave here, it will have stayed with you and it will affect your thoughts and affect your future. In view of this holy calling and in view of the fact that we're living in the season that we're in, a rapture season, and we're seeking to prepare ourselves for that time. And I really quite frankly don't believe that we can just be Sunday go to meeting Christians and have that happen. I believe this is a daily thing. You only come here to become instructed and you go home to live it out. &gt;&gt; You go to your work and live it out &gt;&gt; your in your daily life. But in view of this season and in view of the coming of the Lord, the question is what preparation should we be making for the rapture? in questions and answers. Uh oh yes, here here I was I was giving the actual quote where brother Brandham now talks about uh how the anointing came down to us. But I want to I want to slip away from that and return back refer back to where Jacob now has the dream and he sees the angels descending and ascending and he rose up because now I even had to quote brother Brenham said let me be an angel descending for the purpose of of that service and I thought of all of the times now if that was if that was the first instance I hope you don't I don't lose you if that was the first instance when Jacob the first inclination of anything that had the concept of anointing was when he saw angels ascending and descending now Here we are all these centuries and thousands of years later from Jacob's time. Here we are sitting in the building and we can say we're part of the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. We're part of that holy lineage. And here we are. And we're gathered here around a message. We're gathered here around a word and we wouldn't be here had we if we had any question or doubt that we are here because there has been angels ascending and descending. The seven seals, the opening of the seven seals is actually a centerpiece to the message. &gt;&gt; I can say the opening of the word is the shift in the message. I think it's more than curious that brother Brandham's ministry, listen close now, he had all his years of ministry in the first pull and the second pull and then coming up and some don't think that a third pull has happened. Listen, I got news for you. He even said that the angel when the sword came in his hand says this is the third pull. And now when that happens and the seals are open, he he actually has literally the same amount of time. God allows him to remain on earth the same length of time as the ministry of Jesus Christ from 63 to 65 about three and a half years and then he's gone. the ministry of Jesus Christ on earth and now a a messenger revealing the son of man. You see the actual revealing of the son of man, he would not have been revealed because the son of man is the word. He would not have been revealed without a third pull or the opening of the word. And in the opening of the word, we have it because he said the seven angels, he said they came from the eternities in just a flash. Just a split was the word he used. Just a split. You talk about descending. They're not busy climbing up and down ladders. It came in just a split &gt;&gt; and the word opened up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the and and the message even said it himself that &gt;&gt; the seals Christ took the seals off himself. &gt;&gt; He unveiled himself. The bridegroom making himself known to the bride. Not a courtship anymore. Not even just a marriage anymore. But this is postmarriage. &gt;&gt; He's coming to the bride, &gt;&gt; showing who he is. &gt;&gt; She's a virgin bride. Pregnates her with the pure word of God. What is it? Pouring himself &gt;&gt; into her &gt;&gt; by the word which from the beginning was the logos that came out infused with the life and the power to bring forth the promise of the day. And the promise of the day is I'm going to take you to my place. I've prepared a place and I'm taking you to my place. And he pours in. The end messenger has to come and pour that word in. It is the anointing. I say it's like a final act. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The final act. The mighty anointing poured into the bride. She receives the seed. She changes her status. Hallelujah. From a widow, from a harlot, from whatever. She's changed her status to the wife of the lamb of God &gt;&gt; and has received the engrafted word, the anointing poured out into her, the word poured into her with the power to take her back to her home. &gt;&gt; And that's the whole cycle of redemption. When God be to pour out that little logos that came out from him, that little light, the sun, he knew then what he was going to do. &gt;&gt; And here we are. They say at the final stage. Here we are at the end of time. Oh my brother, my sister, it's the end time. We could sing it is the evening time. It's later than we think. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I mentioned this to you before a couple of services. I want to emphasize it now in the in the framework of the message this morning. That was why the Hebrews, they got the concept, they got the understanding, they got the belief that when the oil was taken and poured on to the head of the king, then that pouring became synonymous. The word anointed became synonymous with king. If you said king, he had to be an anointed one because that's how he entered into his king position. So to the Hebrews when he said he's anointed. So when Jesus came on the scene says the spirit of the Lord hath anointed me, those Jews knew what he was saying. &gt;&gt; He's setting himself up as a king. That's why Pilate when he was on the cross wrote over the cross and nailed it on the cross. Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the Jews. They said, "Take it down. Say that he said he was king." He said, "What I've written, I've written. It's going to remain there as a testimony. He was the king. He hadn't come into that office, but he was the king." Because he was the anointed. He was the Messiah. And the woman at the well says, "I know when the Messiah comes, he'll tell us everything. I that speak am." And I can say to you today, the Messiah &gt;&gt; came. The Lord himself came and delivered his word to us. William Brandham didn't deliver. He was the mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; It was the Messiah pouring out his word, pregnantating his bride, giving her the very word that's infused with the power to change. You say, "Well, we're waiting for the change." You have it in your body now. &gt;&gt; It's like a It's like a time time capsule. waiting for the moment, that time, that moment arrives, you receive the word. That's what I'm anxious. Make sure you receive the word. That's something you can do. Don't sit here and just be a lump on a log. Don't sit here and just be an attendant in the service. You must receive the engrafted word. And it's that word. It will burst to life. It will change the atoms in your body. You'll pass into another realm. Hallelujah. a faster realm. That's his promise. And Elijah came and said, "It shall be." Can you say, "So, you believe it? I believe in the rapture. I believe in the change of the body. It is bulk. It's been spoken. And so shall it be." I didn't say it. Not even William Brandham said it. The Messiah said it. That's where people get mixed up. They can't get that sorted out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was a man who fished. Brother Brandon was a man who said, "I made a lot of mistakes." But that Messiah made no mistakes. &gt;&gt; That word is absolutely true. You can count on that. You better count on that more than you count on your next paycheck. More than you count on your education or your next job. You count on what he said, &gt;&gt; cuz that's going to happen. You might lose your job tomorrow. You might lose your health tomorrow. But you won't lose this word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You won't lose this word. &gt;&gt; He transferred. That's why it was a transferral and they put that oil down as a prophet in the had to be a prophet because he was the agent and God spoke to him. Take the oil, pour it on the head of this young lad, David. They caught that transferal. Whoever sent the agent, whoever sent the agent, whoever sent Samuel, whoever spoke to him to come to this house, to come to this address, whoever spoke to him was going to supernaturally transfer something to that young lad David and make him king, make him whatever from shepherd to king. And when the when a prophet of God came in this day and began to pour out that word, that word has a power and you possess it now to take you from where you are into that eternal realm. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's not something you generate. It's not something you work up. It's not something that you're you can do. It's something that God has given. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe it. &gt;&gt; Accept it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jacob anointed a stone. He anointed a stone. But there's another stone. It's the stone that the re that the builders rejected. There's another stone that is the anointed one. It's called a precious stone. He's called a sure foundation stone. He's called a tried stone. He's a true stone. Hallelujah. Our anchor, our one that's anointed is not some stone that's in some wilderness. It is the Lord Jesus Christ. And he said in Peter that he's the head of the cornerstone. And the scripture says in Revelation 21:11, speaking about the bride and the new Jerusalem having the glory of God and her light, not his light now, but her light. How to get to be her light. It was transferred by the anointed word from him to her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She had to have his light. &gt;&gt; It was his light, but he gave it to her. Now at the end of the age is called her light. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Your light. And her light. What was it like? He said her light was like unto a stone. Most precious. Hallelujah. She become like him. &gt;&gt; You know when two people live together a long long time like I and my wife, they start looking like each other. She's got white hair. I got white hair. We can blame each other. If you hadn't got white hair, maybe mine still be black. You got white hair. I have to have white hair. We kind of look the same. Kind of get glasses look the same. Walk down the street and people say, "Now that's a nice brother and sister." No, actually we're husband and wife. Oh, you're going to think I'm sure enough crazy, but I've seen people have had animals long enough and and and they'll pick a dog that look just they'll pick a dog that looks just like them. We've just been with him. We've been with him &gt;&gt; in so in such a way we've walked with him. We've come to know him so much that you start to act like him. You begin to talk like him. You begin to think like him and you look like him. It's her light. &gt;&gt; You're the light of the world. You're the light of the world. Is that what the word says? You're the light. Where'd you get it from? It's transferred to you. Been transferred by an anointed word. You have the light. &gt;&gt; It's like a precious stone. &gt;&gt; In the infallibility. Oh, I love this. I've got to close pretty soon, but in the infallibility of God's word said, Jacob lays down. God shuts him off, gives him a coma of a vision. And he looked up and he saw a ladder fastened up in heaven to God's throne and reached all the way to the earth. and angels ascending and descending on the ladder up and down. Now it says all through the years we find out that this is a beautiful promise here that God had promised a way of escape, a ladder to climb, a sure foundation. God promised it, but it was hooked in glory to the throne of God. But where could he find a place on earth to hook it? &gt;&gt; Where could he find a place on earth to hook it into? He said he tried to hook it one time to a Jewish nation and found out that he couldn't do it. And he he couldn't hook it up on Abraham. Little fellow sitting there backslid little shy lying treating his wife the way he was. He couldn't hook it there. He said he promised the seed and the seed in Jacob. But he couldn't hook it into Jacob the surer. He couldn't hook it into the temple. Jesus said there'll be a time when there won't be one stone left upon another. So he couldn't hook the ladder into the temple. He tried the patriarch David and he and he took Ba Sheba for her wife and had Uriah her husband killed everything he tried to hook it into. It couldn't wouldn't anchor but oh hallelujah the prophet said there'll come a stone out of Zion. Are you enthused about this? There come a stone. The ladder has been hooked into the the stone. A tried stone. A proven stone. a precious stone. A stone most precious, my friends. That's that's our stone. &gt;&gt; He said he hooked it into Jesus Christ. And there it's anchored and there's no slipping. There's no sliding. There's no way of it getting away. &gt;&gt; He said it's hooked by God above and by the Son of God beneath. &gt;&gt; That beautiful language. It's hooked by God above and by his son beneath. He's hooked it and you can't fail. Look, he said there's great companies of angels up and down here ascending and descending, picking up the weary and the sick, healing their bodies and showing showing visions and mighty signs and wonders. And it can't fail. It can't slip. It can't slide. You're safe. God said so and that settles it forever. I love this language. It's hooked around the heart of God in heaven. It's hooked around the Son of God on earth. And we're brought into it through the Son of God. And we ascend to him. can't fail. There's no failing to it. It doesn't rest upon what I do. It rest upon what he did. &gt;&gt; And it's already finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I think probably I'm going to wind it down because there just you know that one thing about the message there's no it's hard to find a starting place. I spend so much time trying to find a starting place and I know once I get started I'm going to find a harder time finding a stopping place. That's about where I am right now. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'll just conclude with this. He says when anything's going to happen on the earth first God sends a messenger and that messenger is anointed by an angel. So now already the messenger is anointed. In other words, wouldn't you feel a little special if someone come to your door and said, "I've been sent by the president. I've been sent by the prime minister." This must be a special message. In fact is I have here I have here an invitation for you. This invitation is to some very very special event. There's only going to be a handful of people there. Going to be very few that's invited. And every statement that they make makes it even more special. Came to your house, came to your address. Said, "How are you chosen?" Well, it's actually a rare system that we identify people, but out of this entire city, you're the only one. You mean I'm only one in a million? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so you're the one that's been chosen. There's only going to be a few at the table. And when is it? Oh, that is uh next Tuesday. Oh, that's too bad. You know, I I'm going over visiting some friends on Tuesday. You know what's going to happen? You're going to say, "I'll be there. I'll call I'll call my friends and say, "Sorry, folks. I got another appointment. I got something more important." Well, right now is what that's why it means something very very significant to me. I don't just talk about brother Brandon was another man who came and ministered. A messenger came said he'd been anointed by an angel. Something poured into him and the angel which he told you many times. The angel he said you know who it is. &gt;&gt; It is the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Holy Spirit standing right there at the platform. And I was the age of some of you fellas here, 14, when I heard that for the first time. They said, "Brother Brandom will not do anything until the angel has come to the platform. I've seen it so many times, friends, and he'd just be talking. Nice to be with you. So happy for the invitation we received. Now we're here just to be a blessing to the people be going on and on. They might say, "You know what? I'm waiting for go on and on. This is a nice country, etc., etc. I've just seen it so many times." So now you watch. He just go, he just be in the middle of this conversation like that. He just go like this. He's here. And a whole holy hush just fell on the people. He's here. Need to see sometime. We didn't hardly know what world he was in. So, bring the bring the patient, bring the first person, bring the card, you know, the person and then then begin to reveal the secret of their heart. See, he didn't have that on his own. It was the angel that was anointing him. And now the angel, he was told by God, you go and wait. you go west for and he says this and he had a vision. Now this is just so natural. They were out hunting Havalina hogs. Brother Fred Sothman, brother Jean Norman is with them. They're just out there. They haven't made their preparation isn't to be in a suit and neither was their preparation especially to be in hunting clothes. That's just what was happening. But he knew that he was supposed to be out there. And then he said, "Brother Sothman hadn't gotten his hog." And they were so determined to get him that hog. So determined. And even with all of that, but he said, "But it didn't happen." And he said, "And the the Lord had told him, you must sanctify yourself." So instead of getting all and you know getting a hog and the hunt was successful and all this, God kept it from that because God had told him you must sanctify yourself for the visitation of those angels. Sanctifies you must set yourself aside. So maybe instead of say, "Well, I got something to do. I got to I got to do something." Maybe you don't got to do it. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can set yourself aside. Sanctify yourself. Sanctify yourself is not trying to get yourself in some holy holy position and rise way up in some, you know, false humility or false holiness. It's not that. It's just going about doing what you'd normally do. your sisters wash the dishes and prepare your lunch and do all this and then there comes a times that well I could uh uh maybe I should go out and uh then you just feel something little strange just feel another presence. No, I think I'll just set myself aside and I'll hear God. What would you have me to hear? I sense that you're near. I sense you're wanting to say something and you just watch him. You invite him because now you start putting into practice what a messenger said. You invite him and what's he said? Every time he's invited, he comes. You give him a real invitation and he will come. And that is part of sanctifying yourself. The Lord willing, I'll get to it. I know you've read about Josiah. I asked you to read about Josiah and I'll come to him. That young man touched my heart so deeply because he cleansed. He cleaned it. Even when he had them destroy their idols, he said, "Bring them in front of me. I actually want to see you do it. I want to see you." He He was rejoicing. young man in his in his teen years rejoicing that Israel was being cleansed. I say to this congregation, let's sanctify ourselves. &gt;&gt; Let's make ourselves ready for what God has. You say, "What has he got?" I don't know. Maybe it'll be the change. &gt;&gt; That's what we're living for. And as I said on Wednesday, you'll never regret making those steps, taking those steps. Now, you'll never regret it. And God will bless you. And I say, God bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And may these words sink down deep and anchor in your heart. May we be a holy sanctified people to God. A real testimony. Let's be a credit to this message in this end time. There's enough stripes been laid upon his back. There's enough evil that's been cast upon him. Let's let us just stand as real true believers and be a real credit to this gospel, this message. Do you feel the same? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand, shall we? The musicians may come. We'll bow our heads. And while our heads are bowed, I want to say to every person within the sound of my voice, don't let don't let any pride stand in the way. Don't let Satan work on the facts. Say, "Well, oh, you're you're regarded as a real strong believer." But if God is speaking to your heart, I ask you to surrender to him now. If God is touching something, don't be ashamed to ask someone to forgive you. Don't be ashamed to just uh answer positively with a yay Lord. Speak Lord and I will answer. Speak Lord and I will do it. This is what I prayed my precious precious believer friends. I prayed this morning that God would move in such a way and just so that we would lay aside everything of our own feelings, of our own thoughts, our own ambitions, and say, "Speak, Lord, and I will answer." I wonder if we could just perhaps sing, "Speak my Lord. speak my Lord and I'll be quick to answer thee and then you just keep your head bowed if you would. I'm sure that you know the chorus. Speak my Lord and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. Speak my Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I will answer. Lord, send me. &gt;&gt; Let's just sing it once again. Speak my Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Speak my Lord. Speak and I'll be quick to answer thee. &gt;&gt; Speak my speak my [Music] speak and I will answer me. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ, it is in your holy righteous name, name of our masterpiece, redeemer, the name that was spoken first by an angel sent from the very presence of God. You shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. Lord Jesus, here we stand today. An audience of people that have been redeemed by the blood of God, by the blood of the lamb, standing here washed. Oh God, you have standing here called. You have called and all we could do is answer. Here am I. Here am I. Take me. Cleanse me. Wash me. Send me. Anoint me, oh God. Here we are standing as a body of the redeemed. A multicultural group of people from many, many countries, many different languages, many different tongues, but we have one voice. It's the voice of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which you've delivered to us in this hour. Cause us to be a faithful people. cause us. Oh God, there may be those here and I know there are that are not filled with the Holy Spirit. Fill them, oh God. Move out all the debris. Move out all the hindrances and fill them with the Holy Ghost. Give them such a hunger. I pray that you'll put such a hunger, Lord. Put such a hunger, oh God. I'm praying for a hunger, oh God, in every life. I'm praying for a thirst, oh God. We hunger and thirst after you. I pray father you'll put it displace everything else Lord and let the hunger uh be the predominant thing in the people's lives father may they find themselves taking up the word may they find themselves hearing may they find themselves meditating and thinking upon the promises that you've made they find themselves speaking with their mouth Lord not my will thine be done I'm seeking to know your will just show me what you'd have me to do. What would you have me to do? Speak, Lord, and I'll do it. Let this be the very beat of the heart of the people. I pray in the name of Jesus. Let the words today, oh God, that have been so solemnly spoken, let it take root in the hearts of every individual, oh God. I thank you for their sincerity. Thank you that they are here. Thank you that they are your children. You've called them to be saints. And now, Father, I commit the word that has been spoken to the to the administration of the Holy Spirit, take it and place it in every heart, I pray, in good ground. And may it bring forth, may it bring forth in the name of Jesus Christ. Let it bring forth fruit for the kingdom of God. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Let it be glorified. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have something to think about? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want company. I've been thinking very very deeply. May we all move as one body. It says the says a shepherd must be first partaker of the fruit. That's only first partaker. Everyone else is to partake. So may you be also participant in that. I'm sure that you will be. I want to sing brother Ryan. Uh it's 474 I believe 474 in the song book. Uh and I felt it would be a theme for this message this morning.
