[0:18] Heat. Heat.
[0:20] [Music]
[0:55] Just one quick announcement. Uh it's a
[0:57] car Washington plates 144 RFL. Your
[1:00] lights are on.
[1:02] Amen. Can we surrender our lives to the
[1:05] Lord this morning? Man, I was reading
[1:07] this morning, brother Brandham said, I'd
[1:09] say this very day that Jesus has been
[1:12] turned away from tens of thousands of
[1:14] doors.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; And if the world stands before day
[1:18] breaks in the morning, he will be turned
[1:19] away from tens of thousands of other
[1:21] doors. The Lord Jesus, the only thing
[1:24] that he wants in for is to do something
[1:27] good for you.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; He wants to bless you, take away your
[1:32] evil, give you righteousness and
[1:34] goodness and mercy. You might say
[1:36] something like this to me, but just a
[1:38] minute, brother Brando. I already done
[1:39] that.
[1:41] I let Jesus in a long time ago. Well,
[1:43] there's no way for me to express to you
[1:45] how grateful I am for you letting my
[1:48] savior come into your heart.
[1:51] But is that all you did? Just let him
[1:53] come in. Now, what if you let me come in
[1:56] and said, "Now, brother Brandham, I'll
[1:57] let you in. I'll take your gifts. That's
[1:59] fine. Thank you, but I don't want you to
[2:02] go any farther than this door." Now
[2:04] that's the attitude of many Christians.
[2:06] You see inside the heart coming in is
[2:08] one thing. And after that you get into
[2:10] that first door in the human heart.
[2:11] There's other little compartments. Got
[2:14] little doors in there. Also,
[2:16] many people will let Jesus in for the
[2:18] sake of not being lost, but they won't
[2:20] let him in to be their Lord. When Jesus
[2:23] comes in, he wants to take control. The
[2:26] world's full of people that wants to let
[2:28] Jesus in, but then they don't want to
[2:30] let him in on his own basis.
[2:33] If they'll take his gift, sure, eternal
[2:35] life. You want to heal me, that's all
[2:37] right, Lord. I appreciate that if you
[2:38] heal me, but don't go messing around
[2:40] with me. Said, that's the way we got to
[2:43] let Jesus in so he can just take
[2:45] control. He wants to be at home with
[2:48] you.
[2:49] He wants to be welcome. He wants all you
[2:52] are. He wants to be your Lord.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; You prepared to hear his word this
[2:59] morning?
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And more importantly, are you
[3:02] prepared to do what he says to you this
[3:04] morning? Amen. We want to prepare our
[3:06] hearts now. That's the reason we sing
[3:08] these songs,
[3:10] to hear the word of God. Amen. And we
[3:13] want the Lord to have his perfect way in
[3:14] our midst this morning. Let's stand as
[3:16] we sing. Uh may we turn to number 6:18,
[3:21] My Wonderful Lord.
[3:24] Trust you can sing these words with all
[3:27] your heart. Amen. is a real testimony.
[3:32] I have found a deep peace that I never
[3:38] had known
[3:40] and a joy this world could not afford.
[3:45] [Music]
[3:47] Since I yield in control
[3:51] of my body and soul

[19:03] [Music]
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Father, we bow in your presence this
[19:12] morning.
[19:14] Lord, it's so wonderful to be able to
[19:15] come into your house this morning, Lord,
[19:17] and let off the pressure, raise our
[19:20] hands to you this morning and worship
[19:22] you, oh God.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; We're so thankful for your grace and
[19:26] your mercy that you've shown in our
[19:28] lives. Amen.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Father, I was sitting in service this
[19:32] morning, Lord, thinking of the first
[19:33] time I came into your presence, Lord.
[19:36] How wonderful it was, Lord. And it's
[19:38] just continued to grow sweeter and
[19:40] sweeter since that glorious day, Lord.
[19:44] And Father, we come into your presence
[19:46] this morning with confidence, Lord,
[19:49] knowing that you're able to meet every
[19:51] need in our presence this morning.
[19:53] Father, you're the God that heals all of
[19:55] our diseases, takes away all of our
[19:57] infirmities, and binds up every broken
[20:00] heart. Oh God, we have that confidence
[20:03] before you this morning, Lord Jesus. We
[20:06] ask, Lord, that you'd move up and down
[20:09] every aisle. Father, may you stop at
[20:11] every seat and speak to every heart.
[20:13] Lord, each one of us as individuals has
[20:16] a need in our heart this morning for
[20:18] you, Lord. And Father, we pray Lord that
[20:22] as your word would come forth this
[20:24] morning, oh God, that it would come in
[20:26] such power, Lord, that it would just
[20:28] drive back the enemy, Lord. Father, your
[20:31] servant taught us that as the word comes
[20:33] forth, demons scatter. And Father, we
[20:36] just pray that the servant of the Lord
[20:38] this morning would just have such
[20:40] boldness and rest in your word this
[20:42] morning to be able to deliver that which
[20:45] you've put on his heart this morning,
[20:46] Father.
[20:48] And now, Father, we just want to take a
[20:50] little time this morning to worship you,
[20:53] Lord. Lord, to tell you how much we love
[20:56] you and how wonderful you've made life
[20:58] for us this morning, oh God. We love you
[21:01] this morning. We worship you. We honor
[21:04] you, oh God. We thank you for your grace
[21:08] this morning. Hallelujah, Jesus.

[21:14] We pray, Lord Jesus. May you bless each
[21:17] one this morning, Father. Hallelujah.

[30:26] hit us and lady come out of the car
[30:29] after we come to a stop, she said,
[30:31] "That's the best driving I've ever seen
[30:32] in my life." I said, "Wasn't me
[30:34] driving."
[30:36] So I had the pilot driving. Amen. An
[30:39] unseen hand can guide you wherever you
[30:41] are. Let's just sing this as brother
[30:43] Ivan, Sister Asenth comes.
[30:46] There is an unseen
[30:51] hand to me
[30:55] that leads in ways
[31:00] I cannot see.
[31:04] While I'm going through
[31:09] this world of hope,
[31:13] this hand still leads
[31:17] me as I go.
[31:21] Well, I'm trusting to
[31:26] the unseen hand.
[31:35] this we land
[31:40] some sweetening.
[31:43] [Applause]
[31:45] [Music]
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:01] I don't know about you, but I feel
[32:03] enthused and happy and excited for
[32:06] brother Ivan, sister Azeneth,
[32:09] and their little one been added to their
[32:13] home. And I'm sure that this child is
[32:17] going to bring a lot of joy to them.
[32:20] Uh, Sister Asanth has been a privilege
[32:23] to have her mother and father here and
[32:28] uh, they've been here for I think close
[32:30] to a month.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Their grandparents
[32:35] and your parents as well. Brother Ivan's
[32:38] parents. Wonderful. Well, uh, this is
[32:42] just glorious. And it it's uh because
[32:46] having brother Ivan and Sister Asenth
[32:48] here, it only reinforces
[32:51] the connection of this body of believers
[32:54] here with China.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we we so love what's happening
[33:00] in China and the people in China. And
[33:02] brother Ivan has been he's been one of
[33:06] those that Jesus called. Pray ye
[33:08] therefore the Lord of the harvest that
[33:11] he will send laborers
[33:14] &gt;&gt; into and brother Ivan has been a laborer
[33:17] &gt;&gt; into the harvest field. I was uh
[33:21] meditating about this dedication and
[33:24] this is a a little girl of course which
[33:29] you all can see that the Lord has given
[33:32] and they have called her Karita which is
[33:36] from charity joy beloved
[33:41] and ye
[33:42] which is joy.
[33:45] So it's it's uh and I pronounced that
[33:47] right I'm sure
[33:51] my my lesson in another language karita
[33:55] y
[33:58] uh the Bible says brother Ivan
[34:02] when they brought the children to Jesus
[34:04] and we refer to it so many many times
[34:07] but the the word of God is so rich we
[34:09] see something different in it all the
[34:11] time and the Bible says and and then
[34:14] when Jesus Jesus. They brought the
[34:15] children to Jesus and he took them up in
[34:19] his arms and put his hands on them and
[34:22] and blessed them. And I have thought so
[34:26] much of this word of being blessed or
[34:29] blessed in the Old Testament and being
[34:31] blessed in the New Testament.
[34:34] It's it's kind of a strange word with
[34:38] reference to a dedication because the
[34:41] word blessed is actually eulogy.
[34:44] And whenever we speak of eulogy, it's
[34:47] almost always at a funeral service.
[34:51] And at the eulogy, because eulogy is to
[34:53] praise
[34:55] and to but also to invoke blessings, but
[34:58] you can't do that at a funeral service.
[35:00] Now, these comments may sound strange,
[35:02] but they're not.
[35:05] A eulogy is speaking of the things of a
[35:09] person's life.
[35:12] And in a funeral service, they always
[35:14] are speaking of the things past.
[35:17] But today, I'm going to bless this child
[35:19] for its future.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Not its past. Not at what it has done
[35:24] because it hasn't got a track record
[35:26] yet.
[35:28] It hasn't had an opportunity to come to
[35:30] the knowledge of Jesus Christ yet.
[35:32] Hasn't come to the age of accountability
[35:34] yet. Hasn't had the hasn't had the
[35:37] privilege of witnessing for Christ yet.
[35:40] But we're going to pray now a blessing
[35:42] on this child that this child will have
[35:45] just such a life.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; And that is a eulogy. And Jesus blessed
[35:50] the children. And I know that when he
[35:52] laid his hands on them and blessed them,
[35:54] it wasn't for their past. It was for
[35:56] what they were going to be in the
[35:58] future. And I would like to have seen
[36:00] and probably will never have the
[36:03] opportunity until we cross over to the
[36:05] other side. And I'm sure that we will
[36:07] meet some of those that he laid hands on
[36:09] and blessed. We will see the life that
[36:12] they that they lived and the and the
[36:15] consequence and result of that blessing.
[36:17] And I believe that we have been
[36:19] instructed and empowered. I'm a poor
[36:22] representative for Christ. But in
[36:24] hisstead, I will take this child Karita
[36:27] ye and bless her in the name of the Lord
[36:30] Jesus Christ. And I know that God who
[36:32] wrote these words in the scripture is
[36:35] here present by his holy spirit to
[36:38] confirm that that is exactly what's
[36:40] going to happen. And you as believers,
[36:42] brother Ivan and sister Aanth, you have
[36:46] given yourselves, you've separated
[36:48] yourselves to the Lord Jesus Christ, to
[36:50] this message that's been revealed to
[36:52] you. God is making your lives fruitful.
[36:54] And I pray now that this child that God
[36:57] has given you is as your heritage and
[37:00] that that will be a testimony to others
[37:03] also. And so this is what we are going
[37:06] to uh pray for this child for Karita Y
[37:11] and that her life will indeed be a life
[37:15] of joy to the family and an expression
[37:18] of love, charity from our Lord Jesus
[37:22] Christ to you, brother Ivan and Sister
[37:25] Asenth.
[37:27] There's only one God that can hear us.
[37:31] There's only one God that can speak and
[37:35] there's only one God that can fulfill
[37:38] our prayer. Amen.
[37:41] Now we take Karita ye the name of the
[37:44] Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:47] Oh how lovely this is Lord. How
[37:49] wonderful this is to hold this child in
[37:52] my arms father and in the name of Jesus
[37:55] Christ to bless her.
[37:58] I bless her with the blessings of the
[38:00] almighty God through Jesus Christ.
[38:03] I pray father now that you will hear my
[38:07] voice. You will give her father good
[38:10] health. Give her I pray oh God the
[38:14] testimony that when her ears hear the
[38:17] name of Jesus that she will respond to
[38:20] it. Father, I pray, oh God, that you
[38:23] will just uh give her, Father, the a
[38:27] spirit that will be so joyful to the
[38:30] home. I ask, oh God, that you will cause
[38:35] a special wisdom to be given to our
[38:39] sister Asenth and brother Ivan and that
[38:42] they will train her and instruct her in
[38:44] the things of God and that she may grow,
[38:48] dear Lord, to be a child to be a witness
[38:51] to be to be a real example to others.
[38:54] Father, now as Jesus blessed the
[38:57] children, I bless her with the blessings
[39:00] of the Almighty God and may the Holy
[39:02] Spirit abide upon her in Jesus Christ's
[39:05] name. We dedicate her to you now. Amen.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:16] Amen.
[39:21] God bless you, brother Ivans. Amen.
[39:24] God bless you sister. God bless you.
[39:29] It's always a privilege.
[39:33] These are the heritage of the Lord.
[39:38] Amen.
[39:40] Well, welcome to everyone.
[39:43] all of those that are on the internet
[39:46] and connected by telephone or however
[39:50] God has allowed you to be fellowshipping
[39:53] with us today. We are uh we are just our
[39:58] hearts are thrilled at what God is
[40:00] doing. Uh I will be sharing some things
[40:04] even after the message of what God is
[40:07] doing, things that we're not able to
[40:10] show on the streaming. So we have to
[40:12] wait until that is over. Show you some
[40:15] recent things in the great nation of
[40:18] China. How wonderful. We have some
[40:21] announcements.
[40:23] I have been uh twice now to the sites of
[40:28] the seven church ages which are in Asia
[40:31] Minor which today to the surprise of a
[40:35] lot of people are all in Turkey.
[40:38] And uh we've had the same uh the same
[40:41] guide.
[40:42] God arranged the first time and that was
[40:44] when you the church sent I and my wife
[40:47] to Israel and then from Israel we came
[40:51] back through Turkey to the seven church
[40:53] ages, seven church age sites. Uh God
[40:57] arranged that the guide which we had
[41:00] which was just it was just marvelous.
[41:02] here this guide took just I and my wife
[41:05] the two of us and here's other big
[41:07] groups of people you know and milling
[41:09] around and I thought it was just so
[41:10] wonderful and here we are walking just
[41:12] the three of us and having you know
[41:16] firsthand
[41:18] instruction then I learned that this
[41:21] guide his name is Erdin
[41:24] he actually was a an instructor of
[41:27] guides for the government to instruct
[41:29] other guides and to his his knowledge
[41:33] just seems infinite and he's so
[41:37] uh he's just so casual and so
[41:40] comfortable and so easy and and almost
[41:43] felt like a brother right away. Uh and
[41:46] so then I went we went the second time
[41:49] last year with a family and I contacted
[41:52] him. He now has become vice president of
[41:54] a of a company uh tour company and I
[41:59] prevailed upon him to take us just as a
[42:03] family and he consented to do so and he
[42:07] really goes the extra mile and he he
[42:09] flew from his city as into Istanbul and
[42:12] spent almost a week with us there and so
[42:15] so so respectful of of our uh of our
[42:19] belief and faith and and uh So I spoke
[42:23] to him about coming here
[42:25] perhaps to the church and uh uh we could
[42:29] take uh space in the fellowship room and
[42:32] there might be I said there may be some
[42:34] people from the church that would like
[42:36] to at some time in the future they may
[42:38] not at at the same time of course but
[42:40] they it'll be good if you could just
[42:42] tell them about the seven church ages
[42:44] and the seven churches rather and and
[42:46] make a presentation and this is exactly
[42:49] what he's going to do and I've arranged
[42:51] he's going to come here and he'll be
[42:53] here the same weekend that uh brother
[42:55] Joseph Green from North Carolina is
[42:59] going to be here. So he is actually
[43:01] arriving on the 4th of February and uh
[43:04] we haven't uh I'm giving these dates out
[43:07] now. So please bear them in mind. He has
[43:11] enough material for two presentations.
[43:14] And u uh this is only to wet the
[43:17] appetite for those of you that at some
[43:20] time, it may not even be this year. It
[43:22] might be another another year if the
[43:24] Lord carries, but uh it will give you a
[43:28] good insight of what you could expect if
[43:30] you were to make a tour. Some of you
[43:33] young people, there may be a a young
[43:35] people's group that may want to go or
[43:36] there just may be a mixed group that may
[43:39] want to go. Uh there could be 25 in a
[43:42] group. They can take 50. They could even
[43:45] take more. But u he will be here uh
[43:50] arriving on the 4th. The first the first
[43:53] day that you want to leave open is the
[43:55] 5th
[43:57] uh which is Thursday the 5th. Leave it
[44:00] open. We haven't got the set time yet.
[44:02] And then we would just be you know
[44:04] gathering in the fellowship room and
[44:06] hope we have enough room for everyone.
[44:09] Uh, so leave the 5th open. The 6th,
[44:12] Friday the 6th is our first meeting with
[44:14] brother Joseph Green. And I wanted him
[44:17] to be here at the same time because I
[44:19] think he, Brother and Sister Green will
[44:22] be here. And Mike Orders, uh, their song
[44:25] leader for about 35 years. Uh, Brother
[44:28] Michael orders and his wife are also
[44:31] going to be here. Incidentally, just as
[44:33] a side issue or as a side point of
[44:36] interest, brother Michael Orders, if you
[44:39] look orders, sister orders in the if you
[44:42] did a search in the message, you'll find
[44:44] out that brother Brandham called out
[44:47] Michael's aunt and spoke some incredible
[44:50] things to her about uh about her child.
[44:54] And so um uh they are going to be here
[44:58] on the 6th, Friday the 6th. The 7th,
[45:01] which is Saturday, is the second is the
[45:04] next date you want to hold open the 7th
[45:07] because that would be the only second
[45:09] day. And then Sunday is services and
[45:11] Monday uh the uh 7th, 8th, 9th. So it'll
[45:15] be Monday the 9th. So those are the 5th
[45:18] and the 7th and the 9th are the three
[45:20] days you want to hold open because uh
[45:23] that up till now that appears to be the
[45:25] only time that Erdin will be available
[45:29] uh to have a presentation
[45:31] and uh and we might use up two of those.
[45:33] I have emailed him back this morning and
[45:35] told him that there was a pretty tight
[45:37] schedule and he should try to free up
[45:39] another couple of days. So I don't know
[45:42] if that's going to be possible or not,
[45:43] but it may well be possible. So, he's a
[45:46] he's a very outstanding person and uh
[45:50] he's uh uh someone I think that you
[45:53] would enjoy. And not only that, I'm
[45:56] anxious that he will be able to be here
[45:57] and be in the services because we've
[46:00] spoken to him very much about uh about
[46:03] the message and and the Lord Jesus
[46:05] Christ.
[46:07] Uh also like to make an announcement
[46:09] about the camp. It's not really an
[46:11] announcement
[46:13] and yet I I think I hope I'm not
[46:15] stepping out of line here. Uh brother
[46:17] Chris, but uh brother uh brother John
[46:21] and sister Marie Lei are going to be
[46:24] taking over the as um as management of
[46:29] uh Bible way Mount Baker Bible Way camp.
[46:34] And this is what we have uh this has
[46:37] been the vision, you know, kind of from
[46:40] day one that that the camp would just
[46:43] become a a retreat for believers. That
[46:46] is still my vision,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; a retreat for believers, a place that
[46:50] would be used all year round for the
[46:52] families of believers. Now, I took
[46:54] Brother Benny Perry, his wife, and the
[46:57] whole group out there. And when they saw
[47:01] when they saw the camp and the facility
[47:02] and saw the vision, Brother Benny said,
[47:05] "I'll be back.
[47:08] When is your camp?" I said, "Well, our
[47:10] family camp's in August." He says, "I'll
[47:12] be here for that." I said, "This can be
[47:14] used anytime." I said, "You folks can
[47:16] come if you wish." And I said, "The the
[47:20] you know, the buildings, we call them
[47:21] cabins. They're not cabins. or
[47:23] residences. I said, "They're all here.
[47:26] They're available." And it's just
[47:29] remarkable how, you know, you see uh you
[47:32] have a vision and then God just brings
[47:34] the people uh capable people, burdened
[47:39] people to to do the work and to
[47:42] implement, you know, his will.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; It's not my plan, not my program, not a
[47:48] church program. This is God's doing. And
[47:51] uh I can tell you it's just remarkable.
[47:54] And so under the leadership and
[47:56] direction of brother Chris Peterson who
[47:59] is a church trustee and he's been uh the
[48:01] one that has been taking such a senior
[48:04] role and now he has brother John and
[48:06] sister Marie Lei and they're beginning
[48:10] on officially on February 1. But I'd
[48:13] like to I just mentioned this a day or
[48:15] two ago and I think I think it's worth
[48:17] mentioning twice
[48:20] &gt;&gt; here. Brother John lays down Louisiana
[48:22] having a holiday
[48:24] and he just feels a witness as a spirit.
[48:26] Go back. Go back home and give a month
[48:31] of your time
[48:33] to the camp. His business and his whole
[48:36] his whole, you know, all his skills are
[48:39] in uh renovating and fixing things up.
[48:43] And if anything breaks, fix it. And he
[48:46] if it needs painting, paint it. And if
[48:47] it needs a roof, put a roof on. And oh,
[48:50] hey, we love those kind of people.
[48:55] And so he he he comes to me and he says,
[48:57] "The Lord laid it on my heart." And he's
[49:00] even identified the building. It's the
[49:01] biggest building there. He said," he
[49:04] says, "I want to gut that place."
[49:08] Praise the Lord.
[49:10] Go to it, John. It needs it. and uh and
[49:15] and then he gets there and then others
[49:17] get inspired and they all get in there
[49:19] and start doing it. I I had to go out
[49:21] and see it last week and it was uh it
[49:24] was just
[49:26] it's a new building. It's just a new
[49:28] building and it is so wonderful. I
[49:30] thought, you know, who we doing this
[49:31] for? He's not doing it for himself. He's
[49:34] not doing it for me. He's doing it for
[49:37] people who otherwise wouldn't even be
[49:38] able to afford perhaps to go there. He's
[49:41] doing it for them. doing it for our
[49:43] young people, doing it for your kids,
[49:47] maybe doing it for you. You might want
[49:49] to go there, maybe doing it for other
[49:51] believers, maybe doing it for some
[49:54] weary, weary preacher of the gospel to
[49:59] come there and to be able to
[50:03] sit and look at the trees and the woods
[50:06] and the forest
[50:09] and rest his soul.
[50:13] Let's go aside a little while for
[50:16] believers. There's not a whole lot of
[50:18] places that you can actually go like
[50:20] that. And so this has been the this has
[50:23] been the purpose. Brother Jack Aguary
[50:25] has been doing a wonderful job. Sister
[50:28] Karen Hendrickson
[50:30] in the in the kitchen and for the food
[50:33] and and a host of volunteers.
[50:37] And I just want to say that uh God bless
[50:40] them. Amen. Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Brother John Lei and the group. I just
[50:47] when I went there the other day,
[50:50] uh he said, you know, he said uh someone
[50:53] donated some doors. I heard about a
[50:55] place. I believe brother Madden
[50:59] uh let him know that there was a place
[51:00] that was closing down and they
[51:03] manufactured doors.
[51:05] And uh so he went there and this company
[51:09] this company gave
[51:12] gave us $20,000
[51:16] worth of brand new doors. $30 wooden
[51:20] doors. Beautiful. I'm talking about
[51:22] solid wood doors, oak and all kinds of
[51:27] wooden doors. And I couldn't believe my
[51:30] I couldn't believe my ears. And he said,
[51:32] "They gave us all kinds of woodworking
[51:34] equipment." And he started naming off
[51:37] the woodworking with radial saws and
[51:39] joiners and planers and this and that
[51:42] for $400.
[51:45] And he says, "And then we have two 9 and
[51:49] 1/2t wide by 9 1/2t high vans that are
[51:55] arriving."
[51:57] And uh
[51:59] my wife and I drove out on our way home
[52:01] and I I said he said, "These vans are
[52:04] large enough to drive a forklift in."
[52:06] And he says, "We've been given so much
[52:08] stuff
[52:10] and and a downturn in the economy and
[52:12] the building places have uh surplus
[52:17] and they're they're willing to give."
[52:20] And I I just couldn't tell you. They got
[52:23] enough stone to go around this stone to
[52:26] go around fireplaces to do about nine
[52:28] fireplaces and and flooring for I don't
[52:31] know how many buildings at at flooring
[52:35] that's only less than 10%
[52:38] of what it was costing. And this is
[52:40] durable stuff. It's like God opened up
[52:43] the storehouse and says, "Here it is."
[52:45] &gt;&gt; And and we had to have a place to put
[52:47] it. And he says, "Now we got these two
[52:49] vans coming and they're like 48 or 50
[52:52] foot long vans." And I my head is
[52:56] spinning. But anyway, my wife and I, we
[52:58] drive out of the yard and and and and we
[53:00] haven't gone 5 minutes and here comes a
[53:03] great big highway truck with this great
[53:06] big beautiful Allied furniture moving
[53:10] van on the trailer. And it looks like it
[53:14] just came out of the factory. It's all
[53:16] painted. this beautiful Allied van. And
[53:18] my wife says, "Well, there's one of the
[53:20] vans." I says, "No way. You know, this
[53:22] is a this allied furniture van. These
[53:25] things got hardwood floors in them."
[53:28] Yep, that was one of the vans. And the
[53:30] second one just like it. And they're
[53:32] already sitting there and uh and filled
[53:35] being filled with stuff. Well, I think
[53:38] that this congregation ought to if
[53:40] you're not thankful, don't come to the
[53:42] camp.
[53:54] That's the way I feel about it. I feel
[53:55] that God has done this. We didn't go
[53:57] looking for it.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; It was just dropped down into our lap.
[54:01] And so I'm I'm happy about that.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; I've taken a few minutes and now we're
[54:06] going to go to the word. And uh are you
[54:10] ready for the word?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right, if we just stand
[54:16] and we'll just sing welcome, welcome,
[54:18] welcome, Holy Spirit. We welcome you.
[54:21] Let's make him welcome, shall we?
[54:28] I'll come well.
[54:33] [Music]
[54:38] Holy
[54:39] [Music]
[54:41] Ghost,
[54:43] we welcome
[54:46] you.
[54:49] [Music]
[54:54] This very
[54:58] power.
[54:59] [Music]
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Just before we turn to the word, let us
[55:15] pray once again.
[55:17] Dear Father,
[55:20] we just feel such a need of you. And yet
[55:24] there's such a desire, such a hunger. We
[55:27] can say today, Lord, and I know that I
[55:29] speak for many, if not all that are
[55:32] here, we hunger after you. We're
[55:35] thirsting after the waters of life.
[55:38] We're desiring that you will be pleased,
[55:41] Lord. That you will be pleased. We're
[55:44] not we're not attempting to please any
[55:46] man or any person, but we want you to be
[55:49] pleased. We pray that your sanction will
[55:52] be upon this entire day.
[55:55] Especially take your word. May it be
[55:58] your hands that take it and break it to
[56:01] the people. May it be your lips, oh God,
[56:05] that will speak and utter words that
[56:08] describe the very heart and bosom of
[56:10] Almighty God. and let the Holy Spirit
[56:14] deliver it to every man and woman. I
[56:16] pray give us revelation. Give us
[56:19] insight. I pray Lord the name of Jesus
[56:22] Christ. We're so thankful today that we
[56:24] know you as the author of the book.
[56:27] Although we may not understand every
[56:29] word, every scripture, but we understand
[56:32] what is the motive and the heart of the
[56:34] author. And while we're praying, Lord,
[56:36] I'm remembering once again our brother
[56:39] Edwin Dods, Sister Sally, his wife, and
[56:42] his their family. I'm praying for
[56:45] supernatural strength to come to them.
[56:48] I'm praying, oh God, that you will bring
[56:51] a deliverance to our brother Edwin, that
[56:54] you will cauterize the bleeding, Lord,
[56:56] and may it cease, Father, and may the
[57:00] may he be raised up again to your glory.
[57:04] This is our prayer. Let us touch your
[57:07] heart now, Father, with a simple faith.
[57:11] The faith of a little child in Jesus
[57:14] Christ's name. This would not be for
[57:16] anyone's glory, but for your glory. I
[57:19] pray that you will just hover nearby and
[57:21] let the supernatural atmosphere
[57:24] which is pregnantated with the
[57:26] attributes of Almighty God, may it be
[57:28] his portion now in Jesus Christ's name.
[57:31] Now anoint us to hear. Anoint me to
[57:34] speak for your glory. Amen.
[57:37] I want to read from the book of Amos.
[57:40] The Old Testament considered one of the
[57:42] minor prophets.
[57:44] Prophet said he was called a minor
[57:47] prophet but he was a rugged
[57:50] a rugged prophet of God. And you heard
[57:54] uh on Sunday,
[57:57] I'm sorry, on Wednesday, you heard uh
[57:59] the way of a true prophet. That's I did
[58:02] I was not feeling real well. And so I
[58:05] called and brother John graciously took
[58:08] the service uh and I wanted this tape
[58:11] played and I've had so many already
[58:15] comments from the congregation of what a
[58:17] blessing it was.
[58:19] Uh, so I'm reading the same scripture
[58:21] text out of the third chapter of Amos.
[58:27] Hear this word that the Lord hath spoken
[58:30] against you, oh children of Israel,
[58:32] against the whole family which I brought
[58:34] up from the land of Egypt, saying, You
[58:38] only have I known of all the families of
[58:40] the earth. Therefore, I will punish you
[58:43] for all your iniquities. Can two walk
[58:46] together except they be agreed? Will a
[58:49] lion roar in the forest when he hath no
[58:52] prey? Will a young lion cry out of his
[58:55] den if he hath taken nothing? Can a bird
[58:59] fall in a snare upon the earth where no
[59:02] jin is for him? Shall one take up a
[59:06] snare from the earth and have taken
[59:08] nothing at all? Shall a trumpet be blown
[59:12] in the city, and the people not be
[59:14] afraid? Shall there be evil in a city,
[59:17] and the Lord hath not done it? Surely
[59:20] the Lord God will do nothing, but he
[59:23] revealth his secret unto his servants,
[59:26] the prophets. The lion hath roared, who
[59:30] will not fear. The Lord God hath spoken,
[59:34] who can but prophesy. Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; If you'll just turn to the seventh
[59:38] chapter, I have one verse I would like
[59:42] to read from the seventh chapter. It's
[59:44] verse 8.
[59:52] And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what
[59:56] seeest thou? And I said, a plum line.
[1:00:01] Then said the Lord, "Behold, I will set
[1:00:04] a plum line in the midst of my people
[1:00:07] Israel. I will not again pass by them
[1:00:11] anymore." May God bless his word. You
[1:00:15] have your seats.
[1:00:21] I'm sure most all of you are familiar
[1:00:24] with what a plum line is, but in case
[1:00:25] you aren't, a plum line is simply a line
[1:00:28] with a heavy weight on the end. They may
[1:00:32] use it and drop it into water to measure
[1:00:34] the depth of water, but it's most
[1:00:36] commonly
[1:00:37] uh used
[1:00:39] to to uh to line a wall or to line
[1:00:44] something up vertically. If you put a
[1:00:47] weight on the bottom of a line and then
[1:00:49] the line will remain straight and uh and
[1:00:54] and and then they they build to a plum
[1:00:57] line. And so God uh showed Amos a plum
[1:01:02] line. Said, "What do you see?" In fact
[1:01:05] is in verse 7 said, "Thus he showed me
[1:01:08] and behold the Lord stood upon a wall
[1:01:11] made by a plum line." I should have read
[1:01:14] that verse because it kind of explains
[1:01:16] the next one. The Lord uh stood upon a
[1:01:20] wall made by a plum line with a plum
[1:01:23] line in his hand. And the Lord said to
[1:01:25] Amos, "What do you see?" And he said, "I
[1:01:26] see a plum line."
[1:01:29] And then God was saying, "I've set a
[1:01:30] plum line in Israel." uh to be uh to to
[1:01:35] just set your mind in the correct
[1:01:36] direction. Amos himself really was the
[1:01:40] the word of the Lord in Amos was the
[1:01:42] plum line.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; That was the plum line that God was
[1:01:46] setting.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Th this is the standard. This is what we
[1:01:50] build to.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And in this generation, the word of God
[1:01:55] revealed in the bride of Jesus Christ is
[1:01:58] the plum line for this age. Amen.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; And this is what God God is going to
[1:02:05] hold the world accountable to. Said,
[1:02:07] "You saw it. You viewed it. You saw what
[1:02:11] the line was. You saw what the standard
[1:02:13] was." And so that's God's plum line.
[1:02:18] the conditions that were existing at the
[1:02:22] time when God was showing Amos this uh
[1:02:27] Israel had actually arrived to its
[1:02:30] zenith. It had come to its place of
[1:02:33] glory. Brother Brandham calls it
[1:02:36] glamour. It was a prosperous nation. It
[1:02:40] had prospered under an idolatrous king
[1:02:43] whose name was Gerobam II.
[1:02:46] And uh Israel had prospered very much
[1:02:49] under him. Uh and the people they had a
[1:02:54] completely different standard of living
[1:02:56] than they had had in the past. Uh they
[1:02:59] they were doing well. They also were at
[1:03:02] peace with their neighboring nations.
[1:03:05] And things were going good. We're having
[1:03:08] the good life.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; We haven't got a lot of things to be
[1:03:11] afraid of. and uh and uh the future
[1:03:14] looks you know bright. Maybe have our
[1:03:17] ups and downs and we still have our
[1:03:18] troubles but things are okay, things are
[1:03:21] good and people could almost relax and
[1:03:25] they had become uh lovers of pleasure.
[1:03:28] Uh and this was the generation that they
[1:03:30] were in. And so uh God is saying to uh
[1:03:36] to Amos, what sayest thou? And that's my
[1:03:40] title to you today.
[1:03:43] What seeest thou? What do you see? Uh
[1:03:49] it's amazing how
[1:03:51] conditions that are around us, things
[1:03:54] that we see around us actually condition
[1:03:58] our vision.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; And vision I mean this is such an
[1:04:03] enormous subject I couldn't even begin
[1:04:06] to approach it hardly today. But when
[1:04:09] you when you see a certain thing, then
[1:04:12] you have a certain perception.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; You gain a certain understanding. That's
[1:04:17] why they say knowledge is light because
[1:04:20] when you receive knowledge, you know,
[1:04:23] you you you have understanding
[1:04:26] uh discernment uh you have direction.
[1:04:29] Decisions are made based on what we see.
[1:04:32] Now, you know, that is why the first
[1:04:34] thing that God said in the beginning,
[1:04:36] let there be light. Because God knew the
[1:04:39] creation that he was going to make. He
[1:04:41] was going to make all kinds of uh
[1:04:44] animals and fishes and fowls of the air
[1:04:47] and all kinds of creatures and then make
[1:04:49] man in his image. When he made man in
[1:04:52] his image, he had eyes
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and he had eyes. He needed to see and he
[1:04:57] had to have light in order to be able to
[1:04:59] see. And so there are a lot of things
[1:05:01] today that are around us that we could
[1:05:04] say are light. knowledge is light and
[1:05:06] and uh we have uh opportunities that
[1:05:09] come before us all kinds of things uh
[1:05:12] you know we that's why we go to school
[1:05:14] we go to education we have training all
[1:05:16] because we learn we learn and and that
[1:05:19] that is light to us and often that that
[1:05:22] causes us to make our make our
[1:05:26] decisions. So now there is different
[1:05:28] kinds of light
[1:05:31] and there's different kinds of seeing.
[1:05:34] And the big question today is not only
[1:05:38] what do we see but how do you see it?
[1:05:44] Uh there was a a book that was written
[1:05:46] by a a very well-known I I believe it is
[1:05:50] if I'm if I'm remembering remembering
[1:05:52] correctly uh by a very well-known
[1:05:55] speaker. He speaks to uh uh corporate uh
[1:06:00] uh corporate executives etc etc but he
[1:06:03] was talking about you know uh knowledge
[1:06:06] and so on so forth and he he talked
[1:06:08] about a and and word that maybe these
[1:06:10] are things you've heard but I just want
[1:06:12] to use it this morning a paradigm shift
[1:06:15] how that we have a paradigm shift and he
[1:06:18] told a story of a a man that was riding
[1:06:21] on a on a subway
[1:06:24] or uh or a train in New York or some big
[1:06:27] city and he's riding on this train and a
[1:06:30] man comes on the train with some small
[1:06:33] children and he sits down and this this
[1:06:37] fellow is trying to read a newspaper and
[1:06:40] the man who sits there and he's got
[1:06:41] these three small children and and
[1:06:43] they're just uncontrolled and they're
[1:06:46] all over everything and uh and causing
[1:06:50] all kinds of disturbance and the train
[1:06:52] goes on and this man's trying to read
[1:06:54] the paper the the man he keeps looking
[1:06:56] at the father of these children and he
[1:06:59] seems to be just it totally totally
[1:07:04] uh he's unaware. He's he just isn't
[1:07:07] there. He doesn't he doesn't hear his
[1:07:09] kids. He doesn't see them running and
[1:07:12] climbing all over the seats and causing
[1:07:14] a big disturbance and he just he's just
[1:07:17] not there. And and this man is just he's
[1:07:21] ready to give him a piece of his mind.
[1:07:24] He just ready to blast him and finally
[1:07:28] he says sir he says uh you know he
[1:07:31] address he says your children are are
[1:07:33] you know rather unruly etc you know and
[1:07:36] he came rather mild and a man kind of
[1:07:39] come oh he said I I'm sorry I I'm sorry
[1:07:42] he said uh uh he said you understand see
[1:07:46] he said I just came from the hospital he
[1:07:47] said and the children and my wife just
[1:07:51] passed away and the children's 's mother
[1:07:54] has has passed away. Well, just those
[1:07:58] words
[1:08:00] caused a cataclysmic
[1:08:04] paradigm shift. And then the people
[1:08:07] around that heard it and immediately
[1:08:10] they had compassion. Oh, we're so sorry.
[1:08:13] Can we help you? Can Now, a moment ago,
[1:08:17] they're ready to pound those kids. See a
[1:08:20] moment ago their their whole emotion
[1:08:23] that was caught up in the way they were
[1:08:25] seeing things. Now the scene didn't
[1:08:28] change. The scene was exactly the same.
[1:08:31] The children were exactly the same.
[1:08:33] There's the same man. Everything in the
[1:08:36] car was exactly the same. But what
[1:08:38] changed was them.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; The way they saw it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And this is so striking today. You know,
[1:08:45] I began to uh I I've I've thought about
[1:08:48] this for a very long time. So, I want to
[1:08:51] take my time and convey it to you. We we
[1:08:53] we see the world that we live in and the
[1:08:57] job and the places where you work and
[1:08:59] the schools that the our young people go
[1:09:02] to and the associations that we have and
[1:09:06] the the friends and good people and nice
[1:09:08] people that we know in the world and the
[1:09:11] stores you shop in and the fashions you
[1:09:14] buy and the restaurants you eat in and
[1:09:18] all of these things which are just a
[1:09:20] part of this life. But I wonder if we're
[1:09:23] seeing it through God's eyes
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; or I wonder if we're seeing it through
[1:09:27] eyes that have become conditioned by the
[1:09:31] age
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; until it was in the time of Amos when he
[1:09:36] had to come and blast out the vision of
[1:09:40] God till he could tell him, "I've set a
[1:09:42] plum line
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; and the word is my plum line
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to hold the nation. But
[1:09:49] I'm going to hold my people accountable
[1:09:51] to the plum line. And they've gone away.
[1:09:54] They've disregarded. And the thing that
[1:09:57] had influenced them was the good life,
[1:10:00] the generation, because things become
[1:10:02] acceptable. It's acceptable for women to
[1:10:05] walk down the street the way they walked
[1:10:07] down. It's acceptable for men and and
[1:10:10] women alike to make some uh uh unkind to
[1:10:16] say or to curse in public. Didn't used
[1:10:19] to be that way. What's changed?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Prophet said if a grandmother had
[1:10:24] dressed the way they dress today,
[1:10:27] some of the young ladies that walk and
[1:10:29] serve you in the in the restaurant, it's
[1:10:32] absolute shameful.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It's absolute nakedness. But you become
[1:10:37] accustomed to it. We need a paradigm
[1:10:39] shift.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We need a Holy Ghost paradigm shift.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; We need to see things as God sees them.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And so there are different kinds also of
[1:10:51] light. And the Bible says of Christ,
[1:10:55] "Then this this then is the message
[1:10:58] which we heard of him and declare unto
[1:11:01] you that God is light and in him is no
[1:11:04] darkness at all." Now, the reason why
[1:11:07] that's a different kind of light than
[1:11:10] just the light we have here today. And
[1:11:12] the reason why we have light is so that
[1:11:15] we can perceive, so that we can see, so
[1:11:19] that we can direct ourselves, so we can
[1:11:22] make our make an appropriate decision.
[1:11:25] You had to see to come into the church.
[1:11:27] We couldn't we'd had a confusion if we
[1:11:29] had zero light. So we've got
[1:11:31] electricity. Outside, we have daylight.
[1:11:35] And we do things in the daytime that we
[1:11:38] can't really do at night simply because
[1:11:41] we need the light. You need the light.
[1:11:44] But I can tell you one thing, friends.
[1:11:45] If you plan to get to heaven, you're
[1:11:48] going to need another kind of light.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; In him was light
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; and no darkness at all. And we need that
[1:11:57] light.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And he he determined he would convey the
[1:12:01] light outside. He's got a certain
[1:12:03] scientific way of doing it. Man and his
[1:12:06] ingenuity has devised a way to bring
[1:12:09] this light to us. And we don't
[1:12:12] understand everything. We don't
[1:12:13] understand all of the all of the cables
[1:12:16] and all of the substations and all of
[1:12:18] the generating units and whether they're
[1:12:21] gas or hydro or coal or what they are.
[1:12:24] We don't pay any attention to it. We're
[1:12:25] sitting here directing our affairs
[1:12:28] because we have light that man has made.
[1:12:30] But God has got light and he determined
[1:12:33] he'd convey that light to you by by word
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; and that you could only understand his
[1:12:40] word not by learning but by revelation.
[1:12:44] You can't even get it by me standing
[1:12:46] here preaching. You need to be praying
[1:12:48] today. Oh spirit of God, reveal to me.
[1:12:52] Author of this book, come to me by your
[1:12:55] Holy Spirit and reveal to me what I need
[1:12:58] to know. I desire to make heaven my
[1:13:00] home.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's a different kind of light. In him
[1:13:07] was life and the life was the light of
[1:13:10] man. John said again, "And this is the
[1:13:13] condemnation that light has come into
[1:13:16] the world and man loved darkness rather
[1:13:21] than light because his deeds was evil."
[1:13:25] We're requiring a different kind of of
[1:13:28] faculty for that light. Brother Brandham
[1:13:31] says spiritual things are spiritually
[1:13:33] discerned.
[1:13:36] There's a sp there's a natural sight and
[1:13:39] there's a spiritual sight.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; And we need desperately need spiritual
[1:13:45] sight.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; The fact that we may have it at one time
[1:13:49] doesn't mean that we have it all the
[1:13:50] time. We need to keep our vision
[1:13:53] cleared.
[1:13:55] Hallelujah.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; We got these glasses and first thing I
[1:13:59] do every morning is I clean them because
[1:14:03] they get dirty and I don't want an
[1:14:05] impaired vision.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; We need spiritual eyesight. Amen.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Friends, have you ever prayed that God
[1:14:13] would give you clearer sight, eyesight,
[1:14:16] because it doesn't mean, you know, just
[1:14:18] because we see things and and also uh I
[1:14:22] want to say to this congregation, you
[1:14:23] may see things even in one another,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; you may not have a real true vision of
[1:14:29] it.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; You may not have a real understanding.
[1:14:32] You may need a paradigm shift by the
[1:14:34] Holy Spirit.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Sometime we need to walk in the next
[1:14:37] person's shoes. We need to feel the next
[1:14:40] person's burden.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And we need to really learn to direct
[1:14:48] our own affairs.
[1:14:50] Direct our own affairs and pray for the
[1:14:53] affairs of others. Pray for the lives of
[1:14:55] others.
[1:14:58] Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That which was from the beginning, which
[1:15:02] we've heard, which we have seen with our
[1:15:04] eyes, and which we have looked upon and
[1:15:07] our hands have handled of the word of
[1:15:10] life. John has said this, listen very
[1:15:14] closely. that which was from the
[1:15:16] beginning, which we have heard, speaking
[1:15:19] of Christ, which we have seen, he saw
[1:15:22] him with our eyes, which we have looked
[1:15:24] upon, and our hands have handled of the
[1:15:27] word of life. For the for the life was
[1:15:30] manifested, and we've seen it, and bear
[1:15:33] witness, and show unto you that eternal
[1:15:35] life which was with the father, and was
[1:15:38] manifested unto us. He said, we we seen
[1:15:41] it. We didn't only see it. So did a lot
[1:15:44] of other people see it. Pilate saw it.
[1:15:46] Herod saw it. Caiaphas saw it. The
[1:15:48] Pharisees saw it. Sadducees saw it.
[1:15:51] Herodians saw it. The whole public saw
[1:15:53] it. But they didn't see it like John saw
[1:15:55] it.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; All kinds of people have saw the prophet
[1:16:00] of this day. All kinds of people were
[1:16:02] healed in the ministry. Millions heard
[1:16:05] the word, but there's a few people that
[1:16:07] heard it different
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; and they saw it different.
[1:16:11] They had a different view. They had a
[1:16:13] different understanding of it.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, friends, we talk about
[1:16:21] a message or a message book or a message
[1:16:24] tape or whatever more. Let me say to
[1:16:26] you, that's God's eyes
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; on this generation.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's what God thinks about this
[1:16:35] generation. If you want to look for God
[1:16:38] through God's eyes,
[1:16:40] next time you pick up a book, next time
[1:16:43] you read a message,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; don't forget that's not outside of this
[1:16:49] book.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; What it is, it is the focusing,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; fine-tuning,
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; focusing in on this age
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; of what God said in here about this age.
[1:17:05] This book covers the beginning to the
[1:17:06] end.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; But the message is that segment for our
[1:17:10] day.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; If you want to say it, your glasses will
[1:17:13] be shined up when you read a message.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; That's God's idea.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's God's plum line.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; So there's two main ways of seeing
[1:17:26] things. What sayest thou? Two main ways.
[1:17:31] And the one way is to see things as God
[1:17:35] sees them. To see things as Jesus saw
[1:17:38] them.
[1:17:40] The Bible says,
[1:17:43] "But when he saw the multitude,
[1:17:46] when he saw the multitude,
[1:17:50] he was moved with compassion
[1:17:53] on them because they fainted
[1:17:57] and they were scattered as sheep without
[1:18:00] a shepherd." Hey, the disciples didn't
[1:18:03] see that.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; They were believers. They didn't see
[1:18:09] that.
[1:18:13] All kinds of people were around there.
[1:18:15] They didn't see that.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; And what he saw moved him.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; He saw the people saw that they were
[1:18:26] fainting. Maybe they didn't even feel
[1:18:29] they were fainting, but he saw the true
[1:18:32] picture.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He saw them fainting.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; If he looks today, you were fine. You're
[1:18:39] all look fine. You've
[1:18:42] washed yourselves up and had your
[1:18:44] morning abolution uh you know washings
[1:18:48] and so on and dressed and came to
[1:18:50] church. But there's one here
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; that sees right down.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Sees the burden of your heart.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Sees what you've carried. Sees what you
[1:19:00] can't even express to somebody else.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's somebody here. I
[1:19:07] want to introduce you to him. If you
[1:19:09] haven't said hello recently,
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Rod sang
[1:19:15] our wonderful Lord.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; He is wonderful.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He is lovely.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; I'd like to bring you back in tune with
[1:19:28] his loveliness.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; One that sees exactly
[1:19:33] what you're going through. Sees exactly
[1:19:36] what beats in your heart. and he's the
[1:19:39] only one.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; And he sees it the way it really is.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't see it all entangled in all
[1:19:46] of the politics.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; He doesn't see it all messed up in
[1:19:50] family affairs and what someone else
[1:19:53] thinks. He sees it the way it really is.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for that.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad for that, friends.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I intend to preach this morning. Amen.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; We have one here,
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; who sees it really the way it is.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Sees people when they're faint. Sees
[1:20:18] people when their heart's broken. Sees
[1:20:21] them when they're weighted down. Sees
[1:20:23] them when sees you when you think
[1:20:25] there's no answer or what is the
[1:20:27] solution or nobody knows me. I think
[1:20:29] about our young people here. Do you know
[1:20:31] that up in the up in northern Canada and
[1:20:34] uh
[1:20:37] you know that there's crisis in some of
[1:20:38] our villages and cities
[1:20:42] and there's crisis amongst the
[1:20:45] teenagers. Do you know that the country
[1:20:47] has a dilemma with 15 year olds and 16
[1:20:51] year olds committing suicide?
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Because they've come to a place they
[1:20:58] haven't even they haven't even had an
[1:21:00] opportunity to really break out into
[1:21:02] life and already they see such a there's
[1:21:06] it's hopeless
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; to them and it's more desirable to end
[1:21:10] life than to go on. Isn't that tragic?
[1:21:14] Do you think that God doesn't see that?
[1:21:17] God sees that.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; I'll say like brother Benny Perry, are
[1:21:23] you listening?
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; No one else saw that. Jesus saw that.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this because I
[1:21:33] believe this congregation needs a
[1:21:34] paradigm shift. Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; I believe we need the Holy Spirit
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; to wash our minds and wash our thoughts
[1:21:42] and to give us a give us the very mind
[1:21:44] of Christ, the very the very plum line
[1:21:47] of God.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And this isn't something that happens in
[1:21:52] an individual service. This is something
[1:21:54] that a whole person's life is set in
[1:21:56] another direction. And I can preach that
[1:21:58] because I'm experiencing it
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; and I'm happy
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; to be able to think that God has mercy
[1:22:09] enough
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; to give us a paradigm shift
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; so we see things we can see things as
[1:22:21] God sees them.
[1:22:26] The Bible says of the woman, one more
[1:22:30] example,
[1:22:32] when Jesus was speaking to the woman at
[1:22:34] the well in John's gospel, the fourth
[1:22:36] chapter, the one scripture that the
[1:22:38] prophet mentions probably hundreds of
[1:22:41] times.
[1:22:43] And Jesus said unto her, I'm just giving
[1:22:46] these words. And Jesus said unto her,
[1:22:49] now it's just Jesus and this woman
[1:22:50] speaking.
[1:22:55] She said, 'I know when the Messiah
[1:22:57] cometh, he'll tell us all things.
[1:23:00] And Jesus said to her,
[1:23:03] I that speak unto thee am he.
[1:23:07] Now, she had a major m paradigm shift.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; She had a major shift.
[1:23:16] I want this congregation's full
[1:23:18] attention.
[1:23:21] I want you to look beyond
[1:23:23] the physical well, the physical woman
[1:23:27] and the physical man, Jesus Christ. I
[1:23:30] want you to look now into the realm of
[1:23:32] the eternities
[1:23:36] where beyond beyond and before the
[1:23:38] foundation of the world, it was
[1:23:39] determined that this woman would be
[1:23:41] born.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; It was known by God that she would live
[1:23:48] a life
[1:23:50] unclean.
[1:23:53] And then she would come to the well
[1:23:55] alone because she doesn't want to be
[1:23:57] identified or seen by the other women.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's the reality.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And before the foundation of the world,
[1:24:08] a lamb was slain for her.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And now here was Christ himself,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; God in flesh.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Coming to that well. Just think, he
[1:24:20] could have been in palaces. He could
[1:24:21] have been in big congregations. He could
[1:24:23] have been speaking to multitudes. He
[1:24:25] could have been with his disciples. But
[1:24:27] he decided and he went there and he
[1:24:30] needed to be at that well speaking to
[1:24:32] that one woman.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; He could have been persuading thousands
[1:24:36] or multitudes into the kingdom of God,
[1:24:40] but he determined to be there for one
[1:24:42] woman.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That's the way he saw it. Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; That's the way God saw it.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, this congregation, if we could just
[1:24:54] shake ourselves away from our human
[1:24:57] reasoning and our human thoughts, this
[1:24:59] is the way God saw it.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; She said, "I that speak to thee." She
[1:25:08] said, "I know when the Messiah cometh,
[1:25:10] he'll tell us all things. I that speak
[1:25:12] to thee am he."
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:16] And at that moment, the prophet said,
[1:25:19] "The light struck the seedl."
[1:25:24] [Applause]
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:27] in another realm
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; beyond beyond electric light beyond the
[1:25:32] outside light in another realm.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; The light
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; from eternity struck the seed.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; And she was birthed into the kingdom of
[1:25:45] God. She passed from darkness to light.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; She passed from the kingdom of darkness
[1:25:50] into the kingdom. She passed from
[1:25:52] harlotry to innocency.
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:25:57] Hallelujah. Say amen, somebody.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; What a moment.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And at that moment,
[1:26:07] the mighty apostles came.
[1:26:10] The believers,
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; the believers of the message arrived.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; They saw the same woman.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Saw the same man.
[1:26:25] their Lord. Are you believers? Yes.
[1:26:29] Who's your Lord? This is our Lord.
[1:26:32] Who are you following? We follow him.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; We believe him. He's God's the God
[1:26:38] prophet.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; What sayest thou?
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Well, quite frankly, the Bible says it.
[1:26:48] They marveled
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; that he was talking with the woman.
[1:26:53] Here
[1:26:55] comes the mighty apostles and they're
[1:26:57] marveling.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, we're believers. We will go to
[1:27:01] Cleverdale Bible way. We've been here
[1:27:03] for years. I had a mighty experience.
[1:27:05] We've had this. We've had that. Uh-huh.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And I'm not belittling that at all. But
[1:27:11] you need to be at the current moment.
[1:27:13] What is it that you see?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I see God doing things.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I have a vision
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; for what God wants to do. I believe
[1:27:24] we're in the winding up time. And if you
[1:27:26] believe it, I tell you what, my
[1:27:28] brothers, my sister, we're ready to give
[1:27:30] up.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And we have a complete different thought
[1:27:34] in our minds.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And we truly believe we're heading right
[1:27:39] into that rapture age. We're not going
[1:27:42] to go along just sitting on our laurels.
[1:27:44] We're not going to go on without a
[1:27:46] burden in our heart. We're not going to
[1:27:47] go long without a vision. It will be
[1:27:49] burning hotter than it ever has in our
[1:27:52] lives.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach a sermon. I'm
[1:27:57] here to tell you exactly what's in my
[1:27:59] heart.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; What sayest thou?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; What sayest thou, bride of Jesus Christ?
[1:28:05] What sayest thou? How do you say it?
[1:28:09] The apostles come
[1:28:13] and so affected me.
[1:28:18] A woman
[1:28:20] a woman had just passed
[1:28:23] from darkness to light.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Just passed from her harlotry
[1:28:29] to the perfection of innocency.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And the believers are wondering what's
[1:28:35] going on here?
[1:28:37] Why is he talking? So human,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So connected.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; So connected.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; They were so connected to just what
[1:28:47] their eyes were telling them that they
[1:28:49] were missing what God was doing.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; I want to say to this congregation,
[1:28:54] don't miss what God's doing.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; If you ever prayed for anything, pray
[1:29:00] that you'll have eyesight that peers
[1:29:02] into the unseen. Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Perry was preaching
[1:29:07] what he was preaching because I already
[1:29:09] been studying this for some days and I
[1:29:12] told you here I want to preach on what
[1:29:15] seeest thou
[1:29:17] and furthermore I was ready to preach
[1:29:20] Wednesday and I was at my computer and I
[1:29:23] was just making my notes and getting
[1:29:24] ready
[1:29:27] and
[1:29:29] I just felt exhausted. I mean beyond
[1:29:31] exhausted.
[1:29:34] I thought, well, this will pass in a few
[1:29:35] minutes. I'll just lay down. And I start
[1:29:37] feel a little upset to my stomach. I
[1:29:40] thought, I'll just wait a couple of
[1:29:41] hours. I'll be okay.
[1:29:44] Didn't happen. So, I called brother
[1:29:46] John. I said, "Play the tape,
[1:29:50] wave a true prophet, and tell the people
[1:29:55] that I believe that this is what needs
[1:29:56] to be heard." And as I laid there in
[1:29:58] bed, the Holy Spirit spoke to me. said,
[1:30:01] "I've set you aside.
[1:30:04] I want the people to hear this."
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I said, "Thy will be done.
[1:30:13] I'll just lay here." And hey,
[1:30:17] you heard it pure.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; What seeest thou, Amos? I see a plum
[1:30:24] line. What seeest thou bride? I say to
[1:30:27] the young people, what do you see? You
[1:30:29] really see a plum line. You see a plum
[1:30:31] line for your life, a plum line for your
[1:30:33] time, a plum line for everything that
[1:30:36] God has for you, a plum line in this
[1:30:38] generation, a plum line for your dress.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; A plum line for your conversation.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; A plum line for your business friends,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; a plum line for your job.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] Tell you what, there's nothing in this
[1:30:55] world that's worthy of being set on the
[1:30:58] same scale with this word.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world that's is
[1:31:04] worthy of being set on the same scale.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I've talked to people and I've said on
[1:31:09] this side, on this side of the balances,
[1:31:11] you have, you know, you have eternal
[1:31:14] life and you have the fellowship. You
[1:31:17] have the blood of Christ. You've got the
[1:31:19] blessings of God. You got a voice of a
[1:31:22] sentent to you. You've got a prophet's
[1:31:24] message over here on this side. On this
[1:31:26] side, what are you going to what are you
[1:31:27] going to offset by it? What are you
[1:31:29] going to trade for it?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; In a message he cares to you, he said.
[1:31:40] He says, "But look at that little
[1:31:41] immoral woman. When the light struck
[1:31:43] her, there was something laying there to
[1:31:47] take care of her condition. And this is
[1:31:50] what Jesus saw.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; That's what he saw. Disciples didn't see
[1:31:55] it. No one else saw it. And I I say,
[1:31:58] God, give this congregation insight.
[1:32:00] When we look at people, when we look at
[1:32:02] a someone else, when we look at some
[1:32:04] effort that somebody's making, let's be
[1:32:06] able to look beyond the human, the
[1:32:08] natural, the material.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Some may come in and say, "Oh, they got
[1:32:17] a new speaker." or oh, they got a new
[1:32:19] this or they got that's not the point.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; It's what is the purpose? What's the
[1:32:23] objective?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Just trying to have things pretty. Not
[1:32:27] at all.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Just trying to have things better. No,
[1:32:31] that's not the point. The point is God
[1:32:33] help us somehow to reach further.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; We've had all kinds of uh uh nasty
[1:32:41] things said because we've put them
[1:32:43] brother's messages on the hub.
[1:32:46] I tell you, I I can't even I can't even
[1:32:50] comprehend
[1:32:52] what kind of spirit it is that wants to
[1:32:55] prevent somebody from having the message
[1:32:57] in their language.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; I can't even I can't even bring it into
[1:33:01] my mind. It doesn't even come within the
[1:33:03] scope of my reasoning.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I would think that everybody would say,
[1:33:06] "Go for it. Go for it. Do it. Do it. Can
[1:33:09] we help? Can we do something?
[1:33:13] [Music]
[1:33:17] You don't know what we go through.
[1:33:21] I've been accused in the last few weeks
[1:33:23] of stealing
[1:33:26] translated messages. I have I don't even
[1:33:29] got anything to do with it.
[1:33:31] Never laid hands on them.
[1:33:34] Don't even know. Don't even know the
[1:33:36] people. Never met the people who gave
[1:33:37] them. Never met the translator.
[1:33:45] Nobody here in the church even had a
[1:33:47] physical hand in in putting them on the
[1:33:50] hub.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; But I guess they have to have somebody.
[1:33:57] Does it hurt? Yeah, it hurts.
[1:34:01] Good people. So you remember me. You
[1:34:04] preached in our church. You did this.
[1:34:05] You did this. What would ever possess
[1:34:07] you to steal the messages?
[1:34:13] I'm not a duck that has water just run
[1:34:15] off his back.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; And I think, why wouldn't somebody be
[1:34:24] able to see beyond that?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Say, I'm rejoicing.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Go for it. Go for it. Let
[1:34:32] somebody hear the word of God.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Let it go. Let Let it go. Let it be
[1:34:37] released.
[1:34:39] Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible says,
[1:34:53] "And he set his face toward Jerusalem
[1:34:55] and Calvary."
[1:34:57] The Bible says, "And it came to pass
[1:35:00] when the time was come that he should be
[1:35:02] received up, he steadfastly set his face
[1:35:06] to go to Jerusalem."
[1:35:09] What was he saying?
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; What was he looking at? And the Bible
[1:35:14] tells us in Hebrews of prophet uh Paul
[1:35:17] speaking now. He says, "Looking unto
[1:35:20] Jesus, the author and the finisher of
[1:35:22] our faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:35:26] before him, endured the cross, despising
[1:35:30] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[1:35:33] hand of the throne of God, he who for
[1:35:36] the joy that was set before him." What
[1:35:39] was the joy that was set before him?
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Who was the joy?
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; He went there for you.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He saw you. Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; That's not just a story. He saw you,
[1:35:51] young people. He saw you.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; He actually looked and saw you.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; He saw this host of people.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; He saw his bride.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And it was the joy that was set before
[1:36:05] him. And the joy was so great. He knew
[1:36:08] he knew that the that the lashes were
[1:36:10] going to come. He knew the mockery was
[1:36:12] going to come. He knew the beating. He
[1:36:14] knew the cross.
[1:36:16] And he despised it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, what he was seeing.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, I could say, "What seeest thou,
[1:36:25] Jesus?"
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; I see the redeemed.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What seeest thou, Jesus? I
[1:36:31] see the redeemed. I see the millennium.
[1:36:34] I see my wife. I see my bride. I see the
[1:36:37] saints.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; What seeest thou, Jesus? I see the
[1:36:41] resurrection.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I see them coming. What sayest thou
[1:36:46] Jesus? I see death defeated.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; What seeest thou Jesus?
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; I see my joy
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; that's set before me.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And this is what I'm speaking for to you
[1:37:08] for uh speaking this to you.
[1:37:13] There were so many others.
[1:37:18] All the disciples were there.
[1:37:21] But say thou, Peter,
[1:37:23] I say Malcus, I say these high priest
[1:37:26] servants, and I'm not going to let them
[1:37:27] take him.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I got my sword on my side, and I'm ready
[1:37:32] to protect him. I'll he these guys to
[1:37:35] pieces if they come and try to take him.
[1:37:39] What sayest thou, John?
[1:37:42] What sayest thou?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; And they follow him
[1:37:47] into his
[1:37:49] judgment and into his crucifixion,
[1:37:52] bewildered,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; seeing the demise of the kingdom, seeing
[1:37:56] the
[1:37:59] power
[1:38:00] gone.
[1:38:02] What happened to the message? Message
[1:38:05] lost its power. No, it's just that they
[1:38:07] couldn't see what they're supposed to be
[1:38:09] looking at.
[1:38:12] He had to remind them the son of man
[1:38:14] will go to the grave. All kinds of
[1:38:16] things are happening.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; You know in this land today we get all
[1:38:20] consumed with different things and the
[1:38:22] economy and the elections and this
[1:38:25] president that president this prime
[1:38:27] minister whatever more it's going to
[1:38:29] come and it's going to go.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; But we have a we have an eyesight.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; We have a plum line.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a vision. Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther had his vision and others
[1:38:43] have their vision. But we have a vision.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; And it's a vision that's been given to
[1:38:48] us by the message of the hour.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And I say to you that love the message,
[1:38:53] you that read it, you that hear it, do
[1:38:55] you have the eyes of the message?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; That's God's eyes
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; on this generation.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; God looked through that prophet. God
[1:39:05] looked through Amos's eyes.
[1:39:10] And
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; so we don't want to have eyes that are
[1:39:12] conditioned
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; to this age.
[1:39:24] So we see things
[1:39:29] and I can't hardly speak about them
[1:39:30] because we see them every day
[1:39:33] and this just looks normal. This just
[1:39:35] looks ordinary
[1:39:37] and there are times that are things that
[1:39:39] are appropriate.
[1:39:41] I believe that when we come to the house
[1:39:43] of God, we should come respectful.
[1:39:46] We should come clean,
[1:39:50] not
[1:39:52] not because that's acceptable of
[1:39:54] somebody else. It has to do with us
[1:39:56] individually between you and God.
[1:40:00] when there's something to do.
[1:40:03] If we could see the vision and have eyes
[1:40:06] that looked into eternity,
[1:40:09] say, "Oh, God,
[1:40:11] Brother Ed,
[1:40:14] Brother Tom, Brother Lance,
[1:40:17] Brother John, Brother Ernie,
[1:40:20] is there something I can do? Can I help
[1:40:22] you?" I appreciate there's there's
[1:40:25] things that's taking place here that you
[1:40:27] don't even realize.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, we I was going to have a
[1:40:32] brother Jake Dick. Brother Jake Jr.,
[1:40:35] where's Brother Jake Jr.?
[1:40:38] Oh, yeah. Right there. Brother Jake just
[1:40:41] made a trip here short time ago down
[1:40:44] into Mexico. I don't want to distract
[1:40:45] you, but he goes on a trip. This is kind
[1:40:48] of his vacation. He goes into Mexico
[1:40:50] where the family once lived and he goes
[1:40:54] to this group and he goes to some of the
[1:40:56] old Menanite people and he gives out
[1:40:59] some message books and he speaks to them
[1:41:01] and he makes another trip another time
[1:41:03] and made trips in the previous time and
[1:41:06] now he takes pictures and he get amongst
[1:41:08] some believers and and
[1:41:11] while while the church goes on, you come
[1:41:12] here, we sit there, we hear the music,
[1:41:14] hear song, hear brothers sing and so on
[1:41:16] and so forth. But in another in another
[1:41:19] realm,
[1:41:21] there's people that's
[1:41:24] Why am I saying this? To make you feel
[1:41:25] bad? No, not at all. You said I want I
[1:41:29] want to inspire you.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; I want to be a spiritual motivational
[1:41:34] speaker for a moment.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you you can do it.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; You got a voice.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; You can say amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; You can also ask someone else. You can
[1:41:46] talk to them about the word. You can
[1:41:47] talk about and there's a whole host of
[1:41:49] witness. I started counting the
[1:41:52] countries that this church has touched
[1:41:55] in a direct way. I'm talking about a
[1:41:58] direct way. Not only with ministry, but
[1:42:02] with assisting them to get the word and
[1:42:04] to get the message out to the countries.
[1:42:06] I started to count the countries and I
[1:42:08] just give up
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; this morning. I just give up. And do you
[1:42:11] think I regret any one of them? Do you
[1:42:14] think I regret a single offering? Do you
[1:42:16] think I regret a single thing? Do you
[1:42:18] regret it?
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; We don't regret it.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; What do we say? Lord, strengthen us.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Let us do more.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Can I have a just a little more time,
[1:42:41] please?
[1:42:48] The Bible says
[1:42:51] uh that rather I'm sorry that in the
[1:42:54] message Christ is a mystery. He said
[1:42:57] notice the anointed man the Christ
[1:43:00] himself here through God is made known.
[1:43:04] He has the preeminences God fully
[1:43:06] manifested in Jesus Christ.
[1:43:10] God's great secret of his revelation.
[1:43:13] This great light of revelation has
[1:43:16] always blinded the wisdom of the world
[1:43:18] of this world. Now friends, here's a
[1:43:21] condition, a spiritual condition that
[1:43:23] exists at this time
[1:43:26] right here in our day.
[1:43:29] God
[1:43:31] God decided that he would shine a great
[1:43:34] light
[1:43:37] in this last
[1:43:39] last age.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach now. I want to
[1:43:45] talk to you. And the reason why he
[1:43:49] determined to do that and prophesied
[1:43:51] that he would do that is because this
[1:43:53] would be the age
[1:43:57] that would be called to judgment.
[1:44:00] And I don't know whether you can see it.
[1:44:02] I'm sure that you can.
[1:44:05] You realize that the world and the
[1:44:08] smartest men in the world and the
[1:44:11] greatest and most influential men in the
[1:44:14] world do not have any answers for us.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; They don't have the answer for the
[1:44:24] politics and peace.
[1:44:26] They don't have the anti- answer for
[1:44:29] Iraq or Iran or Afghanistan or Pakistan
[1:44:32] or India or Israel
[1:44:36] or the West Bank
[1:44:40] or Kazakhstan and all the other stands.
[1:44:46] There's no answer.
[1:44:50] We're living in a almost an an illusion
[1:44:54] that somebody's going to come.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, I think that the enormous
[1:45:00] popularity of the president that's just
[1:45:03] been elected in the United States,
[1:45:07] actually, people say, "Well, the first
[1:45:09] black president." No, it's not that.
[1:45:14] It's not that at all.
[1:45:16] It's that the people are weary
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; and the people are looking
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; for an answer.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God put it in the
[1:45:26] proper language. He said, "Everybody's
[1:45:29] looking for a Messiah.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody to lead us out
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; of this dilemma.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody to show us the way.
[1:45:47] of the United Nations. And then you hear
[1:45:52] the Secretary General of the United
[1:45:54] Nations making a statement, and I'll
[1:45:55] quote him,
[1:45:57] "Israel shall withdraw from Gaza,
[1:46:01] even if Hamas doesn't stop firing
[1:46:05] missiles
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; into Israel."
[1:46:08] You heard it. You read it.
[1:46:11] What kind of intelligence is that?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; It's like saying you shall not protect
[1:46:18] your home. You shall leave it unlocked
[1:46:21] even though these people are going to
[1:46:23] come and steal everything.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Leave it unlocked. What kind of advice
[1:46:28] is that?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not here. We're not here. We're not
[1:46:31] interested in politics. All I'm saying
[1:46:33] is that the world will never raise. No
[1:46:38] man shall ever rise. that shall be a
[1:46:41] messiah to show the world out of this
[1:46:43] mess.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; There's one,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; none other than Jesus Christ himself.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that he will set
[1:46:52] up a kingdom of righteousness.
[1:46:54] [Applause]
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; He is called the prince of peace
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and he and he alone will bring peace.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; This is who has been revealed to you.
[1:47:07] Amen.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And there wasn't enough amens on that.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; This is who it is who descended in
[1:47:16] Revelation 10:1.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; None other than the prince of peace
[1:47:20] himself.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; And I say to this people, what seeest
[1:47:24] thou?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; When you read Revelation 10, what seeest
[1:47:30] thou?
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; A scripture that has a lot of debate. It
[1:47:34] has no debate for me. This is none other
[1:47:36] than what the prophet has declared.
[1:47:38] Christ himself descending at this time.
[1:47:42] [Applause]
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; That's only him.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of this turmoil, he
[1:47:51] brings perfect peace.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have that yet, I'm here
[1:47:57] to declare to you in the name of that
[1:48:00] one Jesus Christ, it is your portion.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:04] We're not to be here to be in a constant
[1:48:06] upset and a constant turmoil and
[1:48:08] constant distress and constant anxiety.
[1:48:12] That's not our portion.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Here's your portion. My peace.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Give I unto thee.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Not as the world giveth,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; but I give it to you.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] In the midst of defeat, in the midst of
[1:48:32] the sinful age, in the midst of all of
[1:48:35] the environment we're in,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; my peace.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time staying on this
[1:48:42] message because another message I have
[1:48:44] is crowding in on me.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; We can see all kinds of things. Young
[1:48:51] people, you can see opportunities.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; You really need to see them for what
[1:48:57] they're worth.
[1:49:01] measured with eternity's values,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; mental perception,
[1:49:08] all these things. How do we see? And not
[1:49:10] only how do we see, but what do we see?
[1:49:21] I read the scripture this morning
[1:49:25] concerning Amos's time. And just here,
[1:49:29] give me a few moments to relate what
[1:49:32] brother Brandham says about Amos.
[1:49:36] Said Israel was backsliden,
[1:49:40] backsliden condition. Her preachers, her
[1:49:42] priests, and also her government had all
[1:49:45] left the word of the Lord.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; You know what he said? They didn't
[1:49:49] believe that. That's
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; They didn't believe that. You couldn't
[1:49:52] convince them they believed that.
[1:49:55] And he says now they didn't believe
[1:49:56] that.
[1:49:58] He said they believed that they were
[1:50:00] with the word of the Lord.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You can imagine the kind of situation,
[1:50:06] the kind of uh struggle it would be for
[1:50:10] people to live. It's difficult to live
[1:50:12] when when when there are those that are
[1:50:16] completely given over to religion.
[1:50:23] I am I'm just going to drop something in
[1:50:24] because it's bothering me so bad.
[1:50:33] One of the things I just want you to be
[1:50:35] thinking this is what I'm going to
[1:50:36] preach about going to preach on this.
[1:50:41] One of the things
[1:50:44] that Satan has
[1:50:48] almost perfected
[1:50:51] in this generation
[1:50:53] in this of Satan's Eden.
[1:50:58] God came to a perfection in his time.
[1:51:00] But something that Satan has almost
[1:51:01] perfected
[1:51:04] is that he has taken
[1:51:08] the science and the inventions
[1:51:13] and one of the greatest
[1:51:16] uh
[1:51:18] one of the greatest avenues and channels
[1:51:22] to reach down into the inner part of a
[1:51:26] human is by sight.
[1:51:32] And when when the cinema
[1:51:36] when movies
[1:51:39] and Hollywood and that is why when the
[1:51:41] prophet says Hollywood he just
[1:51:45] brings that all together
[1:51:47] but when Hollywood came and don't ever
[1:51:52] think for a moment because I know you'll
[1:51:53] agree with me. It is like that received
[1:51:57] some kind of infusion of some
[1:51:59] supernatural anointing. Not from God,
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; but it just exploded.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; And the whole entertainment world and
[1:52:08] what you see today has such an impact.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Such an impact. And it shapes people's
[1:52:14] thinking.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; It changes how they want to look.
[1:52:19] It comes down and transforms him into
[1:52:21] another kind of an image because young
[1:52:23] men, young women, people, mothers, they
[1:52:26] see that and they see and he's put
[1:52:29] before them that the women can rise and
[1:52:32] uh be CEOs and be all of these things.
[1:52:35] Fine, they can. And as soon as someone
[1:52:36] says, "Well, no, it's not their place."
[1:52:38] They say, "You're anti. You're against
[1:52:39] it. You you want to keep us restricted.
[1:52:41] You want to keep us tied down to the
[1:52:42] kitchen."
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:46] and Satan put before them and tantalized
[1:52:49] the world. And then that began to
[1:52:51] permeate every area of life,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; the home,
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; the children,
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; the education,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; the business place,
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; the workplace, all positions.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; We know
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; we know it's it's it's counterbalance.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; It's not correct. It isn't what God
[1:53:12] wanted. It's not building a nation
[1:53:14] according to the plum line.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And then as a master stroke, he
[1:53:22] permeates into the church
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; and into religion
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; and he brings it because that plays so
[1:53:32] completely, God help me. I don't want to
[1:53:34] take the thunder out of the message, but
[1:53:35] this is really the heart of it. It plays
[1:53:38] so much onto the emotional realm.
[1:53:42] so much
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; it catches a hold of you and you see
[1:53:46] some film or some something happening,
[1:53:48] some tragedy and they can sway the
[1:53:51] people however they want. They can put
[1:53:54] whoever they want in a position or they
[1:53:56] can take a good person and tear them to
[1:53:58] shreds and make them a a nasty no good
[1:54:02] person. Amen.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; It has such power.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; And and what it really what it was now,
[1:54:11] it was a homogenizing. Listen close now.
[1:54:13] It was a homogenization, a homogenizing
[1:54:17] of the realm,
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; of the spirit
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; and the body and the senses.
[1:54:25] until until people were absolutely
[1:54:30] absolutely
[1:54:31] convinced that when they feel something
[1:54:34] in that emotional realm, it's God.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't God at all.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; It hasn't even reached the soul.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; It's not even near the soul.
[1:54:52] And so it came permeated and was
[1:54:55] pregnantated in every part. And people
[1:54:58] were moved and and Satan knew that the
[1:55:00] churches wanted numbers and they knew
[1:55:02] they wanted greatness and they knew they
[1:55:04] wanted popularity and they knew they
[1:55:06] wanted numbers and and and and money and
[1:55:08] power. And so here was the tools.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And so they begin to use all of that
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; as a tool
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; to further their ambitions.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; All right. And he knew also that there
[1:55:23] would be a bride called out. Oh my.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; He knew also there would be a bride
[1:55:28] called out. And so he tried to make the
[1:55:30] lines fuzzy.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; That if you feel it, you got it.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Stay with me.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; If you got moved like you do in the
[1:55:40] world or like you did before, you got
[1:55:42] moved. I'm moved. I I I I feel sorry.
[1:55:45] I'm I'm crying, aren't I?
[1:55:50] is here to tell you that's not it.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; That can be part of it, but that's not
[1:55:56] it.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Until I travel and I'm amongst
[1:55:59] believers,
[1:56:01] all kinds of churches.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And that's not it.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; I cry.
[1:56:11] I shed tears. And I'm glad that I do.
[1:56:15] I get happy. I clap my hands
[1:56:19] but that's not it.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; That is not it.
[1:56:25] And it became now listen closely. It has
[1:56:28] become so
[1:56:32] so homogenized is the best word for me
[1:56:35] that they can't separate even believers
[1:56:39] can't separate
[1:56:41] what is actually word
[1:56:44] from
[1:56:46] uh a a a feeling or an emotion or some
[1:56:50] sense or some something that happens
[1:56:53] inside.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stay on this just a moment.
[1:56:56] Are you with me? Yes,
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to give you a scripture and
[1:57:01] this is a scripture you that have search
[1:57:03] programs, you can go and search it in
[1:57:05] the message. This is one brother
[1:57:06] Brandham uses all the time. And don't
[1:57:08] don't don't forget what I'm saying right
[1:57:10] now. If I passed away this afternoon,
[1:57:13] this is probably one of the most
[1:57:14] important things I could say to you.
[1:57:16] This is something that he has achieved
[1:57:18] in this generation.
[1:57:22] And the scripture that brother Brandham
[1:57:24] uses to counter that. And this scripture
[1:57:26] will mean more to you than at any any
[1:57:28] time in life your life. For the word of
[1:57:30] God is quick and powerful
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; piercing even even
[1:57:43] to the dividing aunderder
[1:57:45] of soul and spirit.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and of the joints and marrow and
[1:57:51] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:57:53] intents of the heart. There is only one
[1:57:56] thing that you have access to.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; That can reach within your being.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Reach within your decision making, reach
[1:58:08] within your life, your daytoday life.
[1:58:11] There's only one thing that has access
[1:58:14] to be able to divide between soul and
[1:58:18] spirit and that is the word of God of
[1:58:21] the hour, the message of the hour. It
[1:58:24] isn't only eyesight, but it's the only
[1:58:26] thing that can actually divide between
[1:58:28] so that you can look at it and I say,
[1:58:30] "What seeest thou bride?"
[1:58:36] And so you're faced with a decision and
[1:58:38] you just begin to weigh things out and
[1:58:41] well it will improve this and it'll make
[1:58:42] that better and I can do this and etc
[1:58:45] etc.
[1:58:47] You know what you need to do? You need
[1:58:50] to take the binoculars of the message
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; and look upon your life and upon your
[1:58:57] decision
[1:58:58] and upon
[1:59:06] upon every part of your life.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I might make some enemies here, but I
[1:59:12] say to you young men and women or not
[1:59:15] necessarily so young men and women that
[1:59:18] are unmarried,
[1:59:21] I would say to you, don't go hunting on
[1:59:23] a computer for your mate.
[1:59:30] I've had people call me and say, "Will
[1:59:32] you marry us? I found my husband. My
[1:59:35] relatives go to your church. I found my
[1:59:38] husband on the on the internet." And I
[1:59:42] said, "No, I can't because I can't marry
[1:59:44] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:59:46] Christ."
[1:59:47] What do you know about that man? What do
[1:59:49] you know about that girl? How well do
[1:59:51] you know? Have you seen them go through
[1:59:52] thick or thin? Have you seen a man that
[1:59:55] has has lived for God and has been an
[1:59:58] example and has gone through thick and
[2:00:01] thin, has gone through discouragement,
[2:00:04] has I've seen him in warfare. I've seen
[2:00:05] him in battles and I've seen him stand
[2:00:08] steadfast for the things of God. And
[2:00:11] that's the kind of person that can be a
[2:00:13] a priest in our home and can be an
[2:00:16] example to our children.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; They don't do anything about that.
[2:00:21] and then come back and say, "We got
[2:00:23] problems." Of course you have problems.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Say, "Amen, folks."
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Who designed the problem? It was
[2:00:37] designed by Satan himself in the pits of
[2:00:40] Hollywood.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Love him. I call them gum wrapper. gum
[2:00:47] wrapper uh marriages and engagements.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; They say had it just the other day
[2:00:58] call. I get calls from overseas. I get
[2:00:59] called from all over the place. Says,
[2:01:01] "Well, this girl said she'd marry him."
[2:01:03] I said, "They don't know nothing about
[2:01:04] marriage. They know nothing about
[2:01:06] engagement." Well, I said, "No, she's
[2:01:08] married to him." Brother Brandham says,
[2:01:09] I said, "You're jumping into the middle
[2:01:10] of the pond. You're jumping into the
[2:01:12] middle of the stream. Go back to the
[2:01:14] beginning." He said that the young lady
[2:01:16] and the young man, they ought to be uh
[2:01:18] even the parents should be involved. It
[2:01:20] was the old eastern custom. I said,
[2:01:22] "You're not going. You're jumping in the
[2:01:23] middle of the stream with a western
[2:01:25] custom.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Made in Hollywood custom. That's not
[2:01:28] what he's talking about. Talking about
[2:01:31] two people. Don't let me get into this.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; This a kind of teaching that the
[2:01:38] congregation needs. And it it it it's
[2:01:41] become a whole realm of nothing more
[2:01:43] than in the spirit
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; in the spirit. People feeling things in
[2:01:48] their in their whole and and I don't
[2:01:50] want to just call emotion because I
[2:01:51] believe in emotion. But it's in that
[2:01:53] realm where I was touched and oh I feel
[2:01:55] things and oh whether it is this or
[2:01:57] whether it's that or whether it's my
[2:01:59] affection or my love or something. I
[2:02:01] can't serve God because my my I I'm
[2:02:04] connected to my children. You need the
[2:02:06] eyesight of the message.
[2:02:10] If God calls you, there's no reason why
[2:02:12] a man and a woman don't become
[2:02:14] separated.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Is this too straight?
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; This message and what it speaks is the
[2:02:25] eyesight of God. Yes.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; And if you men, women, anyone, home,
[2:02:31] family, feel drawn and pulled and
[2:02:34] persuaded and there's there's some
[2:02:36] there's something that's exciting about
[2:02:38] it. There's something that's enthuses
[2:02:41] you. There's something be sure and go
[2:02:42] back to the message and see how God
[2:02:44] looks on it.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Where's it going to take you?
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. Yet I'm not ashamed of it.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the generation,
[2:03:01] don't feel me, just an old square. But
[2:03:04] he says the generation was a glamorous.
[2:03:07] This is the word he uses.
[2:03:09] Israel was at its height
[2:03:11] and it was very glamorous and the women
[2:03:14] were dressed to the spot and the men and
[2:03:17] they were pleasure stricken and running
[2:03:20] races and Olympics and everything going
[2:03:23] on.
[2:03:26] I've been on to some of the sites of the
[2:03:28] young people of this church
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; and the internet hears it now
[2:03:34] and are so excited and all enthused
[2:03:36] about what the Conucks are doing and I
[2:03:38] just love the hockey and I just love the
[2:03:39] NHL or I love the NBA or something else.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; And I I look at it and I say, "Why
[2:03:45] aren't they saying I just read the
[2:03:47] scripture and I just I fell in love with
[2:03:49] the scripture and God just spoke to me."
[2:03:52] Oh,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; aren't you with me?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; You're not looking through the eyes of
[2:03:59] God. I say, young people, what seeest
[2:04:01] thou?
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; You just gone through the seals. What
[2:04:09] seeest thou?
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; And then he said,
[2:04:15] if you ever see him,
[2:04:19] if you ever see him,
[2:04:21] You can never be the same.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; That's the vision I wish that you'd have
[2:04:27] this morning.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; If you ever see him, you'll see him from
[2:04:32] inside.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; You just won't see a man like others.
[2:04:45] I could be greatly misunderstood,
[2:04:48] but I'm going to say it anyway. I've
[2:04:50] said it before. I think
[2:04:58] I consider to be highly privileged to
[2:05:00] have been able to know brother Brandham
[2:05:01] Fine. I don't try to make that and make
[2:05:05] that to impress anybody.
[2:05:08] I feel it's a great weight and
[2:05:09] responsibility on me that I would convey
[2:05:13] the right thing to people.
[2:05:15] But when I sat on that log,
[2:05:19] yeah, one minute we can just be joking
[2:05:21] and, you know, laughing and talking
[2:05:23] about things and then next moment
[2:05:30] and we're just and I'm I'm so crushed.
[2:05:32] I'm so burdened
[2:05:34] because at that time
[2:05:38] you have to forgive me. But I'm almost
[2:05:41] today where I was back then.
[2:05:45] I'd become saddened
[2:05:50] with the people.
[2:05:53] I became heavyhearted.
[2:05:56] You preached and it didn't seem that it
[2:05:58] really sunk in.
[2:06:02] Don't get me wrong, the people of the
[2:06:05] message today are completely different.
[2:06:07] But yet on the other hand, I could see
[2:06:10] that there was something lacking, really
[2:06:12] lacking.
[2:06:15] And yet I could see the anointing would
[2:06:17] come on
[2:06:20] and they could anoint and they were
[2:06:21] anointed and preached like a house on
[2:06:24] fire and pray for people and see
[2:06:27] healings.
[2:06:29] And yet I saw lives that didn't measure
[2:06:32] to the word of God.
[2:06:35] And more than that, they weren't that
[2:06:37] concerned about it.
[2:06:39] We're okay.
[2:06:46] As I looked at brother Brandham's face
[2:06:49] and it seemed that he wanted to just
[2:06:52] turn to turn the conversation a little
[2:06:55] bit spiritual and I was seeking that
[2:06:57] opportunity.
[2:07:00] So I said, "How is it, Brother Bradam,
[2:07:02] that people can get anointed and I know
[2:07:04] what the anointing is, but they get
[2:07:06] anointed
[2:07:10] and yet their lives don't match the word
[2:07:12] of God."
[2:07:15] He said, "Well, Brother Eddie, did you
[2:07:16] ever hear my message on false anointed
[2:07:18] ones?"
[2:07:20] For those of you that haven't heard it,
[2:07:22] that was May, last two weeks of May
[2:07:26] 1961.
[2:07:27] He did not preach false anointed ones
[2:07:30] until 1965.
[2:07:32] So he's asking me if I heard a tape that
[2:07:34] he hasn't even preached for over three
[2:07:36] years into the future
[2:07:39] because he was already touching
[2:07:41] something in my heart that is just
[2:07:43] personal to myself. Have you heard my
[2:07:46] tape the message on false anointed ones?
[2:07:49] And I said no. And I hung my head down
[2:07:52] because I was a little ashamed. I didn't
[2:07:54] brother Brandon.
[2:07:55] And then he just went to the scripture
[2:07:57] and he went to four scriptures.
[2:07:59] The rain falls on the just. And he said
[2:08:01] to me, I said, "The unjust." Right. He
[2:08:04] said, "What's the rain, brother Eddie?"
[2:08:06] I said, "It's the Holy Spirit." Exactly.
[2:08:09] The rain, the Holy Spirit falls on the
[2:08:11] just and the unjust.
[2:08:13] The tears and the wheat, they grew in
[2:08:16] the same field. He said, "You tell me
[2:08:18] what the wheat rejoiced in, and I'll
[2:08:21] tell you what the tears rejoiced in. You
[2:08:24] tell me what nourished the wheat and
[2:08:26] brought it to its fullness and I'll tell
[2:08:29] you what brought the tears.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; I said, "Okay, now they're starting." In
[2:08:35] the last days, Seth God, I'll pour out
[2:08:37] my spirit upon
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; and that's exactly what I said. He
[2:08:42] stopped upon and I said all he said a ll
[2:08:47] all flesh but not all flesh is saved.
[2:08:51] Right.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; And by that time, and he took me to one
[2:08:54] more scripture, and by that time I could
[2:08:56] see the whole church world and a
[2:08:59] thousand of my questions and what was in
[2:09:02] my heart, it just began to melt.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; And his face is about here.
[2:09:11] And I look up. He said, "Brother Eddie,"
[2:09:15] he said, "we were I was riding behind
[2:09:17] Brother Bud Southwick." Brother Buddy
[2:09:19] just said on a mountain, I believe it's
[2:09:22] this mountain he pointed to. Said, "I
[2:09:25] was just riding along behind him and he
[2:09:27] said the sun was shining down warm."
[2:09:31] He said
[2:09:34] he he came to me there.
[2:09:37] I knew right away because I I'd been on
[2:09:40] the platform. I'd heard him say, "He's
[2:09:43] here." And now he just said, "He came to
[2:09:46] me there." And at that moment with
[2:09:49] Roger, I just looked right into his
[2:09:50] face. I looked into his eyes about that
[2:09:53] far.
[2:09:55] I saw
[2:09:57] something entirely different.
[2:10:03] Don't mistake me. I looked into his eyes
[2:10:07] and the scripture came to me
[2:10:10] because as I looked into his eyes, I
[2:10:13] became naked before God.
[2:10:18] I became absolutely transparent.
[2:10:22] There wasn't a thing in my life hidden.
[2:10:24] And I knew from my earliest memory
[2:10:28] nothing could be concealed.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:10:32] I knew for the first time what the
[2:10:34] judgment was all about.
[2:10:37] God's not having to ask for a
[2:10:38] confession. It will be completely
[2:10:41] exposed.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; And that's why when you hear a tape and
[2:10:44] you hear him say, "You couldn't hide
[2:10:46] anything from me now.
[2:10:49] You couldn't hide anything in your life
[2:10:51] from me now." That's exactly where that
[2:10:53] person is. And now I'm there.
[2:10:56] And I look in those two eyes and the
[2:10:58] scripture came to me.
[2:11:00] the ancient of days that Daniel
[2:11:02] describes. He's describing Jesus Christ
[2:11:06] even before Jesus Christ was born. He's
[2:11:08] describing him and he says his eyes
[2:11:11] were as candles.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; And candle I don't mean in terms of dim
[2:11:17] light. I mean candle that was not
[2:11:20] shining, glittering, flashing, none of
[2:11:23] that. just two candles and they just
[2:11:26] burned two holes
[2:11:30] down into the very depths of my soul.
[2:11:34] And I thought,
[2:11:36] I am naked.
[2:11:39] I'm naked before God.
[2:11:44] What seeest thll?
[2:11:47] I saw Jesus Christ.
[2:11:50] Not the man,
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; not the person,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; not William Brandham.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; No, no, no.
[2:11:59] That presence.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Do you understand me?
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; I'd be so delighted if someone could go
[2:12:08] out of this service today and say,
[2:12:12] "Brother Biscll, I was at church this
[2:12:14] morning
[2:12:16] and the presence in the atmosphere
[2:12:21] overwhelmed me.
[2:12:24] It absorbed me. It penetrated me until I
[2:12:29] saw Jesus Christ.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; This wasn't just a Sunday morning
[2:12:34] service.
[2:12:37] And when I looked into his eyes and I
[2:12:39] knew nothing could be hidden, he said,
[2:12:42] "How gracious he is, how gracious the
[2:12:44] Lord Jesus is.
[2:12:46] I believe you have three questions
[2:12:49] you want to ask me.
[2:12:51] And the first one is on the baptism
[2:12:55] and the second one is on the gohead
[2:12:58] and the third one is on the serpent's
[2:13:00] seed.
[2:13:02] And I said
[2:13:04] that is true
[2:13:07] friends that was the beginning.
[2:13:10] But if you ask me today what what seeest
[2:13:12] thou? What did you see? Brother Ed
[2:13:15] Biscll
[2:13:17] from that day from that day to this day
[2:13:21] I can say I've seen Jesus Christ.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; I feel them. I sense him. And you can
[2:13:30] know I believe in emotions because I'm I
[2:13:33] have some emotions now.
[2:13:36] But I can't control these emotions.
[2:13:40] I say, "Isn't he lovely?" Amen.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Oh people,
[2:13:47] this one you can know
[2:13:51] this is not church.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; This isn't religion.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; This is what God came to do.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; To come and unite with you.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; This is what it's all about.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; If you've never known him, if you've
[2:14:05] never given your life to him,
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I would do so. Amen.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; I don't hesitate recommending him.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; And I don't hesitate for a minute saying
[2:14:18] sell all. Give yourself unreservedly to
[2:14:21] him.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads.
[2:14:28] Dear father,
[2:14:32] your plan of redemption, your plan of
[2:14:36] salvation is so glorious and so
[2:14:39] wonderful.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:14:42] and to think that you've sent the kind
[2:14:43] of word that you've sent
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; and how you have made known and brought
[2:14:48] to life certain scriptures that apply to
[2:14:52] our time and apply to us personally.
[2:14:55] I'm praying for these very dear precious
[2:14:59] friends, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[2:15:03] Oh God, oh God, take us out of take us
[2:15:07] out of just this little realm. Don't let
[2:15:10] us ever slip into just mere religion, oh
[2:15:12] God. But let us be that fervent. Let be
[2:15:15] that fervent first love bride of Jesus
[2:15:18] Christ. Oh God, I pray for everyone. I
[2:15:22] pray for this congregation and those
[2:15:24] that are perhaps uh with us in the
[2:15:28] internet, Lord. Go into the rooms, go
[2:15:30] into the homes, wherever they might be,
[2:15:32] into the little churches, wherever they
[2:15:34] might be. Into the fellowship room, into
[2:15:36] the fellowship room. Lord, I pray that
[2:15:38] in the into the nursery, I pray, oh God,
[2:15:40] that there will be a a a great
[2:15:43] sacredness it'll come. And may the Holy
[2:15:46] Spirit just in such a sweet and
[2:15:50] marvelous and mellow way come, I pray,
[2:15:53] Lord, and take a hold of the hearts now.
[2:15:57] Take a hold of the hearts, Lord, and let
[2:15:58] there be a response. I pray coming out
[2:16:01] of the very depths of the soul. We want
[2:16:03] the word, the two-edged sword to come
[2:16:07] and divide between the soul and the
[2:16:09] spirit. And bring this message to the
[2:16:12] soul. Lord, this is my prayer today.
[2:16:14] Bring this message to the soul. And may
[2:16:17] there be an immediate response within
[2:16:18] every heart and say, "Yay, Lord. I I
[2:16:21] give you all of myself. I give you all.
[2:16:24] I surrender all that I might be yours,
[2:16:27] Lord. that I might be not only yours but
[2:16:30] a surrendered one to you. We love you,
[2:16:33] Lord Jesus.
[2:16:36] We love you with all of our heart. I
[2:16:38] would like to just sing I love him. I
[2:16:40] love him because he first loved me.
[2:16:47] I
[2:16:50] love him.
[2:16:54] I
[2:16:57] love you.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; He first.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; You want to express it to him? Lift your
[2:17:11] hand to him. Raise your hand.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; And
[2:17:15] just
[2:17:20] shall be
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:34] Just once again,
[2:17:36] maybe you want to stand while we sing.
[2:17:38] And don't move. We're not through the
[2:17:40] service yet.
[2:17:43] [Music]
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; But just let that atmosphere come down
[2:17:47] now.
[2:17:50] I love
[2:18:02] me
[2:18:07] and
[2:18:12] my
[2:18:14] salation.
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:31] To start us off, let's have every voice
[2:18:33] once again. Then we'll ask the musicians
[2:18:36] just to cease so they can sing it also.
[2:18:39] I
[2:18:42] love
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; from the depth of your heart. I I
[2:18:50] love him
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:55] because
[2:18:58] he
[2:19:02] love
[2:19:03] me
[2:19:04] [Music]
[2:19:14] shall Sal,
[2:19:16] [Applause]
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:23] [Laughter]
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; I seek to bring you into the same
[2:19:34] atmosphere
[2:19:36] where that was being sung once
[2:19:40] and God's prophet says, "Do you love
[2:19:42] him?
[2:19:45] and then cries out, "You will not commit
[2:19:48] suicide, soldier boy." That's the devil
[2:19:50] talking to you. Well, you weren't there
[2:19:52] at that time. I was there, but I am here
[2:19:55] and you are here. And I will say to you
[2:19:57] while we are singing
[2:20:00] in the event
[2:20:02] that something going on and a struggle
[2:20:04] is going on, I will say to you, that's
[2:20:06] the devil talking to you.
[2:20:13] He's still here.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let anything prevent you
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; from receiving the full benefit of what
[2:20:22] God has for you. How many here in this
[2:20:24] congregation believe that God has
[2:20:26] something for every single person.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil talk to you. Don't
[2:20:32] let the devil try to hold you. Don't let
[2:20:34] the devil lie to you. He is a liar.
[2:20:38] Amen.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; The same as the prophet of God said at
[2:20:40] that time, you'll go home and be a real
[2:20:41] gentleman and be a real man. You can be
[2:20:43] a real woman. You can be a real man. You
[2:20:46] can be a real example. Hallelujah. You
[2:20:48] can be a real witness for Christ. Just
[2:20:50] give it all up right now.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I give it all up to him.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm
[2:21:00] not going to be apologetic about the
[2:21:01] service, friends.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Not for a moment. not apologetic for the
[2:21:07] service. I'm persuading you into a
[2:21:09] communion with Jesus Christ.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm glad the devil's a liar.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that the Holy Spirit is
[2:21:20] present.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we've got the message of the
[2:21:23] hour.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; I'm glad we have the answer,
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; the devil's answer. We have his answer.
[2:21:36] Would you like to just have your seats
[2:21:37] for just a moment?
[2:21:43] I haven't got time, but I'm going to
[2:21:45] just take a couple of minutes. Don't
[2:21:47] Don't move.
[2:21:49] You're going to see just what happened.
[2:21:52] And we have to shut the screaming
