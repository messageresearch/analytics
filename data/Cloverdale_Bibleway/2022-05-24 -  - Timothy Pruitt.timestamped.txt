[50:52] anniversary as well in our church so
[50:54] amen we have something in common with
[50:56] each other more than just amen things
[50:59] but
[51:00] it's the time it's amazing how god's
[51:02] time works
[51:03] and it's perfect amen and so we just
[51:05] went through that with our church and
[51:07] and we know where you're at today and
[51:09] it's it's it's quite a testimony that
[51:12] through many trials many heartaches many
[51:15] things a lot of water on the bridge
[51:17] we're still here
[51:19] amen we still remain
[51:21] and we're thankful for that amen god
[51:23] bless you today let's turn to psalms 40
[51:26] and verse 1
[51:27] and also isaiah 61
[51:30] and verse 1. i actually had a different
[51:33] thought as i was thinking about this
[51:35] meeting to minister this morning but
[51:36] yesterday things began to change very
[51:39] rapidly
[51:40] and
[51:41] so
[51:43] as we saw the direction last night was
[51:45] well thank you lord
[51:47] thank you lord so really if you want to
[51:48] you can just title this part too
[51:52] amen
[51:55] amen
[51:56] we'd like to sing or preach to you on us
[51:59] on the title
[52:00] a new song to sing
[52:02] a new song to sing
[52:04] the lord would actually give me those
[52:06] words in a very difficult moment as i
[52:08] was sit there on the pew there at my
[52:10] mother's memorial
[52:12] and he gave me this words and
[52:14] and i began to think about them and
[52:17] and what they meant and i realized you
[52:19] know my song was not a song of weariness
[52:21] or
[52:22] or grieving
[52:23] or hurt or pain my song was a song of
[52:26] the redeemed
[52:28] and god has it all in control
[52:31] amen and so we're going to bring from
[52:33] that today psalms 40 and verse 1
[52:36] i waited patiently for the lord and he
[52:39] inclined unto me and heard my cry
[52:42] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[52:45] pit out of the mirey clay and set my
[52:48] feet upon a rock
[52:50] and establish my goings
[52:52] and he hath put a new song
[52:54] in my mouth
[52:56] even praise unto our god many shall see
[52:59] it
[52:59] and fear and shall trust in the lord
[53:04] also isaiah 61 and verse 1
[53:07] says the spirit of the lord god is upon
[53:10] me
[53:11] because the lord hath anointed me to
[53:13] preach good tidings to the meek
[53:16] he has sent me to bind up the
[53:17] brokenhearted
[53:19] to proclaim liberty to the captives
[53:22] and the opening of the prison to them
[53:24] that are abound
[53:25] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[53:28] lord or we know that's the jubilee year
[53:31] i was looking at it again today in the
[53:32] amplified it says or the year of god's
[53:36] favor
[53:38] highly favored
[53:40] favor is approval support and love
[53:44] oh my what a year to be in
[53:46] and the day of vengeance of our god to
[53:49] comfort all that mourn
[53:52] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[53:55] to give unto them beauty for ashes the
[53:58] oil of joy for mourning the garment of
[54:00] praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[54:03] they might be called trees of
[54:05] righteousness the planting of the lord
[54:08] that he
[54:09] might be glorified
[54:11] what is this of all about this jubilee
[54:13] here that he
[54:14] might be glorified
[54:16] amen god bless you today you can be
[54:18] seated
[54:22] you know we've i don't know if you know
[54:25] about it but we've been through quite a
[54:26] few a couple of difficult years
[54:31] amen this covet and things and we saw
[54:33] very quickly how our lives could change
[54:36] we saw very quickly how governments can
[54:39] shut things down and things can take
[54:41] place and
[54:42] and even beyond what we could ever could
[54:44] imagine could take place and and i'm not
[54:47] going to get into all the politics of
[54:48] that but
[54:49] you know in this moment we find that
[54:52] many became very heavy or it was a
[54:54] spirit of heaviness that's beginning to
[54:56] settle upon the people
[54:58] you know and i in the last couple of
[54:59] years and and even even as it led up to
[55:02] that i i began to realize there was more
[55:04] young people than i'd ever seen
[55:06] or could thought imaginable that would
[55:08] come up and ask for prayer for suicide
[55:11] and have sueth outside thoughts and
[55:13] things
[55:14] you know and brother braddon would talk
[55:16] about this and back in 56 he said many
[55:18] are becoming discouraged
[55:21] you know when we become discouraged it
[55:24] takes our strength from us
[55:26] and we want to just give up and we want
[55:28] to just just lay it all aside and say
[55:30] i'm done
[55:32] you know i'm going to discourage satan
[55:33] likes to pull us away and and make us
[55:36] think that nobody else cares and nobody
[55:38] understands and and and you know to
[55:41] bring us into this you know this new
[55:42] word that we learn social distancing
[55:46] and and so and thoughts begin to run
[55:48] rampant and thoughts of unworthiness and
[55:50] never going to make it or it's too much
[55:53] to handle and heaviness is this great
[55:55] weight that sets down upon us and seems
[55:58] to squeeze the life out of us
[56:01] amen more people than ever is dealing
[56:03] with anxiety and fears and depression
[56:06] and discouragement that is set in and
[56:08] what is it is darkness that is closing
[56:11] in
[56:12] but he would finish that he said there's
[56:14] many that are becoming discouraged he
[56:16] said but what we need to do is to take
[56:19] courage
[56:20] we need to be encouraged
[56:22] trials may come we're never been
[56:24] promised to be immune from them but he
[56:27] said he would give us the grace to go
[56:28] through them amen if the mountain is too
[56:32] high or too deep or too wide he'll give
[56:34] us the grace to go through it he said
[56:36] just don't worry about it keep your eyes
[56:39] on christ
[56:41] it's a very important time key in the
[56:43] time we're living in is to keep your
[56:45] eyes on christ he is the only one that
[56:48] can take you through
[56:50] but you notice when the devil begins to
[56:52] discourage you and you get in a moment
[56:53] of discouragement he tries to pour it on
[56:56] you you know he tries to that's when he
[56:58] tries to really get to you you know all
[56:59] these thoughts so you'll never overcome
[57:01] you're you'll never make it through this
[57:03] battle you'll never get ahead you'll
[57:06] never get better cast all of that aside
[57:09] amen brother man we'll say it like this
[57:11] he don't god doesn't want you frowning
[57:13] god wants you happy he says the human
[57:15] heart is to be made happy worry causes
[57:18] cancer temper causes cancer don't ever
[57:21] be upset

[57:29] harm you

[57:33] there because i'm not in this alone
[57:35] because he promised he would never leave
[57:38] me or forsake me but he would be with me
[57:40] even in me to the end of the world so
[57:42] i'm not going through covet alone i'm
[57:45] not going through laodicea alone i'm not
[57:47] in this battle alone he is with me
[57:50] [Applause]
[57:51] amen if he's with me who can be against
[57:54] me
[57:54] no weapon formed against you shall
[57:57] prosper
[58:00] amen when you've got confidence in the
[58:02] one that's walking with you amen he's
[58:04] one that won't make you may have a best
[58:06] friend that's left you you may have
[58:08] somebody that said a lot of ugly words

[1:06:07] own self
[1:06:08] all the things that he lists there tear
[1:06:10] past the last days
[1:06:12] perilous times shall come
[1:06:15] we get all nervous and we get all upset
[1:06:17] and we think well how's this going to
[1:06:18] work out how that's going to be when is
[1:06:20] this going to take place i want to ask
[1:06:22] you something the last day's for who
[1:06:30] it ain't my last days
[1:06:33] amen if you'll read it right it's the
[1:06:34] last day
[1:06:36] it's the last days for cancer it's the
[1:06:39] last day for sugar diabetes it's the
[1:06:41] last day for blindness it's the last day
[1:06:44] for depression and anxiety and fear but
[1:06:47] it's not my last days
[1:06:50] i'm just about to step into eternity
[1:06:55] and i ask you when you get on the other
[1:06:57] side and you're shouting on the hills of
[1:06:59] glory where's all those trials gonna be
[1:07:02] where all those devils gonna be where's
[1:07:04] that cancer gonna be where's that
[1:07:06] problem gonna be it's gonna be gone
[1:07:10] [Applause]
[1:07:20] we get tore up worried about the last
[1:07:23] days
[1:07:24] and we're not at our last days
[1:07:28] we're just beginning
[1:07:32] i don't know about you but i'm just
[1:07:33] ready to get the party started
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:45] i want to bring us back to something in
[1:07:47] samuel 30 and verse 1.
[1:07:50] it came to pass
[1:07:52] when david and his men were come to zig
[1:07:54] lag
[1:07:55] on the third day and the amalekites
[1:07:57] invaded the south and ziglag and smit
[1:08:00] and ziglag and burned it with fire
[1:08:03] and taking the woman captive and they
[1:08:05] all that were therein they slew not any
[1:08:07] either great or small but carried them
[1:08:09] all away and went on their way
[1:08:11] and david and his men came to the city
[1:08:14] and behold it was burned with fire
[1:08:16] and their wives and their sons and their
[1:08:18] daughters were taken captive
[1:08:21] then david and his people that were with
[1:08:23] him lifted up their voices and wept and
[1:08:26] under them they had until they had no
[1:08:27] more power to weep
[1:08:30] that's quite a that's quite a time of
[1:08:31] crying
[1:08:34] and david's two wives were taken captive
[1:08:37] as well and david was greatly distressed
[1:08:40] for the people spake of stone in him
[1:08:45] because the soul of all the men were
[1:08:47] grieved every man for his sons and for
[1:08:49] his daughters
[1:08:50] but david encouraged himself in the lord
[1:08:53] his god
[1:08:57] amen and david said to abbathar the
[1:09:00] priest the himalayan son i pray thee
[1:09:02] bring hither the ephod
[1:09:04] and abbathar brought them the ephod to
[1:09:06] david and david inquired of the lord
[1:09:08] saying shall i pursue after this truth
[1:09:11] shall i overtake them and he answered
[1:09:13] them pursue
[1:09:15] and thou shalt overtake them and without
[1:09:18] fail recover all
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:26] without fail recover all
[1:09:30] it sounds like moses i'm not leaving a
[1:09:33] behind
[1:09:35] we're in another exodus we ought to have
[1:09:36] to say i'm not leaving my child behind
[1:09:39] i'm not leaving my sons and my daughters
[1:09:42] we're not leaving our god-given gifts
[1:09:44] behind
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:51] david and his band of soldiers had just
[1:09:53] returned home discouraged
[1:09:57] probably not a big enough word
[1:10:00] for their state of morale the bible says
[1:10:02] they wept as we read bitter tears
[1:10:05] until they simply had no power and even
[1:10:07] worse for david he was their leader
[1:10:10] and they started turning on david
[1:10:12] that's how that's how it works
[1:10:14] instead of turning on the enemy they
[1:10:16] start turning on their leader
[1:10:18] and make him out to be the enemy when he
[1:10:20] was never the enemy
[1:10:23] amen but david turned and encouraged
[1:10:26] himself in the lord his god
[1:10:29] it required a definite resolve in
[1:10:31] david's heart
[1:10:33] he had a decision to make am i going to
[1:10:36] go deeper into distress and depression
[1:10:38] will i worry more will i allow it to
[1:10:40] make me more helpless or would he make a
[1:10:43] conscious decision
[1:10:44] i'm going to turn my my eyes away from
[1:10:48] what's going on and i'm going to turn
[1:10:49] them to the hills which cometh my help
[1:10:53] david chose encouragement not to just be
[1:10:56] encouraged for there was no one around
[1:10:58] there that could or would encourage him
[1:11:00] he couldn't even courage himself
[1:11:03] he had to turn to the lord his god
[1:11:11] you see what david knows that this
[1:11:12] wasn't just about david
[1:11:15] david had a covenant with god
[1:11:18] and what and having that covenant with
[1:11:20] god it made what david was going through
[1:11:23] god's business
[1:11:27] after encouraging himself david was then
[1:11:29] able to move amen from the on to the
[1:11:32] solution that god had probably had
[1:11:34] provided see you'll never get to the
[1:11:37] solution of your problem unless you get
[1:11:39] your focus off your problem and get it
[1:11:42] on your god
[1:11:43] [Applause]
[1:11:47] amen discouragement does not come from
[1:11:49] the lord it comes from our adversary the
[1:11:51] devil that's why david could encourage
[1:11:54] himself in the lord because the lord was
[1:11:56] the source of his solution not the
[1:11:59] source of his problem
[1:12:02] but how quickly the devil wants to turn
[1:12:04] it and say god did you this way
[1:12:13] anxiety
[1:12:14] fretting
[1:12:16] worrying
[1:12:17] discouragement it indicates
[1:12:20] we're walking by sight
[1:12:22] and not by faith
[1:12:25] we're walking about what we can see
[1:12:27] instead of looking to the unseen
[1:12:31] let me let me read a few quotes here and
[1:12:33] discernment some there's tons of these
[1:12:35] go look them up crossing bridges
[1:12:37] worrying about things you ain't got no
[1:12:38] business to be look that up
[1:12:41] he said let us say praise be to god oh
[1:12:43] my this is what we need this is the time
[1:12:46] is this the patient how to do sister
[1:12:48] you're an awful deep thinker
[1:12:51] got a weary spirit
[1:12:54] always worried about things you've got
[1:12:56] no business to be worried about
[1:13:00] whoa that's going to the doctor ain't it
[1:13:03] yeah that's what the doctor said we'll
[1:13:04] just take this and take that
[1:13:06] now you what's your problem let's get to
[1:13:08] the problem
[1:13:11] amen see medicine sometimes just covers
[1:13:13] the symptoms that really don't deal with
[1:13:14] the problem god wants to deal with the
[1:13:16] problem and the symptoms will go away
[1:13:19] amen see you're always worried about
[1:13:22] things you got no business to be you're
[1:13:24] nervous upset and it's caused you to
[1:13:26] have acid in your blood which give you
[1:13:29] arthritis
[1:13:33] the devil did me this way no
[1:13:36] that she did that to herself
[1:13:39] she allowed things to become greater
[1:13:41] than what they really were
[1:13:43] she began crossing bridges before she
[1:13:45] ever got there now now i understand this
[1:13:47] is she but there's a bunch of hees too
[1:13:50] brothers we'd cross a lot of bridges how
[1:13:52] many has ever had something with another
[1:13:54] brother and you're going to go talk to
[1:13:55] him and you're going to talk to him
[1:13:56] about it and you begin to build this
[1:13:58] thing in your mind i'm going to say this
[1:14:00] and he's going to say that oh he better
[1:14:02] not say that
[1:14:04] man if he does i'm going to bring this
[1:14:06] out and then when i do that he's going
[1:14:08] to do that and you go there and you
[1:14:10] begin to talk to him and he don't even
[1:14:11] know what you're talking about
[1:14:16] crossing bridges
[1:14:18] discouragement nervousness he said come
[1:14:20] lady you're a very deep thinker you're
[1:14:22] sincere with all your heart but it's
[1:14:23] caused you to be a nervous person you're
[1:14:25] very nervous you're always taking other
[1:14:27] people's things
[1:14:29] and thinking about that crossing bridges
[1:14:32] before you get to it building things
[1:14:34] that never happen anyway in that it's
[1:14:37] developed a stomach trouble for
[1:14:40] you but paul said we want or to walk by
[1:14:44] faith and not by sight
[1:14:47] [Applause]
[1:14:49] amen that was his source of strength and
[1:14:51] source of stability amen when we walk by
[1:14:54] faith we're putting our confidence in
[1:14:56] the lord we're putting our confidence in
[1:14:58] his promises but when we walk by sight
[1:15:01] we trust in what our senses say what our
[1:15:03] feelings say what our understandings say
[1:15:06] and then we begin to fall easily pray to
[1:15:09] misunderstandings and the world the
[1:15:11] deceptions and the flesh and the devil
[1:15:15] when we find ourselves in discouragement
[1:15:17] we find where we've been placing our
[1:15:20] trust
[1:15:22] the answer is that you don't have to
[1:15:24] stay there
[1:15:25] hallelujah the answer is put your trust
[1:15:29] back in the lord
[1:15:31] when discouragement comes you find
[1:15:33] you've been walking by faith or by sight
[1:15:35] instead of faith head back to the word
[1:15:38] head back to what he said
[1:15:40] and begin to build your faith back up
[1:15:42] your strength god god wants you to be
[1:15:45] encouraged
[1:15:48] so if he wants you to be encouraged he
[1:15:50] has to give you the means to be
[1:15:52] encouraged by
[1:15:54] recognize first you don't have to stay
[1:15:56] discouraged
[1:15:59] some people like that they worship that
[1:16:01] discouragement spirit
[1:16:03] and they want to tell you why they're
[1:16:04] discouraged and 100 reasons why and this
[1:16:06] and that and they've got to list a mile
[1:16:07] long you don't have to stay there
[1:16:12] anybody you know brother i'm talking
[1:16:13] about a bird that flies over your head
[1:16:15] you can't keep that from happening but
[1:16:16] you sure make him quit building a nest
[1:16:19] in there
[1:16:20] but how many people have you saw them
[1:16:22] spiritually man they'd have twigs
[1:16:23] sticking out they'd have mud all over
[1:16:25] their hair
[1:16:27] or they may be fixed up and dolled up
[1:16:29] and their hair just right and we got the
[1:16:30] newest haircut but if you could look
[1:16:32] spiritually they got all kind of
[1:16:33] nonsense wadded up
[1:16:36] i can't even hardly walk through the
[1:16:37] doors because it's piled so high and
[1:16:39] they wonder why i ain't got nothing from
[1:16:41] god
[1:16:46] hey man bear with me we're going
[1:16:48] somewhere
[1:16:49] you can be encouraged
[1:16:51] but you have to encourage yourself in
[1:16:53] the lord
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:56] there's always going to be somebody that
[1:16:58] does something wrong
[1:17:00] there's always going to be somebody that
[1:17:02] makes a mistake
[1:17:05] whether it be a deacon trustee leader it
[1:17:07] don't my pastor it doesn't matter we're
[1:17:09] all human
[1:17:11] but the problem is the devil wants you
[1:17:13] to get your eyes off of your humanity
[1:17:15] and magnify their humanity
[1:17:18] [Applause]
[1:17:22] so when the circumstances of life
[1:17:24] present the david david turned and
[1:17:26] pressed into his benefits
[1:17:29] [Music]
[1:17:30] he gave an outline of our benefits in
[1:17:32] psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and
[1:17:36] forget not all his benefits who forgive
[1:17:38] all iniquities
[1:17:41] who heals all diseases
[1:17:43] who redeemed your life from destruction
[1:17:45] who crowns you
[1:17:50] oh if you can get the mud out of your
[1:17:52] hair and get all this stuff out god
[1:17:54] wants to crown you with loving kindness
[1:18:01] tend to mercies who satisfies your mouth
[1:18:03] with good things so that your youth is
[1:18:05] renewed like the eagles so you have to
[1:18:07] stop giving voice to your discouragement
[1:18:10] and start giving voice to your
[1:18:12] encouragement
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:15] stop repeating the lies of the devil and
[1:18:17] start speaking the promises of god
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:22] stop speaking out of fear and start
[1:18:24] speaking in faith
[1:18:27] stop talking about the problem and start
[1:18:29] talking about the promises
[1:18:32] [Applause]
[1:18:36] but the devil wants to put something on
[1:18:38] you that's not you
[1:18:41] amen he wants to place a name on you
[1:18:43] to cause you to sing his tune
[1:18:47] you know i thought it was interesting i
[1:18:49] was looking at this this morning
[1:18:51] nebuchadnezzar was the king of babylon
[1:18:55] and and he was
[1:18:56] you know we know the story daniel and
[1:18:58] the three hebrew children were taken
[1:19:00] down there had an eye michelle
[1:19:02] and azariah
[1:19:04] how many ever says those names when you
[1:19:06] say the three hebrew children
[1:19:08] chad wrack me shaq and abednego
[1:19:11] all four of these hebrews names had
[1:19:14] meanings
[1:19:15] of a and that meaning was a connected to
[1:19:18] the faith in god
[1:19:20] but upon their arrival into babylon
[1:19:22] their names were changed
[1:19:25] and daniel became belt of shazaar and
[1:19:27] had an eye of shadrach and michelle
[1:19:30] meshach and azariah abednego the boy's
[1:19:33] names were changed as a way of
[1:19:35] encouraging them to forget their god and
[1:19:39] the traditions of their homeland and be
[1:19:41] conformed to the ways and gods of
[1:19:43] babylon
[1:19:45] it was a forced assimilation
[1:19:50] this is where it's going to be you're
[1:19:51] going to take these names and they're
[1:19:53] going to conform to these names and what
[1:19:54] these names mean now david daniel and
[1:19:57] his friends were given names a bendigo
[1:19:59] meant sir a servant of nebo and belter
[1:20:01] chaz armen bell protects my life
[1:20:06] the meaning of the name daniel
[1:20:08] is god is my judge
[1:20:13] referring to elohim
[1:20:15] one of the names of the gods of israel
[1:20:17] amen azariah and hannah and i carry the
[1:20:20] suffix
[1:20:23] which is short for yahweh
[1:20:25] it is the covenant name of god
[1:20:28] see the devil wants to place a name on
[1:20:30] you so you'll sing his song
[1:20:33] so he places discouragement so you'll
[1:20:36] sing the song of discouragement
[1:20:38] he places anxiety upon your depression
[1:20:41] and you'll begin to sing that song out
[1:20:43] of your life
[1:20:46] oh yeah yeah it happens
[1:20:50] amen when songs
[1:20:52] of joy should be coming out and songs of
[1:20:54] happiness and songs of zion and songs of
[1:20:57] revelation and songs of our position and
[1:21:00] songs of our promises we're singing
[1:21:02] other songs
[1:21:05] he's changed our identity by changing
[1:21:08] who we are
[1:21:09] changing what's upon us
[1:21:14] so you come to the house of god and you
[1:21:16] start saying i'm depressed

[1:22:41] the realms of that and begin to sing
[1:22:43] those songs out of your life
[1:22:48] sing songs of unworthiness
[1:22:50] but instead of singing that you ought to
[1:22:52] be singing the song of the redeemed
[1:22:55] amen instead of singing songs of
[1:22:56] unforgiveness you ought to be singing i
[1:22:59] can forgive
[1:23:01] i can't let it go

[1:23:23] forgiveness you're going to receive
[1:23:28] when you get in a battle though it's
[1:23:30] easy
[1:23:31] it's easy to forget
[1:23:32] it's easy to forget to praise him you
[1:23:34] know our lives will be a praise offering
[1:23:36] unto him
[1:23:37] but then we become murmurs and
[1:23:39] complainers
[1:23:40] and i promise you i'm getting to the
[1:23:42] good stuff just hang on with me
[1:23:45] how quickly in the journey of the
[1:23:47] children of israel it turned from
[1:23:48] rejoicing and praising hallelujah
[1:23:52] hallelujah he set me free he set me free
[1:23:56] to complaining
[1:23:58] and murmuring
[1:24:00] and aggravated and not happy
[1:24:06] they forgot what god had done for them
[1:24:09] and he said that brother baby like they
[1:24:11] said people forget very quickly what god
[1:24:14] does for them in a meeting
[1:24:16] they forget of how he set them free or
[1:24:19] what he done them at a high school
[1:24:20] meeting or whatever our campaign if they
[1:24:22] forget all about it what god did they
[1:24:25] just forget it
[1:24:27] and they begin to murmur our souls
[1:24:30] loathed at this light bread and they
[1:24:32] left the garlics and onions of egypt and
[1:24:34] were eating angel's food
[1:24:40] complaining
[1:24:41] they left all of those things of
[1:24:44] the other people that didn't believe in
[1:24:46] divine healing
[1:24:47] and walking with the healer
[1:24:51] read the scriptures their souls didn't
[1:24:52] even wear out their clothes didn't even
[1:24:55] wear out he provided for him every step
[1:24:57] of the way
[1:24:59] what if he did it in that exodus don't
[1:25:00] you know he's going to do it in our
[1:25:02] exodus
[1:25:04] he hasn't got to lay over the sea and
[1:25:06] run out of power and run out of
[1:25:07] abilities and run out of creative power
[1:25:10] he's just as powerful today as he ever
[1:25:12] was
[1:25:14] amen he still takes care of his children
[1:25:17] just like he ever did
[1:25:22] here they were drinking brother
[1:25:23] babysitting from the stagnated pools of
[1:25:26] egypt and the old bloody nasty nile and
[1:25:29] drinking from the rock
[1:25:32] and complaining
[1:25:34] and murmuring
[1:25:35] and mad
[1:25:39] mercy
[1:25:42] complaining always
[1:25:45] murmuring left the garlic plots left the
[1:25:47] boasting physicians left the
[1:25:50] stale waters of egypt the days of
[1:25:52] miracles have passed to be where
[1:25:53] miracles were taking place and still
[1:25:55] complaining
[1:25:58] you know i i
[1:26:02] i'm not as old as i
[1:26:03] can be but i'm not as young as i used to
[1:26:05] be
[1:26:06] i'm halfway to 90.
[1:26:11] you start feeling things you didn't feel
[1:26:12] before
[1:26:16] like man what's going on
[1:26:18] what has happened how did i get here
[1:26:21] and i know these young guys like ha ha
[1:26:23] you'll be here
[1:26:27] lord terry's you're coming right along
[1:26:31] brother brandon would say when he come
[1:26:33] down
[1:26:34] he said in 63 he's just a couple of
[1:26:36] years from his passing over he said god
[1:26:39] give me grace
[1:26:40] to never complain
[1:26:43] amen grant that my life will be crowned
[1:26:45] no matter if we suffer whatever takes
[1:26:47] place however many turns against me
[1:26:50] i know this one thing in my life as i
[1:26:52] get older friends the stream behind me
[1:26:54] will soon be running out narrow and
[1:26:56] narrow as i go down the road
[1:26:58] and i know one thing it'll come to pass
[1:27:00] after a while there'll be nobody come to
[1:27:02] me and ask for advice
[1:27:04] the ones who knew me in my younger days
[1:27:06] will be going on if i shall live
[1:27:08] my friends will get fewer and fewer as i
[1:27:10] get older now i know that someday i'll
[1:27:12] go to i got to die
[1:27:14] and i hope that god never
[1:27:16] let satan crown me as an old crabit
[1:27:20] indifferent man and my wife an old
[1:27:22] nagging woman or your wife or you that
[1:27:24] way i pray brother that our lives will
[1:27:26] be crowned with the fruits of the spirit
[1:27:29] joy love long suffering gentleness
[1:27:33] patience true faith in the holy ghost
[1:27:40] he said i try not to say too much only
[1:27:42] about it you know people complaining
[1:27:43] because i think one of the horrible
[1:27:45] sayings i see a man or woman that's
[1:27:46] constantly complaining
[1:27:49] he said well i want a revival you're
[1:27:51] supposed to be preaching a revival stop
[1:27:53] complaining
[1:27:57] start
[1:27:58] rejoicing amen he said god keep me from
[1:28:02] it
[1:28:03] he said because it weakens faith i know
[1:28:06] as long as i get older each one of us
[1:28:08] we're going to get something now
[1:28:09] something's going to happen i know
[1:28:11] little things are going to keep
[1:28:12] accumulating as we get older i think one
[1:28:14] of the most horrible things is in life
[1:28:16] is for satan to crown some person's life
[1:28:19] a crabbing old man or a woman you say i
[1:28:21] hope that i don't ever get to that place
[1:28:23] i hope i can bear it my burdens i want
[1:28:26] my life to be crowned with the glory of
[1:28:28] god
[1:28:30] i want my life to be crowned with the
[1:28:33] glory of god
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:36] you know in the southern u.s maybe other
[1:28:38] elsewhere maybe you have it here we have
[1:28:40] a saiyan that goes like this as i bet
[1:28:43] he's singing a different tune now
[1:28:45] it's a context that somebody has had a
[1:28:48] radical event or a life-changing
[1:28:51] experience and because of this he acts
[1:28:54] different because of this life-altering
[1:28:57] event he can no longer sing the same
[1:29:00] song
[1:29:02] because it simply don't apply
[1:29:07] perhaps this is a new song and a way of
[1:29:09] saying i have had a life-changing
[1:29:11] experience with the creator of the
[1:29:14] entire universe so i can never
[1:29:18] never
[1:29:19] never remain the same i will sing a new
[1:29:23] song cause my life has been changed
[1:29:27] [Applause]

[1:31:32] fire into his presence and remain the
[1:31:35] same
[1:31:46] god changed the name of abram to abraham
[1:31:50] he changed sarah to sarah
[1:31:53] he put a part of himself
[1:31:56] in their name it was the h it was the
[1:31:59] breath
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:04] this is what he's wanting to do for you
[1:32:06] maybe you've been barren maybe your
[1:32:08] womb's been dead and you haven't been
[1:32:10] able to give life to the messiah inside
[1:32:12] of you listen i ain't talking about just

[1:32:21] somebody and say let me put my heart in
[1:32:24] you let me put my breath in here let me

[1:32:34] in a supplanter you've been a deceiver
[1:32:37] you've had bad business deals you've
[1:32:39] done all kinds of things wrong but god
[1:32:41] wants to come to you
[1:32:43] and you can have a moment with the angel
[1:32:46] and he can wrestle it out with you and i
[1:32:48] tell you when you get a hold of that
[1:32:49] angel you won't walk away the same
[1:32:57] what happened to you jacob i'm not jacob
[1:32:59] no more my name is israel i'm not
[1:33:02] surprised no more i'm not deceiver no
[1:33:05] more that's who i used to be but that
[1:33:07] old man has died i cross the river
[1:33:12] and i'm on the other side and i'm now a
[1:33:15] prince with god
[1:33:17] [Applause]
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:21] the devil wants to come say well you're
[1:33:22] depressed you're lost you're never going
[1:33:25] to make it your name is anxiety and fear
[1:33:28] and every kind of name of demon you want
[1:33:29] to know what you need to do is look back
[1:33:31] to him and say no that's not my name
[1:33:34] that's your name
[1:33:37] that's who you are that's not who i am i
[1:33:41] am a prince with god
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:34:03] he wants to put thoughts in your mind
[1:34:06] you're never going to make it
[1:34:08] you're not ever going to be good enough
[1:34:10] you're unworthy
[1:34:12] you're a liar
[1:34:14] you're a deceiver
[1:34:16] brother branham would use that it get
[1:34:18] asked a question he said how do we know
[1:34:19] if it's our thoughts or how do we know
[1:34:22] this he said if it's not the word of god
[1:34:24] it's the devil's thinking
[1:34:26] so i've read the bible i hadn't seen
[1:34:28] where he called me a liar where he
[1:34:30] called me i wasn't going to make it what
[1:34:32] he said so these are the devil's
[1:34:33] thoughts
[1:34:36] so let's hear what the devil's thinking
[1:34:37] this morning satan has got up this
[1:34:39] morning maybe fixed him something to eat
[1:34:41] or whatever down in his kingdom and his
[1:34:44] thoughts are going through his mind
[1:34:45] you'll never be worthy enough you're
[1:34:47] never going to make it you'll never be
[1:34:49] redeemed you'll never be there you'll
[1:34:52] never experience eternity you'll never
[1:34:54] experience the greatness of god these
[1:34:56] are his faults
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:00] but he's trying to say they're yours
[1:35:04] but these are the things that's
[1:35:05] antagonizing him
[1:35:08] and tormenting him
[1:35:13] saul
[1:35:15] brother branham said well maybe it was a
[1:35:16] good name for a king one time but it
[1:35:19] didn't fit an apostle
[1:35:22] so he met the pillar of fire
[1:35:24] and from that time his name was changed
[1:35:28] paul
[1:35:30] abraham was abram there's an ordinary
[1:35:32] man but one day he met god and from that
[1:35:35] time he was changed forever
[1:35:37] he believed something that he could not
[1:35:39] see he met god and he was changed
[1:35:42] moses amen met god on the backside of
[1:35:45] the desert and from that time he was a
[1:35:47] changed man his song was different
[1:35:51] he was back there singing the song of
[1:35:52] running and hiding and song of i'll
[1:35:55] never be anybody i don't care what my
[1:35:56] mama said it's impossible now i don't
[1:35:59] run my chance it's over with
[1:36:02] and all of a sudden he's walking down
[1:36:03] tending some sheep and he said what what
[1:36:06] is that
[1:36:07] that's that's odd
[1:36:09] that's a light no bush is on fire but
[1:36:12] it's not burning
[1:36:13] let me go check that out
[1:36:16] he walks up there and a voice speaks and
[1:36:19] he calls him by name
[1:36:22] moses
[1:36:24] now if the devil would have called him
[1:36:26] he'd say deceiver
[1:36:29] worthless
[1:36:31] you runner of god's plan
[1:36:34] but god spoke to him and called him by
[1:36:36] his name moses
[1:36:41] moses
[1:36:42] where what are you doing take off your
[1:36:44] shoes you're on holy ground and we know
[1:36:46] what happened he took from that moment
[1:36:48] he went got his wife and his donkey and
[1:36:49] his child and his rod and he went off to
[1:36:52] egypt
[1:36:54] that's quite a different song
[1:36:56] well you're now a song asking what are
[1:36:57] you doing moses i'm going down to egypt
[1:37:00] to take over
[1:37:01] i'm going to take back what is mine what
[1:37:04] is god's inheritance he's had him too
[1:37:07] long his time is over with
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:11] this is where david was i'm going back
[1:37:13] i'm inquired of the lord and he said go
[1:37:16] and take it back and you shall recover
[1:37:19] all
[1:37:24] hallelujah i'm looking at a people
[1:37:26] that's going to recover all the joy all
[1:37:29] the happiness all the holy ghost all the
[1:37:32] power of god
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:43] can i tell you tell your testimony
[1:37:46] very personal
[1:37:47] it was last june and my
[1:37:50] uh my time with my mom's

[1:38:24] you know do i go don't i go what i do
[1:38:26] what did not do
[1:38:27] and i was talking to brother tim about
[1:38:29] it he said well i feel we're at a red
[1:38:31] sea moment
[1:38:33] we're either going to turn around or
[1:38:35] we're going to speak and go forward
[1:38:38] so we spoke and went forward
[1:38:40] and as i'm taking off from shreveport my
[1:38:42] mom's going back in the hospital
[1:38:45] and you know in mind battles and things

[1:38:54] things are
[1:38:55] this i just got to be there so i'm there
[1:38:58] brother ron's we're ministering and on
[1:39:00] sunday morning i'm ministering on the
[1:39:02] god that answers
[1:39:05] and brother branham said god always
[1:39:07] answers
[1:39:08] he said but he answers many times in an
[1:39:10] unexpected place an unexpected time and
[1:39:13] unexpected way
[1:39:15] he said but you have to recognize it to
[1:39:17] be god
[1:39:20] and so i'm preaching along and preaching
[1:39:22] i got down to the part where the three
[1:39:24] hebrew children were being talked about
[1:39:26] to be thrown in the fire and i walk
[1:39:27] around brother ron's got a little round
[1:39:28] place in front of his pulpit and i walk
[1:39:30] around and i'm speaking about it and i
[1:39:32] said you know
[1:39:33] as they're
[1:39:34] being thrown into the fire and i'm
[1:39:36] beginning to just tell her how brother
[1:39:37] branham did about jesus and the angels
[1:39:39] looking or god and angel's looking over
[1:39:41] and uh he's telling about it and
[1:39:44] wormwood and gabriel and all those
[1:39:45] things
[1:39:47] and he said but
[1:39:48] god said this this
[1:39:50] this is you've been good angels but this
[1:39:52] is a job for me said to grab the east
[1:39:54] wind the west wind and zigzag a light
[1:39:57] and into the fire you went
[1:39:59] and i've been standing out here my my
[1:40:00] ipad is went black
[1:40:03] and i'm just speaking about these things
[1:40:05] and as i was beginning to and i said in
[1:40:07] the king and about that time i hear
[1:40:09] voice
[1:40:10] and i'm looking around i'm just like
[1:40:12] what what what what is this
[1:40:14] and i'm trying to figure out where it
[1:40:15] sounds like it's coming from out there
[1:40:17] but i realize it's coming from my ipad
[1:40:20] and brother ron and i i'd actually at
[1:40:22] that time i didn't have a watch on that
[1:40:23] could play it but you know somehow your
[1:40:25] watch sometimes can push play on stuff
[1:40:27] and things i didn't have that on i just
[1:40:29] closed out all my apps and brother ron's
[1:40:31] sitting at the back behind he saw as the
[1:40:33] ipad began to change it began to come
[1:40:35] and it pulls up the tapes and it pulls
[1:40:37] up a sermon and it pushes play
[1:40:40] and brother branham's voice begins to
[1:40:41] speak and he says my favorite of the
[1:40:43] hymns
[1:40:45] he talks about booth clipboard and how
[1:40:47] he wrote it in a cornfield and he sold
[1:40:50] the rights and things and he said he
[1:40:51] says my favorite of the hymns he said
[1:40:53] because it expresses the extreme deity
[1:40:56] especially in the time we're living in
[1:40:59] he said everybody wants to make him just
[1:41:01] a man or a prophet but he was more than
[1:41:03] that he was god
[1:41:06] and in the moment i didn't really catch
[1:41:08] what was going on i i was thinking of
[1:41:10] another song he may be referring to
[1:41:12] because he didn't mention the song by
[1:41:13] name and i go to the back office and i
[1:41:15] began to look up booth cleveland what
[1:41:17] did he write and i and i knew i should
[1:41:19] know but i couldn't come up with it and
[1:41:21] i pulled it up and it was down from his
[1:41:23] glory
[1:41:25] every living story
[1:41:26] my god and savior came and jesus was his
[1:41:30] name
[1:41:30] born in a manger to his oldest stranger
[1:41:33] a man of sorrows tears and hagger knee
[1:41:36] but oh how i love him
[1:41:39] oh how i adore him
[1:41:43] my breath my sunshine my all in all
[1:41:49] wow you're talking about a moment
[1:41:51] i'm beginning to thank god and praying

[1:42:07] come back out of the hospital and seem
[1:42:08] to be make maybe making some
[1:42:10] improvements and things and and then as

[1:42:16] back in the hospital and she don't come
[1:42:18] out again

[1:42:34] hadn't spoken about 18 hours to nobody
[1:42:36] wouldn't respond to nothing she'd look
[1:42:37] around but she wouldn't say anything and
[1:42:39] me and my father walked into the icu and
[1:42:41] i said and we prayed for her and and you
