Sister Patty Pettingale would like to thank the Lord for protecting Kayla and her dad on Saturday. They were hit broadside in a vehicle accident. Um, looks like Richard is being blamed wrongfully. Would appreciate the prayers of the saints. Amen. Thank you for your prayers. Hallelujah, brother Tom. You go. Hallelujah. [Music] Father, I stand in amazement with the grace of God within all of our lives this morning. &gt;&gt; If we went from individual to individual, Lord, each one of us would stand in amaze and awe, that God should love a sinner such as I. Turn our sorrow into bliss. And Father, we're just so grateful to be gathered this morning in the house of God. Turmoil on every hand, upheaval everywhere. But we got a place that we can run into, Lord, and let off the pressure this morning to lift up holy hands, to lift up our voices together to glorify your name, Lord, for it's worthy of all praise and glory. And we want to lift it up this morning, Lord. We want to be united in worship. Glorify you, the living God. And would the lamb come forth once again and walk through the praise of your people this morning as we give you glory and honor as we lift up that holy name of Jesus Christ. Father, for those that are in need this morning, may you come on the scene. How often you've come in an unexpected way. When Moses was walking in a desert experience, but God, there was a burning bush standing there to awaken. Lord, everything that he has need of this morning. And that morning, Lord God, you quicken his life. And I pray, God, that that same pillar of fire would come in a special way and illuminate our hearts, Lord, and glorify you for you're worthy of all praise. You gave him a commission, Lord, and he was faithful to that commission. And he was not disobedient to that heavenly vision. And so Lord, we don't want to be disobedient to a heavenly vision that there would a be a bride that would stand victorious. A church Lord that can bind and a church that can loose. We want to stand in that vision this morning for our dear brother Jim. Lord, we want to stand with the power of loosing and that power of binding. we bind the enemy that you would loose the son of God, Lord Jesus, that you would heal him and strengthen him and let the great physician come on the scene this morning that there are a people that can believe in the power of your resurrection. Father God, if you should go by the way of an operation, you know all things, but you are the great physician that now is here. And Father, we pray God that your grace will go before him. strengthen him, heal him, and raise him up for the glory of God. We indeed do love him as a brother and pray, God, that your grace would ever rest upon him. &gt;&gt; Father, we are indeed thankful for Sister Kayla. Lord, you watched over her. &gt;&gt; Father Richard in this accident, Lord, we know all things work to the good. So, we pray that you will turn this situation around and be glorified through it. We pray. And then Lord for the many needs that are here in the house of God. I pray Lord that the Holy Spirit that is present now will minister deeply Lord not only to the body but deep to the soul. Ignite us Lord by the power of your presence. Lord anoint our pastor in a special way and let that word flow out of him. For out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. Lord, we're thirsty this morning and we want to drink, but we want to drink deeply, Lord. So, anoint the men of God. Anoint us, Lord. Prepare our hearts now. We pray. Father, take the remainder of this service into your divine care now. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Why don't you turn around and shake hands with somebody near you? Amen. And it's good to see everybody this morning. You may have your seats as you greet one another. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. We want to greet everyone in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Those on the telephone and the internet hookup. We want to say God bless you to you as well. We trust that it's just a real wonderful day. It's the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to have a day that's set aside. You don't have to have appointments. you don't have to be worried about uh the afternoon or what's supposed to take place because it's the Lord's schedule. It's just nice to have that opportunity. We do have a couple of announcements. Did uh did Ryan make it? Is Brianna ready? All right. Well, if they are here and ready, then uh we'll just have a special for you this morning. But as they're getting ready, do have a couple of announcements. Leah and Simeon Iverson in Belgium are happy to announce the birth of their son, Matio Adriel. I'm probably not saying that with enough accent. Born Saturday, July 23rd, weighing 8 lbs. So, we're all happy for &gt;&gt; Leah. Amen. We have a counselor meeting after the service for everyone that um has been contacted. We're real happy for everybody that's shown interest in being at the camp. It's absolutely full to the brim, every available space. And uh bring your own cot if you didn't get a confirmation on a bed cuz you'll probably need it. Praise the Lord. So that's right after the service this morning, this afternoon, um whatever time the service gets over, there will be a meeting in the chapel. Amen. We don't want to put any time restraints on our pastor this morning. I trust that the Lord will come and meet us in a special way once again today. Why don't we sing I will restore saith the Lord. Number 301 on the screen. I will restore [Music] the Lord. I will restore the Lord. Jehovah promise the Holy Ghost promise. I will restore. Thus sayeth the Lord. I will restore. Thus say the Lord.

Let's sing Only Believe. Only believe as Brother Ed comes. Want to remember brother Ken Andes will be ministering down in Seattle this evening to the saints down there. Laboring in the body. Is it a body of believers? Mystical body of Jesus Christ. Amen. I was just listening to communion yesterday. Brother Brandham was ministering on discerning the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; And he was teaching the brother. He said, "Many of you here maybe don't even take communion because you don't really understand." and he started talking about discerning the Lord's body. And it struck me because it's not the body on the cross that you're not discerning. It's the Lord's body. &gt;&gt; It's the body of believers. He's the head, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to terry one for another. Amen. I think if we come into that attitude in that atmosphere this morning, he'll come behind his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray for our pastor this morning as he comes. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. [Music] Only believe. [Music] Only believe. Only believe all things are possible.

Not just some Jehovah God way up there, &gt;&gt; but here. &gt;&gt; My comforter. Let's sing it once again as we just prepare our hearts for the word. Lord, I lift your name. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh my [Music] go. [Music] Let's just join together in prayer. Fathers were coming to you, the only true and living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is none beside you. You do things the way you wish to do them. &gt;&gt; You do things that will please you. And we're asking you to come take control of every thought, of every spirit, of every human spirit. Take it under control. Your sovereign supreme control by the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ. Pray you'll bring every thought in subjection. All of those that are streaming today and will ever hear this service. I pray, oh God, that you will take your word by the Holy Ghost and bring it right to the very core of our hearts, oh God, to our soul. Father, may there be a liberating power to any that are bound. May there be a healing power to those that are diseased and sick. May there be a spiritual revelation to those who have not had the word yet revealed to them. And may it be edifying to every son and daughter of God in the holy name of Jesus Christ. How we thank you for the saints that have gathered this morning. Lord, they are your children, your family, and we just pray you will bless the bride of Jesus Christ wherever she may be at this moment. every member, &gt;&gt; for everyone is precious to you. And now, Lord, I pray that you will give me a special portion that I may speak with clarity and that give the people attentive hearts, Father, that they may just grasp, oh God, uh what what it is you desire them to know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we want to greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ where I just got an email from brother Steven Ibali uh from Uganda and he wanted me to convey to you all of those that have prayed for him because right after he left here he had to have an operation and he just uh sent an email to let us know that he's been uh he's been discharged from the hospital and he's home now and please convey my thanks to you, his thanks to you. Uh so we're and I sent him one back said we're glad he's back and we're we hope that he'll regain his full strength right away quick. They have a lot to do in that country, but since he's been here, he felt very very close to the people and and he's probably sent me a half a dozen or more emails since leaving. Brother Ken Andes is going to be ministering in Seattle this afternoon. We're happy for that for those of you down in Seattle area. And uh we'd encourage you to be to the service. Uh since they have that new location, it's really wonderful. I have a lot of a lot of enthusiasm about about what God wants to do in Seattle as well at this time. And I noticed they had an announcement, I guess, regarding Sister Leah Iverson. I the reason I just mentioned her is I I she was uh carrying this child just when we were in Switzerland and I turned around on one occasion and I just look she was just standing all the people are sitting but she's standing and she's running the projector for all the songs on the screen and as far along as she was just a short time from having birth I just thought in my heart God bless Sister Leo standing there faithful in every service to a day and running that uh uh running the song. I I believe that God sees all of those things, doesn't he? Amen. I'll have you turn in your Bibles to the word of God. We're going to read out of John first chapter. And this may be a little bit different kind of a service, but uh you might want to have a pencil or pen handy, piece of paper to make a note. And uh because sometimes it's in not sometimes, but every time a person stands here, at least for myself, you've spent maybe days, maybe weeks pondering a certain thing. And it may tie into something that you have that God has been uh expanding in your own understanding over a period of perhaps months or years and then you're trying to you know bring it down into a vortex of of thought and a few words to bring it to the people and it's just very very difficult. So you pray that God will help me and help you and to receive something that'll be eternally bene beneficial for you. Uh uh we'll read in John the 1st chapter and starting at verse 6 down to 12. There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light. &gt;&gt; That all men through him might believe. He was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of that light. &gt;&gt; He was the true light. That was the true light, which lightth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he the power or power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. In John the 14th chapter, if you'll just turn over a few pages, we'll read verses just 1 to three. Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. Amen. God bless his word as you have your seats. kind of a simple subject, strange subject and this will be the core of the thought I want to speak on receiving him. Now that might sound very very simple but before we get very far you'll find that the the word receiving in the scripture there are there are 19 different Greek words that have and and and refer to and reflect different aspects of uh of this receiving. regarding Jesus Christ himself, there's always been so many opinions. I mean, even from the days that he was here walking in the flesh. And it's it's something for us to sit here this morning, we perhaps would think, oh, if I had been back then, uh, it would have been different. Well, of course, that's what the we don't want to say what the scribes and Pharisees said. That's what they said. If we'd have been back then in the time of our fathers, we wouldn't have slew. we wouldn't have killed or slew slew the prophets. And then Jesus said, "Well, you're the sons. You're the children of the prophets. I children rather of those that killed the prophets." And so it's it's always easy for people to say, "Well, if I'd been back then, it would have been different." But here we are today and we have to put ourselves in the in the scenario of the scripture. And uh some of them at the time of Jesus and I was reading earlier they had the they had the thoughts and the opinions and the opinions I I want to project this in a few moments said he's a good man. Others said he's a prophet. Some said he's a a a great teacher. He's a rabbi. And uh and and others said well he deceives the people. He's a deceiver. And uh and the religious people even called him Bzeub and uh others said at the time of his crucifixion he stirth up the people. So these were all the different uh opinions of the people and and it's not just that people have different thoughts about something but those thoughts then are projected within the individual to how they would receive this person. And I can tell you that all of those opinions which I have described right now did not receive eternal life. They didn't project the people to having faith and believing in Christ. And so their opinions are very important in our time. If you were to read the titles of the messages with this type of ministry that God sent us and you begin to have uh read titles, who do you say this is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is this? Who is this Melzdc? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What will you do with this Jesus called Christ? You don't have to go over very many of the titles before you come to realize this is not merely a different ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This isn't ministry of people comparing one ministry with another. And it it it actually comes down into this congregation this morning. You know, what will you do with this Jesus called Christ? In other words, what is our opinion of this message? uh is it indeed Christ and if it is Christ uh what does that mean to us and so I want to take it from that uh from that direction uh there's many references as I said a moment ago and applications in the in the scripture and it will help you if I take the first part of the service to to so that you can see how the author who the Holy Spirit is the author. Isn't that correct? The Holy Spirit's the author of the word. So if we can get into the mind of the author &gt;&gt; and see how the word how the how the scripture was structured and and how God looks upon how he was received or what or how he was rejected. It will help us to be able to uh apply it to ourselves to our own life to our own uh our own environment even within our own church. And that's what we're concerned about. There's different events in the Bible, different happenings, different things that took place that involved the receiving where receiving is used. And I might just put it this way real quick. Uh that the ultimate of receiving really takes place when a young man or a man and a woman stand for marriage. And then do you take this man? Not do you just take this man or do you take this woman, but do you take them to be your lawful wed husband or wife? And now we've come to almost like a a supreme aspect of receiving. You're not uh they're not a boyfriend or a girlfriend anymore. We're not in a courtship relationship anymore. We are here to consummate our our love for one another. And we're here to declare, I take this man as my head. I take him as my husband. And and uh you'll have to have a lot of grace as you listen to me this morning because I want to state things that you know, but sometimes aren't very easy to apply. And that is that the spirit of this whole age and this is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Correct? &gt;&gt; Satan's Eden. Well, if you go back to Eden, the first thing he did was displace the headship. &gt;&gt; And I want everybody and especially the sisters. I know that some sisters sometimes feel as though they're they're squeezed or what pressured in within the message, but not if you receive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you just receive it and husbands must receive it because a lot of times in the husband we say about the wives and the women within this age but many times women are taking the responsibility they're taking because husbands aren't taking it. &gt;&gt; And so there's responsibility on both sides. Husbands are responsible before God to show to display to express to manifest headship &gt;&gt; leadership spiritual leadership that's our responsibility and I often find where women have have you know forged forward they have the hunger for God they have the drive they have the uh you know just a It it seems like such a spiritual thirst after God many times and I'll find a husband more laxidasical about those things. He's occupied with other other things uh that are responsibilities of life and the care and the burdens of the home and so on so forth. And somehow the thing just become it becomes skewed. It becomes just out of out of whack a wee bit. And uh so you can say amen when you want to. I'm not interested in how you say amen or whatever more, but these happen to be the facts in this generation. And that's what happened in Eden. And what happened in Eden in the way of seeds will be in the end time in the way of a harvest. And we I want to say to the congregation, every believer of the message that identifies themselves with the message, let us let us uh vow to ourselves that we are not going to be tainted with the spirit of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this is something that is so prevalent in the world and we don't want that to creep into uh our ranks. We don't want it to creep into our thinking. And we want to be able to number one let the husbands take the responsibility for headship. And when uh when when we receive one another as as husbands and wives, then we want to have God's ordained plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's ordained plan for our home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's not where I'm going necessarily, but that is what I want to uh I I want to it it's a big part of the of the service. Now, just to talk about the different degrees or different layers of of receiving, you can have someone come to your door and they might be a might be a neighbor. They might be a stranger and they'll say, "Well, I'd like to, you know, I just want to speak to you about something, you know, of common interest." Oh, well, well, come in. So, you receive them. But then maybe the next time someone comes, it's a family member. Oh, hi. Come on in. Sit down. You know what I mean? So it's a different kind of a reception simply because the person you are seeing you have a different relationship with them. It could be a friend, it could be someone else. And so there's there's that kind of of reception there to receive a a relative or a friend or a guest. We may be given something. Someone comes and says, "Well, I'd like to give you this gift. Uh I I have a special reason. there's a special purpose or intent behind it. I want to give you this. What what do you do? You receive it and you receive it at you should receive it at the level that it's being given to you. Uh it's it's not just uh something that's idle. And uh the Bible says as many as received him. Now there's people who received him as a great teacher. But the Bible says as many as received him to them gave he power. As many as received him, so the degree of reception. &gt;&gt; Uh uh that that was that's what what initiated on God's part what he gave. &gt;&gt; And so they received at a certain level. &gt;&gt; And I'm interested in that level. I've been pondering this a long time, friends, because I see there's people who come into the message and whoa, it's a wonderful message and maybe they're new things they had never heard before. That does not create within God a desire to give you power to become sons of God. As many as received him, received him how? Received him for what he was? Received him as the thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. They received him as something more than a man, more than a rabbi, more than a good teacher, more than someone who could heal me when I'm sick and make me happy when I'm sad and loose me when I feel bound and take the depression away and be a company of people that I can fellowship with. It's more than that, friends. &gt;&gt; This message is more than that. This message is him. As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God. This is not merely a church. This is not merely an association of people. This is not just a place where we come and have fellowship. As many as received him, you have to see him in this congregation. You have to see him in the message. You have to see him. And then when you see him and receive him, then you receive power to become sons of God &gt;&gt; and daughters of God. when you're a son and a daughter of God. I have never questioned my identity as a as a son of Fred Biscll. I've never questioned that. There isn't enough There isn't enough that can happen in life to cause me to even have that thought. &gt;&gt; I've never questioned that I'm a son of my father and my mother. I have since I've been a child that thought has never entered my mind. Then if we have been born of the spirit of God, how can it ever enter our mind? Am I a son or am I not a son? Am I a son or am I saved or am I not saved? Once you're born of the spirit of God, that's gone. &gt;&gt; I say it clearly, that's gone. It's gone forever. &gt;&gt; You never come to that place again. Right. &gt;&gt; And if you're coming to that place, then there's something wrong with the receiving. &gt;&gt; There's all kinds of voices going through this room. The prophet says, all kinds of voices going through this room right now. And you don't hear them because you haven't got the faculty, the facility to hear them, even though you have ears. But if you had what brother Brandon calls it a crystal and they call it a receiver, a receiving set. If you had a receiving set, the right kind of receiving set, then you'll have you'll have various voices that will come and if you have a selector on there, you'll be able to even select which channel it is or what voice it is and whether you want to hear it or don't want to hear it because it's a receiving set. And as sons and daughters of God, we talk about the predestinated seed of God. If we've been predestinated, then you have a receiving set. &gt;&gt; God can't uh predestinate a son or daughter to himself into his family and then fail to give them the receiving set. You have a receiving set. Every son and daughter of God, everyone has a receiving set &gt;&gt; and it's there to receive him. to identify him, &gt;&gt; to know who he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us we love him because he first loved us. That's 1 John 4 and 19. So the act of receiving him entitles a person and gives that person access to the power of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a number of words and I'm going to just go over these if you will give me your attention. I'm going to put them on the screen and uh I want to move as as quickly as I can. So, now if we can perhaps just dim the lights a wee bit. These just happen to be the words that are used in the scripture in the in the Greek and they all have to do with receiving. This is the root word lambeno. And uh lambeno is is essentially to receive or to take with the hand to lay hold of to take what is one's own to take of oneself. Uh to make one's own. So it's something you lay hold of. You take it because it's yours. You take it to make it yours. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says, "As many as received him, Lambeno, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name." Uh second word now which I will deal with is perileno which is to receive from another. I'll give you some examples now. to take or it signifies to receive to take with oneself to join to oneself an associate a companion or to accept or acknowledge one to be such as he professes to be. Now when one comes just think now deeply before you read on. If one comes and they profess to be as Jesus did, the son of man, this if if they if they were receiving him at this level, they would receive him at the level that he professes to be. He's the son of man, the son of God, fulfilling, who art thou, John? I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness. If they received him at the level of peril lambeno, then they received them as he says he is. &gt;&gt; He came unto his own and his own received him. Not perileno. They did not receive him. Now paraleno is not in the negative. It's it's just simply saying that they didn't want to become an associate of him. They didn't receive him for what he said he was. &gt;&gt; He did. They didn't believe that the scriptures that were brought forward were referring to him. So, they didn't receive him. They received him not. His own were not willing to accept or acknowledge him as he professed to be. Then Jesus said, "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself and receive you unto myself." Now this is in the positive sense. He's not rejecting them. He's receiving. I will come again and receive you unto myself. Now I just I'm I'm jumping way ahead of myself here so that you will see where I'm going. When Jesus said, "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again." I personally, and I I I don't I won't be in my lifetime apologizing over this. I am I've been thoroughly convinced for a very long time that his that Christ came in this message in word form and this was the scripture. &gt;&gt; He came. I can find no other purpose for him to have sent such a vindicated ministry that would say over all of these years that's not me. That's him. &gt;&gt; And he's here doing these things. &gt;&gt; That's that that was my voice, but that's not me speaking. &gt;&gt; I cannot disassociate those two this scripture from that. I will come again. And because what was he doing in this ministry? He was receiving a people. He was calling out a people that he declared through that voice that he had control of as a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So now this is bride time. &gt;&gt; This is not just an association. This is not just a church. And that's why the messenger the messenger had to scream. This is not a denomination. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just that he was anti-denominationalism. He had to cut the people free of that denominational thought. This is not a church. This is not a denomination. This is not just a fellowship of believers. This is a bridegroom speaking &gt;&gt; and this is a bridegroom calling for his bride because this has to be the ultimate receiving of one another. In other words, the people who are called as a bride say, "I receive you. &gt;&gt; You are my head. &gt;&gt; What you say, I do. &gt;&gt; What you say, I don't question. &gt;&gt; I am going to be your wife. &gt;&gt; I'm going to marry you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you receive at that level, the questions are gone. &gt;&gt; Well, did he really mean that? You haven't come to be wife yet. Or if you're wife, you you you need to get, you know, you need to get f more f fully convinced. &gt;&gt; So I go to prepare a place and I will come again and receive you. Uh perilano, I will receive you that where I am there ye may be also. I will receive you. Perilano, I will receive you for what you profess to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say that you are a believer &gt;&gt; and I accept that &gt;&gt; he understand the prophet standing there and person coming and saying do you believe that this is him? Do you believe that I'm God's servant? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They said yes. He say God bless you. &gt;&gt; What did he doing? He is a messenger is receiving that individual's profession, their confession of what they say. I believe &gt;&gt; brother Derek was led to have you sing Lord I believe only believe and that is really supreme. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will be uh taking these first two slides and uh uh speaking more about this. Now slide this next one is Anna Lambeno is to take up to take to oneself to receive. Now these may sound these may sound like they're the same. They're not the same because to take up. So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up. He was taken up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God. This is not receiving of someone. Now he's he's being received up into heaven and taken up into and then the scripture says in Acts 1:2 until the day in which he was taken up analano after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen. And then we can go here. This is this continues on with scriptures for Anna Lambano. And while they looked steadfastly towards heaven, he was as he went up, behold, two men uh stood by them in white raignment. And and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, this is the same thing which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?" This same Jesus which is taken and the word taken is analano. He's taken up. He's taken from you but he's being received at a different level. &gt;&gt; He's taken up from you into heaven and so shall come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven. &gt;&gt; And then we have apple lambano is to receive from another. I'm simply going through these. As I said there's 19. I'm just going through a few to see the different levels and different aspects of of being received or or how how the reception is taken place. And analo is to receive from another. And uh Luke 16:25, but Abraham said, "Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest you received from another." didn't say who it was in this case. But you receivest thy good things. Perapano the good things and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted and thou art tormented. Luke again 23:41. And we indeed justly the thief on the cross saying to the other thief, we indeed justly for we receive. They receive from another. They receive from someone else. They receive from the court. They receive from the people. We justly receive the due reward of our deeds. But this man hath done nothing a miss. So it has a different application. It's a different event. Colossians now knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of of the inheritance. See one who receives an inheritance, you didn't necessarily work for that inheritance. You didn't earn that inheritance. It's not wages you received. It's something that's given you from another. And how thankful I am that there are many scriptures that apply. We have received an inheritance. We didn't earn this scripture. We didn't earn this word of God. We didn't earn Malachi 4. We didn't earn this revelation. It's been given to us. And in the name of Jesus Christ, I want you to say, "And I receive it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I receive it in the in the very depth of the giver. &gt;&gt; He who gave it, he gave it freely. I receive it freely. That's why we don't have a church where we do all kinds of works and things trying to earn it. We can't earn it. It's our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't it wonderful? Pro lamb lambo is to take to oneself. Now it's not the giving. It is to take to oneself or to receive suggesting a welcome. A welcome in this case. Romans 15:7. Wherefore receive ye one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God. So now this isn't just a relationship between you and God. This is how we receive one another. &gt;&gt; We may have a pure heart towards God and say, "Oh, I I I know I can't earn it. I know this is a free gift. I know that you've given it and I receive it and I know that this message is none other than Jesus Christ." We can have all of that in place. But now the same scriptures tell us that we have a welcoming spirit to one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then we receive those that Christ has received. We welcome those that Christ died for this person sitting beside me. Hallelujah. And if Christ died for them, how shall I receive them? I receive you as a brother, as a sister in Christ. Indeed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that changes the relationship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter about their background or where they come from. Some come from a good home. Some come from a bad home. Some come from this country. Some come from another country. That has nothing to do with it. Jesus Christ has received them &gt;&gt; and they have received him. &gt;&gt; And we receive one another. &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, that's a great secret, friends, that we'll not be able to we'll not be able to really plum the depths of it here. It's a great mystery. If a church could come to the place of oneness and unity and love, Amen. &gt;&gt; And we can love one another as Christ loved us. &gt;&gt; You'll have a different church. &gt;&gt; You won't have the Cloverdale Bible way we're sitting in today. You'll have a different church. &gt;&gt; You won't have the atmosphere of the world. I live in my little corner. You live in your little corner. We never pass only in the in in in the church aisle. No, it's not that way. We we can chew the same gum. &gt;&gt; Have fellowship. Glory. &gt;&gt; Not fellowship at the level of the world where we just eat together and drink together, but fellowship. &gt;&gt; Come over to my home and take your shoes off and help yourself to the fridge. And &gt;&gt; you want to be careful if it's just a bunch of young men that helping themselves to the fridge. &gt;&gt; But you get my point. Metal lambeno. It's to make a partner, to be made a partner, to partake of something as in food of a uh or of a thing. In Acts 2 and 46, and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart. &gt;&gt; They were continuing daily from in one accord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 1 Timothy 2:6 says, "The husbandman that labor must first be partaker of the fruits." He must be a partaker. He must receive. He must receive the the husbandman or in this case I'll say even the minister the preacher before I can come here and seek to give out for you to receive. I first have to had to receive it. &gt;&gt; I have to labor and sometimes I can guarantee you labor a lot more than you're laboring to receive it. I have to labor and how how can I convey this? and and and I just begin. You know how it starts with the minister just to receive, receive, receive, receive. Yeah, I received him. And as many as received him. That's the first one that came. The other one, the second one that came was, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." Not, "Would you like it?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not this is an option. &gt;&gt; Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you receive the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you don't go on wondering all the rest of your life, have I got it? Haven't I got it? I wonder, do I have it? Things are going bad. I must not have it. &gt;&gt; I feel real low. I mustn't have it. The scripture says this. The scripture says this. &gt;&gt; Repent. &gt;&gt; Have you repented? &gt;&gt; And be baptized. Have you been baptized? You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's not my word. That's his word. That's not just printed in a book. That's God said that. &gt;&gt; You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the husbandman, he must first he labors in the word and and and these things don't come easy. This isn't something that, you know, that I put together or whatever more. I have to let God deal &gt;&gt; with my own heart. &gt;&gt; And I have to see these things and receive them &gt;&gt; as having come from God. Didn't come from a textbook. Didn't come from a school of theology. Didn't come from a Bible school. If there's anything I refer to, I will refer to what the prophet of God, a vindicated word, has said on these various subjects. And I receive that. &gt;&gt; So we can come here and give it and yet you can receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Metal Lambeno. Another scripture that refers to that which isn't on the screen. For the earth which drinkketh in the rain that cometh loft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs, meat for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God. The earth receives blessing from didn't earn it, doesn't know anything, doesn't have the knowledge we have about it, but it receives uh it receives metal lambeno. And then there's hupo lambeno. I can't say that I'm saying all of these exactly right, but you have grace. It is to take or to bear up, which is from the hupo part. That's from under to receive is rendered received as in Acts 1 and9. And when they had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. And then here's a one that I won't try to to pronounce too much, but this is the third one that I want to emphasize. Lambeno uh paraleno and then this one here deca oh deca oh is to receive by deliberate and ready reception of what is offered. &gt;&gt; You don't try and adjust what is being offered. You don't try to remanufacture it. You don't try to redesign it. You accept and you receive it by a deliberate and ready reception of what is offered. And uh whosoever shall not receive you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city. Shake off the dust off your feet. He that receiveth you receiveth me. &gt;&gt; And this is deci. He that receiveth you receiveth you with a deliberate and ready reception receiveth me. And he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. &gt;&gt; This is a direct link to almighty God. You know when you hear something over the pulpit it really becomes serious in this light in the light of this scripture. &gt;&gt; Is this God or is it a man? Is it something that was taken up out of you know some thoughts or some personal convictions or whatever more and perhaps there is those I I don't say that everything that comes over the pulpit is you know divinely orchestrated from almighty god I can't say that but I can tell you that I need to have confidence and you certainly need to have confidence of men who stand behind the pull pit you have to have absolute confidence you know why I'm preaching This &gt;&gt; one of the plagues &gt;&gt; in the message today is that they're not receiving him who sent that message. &gt;&gt; They are not receiving it in the fullness. Think, well, they put a question out. You know, what is there? What what is your absolute? My absolute, I'll tell you what, some say, well, that was just Brother Brandham's opinion. I sooner have his opinion than someone else's uh what they think is their doctrine. &gt;&gt; Somebody who God &gt;&gt; God knows when he stand up and say, "I'm going to go fishing." Well, praise God. God's happy that he's going fishing, he's going to talk to him out there. &gt;&gt; He said they even, you know, he had people that would uh uh discredit him because he go, "What's he doing going hunting?" Hey, it was while he was hunting that I got the revelation. It was while he was hunting, Brother Bud Southwick was born again. And that's worth 10,000 worlds. And Jesus Christ died for that man and is sending his messenger to get one man. I'm glad he came my way. I'm glad he came your way. And as a congregation, let's rejoice by saying, "And I receive him. I receive it. &gt;&gt; I receive it in the spirit. It was given. &gt;&gt; I receive it in the spirit of the giver. &gt;&gt; And when we get something in the message and we feel kind of squeezed and we feel kind of squirmed and we try to want to figure a way around it, stop right there. &gt;&gt; Remember that's our husband. That's our husband. &gt;&gt; You know I the word headship if you brothers and sisters you have a search program you'll find that the word headship is in I think 32 paragraphs some paragraphs he uses the word a number of times in just one paragraph. headship. If you have received him for who he is &gt;&gt; and you say this is the living Christ, he revealed himself. What did he reveal himself? He revealed himself as our husband. &gt;&gt; Not just our bridegroom but our husband. And that is why when when the prophet came towards the end of his ministry and one of the most outstanding of all messages is Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; And when he becomes revealed then we understand and brother Brandham uses the word headship 16 times in that service in that one service. not 16 paragraphs but 16 times he uses the word and I think about 11 paragraphs out of 32 in the entire ministry of his entire entire ministry over all of these years from 47 we have recorded to 65 he uses the word headship in I think 32 paragraphs and 16 or or 11 of those paragraphs are in in Christ as the mystery of God revealed. Go home and read that and every time you hit headship, just highlight it. &gt;&gt; What's he doing &gt;&gt; before he sends a messenger away to his reward? He wants to let the bride know headship has returned. &gt;&gt; I'm going to prepare a place. He's going to prepare a place for his bride. He's going to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place, I will come again. But he doesn't come back as the lowly Nazarene. He doesn't come back to carry a cross to Calvary. He comes back as husband. And that's why the prophet talks about the son of the rancher, the man that has the great ranch in Chicago. He doesn't come down there to clean the barns. He comes down there looking for a wife. And he's coming down looking for character. &gt;&gt; You may not have a lot of things in this world. I might not have mental retention. I may not have a whole lot of character, a whole lot of things. But one thing we have is we have the kind of character he's looking for. He just wants somebody to believe him. &gt;&gt; He just wants somebody to love him. &gt;&gt; And he that hears you &gt;&gt; hears me. And he that hears me hears my father. You have a direct link with God Almighty. That's not my words. That's his words. &gt;&gt; That's the Bible. &gt;&gt; And you are living in the era of headship. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet came with church order. He came with church order because he was speaking on behalf of the head of the church. &gt;&gt; To the church. &gt;&gt; Headship. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why he talked about the home, &gt;&gt; the family. &gt;&gt; Headship. &gt;&gt; Children, your father and mother is headship. &gt;&gt; And to the wife, your husband is headship. And to you husbands, let it be a revelation. That's a serious and a very deep responsibility. Headship. &gt;&gt; I'm responsible to give an example to these children that God has. I'm responsible to give a spiritual example to my wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We all fail, &gt;&gt; but we want to be remembered for the main things. My wife said to me this last week and she doesn't know I'm going to say this and it's not going to embarrassment to her because we fail in a lot of things. We may fail as husbands, as men, as a brother, as a father. If I could go back and relive my life as a father, I'd probably do a lot of things different. And so would all of us. &gt;&gt; And there'd be little spots that we'd erase out. &gt;&gt; And as husbands, &gt;&gt; as men, as brother in the church, &gt;&gt; as a minister, there'd be all kinds of things we'd like to rearrange and change, but we want to be remembered for the main thing. Yes. &gt;&gt; My wife said one thing about you. She said you have always loved the word of God. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, all I want now I now she said that now when one day all I want to do is hear hear whatever language or whatever sound it is or whatever what whatever however it is in eternity or in the millennium. I want to hear his words. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you have always loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I showed myself to you, &gt;&gt; you loved me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You maybe fell, maybe you did something wrong, you said something wrong, but you loved me. &gt;&gt; And that's what counts. [Music] Yes, sir. This is following along the same on the same same word. He that receiveth a prophet, he that dec he that receiveth a prophet &gt;&gt; in the name of a prophet &gt;&gt; shall receive a prophet's reward. &gt;&gt; And he that receiveth a righteous man &gt;&gt; in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. Think of it friends. Somebody just receives a righteous man in and and at this level they receive it with a deliberate and uh a ready reception &gt;&gt; of what is being offered. And maybe maybe the man isn't preaching a message but he's just living a life. And I've used this example before and allow me just to use I've used it mostly in private conversation. But perhaps one man because brother Vanom says in the church ages he says that there will be some who will receive eternal life because they've been good to the bride. I had I had a lot of trouble with that because the scripture right away, you know, come in my mind there the the only by the remission of sin. By the shedding of blood is the remission of sin. And and I see now brother Brandham say and brother Brandham says he can show scriptures for that. But in my reading of the church ages, I never saw where he actually pointed out to the scripture. But one day, in fact is I'm I'm probably thankful he didn't go to the scripture because one day the Holy Spirit just illuminated me. And when he does it by revelation, nothing ever take it away. &gt;&gt; And I was I was in some other country, some other place. I was kneeling at my little cot and I was reading the scripture and I I started to read this scripture. And he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, the name is his life. That's his manifestation. That's the way that he lived. The name, your name isn't just, you know, my name's not just Ed Biscll. It's what it's what I did in life. Your name is what you are, who you are, what you are, your association, your beliefs, your all of those things. That's who you are. That's your name. That's why we're called by a new name. That's why Abraham had to had to have his name changed because he was going to have a whole new life. He the old name couldn't bring forth Isaac. So, he had his name changed and brought forth a son. You understand? And so, I was just reading this scripture and uh wasn't in any particular uh message. And he that receiveth the righteous man, and I just got that far, and the Holy Spirit spoke as clear as I'm speaking to you, says, "He that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man's reward." And the Holy Spirit just said, "What is a righteous man's reward?" &gt;&gt; And I answered myself. I even answered it. I said, "Eternal life." And then that it exploded. He that receiveth a righteous man in the name not not the man's sermon. The man's sermon was his life. &gt;&gt; He lived the life. And so I've used this example. So you know uh the farmer John is on one side of the street and his maybe his friend Carl is on the other side of the street and one's a Holy Ghost believer of the message and just affirm he you know he honors God in all of his life and so on. And the man across the street, John, says to his wife, he says, 'You know, I'm not religious. I I've just I've never gone to church. I'm not religious at all, and I don't know anything about religion, but if there is a God, Carl's God is God. &gt;&gt; That man, he lives a life. I wish I could live like him. &gt;&gt; He's a He's a He's a He if there is Christians, he's a Christian. If there ever was a God, his God is God. And so he says to Carl, "Hey, you know, your tractors broke down. Use mine." You said, "Go ahead, use mine." And he just can't do enough for him. What is he doing? What's he seen? He actually seen Christ &gt;&gt; in the man &gt;&gt; and he's receiving his Christ. &gt;&gt; He is receiving Christ and he's believing on that Christ. He believes in him and he maybe tells his wife or even tells the friends or tells the community that man is a Christian. &gt;&gt; I don't know about the rest of these church people, but this man is a Christian. &gt;&gt; And if I and if I was going to be a believer, I' I'd believe what he believes. &gt;&gt; And in his heart, he's actually he's actually receiving that Christ. &gt;&gt; And God is so honored. He says, "Well, what I am, I gave to Christ. And what I what I poured into Christ was poured into his church and that was poured into Carl. And this man believes on him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That just happens to be my own thought. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and if you will receive it, this was Elias which was for to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. if you will, if you will with deliberate uh um movement and belief, take a hold of it and if you'll receive it. So now I say to this congregation, you young people, you need to know, we say, well, Malachi 4, Malachi 4, all this, you know, turn the hearts of the children, is that a revelation to you? Is that come as a reality to you? So that it it's you've been confronted by it that you've actually been confronted by it. Listen to me young people. Malachi 4 has to be something more than a scripture in the Bible. Malachi 4 was a person, a man who came and lived and fulfilled that scripture and you have it has to come as a revelation to you and you reach out with a deliberate hand and take a hold of it and pull it into yourself and say, "I believe that &gt;&gt; and I receive that &gt;&gt; and I receive what he says &gt;&gt; and I receive." He said it'll turn the heart back to the back to the the faith of the fathers. Now I can receive that. I believe that that word will turn me back. &gt;&gt; And you want to get into that message. You want to see what he said because what he said is going to turn you back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you'll start seeing your life change. You can't change it. He changes it. &gt;&gt; Because what are you receiving? You're receiving him. &gt;&gt; And to them that received him gave he power to become the sons of God. You didn't pull the power down. You just received. &gt;&gt; And just by receiving, you get it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "How do I get the Holy Ghost?" Just receive him. &gt;&gt; Receive him in his fullness. Receive him in all that he said. Whatever you said, I don't understand it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a brainwashing. No, it's a husband. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Like somebody say to some woman, "Why do you do that? I think that's ridiculous. My husband likes me to do it. &gt;&gt; My husband wants me to dress this way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All you sisters don't cook the same thing, but you cook what your family likes. You cook what your husband wants. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; And I didn't expect to get that quiet, but anyway. &gt;&gt; It works better. &gt;&gt; Amen. And by faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed. Try to take this one in, friends. &gt;&gt; Here's a whole city that's under the judgment of God and the whole place is going to collapse and the walls are going to fall. And this woman, a harlot, who's just received men in harlotry, she said uh that and she and by faith the harlot Rahab or Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had when she had received the spies with peace. &gt;&gt; And she wasn't agitated and all nervous and say, "Oh, I'm afraid if I if I say if I say the wrong thing, they're going to kill me." No, no. She just had a quiet rest. She had a quiet peace because that's what that word receiving. When she received them in peace &gt;&gt; and when she received them, she was already saved. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The cord wasn't in the window. &gt;&gt; The scarlet cord wasn't in the window yet. &gt;&gt; They hadn't marched around the walls. The armies hadn't even come. I tell you what, friends, you can have you can have peace and absolute confidence in your heart before the attack of the enemy ever comes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Before the army, before the destruction ever comes, you can have peace. &gt;&gt; They She received the spies with peace. She received them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the depth of faith in the simple act of receiving the depth of your faith anchored in the in the simple act of receiving whether it be the spies or whether it be somebody who can hardly preach or whether it be your pastor or a minister or whoever &gt;&gt; but you are confident that has been sent to me by God &gt;&gt; and I receive it. &gt;&gt; Oh, the receiving of it. And you know the beautiful thing about receiving? The youngest and the eldest that are here know all about it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. the mutual giving or receiving, giving and receiving of each other until the reality that the two are one. &gt;&gt; That kind of receiving is a depth that this message is all about. &gt;&gt; That's why we call this a bride message &gt;&gt; because it is an ultimate reception and receiving and giving of one another. Christ so freely gave himself to us. Now the scripture says, "Wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh." &gt;&gt; And what therefore God hath joined together, let no man put aunder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the Pergeamian, excuse me, Pergamanian church age, &gt;&gt; he said, "Notice the harmony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can just put the lights up for a moment. I I will come to another I have three I think two or three more slides. Notice the harmony of the father and the son. Jesus never did anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until it was first showed him by the father. How many times brother Brandham referred to that? &gt;&gt; He never did anything. The reason he was saying that was because he was trying to tell the people and trying to tell us, I don't do anything till I see a vision. &gt;&gt; People wanted him to go here and go there and fly overseas and lay hands and raise this child from the dead and do all you did it there, you can do it for me. But he couldn't do it. But when that vision came &gt;&gt; and then he obeyed that vision, &gt;&gt; if the hat was supposed to be on the bed, it wasn't on the bed yet. He waited till somebody put the hat on the bed. He couldn't put the hat on the bed. Somebody it had to happen in and and sovereignly. And when you know that something sovereignly happens, friends, just mark it down. &gt;&gt; Put it in your script bag. That's the way it is. God has done it. &gt;&gt; Quite frankly, that's the way I believe and that's the way this church has conducted all the years of the missions. When God opens a door, there's been other places, other times, and I've seen maybe there's greater needs in other places, but until God opens the door, but when he opens a door and you go through that door, then you have confidence you're being led by the author of this message and he's got somebody in there, somebody in that country, whatever more that wants this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we were in India over 30 years and and you you probably wouldn't know how this start started. I was on the way, brother Lonnie Jenkins coming from one direction, I coming from another direction. We were going to Norway, which we we spoke that convention Norway I think 13 years, 13 different times. And uh and uh one brother in Sweden, he said he said, "Could you just come, you know, maybe come a few days early and come into Sweden? We're just a few people, but we've never had a we've never had a meeting. If you come there, maybe we'd have a meeting because there are some of the people, sisters, maybe elder people that can't get over here to Norway. If you could stop stop there." So we arrived in Oslo and one brother took me up there. Brother Lonnie arrived with another person and and uh uh we got assigned to our rooms etc. and and there was a a man from India that was there spoke very very good English and he came with a a school teacher from Germany from Crayfeld Germany and they brought him up there to to Sweden to this meeting and uh once again I was in prayer a couple days into the meeting I was in prayer and I felt a voice within me saying go to that go to brother Daniel's room and I knew that he and this school teacher were together all the time. They came into service together, left together, ate together, whatever more because I think maybe the other brother was doing some interpreting for him. I don't know. So I I I once again I just said, "Lord, if this is you, when I get to his room, he'll be alone." So I got up from my bed. And I walked down to another building and entered the door and knocked on the door and I just heard come in. And so I opened the door and here's here's this Indian man uh from India sitting on his bed looking at a a book. So I said, "How are you, brother Daniel?" He was alone. I said, "Well," he said, "I'm just looking at some pictures of home." Oh, I see. He was real melancholy and uh yeah he said I'm just so I said how you know how did you get here and he said well he said um I arrived in Germany to visit a minister that had invited me but apparently wasn't convenient. He didn't know what to do with me. So he just called a man in his congregation who was free and said, you know, take him, you know, take him someplace. So he said, we went to Belgium. Uh but there was uh the man couldn't see me. The man who's kind of caring for the work, he couldn't see me. And so they said, "Well, you know, take him up to uh Norway, but not Norway because they didn't want him to meet me. You know, we have friends and then we have friends." But anyway, so this man didn't want this Indian brother to meet me. So he said, "Well, there's a convention nor Norway, so don't take him there. take them to Sweden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, God's got a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; And here they are, 30, 40 people maybe gathered in in in Sweden. And we arrived there and he's a total stranger. I haven't said anything. I I don't even know if I shook his hand. And and I sat down there. As a result of those few minutes in Sweden, the whole work in India started. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why don't you come?" I said, 'Well, are there any messages? No. He said, 'We haven't we haven't got any messages translated in in the Telugu language. And I said, 'Well, you know, are there believers? Well, yeah. He says, we we've heard about and I tried to get the people here in Germany to help us translate, but he said, well, you all speak English, they said. So, he said, so translation didn't happen. And uh he said then the same minister wanted me to translate his messages in Telugu. I said well why should I translate your messages in Telugu? I haven't translated brother Brandham's messages in Telugu yet. But it's this man had this ministry had more importance on his message than the prophet's message. And so the very next I think it was the very next November I was uh in India and I tell you what friends I need to write a book. I need to write a book. I'll just tell you this much about it. So I'm I'm I'm trying to make connections to go uh to Bombay and then I have to get a train for 12 hours and then he's going to meet me. This Daniel's going to meet me and take me to a city called Rajamandri. Rajamundry has a million people. There isn't a restaurant there that you'd ever eat in. There isn't a hotel that you would stay in. I guarantee you. And uh this is my first first time. So I call Air Canada. I'm not I'm not getting away from my message now. Do we have a little bit of time? Okay. So I call Air Canada and and I I want to make a flight to Bombay from Vancouver to London to Bombay and uh a few of you have heard Smatters about this but I'll just tell you and so they said well we can get you to London but the flights are all booked to Bombay. So I said well you know when can I go? Oh they said they're booked for about 3 months. Oh my goodness. I said, "Well, uh, can I go to London and then go on standby?" No, because we cannot, uh, we cannot send your bag through to Bombay. Your bag would come off and then you'd have to pick your bag off and recheck and then on. So that took the standby part off. And so I said, "Well, I was so desperate." So I said if I called British Airways and they allowed me to go on standby because there's no standby on that flight to Bombay. I said if they allowed me to go on standby would would you then send my bag through? We hadn't had 9/11 yet. So they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll we'll send your bag through if you if they say you'll go on standby." So I called over to London. There was only one of three people at the at that particular trans transit desk. And I said, "Air Canada will send me my bag through to Bombay if you'll let me go on standby there." And it was a very nice gentleman. He said, "Yeah, okay." He said, "I'll be here and uh you can go on standby." So I flew over, sent my bag on to Bombay. And I I got there and I went up to the desk. I I had six hours to wait. So I got there, went up to the transit desk and I said, I'm here on standby for the Bombay flight. Oh, they said, so they looked at the list. Okay. I said, 'What number am I? Said, you're number five. Oh, good. I felt real good. Said, just come back, you know, maybe 35 minutes or so ahead of the flight and uh so fine. I waited till about 1 hour before the flight and then I went up and there now the staff had changed. There was a lady there and and I said, "Uh, Mr. Biscll, uh, what number am I now on the standby list? And she said, uh, 32. I said, excuse me. I said, I was five. I was number five about 4 hours ago. No, she said, there's been others who are have different kind of ticket, different level of ticketing, and so you just got bumped because you were on a special low ticket and you just get bumped down. Oh. And she said, doesn't look very good. She said in fact is she said you should be going out to the main terminal and get yourself a hotel. I said well my bag is going through now. She said you know you should have thought of that ahead of time. I said okay. She said well if you want you know just you can wait here and come here about 25 minutes before the flight. So, I waited and I came up to her about 25 minutes before the flight and she said, "No, the flight's completely booked and everyone is everyone is already checked in and the and the flight's totally booked." So, she said, "Just go into the passageway and turn right and uh that'll take you to the main terminal. You get a hotel." I said, "What happens to my bag? How will I ever find my bag?" Said, "Mr. Biscll, I'm sorry. I can't do a thing about it." She said, "You know, uh, Air Canada should have told you about that." So, I walked away and I went into the passageway and I was just turning right and I and a voice. Well, I'm so glad that voice says, "No, go down and try." No, God even knows English. Said, "Go down and try." And so, I wheeled around real quick and I had to look over her to make sure she wasn't watching me. And I hiked right down this big passageway. And I'd heard the announcements, announcements, announcements. Gate 16. Gate 16. Uh, gate 16 in the final stages of loading. So I go down and I come to gate 16. And this is all windows here. All glass. And the other side of the glass is another security check where you have to put your bag through. And there's a security guard standing there. And I thought, "Oh no." And I turned a U-turn and headed right back out to the passageway the other direction towards the main terminal. I only got a few steps and I heard the voice. No, just try. And I did another Uturn. I must have looked like some kind of clown. I did another U-turn and headed right back and went in. And uh and I had I had my ticket. That's all I had. But I wasn't even supposed to be there without a boarding pass. And I come by and uh uh I I I don't think I even had a case to put on the thing. And when I came, the security guy said, "I'm going. I I'm on standby and I just have my ticket here." He says, "Who knows?" You know, and he just waved me on. I thought, "Boy, that was easy." So, I went in and and here's the last people in the per and the uh the the purser. He's coming out. He's saying, "Quick, quick." He's standing at the door and he's telling the girls, there's three girls here. He says, "Quick, quick. We got to close the door. You know, we're late. We got to close the door." And they're rushing through the last people. Here comes somebody else running as hard. They were late and they were all out of wind and so every time someone came up I just backed up because I wasn't even supposed to be there. So I just kept backing up and letting them in ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead. And finally I got off there and I handed her my tickets. She said, "Where's your boarding pass?" I said, "I don't have one." Which said, "You're not supposed to be here without a boarding pass." I said, "Well, I'm just going on standby." And she says, "Well, you know, well, you have to have a boarding pass to be here." And I said, and these were just words that God had to give me. I said, "Well, can I just stand here?" And a lady who was a supervisor stepped up and she says, stepped up right behind her, says, "What does he want?" And she said, "He he just wants to stand here." And you know, they didn't know what to do with that sentence. They didn't know what to do. He just wants to stand here. Says, "Oh," she says, "Just wanted to stand here. It's fine." And so there's a great big uh square uh Ottomans right behind. And so I just sat down on it. And here come a little guy about my age that about my age now. And he come running in. He's a little scrawny guy. And he's running in. He I thought he's going to have a heart attack. He's just panting. And he gets up and he hands him boarding pass and says, and by this time the person had come up about three times, hurry here. He says, we got to close the doors. He said, we're late. We got to close the doors. And so they scooted this little guy up and I'm sitting there and the whole place is empty. I've let everybody, you know, go ahead cuz I'm I'm there kind of illegally. And I'm just sitting there and I saw her look down and put up she took something in her hand and the Holy Spirit said once again, "She's looking at your tickets." And she just looked up and she said, "Well, I might as well take you." And I said, "Thank you." And I I I just went through that door. The person was right there. They closed that door right behind me. I got on the got on the airplane and the door closed right behind me and I sat in smoking section in between seat for the next 12 hours and there was the days they smoked up a storm and I just thought you know maybe I'm supposed to witness to somebody or something. I don't know what's supposed to happen here. There's got to be some purpose to this. That was the first trip to India and from on that trip we bought the printing press and when we left there it was already started and it's gone for over 30 years. &gt;&gt; Millions of messages. You know it doesn't always happen just real real easy. But I tell you what friends I I receive this message with all my heart. &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] I'm not going to keep you real long, but I I just can I just take along a little bit more? There's one one quote I want to come to, and I hope you love it with the same degree that I love it. As I said a moment ago that the ultimate is the receiving of the husband and wife and the uniting in time and sign. Brother Brandham says in the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one &gt;&gt; until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you receive it? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm speaking this morning because I want every person, young and old, even though you may feel so short, say, "Well, I don't really understand that, and I don't know how in the world it's going to happen." Don't worry about how it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You say, "I I've been such a failure. I've been this, that, the other thing." Don't Don't admit that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you know you're a failure, the devil knows you're a failure. And I tell you, whatever the devil knows, God knows that and a whole lot more. &gt;&gt; And one thing that the devil doesn't know, he doesn't know what's in the mind of God. But you don't know what I'm going to make out of him. &gt;&gt; You don't know what I'm going to make out of her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's something the devil doesn't know. &gt;&gt; He doesn't know what God's making out of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; comes in the ministry of a son of man to whisper his secrets to his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unites her with a s by a sacred union by the revealed truth. The revealed truth. Friends, we call a message the revealed truth is the cement. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the It is the cementing uh uh what do I say? The epoxy. It's what gives it the strength and he unites it. And so we are by a sacred union by the revealed word of truth for this hour and takes her to the home he has prepared. &gt;&gt; That's what this receiving is all about. Now, it's slide 12. I want to go over this very slowly. &gt;&gt; Do you receive it? &gt;&gt; Notice the title. Proving &gt;&gt; his word. &gt;&gt; He's going to prove it. &gt;&gt; He'll prove it to you. &gt;&gt; Proving it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you don't have to question it. Jesus said, "As it was in the days of Sodom, so will it be in the coming of the Son of Man." When the Son of Man is being revealed, &gt;&gt; when the Son of Man, Don't read ahead of me if you would, please. When the Son of Man is being revealed, not no more as a church. &gt;&gt; Now he's taking it to a different level. Churches received brother Prum churches received multitudes received Jesus Christ not as a church. &gt;&gt; This is a different level. Not no more. The brides called &gt;&gt; in that day the son of man will be revealed. &gt;&gt; What he's saying simply, just give me your keen attention. He's saying simply the very fact here we are after the fact messenger has come the messenger's gone we have the message and it's simply saying the very fact that the messenger came was evidence that it was the time to call the bride &gt;&gt; now you you just have to take that for what it means the very fact in the day when the son of man is revealed he's he's adding something to it he's adding another dimension. He said the very fact the very fact that this event happens is evidence to you the bride is being called &gt;&gt; not a church &gt;&gt; a bride &gt;&gt; a bride. A woman &gt;&gt; is being called that will move through this courtship &gt;&gt; and be drawn in and wedded. The wedding doesn't happen in heaven. The wedding happens now. &gt;&gt; Listen friends. Listen church. We're married. &gt;&gt; We are married to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He is our head. &gt;&gt; The headship. We don't question the message. The world calls it brainwashing. I'm not interested in what they call it. There is lost and confused and total total uh just darkness out there. I'm not interested what the world I'm not interested in your peers, my peers, anybody's peers. They're lost &gt;&gt; for the most part. We're interested in in what a prophet has said is our headship. &gt;&gt; What the scripture says, he is the head of the church. That's the end of it. And I desire, my desire for preaching this morning is that everyone under the sound of my voice can come to that place that I receive him. &gt;&gt; They that received him gave he power. &gt;&gt; I want you to receive that power. &gt;&gt; To become the sons of God. If you receive this church and say, "Well, I belong to Cloverdale by the way." That won't do it. &gt;&gt; Well, I know God sent a prophet. That won't do it. The woman at the well said, "You're a prophet." That didn't do it. &gt;&gt; She had to come to the place, you are the Messiah. &gt;&gt; You are the promised one. &gt;&gt; You are the final picture. You're the final thing. &gt;&gt; Friends, you have to say, there is no more. If people within this message could recognize there isn't another messenger. &gt;&gt; How many husbands can you have there? The the the Christ is a is a husband. And as far as I'm concerned, William Brham produced brought that forth. &gt;&gt; And conducted a marriage ceremony. Amen. &gt;&gt; The invisible union of the bride of Jesus Christ to me united the bride with the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; And you are on your way to a supper. &gt;&gt; A marriage supper. &gt;&gt; We're married to him. &gt;&gt; You're married. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] And so he says the bride's called in that day the son of man will be revealed. What? He asked the question to join the church to the head. &gt;&gt; Unite the marriage of the bride. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom will come right through this. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. He did so on the day of Pentecost. He came in that form. There are the theologians from ancient theologians past that believe that was the second coming when Jesus said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you." And he fulfilled that. He did come to them because because Christ is also there's only one God. &gt;&gt; He's a son. And he was coming into the age of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Going from son of man to son of God. It was in that transition and we're in the transition right now going from son of son of man &gt;&gt; right through to son of David. So I don't want to get into that. But here he says, "And the bridegroom will come." When he said, "I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And receive you. &gt;&gt; So there had to be, listen to me now, there had to be a people, listen to me, there had to be a people prepared for him to receive. [Applause] The &gt;&gt; bride already had to be called. It's all in this paragraph. &gt;&gt; When the son of man, when the days of Noah are present, the days of Sodom are present and they are. &gt;&gt; Do you receive that? &gt;&gt; You receive that. &gt;&gt; If you receive that, then receive this. It'll be in that day. That is the proof that the son of man will be revealed in that day. And I want you to say, I also receive that. &gt;&gt; Then if the son of man was revealed in that day, he was to reveal himself as the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; You receive that. &gt;&gt; And he received now that the bridegroom came in this ministry. And he showed the church his gifts. &gt;&gt; And the church was all excited about the gifts. all the gifts and the dazzle and the power of it and all the gift and the knowing and the secret of the hearts and oh isn't this wonderful. They thought they wanted that kind of a bridegroom. But when they begin to hear that he wanted to actually separate them from the church from the he wanted to separate them from the world. It was a separation they didn't want to didn't want to experience because they love the world. We love our our Hollywood hairstyles. We love the fashion of the world. We love the entertainment of the world. We love Well, we don't love Well, do you love it more than Jesus? Well, not really, but they do. &gt;&gt; And they have not they were not willing to receive him. &gt;&gt; It was so the same thing was happening again. He came to his own, but his own wouldn't receive him. But as many as received him to them. So the people already had to be here. The bride already had to be here. The called ones you already had to hear the message. And out of the message the people came and they were identified and and there's different degrees of receiving him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some said, "Well, you know, it's it's this Sunday I go to church. It's not it. You won't receive power to become sons of God. Say, "Well, I went to Cloverdale, by the way. It doesn't mean a thing." &gt;&gt; Well, I listen to this person, that person. No, it's it's it's that it comes into your knowing, into your knowing, your understanding, and it never leaves it. &gt;&gt; I've got a lot of books. We got discs. We got CDs. We got that. It has nothing to do with that. Has to do that. This is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is him revealing himself. This is him proving himself. And you see him, you know, you see you you read and maybe hear it on the book and you hear it on the tape and you see the revealing and brother Brand maybe preaches influence or preaches some other message or whatever. Then he calls people up and starts revealing the secret of their heart. People get all excited and enthused. But to you, it's a personal message to you. He Jesus Christ is using this vessel to prove to me &gt;&gt; he knows the secret of my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we say, "Oh, that's my husband." &gt;&gt; Oh, that's my husband. &gt;&gt; Oh, that that's just like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we just love him more. And while people are missing it, we just love him more. We enter into such a union and a relationship with him. &gt;&gt; We say, "I love you, Lord." &gt;&gt; And he responds and says, "I love you, too." Yes. &gt;&gt; So the bridegroom will come right through this &gt;&gt; when the son of man will come down &gt;&gt; and come in human flesh &gt;&gt; to unite the two together. &gt;&gt; And that was the son of man representing himself in the flesh of that prophet uniting the two together. Listen folks, I announce it. The two have been made one. The union has taken place. We have already been united with the bridegroom. We're married to Jesus Christ and we're on our way home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. The church &gt;&gt; has to be the word. &gt;&gt; He is the word and the two unites together. &gt;&gt; And to do that, it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's son of man. Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; will come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you receive it? Will come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In human flesh &gt;&gt; among us, &gt;&gt; among us. and will make his word so real. &gt;&gt; That's what he's seeking to do today. Listen to every man, woman, every boy, every child, every person in he'll make it so real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll make it so real &gt;&gt; that it'll unite the church &gt;&gt; and him as one. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, friends. It will it can become this that I'm speaking to you has the capacity to become so real. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even if your mind is kind of dull, say the service kind of go long, just start out and say with me, it'll become so real. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. I receive it. It'll become so real. &gt;&gt; Accept this message. Accept this word that's already spoken. You'll become so real &gt;&gt; that you will unite me [Music] &gt;&gt; as one the bride and then &gt;&gt; she'll go home to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; You want to go home to the wedding supper, &gt;&gt; then first it has to become so real. &gt;&gt; So real. [Music] [Applause] I'm trying to put it in an order &gt;&gt; cuz God has an order. &gt;&gt; And we'll go home to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's already united. &gt;&gt; You receive that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We go to the wedding supper, &gt;&gt; not the marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it were not so, I would have told you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place for you. &gt;&gt; And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again &gt;&gt; and receive you. &gt;&gt; Paralamano receive you. I will take you with a deliberate hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no error. There's no mistake. There's no question. There's no hesitation. When I come to you, I will take you with a deliberate hand and receive you unto myself. [Music] Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And when you realize I have been taken into his embrace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's no way to get out of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perilano unto myself that where I am there ye may be also. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One of these words, this might be a blessing to you. I'm I've got to just go away from some pages because I want to end right away. But one of these words in this deci decomi it's one of its descriptions is that it is used of a place of a place that when one is being received or the receiving of one and that is why it's good for us to go back to the place when it happened. Do you know that brother Brandham he went back the places and you know all about it but he went back so many times. How many times do you go back and speak of the Ohio River? &gt;&gt; Why? Because that was the place &gt;&gt; he was told. He said just the same thing he said when I baptized right down there at the Ohio River. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here comes that big light &gt;&gt; hanging y right yonder coming moving down over me and said as John the Baptist was sent to forrun the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forrun the second coming of Christ is it the Ohio River when he came down on the Ohio River how about do you remember when he came down to you and the thing that he said to you he totally gave you a witness you're not of this world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're not of this insanity. You're not of all this religion. You've been in this church, that church, the other. You've been in the world. You've been in drugs. You've been in alcoholic. You've been an addict. You've been this. You've been that. None of that mattered anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; And you need to go back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Part of that of him receiving you, you go back and say, "That's where I've done it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I've done it. &gt;&gt; I've had to get in my vehicle over the years and I've said just said to my wife, I have to just slip away. I'm going to I'm going to go up north, get in my truck. I'm not going hunting. I'm not going fishing. I'm not going to see anybody. I'm going to talk to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. and I'll maybe just stop. I remember one day clearly just stopped the truck on a bank and out in the middle of nowhere and looked over a big lake. It was fall time and the colors were all out and the wind was blowing and the fall leaves and I sat in the bank and I just told him a lot of things I don't know. A lot of things happening I don't understand. But one thing I know that was you that called me &gt;&gt; and you were listening that day that I laid on that bed and gave you my life. &gt;&gt; That was you. And at another time and I just went to three or four spots. I don't know anything else that happened maybe in between. I can't explain it. But I know that was you. &gt;&gt; And I received that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I received you friends. He'll give you power &gt;&gt; to become the son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to be I'm going to just read that. I don't have this on a on a slide. At least I don't think so. No, it's fine. Will you listen to this? And I'm closing. The Bible says, this is the revelation of Jesus Christ series. The Bible says 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become and the reason why I'm reading this now after this long message if you'll please just give this honor to me to receive now what what he says. Sometimes it's hard but receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our union with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says we are the very righteousness &gt;&gt; of God himself. &gt;&gt; Your mind will never grasp it. Don't try to think about it. Just say I receive that. Amen. &gt;&gt; By being in Christ, it says that he Jesus &gt;&gt; became sin for us. &gt;&gt; Now, if I can just have your attention for a few more moments, please. This is why I came to this and I there's a whole another side of this. A whole another side of I wish I had time but there's a whole another glorious grasp because it says as many as received him but when he received you were in sin. &gt;&gt; You were in unbelief. &gt;&gt; You were unclean. You were a cursor, a dammer, a blasphemer, a drinker, a this or that or the other thing. and and and not just these sins of the flesh. We're not talking about that. But we were unclean. &gt;&gt; We were unbelievers. &gt;&gt; He took your sin. &gt;&gt; He received it into himself. &gt;&gt; Because he had the token. [Music] &gt;&gt; And the And now listen, brother Brandon makes it and I'm glad he makes a he makes a special point of this. Amen. &gt;&gt; He became sin for us. It does not say he became sinful but be but became became sin for us that our union with him we might become the righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; He didn't mix he didn't mix his righteousness with our sin. We received him. He received us. He became sin for us. not sinful, but he took our sin. He received it &gt;&gt; because he had the bleach &gt;&gt; that could destroy it. &gt;&gt; And that's the only way by taking your sin into the bleach of his blood, you become sinless. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you receive that? &gt;&gt; You become the righteousness of God. Otherwise these words don't mean anything. He said if we accept the fact and we must. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our union with him have become the very righteousness of God. &gt;&gt; To reject one is to reject the other. be saved. &gt;&gt; To accept the one is to accept the other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I accept it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wonder Brother Derek if you'll come. And &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, how we believe it with all of our heart. I trust I really trust, friend. You can take this receiving him. &gt;&gt; And I never even came near to the place where he said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Receive it with a deliberate movement, a deliberate action. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many this morning after hearing this word will say, "I'm going to take a I'm going to take a renewed look at the whole at the whole encompassing the whole uh uh accumulation of the message because it friends as long as I stand behind this pulpit, as long as I have a message to preach behind any pulpit, I will believe that this word is him." That's fine. &gt;&gt; But now it's how to what degree do we receive it? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just another church. It's not just a few loose ends that are put together. It's not his idea mixed with some of his own thoughts and mixed with the scripture. It's not that. &gt;&gt; It is a proven vindicated word from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; I'd like to sing I would not be denied. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Enjoy the word. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Why don't we stand to our feet? Amen. I will not be denied. I will not be denied. [Music] Death seized over my soul. Unto the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came. Behold, I would not be denied. As Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled with the Lord. And instant with a courage bold I stood upon his word. I would not be I would not be till Jesus came and he made me whole. Would not be. Oh s my heart was gone. Now you are praying. Not [Applause] Jesus came not [Music] praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he reached down his hand for me, just a verse, maybe a chorus, &gt;&gt; was a straight from the heaven [Music] for me. Oh my god. [Music] Yeah. [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Glory [Music] for glory. All that without God [Music] now. Before we sing it once again, I want to ask this congregation like to put you on notice. [Music] I'd like you to say, I'm receiving my place of responsibility in my home in the body of Christ that's both here and both elsewhere. I'm receiving it. I want the young people to say, "I receive the headship of my parents. I receive the headship of the ministry. &gt;&gt; I receive the headship of what the message declares. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't discovered it, it would be good. Pick it up. And you can start with the message, young people, older ones. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And this is one of the great secrets that has come to light and has been made known this time. And I announce to this church and all whoever here as far as as far as this church is concerned and anything I have to do with it, we receive the headship &gt;&gt; of this word. &gt;&gt; And we don't need another. &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody's opinion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't need anybody's idea. We just need his headship &gt;&gt; and say, "Come, oh, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; What you say we'll do. &gt;&gt; What you say we believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let every man and every woman take their place in the name of Jesus Christ. And Jesus, we receive you in your headship. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray you'll bless this congregation. and bless all who have raised their hands, raised their heart, raised their voice saying, "I receive you, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; in your headship, &gt;&gt; not just as redeemer, not just as healer, not just as something else, not just as friend, but I receive you, oh husband, &gt;&gt; husband of the church, husband of my soul, &gt;&gt; I receive you in a new and vigorous way. Lord, &gt;&gt; make known yourself to me, oh my Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll bless this congregation as we go and depart this depart this sanctuary. May your presence be with everyone throughout this afternoon, oh God. And as we are preparing now for the time out at the camp and people will be coming from different states, from different places, even different countries coming. Oh God, I prepare I pray you'll prepare us to be what we need to be for the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; We assume and receive our responsibility. Oh God, to be brothers indeed, sisters indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I'm being so blessed in in making this commitment my own soul. Oh God, let us be what we ought to be to one another when we take one another and embrace one another and shake hands with one another. May the Holy Spirit flow from heart to heart, from attribute to attribute. And may this congregation become a strengthened congregation. Lord, not a bunch of individuals that come together, but one unit. &gt;&gt; Oh, meld us together, oh God. Bless the service this afternoon, oh God, as our brother Andy's and others go with him to Seattle and the saints that will gather there. May they have a mighty time, I pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, Holy Spirit. We give ourselves to you entirely, completely. We love you. &gt;&gt; We love you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I love him. I love him. I love him. With this we all go. I love you. I love you. Be worthy. and just my Salvation [Music] on your room, on your sofa, in your car. But I'd like to say something to you personally right from my heart to yours. the next time or as soon as you can and you hear the prophet of God, our precious brother Brandham, God's prophet and your prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The next time you hear him and he he begins to call to the people and then and then that that one our husband takes over his voice and begins to tell the people the secret of the heart. I'd like you to say I'd like you to say something. I love that. &gt;&gt; I just love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not him, a man. He's yielding to it, but I that's you. I believe that that's none other than Jesus Christ, my husband. You're the one that's speaking. And the reason I'm counseling you to do that is because he loves to hear that. &gt;&gt; He loves to hear that. And and the reason I saying that is because it let the Lord know that what was spoken this morning kind of touched you and got through to you. &gt;&gt; You said, "I'm going to do that." Saying, "Brother Ed counseledled me, advised me, and with his whole heart told me to say, I love you. &gt;&gt; I love you. I love every time. I love this vindication. Oh, I love how you prove yourself." and you just see how he responds to you. Hallelujah. And he'll pour out good things upon your life. God bless you. You're dismissed in Jesus name. I love one another with a real Christian offer. be first. [Music]
