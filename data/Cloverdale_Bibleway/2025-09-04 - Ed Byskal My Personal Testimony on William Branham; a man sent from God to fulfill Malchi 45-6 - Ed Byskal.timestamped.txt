[0:59] seats.
[1:08] There is some difficulty in giving a
[1:10] testimony because it spans so many
[1:14] years.
[1:16] You'll need your full attention and your
[1:18] full focus to be able to follow me.
[1:22] In the years of 1946,447,
[1:26] 1948,
[1:28] they were years where there was a great
[1:30] restoration taking place and a revival
[1:34] was sweeping not only North America but
[1:37] many parts of the world. Brother Brham
[1:40] refers to it as the restoration of the
[1:42] gifts and it it did indeed take place.
[1:46] It was something that I along with many
[1:48] others that are here were uh uh
[1:52] privileged to see it and uh see its rise
[1:57] and also see its demise.
[2:00] This was this was the spiritual
[2:03] atmosphere
[2:05] in which God had allowed to be created
[2:10] one in which he would send his prophet
[2:12] messenger to. Uh brother Brandham said I
[2:17] I am new in the Pentecostal church. I
[2:21] come from the Baptist church. And then
[2:24] the Baptist people couldn't see that
[2:28] there was a divine gift. The Pentecostal
[2:31] people believed it. So there's where God
[2:36] sent me. You see, God had created an
[2:39] atmosphere that was prepared to accept
[2:43] that gift. And that's where God sent me.
[2:47] There's where I feel at home. I'm one of
[2:50] you because I have received the Holy
[2:53] Ghost. And then God made that thing
[2:56] manifest to me and I started off. So
[2:59] this was the atmosphere
[3:02] that was prevailing at the time that God
[3:06] sent Elijah into the world to commence
[3:10] his worldwide ministry. Of course, he
[3:12] had been ministering long before that.
[3:14] And so when we saw Brother Brandham's
[3:17] ministry rise on the scene, it was uh it
[3:22] was a a remarkable ministry, but there
[3:24] were many ministries that began to rise
[3:26] all at once. There was none of my
[3:30] immediate friends or associations that
[3:33] that recognized that this was a uh a
[3:38] messenger ministry or Malachi 4. None of
[3:42] none of that was known to us. But we
[3:45] were fully primed to accept apostles,
[3:50] prophets, pastors, teachers, all the
[3:54] gifts. It was such an atmosphere that
[3:56] prevailed that when brother Brandham
[3:59] came and begin to demonstrate the office
[4:02] of a prophet, we just said right away.
[4:04] There wasn't even a moment's hesitation.
[4:06] We said, "He's a prophet of God." And
[4:09] that's what he was known. And you you
[4:11] hear FF Bosworth uh you hear him say uh
[4:14] God has raised up a prophet unto us uh
[4:17] in Jeffersonville, Indiana. So that was
[4:20] not a difficult thing for us to say or
[4:23] to accept. Now he said in the angel of
[4:28] God, I know the next thing to happen is
[4:30] the restoration of the gifts to the
[4:32] church. This is 1948. And it's the
[4:36] hardest thing I've had to do in this
[4:38] pioneering work is to do this as to see
[4:43] the people. He said that God cannot give
[4:46] back the gifts to the church as long as
[4:48] his church is divided. And we've got to
[4:51] get the church together first before the
[4:54] gifts can come. But if all the full
[4:57] gospel people would come with one heart
[4:59] and one accord. So you see that was the
[5:02] direction that he was leaning at that
[5:04] time. And then for those of you that uh
[5:08] are familiar with the message, you've no
[5:10] doubt run across the term that brother
[5:14] Brandham uses the latter rain brethren.
[5:18] Now there are many here who would not
[5:20] know at all what the latter rain
[5:23] brethren are. The latter reign,
[5:25] brethren, was in the midst of this
[5:27] movement because because I'll explain it
[5:30] to you this way. When God thrust the
[5:34] spirit of Elijah onto the into the
[5:37] earth, it fell onto the whole world.
[5:40] And so there was a spirit all over the
[5:43] world. And there were croppings here and
[5:46] there and and there was movements of God
[5:49] here and there which I'm going to give a
[5:51] little testimony to before I come
[5:53] directly into the contact with brother
[5:56] Brham. And in the message I will
[5:58] restore.
[6:00] Brother Brandham said now there's a
[6:02] difference between prophecy a gift of
[6:05] prophecy and a prophet. Now he was
[6:08] saying that for a specific reason back
[6:11] at this time in 1953.
[6:13] He said, "Did you know that?" He said,
[6:16] "There's where you brethren in the
[6:18] latter rain went off at." And now it's
[6:22] not identified latter rain as a as a
[6:25] movement, but it was a movement. It was
[6:27] a body of people. He said, "Somebody
[6:29] make a prophet say you call them a
[6:31] prophet." That's wrong. Now, he's trying
[6:34] to correct those brethren in the waters
[6:36] of separation. He said, "Of course, I
[6:39] believe the gifts and calling of God are
[6:40] without repentance. You can't make
[6:43] yourself something that you're not uh
[6:46] different a little bit with you some of
[6:48] your latter rain brethren on that on
[6:51] laying on of hands and giving gifts.
[6:54] They would call people up. I sat in the
[6:56] meetings. I I've been prayed for myself.
[6:59] They would call people up especially I
[7:01] was in my teens at that time but uh
[7:04] especially young couples, elder ones,
[7:06] call them up, pray for them and give
[7:08] them the gift of prophecy. Give them the
[7:10] gift of healing. give them this gift,
[7:12] that gift, tell them you have this
[7:13] ministry, you are an apostle and you'll
[7:16] go to Africa, you are this and you're
[7:17] going to go to the Eskimos and so on and
[7:20] and but the presence of God in the
[7:22] meetings was absolutely gripping. It was
[7:26] absolutely gripping as young young
[7:28] fellows 12, 13, 14 years old go into a
[7:31] service at 10:00 in the morning just
[7:34] sneak out quickly in the afternoon for a
[7:36] sandwich fearful that you're going to
[7:38] miss something and still be in the
[7:40] church at midnight that night
[7:44] &gt;&gt; and there were supernatural things
[7:46] happening. Some of the things that I
[7:48] hear of people trying to produce in the
[7:49] message today is is excuse me now and I
[7:52] don't mean to be sacriiggious but it's a
[7:54] cheap rerun.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; This was genuine.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; I stood in a church in Edmonton, Alberta
[8:02] and just told it in Edmonton the other
[8:03] day where around 700 people were
[8:06] present. I'm sitting well back and
[8:09] because I'm you know just a young fellow
[8:11] but I had a real heart for God and uh it
[8:13] was nothing to have the people standing
[8:15] and just swaying like like like reeds in
[8:19] the water with the movement of the tides
[8:22] and stand and sing in the spirit and
[8:24] just wave and then eb and flow for an
[8:28] hour, hour and a half just uh spell
[8:32] binding
[8:34] &gt;&gt; and and and was in one of those meetings
[8:36] when half that audience cried out in one
[8:40] voice at one instant, "Open up ye gates
[8:44] and let the king of glory come in." And
[8:46] the other side answered, "Who is the
[8:48] king of glory?" And this side answered,
[8:50] "The Lord of hosts, he is the king of
[8:52] glory." I just put goosebumps on top of
[8:55] my goosebumps. I tell you what, it was
[8:58] so real. You You couldn't manufacture
[9:01] that if you tried.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; That was the atmosphere. I want I'm I'm
[9:06] wanting to to get you to see the
[9:08] atmosphere that God had prepared to send
[9:11] the prophet's ministry into.
[9:14] I went to I went to a little meeting, a
[9:16] little revival was breaking out in
[9:18] another town about 350 miles from where
[9:21] we were. I had to work in the store I
[9:23] was working in. I was, I think, 17 at
[9:26] the time. and uh uh we uh members of our
[9:32] group and from our town were going to
[9:34] journey across from northern British
[9:36] Columbia to northern Alberta. So I
[9:38] determined I was going to go also. I had
[9:39] a motorcycle and so I got on that
[9:42] motorcycle at closing time on on Friday
[9:45] evening and I started out about a 350 mi
[9:49] journey. I traveled till about 2:00 in
[9:51] the morning. that far northern air was
[9:53] so penetrating I was actually suffering
[9:57] from exposure I didn't know it and I was
[10:00] about 2:00 in the morning I was looking
[10:01] at at uh to see if there'd be a light
[10:04] here or a light there some farm and I
[10:05] felt so self-conscious didn't want to go
[10:08] rolling up with my motorcycle to
[10:10] somebody get him out of bed and it just
[10:12] bothered me so bad I didn't like to do
[10:14] that and finally here was a here was a
[10:16] log house right close to the road about
[10:19] like I said about two two o'clock in the
[10:22] And so I run my bike. I couldn't stand
[10:24] to ride it any longer. I was just so
[10:26] freezing. And it was going to snow that
[10:29] night, which it did. It snowed about 4
[10:31] in. I pulled a lean of my motorcycle up
[10:33] against the up against the building and
[10:36] came and knocked on the door and just
[10:38] heard, "Come on in." So I opened the
[10:40] door and there's a fellow sitting at the
[10:42] back there, a bachelor, which there's
[10:45] lots of them up in the north, and had
[10:46] his feet up and he's reading a book. He
[10:49] doesn't ask me who I am or why I'm
[10:50] coming in this time of the morning. This
[10:52] is the north. It's entirely different.
[10:54] Says, you know, I'm reading this book.
[10:56] He said, 'D did you ever hear of this
[10:57] fellow? And that's how he starts talking
[10:59] to me. I'm reading this book. He said
[11:01] about this fellow. Did you ever hear of
[11:02] him? I said, no, I never heard of him. I
[11:04] mean, I'm total stranger and I never
[11:06] heard of him. I said, uh, he says it's
[11:08] quite interesting. He said, uh, uh, I I
[11:10] didn't hear you come up. I said, well, I
[11:12] rode up on a motorcycle. Did you? He
[11:14] said, I didn't hear you. I said, "Well,
[11:15] matter of fact, I'm I'm about freezing
[11:18] to death out there. I just wanted to
[11:20] know if I could maybe bunk here for the
[11:21] night." And he said, "Yeah, sure. I got
[11:24] an extra room here." So, he put me up
[11:26] and got up in the morning and cooked me
[11:28] bacon and eggs and sent me on my way and
[11:31] goodbye. And I just said, "God bless
[11:33] him. I don't know. We've never met again
[11:35] on on this side at least." And then as
[11:38] we journeyed, uh, I had to go through
[11:40] about 4 in of snow for many, many miles
[11:43] with that motorcycle. And then it
[11:45] started to melt and got wet and it was
[11:47] quite a journey. But we arrived up at
[11:49] this I arrived up at this little church.
[11:51] It was a Baptist church. And the
[11:53] minister's name was Ericson. And uh the
[11:57] spirit of God was falling in such a way.
[11:59] It was so new. It was so fresh. And uh
[12:03] so I I sat this was a a Saturday evening
[12:07] and I was right in front. Uh I can't re
[12:10] recall just all that happened in the
[12:12] service. than when the service was
[12:14] finished. Uh they didn't have room for
[12:16] some of us. So some of us uh young men
[12:20] slept in the back of the church in a
[12:22] room back there just had our sleeping
[12:24] bags on the floor and I just got in on
[12:26] my sleeping bag and the spirit of God
[12:28] came upon me and I in such a grieving I
[12:32] was so had such a grief such a burden
[12:35] and I I couldn't understand it. So I and
[12:37] I broke and I be to weep and I sobbed
[12:40] and I sobbed till I guess my eyes were
[12:43] about swollen shut. I couldn't
[12:45] understand. I didn't know what I was
[12:47] praying about. I just groaned and
[12:49] groaned and groaned. Don't know how long
[12:52] it was. Seemed maybe an hour, hour and a
[12:54] half, maybe two hours, I don't know.
[12:57] Finally just fell off to sleep and a
[12:59] piece came. Pastor came the next morning
[13:03] morning meeting. He said, uh, I don't
[13:07] know who it was, but he said, someone
[13:10] prayed last night. He said, somehow we
[13:15] grieved the Holy Spirit yesterday
[13:17] afternoon.
[13:18] And he said, I knew that we grieved him,
[13:22] but he said, uh, uh, someone must have
[13:25] been in prayer last night. and it just
[13:28] such a sensitivity to the moving of the
[13:31] spirit and what was pleasing to the
[13:34] spirit. After that service, I and my
[13:37] wife, we were not uh we were not going
[13:40] together as a young man, young woman at
[13:43] the time, but I I was looking very very
[13:46] seriously at my future. And I felt the
[13:49] call of God on my life. And I might have
[13:51] been 18 at that time, I just can't
[13:53] recall. and uh she was with her
[13:57] girlfriend and she was sitting at the
[13:59] very very back of the church. The the
[14:02] church was absolutely packed, not a big
[14:05] building, but it was just packed. Uh
[14:08] probably even people standing and I was
[14:10] sitting right in the front. And uh when
[14:12] the service was over, uh we stood up and
[14:16] we begin to greet one another, turned
[14:18] around to shake hands with a a farm
[14:20] couple right behind me. I had met the
[14:22] couple on one occasion. and I don't
[14:24] remember their name. They were real
[14:26] godly uh just farm people and rugged
[14:31] people. And I turned shook hands with
[14:33] him and shook hands with her and she
[14:36] just looked at me and she said, "You
[14:38] have something very heavy on your
[14:39] heart." And I said, "That is true." She
[14:42] said, "It concerns a young woman." And I
[14:46] said, "That is also correct." and she
[14:48] turned around, pointed to the back of
[14:51] the church, pointed right directly at my
[14:53] wife. She says, "That's the little dark
[14:55] girl at the back against the wall." I
[14:57] said, "That is correct." She said, "Have
[15:00] no fear. God has given her to you." And
[15:03] that was all that was said. And see
[15:05] those kind of things, those kind of
[15:08] things where they were happening on a
[15:11] continual basis. And so I wanted to say
[15:15] that so that you could understand kind
[15:18] of the atmosphere uh what was taking
[15:21] place.
[15:22] It was in such a way that the young
[15:25] people were actually afraid. Then I
[15:28] became a young pastor in my church. And
[15:31] I had an elder, a man that I highly
[15:34] highly respected, one who probably
[15:36] taught me more about the woods and about
[15:39] hunting. And he was he was he was as he
[15:42] was at as as at home out in the woods as
[15:44] any of the animals. It was just
[15:46] incredible. You know, Brother Haney was
[15:49] his name. And he told me one time that
[15:51] he he was going along. He realized he
[15:53] wasn't going to make it home. And he saw
[15:56] in this little bank, cut bank from a a
[15:58] creek bed. And uh it was frozen now. on
[16:02] and uh he could see all the fresh
[16:04] diggings of a big sa mother bear had dug
[16:07] all this and took a bunch of he looked
[16:09] up in that den and he saw grass up in
[16:12] there and he thought uh well this looks
[16:15] quite comfortable. So he crawled up in
[16:18] the den that this sa bear was making for
[16:20] herself and slept there that night. And
[16:23] I said, "How could you sleep?" You know,
[16:26] I mean, you talk about cool people. He
[16:30] said, "Oh, I didn't think she'd come in
[16:32] there while I was there." That was his
[16:34] only remark. It was Brother Haney's farm
[16:37] that I took Brother Brandham to then in
[16:40] 1961 to try out his rifle. And I had not
[16:44] been around a man like brother Brandham.
[16:47] I didn't expect he would ever respond
[16:49] and and come to us. But it was to
[16:52] brother Haney's farm. But let me just
[16:53] finish with brother Haney. The kind of
[16:55] people there were. I want you to see the
[16:58] kind of people there were at that time
[17:00] because that's that's who God sent
[17:03] brother Brandham to.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Haney had a son. His son became
[17:08] weward and he had a his son got married,
[17:12] had a child. Then they broke up. His
[17:14] wife had another child. They were still
[17:16] living loosely together, but it turned
[17:18] out the child wasn't his. But he was
[17:21] charged for support of this other child.
[17:24] And he was taken to court. And because
[17:26] he didn't support the child, they put
[17:28] him in jail. And the jail was about 500
[17:32] miles away. And brother Haney, he just
[17:36] told me uh said to put my son in jail.
[17:40] Brother Haney's task. He was a farmer,
[17:42] but in the winter time he dug graves.
[17:45] And so he was telling me this at this
[17:48] time in the wintertime. So they sent my
[17:51] son. His son happened to be one of my
[17:53] closest friends only. We mo both made a
[17:56] decision when we were at the age of many
[17:59] of you young men that are here. And my
[18:01] decision was we both came to the altar
[18:04] one night, both gave our lives to
[18:07] Christ. And uh I decided I would never
[18:10] pick it up or go the way of the world
[18:12] again. His only lasted a few days and he
[18:14] just he just uh went towards the world
[18:18] was in the dances and carried on and
[18:20] this was the result. Now I was in the
[18:22] church and working in the church and
[18:24] actually pastoring and here he was in
[18:26] prison one of my best friends. But his
[18:29] daddy said to me, he said, and I knew
[18:31] the judge personally real well also. And
[18:34] uh, Brother Haney said to me, he said,
[18:38] "I've prayed a prayer." He said, "And I
[18:40] prayed,
[18:42] Father, if this judge's decision to send
[18:46] my p my son to prison, if his judgment
[18:50] is true, let it stand. And if it is not
[18:54] true, I now ask you to remove him from
[18:57] his place. Brother Haney dug the judge's
[19:01] grave two weeks from that prayer and
[19:03] poured the dirt on top of his coffin.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; These are men who knew how to walk with
[19:10] God.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; And these are the kind of men and people
[19:14] and places that God sent brother
[19:17] Brandham to. And it was at this time and
[19:21] amongst these people that I wrote
[19:24] brother Brandham because something had
[19:27] happened in my youth while all these
[19:29] meetings now many had come forward.
[19:33] Tommy Osbbor, Tommy Hicks, Vilmer
[19:37] Gardner, uh Jack Moore, uh Oel Jaggers,
[19:42] Oral Roberts, and all of them. And they
[19:45] had magazines, had programs, had their
[19:47] agendas. And I was getting many of their
[19:49] magazines. Then the Christian
[19:50] businessmen 1957 I believe they had
[19:53] their beginning and then they began to
[19:56] flourish. Brother Brandham became one of
[19:58] their main speakers to arrange meetings
[20:01] and to open chapters in new cities. And
[20:04] so brother Brandham was appreciated. He
[20:07] was also used.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:10] But I my father uh was moving from
[20:14] northern British Columbia to southern
[20:15] British Columbia. And uh on the journey,
[20:19] of course, my father would be in he he
[20:21] was converted Catholic, converted from
[20:24] Catholicism
[20:26] and lived a very fervent, holy, godly
[20:29] life. Uh and I was brought up in a home
[20:32] that believed in prayer. And uh even
[20:36] though my mother passed away when I was
[20:38] 6 and 1/2 years old, I had a a good
[20:41] stepmother, but my father was a man of
[20:44] the word of God. And so he wanted to be
[20:46] in any meeting he could be in. And even
[20:48] while we were in the midst of moving uh
[20:51] about a thousand miles, he we came upon
[20:54] a city called Vernon, British Columbia
[20:56] in the Okonogan Valley. And there were
[20:58] some meetings taking place. So we
[21:00] stopped to take in the meetings. They
[21:02] happened to be brother Brandham's
[21:03] meetings. Uh I was simply a uh uh you
[21:08] know a bunch of young fellows. I was 14
[21:10] at that time and we were interested in
[21:12] you know kind of enjoying one another's
[21:15] company with a bunch of other young
[21:16] fellows. One of them was Billy Paul. I
[21:18] met Billy Paul there. I just understood
[21:20] this is brother Brandham's son and we
[21:23] were about the same age. I'm a little
[21:24] bit older than him just not very much.
[21:26] And so, oh, there was half a dozen of us
[21:29] or so from the States and Canada and and
[21:32] uh kind of enjoying one another's
[21:33] company. But when we came into the
[21:35] meeting and we're sitting up in the
[21:36] bleachers, you know, and maybe not all
[21:38] that respectful and all, but when we
[21:40] came into the meeting and then Ern
[21:43] Baxter, who was brother Brandham's first
[21:45] manager, I believe, he came forward, he
[21:47] explained the ministry. He said that an
[21:50] angel from God had come and delivered
[21:52] this ministry to William Brandham. That
[21:54] well, that caught my attention. And I
[21:56] thought, my, I've heard about angels.
[21:58] And Sunday school teachers told me about
[22:00] angels, but I'm I'm going to see a man
[22:02] in a few minutes that actually talked to
[22:04] an angel. And then Brother Brandham came
[22:06] walking out from be from behind the
[22:09] curtain and just a slight small man and
[22:12] about about my height and and slimmer.
[22:16] and he just walked out and he was just
[22:18] so uh such an uh a radiance of humility
[22:24] that came from him and he just greet the
[22:26] people. How do you do friends? And then
[22:28] he began to speak to the people about
[22:31] the ministry and explained a little bit.
[22:33] He didn't really preach. He just talked
[22:35] about it and then uh sought to build
[22:38] faith and then called the prayer line.
[22:41] Well, I believe it was about the third
[22:43] night and I I thought this ministry is
[22:46] really different. This is different from
[22:48] anything I've seen. So, I'd like to get
[22:50] close to the front. They had a main
[22:53] island in that auditorium. There was
[22:54] about 6,000 people gathering in the
[22:57] weekdays and around 8,000 on the
[22:59] weekend.
[23:01] On this day, I got a seat about three
[23:05] rows from the front right on the aisle
[23:07] right in the middle. So I'd be about as
[23:10] close as the this brother right here to
[23:12] the front. And brother Brandham came out
[23:16] and the line was called I can't remember
[23:18] what was preached but this I'll never
[23:20] remember and never forget rather so I
[23:23] share it with you. And uh I believe it
[23:26] was a woman came up with a daughter. The
[23:29] girl was about 10 years old. She had a
[23:32] full round kind of uh face and ringlets
[23:36] coming down to her shoulders.
[23:39] and and she was blind. She was blind in
[23:42] that the fronts of her eyes were only
[23:45] white. Just white. All you could see was
[23:48] the white of her eyes. As I looked at
[23:50] her, I was that close. I could see that
[23:53] up here, right just here at the top,
[23:56] there's a little bit of the ball of the
[23:58] eye appeared. Just a little thin sliver.
[24:01] And it seemed that her eyes were twisted
[24:02] right up into her head. And it was it
[24:06] was such a sorry sight. And brother
[24:08] Brandham looked at her. He was he was
[24:10] standing like this and he looked at her.
[24:12] He didn't need to discern anything. So
[24:14] he just laid his hands on her head and
[24:17] he he prayed for her and then he looked
[24:19] at her and she was the same. So he
[24:22] prayed for her again and and he looked
[24:25] at her and he prayed for her again and
[24:27] looked at her and now I was counting
[24:29] three times, four times, five times. And
[24:33] about this time I thought, "No, this is
[24:36] like all the other ministers, you know,
[24:39] when it's something inside your your
[24:41] kidneys are healed and your stomach is
[24:44] healed and something else. Now here's
[24:45] something that's visible. I'm sitting up
[24:48] here. this is my chance to see it and I
[24:51] nothing's happening. He prayed five
[24:54] times. He prayed six times. Then he did
[24:56] something that I'll never forget. All
[24:59] the days of my life when he looked after
[25:02] that time nothing had happened. He put
[25:04] his arms around her head like that and
[25:07] just pressed her her head to his bosom
[25:09] like this. And he prayed this prayer. He
[25:12] said, "Satan,
[25:14] an angel from God, has ministered this
[25:17] gift to me and has said that if I can
[25:20] get the people to believe, nothing would
[25:23] stand before my prayers, not even
[25:26] cancer, the people are here and they are
[25:29] a believing, I adure you in the name of
[25:31] the living God to loose her and let her
[25:34] go." And he took her by the shoulders
[25:35] and turned her around like this and her
[25:37] eyes were as straight as mine.
[25:41] And then
[25:43] she she began to look up at the bright
[25:46] lights because she hadn't seen she began
[25:48] to look at the lights and I saw her eyes
[25:50] filling with water cuz she wasn't used
[25:52] to the lights. And he picked her up like
[25:55] this and just uh showed her to the
[25:58] audience, the congregation. And of
[25:59] course, the place is just going, you can
[26:02] imagine what what it's doing, just going
[26:04] wild.
[26:06] And then uh uh I would you know hear of
[26:09] brother Brandham as the time went by.
[26:12] Later on in my early 20s I became a
[26:15] pastor. Uh then uh uh my
[26:20] brother-in-law's brother became a
[26:22] missionary to Cuba and he was uh he was
[26:25] there at the time Castro was a rebel
[26:28] leader fighting in the mountains and
[26:31] another group another family from my
[26:33] church was missionary in Cuba as well.
[26:36] And so they would come back and forth uh
[26:39] to come home to take care of some things
[26:41] and then uh journey back to Cuba. So on
[26:44] the one visit my brother-in-law's
[26:46] brother came through. It was about 1957
[26:48] or 58 and brother Brandham in 57 had
[26:52] been in Tacoma. We had been in those
[26:54] meetings. I saw him call out an Indian
[26:56] boy that was 12 years old that was also
[26:58] blind. Told uh how long he'd been blind
[27:01] since he'd just been a few months old.
[27:04] Gave the names. Went right down the row
[27:06] and gave the names of his family
[27:07] members. His grandmother was sitting
[27:10] there. His parents were sitting there.
[27:12] And I saw the boy the next night uh
[27:14] walking to the water fountain. So these
[27:17] things were uh we were trying to stay a
[27:19] breast of what God was doing and a great
[27:21] move. And I'd get Tommy Osbbor's uh
[27:25] campaign meetings and native evangelism.
[27:28] He began with that concept and I even
[27:31] supported one of his missionaries, one
[27:33] of his native ministers. And then uh my
[27:38] brother-in-law's brother came back home
[27:41] to spend some time and I was in the
[27:43] midst of building uh a little house. He
[27:45] was helping me and I remember we were
[27:47] carrying a timber across the floor and
[27:50] he said to me, he said he was a man of
[27:53] very few words, a man of incredible
[27:56] integrity and who would not speak
[27:58] lightly of the things that God was doing
[28:00] at that time. He he he said have you
[28:03] heard what brother Brandham is teaching
[28:06] uh now? And I said no. I said I really
[28:10] haven't heard much from the outside. We
[28:12] call it the outside because we felt so
[28:14] buried and so uh isolated in the north
[28:18] country. Uh in fact is he did not know
[28:21] what was going on in my heart. But I had
[28:23] begun to become disillusioned with even
[28:27] in 57 and 58 with what I saw in
[28:29] Pentecost with what I saw with other
[28:32] ministers that were I was acquainted
[28:35] with. And I begin to see a a a
[28:39] fragmentation
[28:40] of the great ministries. I was seeing
[28:42] them one go to education, one go to
[28:46] money, one go to big things. And it
[28:48] seemed to me that this great move of God
[28:51] which had started about 10 years before
[28:54] was changing in its character and was
[28:58] very troubling to me. And so when he
[29:01] said to me, "Have you heard what brother
[29:03] Brandham's teaching?" It was just like a
[29:06] great lead ball weight went down inside
[29:10] of me. And I said, "No, I haven't had
[29:12] much contact." He said something about
[29:17] uh Cain being the son of the serpent.
[29:19] And I said, "What? Where would he get
[29:23] that?" He said, "I don't know." And that
[29:27] was the end of our conversation. And it
[29:30] was just dropped. And I thought, "Oh,
[29:32] God." You know, uh I always had thought
[29:36] that Brother Brandham was something
[29:37] special because of the angel visitation
[29:40] and because of what I had heard. And so
[29:44] I had that in my heart.
[29:47] As time went on, the next 2 or 3 years
[29:51] uh I had a man in my home who has who
[29:55] has set up quite a few meetings for
[29:56] brother Brandham. His name was AW
[29:58] Rasmmanson and uh he was over an
[30:01] independent fellowship of Pentecostal
[30:03] churches and Matson Boz who you hear
[30:07] about a great deal about on the message
[30:09] tapes. Matson Bose AW Raspersonson they
[30:13] were very very dear friends and that was
[30:15] another part of this loose arrangement
[30:18] of Pentecostal a non-denominational
[30:21] brethren that were receiving brother
[30:23] Brandham he was in my home only once it
[30:27] so happened at that very evening that we
[30:30] see the predestination of God brother
[30:32] Bud Southwick who later became brother
[30:35] Brandham's guide he actually brother Bud
[30:38] and I were just old friends. And brother
[30:42] Bud's wife had been a Christian, trying
[30:44] to live a Christian life, had five sons
[30:47] in quick succession, one after the
[30:49] other. And she and Bud came down to our
[30:54] little church in Dawson Creek. We were
[30:56] worshiping in a basement then, trying to
[30:58] build a new church. And I preached and
[31:01] called for those that may want to be
[31:04] saved. And brother Bud, he just walked
[31:06] forward, knelt on the concrete, his five
[31:09] little sons right beside him, and he
[31:12] gave his life to Christ. Well, from that
[31:14] time, each time he came into town to
[31:17] sell cattle or to sell some grain, he
[31:20] would stay at our place. That was his
[31:22] home. And it got too cold one time and
[31:25] he had a car that didn't hardly
[31:27] Volkswagen almost froze to death in it
[31:29] about 35 below. And I said, "No, you
[31:32] must take my station wagon. you leave
[31:34] your car here. So he took the station
[31:36] wagon with he and his wife and then and
[31:38] then on another trip he arrives back and
[31:40] and AW Rasperson's my home and we're
[31:43] having a Wednesday night service and so
[31:46] Bud was very very sick with with puricy
[31:50] or uh something in his throat. He was
[31:53] terribly sick and infected. And so after
[31:57] the service, we prayed for him in my
[31:59] house. And then he sat and had some tea
[32:04] and he began to tell us how he couldn't
[32:07] understand how the government of British
[32:09] Columbia is determined to give him a
[32:12] great hunting territory that belonged to
[32:14] a family of Indians called McDonald's.
[32:18] They had taken a white man's name. And
[32:21] uh this family uh they said they big
[32:24] family around 17 children and the sons
[32:27] were not harvesting the game properly.
[32:30] The government was interested that the
[32:32] game would be harvested correctly. So
[32:34] they wanted to give it to a licensed
[32:36] guide. It so happened the man whose uh
[32:40] whose jurisdiction this was knew of
[32:43] brother Bud and Bud was a rancher had a
[32:45] couple hundred head of horses and was
[32:48] 350 miles from this place but he said I
[32:52] can't understand why he you know
[32:54] selected me and it just so happened he
[32:56] was kind of pouring that out to me while
[32:59] brother Raspersonson was listening and
[33:02] brother Raspersonson said
[33:05] he said brother Brother Biscll, he said,
[33:08] "You should write Brother Brandham and
[33:10] see if you could entice him to come up
[33:13] for a hunt." He said, "You know, maybe
[33:16] you could arrange to have some meetings
[33:18] and take him up hunting, you know, and
[33:20] and get get both accomplished at one
[33:23] time." And uh to me, Brother Brandon was
[33:26] a man as, you know, whose stature was of
[33:29] worldrenowned.
[33:31] And for me to scratch a little pencil
[33:33] letter to him, uh I I didn't think I'd
[33:36] ever get an answer if I did write. But
[33:38] anyway, and the next day or two, I
[33:40] scratched out a little letter, told
[33:42] Brother Brandham about the kind of
[33:44] territory that this was, and Bud said he
[33:47] was going to be getting it. He he
[33:49] thought that he would go ahead and do
[33:50] it. And uh so I wrote a letter to
[33:52] Brother Brandom and never got an answer.
[33:55] Months went by and never got an answer.
[33:59] year and a half later
[34:01] uh uh we resigned the church and
[34:05] journeyed south to near where we are now
[34:07] onto Vancouver Island to do missionary
[34:10] work amongst the native Indian people.
[34:12] And I was only there three weeks when I
[34:15] got a letter from brother Brandham
[34:17] actually from Billy Paul saying that uh
[34:20] brother Brandham would like to come up
[34:22] and hunt. So we made contact by
[34:24] telephone and spoke a little bit. I
[34:27] wrote back. They asked if we could if I
[34:29] could arrange three meetings in Grand
[34:32] Prairie, Alberta, which is about 75
[34:35] miles from Dawson Creek and three in
[34:36] Dawson Creek. So, we arranged those
[34:39] meetings and then I journeyied up. They
[34:42] came all the way from Jeffersonville and
[34:44] I came up for the west coast of
[34:46] Vancouver and uh came to they told me
[34:49] what motel he was in and uh so I went to
[34:52] the motel. I had Billy Paul's uh hotel
[34:56] number or motel number first. I went to
[34:58] his motel and he said, "Oh yes, brother
[35:00] Biscll." He said, "Daddy's waiting to
[35:02] see you." So we went up. It was a
[35:04] double-decker motel. Went upstairs. The
[35:07] door was a jar. And Billy just kind of
[35:10] knocked on the door and opened it a wee
[35:11] bit. He said, "Daddy, uh, Brother
[35:13] Biscll's here." "Oh, fine." I heard the
[35:16] voice say, "Bring him in." So Billy Paul
[35:19] swung the door open and I just stepped
[35:21] in the door. I was 27 years old and uh
[35:24] and and as skinny as a rake. I weighed
[35:27] 135 lbs and uh I'm sure it was a shock
[35:30] to brother Brennham, but I didn't expect
[35:32] it was going to be the shock that it
[35:34] was. So, and I just stepped in the door
[35:36] and he's sitting on the edge of the bed
[35:38] and he just kind of rocked back, put his
[35:40] finger up. He says, his eyes went large.
[35:42] He said, "Are you brother Biscll?" I
[35:46] said, "Uh, yes, sir, I am." Oh. He says,
[35:50] "You're just a child."
[35:55] And I said, "Well,
[35:57] that's what I am." I said, "That's
[35:59] that's all I am. This is what you got."
[36:02] Oh. And then he kind of laughed, made a
[36:03] little joke out of it. And and uh so we
[36:06] we uh you know, just chatted about a few
[36:09] things and then he had three meetings
[36:11] there in Grand Prairie. Then we
[36:14] journeyed up to Dawson Creek where three
[36:16] more meetings were arranged.
[36:19] Now, uh, there was a brother here, uh,
[36:22] night before last. I don't know if
[36:23] Brother Bill Haggot is here. A lot of
[36:25] people perhaps know Brother Bill. Uh,
[36:28] are you here, Brother Haggett? I guess
[36:30] he had to go back, I believe, yesterday.
[36:33] Brother Bill Haggot was in the Canadian
[36:35] Army and was in those meetings in Dawson
[36:39] Creek.
[36:40] And so that plays an important part in
[36:43] the in part of this story. I as a boy
[36:46] had been raised during the building of
[36:49] the Alaskan Highway which was built by
[36:51] the US Army engineers. And so my father
[36:54] worked every camp was under the a
[36:57] captain of the US Army. So I saw all
[37:00] through my youth and up into my early
[37:03] teens US Army officers. I was their
[37:06] mascot. I was their I was their bat boy
[37:10] at their at the army team. Even though I
[37:12] was Canadian, I was rooting for the US
[37:15] Army because that's where I lived. Uh I
[37:17] slept in the dormitories with the boys.
[37:20] They put up a rifle up against the door.
[37:22] Uh you know, I rode with them in the
[37:24] jeeps and was with them at the airport
[37:26] and going on their snowmobile machines.
[37:29] And of course that was like the life of
[37:31] Riley, you might think. You know, didn't
[37:33] get much education, but I sure had a lot
[37:36] of fun, you know. And uh so
[37:40] at this meeting in 1961, a lot of years
[37:44] had gone by and the people are packing
[37:46] in the the doorway coming in the foyer
[37:50] and I happened to see a just a uniform
[37:55] uh staff sergeant uh a US Army uniform
[38:00] just a ju just a jacket. Didn't seem
[38:02] that he had the trousers on. And at that
[38:05] time, starting in the 1960s, it became
[38:08] popular for people to buy surplus uh
[38:12] army clothing and young people were
[38:14] wearing it. So, I didn't know if he's
[38:15] for real or whether he's not real, you
[38:19] know, maybe just a young fellow on a
[38:20] with a uniform, but I I I looked through
[38:23] the crowd. I remember looking through
[38:24] the crowd so I could see those stripes.
[38:26] And I I just thought to myself, it's
[38:29] nice to see them stripes again like
[38:31] that. And uh it just kind of brought
[38:33] back a flood of memories.
[38:36] The services were started then and I was
[38:40] seated on the platform over to this
[38:42] side. Uh and and a lot of the people now
[38:45] who I've been away from for a year and a
[38:47] half, some of them my own congregation
[38:50] started to come up in the healing line.
[38:53] One woman, her name was Sister Lick, L I
[38:56] C K. Very unusual name. And of all the
[39:00] people that brother Brandham called, he
[39:02] calls her by name. He said, "Go your
[39:04] ways, Mrs. Lick." And he told all about
[39:08] her child, nervous child, the condition
[39:10] of the family because of it. It was
[39:13] exactly the same. Uh exactly as he
[39:16] described it. Then there was a long line
[39:19] of people that were up for healing.
[39:22] Didn't look like they were, Brother
[39:23] Brandham was going to get through the
[39:24] mall, and it was still lined up against
[39:27] the wall down there.
[39:30] Brother Brandon was standing here with
[39:31] his back this way and we were standing
[39:34] also and I don't know whe because it was
[39:36] the end he'd come to the end and we were
[39:39] singing I can't recall exactly but I was
[39:42] standing
[39:44] uh and right next to me on my on my
[39:47] right hand side was a a very
[39:50] intellectual theologian man whose pastor
[39:54] in Grand Prairie the city we just come
[39:56] from. His name was Paul Cornish. And as
[39:59] we stood there, Brother Brandham, he's
[40:02] got his back to us. He just all I can
[40:04] do, I'll just describe exactly what
[40:06] happened. He's talking to somebody like
[40:08] this is the boy will be all right. Then
[40:11] just carried on. Now, I couldn't
[40:14] understand what he said. And it wasn't a
[40:17] voice. It wasn't that he startled me,
[40:19] but there actually was a movement, a
[40:22] presence that just went like that. And
[40:25] when that happened, it startled me. I I
[40:28] didn't know what was happening. I didn't
[40:30] know what he had said. And the man
[40:31] beside me, who is a very stately
[40:34] statesman type of man, he had it just it
[40:37] like somebody had hit him in the stomach
[40:39] and he went over forward. He was bent
[40:42] right in. He was sobbing, sobbing,
[40:46] sobbing. I thought, "What's happening?
[40:48] What's happening? What was sad?" You
[40:51] know, and I'm totally startled. I'm
[40:53] absolutely dismayed. Something has swept
[40:56] past me. I know that this man who you
[40:58] very seldomly get a movement out of him
[41:00] here. He's caving into the floor
[41:02] weeping. Brother Brandham has screamed
[41:04] something. I don't know what is it. What
[41:06] what what's taking place? When brother
[41:08] Cornish stood up, he touched me on my
[41:12] elbow. He said, "Brother Eddie," he
[41:15] said, "See down the healing line down
[41:17] towards the end. See that young boy?" I
[41:19] said, "Yes." He said, "That's my son."
[41:22] And he said if he's not healed, he's up
[41:25] for operation on Tuesday morning, this
[41:28] coming Tuesday morning. And here,
[41:30] Brother Brandham just what he said was,
[41:32] "The boy will be all right."
[41:35] &gt;&gt; And that thing just swept by. You see,
[41:37] friends, he was in a he was in a realm
[41:40] &gt;&gt; that we know nothing about. the best I
[41:43] can explain it to you on deep calls to
[41:46] the deep if you haven't seen that v
[41:49] video that picture you young people get
[41:52] that right away when you've done with
[41:54] brother Biscll's testimony because on
[41:56] there he says now how many people dream
[41:59] dreams and he said now there are some
[42:03] that don't dream dreams he said when you
[42:05] dream a dream he said your conscious is
[42:07] over here your subconscious is here when
[42:10] you dream a dream you kind of go to that
[42:12] twilight night zone, the conscious and
[42:14] the subconscious come close together. He
[42:16] said there are some people don't dream
[42:18] dreams because he says their
[42:20] subconscious and their conscious remain
[42:22] too far apart and they don't dream
[42:24] dreams. He said they're born that way.
[42:27] He said then those that dream dreams,
[42:29] the conscious and the subconscious move
[42:31] close together. But he said with a
[42:33] prophet they come right together. He
[42:36] doesn't go to sleep to see his dream.
[42:39] See that's his that's the vision. They
[42:41] come right together. So he's But now if
[42:44] you have a dream, you wake up in the
[42:46] morning, say, "Dear, I had a dream." Oh,
[42:48] the most incredible dream. Science
[42:51] proves to you you had that dream in
[42:53] about a quarter of a second. As fast as
[42:55] I snap my finger, you had the whole
[42:57] dream. But in real time, it takes you 10
[43:00] or 15 minutes to tell the dream. You
[43:03] understand? So now, here's a prophet
[43:05] with those both right together. And he
[43:08] told me, he said, "Sometimes, brother
[43:10] Eddie, before I come out, he said, he's
[43:12] shown me that there'll be a woman up in
[43:14] the balcony in a yellow coat, and
[43:16] there's a man down here in the middle,
[43:18] and the demon that's in her is going to
[43:20] link up with the demon that's in this
[43:21] man. They're going to war against you.
[43:24] Have no fear. I'll be with you." And and
[43:27] so many details would just just flood
[43:30] his the human mind can't take it. It's
[43:33] just like in your subconscious. You see
[43:34] all this, you see it in just a fraction
[43:36] of a second, but you can't relate it.
[43:39] So, brother Brandham had to go slowly
[43:41] and tell these people these things. He
[43:43] knew, he knew volumes of it before he
[43:47] even came. And a vision wasn't as though
[43:49] he's seeing a scene in technicolor.
[43:52] Please understand this. His visions were
[43:55] that he had stepped into another realm.
[43:58] He was actually there.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; And that's why he wouldn't know I I is
[44:05] this a patient. He didn't know if he was
[44:07] in reality and this was a person or was
[44:10] he in the vision? Because in the vision
[44:12] the person was just the same. He he told
[44:15] me about the man in Bombay. You excuse I
[44:17] just have to keep relating these things
[44:19] as they come. The man in Bombay that was
[44:21] healed. He said he saw the man and he
[44:25] was a sun worshipper and his eyes were
[44:27] destroyed. But he said to me he said uh
[44:31] I I I saw him. I I saw him start to
[44:34] move. I could see in the vision that he
[44:37] could see. He said then I had to he had
[44:40] to kind of come out of it. He said, and
[44:42] because he said in the vision, in the
[44:45] vision his he saw noticed that he was
[44:48] going a little gray right here at the
[44:50] temples with his with a sideburn and and
[44:53] and then he kind of shake his head and
[44:55] looked in the real reality where he was
[44:58] in the present and he saw that his
[45:00] sideburns were black. So he said, "I
[45:03] knew that he was going to have his
[45:05] vision." He said, "Then I had to
[45:07] exercise my faith that he would be
[45:09] healed right then. Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And God gave him his sight right then.
[45:14] And there was even hundreds of soldiers
[45:16] and everything else could hardly protect
[45:17] Brother Brandham. He told me they tried
[45:19] to tear his pants in little pieces so
[45:21] he'd have some part something that had
[45:23] touched him because they're very given
[45:25] over to holy men and those things. But
[45:27] you see that was the that was the realm
[45:29] that he was in. And so he he could call
[45:33] something out and and you'll hear it on
[45:35] the tape once in a while. You want to
[45:36] hear the Dawson Creek series right in
[45:38] the middle while he's preaching. He just
[45:40] calls out. He says, "That's all right,
[45:42] Mr. Durnney. That's all right. Don't
[45:45] worry about it." He's on another one. I
[45:47] believe he calls to Brother Banks Woods
[45:49] or one of the people from Jeffersonville
[45:51] and he's over in Phoenix or Tucson. And
[45:54] he just calls out right while he's
[45:55] preaching. Don't worry about it. It's
[45:57] going to be all right. He gives him the
[45:59] name right while he's preaching because
[46:01] he's into another realm and he's reach
[46:04] picking this up and picking that up and
[46:06] he just can't pick it all up. Oh, it's
[46:07] all getting milky now. just moving from
[46:10] here to there to everywhere. Oh my
[46:12] brother, my sister, no nation, no
[46:15] people, no generation ever had such a
[46:18] vindication as this one. How we ought to
[46:22] No young people, no young people have
[46:25] ever been brought up to to know these
[46:28] things. And you're hearing it from a
[46:30] living witness. We were there. And so
[46:33] while these meetings are going on also
[46:36] in a very similar, this is one of the
[46:38] main parts of of my testimony. Many
[46:40] people have asked me about it.
[46:44] We're in a service at the end of a
[46:46] meeting and uh we're singing
[46:50] uh uh I love him. I love him. And
[46:54] brother Brandham is leading him in song
[46:57] saying I love him.
[47:00] I love him. You can hear the people
[47:04] singing sweetly. You can get the tape.
[47:06] It's a Dawson Creek tape. And while the
[47:08] people are singing, he says, "Do you
[47:11] love him?" Like that. And they just keep
[47:13] singing. Then he says, "You'll not
[47:16] commit suicide, soldier boy. That's the
[47:20] devil talking to you. Deny him. Deny
[47:24] him. And you'll go home and be a real
[47:27] man and be a real gentleman.
[47:30] because he first loved me.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; I mean friends from another world,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; from another realm.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; And the service services ended in Dawson
[47:45] Creek. And uh oh uh then brother
[47:48] Brennham uh he said to me on one one of
[47:51] our occasions between the meetings, he
[47:53] said, "Could brother Chris Berg you
[47:56] think brother Chris Berg would come with
[47:57] us?" Now, brother Chris Berg had been on
[48:00] an earlier hunt uh in about 1949,
[48:05] 1950, something like that. Brother
[48:07] Chrisberg
[48:08] was a man who I believe Brother Brandham
[48:12] had he not had the ministry he had, he
[48:15] aspired to live that kind of life.
[48:18] Brother Chris Berg was a man totally of
[48:20] the wilderness. He never married. He
[48:24] would just put a pack on his back and be
[48:26] gone. He'd be gone sometime for weeks,
[48:29] come back out, he trapped, he fished. He
[48:33] was one of what he called his little
[48:35] Norwegian friends. Brother Chris was a
[48:37] little bit shorter than Brother
[48:38] Brandham, but about the right height.
[48:41] And so I said, "My wife and I have known
[48:44] Chris since we were children." I said,
[48:45] "Oh." I said, "Hey,
[48:48] Chris, he'd just drop everything. Of
[48:50] course, he'll come." So I got a hold of
[48:52] Brother Chris Berg. says, "Brother
[48:53] Brandon, I'd like you to come." And
[48:55] that'll make four of us. Chris and
[48:57] myself, Brother Brandham, Brother Bud.
[49:00] So, uh, Monday morning, we decide, uh,
[49:03] no one knows where I'm taking Brother
[49:05] Brandham except Brother Bud Southwick,
[49:07] who's 400 miles away, and Brother Chris
[49:09] Berg, and he's not sure where I'm taking
[49:11] him. So, Monday morning, we decide we'll
[49:13] leave real early, about 5 or so in the
[49:16] morning. Oh, yes. One other thing that
[49:19] happened. Uh uh there was a sister that
[49:22] came that time. They they brought the
[49:24] line up this way because there was three
[49:26] meetings and they brought brought her up
[49:28] this way and uh she was a German woman
[49:31] by the name of sister Clint. Uh they
[49:34] lived in Fort St. John. They are very
[49:37] very dear friends of my parents
[49:39] especially my father but they were in
[49:41] our home many times uh in my church many
[49:45] times and they were actually in my
[49:46] brother-in-law's church. They were part
[49:48] of his church. They were old-timers from
[49:50] that country. So, she was standing
[49:52] there. I'll never forget, she was
[49:53] standing with her hand folded just like
[49:55] so. And uh, Brother Brandham said to
[49:59] her, "You're you're not standing here
[50:02] for yourself. You're standing here for a
[50:06] man." And that man is shadowed with
[50:09] death. That man is not from this city. I
[50:14] believe he's from a town north of here.
[50:17] and that town is called Fort St. John.
[50:22] And that's the way he said it. And then
[50:24] he told her just to go her way. He
[50:26] didn't say anything more. So now comes
[50:29] Monday morning. And we leave like maybe
[50:32] 5 in the morning. I think we got up
[50:34] about 4:30, left about 5. And there, of
[50:36] course, the morning, you know, the days
[50:38] break real early and the nights are are
[50:41] light real late. So we start driving
[50:44] Fort St. John's about 42 miles from
[50:47] where the meetings were. So in the first
[50:49] hour, we were just coming up to the
[50:52] town. When the US Army built the Alaskan
[50:54] Highway, they just pushed it right
[50:56] through farm fields and everything else.
[50:58] And the towns grew alongside of the
[51:01] highway, just little sparse businesses.
[51:03] So we were coming to Fort St. John.
[51:05] There's this speed limit on the highway
[51:07] because they had built some gas stations
[51:09] and a motel here and there. And it had
[51:11] the highway cut through a farm and a big
[51:13] old farmhouse which I'd seen ever since
[51:16] I was just a little kid sat over about
[51:18] 200 yards to the right hand side and
[51:20] that was the first entrance into the
[51:22] town. There was two entrances into Fort
[51:24] St. John off the highway and we were
[51:26] just coming up to the first entrance. We
[51:28] were not going into the town. We were
[51:30] bypassing it. And brother Brandham said
[51:32] to me
[51:34] uh he said there was a woman that was
[51:36] praying for a man uh yesterday in the
[51:39] meeting and uh he said she was praying
[51:43] for a man from Fort St. John uh dying
[51:46] with cancer. I said that's exactly
[51:48] right. Her name is Sister Clint. And I
[51:51] was so happy to tell brother Brandham we
[51:53] know her. And and I'm just in the middle
[51:56] of that and he's saying the man's in
[51:58] that house.
[52:00] He says it with that same
[52:03] that same intensity and then and then
[52:07] soon as he's out of it, he's just
[52:09] speaking normally again, but he just
[52:10] went like that and and because we were
[52:12] driving by, he had to swing his arm
[52:14] behind my head. He says, "The man's in
[52:16] that house." He pointed to that white
[52:19] house. Well, right away, you know, the
[52:21] devil, he is a he he he he he's a very
[52:25] aggressive,
[52:28] &gt;&gt; very aggressive uh adversary.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And so, right away, the thought flashed
[52:33] through my mind. You can't control the
[52:34] thoughts. Thought just flashed through
[52:36] my mind. How do I know he's in that
[52:38] house?
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; I didn't know he's in the house, but I
[52:42] was certain he was there because I saw
[52:44] that gift. I saw him reveal what was in
[52:46] Sister Clunk's heart. So, we journey on
[52:49] through and we get up to uh 300 miles.
[52:53] Uh there's a small town, Fort Nelson, if
[52:56] you look on your map. And so I said to
[52:59] Brother Brandham, maybe we should just
[53:00] pull off here and have a bite to eat by
[53:03] the time we get up to Southwick's place.
[53:05] It'll be about 2:00. She'll be all done
[53:07] her meal and we won't have a chance to
[53:11] uh we you know, I don't want to disturb
[53:13] her for dinner. Oh, he said, "I think
[53:14] that's a good idea, Brother Eddie." So,
[53:16] we pulled off and got into this little
[53:18] wee uh hotel type restaurant and uh
[53:22] we're just sitting there and now brother
[53:23] Brown's relaxing and you know we're kind
[53:26] of talking and laughing about things and
[53:28] he's just u uh feeling you know uh the
[53:32] pressure of the meeting is all gone and
[53:34] the waitress had come. We ordered our
[53:36] food and nothing had arrived yet and uh
[53:40] the door opened. uh door was on the side
[53:43] like that open. In walked two men and
[53:45] the one man I had never seen before. He
[53:47] was uh um perhaps a little shorter than
[53:50] myself and quite heavy set, light
[53:53] colored sandy hair, but behind him was
[53:56] this tall young man that was in the US
[53:59] Army tunic that I saw in the foyer of
[54:04] the church. Only now he's in strictly
[54:07] civilian clothes and his he's tall. He's
[54:11] uh fairly dark complexed. His eyes were
[54:15] deep set. His skin was very taut. His
[54:19] face was very very taut. I noticed. And
[54:22] when he came in, he come in slightly
[54:24] behind the the the other man. And then
[54:28] he moved around and as they were moving
[54:30] like I just thought they're going to get
[54:32] a table. So I said, "Fancy seeing you
[54:35] here." And brother Brandham looked up
[54:37] like this as they were coming by our our
[54:39] booth. He thought
[54:45] he thought that they were old friends of
[54:47] mine and uh uh and then this excuse me,
[54:51] brethren, hope that didn't
[54:56] because I was meeting a lot of my old
[54:58] friends. And so,
[55:01] uh, then this sandyhaired man squeezed
[55:04] between,
[55:06] uh, this young soldier boy and our table
[55:09] and thrust his hand down at brother
[55:10] Brandham. He says, "Oh, Brother
[55:11] Brandham." He said, "Brother Brandham."
[55:13] And, and Brother Brandham was kind of
[55:15] shocked, you know, and he he raised his
[55:16] hand kind of uncertainly and and uh, oh,
[55:19] oh, do I know you? No, no. He says, "You
[55:21] don't know me." And now he's shaking his
[55:22] hand. He said, "Do you remember saying
[55:24] to that soldier boy, you spoke to that
[55:26] soldier boy?" And he's shaking his hand
[55:27] like that. And brother Bram said, "Uh uh
[55:30] uh do you remember, Brother Eddie?" I
[55:31] said, 'Yes, I remember. You said, "Uh,
[55:34] you'll not commit suicide, soldier boy.
[55:36] That's the devil." "That's it. That's
[55:38] it." He says, "That's what you said.
[55:39] That's what you said." He says, "This is
[55:41] him." And uh so, uh uh
[55:46] you know, the greeting was kind of over.
[55:48] And then he said, "Brother Brandham,
[55:50] would you pray for him?" And brother
[55:52] Brandon said, "Oh, sure I would." Just
[55:55] at that moment, we're right in the midst
[55:56] of that, uh, the waitress came.
[55:59] Waitress, they're not interested in what
[56:00] you're talking about. You know, here I
[56:03] was ready for this prophet to cast the
[56:04] devil out of this fellow. And the
[56:06] waitress is barging in with our soup and
[56:09] sliding the soup here to all all four of
[56:11] us, you know, like that. And uh, or
[56:13] three of us, I should say. And so,
[56:16] Brother Brandham sees the soup come in
[56:17] front of him. Well, now you see, I I had
[56:20] told you I was looking at Brother
[56:21] Brenham to see if he would act like a
[56:23] preacher.
[56:25] And now I was looking to see if he'd at
[56:26] least act like a prophet, you know,
[56:29] because we have our concepts of what
[56:30] preachers should do and our concepts of
[56:33] what a prophet should do. And I was
[56:35] certainly expecting uh well, I didn't
[56:38] know what to expect, but I knew it was
[56:39] going to be something spectacular. And
[56:42] here's a fellow trying to commit
[56:43] suicide, a soldier boy. The Holy Spirit
[56:47] screamed out to him. And here we are. I
[56:49] don't know how they arrived here. Here
[56:50] we all meet 300 miles from where we had
[56:54] had the meeting. Nobody knew that I was
[56:56] taking brother Brandham here. How did
[56:58] they ever find us in the middle of this?
[57:00] From that spot, friends, you could take
[57:04] a vehicle at that time and you could go
[57:06] to the straight north for 1500 miles and
[57:09] I doubt if you'd have ever seen a road
[57:12] or a human. And you could have gone down
[57:15] the Rocky Mountain trench for 500 miles
[57:18] and you might have found a trapper or a
[57:20] logger someplace, but that's about all.
[57:22] And in the middle, you talk about a
[57:24] needle in the hay stack. In the middle
[57:27] there, he is meeting up with that boy he
[57:30] called out of the service. And this man
[57:33] says, "We drove from Fairbanks, Alaska,
[57:36] and the army officer doctors turned him
[57:39] into my custody to take him to your
[57:42] meetings, but we couldn't get him into
[57:43] prayer line." He said, "And we're
[57:45] driving an old pickup. You passed us on
[57:48] the road, but he said, I believe that we
[57:50] would find you today." And then the
[57:52] soldier spoke up. He says, "That's
[57:54] right. This man actually believed."
[57:57] And he was saying it in such unbelief.
[57:59] He says he actually believed we'd find
[58:01] you today. And here they found us in the
[58:03] middle of nowhere sitting in a little
[58:06] restaurant ready to have some soup. And
[58:08] so I'm waiting for brother Brandham's
[58:10] great dramatic gesture to cast the
[58:12] devils out of this fellow. And brother
[58:14] Brandham says, "Well, well that's fine.
[58:16] Yeah, uh, I'll be happy to pray for
[58:18] him." He said, "Maybe we'll just eat our
[58:20] soup first." I thought,
[58:29] Do you remember Apostle Paul had that
[58:32] woman with with the spirit of divination
[58:35] crying out, "Hear ye these men. These
[58:38] men be of God. Hear ye these men. These
[58:40] men be of God." You know how long he
[58:42] left that? Three days.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know why? He needed the
[58:46] advertising.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; When he was done, he cast the devil out
[58:52] of her.
[58:54] And so this was in divine order. We'll
[58:56] eat our soup first and we'll tend to all
[58:58] of this later on. So we eat our meal.
[59:01] While we're eating our meal now, I see
[59:04] Brother Brandham's countenance change.
[59:06] His demeanor, his composure changes, and
[59:09] he just is eating his soup like this.
[59:12] He looks out, just looks a little bit
[59:14] over my head.
[59:16] He said, "There there was a woman that
[59:19] was in the prayer line yesterday.
[59:21] Uh, he said she was blind.
[59:25] I said, um, I don't remember a blind
[59:28] woman. I said, brother Chris, I said, '
[59:31] Do you remember anybody blind? Yes, he
[59:33] said, I believe there was a blind woman
[59:35] came through the healing line. And
[59:37] brother Brandham, he's just eating a
[59:38] soup. He looks up.
[59:42] Yes, he said. He's seeing it. See, he's
[59:44] there. He said, yes, she is blind. Let
[59:48] me see. He waits a moment. Oh, I see. He
[59:53] said, "She's being led through the line
[59:57] by another woman."
[59:59] Yes. He said, "And that young woman gave
[1:00:03] up her place in the line to lead the
[1:00:06] blind woman through." Glory.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And then he just shook his head looked
[1:00:10] at me. Now he was in time again. He
[1:00:14] said, "You see, brother Eddie," he said,
[1:00:16] "She may be praying just now."
[1:00:20] Think of that.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; She may be praying just now. And here
[1:00:24] God was using that prophet. Oh, that
[1:00:27] position. I, you know, we we scarcely
[1:00:30] can grasp it. And he said, uh, now he
[1:00:33] said, let's let let's see. Yes. He said,
[1:00:36] she's a young German woman. Now, he got
[1:00:38] back into it. Each time he got back into
[1:00:40] it, he got more. Yes, she's a young
[1:00:42] German woman. She had Oh, that poor
[1:00:46] woman. He said, she has heart trouble.
[1:00:49] She has stomach trouble. She has an is
[1:00:52] and he began to describe some internal
[1:00:54] difficulty she was having and and he
[1:00:57] came back out of it again and he said,
[1:00:59] "Brother Eddie, do you believe?" And
[1:01:02] here I had these humongous questions,
[1:01:05] doctrinal questions, serpent seed, God
[1:01:08] had baptism questions hanging in my
[1:01:11] heart. I tell you, I was doing
[1:01:13] everything I knew how to do to believe.
[1:01:16] I said, "Yes, Brother Brandham, I do
[1:01:18] believe." He said, "Brother Eddie, just
[1:01:20] to help you, I'll ask him, and he'll
[1:01:23] give me her name." He just looked over
[1:01:26] my head for a few moments.
[1:01:28] Yes. He said, "Her name is Sister Fear
[1:01:34] Fear." He said, "We'd say fear in
[1:01:36] English." Sister Fair. He said, "That's
[1:01:39] her name. That's right."
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; And it was all over.
[1:01:45] And then he said to me, he said, "You
[1:01:48] see, Brother Eddie, people don't
[1:01:51] understand, the people don't understand
[1:01:53] the visions. When they come, I can't
[1:01:56] stop them."
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And I says, "I can't start them." He
[1:02:00] said, "They think I have them. I don't.
[1:02:03] It's the people's faith that causes me
[1:02:05] to have visions." He said, "You see this
[1:02:07] young man here?" He said, "You know, who
[1:02:10] knows uh what would happen if God
[1:02:13] doesn't meet him?" And so he we finished
[1:02:16] eating our soup, finished eating our
[1:02:17] meal, just get ready to walk out the
[1:02:20] door and uh paid our bill, stepped out
[1:02:24] the door, and just as we're going out
[1:02:26] the door, this soldier tapped brother
[1:02:28] Brandham on the shoulder. Brother
[1:02:30] Brandham, he said, "Just two minutes.
[1:02:31] Just two minutes." Oh yes. Yes, brother.
[1:02:34] He thought we were going to get away.
[1:02:35] Certainly, he said. So we stepped out
[1:02:37] little wooden sidewalk. the this
[1:02:39] sidewalk went to the end of the
[1:02:41] buildings where there was some garbage
[1:02:42] cans and the bush started there just the
[1:02:45] brush the woods and this little wooden
[1:02:47] sidewalk went this way and there's where
[1:02:49] our cars were parked so brother
[1:02:51] Chrisberg myself and the sandyhaired man
[1:02:53] from Alaska went up there to the cars
[1:02:56] were just standing there and I turned
[1:02:58] around so I could watch brother Brandham
[1:03:00] and I was listening to him at the same
[1:03:02] time I wanted to see what is brother
[1:03:04] Brandham doing all the time see how's he
[1:03:06] responding to this I mean here here's
[1:03:08] fellow has tried to commit suicide.
[1:03:11] What's he doing? You know, and so
[1:03:15] after a moment, this man is nervously
[1:03:17] talking. He said, "Nobody can find out
[1:03:19] what's wrong with him." He said, "He's
[1:03:20] been under the uh under the uh army
[1:03:23] officers for 15 or 14 or 15 or 18
[1:03:27] months. I just can't recall now. For
[1:03:28] about 15 months, he's tried to commit
[1:03:30] suicide three times." He said, "Now,
[1:03:33] notice what he's telling me. He's got a
[1:03:35] lovely Christian wife and two beautiful
[1:03:37] children, but he's tried to commit
[1:03:39] suicide three times in the last 15
[1:03:42] months. And about that time, I looked up
[1:03:44] there, I saw Brother Brown now, that
[1:03:45] little white hat you see pictures of him
[1:03:47] with. Fact is, it's that hat he has on
[1:03:49] right there in the picture. He has that
[1:03:51] hat off and he's holding it over his
[1:03:53] heart like this, holding it down because
[1:03:55] that's the way he he would do when he
[1:03:56] was in prayer. And then then I saw I saw
[1:03:59] him just slip that hat back on and they
[1:04:01] both turn around. And when they turn
[1:04:03] around, I said within myself, because
[1:04:06] you must understand, I'm a disappointed,
[1:04:08] discouraged young minister, and I've
[1:04:11] seen too many the big ministries go
[1:04:14] down. And and and I didn't want to I had
[1:04:17] a great love for the word. Always the
[1:04:19] word. And I wasn't going to allow any
[1:04:22] signs and wonders to sweep me off my
[1:04:24] feet. It had to be in the word. And I
[1:04:27] had already resolved. If this serpent
[1:04:29] seed question couldn't be resolved in
[1:04:32] the word, that was going to mean the end
[1:04:34] of brother Brandham and my fellowship.
[1:04:36] And I that was just crushing me. And so
[1:04:38] I here I got this in my heart and I I
[1:04:41] said to within myself, now I I must not
[1:04:44] be swayed by the, you know, the the
[1:04:48] charis charisma
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; of of this. It's got to be genuine. And
[1:04:52] so when they were coming down, all I can
[1:04:55] tell you is it's genuine or I wouldn't
[1:04:56] be here. That tall fellow, his face had
[1:04:59] completely changed. His face and
[1:05:02] countenance had totally relaxed. It
[1:05:04] shone. And he came walking down the
[1:05:07] sidewalk. He said like this. And brother
[1:05:10] Brand walking very erect. He is under
[1:05:12] that anointing. This man says, "I'm
[1:05:15] free. I'm free. I'm free." Three times
[1:05:20] like that with his fist up in the air.
[1:05:22] And they came and stood and Brother
[1:05:24] Brandham was standing right beside me
[1:05:25] really wrecked. soldier right beside
[1:05:27] him, Brother Chris and other men
[1:05:29] standing there all in a little huddle.
[1:05:31] He said, "This man told me something
[1:05:34] that only I and my wife in this world
[1:05:37] know." And when he did tell me, he said,
[1:05:39] "It left me." Well, I was learning some
[1:05:42] incredible pressure. I mean, incredible
[1:05:45] principles. So, we said our goodbye.
[1:05:48] They went in their vehicle. We got in
[1:05:50] our vehicle. I'm sitting beside brother
[1:05:52] Brandham.
[1:05:54] The thought went through my mind. I have
[1:05:56] just stepped right out of the pages of
[1:05:58] the scripture.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; This is what happened in the Bible.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; See, I didn't really know even the depth
[1:06:05] of it all, but God was conditioning my
[1:06:08] heart. You have been right next to the
[1:06:11] ministry of Jesus Christ. You've just
[1:06:13] stepped out of the Bible. And I was in
[1:06:16] that atmosphere. Brother Brandham said,
[1:06:18] "Have you ever seen this young man?" I
[1:06:21] said, "No. Is he a good friend of
[1:06:22] yours?" I said, "We don't know each
[1:06:24] other." He said, 'It's not likely you'll
[1:06:26] ever see each other again.' I said,
[1:06:28] 'It's not likely. He said, 'Brother
[1:06:30] Eddie, if he was your friend, I'd never
[1:06:32] tell you, but just to help you believe.
[1:06:35] When we went to the end of the sidewalk,
[1:06:37] he said he came to us there and told him
[1:06:40] that he had a lovely Christian wife and
[1:06:43] two beautiful children, the same words
[1:06:46] that had just come out of the other
[1:06:47] man's mouth.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; You follow me? If brother Brandham had
[1:06:52] said that that that he came to us there
[1:06:54] and told us he wasn't married and didn't
[1:06:56] have any children or something, I
[1:06:58] wouldn't be here.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; There's exactly the same testimony. See,
[1:07:03] he's got he's married, got a lovely
[1:07:05] Christian wife and two beautiful
[1:07:06] children, but he's been committing
[1:07:08] homosexual acts with young men.
[1:07:12] He said, "And soon as he was told that,
[1:07:15] he was delivered."
[1:07:18] And I learned one of my greatest
[1:07:19] lessons. The best way to cast out a
[1:07:22] devil out of anybody's life is expose
[1:07:24] him.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; He holds his grip. Whether it be fear,
[1:07:32] whether it be despondency, whether it be
[1:07:35] some sin of some nature. And that's why
[1:07:37] the prophet's ministry was so powerful.
[1:07:40] That's why he said, "Don't come here
[1:07:41] with sin because it'll be exposed." But
[1:07:44] exposing it is the best way to get rid
[1:07:46] of it.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And all he did was expose it. Satan lost
[1:07:54] his power, lost his grip, and the boy
[1:07:56] went away free.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; We drove up the highway about 75 miles
[1:08:01] and came to Brother Southwick's place.
[1:08:04] And uh we had supper that evening and
[1:08:08] brother Brandon began to relate all the
[1:08:10] different things that took place and
[1:08:12] different
[1:08:14] great meetings. It was about 10:00. We
[1:08:17] sat there absolutely riveted for about 4
[1:08:22] hours. It's around 10:00 at night. He
[1:08:25] was just talking. He was sitting at the
[1:08:26] end of the table. I was sitting
[1:08:28] immediately here on the side and he just
[1:08:30] jerked quick. Jerked like that. said,
[1:08:33] "Brother Eddie, that pillar of fire
[1:08:36] isn't two isn't over two feet from any
[1:08:38] one of us at this moment."
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, friends, it was some
[1:08:44] awesome. And even without him saying,
[1:08:48] all you knew is that you'd come into a
[1:08:50] sacred place. That's why I say on that
[1:08:52] on that print of that painting when I
[1:08:55] describe that story I felt as though
[1:08:59] when I just sat my laid my back against
[1:09:02] rested against a tree saw that prophet
[1:09:05] there it wasn't something my imagination
[1:09:08] it was like I had just walked into a
[1:09:10] room of a young man perhaps and a young
[1:09:12] woman that were in an intimate
[1:09:15] conversation and you just want to back
[1:09:17] out and say I I I don't belong here. I'm
[1:09:20] I'm I'm intruding. When I lean back,
[1:09:24] there's just such a sacred holy
[1:09:26] presence. I thought this is this is such
[1:09:29] a holiness. I'm not really accustomed to
[1:09:31] this. I'm in a place where I was really
[1:09:34] uninvited. And yet, it was an experience
[1:09:37] I believe that God ordained that I
[1:09:39] should have in order to convey it on to
[1:09:41] you.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Are you weary or should I carry on?
[1:09:45] [Applause]
[1:09:48] So it was while we were with brother
[1:09:51] Southwick's we uh uh brother Southwick,
[1:09:56] he was not a how will I say it? He was
[1:09:59] not a real experienced guide and so he
[1:10:02] didn't have the horses and everything
[1:10:04] ready. So here's brother Brandham and I
[1:10:06] mean I kind of felt a little bit bad.
[1:10:08] Here's this great
[1:10:11] worldrenowned
[1:10:13] man of God up here to hunt and I've got
[1:10:15] all the groceries together and we arrive
[1:10:18] there and Bud hasn't got the horses
[1:10:19] gathered yet and brother Brandham I read
[1:10:22] about it this morning coming here I I
[1:10:24] could read you volumes because it's so
[1:10:26] close to me he said we were out there he
[1:10:28] says a bunch of three-year-old horses
[1:10:30] and he said Harley broke and I was
[1:10:33] exactly right and so Bud says Bud talked
[1:10:36] like this excuse me if Bud's gone on
[1:10:38] Now, God bless rest his gallant Saul and
[1:10:41] how I how we loved each other so dearly.
[1:10:45] Bud would say, "Well, guess we better go
[1:10:48] and get those horses out and we get
[1:10:50] going here, you know." And
[1:10:56] you've heard him, other Eugene.
[1:10:59] So, uh I said, "You haven't got him yet,
[1:11:02] but no. They're around here someplace.
[1:11:04] We're just going to bed.
[1:11:08] So everything is perfect, isn't it?
[1:11:11] Everything is exactly the way it's
[1:11:13] supposed to be. So, Brother Brandham and
[1:11:15] I, we get singled off and we're walking
[1:11:18] down the river flats down two wag a
[1:11:20] wagon trail. He's in one path. I'm in
[1:11:22] the other and we're just walking along
[1:11:23] and I'm just aching. I just want to talk
[1:11:25] to him so bad. I want a fire of
[1:11:27] questions. Can you imagine what a
[1:11:29] 27year-old young minister? I had so many
[1:11:33] questions. Oh, I'd have kept him busy.
[1:11:36] And I'm sorry now I didn't have a tape
[1:11:38] recorder hanging around my neck and
[1:11:39] cameras and videos and everything. I'm
[1:11:42] so sorry I didn't have a lot of that.
[1:11:44] So,
[1:11:46] uh, we're just walking there and I said,
[1:11:48] "Uh, Brother Brandham, these visions,
[1:11:52] how did they come?"
[1:11:55] Well, he said, and he did things all the
[1:11:58] time that left me so startled, I didn't
[1:12:01] know quite what to do. He reaches across
[1:12:04] because we're walking right close
[1:12:05] together. He reaches across and puts his
[1:12:07] arm around my shoulder from this side.
[1:12:10] He's got my his arm hanging right down
[1:12:12] here down my neck. And I felt so
[1:12:15] strange.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; I didn't have very many men
[1:12:19] put their arm around my neck like that.
[1:12:22] And he says, "Brother Eddie," and that's
[1:12:24] something I haven't told in my other
[1:12:25] testimony. And I decided I would share a
[1:12:28] few other things. He said, "Brother
[1:12:30] Eddie, I love you like a son. We've only
[1:12:33] been together a few days. says, "I love
[1:12:36] you like a son." He said, "If I uh if I
[1:12:39] could help you, I'd do anything I could
[1:12:41] to help you." He said, "Now," he said,
[1:12:45] "you get anointed to preach." He said,
[1:12:49] "And I get anointed to see visions." He
[1:12:52] said, "It's an anointing." And that's
[1:12:54] when he began to describe the people
[1:12:56] don't understand it, but he said, "When
[1:12:58] those visions come," he said, "I cannot
[1:13:01] stop them." And he said, 'Neither can I
[1:13:05] bring them on. It's the faith of the
[1:13:07] people that bring them on. He said, 'I
[1:13:10] just I'm just a tool and it's their
[1:13:13] faith that exercises the gifts. So I was
[1:13:16] trying to understand that. And he says,
[1:13:18] "And when they're gone, I can't remember
[1:13:20] them." I said, "That's right, Brother
[1:13:21] Brandham." I said, "Uh, and I was
[1:13:23] recalling a certain time I'd been
[1:13:25] preaching in Idaho and we had a service.
[1:13:27] My wife wasn't with me. I thought it was
[1:13:29] such I thought I was going to be
[1:13:30] raptured. It was such a glorious meeting
[1:13:32] and I was telling him I was preaching
[1:13:34] this service and I went to the phone
[1:13:36] that night cuz I want to tell my wife
[1:13:38] what a wonderful meeting it was and I
[1:13:40] was trying to get into it and trying to
[1:13:41] tell her about the message and trying to
[1:13:43] and I said the thing just fell flat and
[1:13:45] I told her oh forget it
[1:13:50] and in a small way I was understanding
[1:13:52] when when the anointing is gone we can
[1:13:55] do nothing. So then we get the horses
[1:13:57] the next day start to uh harness them
[1:14:01] with their pack saddles and everything.
[1:14:02] And there's one horse uh maybe the kids
[1:14:05] will enjoy this. There's one horse and
[1:14:08] he is a bad case. Bad case. I mean he
[1:14:14] throws his head back. He throws it
[1:14:16] against a tree. But so Bud got brother
[1:14:19] uh Chris says hold him up tight. Hold
[1:14:21] his head up tight so he can't do
[1:14:22] anything. Hold him right against the
[1:14:24] tree. I tell you that horse begin to
[1:14:26] leap up and ca cast his feet out this
[1:14:29] way and that way and and buck and then
[1:14:31] he'd get loose and we have the pack
[1:14:33] saddle on him maybe a couple paniards
[1:14:35] and he'd go thrashing through the brush.
[1:14:38] You know what paniards are? Those are
[1:14:39] boxes that go on the side of the horse
[1:14:41] and those boxes are just flapping like
[1:14:43] this. Eggs and oranges and silverware
[1:14:46] coming out and he'd throw himself on the
[1:14:49] ground to smash those boxes. And I
[1:14:52] thought, "Oh, this horse is he's only
[1:14:54] good for a bullet.
[1:14:56] That's the only thing he's good for."
[1:14:58] And I didn't have much patience with the
[1:15:00] horse like that. And here's Bud and he
[1:15:02] tries to saddle him again. In the
[1:15:03] meantime, the morning's going, "We're
[1:15:05] supposed to be hunting." I'm looking at
[1:15:07] my watch. I'm nervous. Brother Brandham
[1:15:09] only has a few days. Bud, what is the
[1:15:11] matter here? We're spending a half a day
[1:15:13] on this nag. We ought to shoot him. all
[1:15:15] his bear mate, you know, and uh I'm I'm
[1:15:19] getting all tensed up inside and and uh
[1:15:22] so they're trying to trying to do him
[1:15:24] once more. Now they got him out in the
[1:15:26] middle of the road. This road I'm
[1:15:28] talking about a little we, you know,
[1:15:29] just a little farm road. And uh Brother
[1:15:32] Brandov says, "Oh, here, Brother Eddie."
[1:15:34] He says, "Uh the Christian businessman
[1:15:36] gave me a 16 millimeter camera." I said,
[1:15:38] "Maybe you take some pictures, bud, of
[1:15:41] this horse." I said, "Yeah, okay." So I
[1:15:43] got down
[1:15:47] I got down beside the truck and I'm
[1:15:49] taking some pictures of this horse. The
[1:15:52] only thing is with this camera when you
[1:15:53] look in it, anything that's 10 yards
[1:15:55] away looks like it's 500 yards away. And
[1:15:58] that horse is way down there someplace.
[1:16:00] I see a great big commotion. He's up in
[1:16:03] the air. He's down. He's up in the air.
[1:16:06] He's bucking. He's running down the
[1:16:08] road. Yes. Right to me. And I took the
[1:16:10] camera away and he was right on top of
[1:16:13] me.
[1:16:14] And I just I'd leap for the truck as he
[1:16:17] went flying past and I'm not going to be
[1:16:20] a cameraman for the life of me.
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:25] Those are the last 16 mm pictures I ever
[1:16:27] tried to take for brother Brandham.
[1:16:32] So they left him un unsaddled. And the
[1:16:35] next day, Bud's going to start again. He
[1:16:38] he works at it. He gets two poles. He
[1:16:41] puts them up into a tree, a wedge. He
[1:16:43] drives this horse right up there, wedges
[1:16:45] him with his chest right against these
[1:16:47] two poles. He's working on it, Brother
[1:16:49] Eugene. He's working on it. And he he
[1:16:52] starts with the pack saddle and reaches
[1:16:54] cautiously underneath to get a hold of
[1:16:57] the uh the cinch, you know, and cinches
[1:17:00] him up, you know, and when he start to
[1:17:01] feel that cinch, you know, and then he
[1:17:03] leaps up in the air and he's now he's
[1:17:06] tries to strike at Bud's chest and
[1:17:10] knocks Bud down. And I said to brother
[1:17:12] Brandham, I said, "Brother Brandham, you
[1:17:14] know, here we were way now 20 miles into
[1:17:17] nowhere, as will. And nobody knew other
[1:17:20] than brother Southwick how to get out.
[1:17:22] And I said I said, "Brother Brandon, we
[1:17:25] ought to pray."
[1:17:26] I said I said, "That horse is going to
[1:17:29] kill Bud."
[1:17:32] Yeah. He said, "He's He's a bad one,
[1:17:34] isn't he?"
[1:17:37] I thought that's the understatement of
[1:17:38] the year.
[1:17:42] And so he's standing there right beside
[1:17:44] me and I'm watching and Bud's got the
[1:17:47] cinch done up and now there's the and he
[1:17:49] he tries just real cautiously to put the
[1:17:52] one paniard and the rope over the pack
[1:17:54] saddle and and lets it come rest down
[1:17:57] easy and he goes to the other side and
[1:17:59] gets the next piard on. And now both
[1:18:02] paniards are hanging on him, you know,
[1:18:04] and he's feeling that weight. And I look
[1:18:06] and if you see a horse that's in great
[1:18:08] fear, he his sometimes his flesh, his
[1:18:11] flanks will begin to tremble and shake.
[1:18:14] If they get fearful with a maybe a
[1:18:16] grizzly bear or something and here I see
[1:18:18] the flesh, his meat over his over his
[1:18:21] rump is just trembling and jiggling and
[1:18:24] shaking. I thought, uh, oh boy, you
[1:18:27] know, that horse is in in great great
[1:18:29] fear. It's going through some going
[1:18:32] through something right now. And uh and
[1:18:34] and Bud puts the last thing, which is
[1:18:35] the most scary, a tarp. Throws the tarp
[1:18:38] over it cautiously. And then he's
[1:18:40] getting ready to double with a double
[1:18:42] diamond to hitch it up. And and and he's
[1:18:45] just getting all of this done. And I and
[1:18:47] I was so surprised. And I I I turned to
[1:18:49] see Brother Brandham. I was going to
[1:18:51] say, "Brother Brandom, he's got him."
[1:18:52] And I turned. The words were still in my
[1:18:54] mouth. And brother Brandham had turned
[1:18:56] just like that. And he was just putting
[1:18:57] his hat back on his head.
[1:19:01] And that horse was a kitten from that
[1:19:03] day on.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; We packed him every day.
[1:19:12] What? What? What might we say this is? I
[1:19:14] say that this is dominion.
[1:19:17] Dominion being exercised by an adopted
[1:19:20] son.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; A fully adopted son. And I believe this
[1:19:24] is the dominion that God intended for
[1:19:27] the sons of God to enjoy and experience.
[1:19:30] Do you believe it?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, we we had that hunted and,
[1:19:37] uh,
[1:19:40] this will take me a little while.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; We were in the tent
[1:19:46] and, uh, Brother Bud, I knew that he
[1:19:50] chewed. You don't know what snooze is.
[1:19:53] What do you call it here?
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Snuff. Okay. Snuff. And you got other
[1:19:58] fancy names for it now. It's come back.
[1:20:00] And he he chewed snuff. And his lip kind
[1:20:03] of stuck out from that, you know, and I
[1:20:06] think that's what made him talk a wee
[1:20:07] bit the way he did.
[1:20:10] But he quit when when he gave his life
[1:20:11] to the Lord, which is just not very many
[1:20:13] months before. I had never seen him with
[1:20:15] a cigarette in his mouth. Never. But he
[1:20:18] got a hankering for a cigarette.
[1:20:21] So the horses were about a half a mile
[1:20:24] mile down at the river and they were
[1:20:27] hobbled with hobbles around their feet
[1:20:30] and we always checked on them every day.
[1:20:32] So he said, "I think I'll go down and
[1:20:34] check the horses." Okay, fine. So he's
[1:20:37] gone a little while. There's a fire
[1:20:39] going outside and I'm in the tent and
[1:20:42] brother Brandham's in the tent and uh
[1:20:45] then we can hear Bud his footsteps and
[1:20:47] movement outside and he's doing
[1:20:48] something with the saddles and hanging
[1:20:50] it up and so on and so forth and Bud
[1:20:52] just calls through the tent through the
[1:20:54] wall of the tent. Hey Bud. Bud says
[1:20:58] yeah. Says did you ever smoke? Bud says
[1:21:02] yep. He says when did you quit? Said
[1:21:05] just this minute.
[1:21:09] He'd had his last cigarette
[1:21:12] down there with the horses and he never
[1:21:14] smoked again. He said that was his last
[1:21:16] one.
[1:21:18] So on another occasion, we're in the
[1:21:21] tent and uh everything just fell quiet
[1:21:24] for a moment and brother Brandham is
[1:21:27] just standing he's standing in the tent
[1:21:28] like this and I'm busy. We've just
[1:21:31] finished uh eating and uh I was doing
[1:21:35] kind of the doing a little bit of
[1:21:36] cooking and washing the dishes and stuff
[1:21:38] and so I'm just moving around and I I
[1:21:41] sensed a a stillness and brother
[1:21:43] Brandham standing quiet and uh so when I
[1:21:47] stopped it was dead still and all he
[1:21:49] could hear was
[1:21:55] looked down and brother Chris Berg had
[1:21:57] his head against his sleeping bag and he
[1:22:01] was just laying on the ground. That
[1:22:03] little man that brother Brandham so he
[1:22:05] adored him
[1:22:07] and and and I looked at brother Brandham
[1:22:10] and brother Brandham was standing just
[1:22:12] like this
[1:22:14] and he jerked his head and saw me
[1:22:16] standing him. He says on that day he'll
[1:22:20] be there.
[1:22:22] Put him in a room he said with a
[1:22:23] thousand women and he'll come out pure.
[1:22:28] And then he jerked out of it. He said,
[1:22:30] "Yeah, you see, Brother Eddie," he said,
[1:22:31] "I just can't say that. I couldn't just
[1:22:34] say that about you or say that about,
[1:22:36] you know, any anyone." He said, "I I
[1:22:38] can't say that of myself." I said, "No,
[1:22:40] no, I understand, Brother Brandham. I
[1:22:42] understand." Now, that's not on my
[1:22:44] testimony either.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I tell you there. Yes.
[1:22:48] On that day, he'll be there. Put him in
[1:22:52] a room with a thousand women and he'll
[1:22:54] come out pure. Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Those things have a big effect upon a
[1:23:00] person.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:23:06] Brother Brandham, he loved that area so
[1:23:09] well. He said, "Brother Eddie, I'd like
[1:23:11] to bring Billy Paul here this fall."
[1:23:13] Fine.
[1:23:14] So, about a month before
[1:23:18] uh we were to go again that fall, I got
[1:23:20] a phone call. It's Brother Bandom on the
[1:23:23] phone. Brother Eddie, he said, "Uh, I
[1:23:26] think we're going to have a real good
[1:23:27] hunt." I said, "Oh, yeah. I I I believe
[1:23:31] we will, you know." Yeah. He said, "I I
[1:23:34] either had a dream or vision. I'm not
[1:23:35] sure which." He said, "And I saw this
[1:23:37] great massive animal. Never seen one
[1:23:40] like that." He said, "It's not an elk.
[1:23:42] I've seen elk kind of got the horns
[1:23:45] forward." He said, "It's not a moose
[1:23:47] because it hasn't got the pan handles
[1:23:48] like that." Uh he said uh it's not a
[1:23:51] deer, but he said it's it horns kind of
[1:23:54] go way back on its head. Oh, he said it
[1:23:57] was a massive thing. He said and and
[1:23:59] dark chocolate brown. And I said, "I
[1:24:03] don't know what kind of animal that
[1:24:04] would be." I said, "Caribu have their
[1:24:07] horns back on their head." He said, "I
[1:24:09] would know, Brother Eddie. I've never
[1:24:10] seen a caribou." I said, "Well, but
[1:24:13] they're not chocolate brown. They're
[1:24:15] gray. Battleship gray. just a dark steel
[1:24:19] gray. And he said, "Well," he said, "I
[1:24:21] don't know. This animal was brown." He
[1:24:23] never changed.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't change it even if I said
[1:24:27] they're dark. He didn't say, "Well, it
[1:24:29] could have been gray."
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; No, it was dark chocolate brown. He
[1:24:32] stayed with that. See?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Uh, well, I don't know what
[1:24:36] it is." And then he said, "I got a big
[1:24:38] grizzly bear. Big silver tip grizzly
[1:24:41] bear." He said, "I'll tell you about it
[1:24:43] when we meet." I said, "All right." So
[1:24:46] about a month later we met in Dawson
[1:24:48] Creek. He come all the way to
[1:24:49] Jeffersonville. I come 800 miles. He
[1:24:51] come about 3,500 miles and we meet
[1:24:53] there. We get a motel and and uh so then
[1:24:57] he starts to tell me the vision again.
[1:24:59] He says, "I I was I was hunting with uh
[1:25:02] two three little fellas and he said one
[1:25:04] of them had a kind of a green checkered
[1:25:06] shirt and uh he said one of my buddies
[1:25:09] and we we went up this area." He said,
[1:25:13] "Oh, it was a great panoramic view like
[1:25:16] this." And he swept his hand around like
[1:25:18] this. Uh, he said, "Uh, and we spotted
[1:25:22] this animal." He said, "Great giant
[1:25:26] animal, horns up like that." He said,
[1:25:28] "And and it and I I got that animal."
[1:25:31] And it seemed, he says that my buddy, my
[1:25:34] hunting buddy was was down the trail and
[1:25:36] he's pointing this way. He's down the
[1:25:38] trail to towards camp and he's he's uh
[1:25:42] he's there and uh he says, "And then and
[1:25:45] then we saw this grizzly." He said, "Big
[1:25:48] silver tip grizzly." Oh, brother Eddie,
[1:25:50] he says, "I thought right away of all
[1:25:51] the stories you told me about the
[1:25:52] grizzlies." He said, "And here I'm
[1:25:54] carrying Blondie." Blondie was his 270
[1:25:57] uh his 270 rifle. He said, "And when I
[1:26:00] looked down at Blondie," he said, "It
[1:26:02] looked like it just shrunk like this in
[1:26:03] my hand." So when I looked at that big
[1:26:05] grizzly and he said and but I said
[1:26:08] that's all I had and he said brother
[1:26:10] Eddie I fired one shot and killed that
[1:26:14] grizzly. Well I you know I had haunted
[1:26:17] grizzlies for 10 years and had never
[1:26:20] shot one. I lived my whole life in the
[1:26:24] north. Had them close to me. Had them
[1:26:27] roar at me but had never got a shot at.
[1:26:30] And I can assure you I didn't want to
[1:26:32] shoot with the 270.
[1:26:34] And he says,
[1:26:36] he said, "That gun I I pulled out and
[1:26:38] fired and got that bear in one shot."
[1:26:41] And then he said, "Uh, we we're going
[1:26:44] down to where my buddy was and uh uh he
[1:26:48] said one of the uh one of the little
[1:26:51] fellas, he he took something out and he
[1:26:54] he was measuring these horns and then he
[1:26:56] says, "I saw I saw one of these young
[1:26:59] fella's hands." He says, "Oh, he" He
[1:27:01] didn't hardly have any hair on his
[1:27:03] hands. He said, "I I suppose he's about
[1:27:05] 18 and his hands are spread out like
[1:27:08] that." And then I heard a voice. It's 42
[1:27:11] in. And then he said, "I just passed."
[1:27:15] Well,
[1:27:17] I thought
[1:27:19] Caribou aren't dark chocolate brown.
[1:27:22] And there's not two or three of us.
[1:27:24] There's only Bud, myself, and Brother
[1:27:26] Brand. I'm going on this trip.
[1:27:28] Bud's son, Blaine, was away up in the
[1:27:31] wilderness on a survey trip, surveying
[1:27:34] for the whole summer for a job. And he's
[1:27:37] an excellent guide, an excellent hunter,
[1:27:39] and a just a terrific fellow to have.
[1:27:42] And uh so I said, "Well, there isn't two
[1:27:43] or three fellows.
[1:27:45] There isn't two or three small fellows.
[1:27:47] There's nobody 18.
[1:27:50] Caribou don't aren't chocolate brown."
[1:27:52] And so I thought because brother Bram
[1:27:54] said, you know, if it's a dream, it'll
[1:27:56] if it's a dream, he said, I maybe just
[1:27:58] ate too much pie before I went to bed.
[1:28:00] He said, if it's a vision, it'll happen
[1:28:02] exactly as it as it as it said. So I
[1:28:06] thought, well, it must be must be a
[1:28:08] dream because the animals not the right
[1:28:10] color. There isn't the same number of
[1:28:12] guys going. There's nobody 18 years old
[1:28:14] going. So anyway, but it it it it it it
[1:28:17] it anchored in my heart. So my father
[1:28:21] came down to the motel and I said to
[1:28:23] brother Brandham, "Tell dad the vision,
[1:28:25] brother Brandham." So here I was
[1:28:28] doubting it myself, but but believing it
[1:28:30] at the same time. Do you ever have
[1:28:32] things like that? You know, where you
[1:28:34] you you can hardly believe it. It's just
[1:28:36] almost too good to be true. So he told
[1:28:39] the whole account to to my father. Then
[1:28:42] we got up to Brother Southwick's and
[1:28:45] we're having supper in his trailer
[1:28:46] house. I said, "Brother Brandham, tell
[1:28:49] tell Bud uh the vision of the of of the
[1:28:52] of the hunt." So, he starts out telling
[1:28:56] Bud, you know, about this, and he got to
[1:28:58] the dark chocolate brown. I said, "You
[1:29:01] know, Bud, that's the only thing that I
[1:29:02] I'm wondering about cuz the caribou is a
[1:29:05] dark battleship gray." And Bud says,
[1:29:09] "Yeah." He said, "You know, that's a
[1:29:11] funny thing." He said every time we
[1:29:13] hunted on the north side of the highway,
[1:29:16] he said there always had those brush
[1:29:18] caribou. They're kind of a dark dark
[1:29:22] gray color sort of. He said every time
[1:29:25] we hunted and got caribou on the south
[1:29:27] side of the highway, he said it was
[1:29:29] always those mountain caribou. He said,
[1:29:31] "They're kind of a deep chocolate brown
[1:29:34] color." And I said, "Well, where are we
[1:29:36] hunting?" We're hunting down into the
[1:29:38] high country to the south. I said,
[1:29:40] "Okay." So now we had that when we had
[1:29:43] just arrived, all the cats and dogs and
[1:29:45] kids and everybody come running out to
[1:29:48] meet us. And here's Blaine, the eldest
[1:29:50] son, come running out, too. He's
[1:29:52] supposed to be hunt. He's supposed to be
[1:29:54] surveying. I said, Blaine, what are you
[1:29:56] doing? He said, "The job just finished
[1:29:58] and I'm home now." And so he he was
[1:30:01] behind the barn fixing a piece of
[1:30:05] harness on a rock, putting a rivet in
[1:30:07] it. And I'm just watching him. I said,
[1:30:11] "How old are you, Blaine?" He says, He
[1:30:14] says, "18. Why?" I said, "I just wanted
[1:30:17] to know."
[1:30:21] So I thought, "This thing's falling
[1:30:23] together." Dark chocolate brown, 18
[1:30:26] years old. So on
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I don't know who's going to have the
[1:30:29] shirt. I had a I had a a dark green uh
[1:30:34] kind of medium green checkered shirt and
[1:30:37] uh I'd wore it so many years and it tore
[1:30:40] here and tore here and my wife
[1:30:41] faithfully she stitched it up and
[1:30:43] stitched it up and stitched it up and so
[1:30:46] I told her very explicitly, I do not
[1:30:49] want this shirt anymore. Throw it in the
[1:30:52] garbage and go and get me a couple of
[1:30:54] shirts. And I thought for a big hunt, I
[1:30:56] never been on these big hunt with guides
[1:30:58] before. You know, we we when I went to
[1:31:00] Brother South, I we just hunted as a
[1:31:02] friend. We just go out and shoot a moose
[1:31:04] and drag it in and take it home and have
[1:31:06] our meat. So, but you know, this is big
[1:31:08] time stuff with a guide and taking in
[1:31:11] all his horses and stuff. So, I thought
[1:31:14] I should have a nice red shirt. Bud
[1:31:16] hated those red shirts.
[1:31:18] So anyway,
[1:31:21] uh the morning we arrived or should say
[1:31:24] we arrived that evening and saw these
[1:31:25] animals on top of a mountain side, some
[1:31:29] caribou sheep long distance just looking
[1:31:31] at them with binoculars. Brother Sik
[1:31:33] said, "Tomorrow morning we'll go up
[1:31:35] there." So we got up in the morning and
[1:31:37] brother Brandon remembers this. It's in
[1:31:38] the messages. I had forgotten about it
[1:31:41] because it happened so often. Somebody
[1:31:43] was always falling in the creek and so I
[1:31:45] fell in the creek that morning and I got
[1:31:48] wet. Brother Brandham tells about it
[1:31:50] especially because I had to go back and
[1:31:51] change my clothes. So I open up my
[1:31:54] duffel bag. What's staring at me in the
[1:31:56] face is this green shirt my wife has
[1:31:58] repaired again for this trip. And I
[1:32:01] remember thoughts passing through my
[1:32:03] mind. Why didn't my wife do what I asked
[1:32:05] her to do and throw this thing away
[1:32:08] anyway? So you know uh you you kind of
[1:32:10] grumble but you put the thing on. You
[1:32:12] grumble while a vision's being
[1:32:13] fulfilled.
[1:32:17] Exactly. So,
[1:32:19] and God's ways are not our ways,
[1:32:21] friends. Many times when we're
[1:32:23] murmuring, we're actually interpreting
[1:32:25] the word. We're in the pit, but we're
[1:32:27] interpreting the word. And so, I put on
[1:32:30] this shirt and away we went, we got up
[1:32:32] on top of this mountain side, and here
[1:32:34] we run into a small uh herd of caribou,
[1:32:36] and they just uh ran every direction.
[1:32:39] And so I run one way, Blaine runs one
[1:32:41] way, brother Brandon Bud runs another
[1:32:43] direction. And and they just there's no
[1:32:46] trees, there's no brush, there's no
[1:32:48] nothing. But I tell you what, those
[1:32:50] those fellas can disappear. They're a
[1:32:53] Houdini for disappearing. And the sheep,
[1:32:55] some sheep were there and they were just
[1:32:56] gone. And so uh I was going back trying
[1:33:00] to make our way back to the horses
[1:33:02] because we just dropped the reins.
[1:33:03] There's nothing to tie the horses to.
[1:33:05] And I'm making my way back to the
[1:33:06] horses. And I spot a small caribou. It's
[1:33:09] got horns. And I was I was just getting
[1:33:13] ready. I thought maybe I should shoot
[1:33:14] this caribou, but I didn't want to
[1:33:15] really shoot in case brother Brandham
[1:33:17] was ready to shoot something. So I was
[1:33:19] holding back and I heard somebody
[1:33:20] saying, and here it was brother Blaine.
[1:33:24] And I I I motioned to him to be quiet.
[1:33:25] There's a caribou just over the ridge.
[1:33:28] So he comes up and that was my first
[1:33:30] chance, first opportunity of knowing.
[1:33:32] See, cow moose don't have horns.
[1:33:34] Bullmoose have horns and dough deer
[1:33:36] don't have horns. Bucks that have horns,
[1:33:39] but when you get in the caribou, both
[1:33:41] the cows and the bulls have horns. And I
[1:33:43] was ready to shoot a cow. She had horns.
[1:33:45] And I anything with horns I thought
[1:33:47] should be shot. So anyway,
[1:33:50] he says, "No, that's a cow. Don't shoot
[1:33:52] that." And so we just got up and moved a
[1:33:54] few feet and here ran a young bull out
[1:33:57] of a dip and he just ran partway up a
[1:33:59] side hill and stopped just for a moment
[1:34:01] to take a look. and I got a shot and he
[1:34:02] came down and now now we had some meat.
[1:34:05] So we walk over to him, bud and brother
[1:34:08] Brandham hear the shot and they come
[1:34:09] running over. They were just real close
[1:34:11] and there it was laying there dark dark
[1:34:15] chocolate brown just shining in the sun
[1:34:18] and I and and Blaine starts to dress it
[1:34:20] out and brother Bam and I stand there
[1:34:22] not saying very much and little wee tiny
[1:34:24] horns you know and I thought well it'll
[1:34:25] be nice to eat that certainly no trophy
[1:34:28] horns these are just little tiny things
[1:34:30] like this and we finished it was time to
[1:34:33] eat lunch and we just climbed up on a
[1:34:35] little ridge and when we climbed up on
[1:34:36] this ridge now this great granite peak
[1:34:39] here fell off this way onto the ridge we
[1:34:42] were sitting eating our lunch and then
[1:34:44] another ridge fell off with glaciers.
[1:34:47] Oh, this was incredible. I'm going to
[1:34:50] maybe read a quote for you. Brother
[1:34:52] Brandham says, "If God will allow me, I
[1:34:54] want to live here in the millennium."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And it just fell away like that with
[1:35:00] glaciers and the ridge flowed out like
[1:35:02] that for maybe three, four miles. And we
[1:35:06] just sat down and I don't know if it's
[1:35:09] Bud or brother Brandham put up the
[1:35:10] glasses and Bud, brother Brandham was
[1:35:13] guess first. He says, "Bud, what's
[1:35:14] that?" And Bud looks over, there's two
[1:35:17] massive caribou laying on a glacier to
[1:35:21] keep away from the mosquitoes and bugs
[1:35:23] and they're laying in a glacier. And
[1:35:25] when I saw two of them and my those it
[1:35:28] didn't look like they could hold their
[1:35:29] heads up. Those horns were so massive.
[1:35:31] Here I just shot a little wee one like
[1:35:33] this. I thought, "Oh my goodness, why
[1:35:36] did I pull that trigger and shoot that
[1:35:37] little little bull when I could have
[1:35:39] maybe got one of these?" So, we laid a
[1:35:41] plan and Brother Bud says, "Bla, you and
[1:35:44] Eddie stay here and we'll go." Now,
[1:35:47] we're in the middle of vision.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; I'm in a checkered shirt.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; It hasn't once crossed my mind.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Not once crossed my mind. Got a dark
[1:35:58] chocolate animal. Hasn't once crossed my
[1:36:01] mind. Brother Brandham's now spotted
[1:36:03] this great big caribou and we're all in
[1:36:05] it. We're making the plans. Bud says,
[1:36:07] "Well, you you better stay here and
[1:36:10] we'll I'll take Brother Brandon. We'll
[1:36:12] go down. We're going to cross over that
[1:36:13] ridge and try and come on top of those
[1:36:15] uh caribou. And if you see us get it,
[1:36:18] then you better go back down over this
[1:36:20] direction and get Brother Eddie's uh
[1:36:22] caribou and then cut on an angle over
[1:36:25] here to this dry creek bed and wait
[1:36:28] there." And in the vision, I was
[1:36:30] supposed to be alone. So
[1:36:34] Blaine and I waited. We saw about a half
[1:36:36] an hour later or so, Brother Brandham
[1:36:38] come up over the top. We hear a shot
[1:36:40] fired. See one of these big animals go
[1:36:42] down. A second shot. That's all over.
[1:36:46] And so, okay, we make our way with the
[1:36:48] horses. We get my meat all in the
[1:36:51] paniards. Make our way over here where
[1:36:54] it's it takes a few hours before we get
[1:36:56] there. And now it's late afternoon
[1:36:59] and uh and so we we just arrest our
[1:37:02] horses and we we we sit there and we
[1:37:04] wait an hour and uh Blaine says, "Well,
[1:37:08] they're not here another half hour." He
[1:37:10] says, "I'm going to go and find them."
[1:37:13] In the vision, I was supposed to be
[1:37:14] alone. Brother Brandham says his hunting
[1:37:16] buddy with a green shirt was was by was
[1:37:20] on the way to the camp. And that was
[1:37:22] directly on the way to the camp. So half
[1:37:25] an hour comes and they're not there.
[1:37:27] Blaine takes off about another half
[1:37:29] hour. Then I hear voices in the
[1:37:31] distance. And I wait and I'm up on a
[1:37:34] little null and pretty soon here I see
[1:37:36] them coming and Bud is carrying this
[1:37:38] massive rack of horns on his on the back
[1:37:42] of his shoulders like this. And uh I
[1:37:45] come running down off of my little perch
[1:37:47] where I was. Oh, it was so exciting. I'd
[1:37:50] never seen a set of horns like that. And
[1:37:53] I I I'm slapping Brother Brandham on the
[1:37:55] shoulder, you know. Oh, brother
[1:37:56] Brandham, I said that is a uh
[1:37:59] congratulations. I take his hand and
[1:38:01] we're shaking hands. Oh, yes. He said
[1:38:03] he's he's a nice one. He's nice. And he
[1:38:05] says, I got my grizzly, too. And then I
[1:38:07] I hit brother Brand like this. No, I
[1:38:10] said that was too much cuz every once in
[1:38:12] a while, you know, he wasn't beyond just
[1:38:14] joshing with you a wee bit. You know who
[1:38:17] who who shoots a trophy caribou and a
[1:38:19] grizzly the same day. Here's a here's a
[1:38:21] guy who's never shot a caribou and never
[1:38:23] shot a grizzly. lived in the country all
[1:38:25] my life. Never shot a trophy either of
[1:38:27] the two and went hunting for them 10
[1:38:29] days after Grizzly. Never got one. And
[1:38:32] so I said, "Nah." I said, "You didn't
[1:38:34] get a grizzly, too, did you?" "Yeah."
[1:38:35] "Yeah." He said, "I did." "No." I said,
[1:38:38] "That's impossible." Same day. And Bud
[1:38:40] says, "Sure did. You got it up there in
[1:38:43] the mountain." You know,
[1:38:45] I I said, "Well, where is it?" He said,
[1:38:48] "Well, you couldn't pack it." Bud says
[1:38:50] it's hide weighs 300 lb. And I said, and
[1:38:54] I started feeling strange.
[1:38:57] Oh my. You know, and uh and here's his
[1:39:00] horns laying there. And now we're just
[1:39:02] kind of caught in the in in a moment.
[1:39:04] Something's happening. And and Bud walks
[1:39:07] over to his saddle bag and pulls out a
[1:39:09] little round steel tape. You know, it's
[1:39:12] amazing what catches your attention.
[1:39:13] Yeah.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And I I thought I've hunted all my life
[1:39:17] since I've been a boy, 16 years old, and
[1:39:21] I never saw anybody go and get a little
[1:39:23] steel tape. I said, I guess that's
[1:39:26] right. You know, he's a guide now. And
[1:39:29] he wants to see what size these horns
[1:39:31] are. And so he reaches down, pulls out
[1:39:34] this little round steel tape, and he
[1:39:37] puts it down because there's a ridge
[1:39:39] where the horns come out of the fur. and
[1:39:41] he puts it down there. And a caribou's
[1:39:44] horns go, they swing back like this and
[1:39:48] then out and then come back. And so
[1:39:51] every time he would come through this
[1:39:54] bend and come out here, it would flick
[1:39:57] out at the bottom. And Blaine standing
[1:40:00] there and we're both standing there kind
[1:40:02] of stunned. And we're watching him
[1:40:04] struggle with this. And he tries it once
[1:40:06] and tries it again and tries it again.
[1:40:08] And brother Bram standing right here on
[1:40:10] my shoulder and we're just watching him
[1:40:12] and Bud, he says just a little
[1:40:14] impatiently says, "Blaine, hold that
[1:40:17] tape in there." Oh, okay. So Blaine gets
[1:40:20] down, spreads out those 18year-old
[1:40:22] hands.
[1:40:25] Had to spread them out in order to hold
[1:40:27] the tape in the curve. And here, Brother
[1:40:29] Bram said, I and he held his hands like
[1:40:31] that when he told me the vision. He says
[1:40:34] a boy's hands, he says about 18 years
[1:40:36] old, no hair on them, about 18. And
[1:40:40] there he was. I saw those 18-year-old
[1:40:42] hands. Then everything, the whole vision
[1:40:44] started to crash in on me all at once.
[1:40:46] Been six hours
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; being unfolded in six hours. I have a
[1:40:51] great empathy for the disciples in the
[1:40:54] Bible when Jesus told them clearly what
[1:40:57] was to happen and yet it was so hard to
[1:41:00] pick it up. I have a great empathy for
[1:41:03] them. And you know something, friends,
[1:41:04] as I was speaking last night, brother
[1:41:06] Brennham has said things very, very
[1:41:08] clearly. And it seems that we almost we
[1:41:11] we go through the vision, we go through
[1:41:13] the prophecy and have to have the Holy
[1:41:15] Spirit in an added measure of grace come
[1:41:17] back to us and reveal it to us and say,
[1:41:20] "It's there. It is. It's already
[1:41:21] happened. Don't miss it."
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram said, "The rapture will
[1:41:25] be that way
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and Elijah's coming will be that way."
[1:41:29] Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; And so soon as those hands were spread
[1:41:32] out like that, Brother Brandham kind of
[1:41:34] reared back and he raised his hand like
[1:41:37] this and he touched me on the shoulder.
[1:41:39] He says, "There it is." And it just kind
[1:41:43] of crashed all together and it was all
[1:41:45] over.
[1:41:47] Well,
[1:41:49] I thought I thought much about that.
[1:41:53] Uh
[1:41:56] we had taken a walk and I must tell you
[1:41:58] this as well. We had taken a little walk
[1:42:01] just he and I actually this was on the
[1:42:03] on the first hunt in the spring when I
[1:42:06] had those questions in my heart and we
[1:42:09] sat on a log beside a trail and brother
[1:42:13] Brandham said to me, "Brother Eddie," he
[1:42:16] said he I was on this mountain. I
[1:42:18] believe it was this mountain this
[1:42:19] afternoon. And he said, "Bother Bud was
[1:42:24] uh riding ahead of me and and he said,
[1:42:26] he came to me there and I believe that
[1:42:29] you have
[1:42:31] uh three questions. It's on your heart."
[1:42:36] And I said, "Yes, that is true." He
[1:42:39] said, "The first one is on the Godhead.
[1:42:42] The second one I mean the first one is
[1:42:43] on baptism. The second one is on
[1:42:46] Godhead. And the third one is on the
[1:42:48] serpent seed. Oh, I was just exposed. I
[1:42:53] said, "That's exactly right." I said,
[1:42:55] "Uh, so we we we talked about the the
[1:42:59] the false anointed ones." And this is
[1:43:02] remarkable, too. Some have come and
[1:43:04] asked me about this, but I'll uh I've
[1:43:06] told my testimony years ago, and this is
[1:43:08] as true as true before God as it can be.
[1:43:12] He said to me, "Have have you heard my
[1:43:16] tape on the false anointed ones?" This
[1:43:18] was n May 1961.
[1:43:21] He did not speak that message until
[1:43:24] 1965.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; He asked me if I heard his tape on false
[1:43:28] anointed ones. And there was a very
[1:43:30] special reason for asking me if I'd
[1:43:31] heard his tape because some people that
[1:43:34] had been working in my church had been
[1:43:36] working and using his tapes against me
[1:43:38] as a pastor. And I was saying in my
[1:43:40] heart, I wish that Jeffersonville would
[1:43:42] just send those tapes to the pastors,
[1:43:45] you know, so then people couldn't use it
[1:43:46] to make trouble for the pastors. And so
[1:43:49] I kind of had that little feeling and
[1:43:51] and right or wrong, I'm not saying it's
[1:43:53] it's either way. I'm just saying that I
[1:43:55] I had that feeling. So he asked me,
[1:43:58] which which led me to an embarrassment
[1:44:01] that I had to confess, no, I had not
[1:44:03] heard that tape. And that's why it is so
[1:44:06] indelibly marked on my mind. And so then
[1:44:09] he went through the scriptures, four
[1:44:11] scriptures, that the rain falls on the
[1:44:13] just and the unjust. The wheat and the
[1:44:16] tears grow up together in the last days,
[1:44:18] says God, I'll pour out my spirit upon
[1:44:20] all flesh. All flesh, but not all flesh
[1:44:22] is saved. And so he went through all
[1:44:24] these scriptures and I just saw it clear
[1:44:27] as as he moved through it till it was
[1:44:29] absolutely clear when he was done. Then
[1:44:31] we got to the baptism, got to the
[1:44:34] godhead, got to the serpent's seed. And
[1:44:36] I had read and reread and read and
[1:44:38] reread chapter 3 and chapter 4 of
[1:44:40] Genesis. And so when brother Brandham
[1:44:42] came to the serpent seat, I said I
[1:44:44] remember raising my finger and I said,
[1:44:45] "Well, brother Brandham," I said, "The
[1:44:46] scripture says, "And Adam knew his wife
[1:44:49] and she conceived and bear a son called
[1:44:50] his name Cain." And they called his name
[1:44:53] Cain, for I for she for she said, "I
[1:44:56] received a man from the Lord." He said,
[1:44:58] "That's exactly right. It could only
[1:45:00] come from the Lord." But he said, "You
[1:45:01] need to need need to read the next
[1:45:03] scripture." And I hadn't read the next
[1:45:05] scripture. I didn't know what the next
[1:45:06] scripture was. And he said, "And the
[1:45:09] next scripture is and she again bare his
[1:45:11] brother Abel. They were twins."
[1:45:15] And then I didn't get a revelation, but
[1:45:17] I got a very clear understanding that I
[1:45:20] had missed something. And that is when
[1:45:22] he said to me, "Brother Eddie, you just
[1:45:24] pray and be real sincere, and I'll pray
[1:45:27] for you, too, and I believe that God
[1:45:30] will reveal it to you." Hallelujah.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly exactly how it
[1:45:34] happened and what he did
[1:45:37] coming home that same time, that same
[1:45:40] fall where the uh caribou
[1:45:44] uh where he got his caribou and grizzly.
[1:45:46] Uh we were driving home and of course
[1:45:49] that little animal I had wouldn't
[1:45:50] provide very much meat and I was looking
[1:45:52] primarily for a moose.
[1:45:55] And this is probably one of the most
[1:45:57] sacred moments that I recall in my
[1:45:59] lifetime.
[1:46:01] Uh we were around mile 177 on the
[1:46:04] Alaskan Highway. It's all broken down
[1:46:06] into miles, mileages.
[1:46:09] And we were just before mile 177.
[1:46:12] And uh Brother Brandham was driving the
[1:46:15] car and uh Brother Blaine was in the
[1:46:20] back and myself in the passenger seat.
[1:46:24] As brother Brandham was driving, he
[1:46:25] said, "Brother Eddie, what do you think
[1:46:29] of this ministry?" Now, he didn't say,
[1:46:30] "My ministry, but he just said, "What do
[1:46:32] you think of this ministry? Do you think
[1:46:34] it could be that of Elijah the prophet
[1:46:37] as it's foretold in the scripture and
[1:46:39] revelation and so on." And then his
[1:46:41] voice begin to trail off.
[1:46:44] I had noticed that that was an earmark
[1:46:46] when he was under the anointing at the
[1:46:47] pulpit. And when you hear him on the
[1:46:49] tape, I'm trying to make it easy for you
[1:46:52] when you listen to the tapes. And even
[1:46:53] more interesting when you hear Brother
[1:46:55] Brandham saying, "Uh, I I see you
[1:46:58] coming. Uh, you drove from the east
[1:47:01] coming here." Mhm. Uh-huh. Yeah. You
[1:47:04] hear him going like that. Uh-huh.
[1:47:05] Uh-huh. As he's he's under that and he's
[1:47:07] seeing it. Here's voice kind of getting
[1:47:09] thick and drawling and getting slow
[1:47:12] because he's under very heavy under that
[1:47:14] anointing. That's exactly what took
[1:47:17] place here. How what do you think of
[1:47:19] this ministry? Do you think it could be
[1:47:21] that of Elijah the prophet as it's
[1:47:23] foretold in the scripture revelation and
[1:47:26] so on? And his voice was trailing right
[1:47:28] off. And I said I I hung my head. I
[1:47:33] looked at the glove box.
[1:47:35] I said, "Well, I felt completely
[1:47:38] inadequate to answer this question." I
[1:47:41] said, 'Well, Brother Brandham, for all I
[1:47:42] would know,
[1:47:44] I said, 'It must be, it has every
[1:47:49] every
[1:47:50] uh indication. It has every character of
[1:47:54] being that ministry.
[1:47:57] And
[1:47:59] he put his head kind of back like this.
[1:48:00] He said, I often kind of wondered said,
[1:48:03] I I kind of think so myself. And it was
[1:48:06] at that moment, I don't know whether it
[1:48:08] was the agreement of our two spirits or
[1:48:11] whether it was just as the a moment
[1:48:16] where God said that this was so pleasing
[1:48:20] to him. I don't know what it was, but a
[1:48:23] being
[1:48:25] a being that's far more
[1:48:29] uh uh
[1:48:32] you could sense in in in a far greater
[1:48:34] reality than a person coming near you.
[1:48:37] You know, you can sense someone coming
[1:48:39] near you. But a being came and it just
[1:48:41] came like
[1:48:43] instantly.
[1:48:45] It was just between us and just forward.
[1:48:48] Not right between us, but just forward.
[1:48:52] I could I could tell you just exactly if
[1:48:55] I was there right now, I could tell you
[1:48:57] precisely the location of that being. I
[1:49:01] I literally froze. I was frozen.
[1:49:06] And a and a thought went through my
[1:49:09] mind. My next breath is taking me to
[1:49:13] some other place. I'm passing from this
[1:49:16] life.
[1:49:18] And I thought
[1:49:21] the only thing I can do is now look and
[1:49:24] see what what is brother Brandham's
[1:49:26] reaction. I didn't even want to move my
[1:49:29] head. So I just cast my eyes sideways
[1:49:32] and he was leaning over the steering
[1:49:34] wheel like this driving and his face had
[1:49:38] turned ashen. the color had left his
[1:49:41] face and I thought my he looked like a
[1:49:45] man close to death and I'd had a friend
[1:49:48] who had been very close to death at one
[1:49:51] time pinned between two pieces of
[1:49:52] machinery and when he got dropped out
[1:49:55] even though he didn't have a beard of
[1:49:57] maybe just a day old beard but his beard
[1:49:59] stuck out prickly and brother Brandham's
[1:50:02] beard my beard we had about a 4-day
[1:50:04] beard or a weak beard and his beard was
[1:50:07] just sticking out like prickles and I
[1:50:09] thought He looks like he's near death.
[1:50:11] And just then, Brother Brandham rolled
[1:50:13] his head slowly back like this. Said,
[1:50:17] "Brother Eddie, I guess he's come to me
[1:50:20] 10,000 times 10,000.
[1:50:24] It's every time the same. It's just like
[1:50:27] I could die."
[1:50:30] And he those words had just gone out of
[1:50:32] his mouth. And I was caught in the
[1:50:35] silence of the moment. We were going
[1:50:37] around a curve in the highway and there
[1:50:39] stood a big bull moose in the middle of
[1:50:41] the road.
[1:50:43] I said, "Brother Brandon, there's a
[1:50:44] moose." We were about 400 yards. His
[1:50:47] voice remained very heavy and thick. He
[1:50:51] said, "It's all right, Brother Eddie.
[1:50:54] You'll you'll get him. He's yours. You
[1:50:56] You'll get him. Just get your gun and
[1:50:58] your shells." I had my gun in my hand
[1:51:00] and my shells were right here. I said,
[1:51:02] "I'm ready. I'll take them now." cuz
[1:51:04] that was 400 yd, 300 yards. That's where
[1:51:06] average distance we would shoot a moose.
[1:51:09] He said, and he kept driving right up at
[1:51:11] the same speed. And I said, "Stop,
[1:51:13] Brother Bam. Stop. I'll take him now."
[1:51:15] He's up 200 yards. He goes up to about
[1:51:18] 100 yards. I said, "Stop, Brother Bam."
[1:51:20] Cuz he's going to run off the highway.
[1:51:22] And he's just standing there big bull
[1:51:24] moose standing there broadside looking
[1:51:26] at us with those horns out like this
[1:51:29] right in the middle of the road. And I
[1:51:31] said, "Stop, Brother Brandham. stop. He
[1:51:34] drove up to about 90 ft is what I paced
[1:51:37] out. Not yards, but 90 ft from this
[1:51:40] animal, stopped the car. I got out and
[1:51:43] when I looked through my four power
[1:51:45] scope, all I saw was hair.
[1:51:49] And so I had to move my gun around to
[1:51:52] even get an image of his body. I got the
[1:51:55] top of his back and brought it down just
[1:51:57] off his back, pulled the trigger. Only
[1:51:59] time in my life that happened. Only time
[1:52:01] in my life I actually saw the bullet
[1:52:03] enter. Saw the hair go poof like that
[1:52:06] and saw the bullet enter. And then I
[1:52:08] thought I hope he doesn't drop cuz if he
[1:52:11] drops he's right on a null. A car will
[1:52:14] come over have an accident have big
[1:52:16] trouble. And he started to walk. He
[1:52:19] walked. He walked down a little
[1:52:20] depression of a ditch. Then I thought we
[1:52:22] haven't got room for him in brother
[1:52:24] Brandham's station wagon. I'll have to
[1:52:26] come back for him. I hope he doesn't
[1:52:27] drop here in the ditch. I hope he
[1:52:29] doesn't drop in the clearing cuz
[1:52:31] somebody's going to steal him. And he
[1:52:32] just kept walking, walking. He just
[1:52:35] began to went into the little brush.
[1:52:37] There was two huge windfalls on an angle
[1:52:40] like this. He stepped over those two
[1:52:42] windfalls
[1:52:44] and fell totally hidden right behind
[1:52:47] those two windfalls.
[1:52:49] You know, these things were just so
[1:52:51] remarkable. So, we dressed him out, kind
[1:52:54] of cleaned our hands off on the grass,
[1:52:57] went back probably an hour and a half or
[1:53:00] so later and got in the station wagon.
[1:53:04] Brother Brandham started to just started
[1:53:06] to move and immediately
[1:53:09] it was uh completely a different
[1:53:13] atmosphere and presence. everything.
[1:53:18] It was like that brother Bram talks
[1:53:20] about emerald green.
[1:53:22] It was everything was so tranquil,
[1:53:27] so quiet peace beyond the word peace. It
[1:53:32] was just something that was permeating
[1:53:35] the whole air. It was a totally
[1:53:37] different presence.
[1:53:39] Brother Brandham said, "Brother Eddie,
[1:53:42] every time he comes, something good
[1:53:45] happens."
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; And I thought, "How wonderful that was
[1:53:50] for us."
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; My wife's I'm going to close now because
[1:53:56] we won't get this done in in this time
[1:54:00] and in eternity. We won't need to say it
[1:54:02] all. We'll just rejoice about it. But I
[1:54:05] I'll I'll anchor a couple things in your
[1:54:07] mind. My wife's daddy had a massive
[1:54:10] heart attack and the main artery to his
[1:54:13] heart had ruptured and he was bleeding
[1:54:15] inside. Uh I had to fly her to his
[1:54:18] bedside. The family could only be with
[1:54:20] him 10 day 10 minutes out of a day and
[1:54:23] he could not speak and he held there and
[1:54:26] hung on a thread for five weeks in an
[1:54:28] oxygen tent. And then she had to come
[1:54:31] home because we had our children and
[1:54:33] they had started school and so on. and
[1:54:36] uh he he seemed to hang on and he came
[1:54:38] out of hospital but he couldn't go at
[1:54:40] any moment. She wanted to talk to
[1:54:42] brother Brandham about him in July. That
[1:54:45] happened in about April. She wanted to
[1:54:47] talk she'd set up the meetings and
[1:54:49] helped me with the meetings and played
[1:54:50] the piano and so on and uh now we the
[1:54:55] last three meetings were over in
[1:54:56] Victoria and I'm at the motel and I'm
[1:54:59] saying my farewells to brother Brandham.
[1:55:01] Sister Brandham was inside with the
[1:55:03] children and it's just Brother Brandham
[1:55:05] and myself here and we're in kind of the
[1:55:07] lights the evening lights and my wife is
[1:55:09] standing off in the shadows a little
[1:55:11] distance letting us have our
[1:55:12] conversation
[1:55:14] and I was saying well brother Brenam
[1:55:16] have a safe journey and perhaps we'll
[1:55:18] see you you know in uh this fall again
[1:55:21] and yes brother Eddie and uh you know
[1:55:24] you take care of yourself and so on.
[1:55:26] Then he just turned around like this. He
[1:55:28] says, "By the way, Sister Biscll, your
[1:55:30] father will be all right."
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; That's all the words that were spoken.
[1:55:36] He lived 18 years
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; and never he lived till he was 84 years.
[1:55:42] Never died sick. Just a day and a half
[1:55:45] or so before he went, checked himself
[1:55:47] into the hospital. Never had another
[1:55:49] heart attack. Seven years later, his own
[1:55:52] doctor, who was his close friend,
[1:55:53] examined him and said, "Wes, if I had
[1:55:56] not been the doctor here when they
[1:55:58] brought you in, and if I had not
[1:56:00] examined you, I could never have told
[1:56:02] you'd had that kind of a heart attack."
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you something now that is a
[1:56:08] little more current and and this brings
[1:56:10] it up to date for a lot of the people.
[1:56:12] All these many many years later, I was
[1:56:15] in Finland
[1:56:17] and uh there's an elderly sister in the
[1:56:20] meeting. This elderly sister, she went
[1:56:24] to visit an aged woman in a senior
[1:56:26] citizen's home. While she's there
[1:56:29] visiting this woman, another lady who's
[1:56:31] visiting comes over to her, says, "Seems
[1:56:34] I know you from someplace." She said,
[1:56:37] "Well, I I don't recognize you." So they
[1:56:40] begin to swap stories and uh turned out
[1:56:45] yes they had known each other and been
[1:56:47] 35 or 36 years since they'd seen each
[1:56:50] other. So now they wanted to rehearse
[1:56:52] what are you doing in your family and
[1:56:54] all of this and so on. And then after a
[1:56:56] while the conversation became spiritual
[1:56:58] to the spiritual side. Oh, uh, you know,
[1:57:01] you're going to church. And this woman
[1:57:03] says, "Yes, yes, I go to a Pentecostal
[1:57:05] church and, uh, and and about you." She
[1:57:08] said, "Well, I I go to a little church
[1:57:10] that we follow the ministry of Brother
[1:57:12] Brandham." The message that Brother
[1:57:13] Brandham brought. Oh. She said, "Brother
[1:57:16] Brham?" She said, "What do you remember
[1:57:18] he was here in Finland?" Yeah. She said,
[1:57:21] "Of course I remember he was here in
[1:57:23] Finland." Said, "Well, do you remember
[1:57:25] hearing about the boy that was raised
[1:57:26] from the dead?" Oh, yes, certainly. We
[1:57:30] remember that because all the believers
[1:57:31] know that she said it was my husband
[1:57:34] that drove the car that killed the boy.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And this then brother Matty Honkinan
[1:57:42] who's a voice of God representative in
[1:57:44] Finland right now. Brother Mattie Honan
[1:57:47] got that woman on the telephone because
[1:57:49] I wanted to go to her town about 150
[1:57:52] kilometers away and actually video her
[1:57:55] testimony through an interpreter, but
[1:57:57] she felt too nervous to be in front of a
[1:57:59] camera. She said maybe again at another
[1:58:01] time and that another time never did
[1:58:03] come. But uh but we you hear all about
[1:58:06] the boy that was raised from the dead.
[1:58:08] Now, Brother Biscll has been through an
[1:58:11] interpreter speaking to her on a
[1:58:14] telephone. Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; And a man comes to my house from Finland
[1:58:21] after that and we invited him to our
[1:58:23] home for Christmas dinner. And while
[1:58:25] we're having Christmas dinner, he picks
[1:58:27] out his billfold like so. He takes out a
[1:58:31] picture of this little boy that's in the
[1:58:34] Voice of Healing magazine and he held it
[1:58:36] out in front of me. Said, "You've seen
[1:58:38] this picture before?" I said, "Yes,
[1:58:41] that's the boy that was raised from the
[1:58:42] dead in Finland." "Yes." Yes. He said,
[1:58:44] "It's true." Not only that, he said, "I
[1:58:47] just visited him. He's a policeman.
[1:58:51] He's a policeman for the highway
[1:58:54] patrol." And he I said, "How is he?" He
[1:58:57] said, "He wants everybody to know that
[1:58:59] he's very h healthy and he's very
[1:59:01] happy." And he just says, "Praise God."
[1:59:04] So, I thought that that is certainly
[1:59:06] worthwhile that you're able to hear
[1:59:08] those things. It's not just 40 years
[1:59:10] ago, 30 years ago, but it's right here,
[1:59:12] right now. And I'll say this in closing.
[1:59:18] This
[1:59:21] testimony which is incomplete
[1:59:25] and you can certainly see why because
[1:59:27] it's ongoing.
[1:59:29] I feel as though I would like to leave
[1:59:32] you with this thought.
[1:59:34] We each one have been entrusted
[1:59:39] with a most
[1:59:42] in incredibly
[1:59:44] valuable
[1:59:46] something that God saw fit to do in our
[1:59:50] time
[1:59:52] and commit
[1:59:54] here's my thought and committed this
[1:59:57] message into our hands. Amen.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; I feel that there's others that were
[2:00:05] perhaps more worthy
[2:00:07] and I don't know why he allowed us to be
[2:00:10] those people.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; But we truly have been given
[2:00:15] true riches.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; And God has actually entrusted you and
[2:00:20] trusted you with the fulfillment of this
[2:00:23] word. And you're going to carry it out
[2:00:25] from here to the rapture. Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Wherever that might be, let's just thank
[2:00:31] him.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father,
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; these things have been said that you
[2:00:38] might be glorified.
[2:00:41] It would take as it did as I sat sat and
[2:00:45] listened to brother Brennham that night
[2:00:48] at that table
[2:00:50] supper hours long.
[2:00:53] Lord, it just seemed that we were uh so
[2:00:58] captivated, so riveted in our seats as
[2:01:02] we listened. And the people here today,
[2:01:04] Lord, they've been patient with me and
[2:01:06] they have sat and listened with such
[2:01:09] attentive hearts. I pray that wherever
[2:01:12] this video or tape or testimony may go,
[2:01:17] that it may be understood and not
[2:01:19] misunderstood.
[2:01:20] and that I am publicly thanking you for
[2:01:23] the opportunity of having shared, oh
[2:01:26] God, some of these experiences. And I
[2:01:30] pray it will give the young people an
[2:01:32] understanding that they'll be able to go
[2:01:34] and and when they testify of this
[2:01:37] message, they'll say, "I heard it out of
[2:01:40] a witness's mouth. I heard these things
[2:01:43] live and I don't have to guess about it.
[2:01:46] I know that they are true. I know the
[2:01:49] boys raised in Finland and I know that
[2:01:52] these visions were fulfilled. I know
[2:01:56] people were delivered and healed. And
[2:01:58] furthermore, I know that a message has
[2:02:00] been sent. Oh, transforming light. This
[2:02:04] transforming power. How how glorious it
[2:02:08] is. And I pray, oh God, that visited us
[2:02:11] through a pillar of fire, revealing
[2:02:13] yourself through the son of man. And I
[2:02:16] ask, oh Lord, that you will reveal
[2:02:19] yourself to each individual.
[2:02:22] As we come now near to the the closing
[2:02:25] of these services, I pray that everyone
[2:02:29] will have something that they have been
[2:02:32] able to tuck away in their heart. I
[2:02:34] pray, Lord, they will not leave as they
[2:02:36] came. I'm asking that any that came with
[2:02:40] heavy hearts may now have already well
[2:02:42] been delivered. I pray that those that
[2:02:45] came sickly and afflicted will have had
[2:02:49] that touch, that touch of virtue, and
[2:02:52] that they will be free, set free. I ask
[2:02:55] that you'll bless all the officers and
[2:02:58] all the ministers, Lord, and Brother
[2:03:00] Jeff as he's sought to labor and has
[2:03:02] labored diligently and hard. The song
[2:03:05] leaders, oh God, and all that have
[2:03:07] participated, those musicians and those
[2:03:10] who sang and caused us to be happy.
[2:03:13] Those that have been on the sound
[2:03:15] equipment have done such a fine job.
[2:03:18] Lord, on the video cameras and the
[2:03:20] sisters that labored in the kitchen. Oh
[2:03:23] Lord, we just can't wait. Oh God, till
[2:03:25] we're together someday and can sit down
[2:03:27] and express our appreciation for one
[2:03:30] another. And until then, Lord, until
[2:03:33] then, may our hearts burn with fervor
[2:03:38] and zeal for the kingdom of God. In
[2:03:42] Jesus Christ's name, I commit these
[2:03:44] words to you and these people for your
[2:03:47] glory, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] Bless you, brother.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Hope that wasn't too long, brother.
[2:04:00] [Applause]
