[0:00] the littlest things. We praise your
[0:02] name, oh God.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah to your name,
[0:06] Lord.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord.
[0:10] In this presence, we're going to go to
[0:12] prayer. Ask brother Tony, believe you
[0:14] have a prayer request that you want to
[0:16] relate. If you would come at this time,
[0:19] give it. We don't have any prayer class
[0:21] up here, but if you have a need on our
[0:23] heart as brother Tony goes a prayer,
[0:25] just lift it to our Lord. Amen.
[0:30] We just want to rejoice with the saints
[0:32] in China that were released, the
[0:34] brothers when they heard that so many
[0:36] around the world have been praying for
[0:37] them. They just broke down and wept.
[0:39] Amen. It touches hearts and lives when
[0:41] we pray. We also would just invite you
[0:44] as uh on behalf of our family to join
[0:47] with us in prayer. Rebecca's sister, her
[0:50] older sister Shirley, her husband uh has
[0:53] been admitted to South Africa. They were
[0:55] in the country of Zambia for some
[0:58] mission work that they were filling in
[0:59] for and her husband Shirley's husband
[1:01] Lauren. He uh he's got an infection and
[1:04] it ended up causing an abscess upon his
[1:07] brain. And so he's in a very serious
[1:09] condition. There's an abscess there.
[1:11] They've done an operation a week ago and
[1:13] they had to take him in for another
[1:14] emergency operation uh just um about 6
[1:18] hours ago. So you know how it is when
[1:20] one of your family members is suffering.
[1:23] We appreciate you joining our hearts
[1:24] together with us. Can we do that?
[1:28] Heavenly Father,
[1:30] we do live to worship you for you've
[1:32] done so much for us. Lord, we live our
[1:36] lives, Lord, sacrificing our own desires
[1:40] in order that we could worship you in
[1:43] the spirit of holiness and the way we
[1:45] live, the manner of conversation that we
[1:47] have, Lord, because of our love and our
[1:49] gratitude and our appreciation. Lord,
[1:52] for when we were vile, lost sinners
[1:54] living unto ourselves, Lord, you didn't
[1:57] look at our flesh. You didn't look at
[1:58] our weaknesses, our our faults and
[2:01] failings. You look beyond that to the
[2:03] lamb's book of life. Lord, there you saw
[2:06] our names written there in the lamb's
[2:08] blood. Hallelujah. And father, here we
[2:10] are tonight, Lord, your chosen bride.
[2:13] Here we are tonight, oh God, as as ones
[2:15] that have been on placed on earth in the
[2:18] ministry to stand in the gap, a ministry
[2:20] of reconciliation for those that are in
[2:23] need of salvation, in need of healing,
[2:26] in need of deliverance. And Lord, we
[2:28] bring our requests before you. And we
[2:30] ask abundantly that our joy may be full.
[2:33] For we know that you delight, Lord, in
[2:36] seeing your children blessed. We know
[2:38] that you, Lord, bore those stripes in
[2:40] your body in order that you could prove
[2:42] you're greater than sickness, greater
[2:44] than abscess, greater than cancer.
[2:47] Hallelujah. And so, Father, once again
[2:49] tonight, Lord, with the faith that
[2:51] you've given to us and Lord, recognizing
[2:53] and knowing who we are, we come boldly,
[2:56] Father, as your wife, as your bride,
[2:59] Lord, asking on behalf of those that are
[3:01] in need. And Lord, we have this need in
[3:03] our family. And Lord Jesus, we're
[3:05] asking, Lord, that whatever's been
[3:08] spoken, Lord, that it would be forgiven,
[3:10] Lord. whatever action that may have been
[3:12] taken, Lord, that might have been
[3:13] contrary to your word. Father, we pray
[3:16] for mercy, Lord, we stand, Lord, in the
[3:18] gap for Shirley and Lord, at this hour
[3:21] that you would move in a in a sovereign
[3:23] way in that hospital in Johannesburg,
[3:26] Lord, and move over that bed and Lord,
[3:28] bring a healing and a strength to his
[3:30] body. And Lord, more importantly than
[3:32] that, that there would be a recognition
[3:34] of your presence in this last days.
[3:37] Lord, for we realize the hour that we're
[3:39] living in and how short it is. And Lord,
[3:41] we're applying that token once again for
[3:44] our families tonight. And Lord, we know
[3:46] that there's many extended families in
[3:48] this assembly. And by way of internet
[3:50] that are listening tonight, we pray,
[3:53] Father, that you would move on our loved
[3:54] ones hearts. Move on those that are away
[3:57] from you, even in this assembly. And so,
[4:00] Father, we ask thy will to be done as we
[4:02] ask it according to thy word now. And
[4:05] father, as we turn our hearts to the
[4:06] word, Lord, that feeds our souls, that
[4:09] lifts us up in a heavenly places, Lord,
[4:12] may there just be a move of your spirit
[4:13] over our pastor tonight. Lord, may we
[4:15] just be elevated once again and leave
[4:18] this place, a a happier people, a a
[4:20] victorious people because of the word
[4:22] that has fed our souls. Bless the red
[4:25] tonight as we ask all these mercies in
[4:27] Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[4:42] Amen. You love the Lord. Praise God. I
[4:44] have one announcement from our brother

[11:35] power.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for your prayers. Your
[11:39] prayers gave us power.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; We had a wonderful time at Brother
[11:45] Donnie Reagan's church and congregation
[11:48] there and those that came in from many
[11:52] different places. We were really happy
[11:54] to to uh
[11:57] join with them. And at this Thanksgiving
[11:59] time, first time I've ever been there at
[12:01] Thanksgiving time. And some came from oh
[12:04] from Florida and different states around
[12:07] North Carolina and South Carolina, I
[12:10] guess, different places. We're just real
[12:13] happy to be with them. And it was nice
[12:14] to have some of our own congregation.
[12:16] Brother Ernie, Sister Katie were there
[12:18] and brother Hank. Amen. It was nice to
[12:21] see him. Brother Jake Dick came and and
[12:26] uh I was able for the first time
[12:28] probably in 20 years we I was able to
[12:31] have my daughters with us and uh that
[12:34] was very special and Dave uh also was
[12:38] able to be with Marilyn. So it was just
[12:40] very very special and uh you know it's
[12:44] uh when you when you raise a family it's
[12:47] it it is nice to get to be together once
[12:50] in a while and sometimes it's it's hard
[12:52] when everybody's kind of involved in the
[12:54] ministry one way or another. It's just
[12:57] difficult to get together, but it was
[12:59] was just really really nice and
[13:01] especially for uh I knew that you were
[13:04] praying and uh I knew that God was
[13:07] blessing also in the congregation. I
[13:09] already heard the church was packed
[13:11] Sunday morning and like nobody was away
[13:14] here. A few Sundays ago, I I happened to
[13:17] know that there was quite a few people
[13:19] away, probably as many as 20. And I
[13:22] thought, well, there'll be a little bit
[13:23] of room in the church. I I came to
[13:26] church and it was just absolutely
[13:28] squeezed tight. I thought, "Well, my
[13:31] where did all these people go?" I said
[13:33] something to someone. They said, "Well,
[13:34] it was just the people sitting in the
[13:35] fellowship room got into the sanctuary
[13:38] finally." So, God bless you for coming
[13:42] early and being here and for praying and
[13:44] and everything that's taking place.
[13:46] Thank you for your prayers for during
[13:48] the prayer meeting and for the young
[13:50] people and for what's taking place. and
[13:53] brother John Andy's been going through
[13:55] the seals with them and and I'm going to
[13:57] try to get in one of those meetings,
[13:59] brother John for sure. In January, as
[14:01] you suggested and and uh praying for the
[14:04] camp, the brothers that uh you may
[14:06] wonder what uh you know what took place.
[14:08] We made an announcement and brother
[14:10] Chris Peterson took their names and uh
[14:14] the names of all the people and he was
[14:18] you know quite persistent, you know,
[14:20] because I just stood up to see how he's
[14:21] doing. He says, "Well, write your name
[14:23] down." So, I was number 27. I haven't
[14:26] been out there yet, but I I keep getting
[14:28] the daily uh progress reports and said
[14:32] the brothers that have been out there
[14:33] just uh have been having a great time. I
[14:36] know, brother Jack, you were out there.
[14:39] They liked it. Some of the brothers
[14:40] liked it so well. I heard that they, you
[14:42] know, uh just made a nice wood fire and
[14:45] made them all comfortable and they said,
[14:46] "I think we'll just stay till tomorrow."
[14:47] And then they want to stay day after
[14:49] day. It must be good food and really a
[14:52] welcome spirit out there. So, you that
[14:55] have uh uh have uh put your name down,
[14:59] you're you're going to enjoy your time
[15:01] out there. And uh and we want to pray
[15:04] about that, too, because it's a
[15:05] spiritual it's a spiritual work. We're
[15:08] not there just, you know, for or uh uh
[15:11] you know, just to spend time, but it we
[15:13] we're looking forward to God using it.
[15:16] Amen. He can use your car. He can use
[15:19] your house.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; He can use everything. Do you believe
[15:21] that?
[15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he does. We're thankful to God
[15:25] for that. Uh I'm going to have you stand
[15:27] and I'd like to sing. We worship you in
[15:30] spirit and in truth. If you just lift up
[15:33] your voices and sing with me. I just
[15:36] feel like I'd like to worship him
[15:37] tonight. Wouldn't that be a good thing
[15:39] to do on Wednesday? Amen.
[15:43] [Music]
[15:45] We worship you
[15:50] in spirit
[15:52] and in truth.
[15:54] [Music]
[15:58] We
[15:59] worship you in spirit
[16:04] and in truth.
[16:10] We have heard your word and felt your
[16:16] presence.
[16:20] [Music]
[16:22] We worship you
[16:26] in spirit
[16:28] and in truth. We're going to sing it
[16:31] once again. And while we sing it, if you
[16:35] know it, you could just close your eyes
[16:37] and look up to him. If you feel like
[16:40] lifting your hand, that's fine. But
[16:42] above all things, let's lift up our
[16:44] hearts. Let's lift them up with yielding
[16:48] by yielding to the Holy Spirit. And the
[16:51] words which said, "And I felt your
[16:53] presence too." If we have not felt his
[16:57] presence, I'd suggest we ask, invite him
[17:01] tonight. Would you do that? Say, "Lord,
[17:04] let me sense and feel your presence. I
[17:08] invite you to come and minister to me
[17:11] personally. We're not here just to put
[17:13] in time, but we're here to hear
[17:15] something.
[17:17] Living word. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you
[17:21] say amen?
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:23] &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. Let's just
[17:25] enter in now. We worship you.
[17:30] Yes, Lord. In spirit, in
[17:35] truth.
[17:38] Oh, hear us Lord.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; We worship you in spirit
[17:46] and
[17:52] we have heard your word
[17:56] and help your
[17:59] true.
[18:04] We worship you
[18:08] in spirit
[18:10] and in truth.
[18:14] Now with our heads and hearts bowed as
[18:17] we approach your word, oh loving father.
[18:21] You love your children.
[18:24] You have called us to this place. We
[18:27] have come to worship you in spirit and
[18:30] in truth. And we worship you now, Lord,
[18:32] by opening our hearts to your word. And
[18:36] let the Holy Spirit speak. Let the Holy
[18:39] Spirit be the minister tonight, oh God.
[18:41] Minister to my heart. Minister to every
[18:44] heart. And I pray, Father, those that
[18:47] may not be hungry, create within them a
[18:50] hunger. Create within us a thirst. Oh
[18:52] God, create within us that desire. May
[18:56] the desire be so intense. Let it be a
[18:59] flame burning embers within our soul,
[19:02] Lord God. And we want to let you know
[19:04] nothing can satisfy us in this world. We
[19:07] say take the whole world and give us
[19:10] Jesus. Give us the Lord Jesus. Oh, a
[19:13] living Christ, not a Christ of history,
[19:16] not a Jesus of history, but one that is
[19:19] now alive and resurrected amongst his
[19:23] people, Jesus Christ in bride form. I
[19:27] pray Lord you'll just let your anointing
[19:29] now Father flow through us and into us
[19:32] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll have you uh turn in your
[19:39] Bibles if you would to Ephesians
[19:42] the first chapter. Very very common
[19:46] portion of scripture for those of us
[19:49] message believers.
[19:51] But it's wonderful words, precious
[19:53] words.
[19:55] uh uh in Ephesians 1,
[19:58] we're going to start at the third verse
[20:00] and just read down to verse seven.
[20:07] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[20:09] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[20:12] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[20:15] places in Christ, according as he hath
[20:18] chosen us in him before the foundation
[20:21] of the world, that we should be holy and
[20:24] without blame before him in love, having
[20:28] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[20:31] children by Jesus Christ to himself.
[20:33] self according to the good pleasure of
[20:36] his will,
[20:38] to the praise of the glory of his grace,
[20:41] wherein he hath made uh wherein wherein
[20:45] he hath made us accepted in the beloved,
[20:49] in whom we have redemption through his
[20:52] blood, the forgiveness of sins according
[20:55] to the riches of his grace. You know,
[20:58] we've read just a few verses. I don't
[21:01] know if you have ever marveled, but I
[21:04] have many, many times, frequently as I
[21:07] read the scripture and especially
[21:09] reading uh Apostle Paul's writings.
[21:13] They're not merely profound, but there's
[21:15] no excess words. They're so potent, just
[21:20] potent with life. And I marvel because
[21:24] how even God I know it's God speaking
[21:26] through a man but how God could get
[21:28] control of a man so he can be so precise
[21:31] with his thoughts and lay the word down
[21:34] like that. And I can tell you you can
[21:35] read these four or five verses which we
[21:37] read and there isn't any excess words.
[21:40] Every word is just absolutely pregnant
[21:42] with life. It's marvelous. God help us
[21:45] as we continue on this evening. You have
[21:47] your seats please.
[21:51] I want to take this phrase
[21:55] which I have pondered on many times
[21:59] and I felt inspired to it this week
[22:02] while I was away
[22:04] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[22:08] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[22:11] beloved. And I would like to speak to
[22:13] you this evening. Uh and I trust that
[22:16] God will just help me and give me uh
[22:20] continuity of thought. I would like to
[22:23] speak on uh accepted in the beloved.
[22:28] Uh I thought on the subject this
[22:32] generation in particular,
[22:34] we are uh we are sometimes at least I
[22:38] feel almost bombarded by society itself
[22:43] with a pressure and an imposition
[22:47] placed upon us to accept what others uh
[22:52] what what they want to believe, how they
[22:55] want to live. And it's it it seems that
[22:58] they're not satisfied to simply go on,
[23:01] do your own thing, live your own life,
[23:03] but they're not satisfied with that.
[23:05] They want you to accept
[23:08] &gt;&gt; what they do, how they speak, how they
[23:11] live, how they conduct themselves, what
[23:13] their sexual orientation is or whatever
[23:16] else. They might want to believe some of
[23:18] the craziest things in the world, but
[23:20] they and I just say, "Go ahead and
[23:22] believe it. Go do your thing. live your
[23:24] life however you feel to do it. Just go
[23:27] your way, you know, leave me alone. But
[23:29] no, no, no. They want you to accept it.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; It's an age of acceptations. If that if
[23:36] that makes any sense to you, they want
[23:38] you to accept it.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; However, you know, however it is. and
[23:42] whatever whatever level of uh uh of life
[23:48] whatever level of of you know manner of
[23:52] life that that they have and I don't
[23:54] want to go into details with that
[23:56] because I want to move on from that but
[23:58] we are certainly in that kind of an age.
[24:02] I talked to a woman in the bank today
[24:05] and I I just passed this over the pulpit
[24:08] a few days ago, but I just said to her,
[24:10] I said, you know, if you think about
[24:12] things for a little bit, I said, you'll
[24:14] you'll find that they they know well
[24:16] about the church here and everything and
[24:18] the people here. But I said, if you
[24:20] think about things for just a wee bit
[24:22] and and let this thought distill for a
[24:25] moment, boil it down. I said you you'll
[24:28] find that uh uh the criminals today are
[24:32] really
[24:34] imposing their lifestyle
[24:37] upon the government to such an extent
[24:40] that the government write laws to
[24:43] accommodate them and you pay the bill.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; That's really what it is
[24:48] &gt;&gt; in a lot of ways. in a lot of ways and I
[24:51] could go into some details and you just
[24:53] find out that uh I I went to do a little
[24:56] bank transaction day and they said well
[24:57] we can't do that anymore
[25:00] and I and and I had just trying to do a
[25:02] little small bank transaction across the
[25:04] border and I I I I couldn't do it down
[25:07] there. They said no we've centralized
[25:09] we've centralized the whole thing. They
[25:10] said, you know, it's this it's this
[25:12] money laundering thing here. I'm trying
[25:14] to, you know, get a check uh on one side
[25:17] of the border and bring it on the other
[25:19] side of the border. Just a a a measily
[25:22] insignificant transaction, but it can't
[25:25] do it because it's all done now in some
[25:27] big central uh bank uh at head office
[25:31] and you we can't give you a cashier's
[25:33] check in Canadian funds. Uh none of the
[25:36] branches can do that anymore. you've got
[25:38] to uh so I had to speak to a uh one of
[25:42] the uh executives and say h how can I do
[25:44] this then? I just need this in Canadian
[25:47] funds and bring it back across the
[25:49] border and and uh put it in another
[25:51] account and a personal account and take
[25:54] it out into another kind of a a
[25:56] certified check and finally I got the
[25:58] thing took me a couple of hours to do
[26:00] something that would have taken about
[26:01] five minutes. So I talked to the girl in
[26:03] the bank and I said you know she said
[26:05] well you know it's all this money
[26:06] laundering thing. I said, "Isn't it
[26:07] amazing that the these guys that are
[26:10] these criminals are imposing upon you to
[26:13] write laws that make it so hard for us
[26:16] citizens to live and all these drug
[26:19] dealers and all these pot growers are
[26:22] causing the government to write laws and
[26:25] impose uh and confine us and restrict us
[26:29] and also make us pay the bill.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; We have to pay the bill." So, in
[26:34] essence, they're writing the law.
[26:36] They're telling the politicians what to
[26:38] say. And yet on the other hand, they
[26:40] want to be accepted. They want you not
[26:43] only pay the bill, they want you to
[26:44] accept it.
[26:46] This is the way it's going to be. Well,
[26:48] I can tell you that is exactly the way
[26:50] it's going to be because that's how the
[26:52] world is going to go. It's going to go
[26:53] that direction. That has very little to
[26:55] do with my message, but I thought I'd
[26:57] just throw that out.
[27:02] There's something
[27:04] uh within I say the human psyche that
[27:08] wants to be accepted.
[27:11] We we we feel we need identification.
[27:14] Young people do. They want to be and and
[27:17] if a person's not accepted or is denied
[27:21] being accepted, it's a hardship. You
[27:24] believe it or not, it is a hardship.
[27:26] Some people say, "I'm a loner. It
[27:27] doesn't mean a thing to me." Oh, yeah.
[27:29] No, no. I know some of those people that
[27:31] are loners. They they want they need to
[27:33] be identified with somebody more than
[27:35] anyone else. They need to be identified
[27:37] with somebody. They want to be
[27:38] identified with somebody, some group or
[27:40] something. And there's always uh uh
[27:43] there's always something that uh
[27:45] attracts people to, you know, they get
[27:47] into the big crowd, whether it's a
[27:49] sports crowd or whether it's a religious
[27:51] crowd. But people, there's something
[27:53] within the human frame, a human inner
[27:56] person that needs to be accepted. Now,
[28:00] there's a key phrase here that I want to
[28:03] uh uh start my message by dwelling on
[28:06] this for just a moment. And it says that
[28:09] hath he hath made made us
[28:15] accepted in and that little word
[28:18] two-letter word in the beloved is a key
[28:21] word.
[28:25] He hath made us accepted
[28:28] in the beloved. Outside of that there's
[28:31] no assurance of being accepted but in
[28:34] the beloved. And the little word in
[28:37] which you may, you know, you may feel
[28:40] that you you well know it and that this
[28:42] is a a very elementary Sunday school
[28:46] class, but it's really not because the
[28:49] word in it speaks of or denotes that the
[28:53] object,
[28:54] now we're speaking about you as the
[28:56] object is surrounded by or included in a
[29:01] specific place
[29:04] and that you are enveloped
[29:07] or you are restrained by certain limits.
[29:11] And anyone that's in Christ is enveloped
[29:16] and restrained or constrained by certain
[29:19] limits. There are things that we can't
[29:21] do. Not because not because God is
[29:24] saying you can't do it, but because we
[29:26] don't have a desire to do it because we
[29:29] are we have certain constraints. We have
[29:32] certain limitations and those come to us
[29:36] because of the mere fact that we are
[29:38] living in we are living in Christ and
[29:42] Christ is the word and the word isn't
[29:44] thou shalt thou shalt not. Brother
[29:45] Brandham goes into his marriage
[29:47] relationship
[29:49] and refers to uh his own relationship
[29:52] with his wife. And when he goes
[29:54] overseas, she doesn't grab him by the
[29:56] tie and tell him what to do. And he
[29:59] doesn't tell her, you know, what to do.
[30:02] He doesn't have to point to some, you
[30:04] know, piece of paper on the wall, say,
[30:05] "We're married and you have to live a
[30:08] certain way." That's he said, "That'd be
[30:10] a terrible marriage."
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That wouldn't be right
[30:14] at all. But because they're being
[30:16] dictated to, in other words, he says, "I
[30:18] fear my wife." He said in other place,
[30:20] he fears them. He has a certain not a
[30:23] fear of being a scared, but a fear of of
[30:26] the sanctity of the marriage union.
[30:29] There's a sanctity to it. And so, there
[30:32] are certain restraints. There are
[30:33] certain restraints of us living in
[30:36] Christ. And we're not only constrained
[30:39] of you can't, you can. That's not the
[30:42] point. The point is I'm glad for those
[30:44] constraints. I'm glad for that because
[30:47] it actually is our security. It's a
[30:49] place of safety, which I we'll dwell on
[30:52] in a few moments. But being accepted in
[30:56] Christ refers to also a certain sphere
[30:59] of activity. We're in a certain place of
[31:02] activity. We're not idle. We're not
[31:05] motionless. We're not atrophied. So, we
[31:07] can't do anything. But this is our realm
[31:10] of activity. We're in Christ and that's
[31:13] how we move and have our being because
[31:16] we're we're in a we're in a dynamic
[31:19] place.
[31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; I just came from a special meeting. I
[31:25] kind of thought that I would have some
[31:26] amens here this evening.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; You want to say scum to the pastor?
[31:32] This is a sphere of activity
[31:35] or within a certain realm of influence
[31:38] that's being in. So, we're accepted in I
[31:40] want to go over this. We're accepted in
[31:43] a place where we have a where a place of
[31:47] of security. We're accepted in a place
[31:50] of protection. We're accepted in a place
[31:53] a realm of activity and also a realm of
[31:56] constraint. We there are there are just
[31:59] things that we ourselves choose not to
[32:02] do or other things we choose to do. We
[32:05] choose we choose to once God has
[32:08] revealed himself, we choose to yield.
[32:10] You know, God's not going to force you
[32:11] to yield. We're the ones that yield.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; We do the yielding.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; God sends his spirit in upon us, but we
[32:19] do the yielding to that spirit.
[32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He does the revealing of his word
[32:24] and we open our hearts. Amen. I'm glad
[32:28] there is something that we can at least
[32:30] contribute
[32:32] &gt;&gt; to it.
[32:34] Now
[32:36] the first Eve because we do believe
[32:40] ourselves as the bride of Jesus Christ.
[32:43] I thought of the first Eve. She was
[32:46] blessed in a very special way when she
[32:49] really wasn't aware of it. She was
[32:51] blessed when she was in Adam
[32:54] because the Bible says, "So God created
[32:57] man in his own image, in the image of
[33:00] God created he him. Male and female
[33:04] created he them. And God blessed them."
[33:09] Plural. God blessed them. Eve was
[33:13] blessed while she was yet in Adam.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; She had not been separated, but she was
[33:18] blessed. And he said unto them, plural,
[33:22] "Be fruitful, and multiply, and
[33:26] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[33:29] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[33:31] and over the fowl of the air, and over
[33:33] every living thing that moveth upon the
[33:36] earth." Eve
[33:39] was blessed in Adam,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; and that's where we are blessed.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Eve was sealed in Adam.
[33:49] Hallelujah. Eve was protected in Adam.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Eve was sinless in Adam.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was a blessed place for
[34:03] her to be was in Adam.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; The first Eve and the second Eve is in
[34:08] Adam.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; And we are sinless in Adam.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; We are protected in Adam.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; We are secure in Adam. Hallelujah.
[34:18] Glory to God. What a blessed place. And
[34:20] we are blessed in Adam and on my message
[34:24] tonight. And we are accepted in Adam.
[34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're accepted. Not we will
[34:29] be. We are accepted in him now.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:35] This is the place that God intended for
[34:37] his children. And these are the these
[34:40] are the uh words which I just want to uh
[34:43] dwell on momentarily.
[34:46] He said he blessed them. To be blessed
[34:50] actually in the Hebrew is to be adored.
[34:52] He said be fruitful. That's branch off
[34:56] cause to bear fruit, multiply, become
[35:00] great, to become many, and to increase
[35:04] in growth. These are the words that God
[35:07] used. Replenish. Replenish the earth
[35:10] fullness. Come to abundance. Be
[35:12] satisfied. to be accomplished something.
[35:16] Isn't it wonderful? People today strive
[35:18] for fulfillment. Oh, I'm just looking
[35:20] for fulfillment. But only a believer can
[35:24] come to that place of real contentment,
[35:27] satisfying
[35:28] uh the the satisfaction of the soul.
[35:31] We're content in Christ. We don't have
[35:34] to be anxious and, you know, be
[35:37] frightful. We don't need that.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:41] replenish the earth to be in fullness or
[35:44] abundance and subdue it to keep to keep
[35:47] under to make subservient to be subject
[35:50] and he said to have dominion and that's
[35:52] simply to have to rule.
[35:56] You're blessed,
[35:58] be fruitful,
[36:00] multiply,
[36:02] replenish, subdue, and have dominion.
[36:05] That's a blessed place. I tell you what,
[36:08] if we can just participate in all of
[36:09] those
[36:10] &gt;&gt; and and God didn't speak that back there
[36:13] just because he had nothing to say. God
[36:15] was reflecting straight through to this
[36:17] time. And the prophet of God said,
[36:19] "Everything that the first Adam lost,
[36:21] the second Adam has brought it back."
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? You accept that?
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And we're accepted in the beloved and we
[36:28] are called upon. We're to have back in
[36:31] the and that's why in the breach before
[36:33] even coming to the seals he's coming
[36:35] especially to that place everything that
[36:38] Adam lost everything the first Adam lost
[36:40] everything and the fellowship
[36:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[36:45] &gt;&gt; we've got it back
[36:48] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[36:50] &gt;&gt; it's accessible to you
[36:52] &gt;&gt; don't let the devil tell you anything
[36:54] other than the truth
[36:55] &gt;&gt; the truth is spoken the prophet of God
[36:58] spoke the truth and Anything contrary to
[37:00] it is a lie.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; We don't have to earn it or try to get
[37:05] it back somehow. It's been given back.
[37:07] So the blessing was placed on this state
[37:12] of complete oneness because now Eve is
[37:15] is in Adam and the blessing was placed
[37:19] while she was in that state
[37:22] of complete and total oneness.
[37:27] I just put down here in my notes because
[37:30] this is what I felt in the inner in my
[37:33] inner self that I've been deeply moved
[37:37] by the thought of being one with the
[37:39] word. I've asked myself,
[37:43] we've got the message.
[37:46] It it's it's been it's so wonderful. I
[37:49] have such an insatiable desire to see
[37:51] that others are blessed with this
[37:53] message. And that's why I'm I'm so
[37:56] thrilled with what takes place overseas
[37:58] and in missions and so on because I just
[38:01] I like to feel, oh, if they have an
[38:04] opportunity to be blessed like I've been
[38:06] blessed with that word, I'd be so
[38:08] thrilled with that. And that that just
[38:10] is a craving within my own heart to see
[38:12] someone else. We look out over the
[38:14] congregation. I I just trust you're able
[38:16] to feed on that word and be strengthened
[38:19] by that word and wash by that word.
[38:21] Don't leave it on the shelves, but it
[38:23] just let it flow over you and wash over
[38:26] you. Wave after wave after wave and God
[38:29] will quicken something to you. You might
[38:31] live on that for days.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful it is.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful word we have.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And I and I I I contemplated and thought
[38:43] much about you, Lord, I just want to be
[38:45] one. How do I get to be one with the
[38:48] word? H how
[38:51] what is it that I need to do to be one
[38:53] to be completely united like in a
[38:56] marriage union? I just want to be one
[38:58] with with Christ. Not something that we
[39:00] just say but something that is practical
[39:03] in our lives and actually happens. And I
[39:06] I feel that we need to uh in order for
[39:09] me to do that and that's what I'm
[39:11] conveying to you tonight is is you just
[39:13] live in it. You ponder it. You think
[39:16] about it. You lay down resting and you
[39:18] think about it and you sit up and you're
[39:20] thinking about it and you're in your car
[39:22] and maybe you hear a little bit of a a
[39:24] message, a tape or whatever more. If
[39:26] you're just in your quiet time, you're
[39:28] thinking about it. Yeah. You're you're
[39:30] pondering it and you let that word and
[39:32] while I was away, I was speaking to the
[39:34] people about the on the subject of the
[39:36] anointing which I spoke here about three
[39:38] services and I just thought of the the
[39:40] the anointed the the word itself is
[39:43] anointed. That is that's the very breath
[39:45] of God. Let that breath of God breathe
[39:48] on you. Tomorrow, tonight, and the next
[39:51] week. Just let it breathe on you. It's
[39:54] the anointing being poured into you. You
[39:56] don't know when you're going to need it.
[39:57] You ate food today. You don't know when
[39:59] you're going to need that food. You
[40:01] don't know it might be fighting off.
[40:03] Some infection right now or some other
[40:06] some contrary cells might be fighting it
[40:08] off. You have no knowledge of it. You
[40:11] have no feeling about it. You don't feel
[40:13] good. you don't feel bad but the food
[40:15] that you eat the thing that you take on
[40:17] and we eat uh you know sensibly and
[40:21] healthy it it it is doing something in
[40:24] our system we we don't know about it but
[40:26] and you hear the word you take it in you
[40:29] absorb it you let it penetrate you
[40:32] ponder it drops into your soul you don't
[40:35] know what it's doing all the time but
[40:37] it's fighting off
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah giving you victory
[40:41] &gt;&gt; fighting off the enemy waring against
[40:44] doubt and fear and waring against
[40:46] criticism and waring against all these
[40:49] things. And people say, "I have low
[40:51] self-esteem." Take on the word and it'll
[40:54] it'll fight that thing off.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; I just feel twisted up inside. Take on
[40:58] the word. Let it wash over you. Become
[41:01] one with it. Hallelujah. Ponder this
[41:04] tonight. Accept it in the beloved.
[41:06] Accept it in the beloved. Isn't it
[41:08] wonderful to be accepted?
[41:11] I thought of the ultimate rejection
[41:15] and even while you know sometimes the
[41:17] little things happen in in the day and
[41:19] in your normal life I was just coming
[41:22] out of a parking lot and I thought
[41:25] coming home well I'll just pay this
[41:27] ticket ahead of time I'll just so I I
[41:31] put my parking card in the machine
[41:35] says denied
[41:38] I don't like that. Try it again. Denied.
[41:42] Again, denied. Well, I'll have to get a
[41:46] human being then. If the machine's going
[41:47] to deny me, get a human being and hope
[41:49] they don't deny me. But the ultimate
[41:52] denial
[41:54] said, "Oh, we felt anointed. We we sang.
[41:58] We worshiped. We we went to church. We
[42:01] paid tithes. We prayed. We saw great
[42:04] things happen. We prophesied all these
[42:06] things." Then to here, depart.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; I never knew you.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; I came to church tonight. I said, God,
[42:16] don't let one person
[42:18] &gt;&gt; sitting in our congregation tonight ever
[42:21] have to hear those words.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; You want to say tonight, you know, one
[42:27] thing, you might not you might not have
[42:29] to believe everything I say, but you
[42:30] have to believe everything Jesus said.
[42:32] And as sure as there's breath in your
[42:35] lungs, that's going to happen.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. There's going to
[42:39] be people just like yourself who love
[42:41] their children, who love their husbands
[42:43] and wives, who had happy times and
[42:46] sorrowful times. There's going to be
[42:48] people just like you going to hear those
[42:50] words,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; depart from me. The ultimate denial, the
[42:55] ultimate rejection, and the one where
[42:58] there's no recourse. I say, "Oh God, let
[43:01] us not waste any time. We're the people
[43:04] of all people on the earth. You have
[43:06] been given something that multitudes,
[43:08] millions of others have never tasted."
[43:12] &gt;&gt; How we ought to rejoice tonight. How we
[43:14] ought to be able to just take and even
[43:16] stand and say, "Oh God, how privileged I
[43:20] am to be accepted in the beloved."
[43:25] &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; And it shall never take and become
[43:30] common place to us.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how we love you.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; I'm challenged to maintain
[43:44] &gt;&gt; and not let the enemy take it from me to
[43:47] maintain this place of oneness. I'm
[43:50] challenged to that. How to achieve and
[43:52] maintain it is a real challenge. And I
[43:55] say long after this service, after
[43:57] you've gone, day after day, I want you
[43:59] to think about it. If brother Ed was
[44:02] challenged, he wants to be one with that
[44:04] word. It's not enough just to say,
[44:05] "Well, I am one with the word." That's
[44:07] good. That's a good confession. But we
[44:09] want to be able to say, "Oh, God, I'm
[44:12] striving for that oneness. I don't want
[44:14] anything to affect it. I want anything
[44:17] to separate. I don't want anything to
[44:19] cloud this relationship
[44:21] &gt;&gt; because this is a marriage, you know.
[44:24] You that are married, you know that we
[44:27] as partners, we walk softly.
[44:31] We need to
[44:32] &gt;&gt; because all kinds of things can come in
[44:34] and afflict.
[44:36] It's the most perfect relationship.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And you can even become accustomed to
[44:42] something less than what it should be.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; And I say we should not do that. We
[44:47] should not allow that.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Now it got quiet, but you ought to say
[44:51] amen again. So, I'm going to confess
[44:53] that God intended I should have a
[44:56] wonderful relationship here on this
[44:58] earth. And God, make me what I need to
[45:00] be. Make my partner what they need to
[45:02] be, my husband, my wife. Make us what we
[45:05] need to be so we can be uh not only one
[45:08] and have our wonderful relationship, but
[45:10] we can be an example to others, a
[45:12] strength to others.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Only the grace of God
[45:22] can sustain us and sustain our spirit
[45:24] and our resolve and our dedication
[45:28] to our position in Christ.
[45:30] I'm dedicated. We want to be forcefully
[45:34] resolved. Dedicated to this place in
[45:37] Christ.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Might be here as a young person,
[45:42] unmarried person, which is fine. Single
[45:46] person is no less has no less meaning to
[45:49] you. Don't let the enemy
[45:53] distract or take something away from you
[45:55] that belongs to you. That is something
[45:58] that I'm so so consumed with.
[46:02] In the message of oneness, brother
[46:04] Brandon said that God's purpose, he said
[46:07] that's God's purpose. And his purpose as
[46:09] father,
[46:11] as father supreme, was to be one with
[46:14] his family. That was his purpose as
[46:17] father supreme to be one with his
[46:20] family, his earthly family, Adam and
[46:22] Eve. And the only way that they could be
[46:26] one with the family
[46:28] or with God was because God's nature was
[46:33] in them.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Do you hear that?
[46:36] We need his nature
[46:38] &gt;&gt; in us.
[46:41] Oh, how I need that.
[46:43] So that made them with God's nature in
[46:45] them. Then with each other and God, they
[46:49] became all one. He said, "And isn't that
[46:51] a beautiful picture?" And I say, "Yes,
[46:53] brother Brandham. That's a beautiful
[46:54] picture, and it's a picture I desire
[46:57] that I might possess and have.
[47:01] God in his family, father over all,
[47:05] supreme, no death, no sorrow, no
[47:08] heartaches, no nothing. Just joy
[47:10] unspeakable. Never to be sick. Never to
[47:12] have a heartache. Just one with God.
[47:15] What a picture.
[47:18] The place of blessing for the believer
[47:21] is in Christ. As I said a few moments
[47:24] ago, Eve was sealed. She was safe. She
[47:27] was secure in Adam. And the blessing on
[47:31] her
[47:33] was irrevocable.
[47:35] God would not take it back. He blessed
[47:38] them and he wouldn't take that blessing
[47:40] back. He's blessed the bride of Jesus
[47:42] Christ in Christ and he won't take it
[47:45] back.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? Not going to
[47:47] change his mind. Say, "Oh, maybe I, you
[47:50] know, maybe I should uh re-speak that or
[47:53] rethink that." No, it's it it's
[47:55] irvocable. He's just declared it and
[47:58] that's all it is.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they in Christ,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; accepted in the beloved.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:09] Just hang on because I want to go a
[48:11] little bit further.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; It's important to understand also that
[48:16] both man and woman's place is in Christ.
[48:21] Both man and woman. It's not enough for
[48:23] the woman to say, "Oh, let's my husband
[48:24] needs to do it." Or, you know, no. And
[48:26] and for every person, we all have to
[48:29] have that individual
[48:32] relationship
[48:33] of being in Christ. Okay, you say how
[48:36] how am I in Christ? Well, perhaps I
[48:40] can't give you the fullest and the most
[48:42] complete. But I say one thing, one of
[48:45] the one of the first things I would tell
[48:47] you is what I've already alluded to this
[48:51] evening, and that is a steady diet.
[48:58] I could look at a at a beautiful
[49:02] Thanksgiving turkey dinner or Christmas
[49:05] dinner or whatever more beautiful
[49:07] prepared dinner. I can just look at it,
[49:09] figure out now scientifically,
[49:11] how can I be one with this dinner?
[49:15] How am I going to be one with this
[49:17] turkey? How's it going to work? And
[49:20] what's it going to do? And get all the
[49:22] theology of it. Forget the theology.
[49:25] Just eat it.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Just dive into it.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Just start eating it and taking it down
[49:31] and thinking about it and reading it and
[49:33] pondering it and memorize it and say it
[49:36] over and over. When you get into
[49:37] something, say, "I find that hard to I
[49:39] find it hard to comprehend." Just say it
[49:42] again. Keep saying it again. And
[49:44] finally, it'll come into you.
[49:46] Hallelujah. And the prophet said, "How
[49:48] many times?" Say it until you believe
[49:50] it. Just say it and ponder it. That's
[49:52] the That's the best advice I can give
[49:54] you of becoming one with it.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; And it works.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; It absolutely works.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you think enough about
[50:02] him, you won't have time to think about
[50:04] all the negative things and all the
[50:06] trouble and all the problems.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; If you got any questions, just think
[50:10] about the word. Think about the message.
[50:12] Take it in. And the questions, believe
[50:14] it or not, the questions will get
[50:15] answered.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; You got burdens.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; If you haven't, come my way. And I'll
[50:20] give you a few.
[50:23] We got lots of things to be burdened
[50:25] about, but the best way to remain
[50:28] energized.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Had people come to me and I, you know,
[50:36] so once in a while you say something
[50:37] personal, say, I've been preaching, you
[50:39] know, my wife is here and we've been
[50:41] married 53 years. And and somebody came
[50:43] up says, you've been married 53 years.
[50:45] You just preached like a young man. I
[50:47] was so glad. I felt better about being a
[50:50] young man almost and being married 53
[50:52] years.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; My wife knows what I'm saying.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful to just feel that
[51:03] supernatural
[51:04] &gt;&gt; energy. You don't have to put it on.
[51:06] It's it's just there. It's part of the
[51:07] word.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Say, where does it come from? Where does
[51:10] the enthusiasm come? Comes right out of
[51:11] the message, sir.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't read the message and
[51:14] feel depressed. If you feel depressed,
[51:18] take on the word.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Eat it.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Not eat the turkey. Eat the lamb.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eat the lamb. Just keep
[51:25] eating on it.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; You'll be surprised what it'll do for
[51:28] you. You'll be surprised what it'll do
[51:30] for this congregation. Every answer,
[51:32] Christ is the answer. Christ is the word
[51:36] &gt;&gt; and we are accepted. You're accepted in
[51:38] him.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; God won't take it back.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. See, brother Ryan
[51:44] saying, "Amen." And brother Ryan flew
[51:45] all all night to come down to Tennessee
[51:48] and play the piano. It was wonderful,
[51:51] Brother Ryan. I'm sure proud of you.
[51:53] Thank you. God bless you.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Just keep saying amen. I'll look your
[51:58] way every once in a while.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I just like the thought of being sealed
[52:03] in him.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it just feels so good.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Just sealed. I'm secure. Take that,
[52:08] devil.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Take that.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take that old negative
[52:13] thing. Yes, sir.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You hear all kinds of
[52:16] things when after I've got all loaded
[52:18] with all kinds of negative things, I
[52:20] just like to think about being sealed in
[52:23] him, being accepted in him. Tell the
[52:26] devil, you can't do anything with me.
[52:28] I'm untouchable.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm in the second Adam.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; That's not just some hype. That's the
[52:34] truth of God's word.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Believe it and you'll enjoy it. Don't
[52:42] believe it. You'll stay where you're at.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; You don't want to stay where you're at,
[52:48] do you?
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, good. Good. Then I'm preaching to
[52:51] the right crowd.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] All right.
[52:57] In uh in Corinthians, Paul said this,
[53:01] "Be ye followers of me even as I also am
[53:06] of Christ."
[53:07] &gt;&gt; That's what we all need to say. Parents
[53:09] need to say that to children.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:12] Follow me.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Mothers need to say that to their
[53:15] children, to their daughters.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Husbands need to say it to their wives
[53:19] and their family.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Follow me as I follow Christ.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; That's a fine line, so I'll I'll just
[53:27] get off it.
[53:29] You might be called to be a housewife.
[53:32] Brother Brandham says in the great
[53:34] warrior David, you might be called to be
[53:36] a housewife.
[53:38] How many housewives have we got?
[53:43] You're called to be a housewife,
[53:46] but you got a position in Christ.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, you might think that that's hard.
[53:55] You got a position. If you're washing
[53:57] pans or washing clothes or serving your
[54:01] family or serving your husband, you've
[54:04] got a position is in Christ.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] We're not just talking about some, you
[54:10] know, uh uh how to live a better life.
[54:13] Here's a prophet saying, "You got your
[54:15] position in Christ Jesus by the Holy
[54:18] Ghost." And he said, "Amen."
[54:20] You're just as much David as the rest of
[54:24] them was.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Accepted.
[54:30] Acceptance is expressed in a number of
[54:32] ways in the Bible. It's expressed a
[54:35] number of ways. And I got thinking uh
[54:38] you know I made this very personal
[54:39] thought. How do I know I'm accepted? You
[54:42] might say, "Oh, brother brother Ed,
[54:44] you're up there. You're pastor. You know
[54:46] you're accepted." Well, no. I like to
[54:47] ask myself that question. You know, I
[54:49] just read it. It's a phrase. How do I
[54:51] know I'm accepted? Everybody thinks
[54:52] they're accepted. All kinds of people.
[54:55] So, I I I I bring it right down to
[54:57] ground zero. I say, "Well, number one, I
[54:59] got a message.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; And number two, that message was brought
[55:03] by a vindicated prophet." And he did
[55:06] things that no man has done worldwide
[55:09] around the globe since Adam.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; You can't find if you've got it in a
[55:14] history book. I'd like to see it and I
[55:16] want to see the evidence of it. I want
[55:18] to hear it on tape. I want to hear the
[55:21] evidence. You say, "Well, it was before
[55:22] tape." Well, we'd have to have just a
[55:24] absolutely qualified evidence that this
[55:27] happened. And and isn't it amazing that
[55:29] all these hundreds of people and even
[55:31] thousands that I've met and and
[55:33] thousands and thousands of unbelievers,
[55:36] people that don't believe this message
[55:37] and actually hate this message but can't
[55:40] dig up any evidence that even is
[55:42] compares with it.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; So that's why we have a reason to
[55:46] believe what we're believing. It's a
[55:48] supernatural gospel.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; God did something for us and gave us a
[55:53] heart to believe it.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; It's never happened. If it's happened,
[55:56] let's see it. As I was saying in brother
[55:59] Donny's church of people of you know uh
[56:02] somebody in Yugoslavia when we were
[56:04] there brother Milco you and I and and I
[56:05] was preaching there in a little church
[56:07] and and a Baptist church and uh a man
[56:10] came up he's from from the United States
[56:12] someplace and he came up and I was
[56:14] putting forward the message and how God
[56:16] sent brother Brandham as a messenger and
[56:18] a prophet messenger. This fell came up
[56:19] and he says, well, well, he says, I
[56:22] believe that Jimmy Swagger's carrying
[56:23] the ball now.
[56:27] I wonder if he believes that today.
[56:33] Respectfully, people who thought and
[56:36] came under the influence of others that
[56:37] thought they really carrying the ball
[56:39] found out they fumbled the ball
[56:42] &gt;&gt; badly,
[56:43] &gt;&gt; badly. But we're following a message and
[56:45] a messenger that never fumbled the ball.
[56:48] He packed it. He packed it across the
[56:51] goal line and won a and and won a a a
[56:54] great victory for Christ. Can you not
[56:56] say amen to that?
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I don't know what that
[57:02] man achieved in Yugoslavia, but I'm glad
[57:04] for the message the way it is today in
[57:06] the in the many countries that came out
[57:08] of the former Yugoslavia.
[57:12] and some I was in a I was in a a motel
[57:18] down there in some meetings and they've
[57:19] got a TBN I think it is uh Trinity
[57:22] Broadcasting or something once a while
[57:24] like to see you know what are these
[57:25] fellas saying turn it on believe it or
[57:28] not this exactly what it was a man and a
[57:30] woman sitting there like Hollywood style
[57:33] you know like these television programs
[57:36] they were ministers and he looks right
[57:39] at the camera he says you know right now
[57:41] and he says to his wife, you know, right
[57:43] now, he said, you just feel something.
[57:46] There's somebody in Texas, he said, has
[57:48] got a pain in their knee.
[57:51] And I said, oh my god, how can anybody
[57:54] believe that? Almost everybody in Texas
[57:56] got a pain in their knee.
[58:02] And and and they go on like that and try
[58:04] to sell that to people as something
[58:06] supernatural. No wonder the world mocks.
[58:10] says they tried to build a tower and
[58:12] didn't have sufficient to build it. But
[58:14] my brother, my sister, that never
[58:16] happened in this message.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got an absolute.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Never once had to say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I
[58:26] have to take that back." We got a word.
[58:28] A word that's clear. A word that's
[58:30] supernatural. A word with power. A word
[58:33] that's cleansing. A word that will give
[58:36] you security and assurance. We're sealed
[58:39] in Christ.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; There isn't a thing that you and I can
[58:46] face in this life or this generation,
[58:49] but what God has has more than given us
[58:52] the uh uh the power within.
[58:56] The Bible says, now I must go along
[58:58] quickly.
[59:00] The Bible says,
[59:03] well, first let me just back up just a
[59:05] wee bit. I said acceptance comes and
[59:07] it's expressed in a number of ways and
[59:10] one of the ways is when God calls and I
[59:14] think that's very important because I
[59:16] don't think you people would be here on
[59:18] a Wednesday evening
[59:21] if you hadn't felt at some point in time
[59:25] the call of God upon your life. Now a
[59:28] lot of people, multitudes, millions have
[59:32] perhaps felt and heard a call of God and
[59:35] they would say so.
[59:37] But I if it's a call of God, then I
[59:40] believe that God will direct that person
[59:44] to the voice
[59:47] &gt;&gt; to achieve what the call was all about.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Samuel was a boy, 12. I understand. Just
[59:54] a boy like some of you lads here in the
[59:57] front seat. 12 years old he was. And he
[1:00:00] heard his name called
[1:00:03] Samuel. Samuel. He goes out to Eli. Eli
[1:00:07] sends him back. I didn't call you. He
[1:00:09] thought Eli was calling him Samuel. And
[1:00:12] the call kept coming. But what the point
[1:00:14] I want to make with you tonight, he had
[1:00:16] already been accepted as God's prophet
[1:00:20] even though he was a lad at at a lad
[1:00:23] hearing the call. In other words,
[1:00:26] hearing the call is evidence that a
[1:00:28] person hearing the call. When the elect
[1:00:31] hear the call, you're already been
[1:00:33] accepted
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; even though you don't know it. Apostle
[1:00:36] Paul on the way to Damascus heard the
[1:00:40] call. He heard his name. Saul soul, why
[1:00:42] persecutest thou me? He was already
[1:00:44] accepted as a prophet or as a apostle to
[1:00:48] the Gentiles already accepted.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; My news to you tonight is when you heard
[1:00:54] the call, go back in your life when you
[1:00:57] heard the call, you're already accepted.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; If you're here tonight and you haven't
[1:01:01] heard that call, or maybe you have heard
[1:01:03] the call, but you haven't said what some
[1:01:06] of these people have said, "Here am I,
[1:01:08] Lord." Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "Send me."
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; When Brother Brandham was young, a boy,
[1:01:14] just young, and God was calling him,
[1:01:17] look what he was calling him to. And
[1:01:20] there he is packing water for his dad's
[1:01:24] alcohol system,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; making whiskey,
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; and he's carrying water, but he hears a
[1:01:30] call. He hears a voice. He He hears
[1:01:34] something. And to him, it's strange. It
[1:01:37] even carries on him to into his married
[1:01:39] life.
[1:01:41] But it was a call of God and he didn't
[1:01:44] know where it was going to take him. He
[1:01:45] didn't understand it. But let me tell
[1:01:48] you when the call came, see I say God
[1:01:51] indicates his acceptance in a number of
[1:01:54] ways. And one of the main ways is he
[1:01:56] calls the individual. And when God calls
[1:01:59] the elect, there's no turning back.
[1:02:04] I haven't got time to go into that in as
[1:02:07] deep as I would like to.
[1:02:09] But then the Bible speaks of Christ and
[1:02:12] I want to come to this beloved one. If
[1:02:14] you just give me your attention for
[1:02:17] another about 15 minutes and I'm going
[1:02:18] to close. And there came a voice from
[1:02:21] heaven saying, "Thou art my beloved son
[1:02:26] in whom I'm well pleased." And in uh
[1:02:30] Luke's gospel
[1:02:32] 3 and22 it says and the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] descended in a bodily shape like a dove
[1:02:38] upon him in a voice from heaven which
[1:02:41] said thou art my beloved son. In thee
[1:02:45] I'm well pleased. You're not just my
[1:02:48] son. You're my beloved son. And the
[1:02:51] apostle Paul has picked that up and he
[1:02:54] says you are accepted in the beloved.
[1:02:57] Not you're just accepted in the son, but
[1:03:00] you're accepted in the beloved son.
[1:03:02] Apostle Paul is picking something up
[1:03:05] here. There's a special a special
[1:03:08] relationship that God is is giving uh
[1:03:12] audible declaration on earth. You are my
[1:03:15] beloved son. This is my beloved son.
[1:03:18] Hear ye him.
[1:03:20] No wonder, no wonder God's messenger in
[1:03:24] this day would say and even title
[1:03:27] messages,
[1:03:29] hear ye him.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. This is my beloved son. And
[1:03:34] brother Brandham put it in whom in whom
[1:03:37] I dwell.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you've been accepted in
[1:03:42] that son. I want to dwell on that.
[1:03:45] That's a blessed thing. And we ought to
[1:03:47] give thanks to God tonight. Oh God, that
[1:03:50] you put me. We could say, well, thank
[1:03:51] you that we have this place. It's
[1:03:53] comfortable and I've got a nice seat to
[1:03:55] sit on. That's just that that doesn't
[1:03:57] amount to anything. But when we can say,
[1:03:59] I've come into a special place.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; God has brought me into a special place.
[1:04:06] Into his beloved son,
[1:04:08] someone who he's looked on. Now think
[1:04:13] about this, please.
[1:04:17] When God looked on Adam,
[1:04:20] God knew that Eve was in him.
[1:04:27] God also knew that Adam could not create
[1:04:30] Eve.
[1:04:33] He'd only go to sleep
[1:04:36] and God would do the act of taking Eve
[1:04:38] from him.
[1:04:40] But when God looked on Christ, he didn't
[1:04:43] only know that Christ,
[1:04:47] that Eve, the second Eve, he didn't only
[1:04:49] see you and I in him follow this God's
[1:04:54] infinite. He knew that this son was
[1:04:59] going to be obedient. He's going to take
[1:05:01] every step. He knew that he would go to
[1:05:04] the cross willingly. And at the at
[1:05:07] Calvary, he's going to pay for the woman
[1:05:09] that was in him.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Are you following that?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; And he knew further because he was the
[1:05:16] word. And that was the word that had
[1:05:18] come out of the logos in the beginning.
[1:05:21] At some at some I can't even say a point
[1:05:24] in time because there was no time. But
[1:05:26] in that great eternity, the prophet said
[1:05:29] he'd take a little journey and a little
[1:05:31] light came out from that from from that
[1:05:34] being. little light, little white light
[1:05:37] came out. There was a logos and that
[1:05:39] logos was the word said in another
[1:05:42] place. It was the sun. It was the son of
[1:05:44] God that came out. It was that it was
[1:05:47] the logos. It was that word that and by
[1:05:50] that force he was going to create
[1:05:52] everything. So in the beginning was the
[1:05:55] word and the word was with God and the
[1:05:57] word was God. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says all things were made
[1:06:04] by him and without him was nothing made
[1:06:07] that is made. And so here's this here's
[1:06:09] this one now is on earth. This one by
[1:06:13] whom and the God that was in him that he
[1:06:16] was the very word the word now was made
[1:06:20] flesh. And by that word everything was
[1:06:22] created that had been created but in him
[1:06:26] was a bride that had not yet been
[1:06:28] created.
[1:06:30] Hallelujah.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And when God said, "This is my beloved
[1:06:35] son," he knew that that son also was
[1:06:38] going to speak some more words.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. And the spirit that was in
[1:06:43] him was going to come into his chosen
[1:06:45] ones, his apostles, and they would
[1:06:48] speak, and God would bring forth by
[1:06:51] creative power
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; a bride. He'd create you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; He'd create me. He created this body of
[1:06:59] people by that which was in Christ when
[1:07:02] he looked on him and said beloved son
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; and that's why the apostle Paul said we
[1:07:07] are accepted in the beloved actually
[1:07:11] we've been created by the beloved
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; why don't we loosen up and give the Lord
[1:07:19] a clap offer
[1:07:25] been created in the beloved
[1:07:30] We are loved by the beloved.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; You have been created.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You've been made. It's
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; why he said he made us accepted in the
[1:07:42] beloved.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Feel like preaching.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's why God looked on
[1:07:50] him. It wasn't just Jesus of Nazareth,
[1:07:53] but it was all that was in him. And the
[1:07:56] prophet of God said clearly over and
[1:07:58] over and over, you were in him.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; So you were in him at Calvary.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; You were in him.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; You lived with him. You died with him.
[1:08:06] But you were in him when God looked on
[1:08:09] him and said, "My beloved son.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You were in him then. I was in him. You
[1:08:17] were in him." And all that he was, you
[1:08:18] are.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he poured everything
[1:08:22] into Christ. and from Christ poured
[1:08:24] everything into the church.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Beloved,
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; can't have a beloved son without having
[1:08:32] a beloved wife.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; She's beloved.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why he had joy in his
[1:08:40] heart to give his life for her.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives as Christ
[1:08:45] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:08:49] it.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah.
[1:08:57] When God made this audible declaration,
[1:09:01] he saw us in his beloved son.
[1:09:05] And this son by whom all things were
[1:09:07] created.
[1:09:09] In him was life, the scripture says, and
[1:09:11] the life was the light of all men.
[1:09:14] He was the word before he was flesh,
[1:09:18] was he not? And we were in him in word
[1:09:22] form
[1:09:23] before the word became flesh.
[1:09:27] John 1 and4 in him was life and the life
[1:09:29] was the light of man. John 1 and3 and
[1:09:32] all things were made by him and without
[1:09:34] him was not anything made that was made.
[1:09:39] You were made by him
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and for him.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Your mother and father in the natural
[1:09:45] birth brought you forth. But don't put
[1:09:48] too much emphasis on that.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's not the important part of this.
[1:09:54] They were just instruments to bring
[1:09:56] forth a body in whom God would dwell.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God didn't reveal himself to
[1:10:03] you in your flesh, in just your mortal
[1:10:05] ears. God revealed himself to you in
[1:10:08] your soul. Hallelujah. Your spirit was
[1:10:11] quickened. It was so all-encompassing
[1:10:13] that you couldn't even tell what part of
[1:10:15] you it your whole being was just gripped
[1:10:18] by the revelation of God's word
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; and the light that went on in your soul.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Isn't that true?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; And he does that. He does that and did
[1:10:30] that because she's beloved.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He said and show us the father. He said,
[1:10:40] "Look at the beginning there." He said,
[1:10:42] "I see this great space yonder and then
[1:10:44] the logos went out of God which was
[1:10:46] Christ." I'm not repeating. I'm just
[1:10:48] giving I speak preach it and then I back
[1:10:51] up and and give the quote so you know
[1:10:53] just how it's worded. He said, "And the
[1:10:56] logos went out from God which was the
[1:10:58] Christ, the anointing that went out and
[1:11:00] we're standing on the banister watching
[1:11:02] the creation come into existence and see
[1:11:05] whether he was the son." Now in the
[1:11:08] Hebrew series chapter 1, the logos and
[1:11:11] this great fountain, this great fountain
[1:11:13] of spirit which had no beginning or no
[1:11:15] end, this great spirit began to form in
[1:11:19] the creation. And the logos that went
[1:11:21] out uh from it was the son of God. It
[1:11:24] was the only visible form that this
[1:11:27] spirit had and it was a theophony which
[1:11:30] means a body and this body was like a
[1:11:33] man. And he goes on to describe it. I
[1:11:35] tell you what, friends, I say never a
[1:11:38] man speak like this man.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; May be more eloquent people, but as far
[1:11:46] as I'm concerned, there isn't any more
[1:11:48] eloquent words
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; because those eloquent people don't
[1:11:51] somehow include you and grip you and
[1:11:55] bring you into the picture. What this
[1:11:57] prophet of God said brings a people into
[1:11:59] the picture and he identifies who they
[1:12:01] are. They're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:03] spotless, virtuous, bride of Jesus
[1:12:04] Christ. She's accepted in the beloved,
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; the beloved one,
[1:12:14] sending out the words of his creative
[1:12:16] power, creating his own bride.
[1:12:20] I only have about six minutes and I've
[1:12:22] got a ways to go, but I'm I'm not going
[1:12:24] to be long.
[1:12:26] But this is a if you want to read it,
[1:12:28] you want to read it at home. It's a
[1:12:31] leodyian church age. It's in chapter 9
[1:12:34] and it's a 336 page 336 of the church
[1:12:38] age book and and this is so outstanding.
[1:12:42] He says, "And now he is standing." He's
[1:12:44] speaking of him standing amongst the the
[1:12:46] candlestick. He said, "And now he's
[1:12:48] standing in the midst of the church." As
[1:12:51] he stands there revealing who he is in
[1:12:54] the last age. When he begins to reveal
[1:12:56] himself, whoever he's revealing himself
[1:12:58] personally is accepted
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; He's revealing himself personally to the
[1:13:05] individuals that's accepted in him
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; and he's revealing himself in the last
[1:13:09] days. He calls himself the author uh of
[1:13:12] the creation of God. This is another
[1:13:15] creation. This has this has to do with
[1:13:19] the church. This is a special
[1:13:21] designation of himself. He is the
[1:13:24] creator of that church. The heavenly
[1:13:27] bridegroom created his own bride. Oh,
[1:13:31] now before he even took the place of
[1:13:33] bridegroom when he was here on earth and
[1:13:35] God the father called it, spoke out of
[1:13:38] heaven said audibly, "This is my beloved
[1:13:42] son."
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And he was speaking to him, speaking to
[1:13:46] the people. And in him was the very
[1:13:49] words of life. Hadn't spoken them yet.
[1:13:52] that would create a people.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; My brothers and sisters, tonight I want
[1:13:56] to declare to you, even though you may
[1:13:59] know this, but that'll be emphasized and
[1:14:02] and uh uh reconfirmed in your heart, we
[1:14:05] are we are the object that have been
[1:14:08] created by words that have originated in
[1:14:12] that beloved son. He may have used other
[1:14:15] people and in this day he used a prophet
[1:14:18] to utter that breath of God out of his
[1:14:20] mouth creating a people. And you're not
[1:14:24] here by accident. You're not here even
[1:14:26] by your own choice.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; You're here because God elected to
[1:14:31] reveal himself to you. And when he begin
[1:14:34] to reveal himself to you, identify you
[1:14:36] and call you out. That is that is what I
[1:14:39] call being called by your name
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; because he he begins to identify you and
[1:14:44] this becomes very personal.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's your call.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; He said he's the creator of that church.
[1:14:53] The heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:14:55] bride as the spirit of God. As the
[1:14:58] spirit of God he came down and created
[1:15:00] in the virgin Mary the cells from which
[1:15:03] his body was born. He says, I want to
[1:15:06] repeat that he created the very cells in
[1:15:08] the womb of Mary for that body. I was
[1:15:11] challenged right here in the office here
[1:15:13] by one of the leaders of the Pentecostal
[1:15:15] Assemblies of Canada that he says
[1:15:18] William Brandham says that God created
[1:15:20] Jesus that Jesus was created. I said the
[1:15:23] cell the cell of uh the cell of life was
[1:15:26] created in the womb of Mary. He said oh
[1:15:29] he said he went like that just in like
[1:15:31] in disgust. Oh he said how can you
[1:15:33] believe that? And I and he I said,
[1:15:35] "Well, who was Jesus?" He said, "Jesus
[1:15:37] was God." I said, "Amen." I said, "Uh, I
[1:15:40] can say amen to that." But I said, "Did
[1:15:42] your God issue out of the womb of a
[1:15:45] woman?"
[1:15:48] He thought about that. Great big tall
[1:15:50] fellow sat back, thought about. I said,
[1:15:52] "Did your God
[1:15:55] cry out, "Father, take this cup from me
[1:15:59] if it's possible." Did your God gasp
[1:16:04] his last breaths on the cross and in
[1:16:07] fact die. Jesus Christ died.
[1:16:12] Did your God die? Did it Did your God
[1:16:14] come out of a woman a woman and die on a
[1:16:17] cross?
[1:16:20] See, then he was stumped. And I just
[1:16:22] when I say they're backpedaling, when I
[1:16:24] say that they're insecure, then I come
[1:16:26] on strong. I said, "You don't understand
[1:16:28] the Godhead. You come here to explain it
[1:16:30] to me. You don't know what it's about."
[1:16:32] Well, he says, "I'm going to get a
[1:16:34] certain certain man pastor from
[1:16:36] downtown." He says, "Would you meet with
[1:16:37] him?" He really knows the Godhead. I
[1:16:39] said, "Sure, bring him." Never did come.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; God started with the new creation
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and he stepped into it.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The word, the logos
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; that came out from him in the beginning
[1:16:56] and here he is on earth. Oh my goodness.
[1:16:59] I'm having a hard time stopping.
[1:17:02] There's a wonderful word we have.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And as the spirit came
[1:17:06] down was in a body was born." And then
[1:17:09] he said the uh it it was the cells in
[1:17:12] the womb of Mary for that body. It's not
[1:17:14] enough for the Holy Spirit to simply
[1:17:16] give life to human oam supplied by Mary.
[1:17:20] He said that would have been a sinful
[1:17:21] mankind producing a baby. He says that
[1:17:24] would not have produced the last Adam.
[1:17:27] of him it is said, "Lo, a body hast thou
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; prepared for me."
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This didn't come from a man.
[1:17:36] It didn't come from Mary. It came from
[1:17:38] God. God made this body.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God stepped into it.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Mary was a human incubator. She carried
[1:17:48] that holy child and brought him to
[1:17:49] birth. It was a God man. He was the son
[1:17:52] of God. He was the new creation man. And
[1:17:56] God met and joined. He was the first of
[1:17:58] the new race. He was the head of this
[1:18:01] new race. I'm glad I'm part of that
[1:18:03] race.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I'm part of that super group.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body of the church.
[1:18:12] Paul said in Colossians,
[1:18:15] therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's
[1:18:17] a new creation. And then he goes on to
[1:18:20] say, "And that you put on the new man,
[1:18:23] which after God has created in
[1:18:24] righteousness, the new creation, not the
[1:18:27] old creation made over." Hello.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; This is not the old creation made over.
[1:18:33] This is not the creation that came by
[1:18:35] sex that's just fixed up.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Want to say amen to that?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; It's not just something that's patched
[1:18:43] up,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; something that came through the human
[1:18:45] race and it's just fixed up. This is a
[1:18:47] new creation. You're in the new
[1:18:49] creation. He called you in the new
[1:18:52] creation.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's another creation. He
[1:18:56] said, distinct from the old one. Oh,
[1:18:59] thank God. I feel like doing a dance.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; It's a new creation. Distinct from the
[1:19:05] old creation.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:09] Brother Wesley had Wesley had brought
[1:19:12] some young people down from up from
[1:19:14] Georgia and a young man gave his life to
[1:19:18] Christ in the Sunday night meeting right
[1:19:20] while the preaching was on. He just
[1:19:21] surrendered his life and gave his life
[1:19:23] to Christ. Been coming to church at
[1:19:25] brother Dutch Scott's there a little bit
[1:19:26] and and uh announced to me after the
[1:19:28] service he said, "Grandpa, why don't you
[1:19:30] shake hands with him?" He said he he
[1:19:32] received Christ while you were
[1:19:34] preaching. Oh my goodness. become a new
[1:19:37] creation. Not an old creation fixed up,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; not part of the old creation.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And he goes on to say, if I can just my
[1:19:52] my I'm trying to rush through here. It's
[1:19:54] another creation distinct from the old
[1:19:56] one. No longer is he dealing by the ways
[1:19:59] of the flesh. That was how he dealt with
[1:20:01] Israel. He chose Abraham and of
[1:20:03] Abraham's issue through the godly Isaac
[1:20:06] line. But now out of every kindred,
[1:20:08] tribe and nation, he has purposed a new
[1:20:11] creation. He is the first of that
[1:20:13] creation. He was God created in the form
[1:20:16] of a man of man. And now by his spirit,
[1:20:19] he is creating many sons unto himself.
[1:20:22] God the creator creating himself a part
[1:20:25] of his creation.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; This is the true revelation of God. He
[1:20:30] said
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; this was his purpose. This purpose, this
[1:20:34] purpose took form through election. That
[1:20:37] is why he could look down through to the
[1:20:40] last stage. Hello. Here we are, father.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Here we are. He could look through to
[1:20:45] the last stage. He says he sees you
[1:20:48] sitting here on a Wednesday evening.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; He can look down to this last age. right
[1:20:55] down to this last age when all would be
[1:20:57] over and see himself still in the midst
[1:21:00] of the church as author of his new
[1:21:02] creation, the new creation of God. His
[1:21:05] sovereign power brought it to pass and
[1:21:08] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:21:11] of his new cre of this new creation. He
[1:21:14] predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:21:16] children according to his good pleasure.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. Thou art my beloved son.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; You're in that son. You're in that word,
[1:21:25] united with him. And by his omniscience
[1:21:28] and omn omnipotence, he brought it to
[1:21:31] pass. How else could he know that he
[1:21:33] would be standing in the midst of the
[1:21:35] church, receiving glory from his
[1:21:37] brethren, if he did not make sure all
[1:21:40] things he knew, and all things he worked
[1:21:42] out according to what he knew in order
[1:21:45] that his purpose and good pleasure be
[1:21:47] brought to pass. And then he goes, "In
[1:21:50] whom also we have obtained an
[1:21:52] inheritance, being predestinated
[1:21:54] according to the purpose of him who
[1:21:57] workketh all things after the council of
[1:21:59] his own good will."
[1:22:01] Amen. And lo, a voice from heaven. This
[1:22:06] is Matthew 3:17, which we read, "This is
[1:22:09] my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:22:12] pleased." And while they yet spake,
[1:22:16] while he yet spake, behold, as Peter was
[1:22:18] speaking,
[1:22:20] just speaking some words, let's build
[1:22:22] three tabernacles. And while he spake,
[1:22:26] uh, cloud overshadowed them. And behold,
[1:22:29] a voice. This is my beloved son in whom
[1:22:33] I'm well pleased. Hear ye him. And when
[1:22:36] he be to speak, a race of people came
[1:22:40] out of it.
[1:22:42] Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; A super race of people.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; I don't have to pump you up. That's what
[1:22:47] he said.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. I only try to get
[1:22:50] you to believe it. I try to convince
[1:22:53] myself. This old doubting mind. You need
[1:22:56] to believe that. Biscll
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; and everybody on internet hears that.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And I say to you, you need to believe
[1:23:04] it.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And you on internet, you need to believe
[1:23:06] it.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said it's a super race
[1:23:09] and the devil will do everything to cut
[1:23:12] that down.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Can I read a couple more things just
[1:23:26] before I close?
[1:23:38] the the the term accepted
[1:23:41] that you're accepted in the beloved.
[1:23:44] It's not just accepted as we we say,
[1:23:47] well, uh here's a gift. Will you accept
[1:23:50] this gift? It's not just a matter of
[1:23:52] receiving and giving. That's not the
[1:23:55] kind because the Bible speaks of it that
[1:23:58] they heard the gospel. They received it
[1:24:00] and they accepted they they accepted the
[1:24:03] word. They heard the word. They received
[1:24:05] the word. And that's exactly the same
[1:24:06] word as accepted, but not this accepted.
[1:24:10] When this one says, when Paul says
[1:24:12] you're accepted in the beloved, this is
[1:24:14] the accepted in the Greek, please. You
[1:24:16] are highly favored.
[1:24:19] To make one accepted. If you weren't,
[1:24:22] he's going to make you accepted.
[1:24:25] To pursue with grace.
[1:24:28] Oh my goodness. Think of it in your own
[1:24:32] wayward way,
[1:24:34] going your own direction as hard as you
[1:24:37] could go. This one pursued you,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; followed hard after you, and pursued you
[1:24:47] with grace, to compass, with favor, to
[1:24:51] honor, with blessings. And it comes from
[1:24:53] the word grace. This word accepted
[1:24:56] actually comes from the root word grace.
[1:24:59] to be accepted in the beloved, to make
[1:25:02] them, and to pursue them. But it comes
[1:25:05] from grace. Grace, that which affords
[1:25:07] joy, hello.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Pleasure.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Delight,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; sweetness, loveliness.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; It's not a dragged out,
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; sad, sour.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Dill pickle injection of some sort. It's
[1:25:24] not some vinegar experience. This is
[1:25:26] something that's lovely,
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; sweet, wonderful, happy, joyful. Say,
[1:25:33] "Oh, but the pressures of the world,
[1:25:35] this is greater than the pressures of
[1:25:37] the world." Says, "I got such burdens.
[1:25:40] This is greater than I'm telling you
[1:25:41] tonight. Greater than any burden you've
[1:25:43] ever had
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; and greater than any burden you ever
[1:25:46] will have."
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; You need to accept this.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You need to receive it. You need to say
[1:25:54] yay and amen
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; to it tonight. There is no other way.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have any other option.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talking to a woman. Bear
[1:26:04] with me a few minutes. My I'm trying to
[1:26:06] close. But brother Brandham talking to a
[1:26:08] woman and and and and speaking to her.
[1:26:10] He says this is her only alternative.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; I never never mentioned that. Never
[1:26:17] caught it just like that. He said it's
[1:26:19] her alternative. She's accepted her
[1:26:21] alternative. And I want to say to this
[1:26:23] congregation tonight, this is your only
[1:26:26] alternative.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; You don't have a whole bunch of options.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; There isn't a whole bunch of ways to
[1:26:32] become a beloved, accepted, and received
[1:26:36] into beloved. There isn't a whole lot of
[1:26:38] ways. This is the way in the name of
[1:26:40] Jesus Christ. Walk ye in it.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Receive it. Accept it. Deny
[1:26:46] everything else. Even now in your own
[1:26:48] heart, say, "I deny everything that's
[1:26:50] opposed to that.
[1:26:53] Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; You might be inclined to say, "Oh,
[1:26:56] Brother Ed, you don't know what I'm
[1:26:57] going through." I'll tell you, you don't
[1:26:59] know the burdens I bear. And the only
[1:27:02] thing that gives you sustaining grace is
[1:27:03] this.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you don't even have
[1:27:06] a burden.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; You only got a phobe.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Satan tried to put a phobe on you that
[1:27:12] you've got some great big in
[1:27:14] insurmountable thing. It's not
[1:27:16] insurmountable. I deny it in the name of
[1:27:19] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Deny that phobe.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Deny that thing.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; It's just a doubt. I'm going to preach
[1:27:28] till it's gone.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the sooner you get rid of it,
[1:27:32] the sooner I can end.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have a problem.
[1:27:39] We got the We got the source. We got the
[1:27:42] alternative.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; The only alternative there is. Let this
[1:27:46] congregation rise and accept it in the
[1:27:49] name of Jesus Christ. Glory to God.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; This is abundant grace.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; This is his grace. You are accepted in
[1:28:00] the beloved.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; He's not going to deny you.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; He's accepted you. When he called you,
[1:28:06] he accepted you.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; You're accepted in the beloved.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; What a joy. What a glorious position to
[1:28:12] be in.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:28:16] Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Why don't we just stand? We're thanking
[1:28:20] him. Glory.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; I heard some heard some comments that
[1:28:29] Brother Tony was making when he came up
[1:28:31] to pray and I thought it was so striking
[1:28:35] because there were just so much like uh
[1:28:39] a quote that I had here and I've got to
[1:28:42] close with this quote. That's our
[1:28:43] position of a believer in Christ. He
[1:28:46] says, "And through the blood, washing of
[1:28:49] the blood, taking away, separating of
[1:28:51] sin." That the Holy Spirit woos the
[1:28:55] believer. He's pursued you and he woos
[1:28:58] you. He woos the believer through the
[1:29:00] blood.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Cleansing. cleansing of the soul into
[1:29:06] the fellowship into the spirit life
[1:29:09] inside Christ inside with Christ.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; He woos you. That's what he's doing
[1:29:16] tonight. That's why I'm preaching. The
[1:29:18] Holy Spirit is wooing you
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; to fellowship through the blood into
[1:29:24] Christ.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And he says, he says this, "Shut out the
[1:29:30] world. The very nature of God is in you.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen each time? Each time it
[1:29:36] registers, still subject to mistakes,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; but God can't see it
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; because it's covered by the blood.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; God can't see through the blood.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Every time he looks through the blood,
[1:29:50] it looks white.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He looks through the blood, it looks
[1:29:54] white. He said again, so of God was so
[1:29:57] pleased with Christ till he accepted him
[1:30:01] and said, "This is my beloved son in
[1:30:04] whom I'm well pleased." And through
[1:30:06] Christ being the perfect one, us dead to
[1:30:09] our own thoughts and ideas, being born
[1:30:12] of the spirit of God, walking not after
[1:30:16] the theology, but after the spirit
[1:30:18] inside of us. Then let the dead, let the
[1:30:22] dead in Christ walk not after the things
[1:30:24] of the world, but after the things of
[1:30:27] the spirit.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he says, "So, so you're
[1:30:32] inside of Christ."
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; And in him, you're accepted
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; into beloved.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, how wonderful.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory to God. How we thank you,
[1:30:47] Lord. Bless your people. Bless the super
[1:30:51] race. Bless this virtuous bride. Oh God,
[1:30:54] those that still may feel a twinge of
[1:30:57] something negative in their heart, I
[1:31:00] pray that you'll bind it up.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I pray that you'll cast it out. And
[1:31:04] every spirit of hell that would try to
[1:31:07] utter a lie to your people. I pray you
[1:31:10] will cut off his breath and cut off his
[1:31:12] words and cut off his attempt to speak
[1:31:15] to the people of God. In the name of
[1:31:17] Jesus Christ as a servant of Christ and
[1:31:20] the church of the living God, we cast
[1:31:22] him out.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Victory in Jesus.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Victory in this beloved one.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; What a glorious Christ.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:38] Blessed be his name.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless that wonderful name
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; of Jesus.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. Let's worship him.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Bless that wonderful name of Jesus.
[1:31:50] Don't even know how it goes exactly.
[1:31:55] We need to worship him now.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, we'll bless that wonderful name of
[1:32:01] Jesus.
[1:32:04] Bless and wonderful name of Jesus.
[1:32:10] How blessed that wonderful name of
[1:32:13] Jesus.

[1:32:56] remember it. I just say the sweetest
[1:32:57] name I know. If I run into a line, I
[1:32:59] don't know exactly the word, I just make
[1:33:01] up one.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; The Lord knows what's in my heart
[1:33:05] anyway.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the songwriter says to
[1:33:09] me. It's the sweetest name right now. So
[1:33:12] I'll bless that wonderful name of Jesus.

[1:34:15] the Lord.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:34:21] Glory. I can tell you the devil hates it
[1:34:24] when you when you give him praise and
[1:34:26] thanksgiving. We're magnifying him.
[1:34:30] We're magnifying his sacrifice at
[1:34:32] Calvary where he bought us and now came
[1:34:34] and redeemed us and claimed us to his
[1:34:37] own.
[1:34:38] Let's say also he looked beyond our
[1:34:40] fault and saw our need.

[1:36:54] the gra.
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:13] is one of our brothers and his wife that
[1:37:15] are going to be traveling east. They've
[1:37:18] not had their family dedicated. Would we
[1:37:20] have just a few minutes while Brother
[1:37:22] Tom prays a prayer of dedication on
[1:37:24] them? I wanted Brother Roberto and
[1:37:26] sister uh Mary, would you please come
[1:37:30] bring the children here while we sing it
[1:37:32] once again.
[1:37:33] faith and the other one I have its name
[1:37:37] here written down too by the time you
[1:37:41] come and do this dedication. I shall for
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:37:58] [Music]
[1:38:05] died for me.
[1:38:07] [Music]
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:12] That grace that my falling soul
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] beyond
[1:38:24] my fall and
[1:38:28] my
[1:38:30] Let's just remain standing while we have
[1:38:32] this prayer dedication.
[1:38:38] We indeed have time
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; for this is a part of the family of God
[1:38:43] that the Lord himself has has dealt
[1:38:46] wonderfully with
[1:38:50] in Mark 10
[1:38:52] verse 13 and verse 14.
[1:38:57] The disciples
[1:38:59] wanted to keep the little children away.
[1:39:02] Lord is just too busy. He said, "Suffer
[1:39:05] the little children to come to me."
[1:39:08] And so when I was in prayer,
[1:39:11] Brother Roberto, Sister Rosemary, before
[1:39:13] the service,
[1:39:15] Lord just dropped a a little thought in
[1:39:17] my heart out of the token message.
[1:39:20] Go see how the prophet dedicated the
[1:39:22] family in the token message.
[1:39:26] So just at the time
[1:39:29] at the ending of the service, brother
[1:39:32] Ram said, "Here's now here's a little
[1:39:34] family, our heavenly father." And he
[1:39:37] mentions Michael and he takes a little
[1:39:39] son and their little daughter.
[1:39:43] And he says, "I lay hands on them."
[1:39:47] No different than Jesus or like Paul. I
[1:39:50] lay hands on them. I dedicate them. I
[1:39:53] lay my hands on them, Lord. May this
[1:39:56] little girl's life, he said, be blessed
[1:39:58] in the kingdom of God. Blessed father,
[1:40:00] blessed mother. May they live long
[1:40:02] lives, happy, see their children in the
[1:40:05] service of God. We ask the blessing. We
[1:40:08] dedicate this family. And I thought, how
[1:40:11] appropriate, brother Roberto, at token
[1:40:14] time, token hour, that we as a people,
[1:40:17] we also can pray that prayer upon this
[1:40:20] little family. God's dealt with brother
[1:40:23] Roberto, Sister Rosemary, and and now
[1:40:26] we've got Desmond, and we have faith.
[1:40:29] They're asking that we would dedicate
[1:40:30] them before the Lord. Let's do that as a
[1:40:33] congregation in the presence of God.
[1:40:41] Heavenly Father,
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; I'm asking Lord that as I
[1:40:58] prot
[1:41:04] you this evening. We've heard your word.
[1:41:08] We're a part of that new creation.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Part of the word as creator. Lord,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; I just pray that you'll keep your hand
[1:41:15] upon this family, upon these children as
[1:41:19] mother and daddy stand here.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; I pray, Father God, that you will
[1:41:24] receive these children in the name of
[1:41:27] Jesus Christ. Bless brother,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; sister Rosemary, make their church.
[1:41:33] May they see Lord Jesus Christ on
[1:41:36] display we pray
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Sister Rosemary. God
[1:41:51] bless you darling. I shall forever I
[1:41:54] just last. I shall forever.
[1:42:03] my eyes to brother and
[1:42:09] to the cross
[1:42:14] where Jesus died for me.
[1:42:21] How much
[1:42:26] the grace that caught my falling soul.
[1:42:33] He looks beyond
[1:42:38] my father and
[1:42:42] mighty.
[1:42:46] God bless you bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:49] give you a safe journey home this night
[1:42:51] tonight. Drive safely on the roads that
[1:42:54] may be a little bit icy.
[1:42:58] We don't know if we'll see tomorrow, but
[1:43:01] I want to I want to make your a promise
[1:43:05] by grace by grace we'll meet. If not
[1:43:09] here, we'll meet at the supper table.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your hope?
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Is that your faith?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Is that your claim? We're going to ask
[1:43:19] brother Andy's to ask God's blessings
[1:43:21] upon us. God bless you, brother Andes.
[1:43:24] Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Our lovely Lord Jesus, words would fail
[1:43:32] us to ever be able to express our
[1:43:35] gratitude for what you've done in our
[1:43:36] lives. this great great
[1:43:41] salvation
[1:43:43] that you have planned in your own mind
[1:43:46] before the foundations of the world and
[1:43:49] included us and even then we were
[1:43:52] accepted in you Lord. Thank you, Lord
[1:43:56] Jesus, for this wonderful work of grace
[1:43:58] and mercy as you've come down in our
[1:44:01] day, us as little children, and you've
[1:44:04] predestinated that we'd be upon the
[1:44:06] earth. You've predestinated our entire
[1:44:09] lives that we would hear this word, this
[1:44:12] delivering word and the blood of Christ,
[1:44:15] the bleeding word, the living word, the
[1:44:18] creative word, and how it's worked in
[1:44:20] our lives, even to bring us to this
[1:44:22] hour, to this service, to hear this
[1:44:25] message tonight, and out on the
[1:44:27] internet, those that's participated in
[1:44:30] this time of worship. Lord, you have
[1:44:32] ordained it. And we pray God, even
[1:44:34] though this night can never be repeated,
[1:44:37] we're asking Lord that you will make it
[1:44:39] a milestone, make it a foundational
[1:44:43] evening for us, Lord. that you will
[1:44:45] build within us the tabernacle of the
[1:44:48] living God, even a powerhouse in each
[1:44:51] life, Lord, to be the very powerhouse as
[1:44:54] your prophet said, bringing forth life
[1:44:58] and virtue into this dying world and
[1:45:01] literally bringing forth additional sons
[1:45:04] and daughters of God by our influence
[1:45:07] and by our lifegiving efforts of
[1:45:10] surrendering to you, Lord. Thus every
[1:45:13] family, every man and woman but boy and
[1:45:16] girl. We pray heavenly father that this
[1:45:18] church as well as other message churches
[1:45:21] throughout the world but we being a part
[1:45:23] of this assembly Lord God would be an
[1:45:26] example in in our homes and our
[1:45:29] individual lives. And Lord that this
[1:45:31] assembly would be an example of the New
[1:45:35] Testament church in power and in
[1:45:37] deliverance. Lord, bless us, Lord, in
[1:45:40] Jesus Christ's name. As we know that we
[1:45:43] are blessed in the beloved. We ask, Lord
[1:45:46] Jesus, your blessing upon us, Lord,
[1:45:49] until we're able to gather again here
[1:45:52] before you this coming Lord's day. In
[1:45:55] the name of Jesus Christ, we ask this
[1:45:58] blessing and give you praise and
[1:46:00] thanksgiving.
[1:46:02] Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Andies,
[1:46:10] I tell you what, a super race knows how
[1:46:12] to pack it in. We're just a couple
[1:46:14] minutes short of two hours.
[1:46:18] You weren't that you you didn't pack
[1:46:20] that much in in any two hours of today.
[1:46:23] We've worshiped, we've prayed, we've
[1:46:25] dedicated a family, we've heard the
[1:46:27] word. The devil's been defeated.
