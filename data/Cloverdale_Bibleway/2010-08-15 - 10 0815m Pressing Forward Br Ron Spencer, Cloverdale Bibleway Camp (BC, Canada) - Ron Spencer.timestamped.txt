[15:19] Perfect redemption.
[15:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[15:24] Praise the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[15:27] We should be the most thankful people on
[15:29] the face of the earth today.
[15:31] Praise the Lord.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask our brother Tim
[15:35] Mandis if you would come and open the
[15:36] service for us. We have one prayer
[15:38] request. We just pray for brother Jason
[15:40] Tagger for guidance for two jobs or
[15:42] wanting God's perfect will to be done.
[15:45] Trusting that unseen hand. Amen. If you
[15:47] have anything in your life that you need
[15:49] guidance for, if you need a touch from
[15:51] the Lord, we have a testimony from our
[15:53] sister Elena Hendrickson. For several
[15:55] weeks, she's been on medication for a
[15:57] severely pulled muscle in her back. She
[15:59] went in for prayer on Thursday night and
[16:01] felt it after that that taking the
[16:02] medication was no longer necessary and
[16:04] since then there's been absolutely no
[16:06] pain where before it had been almost
[16:07] constant. She wants to thank the Lord
[16:09] for her total healing. Amen. Praise God.
[16:14] Brother Tim wants to come up from the
[16:15] service for us.
[16:20] Okay.
[16:21] Brother Tim prays. Uh I just got a
[16:25] received an email from Switzerland and
[16:27] brother uh Jean Jacques uh who we who we
[16:31] prayed for the people from our church.
[16:32] Remember brother Jean Jocks and he and
[16:34] his wife Sister Marinette visit us. We
[16:36] just got an email from his daughter and
[16:39] he was up in service. He was uh uh
[16:41] reading some scripture and speaking
[16:43] speaking to the people and he just
[16:46] completely uh lost uh a lost mental
[16:51] ability of where he was and began to
[16:54] repeat himself again what he had just
[16:57] spoken a couple minutes before. And then
[17:00] two of the brothers came, his son and
[17:02] and brother Daniel Ken Bruner came and
[17:05] stood beside him and uh began to pray.
[17:07] And the people began to pray. They laid
[17:09] a prayer cloth of brother Brandham uh
[17:12] upon him and uh he didn't have any pain
[17:16] or anything but he just lost his mental
[17:19] faculties of where he was and then he
[17:22] couldn't remember anything. He couldn't
[17:24] remember yesterday. He couldn't remember
[17:27] that he had been so terribly sick about
[17:29] a year and a half ago. Couldn't remember
[17:31] any of those details. So they're going
[17:33] to be taking him to the hospital just to
[17:36] see what has taken place. but uh sent
[17:38] word to us so we could join with them in
[17:41] prayer.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; And we've seen too many answers to
[17:43] prayer even this week, have we not?
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, Brother Tim, as
[17:49] you're praying, remember brother Jean
[17:50] Jax.
[17:53] Let's
[17:54] &gt;&gt; all bow our heads. If you have a need,
[17:56] God knows. He knows your need. Just lift
[17:57] it up before him.
[18:01] Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, we come before
[18:02] you this morning, Lord. We're a needy
[18:04] people, Lord. each one of us, Lord. We
[18:06] need more of you, Lord. We need your you
[18:08] to come, Lord Jesus, into our lives.
[18:10] Change us, Lord. Take those things out,
[18:13] Lord Jesus. I believe this weekend,
[18:15] Lord, has just been a dying out to self,
[18:17] oh God. We've been losing the things of
[18:19] this world, oh God, and looking to you,
[18:21] Lord Jesus. Looking to you for the
[18:23] answers, Lord Jesus. Looking to you for
[18:25] companionship, Lord, to be our comfort,
[18:28] Lord Jesus. May you do that for each
[18:30] one, each life here today, Lord Jesus.
[18:32] Lord, we want to we want to go on, Lord
[18:34] Jesus. We want to see us all there, Lord
[18:36] Jesus. As brother Ron said, we're not
[18:38] going to we're not going to be satisfied
[18:39] with just half of us going, Lord. We
[18:41] want every life to be there, Lord Jesus.
[18:44] Oh God, take out the things of this
[18:46] world, Lord, that are trying to snuff us
[18:48] out. Oh God, take the drugs, Lord Jesus.
[18:51] Take the alcohol, oh God. Take those
[18:54] demons of the Satan that are holding us
[18:56] back, Lord Jesus. Take them under your
[18:59] subjection, oh God. every spirit here
[19:01] today, Lord. May you move, Lord Jesus,
[19:04] like you never had before, Lord. We've
[19:06] seen you do it in lives. You've
[19:08] transformed the lives, Lord. It may have
[19:10] seemed impossible, Lord, but nothing's
[19:13] impossible with you, Lord Jesus. We
[19:15] thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for
[19:17] Brother Jason, Lord. He was delivered by
[19:19] cigarettes, Lord, from smoking, Lord,
[19:21] and now he has another need, Lord. Just
[19:23] meet that need, Lord. Meet that desire,
[19:25] oh God. Meet Brother John, wherever he
[19:28] is, Lord Jesus. whatever his mental
[19:30] condition is, oh God, you know, Lord
[19:33] Jesus, and you knew, Lord, that he would
[19:35] be in his condition, Lord. And for your
[19:37] glory, Lord, we ask that you would heal
[19:39] him, Lord, in your name if it be your
[19:41] will, Lord Jesus. Oh God, come, Lord,
[19:43] this morning, Lord Jesus.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're a needy people, God. We need
[19:48] you like never before in this age,
[19:50] Jesus.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't want to ever come cold,
[19:53] Lord Jesus. Lord, just become a social
[19:56] gospel, Lord. We need you, Lord Jesus.
[20:00] And Lord, we're calling on you, oh God,
[20:02] the one that you know all things. You
[20:05] knew from the beginning to the end where
[20:07] we all are, Lord Jesus. And we're going
[20:09] through everything for a reason, oh God.
[20:12] May we never look at the circumstances,
[20:14] Lord. But Lord, we look to you. We lift
[20:16] our heads to you. For our strength
[20:18] cometh from you, Lord Jesus. So come
[20:20] behind the word, Lord. Reveal yourself.
[20:23] Prove yourself worthy, oh God. meet the
[20:27] desires of the people that lives would
[20:29] be changed and would be healed for your
[20:32] glory. Lord, thank you, Lord, for what
[20:34] you've done for Sister Elaine. Oh God,
[20:36] Lord, you can do it for each one of us,
[20:38] Lord. If we just confess it, believe it,
[20:41] Lord. You will do the work, Lord. We
[20:43] believe, Lord Jesus, and we receive it,
[20:46] and we accept it in your name. We're
[20:48] standing on thus sayeth the Lord, and
[20:50] your promises, and they shall never
[20:52] fail. Thank you, Jesus, for that calm
[20:54] assurance. we have just plus the
[20:56] remainder of the song service and the
[20:58] minister Lord may it be you Lord may we
[21:00] see you Lord Jesus you're speaking to us
[21:03] dealing with us and may we not become
[21:05] hard to that Lord may we be soft Lord
[21:08] Jesus clay in your hands that you can
[21:10] mold us make us and cut those things off
[21:13] that we don't have need of oh God that
[21:15] are holding us back from our victories
[21:16] in you Lord Jesus grant it Lord Jesus
[21:19] and may every life be changed in for
[21:22] your glory and your honor Lord in Jesus
[21:24] Christ's name. Amen.
[21:40] God bless you. You may be seated.
[21:44] Uh well, I've just prayed that the that
[21:46] the Holy Spirit will let a a cool breeze
[21:48] flow through here.
[21:53] &gt;&gt; And uh if you feel feel a little extra
[21:55] warm, well, just remember there's people
[21:57] in this world that are in a whole lot
[22:00] warmer conditions than we are. our
[22:03] brother Ron and Sister Connie Spencer
[22:05] and uh sister Whitney and her friend I
[22:08] guess they've come from where it's 100
[22:11] plus. Brother Eddie Hurley, God bless
[22:13] him for coming from Kentucky and it's a
[22:16] 100 plus down there and humidity.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; Let's say praise the Lord.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; He's the right one to praise.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; It could be a lot warmer. So we're
[22:28] thankful for that. I want to just give
[22:32] some recognition before the service
[22:34] continues
[22:36] uh to everyone who has uh put such an
[22:40] effort forward for these meetings and
[22:44] for the camp and I trust I will not miss
[22:48] anyone but we have to kind of generalize
[22:51] everyone as far as I'm concerned has put
[22:54] forward a 110% if not more uh in this
[22:58] camp everyone and uh brother brother Ron
[23:03] I'm including the wives in these cases
[23:05] brother Ron his wife Sister Connie
[23:07] brother Ron I'm sure that everyone who
[23:10] even streamed the service last night and
[23:12] we've heard from those that have been
[23:13] streaming the meetings and they are so
[23:16] so blessed uh and we are blessed are we
[23:19] not
[23:20] &gt;&gt; brother Ron put out a th000% last night
[23:23] I mean he hardly knew where he was when
[23:25] he was done ministering and you know
[23:28] that's what the anointing does to a
[23:29] person uh is just it's such a force and
[23:33] it's a heavenly force. It's a divine
[23:36] force. It's the Holy Spirit
[23:38] &gt;&gt; and and a person just yields themselves.
[23:40] Brother Ron, we are so thankful. Uh and
[23:43] he will soon be coming. Uh brother Tom
[23:45] and Sister Joanne Ray in preparing for
[23:49] the camp. Brother John and Sister Sharon
[23:52] Andes and Sister uh Sarah Ashdown. I can
[23:56] tell you that these people have worked
[23:57] for weeks and weeks in arranging where
[24:00] you're going to sleep, where you're
[24:02] going to stay. And the camp was 100%
[24:06] maxed out. One brother came in
[24:08] unexpectedly and he needed a bed to
[24:11] sleep in. And uh we had we had a few
[24:14] people get a little sick for 24 hours
[24:17] and I think it was brother Ricardo, he
[24:21] wasn't feeling that well. He was laying
[24:22] on the lawn over here and he went home.
[24:25] So, we gave this brother his bed. It was
[24:27] the only bed there was. So, the camp was
[24:30] just 100% maxed out. We're thankful for
[24:33] those that have labored so much. Uh,
[24:36] Brother Derek and Sister Debbie Paris
[24:38] and their family, even their even their
[24:41] eldest daughter works. And I want to
[24:43] thank brother Derek and sister Debbie.
[24:45] You can hold your applause until we're
[24:47] done. Uh, and they and they have a staff
[24:50] here at the camp. You don't hardly maybe
[24:53] recognize what they're doing. Brother
[24:55] Paul Holford out here watering just uh
[24:59] the roadway so we you have less dust. I
[25:03] appreciate that.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Matt Beanis and Sister Angela
[25:07] Brooks answering the phone. I was I was
[25:09] in there doing some work and I could
[25:11] hardly keep my concentration. The phones
[25:14] are ringing. The radio's from someplace
[25:16] calling. Where's Brother Derek and
[25:18] where's this person? Where's that
[25:20] person? uh and sister Karen and brother
[25:25] Gil Ashdown. Sister Karen has put an
[25:28] incredible amount of labor into making
[25:32] the uh arranging for the food. But
[25:35] brother Raymond and Sister Raisesa
[25:38] Young, Brother Raymond has actually I
[25:41] think he's taken charge of ordering the
[25:43] food and so that we would have Hasn't
[25:45] the meals been wonderful? Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't doesn't even feel like a camp
[25:50] from the meals. Who ever saw cinnamon
[25:52] buns the size you did this morning? I
[25:55] said, "Cut that thing in half and I
[25:57] could barely eat half." How many ate a
[25:59] whole one?
[26:01] Oh my goodness. Almost all boys.
[26:06] The entire kitchen staff.
[26:09] The entire kitchen staff, sisters.
[26:11] They've been working 12 and 15 hours a
[26:13] day. I say God bless the kitchen staff
[26:16] and all of you that labored for them.
[26:18] Amen. God bless them.
[26:24] And the other support staff at the
[26:27] that's worked around the camp. I don't
[26:28] even know them all, but they've cleaned
[26:30] rooms and they've tidied up things and
[26:33] sometimes had to do things and uh that
[26:35] weren't all that pleasant. Some got sick
[26:37] in the rooms and they they don't just
[26:40] clean it up. I mean they completely uh
[26:43] sterilize the place. So when the next
[26:46] person comes in, God bless them. Brother
[26:48] Tom Frey and Sister Kim, they have
[26:51] worked tirelessly. Brother Tom arranged
[26:53] that the that this tent is up and uh
[26:56] you're fanning yourself now and it's
[26:58] warm in here. But let me tell you, you'd
[27:00] appreciate it if it was raining.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; At least most of you are except where
[27:05] the holes are and some rain might come
[27:08] through. So, God bless Brother Tom. When
[27:11] you're done and you walk away from here,
[27:13] his work's just starting again. And I
[27:15] saw him up there getting trailers. We
[27:17] appreciate Brother Tom and Sister Kim
[27:19] that have uh that have really labored.
[27:22] Um, Brother Ryan, who's led song
[27:26] service, and his wife, Sister Yolena.
[27:28] You know, the reason why we include the
[27:30] women is when the men are away and when
[27:32] they're doing something or the women are
[27:34] busy doing something, the husbands have
[27:36] to be there or the women and the wives
[27:38] have to be there. So, we appreciate,
[27:40] brother Ryan, the time you've spent and
[27:43] uh and preparing prayerfully for these
[27:45] services, the sound and the video staff.
[27:48] And I can tell you brothers that the
[27:51] people that are streaming even right now
[27:52] in Sunday evening in Switzerland and in
[27:55] Europe and different parts of the world,
[27:58] they appreciate that. And I God bless
[28:00] you each one. Brother Darren, brother
[28:02] Aaron, all of you, brother Isaac, and uh
[28:06] my brother Nathaniel, brother uh Jules,
[28:10] we appreciate that. Brother Michael and
[28:12] Abigail Ray, they worked uh at arranging
[28:17] the things and the activities in the
[28:19] daytime. And brother Marco and and
[28:21] sister Sharon Vanenter. Uh and there's
[28:24] many that were missing. I'm I know
[28:26] because there's been so many that have
[28:27] worked. Uh uh uh sister
[28:32] the counselors,
[28:35] God bless the counselors. I thought that
[28:38] all all you young people would say,
[28:40] "Amen." And God bless our counselors.
[28:44] God bless you counselors and the time
[28:46] that you spent in the hours after a
[28:49] service. And and uh
[28:52] last but certainly not least, all of you
[28:54] that have attended, if you hadn't come,
[28:57] there wouldn't be a camp.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to turn around, shake hands
[29:01] with somebody
[29:03] &gt;&gt; and say, "Thank you for being here. God
[29:05] bless you." Some of you don't look very
[29:07] happy while you're shaking hands. I I
[29:09] hope you're all happy that everyone
[29:11] come.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Did we leave anybody out? I don't think
[29:25] so. Those you that traveled and come
[29:27] from so far, some from Montana, some
[29:29] from Idaho, some from Phoenix, some from
[29:33] Chicago,
[29:34] uh our brother Miracle and his wife, God
[29:37] bless you. and they have to leave right
[29:39] after the service. And uh uh how many
[29:42] would like to see uh another time next
[29:44] year?
[29:53] &gt;&gt; The only thing that's better than this
[29:55] is the rapture.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; And we're all in agreement about that.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; And if we don't meet here in the dining
[30:02] room, we'll meet at another dining
[30:04] table. Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; How many have a reser reservation there?
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you, brother Ryan.
[30:14] Sing us happy.
[30:17] God bless you.
[30:26] What we do is get all the preliminaries
[30:28] out of the way. If we could have the
[30:29] deacons come forward, then we'll just
[30:31] Brother Ryan will lead us in a song and
[30:33] we'll uh take up the offerings and the
[30:36] tithes. Also, let's remember our sister
[30:40] Barb Drake and uh her daddy passed away
[30:43] yesterday morning. I know that most of
[30:45] you know it, but uh the Bible says that
[30:48] we we uh rejoice with those that rejoice
[30:52] and we sorrow with those that sorrow.
[30:55] And even though you can be as prepared
[30:58] as you wish to be prepared when that
[31:00] finally final moment of departure comes,
[31:03] there is a sting with death.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; And you can't avoid the sting. But the
[31:08] the apostle Paul says we don't sorrow as
[31:11] others who have no hope. Hallelujah. I'm
[31:15] so glad we have a hope beyond this
[31:17] grave. And so let's remember our sister
[31:19] Barb uh and and and the family, the
[31:23] brother John Gray, and he's traveling
[31:26] with his whole family. Uh also the other
[31:29] sisters are down there. There's three
[31:31] other sisters that I know of and they're
[31:33] down there with them now at this time.
[31:35] So I wonder if the deacons could come
[31:37] forward, please, and we'll just uh have
[31:39] a word of prayer
[31:41] and you give of your offering and
[31:44] tithes, please. We'll appreciate that.
[31:47] And if you're not prepared with your
[31:48] tithes now, you can give it at the
[31:50] church when you get back.
[31:53] Heavenly Father,
[31:55] we're so thankful. We don't know how to
[31:58] thank you. We haven't got the words. We
[32:00] don't have enough time today, but we
[32:02] will spend the rest of our life thanking
[32:05] you and praising you and giving glory to
[32:07] the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you for
[32:09] all of our beloved friends and members
[32:12] of the body of Jesus Christ. We pray
[32:15] that you'll bless them wherever they're
[32:17] meeting today around the earth and those
[32:19] ministers that minister and the gifts
[32:22] that are being given now, Lord, and the
[32:24] tithes that are being given in support
[32:26] of the ministry and in support of these
[32:28] kind of meetings. I pray, Father, that
[32:30] you will bless the giving of the people
[32:33] and multiply it to meet every need.
[32:35] Lord, you always have and we know that
[32:38] you will continue to do so. We give you
[32:40] praise. Bless the deacons, Lord, who
[32:43] have served so faithfully. They have not
[32:45] mentioned them, but they've been here
[32:46] every night. I pray that you'll bless
[32:49] them in their office. Oh God, bless
[32:51] their wives and their families and in
[32:52] their homes. I pray in Jesus Christ's
[32:55] name. And we thank you for it. Amen.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[33:02] We don't want to miss this opportunity.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If anyone needs it, there also is
[33:12] a tithe and offering box set up out next
[33:14] to the pond if you're not prepared at
[33:16] this moment but wanted to give this
[33:17] morning. Our sister Hedi Kasani is going
[33:20] to come and bless us with a special. Why
[33:21] don't we sing blessed be the Lord God
[33:23] Almighty as she comes. We'll start with
[33:25] the verse father in heaven.
[33:29] Oh father
[33:31] in heaven
[33:33] we love you.
[33:37] Oh, and we lift your name in all
[33:42] the earth.
[33:46] And may your kingdom be established in
[33:51] our praises
[33:55] as your people
[33:58] declare your mighty works.
[34:02] Blessed be the Lord
[34:06] God
[34:08] Almighty.
[34:12] Oh, who was and is and is true to God.

[34:58] Almighty.
[35:02] Oh, who lives forever?
[35:23] Oh Lord,

[35:27] me.
[35:30] You know my ways.
[35:38] Even when
[35:40] I fail
[35:42] you,
[35:45] I know you love me.
[35:53] Your holy
[35:55] presence
[36:01] surrounding
[36:03] me.
[36:08] In every
[36:10] season
[36:14] I know you love me.
[36:22] I know you love me.
[36:30] At the cross, I bound my knee. Where
[36:34] your blood was shed for me. There's no
[36:39] greater love than this.
[36:45] You have overcome the grave. Your glory
[36:49] fills the highest place. What can
[36:53] separate me now?
[37:07] You go before
[37:10] me.
[37:14] You shield my way
[37:20] and your hand
[37:23] uphold
[37:25] me.
[37:27] I know you love me.
[37:35] At the cross I bow my knee. Where your
[37:40] blood was shed for me. There's no
[37:43] greater love than this.
[37:49] You have overcome the grave. Your glory
[37:54] fills the highest place. What can
[37:57] separate me now? You tore the man.
[38:04] You made away
[38:08] when you said that it is.
[38:15] You
[38:19] made the way.
[38:23] You said that he be.
[38:32] Oh Lord, you search
[38:36] me.
[38:39] Know my ways.
[38:46] Even when I fail
[38:50] you,
[38:52] I know you love me.
[39:00] At the cross I found my king. Where your
[39:05] blood was shed for me. There's no
[39:08] greater love than this.
[39:15] You have overcome the grave. Your glory
[39:19] fills the highest place. What can
[39:23] separate me now? You tore the man.
[39:30] You made
[39:34] you.
[39:40] You are the best.
[39:44] You made a way.
[39:48] You said
[39:50] that it is enough.
[39:56] And when the earth
[40:00] fells
[40:04] from my eyes
[40:10] and you stand before
[40:14] me.
[40:17] I know you love me.
[40:23] Oh, I know you love me.
[40:30] I know you love me.
[40:50] Amen. Thank you, Sister Haddie. Did you
[40:53] write that, Elena? No. Okay.
[40:56] Wonderful. Very nice. Our sister Katie
[41:00] Miller is going to come and bless us
[41:01] with a special just as she does. Why
[41:02] don't we sing uh thank you Jesus for the
[41:05] things that you have done for us.
[41:10] Oh, thank
[41:12] you
[41:14] Jesus
[41:19] for the things that you have done for
[41:24] us.
[41:27] Oh, I can't repay the love that you have
[41:31] given me. I thank you.
[41:40] Oh, thank you
[41:44] my Jesus
[41:49] for the things that you have done for
[41:54] us.
[41:57] Oh, I can't forget the love that you
[42:01] have given me. I thank you. Sing it
[42:07] again.
[42:09] Oh, I thank
[42:13] you, Lord Jesus,
[42:19] for the things that you have done for
[42:24] us.
[42:27] Oh, I can't
[42:30] you have given me up.
[43:18] Oh Lord, for so long
[43:22] I've been holding on,
[43:26] only giving you part of me freely.
[43:34] It's hard letting go,
[43:37] but deep down I know
[43:41] it's time to give my life completely.
[43:48] I surrender
[43:52] all that I am. I surrender
[43:59] my life in your hands.
[44:02] I come before your throne.
[44:06] Make me your own. I won't hold back
[44:11] anymore.
[44:15] Lord, I surrender.
[44:23] What have I lost?
[44:27] There is no cost
[44:30] when I give like I have before.
[44:38] What I must do
[44:40] is give my whole heart to you.
[44:45] So here it is, Lord. I'm yours.
[44:53] I'm yours. I surrender.
[44:59] All that I am. I surrender.
[45:05] My life in your hands.
[45:09] I come before your throne.
[45:13] Make me your own. I won't hold back
[45:17] anymore.
[45:21] Lord, I surrender.
[45:26] All that I am, I surrender.
[45:32] My life in your hands.
[45:36] I come before your throne.
[45:40] Make me your own. I won't hold back
[45:44] anymore. Oh
[45:48] Lord, I surrender.
[46:01] I surrender.
[46:19] Thank you, Sister Katie. Just as we
[46:21] prepare to turn to the word now,
[46:25] we didn't get a chance to have a choir
[46:26] song this camp. We had a busy schedule
[46:29] and didn't allow for it. But there's a
[46:32] song the choir knows. It's called
[46:35] Towards the M Mark. I want to give my
[46:37] life as a living sacrifice.
[46:40] If I do, it's uh
[46:43] I had the number written down.
[46:46] Number 1049.
[46:49] So, if you're a young person, what's
[46:51] wrong with
[46:54] your young person would like to come up
[46:56] and sing, please do. If you don't
[46:58] remember it very well, that's okay.
[47:00] You'll learn it after a time or two. So,
[47:01] why don't we have those who would like
[47:03] to come and sing it. I want to give my
[47:04] life as a testimony and a confession
[47:06] after this camp. We're not just coming
[47:08] up to sing. Those who want to make a
[47:09] declaration. I want to give my life as a
[47:11] living sacrifice. We're just going to
[47:13] sing the chorus, come on up. We've got
[47:16] room.
[47:18] And those of you who don't come up can
[47:20] sing it from the audience. I believe
[47:21] we're going to get some microphones set
[47:23] up here.
[47:30] Amen.
[47:36] Wonderful.
[47:39] Now, some of you might not be coming up
[47:40] because you feel you don't know it, but
[47:42] that's okay. If you want to come sing
[47:43] with us, come on up. I guarantee you'll
[47:45] learn it after a time or two.
[48:00] Heat. Heat.
[48:35] God bless brother Isaac.
[48:41] Let's sing the chorus.
[48:44] Oh, and I want to give my life
[48:49] as a living sacrifice.
[48:52] I'm going to run this race with all of
[48:57] my mind. Forsaking what's behind. Oh,
[49:01] forsaking what's behind. Laying hold,
[49:04] laying hold of what is mine.
[49:08] I'm going to press on the mark of Jesus
[49:13] Christ.
[49:31] I forsak
[49:59] my Heat.
[50:02] Heat.
[50:12] Heat.

[52:19] That's your confession this morning. I
[52:22] want to live my life as a living
[52:24] sacrifice.
[52:26] Hallelujah.
[52:27] Why don't we declare as I pledge
[52:29] allegiance to the lamb just as our
[52:30] brother Ron Spencer would come. The
[52:32] choir if you want to lift your voices
[52:33] once more. With all my strength, with
[52:34] all I am. Amen. Oh my

[55:37] Wow.
[55:40] Hallelujah.
[55:42] Don't you love the Lord with all your
[55:44] heart?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; With all your soul?
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; With all your might,
[55:50] &gt;&gt; with everything that is within you.
[55:52] Amen.
[55:54] Hallelujah.
[55:57] Have you enjoyed the meeting?
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Just to be here on these grounds is just
[56:03] just supernatural.
[56:05] And we just we certainly for my part
[56:10] I've I've thoroughly enjoyed this
[56:12] meeting probably above many others. And
[56:14] so we're just so thrilled. And wherever
[56:18] he is that's where we want to be at.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather be where he is five
[56:24] minutes.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Than to be where he was all my life.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:33] I'd like to thank brother Ed for
[56:35] inviting me and putting up with me
[56:40] and and brother Tom and brother John and
[56:42] all the other helpers here. You've
[56:44] treated you've treated me like royalty.
[56:48] My wife, my family, uh sister Whitney
[56:51] with us and Sister Autumn as well. We'd
[56:54] like to thank you from the bottom of our
[56:56] hearts and
[56:58] like to thank thank you for just just in
[57:02] just coming and pulling on the word and
[57:04] and I pray that you've you've been
[57:06] touched by the spirit of the Lord.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; My mother and father, brother Charlie
[57:12] and sister Christine would like to pass
[57:14] on their hells. and my father-in-law and
[57:16] mother-in-law, Brother Homer and Sister
[57:18] Nancy, and our church. And well, I could
[57:20] spend the rest of the day saying hello.
[57:24] But way yonder in the Shannondoa Valley,
[57:27] there's an outpost down there.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; We're not fighting the Civil War no
[57:31] more.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; But we're fighting this Leotan battle.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And uh remember us in prayer. We've got
[57:38] a meeting that's just in a couple of
[57:40] weeks as well. And remember that meeting
[57:42] that God would just be with us there.
[57:44] We've got a couple people with cancer.
[57:46] Sister Natalie Jce that has cancer and
[57:49] the doctors has said she has somewhere
[57:51] between a 5% and 20% chance of survival.
[57:54] But we have a high priest.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; My own brother-in-law, brother Harold
[57:59] Shifflet has cancer and third stage. And
[58:03] we ask the Lord that you would just you
[58:06] remember him when you're talking to the
[58:08] Lord. and
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Sister Stephanie that's been in the
[58:10] hospital for almost 3 months now and
[58:13] carrying twins and total bed rest. We
[58:16] ask you that you'd pray for them.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Pray that God gives us all strength to
[58:21] to to to make it and and uh gives us
[58:24] strength to survive even this morning.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I just ask you that you'd min you'd just
[58:33] pray for us today.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:38] pray for my vocal cords.
[58:40] And after all, we just need to thank the
[58:42] Lord that we're able to preach. Period.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; When the doctor said we'd never be able
[58:48] to do it again, here we are.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; If you never see another miracle, you've
[58:53] seen one.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] Amen. And if you will turn with me to 1
[59:04] Thessalonians chapter 4,
[59:11] I would like to speak this morning on
[59:13] pressing the mark.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I want to read to you a poem that was
[59:22] very very quoted very much by brother
[59:25] Brandham and then the Lord gives him a
[59:27] poem as well just before just before we
[59:30] go to the word.
[59:32] Brother Brandham quotes this over and
[59:34] over and over again.
[59:37] Must I be carried home to heaven on a
[59:39] flowery bed of bees
[59:41] while others fought to win the prize and
[59:45] sail through bloody seas?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; No, I must fight if I must reign.
[59:51] Increase my courage, Lord.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Help me
[59:55] &gt;&gt; and support me by thy everlasting word.
[1:00:00] This was given to brother Brandham in
[1:00:02] prophecy, tongues and and then prophecy.
[1:00:06] Because thou hast chosen the narrow
[1:00:08] path, the harder way that hast walked of
[1:00:12] thine own choosing,
[1:00:14] thou hast picked the correct and precise
[1:00:17] decision, and it is my way. And because
[1:00:21] of this momentous decision, a huge
[1:00:24] portion of heaven awaits thee. What a
[1:00:28] glorious decision thou has made.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; What a glorious decision thou has made.
[1:00:35] This in itself is that which will give
[1:00:38] and make to come to pass the tremendous
[1:00:41] victory in the love divine.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 4
[1:00:48] and I'll start at verse 15.
[1:00:56] For this we say unto you by the word of
[1:00:58] the Lord, that we
[1:01:00] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:01:03] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:01:06] them which are asleep.
[1:01:09] For the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:01:12] heaven with a shout, and with the voice
[1:01:14] of the archangel, with a trump of God,
[1:01:18] and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
[1:01:21] Paul writing this almost 2,000 years ago
[1:01:26] by the breath of God, by the anointing
[1:01:29] of God, writing about me and you.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:01:37] be caught up together with him in the
[1:01:39] clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And
[1:01:42] that's what believers believe. And so
[1:01:45] shall we ever be with the Lord.
[1:01:47] Wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:01:49] words. Chapter 5 verse one. But of the
[1:01:52] times and the seasons, brethren, you
[1:01:54] have no need that that you have no need
[1:01:57] that I write unto you. For yourselves
[1:02:00] know perfectly that the day of the Lord
[1:02:03] so cometh as a thief in the night. And
[1:02:05] when they shall say peace and safety,
[1:02:07] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:02:10] as travail upon a woman with child, and
[1:02:14] they shall not escape. But ye, brethren,
[1:02:17] are not in darkness, that that day
[1:02:20] should overtake you as a thief. Ye are
[1:02:23] all the children of light, and the
[1:02:25] children of day. We're not of the night,
[1:02:27] nor of the darkness. Therefore, let us
[1:02:29] not sleep as do others. But let us watch
[1:02:32] and be sober. For they that sleep in the
[1:02:35] night, and they that are drunken are
[1:02:37] drunken in the night. But let us who are
[1:02:40] of the day be sober, putting on the
[1:02:42] breastplate of faith and of love, and
[1:02:45] for a helmet and a hope of salvation.
[1:02:47] For God hath not appointed us to wrath,
[1:02:50] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[1:02:53] Jesus Christ.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; we thank you now as we have just now
[1:03:01] come to the last last service of this
[1:03:03] meeting.
[1:03:05] We're very much aware that father that
[1:03:08] we this could be the last time ever
[1:03:13] lord in this type of a setting. Our next
[1:03:17] meeting may be with you.
[1:03:22] We believe we're just at that time.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I ask you that you would
[1:03:28] anoint these lips of clay one more time.
[1:03:31] Lord, you see the weariness of my own
[1:03:33] flesh and the the tiredness of my own
[1:03:36] vocal cords.
[1:03:38] But Lord,
[1:03:42] this message is a passion to me.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; It's more than houses, homes,
[1:03:48] businesses,
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; all the money in the world.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; All the popularity that man could give.
[1:03:58] Lord, I ask you that you would just come
[1:04:00] and by divine energy, give us strength
[1:04:03] this morning.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Both as hearers and as speaker,
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, drive back every enemy from away
[1:04:11] from us.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; We're aware that thousands of angels
[1:04:15] have gathered to watch your children
[1:04:17] worship.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may you energize us this
[1:04:20] morning like never before.
[1:04:23] No doubt as we've give all of our
[1:04:25] energies in this camp and we've enjoyed
[1:04:28] our time of play and our time of
[1:04:30] worship. But Lord, may you come
[1:04:33] personally to us today.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I pray that you would ignite
[1:04:38] us like never before.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:04:42] pray, touch our hearts, meet every need
[1:04:46] in your name. May we be a witness, a
[1:04:49] torch, Lord,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; in this day in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:04:53] Amen. And amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You may be seated this afternoon.
[1:04:59] Here we go.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:09] You know, there's just sometimes you
[1:05:10] just feel like just busting.
[1:05:15] This is one of those times for me.
[1:05:22] Brother Brandham makes a quotation
[1:05:24] that I want to just share with you this
[1:05:26] morning.
[1:05:31] Taking sides with Jesus. And I want to
[1:05:33] draw some thoughts from here this
[1:05:35] morning.
[1:05:37] What if God would have told John the
[1:05:39] Revelator?
[1:05:41] Now, it's going to be 2,000 years before
[1:05:43] my coming.
[1:05:46] John would have come back and told the
[1:05:47] church. Well, I guess we may as well
[1:05:50] eat, drink, be merry, cuz there's going
[1:05:55] to be many generations.
[1:05:58] Jesus ain't coming for 2,000 years.
[1:06:01] See, the church would have been loose.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; There would have been no on the mark.
[1:06:09] There have been no waiting. After all,
[1:06:12] it's your anticipations.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; If you fall asleep in that watch
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; that you wake with them the same
[1:06:23] anticipations
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; cuz it ain't going to hinder
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; one thing. You're going to be right
[1:06:31] there on time anyhow.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; See? See what I mean? Notice the
[1:06:37] statement. When St. Martin awaits in the
[1:06:40] resurrection,
[1:06:42] St. Paul and the rest of them, can I add
[1:06:46] just a moment, brother Pam?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; It'll be just as fresh as if they went
[1:06:52] right in the battle, battling right away
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; cuz they went right down under those
[1:06:59] same anticipations looking for his
[1:07:01] coming.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And there will be a scream come. Oh,
[1:07:05] hallelujah. And up will come the whole
[1:07:08] church.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 1.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; And I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:07:24] day, and heard behind me a great voice
[1:07:26] as a as of a trumpet, saying, I'm Alpha
[1:07:30] and Omega, the first and the last. What
[1:07:32] thou seeest write in a book and send it
[1:07:34] in the seven churches which are in Asia
[1:07:36] and Ephesians and right on down.
[1:07:43] In verse 17, and when I saw him, I fell
[1:07:45] at his feet as dead. And he laid his
[1:07:48] right hand upon me, saying unto me,
[1:07:52] Fear not. I am the first and the last.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; I am he. I am he. Hallelujah. That was
[1:08:01] dead.
[1:08:02] And behold, I am alive forever more.
[1:08:05] Amen. And have the keys of hell and of
[1:08:08] death. Write the things which thou hast
[1:08:11] seen, and the things which are, and the
[1:08:14] things which shall be hereafter. The
[1:08:16] mystery of the seven stars, which thou
[1:08:18] sawest in the right hand, and the seven
[1:08:20] golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
[1:08:24] the angels of the seven churches. And in
[1:08:27] this day, we don't have to guess who
[1:08:29] they were.
[1:08:34] God has took the guesswork out of it.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; We're not having to write a book about
[1:08:39] theories.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; We're not standing guessing. Well, maybe
[1:08:42] we'll compare this ministry with this
[1:08:44] ministry and this ministry with this
[1:08:47] ministry. But we know that first star
[1:08:50] was Paul.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; We know that he ran the race
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; with everything that was within him.
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; He could write the book of Ephesians
[1:09:01] with guards standing around him and
[1:09:03] chains on him, hooked to a soldier, but
[1:09:07] that didn't deter his energy. It did not
[1:09:10] deter his his vision.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he wrote the letters,
[1:09:17] Brother Tim, and he would hand them out
[1:09:19] knowing there were men that were going
[1:09:22] to be ignited by the word.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And they would carry this with all of
[1:09:26] their heart.
[1:09:31] this weekend study. I just I just I just
[1:09:36] had a special time.
[1:09:39] I can just see Paul as he begins to come
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; sees how everything is laying
[1:09:46] and God allows him now to write about
[1:09:49] the rapture of the church.
[1:10:01] as he begins to he begins to take the
[1:10:05] whatever type of material he's going to
[1:10:07] use for paper and whatever pen they
[1:10:09] would use.
[1:10:12] He begin to write it down.
[1:10:16] This is now God's covenant
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; with his wife.
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; And no matter how dark your battle gets,
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; no matter how hard your way gets,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I'm making you a covenant.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; I'm making you a covenant.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; If you have to go in the grave,
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; go there with every bit of energy.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; There's no time to lighten up. There's
[1:10:52] no time to quit.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Go to your grave with every bit of
[1:10:57] energy.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Give it all
[1:11:01] s
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; cuz he goes back to the scripture where
[1:11:08] Jesus turned to his disciples, let not
[1:11:10] your heart be troubled.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; You believe in God, believe also in me.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; In my father's house are many mansions.
[1:11:18] If it were not so, I would have told
[1:11:20] you. I go to prepare a place for you
[1:11:24] that where I am, there you
[1:11:28] are.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; There you
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; as
[1:11:37] as the bride
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; when brother Brandham came to the
[1:11:43] pullpit,
[1:11:46] this was not for denomination. Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you about your future
[1:11:51] home.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; I want to talk to you about your future
[1:11:56] home. It wasn't going to be a 30inut
[1:11:58] message.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; 4 hours he would begin to spend with
[1:12:04] with the wife of heaven.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He slipped the wedding band
[1:12:10] of unmarited grace on you before the
[1:12:13] foundation of the world.
[1:12:15] He reminded you that you were elected in
[1:12:18] the mind of God.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You were predestinated.
[1:12:22] God bypassed a million and chose you.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, there may be some wars.
[1:12:31] Yes, there may be some terrible things,
[1:12:33] but God thought of you before the
[1:12:35] foundation of the world.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Talks about the behavior of the people
[1:12:43] in the motel. the behavior of the people
[1:12:45] in the in in the community, the behavior
[1:12:48] in the restaurants. I'd like to thank
[1:12:50] you for your behavior, he says. Why
[1:12:52] would he do that? Because he's he is
[1:12:54] preaching to a people that that can be
[1:12:56] citizens of the kingdom of God living
[1:12:59] right here
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; in total darkness.
[1:13:05] when he even couldn't see past 1977,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; when it was so dark and so wicked and so
[1:13:13] religious,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; God would have beacons of light in the
[1:13:18] midst of darkness.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; For when Paul was pinning it out, we
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz he had an expectation.
[1:13:34] Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't get to see him, but he wanted
[1:13:38] to see him.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; The ministers under Paul who had been
[1:13:42] ignited, pastors, teachers, evangelists,
[1:13:45] men of God that had got a hold of it
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; and preached it with, listen, they may
[1:13:52] not had the same ministry that Paul had
[1:13:54] because we're not to compare oursel with
[1:13:56] one another. All of us has got different
[1:13:58] ministries.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; But listen, whatever ministry that you
[1:14:03] have
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; If you're a minister to your little
[1:14:06] little children and home sisters,
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; give it every bit of energy you got.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; You're the janitor to the church, clean
[1:14:15] every part.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; No matter where you're at in the darkest
[1:14:22] of night, whether you're in a church
[1:14:24] with 10 people or 5,000 people, listen,
[1:14:28] give it every bit of energy that you've
[1:14:30] got.
[1:14:32] Yes.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; We and I can just think of all of the
[1:14:40] hundreds of thousands of men
[1:14:45] that walked to the pullpit
[1:14:47] took this text
[1:14:50] believing with all of their heart.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; We're that group. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Because God could not give them the
[1:14:58] revelation it's going to be 2,000 years.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; It's it cannot tarry. They cannot have
[1:15:06] the revelation it's going to be because
[1:15:08] you must give everything. God wants your
[1:15:11] whole might. He wants your whole heart.
[1:15:14] He wants your whole soul.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:26] Jesus was standing there.
[1:15:30] I want you to notice a statement that he
[1:15:32] uses.
[1:15:37] Sometimes I use the word I'm
[1:15:39] discombobulated, but here we are.
[1:15:46] Paul would write this words.
[1:15:50] And you hath he quickened, who were dead
[1:15:52] in trespasses and sins,
[1:15:55] wherein in times past
[1:15:58] you walked according to the course of
[1:15:59] this world, according to the prince of
[1:16:02] the power of the air, the spirit that
[1:16:04] now workketh in the children of
[1:16:06] disobedience,
[1:16:08] among whom we had our conversations in
[1:16:10] times past, in the lust of our flesh,
[1:16:14] fulfilling the desires of our flesh and
[1:16:16] the mind. were by nature the children of
[1:16:19] wrath even as others. But God who is
[1:16:22] rich in mercy
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewin with he
[1:16:28] loved us even when we were dead in
[1:16:31] trespass dead in sins hath quickened us
[1:16:34] together with Christ by grace are you
[1:16:37] saved notice this next statement and
[1:16:38] hath raised us up
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; and made us to sit together in heavenly
[1:16:43] places. And brother I said that's our
[1:16:45] position in Christ Jesus. We are his
[1:16:49] workmanship
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:16:56] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:17:00] should walk in them.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; He comes to Ephesians 6 and he said
[1:17:04] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:17:06] Lord and in the power of his might. Put
[1:17:08] on the whole armor of God that you may
[1:17:11] be able to stand against the ws of the
[1:17:12] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[1:17:15] and blood, and against principalities,
[1:17:17] against powers, against the rulers of
[1:17:20] the darkness of of this world, against
[1:17:22] spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:17:24] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:17:27] of God, that's your covenant.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; He said that you may be able to
[1:17:32] withstand in the evil day, and having
[1:17:34] done all to stand, stand. Stand
[1:17:36] therefore, having your your loins gird
[1:17:38] about with truth, having on the
[1:17:40] breastplate of righteousness, your feet
[1:17:42] shot with the preparation of the gospel
[1:17:44] of peace. He says, above all, taking the
[1:17:46] shield of faith, wherewith you may be
[1:17:48] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:17:50] the wicked and the helmet of salvation,
[1:17:52] with the sword of the spirit and the
[1:17:54] word of God, praying always with all
[1:17:56] prayer and supplication in the spirit,
[1:17:58] watching there unto all perseverance and
[1:18:01] supplication for all saints. Watch what
[1:18:03] brother says. He says, "And when God was
[1:18:06] going to equip his children,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; he said he gave them the best weapon
[1:18:12] that they could have,"
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; that was his word.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; We said it the other night. His word
[1:18:20] will defeat Satan anywhere,
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; any place,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; anytime.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'd like to hear one of those old
[1:18:41] guys testify. Let's just hear him for
[1:18:43] just a few minutes. Peter. Peter's going
[1:18:45] to preach.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And listen, he's going to preach with
[1:18:49] passion.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; He's going to preach with inspiration.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; He's seen the word open up to him.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:18:57] But Peter standing up with the 11 lifted
[1:18:59] up his voice and said unto them, "Ye men
[1:19:01] of Judea and all that dwell in
[1:19:03] Jerusalem, be it known unto you, and
[1:19:05] hearken unto my words, for these are not
[1:19:08] drunken as ye suppose, seeing, it is but
[1:19:11] the third hour of the day, but this is
[1:19:14] that which was spoken by the prophet
[1:19:16] Joel." He literally takes this word and
[1:19:19] it becomes a human vessel.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:25] It becomes humanity now.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; This is that.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; It was a prophecy, but now it's history.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; They preached about a bride coming, but
[1:19:38] it's history now. We're here.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, we're looking for that last
[1:19:47] revival. We're here.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:19:56] This is that which was spoken by the
[1:19:58] prophet Joel. And it shall come to pass
[1:20:01] in the last days, saith God, I will pour
[1:20:03] out my spirit on all flesh, and your
[1:20:06] sons and your daughters shall prophesy.
[1:20:09] Your young men shall see visions. Your
[1:20:12] old men shall dream dreams. My and my
[1:20:14] sermons, oh my handmaidaidens, I will
[1:20:18] pour out in in those days of my spirit,
[1:20:20] and they shall prophesy, and I will show
[1:20:22] wonders in the heaven above, signs in
[1:20:24] the earth beneath, blood, fire, vapor of
[1:20:27] smoke, and the sun shall be turned to
[1:20:29] darkness, and the moon into blood before
[1:20:32] that great and durable day of the Lord
[1:20:34] to come. And it shall come to pass.
[1:20:36] Whosoever shall call on the name of the
[1:20:38] Lord shall be saved.
[1:20:42] Let me just say, I'm sure Peter wasn't
[1:20:44] standing like some
[1:20:47] some dead preacher standing there
[1:20:48] whispering.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; It was with every bit of energy that was
[1:20:53] within him.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; He could care less if they were saying,
[1:20:57] "Isn't that that the guy that denied the
[1:21:00] Lord? Isn't that the guy that was
[1:21:02] cussing the other day? Isn't that the
[1:21:04] guy that became a coward?"
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "This is that.
[1:21:11] I heard a Jubilee sound.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; All the words that was in the book, I
[1:21:17] couldn't understand. It's open to me
[1:21:19] now.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He's my redeemer.
[1:21:25] He's
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; more than just our redeemer. He's our
[1:21:27] king. He's our husband.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; He's our bridegroom.
[1:21:41] Hallelujah.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; You men of Israel, hear these words.
[1:21:46] This is fresh. Jesus of Nazareth,
[1:21:52] a man approved of God among you by
[1:21:56] miracles and wonders and signs which God
[1:22:00] did by him in the midst of you.
[1:22:04] as yourselves also know him being
[1:22:08] delivered by determinate counsel and the
[1:22:11] knowledge of God ye have taken and by
[1:22:15] wicked hands have crucified and slain
[1:22:18] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[1:22:21] the pains of death because it was not
[1:22:24] possible that he should beholden of it
[1:22:26] for David speaking concerning him I
[1:22:28] forsaw the Lord always before my face
[1:22:31] and he is before on my right hand that I
[1:22:34] should not be moved. Therefore did my
[1:22:36] heart rejoice and my tongue was glad.
[1:22:38] Moreover, also my flesh and my it shall
[1:22:40] rest in hope because thou wilt not leave
[1:22:44] my soul in hell. Neither will thou
[1:22:46] suffer that holy one to seek corruption.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; There rumors somebody stole the body did
[1:22:53] not deter Peter.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; I have seen him.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I have seen him.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I have a vindication. He lives in my
[1:23:05] heart.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He was with me.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He was here. I seen the miracles.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; But the God that lived in him lives in
[1:23:18] me.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Thou has made known to me the ways of
[1:23:26] life.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt make me full of joy with my
[1:23:29] countenance. Men and brethren, let me
[1:23:32] freely speak unto you
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; of the patriarch David,
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; that he is both dead and buried, and his
[1:23:41] supplicers with us into this day.
[1:23:43] Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing
[1:23:45] that God has sworn an oath to him that
[1:23:48] are the fruit of his loins according to
[1:23:50] his flesh, he would raise up Christ to
[1:23:52] sit on his throne.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And he seeing this before he spake of
[1:23:58] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[1:24:01] was not left in hell, neither his flesh
[1:24:03] did see corruption. This Jesus,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; this is not a whatif gospel here.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; This Jesus,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; this Jesus,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; this isn't a theory or an ideology.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; This Jesus
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; have God raised up. There are we are all
[1:24:26] witnesses.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Who's so we all? Brother Bam said even
[1:24:30] Mary
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; even Mary who carried him nine months
[1:24:37] who was visited by the angel Gabriel and
[1:24:40] he stood in a small narrow passageway a
[1:24:44] man about six foot tall shoulder length
[1:24:46] hair down had a robe on and sandals on
[1:24:50] and he called her by name.
[1:24:53] and identified who she was and
[1:24:56] identified what God's plans was for her.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She watched the zodiac come
[1:25:02] into order. She watched the star. She
[1:25:05] saw the shepherds. She Sheard the angels
[1:25:08] sing the first Noel.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I know it's hot, but boy, this is good.
[1:25:21] She watched God supernaturally protect
[1:25:23] that baby.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; She She watched him.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Listen, she even left him alone to go
[1:25:32] and she left him like the church does at
[1:25:35] 12 years old. And she comes back and
[1:25:37] here's the brightest minds in the entire
[1:25:40] world sitting around and talking
[1:25:42] philosophy and astronomy and science.
[1:25:44] Right.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Men that could blow the minds
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; of just their deep thinking and they're
[1:25:53] astounded.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I'd like to spend a little time
[1:26:09] right there. They're astounded of what
[1:26:12] he knows about the nervous system and
[1:26:13] the artery system, how the complexes of
[1:26:16] life works.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; They're astounded about how the stars
[1:26:20] are laid out, how each star has to
[1:26:22] circle another star and the orbits have
[1:26:24] to be a certain way, how they're a
[1:26:26] certain degree, and the 24th and and all
[1:26:28] of this. And he begins to lay that out
[1:26:30] for him, why this this would mean this
[1:26:32] and this would would mean that. And the
[1:26:33] astronomers, the greatest men, sitting
[1:26:35] there going,
[1:26:43] And it's not only science,
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; it's not only physicians,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; but he takes the Old Testament.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because he's that one that
[1:27:03] has been prophesied of.
[1:27:08] This Jesus whom you did crucify,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; this one that stood among you,
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Mary watched it. She watched miracle
[1:27:17] after miracle after miracle after
[1:27:18] miracle after miracle.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; And yet he wouldn't even call her
[1:27:23] mother.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; He would rebuke her when she would make
[1:27:28] an error in her testimony.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, that didn't give her the new
[1:27:35] birth.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, in all of that, that didn't make
[1:27:40] her the new birth. It was a Catholic
[1:27:42] system that made her a god.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; But even in her mortal condition, she
[1:27:48] still needed to be born again.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; She still needed a jubilee sounding for
[1:27:53] herself.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; She still needed the life of God.
[1:28:06] I want you to just watch a qu questions
[1:28:08] and answers. Brother Ram details it.
[1:28:10] Apologize for its length. No, I don't.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; But the man says, "For the worshipper
[1:28:17] once purged has no more conscience of
[1:28:19] sins.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He has passed from death into life, and
[1:28:22] he's got eternal life inside of him
[1:28:25] dwelling there, and can no more die than
[1:28:27] God can die."
[1:28:30] If you ever get a revelation of that
[1:28:32] right there,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; if you ever get a revelation that you
[1:28:36] are as eternal as God is eternal,
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; they can burn this body.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; It can be whatever accident there is.
[1:28:44] There's an anchor that holds on to you.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; There's an anchor that holds on to you.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; He says, now watch this. He said, "And
[1:28:57] he's got eternal life and dwelling
[1:28:58] inside of him. He can no more die than
[1:28:59] God." Exactly. The Bible, he's eternally
[1:29:02] taken care of because he's got eternal
[1:29:04] life. He said, "That don't mean that you
[1:29:06] can sin and get by with it with your
[1:29:08] sin, you're punished for your sins. But
[1:29:10] as long as eternal life is in there, you
[1:29:12] live forever." Jesus said, "He that
[1:29:14] hearth my word and he that hearth my
[1:29:16] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:29:18] hath everlasting life and shall never
[1:29:20] come into judgment, but has passed from
[1:29:22] death unto life."
[1:29:24] No man can come except my father draw
[1:29:26] him first and all that comes I will at
[1:29:29] that day he says all that my father
[1:29:31] father's given will come to me and all
[1:29:33] that has given will come and none of
[1:29:35] them will be lost and I'll give him them
[1:29:37] life eternal and will raise him up at
[1:29:39] the last day
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; oh what a blessed assurance he says they
[1:29:44] then you don't have to be scared about
[1:29:45] death and wondering he said God has
[1:29:47] given us a perfect assurance that we are
[1:29:50] his children
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and as his children he corrects us just
[1:29:54] like I correct my children and you
[1:29:56] correct your children. When they're
[1:29:57] wrong, we correct them. If my children
[1:29:59] does wrong, then it's my duty as a
[1:30:01] father to correct them. If God's
[1:30:03] children does wrong, it's his duty as a
[1:30:04] father to correct you. Just remember,
[1:30:06] you will be corrected. But as long as
[1:30:08] you're his child,
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; as long as you're his child,
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; the world better keep their hands off of
[1:30:19] you. It's far better for you that a
[1:30:21] millstone was hanging around your neck
[1:30:23] and drowned in the depths of the sea
[1:30:25] than to bring one offense against one of
[1:30:27] the little ones.
[1:30:39] Brother Pat, back to your question. I
[1:30:42] like how he kind of gets off and then
[1:30:44] comes back.
[1:30:46] Brother Pat, back to your question. The
[1:30:48] spirits that went out of a man drove him
[1:30:50] like a maniac. Does the same thing in
[1:30:53] people today. It's them spirits.
[1:30:55] Thousands times thousands. The devil
[1:30:59] comes in just like a little opium. And
[1:31:01] he said they take a little school girl
[1:31:03] and the first thing they do is they get
[1:31:04] her to smoke a cigarette. That gets her
[1:31:07] started. The next thing they do, they'll
[1:31:09] they'll get a little stronger and then
[1:31:11] the first thing it ends up in is
[1:31:12] marijuana. Here's brother Brandham
[1:31:14] explaining the drug world.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Here he's explaining the drug world. He
[1:31:20] starts you out with just a little thing.
[1:31:22] And you say, "Well, it won't hurt me,
[1:31:23] Brother Ron. I can do this and get by
[1:31:25] with it. It has no end to it."
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; He says, "And the next thing to do, get
[1:31:35] a little strong and the first thing it
[1:31:36] ends up in marijuana." And then from
[1:31:37] that to a a real dope addict, what does
[1:31:39] it do? It drives them insane. They'll go
[1:31:41] crazy. The devil's got a hold of them.
[1:31:43] So the devil is in smoking cigarettes
[1:31:45] and that little old in a little mile for
[1:31:47] them. And if he sees you're pretty smart
[1:31:49] and goes to catching on, he'll never
[1:31:51] take you any further than just
[1:31:52] cigarettes. And as long as he can hold
[1:31:54] you there long enough, he can get your
[1:31:57] life snapped out.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knows that you can't go until God
[1:32:02] said so. But you'll hear a sermon after
[1:32:06] sermon, message after message, punch
[1:32:08] after punch on it, warning after
[1:32:11] warning. If he can keep you warted off
[1:32:14] and keep your mind on something else and
[1:32:17] as being a popular person or you've just
[1:32:19] got to have it, something like that,
[1:32:21] then he can hold on to you until he gets
[1:32:24] the gets you out.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Watch the statement.
[1:32:30] Or if he can get you to join a church,
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; he can get you to join a church
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; or come to a he says he says, "Oh, I'm
[1:32:41] going to be a good fellow. I'm going to
[1:32:43] turn a new page." He says, "I'm going up
[1:32:46] to the church and join the church."
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; If he could just keep you under that,
[1:32:52] that's all he has to do. He said he's
[1:32:55] got to get you. Because Jesus said,
[1:32:58] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except
[1:33:01] a man be born of water and of spirit, he
[1:33:04] will in no wise enter the kingdom."
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; It's very important here.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; He comes down. He talks about a farmer
[1:33:13] talking about putting corn in the
[1:33:14] ground, being perfect corn. He says,
[1:33:17] "Unless it has a germ of life in it,
[1:33:19] it'll just lay there and rot. It'll
[1:33:21] never raise up again." He says, "I don't
[1:33:24] mean to hurt your feelings. This is my
[1:33:26] church. This is my tabernacle. I'm free
[1:33:28] as a bird." I want you to remember that
[1:33:31] in this that a man can be good. He can
[1:33:34] pay his tithes. He can be honest. He can
[1:33:37] help the widows. He can help the
[1:33:39] orphans. He can be a church member. And
[1:33:42] you can't find one flaw about that man.
[1:33:45] Every time there's something to come up
[1:33:47] right down in his pocket, he'll get
[1:33:48] every last penny that he's got to give
[1:33:49] it to the poor. He'll stand with you
[1:33:51] through thick and thin. He'll be your
[1:33:53] buddy even when a lot of so so-called
[1:33:55] others turn out and will will turn you
[1:33:57] down and everything like that. Notice
[1:33:59] that statement. Every one of us as
[1:34:01] pastors want that kind of guy in our
[1:34:02] church.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; But notice that's not the important part
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; in all of that. He said that man is
[1:34:12] still outside of the kingdom of God
[1:34:14] unless he's been filled with the Holy
[1:34:17] Ghost.
[1:34:25] Unless he's been dramatized by the life
[1:34:29] of God.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; That's how important it is.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; I just want to spend a moment right
[1:34:40] here. Let me just say this to you,
[1:34:43] especially each and every one of you
[1:34:44] young people. If I can have your
[1:34:46] attention. I know it's hot.
[1:34:50] Satan will offer you everything that he
[1:34:52] can offer you to deter you.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Everything possible. Not just you guys,
[1:34:58] but you guys.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; He'll offer you jobs that'll take you
[1:35:03] away from church.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; He'll offer you education. And brother
[1:35:06] Baron said, he says, "Education only,"
[1:35:09] and we all got to have it, but education
[1:35:11] will only take you further away from
[1:35:13] God.
[1:35:16] Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; I've got a daughter-in-law.
[1:35:21] She has
[1:35:23] not just one, but she actually has two.
[1:35:26] She She wouldn't let you know that for
[1:35:28] all the money in the world, but I'm
[1:35:29] going to tell it on her. She has two
[1:35:32] master's degree and two complete
[1:35:35] different subjects.
[1:35:39] One day we we were we were together as a
[1:35:42] family and I looked at her and I just
[1:35:44] read what brother Brandham said about
[1:35:46] that. I said, "Sister Cassie,
[1:35:50] I have to ask you a question.
[1:35:53] Brother Brandham makes a statement
[1:35:56] that education will only take you
[1:35:58] further from God.
[1:36:01] You came through your schooling.
[1:36:06] I want to ask you, what do you make of
[1:36:08] that statement? And she paused a moment.
[1:36:12] And she said,"I tell you now, had I not
[1:36:16] had the Holy Ghost,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; had I not had the Holy Ghost,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; with all of their power of reasoning,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; they would have made me question the
[1:36:30] word.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost kept me.
[1:36:37] Hallelujah.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost kept me.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That's how important it is.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Because you can't have even a token
[1:36:57] without having the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot make the rapture without
[1:37:02] having the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:04] You can't live an overcoming life
[1:37:06] without having the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I prayed and
[1:37:12] I prayed and I prayed." You keep You
[1:37:15] keep praying as hard as you can. You
[1:37:17] stay urgent. You stay desperate before
[1:37:20] God.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; How will I know? You'll know.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; You'll know.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to compare evidence with
[1:37:28] evidence tonight. Listen, you probably
[1:37:30] won't get the experience I did or
[1:37:32] brother Tom did or brother John did or
[1:37:34] brother Ed did.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; But God will be individual to you.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's the kind of God that
[1:37:47] your experience is different than
[1:37:49] another's experience.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; And it'll be a love affair between you
[1:37:53] and him. And you'll know
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; when you feel like quitting, he's in
[1:37:58] there.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; When you don't feel like praising the
[1:38:03] Lord, he's in there.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; When you don't feel like making it
[1:38:07] another day, he's in there.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; It's like a little stream. Why do you
[1:38:12] bubble?
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you bubble? Because the
[1:38:15] deer come and drink from you. The
[1:38:17] animals come and I come and drink from
[1:38:19] you. Oh no, it's an artillerian well.
[1:38:22] It's bubbling from the inside out.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I can't get rid of these
[1:38:36] habits. Just keep giving them to God.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Just keep giving them to God. Just keep
[1:38:41] giving them to God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, I can't say enough. Just keep
[1:38:44] giving them to God.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz you know who you are.
[1:38:51] Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; I just feel led to stay here just a
[1:38:53] second. You know, in the privacy of your
[1:38:55] own home,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; you know, when you're all by yourself,
[1:38:59] man, woman, boy, or girl, you know what
[1:39:01] you're dealing with. But you take that
[1:39:03] weakness to God.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; You take that weakness to God.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; You keep Are you with me now?
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz he leaves some things for you to
[1:39:16] overcome.
[1:39:19] Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Having a good time.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; I think in the world they call it time
[1:39:41] out.
[1:39:43] You're about to kill me.
[1:39:51] Men and brethren, let me freely speak
[1:39:53] unto you.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to pick it up. Freely
[1:39:57] speak unto you of the patriarch David.
[1:39:59] He's both dead,
[1:40:01] buried. Seplic is with us in today, this
[1:40:04] day.
[1:40:06] I'm sure there was a people still
[1:40:07] worshiping David.
[1:40:13] And he's seeing this before he spake of
[1:40:14] the resurrection of Christ that his soul
[1:40:16] was not left in hell, neither his flesh
[1:40:18] that did see corruption.
[1:40:20] This Jesus
[1:40:22] hath God raised up. Wherefore we're all
[1:40:24] witnesses, therefore being by the right
[1:40:27] hand of God, exalted, having received of
[1:40:30] the Father the promise of the Holy
[1:40:32] Ghost, he shall shed forth his this
[1:40:36] which now see and hear. For David is not
[1:40:40] ascended into the heavens, but he sth,
[1:40:43] the Lord sth unto my Lord, sit on my
[1:40:46] right hand until I make thy enemies thy
[1:40:49] foottool. Therefore, let all the house
[1:40:52] of Israel know assuredly that God hath
[1:40:56] made that same Jesus, whom ye have
[1:40:59] crucified, both Lord and Christ.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:09] A lot of time could be spent right
[1:41:10] there. And when they heard this, they
[1:41:12] were pricricked in their heart
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; and said unto Peter and the rest of the
[1:41:16] apostles,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; men and brethren,
[1:41:20] what shall we do?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; And he stood there and he said,
[1:41:30] "Get your tape recorder
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; and listen to all the tapes.
[1:41:37] Sir,
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; believe God sent a prophet.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; No, them things are fine.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Repent
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; every one of you.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:41:52] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:41:54] Christ
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; for the remission of your sins
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the gift of the
[1:42:00] Holy Ghost.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:05] Brother B said that is the inoculation
[1:42:08] to sin.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He said he said if doctors were given
[1:42:18] shots that would give you life eternal
[1:42:21] there'd be lines forever. You couldn't
[1:42:23] get near the building.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He said God gave you an inoculation to
[1:42:28] sin.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:34] He gave you an inoculation. Some of
[1:42:36] you'd like to have inoculation from the
[1:42:37] flu this week.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; But he gave you an inoculation. I'm the
[1:42:42] Lord that health thee.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; I'll give you the Holy Ghost. For the
[1:42:49] promise, this covenant is unto you and
[1:42:52] to your children and to all that are a
[1:42:55] far off, even as many as the Lord our
[1:42:58] God shall call.
[1:43:06] What is a covenant, brother Ron? Let me
[1:43:07] just spend a couple of minutes right
[1:43:09] here. God said to Abram, "I'll be your
[1:43:12] shield. I'll be your buckler."
[1:43:17] And Abram began to watch God. He watched
[1:43:20] God how he wa moved him. He moved him
[1:43:23] from one place to another. And he kept
[1:43:24] his focus on God. And God changed his
[1:43:27] name. Because in Abram and Sarah as a
[1:43:30] dominating female, he could not produce
[1:43:32] the promise.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; So God made a covenant with him and he
[1:43:37] took part of his own attributes and he
[1:43:39] puted on the inside of him
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; and changed his name from Abram to
[1:43:44] Abraham,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Sarah to Sarah.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A princess with God.
[1:43:51] Because in their own energies, all they
[1:43:53] did was he produced Ishmamail, which
[1:43:56] we're still dealing with.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And in our own energies, we'll only
[1:44:02] produce churchgoers.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; We'll only produce another denomination.
[1:44:08] But if he can come and transform our
[1:44:10] lives,
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; it'll be kind after kind after kind
[1:44:15] after kind after kind. Cuz every seed
[1:44:18] will reproduce itself. It will not be
[1:44:21] denomination. How can we protect this
[1:44:23] which we've got? How can we take care of
[1:44:25] it?
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; This life will reproduce itself.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's God's life.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; When God wants to reproduce horses, he
[1:44:39] produces horses. Horses. Horses. And
[1:44:41] then elephants. Elephants. Elephant.
[1:44:43] Elephants. When God wants to reproduce
[1:44:46] himself, it's miniature gods on the
[1:44:48] earth.
[1:45:04] Now, not only did God I want to just not
[1:45:07] only did God hide some things, but the
[1:45:10] devil did, too.
[1:45:16] Because the devil
[1:45:19] laughed when Abram laughed.
[1:45:22] He just kept getting older and he
[1:45:24] criticized him. He mocked him. He made
[1:45:27] fun of him. He whispered in his ears.
[1:45:31] No doubt the devil was just feet away
[1:45:33] from Melzdc as he sat there as God which
[1:45:37] God had blowed a body and stepped into
[1:45:39] two messengers go to Sodom and only feet
[1:45:42] away
[1:45:44] Satan was watching.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; He no doubt hears the words, "Where's
[1:45:55] your wife Sarah?"
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; She laughed in her heart.
[1:46:00] And he's thinking, "Good, this will kill
[1:46:03] her.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; This will kill her." All of these years,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; all of these years,
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; this will get her. And because she was
[1:46:14] part of Abraham and a part of the
[1:46:16] promise,
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; God refused to kill her.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz she was the predestinated womb
[1:46:23] through which the seed had to come
[1:46:26] through.
[1:46:27] Listen,
[1:46:30] God knew he had to come through Rahab.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; He knew he had to come through Tamar.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; God dropped that in brother Ed's heart
[1:46:43] here a few years ago to preach on the
[1:46:44] five ladies of grace. Listen, God was
[1:46:47] just revealing.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; He was revealing to this bride, "Grace,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I've watched over you.
[1:46:56] I protected your womb.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; He knew he had to come through,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Ruth.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; It did not deter the plan of God that
[1:47:09] Rahab was a harlot.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz out of her womb would come Boaz.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And he had to have the complexes of
[1:47:24] life.
[1:47:25] Because there was a Ruth headed his way
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; and he had to redeem Naomi to get Ruth.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Our Lord had to forgive the Jews to get
[1:47:39] me and you.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Father, forgive them.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Forgive them.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Why was he forgiving them to get me?
[1:47:59] Hallelujah.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; It was cruel. It was horrible. But he
[1:48:06] had to forgive him.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Abraham testified.
[1:48:19] He testified. He testified of the
[1:48:22] covenant. He testified of the covenant.
[1:48:25] He testified of the covenant. And one
[1:48:27] morning he woke up.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; He looked over standing combing her
[1:48:35] hair.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I read it this morning. Brother Beam
[1:48:38] said her hair was so black and shiny.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Her eyes were velvety looking.
[1:48:47] said she was the most beautiful.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; She was the most beautiful woman in the
[1:48:55] whole world.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Abraham's heard that. Satan's heard that
[1:49:02] testimony all this time.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Now look,
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; he's got laboratories all over this
[1:49:12] world
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; trying to give herbs.
[1:49:16] vitamins,
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; every kind of exercise machine there is.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Faceelifts,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; not going there.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; But he hid something from the whole
[1:49:34] human race himself.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; God has the power to turn you young
[1:49:38] again.
[1:49:46] Why didn't the theologians preach this
[1:49:48] to you in the churches?
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they?
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Why didn't they do it?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Satan was there watching.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I've asked minister after minister after
[1:50:00] minister, minister, what happened there?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; What happened there?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Here's a man above 100 years old. Here's
[1:50:08] a woman above 90. What happened?
[1:50:12] They had a baby.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; They've been married since they were
[1:50:16] children. What happened?
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Why would a king
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; a gentile king,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; why would he, of all of the women of the
[1:50:25] whole land,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm sorry. This just way it is.
[1:50:34] Why would he pick a 90-year-old woman?
[1:50:39] Why would he fall so crazy over heels in
[1:50:41] love with her?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; He's willing to kill him.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; He's not looking at grandma.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; He don't need another quote.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Abraham don't need
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; He don't even need Melazdc to visit him
[1:51:01] anymore.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; It's on the way.
[1:51:08] I say this to you tonight, it's on the
[1:51:11] way.
[1:51:26] have gathered
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; and don't know why.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Two men that stood like we talked about
[1:51:34] last night
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; that stood and talked with Jesus is
[1:51:39] getting ready to come back and preach
[1:51:40] them
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; the feast of the trumpets which is the
[1:51:44] seven seals
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and they're going to preach with passion
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; and they're going to take the scriptures
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; and they're going to go through are you
[1:51:52] with me now? They're going to go all the
[1:51:53] way through the Old Testament and bring
[1:51:55] them to Revelation chapter 10. And I saw
[1:51:58] another mighty angel come down.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; And he did. And there was a bride that
[1:52:04] took the book and she ate the book and
[1:52:06] she become the book. And they did. They
[1:52:09] got rid of all of their church ideas.
[1:52:11] And they did. They ate it and they
[1:52:14] prophesied again. They were voices in
[1:52:16] Jeffersonville. They were voices in
[1:52:18] Vancouver. They were voices in the
[1:52:20] Shannondoa Valley.
[1:52:23] There were voices all over the earth.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; They were lights pressing against
[1:52:28] darkness.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther went into the ground and
[1:52:37] it's incredible the work that he did.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; It is said that it would take 15,000 men
[1:52:43] with secretaries to reproduce the work.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; But his favorite scripture was, "I must
[1:52:49] work while it is day.
[1:52:52] for night cometh.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; He wanted this to be in your in your
[1:53:00] hands.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; He wanted this open word to be in your
[1:53:05] hands.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Don't never take it for granted when you
[1:53:09] put this under your arm
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; and you walk into church. Martin Luther
[1:53:13] gave every ounce of energy that he could
[1:53:15] give so you and I could get this book in
[1:53:18] our hands.
[1:53:26] John Wesley,
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; 5 foot one.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't stand out there with
[1:53:34] denominational preaching,
[1:53:38] but he preached with passion.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; He didn't have an internet to go around
[1:53:47] the world.
[1:53:53] That angel
[1:53:54] tried to light as many torches as he
[1:53:56] could light.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody must hear this.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Everybody must hear this.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; His mama had prayed like no other woman
[1:54:10] had prayed
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; cuz she was desperate.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; John Wesley was desperate. That's what
[1:54:16] would cause him to get on a boat and
[1:54:18] ride four months
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; to come to America.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; That America could have this gospel.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "You will never know
[1:54:29] what this message has cost me."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Your pastor
[1:54:39] was anointed
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; to try to give Brother a break. Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; To get him away to God's nature,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; not knowing that the torch would be
[1:54:54] handed
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; because when Paul Rivere rode, nobody
[1:55:00] worshiped Paul Rivere,
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; they simply caught the message
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; and went out to fight.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; We love and respect brother Franom.
[1:55:13] Yes. Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; I give my life for him right now.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; But let me just say this to you. He was
[1:55:19] not the one who stepped out
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; and took the book.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; He was the messenger.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And God had men,
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; prepared men,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; whether you want to believe it or not.
[1:55:37] The some of the greatest men that would
[1:55:39] ever put their feet in shoes.
[1:55:44] that would leave businesses,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; would leave homes
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; and give their life for the gospel of
[1:55:52] Jesus Christ.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz this message needs to be preached,
[1:55:58] brother Ernie, with power and
[1:56:00] demonstration.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; This message must come off of paper.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; It must live.
[1:56:11] Hallelujah.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; This is a thunder that shakes the devil.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; This is the voice of God.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; If all you saw was Brother Brandham, you
[1:56:21] missed the picture.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; If all you saw was your favorite
[1:56:24] picture, favorite preacher, you missed
[1:56:26] the picture. But that same God, Deep
[1:56:29] Zoe, wants to live on the inside of you.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:41] What have we felt this week?
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; The same God that walked the earth 2,000
[1:56:45] years ago.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; The same spirit.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That stood in Tacoma, Washington. That
[1:56:52] stood in British Columbia.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that stood in
[1:56:58] Jeffersonville. And brother Bam stood
[1:57:00] there and said, "You know, I'm waiting
[1:57:01] on something. I'm as helpless as I can
[1:57:03] be without him.
[1:57:07] It was that spirit that we felt in this
[1:57:10] building.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:57:32] I wish I could preach like brother Tim
[1:57:33] back there and just stand.
[1:57:36] But I wasn't built with that gear.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Some of us are just kind of like raceh
[1:57:45] horses. You're either standing in a gate
[1:57:47] or you're running wide open.
[1:57:53] Sometimes I just sit in the pew and I
[1:57:54] go, "Wow, I'd love to be able to do it
[1:57:57] like that. Wow, isn't that amazing?" And
[1:58:00] then I get up here and try to do that
[1:58:02] and it's it's a waste of human effort.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; What are you doing? Time out.
[1:58:29] This will teach you to put your children
[1:58:31] in a corner.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; He's sitting over here smiling
[1:58:43] 20ome years ago. He was screaming in my
[1:58:45] ear
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; and didn't know it. Run.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Run with everything that's within you.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Others have run. Now it's your turn to
[1:58:58] run.
[1:59:03] He didn't know me.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; And I responded.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I responded.
[1:59:20] I can't do it.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; But God, if it's your will,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; I'll give you every bit of energies that
[1:59:28] I can give you.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; I just want to take one more note here
[1:59:41] just for a moment.
[1:59:44] David had some men gathered to him
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; on the way to the throne. Amen.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I I'm finishing
[1:59:52] up here in just a couple moments. I
[1:59:54] promise you,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; I'm out of fuel.
[2:00:02] The scripture says they were men in
[2:00:04] distress. Do we have any of those?
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; They were men in trouble.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; They were bankrupt
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; and they gathered themselves
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; unto David.
[2:00:19] David had a desire one day if I could
[2:00:22] have a cool drink of brother Ron's water
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; if I could have some water from Jacob's
[2:00:30] well
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; cuz it's a covenant water.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; It's a water with promise.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Three men,
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; mighty gentile warriors. You know the
[2:00:46] story.
[2:00:47] But one of them put a sword in his hands
[2:00:51] and the scripture said he cle to that
[2:00:54] sword.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; He refused to let go of the grip of that
[2:01:02] sword.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; And killed a brother said he jumped in a
[2:01:09] pit and killed 800 men.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:17] This ain't Hollywood.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; This ain't Hollywood.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; In his own energies, no way.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; But God signed the covenant with David.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And he simply needed somebody that would
[2:01:37] jump in the pit.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; Don't have to be the best warrior.
[2:01:45] Don't have to have the best human fit to
[2:01:47] you. You don't have to have the
[2:01:49] brightest mind. You don't have to be an
[2:01:50] astronaut here.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Just jump in the pit.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; One, two. He probably couldn't count to
[2:02:05] 20, but he just kept punching.
[2:02:09] He got so tired he couldn't hold his arm
[2:02:12] up.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; So he probably just held it like this
[2:02:14] right here and they kept dying.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Don't never drop your sword.
[2:02:36] Now you see William Random stood on the
[2:02:38] side of the hill and on his knees
[2:02:40] praying and a sword appeared in his
[2:02:43] hand.
[2:02:45] He termed it the third pull, the king's
[2:02:48] sword.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He did not keep it for himself.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; It was handed to you. Because your bone
[2:02:57] of our bridegroom's bones,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; your flesh of our bridegroom's flesh,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; your power of our bridegroom's power,
[2:03:05] your spirit of our Are you with me?
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; You are him in bride form.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; And all of the prophets had been given a
[2:03:16] choice
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; standing there. What age would you want
[2:03:20] to live in?
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I'd like to live in that that last age.
[2:03:27] This was the kind of anticipation that
[2:03:29] Martin Luther went into the ground with.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look up on his
[2:03:36] face.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm one of them. I'm one of
[2:03:39] them.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; And a death angel walked into his door.
[2:03:44] Well, I know I'll come up
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Wesley. I know I'll come up.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I know I'll come up.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; We have been handed that kind of a
[2:04:09] torch.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; We have been handed that kind of an
[2:04:13] expectation.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Run with zeal.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Run with urgency.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Run with desperation.
[2:04:22] Don't let nothing get between you and
[2:04:24] God.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; You may leave this camp today and every
[2:04:33] devil in hell hits you. You were
[2:04:35] ordained. You were built to overcome
[2:04:38] this age. Don't let nothing get between
[2:04:42] you and God.
[2:04:54] I'm done, but this is going to be free.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; For the first heaven and the first earth
[2:05:05] were passed away, and there was no more
[2:05:06] sea. And I saw I John saw the holy city,
[2:05:10] the new Jerusalem coming down from God
[2:05:13] out of heaven
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; prepared as a bride adorned for her
[2:05:20] husband.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; I like this statement.
[2:05:29] Behold, I make all things new.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:37] And the spirit and the bride say come.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Give yourselves a great big hand. Give
[2:06:03] the Lord a great big hand this evening.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; We must work while it is day.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have the same 24 hours.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; None of us are allotted any different.
[2:06:31] All right.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Work.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Run.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Take what you got in your hand. Use it.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Press the mark like never before.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Forget those things which are behind.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Forget what happened yesterday.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Forget. Listen, I live with something
[2:06:56] that I have to forget. Every day I get
[2:06:58] burned up in my mind. Though I didn't
[2:07:01] see it, but I once I got past that
[2:07:04] accident, I had to put it in the back of
[2:07:06] my mind.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Press towards the mark of the high
[2:07:10] calling.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Run like you've never run before.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him look upon his
[2:07:21] face.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ryan, where you at? There to
[2:07:25] sing forever of his amazing grace.
[2:07:28] If I have to wait 10,000 years to get my
[2:07:31] time at his feet,
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; if my name is the last name called,
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; it don't matter.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; If I have to wait 10,000 years or 20,000
[2:07:45] years, it'll be worth the wait.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; But I'm sorry if you're behind me.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, brother Kim.
[2:07:57] Hallelujah.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; All my hope,
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; all my joy,
[2:08:06] all my energies
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; are to see him.
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; Well, oh, I want to see him.
[2:08:17] Look upon his face
[2:08:20] there to sing forever.
[2:08:27] Sing it, brother Ryan. Upon the streets
[2:08:30] of glory.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Let's dance.
[2:08:39] Oh my.
[2:08:43] Is
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; that your desire?
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[2:08:52] face.
[2:08:54] and sing forever.
[2:09:13] Oh my last
[2:09:16] to
[2:09:20] I want to see him
[2:09:24] upon his face
[2:09:27] and sing forever
[2:09:37] of glory. Here's
[2:09:44] all and
[2:09:48] oh that sounds so good. Can we sing it
[2:09:51] again? And all I want to see is
[2:10:02] forever. Ever
[2:10:05] see
[2:10:09] on the street
[2:10:21] ever to rejoice.
[2:10:28] One of them.
[2:10:31] One of them.
[2:10:34] One of them.
[2:10:37] And I'm so glad that I can say
[2:10:51] I say
[2:10:54] they were gathered. They were gathered
[2:10:57] in the array
[2:11:00] in his name.
[2:11:05] and power.
[2:11:13] I'm so glad that I
[2:11:38] get next
[2:11:42] I'm my brother.
[2:11:48] I will
[2:12:02] Heat. Heat.
[2:12:15] Heat. Heat.
[2:12:27] Want to
[2:12:29] say what I
[2:12:33] want to
[2:12:38] say?
[2:12:48] I'm so glad I
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Well,
[2:13:02] hate to say it.
[2:13:04] These are the closing comments. I feel
[2:13:07] like preaching actually.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's okay. I've got some meetings
[2:13:12] later on this week, so I have lots of
[2:13:15] opportunity. Don't worry, I won't do it
[2:13:17] to you.
[2:13:19] Well, you think it's hot here, young
[2:13:20] people,
[2:13:22] try hell.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:13:27] Yep. Try it sometime.
[2:13:33] I'd rather be sitting in an atmosphere
[2:13:34] like this in a presence of God and be
[2:13:36] sweating my brains out
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; than being in a lost eternity,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; trapped and never able to get out.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; This isn't just for white-haired men
[2:13:51] like me
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; and for parents that are standing behind
[2:13:55] you. For the promise is unto you and to
[2:13:59] your children
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; and to your children's children.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Don't look around the room. Look at me.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; We're not finished. Look at me.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; We want to exalt him
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; for what he's done this week
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; in our young people.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let your mind drift. Let's focus
[2:14:21] on what God has done this week.
[2:14:23] junior camp, senior camp, I want to give
[2:14:26] God all the glory, all the honor.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; And I think we can lift up our voices in
[2:14:31] thanksgiving and say, "Praise our God.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus."
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; I like what Brother Ron said last night,
[2:14:41] and I'm going to use it. I'm going to
[2:14:43] put it in my script bag. Don't you dare
[2:14:45] let somebody else worship for you.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; We are high priests. We are kings and
[2:14:51] priests unto God, offering a sacrifice
[2:14:53] of our praise. And if you can't open
[2:14:55] your mouth, I say you need an
[2:14:57] experience.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; In this atmosphere and what we've heard
[2:15:04] this week, saints of God,
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm ready to fly away
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; and I'll fly away. Oh, glory. I got that
[2:15:12] expectation what I heard this morning in
[2:15:14] my heart. Same expectation St. Martin
[2:15:17] had,
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Luther had, Wesley had.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had.
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; That same expectation is in me.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that we got Brother
[2:15:31] Jim Weber still here with us.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you, Brother Jim.
[2:15:40] Hallelujah.
[2:15:42] Devil's got mad at you for some reason,
[2:15:45] Brother Jim. God watched over you
[2:15:48] because you've got something for us that
[2:15:49] I need.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Strengthen you.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could have been a different type
[2:15:55] of meeting, wouldn't it?
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Would have had just an overcast over
[2:15:59] this meeting and so concerned and
[2:16:01] brothers passed on, but he's here
[2:16:03] rejoicing in the resurrection.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; I say to God be the glory.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Young people, have God done something
[2:16:11] for you this week?
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:15] Praise the Lord, brother Ben. We've
[2:16:17] heard the run, haven't we? Run.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Run with this message of Malachi 4.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Wes, isn't it a joy to see
[2:16:28] the young people and see what God's
[2:16:30] doing in their lives? God bless you.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Where's Brother Mark Stein ankle? Where
[2:16:35] are you? Are you I know there he is.
[2:16:37] Brother Mark came all the way from
[2:16:39] overseas
[2:16:41] to be here with us. We want to thank the
[2:16:45] Lord for brother Mark. God bless you,
[2:16:46] brother Mark.
[2:16:49] Amen.
[2:16:55] For all that have come to make these
[2:16:57] meetings possible, God bless you. And
[2:16:59] all the young people that put on this
[2:17:01] camp, God bless you.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; I'm always amazed at what God raises up.
[2:17:09] You know, we often think, well, they
[2:17:10] can't do without me. Oh, you just watch.
[2:17:12] If I wasn't here tomorrow, somebody
[2:17:13] raise up.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; You can't do without me. I said can.
[2:17:16] Who? Who are you?
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; God's got gifts in the body. Going to
[2:17:20] raise them up.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; This just didn't happen, saints. It was
[2:17:23] young men and young ladies
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; that put this on. And I think you'd be
[2:17:29] able to thank them for their labors of
[2:17:31] love.
[2:17:43] Amen. God bless you all. And there's
[2:17:45] going to be a a booth next week at the
[2:17:48] fair. And we had a nice little meeting
[2:17:50] here in the morning. Brother Andy says,
[2:17:52] "Work so hard." And brother Matthew and
[2:17:56] the different ones that'll be there. We
[2:17:57] say, "God bless you. Thank you." And
[2:18:00] we're expecting great things. It's worth
[2:18:02] it. Brother Andy's one soul. One soul.
[2:18:05] It's worth it all. counselors. One soul
[2:18:08] that you've affected
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; means more than me. A brother came up to
[2:18:13] me, gave me a big hug. Brother Tom, we
[2:18:16] love you. We appreciate all that you
[2:18:18] done for for us. You know what I said?
[2:18:22] Right there is enough reward. That's all
[2:18:23] I want. That's all to see you people
[2:18:28] fall in love with this God that I love,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; this message that I love. Amen.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Tear your mask off as we've been
[2:18:36] preaching and just love him with all
[2:18:38] your heart, mind, soul, and strength and
[2:18:41] worship this God.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; I love you, brother Larry. And I I'd
[2:18:49] like you to come up and close us in a
[2:18:50] word of prayer.
[2:18:52] Zeal
[2:18:55] still a fire and still a flame.
[2:19:00] Just a couple of announcements. the
[2:19:02] brothers. We're going to need 15
[2:19:04] brothers afterwards to meet brother Tom
[2:19:06] Frey behind this tent to put this tent
[2:19:08] down later on. He'll coordinate 15
[2:19:11] brothers. If you've got time this
[2:19:12] afternoon, would you please meet
[2:19:14] immediately behind the tent? Brother Tom
[2:19:16] Frey,
[2:19:18] registered campers and all those that
[2:19:20] are registered on grounds, we have a
[2:19:22] lunch uh available still for you. And
[2:19:26] the campers and counselors, we'd like
[2:19:27] you in the lower annex. We'll squeeze
[2:19:29] you in. I think there's some um
[2:19:32] different um awards and so forth that'll
[2:19:35] be passed out in the lower annex. We
[2:19:37] must remember Wednesday service is uh um
[2:19:41] not going to be we'll be uh returning to
[2:19:43] the church next Sunday. The sound all
[2:19:45] the sound equipment every all equipment
[2:19:47] that's here will get back to the church
[2:19:49] give you a few days to rest up and we're
[2:19:52] just going to have a time. You're going
[2:19:53] to have a time. I won't be there, but
[2:19:54] you're going to have a wonderful time on
[2:19:56] the Sunday morning with deep
[2:19:59] appreciation for all the sisters that
[2:20:01] labored in the kitchen. Really
[2:20:05] a very very deep appreciation.
[2:20:14] Yeah.
[2:20:16] I'm always humbled
[2:20:19] when I walk by that where they wash the
[2:20:22] dishes.
[2:20:27] That's one of my most humbling
[2:20:28] experiences.
[2:20:30] Every time I come to camp, see those
[2:20:32] sisters just working and brothers in
[2:20:34] there
[2:20:35] washing dishes
[2:20:38] for me, for you.
[2:20:41] May God bless them.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; I forget how many. It's well over
[2:20:47] 4,4,800
[2:20:48] meals that get done in this senior camp.
[2:20:51] Plus then there's junior camp. I think
[2:20:53] that's amazing.
[2:20:55] How do you like to be stuck in a room
[2:20:57] for 6 hours and the spraying the steam
[2:21:00] and
[2:21:01] but I I I I do appreciate it. Sisters
[2:21:04] and brothers. God bless you
[2:21:07] with the cabins counselors. Please would
[2:21:10] you just do an extra special work? They
[2:21:13] have a camp coming in tomorrow and it
[2:21:15] would just make it extra special for
[2:21:17] brother Derek and Sister Debbie for all
[2:21:19] they do for us at this camp. If we could
[2:21:22] just put a little bit more elbow grease,
[2:21:24] make it just as clean as spotless as we
[2:21:26] can. And especially the ones that are up
[2:21:28] top of the hill, that's what's going to
[2:21:30] be um rented out first thing next week.
[2:21:33] So, whoever's in those cabins up top,
[2:21:36] would you just make an extra special
[2:21:38] effort to make it very clean? God bless
[2:21:41] you. something we look forward to all
[2:21:43] year has now come to a close.
[2:21:48] Whether we have another year or not, not
[2:21:50] all of us will be back next year.
[2:21:54] After we close, why don't you give each
[2:21:57] and everyone a very warmed greeting?
[2:21:59] Brother Miracle, God bless you. Coming
[2:22:02] all the way from Chicago, Illinois with
[2:22:04] his dear wife, going to go back for
[2:22:06] 32-hour drive. That's not so bad a
[2:22:09] commute,
[2:22:11] Brother Joseph. That's not so bad. It's
[2:22:13] only 32 hours.
[2:22:15] God bless you, Brother Joseph. We
[2:22:17] appreciate you.
[2:22:19] Well, God bless you all. Thank you for
[2:22:21] coming. Your prayers mean so much. Your
[2:22:24] support.
[2:22:26] Until we meet again, God be with you
[2:22:29] all.
[2:22:34] Let's just bow our hearts.
[2:22:39] Father, you are truly
[2:22:41] an allconsuming fire, oh God.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we ask now, Father, as the
[2:22:49] close of this specific meeting, Father,
[2:22:53] comes to a a close, Father, it's just
[2:22:55] the beginning
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; of the fresh fire that's placed within
[2:22:59] us by your servants, Father,
[2:23:03] all over, Father. Those that are washing
[2:23:05] dishes, Father. Those that are tending
[2:23:08] the young ones in the nursery. Those
[2:23:10] that are running running the sound,
[2:23:12] Father. Those that are pick up the
[2:23:13] chairs, Father. Those that are pick up
[2:23:15] the trash. All of your servants, Father,
[2:23:18] full of that fire, Father. We ask in
[2:23:21] Jesus' name, Lord, that you would
[2:23:23] continue to consume us, Father, with
[2:23:26] your word, oh God, that everlasting
[2:23:29] word, that ever eternal word, Father, as
[2:23:32] we are absent from the body, we we would
[2:23:35] we will be present always and eternally
[2:23:39] with you, Father. I wrote in the leaf of
[2:23:41] my Bible, Father, today God, that if
[2:23:47] if that eternal God doesn't dwell us
[2:23:49] with within our hearts, Lord, we can no
[2:23:52] more die than you can die, Father, we
[2:23:55] will live eternally, Lord, and we will
[2:23:58] see our loved ones and we'll see the
[2:24:00] Lord Jesus Christ face to face one day.
[2:24:03] And Lord, we just yield ourselves to
[2:24:05] you, Father, and ask, Father, now for a
[2:24:08] refreshing upon those that labored so
[2:24:11] diligently throughout the hours and days
[2:24:14] and weeks and months of this meeting,
[2:24:16] Father, that you would refresh them. And
[2:24:18] brother Ron, a special blessing and
[2:24:21] supernatural energy. Pour into his body,
[2:24:24] oh God, in Jesus' name. He will not be
[2:24:28] empty no more, Lord. He is in that
[2:24:30] anointing, that fresh fire that you've
[2:24:32] placed within him, oh God, has now
[2:24:34] kindled our fire, Lord, as we brought
[2:24:37] our licks of fire. One from Oregon, and
[2:24:41] one from Chicago, Lord, and one from
[2:24:45] overseas, Lord, and all over through
[2:24:48] Canada, Lord, all through the United
[2:24:50] States, the South, the Northeast, and
[2:24:53] the West. Well, Lord, we've gathered
[2:24:55] here for one purpose. We're in purpose
[2:24:57] only, Lord, that we may have a closer
[2:24:59] walk with you, Lord. We want a closer
[2:25:02] walk with you, Lord. We want our young
[2:25:04] people to experience what we've been
[2:25:07] afforded as a young person. And God, we
[2:25:10] ask in Jesus' name that you would bless
[2:25:12] those that are here right now. And those
[2:25:15] on the internet, Lord, that are
[2:25:16] streaming the service. Father, may that
[2:25:18] same fire and that same energy that we
[2:25:21] feel here upon this platform be in their
[2:25:24] homes, in their hotel rooms, and we
[2:25:26] still remember Jock. Father,
[2:25:29] whatever the cause of this infirmity is,
[2:25:32] Lord, we rebuke it in Jesus' name.
[2:25:35] Father, he is a normal man of God. We
[2:25:38] ask you to lift him up, Father.
[2:25:40] Strengthen him now in the name of the
[2:25:42] Lord Jesus Christ. and those that have
[2:25:45] been afflicted by the enemy. Lord, we
[2:25:47] ask they would rise up and run the race
[2:25:50] that is set before us. Father, press the
[2:25:52] mark for the prize of the high calling
[2:25:54] of God. And Father, we just want to be
[2:25:57] at your feet. Lord, we want to know you
[2:26:00] for ourselves. Lord, bless every young
[2:26:03] person, every woman, every man, every
[2:26:05] boy, every girl. It's in this service
[2:26:08] today in divine presence who will
[2:26:10] archive these services. Father, that
[2:26:12] same anointing may touch their hearts.
[2:26:15] Fire them up, Father.
[2:26:17] When we get old, we don't just dwindle
[2:26:20] out. Lord, we just refire. Father, fire
[2:26:23] us up with your word, oh God, with the
[2:26:24] preaching we heard today. Father, how
[2:26:27] can anybody be still there just fire
[2:26:30] shut up in our bones, oh God, we cannot.
[2:26:33] Hallelujah.
[2:26:34] Hallelujah.
[2:26:36] Oh, God. Hallelujah. Oh father, thank
[2:26:39] you Lord for your grace and your mercy.
[2:26:41] Now go with us. Give us traveling
[2:26:44] mercies, Father. This one that drives 32
[2:26:47] hours, Lord. Supernatural strength in
[2:26:49] his body, oh God. Father, bless and
[2:26:52] strengthen this brother. And we thank
[2:26:54] you, Father, for every man, bo, woman,
[2:26:56] boy, and girl that's under the sound of
[2:26:58] this voice now. Bless them, Lord, and go
[2:27:01] with them, Father, as we carry the fire.
[2:27:04] And Lord, as as these men gather at the
[2:27:08] the fair this week, Lord, we ask in
[2:27:10] Jesus'
[2:27:11] name, Lord, that you would move upon the
[2:27:14] hearts of those people that pass that
[2:27:16] booth, Lord, that they may sense the
[2:27:18] presence of Almighty God upon these
[2:27:21] warriors, Lord, whether they'd be young
[2:27:23] or old, Father, that you'd speak an
[2:27:25] oracle through their lips, oh God. Let
[2:27:27] the compassion and the love of Jesus
[2:27:30] Christ be projected out of them, Father,
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; that they may be able to sense your
[2:27:36] wonderful presence as we feel it today
[2:27:39] in our bones, oh God. For we are bone of
[2:27:42] your bone, flesh of your flesh. And
[2:27:45] Lord, we just humbly bow before you now
[2:27:47] and thank you for your mercy, for your
[2:27:50] grace. Go with us now, Lord, as we yield
[2:27:53] ourselves to you for further work. We
[2:27:56] thank you for it in Jesus lovely name.
[2:27:59] Amen. And everyone said amen.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Till we meet.
[2:28:13] Till we meet.
[2:28:16] Greet one another. Till we meet.
[2:28:21] And when you're finished greeting, would
[2:28:23] you mind just taking your chairs with
[2:28:24] you? They have pellets at the back. It
[2:28:27] would help the brothers so immensely.
[2:28:29] Thank you so much. Till we me.
