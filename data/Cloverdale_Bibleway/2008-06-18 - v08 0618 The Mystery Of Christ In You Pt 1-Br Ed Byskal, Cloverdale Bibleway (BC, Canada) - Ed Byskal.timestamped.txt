[5:49] prayer at this time. Ask brother John
[5:51] Andy's, Brother John, if you just come
[5:53] and open service in a word of prayer.
[5:57] We have a a testimony
[6:00] uh here. I think it was missed on on
[6:02] Sunday, but uh how many remember brother
[6:05] Gary uh Walker from New Zealand who had
[6:08] that accident about 7 months ago?
[6:09] There's just a little note here. It says
[6:11] um uh as of last Thursday, he's been let
[6:14] out of the hospital after 7 months. as
[6:17] he mentioned the accident they had in
[6:19] New Zealand. The hospital presented him
[6:21] with a certificate of outstanding
[6:23] perseverance
[6:24] uh unfailing support for his wife and
[6:27] family and friends and inspiration of
[6:29] the staff and the patients and also
[6:31] inspired the staff to be more united
[6:33] amongst themselves. And they've got
[6:35] written here, brother Gary preached at
[6:37] church the very first thing he did when
[6:39] he got back to church sitting down. So
[6:42] we want to thank the Lord for that. He
[6:43] just say God bless you all.
[6:45] [Music]
[6:48] Amen.
[6:51] Just written here, God bless you all
[6:53] who've held them all up in prayer
[6:54] through this difficult time. So, we want
[6:55] to continue to remember our brother
[6:57] Gary. Also, we want to uh brother Edge
[7:01] Dodd has put a question to remember uh
[7:03] John uh that the Lord would touch him
[7:06] for a spiritual and a physical uh uh and
[7:10] a physical need that he has. Also, um,
[7:14] Sister Clara one was asked that we just
[7:15] remember her her mother as, uh, she's
[7:18] having problems with her eye ducts are
[7:20] being plugged and she's having a hard
[7:21] time sleeping. So, we want to remember,
[7:24] uh, her as well. If you have a need on
[7:26] your heart, just raise your hands. We go
[7:27] to prayer, Brother John, if you would,
[7:28] if you would come.
[7:32] Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus, for your
[7:35] marvelous works in our lives, God. Lord,
[7:38] we've come tonight to worship you. We've
[7:40] come to lift up our hands. We've come to
[7:42] lift up our hearts. We've come to let
[7:45] you know that we love you, Lord. And
[7:47] with all of our hearts, with all of our
[7:49] lives, we're here to thank you, Lord, at
[7:51] this midweek service. Lord, we're here
[7:53] to open up our hearts and let you know
[7:56] that you're our healer. You're our
[7:57] savior, our Lord. All everything good
[8:00] comes from you and from your fountain of
[8:02] life. And Lord, we're here tonight to
[8:05] worship you, to love your word, to enter
[8:08] into singing, to rejoice, to clap our
[8:10] hands, Lord, to bear one another's
[8:12] burdens, to pray for one another, Lord,
[8:15] to respond to your Holy Spirit, Lord, to
[8:19] catch the mind of the spirit. What you
[8:21] would say that is church tonight. Lord,
[8:23] it's good to be in the house of the
[8:25] Lord. And it's good that we can come
[8:27] together like this and just feel at home
[8:29] and let off the pressure, Lord. And we
[8:32] just have these needs that's been spoken
[8:34] and this testimony of our brother Gary
[8:36] Walker. Lord, we want to say thank you,
[8:38] Lord, for touching our brother Gary.
[8:41] Lord, you spared his life and a
[8:43] wonderful miracle and for his wife,
[8:45] Lord, and family and assembly there in
[8:48] New Zealand. We just pray you continue
[8:50] to touch him, Lord, and Mindy's body and
[8:52] the church there and the needs that they
[8:54] have. God, we just know there's many
[8:57] testimonies that could be spoken tonight
[8:59] of your amazing power and your amazing
[9:01] grace, miracles, Lord, and just divine
[9:05] healings. And to see you working and
[9:07] speaking in our lives is such a joy,
[9:10] such a thrill to know that you're the
[9:12] same yesterday, today, and forever. God
[9:15] bless these requests. Our brother Ed
[9:17] Dodd wrote in, Lord, and our sister
[9:19] Woman has a need, Lord. Hands are being
[9:22] lifted up all over this building.
[9:24] There's hearts that are being lifted up,
[9:26] God. Lord, you are our healer, Lord.
[9:29] You're the answer to our questions.
[9:31] You're the leader of our L of our souls
[9:34] and the bishop of our souls. And we just
[9:36] trust in you tonight, Lord. We lean on
[9:39] your shoulders, on your strong arms as
[9:42] El Shadi. We just want to nourish
[9:44] strength from your presence tonight. And
[9:47] Lord, we just want to receive at your
[9:49] table. May you anoint our pastor, Lord.
[9:51] Anoint the word tonight. Challenge us,
[9:54] God, with what you're doing in other
[9:56] places and around the world to Lord,
[9:58] expand our horizons, Jesus. We just love
[10:01] your people and love your bride. And if
[10:04] you would see fit tonight to bring
[10:06] tonight to be a healing for someone, I
[10:09] pray that our faith would be anointed.
[10:11] God, someone reach out and touch the
[10:13] hymn of your garment. Lord, someone to
[10:16] be saved and delivered tonight. Someone
[10:18] filled with the Holy Spirit for a
[10:20] revelation to drop down. That'll be so
[10:23] wonderful, God. And let this not be an
[10:25] ordinary service. Let it be an
[10:28] opportunity for your presence to do
[10:30] wonders in our lives. We love you
[10:32] tonight, Lord. We want there to be a
[10:35] communication and a heartfelt response
[10:37] from us back to you, Lord. You're so
[10:40] deserving of it, Lord. You're so
[10:42] wonderful to us. Bless the meeting, our
[10:45] brother Jason, the musicians, every
[10:47] heart that's here, those that are
[10:49] connected on the internet, on the phone
[10:51] hookup. May you just be with your people
[10:53] everywhere. Those that are calling on
[10:56] your name. May you just show yourself as
[10:58] the mighty God, Lord, made manifest
[11:01] within your people. Show yourself
[11:03] tonight, Lord. In Jesus name, we give
[11:06] you this service just as a love token.
[11:09] God, we're here because we love you. May
[11:12] you just come and meet with us in a
[11:14] special way. Thank you, Jesus.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[11:29] Amen. We're going to turn the service
[11:30] immediately to Brother Red as he comes.
[11:33] Let's uh let's sing We've Got the Power.
[11:36] I'm getting a little low reverb up here.
[11:39] Number 8 30 31 on the screen.
[11:45] We've got the power
[11:49] in the name of Jesus.
[11:53] We've got the power
[11:58] in the name of the Lord.
[12:02] Oh, Satan rages.
[12:06] We cannot be defeated.
[12:10] We've got the power
[12:14] in the name of the Lord.
[12:18] Before we before we sing that again, I'm
[12:21] going to do what I did when I first
[12:23] started song leading. You don't have the
[12:25] power. I'm looking at you. We've got the
[12:29] power in the name of Jesus.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; How can you sing that song without a
[12:35] smile on your face?
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Okay, so we're going to sing this again.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Let's have an attitude shift.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; We've got the power in the name of the
[12:45] Lord. Amen.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing like we mean it.
[12:53] Oh, we've got the power
[12:58] in the name of Jesus.
[13:02] We've got the power
[13:06] in the name of the Lord,
[13:11] the saints and praisees.
[13:13] [Music]
[13:15] We cannot be defeated.
[13:19] We've got the power
[13:23] in the name of the Lord. The second
[13:26] verse.
[13:28] For many years now,
[13:31] Satan's trying to stop us.
[13:35] Hold on. The bride of Jesus.
[13:40] Lord, we're still alive.
[13:44] Like a mighty army,
[13:48] waiting, maring onward,
[13:52] fighting every battle.
[13:57] Cuz the Lord's on our side.
[14:00] Yes, we've got the power
[14:05] in the name of Jesus.
[14:09] We've got the power
[14:13] in the name of the Lord.
[14:18] Oh, Satan ra.
[14:21] [Applause]
[14:21] [Music]
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] That sounds good.
[14:40] Glad to have Jason get everybody smiling
[14:43] while they're saying that. Well, the
[14:45] smile doesn't do it, but it does help.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; It really helps. Yes, it does. Well,
[14:50] we're going to uh uh just have a little
[14:53] uh little addition to the service this
[14:56] evening. I'm going to speak after a
[14:58] little bit, but um brother uh brother
[15:02] Michael Ray and brother Kim Dingwall are
[15:05] leaving this tonight actually about 2:00
[15:08] in the morning for the Philippines. And
[15:11] brother Ernie has left. He left on
[15:13] Tuesday. So they will be uh meeting up
[15:16] with him there. and then also brother
[15:19] Vernon and and the uh other uh brother
[15:22] Rex at the at the office Bible
[15:25] believer's office there and uh brother
[15:28] Kim will be I've asked him to come up
[15:31] and to actually show you what is taking
[15:33] place part of this transition to the
[15:35] message hub which is really a very very
[15:39] remarkable thing but it takes more than
[15:41] a couple of words it takes some uh you
[15:44] know it takes some visual uh things that
[15:48] will help you to understand what is
[15:50] taking place and the changes and I would
[15:52] say that if the Lord Jesus terries
[15:54] you'll look back on this service which
[15:56] is just you say Wednesday night service
[15:58] but you'll look back on this service and
[16:00] realize really what the vision was all
[16:03] about because you can't explain it in a
[16:05] few moments I couldn't explain it in 30
[16:08] minutes it would take me longer than
[16:10] that and I'm not as equipped as brother
[16:12] Kim to talk about this message hub so
[16:16] Um, but before brother Kim comes, I want
[16:20] to let the congregation know. I was
[16:22] going to save this for Sunday, but
[16:24] there's no use saving it. Uh, you people
[16:27] gave as the Lord has uh permitted you to
[16:32] give, has blessed you, and uh, everybody
[16:36] did their part. So, we were able to uh
[16:39] give to the work in the Congo to the
[16:43] Shakina Publications uh $30,000.
[16:47] And I thought that was wonderful. And uh
[16:50] a few days ago, we sent uh $30,000
[16:54] to build a church to assist to build a
[16:57] church in Moscow for three congregations
[17:00] that don't have a place to worship.
[17:02] They've been put out of where they are.
[17:04] They're are scattered. They're I think
[17:05] right now meeting in various homes but
[17:08] brother Sergey who many of you met who
[17:10] was here at the 2000 convention 207
[17:15] and uh he's just a very dedicated very
[17:18] devoted and a real god called person has
[17:21] been tutored up under brother Garrett
[17:23] Rodald
[17:25] uh he's actually brother Gear's
[17:26] right-hand man in his office but God put
[17:29] his hand on him and the people in in
[17:32] Moscow all three churches just came
[17:35] together and 100% asked him to come and
[17:38] be the pastor. So, he's flying there
[17:40] once every month of commuting there, but
[17:43] they have no building. And one of the
[17:45] difficulties with him actually moving
[17:47] there is they want to build a place
[17:50] where uh the where the pastor can
[17:53] actually live because he had Moscow is
[17:56] one of the most expensive cities in the
[17:58] world right now. And for him to move his
[18:01] whole family has a little wee baby in
[18:03] arms as well as other children to move
[18:05] them there and to get a place would cost
[18:08] them a fortune. So the church wanted to
[18:11] build a place and where they can just
[18:14] move into and then uh extend it to the
[18:16] sanctuary. I don't know but they've got
[18:18] the plans underway right now. So you
[18:21] pray that God will give them wisdom. We
[18:24] have tried to be real real good stewards
[18:26] of uh of the monies that you have given.
[18:30] Others have given also but most of that
[18:32] has come from the assembly here. uh
[18:35] there are some that have uh participated
[18:38] with us in the gift to uh brother docus
[18:41] and actually it's u what we're actually
[18:44] doing we are going to be buying the
[18:47] paper from Madawasa Maine in the eastern
[18:51] United States and he and brother doca
[18:54] was very impressed with the paper he's
[18:56] been there he said it's just such good
[18:58] paper it's excellent paper better than
[19:01] they had been getting earlier so he's
[19:04] very very happy with that. Very happy.
[19:06] And you all know what containers look
[19:09] like. We have them going through here
[19:11] through the truck crossing. And this the
[19:13] amount of paper that has been purchased
[19:15] will fill 20 containers.
[19:18] That's 20 containers of paper, which
[19:21] will do them between one and two years,
[19:23] but they might use it all up in one
[19:25] year. So, I'm thankful uh that God has
[19:30] allowed us to have a part. I'm very very
[19:34] thankful. And then these brothers,
[19:36] brother Kim and brother Michael, brother
[19:38] Ernie would not be able to launch
[19:42] uh this um the the printing stations and
[19:46] the message hub which has been worked on
[19:49] very very diligently with brother Darren
[19:52] has been working on it here. Brother
[19:54] Randy Snow did a lot of work. Brothers
[19:56] in Phoenix did a lot of work. But the
[19:58] the message hub is actually being uh
[20:01] conducted. It will be administered from
[20:04] uh from here and uh and and we would not
[20:08] be able to send these brothers except
[20:11] there was also another offering given
[20:13] from the local church here of $25,000
[20:17] to launch the entire uh uh Philippine
[20:21] project. So all of that has happened
[20:23] like in the last 90 days and I say to
[20:26] God be the glory. We're just so happy to
[20:28] be a part of whatever God is doing. I
[20:30] find that if you're good stewards as a
[20:33] church as as uh and in the leadership of
[20:37] the church, if you're good stewards to
[20:39] to reach God's objective, and I'll say
[20:42] this to you, and I I won't say it's thus
[20:44] sayith the Lord, but to me it's thus
[20:46] sayith the Lord. God is very pleased
[20:50] when his voice and his message gets out.
[20:55] And when you and I are determined and
[20:58] have that as one of our foremost things
[21:01] on our agenda, say this is of utmost
[21:04] importance, then God smiles on that and
[21:08] says I agree with you or you agree with
[21:11] me and God will keep pouring it in
[21:13] because if he doesn't pour it in, you
[21:15] can't pour it out. So all we are is a
[21:17] conduit.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I'm happy to be that.
[21:24] And we have people that send from far
[21:26] away. They they send through the through
[21:29] Bible believers because they know that
[21:32] something is actually happening. The
[21:34] message books are getting into the hands
[21:36] of the people, whether it be tapes or
[21:38] discs or DVDs or MP3s or whatever it
[21:41] was. Whatever God would put into our
[21:44] hands, we were determined to send it out
[21:47] and give the give the winds a mighty
[21:50] voice. And and God has honored that. And
[21:52] I'm I quite frankly, you know, you can
[21:55] get quiet on me if you wish, but I
[21:57] intend to I intend to pursue that.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; With everything that's in me.
[22:01] Hallelujah.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; And everything you give, I'll just say
[22:06] God bless you.
[22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He never give it to us to
[22:09] hoard it anyway. So, God bless you. All
[22:12] right, brother Kim. Uh, come and uh do
[22:16] what you do well and what I and a lot of
[22:20] other people can't do.
[22:23] Thank God for the brothers up in the
[22:25] sound room. You'll need this, won't you?
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; All right. You You want a pointer?
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a clip here if you want it.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Good evening. It's uh little difficult
[22:43] following behind brother Ed, especially
[22:45] when he says such nice things about you.
[22:47] But I do want to say that the vision for
[22:49] what we're going to see tonight has been
[22:51] brother Ed's. And I' I have found that
[22:54] when brother Ed finds somebody that
[22:57] maybe moves here or is here that he
[22:58] feels has something to offer, he just
[23:00] saddles you and puts you to work. And
[23:02] I'm starting to feel the saddle sores
[23:04] actually. I'm quite quite busy. But we
[23:07] want to talk tonight. I want to be as
[23:08] brief as possible. But we want to talk
[23:10] tonight about uh you know this is titled
[23:13] the Philippine mission restructure, but
[23:15] this is really a pilot project for what
[23:17] we intend to roll out throughout the
[23:18] world with what we're doing. Um it's
[23:22] going to take me a minute to figure out
[23:23] how to use this. There we go. I was
[23:26] hoping I was going to be able to read
[23:27] that.
[23:31] So a little a little bit of a history of
[23:33] the missionary endeavors in the
[23:35] Philippines. Uh the message was
[23:36] introduced to the Philippines in the
[23:38] 60s. It's a very mature area. The
[23:40] message has been there for quite some
[23:42] time. Uh ministers traveled through the
[23:44] Philippines and left some uh left or
[23:46] mailed books behind, mostly English
[23:48] books. And uh in 1995, brother Biscoll
[23:51] and brother Ernie traveled to Manila and
[23:54] established a Bible believers office
[23:55] there. Uh they set up a duplicator to
[23:58] produce seed libraries. Uh began
[24:01] translating and printing the message. Uh
[24:03] currently we're printing about 60,000
[24:05] books a year in the Philippines and the
[24:07] and translating about 10 books into two
[24:10] different languages on an annual basis.
[24:13] Um, this is a little bit hard to read,
[24:15] but basically what this does is show the
[24:18] distribution of what we were doing in
[24:19] the past or what we're what we were
[24:21] doing up until just a few months ago
[24:23] where basically in the central office we
[24:25] were printing with a commercial printer.
[24:28] Um, you know, several thousand books and
[24:31] then mailing those out all over the
[24:32] Philippines. um that necessitated that
[24:35] that business model necessitated having
[24:38] a certain amount of inventory because
[24:40] you know you print a book today you may
[24:41] not print that book again for several
[24:43] years so you had to have enough
[24:44] inventory for the new people coming in.
[24:47] Um and then as the inventory got sent
[24:50] out from the main office to another
[24:52] church of course each church like to
[24:53] hoard a little bit of inventory so that
[24:55] when new people got saved they'd have
[24:56] that and then typically homes were
[24:58] hoarding a little bit of inventory. So
[25:00] we found that when we traveled to the
[25:02] Philippines last time and India, we
[25:03] found that almost half of the books that
[25:05] we print are for inventory for people to
[25:07] have to to hand out as as time goes on.
[25:11] So when we look at the production of
[25:13] printing, uh basically in the
[25:15] Philippines, it's local third party
[25:16] printers. They go out and have people
[25:18] print them. Um a a thousand of Sabuano
[25:21] and 2,000 of
[25:24] I can't say these words, Tagalague. And
[25:27] 2,000 English books. Uh the cost of
[25:29] printing each time is about $2,500. So
[25:32] it's about 50 cents a book to produce a
[25:34] book. About 20% of those are kept in
[25:37] stock in the in the in the main office
[25:38] and the rest are sent out. One of the
[25:41] things that we're running into, and I
[25:42] found this when I spoke with brother
[25:43] Hildebrandt this weekend about the
[25:45] missionary work that he's doing and the
[25:46] outreach work with books, it's getting
[25:49] to the place where distribution postal
[25:50] costs are almost as high as the actual
[25:52] and in some cases higher than the actual
[25:54] printing cost.
[25:57] So we looked at what we were doing and
[25:59] realized there needed to be a new vision
[26:01] for the Philippines and basically what
[26:03] we're trying to accomplish is to
[26:04] download the burden of the word to the
[26:06] local pastors in areas where the
[26:08] churches are mature and financially able
[26:10] to assume this burden. So what that
[26:12] means is in some areas, you know, when
[26:14] we first went into the Philippines, you
[26:16] know, the people were didn't have a lot
[26:18] of means to be able to print themselves
[26:19] and, you know, so we helped out with
[26:21] that all these years, but in a lot of
[26:23] those countries, the economies are
[26:25] starting to come up to a higher higher
[26:26] level where they're able to take that
[26:28] on. So the other thing we want to do is
[26:30] make the word more accessible to
[26:32] believers. There's there's two pieces of
[26:34] this. One is often times a book gets
[26:36] printed now and may not get printed
[26:38] again for another, you know, several
[26:40] years. And so people come in in the
[26:42] interm and don't have access to those
[26:43] messages. As well of the English trans
[26:46] of the English copies of the message
[26:48] today, less than half have ever been in
[26:50] print of, you know, when you think about
[26:52] it, you know, we've had this message for
[26:55] all these years and less than half of it
[26:57] has ever been in print. Um, so and as
[27:00] well with translations, oftentimes
[27:02] translators will labor and labor to to
[27:04] translate a book, get it translated, but
[27:07] it can sometimes be several months or
[27:09] even years before that book actually
[27:10] gets into the hands of people by the
[27:12] time you raise funds for for printing.
[27:16] So it also allows the pastors the
[27:18] sovereignty to choose what message to
[27:20] provide to their own people. In other
[27:22] words, the you know what happens now is
[27:24] from a central office, somebody says
[27:26] this is what we need to print and we
[27:27] send that all out. U but maybe a a spec
[27:30] a pastor's preaching on on who is this
[27:32] mazdc and would like to have that book
[27:34] for his people. So this way, you know,
[27:36] we're going to be able to make that
[27:38] accessible and then we want to move from
[27:40] a push to a poll and I'll talk about
[27:41] that as we go on. So what is the
[27:44] solution to to to the current situation
[27:46] is really to create a message hub which
[27:48] is a centralized location where messages
[27:50] are available in all languages in all
[27:53] formats to all believers. Um that's the
[27:57] that's the core really decentralize the
[27:59] printing and distribution and provide
[28:01] print stations to the local churches.
[28:05] So when we look at how things are done
[28:07] now, this map looks like the believers
[28:08] off Bible believers office in the
[28:10] Philippines and basically they print and
[28:12] then distribute all over the country to
[28:14] regional churches, local churches and to
[28:16] individuals all mailed out and
[28:18] distributed throughout the country. In
[28:20] the new model, what we'll have is a
[28:22] message hub which is already up and
[28:24] running which is a central place on the
[28:26] internet where you can download all of
[28:29] the message all of the messages in
[28:31] English. We have all that was preached
[28:34] in English is there and available now.
[28:36] And then we now have all the
[28:38] translations that were done in the
[28:40] Filipino languages are now available on
[28:42] the internet. Uh so what we'll be mainly
[28:47] covering um in the in the distribution
[28:50] now from the Bible believers because
[28:51] churches will be able to print their own
[28:53] books now. We'll be printing for new
[28:55] believers. And I've I've got the word
[28:57] orphans up there. I thought I'd change
[28:58] that. But but basically people who
[29:01] aren't connected with the church, maybe
[29:02] they're living out in some remote area
[29:04] and a small group of believers. So
[29:05] they'll still be supplied from the
[29:07] central office and uh printing for those
[29:09] that we must print for that just don't
[29:11] have the means to be able to print. So
[29:14] this will result in about 80 to 90% of
[29:17] the believers being supplied locally,
[29:19] leaving the uh the Bible believes Bible
[29:21] believers Philippines office to only
[29:23] have to print about 5,000 books per year
[29:25] instead of about 60. So, as you can see,
[29:28] that will allow us to to shift some of
[29:31] our resources into translating it into
[29:33] some new areas that we'd like to get
[29:35] into.
[29:39] So,
[29:40] I need to back this up and let it come
[29:42] on its own. I think it's going to come
[29:45] one step at a time. Okay. Well, we'll
[29:48] start here with the message hub. So,
[29:49] this this is a view of the message hub.
[29:52] Um, it's found at bibleelievers.org or
[29:55] if you want to go and look at it any at
[29:57] any time. And basically we come into
[29:59] this the Can you back up one screen for
[30:01] me? We uh come into one screen before
[30:03] this this
[30:05] I'm hoping to see the icon for the
[30:07] message hub.
[30:12] So when you go log on to the Bible
[30:13] believers website, this is what you see.
[30:16] You click on the right hand side on the
[30:18] message hub. When you click on the right
[30:20] hand side of the message hub, you see a
[30:22] number of languages. you can pick the
[30:24] language that you that you actually want
[30:25] to get. And as we the translations
[30:27] become available to us, we'll be adding
[30:29] more and more languages. Um, up in the
[30:32] up in the top leftand corner there, you
[30:34] see a red icon that would allow you to
[30:36] translate this whole page into another
[30:38] language so that if you're actually from
[30:40] China, for example, you'd be able to see
[30:42] this page in simplified Chinese so that
[30:44] you'd be able to find what you're
[30:45] looking for. Um, we're going to stay in
[30:48] English. So, let's click on the English
[30:49] on the English site.
[30:52] So, what happens when we click on this?
[30:54] We get a list of all the English
[30:56] messages that are available. Um, we're
[30:58] able to sort it different ways. We could
[31:00] click on the on the alphabetical or we
[31:04] can sort them out by their by their
[31:06] number, which is basically sorting them
[31:09] out chronologically or by date. We can
[31:10] sort them out by location. So, we can
[31:13] sort it out in any different way and
[31:14] then scroll down through the list and
[31:16] find the one you're looking for. If you
[31:18] if we wanted, we could actually type up
[31:20] into the into the search bar, we could
[31:22] type something like scripture and it'll
[31:24] find every message that has the word
[31:26] scripture in it in the title.
[31:29] And if we were to type in Jeff after
[31:32] that or or Jeffersonville, it'll
[31:34] continue to filter it so that what we'll
[31:36] see here is all of the messages, pardon
[31:39] me, the message that has the word
[31:40] scripture in it that was preached in
[31:42] Jeffersonville. So that's the level that
[31:43] you can go in and search for the
[31:45] messages that you're looking for. I come
[31:47] from Edmonton. So when I tested it, I
[31:49] just typed in the word Edmonton to see
[31:50] everything that Brother Brandon preached
[31:51] in Edmonton. And there's a, you know,
[31:53] eight or nine messages that were
[31:54] preached in in Edmonton. So from here,
[31:57] we found our message. Now we can just
[31:58] click on that message. And we see those
[32:00] two little icons come up on the other
[32:02] side. One is a one says PDF. So that
[32:04] would be a text version that you could
[32:06] actually download to your computer and
[32:08] print to make a message book. And the
[32:10] other one is a MP3 icon which if we
[32:13] clicked on that we could either save
[32:14] that on our computer or or just play it
[32:16] directly here. So you want to open that
[32:19] MP3 copy.
[32:23] So if we click on that uh we can say
[32:25] open or save but let's just open it. So
[32:28] we're going to open that and and
[32:30] basically we can what we're seeing now
[32:32] is a a little bit of a delay as it
[32:34] downloads from the internet.
[32:37] Is it coming?
[32:38] &gt;&gt; PDF or the MD3
[32:40] &gt;&gt; PDF.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[32:44] So, in the PDF now, we can see the
[32:46] message and it's it's formatted ready to
[32:49] print as a booklet in the standard
[32:51] format that we're used to seeing. So, if
[32:53] you have a printer that's set up for it
[32:54] at this point, you hit the print button,
[32:56] it goes to the printer, you staple it,
[32:58] fold it, and you have a book.
[33:00] Now, what that means is that for
[33:01] everybody in this congregation today
[33:04] that has an internet access and a
[33:05] printer, you can literally print off
[33:08] every single message that Brother
[33:09] Brandham ever preached. So, that's
[33:11] what's happening at the message hub.
[33:13] We'll probably talk more about that in
[33:15] the future. I want to go back to our if
[33:17] we could just go back to our our
[33:19] PowerPoint.
[33:24] Can you hit the space bar maybe and see
[33:26] if this will come up one screen at a
[33:28] time? one icon at a time. There we go.
[33:31] So, what does a print station look like
[33:33] that we're putting overseas? Basically,
[33:35] they need to have an internet
[33:36] connection. If they don't have an
[33:38] internet connection, we can give it all
[33:39] to them on a disc. So, and basically,
[33:42] they need to have a computer, a printer,
[33:46] a this is a little binding machine that
[33:49] makes the book, folds and staples, and a
[33:51] cutter. So what happens is the the
[33:55] messages are downloaded from either the
[33:57] internet hub or the library disc. So we
[34:00] we locate the one where you know we
[34:02] install the program on the computer. We
[34:04] find the book that we're looking for,
[34:06] download it, print it, uh we bind it in
[34:09] this little machine that staples and
[34:11] folds it and then we trim it and that's
[34:14] it. That's a book. It's it's that
[34:16] straightforward. Basically, what we end
[34:18] up with is a one-man print shop that can
[34:20] print about a hundred books an hour. Um,
[34:23] somebody challenged me on that, so I
[34:24] tested it and I did a 100 books in an
[34:26] hour. So, that's a h 100red books an
[34:28] hour and a print station costs about
[34:30] $800.
[34:33] So, it's about $800 to to set up a print
[34:36] station in the Philippines. On this trip
[34:38] that we're going now, we're going to be
[34:39] setting up 15 stations. There's about
[34:42] 140 churches in the Philippines. So if
[34:45] each one of those is supplying books to
[34:48] several other churches behind them then
[34:51] you know like I say we get about 80% of
[34:53] the books actually being printed
[34:55] locally.
[34:59] So when we look like I say a print
[35:01] station between $8 and $900 the
[35:03] operating cost for us to print is about
[35:06] 46 cents a book. So that's cheaper than
[35:08] we're printing now. And we have no
[35:10] distribution costs because the printing
[35:11] takes place right in the local church
[35:13] and we don't have to distribute. So it
[35:15] literally cuts our cost in half. It
[35:18] also, you know, one of the things that
[35:20] it also does is it allows the local
[35:22] church to decide how many books they
[35:24] want. Right now they get one or two
[35:25] books per family per month. If a church
[35:28] wants to print more, I mean, you know,
[35:30] they have the they have the ability to
[35:32] print as many as they can afford to
[35:33] print
[35:35] or as many as they prioritize their
[35:37] expenditures towards. So, our uh our
[35:40] trip to the Philippines uh tonight at
[35:43] 11:00 where we need to be at the airport
[35:44] tonight. We're leaving at 2:00 in the
[35:46] morning. We arrived Friday afternoon. Uh
[35:49] so, you know, Brother Mike and I got out
[35:51] of bed this morning. We don't get to see
[35:52] bed again till Friday night, but uh
[35:54] which is all right for brother Mike.
[35:55] He's a lot younger than I am. Um, so
[35:58] Friday we arrive and set up. We're going
[36:01] to set up several uh print stations at
[36:03] the Bible believers office in Manila.
[36:06] And then Saturday we're going to be
[36:08] training the Bible believer staff.
[36:10] There's uh brother Vernon who's the
[36:11] manager and brother Rex who is now doing
[36:13] a lot of the coordination who will be
[36:15] doing the ongoing printing there. And
[36:17] then there's a number of brothers who
[36:19] from the different churches in the
[36:20] Philippines who are it kind of guys who
[36:22] are going to be there so that we can
[36:23] train them around how this process is
[36:25] done. And then Sunday we're going to
[36:28] have uh services at the Bible believers
[36:30] office. Brother Vernon uses that for
[36:31] their local assembly. And then Sunday
[36:34] evening we're going to set up for
[36:36] training in the morning. On Monday, we
[36:38] expect to have probably 30 or 40 people,
[36:39] which will be ministers and their
[36:41] assistants from different churches
[36:42] that'll come in and we'll uh we'll train
[36:45] them on how to do that. Many of them
[36:47] will be bringing with their their
[36:48] computers with them and we'll send them
[36:50] away with the printers and all the gear
[36:52] and they'll go back to their churches
[36:53] and be in production on Monday when they
[36:55] go home already. Uh Tuesday to Thursday,
[36:58] we're going to be traveling throughout
[36:59] the Philippines setting up stations in
[37:01] some of the more remote areas. And then
[37:04] uh Friday, we turn we we return back to
[37:06] Canada. So, it's a it's it's a bit of a
[37:08] busy schedule. Somebody said to me, "Oh,
[37:10] you're going on holidays in the
[37:11] Philippines."
[37:12] Sort of. Sort of.
[37:16] So, what are the results? For the first
[37:19] time, all English and translated
[37:21] translated messages are available to
[37:23] believers in churches and homes in urban
[37:26] and remote areas basically anywhere in
[37:29] the world. You know, some of the things
[37:30] that we maybe don't think about is that,
[37:32] you know, we're doing this in the
[37:34] Philippines, but you know, there's just
[37:35] a new there's a new Filipino church that
[37:37] just started in in Italy. There are
[37:40] Filipino expatriots all over the world.
[37:44] And now from the internet, they're going
[37:46] to have access whether they live in in
[37:48] in Italy. I know that there's a a large
[37:51] number of them in the Middle East. And
[37:53] this will give them access to message
[37:54] books that they can download and print
[37:56] themselves. Uh pastors can choose which
[37:58] books to print based on their local
[38:00] needs and our resources can be
[38:02] redirected into translations and into
[38:04] pushing into into new territories.
[38:08] Oh, I sent an earlier version that said
[38:10] on the that was my last page. I must
[38:12] mustn't have said this one. This was and
[38:14] the need is and the need is in the
[38:17] Philippines we're rolling out with 15
[38:19] workst with 15 print stations um
[38:22] throughout the Philippines that could
[38:23] pro that number you know in the long
[38:25] term could probably end up at you know
[38:28] probably 30 or 40 stations so that most
[38:30] of the main churches would have print
[38:32] stations and then you know when we were
[38:35] doing India pardon me the Philippines as
[38:38] a pilot project but when we look at
[38:39] India we just take everything we talked
[38:41] about here and scale it up by about 10.
[38:44] So, you know, ongoing we'll be um India
[38:47] and rolling this out throughout the
[38:49] world. So, that's what that's what we're
[38:51] doing in the Philippines.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Well, I think that's wonderful, don't
[39:04] you?
[39:06] &gt;&gt; I think it's just absolutely wonderful.
[39:08] And uh this afternoon, I don't know if I
[39:10] was able to tell the brothers, but I
[39:13] spent some time with our brother Dio
[39:14] just before he left. Uh he's been very
[39:17] very busy. We've been busy and uh Harley
[39:20] had any time together, but I spent some
[39:23] time just a little bit of time on this.
[39:25] Didn't have the PowerPoint as you've
[39:27] seen, but I just went over it verbally
[39:30] with him. And the one thing that you you
[39:34] will understand is that as long as you
[39:38] give the message books out, you know,
[39:40] just on a free basis to everybody, you
[39:44] what you have, you blanket a whole area.
[39:47] You have churches that are really quite
[39:50] wellestablished, very wellestablished
[39:53] and who could very well, very capable to
[39:57] provide themselves books. But as long as
[40:00] you're giving them out free, they will
[40:02] receive them. And there's no uh there's
[40:05] no really facility that is set up to uh
[40:09] for them to contribute. They could maybe
[40:11] contribute now and again or whenever the
[40:14] spirit moves them sort of thing. But now
[40:17] if they have a print station they will
[40:20] be providing their own paper their own
[40:23] uh you know their own print person or
[40:27] persons whatever and and have
[40:30] sovereignty leadership as brother Kim
[40:33] has said of what message they want to
[40:35] have and I said to brother do today I
[40:38] said there's a lot of people receiving
[40:39] your books that no doubt could very well
[40:42] afford to pay for their book and they he
[40:45] said well Yes, of course. But I said,
[40:48] then if you provide if those people are
[40:51] provided with just very really
[40:53] inexpensive uh uh print stations, I
[40:56] mean, have you seen all these people
[40:58] with uh uh with their uh cell phones? I
[41:03] I like what brother Kim was in a
[41:05] situation in the Philippines on the last
[41:06] trip and uh uh one of the pastors said,
[41:10] "We can never afford this. You know, we
[41:13] can't afford this." And brother Kim
[41:15] said, "Just a moment. I sat in your
[41:17] church Sunday morning and I saw some of
[41:20] the young people texting on their cell
[41:24] phones, and one of those cell phones
[41:26] will probably provide you with paper for
[41:28] a whole year.
[41:30] Don't tell me you can't print your own
[41:32] books." They just have to smile and
[41:34] acknowledge that they were caught.
[41:37] It's just what's really important to
[41:39] you.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you agree?
[41:41] &gt;&gt; It's what's really important to you. And
[41:43] if you really want it and really desire
[41:45] it, then uh then uh uh you know uh
[41:49] you'll find a way to get it and and when
[41:51] you do get it, you'll appreciate it a
[41:53] whole lot more. So that it's just it's
[41:55] really really a perfect and I personally
[41:57] believe that God has uh that that God
[42:01] has designed this whole thing and God
[42:03] has allowed technology to go where it
[42:05] is. I don't I believe that the tape
[42:07] recorder was not invented for music. I
[42:11] believe it was invented for this
[42:12] message.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not over your head. I'm down at
[42:21] kindergarten stuff right now.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And furthermore,
[42:26] the prophet teaches us that the the
[42:29] dimensions that various dimensions and
[42:31] the one dimension is to hold holds your
[42:34] voice is holding my voice right now. God
[42:37] did not create that for Hollywood.
[42:40] God did not create that for all the
[42:42] trash. God created it so he could send
[42:45] his own voice. Brother Brandham said if
[42:47] they had the technology that could bring
[42:49] back the voice of perhaps Jesus Christ
[42:51] or of Moses or whatever more. It's not
[42:54] lost. It's out there. We just have to
[42:56] have the, you know, the ability to bring
[42:58] it out. And and now we have the
[43:00] prophet's message and his voice going
[43:03] all around the world. And I don't
[43:04] believe that's an accident. And I just
[43:06] believe that it's it's a wonderful thing
[43:08] that we are able to have a part. Uh I
[43:11] want to make just another announcement.
[43:13] And I went out to the camp the other day
[43:15] and uh and I was just so surprised to
[43:18] see because so many of you were out
[43:20] there on the uh last weekend and I saw
[43:24] saw the pictures uh and and the deck
[43:28] that uh brother Chris and all the
[43:31] brothers went out there and worked and a
[43:34] couple brothers, brother Chedimir and
[43:35] brother Jeff Wman were still working
[43:38] there. And I tell you what, they have a
[43:40] deck. I think you're gonna land a 747 on
[43:43] it. It's just a an enormous thing. And
[43:48] uh so we have we have some ideas and
[43:51] some thoughts that are we're going to
[43:52] put into into motion for camp this
[43:55] coming year. Uh and I've been speaking
[43:57] to the right people. And I I'll just
[44:00] I'll just fly an idea past you.
[44:05] How many here might like to, don't raise
[44:07] your hand if you don't really intend to,
[44:09] but for an evening service to come
[44:12] before the service and if we were able
[44:15] to get uh two settings from the dining
[44:18] room, you might like to come and have
[44:20] dinner there and then go to the meeting
[44:23] afterwards. The dinner's not free. I
[44:26] have to say that first before you raise
[44:28] your hand.
[44:30] You don't go to you don't go to
[44:32] McDonald's and expect it free. But I
[44:35] mean to be right on the camp to get in
[44:37] that atmosphere to see some of the young
[44:39] people and and to have the first sitting
[44:41] for the young people. And uh I think
[44:44] that I know myself I would like to come
[44:47] there maybe a little bit early take in
[44:50] have a dinner and then go to the
[44:52] service. Wouldn't that be nice?
[44:55] &gt;&gt; That's what that deck's all about. It'll
[44:57] probably hold 250 people, wouldn't it,
[45:01] Brother Chris? I think at least that.
[45:03] And so that's what it's all about.
[45:07] I didn't see anybody raise their hands,
[45:09] so I'll tell brother Raymond to go easy
[45:11] on the food. Oh, well, there's a few
[45:13] hands. All right.
[45:16] It's all right. I'm just having my
[45:18] enjoyment here.
[45:20] Another thing we want to do on July the
[45:23] 6th. July the 5th. July the 5th. Forget
[45:27] that what I just said a moment ago. July
[45:31] the 5th, Saturday, July the 5th, we're
[45:34] going to have just a a a fellowship out
[45:37] there. And it's premature that I'm uh
[45:41] giving you the date now, but I want to
[45:42] give you the date so you don't get that
[45:45] weekend all set up out someplace else.
[45:49] We're going to have a a an outing and
[45:51] we're going to have a time where the
[45:52] whole congregation can come. And I've
[45:54] asked brother Raymond to arrange some
[45:57] great big barbecues to barbecue a steer
[45:59] or something and uh do it real real
[46:03] simple. It's going to be real simple,
[46:04] but we'll be able to come out there and
[46:07] many who have not been there, you'll be
[46:09] able to come out. I'd like the people to
[46:12] feel connected
[46:14] to this camp and to see how God is going
[46:17] to use it. It's going to be a surprise.
[46:19] yet it's going to be a real surprise of
[46:22] how God how I believe God is going to
[46:24] use this location uh for a for a
[46:27] testimony. That's all that's all we're
[46:29] interested in. We're not interested a
[46:31] bunch of entertainment or enjoyment. We
[46:33] want to enjoy it, but it's going to be
[46:34] for the glory of God. I expect to see
[46:36] the Holy Spirit come down in the
[46:39] meetings. I expect the Holy Spirit to
[46:41] get a hold of lives. And I expect the
[46:43] Holy Spirit to deal with people in such
[46:45] a way that we see people, men and women,
[46:49] uh, delivered,
[46:51] saved,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; revelated, and uh, children of God fed
[46:55] and moving on. Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with me and I'm going to
[46:59] read some scripture. You can turn in
[47:01] your Bible to second Corinthians. It
[47:03] won't be long, but I would like you to
[47:05] listen very very carefully.
[47:08] Uh uh because I would like this evening
[47:11] to prepare for Sunday morning, the Lord
[47:14] willing. So it don't only be attentive,
[47:17] but if you if you get a crumb, uh say
[47:20] amen. If you get more, say hallelujah.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; If you get a whole slice, say praise the
[47:27] Lord.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; If you get a loaf, jump up and wave your
[47:31] hands. Say, "Praise God, I got a loaf.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; I got a few loaves on Sunday. Didn't
[47:37] you?"
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was so wonderful. Let's just
[47:40] have prayer before we read. And while
[47:42] we're praying, and we're going to be
[47:43] praying for uh Wesley's father, Wesley
[47:46] Ordeal's father-in-law, Amanda's dad,
[47:50] they did a biopsy on some uh brain
[47:53] tumors today and said they were
[47:55] malignant and that they're inoperable.
[47:59] And that has all happened in a matter of
[48:01] a few days. And I said to Wesley, "It's
[48:05] not a matter of calling a whole bunch of
[48:06] people and getting
[48:09] uh people all emotional about it. So,
[48:12] we're not interested in that." But I
[48:14] told him, I said that every time I start
[48:17] to pray over a serious case in our
[48:19] congregation,
[48:20] while I'm praying, I'm asking the Lord
[48:23] in my heart, allow someone to just touch
[48:28] you.
[48:29] allow someone to contact God. Just one
[48:32] person, friends. Just one person.
[48:34] Contact God. And I and a statement
[48:37] brother Brandham has made. My wife's
[48:39] been very impressed with this statement.
[48:40] I I pass it off to you and I trust it'll
[48:43] touch you like it's touched me and that
[48:46] you will use it as I have used it.
[48:49] Brother Brand, I'm praying my belief for
[48:50] a woman. And he said this, "We bring her
[48:54] into your presence by prayer."
[48:57] That's profound. That's absolutely
[49:00] profound because he knew by prayer he's
[49:04] going to bring that needy person right
[49:07] into deliver them into the presence of
[49:09] God. And he the same messenger said in
[49:13] his presence the supernatural is
[49:16] happening.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I would like you to remember
[49:20] Junior Jeff is a brother's name. A
[49:23] lovely lovely believer. And we'll just
[49:26] have a word of prayer before we read.
[49:28] Father, we have gone on in the service
[49:31] and we have been speaking about your
[49:34] work, about your word, about your
[49:36] people, about the your bride. We feel
[49:40] privileged tonight that we're able to
[49:42] participate and be just a part of this
[49:45] wonderful great body of Jesus Christ.
[49:48] How your messenger saw them moving
[49:51] onward and upward. Oh God, onward
[49:54] Christian soldiers and saw that bride
[49:57] and all the international dress of all
[50:00] the nations. Lord, in your word said
[50:02] that they rejoiced and they sang a new
[50:05] song. We know that there will be great
[50:08] rejoicing in the new Jerusalem when the
[50:10] saints go marching in. Pray, Father,
[50:12] that tonight you'll just prepare us for
[50:14] that moment. That's the moment. We're
[50:16] not so much interested in tomorrow, but
[50:18] we're interested, oh God, in that
[50:21] moment, that time, whenever it might be.
[50:22] in the next 5 minutes or whenever it
[50:25] happens. Oh God, we are here tonight to
[50:27] get ready to prepare our hearts. I pray
[50:30] that you will illuminate our minds,
[50:32] Lord. And while I'm praying, I'm
[50:34] remembering our brother Junior Jeff. Oh
[50:36] God, I got some terrible news today as
[50:39] far as the medical world is concerned.
[50:41] But as far as you're concerned, Lord, oh
[50:43] God, and I desire with this congregation
[50:47] to use this same phrase with such depth
[50:51] and meaning in my heart, it's blessed
[50:52] me. We bring our brother Junior, oh God,
[50:56] into your presence by prayer. And that
[50:59] in that presence, Lord, the very fibers
[51:02] of these tumors will begin to dry up
[51:04] from the roots. Lord, let them begin to
[51:06] wither. I pray in the name of Jesus
[51:08] Christ, let the life pass out of these
[51:11] things, oh God, let the life pass out of
[51:14] them, Father, in your presence where the
[51:16] supernatural is happening. I pray, oh
[51:19] God, you'll resurrect him from this
[51:21] terrible situation and this condition
[51:24] and how the enemy has come in. Drive him
[51:27] back out in Jesus Christ's name. And
[51:29] now, Lord, I pray you'll anoint us each
[51:31] one to receive and for myself to speak
[51:35] your words. in Jesus name we ask it.
[51:37] Amen.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to read out of 2
[51:41] Corinthians the 5th chapter
[51:44] uh verses 17
[51:47] to 19.
[51:52] Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[51:56] he is a new creature. Old things are
[51:59] passed away. Behold, all things are
[52:01] become new.
[52:03] And all things are of God, who hath
[52:05] reconciled us to himself by Jesus
[52:08] Christ, and hath given to us the
[52:10] ministry of reconciliation,
[52:13] to that God was in Christ, reconciling
[52:17] the world unto himself, not imputing
[52:21] their trespasses unto them, and hath
[52:24] committed unto us the word of
[52:27] reconciliation.
[52:28] Amen. May God bless you as you have your
[52:31] seats and thank you for uh your presence
[52:34] here this evening and your real kind
[52:36] attention.
[52:38] I want to introduce
[52:40] uh a thought and a subject to you.
[52:43] Something I've been pondering for quite
[52:45] some time now. And some of this material
[52:49] and some of the quotes that I'll use
[52:50] tonight, you've heard uh especially when
[52:53] I took a series on the anointing
[52:57] uh because I'll be using some of those
[52:59] this evening and because it ties in in a
[53:02] different way. But I want to speak on
[53:04] the mystery of Christ in you. If you
[53:08] would care to, I would encourage you to
[53:11] take Christ is the mystery of God
[53:13] revealed that message and read it very
[53:16] slowly, read it very prayerfully and
[53:20] read it back over again. And when you
[53:23] come to a a page and maybe you you were
[53:26] in swimming water and there's lots of
[53:28] swimming water in that message, go back
[53:31] over and just read it again. Just read
[53:33] it very prayerfully. And and if a line
[53:37] or a phrase stands out to you, just keep
[53:40] going over it. Say, "Why did he say
[53:43] that?" That is that is so powerful. And
[53:47] uh and I believe it'll be a great
[53:49] blessing to you. And brother Brandham a
[53:51] he uh uh reads out of Colossians, I
[53:54] believe it is there, and he tells the
[53:56] people to read the whole chapter, which
[53:58] is his text. But that the the scripture
[54:01] where this mystery which is Christ in
[54:04] you the hope of glory and uh so I'm
[54:07] taking from that the mystery of of
[54:09] Christ in you. Now
[54:12] in the Bible we and we use the term
[54:16] Jesus, the name Jesus, the title Christ
[54:22] and the title Lord. And they're
[54:25] interchanged
[54:27] uh all the time. and have the same
[54:30] meaning for us say the Lord our Lord
[54:33] Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ but yet they
[54:36] they do have some distinct
[54:39] uh meaning and a distinct purpose. So
[54:44] Jesus is the name and brother Brandham
[54:46] says this Jesus was was his given name.
[54:52] Christ was his title. What he was he was
[54:56] the Christ, the anointed of God when he
[55:00] was born. That's what he was. And so
[55:04] throughout the scriptures and throughout
[55:06] the whole message, we freely use those
[55:09] and interchange them. But yet uh I want
[55:13] to make a distinction
[55:16] between Jesus the title the name and the
[55:19] title Christ
[55:21] also I will just make reference to
[55:24] because he is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[55:27] the Lord you'll find it right at the
[55:29] very beginning. I think it's first used
[55:31] in in Genesis 2 where it says and the
[55:34] Lord God in the beginning in the chapter
[55:37] one it starts out and God created the
[55:40] heaven and the earth and God said let
[55:42] there be light and then you get into
[55:45] Genesis the second chapter say and the
[55:48] Lord God said and that is where uh we
[55:52] find that the Lord is uh is Adoni or
[55:55] Adony
[55:57] which is Jehovah the exist existing one.
[56:01] So please just follow this closely. So
[56:04] Jesus Christ is the Lord the existing
[56:08] one. Uh he is also Christ the anointed
[56:14] one. So I want you to hold that and his
[56:17] name is Jesus. So Jesus is one anointed.
[56:23] This could be this could be one
[56:25] anointed. Now Jesus is one anointed. He
[56:29] is the anointed. But in the scripture we
[56:32] have an individual could be anointed.
[56:35] Various scriptures I won't take the
[56:37] time. A king king in the old testament
[56:41] was called the anointed. Uh and David
[56:44] himself when his men said here's your
[56:47] opportunity to kill Saul. He said he
[56:50] wouldn't touch the Lord's anointed. See,
[56:53] he was because Saul was in in in his
[56:56] kingly office. The high priest was
[56:59] considered one who was anointed. And
[57:02] then of course, the anointed one is none
[57:04] other than the Messiah. And we have
[57:07] reference to the Lord Jesus Christ. Now,
[57:11] in the this is where I'll cover a little
[57:13] bit of ground for those of you that are
[57:15] familiar with it, that have been here in
[57:16] the service and heard the series on the
[57:19] uh anointing itself. But in order to
[57:22] understand where I'm wanting to go with
[57:24] you, uh, we take the origin of the
[57:28] anointing and what what it really is.
[57:31] And even though I'm covering some some
[57:33] of the same ground, I I'm covering it
[57:36] for a completely different purpose. So,
[57:38] you'll have to just bear with me uh, in
[57:41] case it sounds that I'm being
[57:42] repetitious.
[57:44] Now,
[57:46] and if I'm emphasizing things, I
[57:49] emphasize it for a specific purpose. And
[57:52] now, when the the message I asked you to
[57:55] read, Christ is the mystery of God
[57:57] revealed. And we let that run off that
[57:59] title because we're so so familiar with
[58:01] it. But I just want you to digest it
[58:04] slowly. It didn't say Jesus was the
[58:07] mystery.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Didn't say God was the mystery.
[58:13] said, "Christ
[58:16] is the mystery."
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Christ the mystery.
[58:23] Just everyone say that. Christ the
[58:26] mystery. Now, Brother Bren said, "If you
[58:28] want to understand anything, you got to
[58:30] go back to the beginning." Well, the
[58:32] beginning of the anointing was actually
[58:37] when God
[58:40] in before he says before there was a
[58:43] molecule, before there was a star,
[58:45] before there was anything, God the
[58:48] self-existent one, God, the
[58:50] self-existent one. And he had
[58:54] attributes. He had uh he was God. He's
[58:58] he's filled with life. He's filled with
[59:01] all of these uh marvelous things, but
[59:05] he's the self-existent one. And they had
[59:08] not been expressed. And that's what that
[59:10] message is really all about. They had
[59:12] not been expressed. So he says, if you
[59:16] want to know what's truth and what's
[59:19] right, what right things are, we have to
[59:21] go back to the beginning. Now, in
[59:24] Christ, the mystery of God revealed,
[59:26] Brother Brandham starts out. He says, he
[59:28] says, "Now, God's secret mystery." I'm
[59:31] I'm going to come back to that really in
[59:34] depth on Sunday, the Lord willing. God's
[59:36] secret mystery that he had before the
[59:40] world began. Uh maybe just drop this in.
[59:44] What brother Brandham is referring to
[59:46] and what he comes to in a number of
[59:48] different ways is that God's secret
[59:51] mystery actually had to do with the
[59:53] coming of Christ, the second coming of
[59:56] Christ. And he makes he makes statements
[59:59] and references that all point to that
[1:00:01] direction. But he drops it off and I'm
[1:00:03] going to drop it off also. Now, God's
[1:00:06] secret mystery he had before the world
[1:00:09] began. And then he stops. Now
[1:00:13] back in the back part of God's mind. Now
[1:00:16] he said earlier in another message, you
[1:00:18] have to go back to the beginning. So I'm
[1:00:20] suggesting to you that this is a good
[1:00:22] place to start. In the back part of
[1:00:26] God's mind,
[1:00:28] there was something that he was trying
[1:00:31] and was going to achieve. Not he was
[1:00:34] just going to try, but he was going to
[1:00:36] achieve it. And he had a motive in doing
[1:00:40] it. See, that's the way I read a
[1:00:41] message. That's the way I let brother
[1:00:43] Brandon preach to me. He had a motive.
[1:00:46] He had a He was trying and he was going
[1:00:49] to achieve it. And he had a motive in
[1:00:52] doing it. And here was the motive. In
[1:00:54] order
[1:00:56] to let himself be expressed. So now,
[1:01:00] Brother Random has taken us back into
[1:01:03] the the eons of time when God was by
[1:01:06] himself. But he had within him he had
[1:01:09] these attributes. He had these
[1:01:12] characteristics and he said but but he
[1:01:14] had a he had something he was trying and
[1:01:18] he was going to achieve. He had a had a
[1:01:22] motive in what in this achievement that
[1:01:25] he wanted to achieve. Now he's dealing
[1:01:26] with his great secret. He wanted to
[1:01:29] achieve something and it was a great
[1:01:31] mystery. It's a great secret but he
[1:01:33] wanted to make it. And what was it? He
[1:01:35] said he wanted to express himself. So he
[1:01:39] now he wanted now an expression is
[1:01:42] something that is unfolding or an
[1:01:44] expression is something that is is is it
[1:01:47] it suggest that it's moving that it's
[1:01:49] coming forth. I'm going to express
[1:01:51] something. If I said to you I'm going to
[1:01:53] express something to you now. You would
[1:01:55] wait. Okay. How is he going to do it? Is
[1:01:58] he going to demonstrate it? Is he just
[1:01:59] going to speak it? But it's going to be
[1:02:01] something that's going to come forth so
[1:02:03] that if he expresses it, I hope that I
[1:02:06] can grasp it. I hope I can understand
[1:02:08] it. I hope it will be, you know, uh uh w
[1:02:11] within my within my ability to grasp it.
[1:02:14] So now God was going to hed
[1:02:17] himself. Now throughout the message,
[1:02:22] throughout the message,
[1:02:24] Christ is the mystery
[1:02:27] of God revealed. Throughout that
[1:02:28] message, brother Brandham uses different
[1:02:31] words that essentially have the same
[1:02:34] meaning
[1:02:36] and the in these various words that he
[1:02:38] uses. Number one, he he he uses the the
[1:02:42] phrase of expression or self-expression.
[1:02:46] He uses it all the time because that is
[1:02:48] something that is coming forth. God
[1:02:51] wanted to reveal or selfexpress
[1:02:55] himself to the people. And here's where
[1:02:58] he uses this. Now, if he had if he had
[1:03:02] this three-fold purpose, brother
[1:03:04] Brandham talks about the three-fold
[1:03:06] purpose. If he had this three-fold
[1:03:09] purpose, and he breaks it off, says, "We
[1:03:12] want to find out what is this three-fold
[1:03:15] purpose." Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; The first thing and when you say the
[1:03:19] first thing that is the first thing the
[1:03:22] first thing was that God wanted to
[1:03:26] reveal himself to the people. It this
[1:03:30] great uh eternal God. He wanted to
[1:03:34] reveal himself to the people. That was
[1:03:37] his secret. He wanted to reveal himself
[1:03:40] to the people. And he says he couldn't
[1:03:43] do it as the great Jehovah God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; So he couldn't do it as Jehovah God.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Who covered all space and time and
[1:03:53] eternity. He could not. He's too great
[1:03:57] to ever be revealed to people because it
[1:04:01] would be too mysterious. So now here's
[1:04:03] God and a prophet messenger standing on
[1:04:06] earth saying God in his in in the form
[1:04:09] that he is in that great eternal
[1:04:12] self-existent one. There is no way for
[1:04:15] him to reveal himself to the people
[1:04:18] because it would be too mysterious. This
[1:04:20] God that fills all time and space. Who
[1:04:23] can understand God who had no beginning
[1:04:25] and has no end? Who can understand God
[1:04:28] that that can speak worlds into
[1:04:30] existence or out of existence? Who can
[1:04:32] understand? We can't. It would be too
[1:04:34] mysterious. But God wanted to reveal
[1:04:37] himself. In other words, unfold himself
[1:04:40] to the people. How would he do that? Ah,
[1:04:44] but God had God had a thought. God had a
[1:04:48] a way that he was going to do it. God
[1:04:51] had something he was going to try to do
[1:04:53] and he was going to do it and he was
[1:04:55] going to achieve it. And the agent the
[1:04:58] agent was that he had to transfer his
[1:05:01] thoughts and and and and bring those
[1:05:03] out. So the the process was the thought
[1:05:06] and then the thought would be a word and
[1:05:09] the word would be spoken. Brother
[1:05:10] Brandham says that perhaps dozens of
[1:05:13] times. So now he has a process going
[1:05:15] going forth and brother Brandham
[1:05:18] describes that as being the the word was
[1:05:21] the logos that went out. But it wasn't
[1:05:23] only something going out from God. It
[1:05:26] was the anointing. It was the anointing
[1:05:28] that was going out. So now the anointing
[1:05:31] which links right directly with the
[1:05:33] title Christ would be the power that
[1:05:37] would be the agent that he would take
[1:05:40] and transfer his thoughts down into
[1:05:43] actually the anointing became a creative
[1:05:46] power.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; The anointing became the power of
[1:05:50] wisdom. The anointing became the direct
[1:05:54] agent by which God would take and
[1:05:56] transfer what he was into something that
[1:06:00] would express him.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; You following me this far? All right. So
[1:06:06] now he also said he said he wanted to
[1:06:09] reveal himself. He wanted to express
[1:06:11] himself. You'll find that all through
[1:06:13] that message. And then he says also, and
[1:06:16] you've heard me say this, one of my
[1:06:17] favorite one of my favorite quotes, and
[1:06:20] I'll tell you now why it means so much
[1:06:22] to me. He says that he uh but he what
[1:06:26] what he wanted to do. He said what he
[1:06:28] wanted to do. He loved fatherhood
[1:06:33] for he was a father.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Now here he had this this attribute of
[1:06:39] fatherhood. He had that within his
[1:06:42] being. He loved that
[1:06:45] attribute of fatherhood.
[1:06:48] What is a father? A father is one when
[1:06:51] you think of a father, you think of one
[1:06:53] that has brought forth life,
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; has unfolded. So he's got a a a child,
[1:07:00] got a son, got a daughter, and then and
[1:07:03] it resembles the father. Does not saying
[1:07:06] it doesn't resemble the mother, but they
[1:07:08] brought forth life. It has to come from
[1:07:10] the seed. And the seed come from the
[1:07:13] father.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Am I correct?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; So now he loved that that very thought
[1:07:21] of bringing something forth. He loved
[1:07:24] that. So he loved fatherhood. Listen now
[1:07:27] these scriptures will mean so much more
[1:07:29] for you. For God so loved the world
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; that he brought that he gave his only
[1:07:36] begotten son. He so loved the world that
[1:07:40] he in in redemption his thought of
[1:07:43] redemption that he brought forth a son
[1:07:47] something and what was son what was
[1:07:49] Jesus he was the expression of the
[1:07:52] invisible God
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; was he not
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; so the fulfillment of Luke 17 and30
[1:08:01] in the day when the son of man will be
[1:08:04] revealed do you know what it is that you
[1:08:06] saw do you know what it is that you hear
[1:08:08] is evidence of God's loving love for
[1:08:13] fatherhood. He so loved fatherhood that
[1:08:16] he would fulfill Luke 17:30 in a day
[1:08:20] when the world would sink into a place
[1:08:22] of of of of such debauchery where we are
[1:08:26] today. Oh my. I sometimes I wonder if
[1:08:29] there's any hope. You hear what's
[1:08:31] happening in California just now and all
[1:08:33] the the kind of marriages that they're
[1:08:35] having. just too despicable to talk
[1:08:37] about. But God loved fatherhood.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And so in Luke 17:30 he said and Jesus
[1:08:44] when he was here that he was that son
[1:08:46] that God had sent as a redeemer. He said
[1:08:49] now when you see the conditions of Sodom
[1:08:51] and to see the conditions of Noah's day
[1:08:54] once again even so will it be when the
[1:08:56] son
[1:08:58] the son of man will be revealed. one
[1:09:02] who's who's being revealed the
[1:09:04] revelation of it. That whole thing is
[1:09:06] happening because God loved fatherhood.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; He loved fatherhood.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; And in loving of father in in in in
[1:09:15] loving fatherhood, he didn't say he
[1:09:17] loved father but he loved fatherhood. He
[1:09:19] loved the very concept of bringing
[1:09:22] something forth because that which he
[1:09:25] brought forth would express himself
[1:09:28] which was his first and foremost desire.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said the first thing he
[1:09:34] wanted was to express himself.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And now so express himself in different
[1:09:40] ways but the son would be the fullness
[1:09:43] of that expression. Amen.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jesus speaking, "If ye if
[1:09:52] if you being evil," he said, "Know how
[1:09:55] to give good gifts to your children,
[1:09:58] how much more
[1:10:01] how much more shall your father
[1:10:05] give good gifts? Or your father which is
[1:10:08] in heaven give good things to them that
[1:10:11] ask him?" Why would he want to give good
[1:10:14] things? Cuz he loves fatherhood.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And a father loves to give. He just
[1:10:20] loves fatherhood. He gave a son.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; He gave everything that is that is ne.
[1:10:26] If we could catch that, I tell you what,
[1:10:28] even change your day tomorrow.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Find my father. He desires to give good
[1:10:35] things to his children.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Our
[1:10:42] father doesn't even want us to be sick.
[1:10:45] Our father doesn't want us to get snared
[1:10:48] by the devil. Our father doesn't want us
[1:10:50] to love the world. He wants us to love
[1:10:53] him.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; So then now the term father speaks of of
[1:11:00] the one from whom life has proceeded.
[1:11:04] That's why Jesus said, "I have come from
[1:11:06] God. I proceeded forth from God. Why did
[1:11:11] he proceed forth? Because before he
[1:11:13] proceeded forth, it was that that very
[1:11:16] act of him proceeding forth was
[1:11:19] initiated by God's love to be a father.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; I want to have children. I want to have
[1:11:25] a family.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have people. Hallelujah.
[1:11:29] And they are all going to be an
[1:11:31] expression of me.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:37] So thus the father
[1:11:41] or the word expression,
[1:11:44] the word reveal, the word manifest,
[1:11:48] all of these have one thing in common
[1:11:51] and that is it speaks of a something
[1:11:54] coming forth, unfolding,
[1:11:56] unfolding
[1:11:58] that's expressing,
[1:12:00] revealing,
[1:12:02] manifesting.
[1:12:06] It's a coming forth from a source
[1:12:10] from perhaps a single source. Now
[1:12:14] in the message show us the father.
[1:12:18] Brother Brandham quotes the scripture.
[1:12:20] God was in Christ.
[1:12:24] Who was he in?
[1:12:27] God was in Christ.
[1:12:30] The unfolding.
[1:12:32] God was in that unfolding.
[1:12:36] to reconcile the world to himself. So
[1:12:39] there's something in that mystery of
[1:12:43] him. Just hold on to it. Now something
[1:12:46] in that it was always mystical when God
[1:12:49] would unfold himself.
[1:12:52] I'll just drop this in so you can get
[1:12:55] where I'm going. And this is kind of the
[1:12:57] heart of one of the thoughts.
[1:13:00] I want to make a distinction between
[1:13:03] Christ and Jesus.
[1:13:05] And I want to make a distinction between
[1:13:08] the revelation, the manifestation, and
[1:13:11] the revelation. And I'm going to show
[1:13:14] you all through the scripture where in
[1:13:16] this unfolding, God is revealing
[1:13:19] himself. Now, don't get confused. God is
[1:13:22] revealing himself. But it doesn't mean
[1:13:24] that the people had the revelation.
[1:13:29] God manifested himself. So the
[1:13:32] manifestation would happen but because
[1:13:35] it was the unfolding of God to and and
[1:13:38] and it was being initiated by his desire
[1:13:40] to express himself so that he could
[1:13:42] reconcile his own back to him. But when
[1:13:45] it was being unfolded, it was so
[1:13:47] mysterious
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; and the people couldn't understand what
[1:13:52] was happening. Couldn't identify even
[1:13:54] what was happening. And that's where I'm
[1:13:56] going to be going now just in a moment.
[1:13:58] So now said and show us the father said
[1:14:02] uh Jesus God was in Christ reconciling
[1:14:05] the world to himself. He said that's
[1:14:07] exactly what it was. And now look in the
[1:14:10] beginning he says there I see that great
[1:14:13] space yonder and then the logos went out
[1:14:17] from God. The logos which was the word
[1:14:20] it went out of God which was the Christ.
[1:14:25] the anointing that went out.
[1:14:30] So that's the agent that is the that's
[1:14:33] the force
[1:14:35] that whereby God would create in the
[1:14:38] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:14:41] with God and the word was God and the
[1:14:45] word was made flesh but in the beginning
[1:14:49] was God and the prophet is telling us
[1:14:53] how the anointing went out. I see this
[1:14:55] light. I see this little halo. He says
[1:14:58] it in a couple places. I see it coming
[1:15:00] out from God.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; And he said it was the anointing.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; It was Christ. Says another place it was
[1:15:07] the son of God. What is it? It was
[1:15:10] coming out as a son because he was a
[1:15:12] father and he loved fatherhood.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So he conceived in his mind. This must
[1:15:17] be a son.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It'll be like me.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; He'll act like me. He'll speak like me.
[1:15:24] He'll be my son. He'll know. He'll be my
[1:15:27] son because I love fatherhood.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; I want to be a father. I want something
[1:15:32] to express me. See where it all comes
[1:15:35] back. And here the prophet of God is
[1:15:37] bringing it so precisely. Don't don't
[1:15:40] miss it. He said that's the first thing
[1:15:42] that was in his mind way in the back
[1:15:44] part of his mind before anything was
[1:15:46] created. He had in the back part of his
[1:15:48] mind. I want to be expressed. How's the
[1:15:51] best way to be expressed is in my son.
[1:15:55] But not only my son
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; also in many other ways he would express
[1:16:02] himself.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; So it's the coming forth the logos the
[1:16:05] word the creative power the attributes
[1:16:08] coming out of God.
[1:16:11] And so he said now look in the beginning
[1:16:13] and he said this anointing went out and
[1:16:15] we're standing on the banister watching
[1:16:17] the watching the creation come into
[1:16:20] existence. That's why people say God and
[1:16:23] creation. That's why the prophet said,
[1:16:25] "God is in creation. God is in creation.
[1:16:28] God's in his word. God's in his people
[1:16:33] watching the creation come into
[1:16:34] existence and see whether he was his
[1:16:37] son." Now
[1:16:40] the attitude and who is God?
[1:16:42] He said it's similar but just slightly
[1:16:45] different.
[1:16:47] So you just take it as a class. Will you
[1:16:48] do that? Logos that went out. He says,
[1:16:52] "And that was the logos that went out of
[1:16:54] God." Notice it went out of God in the
[1:16:58] beginning. That was the son of God that
[1:17:01] came out of the bosom of the father.
[1:17:04] That was what was in the beginning was
[1:17:06] the word. And the word was with God. And
[1:17:08] the word was God. And the word was made
[1:17:11] flesh and dwelt among us. In the
[1:17:12] beginning it w in the beginning was God.
[1:17:15] And then
[1:17:17] out of God
[1:17:19] came the logos, a part of God that went
[1:17:23] out of God. So a part of God went out of
[1:17:29] God.
[1:17:31] And now
[1:17:32] you can read John 1 and 1:3. In the
[1:17:36] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:17:37] with God and the word was God. And the
[1:17:40] same was the same was in the beginning
[1:17:42] with God and all things were made by him
[1:17:45] and without him was nothing made that
[1:17:48] was made.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; So now we have the process of of
[1:17:53] redemption coming forth. So now the the
[1:17:58] scripture I read as a text to that God
[1:18:02] was in Christ.
[1:18:04] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:18:07] unto himself.
[1:18:10] Here's a phrase I'd like you to
[1:18:11] remember.
[1:18:13] Manifested
[1:18:15] but not yet revealed.
[1:18:18] Manifested.
[1:18:20] Now you are all believers here on a
[1:18:23] Wednesday evening. I'm sure of the
[1:18:25] message.
[1:18:26] God has manifested himself.
[1:18:30] And that's not that's not where the
[1:18:32] difficulty comes.
[1:18:34] God manifests freely himself. He
[1:18:37] manifests himself. He reveals himself.
[1:18:40] He displays his fatherhood. He shows his
[1:18:43] attributes. He He does it in the
[1:18:45] clearest way. He speaks it in his word.
[1:18:49] Where the difficulty is for us
[1:18:52] is to have a personal
[1:18:55] revelation
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; from God that that is God.
[1:19:06] You know, I'll put it this way.
[1:19:08] Sometimes we have difficulty maybe with
[1:19:11] another brother or another sister
[1:19:14] or another family or another situation
[1:19:17] or we may have as individuals we have or
[1:19:21] maybe something that we have that
[1:19:24] presents us with a challenge or we
[1:19:27] struggle with it.
[1:19:31] And we need to be very very observant
[1:19:33] and very
[1:19:36] uh careful because I I I will suggest to
[1:19:40] you that it may well be God
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; dealing in that very situation or
[1:19:48] dealing through that very person or
[1:19:51] bringing you into a specific type of
[1:19:55] situation that may well be God and you
[1:19:58] haven't caught on to it yet.
[1:20:03] David got the revelation when that enemy
[1:20:06] spat in his face.
[1:20:09] His his warrior that was with him.
[1:20:12] Faithful warrior
[1:20:15] protecting his king. Was he a believer?
[1:20:18] Absolutely he was a believer. Did he
[1:20:20] believe David was an anointed?
[1:20:21] Absolutely he believed he was anointed.
[1:20:23] Was he there to do his job? He was
[1:20:25] standing at his post of duty. I'm not
[1:20:26] going to let that man spit in my lord's
[1:20:29] face. I'll take his head off.
[1:20:32] He thought that was the will of God.
[1:20:34] David said, you know, don't do it. God
[1:20:38] told him to do it.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; One
[1:20:44] and it had Oh, stay with me, friends.
[1:20:49] When that man spat in in his face,
[1:20:54] that was actually a manifestation
[1:20:58] of God
[1:21:01] because it was reflecting what was going
[1:21:03] to happen to his son.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So they both saw the manifestation
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; but only one got the revelation.
[1:21:19] That's very deep,
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; believe it or not.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Because if anything has taken place
[1:21:25] since brother Brandham's message when he
[1:21:28] was here and the first pull, the second
[1:21:31] pull and the opening of the word, we
[1:21:33] could say that this was the in the
[1:21:35] clearest terms the manifestation
[1:21:38] God in the revealing of the son of man.
[1:21:41] The manifestation of God. Only a handful
[1:21:45] got the revelation
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; that it was God.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Now in both the Old Testament and the
[1:21:57] New Testament,
[1:22:00] the word manifest describes God's
[1:22:03] revelation of himself
[1:22:06] or his purposes in the world.
[1:22:09] God and his purposes are hidden from the
[1:22:12] unbelieving and revealed to his children
[1:22:16] but un but but not revealed to sinful
[1:22:19] men, sinful humans.
[1:22:21] The type the word that God was manifest
[1:22:25] yet many who saw the manifestation
[1:22:29] did not recognize that it was God. these
[1:22:33] in other words they did not receive a
[1:22:35] personal revelation that it was God. So
[1:22:38] now I want to just describe in the next
[1:22:41] few minutes the various groups that saw
[1:22:44] the manifestation.
[1:22:47] They saw the manifestation but they
[1:22:49] could not distinguish or identify what
[1:22:51] it was they were looking at. Jesus was
[1:22:54] God manifested in the flesh. The
[1:22:57] scripture tells us that. And the people
[1:22:59] saw the manifestation
[1:23:01] but no revelation. His life was was God
[1:23:05] being manifested. Yet it was not
[1:23:08] revealed to them as it was to Peter. I
[1:23:12] have I have so many so many examples of
[1:23:15] it. I just have to throw a few out. The
[1:23:17] thief on the cross saw the same
[1:23:20] manifestation
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; that the apostles had. The apostles saw
[1:23:26] that was God manifesting himself in his
[1:23:29] sacrifice offering his son. They were
[1:23:32] actually looking at the mercy seat in
[1:23:35] full view.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's what was manifested. They
[1:23:39] actually saw God's only begotten son
[1:23:43] paying the full price of of sin. They
[1:23:46] were actually seeing the manifestation
[1:23:48] was that that the seed of the woman was
[1:23:52] crushing the serpent's head.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; That was the manifestation.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; But that was not the revelation.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what was happening.
[1:24:05] They were in confusion. They thought the
[1:24:07] kingdom is crushing. And the and the
[1:24:09] thief on the cross
[1:24:12] said, "Lord,
[1:24:14] remember me when you come into your
[1:24:16] kingdom." He saw him as a king entering
[1:24:20] into his kingdom. And he had a
[1:24:22] revelation that even the apostles didn't
[1:24:24] have as yet.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; In the message, Christ the mystery of
[1:24:28] God revealed you also. And I'm bringing
[1:24:30] this so that it will, you know, it will,
[1:24:33] I think, tweak on your thoughts when you
[1:24:36] come to the line. Brother Brandon quite
[1:24:38] early comes into it and he goes to Luke
[1:24:41] the 24th chapter with the two men on the
[1:24:43] way to Emmas.
[1:24:46] As far as the manifestation is
[1:24:48] concerned, they were looking at the
[1:24:50] resurrected Christ.
[1:24:52] That's what was manifested.
[1:24:55] Resurrected Christ in another realm, in
[1:24:59] another body. They were looking at the
[1:25:01] manifestation. but that Christ had to go
[1:25:05] back to the scripture and make
[1:25:07] references to himself in the scripture
[1:25:10] in in a in in an attempt to get them to
[1:25:14] a point of revelation of what it was
[1:25:16] they were looking at.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; They were walking with the manifested
[1:25:26] word of God. They were walking with God
[1:25:31] manifesting himself right beside them.
[1:25:34] It was God.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; They didn't. They thought it was a
[1:25:39] stranger.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; As good believers,
[1:25:45] as fervent fervent believers, it could
[1:25:47] be you.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; It could be me.
[1:25:52] It could be even in the rapture that we
[1:25:55] so anticipate
[1:25:57] that there will be a similar event. And
[1:26:00] that's really my purpose of preaching
[1:26:01] this. We're in such anticipation
[1:26:05] of the rapture.
[1:26:07] I can tell you that I personally believe
[1:26:10] that it will unfold in a way
[1:26:13] that it will take just a divine
[1:26:15] intervention of God to reveal it to us
[1:26:18] and say, "Wake up. You're in the
[1:26:21] rapture.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; You're right in the middle of the
[1:26:24] change.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; You could see the manifestation, but it
[1:26:32] will take the divine grace of God to
[1:26:35] reveal to you what is happening. I can
[1:26:37] show it all through the scripture.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; When Moses came out, when he came out to
[1:26:45] the people and the scripture says that
[1:26:48] God, this same Moses that the people
[1:26:52] refused, God made a deliverer. He was a
[1:26:56] deliverer. He was manifesting him, God
[1:26:59] was manifesting himself as a deliverer.
[1:27:02] The people didn't catch it. They did not
[1:27:05] catch it. They refused him and they
[1:27:08] rejected him. And yet it was God being
[1:27:11] manifested.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Various groups, I said, saw the
[1:27:25] manifestation
[1:27:27] in John 7 and 28. You won't turn to it,
[1:27:30] but I'll just read it. Then cried Jesus
[1:27:32] in the temple as he taught, saying,
[1:27:36] notice now closely,
[1:27:38] Jesus cried in the temple as he taught,
[1:27:41] saying, You both know me and you know
[1:27:46] whence I am,
[1:27:48] and I am not come of myself, but he that
[1:27:51] sent me is true, whom you know not. So
[1:27:56] he said, "So you know me and you know
[1:27:58] whence I am where I came from
[1:28:02] and I am not I'm not come of myself, but
[1:28:05] he that sent me is true whom you know
[1:28:08] not." But in John 8 and 19, Jesus puts
[1:28:12] it this way. Then said they unto him,
[1:28:16] "Where is thy father?"
[1:28:18] Jesus answered, "You neither know me nor
[1:28:22] my father. If you had known me, you
[1:28:25] surely would know my father also.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So in one place he says, you know me and
[1:28:30] you know where I'm from, but you don't
[1:28:32] know who sent me.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; And then in another place in the eth
[1:28:36] chapter, because in the eighth chapter
[1:28:37] there gets a great debate. If you read
[1:28:39] the eighth chapter, the great debate is
[1:28:42] about who has who is a father. And that
[1:28:44] is where Jesus finally told them, you're
[1:28:46] of your father, the devil,
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and his deeds you do. For he was a
[1:28:51] murderer from the beginning. In other
[1:28:53] words, they were an expression of that
[1:28:54] their father because they were trying to
[1:28:56] kill him and Jesus was an expression of
[1:28:59] his father. And there he told exactly
[1:29:01] where the two seeds come from.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; The serpent seed is so evident in the
[1:29:05] eighth chapter of John. And that is
[1:29:08] where Jesus said and they said unto him,
[1:29:10] "Where is your father?" He said, "You
[1:29:12] don't know me
[1:29:14] nor my father. And if you had known me,
[1:29:18] you should have known my father also."
[1:29:21] So they didn't know him. They that was
[1:29:25] one group. They didn't understand him at
[1:29:27] all. And the and the message of Queen of
[1:29:30] Sheba, Queen of the South rather, the
[1:29:33] prophet says, "If the mighty works had
[1:29:35] been done," and he stops and breaks. If
[1:29:39] the mighty works had been done, he says,
[1:29:41] "And you see the works of God had been
[1:29:45] manifested,
[1:29:47] but the people turned it down and they
[1:29:50] called him Bill Bub."
[1:29:52] So he said, "So they saw the work
[1:29:54] manifested.
[1:29:56] They saw it manifested."
[1:30:00] You have too.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; I have too.
[1:30:04] And because because God reveals himself,
[1:30:06] we can prove that. We can prove God sent
[1:30:08] a prophet. We can prove it by the
[1:30:10] scripture. We can prove it by the works.
[1:30:12] We can prove it by infallible proofs
[1:30:15] that God has done all these things. And
[1:30:17] you can I find all kinds of people agree
[1:30:19] with it. But you know what the you know
[1:30:21] what the dilemma is.
[1:30:24] They're able to agree with all of that
[1:30:27] but unable to identify God right beside
[1:30:32] them.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; God right in the service.
[1:30:36] Yes, sir.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; How do you know? But what God isn't
[1:30:40] trying to say something to you
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; this evening, not brother Ed, but God
[1:30:51] trying to prepare you.
[1:30:54] Maybe God's trying to tell you
[1:30:55] something. You thought that you thought
[1:30:57] that was a a bad thing happening to you.
[1:31:02] It's me.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; It's God that's allowed it. It's me
[1:31:06] that's allowed it. Do you know why? He
[1:31:09] loves the fatherhood and he wants real
[1:31:12] sons and real daughters and whatever he
[1:31:16] needs to do, he's going to do that to
[1:31:18] bring them through to sunship.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Because he loves fatherhood.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; You maybe have to say hold him back
[1:31:32] because I don't want to get on to but
[1:31:34] this is where I'm coming Sunday. Lord
[1:31:35] willing.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now the resurrection took
[1:31:41] place and was manifested but not yet
[1:31:43] revealed to the disciples." It's
[1:31:46] important for us to
[1:31:49] know not only what we believe. Say, "Oh,
[1:31:52] I believe the serpent seat. Believe the
[1:31:54] oneness of the Godhead. Been baptized in
[1:31:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:31:57] believe all that." But it's important to
[1:31:58] also know why we believe it.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe what we believe? Not
[1:32:04] only what do we believe, but why do we
[1:32:06] believe it?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm saying some of these things
[1:32:10] and just dropping it off perhaps
[1:32:12] abruptly.
[1:32:14] Now, God was in Christ. I'm just going
[1:32:17] to give this next little portion and I'm
[1:32:19] going to close. God was in Christ when
[1:32:23] and it was in Abraham.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Would you agree with that?
[1:32:28] F follow this very very closely because
[1:32:30] there's
[1:32:32] uh
[1:32:34] some things you need God to help you
[1:32:36] with.
[1:32:38] God was in Christ when he manifested a
[1:32:40] portion of himself through Abraham. He
[1:32:43] says, "But Abraham, when he found out
[1:32:45] that Lot had been taken, that was part
[1:32:49] of Abraham's possession." What a picture
[1:32:52] of Christ.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hang on to it. What a picture of Christ
[1:32:56] in Abraham there coming after the enemy
[1:33:00] had captured everything and Christ come
[1:33:03] and brought us back again.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That's Christ and Abraham. What a
[1:33:08] picture of Christ and Abraham. But like
[1:33:11] you notice the manifestation
[1:33:15] and the revelation. They differ.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; The manifestation
[1:33:21] and the revelation can differ. Amen.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; And the Lord appeared. Who appeared?
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Who appeared?
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord appeared to Abram
[1:33:36] in the plains of Mammer as he sat in the
[1:33:39] tent door in the heat of the day. And he
[1:33:41] lift up his eyes. This is how the Lord
[1:33:43] appeared. He lift up his eyes and
[1:33:45] looked. And lo, three men stood by him.
[1:33:49] And when he saw them, he ran to meet
[1:33:52] them from the tent door and bowed
[1:33:54] himself toward the ground. That was the
[1:33:57] manifestation.
[1:33:59] But the revelation said, "And my Lord."
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; So the manifestation was three men
[1:34:06] coming. But the revelation was that it
[1:34:08] was one.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; So the manifestation
[1:34:13] and the revelation can quite differ.
[1:34:19] You might go back to brother Deoka's
[1:34:21] service and many times they've spoken
[1:34:24] here also and you hear the prophet
[1:34:27] saying in the fifth chapter of
[1:34:29] revelation when uh the angel said weep
[1:34:32] not John for the lion of the tribe of
[1:34:35] Judah hath prevailed and he turns to see
[1:34:38] that manifestation but the revelation
[1:34:41] was it was a lamb
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; because it was the merging of those
[1:34:47] offices
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; which I don't want to get into that now.
[1:34:51] So the manifestation
[1:34:52] and the revelation can differ
[1:34:56] now in a message proving his word is a
[1:34:59] powerful powerful message towards the
[1:35:03] end. Brother Brandham says things about
[1:35:04] the son of man and remember when you run
[1:35:07] into son of man I hope you'll see it
[1:35:08] differently from now on is when you hear
[1:35:11] and see the son of man you'll think he
[1:35:13] loved fatherhood.
[1:35:16] That's why Luke 17:30 happened. That's
[1:35:18] why you're living under that is because
[1:35:20] God loved fatherhood. That's why you're
[1:35:23] enjoying what you're enjoying because
[1:35:24] God love fatherhood.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So he wanted to reveal
[1:35:30] his son, the son of man. Now you see
[1:35:33] where brother Brandham's position was.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; What an office.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; What a place. What a high calling
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; to take a man on the face of the earth
[1:35:48] born of a woman and born in sin. But
[1:35:52] salvation is so powerful and so complete
[1:35:54] that God himself could come and unveil
[1:35:58] himself
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; through that vessel and declare his word
[1:36:02] and many saw the manifestation. Few got
[1:36:04] the revelation but thank God some have
[1:36:06] got the remen.
[1:36:09] [Applause]
[1:36:10] Thank God. And you got the revelation
[1:36:13] because God loved fatherhood. He wanted
[1:36:15] to be a father.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Perhaps some here have not yet been a
[1:36:24] father and you're married
[1:36:28] and you're not a father yet. Multiply
[1:36:31] that by 10 million times
[1:36:34] and still you haven't even come into the
[1:36:38] even near what was in God
[1:36:42] because God had life in him. God had
[1:36:44] redemption in him. God had healing in
[1:36:47] him. God had deliverance in him. God had
[1:36:50] power in him. God had power to create in
[1:36:53] him. How will I do this? I'll send the
[1:36:55] anointing out from me. Hallelujah. And
[1:36:57] that anointing will eventually be my
[1:36:59] son.
[1:37:00] And that is why the great secret the
[1:37:03] great secret I have to drop this in so
[1:37:05] you'll ponder the great secret that was
[1:37:08] in in God's mind was when that anointing
[1:37:11] had gone and moved down down through
[1:37:14] Abraham through Joseph reflected through
[1:37:16] Isaac reflected through David through
[1:37:18] Samuel being rejected through David the
[1:37:21] king through Solomon and and on down and
[1:37:23] on down until finally it came into one
[1:37:27] man. Hallelujah.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ in its perfection. And God
[1:37:31] had a son. Had a son. And that and that
[1:37:34] son was going to be the beginning of the
[1:37:36] new creation.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; And that was a creative power.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Creative power.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Because that anointing was a creative
[1:37:44] power. And the apex,
[1:37:47] the apex, the pinnacle of that anointing
[1:37:51] was when God came in his personal
[1:37:54] presence
[1:37:56] to the earth.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; And he did it in Jesus.
[1:38:03] And he did it in our time.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10 is his personal presence
[1:38:13] coming. And that is why it is such a
[1:38:15] focal. That is why it's such a vortex.
[1:38:18] That's why it's so disputed is because
[1:38:22] people they saw the manifestation but
[1:38:24] didn't catch the revelation. That is the
[1:38:27] apex, the pinnacle of the secret. And
[1:38:30] that's why the prophet calls it the
[1:38:31] great secret in the back part of God's
[1:38:34] mind was his personal presence coming.
[1:38:37] And that's why it was silence in heaven.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the angels
[1:38:43] couldn't know. That's why even Jesus as
[1:38:46] a son on earth, he couldn't know. It was
[1:38:48] too great a secret.
[1:38:52] [Applause]
[1:38:59] But I want to drop it in.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; And God would have a people on earth
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; who would actually have caught the
[1:39:07] revelation of what it was. They say
[1:39:10] that's not just a manifestation, but
[1:39:12] it's God's personal presence.
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; The great secret is unfolding.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; And then they become aware
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; that's God in me.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; That's not some theory. That's not just
[1:39:29] some doctrine. That's not just some
[1:39:32] manifestation that the denominational
[1:39:35] world is all caught up with
[1:39:36] manifestation. But this group got a
[1:39:38] revelation.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends. Give me the
[1:39:44] manifest. Give me the revelation. You
[1:39:46] can have all the manifestation you want.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Give me the revelation.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Whether you see anything or not, give me
[1:39:53] the revelation that that which is in me
[1:39:55] is God.
[1:39:58] And that's why the Apostle Paul said
[1:40:00] this great mystery among the Gentiles
[1:40:04] which is Christ
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; in you the hope of glory.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:40:14] the anointing
[1:40:16] in you.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And I'll just read this and close
[1:40:24] and it's proving his word. But he says,
[1:40:26] "Now remember
[1:40:28] that was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[1:40:31] back there."
[1:40:35] Wasn't Jesus talking to Abraham back
[1:40:37] there? I said I was going to make a
[1:40:39] distinction between Christ and Jesus.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; He said that was not Jesus talking to
[1:40:46] Abraham there that could discern the
[1:40:49] thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him.
[1:40:53] That was not Jesus. He had not yet been
[1:40:56] born. But it was a man in human flesh
[1:40:59] that Abraham called Elohim the Almighty.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; That is why brother Brandham says if you
[1:41:05] make me Jesus, you make me antichrist.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; But he did not say that he could not be
[1:41:13] an anointed one.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And furthermore dispense it to you and
[1:41:20] say you are Messiah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And he had his portion and you have your
[1:41:28] portion. And pray that God would give
[1:41:30] you revelation. I don't need to have
[1:41:33] signs and wonders and manifestation. I
[1:41:35] need a revelation and it's God in me.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; How's that for Wednesday?
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:52] Hallelujah.
[1:41:54] I think we ought to stand and sing, I
[1:41:56] got the life of God in me.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; If you haven't got the revelation, I
[1:42:00] pray that God will give you the
[1:42:01] revelation.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I got the life of God in me.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just some, you know, emotional
[1:42:13] thing. It's a reality. That's his word.
[1:42:18] You believe it?
[1:42:20] All right.
[1:42:24] The life of God.
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:30] I got the life of God.
[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:42:35] I got the
[1:42:41] I got the life of God in me.

[1:42:57] I've got his life
[1:43:01] and his ability.
[1:43:03] I've got the life of God in me.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Say, who do you say this is?
[1:43:14] God
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; in his body. God in his bride.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to take what Apostle
[1:43:20] Paul says, what the prophet God says it,
[1:43:22] God in me.
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You have God in you, you won't
[1:43:30] necessarily be well thought of or well
[1:43:31] spoken of or anything else, but you need
[1:43:34] to know who it is.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God grant it. I've got the
[1:43:41] life of
[1:43:46] I
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:55] and his
[1:43:58] life of God.
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:03] I was just praying. Thank you. Father,
[1:44:05] we're so thankful. Your word is so full,
[1:44:08] so rich, invigorating for us. It gives
[1:44:11] us such zeal and courage to go on. And I
[1:44:15] pray, Lord, any heaviness or weight that
[1:44:17] the enemy would try to put on, oh God,
[1:44:19] let it be broken free, let it be cast
[1:44:21] off. I pray that you'll give revelation,
[1:44:24] revelation, the spirit of revelation to
[1:44:27] your dear people. Oh, how we love them
[1:44:30] and how we as a people love you, Lord.
[1:44:34] Father,
[1:44:35] our father,
[1:44:37] how you so touched me today just for me
[1:44:41] to be able to lift my head, my eyes to
[1:44:43] you and say, "My father,
[1:44:46] you love fatherhood. You reveal yourself
[1:44:49] in your son. And now in your children,
[1:44:52] now in your bride." That's why we are
[1:44:54] what we are. That's why the bride is
[1:44:57] what she is. That's why we're feeding on
[1:44:59] what we're feeding on. That's why our
[1:45:01] ministers preach what they preach.
[1:45:04] because you love fatherhood and you've
[1:45:06] revealed yourself to us. I ask you to
[1:45:09] bless this people. Bless them. Bless
[1:45:10] them, Father, for having come and taken
[1:45:13] this evening. And now may their
[1:45:16] fellowship be sweet. May their
[1:45:17] conversation be uplifting. And may we
[1:45:20] say nice things about one another and to
[1:45:23] one another and pray for one another.
[1:45:25] Dismiss us with your grace and bring us
[1:45:28] again, Lord, to prayer service Friday.
[1:45:31] the Lord's the Lord's day, the whole
[1:45:34] day. Let it be a day that will be so
[1:45:36] uplifting. Come amongst us, God, and do
[1:45:38] what you would be pleased to do. Let us
[1:45:41] come with no special format, Lord, and
[1:45:44] no special formalities, but come in
[1:45:47] amongst us, oh God, and do what would be
[1:45:49] pleasing to you. And may you get glory,
[1:45:52] great glory to your name. In Jesus
[1:45:54] Christ we ask it. Amen.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say, God bless you. Thank
[1:46:00] you for your kind attention. Thank you
[1:46:02] for saying sometimes um uh amen that
[1:46:07] said scum. And I was actually secretly
[1:46:09] praying that you would kind of hold me
[1:46:11] back because I didn't want to blow my
[1:46:12] wad. You know, that's that's an
[1:46:15] old-timer's phrase. But God bless you.
[1:46:17] You're all dismissed in Jesus name. Our
[1:46:20] brother Jay is here for prayer. All
[1:46:23] right. Maybe let let's just sing
