[0:00] all right question is hell and the lake
[0:03] that burneth with fire and brimstone the
[0:07] same no hell translation in the Bible I
[0:10] believe the scholar sitting here want to
[0:13] honor that our brother Iverson sitting
[0:16] here and brother n and many of these
[0:18] Brethren who are really theologians the
[0:21] word
[0:22] translated had means the grave is that
[0:26] right the Greek word for the grave but
[0:29] the lake of far is something else
[0:31] because over in Revelations both Hades
[0:34] and all was cast into the Lake of Fire
[0:37] all right now let's see uh is the Lake
[0:42] of Fire hell Eternal no sir anything
[0:46] that was created is not
[0:49] Eternal if anybody ever tells you that
[0:51] you go to burn in an eternal hell I want
[0:52] the scripture for there's no such a
[0:55] thing as that hell was created for the
[0:58] devil and his angels for the Antichrist
[1:01] and his people that was the devil
[1:03] incarnate devil is created for that to
[1:06] destroy out of everything there is the
[1:09] whole world and everything else there's
[1:11] only one thing Eternal and that's
[1:13] God before there was a Adam or electrons
[1:17] or before there was even Cosmic like
[1:19] electrons or anything he was God he's a
[1:23] Creator and that's the only way you can
[1:25] be Eternal is to receive eternal life
[1:29] that re word there I think is Zoe isn't
[1:31] that right Zoe Zoe and then that that
[1:34] life God imparts to you as the father
[1:38] your father imparts his life to you the
[1:41] revelation of St John the
[1:43] Divine chapter 20 and I saw a great
[1:47] white throne and him that sat on it from
[1:49] whose face the earth and the heaven fled
[1:51] away and there was found no place for
[1:53] them and I saw the dead small and great
[1:56] stand before God and the books were
[1:59] opened and another book was opened which
[2:01] is The Book of Life and the dead were
[2:03] judged out of those things which were
[2:05] written in the books according to their
[2:07] works and the Sea gave up the dead which
[2:10] were in it and death and Hell delivered
[2:12] up the dead which were in them and they
[2:14] were judged every man according to their
[2:16] works and death and hell were cast into
[2:18] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[2:21] death and whosoever was not found
[2:23] written in the Book of Life was cast
[2:25] into the Lake of
[2:26] Fire thou son of man the children of thy
[2:30] people still are talking against theee
[2:31] by the walls and in the doors of the
[2:33] houses and speak one to another everyone
[2:36] to his brother saying come I pray you
[2:40] and hear what is the word that cometh
[2:41] forth from the Lord and they come unto
[2:44] thee as the people cometh and they sit
[2:46] before thee as my people and they hear
[2:48] thy words but they will not do them for
[2:51] with their mouth they show much love but
[2:53] their heart goeth after their
[2:54] covetousness and lo Thou Art unto them
[2:58] as a very lovely song of one that hath a
[3:00] pleasant voice and can play well on an
[3:02] instrument for they hear thy words but
[3:05] they do them not and when this cometh to
[3:08] pass Lo it will come then shall they
[3:11] know that a prophet hath been among them
