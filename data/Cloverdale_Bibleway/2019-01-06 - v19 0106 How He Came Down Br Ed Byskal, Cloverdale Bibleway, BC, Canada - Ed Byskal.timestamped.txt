[0:03] Sometimes I soar,
[0:07] sometimes I sore like an eagle in the
[0:13] sky.
[0:15] Among the peace my soul
[0:19] can be found.
[0:23] But an unexpected
[0:26] storm. It may drive me from the height.
[0:32] It may bring me low, but it can never
[0:36] bring me down.
[0:40] Oh, for I know I know the master of the
[0:46] way.
[0:49] I know the maker I know the maker of
[0:54] rain.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; He can calm the storm and make the sun
[1:04] to shine again. And I know I know the
[1:10] master of Amen. Let's sing that chorus
[1:13] again. I know the master. Yes, I know.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; I know the master of way.
[1:25] Oh, I know.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; I know the maker of grace.
[1:34] I know he can calm the storm and make
[1:38] the sun to shine again.
[1:43] I know I know the master of the wind.
[1:52] Oh father
[1:54] in heaven,
[1:57] we love you.
[2:00] Oh Lord, we lift your name in all the
[2:06] earth
[2:09] and may your kingdom be established in
[2:15] our praises.
[2:19] as your people
[2:22] declare your mighty
[2:24] works.
[2:26] Blessed be the Lord
[2:31] God
[2:33] Almighty
[2:37] who was and is and is to come.
[2:44] Blessed be the Lord
[2:49] God
[2:51] Almighty
[2:55] who lives forever
[3:00] more.
[3:02] Amen. Let's sing the verse again. Father
[3:04] in heaven, Father
[3:07] in heaven, we love you.
[3:12] Lord, we lift your name in all
[3:17] the earth.
[3:20] Oh, may your kingdom
[3:26] in our praises
[3:30] as your people
[3:33] declare your mighty works.
[3:37] Blessed be the Lord
[3:42] God
[3:44] Almighty
[3:48] who was
[3:50] and is
[3:52] to God.
[3:55] Blessed be the Lord
[3:59] God
[4:01] Almighty.
[4:05] Oh, who lives forever
[4:10] more. Blessed be.
[4:16] Oh God
[4:19] Almighty,
[4:23] who was
[4:25] and is to God.
[4:30] Blessed be the Lord
[4:35] God
[4:36] Almighty
[4:41] who lives forever
[4:46] more.
[4:49] You deserve the glory
[4:55] and the honor.
[4:58] Then let's just worship him together.
[5:00] saints as we lift our hands in worship.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we praise your holy name, you
[5:11] deserve the glory
[5:16] and the honor.
[5:21] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[5:27] as we praise your holy name. For you are
[5:33] great.
[5:35] You do miracles
[5:38] so great.
[5:40] There is no one else like you.
[5:48] Oh, there is no one else like you. For
[5:53] you are great.
[5:56] You do miracles
[5:59] so great.
[6:02] There is no one else like you,
[6:08] Lord. There is no one else like
[6:16] you. Can we stand as we sing the verse?
[6:19] You deserve the glory
[6:24] and the honor.
[6:27] Amen. That's why we've come here saints
[6:29] to worship him this morning
[6:32] to worship
[6:35] as we praise your holy name
[6:44] and all
[6:46] the on earth.
[6:49] Lord, we lift our hands to worship
[6:55] as we praise your holy
[6:59] name.
[7:02] Oh, you do mirales.
[7:06] You're so great, Lord. There's no one
[7:09] else like you.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; There's none like you, Lord. There is no
[7:17] one else like you. You are great.
[7:23] You do miracles
[7:25] so great.
[7:28] There is no one else like you. None like
[7:34] you, Lord. There is no one else like
[7:41] you. You are great. Oh, for you are
[7:46] great.
[7:48] You do miracles
[7:51] so great.
[7:53] There is no one else.
[7:57] There is none like you, Lord.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; There is no one else like you. For you
[8:06] are great.
[8:08] You do miracles
[8:11] so great.
[8:13] There is no one else like you.
[8:20] There is no one else like you.
[8:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Truly, there's no one
[8:32] like our God, saints. Amen. And just
[8:35] even the way we were able to bring in
[8:36] the new year together just in worship
[8:38] and praise, remembering the things he's
[8:40] done. It's wonderful to serve a living
[8:43] God that inhabits the praises of his
[8:44] people. When we come in here, we lay
[8:46] aside everything of the week and we've
[8:48] just come to give of ourselves back to
[8:49] him now that he might move in our midst.
[8:52] Amen. God bless you this morning. I'm
[8:53] going to ask the brothers if they would
[8:55] just come and prepare for the morning
[8:57] offering. Amen. Our brother Tim, we
[8:59] haven't heard from you in a while. Maybe
[9:00] you could just open the service for us
[9:02] in a word of prayer. We do have several
[9:04] prayer requests we want to remember. Our
[9:07] sister Eleanor Drake just asking that we
[9:08] would please pray diligently this
[9:11] morning for our dear sister Helen
[9:12] Bisberger. She is scheduled for a very
[9:15] serious colon surgery this morning at
[9:17] 11:00 a.m. It's very high risk. And
[9:19] they're just asking that God would
[9:21] intervene on her behalf. Amen. And do a
[9:24] mighty work in her life. He is still a
[9:26] miracle working God. Amen. Sister
[9:28] Roxan's asking we please remember her
[9:30] mother, sister Florence Bessie in prayer
[9:32] as she is at home sick today.
[9:34] Also, another very urgent prayer request
[9:36] from our brother Jose for our brother
[9:38] Abel Gutierrez. Some of you might
[9:40] remember he came and visited for a
[9:42] service and his sons were with us for a
[9:44] couple months. Um he's had a very
[9:46] serious emergency surgery about 8 hours
[9:48] long and the doctors didn't have very
[9:50] high hopes but it went well and now
[9:52] they're just asking that the Lord would
[9:54] allow a swift recovery. Amen. and just
[9:56] continue to minister to him and the
[9:58] family during this time. Amen. Brothers,
[10:00] if you would come for the morning
[10:01] offering, maybe we can just sing
[10:02] together. Only believe, only believe,
[10:04] all things are possible. Only believe.
[10:07] As we go to prayer now,
[10:10] only
[10:12] believe.
[10:17] only
[10:19] believe
[10:23] for all things
[10:26] are possible.
[10:30] Holy
[10:33] beings.
[10:44] Ally
[10:46] be
[10:50] all things are possible.
[10:57] Holy.
[10:59] Amen. Let's confess back to him now.
[11:01] Lord, I believe. Oh Lord,
[11:06] I believe with all my heart. Lord,
[11:13] I believe
[11:17] that all things
[11:20] are possible.
[11:24] Lord, I
[11:30] Oh Lord,
[11:33] I believe.
[11:38] Lord,
[11:40] I believe.
[11:44] For all things
[11:47] are possible.
[11:51] Lord, I
[11:54] believe.
[11:58] Amen. Let's bow our heads as we hold our
[12:00] requests before the Lord.
[12:04] Wonderful heavenly father.
[12:08] Lord, as I stood there, you and we sang
[12:12] only believe, you laid it on my heart to
[12:15] sing, Lord, I believe.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; And the same spirit that was moving a
[12:20] few feet over moved on the song leader
[12:23] &gt;&gt; to sing, Lord, I believe. You had us
[12:26] made our confession this morning, Lord.
[12:29] And we confessed in song and we
[12:31] confessed in our prayers, Lord. We
[12:33] believe.
[12:35] We believe that all things are possible.
[12:38] We believe that you are here in the
[12:40] midst of your people. That you are a
[12:41] living God who keeps your word, whose
[12:45] atonement has paid for every redemptive
[12:48] blessing. And Lord, we've come this
[12:50] morning before you to present ourselves
[12:53] in your presence and to lay hold on the
[12:56] redemptive blessings by faith. Lord, we
[12:59] confess, Father, we believe. We believe
[13:02] you're here for every need. We believe,
[13:04] Father, that you're moving through the
[13:06] midst of your people this morning. And
[13:08] whatever it might be, a hand raised,
[13:10] might be a burden on our heart, might be
[13:12] something natural, financial, spiritual,
[13:15] Lord, physical, it doesn't matter with
[13:18] you, oh God. You know all of our needs
[13:21] and you're the God that meets all of our
[13:23] needs according to your riches in glory.
[13:26] And there's been some written requests
[13:28] this morning, some specific needs. Our
[13:30] sister Helen, Lord, has a need. And
[13:33] Lord, we're holding her up this morning.
[13:36] She has a surgery scheduled. Lord,
[13:39] Father, even now as she heads towards
[13:42] that surgery, Lord, may your mighty
[13:45] presence overshadow her. Lord, may the
[13:48] doctors and the nurses know that there's
[13:50] something special about this woman. That
[13:53] Lord, you're governing over her life,
[13:55] governing their hands, allowing things
[13:58] to go exactly correctly according to
[14:00] your word. But even as we know, Lord,
[14:02] the doctors can cut and sew. They can
[14:05] administer, but you alone are the
[14:07] healer. And Lord, we ask that you'll
[14:09] give her a mighty healer along with our
[14:11] brother Abel. Lord, who's needing a
[14:13] healing, oh God, his surgery went well.
[14:16] The doctors did a good job, but Lord,
[14:19] you are his healer. Lord, may you go by
[14:22] his way and raise him up, Father, we
[14:24] pray. And also remembering Florence,
[14:26] Sister Florence Bessie, Lord, this
[14:28] morning as she's in need, Father. Lord,
[14:31] may you touch her mortal body, every
[14:33] physical need, Lord. We're praying that
[14:36] you'll just even move through this
[14:37] congregation, rebuking every demon of
[14:40] sickness, Lord, raising up every
[14:42] downtrodden person, loosing every
[14:45] captive and breaking every chain. Lord,
[14:48] we're claiming your redemptive
[14:49] blessings. And Lord, we've come this
[14:52] morning not just to praise you, not just
[14:54] to make our requests, but we've come to
[14:57] sit at your feet, to hear your word of
[14:59] life, for you alone have the words of
[15:02] eternal life. So may you use your
[15:05] servant once again this morning, our
[15:07] pastor. Lord, may you minister to our
[15:10] souls through him. For you know each and
[15:13] everyone what we have need of and we
[15:15] know that you are directing and help
[15:17] brother Biscoll to be a good follower of
[15:20] your divine direction. And Lord, we
[15:23] commit our offerings to you this
[15:25] morning. We lift them before you oh God.
[15:27] May you receive them as worship unto
[15:30] you. Lord, we've begun a new year. We
[15:33] thank you for all that you've done. And
[15:36] Lord, may this year be started out
[15:38] right. And may our attitude and our
[15:40] approach to all things, even in
[15:42] offerings, be acceptable in your
[15:44] presence. We commit this service to you
[15:47] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. As you have your
[15:54] seats this morning, as we take up the
[15:56] morning offering, let's sing that song
[15:58] we love. Oh, what a friend that walks
[16:00] beside me. Who hold my hand, holds my
[16:03] hand.
[16:05] Oh, what a friend
[16:11] who walks beside me.
[16:16] To hold my hand
[16:21] and to save thee, guide me.
[16:27] David is on.
[16:31] He will always hide me.
[16:36] Oh, what a friend
[16:41] he is to. Aren't you thankful knows the
[16:44] way, saints, for he knows the way.
[16:51] My road is winding.
[16:56] I know he can see around
[17:01] my pathways
[17:03] bending.
[17:05] He will take
[17:07] through
[17:12] his ending.
[17:15] Oh, what a bread
[17:20] is to be. Let's sing that first verse
[17:22] again.
[17:24] Oh, what a friend
[17:29] who walks beside me
[17:33] to hold my hand
[17:38] and safely
[17:40] guide me.
[17:43] Save his arms.
[17:48] He always hide me.
[17:52] Oh, what a friend
[17:57] he is to me.
[18:01] Amen. We're going to sing that second
[18:03] verse again, but we just want to invite
[18:04] our brother Richard Drake to come. The
[18:06] Sunday school has an offering
[18:08] presentation they'd like to do. So, may
[18:10] Brother Richard, you could come at this
[18:11] time as we sing another verse or two of
[18:13] this song. Amen. He knows the way.
[18:16] He knows the way.
[18:21] My road is winding.
[18:26] Yes, he can see around.
[18:31] My pathways bending.
[18:35] He'll take me through
[18:40] when day is ending.
[18:45] Oh, what a friend.
[18:56] Good morning. Just uh
[19:01] the um back in the summer of 2018. I was
[19:07] chatting with brother Marko regarding
[19:09] the um the situation in Uganda where the
[19:12] saints in Uganda were having well
[19:14] basically there was a big shortage of
[19:16] Bibles. People didn't have them. So, we
[19:18] kind of thought, is there any way we
[19:19] could maybe get the Sunday school
[19:22] children um on board? They do a
[19:25] missionary offering every single year.
[19:28] And um so I I thought, well, yeah, we
[19:30] can try that. So, during the morning
[19:32] devotion, I had um uh you know, you
[19:36] select little children because you know
[19:38] their families and you know they're not
[19:40] going to get angry at you when you do
[19:41] things like that. So, I had I had
[19:43] brother Hudson come up in front of all
[19:45] the other kids. And I just asked him how
[19:47] many Bibles was in his house. And uh he
[19:50] couldn't give me the exact answer, but
[19:52] over the conversation, we found out that
[19:55] everybody in the house had their own
[19:57] Bible. And then found out that everybody
[19:59] in their house had more than one Bible
[20:02] because they had one they brought to
[20:03] church and one that sat by their bed.
[20:04] And and his dad had lots of Bibles. And
[20:07] so it's like, okay, well, that's a
[20:09] that's pretty much a a North American
[20:12] thing. So we we asked the children then,
[20:14] look, what we want you to do is think
[20:16] about
[20:18] trying to find where you could find, you
[20:21] know, uh, whatever money you can find
[20:24] just around. Uh, and we're going to
[20:26] start when we start in September,
[20:28] whatever comes into that little basket
[20:29] starting in September all the way
[20:31] through to the end of the year that we
[20:33] would put that specifically towards uh
[20:35] buying Bibles for the saints in Uganda.
[20:39] So, you know, when you ask children to
[20:41] do stuff, they get very specific.
[20:45] And um, so starting in September when
[20:47] Sunday school got going, I knew they
[20:49] would have completely forgotten over the
[20:51] summer what we talked about. So, we
[20:53] reiterated again and I told him, you
[20:55] know, try to look for money anywhere you
[20:58] could find it. Uh, the center console of
[21:00] your car, um, returnable bottles, maybe
[21:04] money that's sitting in a change jar,
[21:06] sitting around on top of a dresser
[21:07] you've forgotten about, just look for
[21:09] money. Well, you get these little
[21:11] testimonies from time to time. And um
[21:14] brother Ed and sister Janelle Lamb have
[21:16] a little girl who's six. And she said
[21:20] that when they would get out of the car
[21:22] to go shopping, her daughter would ask
[21:25] her, "Mom, hold my hand. Why do I need
[21:28] to hold your hand? Because then I don't
[21:30] have to worry about where I'm going and
[21:31] I need to look for money."
[21:34] So, what was amazing was when she
[21:38] brought in her little Ziploc bag full of
[21:40] coins, uh, she literally found with the
[21:43] dimes, p pennies, and nickels, and
[21:45] whatever in on store floors and parking
[21:46] lots, she'd found over $10 worth of
[21:49] coins.
[21:51] And that wasn't even for the whole 17
[21:53] weeks that we were doing this. That was
[21:55] just a certain portion of time. And so,
[21:57] you know, a lot of children did a lot of
[21:59] things.
[22:02] By December 16th,
[22:05] we were about $40 short of $600.
[22:10] And I'm thinking that is incredible.
[22:12] Now, we didn't set any goals, but at
[22:14] that point, I said to the children like,
[22:16] "There's two weeks left. There's the
[22:18] week we're here on the 23rd when they
[22:19] sang." I said, "If we could just do that
[22:23] extra $40,
[22:25] it would be so much because then you hit
[22:26] that one that even number. Everything's
[22:28] nice when you have even numbers." And um
[22:30] so I told him, "Hey look, you know, the
[22:32] week that's coming up is Christmas week.
[22:33] So I'm going to give you another
[22:34] suggestion. So why don't you, you know,
[22:37] you're going to be getting together with
[22:38] families, people are coming and going,
[22:40] and um so if you just stick a little
[22:41] jar, maybe a little bowl, something like
[22:44] that, and just ask people that come to
[22:46] your house if they had any change in
[22:47] their pocket. And maybe they were going
[22:49] to, you know, donate for Bibles for
[22:50] missions, right?" Well, as it happened
[22:54] to be, Brother Ed and Sister Janelle,
[22:56] part of our family were over at our
[22:58] house. So, we set out the little dish
[23:00] and they asked everybody that came
[23:03] through the house and before they left,
[23:05] they had $12.
[23:07] Um, I know that uh their youngest, their
[23:10] four-year-old son asked my daughter
[23:13] said, "Megan, do you have any money in
[23:15] your pocket?"
[23:17] And she said, "No, honey. I'm wearing a
[23:19] dress. I don't have pockets." And her
[23:21] older sister, his older sister, said to
[23:23] him, "But she has a purse."
[23:27] So they they they knew how to get what
[23:28] they were after. At any rate, um when I
[23:33] emptied the collection basket on
[23:35] December 30th, that was our last
[23:38] offering of 2018,
[23:40] I knew the children had accomplished
[23:42] something absolutely incredible. And so
[23:44] I'm going to ask Brother Tim to come and
[23:52] &gt;&gt; he can let you know.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; Don't run away.
[23:56] Amen. Well, before I read this, I I got
[23:59] an email in just the other day uh from
[24:02] Uganda. So, I'll give you the Uganda
[24:04] side of the story. And uh uh they had a
[24:08] they we had a wonderful watch night
[24:09] service, didn't we?
[24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. They also had a watch night
[24:13] service at brother Fred's church, which
[24:15] his church is about 100 people, and they
[24:18] had 1500 people for watch night.
[24:21] And he he said, "Of those 253 believed
[24:25] the message for the first time."
[24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I guess they didn't baptize
[24:29] them because it was watch night. But he
[24:32] he gave me some of the background of of
[24:35] uh the outreach. And when they when they
[24:37] go out into the different small towns
[24:40] and and the new believers are baptized,
[24:42] they take with them clothes for baptism
[24:46] because a lot of people only have one
[24:48] set of clothes.
[24:50] And he says uh he said, "We were touched
[24:55] when we saw them fighting for the
[24:57] clothes we had taken to be used for
[24:59] baptism
[25:01] and they wanted to keep them for normal
[25:03] use." And so they took lots and lots of
[25:06] clothes because they had lots and lots
[25:07] of baptisms. And so they realized that
[25:10] these people didn't just want to be
[25:12] baptized in these clothes, they wanted
[25:13] to keep them. These people they found
[25:16] out didn't have mattresses to sleep on
[25:18] and they were sleeping on papyrus and
[25:20] and so on and so forth. just to share
[25:22] with you some of the poverty that's
[25:23] there. And if they don't can't afford
[25:27] clothes, then how can they afford a
[25:29] Bible?
[25:31] But brother Mark saw that when he was
[25:33] there. And uh he he asked the pastor of
[25:37] one of the churches says, you know, why
[25:39] don't the people turn to the scripture
[25:41] when brother Tim announces the
[25:43] scripture? And the pastor said to him or
[25:45] one of the brothers said to him said,
[25:47] well, it's because they don't have
[25:48] Bibles. And that out of that became the
[25:51] burden for Bibles for Uganda. And uh and
[25:55] I'm sure Uganda is not the only country
[25:57] that's like that. But uh without further
[26:00] ado, I'll just read the letter from the
[26:03] uh Sunday school this morning. Says,
[26:05] "Mission offering, Cloverdale Bible Way
[26:08] Sunday School. The Sunday school
[26:10] children of Cloverdale Bible Way would
[26:12] like to present their special missionary
[26:14] offering to Bible believers to be used
[26:17] for the purchase of Bibles for the
[26:19] believers in Uganda. Over the last 17
[26:23] weeks of 2018, the total amount
[26:26] collected in both US and Canadian
[26:28] currency for this special missionary
[26:30] offering came to $883.
[26:48] I say God bless the little children.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; And uh Brother Richard's a man of of
[26:54] many talents as you heard his talent of
[26:56] encouraging the children to collect
[26:58] money from everywhere. Brother Richard
[27:00] also collects clothes. And so I'm I'm
[27:03] hereby commissioning him to find a way
[27:05] to get clothes to Uganda. And he didn't
[27:08] know I was going to say that this
[27:09] morning, but he sends clothes over to
[27:12] Ukraine for the believers that are
[27:13] there. And I there are great needs in
[27:15] Uganda. The believers actually for watch
[27:18] night, the believers in Uganda collected
[27:21] a whole bunch of clothes. Uh and that
[27:23] they sent me pictures of row upon row.
[27:26] It almost look like winners. You know,
[27:28] some of you sisters will relate to that.
[27:30] just row upon row of it's all used
[27:32] clothing. I don't know if Wyinners is
[27:33] used clothing, but uh anyway, they they
[27:36] had this and they had all these people
[27:38] gathered and then they just as a gift to
[27:40] them says, "Come in, grab yourself a
[27:42] dress, brothers. Grab yourself a shirt,
[27:45] you know, a pair of pants, a pair of
[27:46] shoes, just whatever they could
[27:48] collect." That was their offering to the
[27:50] new believers and to the poor people of
[27:52] Uganda. So, there are great needs over
[27:55] there and they're doing what they can
[27:57] do. And I thank God for each and every
[27:59] one of you. Thank God for the Sunday
[28:01] school children, each and everyone
[28:02] that's contributed. God bless you very
[28:04] much. And God bless brother Richard.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't God good? Praise the Lord. God is
[28:18] in his people. Amen. I love to hear
[28:20] these testimonies. And we're going to
[28:22] turn the service to our pastor now.
[28:24] There's an old hymn I'd like to sing
[28:26] that's been running through my mind the
[28:27] last couple days. Number 736.
[28:30] How marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[28:33] song shall ever be. Amen. How marvelous
[28:36] is his love for us, saints. Amen. Let's
[28:38] not ever take it for granted. And let's
[28:40] sing this together now as our brother Ed
[28:42] comes and we just change the order of
[28:43] the service now.
[28:46] I stand amazed in the presence
[28:50] of Jesus the Nazerine
[28:55] and wonder how he could love me a sinner
[29:01] condemned unclean.
[29:04] Oh how marvelous, how wonderful and my
[29:10] song shall ever be. How marvelous, how
[29:17] wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[29:23] For me it was in the garden.
[29:28] He prayed not my will but thine.
[29:32] He had no tears for his own griefs but
[29:37] sweat drops of blood for mine.
[29:42] How marvelous, how wonderful, and my
[29:47] song shall ever be.
[29:51] How marvelous, how wonderful is my
[29:57] Savior's love for me.
[30:01] In pity, angels beheld him and came from
[30:07] the world of life
[30:10] to comfort him in the sorrows.
[30:15] He bore for my soul that night. Yes, how
[30:21] marvelous, how wonderful, and my song
[30:26] shall ever be. How marvelous, how
[30:32] wonderful is my Savior's love for me.
[30:39] He took my sin and my sorrows
[30:44] and made them his very own.
[30:47] Then he bore the burden to Calary
[30:53] and suffered and died alone.
[30:57] Yes. How marvelous, how wonderful, and
[31:03] my song shall ever be. How marvelous,
[31:09] how wonderful is my Savior's love for
[31:14] me.
[31:16] When with the ransom in glory,
[31:21] his face I last shall see
[31:26] will be my joy through the ages
[31:30] to sing of his love for me. Yes, how
[31:36] marvelous, how wonderful and my song
[31:42] shall ever be. Oh, how marvelous, how
[31:48] wonderful is my Savior's love for it.
[31:52] Once again. Oh yes. How marvelous, how
[31:58] wonderful, and my song.
[32:11] Amen.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful?
[32:19] &gt;&gt; How marvelous.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; How wonderful.
[32:23] Well, I have been pondering for some
[32:27] weeks uh coming to you
[32:31] and
[32:32] I thought, well, uh,
[32:35] Brother Tom, you know, he's been so
[32:38] gracious, always wanting to know if I
[32:42] want to speak. Well, I hardly ever want
[32:45] to speak. But on the other hand, you
[32:49] can't stop the, you know, when I come to
[32:52] a service or when I read a message or
[32:55] when I listen to a message, it's always
[32:58] stirring. I have to stop and think about
[33:02] that because that's it's so profound and
[33:06] it goes far beyond
[33:08] our human understanding.
[33:11] So I want to ask you this morning
[33:15] uh rather than
[33:18] rather than just preach as such I want
[33:23] you to feel free to jot down I hope you
[33:26] have a pen or pencil if you don't borrow
[33:29] one from someone else and jot down
[33:33] something. I'd like the service to be uh
[33:36] a little different on in that way. so
[33:40] that you could
[33:42] uh you'll have some questions I'm sure
[33:46] and uh
[33:49] you know when we say the word
[33:51] supernatural
[33:53] supernatural
[33:55] that's something that's beyond the
[33:58] natural and the language that you have
[34:02] the language that I speak with today in
[34:05] English or if you understand it in
[34:08] French or Chinese or some the language.
[34:11] Uh,
[34:13] often I will go back to see how did that
[34:16] word come about?
[34:18] Well, it came from the Latin or it came
[34:21] from the Greek or it came from the
[34:23] Hebrew.
[34:24] I'd like to find out where it came
[34:26] about. What was their understanding of
[34:29] the event?
[34:31] And uh it's it's that's really quite
[34:35] amazing in itself. So today I'm going to
[34:40] I want to uh really touch on two things.
[34:43] Number one, the subject is he came down.
[34:50] That's the subject.
[34:53] And then when he came down, he was
[34:58] always searching for somebody or
[35:01] something.
[35:02] And I wanted to know I wanted to present
[35:06] to you what was he searching for? And I
[35:11] have come to believe and I want to
[35:13] present to you he was coming to look for
[35:16] faith
[35:18] or coming to look for a person
[35:23] that was selected. He had selected to
[35:27] believe him. And then he began to make
[35:30] himself known to that individual.
[35:34] Now we are here this morning and I want
[35:38] to say a very rare ministry
[35:43] that we call the ministry of the prophet
[35:46] of God.
[35:48] Uh there's been nothing like it,
[35:50] friends.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like it in history. And
[35:54] I think of what Tommy Osbborne said at
[35:56] brother Brennham's memorial. He said,
[35:59] "You won't see this again."
[36:02] And that's public information for you.
[36:07] You won't see this again. That's because
[36:11] that's a compliment really to you
[36:15] because you can say, "Well, I believe
[36:18] what God sent." Amen.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Now,
[36:22] if you just sit here this morning and
[36:25] say, "Well, I have my own thoughts."
[36:27] Quite frankly, I want to respect you,
[36:30] but your thoughts are no more than my
[36:32] thoughts, and my thoughts are really
[36:35] nothing compared to uh God's thoughts.
[36:40] And God's thoughts are very very deep
[36:44] and very profound and will go far beyond
[36:48] your understanding. So we do not have
[36:51] the capacity to grasp some of the things
[36:55] that even I may have known or I may say
[37:00] this morning. And uh but I want to speak
[37:03] on how he came down. And just before we
[37:08] start to read and start to go into the
[37:10] scripture, I'd like uh brother Ryan if
[37:13] you would come and
[37:16] I would like to sing the song. He came
[37:18] to me
[37:19] when I could not go come to where he
[37:22] was. He came to me.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; That's been such a reality. He came to
[37:28] me and right now today, this morning, he
[37:33] knows where you are.
[37:36] He knows what you need, if you need
[37:39] anything.
[37:41] You may not feel that you need anything,
[37:43] but he knows exactly where you are. And
[37:46] by the time we're done the service this
[37:48] morning, I'm sure you'll have a lot to
[37:51] think about. All right, would you come,
[37:54] Brother Ryan, please?
[37:58] He came
[38:01] to me.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Let's stand, shall we?
[38:05] He came
[38:08] to me.
[38:12] When I could not come
[38:17] to where he was, he came to me.
[38:26] And that's why he died
[38:33] on Calary.
[38:40] When I could not come
[38:45] to where he was, he came to me.
[38:54] Let's just bow in a moment of prayer,
[38:56] please. Heavenly Father,
[38:59] you are so gracious
[39:02] &gt;&gt; and as your prophet said, you loved the
[39:05] people.
[39:07] You love fellowship
[39:09] and we believe you love what we are able
[39:14] to bring to you today.
[39:16] It's our heart and soul.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. with thanksgiving.
[39:21] We worship you in spirit and in truth.
[39:25] We worship you in song. We worship you
[39:27] in giving. We worship you in our
[39:30] attendance here. And now respectfully,
[39:34] oh God, we come and we say, "Oh, Holy
[39:38] Spirit of the almighty one,
[39:41] &gt;&gt; the savior of the world,
[39:44] &gt;&gt; redeemer. You are my redeemer.
[39:47] You have sent the Holy Spirit to infill
[39:51] us and infill each one. I pray, oh God,
[39:56] that as we give ourselves to you, you
[39:58] will come now and break the word of
[40:01] truth in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] I'm going to read out of Matthew the
[40:10] first chapter starting with verse one.
[40:18] and we'll read down
[40:20] through verse six.
[40:23] The first six verses,
[40:26] the book of the generation,
[40:29] if you'll notice, it's a single,
[40:32] it's not plural.
[40:35] Many times in the Bible you'll find it
[40:38] and it'll be generations
[40:41] because there are generations in
[40:43] people's lives. But in Christ's life,
[40:46] it's singular. The book of the
[40:49] generation
[40:51] of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
[40:56] the son of Abraham.
[40:58] Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat
[41:03] Jacob. And Jacob begat Judas and his
[41:08] brethren. And Judas begat Ferris
[41:12] and Zarah
[41:15] of to Tamar.
[41:18] And Ferris begat
[41:22] Eson.
[41:23] And Esam begat Aram.
[41:27] And Aram begat Minadab.
[41:31] And Minadab begat Naan,
[41:35] and Naan begat Salman.
[41:39] And Salman begat
[41:41] Boaz of Rahab.
[41:44] Rahab was the harlot. It doesn't mention
[41:46] her as being that here.
[41:49] And Boaz begat Oed of Ruth. And Oed
[41:55] begat Jesse.
[41:57] And Jesse begat David,
[42:00] the king of the king. And David the king
[42:04] begat Solomon.
[42:07] Of her that had been the wife of Urias.
[42:13] Now
[42:15] Urias was a Hittite.
[42:19] Ba Sheba was his wife.
[42:22] And David desired Ba Sheeba.
[42:27] and
[42:28] uh that's where he had his
[42:32] sin encounter with sin. But God had
[42:35] promised David that his kingdom would be
[42:39] everlasting.
[42:40] So these are things that we don't have
[42:44] an answer for. we don't understand
[42:46] perhaps but I wish to speak more about
[42:50] that and I want to bring out to you
[42:54] in in the speaking and reading this
[42:59] morning
[43:01] it centers around
[43:04] God coming down
[43:07] seeking for someone or selected person
[43:13] to believe him. That's the key, friends.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Is if you believe.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; That's the key.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And we don't brush everything else
[43:24] aside. That as though we're not
[43:26] responsible for what happens, but that
[43:29] is the key.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; You can live ever so godly,
[43:34] &gt;&gt; but if you don't believe,
[43:37] you will not enter the kingdom of God.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; So, you may be seated and God bless you.
[43:47] Now,
[43:50] you'll just need to remember my opening
[43:52] comments,
[43:54] what God is seeking to do. And now I'm
[43:58] going to continue to read some
[44:00] scripture.
[44:04] In John's gospel,
[44:07] it says, "Then Jesus said unto them,"
[44:10] and that's this Jesus, who we have just
[44:13] read of his lineage.
[44:16] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[44:19] verily, I say unto you, except you eat
[44:22] the flesh of the Son of Man and drink
[44:25] his blood, you have no life in you."
[44:29] This is to digest.
[44:32] They weren't able to
[44:34] He wasn't able to explain that. I
[44:37] shouldn't say he wasn't able to explain
[44:38] it. He never explained it. He just said
[44:41] it.
[44:43] And he knew right well that what he was
[44:46] saying was going to be offensive
[44:51] &gt;&gt; to the people,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And nothing has changed. The Holy Spirit
[44:57] may allow something to be said that's
[45:00] offending
[45:01] or offensive to you.
[45:05] And don't be afraid of that.
[45:08] Uh don't be afraid of your feelings
[45:12] being hurt. God is not operated or
[45:16] operating according to our feelings or
[45:20] according to our opinions or according
[45:23] to what's considered nice by us. He's
[45:27] not con he's not operating that way. He
[45:30] just says it
[45:31] &gt;&gt; and then leaves it.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Except you eat the flesh of the son of
[45:35] man. He knew right then there was
[45:38] multitudes that couldn't possibly accept
[45:42] that. They would say, "Well, Moses said,
[45:45] God said to us through the prophet Moses
[45:49] that that would be uh an abomination."
[45:52] And uh and now in a unveiling of God,
[45:56] brother Brandham comes to that very
[45:59] scripture.
[46:02] So he said, "Who so eateth the flesh of
[46:07] the
[46:09] uh so who so eateth the flesh and
[46:13] drinkkeeth my blood hath eternal life,
[46:17] and I will raise him up at the last day.
[46:20] For my flesh is meat indeed,
[46:23] and my blood is drink indeed."
[46:27] See, once a person consumes something,
[46:31] you can never separate it from you.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; It's a part of your strength. It's a
[46:36] part of your energy. It's a part of your
[46:39] thought process. It's whatever this body
[46:42] is that God allowed you to be born with.
[46:45] It it becomes a part of every every
[46:48] element of your body.
[46:51] And that's exactly what Jesus is saying.
[46:54] Unless I become you and you become me,
[47:00] we become one. Unless that happens, you
[47:03] cannot enter the kingdom of God. These
[47:06] people couldn't grasp that, of course.
[47:08] And the Bible tells us that multitudes
[47:12] left him.
[47:15] As the living father, this is verse 57,
[47:19] chapter 8, I believe it is. As the
[47:22] living Father hath sent me, and I live
[47:25] by the Father, so he that eateth me,
[47:30] even he shall live by me. This is that
[47:34] bread that came down from heaven,
[47:37] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[47:41] dead.
[47:42] He that eateth
[47:45] of the bread that shall live forever
[47:49] more. Of this bread shall live forever
[47:52] more.
[47:54] Then Jesus is verse 67. Then said Jesus
[47:58] unto the twel, will you also go away?
[48:04] Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to
[48:08] whom shall we go? For thou hast the
[48:11] words of eternal life,
[48:15] and we believe
[48:17] and are sure that thou art the Christ,
[48:22] the son of the living God. And he said
[48:25] unto them,
[48:27] this is John 8 and 23. And he said unto
[48:30] them, Ye are from beneath,
[48:34] I am from above.
[48:37] You are of this world. I am not of this
[48:40] world. Now he was not talking to his
[48:42] disciples. He's talking to the general
[48:45] uh audience at that time.
[48:51] And then the next verse, and Jesus said
[48:54] unto them, if God were your father, you
[48:59] would love me.
[49:01] For I proceeded from
[49:05] I have proceeded forth and come from
[49:08] God. Neither came I of myself, but he
[49:12] sent me.
[49:14] And I know,
[49:17] he was confronted. He said, "You don't
[49:19] know the This brother said, well, you
[49:21] don't know the scripture very well." He
[49:24] said, "But I know the author very well."
[49:28] And I want to say to you today,
[49:33] perhaps the message may not be exactly
[49:37] in uh I spent many hours, many many
[49:43] hours, several weeks actually.
[49:46] And I wanted to have the continuity.
[49:49] And I finally came to the point of view
[49:53] that it's impossible just to have the
[49:55] continuity the way I would like to have
[49:58] it. So I will just scatter all of the
[50:00] word out there and leave you with the
[50:04] main thought is coming down. I'm going
[50:07] to go into that now and what he's coming
[50:11] down for. And furthermore, it'll come
[50:14] right now to your address. The prophet
[50:17] of God said he is here.
[50:21] He is present. And if you believe that
[50:24] you are a believer,
[50:26] then you also must believe what God has
[50:30] said to you. And he said, I will never
[50:34] leave you.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; I will always be with you. Do you
[50:39] believe that?
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Was this God?
[50:43] I'm gonna go into some scripture
[50:49] and
[50:51] you may not really know this God.
[50:55] You may know him. Oh, I felt him. I know
[50:59] that he heard me. But do you really know
[51:02] him?
[51:04] Whom to know is life eternal?
[51:08] And perhaps I want to stress to this
[51:11] congregation today, you are here. You're
[51:14] here on a Sunday morning, 6th of
[51:16] January, 2019.
[51:20] Maybe he has
[51:23] seeking you out.
[51:26] Maybe he has been calling you. And so
[51:31] many times people think, well, a call is
[51:35] God calling me. No, sometimes and most
[51:39] often I will show you in the scripture.
[51:42] It's in difficult times.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; It always allows or also allows you to
[51:50] go through a straining time,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; a difficult time
[51:56] and in hardship
[51:58] and painful.
[52:01] And that sets up
[52:04] a cry within you.
[52:07] God said to Moses, he said, "I've heard
[52:10] their cry.
[52:13] I've heard their their cry as a result
[52:16] of their task masters."
[52:19] We are living in a world, friends,
[52:21] that's very contrary
[52:24] &gt;&gt; to what you believe,
[52:27] &gt;&gt; very contrary to what you hold dear. And
[52:31] it's constantly waring against
[52:35] things that are precious to you.
[52:38] Constantly waring. And it sets up
[52:41] unbeknown to you. It sets up a
[52:45] uh uncomfortable feeling,
[52:49] a painful feeling. You have to be around
[52:52] people. You have to rub shoulders with
[52:54] them. And you have just recently perhaps
[52:57] over this holiday season. and uh your
[53:01] background,
[53:03] your how you were brought up,
[53:07] uh maybe what happened to you. I have
[53:11] people that I've talked to and brother
[53:14] Brandham has said, people who were
[53:16] suffering in front of him and he would
[53:20] say, "If I were God,
[53:23] I would heal you."
[53:26] He said that many times. If I were God,
[53:30] I would heal you.
[53:33] He wanted them to know that
[53:36] someone who was before him was not
[53:39] detached
[53:40] from their need.
[53:43] And I am not detached from the needs of
[53:47] the congregation. I I I I feel that we
[53:51] should be
[53:53] uh not merely compassionate, but we
[53:55] should feel. And brother Brandham also
[53:58] said that uh if I've had any success
[54:02] because I've been able to put myself in
[54:04] my little ministry, I've been able to
[54:07] put myself
[54:08] in that person's need or that person's
[54:12] place. And when I was just a kid
[54:16] about 14 years old and he was still
[54:19] taking the hand of the people and he
[54:22] would take the hand he took a a woman's
[54:26] hand and he said the hand of a mother
[54:32] wrinkled
[54:35] chapped hand.
[54:37] Someone who'd been in the dishes.
[54:40] some who had been in the wash before
[54:43] there was washing machines perhaps but
[54:45] he as soon as he took their hand he said
[54:49] a mother
[54:51] so he associated it right away
[54:54] and that was how he had
[54:58] I won't say how he had success
[55:01] because that would not be right
[55:06] so now how did he come down.
[55:11] But God is so good, he said,
[55:15] trying to do something else to bring
[55:18] them to believe
[55:21] him
[55:23] and have faith in him.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people came before him.
[55:30] And now, this is where perhaps we would
[55:34] be offended if you were standing here.
[55:37] say, "Do you believe?"
[55:39] Said, "Well, yes."
[55:42] And he said, "Then why are you standing
[55:44] here?"
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Because that that's where it really
[55:51] comes home
[55:52] &gt;&gt; to your address. If I were to say to
[55:54] you, "Are you a believer?" You say,
[55:56] "Yes, of course I'm a believer." Then
[56:00] why are you standing here? Or why are
[56:02] you desiring something from God? because
[56:08] we still need God to do something
[56:11] special.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And so he's trying to do something else
[56:19] to bring them to believe him and have
[56:22] faith in him. So the purpose of him
[56:27] coming down was seeking faith
[56:31] in the hearts of the people.
[56:36] In the infallibilities of God,
[56:40] God calls sovereignty
[56:44] sovereignly
[56:45] without anyone without anything you done
[56:48] about it. There's nothing you done. Men
[56:53] say, "Oh, I sought God."
[56:56] No man has sought God at any time.
[57:01] But it's God seeking man.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Not man seeking God. God seeking man.
[57:10] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[57:13] except my father
[57:16] draws him first." You You get it?
[57:21] It has to be God drawing man.
[57:27] So now I want to start
[57:31] when God come down. He came down in Eden
[57:37] and he says, "Adam,
[57:41] Adam,
[57:43] where art thou?"
[57:45] We and we could say, now I'm just going
[57:48] to speak from my heart.
[57:52] with everything
[57:54] that you have had, everything that you
[57:57] have spiritually. Oh, I've met God. I've
[58:01] been in services and we've sang and I
[58:05] worship and I hear the messages. I hear
[58:08] the tapes or whatever more. Uh, and I
[58:13] love it. It speaks to me.
[58:17] But I want to ask you this morning, I
[58:19] wonder if God has been calling you.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] And
[58:26] in your difficulty,
[58:31] in your reversals, things that go
[58:33] sideways for you in life,
[58:37] and I'm just going to go, I'm going to
[58:38] dig deep.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; There isn't anyone here. But what has a
[58:48] horror story
[58:51] as far as life is concerned?
[58:54] Things didn't go the way I planned them
[58:57] to go.
[58:59] You don't know how I was brought up as a
[59:02] kid. No, I don't. There's people here
[59:06] who've not had a childhood.
[59:08] There's others here who've had a good
[59:10] childhood, but there's people here
[59:12] who've not had a childhood.
[59:15] I didn't hardly have a childhood.
[59:18] My wife didn't have much of a childhood.
[59:23] Things went sideways.
[59:25] There were separations. There was war.
[59:29] There was trouble.
[59:31] Some have a lot of food. While you're
[59:34] sitting here and you had your breakfast
[59:36] this morning, I imagine there are
[59:39] children, young children who are
[59:43] searching out in the garbage fields
[59:47] overseas
[59:49] and that's their entire living. You
[59:52] think surely something something can be
[59:55] done for these kids. Really, can they?
[59:59] Why aren't we doing it? We we you know
[1:00:03] we just run out of space. We run out of
[1:00:06] ideas.
[1:00:07] We run out of social abilities.
[1:00:12] You that are sitting here might be the
[1:00:15] privileged few.
[1:00:18] But that doesn't escape us from the God
[1:00:23] that has even allowed that to happen. We
[1:00:27] say, "Why does that happen? I don't know
[1:00:29] why it happens.
[1:00:31] But it happens.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; And while things are fine here, and
[1:00:35] while you may attend McDonald's or
[1:00:38] Wendy's or the restaurants and all the
[1:00:40] rest of it, there's people all over the
[1:00:43] globe that know nothing about that.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; I heard brother Tim up here speaking of
[1:00:52] the people going down to baptism. Then
[1:00:54] they wanted to hold their clothes
[1:00:56] because they didn't have another ch. Oh,
[1:00:59] well, we'd like to do something about
[1:01:01] that. And you know, in this country,
[1:01:04] there's a documentary. You don't even
[1:01:06] want to see it because the clothes that
[1:01:08] people give, they've got a huge
[1:01:12] warehouse in Toronto or Montreal and and
[1:01:16] uh it just the Salvation Army gets so
[1:01:19] many clothes, they don't know what to
[1:01:21] do. that's ground up
[1:01:25] and tons, hundreds of tons are sent
[1:01:29] overseas. And then they showed in a
[1:01:32] documentary showed the the very garments
[1:01:35] that were given in this land were being
[1:01:39] burned
[1:01:41] by the tens of thousands of tons were
[1:01:45] being burned and destroyed
[1:01:48] over in Kenya
[1:01:51] because they didn't there was more
[1:01:53] clothes than the people could even use
[1:01:56] or
[1:01:58] what am I saying? I'm I'm Why am I
[1:02:01] describing this? I'm describing it
[1:02:03] because do you think that is outside of
[1:02:06] God's view? No. God sees it and he
[1:02:11] appreciates it that people have given
[1:02:14] and they but but yet this world's
[1:02:18] program
[1:02:20] is flawed.
[1:02:22] Amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; World's program,
[1:02:26] government, social programs is flawed
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; because the human element is not
[1:02:33] supernatural. It's a natural element.
[1:02:36] It's not a supernatural element.
[1:02:40] And so I have to bring this to you
[1:02:43] before we proceed. Is that all right?
[1:02:49] People have to come to a place where
[1:02:51] they say, you know, man's efforts
[1:02:55] fail. That's all there is to it. Man's
[1:02:59] efforts. It doesn't mean we shouldn't do
[1:03:01] something, but it means that we should
[1:03:06] know that our lives are being guided by
[1:03:09] the Holy Spirit.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Your efforts on your own uh by your own
[1:03:16] thought
[1:03:17] uh by your own desire to do good
[1:03:20] whatever I have nothing against that
[1:03:23] that's fine but nevertheless that is not
[1:03:26] the answer for the son and daughter of
[1:03:29] God say father
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; thy will be done
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; on earth as it is in heaven
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; let thy will be done and before we do
[1:03:41] anything we should know that God has led
[1:03:44] us to it
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; amen Yeah.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; And so when he said these
[1:03:52] marvelous words, can you imagine God
[1:03:56] who's now come down in the flesh and he
[1:03:58] said, "Except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:04:01] my blood." And the Bible says, or rather
[1:04:05] the prophet of God has said, "And the
[1:04:08] whole audience walked away from him."
[1:04:13] the whole audience in fact is these were
[1:04:16] not people who were renegades. These
[1:04:20] were people who were much more careful
[1:04:23] perhaps about spiritual things than we
[1:04:26] are.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; These are people who went to the temple.
[1:04:29] These are people who sacrificed. These
[1:04:32] are people who believed in the God of
[1:04:35] Elijah, the God of Moses, the God of the
[1:04:39] prophets, the God of uh of creation, the
[1:04:44] Almighty. They believed on him. That's
[1:04:46] who was hearing these words. And that's
[1:04:49] who flocked away from him.
[1:04:52] They walked away from him.
[1:04:56] And there's no one now that we come to
[1:04:58] the this day in the unveiling of God.
[1:05:03] And there's no one could explain what he
[1:05:07] had just said. How are they going to eat
[1:05:12] his flesh and drink his blood and how
[1:05:16] did he come down? And that's where I
[1:05:20] have my text.
[1:05:26] How did he come down?
[1:05:29] Well, I
[1:05:33] I want to more than ask that question.
[1:05:35] You're being very quiet
[1:05:37] and it's obvious
[1:05:40] you haven't got the answers either.
[1:05:43] How did he come down?
[1:05:47] He comes very secretly.
[1:05:51] He comes very it's almost a clandestine.
[1:05:57] It's it's uh in a way I have a scripture
[1:06:01] that says
[1:06:03] uh
[1:06:05] his ways
[1:06:08] are past finding out.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; You remember the scripture?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; His ways I'll give you the reference in
[1:06:16] a few moments. His ways are past finding
[1:06:21] out.
[1:06:23] Now
[1:06:25] I I'm gonna You don't mind? I'm going to
[1:06:28] drop a bomb on you.
[1:06:35] I want to suggest to you that in this
[1:06:39] life, your mother, your father,
[1:06:44] your coming into this world
[1:06:48] was not unknown to God. Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; And somehow within the plan of God,
[1:06:58] he who knew the beginning from the end
[1:07:02] is going to fit you in. And he knew that
[1:07:05] somewhere along the line, you're going
[1:07:08] to hear
[1:07:10] his voice. You're going to hear his
[1:07:13] message. and he's going to be standing
[1:07:15] right there by his holy spirit to see
[1:07:20] exactly your response.
[1:07:23] How are you responding to that? Say,
[1:07:25] well, I came to him when he was,
[1:07:30] you know, brother Brandham tells his
[1:07:31] life story many times. You know where he
[1:07:34] goes? when he was eight years old,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; carrying
[1:07:42] water
[1:07:44] to his father's still where they made
[1:07:48] whiskey.
[1:07:50] And there he is, eight years old,
[1:07:55] just a boy.
[1:07:58] And
[1:08:01] I want to be careful, but my wife and I
[1:08:05] sat down with the girl that brother
[1:08:08] Brandham talked about was his
[1:08:11] girlfriend.
[1:08:13] And she lived in Florida and we were
[1:08:16] there and the pastor said, "Would you
[1:08:18] like to meet Brother Brandham's
[1:08:20] girlfriend?" We said, "Yes, we would." I
[1:08:24] asked her, my wife and I and her were
[1:08:27] just sitting there and I asked her, I
[1:08:30] did you know, do you know what a prophet
[1:08:33] is?
[1:08:34] No. She said, I don't believe I do. I
[1:08:37] said, do you know that brother Brham was
[1:08:40] a prophet? We regard him as a prophet of
[1:08:43] God,
[1:08:45] a messenger.
[1:08:47] and she said, "No, he did tell me that
[1:08:50] he would hear voices in the trees." And
[1:08:54] I said, "Yes." And then she took out the
[1:08:57] picture of him, one with a big cowboy
[1:08:59] hat and a handkerchief about his neck.
[1:09:04] Uh, and she said
[1:09:06] it was a picture that he had given her
[1:09:08] and he had signed it.
[1:09:11] And I looked at the picture and I've
[1:09:14] told you this I think before, but she
[1:09:17] just looked past me. Looked over my head
[1:09:20] and just passed me. She said, "I still
[1:09:23] love him."
[1:09:24] Those were her words. I still love him.
[1:09:29] But I thought about I thought about this
[1:09:32] woman and I thought about and she'd been
[1:09:34] carrying that in her purse.
[1:09:39] She had no idea.
[1:09:44] She had no idea when she's walking the
[1:09:46] pathway
[1:09:49] carrying water
[1:09:52] that's going to turn into whiskey.
[1:09:57] Is God interested in the whiskey? Is God
[1:09:59] interested in that? What is this boy
[1:10:02] doing? He's interested. He knows
[1:10:05] what this lad is going to become.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And all of your upbringing
[1:10:13] and all of your difficulty.
[1:10:16] Don't Don't talk Don't look at me as
[1:10:19] though you haven't had difficulty. I
[1:10:20] know that you do. I know that things
[1:10:23] don't always go the way we would like
[1:10:26] them to go. We all have some kind of
[1:10:30] entanglement someplace along the line.
[1:10:33] and difficulties of life and sometimes
[1:10:37] it's death and sometimes it's trouble
[1:10:40] and sometimes it's financial things. The
[1:10:43] world is full of it.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Absolutely full of it.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; And it becomes a big obstacle to the
[1:10:52] believer. But I'm saying to you tonight,
[1:10:56] today, this morning, I'm saying to you
[1:11:00] without any apology,
[1:11:03] don't allow those things to hinder your
[1:11:07] spiritual walk.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Don't allow those things. They are
[1:11:12] meaningless
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; in the sense of God. He he has I I have
[1:11:18] just uh read the genealogy of Jesus
[1:11:21] Christ and he came from a very a
[1:11:26] questionable background
[1:11:28] by the human mind and if you were back
[1:11:31] then it may have been that may have been
[1:11:34] a greater difficulty for you than it is
[1:11:37] today. You just read this is the
[1:11:39] generation of Jesus Christ the son of
[1:11:42] David and the son of Abraham. You might
[1:11:44] say, "Well, just a second. Just a
[1:11:46] second.
[1:11:48] What about David in all of his
[1:11:50] difficulties? What about David taking Ba
[1:11:53] Sheba and having a child by her and God
[1:11:57] slaying the child? What about that?"
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; And you'd have good reason to ask that.
[1:12:02] But I want you to know that who you call
[1:12:05] heavenly father,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; he said, "I am going to have my son come
[1:12:10] by this man by his lineage."
[1:12:13] That's all there is to it.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And you've heard me say this before,
[1:12:18] but I don't think that you can give it a
[1:12:21] proper answer. I cannot. And that is
[1:12:25] Tamar is mentioned.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Rahab is mentioned.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Tamar which
[1:12:33] had a relationship with her
[1:12:34] father-in-law.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what happened. Maybe it's
[1:12:41] not your father-in-law, but it was her
[1:12:43] father-in-law. Your Lord Jesus, that was
[1:12:47] that was a mother of the faith to him.
[1:12:51] Rahab the harlot, never called a harlot,
[1:12:55] I believe, in the New Testament, but she
[1:12:57] was a harlot. They did not have Well,
[1:13:01] are we saying, why am I stressing this?
[1:13:04] Are we saying, "Well, because we want to
[1:13:06] make the the gospel uh less holy." No.
[1:13:12] I'm trying to show you how great God is.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; How absolutely great he is.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; He's greater than any sin you can think
[1:13:24] of. He's greater than death itself.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He's greater than any war that's ever
[1:13:30] been declared. He's greater than any
[1:13:33] nation that has arose because he allows
[1:13:36] a nation to rise and he allows them to
[1:13:39] go down. And I just want you to say to
[1:13:42] yourself right now that I'm part of a
[1:13:46] great nation. You may be part of America
[1:13:49] but if it comes to a demise and it
[1:13:52] becomes povertystricken
[1:13:55] and I have seen a great shift in things
[1:13:58] in the last 50 60 years. I used to
[1:14:02] travel through America. It was all
[1:14:04] beautiful homes and so on and so forth.
[1:14:07] Things have changed
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; but God is the same.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord and I change not.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:14:18] God came down and it was in in uh in
[1:14:24] Eden when he came down he was crying and
[1:14:29] saying Adam where art thou he might come
[1:14:32] in this generation say that he comes
[1:14:36] close to you
[1:14:39] it'll be a question I sent you a message
[1:14:44] I sent you a messenger.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; It was not simple.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; It was not easy. It was full of
[1:14:52] hardship.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; It was full of death.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; He lost his wife. He lost his baby. His
[1:15:01] baby was with such pain, more pain than
[1:15:04] we have known.
[1:15:08] and spinal menenitis was going through
[1:15:11] the body and the eyes were crossing and
[1:15:15] all these things. I'm not traumatizing.
[1:15:17] I'm telling you what life was all about
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and a life of the messenger was all
[1:15:23] about. And then he said he may say you
[1:15:26] you know about the me meetings you know
[1:15:29] about
[1:15:31] you've heard about it.
[1:15:35] Brother Brandon would say
[1:15:37] how how how is it that I know that? How
[1:15:42] is it that I know that that's more than
[1:15:45] a man? That's not me.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That has to be God. who knows that about
[1:15:53] you.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; And he he and we've had all of that. And
[1:15:59] and we don't want to be found hiding
[1:16:02] behind something
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; saying, "Well,
[1:16:11] there's reasons why I shouldn't know.
[1:16:12] I'm young."
[1:16:14] No, that's not a reason. You could know.
[1:16:20] Well, I don't really I haven't given
[1:16:22] much time. Why haven't you given much
[1:16:24] time?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Well, if we were seeking things that
[1:16:30] were gold or silver or something, how
[1:16:34] about something that's worth much more
[1:16:36] than gold and silver?
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; How about that?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; And we have it right in front of us.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; You have it in your shelf.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] How does he come down?
[1:16:59] Well, I want to get it more than a
[1:17:01] phrase
[1:17:03] that you just hear.
[1:17:08] You said, "Well, he's he's he's yeah, I
[1:17:10] believe that he's here." No, be careful
[1:17:13] what you what you say.
[1:17:19] I'm going to go quickly
[1:17:22] through a number of them,
[1:17:26] a number of experiences. Please,
[1:17:31] are you with me? All right.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; I I'm just I have so many things that I
[1:17:45] want to say to you.
[1:17:50] And I want you to be able to relate to
[1:17:52] them. You live in a land of
[1:17:56] ease and plenty.
[1:17:58] But what about what if you were one of
[1:18:01] the kids in Egypt?
[1:18:05] I'm just going to start there.
[1:18:08] What if you were one of the young
[1:18:10] people? You're not on a garbage heap.
[1:18:12] You're things are you're going to go
[1:18:14] home. you're going to have dinner today,
[1:18:17] etc., etc. It's very, very different.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know that people,
[1:18:22] listen, now people have had that and had
[1:18:27] it stripped away from them very quickly.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to know. Where
[1:18:34] would we be
[1:18:36] in Moses time? Moses was one of the
[1:18:39] young people, but his parents were under
[1:18:44] the rule of task masters.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; They were making bricks in a very wicked
[1:18:51] country. And forget, don't forget that
[1:18:53] was like America. They were a the super
[1:18:58] power
[1:18:59] of that day.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; You want to say it to yourself? The
[1:19:05] super power of that day was Egypt.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; And the people were uh busy making
[1:19:17] bricks and under task masters and it was
[1:19:20] difficult.
[1:19:23] Moses had been reduced from a military
[1:19:26] giant to a shepherd.
[1:19:31] And there were things that were going on
[1:19:33] in his heart.
[1:19:36] Things that were going on.
[1:19:41] And I I I hope that I can get this
[1:19:44] across to you. That is the call.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; That is one way God calls
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; in difficulty.
[1:20:01] things to go sideways in your life,
[1:20:08] difficulty.
[1:20:10] And if you had to take it in today's
[1:20:13] standards, you say messed up,
[1:20:17] real difficult times. And it's in this
[1:20:20] congregation as well, in the lives of
[1:20:23] the congregation. It's difficult times.
[1:20:28] It's not how you would have
[1:20:31] written it out and said, "This is the
[1:20:33] way it's going to be."
[1:20:36] Difficult times. That's why you're
[1:20:38] silent. That's why you're quiet. I want
[1:20:41] you to be quiet. I want you to think
[1:20:44] about it.
[1:20:45] Your God,
[1:20:48] your God,
[1:20:50] your God
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; knows all about it. Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; He knew about it before it happened.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He knew about it while it happened.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And he knows about it even now that it
[1:21:03] happened.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And he does not want that to cause you
[1:21:07] to disbelieve
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; his word.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; When he says something, he is down here.
[1:21:14] And I would say to you, he's come in
[1:21:16] this ministry. He's come in this
[1:21:19] ministry for the same purpose to cause
[1:21:22] people to believe. He knew that we'd be
[1:21:26] in troublesome times. He knew that we
[1:21:29] would have really diff great difficulty.
[1:21:33] He knew we'd have the parents we have.
[1:21:36] He knew we'd have the marriages that we
[1:21:39] have. He knew we'd have the divorces
[1:21:42] that we have. He knew all of these
[1:21:45] difficulties. He knew about all of these
[1:21:48] wars. He knew all about these diseases
[1:21:52] and sicknesses that we have. He knew
[1:21:55] that's why he sent then a messenger that
[1:21:58] would start to come to the individual.
[1:22:02] The every individual had some particular
[1:22:05] need and it might be marital, it might
[1:22:09] be financial, it could be something else
[1:22:13] but it would be an individual need. And
[1:22:15] so he begin to deal with the people on
[1:22:18] an individual basis so that they would
[1:22:21] know and then he would tell them what uh
[1:22:26] he would say if I tell you something
[1:22:27] that you know I don't know
[1:22:31] would that he said all it is is to cause
[1:22:34] you to have faith
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; cause you to believe
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; that was the whole purpose of It
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; caused us to believe.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I saw that friends. I saw that. I sat in
[1:22:50] the meetings. I saw one after the other
[1:22:53] after the other
[1:22:56] and I saw the miraculous.
[1:22:59] But that that miraculous didn't make me
[1:23:02] a holy man.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Would I believe
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; that this was the messenger that God
[1:23:10] sent?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:12] But I believe that that's what it was.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And you know, it took a lot of years.
[1:23:20] Took a lot of years. I I don't often
[1:23:23] have the kind of service that I'm
[1:23:26] having. I'm just going to talk to you
[1:23:28] now.
[1:23:34] So he came down
[1:23:38] in Moses time or for Moses
[1:23:44] And the prophet of God said, "And there
[1:23:47] the darkest of hour that there ever was
[1:23:52] that they'd ever seen. And then Jesus
[1:23:56] come along. Oh my, darkest of hour."
[1:24:01] Then Jesus comes along.
[1:24:05] He usually comes along at the darkest of
[1:24:09] hour.
[1:24:11] I want to say something to you.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Satan has every
[1:24:21] uh theory. He has every kind of means at
[1:24:26] his disposal
[1:24:27] to make the darkest hour.
[1:24:31] Maybe for some it's their alcohol or
[1:24:35] some it's their drugs or
[1:24:39] it's it's something or to some he has
[1:24:42] different ways of making a person to
[1:24:45] feel a certain excitement that kind of
[1:24:50] uh makes easier the darkest hour. But
[1:24:53] then there comes a time when a person's
[1:24:56] laying perhaps in their bed alone
[1:25:00] and they think about it
[1:25:03] and it's it's a difficult you might you
[1:25:06] didn't come to church expecting this but
[1:25:09] I didn't come exactly expecting it
[1:25:11] either
[1:25:14] but at the darkest hour he says that's
[1:25:17] usually when he comes
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; he said but God
[1:25:24] had ordained that man,
[1:25:27] that man Moses
[1:25:29] to do that job and it must be done.
[1:25:33] He promised in the last days that he
[1:25:35] would have a church,
[1:25:37] that these signs would follow them.
[1:25:41] Isn't that right?
[1:25:43] Well, don't you think the last days are
[1:25:46] here? Isn't it time now for these things
[1:25:51] to happen?
[1:25:55] Why it's here? We caught it. Amen. And
[1:26:00] he said, "Now,
[1:26:02] uh, these times are here." There's
[1:26:06] something that I'm concerned about and
[1:26:09] that is this
[1:26:13] concern for me. Lest we
[1:26:18] settled back
[1:26:20] and the comforts of
[1:26:24] the home or the comforts of the ease and
[1:26:27] we just settled back and well we've got
[1:26:30] a church fine church that we come to.
[1:26:33] That's not the point.
[1:26:37] In fact is the good times are more
[1:26:41] difficult than the bad times.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that the good times
[1:26:47] are more dangerous than the bad times?
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Are you saying we should have bad times?
[1:26:54] No, that isn't what I said. I said just
[1:26:57] let's not make the good times a bad time
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; by forgetting God.
[1:27:05] And I can tell you that
[1:27:08] the good times is when things slip.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, the Bible says this,
[1:27:17] that in the good times, the people waxed
[1:27:21] fat.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; They waxed.
[1:27:25] So they didn't they didn't have a need
[1:27:27] of food. They didn't have a need of they
[1:27:31] they weren't worried about war. They
[1:27:34] weren't worried about conflict. They
[1:27:38] weren't worried about danger. They
[1:27:40] weren't worried about need.
[1:27:43] And those are the times when things
[1:27:45] become
[1:27:48] uh
[1:27:49] they become they slip away
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to see that happen.
[1:28:17] God God spoke
[1:28:20] and I I just hope we can take time to
[1:28:23] think about it.
[1:28:26] I'm come down.
[1:28:33] I want to leave you today with a major
[1:28:36] thought and that is
[1:28:39] God comes at a most unexpected time
[1:28:45] and we don't think I can tell you the
[1:28:48] woman at the well, she didn't dream that
[1:28:52] there's going to be a man sitting there.
[1:28:58] And do you know the confession?
[1:29:01] Let me let me just
[1:29:05] draw the true picture for you. The woman
[1:29:09] at the well.
[1:29:11] She goes home. She says, "Well, I I went
[1:29:14] to the well today." Oh, yeah. To her
[1:29:16] friends.
[1:29:19] I met a man there. Oh, yeah. You met a
[1:29:22] man there?
[1:29:24] She'd already had five and the one she
[1:29:28] was with now was not her husband. So you
[1:29:31] met a man there? Yeah. And he told me
[1:29:34] that he was the Messiah.
[1:29:37] Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:29:42] There were some people that were gripped
[1:29:45] by her testimony. She went in and she
[1:29:49] said, "I've met the Messiah."
[1:29:52] and they were attracted enough to come
[1:29:55] out and see
[1:29:57] this man Jesus Christ.
[1:30:01] I can tell you that it was not just it
[1:30:04] was not just her words, not just her
[1:30:06] testimony, but it was something that got
[1:30:09] a hold of them in her confession.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to this congregation,
[1:30:17] you actually have that power within you.
[1:30:21] It's beyond your words.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; It's telling how the candle got lit.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; And there's something that's uh
[1:30:29] attracting to it because people today
[1:30:32] don't have it.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; They don't have that peace. They don't
[1:30:37] have that assurance. The front the the
[1:30:41] it appears as though they do, but they
[1:30:44] don't have that. I had an experience
[1:30:46] right here in Vancouver.
[1:30:49] I was at a certain home and I was
[1:30:52] speaking about this message and what it
[1:30:56] brings to a person.
[1:30:58] And there was a man there. I remember he
[1:31:01] had beautiful cuff lengths. His cuff
[1:31:04] lengths were I think gold
[1:31:08] uh
[1:31:12] gold there,
[1:31:14] gold here. They were made out of gold.
[1:31:17] And I was admiring his cufflings. I
[1:31:19] thought that's very very nice. And he
[1:31:22] was so confident uh yeah he said you
[1:31:25] know that uh uh I I don't have any he
[1:31:29] didn't indicate any hunger whatsoever
[1:31:32] spiritually
[1:31:34] and he he taken care of things and he
[1:31:37] just
[1:31:38] I think he smoked his breast a few times
[1:31:41] and they had he had no concern about
[1:31:44] God.
[1:31:46] The next day
[1:31:49] he came to the home where I was had been
[1:31:51] speaking and knocked on the door and he
[1:31:55] said everything has just come to pieces.
[1:31:57] He didn't have anywhere to turn. He
[1:32:00] didn't have anywhere to turn. Here was a
[1:32:03] man who was in control. Here was a man.
[1:32:05] He had money. Here was a man. He had
[1:32:08] fine clothes. He had all of these
[1:32:10] things. He didn't have any appearance of
[1:32:12] being somebody who was in need, but he
[1:32:15] was in need, friends. So, I'm telling
[1:32:17] this congregation,
[1:32:19] you know, we may come well dressed to
[1:32:22] church and but God knows way deep down
[1:32:28] when there are things that
[1:32:31] uh you struggle with. There are things
[1:32:34] that are they are there when you sleep.
[1:32:38] And you might be saying, "But why are we
[1:32:42] why are you stressing on this, brother
[1:32:45] Biscll?" Because that is when God wants
[1:32:50] to make himself known to you
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; in the midst of difficulty.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; We don't want it. We don't want to think
[1:32:59] about it. We want to present ourselves
[1:33:02] as though, "Oh, I'm not bothered with
[1:33:04] that. Come on. Don't give me that. I'm
[1:33:07] going to come home now. I know you are.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I know you are.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; I know you're bothered with it. I know
[1:33:14] that it troubles you. It's on your face
[1:33:18] and you're it's in your quietness and
[1:33:20] you're troubled about your family.
[1:33:23] You're troubled about your children.
[1:33:25] You're troubled about life. You may be
[1:33:28] troubled about finances. You're troubled
[1:33:30] about your your children or whatever
[1:33:33] more. We all have it. But I want to say
[1:33:36] and I'm going to make a declaration. Our
[1:33:39] God,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; the God that I have met,
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; the God that I speak to you about is
[1:33:45] greater than the difficulties.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And there is no reason why we should
[1:33:52] allow those difficulties to hinder our
[1:33:55] walk to hinder our life with Christ.
[1:33:58] There's no reason whatsoever. And fact
[1:34:01] is some of you are perhaps afflicted
[1:34:04] with disease, afflicted with a problems
[1:34:07] and we we become uh we become concerned
[1:34:11] about it and our concerns rise and
[1:34:15] become dominant in our lives.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; They become dominant.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; God does not want them to be dominant.
[1:34:23] He wants to be dominant.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He wants to be greater than the
[1:34:27] difficulties. It it may seem to you,
[1:34:29] well, it's an impossibility.
[1:34:32] I struggled with these things for years.
[1:34:35] Well, I can tell you whether it be the
[1:34:39] whether it be the three that were cast
[1:34:42] to the furnace
[1:34:45] in Daniel's time.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; You think that just happened overnight?
[1:34:49] No. It was something that went on and on
[1:34:52] and on. There were restrictions. Well,
[1:34:54] you can't pray now or you got to bow
[1:34:57] down to this image. And there's there's
[1:35:00] uh uh some that believe that the image
[1:35:03] was even a image of Daniel. We don't
[1:35:07] know. They may make a great person out
[1:35:10] of you. They may make you the scum of
[1:35:13] the earth. It makes no difference with
[1:35:15] God when God says, "That's my son.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; That's my servant. That's the one I'm
[1:35:23] going to speak through.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what people think
[1:35:26] about him or about her. It makes no
[1:35:30] difference what they think about that
[1:35:31] family. That is one that I have chosen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to reveal myself to them and
[1:35:38] through them. And when God makes that
[1:35:41] decree, when he says who I have blessed,
[1:35:44] I have blessed. It doesn't matter what
[1:35:47] happens. Doesn't matter what kind of
[1:35:50] name. They gave a bad name to Jesus
[1:35:52] Christ.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Said, "We're not born of fornication."
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; I mean, they dug up the worst that they
[1:36:01] could. We're not born I'm not born We're
[1:36:05] not born of fornication, indicating he
[1:36:08] was born of fornication somehow. and it
[1:36:11] got out and whatever more. His his
[1:36:15] mother was carrying him before she was
[1:36:18] married and whatever more. Well, that's
[1:36:21] that's their view. That's not your view.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; But are you sure your view is correct? I
[1:36:27] have a thus sayeth the Lord
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; concerning that. And that's where my
[1:36:32] confidence is.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Our confidence is not that I have that
[1:36:37] opinion. Our confidence is not that this
[1:36:40] is what this church teaches. That's not
[1:36:43] our confidence. Our confidence is we
[1:36:46] have seen the glory of God. Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; I can tell you friends,
[1:36:54] the prophet of God said when it's
[1:36:57] revealed to a person, he said to the
[1:36:59] disciples when all these groups left and
[1:37:03] the ministerial association left, the
[1:37:06] ministerial association may have been
[1:37:09] the ministers,
[1:37:11] they may have held high positions in the
[1:37:14] churches those people went to. And when
[1:37:16] they were when they left, they said,
[1:37:19] "We'll have nothing to do with this."
[1:37:23] I just want to tell you things that I
[1:37:25] happen to know. When brother Brandham
[1:37:27] was speaking about the ministerial
[1:37:29] association, the associations at that
[1:37:33] time were
[1:37:36] uh
[1:37:38] very wretchedly poor.
[1:37:41] And even as they are today,
[1:37:45] I'm glad you don't have to go to some of
[1:37:49] the denominational churches. I'm glad
[1:37:51] you don't have to listen to
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; bands on the platform that play rock and
[1:37:58] roll.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as Christian
[1:38:01] rock and roll.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; You believe that? Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; There's no such a thing as somebody
[1:38:08] who's, you know, just living acceptable
[1:38:10] to the world. There's no such a thing.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; And one day that person, one day those
[1:38:17] individuals, whether they're here or not
[1:38:20] here, it's irrelevant to me, but one day
[1:38:23] they'll face the same God who wrote this
[1:38:26] book right here. Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; So I I want to just
[1:38:35] uh go go through several that he came
[1:38:39] down.
[1:38:44] Evil people, enemies had coming in and
[1:38:47] they came in with laws and regulations
[1:38:49] and and you weren't able to have wheat.
[1:38:56] You weren't able to have it. But Gideon
[1:38:58] had hid some.
[1:39:01] That doesn't look sound like a very good
[1:39:03] start, does it? But he had hid some and
[1:39:07] he was thrashing it. And then he saw an
[1:39:11] angel. He saw a man
[1:39:15] with a sword drawn.
[1:39:18] He wanted to know because there was
[1:39:19] something courageous within him. Are you
[1:39:22] for us or are you against us?
[1:39:26] He said to this man, that's pretty
[1:39:29] critical, isn't it?
[1:39:32] He said, "You're a valiant man."
[1:39:38] And God came down. I'm going to just end
[1:39:41] there. God came down and began to deal
[1:39:45] with and speak to speak through the
[1:39:48] angel of the Lord to Gideon. And Gideon
[1:39:53] ended up saying, "Do you think for a
[1:39:55] second, friends? I want to ask you and I
[1:39:58] want you to take it real seriously. Do
[1:40:01] you think for a second that he believed
[1:40:03] that he was going to be talking to God
[1:40:07] in a few moments and thinking, "I'm
[1:40:10] going to die because I've seen God."
[1:40:15] God knows exactly how to come to our
[1:40:19] situation or come to our address. He
[1:40:22] knows exactly what you already believe
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; and what you hold dear. And it comes to
[1:40:27] you that and you think, "Oh my goodness,
[1:40:30] I've done something terribly wrong." He
[1:40:33] knows how to do that. It come you catch
[1:40:36] you in your own confession.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he said and how they got a got
[1:40:47] a made a sacrifice and set it on fire
[1:40:51] and so on so forth. God was trying to
[1:40:54] find out and God did get him.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; God did get Daniel's not Daniel's but
[1:41:01] got Gideon's attention and brought a
[1:41:05] great victory. Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; He came down and spoke with Gideon,
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; which I said, and then he came down and
[1:41:15] and dealt with Hannah,
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:26] I know a little bit about
[1:41:29] what it's like
[1:41:31] when people want to embrace a child.
[1:41:37] And God doesn't allow it for whatever
[1:41:40] reason.
[1:41:42] I don't know what the reason is.
[1:41:47] But my words will go out over this
[1:41:49] pulpit
[1:41:51] and I may face them and I'm prepared to
[1:41:54] face them today or tomorrow or any time
[1:41:59] at God's great accountable time.
[1:42:05] But Hannah was so crushed. She wanted a
[1:42:10] child so bad.
[1:42:13] And her husband had two wives. And the
[1:42:16] first wife had given
[1:42:18] five children to him. And Hannah none.
[1:42:24] For God, the Bible says, had closed her
[1:42:28] womb.
[1:42:31] But in her
[1:42:33] in her crying and in her painful
[1:42:37] experience,
[1:42:41] she's up at Shiloh
[1:42:45] and and even before the priest Eli, he's
[1:42:48] observing her
[1:42:50] and she's not steady on her feet.
[1:42:55] She's under such grief.
[1:42:58] And he notices Eli notices her lips
[1:43:02] moving
[1:43:04] but no voice behind it.
[1:43:08] And he comes to her and says,
[1:43:12] "You're drunk."
[1:43:15] "No," she said, "I'm not.
[1:43:18] I'm griefstricken.
[1:43:23] I have no child."
[1:43:26] And she was so greasen.
[1:43:29] And she was saying, "If you give me a
[1:43:32] child,
[1:43:34] a manchild,
[1:43:36] I'll give him back to you.
[1:43:40] I'll lend him to you all of his life."
[1:43:45] She didn't know it. She was talking
[1:43:47] about Samuel.
[1:43:50] I'm trying to tell you about a God who
[1:43:53] knows a person even when they're so
[1:43:56] stricken.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; In grief,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; that they don't know what to do. They
[1:44:03] don't even know how to conduct
[1:44:05] themselves.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; They can't even be normal anymore.
[1:44:11] This is a real woman.
[1:44:14] One you're going to face.
[1:44:17] One you're going to see. You're going to
[1:44:19] see her offspring.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; What do you think about it, young
[1:44:24] people? You might say, "Well, I'm I'm
[1:44:27] I'm just a young age yet." Listen, in
[1:44:31] five minutes, you might be 21.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You could be on the other side in a few
[1:44:39] minutes.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; We all could.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you were just a few
[1:44:45] minutes ago. You were white-haired man.
[1:44:48] preaching at the pull pit.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Well, if we were on the other side,
[1:44:54] you'd say, "What's happened?" Well, this
[1:44:57] is what you always believed.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; You always believe this. This is what
[1:45:01] the messenger said.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Didn't you believe it?
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Well, well, yeah, I believed it. Then
[1:45:06] why are you shocked? Why are you
[1:45:08] surprised?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, friends, it's so real.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; It's so real.
[1:45:16] And I'm I'm speaking to you from my own
[1:45:20] heart, from my own experience.
[1:45:23] In fact, is I have told some people,
[1:45:28] I've written some people
[1:45:31] just in the last few days.
[1:45:34] And they think, oh, we just pray that
[1:45:38] God will give you strength and we just
[1:45:40] pray that God will give you health and
[1:45:42] I'm so thankful for that.
[1:45:45] So so thankful
[1:45:49] but I told
[1:45:53] a few people
[1:45:55] I cannot explain
[1:45:58] the peace
[1:46:00] that I have.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the last few years such
[1:46:05] peace and the peace never wavered
[1:46:09] till never wavered a moment that I was
[1:46:13] in a hospital
[1:46:15] downtown Vancouver
[1:46:17] and I did not know if I was going to
[1:46:19] come out of that room and I just said to
[1:46:22] myself,
[1:46:27] the book's already written.
[1:46:30] I didn't I wasn't saying, "God, let me
[1:46:32] go back. Let me rewrite this. Let me
[1:46:36] redo this. Let me go back and let me
[1:46:39] make it right. Let me go back and and uh
[1:46:44] explain something." No, I had peace that
[1:46:48] was greater than all of that.
[1:46:54] And then this one that came down
[1:46:58] came to my bedside.
[1:47:04] You might say, "Now you're real quiet."
[1:47:06] Now I brought it right down to today.
[1:47:11] I'm going to bring it right down where
[1:47:13] this messenger that saw thousands of
[1:47:16] miracles
[1:47:17] said to you, "The one I'm speaking of is
[1:47:21] not 5 ft from where I am right now."
[1:47:26] And that same person said
[1:47:29] that he's here now.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; He's here. And I want to say to you,
[1:47:36] either God is a complete
[1:47:39] uh hypocrite
[1:47:42] or he's true.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; And I want to say because I believe it
[1:47:48] within my heart and soul, he is true.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; And when he said many years ago, 20, 30,
[1:47:56] 40, 50 years ago, I believed that he is
[1:48:00] my peace. Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; I believed it when I was in St. Paul's.
[1:48:06] I believed it. He was my peace. But then
[1:48:11] what happened? The peace became an
[1:48:12] experience.
[1:48:15] I I wondered why do I have this peace?
[1:48:19] Don't I have anything? No, the record's
[1:48:22] been written.
[1:48:25] I thought, yep, the record's written. I
[1:48:28] have nothing to do and I have no
[1:48:31] regrets.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, friends, that's not
[1:48:36] the human guy that says I have no
[1:48:38] regrets.
[1:48:43] That's the one that has something is
[1:48:46] given to you at that moment. So I have
[1:48:49] no regrets.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Is all well. All is well.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:48:56] You know friends,
[1:49:01] you want to have that at that moment.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; All is well
[1:49:11] and I had uh something. It wasn't a
[1:49:14] voice,
[1:49:16] but something was going on inside.
[1:49:20] And it was so persistent.
[1:49:22] It was like a question was coming. I I
[1:49:26] couldn't tell you. Was it coming to my
[1:49:28] thoughts? Was it in my heart? Where was
[1:49:31] it? I don't know.
[1:49:33] But a question was coming very
[1:49:35] persistent.
[1:49:37] And the question was,
[1:49:40] I maybe have told you before, but the
[1:49:43] question was, where were you?
[1:49:48] I tried to maybe disregard it for a
[1:49:50] moment and says, where were you?
[1:49:54] Where were you?
[1:49:58] said, "Well, uh, where was I? I didn't
[1:50:01] understand the question.
[1:50:04] That's the way he is."
[1:50:07] And I'm going to read, "His ways are
[1:50:09] past finding out." That means that he
[1:50:13] works secretly.
[1:50:16] He works covertly.
[1:50:19] He works in a way that you think it's
[1:50:22] something else, but it's him.
[1:50:26] He works in a way that
[1:50:30] he doesn't even want he doesn't want to
[1:50:33] be found to be so obvious.
[1:50:38] So he works very covertly.
[1:50:44] He works secretly.
[1:50:48] He speaks and you don't know.
[1:50:54] Moses wasn't saying, "Well, I'm out
[1:50:57] here. I'm looking for a bush that's
[1:50:58] burning." No, it caught him unawares.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; The woman at the well,
[1:51:06] she wasn't expecting to see a Jew
[1:51:08] saying, "Give me the drink."
[1:51:15] She wasn't expecting that.
[1:51:18] I wasn't expecting
[1:51:20] anything. I wasn't expecting God to say,
[1:51:23] "I've come down to heal you."
[1:51:27] And it even took a while before, "But
[1:51:30] where were you?"
[1:51:33] before I even began to I I began to
[1:51:37] wonder, is that him?
[1:51:41] You know, when the prophet of God
[1:51:43] was brought down in Memphis, Tennessee
[1:51:47] in a snowstorm,
[1:51:50] he asked me the question.
[1:51:54] Do you know what caused brother Eddie?
[1:51:57] Do you know what caused the snowstorm?
[1:52:02] I couldn't answer because I didn't know
[1:52:04] what caused the snowstorm.
[1:52:06] He said it was that woman,
[1:52:09] a colored woman, a black woman. It was
[1:52:13] her love for her son
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; that causes snowstorm,
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; You know, it was that's beyond our human
[1:52:28] grasp. How could I put that together? I
[1:52:31] couldn't put that together.
[1:52:35] Now, that is God. You begin to
[1:52:38] understand God. That's God that's got
[1:52:41] control of things. If he wants a
[1:52:44] snowstorm, he brings a snowstorm.
[1:52:48] But God's concern was that woman,
[1:52:51] a black woman,
[1:52:54] her son dying on a bed, rolling back and
[1:52:58] forth.
[1:53:00] But brother Brandon comes out with a
[1:53:02] little, you know, here's the little
[1:53:04] things we do in life. He just made had
[1:53:07] written a a card and he wanted to find a
[1:53:09] place to mail the card. Isn't that
[1:53:12] natural? Isn't that something great
[1:53:15] supernatural thing? Have you all done
[1:53:17] that? I'm sure you have. And he's got a
[1:53:20] card. He comes down. He comes down to
[1:53:24] find a place. He comes out of the hotel
[1:53:26] and he wants to mail this card.
[1:53:29] And he comes to the edge of the sidewalk
[1:53:33] and this same one was talking to me
[1:53:36] in the hospital. Where were you? Saying
[1:53:39] to a prophet,
[1:53:42] just keep walking.
[1:53:45] He wondered
[1:53:47] if someone was He went He told me he
[1:53:50] went to the window in the store and he
[1:53:54] was looking in the dark dark window
[1:53:57] looking at the things in the window
[1:53:59] display and he went to the street curb
[1:54:02] again.
[1:54:04] Keep walking.
[1:54:07] Keep walking.
[1:54:09] It's still this woman's prayer.
[1:54:12] Keep walking.
[1:54:15] Just a little voice
[1:54:18] and that one
[1:54:20] standing
[1:54:23] in a hospital
[1:54:25] saying, "But where were you?"
[1:54:30] You know, God asks something, he won't
[1:54:33] leave it. He won't let it go. He just
[1:54:37] keeps at it.
[1:54:40] And I finally said, "Well,
[1:54:43] where was I? Where was I?" And it seemed
[1:54:45] like I needed to say something about
[1:54:48] it. It it it seemed that the one who was
[1:54:50] asking want to know, "Where were you
[1:54:53] when you were young?
[1:54:55] Where were you when you were a child?"
[1:54:58] These young people here.
[1:55:02] I was about eight or nine.
[1:55:09] But where were you?
[1:55:12] Now friends, this doesn't sound like
[1:55:14] it's a great spiritual thing, but I can
[1:55:17] tell you someday
[1:55:20] when you are at the very crux of your
[1:55:24] life. This is where you want to be,
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; where you want to be able to talk to
[1:55:28] him.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:34] some of the young men that were part of
[1:55:36] the Filipino group that were singing
[1:55:41] on the watch night service. They don't
[1:55:43] know, but I was sitting close to them
[1:55:46] and watching
[1:55:48] three. I asked brother,
[1:55:52] our deacon brother,
[1:55:55] who are they? And there were three of
[1:55:56] his children.
[1:56:01] I said, "Well, God was pleased with
[1:56:03] that."
[1:56:06] And so I was answering
[1:56:10] I was at
[1:56:13] I was a boy about 8 years old, maybe
[1:56:16] nine.
[1:56:18] I was at uh a place called 351 on the
[1:56:22] Alaska Highway. But where were you?
[1:56:26] And I could see that wasn't the answer.
[1:56:29] wasn't that wasn't the answer that
[1:56:32] whoever was asking that wanted.
[1:56:36] So then I said, "Well, I was at 375
[1:56:40] when I took the prophet of God up there.
[1:56:44] 351 to 375 is 24 miles."
[1:56:48] I said, "I was right close." Then I knew
[1:56:51] I was on the right track. And then, but
[1:56:55] where were you?
[1:56:57] And I said, "Well, we went in way into
[1:57:00] the mountains and then it all came to I
[1:57:03] said, but there
[1:57:06] my soul was troubled."
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:10] How long?
[1:57:12] Several years.
[1:57:17] Does God allow that? Apparently. So
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; You think I should know what a baptism
[1:57:27] in? I wanted to know what which is the
[1:57:31] way to baptize.
[1:57:33] What is the way to what about this God?
[1:57:37] Is he one? Is he two? Is he three? Is he
[1:57:41] What is he
[1:57:43] now? He's wanting to make himself You'll
[1:57:46] know who I am.
[1:57:50] And so then
[1:57:52] then a man speaks.
[1:57:55] I have the quote here friends where the
[1:57:58] Bible says or the prophet of God said
[1:58:03] that God took on human
[1:58:07] flesh, bones and flesh to make known the
[1:58:12] word of God.
[1:58:15] And so God had taken
[1:58:18] bones and flesh
[1:58:21] and I looked into his eyes
[1:58:24] said you have three qu he came to me
[1:58:28] that's why we sang before
[1:58:31] this service he came to me when I
[1:58:34] couldn't go to him
[1:58:37] I didn't know how to go to him he came
[1:58:40] to me I didn't understand him
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't know who who he was or how he
[1:58:47] make himself known to me anymore. Then
[1:58:51] who was it at the burning bush? Who are
[1:58:54] you?
[1:58:57] I am that I am.
[1:59:00] And you'll go now to Pharaoh. Pharaoh.
[1:59:02] Who am I to go to Pharaoh?
[1:59:05] And you'll say, "Let my people go."
[1:59:09] I God will be speaking through him,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; friends. And I looked
[1:59:17] and I don't want you to ever
[1:59:18] misunderstand me, but I saw God looking
[1:59:22] at me.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Not a man, but God.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Using his
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; using his form,
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; using the bones and the flesh and said,
[1:59:36] "He came to me."
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; And I believe you have three questions,
[1:59:41] friends. That's the one I'm talking
[1:59:43] about this morning. I spent this whole
[1:59:46] evening. He come down to find out not
[1:59:50] who can understand it. He come down even
[1:59:53] in the confusion. He come down to find
[1:59:56] out if that person will believe it.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you as a testimony, if I
[2:00:04] don't live any longer or don't speak
[2:00:06] another Sunday, it's perfectly fine with
[2:00:08] me. But I want to leave this testimony
[2:00:11] to this congregation. He found one and I
[2:00:15] believed it.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; I can't answer it. I cannot explain it.
[2:00:20] I'm like, that's why it means so much to
[2:00:22] me when he said of the disciples, they
[2:00:25] couldn't explain it. They didn't
[2:00:28] understand it. And I have to say to you,
[2:00:31] I don't understand it. I can't explain
[2:00:34] it. But I can tell you one thing. It is
[2:00:38] God. I say to my grandchildren, it is
[2:00:41] God. To my great grandchildren, it is
[2:00:44] God. It is God is speaking through those
[2:00:49] messages. And he says things and they
[2:00:52] said, "Will you also leave?" Jesus said
[2:00:55] to the disciples.
[2:00:57] And Peter said, "To whom will we go?
[2:01:03] Are you going to send me back to that
[2:01:06] cold formal church?
[2:01:09] No, not at all. He won't do that.
[2:01:14] Uh why are you doing this? Because I
[2:01:18] want you to be a testimony. I want you
[2:01:20] to tell the people that you will live
[2:01:23] the kind of life that they will believe
[2:01:25] in you. And so I say to you, if you have
[2:01:29] any trust in me, this is the God that
[2:01:33] you gave your life to. This is the God.
[2:01:37] He's supernatural, friends. He's not
[2:01:39] here to do just uh our wishes or our
[2:01:44] whatever, but he's here to do his will
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; and cause you to be a believer. And I'm
[2:01:51] glad that he has found in you a heart
[2:01:54] that believes the word of God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; You believe it. You support it.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; God bless the ministers that minister
[2:02:05] the word.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; And this is the one.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; I can tell you he's a reality.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; He's He's more real than a person. Yeah,
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; it's more real because when you're all
[2:02:19] alone,
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; brother Nathans, when you're alone, he
[2:02:23] just makes himself known to you.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; He's so wonderful. That is why it so
[2:02:30] touches me
[2:02:32] when a prophet will stand
[2:02:35] and in this case a woman stands 3 4 feet
[2:02:39] away
[2:02:41] and before he can start anything he just
[2:02:44] says isn't he lovely.
[2:02:47] That's a person who has some association
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; with the unseen
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; and that's what made
[2:02:58] You may hear us talk about William
[2:03:01] Brandon, but that's what made that man.
[2:03:04] A woman is in her dish pan and she's
[2:03:07] washing dishes, sees a little car drive
[2:03:10] up
[2:03:11] and outsteps a little man and
[2:03:14] immediately she begins to weep and cry.
[2:03:17] She doesn't know anything about the man.
[2:03:20] She doesn't know anything about his
[2:03:22] ministry. She doesn't know anything. But
[2:03:25] there just something flooding to her of
[2:03:28] the humility of Jesus Christ.
[2:03:31] But God is using a vessel. I tell you
[2:03:35] friends,
[2:03:37] this is a true statement.
[2:03:40] God
[2:03:41] took the man and dwelt in him and said
[2:03:47] words that he wanted us to hear.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Don't forget those words. Don't take
[2:03:54] them lightly and just say I am here. I
[2:03:58] am here because of that
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; because of whatever it was. We may not
[2:04:02] know fully what God is wanting to do but
[2:04:06] we say here am I
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; when I was in the midst of these
[2:04:20] thoughts and I'm going to close. I'm not
[2:04:21] even going to try to finish.
[2:04:25] When I was in the midst of these
[2:04:27] thoughts,
[2:04:29] I began to sing a song
[2:04:35] and I couldn't find it anywhere.
[2:04:39] And finally, we came across I'm going to
[2:04:41] ask
[2:04:46] if my girls would you help me. I wish I
[2:04:51] had a voice. I'd like to sing it to you.
[2:04:54] It's not a hymn just to sing a song.
[2:04:57] It's a question.
[2:05:04] And I'm going to give you the words.
[2:05:07] Who's that knocking
[2:05:16] calling?
[2:05:19] Is you want to get an answer from me?
[2:05:23] Have you had difficulty? Who's that
[2:05:25] calling?
[2:05:28] Who's that knocking,
[2:05:30] asking
[2:05:33] to come in? Maybe he wants to
[2:05:37] say something
[2:05:39] very personal to you, and I have no
[2:05:41] business intruding
[2:05:44] into that relationship.
[2:05:46] Oh, yeah. you you could just carry on
[2:05:48] with your life. I know that you'll go to
[2:05:51] school and you'll go to your studies.
[2:05:53] You'll go to your college. You'll go to
[2:05:55] your job.
[2:05:59] You'll go back and live your life.
[2:06:05] I pray you won't do that. I saw
[2:06:11] Were you singing here the other night?
[2:06:14] Watch night.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes,
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; you are.
[2:06:19] Who was beside you?
[2:06:24] Your sister?
[2:06:26] No. There was another boy
[2:06:32] who was singing here the other night.
[2:06:36] Would you just stand for me? I can't see
[2:06:38] you very well.
[2:06:43] And there was
[2:06:46] and yourself.
[2:06:51] There was three here. And then all of
[2:06:54] you Philippine people were singing.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something that
[2:07:03] probably you don't know. God was pleased
[2:07:06] with that.
[2:07:15] I thought of the Chinese group that were
[2:07:18] singing
[2:07:21] and I know some of them that were
[2:07:23] singing.
[2:07:25] But friends, that's all we want to do is
[2:07:27] please him.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; That's all we want to do is please him.
[2:07:35] Can we put these words up if you don't
[2:07:37] mind? I understand they're in the book
[2:07:39] now.
[2:07:41] I don't want you to sing it as a song.
[2:07:47] I've seen it.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Who is that calling
[2:07:55] for me
[2:07:57] to come?
[2:08:01] Come and be saved
[2:08:05] from sin.
[2:08:11] Who is that knocking
[2:08:15] at my
[2:08:17] heart's door
[2:08:21] wanting
[2:08:23] to be
[2:08:25] led in?
[2:08:31] Who is that following
[2:08:36] after
[2:08:38] me?
[2:08:41] Trling
[2:08:42] my sleep
[2:08:45] at night.
[2:08:50] Who is that asking for my
[2:08:57] poor heart?
[2:09:00] saying,
[2:09:02] "Come into
[2:09:04] the light."
[2:09:10] Who is that knocking
[2:09:15] calling,
[2:09:17] seeking?
[2:09:20] Who is that troubling
[2:09:24] my soul?
[2:09:29] Surely
[2:09:31] it is Jesus
[2:09:35] asking,
[2:09:37] pleading,
[2:09:40] wanting to make
[2:09:44] me whole
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; to to sing the chorus again.
[2:09:54] Whoever might have
[2:09:56] been listening to a the call of God,
[2:10:00] who is that?
[2:10:03] Who's that talking to me?
[2:10:07] Oh, I wish I could
[2:10:10] make it
[2:10:12] more clear to you.
[2:10:17] my soul
[2:10:19] reached out
[2:10:22] to the people of this congregation and I
[2:10:25] want to know
[2:10:27] maybe you've identified
[2:10:30] I don't know who it is but he's been
[2:10:32] calling me you've been calling me to a
[2:10:35] greater s
[2:10:38] dedication greater level of
[2:10:40] sanctification
[2:10:42] he's calling me
[2:10:45] He's calling me. And if you want to come
[2:10:47] and stand here, I'd like to have a word
[2:10:50] of prayer with you.
[2:10:52] If you'll sing the chorus once again.
[2:10:54] Who is that knocking?
[2:10:59] Who is that knocking
[2:11:05] calling,
[2:11:07] seeking?
[2:11:10] Who is thy troubling
[2:11:14] my soul?
[2:11:20] Surely
[2:11:22] it is Jesus
[2:11:26] asking,
[2:11:28] pleading,
[2:11:31] wanting
[2:11:32] to make
[2:11:35] me whole.
[2:11:42] Sometimes we don't know
[2:11:46] as the Shunomite woman.
[2:11:49] She said there's a holy man.
[2:11:52] He didn't know who he was.
[2:11:57] Elijah the prophet.
[2:12:01] There's a holy man.
[2:12:03] Can we do something for him?
[2:12:06] There's a holy man.
[2:12:17] Lord Jesus,
[2:12:20] I'm unworthy to present
[2:12:23] these bloodwashed
[2:12:26] saints to you.
[2:12:29] But you have seen
[2:12:32] their life footsteps.
[2:12:35] You saw them take their first steps,
[2:12:37] first steps
[2:12:39] as children.
[2:12:41] And now, oh God,
[2:12:44] on down through life.
[2:12:47] There are so many things in this life
[2:12:50] that we cannot explain and we cannot
[2:12:54] understand. But one thing we know, we
[2:12:57] know collectively, I know, and all of
[2:13:00] these that are standing here know that
[2:13:03] we heard a voice from another place.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; And you were calling me.
[2:13:11] I didn't know where I'm going exactly.
[2:13:15] I didn't know. I couldn't explain it.
[2:13:19] And many things have happened that I
[2:13:22] cannot explain.
[2:13:24] But oh God, I do know and I'm standing
[2:13:28] here as a witness that I believe that
[2:13:32] you know. And not only do you know, but
[2:13:35] you are near. Your messenger said you're
[2:13:40] in the building right at that moment.
[2:13:43] And I know that you are I know that you
[2:13:46] are in this building right at this
[2:13:48] moment. I know that you have been
[2:13:51] talking. I know that you've been
[2:13:53] speaking and I know God as your prophet
[2:13:58] has said and it's not just a phrase but
[2:14:01] he said God loved the people and he
[2:14:05] wanted to make himself known to them.
[2:14:09] You love, oh God, the people. I do not
[2:14:12] understand
[2:14:14] your love. And I don't understand how
[2:14:17] prevailing it is. And it goes down below
[2:14:22] all of the difficulties. It Lord Jesus,
[2:14:26] Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus. And so I pray
[2:14:29] just now for everyone that is standing
[2:14:32] here. Oh God, men, women, young people,
[2:14:37] older people,
[2:14:39] I pronounce, oh God,
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; your eternal blessings upon them.
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray when they rise in the
[2:14:48] morning,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; they rise with peace.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; When they lay their head upon the pillow
[2:14:53] this evening,
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; they will leave their head upon the
[2:14:58] pillow. Lay their head there in peace,
[2:15:01] oh God. peace that passes all
[2:15:04] understanding.
[2:15:06] Oh father, in the holy name of Jesus
[2:15:10] Christ, I say we have come.
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; They have come with purpose.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; They have come, oh God, to gather
[2:15:19] together as one people, Father,
[2:15:23] throughout this congregation.
[2:15:27] I say
[2:15:29] we say we heard your voice.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; We've heard you calling.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; We've heard you speaking to us.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; We've heard you asking,
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, and I say, Lord Jesus, take me.
[2:15:44] Take all that I am and all that I ever
[2:15:47] can be. Cause my words to be a witness
[2:15:51] for you, Lord Jesus. life isn't even
[2:15:54] long enough, but I pray that you'll give
[2:15:58] energy to my words and my testimony
[2:16:03] in Jesus Christ's name. May it be
[2:16:06] fruitful
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; in your kingdom. We pray
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, God.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:19] Thank you.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say, could you sing, I'm
[2:16:25] giving my life away,
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; laying my all on the altar.
[2:16:44] Give my life
[2:16:46] away.
[2:16:51] laying it down on the altar.
[2:16:57] Now I give my life
[2:17:02] away.
[2:17:07] The very least I can offer
[2:17:12] is my own.
[2:17:19] So here I stand
[2:17:22] today
[2:17:25] giving my life
[2:17:28] away.
[2:17:34] I'm
[2:17:36] giving my life
[2:17:39] away.
[2:17:45] Down on the altar.
[2:17:49] Now I'm giving my life
[2:17:53] away.
[2:17:58] The very least I can offer
[2:18:03] is my own.
[2:18:10] So here I stand
[2:18:13] today
[2:18:16] giving my life
[2:18:18] away.
[2:18:26] You know the scripture.
[2:18:30] You believe Jesus,
[2:18:32] don't you?
[2:18:34] Said when the son of man cometh,
[2:18:38] shall he find faith on the earth? And
[2:18:41] the prophet says he didn't say shall he
[2:18:44] find righteousness
[2:18:45] right shall he find faith.
[2:18:49] And friends I am saying to you that's
[2:18:52] why
[2:18:54] he came.
[2:18:56] That's He has come. He has come. We are
[2:19:00] in it
[2:19:02] and people don't recognize it.
[2:19:05] So many passed him by.
[2:19:08] I've been feeling such a heaviness.
[2:19:12] So many passed him by
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; and they didn't realize what was
[2:19:17] actually throbbing in the heart of Jesus
[2:19:21] Christ which was God is throbbing in the
[2:19:24] heart
[2:19:27] that's why he said
[2:19:30] give me your heart my son
[2:19:34] give me your heart give me your heart my
[2:19:37] daughter
[2:19:39] give me your heart.
[2:19:42] Whenever you need to call on him,
[2:19:47] he will be very near
[2:19:49] that time.
[2:19:52] Heavenly Father,
[2:19:57] says lovely people,
[2:20:00] they're here saying something to you.
[2:20:03] They're expressing their hearts to you.
[2:20:07] They're expressing, oh God, their faith
[2:20:09] to you.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; They believe it. I believe, Father.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying with them and I'm saying
[2:20:20] and I'm making a declaration in public
[2:20:24] today at the beginning of this year of
[2:20:28] 2019.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; I say, "My Jesus,
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; I love thee.
[2:20:34] Thou art greater than all of my needs.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; My Jesus, I love thee.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
[2:20:47] Oh God. Oh God.
[2:20:50] Greater than life. Greater than breath.
[2:20:54] Oh God.
[2:20:56] As David said, you are greater to me.
[2:20:59] You are more to me than my daily life.
[2:21:02] my daily bread.
[2:21:04] Oh God. Oh God. My Jesus. Whatever you'd
[2:21:10] like to do in this message, raise this
[2:21:13] church up to be. Oh father, a
[2:21:16] lighthouse. I pray a lighthouse where
[2:21:20] people will know I can come there and be
[2:21:23] deliverance and have deliverance. I can
[2:21:26] come there. Those people will pray.
[2:21:29] Their God shall hear and I shall be
[2:21:33] healed.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; I shall be delivered.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, be glorified.
[2:21:40] Be glorified. I pray.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; My Jesus, I love thee. I know thou art
[2:21:46] mine.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; My Jesus,
[2:21:53] I love
[2:21:56] thee.
[2:21:58] I know
[2:22:00] thou are mine.
[2:22:05] For thee
[2:22:08] all the holy
[2:22:14] of sin
[2:22:16] I resign.
[2:22:21] My grace
[2:22:24] shall be redeemed.
[2:22:28] Oh myior
[2:22:33] art thou
[2:22:37] if ever
[2:22:41] I love
[2:22:43] thee. My Jesus
[2:22:49] is now.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord.
[2:22:55] Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:23:01] Ever. I love thee, my Jesus. It's now
[2:23:05] where here. Take me, Lord.
[2:23:37] Just while you're standing here quietly
[2:23:39] in prayer,
[2:23:42] I want to say something to you.
[2:23:45] It's from my heart to your heart.
[2:23:48] It's not always easy to surrender,
[2:23:53] to surrender everything,
[2:23:57] surrender our future,
[2:24:00] surrender our time,
[2:24:04] surrender.
[2:24:06] A man
[2:24:08] went into a hospital room
[2:24:12] and his baby was in there dying with
[2:24:15] leukemia.
[2:24:20] And the prophet of God said, "It's a
[2:24:22] killer."
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; And the doctor said,
[2:24:29] cuz the old man, he was an old man, he
[2:24:32] was a grandfather.
[2:24:36] And he said to the doctor, "I I respect
[2:24:39] you.
[2:24:40] I respect your science.
[2:24:43] I respect your medical work."
[2:24:48] But he said, "I have to go to pray."
[2:24:53] And he left the room, the examination
[2:24:56] where they were in the hospital,
[2:24:59] and he went and he prayed.
[2:25:02] And brother Brandham said when he came
[2:25:05] out the sweat was on his brow
[2:25:10] because he had agonized
[2:25:12] not in sorrow
[2:25:15] and he separated himself from his
[2:25:18] daughter
[2:25:20] from his son-in-law
[2:25:23] and he got alone with God.
[2:25:27] And when he came out he surrendered
[2:25:29] everything. He said, "I surrendered
[2:25:31] everything."
[2:25:34] And when I took that word, he
[2:25:36] surrendered everything. And the prophet
[2:25:38] said,
[2:25:40] "That's why faith could come in. He
[2:25:43] surrendered everything. Surrendered all
[2:25:46] that he was." And he surrendered all of
[2:25:48] his plans and surrendered. He wouldn't
[2:25:51] have anything to do with his family
[2:25:53] right then. And when he came out, he
[2:25:57] said he knew that he had surrendered
[2:25:59] everything
[2:26:01] and he said to the doctor, "I respect
[2:26:03] you, but God has healed the child."
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; Friends, there is a place
[2:26:12] where the anchor holds.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; There is a place where the anchor will
[2:26:19] not give any will not even give a
[2:26:22] twitch. Yes,
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; the anchor holds.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; And that's why I wanted to have this
[2:26:28] service to you with you today to know
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; We want to we want to be a creditless
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; to this message.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; And if this message is an uncompromising
[2:26:44] message,
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; then our success is certain.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; God will hear us. And if God doesn't
[2:26:52] answer the way you want it answered,
[2:26:56] he'll do his own will, his own way, and
[2:27:00] his people will say, "You're the God of
[2:27:03] truth.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; You have done all things well."
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; And we believe this testimony.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; And I am unmovable, unshakable.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; In it, my Jesus, I love thee. I know
[2:27:18] thou art mine. Please
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; just singing in a closing prayer.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; I know
[2:27:32] thou art mine,
[2:27:35] Lord Jesus. For thee
[2:27:40] all the fallies
[2:27:44] of sin.
[2:27:47] I reign.
[2:27:51] Oh my gracious
[2:27:56] redeemer,
[2:28:00] my savior.
[2:28:08] If ever
[2:28:12] I
[2:28:19] is
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; and I want to say to him, if ever I
[2:28:25] loved him,
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; if ever I loved you, Jesus,
[2:28:31] my savior, it is now.
[2:28:33] I say to you, God bless you.
[2:28:37] God bless you all.
[2:28:39] God grant you the desires of your heart
[2:28:42] and may they be godly desires.
[2:28:46] God bless you in the name of Jesus
[2:28:49] Christ.
[2:28:54] Amen.
[2:28:55] Amen.
[2:28:58] God bless you. I thank you for your
[2:29:00] love, devotion.
[2:29:05] Why don't you greet one another?
[2:29:08] I'll bless you, brother Todd.
[2:29:11] God bless you, brother.
[2:29:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:17] I'll bless you, brother Matthew.
[2:29:27] It's all true.
[2:29:46] You're all dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:30:11] J.
[2:32:12] Jesus
[2:32:34] alone.
[2:32:54] 2
[2:33:03] 3
[2:33:12] Hallelujah.
