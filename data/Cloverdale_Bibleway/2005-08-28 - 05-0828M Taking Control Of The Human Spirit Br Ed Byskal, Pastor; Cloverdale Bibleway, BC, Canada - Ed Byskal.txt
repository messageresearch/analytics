Looks like most of you. I was just thinking this morning reading uh in the Psalms and uh David said in Psalm chapter 4, there be many that say, "Who will show us any good? Lord, lift up the light of thine countenance. Thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased." You know, people win the lottery, right? Are they glad? Oh, yeah. But David said, "Here, thou hast put gladness in my heart more than when their goods are increased." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you should be happier this morning than somebody who has won the lottery, you know, who just put a lot of money in the bank. Say, he said, David said, "And if you don't have it, it's there for you." How many you've got that joy this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh stand together. We can sing. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter his court with praise.

And I will say the day that the Lord has made I will come. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. Hallelujah. He has made me glad. Oh, I'm glad. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. I feel he made me glad. He has made me. He has made me glad. He made me glad because he has made me glad. He has made me glad. He has made me glad. He made Thank you, Lord. I know that he has made me glad. He have made me glad. He has made me glad. Oh yes, he has been glad. He made me glad. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a song I was thinking about this morning after uh Zephaniah spoke Friday night and we've been talking about standing up. Amen. Faith is a victory. Here's number 2468.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to your name, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Praise God. And I'm going to ask our brother John Andy's. Brother John, if you come for the service in a word of prayer. Got a number of requests here this morning and uh a couple of testimonies. Sister Lana says, "I had chronic fatigue for months and it was getting worse, but I went up to get prayed for and I am healed." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. Sister Aaron Macaulay, I want to thank the Lord for returning my car that was stolen. There were no expenses and very little damage. Thankful. Brother Jonathan Nash wants us to pray for a co-orker and co-orker's wife need a touch of healing. Uh he has a chance to witness to both of them. Would like the Lord to use this for his glory. Father Tom Fre is requesting prayer for Nicole and Jonathan Frey who are at home not well. It's a request uh that we pray for a young man that wants to be delivered from drugs that he may come to know his deliverer. We want to remember in prayer this morning our brother Mike Cosino. He uh went in for surgery for a quadruple bypass. I understand he's doing uh much better and uh but he's still in the hospital. We just want to pray that the Lord would just completely touch him. Amen. Um, Sister Bev Charman is asking that we pray for um, Emily Drake as she's sick at home this morning. Um, Sister Sue Giri says, "Our daughter's best friend was killed in a car accident, leaving four young children. We pray uh, that the father would draw close to the Lord for strength." And sister Roxanne is requesting that we remember her dad uh brother Emile Bessie uh in prayer. His PSA levels have risen again and the doctor said there's nothing they can do. Uh the chemo is not working so they've quit all treatments. Um he has a bone scam on the 14th of September. So I want to remember him this morning. Amen. And if you've got a need this morning, if you're listening in over the internet on the phones and you've got a need, you need a touch from the Lord or whatever that need would be, you just lift before him as we go to prayer. Brother John, if you'd come, [Music] let's just accumulate all of our faith together and touch the Lord this morning. Father, we want to lift up our hands, Lord, in your presence. We want to lift up our hearts and acknowledge your workings among us in our lives. Our lives are but a vapor. All of our lives in this building, the lives out on the internet, those on the phone hookup that are joining in faith right now, they're miracles. Lord, you've done such great things for us. And we this morning want to say how great is our God. There is no God like you. There is no one like you. We approach you this morning with hearts of faith. Believing that all things are possible. Believing that your spirit is moving inside of your body, inside of your people. There's healing in the body. There's deliverance in the body. The Holy Spirit's working in your body. Father, how great thou art. You've been so wonderful to us, Jesus. Our mind is just going through the times. How you've dealt with us sovereignly. the supernatural hand, even what we feel now in this building, your spirit upon us. We just want to surrender right now and yield every thought, every part of our lives. Our souls are before you. Our spirits are before you. Our bodies are before you. We need you this morning, Jesus. Would you come by this way, Lord? We invite your spirit. We invite your presence. We invite your healing touch. We invite your hand to be able to move mountains that we cannot move. We Lord invite you into situations that seem impossible. But nothing is impossible for you. These temples, these houses are for your dwelling place and where Satan has invaded, where affliction has come in, where disease has come in, where sin has come in. We resist the enemy. We resist Satan and his powers of darkness. The evil hand of the crab fingers that would try to put cancer upon the believers, try to come into families and divide them. Anything that would take away oneness in the family is not of you. So we stand against it this morning. We stand against any spirit in the assembly this morning that would be opposite or different from your presence. having full impact, having full sway, doing miracles, even yet while we hear the word. Father, just reading this morning a testimony. Someone that didn't have hands laid on them, somebody that didn't even come up in a prayer line, but even yet while they heard the word, you did a miracle in their lives. Father, you can fill us with your Holy Spirit. Even standing here in your presence, we empty out ourselves. We die to ourselves. our thoughts. Let them leave us that the thoughts of Jesus Christ would come freely in. Lord, we're laying hands on these requests. We're holding them in our hands. They were written out by believers. Lives that believe that you can move on the scene. Unspoken requests are in the hearts of people. There's believers right in this service that are afflicted. Lives that are burdened. Jesus, our lives are before you. We are your victory. We're inviting you to come on the scene in these situations, in these issues, in our lives, and have the victory over Satan. Have the victory over the sickness. Have the victory over the darkness. Every seed, Lord, is coming to its place. The last ones are coming in. We're burdened, Lord, for the moving of your spirit. Soften lives. Bring them into the inner veil. This morning's service is an opportunity for all of us to take another step into your divine presence where all things are possible. Give us faith, Lord, to speak within our hearts. Give every life here rapturing faith to speak and all things are possible. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, these requests are many. And Lord, I pray as they were read out, Lord, and those that we're just asking you to come on the scene in these men and these women, in these families, in these lives. Be with our brother Tony this morning in India, with our brother DDA in New York, Lord. Be with the body of Jesus Christ around the world. We're waiting and we're longing for the hour when services like this will just continue on and on and on. meetings that we've been having will be just our our ordinary atmosphere. We won't have to go back into a life of of working and living out in sin. We're going to a land where there is no sin, where there is no heartache. There won't be any prayer requests there. There won't be any lost loved ones there. They'll be saved, perfect bodies. But while we're here, we still give you glory. While we're in this pest house, there's a theophony that's moving. There's a faith realm that we're still believing, Father, that you're among us. Nothing can stand before the prayers of your believers. Be with brother Peter Briner this morning. Father, I pray the cancer within his body would be afraid of the very presence of your own healing touch. that the molecules and the atoms and the cells would come back and there ought to be condition that our brother Peter would give a testimony behind this pulpit that he has totally delivered in the name of Jesus Christ. We claim his healing as a body of believers. One that has prayed for us. One that has stood in the gap for us. We pray for him and may the enemy lose his grip upon this seed of God's life and every life that's here. May tonight this morning's service be a moment we can enter in further and deeper into your presence in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us be aware, Father, of your presence. Let us move into that atmosphere. I'm just asking for this meeting this morning that you would just move in a realm that Lord that is further than what we can even ask for or think or even anticipate. men and women are joining our hearts together for the supernatural element to be turned on even now within our lives. Bless the minister. Let the glory of God so be transmitting into our souls that he would not even be able to minister. Glory cloud come down among us. Change lives and move us into that presence in Jesus name. We thank you already for what you're doing. Lord, we praise your holy name. We lift you up, Father, above the circumstance, above the situation, above every issue, above principalities, above powers. We crown you this morning in Jesus name. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you may be seated. Our sister uh Marilyn Brown has a song for us. Sister Marilyn, why don't you come? And uh we've just got uh couple of announcements. Uh there is a dark blue car, Washington plates 585. I don't know what happened to the rest of the license plate number, but if that's part of your license plate number and it's dark blue, your lights are on. Um, we want to welcome all those who are visiting with us. And, uh, special uh, welcome to Brother Jack and Sister Mary Hefernon and Sisterh Rebecca. We'll get you to stand. It's been a while since they're here, man. God bless you. It's good to see you. Sister Mary is a sister to brother Alan King and I know he's always happy when they come out to visit. We've had wonderful fellowship with them over the years. Um as well uh the specials uh people have been asking specials to date for 2005. Uh and they're available at the office if uh if you'd like. Mr. [Music] Yesterday things were different. Today they're different. Jesus [Applause] will never never change. Jesus is always the same. The sparrow will find a new dwelling. The eagle will change his nest. But I'm holding on to the changeless one. And I'm leaning on his breath. A river will change its course and mountain may crumble and fall. Time will leave his birth they say upon us one and all. Yesterday things were different and today they're different again. Jesus will never never change. Jesus is always the same. Jesus [Applause] will never never change. Jesus is always the same. [Applause] Thanks, Sister Marilyn. Aren't you glad that Jesus is always the same? &gt;&gt; Everything's changing around us. In fact, they say business now, that's the only thing that's certain is change. &gt;&gt; But our heavenly father never changes. Amen. We're going to turn to the word at this time. I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Let's sing it together. For I was born to be a dwelling place, a home for the presence of the Lord. Oh, let my life now be separated unto me. But I be what I was born to be. For I was born to be well [Music] for the rest of the Lord in my life. I'll be separated on to thee that I might be what I was born. [Music] Sing it again. For I want to be a great [Music] presence of the Lord. I now be separated to thee that I might be [Music] born to thee. Mercy be my God. [Music] Oh, his word feeds my life and I should have fall in my soul. Cast down by mercy ro your testimony this morning. Oh, I know that mercy. He rewrote my life. Mercy re my life [Music] down all in my soul cast. [Music] And let's sing it again. testimony. Mercy re [Music] my [Music] fallen. My soul cast down thy mercy rero my life. Would you like to stand as we sing it once again? Mercy reroll my life. Mercy rule my life. Oh, I should have fallen my soul cast down. What mercy my heart? &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. going to have you sit back down again for a few moments before we read the word. We're just so thrilled at uh the reports and the things that are taking place. Our brother Mike Cosalino, he had operation yesterday, I believe it was. And maybe brother Tom you would just tell him you brother Tom visited him and brother Mike went in for an operation. He went in uh first of all because of his blood pressure was up. They cleared two of the veins in his neck and felt that they uh were ready to go in. They were going to give him a double heart bypass but they deemed it necessary to give him a quadruple heart bypass. And um they went in on and operated. It was a total success. Yesterday he had a tough day. This morning I walked in early. He's sitting up in the chair. Sister Ameilia, he's just happy. He says, "When I get out of here," he says, "We're going to turn the world upside down." Amen. All is well. He's doing it. The Lord, Brother Jim Hayes, I gave your testimony the other night uh in Friday night's service. I didn't know if you were going to be back, but I want I I would like to have you uh come up and uh just briefly tell us what what happened and uh and that what God did for you. Uh if you do that, uh I said on Friday night, and I want to reinforce this morning, the prophet said that in his presence, the supernatural is happening. It's not something that you have to manufacture. It's not something that you can uh invent. It's just something that God does. And uh and and God is a giver of life. And we don't know, you know, God sometimes uses uh doctors and hospitals and all the rest of it. We're not opposed to that, but we are I'm much more in favor &gt;&gt; and we're believers, so we want to believe. You know, God's word is preached and the people believe it. Prayer is made and the people believe it. So, just come by brother Jim and see what we want to give God the glory. I'm I'm very very very insistent that we give God the glory. When we ask for something, then he does it. We want to be sure and give him the glory. Brother Jim, God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh, Brother Brown liked to brag on uh on Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But he said that he he didn't want to brag on any more that he did or any less that he did. Uh, I had this thing on my nose for a couple years. It had been misdiagnosed, been frozen a couple times, and then started to alter the tissue of the nose. I went into a specialist that did a biopsy. He said, "You got cancer. I want you to deal with it by August. You have three choices. You can do 15 treatments of radiation. You know, it's five days on, two days off." And I'm thinking, well, I wasn't too motivated about that. I was trying to figure it in how I could fit it into my schedule and fishing and everything, you know, and then the other choice was that they just going to just take a big chunk out of your nose and rebuild it. And I wasn't too excited about that. And then there was this one person in Watt Watcom County that did a particular procedure called Moe's surgery and uh named after the person who developed it and they they go in there just slice real thin and then you sit in a chair and they go out and look at it under the scope come back take another slice and they do that until they get it all that the purpose being to you know kind of mitigate the loss of tissue and so forth. But um so I dragged my feet of course and then had it scheduled towards the end of August here on this past Thursday and then I realized there was no service on Wednesday. So I I uh bolted up here to uh have some prayer because I was you know I was feeling a little timid about it because or insignificant in light of uh some of the other issues with and needs with some of the other people in the assembly. But uh nevertheless, I uh told brother Tom that I you know, I just assume avoid the uh you know the skin patches and the the plugs and the rebuilding and the cosmetic surgery and all that stuff. And uh so he said, "Sure, let's go into the office." And there was brother Ed and brother DJ and brother John. And uh we went into the uh office and when we started to pray and in my mind I had had uh the thought that you know Lord I just don't want it to be very deep because they were talking about the size of a quarter on one side and you know that was who knows how deep it was going to be and it was basically half the nose. So in my mind I'm thinking I I Lord I just you know don't let it be very deep. And his brother Ed started to pray. Um he said Lord let that cancer go back to where it come and he said let him not find anything. And so I found myself saying amen. you know, so as I went into the office, I as I was driving to the office, I was, you know, quite impressed by the the prayer and continued to think about it and um you know, I just I found myself wanting to say something something, you know, when I went in there and something profound, you know, and which is not usually my mode of operation or my style or my comfort level, whatever, but maybe perhaps uh you know, our style and our comfort level is a hindrance to us, &gt;&gt; you So, so I'm sitting in the chair, the surgery chair, and in walks the doctor and his entourage, you know, the physician's assistant, the the nurse, and u just immediately I said real directly, I said, "Uh, brother Dor, uh," I says, "Dr. Dohy," he says, "Um, do you feel good this morning?" He looks at me, he says, "Yeah, I feel good." I says, "Good. I feel good, too. I I just had a meeting yesterday with four men, and I said this real directly, you know, and I just kind of I just want to say something. I want to throw myself out there where the prayer was at. You know what I mean? And um I said, "I just had a meeting with four men yesterday, four mighty men of valor, servants of Christ." And and then when my pastor prayed, he prayed that that cancer would go back to where it come from and you wouldn't find anything, you know. So that went over like a lead brick. He just kind of looked at me. Okay. you know. So, I lean back and he does his thing and uh he says, "Okay, relax. I'll be back in 30 minutes." So, I'm sitting there leaning back and I'm thinking, "Wow, Lord, I really impressed him with that, didn't I?" And um he comes back in 5 minutes. He says, "Well, um we didn't see anything on a perimeter or or any on that slice, so obviously this is the type that isn't in the core, so we're going to go after the core now." console and they come they make their second slice and says see you in 30 to 40 minutes so just relax okay well he comes back in 10 minutes he says well and this just really impressed me he says the power of prayer is something isn't it this is what the doctor said to me &gt;&gt; he says we didn't find anything &gt;&gt; so there you go now you know brother Ed said we don't want a camp experience. We want a Holy Ghost experience. We want to continue on that and see God fulfilling his purpose in our life. And that's moving and expressing his victory in us. And I I just, you know, praise God. And uh thank you very much. &gt;&gt; I'd say it was more Brother Jim's confession to the doctor than even was our prayer. That was his confession. and he moved on his confession and the hol and the Holy Spirit then the Lord Jesus had to move as the high priest on that confession. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't God wonderful? &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, it's your turn. &gt;&gt; Where God is, &gt;&gt; supernatural is happening. &gt;&gt; How long you been married, brother Jason? &gt;&gt; Eight years. &gt;&gt; Eight years. Okay. I don't get nervous. I'm nervous. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Well, if I'm extra happy, you all know why. If you don't, Bible ways not doing good with this rumor. Well, wife and I are going to be parents. We want to thank the Lord for that. Amen. As uh brother Ed said, how long's been we've been married? We've been married for eight years. And and uh the Lord just did something really special for Emmy and I about two and a half years ago. Uh we finally figured out something was wrong and we went uh talked to Brother Ed and Brother Ed then says, "Well, give me a couple of days and I'll get back to you." and and then he uh he called us and he says well actually sister Ruth called us and said brother Ed would like to have he's right now he'd like to have prayer with you. So, uh, he had prayer with he, uh, actually called us in the back study. Then he says, "Jace, if you get brother Tom also and, uh, because they had the same same problems, my wife and I." And brother Tom and, uh, Brother Red, my wife and I went to back study and we had prayer. And that was 2 and a half years ago. That was actually on November 10th, uh, 2002. And if you have your Bibles, uh, let's turn to Mark 11. And we'll start with, uh, verse 23. And this was, uh, a scripture brother, brother brother Ed gave us. Actually, it's the 24th scripture that 24th verse that brother Ed gave us. But I'm going to go back to number 23. It says,"For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatever he saith." And now, this is the 24th verse that Brother Ed gave us. Therefore, I say unto you, what what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that ye receiveth them. And I underlined this. And ye shall have them. &gt;&gt; Well, that was two and a half years ago. And uh this was actually back when brother Perry Green was here. And he brought remember those prayer cloths? Well, Brother Red uh cut one of those off and gave that to my wife. And she carried that with her for that amount of time, believing uh every day that the Lord was going to give her a child. And uh I know a lot of people are saying, "Well, why are you telling everybody it's only been six weeks?" Well, when God gives America, I don't care if it's six weeks or we have to wait for three months. I'm just going to tell her. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um she was carrying that, you know, always believing and me, you know, I don't know, being a doubter, you know, well, what what if what if God, you know, what if we don't get a child? Maybe we're supposed to be with a Tony. And Sister Rebecca, maybe God has got something more for us because I know every desire of a of a wife is is to to have a have a children. And she says, "No, I'm not accepting that." And uh bless her little heart. And and so back, let's jump up now to where we are now. And brother Tom, how many remember this service? Brother Tom said, "Remember your confess. Have a confession. I want you to stand up and confess it." Well, you know, my wife always bugs me because I don't always tell her everything, but you know, I think this is a good time. So, honey, if you don't mind, I'm going to tell everybody and tell you at the same time. Uh she usually says, "That's how I find out everything about you, so I might as well keep the ball rolling." Well, brother when brother Tom said that, you know, I stood up and said, "I want a deliverance because there's something that I had been fighting for for 18 years." And and then my wife, she stands up and says, "I want a baby. I'm claiming that baby." And then when we had uh on at camp on uh the Saturday when when our brother Spencer called everybody up, you know, I just had most supernatural experience that I I've I haven't had in a long time. And uh I knew I was free and and for the my wife, she didn't know this, but she was expecting already. And uh and so for me, I guess everything's got to line up. You know, you know, the husband's got to be right in his place and so on and so forth. And that Saturday, uh for me, it was it was a supernatural time. And I knew that I had reached where I wanted to be. And uh then Sunday, you know, Brother Ron Spencer preached, you know, talking about the wife and how she goes through and every my wife says she was laughing like crazy, you know, she's getting heartburn and the whole nine yards and uh and she didn't know she was expecting. And so Monday we uh she she had been experiencing these different things and and so you know she was talking to her sister in Indiana and her sister says, "Well, those are the exact same symptoms I've had. you know, when I was expecting, you know, feeling sick at weird times of the day. And uh, of course, I didn't clue in, but uh, I said, "Okay." So, she calls me and she says, "Well, Jason, should we go get a test? Should we do this?" And I said, "Well, you know, why not? You know, let let's do this." And, uh, so we did. And and so, uh, looking there, she was depressed. Wasn't showing right then. And I'm looking at it and I saw a faint line. And uh I said, "Honey, I I think I I think you are." She goes, "No, you better not be kidding with me." I'm not. Uh and so then I said, then I went into the living room and I said, "Well, I'm not going to I'm not going to get excited yet until the doctor says so." And uh then next day we went into the doctors and sure enough, the doctor confirmed it. And uh and of course I'm excited. And then uh and then we went and told our my mom and dad and and uh my dad gets that little weird Yeah. Right. smile because I was really quick about it. I I told him I said I said uh we were in the middle of conversation. I you're always wondering how are you going to tell your parents? And uh so I was really quick. I said I got good news and bad news. They both stopped. I said well the bad news is that I got to get at 4:30 in the morning. Good news is you're going to be grandparents. Oh, like I said, my dad, my mom, uh, because the whole thing was, and this this is the miraculous thing is my wife and I, we said, well, there are are alternatives. We can go to a fertility clinic and, you know, conceive that way. And in my in my this is how God works for me, you know, I, you know, I didn't I wasn't up to snuff. And uh, the doctor said, "Well, there's no hope. you know, you you just can't you just can't have babies. You know, there's just not enough there. And in all ser seriousness, that's that's when God steps in. Amen. When the doctors say there's nothing, we went to the fertility clinic and you know, the doctors ran their tests. They said, "No, your wife is fine. There's there's nothing wrong with her." They they said, "Well, there might be enough to where we can we can do our procedures." And so, they did blood tests on me and everything to make sure everything was okay. And when everything came back positive from the fertility clinic and from me, that's when my wife and I found out that uh we were expecting. So, we know we just want to give God all the glory. And it, you know, like that verse 24 says in the last verse, I'll close with this. And ye shall have them, whatever you shall ask. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've got a picture in my Bible, a brother Claude segment. Brother Claude, I want you to come down here and join me. I won't make you testify, but I'll just going to ask you a couple questions. A lot of you folks perhaps don't even know who Claude Sigman is. Brother Claude, he's been living here for quite a few years, but hasn't been in the church as such. His wife and daughter are here. Brother Claude is brother Edwin Dodd, sister Sally Dodd's son-in-law. Come up here, Brother Claude. Brother Claude's a friend of mine because he's a hunter and a fisherman. Brother Claude, you didn't know I was going to call you, did you? I hope not. &gt;&gt; How many years you've been living here? &gt;&gt; Uh 21 22 years. &gt;&gt; 22 years. You You come over to the microphone. I got one right here. Yeah. So they can hear you. So you've been 22 years here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh something held you back from giving your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Smoking. &gt;&gt; Smoking. How many years? &gt;&gt; 39 years. &gt;&gt; 39 years. That devil held him. 39 years. And you wanted to be in church, I'm sure, many times. &gt;&gt; You told me you'd go out fishing. And &gt;&gt; yeah, I'll go fishing so come to church &gt;&gt; instead of coming to church and feel like you're running away from something. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You know how that is. You can run, but you can't hide. &gt;&gt; I got a picture here. It's brother Claude with a real trophy deer. He'd gone out hunting with another man. And uh you said something and I just just tell the folks what it is you said that morning. Said something about if if God if you give me that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. See that night I couldn't sleep. So uh &gt;&gt; just step up to my &gt;&gt; and everything else. So uh I uh got up that morning and I said well he was kept on dealing with me and everything else. I said well I don't understand what's going on but you know it's been 21 years since I killed anything. I said, "If you give me a deer, I'll lay everything down and follow you." So that's what I did. &gt;&gt; And then how long was it? &gt;&gt; 35 minutes later. &gt;&gt; 35 minutes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 35 minutes later, God answered his prayer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it's been over since. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I ain't smoke for nine months in a week. &gt;&gt; Nine months in a week. He's got it down, hasn't he? God bless you, brother. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; Our God's a mighty deliverer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He can heal a cancer, &gt;&gt; deliver people from a habit, whatever it might be, &gt;&gt; give a couple children. In his presence, the supernatural is happening. Does anybody deny that? &gt;&gt; And tonight, we're having at least five more baptisms. young men. I've been impressed. It's been young men and young men who graduated. They're in the workforce and they've come two of them speaking to brother Tom said something happened. I'm not even the same person. &gt;&gt; I haven't come and made any big profession. Haven't haven't necessarily had prayer or whatever more. They're just done. They're done with the world. They're done with the devil. They're done with sin. They're done with unbelief. And God came in a sovereign move. Said, "I'm a total changed person. I need to be baptized." So, we're going to be baptizing some more this evening. And Brother Zephaniah Peters, who's with us, is going to be speaking tonight. And immediately after the message, we're going to have the baptismal. And we don't know what all is going to happen because God's working in the unseen. &gt;&gt; One thing I'd like to just mention to people that are here. So often things that God does gets associated with a personality and that's dangerous. And people look to a personality. I would like to I'd like to make you aware of something that's been happening in case you haven't picked it up. God began to move towards the camp. Before the camp, I we were having some unusual meetings. Unusual for me and I believe from what I've heard from the people unusual towards in in your own experience. And then they were just different and they were in and and I listened to some of the testimonies uh because we weren't here the last Sunday. I listened to some of the testim said it actually started with me uh prior to camp in the Sunday prior to camp or the meetings prior to camp and and then so that then we have the local ministry. I was ministering in those meetings. Then come uh our brother Spencer and we had a a marvelous camp and then after the camp our brother Tom ministered in the Sunday morning service and evening brother Tony baptizing to me it was a a a very very special uh unique thing that God did in letting the people know it's not associated with any single personality. The Holy Spirit is our leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he uses one, he uses another, he uses whomsoever he chooses. And that's just marvelous. It's marvelous in my eyes. Next Sunday, Brother Lance Laru will be ministering. And I can tell you it will just be continuing on. It's a move of God. It's not a move of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You can stand if you would please. And I'll have you uh uh just before we read, I'm going to sing uh a song that I just heard you're playing, Redeemed. If you'll start it up, please. &gt;&gt; The price. Oh, hallelujah. Jesus has changed my whole life. If he asks you just who I am, tell them I am free. Oh, lift it up. I am redeemed. I have a cry. Oh Jesus and change my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I have redeemed. Let all the sisters sing. And now sisters &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus has changed my all his name. anybody else who I am. &gt;&gt; Tell them, &gt;&gt; tell them I am. &gt;&gt; All of the brothers shall please. [Music] Oh Jesus my whole life [Applause] [Music] as you just who I am tell I am all together now I and [Music] marked with the Christ. Jesus has changed my whole life. If anybody asks you just who I am, tell them I am free. Our lovely Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; All glory and praise to you. All thanksgiving and honor we exalt your name. Glor &gt;&gt; indeed we are a privileged people. Indeed we are so thankful today. We thank you for the healings. We thank you for the lifegiving. Uh oh God. And we thank you, Father, for the deliverance that you have wrought, things that are visible and things that are invisible. for the spirit of God that has moved upon the hearts of the people, upon those that have been baptized, those that will be baptized, oh God, not only in water, but baptized with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and with fire, for you are that baptizer, the sealing of the Holy Ghost. So, it's done once and for all. We thank you for what you've done, oh God. For our brother Jim Hayes, our brother Claude Sigman, oh God, how we thank you for that deliverance. How the devil could not hold him any longer, Lord. And for the child that you're giving our brother Jason, sister M. Oh God, how we thank you for that, Lord. Oh, we just see so many things taking place. And we want to give you the glory. And now we ask that you will take the word which is written on the pages of holy scripture and open it to us, Lord. Pray that you'll just establish our walk. &gt;&gt; Establish us, I pray, &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Anoint me, Father, &gt;&gt; and anoint the people. I ask and especially with our brother Zephaniah Peters for this evening, Lord. Oh God, we're looking to you. Pray that you will remember us in your extended grace and mercy in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank you for your extra time that you've given this morning. I'll have you turn quickly if you would please to John the 4th chapter. We're going to read I was going to read uh quite a bit of this chapter, but I think because of the shortness of time, you're familiar with the story so well. a woman at the well. And uh the sixth verse of John 4 says, "Jacob's well was there, and Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water." Jesus saith unto her, "Give me to drink." For his disciples were gone away in unto the city to buy meat. Then said the woman of Samaria unto him, how is it that thou being a Jew, ask, drink of me, which I am a woman of Samaria? For the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said unto her, if thou kneest the gift of God, and who it is that sth to thee, that sth to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman sth unto him, "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep, from whence then hath hast thou this li that living water? Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?" Jesus answered and said unto her, "Whosoever drinkketh of this water shall thirst again. But whosoever drinkketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst. But the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. The woman said unto him, Sir, give me this water that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Jesus sith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, "Thou hast well said, I have no husband, for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that in that sense thou truly." The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship, you know not what we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeketh such to worship him." God is the spirit, and they that worship him shall must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ. When he has come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. And when he when and upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman, yet no man said, What seekest thou? or why talkst thou with her? The woman then left her water pot, and went unto the city, and said unto the men, come see a man, which told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ? Amen. May God bless his word as you have your seats. This portion of scripture actually was referred to several hundred times in the messages. Uh, as near as I can determine, brother Brandham referred to the woman at the well 646 times. And that to me sends us a powerful message. In fact, as I was looking for a place, I believe there's one place where he he he made reference to this scripture and then said that the angel of the Lord had directed him to some scriptures. And I believe this is one of those. I don't have that for certain, but uh he says one thing over and over again. He says, and right at the time when he himself has got people standing in front of him, especially if a woman is standing in front of him at the platform, he's a man. He doesn't know what her need is. Uh they're strangers. They've never met. He has them raise their hand to show that they have never met. They've never they don't know each other. And then he would refer to the scripture and say, "Now Jesus was trying to contact her spirit." He was trying to contact her spirit. And and then uh as soon as he would he would get and then he said he found her trouble and then the same now this is what I want you to follow me very close. The same Christ, the same one that sat on that well. Now, the same spirit begins now right there uh 40 years ago, 50 years ago, and begins to speak to this woman and tells her exactly exactly her problem, whatever it might be. and and in into minute detail even as Jesus said you've had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband begin to tell her all these things uh she realized right away this was a prophet you are a prophet and that was great but it wasn't far enough and that was in her spirit realm and I want to speak to you this morning about taking control of the human spirit because I believe it is that same one that came not to a well in Samaria, not to Jacob's well, but came to a tent in Birch Bay, Washington, came to a a certain seat, came to a church in Cloverdale, came to a certain place, and actually came when a lot of you that God has moved on recently, you were on your journey to do your own specific thing. You thought that, you know, this is what I need to do. This is what I always do. I always come and get water at this time of the day. I've got my pot. I'm going to the well. I'm going to Jacob's well. We do this all the time. We do it. We have a camp all the time. It's this year. It's another year. And some maybe maybe she didn't even really want to go. Do I have to go? This is, you know, all this burdensome work and this labor and all the rest of it. Do I, you know, and and there's some of you here and I've even heard, well, I didn't really want to go. I didn't really want to attend. I I had no interest in in the camp really. It wasn't. But little did you realize who it was that was sitting there &gt;&gt; and just started talking with you &gt;&gt; and you didn't realize it. Just began to speak to you and and she didn't know who she was talking to and you didn't know who you who was talking to you. And Jesus said, "If you'd only known if you only knew the gift of God and who it is that's speaking to you." Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, it's not it's not just uh uh some preacher and it's not just a book now. We are under we are under the banner of that same message. And this is the point I'm going to want to bring to you very very clearly today. We are under the banner of that ministry. That ministry has not faded away. When Jesus left, his ministry didn't end. Then started Peter and James and John and the Apostle Paul. And then God called and the ministry continued on. See, they had a sovereign move in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost. That was a sovereign move. But they didn't go the next week and try to redo that same move. They didn't try and say, "We got to have another upper room. We've got to have another 120. We've got to duplicate that." See, we don't have to duplicate what happened in Birch Bay. We don't have to duplicate what happened at any other uh any other special meeting. We don't try to duplicate last Sunday, for example. But it's the same God that moves on from one station to another to another. The same God. But once the sovereign move of God happens in an individual's life or within a church, once a sovereign move happens takes place, then comes another uh very very important facet or part of the of of the work of God and that is now we are we are required to take a hold of that and build &gt;&gt; on top of that. We are need we need to build and you young people will need to take and build on top of that. And sometimes that is not as exciting as the initial thing that God did with you. You know the the deliverance, the birth, the baptism, the sealing, all of these things are so wonderful and we just revel in it and then but then comes some hard work &gt;&gt; and and then comes some discipline and then comes some building. But that's what that's what God really honors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to just establish. I'm going back now. I just kind of launched out into it. I want to go back just a wee bit. And uh Jesus said to her, "If you knew who it was that saith to you, I would like to just rehearse and review with the congregation this morning." And the service today is is really focused upon what God has been doing and the lives that he's been touching. And I'm addressing largely you young people. And not only the young people, but those of you throughout the congregation who has felt a a a special time with God recently. I have. &gt;&gt; I have. It's not just you young people, but brother Biscll is pastor stood there when God was moving at the at the at the front. I stood at the altar. I said, "I want to dedicate again. I want to take and have another hard look at my own life. I want to see what more I can do. God, extend my life. Extend my energy. I want to be more fruitful for you. I want to be a part of this. I talked to one of my daughters. I said, "There's a real sweep and move of God taking place." Sister Marilyn, it was. And Marilyn says, "That's right. And I want to be right in the middle of it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That should be all of our cry and our determination. I want to be right in the middle of it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to be on the outskirts or on the, you know, on the perimeter. I want to be in the middle of it. who it is that was speaking and I believe I can just add a dimension to it for you in the message blind bareard I want you to think about this now here's brother Brandham speaking he said you heard my word and you had a right to doubt it you heard my word and you had a right to doubt it but this is not me speaking It's him. And to doubt him is sin. In a manifestation of the spirit, he said, "You heard me telling you something, speaking to a person, didn't you? That was my voice, but it was not me operating it. It was a supernatural being." Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard a man speak. Whoever that minister is. Uh you heard the word of God declared. And the ministry that comes from this pulpit is that which has been birthed under and given over to the very same spirit that spoke through that prophet of God. We don't want anything else. I want someone that knows what not only this person's trouble is or difficulty, but what was holding you back &gt;&gt; or you back or you back or some sister over here or anyone whatever was a hindrance to to our walk. I want to have someone or or or the cancer brother Jim's face. I want someone who knows how to destroy that thing. I want someone that can loose the bonds that have held a man for 39 years. I want someone and I want to know who it is that's speaking. &gt;&gt; If it's just a man, his words will fail. &gt;&gt; If it's just a sermon, we've heard lots of good sermons and great men and theologians and they can bring the word of God till it just thrills you. But yet, we need something more than that. We need to know who it is that's speaking. &gt;&gt; And if we know the one who's speaking, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the author of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's never known a defeat ever. If we know who's speaking, it changes the whole scene. &gt;&gt; Was it just a feeling I had? Was it just some emotion I had? Well, if it was, it could be like this woman. Brother Brandham said that he was trying to contact her spirit. But the reason he was seeking to contact her spirit is he was seeking to take control of her spirit and bring the word down to her soul. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what he does. That's the the way that he does do it. It's not me. He's using my voice, but it's not me. It's him. When a man stands and perhaps uh takes a quote as I will today and make reference to a number of quotes, I want to ask this congregation, is it me reading a quote or was it a man uh brother Brandham so many years ago, whether it's the 50s or the 60s or whenever it was, is it him that we're quoting or should We ask ourselves, is someone, a supernatural being trying to speak to us and say, "Oh, if you only knew the gift of God &gt;&gt; and who it is that's speaking, it would change our perspective about the service this morning. We say, who is this &gt;&gt; that's seeking me? Who is it that's calling? Who is it that's troubling my heart or or or seeking to bring me peace? Who is this? And that was key. That was a key point. Who is it in the message thirst? He's saying when the deep calleth to the deep, it takes more than joining a church. &gt;&gt; It takes more than shaking hands with a preacher. It takes more than living a good straight life. &gt;&gt; To all of you that have been baptized, it takes more than living just a good straight life. It takes something to satisfy the inside of you. &gt;&gt; That pours down, he says, from God into your soul. So it it goes beyond the wonderful feeling and the oh the oh the exuberance we had and waving our hands and whatever more that's wonderful but it goes further than that say oh I'm just so thrilled I don't hardly know I I'm just ready to explode but it goes deeper than that and the Holy Spirit is taking a hold of the word of God and bringing it down past the body and through the spirit taking control of the spirit and remember the spirit is right next to the soul. &gt;&gt; For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit because the spirit and the soul lie right next together. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that is why so many can get into an emotional realm and in the realm of the memory, the realm of the imagination, the the affection and and the reasoning can get into those realms and feel as though God has done something when actually God is starting to do something and he wants to go further than that and he's seeking to pull that take control of that spirit and bring the bring the resource down to the soul. He says it comes from God to the soul. &gt;&gt; How do I know when it's in the soul? I'll tell you what, when it's in the soul, it doesn't matter whether it rains or shines. &gt;&gt; It's still the same. Doesn't matter where things go good or things go bad. It doesn't matter whether you have a job or you just got fired. It doesn't matter whether you just heard you're terminally ill or whether you got perfect health. When your when the resources come down to the soul, it's all over. Hallelujah. You're done. You're done with the world. You're done with all of the world. You're done with anything that even tastes or hints of the world. You're finished with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what God is doing. &gt;&gt; And that's where we want to go on. We want to take now another step. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in a thinking man's filter said the soul is drawing your resource through the outside down through the spirit into the soul. Your soul is drawing it. Your soul is calling for it. Your eternal body is calling for the message even that you're hearing this morning. It's not me who wants to preach it. Your soul has called for it. Your body on the other side is calling for it for you to take another step. Amen. &gt;&gt; As I said a few moments ago, God has moved in a most unexpected and sovereign way. Nobody planned it. Nobody organized it. We simply do what we should do. Do it with all of our heart. And then God has to come in. And I can tell you, don't whatever you do, don't look lightly on the move of God. &gt;&gt; You might live the rest of your life and not see anything quite like it again. When God was reaching down and taking lives and transforming them, even to the point where they themselves, and I know I speak for a number, they themselves are bewildered at what's happening. something is changing within them. I can tell you when God delivers a person from a habit that habit becomes so foreign to them and that whole old life becomes so foreign as it is as the apostle Paul the past uh the past is not merely forgotten but it is it is the things that you once loved you hate and the things that you once hated you love. &gt;&gt; Amen. You talk about a turnaround. That's what God does. And that can happen so swift and it does happen so swift. Sometimes with others it is more uh gradual but it is so swift that a person is bewildered what's happening. But you just let go and let God have his way. &gt;&gt; And so we are we have and we are responding to the voice of God &gt;&gt; and the moving of his spirit. And now we must make that sovereign move of God. We must make that sovereign move of God the foundation upon which we build for your individual life. Brother Brandon was referring to the scripture. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of lamb has come and the his wife hath made herself ready. And he made a special point with that. And he said, "If you notice, she made herself ready." &gt;&gt; So many says, "If the Lord will take this evil spirit from me," now just listen. So many say, "If the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or from stealing, I'll serve him." He said, "But that's up to you. &gt;&gt; That's up to you." say, "It's not if God does this, if God does that." God already moved by his spirit upon your heart and you heard his voice. And I'm here to say today, I want you to pay real strict attention who it is that was speaking. Not merely a quote, not merely brother Ron Spencer, brother Ed Biscll or Brother Tom Ray or brother Lance Laroo, brother John Andy's, brother Ernie Noea, brother Tony. It it it it isn't it isn't the individual who it is that was speaking. When a person says God spoke to me &gt;&gt; as many of you are seated here today God has spoken to me. My next question is why has he spoken to what is his purpose? What does he intend now to happen? &gt;&gt; And I'm saying there's something for us to do. But that's up to you. He said you've got to do something. He says they they that overcome they that overcome shall inherit all things. He says they that overcome. You have the power to do it, but you must be willing to lay it down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I felt to have these testimonies today because I want to make reference back to them because there were principles that were involved. And I believe that when brother Claude said his simple prayer to God, his words, "If you do that, I'll do this." God's a real businessman, he took him at his word. Hallelujah. If you'll do that, I'll do this. I believe when brother Jim sat in that chair and said to those doctors, "Four men of God, four uh whatever are stewards of God, to me, that high priest said, "I have to move. I have to move on that. That is a profession." and his heart is convinced of that and according to the word of God. I have to move on that &gt;&gt; sir. That's something that we do and we must be willing to lay it down. He said she made herself ready. He said, you see, God could not push us. &gt;&gt; God could not push us through a little pipe. He's not trying to push you young people through a little pipe to come out the other end and say, "Blessed is he that overcomemeth." It's not God pulling you through a pipe and then on the end saying, "Blessed is he that overcomemeth." He said, "You had nothing to overcome." &gt;&gt; If God just pulled you through a pipe, you had nothing to overcome. He said he just pushed you through. But you've got to make you've got to make decisions for yourself. And that you have I'm glad that you've made decisions. You said that was God that's speaking to me and I need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You made decisions. He says I have to make decisions for myself. He's saying in doing that we show our faith and respects to God. So the purpose the purpose that we have now is to build upon what God has done. It's important that we have a good understanding and and the purpose of the service this morning is to attempt to try to give you a good understanding of what has and is taking place. What is actually taking place? That's number one. And number two, who is it that has called you that I started off with? And number three, and for what purpose has he called you? Now, Brother Brandham referred to the woman at the well, and I'm going to make a reference back to her. Uh, this is who I want speaking to me. And I'm just going to read this with a purpose. There's a little lady sitting here with her head bowed. Now, this is one that was speaking in 1957 57. Do you know what eternal life is? What's 40 years? What's 50 years? What's 100 years? What's a thousand years? &gt;&gt; It's not even &gt;&gt; God. God's not a man. God's God. &gt;&gt; God's eternal. And I say this same God, this same God, I am thoroughly convinced that this was not a man that was could say these things. A little lady is sitting here with her head bowed and she's suffering with a bright disease. How many here know anything about a bright disease? One. It's not a very common disease. Here's a prophet calling a woman out of an audience. You're suffering with brights disease. Now, that's not saying you got a pain in your back or you got a pain and ache in your knee. He's telling her precisely and I had to look it up and it happens to be a kidney disease and people it can be terminal and people die from it. And he's saying you have a bright disease and you believe with all your heart. He said that kind of struck you. You were praying, weren't you? And you believed me to be his servant. Notice now what he says. Have bright disease again. He said, he said, I don't know you, do I, lady. I'm a stranger to you, but God does know you. And that's right. He says, there's some connection. There's some connection about a minister. Your husband's a preacher. That's right. And your name is Flossy. That's right. And your last name is Woodward. That's right. She didn't even have to say that's right. He's saying that's right. &gt;&gt; And I see you standing by a street called Willleta. That's right. and your number is 3322 West Wleta Street. If that's right, raise up your hand. Do you believe me to be God's prophet? I certainly do. &gt;&gt; That same God. And then he goes on. He says, he says, "And then you get what you asked for in Christ's name." What about you way back? What do you think, young man? &gt;&gt; My book laying in your lap. &gt;&gt; Way back. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You young man with my book laying in your lap, &gt;&gt; a Mexican boy. Do you believe in you'll get over that epilepsy? &gt;&gt; I got thinking about way back. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I thought maybe way forward, way up, &gt;&gt; in the Birch Bay, Washington, &gt;&gt; sat a young man, &gt;&gt; way up there. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly your heritage. He knew exactly your color, knew exactly where you come from, knew exactly what street you lived on, knew exactly your house number. &gt;&gt; There you are. Who's speaking? &gt;&gt; If you only knew who it is that speaketh to you. If you only knew the gift of God. And now you begin to discover. Oh God, I felt this before. My parents have told me about it. The preachers preached about it. But now it's coming to me. &gt;&gt; God's coming to your own address. &gt;&gt; God knows exactly the book that's laying in your lap today. &gt;&gt; He knows what you've been reading. Oh, if we only knew, then we can say, "Oh, this Christ, thou art the Messiah, &gt;&gt; this word, this spirit, this message which we have, you're none other than the Christ, the son of the living God." And then you're ready. Then you're in line to receive the full benefit more than even that feeling perhaps at the tent or in another service. more than even being baptized. But beyond that and further than from that, you say, "Oh, brother Biscll, are there things that are more wonderful? Things that are yet more glorious." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And maybe not in a in an emotional way and yet may might be. I can tell you friends, it's a great God has a lot of ways to bless his people. &gt;&gt; A lot of ways. Bless you with health, bless you with your family, bless you with brothers and sisters in Christ. God is not limited as to how he benefits his people. I'm convinced this morning he loves his people. I do not say lightly he loves you. But I say it with all sincerity. He loves you because you love him. You love his word. You love his manifestation. You love his revelation. You love him. And he loves you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feel if I didn't say anything further today than to announce to you that he loves you with an undying love. He loves you with a love that you cannot even begin to uh uh know its depths. &gt;&gt; He said the sign of the prophet was only vindication of his presence. &gt;&gt; The sign of the prophet, that sign, you're living on West Wleta Street, 3322 West Walleta. that sign that he spoke to you, that sign and and and the very fact that that voice of that I would say it's the same one that said 3322 was saying to you &gt;&gt; in Birch Bay saying to you this morning, knowing exactly your situation, exactly your condition, if I could get you to believe that all things are possible here today, not in another camp meeting, not in some other special service, a Wednesday night, a Friday night, or tonight. The same God, hallelujah, that spoke to the woman at the well is the same God knows your address, knows where you live, knows how you drove here today, knows how much fuel's in your tank. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Is the same God. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; That's the same God that's breathing upon our young people. &gt;&gt; And not exclusive to young people as well. I'm convinced and my heart was touched. He says a young man way back. Oh, I sat that. Oh, God. It wasn't in that meeting, but you're the same Lord Jesus. You came and sat in that service. You sat night after night in the meetings and you talked to them. This is way back, way up here in 2005, in a more wicked time, in a more evil day. But you're the same mighty God. And I tell you, God's hands are not going to be tied by drugs or by cigarettes or by alcohol or by friends or by your peers. God's hands are not tied. &gt;&gt; You're loosed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This move of God has loosed you. &gt;&gt; Be not bound again or encumbered with the things of this life. Don't come back into bondage once again. You enjoy this liberty and tell the devil his backbone is broken. As brother Ron Spencer said, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. this woman and I take her because the brother Brandon referred to her so many times. She certainly did not expect to encounter what she had encountered. And there are some principles here which I want to get on to right away. said he sat down one day up in Samaria. He said the Samaritans, he sat down by a well and a woman came. He was introducing his ministry to the Samaritans. The Jews, he said, real well-trained Jews. They knew what the sign of Messiah was. And the real trained Samaritans knew what the sign of Messiah was. And here he is saying there. I wonder about the Gentiles. I wonder about the Gentiles. And here we are. I wonder about the Gentiles when he made his visit in the last days to the Gentiles. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I wondered and and I I'm I'm very very I'm profoundly affected and I even my own wife drives me. She says, you know, you're seeing things different. And I said, I am. So, I've never heard you speak like you're speaking. And I said, no. And I've never experienced what I'm experiencing. It's something sovereign. It's something so unusual. And it is none less. And something that is specifically to be specific with you, I've been able to identify there has come so that when I when I read and hear a quote, it's as though it's right now here. The same person's here. &gt;&gt; I don't even read it as 1957 or 1963. Eternal God right here who said it then is saying it now. He's saying it again. The same Jesus Christ. Not another. The same one. And there's no difference in time, my friend, for the woman at the weller, you sitting here, you sister sitting here, it makes no difference. That same one that knew her her condition and everything and her thirst &gt;&gt; knew her thirst. &gt;&gt; That's a great thing. &gt;&gt; Knew what she was craving for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That same God. He says, 'I wonder about the Gentiles when he's made his visit in the last days. I wonder about us Gentiles. Here we are. If you only knew the gift of God. Oh, what he's given. You're living in a golden age. You're living in a time when he has fully &gt;&gt; and completely revealed himself. &gt;&gt; And we've heard it. I said, "Well, I've heard that before." But have you participated? &gt;&gt; Have you got a hold of it? &gt;&gt; Now the sweep of God. But now what you do with it, &gt;&gt; that's that's key. This is this is critical what we do now. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. She like us, like you, like I is made up of body, soul, and spirit. She had her physical need. Coming to the well to get water. You have your physical needs. You go to work. You earn a paycheck. You have your daily duties. You sisters, we have our physical needs. We have our emotional needs. They're very real. You have your emotional need, whether you regard it or not. But we have our spiritual need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we don't want to stop at the natural blessing. And we don't want to stop at the phys at the blessing within the spirit realm. We don't want to stop with our, you know, our our our emotional realm being uh satisfied, but we want to draw that resource from God &gt;&gt; down to our soul. I thought of this statement in God commissioning Moses. Now, Brother Brandham says this, "Have faith now in God and believe everybody. Just try to be level and calm just as you can." You don't realize, friend, what a strain. You're living in two worlds at the same time. But the angel of the Lord that you see on this picture is here now. So, he was pointing to something previous. A picture had been taken some time now. He was trying to get those people to believe that same one was there now. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying today to get that same one he spoke about is here now. &gt;&gt; From the picture to the meeting, from the meeting to this meeting is irrelevant to God. There's no time with God. That same God, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that hung over and had a picture taken. That same God here at the pullpit, here at the platform, here in this meeting, and where faith is is a milky white wave. Hallelujah. Cloud of faith upon the people. God is here. &gt;&gt; God is present. I've never thought of this quite like this. Now you folks are under the banner of this message. Here come a messenger is what he said. Every spirit in this building is subject to me. by Jesus Christ. I begin to think about that. Maybe a few thousand people and a man is standing here and declaring and it being confirmed. I take every spirit. I've got all kinds of places. I take every spirit in this building. every spirit under my control for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Every imagination, every reasoning, &gt;&gt; every affection, &gt;&gt; every memory, &gt;&gt; taking all memory, bring it into captivity. And that's what Jesus did at the well. He took all of her spirit into control &gt;&gt; to bring the word down to the soul. And I feel that God wouldn't even be talking to me that way if that isn't what he was intent on doing here in this service &gt;&gt; here to you. &gt;&gt; Take control. Oh, memory. What a destroyer it is. &gt;&gt; What a destroyer of relationships. What a destroyer of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a torment can be in a person's memory. &gt;&gt; And imagination. How people serve God in imagination never get to it. in our reasoning. Reason it this way, reason it that way, and get absolutely nowhere, &gt;&gt; just dry up &gt;&gt; reasoning &gt;&gt; our affection. How many people I have seen in my ministry couldn't get on with God because of their affection. A boyfriend for a girlfriend, a girlfriend for a boyfriend. I was in a meeting and a young man says, he said, "And God dealt with him. God, this same Jesus that sat on the well spoke to him. I knew it. He knew it. He said, "I can't." He said, "If I do, my wife will leave me." And he he refused it. Two weeks later, his wife left him &gt;&gt; with the children. &gt;&gt; When God deals with somebody, I tell you what, it's time to move. &gt;&gt; Time to move. The reason I was just hesitant for a moment, I just thought of another one. And more come to my mind down through the ministry where people have looked right straight at salvation, at deliverance. They look straight at the promise of God and they knew that God was moving and speaking to them right then. They said, "Uh, another time or some other time when things are more convenient." And with King Agria, he never got a more convenient time. The convenient time is when God comes. The convenient time is when he's sitting on the well. The convenient time is now. &gt;&gt; Now's the day of salvation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the day of deliverance. &gt;&gt; This is a convenient time. I've &gt;&gt; seen so many wait for that convenient time and it never came. &gt;&gt; Taking control of the human spirit. And I began to think the prophet of God skipping across the country, taking control of every human spirit of several thousand here and hundreds here and thousands there. And I I said, "God, this is you. This is still you. This is you. And you must take control of the human spirit. You must take control of the human spirit and bring that resource down. Don't leave us to a a a fluff. Don't leave us just to a move in a tent. Don't move leave us just to a wonderful Sunday service whenever it was or an evening service when people get all moved and then the next day it's gone. The Monday morning will come as somebody said at camp. The Monday morning will come. But when God has pulled the resource down to the soul, Monday morning is the same as Sunday. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're in a jubilee all the time. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. I'm going to rejoice. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, I'm just saying it so you catch it. In the name of Jesus Christ, the son of God, I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God. Don't get any ideas. I'm not saying that that I am. I'm saying that one who said that is here. &gt;&gt; There's the mistake. They said, "Oh, William Brandham said it." No, he couldn't say that. How can a man take control of every spirit? &gt;&gt; It was the Christ that sat on the well. Hallelujah. He's the same Jesus, the same Christ that sat on the well here in this service. Maybe sitting here, I don't know. But he's speaking to the individual heart. Yes. &gt;&gt; And his purpose is to bring that resource down &gt;&gt; from a wonderful feeling in the natural it is God down to the soul down into the spirit through the spirit into the soul. And there it's anchored &gt;&gt; there. It'll never move. &gt;&gt; There's no power. &gt;&gt; There's not will separate us. What can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus? What's going to take this away from you? Nothing. Nothing can remove it from you. Let all the devils of hell come. Let all the temptation come. You become anchored &gt;&gt; because it's the same God. It's this same God. &gt;&gt; We don't just sing about him, but he is present with us. &gt;&gt; If you realize that, friends, so much of the prophet's ministry was spent on getting the people to try to believe. It's the same God was present &gt;&gt; and he would say over and over and over Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And for so many of us, it's just a term. It's just a scripture in the Bible and it rolls off our lips so easily. &gt;&gt; It's much more than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm convinced that as we and I would like as many as possible to join me. I'm seeking with everything that's in me to lay hold of he who's present with us now. And when I see what he did in the message, I say you're the same now. When I hear what he says in the word of God, I said you're the same one now. Whether you sat there or what you said there, you're the same now. You're operating the same. You're doing the same. Hallelujah. Nothing is impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip some. I thought it was really outstanding when our brothers Zephaniah stood here and began to speak Friday night and he began on certainly not knowing what I was wanting to come to this morning. and he began and he spent that's why I'm not taking so much time with it. How the relationship of the soul and the spirit and and he and he talked about God pulling that resource down. I thought that's right on my notes. That's right here. That's what I'm speaking on. Thought how wonderful you are, Lord. You're just carrying the same theme straight through. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Says this this the true nature of your life the true nature of your life the true nature of your soul is a desire to live for God. &gt;&gt; I know that that is so that is your true nature. &gt;&gt; And he said your your spirit your soul is the nature. It's your soul is the nature of the spirit. He said, "And if your soul, if your nature craves for the things of the world, says then you're dead." &gt;&gt; If it craves, because God can't crave for the things of the world. But your soul craves, the true nature, your true nature craves after God. Oh yes, you were in the world. You were tempted and you did this and you did that and you tried something else and you, you know, you you had this kind of friend and you engaged in in whatever more and you succumb to temptation. But that's not your true nature. And that's why God dealt with you. That's not your true nature. Your true nature is a hunger after God. &gt;&gt; Now I just want to take the next few minutes please for after the sovereign move of God then we build upon that spiritual and supernatural act. Uh my I'm going to I'm going to have you turn in your Bible if you would please to First Timothy the 4th chapter. I'm not going to keep you long because we want to give our time to the service tonight as well and you'll be refreshed this afternoon and have a little bit of nourishment and then come back and be ready for what our brother Zephaniah has on his heart as well. And I know God is really blessing him by seeing even what's been taking place. And when I make reference, I'm not going to I'm not going to belittle what God is doing. I'm going to magnify it before God. &gt;&gt; To me, it's marvelous. It's marvelous in our eyes. Hallelujah. And as we praise him for it, he'll just do more. &gt;&gt; Amen. We want him to do more, friends. Oh, we want him to do more. &gt;&gt; There's a number of points here, but I will just I'm going to be quick. Uh 1 Timothy 4:12. Let no man despise thy youth. So I'm speaking largely to you young people now. Let no man despise your youth. The Apostle Paul speaking to Timothy who he called his son. But be thou an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity. &gt;&gt; Amen. you young people. Now, God is calling for you to be an example. You can even be an example to your parents. &gt;&gt; You can be an example and will be an example to your friends and your associates. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, one thing that is absolutely essential, that's number one, is you must make not just a clear decision in the house of God or in the tent or wherever. You must make a clear decision and a clear break from all the old lifestyle. &gt;&gt; You can't ease out and ease into God. God said to Abraham, Abram, and this is one of our best examples. He said, "Leave. Get up. Leave your kindred." And brother Brandham said he had to leave everybody. He had to leave those. He had to leave his comfort zone. He had to leave where he was comfortable and his life and his friends and his family. He had to be not only be willing, but he had to leave it. That's right. &gt;&gt; God not call you necessarily to leave your family because your call is different. But the call is the same. The call is you must be willing. Your unbelieving family cannot affect you. &gt;&gt; If you have unbelieving family, you say, "I am headed for the kingdom of God." You go whatever direction you need to go, but nothing can change my course. And when you make that kind of a decision, even the devil hears it. &gt;&gt; And say it &gt;&gt; and keep saying it. Nothing can change my course. And the first thing is tell your friends. &gt;&gt; Brother Ben Dingwall, I enjoyed your testimony the other night. Would you just stand so people know who I'm speaking about? Brother Ben has to go back up home to Edmonton. God bless you, brother Ben. And God worked some marvelous things in his life. yet when he was still in Edmonton, this thing is not localized to this church or any other church up in Edmonton and God dealt with him and he came back and uh his father told me he had such a time with God and on his face before God and then I I I sat with him about an hour as he prayed and just giving himself and letting the Holy Spirit mold him. And I left him uh between so between 11 o'clock and midnight at the tent. And when I left the tent at about midnight, there's still probably about 200 people in there of young people and I don't know, maybe more came back in. But brother brother Ben did what I believe in with all my heart. He went back to work &gt;&gt; and uh his all his cronies and his friends and the buddies that he may go out and whatever do whatever with said, "Oh, hey, what'd you do on the weekend?" Said, "I went to a Bible camp." Bible camp. You know what' you do there? He said, "I gave my life to Christ." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe that with all my heart. That's the way to do it. A clear decision, but also a clear break. &gt;&gt; Clearcut decision and a clear break. God loves that. &gt;&gt; And when he says jump, just jump. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't ask how high. Don't ask how far. Just do it. Amen. And when you're done with the world, let the devil know. Let your friends know and set the set the uh make the testimony clear and quick. &gt;&gt; And and brother Ben was telling me one of the hardest fellas who's there, I don't know whether he's had a life of crime or whatever more of all of the guys that are there, the hardest one hard case come says, "I admire you. I respect that." They know. &gt;&gt; And as I've said to even my own daughters when they were in high school, they might make fun of you. You know, there's always a there's power within a mob. And when they're around as a whole group, oh yeah, yeah, know. And they say all kinds of things about you and how you look and how you live and your church and what you live and all the rest of it. But as I said, and I believe it, and I know it's true, when they get home and they lay on their bed and they get in their room alone, they say, "I wish I could live that kind of life. I wish I could look like that. &gt;&gt; I wish I could have that godly appearance. I wish I had some sparkle in my eye. I And and and when they get there, they hate those habits. They despise those drugs, but they're a slave. And you're free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're free. Oh, bless the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah. You're free. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; They admire it. &gt;&gt; They respect it. And so, number one, if you haven't done it already, do it as soon as you can. Make a clear break. &gt;&gt; Let them know I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; I believe an end time message &gt;&gt; and Christ has come into my life. I told brother B, I just shared it with him. When I gave my life to Christ, I was about exactly the same age as he was. So reminded me and I went to some of my buddies, you know, I hunted with and they drank beer. I couldn't stand beers. I didn't drink their beer, but we'd be in their parties together, you know. And I came to them. I says, "I gave my life to Christ and I'm done." This fellow was a bookkeeper in my wife's dad's store. He pushed me on the shoulder says, "Ah, Biscll," he says, "I'll give you three weeks." You know, and he always make a joke of it, "Ah, Biscll, I'll give you three weeks." I never smiled. I said, "No, Chris, you'll never see me again. You'll never see me there again." Three weeks went by, three years went by, time went by. I was pastoring the little church in this place. Then I moved away and was doing do work, missionary work down here amongst the native Indian people. And I went back up to Dawson Creek just for a visit. And he had a he had a a a successful restaurant called Smitties. That was his restaurant, not the one you have here. And uh he was he was the sponsor for the local hockey team. And his boy, they weren't able to have children either. He adopted some boys and they were they they were native boys and they became very fine hockey players. He's going places. I walked into the restaurant. Hi Chris, how you doing? Well, he said, "You know that Luger pistol I have?" This is exactly the conversation. You know the Luger pistol I have? I said, "Yeah." He says, "I was up on Bear Mountain this summer and I put that pistol to my temple and my finger on the trigger." He said, "I came just that close to pulling it." He said, "That's where I've been. It been my joy to be with buildings full of native Indians praying with them and seeing God move. It been my joy to see the Holy Spirit to see Jesus Christ. It been my joy and I thought here's my friend. How Satan has robbed him. Do you think I have any kind feelings towards that devil? I despise him &gt;&gt; with a holy hatred that he would take and rob him of that. And years later, many years later, my father-in-law passed away. And he was being his service was to be in the United Church of Canada up there cuz that's all he had known. We went up there and the pastor was a woman. I was feeling so I was feeling so disheartened after being here and my father-in-law who gave his life to Christ seven years ago. in in his senior years who God had healed so marvelously and the prophet of God said to my wife, "Your father will be all right." We had to commit him to God. But now, because that's the only church he'd ever been a member of, no message church there now. I thought this woman is going to be the take his service. I felt so bad. The girls were practicing a song, getting ready to sing a song in the funeral the next day. And I learned that the pastor, the woman had to come to Vancouver for a convention. She just happened to be down here. And there was an old man from England. They have a little chapel on Buckingham Palace grounds. And he's one of these kind of senior veterans and chaplain from the wars and so on. And there's a group of them and they travel out like I think PR man and so on but they live right on the Buckingham Palace grounds in England and he happened to be visiting over here in northern Canada was in this church that day and he's walking down the aisle with me and he's all kind of humped over you know going along and the girls are practicing. He says who are they? He says that's smashing. Absolutely smashing. real profound English statement. &gt;&gt; Brother Allan, doesn't that sounds right? Smashing. I said, "Well, they're they're my daughters." Oh, he said, "They're your daughters." Yeah. He said, "I heard that somebody in the relatives is a preacher." I said, "That's me." "You're the preacher?" He says, "You're the one to take the funeral. I didn't even know the old man. You take it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that fast right from a woman taking it. I got to take my own father-in-law's funeral. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was up there preaching his funeral and look right down the middle aisle on the edge of the aisle sits Christopher Smith. The one who says, "Ah, I'll give you three weeks." And all these years later, I'm preaching under these miraculous conditions. went up to attend the funeral and I ended up preaching it. &gt;&gt; And I thought, "Oh, God, one more time, one more opportunity to lay it in &gt;&gt; and to preach a sermon to them about eternal life." &gt;&gt; And I was able to tell them about the West Harper, my father, my father-in-law, that they did not know because in his senior years, he received Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. I shook hands with him. Said, "You almost got preaching." I thought, "Well, at least that was different than the first one. I'll give you three weeks." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You'll never be sorry &gt;&gt; that you trusted his name. You'll never be sorry that you gave your life to him. You'll never be sorry. Glory. Glory to God. Live for him. And then he says, then he says, "Till I come." And I'd like to have you think Apostle Paul is here. I'm just echoing his words. Could you boys, could you young men, could you young ladies, could this congregation, could you give yourself to hear Apostle Paul till I come give attendance? And that attendance is to give earnest. You give give yourself give attendance to reading &gt;&gt; to exhortation &gt;&gt; and to doctrine. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm closing with this to give attendance if you take it in in Greek. What he's saying is lay hold of it &gt;&gt; and take it to yourself &gt;&gt; and make it your possession. I am a reader of the scriptures. &gt;&gt; I am a reader of the message. I give myself to reading for the purpose not saying I read a page to take it and make it your possession. &gt;&gt; And and and and you remember now what I started with this morning. So significant. Don't forget it when you leave here. That same one &gt;&gt; who's speaking in that page &gt;&gt; is the same one that was sitting on the well. and say, "Lord, I may not recognize it today, but speak to me. Let me just go slowly through this page. I give myself to reading. I give myself to exhortation and I give myself to doctrine." You know what exhortation is? You see another buddy, another friend. You see someone else who had really, you know, was just moving along so well and you see them come in a troubled time. I'm I'm I'm here for you. &gt;&gt; I'm here to help you. and you begin to exhort them. &gt;&gt; Brother David, I appreciate your ex exhortation uh in the service. &gt;&gt; It was marvelous. &gt;&gt; And I had asked Brother David to come that Sunday night and just spoke to him on the phone. David doesn't know this, but he said something to me on the telephone that spoke to me very, very deeply. He said, "I decided instead of criticizing the young people, I was going to become proactive and I begin to invite them over to my home and have them there and have a barbecue or have whatever. Just invite them to my place and be proactive and create an environment." And brother David, you did do that &gt;&gt; and God bless you for it &gt;&gt; and we respect that. Hallelujah. And there's many here. My family, some of my family was there after Sunday night's service and they said we left at 2:30 in the morning. And they weren't talking any frivolity. Those young people were talking about what God had spoken to them and what message they were in and what they had just heard and the last tape they had been in and the last book that they had read. I tell you my friends, that's something you can't buy. &gt;&gt; You talk about criticize. I'd like to see the person stand in this building that I couldn't find something to criticize. &gt;&gt; We'll always have something to criticize. &gt;&gt; I'd like to see the church. You can't criticize. There's always something to criticize. But you who have the beam in your eye, cast that out first so you see more clearly to cast out the moat that's in the other brother's eye. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You talk about You talk about being enthused. I am absolutely I'm absolutely swept away with what's happening. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. There's ought to be a lot of parents and I know there are parents here who are thrilled and parents who have not seen their children here. Maybe they're out in the world. You say within yourself, the same God that called them, there's nothing with distance. &gt;&gt; There's nothing with distance. &gt;&gt; What does God know about distance? Nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This same prophet, the Lord Jesus, speaking to him, say, you take that handkerchief, you're praying for somebody and he's away. He's your husband. He's in another town. You think God doesn't know about that son, that daughter, whoever they might be. God knows them. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you have the same faith that that brought salvation to you and hold that for them. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to close. We're not through, but I'm going to leave the rest for brother Zephaniah to say tonight. I know he's got he's got a message from God and God's been stirring his heart as well. But I want to lay down some practical things and I only gave you two now. You make a clean break. You make that make it known &gt;&gt; to all of your friends, all of your peers. I think of my grandson Wesley and all of you know and young people, you know a whole lot more about him than perhaps I do. And he was headed he was headed for big trouble in the world. I don't mind saying, and I would say to his parents, he's a talented boy, but you've got to you've got to you've got to give some direction to those gifted talents because the devil's waiting for them. &gt;&gt; The world wants them. &gt;&gt; I deny that. &gt;&gt; And I was in Edmonton and he's sitting right over here and I saw his face just be stoned through the service and I knew it was the Holy Ghost. And there was no big emotional flare, nothing. Service was over. And he just came and stood like a man. He said, "Grandpa, I don't want any emotional thing. I don't want to be at the altar. I don't want I don't want to just have some, you know, some emotional experience." He said, I said, "God's dealing with you." Yes. He sat back down. I think I may have prayed with him. He was at a job over in Vancouver Island. I called him just to keep contact. I said, "Wesley, that's God dealing with you. Just hold that. Hold your course. Hold your course." And he came back here one service and God met him here in a wonderful way and he was done. Done with the world. Right over here in a place some of his friends wanted to meet him or something or he maybe went in there for lunch or something. Walked in. Here's a whole slew of his friends. I think there was 19 of them. Josh, a thing of you. All these friends, druggers, druggies and dope addicts. And he had some friends that were big pushers. He never got into it to my knowledge, but they were big- time pushers driving hot cars and more money than they had need of and from good homes. And these kids had super super very expensive cars. Here's all lined up and some girls there and all the rest of it. You can see the scene. He stepped up. He said, 'I'm not in this anymore, fellas. Oh, yeah. Come on. No. He said, 'I gave my life to Christ. I'm done. Oh, come on. You can't do that. So, the waitress comes around and says, I want a beer and I want a Heineken and I want a Bud Light and I want this and I want something else. They came to Wes. He says, "Ginger ale, please." They looked at each other said, "He has changed." He just drank his ginger ale down, got up, says, "Salom, so long, fellas. I'm out of my way. I'm out of here." &gt;&gt; And that was the end of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You think we're not rejoicing? &gt;&gt; Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; Let's have some music. Let's sing. Amen. I'm waiting for the musicians. I got to sing. &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry. I've got to sing it. &gt;&gt; Not too fast, but just so you get right in the rhythm of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've never been sorry since I trusted his name. Every moment I find him. Exactly the same. My soul has been saved since the Savior came. I've been sorry since I trusted his name. [Music] Is that up where it should be? Is that where we are? Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned, I have been singing every day. I've never been sorry. He is with me the awkward way. I never sorry.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. You think I'm going to cut this rejoicing short? &gt;&gt; No way. Jesus gave her water that was not in the well. Jesus gave her water and sent her forth to jail. She went away singing. Amen. Came back bringing others to the water that was not in the well. Oh Jesus gave her water that was not from the well. Jesus gave her water and sent her forth to tell. She went away singing and came back bringing others to the water that was not going to be well. Tell you if you're still thirsting this morning, there's a well here. [Music] and you'll never thirst again. &gt;&gt; You'll never thirst again. &gt;&gt; Just come and drink. &gt;&gt; It's real, friends. This isn't just some excitement. This is real. We got lives here that have been totally turned around, transformed. And I'm so thankful because that's what I experienced. That same God from 50 years ago is the same God. Amen. All right, let's sing. He's the same God and then we're going to be dismissed. Same God. The same God is wonder. God the mighty red sea. Oh, he's the same God living in me. Oh, he's the same God. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well. The same God. I wonder who to tell the same God [Music] is the great sea. Oh yes, he's the same God living. Now when we sing it once again, remember he's the same God that did what he did for brother Claude Segment. The same God that did for brother Jim Hayes. Same God that did for my brother Jason, Sister Annie. Same God that done all these things. The same God, run Joshua, my brothers here. The same God, each one of you young men, don't you ever forget it. Don't ever forget it. That same God spoke to me in the 10 Birch Bay. Spoke to me in my church. He sat on a well one day and spoke to a woman. And what he did for her, he's doing for me. Take control of my spirit. &gt;&gt; Bring that word down into the realm of the soul. You'll never regret it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We'll give him glory as we sing it once again. Oh, he's the same God. &gt;&gt; The woman at the well. Oh, he's the same God. [Music] Ready to tell the same God [Music] and he's the same God is dwelling in me. [Music] Brother Jared Harp, would you come Brother Jared? Ask God's blessing upon the congregation, upon the afternoon, and upon the evening service. Oh, we're so charged, friends. I don't have to tell you. I just so filled with expectation. I don't even know what's going to happen from day to day. But it doesn't have to happen right here in the service. God's not limited to these four walls. He's just going to continue on and on and on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Jared, if you'd come, please. Amen. I have to give this note. There's a junior choir practice. Junior choir practice at 3 p.m. today, please, in the chapel. 3 p.m. today for junior choir. God bless you. Oh God, how happy we are tonight or this morning, Lord Jesus, to see you're moving again, Lord. Just a continuation, Lord. Oh God, how good it is to know that you're the same God, Lord Jesus. Oh God, you've spoken to me, Lord, three years ago at a camp, Lord Jesus. And God, it's the same, Lord. It's even better now, Lord Jesus. And I thank you, God, with all my heart, Lord. Blessed be your name this morning, God. Oh Lord, you're worthy, worthy, Jesus, of all praise and honor that we could give you, Lord, forever and ever, Lord. God, I thank you, Jesus.

And we ask that you'll go with us, Lord, and bless us this afternoon, Lord, and be with us in our conversations, Lord. And whatever we do, Lord, we just want to give you all the glory and honor that you do, Lord Jesus. We thank you again in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] September 9th. September the 9th, we're going to have a a a gathering, a youth gathering. September 9th, Brother John Andes is going to speak, and he and I have not talked, but I want to I want to just give a little indication. Brother John, I would like you to give special attention to the fact. Brother John Andy's, many of you have walked here with him and have seen him and he's been raised in the message like a lot of you, a whole lot of you. And I want Brother John, if you would lay down some of these practical things that you know, God had you set down in your life and how he made it real to you and the things that have held you. You we you've seen say, "Oh, well, you see all the exuberance of Brother John. He's always on top and always positive. Just remember one thing. It's not just merely brother John. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; It's God who's not It's God who's not down. &gt;&gt; It's God who's not negative. &gt;&gt; It's God who's positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. And those things really need to be laid down, Brother John. And we're going to have a wonderful evening. And uh I'm not telling you what to do, but I mean, you know, spend a little time on this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know it'll be a real blessing because we we so many of us the congregation here we've observed brother John's life from 15 years old.
