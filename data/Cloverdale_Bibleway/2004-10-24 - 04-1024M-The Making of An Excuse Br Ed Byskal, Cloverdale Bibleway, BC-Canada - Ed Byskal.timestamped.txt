[3:04] Amen. Aren't you glad that you are never

[3:09] &gt;&gt; Song that we're going to I would like to
[3:11] start the song service off this morning
[3:12] with is a song that Sister Margaret sang
[3:15] a while back. He'll do it again. Just
[3:17] take a look where you are, where you are
[3:19] now, where you've been. He'll do it
[3:21] again. There's a a little quote I want
[3:23] to read before we sing. And it's uh it's
[3:27] from Have Have Not I Sent Thee. And it's
[3:29] Brother Brandon preached in Phoenix,
[3:31] Arizona.
[3:33] He says here,
[3:35] "Now if God give you an evidence of the
[3:37] Holy Ghost
[3:39] like he appeared to Moses in the fire
[3:42] back there and let him know that he was
[3:43] God, then then you ought if if you've
[3:47] seen God heal others like Moses throwed
[3:50] his stick down once and he knowed he
[3:52] would do it again, turning it turn it to
[3:54] a serpent, he knowed he was God and that
[3:57] he and then what he done once he can do
[4:00] again.
[4:02] Just like the prophet said to Gideon,
[4:04] "The God of your fathers brought you up
[4:06] out of Egypt and brought all these
[4:08] mercies and things. He will do it
[4:10] again." That's right. Well, the God that
[4:13] healed the sick is a God that healed
[4:15] you. The God that gave the Holy Ghost
[4:18] back there is a God that give it to you.
[4:20] The God that healed Hattie Waldrup there
[4:23] of cancer lying dead in the line will
[4:26] heal you. Sure, he's God. That's all. If
[4:29] you expect to see his mighty miracles
[4:31] and his power, then first accept his
[4:33] word and act upon it. Sure.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you're
[4:37] going through, he is still God. Amen.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; And I just wrote down here
[4:44] this morning, you may be like Sister
[4:45] Hadtie.
[4:47] Or you may have a loved one that's not
[4:49] serving God. He will restore. And I want
[4:51] to tell you that he will restore.
[4:54] He will heal you. He's God. Amen. And
[4:58] that's what we want to sing song this
[5:00] morning. Start song service off. He will
[5:02] do it again. Amen. Sister Margaret.
[5:11] [Music]
[5:25] You may feel down and feel like God has
[5:31] somehow forgotten.
[5:33] [Music]
[5:36] That you are faced with circumstances
[5:41] you can't get through.
[5:46] Right now, it seems like there's no way
[5:50] out and you're going under.
[5:56] But God's proven time and time again,
[6:01] he'll take care of you.
[6:06] And he'll do it again.
[6:09] [Applause]
[6:11] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again.
[6:14] He'll do it again.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you
[6:20] were now, and where you
[6:26] haven't he come through for you.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail?
[6:37] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[6:41] when, but he'll do it again.
[6:45] [Music]
[6:47] God knows the pain that you're going
[6:51] through, and he knows how you're
[6:54] hurting.
[6:58] You see, he knows just like your heart
[7:02] has been broken into.
[7:07] But he's the God of the stars and of the
[7:10] sun and of the sea. And he is your
[7:14] father.
[7:18] He can calm the storm and find a way to
[7:23] fix it for you.
[7:27] And he'll do it again.
[7:32] [Applause]
[7:33] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again.
[7:35] He'll do it in again.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you are
[7:42] now,
[7:43] &gt;&gt; and where you been,
[7:48] he always come through for you.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; He's the same now as then.
[7:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail?
[7:58] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[8:02] it, try to do it again.
[8:07] Oh,
[8:09] he's still God.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; He's still
[8:13] &gt;&gt; and he will not fail you.
[8:17] Oh,
[8:19] he's still God.
[8:24] He will not change.
[8:27] Oh, I know that he's gone.
[8:31] [Music]
[8:33] And he's fighting for you.
[8:39] Just like Moses,
[8:41] &gt;&gt; like Moes.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Just like Daniel.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; Just like Shadrach. Me up and they go.
[8:52] He'll do it again.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; He'll do it again. will do it again.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; If you just take a look at where you are
[9:06] now
[9:08] &gt;&gt; and where you been
[9:11] hasn't he always come through
[9:15] &gt;&gt; for you.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; He's the same now and then.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Don't you know God cannot fail?
[9:22] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[9:26] when. try to do it again.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; And you may not know how.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; You may not know how.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; And you may not know when.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; You may not know when.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; You may not know how. You may not know
[9:47] when.
[9:51] But I'm glad
[9:54] he'll do it again.
[9:58] again.
[10:00] Do it again.
[10:05] [Music]
[10:13] I want the choir to help us. Why don't
[10:15] we all stand? I want to sing. He's the
[10:17] same God who spoke to the woman at the
[10:20] well. The same God that's living in me.

[28:04] preparing, you know, myself for the
[28:07] ministry of the word and listening to
[28:10] our brother Jason as he led the song
[28:13] service. Uh, I I trust that you all were
[28:16] entering in. It certainly sounded like
[28:18] it and uh to have Sister Margaret.
[28:22] Margaret, that song has been on my mind
[28:24] for so long. I was so happy to hear you
[28:26] sing it again. And I really appreciate
[28:28] it. He'll do it again.
[28:31] And you can sing it again. As far as I'm
[28:33] concerned, I think it's good to give him
[28:36] glory. He'll do it again. Hallelujah.
[28:40] I appreciate the congregation.
[28:42] appreciate each one of you and uh God
[28:45] appreciates you.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to be flowery. I'm
[28:50] saying that because often we feel we get
[28:53] lost in the crowd. You're not lost in
[28:56] the crowd. People are uh affected by
[29:01] your presence. Uh, our brother Aubrey
[29:03] Hunt spoke on Wednesday and after the
[29:06] service was over, uh, we just stepped
[29:09] into the back and I said, uh, I said,
[29:13] uh, the church was full. He said,
[29:16] packed.
[29:18] I said, uh, they didn't know you were
[29:20] going to be here. They didn't know there
[29:21] was any guest speaker. I said, that was
[29:23] a a regular Wednesday service.
[29:27] And I said, "Often you find churches
[29:30] that have relaxed
[29:32] and on Wednesday they're not there. Just
[29:35] a very small percentage of people that
[29:37] are there." Yes. He said, as he's
[29:39] traveled around the country, he said,
[29:41] you know, they can't get them out and
[29:44] just on the weekend. I said, well, I
[29:48] said, I've noticed that myself and I
[29:51] appreciate.
[29:52] So you don't know what effect that has
[29:56] on a minister to go home and say it
[29:59] doesn't have to be empty on Wednesday
[30:01] night. There doesn't have to just be a
[30:04] handful there. They they are renewed in
[30:06] their strength and their energy and
[30:08] their vigor and their faith and and you
[30:11] you are the ones that are giving
[30:13] testimony to that. You're testifying to
[30:15] that by your presence. And this morning
[30:18] I could I could wait on God and prepare
[30:22] myself. What good would it be if you
[30:24] weren't here?
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; And you might say, "Well, I'm just one
[30:27] of, you know, a few hundred people that
[30:29] that is irrelevant." You have a very,
[30:32] very real part. And I want to know that
[30:35] I appreciate the congregation. I
[30:38] appreciate the standard, the individual
[30:41] standard. Uh just my wife and I speaking
[30:44] on the way here to church today. If
[30:46] there's anything that I would like to
[30:48] do, I'd like to raise the standard. I'd
[30:51] like to raise it higher. Don't relax it,
[30:54] but raise it higher.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh I appreciate the deacons.
[31:01] Appreciate their wives, their families.
[31:04] Appreciate the standard that they hold,
[31:07] the trustees.
[31:09] Appreciate them. are the Sunday school
[31:14] teachers and how devoted they are. I
[31:17] appreciate that. The school Bible way
[31:20] Christian Academy and the the the
[31:24] teachers how they are giving themselves
[31:27] to our children or the next generation
[31:31] that will fill these important places if
[31:34] the Lord Jesus allows time to go on. So
[31:37] I I certainly appreciate the testimony.
[31:40] We could go back and say, "Well, uh, how
[31:43] was it? You know, don't don't you wish
[31:45] that, uh, it was back when the church
[31:47] was small?" Well, not really. Not
[31:51] really. Uh, uh, I believe that a family
[31:54] needs to be having children. And, uh,
[31:57] and that's what we're doing. Not just
[32:00] physically, even though that is
[32:02] happening, and we're happy for that, but
[32:05] we're we're happy for the spiritual
[32:07] children.
[32:08] And I'm thankful for the testimony that
[32:11] is able to go out. Brother Lance uh
[32:14] Laroo is in Seattle today ministering.
[32:17] I'm thankful for that.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; I'm happy that you can have confidence
[32:22] that such a man as a brother Lance is
[32:25] who you have such confidence in is
[32:28] preaching the gospel, preaching this
[32:31] message in Seattle. and brother Tony and
[32:35] sister Rebecca are in India. Maybe many
[32:39] here perhaps do not know, but they will
[32:41] be visiting Iran on the way back. And
[32:45] you want to pray for them. That is not a
[32:48] very easy place to be in. And we need
[32:52] them to have Holy Spirit direction and
[32:56] wisdom. There is a pastor in Iran and
[32:59] they will be with him. So
[33:03] uh uh the brother from Usbekiststan,
[33:06] brother Anatoli I believe it is, he is
[33:09] still in America and I expect to see him
[33:12] this next week. Uh but he had a very
[33:16] difficult time in Spokane. He was
[33:19] treated very very very badly by some
[33:23] denominational people. Of course, we
[33:25] don't expect an easy time amongst them,
[33:28] but uh but you were a strength to him.
[33:32] You were you ministered something to
[33:34] him, and we're thankful for that. Uh
[33:38] we're thankful also for brother Murphy,
[33:41] the voices, you know, God has chosen
[33:45] that these different ones are called to
[33:49] be in different places and they're
[33:51] gifted in a certain way. I'm so thankful
[33:53] for brother Murphy and the voice that's
[33:56] going into China. You might say one
[33:58] person. Oh, I tell you what, there is
[34:02] there is uh there's response every
[34:05] single week from the internet of people
[34:09] that are hearing the message and
[34:11] receiving the message and several
[34:12] churches have already been established
[34:14] as you know, but we're so thankful for
[34:16] that. And brother Timothy in Vietnam and
[34:20] what has been taking place there.
[34:21] Brother Ernie Bill Noea now in the
[34:25] Philippines. We just said it in passing,
[34:28] but over 3,000
[34:31] ministers, denominational ministers have
[34:34] now been confronted with the message in
[34:37] just the Philippines.
[34:39] and 250 of them, just give or take a
[34:43] few, have been rebaptized in the name of
[34:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and have returned
[34:49] to their congregations and rebaptized as
[34:52] many as would be rebaptized.
[34:54] You say, "Well, uh, it's not going to be
[34:57] great numbers." That's exactly right.
[35:00] But all that effort may be made for one
[35:02] or two,
[35:04] and one is worth 10,000 worlds. Isn't it
[35:06] worth one man going over? Isn't it worth
[35:09] having uh mystery expose or having uh
[35:12] conventions or whatever it takes?
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; We're thankful for that. And so we are
[35:21] we're just happy to be part of this
[35:23] great work.
[35:29] Uh we have an announcement also we would
[35:31] like to make and that is that brother
[35:34] Dalton Harp and sister Teresa Harp and
[35:38] Michael Anderson especially Michael
[35:40] Anderson is happy to make the
[35:43] announcement of their the engagement of
[35:47] Michael Anderson to Alicia Harp and God
[35:50] bless brother Michael to Alicia.
[36:00] And we would ask that
[36:03] uh these young people, we need to really
[36:05] pray for them. I see some, you know,
[36:09] get married and and uh that that's when
[36:11] a lot of, you know, a lot of hardships
[36:14] come, but we're we're we're we have been
[36:17] made to endure whatever hardships come
[36:21] our way. And marriage should be a
[36:23] blissful experience. Remember that,
[36:26] brother Mike.
[36:28] Citricia
[36:32] communion. We're going to have
[36:33] communion, the Lord's table and
[36:34] footwashing next Sunday. Next Sunday
[36:37] evening. And so we we arranged it so
[36:40] that the people in Seattle, Tacoma, and
[36:43] and and in that region can be here
[36:47] because they have a service today. They
[36:48] wouldn't be able to be here tonight. So,
[36:50] they're going to be here uh Lord
[36:53] willing, next Sunday. and we'll have a
[36:55] marvelous time. Brother John Andy's is
[36:57] going to bring us a word that will lead
[36:59] us into the service. I will be here of
[37:01] course. Uh but tonight we're having a
[37:04] baptismal after the service. Brother Tom
[37:06] Ray will be ministering tonight and then
[37:09] we're having a baptismal. There's
[37:10] several that are going to be baptized
[37:12] and we're so thankful for each one. God
[37:16] moves on and uh go to the water and be
[37:19] buried. So, we'll be having a burial
[37:21] tonight and a resurrection
[37:24] &gt;&gt; because we're not going to leave them in
[37:25] the water. They're gonna they're going
[37:27] to come up. Hallelujah. To newness of
[37:29] life.
[37:32] Amen.
[37:34] Uh I want to make sure I don't forget
[37:38] anything.
[37:40] Uh now before we are going to come to
[37:42] the word, I'm just taking a little bit
[37:43] of time this morning. Uh
[37:46] uh we visited uh brother Eddie Childers
[37:49] and Sister Jackie yesterday. Uh we we've
[37:53] been praying and there's been a couple
[37:55] times that they had prayer in the church
[37:57] for brother Eddie who was in the
[37:58] hospital. Well, the thing was he was out
[38:01] of the hospital, but by the time you
[38:03] could almost get the prayer request, he
[38:04] was back in and he was back out. Uh I
[38:08] want to just say a word and you can also
[38:11] be preparing yourself. I'm going to do
[38:13] something a little different this
[38:14] morning. I'm I want to and I feel led to
[38:16] take an offering up for brother Eddie,
[38:20] Sister Jackie Chillers. And you can just
[38:22] be praying about that. Brother Eddie has
[38:26] been on a intervenous for 22 years.
[38:31] 22 years. He has to have the intervenous
[38:33] in his body every night.
[38:36] This last week, one week ago, was the
[38:39] first time in 22 years that he was
[38:44] without an intervenous.
[38:46] And that came as a result of a h of
[38:50] going right, you know, sometimes God
[38:52] allow you to go right to the very limit.
[38:55] And I got a call from his son-in-law,
[38:57] Brother Andy Cox. Actually, called
[38:59] Brother Tom. And they called me right
[39:02] away. And brother Eddie was in the
[39:04] hospital and they could not find a
[39:06] place. He's had the intervenous in him.
[39:10] So over 22 years, they couldn't find a
[39:14] place to insert the uh the unit that
[39:18] needs to have the intervenous
[39:20] permanently in his body and it wouldn't
[39:22] work. And they had no way and didn't
[39:26] look like he could live. It come right
[39:28] down. Sister Jackie, I spoke with her
[39:30] then and she said, "He's been a good
[39:33] man. He's been a good father. He's been
[39:35] a good husband."
[39:37] Sister Jackie, you you don't know it as
[39:39] a congregation, but I prayed. I flew to
[39:42] Ohio
[39:44] and prayed for Brother Eddie Chillers
[39:46] when he was just a young man. He was all
[39:49] ballooned and swelled out. He was laying
[39:52] on a hospital bed in his house. He was
[39:55] just a young man. And I walked into that
[39:58] room and it didn't seem like there was
[40:01] any way for this young man to live.
[40:04] And I was there to pray for him. And
[40:08] really, I can tell you that there was no
[40:10] great mountain of faith in my heart. I
[40:13] just I was one perhaps of many, many
[40:16] that prayed for brother Eddie. Little
[40:19] did I ever realize that he and his wife
[40:21] and his family would be in our church 25
[40:25] years later. and sister Jackie's mother,
[40:28] our sister Ellen Whitten, who's sitting
[40:30] here today, and we're so happy that
[40:32] she's here. But this brother has
[40:35] suffered incredibly.
[40:38] We don't question God, and we don't know
[40:40] why, but he came right to the very
[40:43] limits and the doctors could not find a
[40:45] place and that would be the end of the
[40:47] road for him.
[40:49] And they need and his body was ravaged
[40:52] with infection.
[40:54] So they were trying to taking several
[40:56] multiple kinds of of of medication every
[41:00] day and now he had an infection. and
[41:03] they couldn't they couldn't overcome
[41:04] this infection and somehow God
[41:07] intervened and uh and a a Jewish doctor
[41:12] by the name of Levenson
[41:14] came in
[41:16] and he said to him something about
[41:18] Abraham and he said you got he said to
[41:21] Eddie he said you got to get rid of your
[41:23] gods.
[41:25] Brother Eddie doesn't know what he's
[41:26] talking about. And he pointed to the
[41:31] intervenous poll
[41:33] and he says this, you got to get rid of
[41:36] these gods. You're depending on that,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:40] &gt;&gt; And it really spoke to his heart and and
[41:44] they couldn't really do it medically.
[41:47] So, uh anyway, he went home. They sent
[41:51] him home and uh and and and now he
[41:54] doesn't have the intervenous. He can't
[41:56] depend on this god. So he goes without
[41:59] it. And his body has been responding.
[42:02] This is the last this last week he's
[42:05] been one week without the intervenous
[42:08] &gt;&gt; and we want to pray for him. They're
[42:10] they're just depending. They're doing
[42:12] everything. Now let me tell you, Sister
[42:14] Jackie Childers, I have such you don't
[42:17] mind me taking a few moments. I have
[42:19] such respect for her. She learned
[42:21] because of this condition of her
[42:23] husband, she took up nursing and become
[42:26] a full-fledged nurse just to treat her
[42:30] husband. Now that's a wife. That's a
[42:33] real wife. And she's devoted herself.
[42:35] And the reason I want to take an
[42:36] offering right now is because she's not
[42:40] even working. She just has quit working
[42:43] because she feels that she needs to
[42:45] spend her entire time and just devoting
[42:48] everything. She's trying to find every
[42:50] little way to for him to get the
[42:52] nutrient because because he's had multi
[42:54] he's had so many operations. I couldn't
[42:57] even count them. Said operation after
[43:00] operation and they kept removing of the
[43:03] intestine and he only has just a short
[43:06] little piece of intestine. So the food
[43:08] that goes to into his body hasn't got
[43:11] time to give him the nutrients into his
[43:15] system. And that is that's the way he's
[43:17] lived all these years. And so he's
[43:20] trusted intervenous. Now the intervenous
[43:22] isn't there. And we're trusting God.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said however God chooses
[43:28] to do it. We're we're we're just happy.
[43:31] I want to sing. God's already provided.
[43:35] Amen.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Let the deacons come.
[43:39] Let us give out of our hearts of
[43:42] compassion
[43:44] to our brother and sister and their and
[43:46] their their need at this time. God knows
[43:49] their need.
[43:51] Hallelujah.
[43:53] If we all just do a little bit, it'll be
[43:57] sufficient.
[43:58] You give as the Lord leads you.
[44:01] He's already
[44:06] droed.
[44:08] [Music]
[44:29] every proise you can claim.
[44:36] Just asking if Jesus name
[44:42] everything you need.
[44:47] He's alreadyed
[44:51] once again.
[44:54] He's already
[44:58] provided.
[45:01] He's already
[45:05] provided.
[45:06] [Music]
[45:09] Everything
[45:11] you need is already provided.
[45:20] Every promise you can claim
[45:27] just ask it in Jesus name.
[45:33] Everything you need.
[45:37] He's already provided.
[45:41] Just once more now.
[45:44] He's already
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:49] You've provided
[45:52] already.
[45:54] [Music]
[45:56] Oh,
[45:59] everything
[46:00] in me, he's already proided.
[46:10] Every pro you can claim
[46:16] just ask it in Jesus name.
[46:22] Everything you need.
[46:26] He's already provided.
[46:29] [Music]
[46:33] Hallelujah. We're also thankful that God
[46:36] has provided
[46:38] wonderfully
[46:41] for many of the believers in Granada.
[46:45] They've all lost their homes. Many about
[46:47] 15 homes and men of vision have taken it
[46:51] upon themselves and the brothers that
[46:54] are working. Our brother Randy Snow is
[46:57] here from Phoenix today. and brother
[47:00] Randy and brother Rod Bergen, brother
[47:03] Kenard. Brother Kennardil is in Trinidad
[47:06] this morning with brother Vin and
[47:09] because there's a there's at least two
[47:12] contractors that are prepared to go over
[47:15] and through brother Randy has knows uh
[47:19] the CEO of Swift Transport who has over
[47:23] a thousand trucks in Phoenix and they
[47:26] have donated some containers and uh some
[47:30] other uh building supply companies are
[47:33] giving their lumber and everything. And
[47:35] they've got to write down to the stick,
[47:37] every 2x4 and where it goes and how many
[47:40] this house needs, how many that needs.
[47:43] They want now to build 15. These are not
[47:45] homes like we have here. These are like
[47:47] 16x 20, maybe 16 by 24 buildings, just
[47:51] frame buildings. And and and then these
[47:54] brothers are willing to go over and to
[47:57] organize and to oversee it. And brother
[48:00] Ken is on his way to Granada tomorrow
[48:03] morning, I believe, with brother Vin.
[48:05] And but we're working beyond the uh
[48:09] pastors and churches, if you understand,
[48:12] because sometimes, you know, it's
[48:13] natural for a pastor to want to see his
[48:16] own people benefited, but we're working
[48:18] outside of that. We're we're working
[48:20] with all of those that are in need, and
[48:22] we just want to have those things done.
[48:25] We thank those here who have given. And
[48:28] I have personally a very great interest
[48:31] in seeing men of vision. They they don't
[48:34] communicate really what they do and God
[48:36] bless them for being humble but
[48:37] sometimes you have to tell what is
[48:39] happening. And so do pray for them
[48:42] because there's a there's a if you
[48:45] haven't heard about 50%
[48:48] of the nutmeg
[48:51] which is per which is in the world comes
[48:54] from Granada. their entire fields are
[48:58] gone. It looks like it's been bombed.
[49:00] They said it'll be many years before the
[49:04] farmers and the people who make their
[49:06] living. That's one of the only
[49:08] industries they have is growing nutmeg.
[49:10] And it'll be years before those farms
[49:13] can be back up because the trees are
[49:15] gone, the bushes are gone, everything's
[49:17] gone. Looks like it's been total total
[49:20] devastation. Looks like a war zone and
[49:23] they don't even know how they're going
[49:24] to live. So the first thing is important
[49:26] that we help them believers. We're we
[49:29] are helping believers and I think we
[49:31] ought to the least we can do is pray and
[49:33] to do all that we can that these
[49:35] brothers are able to fulfill the purpose
[49:39] and and once it gets there there's that
[49:42] they they don't even know because
[49:43] there's no infrastructure to get it to
[49:45] the different locations. And so pray
[49:48] that we'll have that the brothers will
[49:50] find the right people who will have the
[49:53] who will have the burden on their heart
[49:55] to make certain that these materials get
[49:58] and are used for the purpose that
[50:00] they're given. Will you do that with us?
[50:02] Amen. God bless you and God bless you,
[50:04] brother Randy. We'll not forget what it
[50:06] is you brothers are doing.
[50:10] mind standing now?
[50:18] We're going to be reading from the
[50:19] Bible.
[50:21] But before we turn to the Bible, I
[50:23] realize I'm being rather lengthy this
[50:24] morning.
[50:27] I
[50:29] I held this book up, this little book,
[50:33] Understanding the Old Testament, by some
[50:35] Hebrew scholars. I thought we could get
[50:38] 250 to 300 of them. We can only get 150.
[50:42] So, anyone who wants one, uh, you want
[50:45] to get your name into the office. After
[50:47] 150, we don't have any more available.
[50:50] And these are just on their way. This is
[50:52] what I'm so thankful how we have been
[50:55] instructed by a prophet of God.
[50:59] Aren't you?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And he has even instructed us as to
[51:03] which Bible we should read.
[51:06] And listen what these listen what these
[51:08] scholars have said about the King James
[51:11] version of the Bible.
[51:13] In quoting the Bible that throughout
[51:16] this book in quoting the Bible we
[51:20] intentionally used an old translation
[51:24] the King James version and not one of
[51:27] the modern translations whose language
[51:30] is more attuned to modern times. The
[51:33] translation was completed at the
[51:36] beginning of the 17th century in the
[51:38] days of William Shakes Shakespeare by a
[51:42] group of scholars from among his circle.
[51:45] Its archaic language is in harmony with
[51:49] the Hebrew Bible both in its majesty and
[51:53] in its simplicity. There is no other
[51:56] translation that preserves the flavor of
[52:00] the Hebrew Bible better than this one.
[52:03] Of the King James version, one is
[52:06] tempted to speculate that had the Bible
[52:09] originally been in English, this is the
[52:12] way it would have been written.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that marvelous?
[52:18] &gt;&gt; And here we have a prophet
[52:21] &gt;&gt; come and say, "That's the Bible to read.
[52:25] Hallelujah. That's the Bible to read.
[52:28] Hallelujah. And you're all holding it
[52:30] this morning. If it' been written in
[52:32] English, you got it right there.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:38] We're going to turn to Luke's Gospel,
[52:40] the 14th chapter.
[52:43] But before we read, we're going to pray.
[52:47] Heavenly Father,
[52:50] we've taken time feeling so at home with
[52:54] the family of God
[52:57] and the internet congregation, Lord,
[52:59] that is also gathered listening from
[53:03] home to home and place to place from
[53:05] country to country, wherever they are at
[53:07] this moment. and the letters that I've
[53:10] received Lord even just this last week
[53:13] so encouraging
[53:15] how the people are so appreciative of
[53:18] the streaming the uh and being enabling
[53:22] them to be joining with us and I pray
[53:26] that the holy presence of the holy God
[53:29] the God of Israel the God of Abraham
[53:31] Isaac and Jacob the God and father of
[53:34] our Lord Jesus Christ who sent him as a
[53:36] sacrifice for our sins s and hung there
[53:40] and paid the full debt upon the cross.
[53:42] And today we stand justified,
[53:45] sanctified, and glorified in your
[53:48] presence. We thank you, Lord, for the
[53:50] great things that you are doing. Bless
[53:52] all the brethren, Lord, that have gone
[53:54] out from the congregation and are
[53:57] engaged in one way or another. Bless
[53:59] this congregation, Lord, and all who are
[54:02] who are your witnesses. I pray that they
[54:05] will be witnesses by the power of the
[54:07] Holy Spirit. Instruct us this morning.
[54:09] Guide us, oh God. We pray. I ask that
[54:12] you'll bless every minister, Lord. And I
[54:15] pray, Father, that you'll bless, Lord
[54:18] Jesus, the the endeavor of the word this
[54:20] morning by the Holy Spirit. Man can do
[54:23] nothing, Lord. We are the arm of flesh
[54:26] will fail us, but the arm of Christ, our
[54:29] almighty God will never fail. We pray
[54:32] father that you will anoint by the holy
[54:35] spirit both hearers and the speaker in
[54:38] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[54:42] I want to read from Luke 14 starting
[54:44] with verse 16
[54:50] about 10 verses. Then said he unto them,
[54:54] "A certain man made a great supper, and
[54:57] bade many, and sent his servant at
[54:59] supper time to say to them that were
[55:03] bidden, come, for all things are ready."
[55:06] If you'll notice, he sent his servant,
[55:09] singular,
[55:11] at supper time, which is evening time,
[55:14] to say to them that were bidden, "Come,
[55:17] for all things are now ready." And they
[55:20] all with one consent began to make an ex
[55:23] began to make excuse. The first one said
[55:26] unto him, I have bought a piece of
[55:29] ground and I must need to go and see it.
[55:32] I pray thee have me excused. And another
[55:35] said, I have bought five yolk of oxen,
[55:38] and I go to prove them. I pray thee,
[55:41] have me excused. And another said, I
[55:44] have married a wife, and therefore I
[55:46] cannot come. So that servant came and
[55:50] showed his lord these things. Then the
[55:53] master of the house being angry said to
[55:56] his servant, "Go out quickly into the
[55:58] streets and lanes of the city and bring
[56:01] in hither the poor and the maimed and
[56:03] the halt and the blind." And the Lord
[56:06] and the servant said, Lord, it is done
[56:08] as thou hast commanded. And yet there is
[56:11] room. And the Lord said unto the
[56:13] servant, "Go out into the highways and
[56:16] hedges, and compel them to come in that
[56:18] my house may be filled. For I say unto
[56:21] you, that none of those men which were
[56:23] bidden shall taste of my supper." And
[56:27] there went a great multitude with him.
[56:31] And he turned and said unto them, "If
[56:34] any man come after me, come to me and
[56:37] hate not his father and mother and wife
[56:39] and children and brethren and sisters,
[56:42] yay, in his own life also he cannot be
[56:46] my disciple. And who do whosoever does
[56:48] not bear his cross and come after me
[56:52] cannot be my disciple." Amen. God bless
[56:55] his word to our hearts. as you have your
[56:57] seats.
[57:11] I'd like to speak on a rather strange
[57:14] subject and I wrestled with the title
[57:15] because I wanted to call it something
[57:17] else
[57:19] but I had difficulty so I'm just staying
[57:21] with it. It's not doesn't sound very
[57:23] spiritual, but it's entitled the making
[57:26] of an excuse.
[57:29] Brother Brandham says about our enemy,
[57:33] Satan. And it's good that we know his
[57:36] tactics.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; He speaks about a boxer. He said, "If
[57:40] you're a boxer, you study your opponent.
[57:44] You study his licks. You study how he
[57:46] moves." and they they watch them very
[57:49] very carefully and they train according
[57:51] to that so they can they know what their
[57:54] opponent is about to do. Sometimes I
[57:57] think we get we get a a knock on the
[58:00] side of the head sometime because we
[58:02] haven't really paid attention to our
[58:04] opponent's tactics. That's the purpose
[58:07] one of the purposes this morning. It
[58:09] will not be a negative message but it is
[58:12] that we might understand his tactics.
[58:15] And some of the things I'm speaking is
[58:17] from my own uh my own experience of the
[58:20] things that I've seen over the years.
[58:23] Now this great supper
[58:26] there is the supper, the invitation and
[58:30] the excuse. Those three things which we
[58:33] hope to kind of cover. The supper
[58:36] according to uh the encyclopedia
[58:39] is the last meal of the day or an
[58:42] evening banquet.
[58:45] That is the supper. And uh the the
[58:48] scripture says it's a great supper.
[58:52] Uh now the supper which we are speaking
[58:56] of and participating in is a people that
[59:00] have been invited to feed on the body
[59:03] word of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are
[59:06] feeding even now as we hear things that
[59:10] you wouldn't hear elsewhere. And I was
[59:12] so conscious of this even on this last
[59:15] little trip as we spoke to different
[59:18] ones whether it was in Israel or whether
[59:20] it was in Greece or whether it was in
[59:22] Turkey and we would just throw out
[59:26] little tidbits of things from the
[59:29] message. Uh the it was evident on the
[59:33] people's face in their eyes. They've
[59:37] never heard such things. And you can
[59:40] tell right away. And here we are freely
[59:43] feeding, freely invited to a a a
[59:47] banquet, an evening banquet. And I must
[59:51] say that we should be and never cease to
[59:54] be so thankful for the things that we're
[59:57] able to feed on and participate in.
[1:00:01] And the great supper uh is a is a word
[1:00:05] that being great is a word that you're
[1:00:07] quite familiar with. We use it all the
[1:00:09] time, mega. And it's a in the Greek it's
[1:00:12] megas. Uh but it is to be splendid
[1:00:16] prepared on a grand scale.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; You can't appreciate something unless
[1:00:22] you understand really what has taken
[1:00:25] place.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a it's a it's a concern.
[1:00:30] I have a concern lest we uh just take
[1:00:34] take it for granted. Oh, I'll just go to
[1:00:36] service. I'll just, you know, I'll just
[1:00:38] sit and read a message book. But when we
[1:00:42] pick it up, you know, when you take it
[1:00:44] in your hand, I've traveled a lot and
[1:00:46] when I take up a book, I have such an
[1:00:48] appreciation realizing that there is
[1:00:51] just tens of millions of people and
[1:00:53] there's a lot of people who wish they
[1:00:55] could go to the cabinet or wish they
[1:00:57] could go to a shelf and pick one up, but
[1:00:59] I haven't got it. That's what drives me
[1:01:01] on, drives us on to do everything that
[1:01:05] we can to discharge our responsibility
[1:01:08] to see that people will have and feed on
[1:01:11] the same thing we're feeding on. Can you
[1:01:13] say amen?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; So, it's a mega supper. It's a mega uh
[1:01:18] banquet. It's an evening meal. It's a
[1:01:21] splendid uh banquet on a great scale, a
[1:01:25] stately banquet. And it says further
[1:01:29] these are uh things that are uh God's
[1:01:32] preeminent blessings and furthermore of
[1:01:36] things which overstep
[1:01:39] it and I'm going to give you it exactly
[1:01:41] the way it is in the encyclopedia
[1:01:43] overstep called the province of of man
[1:01:47] or province of a created being and
[1:01:52] province we live in a province Canada
[1:01:54] you United States has states and we have
[1:01:56] provinces
[1:01:57] A province is it's it's it simply means
[1:02:00] it's an old English term which is
[1:02:02] bounded by certain boundaries. This is a
[1:02:05] a certain sphere. We have a boundary
[1:02:08] between British Columbia and Alberta and
[1:02:10] north between the Yukon and and British
[1:02:12] Columbia and the ocean on this side and
[1:02:14] the United States on that side. And this
[1:02:16] is the province and the laws of this
[1:02:19] province this sphere do not exceed those
[1:02:22] boundaries.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; That is the sphere. It could be of the
[1:02:26] province of a judge and that judge will
[1:02:29] have a certain judicial responsibility
[1:02:33] and his sphere of authority cannot
[1:02:36] exceed the province of his uh of of his
[1:02:40] sphere. It cannot go beyond that. He has
[1:02:43] no jurisdiction beyond his his uh
[1:02:47] responsibility or the area the sphere of
[1:02:50] his of his charge. That's the full
[1:02:52] limit. But this says now mega in the
[1:02:55] Greek is that a a great supper. This is
[1:03:00] something that is beyond the sphere of
[1:03:04] human created being
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; and this meal that we have has come to
[1:03:11] us announced when you have tapes that
[1:03:13] you can hear it. Oh, that's just a tape.
[1:03:16] Now don't think that don't think that
[1:03:18] that is just something that we oh well
[1:03:20] we've had that for years. We've heard
[1:03:22] that for years. But but when you hear
[1:03:25] that prophet messenger and you hear the
[1:03:29] revealing of the secret of the heart,
[1:03:32] that is a mega supper.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; That individual is hearing things
[1:03:37] they've never heard before. They've
[1:03:40] never had a person come and tell them
[1:03:43] the very secret of their heart because
[1:03:46] that is now a a mega supper. It is
[1:03:49] reaching beyond the ability and the
[1:03:54] sphere of human knowledge and reaching
[1:03:57] beyond the ability of the human strength
[1:04:01] or the human uh ability and and that is
[1:04:05] what Mega he prepared a great supper.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; God has prepared this supper and has
[1:04:12] brought it to us on an announcement that
[1:04:15] this is not a man speaking.
[1:04:18] This is not just a man's knowledge. This
[1:04:21] is not a man's idea of what's in this
[1:04:23] book. This is God's knowledge coming
[1:04:26] through a human vessel and showing that
[1:04:29] it's beyond the sphere of created being.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You understand what
[1:04:35] I'm saying? And this has been the the
[1:04:38] the supper now is not merely some
[1:04:42] doctrine or some new thing that's been
[1:04:44] said or some church that just thinks uh
[1:04:47] a little differently than the other
[1:04:48] church on the corner. If that's all we
[1:04:50] are, we should shut the doors and go
[1:04:52] home. This is a great supper that we've
[1:04:56] been invited to that we are
[1:04:58] participating in. And we need to know
[1:05:01] what kind of a meal that God has
[1:05:03] prepared for us.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And the invitation, the invitation,
[1:05:11] you might have said, "Well, I heard I
[1:05:13] heard about the message a certain way. I
[1:05:16] was uh I was a God spoke to me and dealt
[1:05:19] with me a certain way, but let me just
[1:05:21] go back. Let me just go back a wee bit.
[1:05:24] I only go back just within this
[1:05:26] generation.
[1:05:28] This gospel did not come to us down easy
[1:05:32] street.
[1:05:33] This gospel did not come to us on a
[1:05:37] golden platter.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; God turned, he took his servant and took
[1:05:43] our precious brother Brandham. And I
[1:05:45] tell you, many people have had have uh
[1:05:49] difficulty in their lives, have had
[1:05:51] sorrows in their lives. But God took
[1:05:54] because he had to be a vessel. That
[1:05:56] would be that through whom he would
[1:05:58] reveal the son of man was Jesus Christ.
[1:06:01] And Jesus Christ was the grain, the
[1:06:04] sheath that came up out of the earth,
[1:06:07] was ground into the sorrows of humanity
[1:06:11] until he became the fine flour that
[1:06:14] could be baked and produce the bread of
[1:06:17] life and a vessel that God would use to
[1:06:22] to reveal the son of man in the end time
[1:06:26] was not one who could come out of the
[1:06:28] flowery uh schools of of of high
[1:06:32] education or some seminary or through
[1:06:36] some life of ease. He had to come out of
[1:06:38] poverty. He had to come out of reproach.
[1:06:41] He had to come so he could be
[1:06:43] misunderstood. He had to live with that
[1:06:45] kind of a life. You understand? He could
[1:06:48] not come the way maybe you and I come.
[1:06:50] And then he had to have this thing
[1:06:52] within him that he could not understand.
[1:06:54] this mysterious, this mystic thing is
[1:06:57] always reaching out trying to
[1:06:59] understand, trying to understand what is
[1:07:01] this? What is this voice? What is this
[1:07:03] thing that I feel? Why am I so strange?
[1:07:06] Why am I so odd? Why am I so different?
[1:07:09] And live year after year after year, not
[1:07:12] understanding why am I this way? Telling
[1:07:14] his wife, I got to go. I'm going to go
[1:07:16] into a cave. I'm going to go into the
[1:07:18] wilderness. I won't be back till I
[1:07:20] understand it. And if I don't understand
[1:07:21] it, I won't come back. I've just got to
[1:07:23] find out. I'm I you know thinking that
[1:07:26] are we losing our senses? Are we losing
[1:07:28] our our our mental capacity? You
[1:07:31] understand that God was preparing he was
[1:07:34] writing his invitation.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; It wasn't coming easy.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; The invitation didn't come on easy
[1:07:41] street friends. The thing that you have
[1:07:43] heard didn't come to you easy. It came
[1:07:45] by God grinding a grinding a human
[1:07:48] vessel down causing him sorrow and grief
[1:07:52] and and despair not knowing how his
[1:07:56] future would even be in taking his wife
[1:07:58] and taking his child one right after
[1:08:01] another such and such sadness and such
[1:08:03] sorrow. You say well a lot of people
[1:08:05] have lost it. Yes. But if you just read
[1:08:07] the whole life story and understand when
[1:08:10] I read life story, it's not just life
[1:08:11] story of a man, but it is a God
[1:08:14] preparing an invitation.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And you have to understand the
[1:08:19] invitation in order to understand the
[1:08:22] excuse.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You have to understand the invitation.
[1:08:26] You have to understand that God himself,
[1:08:29] Almighty God, I hope you can hear me
[1:08:31] good and I hope I can speak it clearly.
[1:08:34] But Almighty God out of his very bosom,
[1:08:37] he wanted to take the last generation,
[1:08:41] the people of the last age, and he's
[1:08:43] going to prepare them something special.
[1:08:46] Not just a supper, but a mega supper, a
[1:08:49] great supper. He's going to prepare them
[1:08:52] something that has been sealed
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; through the generations,
[1:08:58] been sealed through the ages. And God
[1:09:01] sat back while people probed and
[1:09:04] presumed and tried to see and tried to
[1:09:08] understand and they studied and they
[1:09:10] spent late nights and early mornings and
[1:09:13] they went to different schools and
[1:09:16] education whatever more trying to get a
[1:09:18] grasp upon these mysteries and God's
[1:09:21] holding it back simply saying you're
[1:09:23] fine people maybe you're sincere it's
[1:09:26] not the time it's not the time but
[1:09:29] finally it came the Time to send that
[1:09:31] last messenger out of his right hand.
[1:09:34] Now I'm going to prepare a great supper.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the province
[1:09:42] of man.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the human
[1:09:46] ability.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to reach beyond the human the
[1:09:50] human understanding. I'll simply take
[1:09:53] control of the mouth, bypass the mind,
[1:09:56] and speak the very word of God.
[1:10:00] Hallelujah. The lamb will take the book
[1:10:02] and the book will be tore open and I
[1:10:05] will speak the things that need to be
[1:10:08] made known before I bring the world to
[1:10:10] judgment.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; I will reinstate and restate the word
[1:10:15] the way it was spoken in the first
[1:10:17] place.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; This supper
[1:10:30] was so great
[1:10:32] that would extend beyond
[1:10:35] the realm of human mind.
[1:10:43] It's confirmed by signs and wonders
[1:10:46] and miracles of all kinds.
[1:10:50] And that is why right in the end
[1:10:53] of the ministry, brother Brandon would
[1:10:56] make this statement. The son of man is
[1:10:57] Christ.
[1:10:59] The supper we're talking about is
[1:11:01] Christ.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; He's the one you're feeding on.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one who said, "Except you eat
[1:11:08] my flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:11:10] life in you." And that was the very
[1:11:12] statement that caused them to turn away.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You'd think the very invitation, they
[1:11:18] didn't understand the invitation. And
[1:11:19] that was an invitation.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; He was saying to them, "Except you eat
[1:11:24] my flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:11:26] life in you."
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "What do you
[1:11:29] think a doctor or a nurse thought of
[1:11:31] that kind of a statement?" He didn't
[1:11:33] explain it.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He didn't explain the invitation, but
[1:11:37] that was an invitation.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't understand it. Because
[1:11:42] they didn't understand it, they turned
[1:11:44] it aside.
[1:11:47] But he said, "You're not feeding on a
[1:11:50] man. A man's words will fail." What's he
[1:11:53] talking about? Words that won't fail.
[1:11:56] But you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:11:59] word of the son of man. I say to this
[1:12:02] congregation today that is a across the
[1:12:05] whole spectrum of age right from young
[1:12:07] children to elder people. I say to this
[1:12:12] congregation as one that has walked this
[1:12:14] way for many many years and been with
[1:12:16] you for many many years.
[1:12:19] You will never regret
[1:12:22] serving God with every ounce of your
[1:12:25] strength. You'll never regret being
[1:12:28] faithful to Christ and to the house of
[1:12:31] God. You'll never regret it.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You will never regret it. I'll stand
[1:12:38] before God with these words falling from
[1:12:41] my lips. You'll never regret it.
[1:12:47] The invitation, I refer to it as your
[1:12:50] invitation. an invitation of compassion,
[1:12:55] of loving kindness, of mercy, and of
[1:12:57] grace.
[1:13:00] The Apostle Paul said, "And we know that
[1:13:03] all things work together for good to
[1:13:05] them that love God, to them who are the
[1:13:08] called according to his purpose." The
[1:13:10] called is the invited,
[1:13:13] according to his purpose. Moreover,
[1:13:15] verse 30 of chapter 8, whom he did
[1:13:19] predestinate,
[1:13:21] them he also called, and whom he called,
[1:13:24] them he also justified, and whom he
[1:13:27] justified, them he also glorified. The
[1:13:30] Greek dagot says, "And those whom he pre
[1:13:34] predetermined,
[1:13:36] he also invited." He predetermined it
[1:13:40] and invited you.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? God predetermined it.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; I don't know who's predetermined. God
[1:13:49] knows.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; But whoever he predetermined, he invited
[1:13:52] them.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And whom he invited, those he also
[1:13:58] justified. You've been invited. So he
[1:14:00] justified you. And whom he justified,
[1:14:03] them he also glorified.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; He sent it on the wings of a snow white
[1:14:08] dove.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; The invitation. I'm talking about the
[1:14:11] invitation.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; When I read the life story or even
[1:14:15] reflect on the life story, I say
[1:14:19] God didn't just do that to brother
[1:14:21] Brandham. God did that to him for me.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; They say 68 million martyrs died. They
[1:14:29] preserved the word of God. They
[1:14:31] preserved the testimony. They wouldn't
[1:14:33] bow. They wouldn't ban. They wouldn't
[1:14:35] burn.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; They did it for you and I.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; They held the testimony through the Old
[1:14:44] Testament for you and for me that we
[1:14:46] could have a true today.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ went every step
[1:14:51] that he went on your behalf and on my
[1:14:54] behalf. It's not just a record of a man
[1:14:56] of the son of God, Jesus Christ
[1:14:59] enduring what he endured, but every day
[1:15:02] it was for me and for you.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's all part of the invitation. It
[1:15:07] was sent because that was his purpose.
[1:15:11] Now Jesus is telling us in this parable
[1:15:15] in this account
[1:15:18] he's telling us of this great supper
[1:15:21] and it came in three stages.
[1:15:24] The message came in three pulls
[1:15:29] to those who for various reasons
[1:15:33] all made excuse. That was number one.
[1:15:37] Number two was to the poor, the maimed,
[1:15:40] the halt, and the blind. It was a great
[1:15:42] healing ministry.
[1:15:44] And the third was go out into the
[1:15:46] highways and the hedges and compel them
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; to come in.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; I can assure you that in this last age,
[1:15:56] from my own personal testimony, I was
[1:16:00] compelled.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I was compelled
[1:16:05] in spite of no one else around me that
[1:16:08] was actually a believer at that time. We
[1:16:10] didn't have the support structure of the
[1:16:12] kind of congregation that you're able to
[1:16:14] sit in this morning. But I can tell you
[1:16:16] that God God's work in the individual
[1:16:19] life is so compelling
[1:16:22] that it is your circumstances around you
[1:16:25] become irrelevant.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Say I don't have anybody beside me. So
[1:16:29] what?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I don't have anybody to lean on. So
[1:16:33] what? My financial situation's not that
[1:16:36] good. So what? That has nothing to do
[1:16:38] with it. Has nothing to do with it. Has
[1:16:41] nothing to do with it. You understand
[1:16:43] what I'm saying? Be it becomes so
[1:16:45] compelling. You become so focused. You
[1:16:48] become fanatical. You become heretical.
[1:16:51] Call me what you will. Call me insane.
[1:16:53] Call me whatever you want to, but I must
[1:16:56] go this way.
[1:16:58] I'm compelled.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; This has been a compelling thing. This
[1:17:03] is not hoham, you know, maybe sort of
[1:17:06] thing. This is the direction that I must
[1:17:08] go.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; I'm headed for the kingdom
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and I can't stop.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; What if this happens? So what? That has
[1:17:16] nothing to do with it. You can have the
[1:17:18] greatest upheaval. You can have the
[1:17:20] greatest loss. You can have the greatest
[1:17:22] reversal. You can have the greatest
[1:17:24] sickness or disease. whatever it is, but
[1:17:27] I cannot change my course. I'm headed
[1:17:29] for the kingdom.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Nobody convinced us of this doctrine.
[1:17:34] God revealed it.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; If you became convinced because somebody
[1:17:39] was a good speaker, then perhaps you can
[1:17:41] get argued out of it. If you got argued
[1:17:43] into it, you can get argued out of it.
[1:17:45] But when God reveals it, nobody can
[1:17:48] argue out of it. It has become a part of
[1:17:51] you. You cannot escape it.
[1:17:54] It's been revealed to you.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus Christ, the son of man
[1:18:00] that I'm feeding upon.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; If it's just a support group of a
[1:18:05] church, you can be persuaded about
[1:18:08] something else that might be better for
[1:18:10] you.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham actually ties Luke 14
[1:18:17] to Matthew.
[1:18:20] We won't turn to it, but in Matthew, I
[1:18:22] believe chapter 22
[1:18:24] down from verse 1 to4,
[1:18:28] it is those that were invited to a
[1:18:30] wedding.
[1:18:32] Don't forget the wedding is now.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; And if you don't come to the wedding,
[1:18:39] and they all had excuses, too. If you
[1:18:41] don't come to the wedding, certainly
[1:18:43] won't go to the wedding supper.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; You're invited to a marriage. You're
[1:18:48] invited to be a participant of the union
[1:18:52] between yourself and Christ. And if you
[1:18:55] are not united to this Christ, this
[1:18:58] revealed Christ in this hour, how we
[1:19:01] expect to go to a wedding supper
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; in message proving his word.
[1:19:09] says the bridegroom
[1:19:12] will come right through this
[1:19:16] when the son of man will come down
[1:19:20] and come into human flesh
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; to unite the two together.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; do you hear that?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; That is what we have seen. That's what
[1:19:32] we've lived. That is what has
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; been part and parcel of our invitation.
[1:19:37] when the the bridegroom that's Christ
[1:19:42] will come through this when the son of
[1:19:45] man will come down and come in human
[1:19:48] flesh to unite the two together. Catch
[1:19:52] this please.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I said earlier said earlier
[1:19:57] that
[1:19:59] a great supper
[1:20:02] is something it's megas it's mega it
[1:20:06] extends beyond the province or the
[1:20:09] boundaries of human of created being.
[1:20:14] So a human vessel stands and God that
[1:20:20] part. Now there's a man born of a woman
[1:20:24] born in sin like everyone else shaped in
[1:20:27] iniquities had a seventh grade
[1:20:29] education. I want I need you to see this
[1:20:31] so you catch the rest of my message. and
[1:20:34] he stands there and uh some uh
[1:20:38] supernatural
[1:20:40] act of almighty God takes a vessel. So
[1:20:44] he scarcely knows what realm he's in,
[1:20:47] what world he's in, slips into another
[1:20:50] dimension back and forth. What is it?
[1:20:52] When he slips in another dimension, he's
[1:20:54] extended beyond the province of man.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It's no longer man.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's God.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; That part is not man. That's God.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; It's God that's taking God beyond the
[1:21:10] province of man speaking. There's a
[1:21:13] woman down here. Uh the light is over
[1:21:15] her. What light? You can't see it. No
[1:21:17] one else sees it. Where is it? It's
[1:21:19] beyond the province of man. It's beyond
[1:21:21] these eyes. It's beyond these ears.
[1:21:24] doing that to catch the attention of the
[1:21:26] people so that they might be uh that
[1:21:30] they might be so impressed uh concerning
[1:21:32] the invitation
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; that they're receiving beyond. And
[1:21:38] that's what you and I will give an
[1:21:39] account for
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; because that's not man, that's God.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Now it's God
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; speaking through a prophet. in that that
[1:21:49] was the son of man come into human flesh
[1:21:53] to unite the two the son of man
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom
[1:21:59] stepping down by spirit into human flesh
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; which we call that a prophet
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; so that through that prophet you will
[1:22:09] hear the word that goes beyond the
[1:22:12] province of man beyond his seventh grade
[1:22:15] education had nothing to do with it by
[1:22:18] past it. So you go out, catch and smite
[1:22:21] the heart of the people and speak a word
[1:22:24] out of the scripture. Say, "I never saw
[1:22:26] that before." What is it? It's God going
[1:22:29] beyond the province of man. Oh my
[1:22:32] people. Do you hear what I'm saying this
[1:22:34] morning? And it is that part that God
[1:22:37] was anchoring and catching the heart of
[1:22:39] the people to draw them into this
[1:22:41] invitation.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; To unite you
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; To unite you to the bridegroom.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You followed me.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Have you followed me thus far?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; You understand it? Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; That's what people got confused about.
[1:23:06] So, well, I know that's God. That's
[1:23:08] correct. And I know that this is man.
[1:23:11] That's correct.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; He did that to unite you
[1:23:17] to that very God who's the bridegroom,
[1:23:20] who is the son of man, who's Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:26] He did that so they could clearly
[1:23:32] uh not merely emphasize but clearly set
[1:23:35] out the pattern the program that that is
[1:23:38] what he's designed for you.
[1:23:42] It's God not just anointing people now
[1:23:46] but God want to dwell in the individual.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; All right. to unite the two together.
[1:23:53] The church has to be the word and he is
[1:23:56] the word and the two unites together.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; He said it'll take the manifestation
[1:24:03] of the revealing of the son of man. Not
[1:24:06] a clergyman,
[1:24:08] not a clergyman. Regardless of how well
[1:24:11] a minister might speak, that won't do
[1:24:13] it.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; This isn't some cunning thing.
[1:24:20] He said, "See, it's the son of man,
[1:24:22] Jesus Christ, will come down in human
[1:24:25] flesh among us."
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; And will make his word so real
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; that it will unite. What will you what
[1:24:34] will make it unite? The word that
[1:24:36] becomes so real.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; It will unite the church and him in one,
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; the bride. And then she'll go home to
[1:24:44] the wedding supper. Then she'll go home
[1:24:47] to the wedding supper.
[1:24:49] This is the evening supper we're having.
[1:24:51] But we're going to a wedding supper, he
[1:24:53] said. And she's already united.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; We go to the wedding supper. Not to the
[1:24:59] marriage,
[1:25:00] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:25:03] supper.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; All right. I want to move along quickly.
[1:25:10] I want to move on to the the excuse. And
[1:25:13] this has been really what the message is
[1:25:16] about.
[1:25:19] An excuse
[1:25:22] is something that
[1:25:25] is intended to declare one free from
[1:25:28] blame.
[1:25:30] That's what an excuse is. Or try to
[1:25:32] remove the blame. Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Something a statement or it's a position
[1:25:40] that is taken to give just reason for
[1:25:44] making a certain decision.
[1:25:48] An excuse is to release one from from
[1:25:52] responsibility
[1:25:54] or to release one from service or
[1:25:57] obligation.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; They don't want to become obligated.
[1:26:00] They want to become engaged in the in
[1:26:03] this responsibility of this service.
[1:26:06] Now I want to be very careful here.
[1:26:09] There are times in life
[1:26:13] when circumstances justify us to make a
[1:26:17] certain decision.
[1:26:21] They do justify us. We need to make a
[1:26:24] certain decision.
[1:26:26] And uh
[1:26:29] and so we have we we take action based
[1:26:32] on a certain scenario of circumstances
[1:26:35] and we do that in life.
[1:26:38] But that's not what I'm speaking of and
[1:26:39] that's not what I'm dealing with. I want
[1:26:41] to deal with another aspect and that is
[1:26:43] the aspect that Jesus spoke of here.
[1:26:46] The excuses here that are recorded
[1:26:49] have to do only with the great supper.
[1:26:54] Now I've laid I've made and and I've
[1:26:58] labored for the first part of the
[1:26:59] service on the supper, the greatness of
[1:27:02] the supper and what is in the bosom of
[1:27:05] God
[1:27:07] and then to prepare a messenger to give
[1:27:09] the invitation and to extend it to a
[1:27:12] generation.
[1:27:15] Some heard it and saw it visibly and
[1:27:17] others you've only heard it by
[1:27:20] eyewitnesses such as you as a
[1:27:22] congregation have.
[1:27:25] But then then we have responded to this
[1:27:28] invitation.
[1:27:30] But in life
[1:27:32] now in this particular scripture it is
[1:27:35] largely to do they they they didn't they
[1:27:38] had reason not to accept the invitation
[1:27:43] to the supper.
[1:27:45] But there's something that is more
[1:27:46] subtle and something that is more of a
[1:27:49] concern to me. And that is that those
[1:27:52] that have
[1:27:54] accepted the word, they've accepted
[1:27:57] Christ, they started on their journey,
[1:28:01] but as time goes on,
[1:28:03] there are changes in their
[1:28:07] life. There are changes because time and
[1:28:10] life itself bring changes to us. And as
[1:28:14] we move along,
[1:28:16] I see, and here's the crux of my
[1:28:19] message. I'm going to just bring it
[1:28:20] forward and then hopefully fill in some
[1:28:22] of the spaces. I see, and I have a quote
[1:28:25] here where brother Brandham says that
[1:28:28] Satan, he just stands and he waits. The
[1:28:32] David in the Psalms said how his enemy
[1:28:36] laid in weight for him.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Laid in weight. And I I I see how Satan,
[1:28:43] he he will lay a long he's patient. A
[1:28:47] serpent will wait a long time for his
[1:28:49] prey. He'll just lay he'll uh he'll hide
[1:28:54] himself. He'll conceal himself right by
[1:28:57] the pathway where a person goes every
[1:29:00] day. Every day goes to their food, goes
[1:29:03] to do their duties and so on. He'll wait
[1:29:05] there for the right opportune time to
[1:29:08] make his strike. And I have seen how
[1:29:12] that Satan knows well
[1:29:15] perhaps they h how our circumstances
[1:29:19] change. Maybe when you were young and
[1:29:23] fervent and uninvolved and some of our
[1:29:26] young people here, you you're not
[1:29:28] encumbered. You're not lassued down.
[1:29:33] you you don't have responsibilities of
[1:29:35] marriage and of children and of of debts
[1:29:38] and and all of these things. You if you
[1:29:41] have a credit card, it's not yours.
[1:29:43] Perhaps it's your parents. You don't
[1:29:45] have those kind of responsibilities.
[1:29:47] You're not you're not concerned about
[1:29:49] how to put food on the table tomorrow or
[1:29:51] how to pay the rent next month. You just
[1:29:53] go home. That's mom and dad's
[1:29:55] responsibility. You're you're free of
[1:29:58] those kind of responsibilities. But as
[1:30:00] time goes on, life changes things. And
[1:30:03] then you assume more responsibilities
[1:30:06] and you go through the glitz and the
[1:30:09] glamour of of a courtship and perhaps a
[1:30:11] marriage
[1:30:13] and then you have some responsibilities
[1:30:16] and people maybe handle that very very
[1:30:18] well. Then children come into the world
[1:30:21] are born into the family and and perhaps
[1:30:24] that even isn't too upsetting but you
[1:30:26] know it's a happy time and you got the
[1:30:29] children around you and all the rest of
[1:30:30] then the children start getting up into
[1:30:32] their teens and maybe become young men
[1:30:34] and young women and it's it's not really
[1:30:38] realistic to believe that there isn't
[1:30:40] some disappointments along the way.
[1:30:42] There are some scary moments when you
[1:30:44] see that young person and being pulled
[1:30:47] perhaps by the world, being pulled by
[1:30:50] some friends and oh, you're so desirous
[1:30:53] that that that God will intervene
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; and but but as time goes on and you may
[1:30:59] see you may have a reversal in in your
[1:31:02] health. You're strong, you're robust,
[1:31:04] your strength is is is with you. Maybe
[1:31:08] your beauty is with you as a young
[1:31:11] individual, but as time goes on, life
[1:31:14] takes its toll and perhaps you engage in
[1:31:17] things that begin to uh uh really start
[1:31:21] to destroy all that beauty of youth.
[1:31:24] There's a lot of people that haven't
[1:31:25] even reached 25 and they're already old
[1:31:29] men and old women and their drugs and
[1:31:32] their lifestyle and everything else has
[1:31:34] taken a terrible toll on them. And Satan
[1:31:37] is full of glee that he's been able to
[1:31:39] deceive them and send them down such a
[1:31:42] terrible trail.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; But as time goes on, Satan is laying
[1:31:47] weight and and something that seems so
[1:31:50] simple at the beginning
[1:31:53] finally formulates
[1:31:55] into an excuse.
[1:31:58] Oh, well, because this happened or
[1:32:01] because I had this disappointment or
[1:32:03] because of the wife that I married or
[1:32:06] because of the husband that I married or
[1:32:08] because of he's doing this or she's
[1:32:10] doing that or they're not doing this or
[1:32:12] they're not doing that. And for this
[1:32:14] reason, I I I'm just disappointed in my
[1:32:17] experience with God. I'm I'm
[1:32:19] disappointed in the message. And it may
[1:32:21] even be undeclared, but but we we we
[1:32:24] declare it in our actions and we slack
[1:32:26] off and we slack back and the ferveny
[1:32:29] dissipates and we're not the same as we
[1:32:32] used to be. And we have an excuse.
[1:32:35] Because of this, I can't be the kind of
[1:32:37] believer I used to be. Because of this,
[1:32:40] I can't be as faithful as I used to be.
[1:32:42] Because of this, the fire doesn't burn
[1:32:44] like it used to burn. I say it's a weak,
[1:32:47] frail excuse. Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; And it won't work.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; And Satan laid in weight to prepare that
[1:32:58] excuse for you so that you could so that
[1:33:02] he could deprive you of the fullness of
[1:33:05] the supper.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to receive the full
[1:33:09] strength of the supper. If you eat this
[1:33:12] whole body word of the Son of Man,
[1:33:15] you're going to do destruction for him.
[1:33:18] Hallelujah.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; God is interested in men and women
[1:33:22] that'll be full of fire, full of
[1:33:24] ferveny, full of zeal, full of desire,
[1:33:28] that will not be deterred, that can't be
[1:33:31] watered down, that cannot be uh uh made
[1:33:35] lax and laxidasical anymore.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; You think I'm preaching this because I
[1:33:40] want to. I'm preaching it because it's
[1:33:42] truth because of what I've seen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; It's Satan. wants to rob you.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; I say there are churches that Satan has
[1:33:53] robbed them. They only have one service
[1:33:55] a week. I think it's a shame.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; We ought to be at the door at least
[1:33:59] three times a week. Ready for the house
[1:34:02] of God, ready to sing, ready to have
[1:34:06] input and say, "I'm important in this
[1:34:09] place. I'm a member of the body of
[1:34:12] Christ
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and I cannot let this standard down. How
[1:34:18] Satan will pound on it. How he will try
[1:34:20] to persuade, how he'll try to penetrate
[1:34:23] the mind and reason it this way and
[1:34:25] that. Oh, because this happened, that
[1:34:27] happened, the other thing happened that
[1:34:29] we have to uh uh uh mullify or or dilute
[1:34:34] the message which we hold.
[1:34:39] We can't do it.
[1:34:43] We can't do it.
[1:34:46] They all with one consent began to make
[1:34:48] excuse.
[1:34:50] I bought a piece of ground.
[1:34:53] I bought five yolk of oxen.
[1:34:56] I've married a wife. What do you think I
[1:34:59] should do as a minister? I'm asking you,
[1:35:00] what do you think I should do as a
[1:35:02] minister? I I've seen young men, young
[1:35:05] women come in and they sit in the front
[1:35:08] seat like you fellas here. Don't you
[1:35:11] change, Michael. I'm putting you on
[1:35:13] notice here. Now,
[1:35:16] you'll remember this message is the one
[1:35:17] we announced. Oh, they're just they're
[1:35:20] all fervent for God. Then they get
[1:35:23] married.
[1:35:25] They get married. They go back in the
[1:35:29] congregation.
[1:35:31] Then they have babies, so they sit way
[1:35:32] at the back so they can slip out. I
[1:35:34] understand all of that.
[1:35:38] And then they're not there on Wednesday.
[1:35:41] Do I need you in church? No, I don't
[1:35:43] need you in church, but you need to.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Then they're not there Wednesday.
[1:35:50] They're Sunday morning and Sunday night.
[1:35:52] And then they're not there Sunday night.
[1:35:57] And then well the situation I got a
[1:36:00] family
[1:36:02] and it's important I get out and you
[1:36:04] know have a little time off. So we have
[1:36:07] a Sunday and we kind of went out for a
[1:36:09] little picnic and so picnic all you want
[1:36:11] but not when God's people are gathered
[1:36:13] in their house.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; You'll be glad when this service is
[1:36:21] over.
[1:36:26] Shall I preach it?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; And some they married a wife
[1:36:36] and then they they they they're history.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; They're gone.
[1:36:42] I even asked one brother. I said,
[1:36:45] "Before you were married,
[1:36:47] you were sitting on the front row every
[1:36:51] service."
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you got married and I
[1:36:54] don't even see you anymore. Not you, not
[1:36:58] your wife, not your kids. What happened?
[1:37:00] How am I supposed to say it was a good
[1:37:02] thing?
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Was it a good thing?
[1:37:08] Well, then she could say, "Well, he
[1:37:10] didn't take the headship." You know,
[1:37:12] both of them need to take full
[1:37:14] responsibility and just stop making
[1:37:17] excuses.
[1:37:21] I'm tired of excuses. God's tired of
[1:37:23] excuses. And in fact is he speaks of in
[1:37:26] the scripture where they will be without
[1:37:28] excuse.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; You know, we've all engaged in excuses.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; We've all engaged in them.
[1:37:37] You know, you've had the telephone call
[1:37:41] and then over the mouthpiece goes, you
[1:37:43] know, they they want us over tonight.
[1:37:46] They want us for supper. They, you know,
[1:37:47] they want something.
[1:37:56] You have to go someplace right away.
[1:37:58] Just tell them I'm just leaving now.
[1:38:01] Brother Brandon did it.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; A phone call came and he stepped out the
[1:38:06] back door.
[1:38:09] Tell him I'm not in.
[1:38:14] had to repent over that
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; because he wasn't in but yet he was him.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; We engage in that. This is an age when
[1:38:23] excuses a part of our life.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; We just make them all the time. They're
[1:38:29] second nature to us.
[1:38:32] I'm preaching this morning so that you
[1:38:34] will take a real caution. It doesn't
[1:38:37] work in the kingdom of God.
[1:38:40] It might work in life, but it won't work
[1:38:43] in the kingdom of God. It doesn't work.
[1:38:46] I am the way I am. I am I'm at my
[1:38:50] spiritual level because of him or
[1:38:53] because of her or because of this deacon
[1:38:57] or because somebody tells I'm not there
[1:39:00] anymore because I saw that sister. She
[1:39:02] doesn't dress just right. Well, you
[1:39:04] ought to come and dress right and be a
[1:39:05] testimony.
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:09] That person doesn't just sing right.
[1:39:11] Well, you sing right.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; You give the testimony.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Someone they're not just, you know,
[1:39:19] they're not up where they ought to be.
[1:39:21] Well, you come and be higher and pull
[1:39:23] them up.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Be stronger.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. One, one excuse won't work.
[1:39:39] I've heard all kinds of excuses. I've
[1:39:41] heard the whole gamut. I I I didn't even
[1:39:43] write them down because,
[1:39:46] you know, uh
[1:39:50] it's too broad.
[1:39:53] Paul said in Romans,
[1:39:57] he said, "Because that which may be
[1:40:02] known of God is manifest in them.
[1:40:07] For God has showed it unto them.
[1:40:10] For the invisible things of him from the
[1:40:12] creation of the world are clearly seen,
[1:40:15] being understood by the things that are
[1:40:17] made, even his eternal power and
[1:40:20] godhead, so that they are without
[1:40:22] excuse. It must be a terrible thing to
[1:40:24] be without excuse. Don't know if you
[1:40:27] remember, brother Dan Dasley stood here
[1:40:28] once. He told me little account. He said
[1:40:31] the pastor
[1:40:33] uh ran into a brother that he missed in
[1:40:35] church
[1:40:37] on the street. So he said, "Uh, you
[1:40:41] weren't in church on Sunday." He said,
[1:40:43] 'Yeah, I ran out of peanut butter.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; He says, "What's peanut butter got to do
[1:40:49] with going to church?" He says,
[1:40:50] "Nothing." But he said, "It's as good as
[1:40:52] any other excuse."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; I ran out of peanut butter. I never
[1:40:58] forgot that. Some of the excuses are
[1:41:00] just that weak.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You might as well use that as as Annie.
[1:41:07] Here's
[1:41:08] something
[1:41:15] in the message all things in Shreport
[1:41:18] 62.
[1:41:21] Brother Brandham says, "Oh, you say I
[1:41:24] went down there and there's a lot of
[1:41:26] power, brother. The whole floor was
[1:41:29] dancing in the spirit and not enough
[1:41:32] faith to heal a toothache.
[1:41:34] You You call that power? That's not
[1:41:37] power. That's blessings.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And see, there's a big difference
[1:41:40] between blessings and power
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; and blessings and his presence. He said
[1:41:45] there's a lot of difference between
[1:41:47] blessings and power.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; God makes his blessings makes his
[1:41:53] blessings upon the righteous and the
[1:41:55] unrighteous. Why did I say that? because
[1:41:58] as time has gone on, maybe a family and
[1:42:01] and uh I'd like to show you some of the
[1:42:04] places that I've lived and the
[1:42:08] simplicity of it
[1:42:10] uh and what you're able to
[1:42:15] manage to live with and live without.
[1:42:17] But as time goes on, you know, and and
[1:42:21] then you accumulate. As time goes on,
[1:42:23] families, I'm talking about excuses,
[1:42:25] they accumulate things. Maybe accumulate
[1:42:29] burdens.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not even talking about material
[1:42:31] things. accumulate burdens, accumulate
[1:42:35] disappointments,
[1:42:37] accumulate upheavalss
[1:42:40] in relationships
[1:42:42] and you you gather a lot of baggage
[1:42:46] and they start to have an effect.
[1:42:49] they start to have an effect and then a
[1:42:52] person doesn't have the same focus,
[1:42:56] doesn't have the same
[1:42:59] desire.
[1:43:01] Maybe deep down has a desire but doesn't
[1:43:03] seem to manifest. Do you know what? We
[1:43:06] all have those things. We all have
[1:43:09] reversals. Some are known, some are
[1:43:11] seen, some are not seen. We all have
[1:43:13] those things of one kind or another. In
[1:43:16] other words, let me say this. Every
[1:43:18] person here would have a a a an excuse
[1:43:22] for not obtaining the full measure of
[1:43:27] the supper.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Everybody has an excuse.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; If we want to focus on that excuse,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; people talk to me about their troubles.
[1:43:37] If they knew the troubles that I have
[1:43:39] borne
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; and I I it is it it is absolutely
[1:43:49] you know without substance
[1:43:52] it's without substance
[1:43:55] and there is I will say there is no
[1:43:57] excuse that God will accept
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; for us
[1:44:03] to
[1:44:06] to uh to fail
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; to reach out to obtain the full if God's
[1:44:13] holding it out for us
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; and for what some reason we have some
[1:44:19] justifiable reason for not receiving
[1:44:23] that that means that all of preparation
[1:44:26] everything that God has done he's he's
[1:44:29] being rebuffed
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; he's being rebuffed he's being set aside
[1:44:34] the invitation set aside, the provision
[1:44:37] is set aside. You follow me?
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:44:44] sometimes there are things I' I've spoke
[1:44:47] about reversals, but let's just talk
[1:44:49] about blessings now. And brother
[1:44:52] Brandham talks about uh the blessings
[1:44:56] and God makes blessings fall upon the
[1:44:59] righteous and the unrighteous. That's
[1:45:01] why Jesus said, I believe that's why he
[1:45:04] said it to Peter at the last chapter, I
[1:45:06] believe, of of John's gospel. When they
[1:45:09] caught all this multitude of fish, it
[1:45:12] was right after he was completely dis
[1:45:16] disappointed and discouraged with what
[1:45:18] was happening in the message of that
[1:45:20] hour.
[1:45:22] And Jesus allows them to prosper by
[1:45:25] catching the biggest amount of fish they
[1:45:27] ever caught. And then he says these
[1:45:29] words, "Lovest thou me more than these?"
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; He's a fisherman.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; He knows what this net is worth.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; 153 great fish. This is This is like
[1:45:41] having a finding the mother load.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Do you love me more than this
[1:45:46] prosperity? You know that I love you
[1:45:49] more. He asked him three times. Then
[1:45:52] feed my sheep. Feed my lambs. Feed my
[1:45:54] sheep.
[1:45:56] He wanted to keep them focused.
[1:46:01] I have a quote that I I want to and I
[1:46:04] have a scripture I want to read.
[1:46:10] Satan will use
[1:46:12] and these are as I felt directed. Satan
[1:46:14] will use every tactic and every device
[1:46:18] or circumstance be it good or bad to
[1:46:22] impede
[1:46:23] the individual's life or to turn the
[1:46:27] individual aside
[1:46:30] those I want you to get this now
[1:46:34] if there is a remote possibility
[1:46:37] whole congregation listen if there's
[1:46:40] something within the individual
[1:46:44] that will be appealed to or can possibly
[1:46:47] be appealed to.
[1:46:50] Satan will wait his opportunity
[1:46:54] until that moment has arrived.
[1:46:57] If it's possible for business to take
[1:46:59] you, if it's possible for pleasure to
[1:47:01] take you, if it's possible for the lust
[1:47:03] of the flesh to take a person, if it's
[1:47:05] possible for discouragement, if it's
[1:47:08] possible for uh a sickness or disease to
[1:47:10] take a person, if it's possible for any
[1:47:13] of this realm that is within his scope,
[1:47:15] within his domain, he will wait his
[1:47:18] opportunity till things have formulated,
[1:47:21] until things have come to that state and
[1:47:23] so that he can make his strike.
[1:47:27] You understand? Are you following me?
[1:47:28] Good. If it happens to be there, he will
[1:47:32] wait until the circumstances are such so
[1:47:35] that he can make his strike, make his
[1:47:38] pitch, and give you a a substantial
[1:47:41] justifiable excuse for not really
[1:47:45] obtaining the fullness of this supper.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Something will happen. Something will
[1:47:53] come along. I've I've seen it. I've
[1:47:55] experienced it. Had lots of reasons
[1:48:00] at different times
[1:48:02] in my life
[1:48:05] to say, "Well,
[1:48:09] I guess I'll
[1:48:13] take the easy route.
[1:48:16] Go the easy road."
[1:48:23] But on the other hand, if that is not
[1:48:26] present within the individual that there
[1:48:29] is nothing
[1:48:33] like they say in the world and I hope
[1:48:35] you don't misunderstand me. Come hell or
[1:48:37] high water,
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; nothing can deter me. Come disease, come
[1:48:43] sickness, come whatever it might be.
[1:48:46] Come discouragement, come loss of
[1:48:48] friends, come loss of family, come loss
[1:48:51] of whatever, by life or by death,
[1:48:54] whatever happens, nothing can change the
[1:48:57] course that I'm on.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; And if that is the resolve within the
[1:49:02] individual, then nothing that the enemy
[1:49:05] can bring your way can have an effect.
[1:49:09] And I want to say today as one believer,
[1:49:12] I'm beyond I by I say by faith, I'm
[1:49:16] beyond that point.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; And you want to make that confession,
[1:49:19] I'm beyond that point.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, my brother, my sister, the
[1:49:23] kingdom, we're going to step across it
[1:49:24] very, very soon. We don't know how soon,
[1:49:27] but you're going to never regret. You
[1:49:29] heard this message.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You're going to never regret that you
[1:49:33] settled it then. There's not a there's
[1:49:36] not a thing. There's not a circumstance.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can happen
[1:49:42] that can change my mind or turn me
[1:49:45] around or soften my resolve. I am
[1:49:49] resolved.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can change it.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; I will not be silent. I will keep my
[1:49:56] testimony. I will hold my integrity
[1:49:59] before God. And oh, we'll say, we'll say
[1:50:02] with Job of old, though he slay me, yet
[1:50:05] I'll trust him.
[1:50:07] Hallelujah.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, I lost my family. Yes, I lost my
[1:50:12] possessions. Yes, I lost my friends. And
[1:50:15] now they've turned against me. And these
[1:50:17] comforters are miserable comforters. You
[1:50:19] all,
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; have you had some miserable comforters?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I've had them.
[1:50:29] You'll have them.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; If you haven't had them already, you'll
[1:50:32] have them. If you had family, friends,
[1:50:35] dear ones, David said, "If it had been
[1:50:38] his enemy that lifted up his heel, but
[1:50:40] it was them of his own household,
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; have his own household lift up their
[1:50:45] heel against them." Your own family,
[1:50:49] your loved ones, maybe a husband or a
[1:50:52] wife or whatever it is, but nothing must
[1:50:55] water down the resolve within the
[1:50:58] individual. And I'm telling you that
[1:51:00] because Satan will be rendered helpless
[1:51:03] this morning.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; If you're here just on some wave, some
[1:51:11] emotional wave, that will certainly
[1:51:13] crash and and come to an end sometime.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; But when you have that resolve from the
[1:51:19] almighty God, I know in whom I have
[1:51:22] believeth.
[1:51:24] Hallelujah. And he is able to do all
[1:51:27] that he has promised to do.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Scripture says he found them in a
[1:51:40] desert. God's describing his people.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; He's describing his people that he sent
[1:51:47] a prepared messenger Moses to. And he
[1:51:51] ground Moses out for 40 years to make
[1:51:54] him a vessel that would be ready to come
[1:51:56] to his people with the right kind of
[1:51:58] word and come before Pharaoh and say
[1:52:01] whatever he need to say. Let my people
[1:52:04] go
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; and tell his people tell the children
[1:52:07] the Hebrew people who this God was. And
[1:52:10] he spoke to me in a pillar of fire in a
[1:52:12] burning bush.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And he gave them this message.
[1:52:17] He found him. He found you, Israel.
[1:52:20] He found him. He found us in a desert
[1:52:24] land.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Do you remember where you were when he
[1:52:26] found you?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; In some desolate, dark, dismal place
[1:52:33] in a in a waste, howling wilderness.
[1:52:37] What about that church, that
[1:52:38] denomination that you were in
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; or when you were maybe even born into a
[1:52:43] Christian family, but without God in a
[1:52:45] waste howling wilderness?
[1:52:51] And he led him about. He instructed him.
[1:52:55] He kept him as the apple of his eye.
[1:52:57] Think about it. Found you in a waste
[1:52:59] wilderness. But he kept his eye upon
[1:53:01] you. Kept you as the apple of his eye.
[1:53:03] Wouldn't let you outside of his sight.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Are you thankful? Amen.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You're out there wandering around in
[1:53:16] some dismal, dark, confused place and
[1:53:19] your father who's given going to give
[1:53:20] you an invitation wouldn't let you out
[1:53:22] of his eyesight. He kept you like the
[1:53:24] apple of his eye.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; As that eagle stirth her nest, flutterth
[1:53:33] over her young, spreadth forth her
[1:53:36] wings, taketh them, and beareth them up
[1:53:38] on wings.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord alone did lead him
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; and there was no strange God with him
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and he made him to ride on high places.
[1:53:51] Oh, he just experienced that glory of
[1:53:54] that new birth and that and he and he
[1:53:57] discovered who he was and he's riding on
[1:54:00] mama's eagle wings. You remember when
[1:54:02] you first came in didn't seem like there
[1:54:04] was anything that could bother you?
[1:54:07] People could slander you and you just
[1:54:09] smile. Oh, you go on down the road and
[1:54:11] maybe they don't even just look at a
[1:54:13] person, right? And suddenly, you know,
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; could sour a person up. That's because
[1:54:21] we got old and fidgety.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; But when we were young, it didn't bother
[1:54:27] us. Didn't bother us at all. We didn't
[1:54:30] have We just had pure thoughts about one
[1:54:32] another. Oh, you couldn't offend them
[1:54:34] for nothing. Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; And he rode on high places of the earth.
[1:54:40] And he might eat the increase of the
[1:54:42] fields. And oh how he fed. And he made
[1:54:44] him to suck honey out of the rock and
[1:54:47] oil out of the flinty rock. Oh, it was
[1:54:49] such a wonderful marvelous
[1:54:52] life.
[1:54:55] And we ate butter of kind and milk of
[1:54:58] sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the
[1:55:00] breed of Bashon and goats and of the fat
[1:55:04] of kidneys and of wheat. And thou did
[1:55:06] drink the pure blood of the grape.
[1:55:11] But Jester
[1:55:15] after time waxed.
[1:55:17] Jester is God's people. God's people.
[1:55:21] Not somebody out there. God's people.
[1:55:24] They waxed
[1:55:26] fat.
[1:55:30] When they wax fat, it's a strange
[1:55:33] strange adjective that comes right with
[1:55:35] it. And they kicked.
[1:55:38] It's too cold in the church. What's the
[1:55:41] matter with those custodians?
[1:55:44] I don't like the color. Look what they
[1:55:46] put up there. What's that for?
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:55:54] and they kicked.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I don't like the I don't like the voice
[1:55:59] of the messenger who invites. I can't
[1:56:01] can't even hear it. Can't understand it.
[1:56:08] And they kicked.
[1:56:11] It goes together. And then God speaks.
[1:56:15] You're waxing fat.
[1:56:18] You've grown thick.
[1:56:20] They are covered with fatness.
[1:56:23] Then comes another act of another action
[1:56:27] tragic. Then he forsook God. In other
[1:56:30] words, then he drew back and he lightly
[1:56:33] esteemed. He didn't speak evil, but he
[1:56:36] lightly esteemed the God of his
[1:56:37] salvation.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; We just don't need the same don't need
[1:56:41] the same ferveny. Don't need You say,
[1:56:45] "Are you speaking about coming to
[1:56:46] church?" No, I'm not. But I have noticed
[1:56:49] those that don't come,
[1:56:52] we could have had we could have had
[1:56:54] people say even when Paul was here,
[1:56:57] well, I don't have to go and hear him. I
[1:57:00] I I get I God can speak to me at home.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Have you heard that?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; God can speak to me at home.
[1:57:08] It doesn't say that thou I will speak to
[1:57:10] you at home. It says that the more so
[1:57:14] you gather yourself together as you see
[1:57:16] the day approaching. Some will say, "Oh,
[1:57:18] I see the day approaching. What are you
[1:57:20] doing at home then?"
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Am I too straight?
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; No, I'm here. Why are you here? Cuz I'm
[1:57:29] a I'm a part. I'm a finger. I'm a
[1:57:32] muscle. I'm a I'm a cord. I'm something.
[1:57:35] I'm something in the kingdom. How do you
[1:57:37] know? Well, I got a voice. I praise him
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; when I sing. My neighbor hears my voice
[1:57:43] because I'm singing with everything
[1:57:45] that's in me.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; And if somebody says you're off tune,
[1:57:51] just say, "Don't kick."
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; I'm doing my best.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; I'm making a loud noise. Hallelujah.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; But if you can be deterred by a by an
[1:58:06] excuse, I tell you, Satan will engineer
[1:58:09] one for you. He'll sure see that there's
[1:58:11] one. But if you're beyond that, I'm
[1:58:14] beyond offense.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm beyond being turned
[1:58:18] aside. I'm beyond being distracted. I'm
[1:58:22] headed for the kingdom of God.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've responded to the
[1:58:27] invitation and I'm eating this last
[1:58:29] supper meal.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go for this. You know, when
[1:58:34] you have a good meal, somehow it wears
[1:58:36] off real fast and you're ready for the
[1:58:38] next one. Well, I've been eating this
[1:58:40] for about 30ome years and I'm ready for
[1:58:43] the next one.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; The wedding supper. The wedding supper.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and how our prophet describes it.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; He says thousands of miles long.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; He says we'll sit across from one
[1:59:02] another
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; and tears of joy
[1:59:08] will roll down our faces.
[1:59:12] Oh friends,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; what will everything that you're
[1:59:16] enduring or going through now mean?
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; And the king will come in.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; He'll say these words, "It's over,
[1:59:33] children."
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to hear those words. It's
[1:59:37] over, children. It's over.
[1:59:40] and come start to dry our eyes.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; There isn't an excuse in the world.
[1:59:50] There isn't an excuse that the
[1:59:52] cunningness of Satan can devise that
[1:59:54] worth. If he wants to wait my entire
[1:59:56] lifetime to bring an excuse at the end,
[1:59:59] he might as well lay in the grass and
[2:00:02] rot because he cannot deter me.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; I'm making that as a statement before
[2:00:08] God.
[2:00:09] Regardless of what comes our way, there
[2:00:12] is no excuse
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; to keep me. There's nothing that can
[2:00:17] justify me missing God's best.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:00:30] There's going to be a meeting in the
[2:00:32] air.
[2:00:37] Perhaps I can pick up on this
[2:00:41] at another time.
[2:00:59] I had that
[2:01:01] place where brother Bry just referred to
[2:01:03] that song.
[2:01:11] you know, we're
[2:01:14] we're participating upon something that
[2:01:16] is
[2:01:18] rich. It's not everybody's food.
[2:01:21] And when I spoke to the
[2:01:25] our guide who we've already wrote back
[2:01:27] in Turkey,
[2:01:29] and I told him very quickly, this may
[2:01:31] not be for you.
[2:01:33] This may not be yours,
[2:01:35] but nevertheless,
[2:01:37] this is what God has done in this time.
[2:01:40] I'm going to send you this book so you
[2:01:41] can read it yourself. You're going to
[2:01:42] hear things that you never heard before
[2:01:45] when you read the church ages.
[2:01:49] I'm anxious to hear what kind of
[2:01:51] response comes back,
[2:01:53] but I'm glad I can announce to you as a
[2:01:55] congregation this morning.
[2:01:58] I believe that here's a body of people
[2:02:00] and and I desire with everything that's
[2:02:02] in me
[2:02:04] that were able to continue. And I
[2:02:07] believe that the smile of God's approval
[2:02:11] has been upon us.
[2:02:13] And I realize that Satan would try to do
[2:02:15] every and anything that he could to
[2:02:18] deter, to derail, to distract,
[2:02:22] and to keep you from everything that God
[2:02:25] has. But I'd like you to resolve this
[2:02:27] morning. Nothing, nothing can turn me
[2:02:31] aside. I'm resolved. I'm resolved to
[2:02:35] enter the kingdom. I'm resolved to be
[2:02:38] faithful to the very end. I'm resolved
[2:02:41] at all cost regardless. Amen. And if you
[2:02:44] have been harboring, if you have been
[2:02:47] using an excuse, well, it's because my
[2:02:50] husband is what he is, or my wife is
[2:02:52] what she is, or because the church is
[2:02:55] what it is, or hey, those things may be
[2:02:58] true. Like the man says, I bought a
[2:03:00] piece of ground. That wasn't a lie. He
[2:03:02] did.
[2:03:03] The other one said, I bought five yolk
[2:03:05] of oxen. That wasn't a lie. He did. An
[2:03:08] excuse wasn't just a fabrication. It was
[2:03:10] it was something that was reality. The
[2:03:13] other one said, "I married a wife." And
[2:03:14] he did.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; It was a reality,
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't justifiable.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; And you know, I don't want to end this
[2:03:24] on a down note,
[2:03:26] but when a person's when a person is
[2:03:29] inclined, and I've heard it amongst
[2:03:30] believers, that's why I'm preaching
[2:03:31] this.
[2:03:34] I felt it was very necessary.
[2:03:37] There's people who perhaps within the
[2:03:40] sound of my voice
[2:03:42] that have had such disappointments
[2:03:45] in life.
[2:03:47] Well, because of that I'm I am where I'm
[2:03:50] at. Because of that, I'm going this
[2:03:54] direction. Because of that, I'm I'm I'm
[2:03:57] laxing off. It won't work, friends. And
[2:04:00] let me let me remind you the Bible
[2:04:03] doesn't say and then the man the father
[2:04:08] doesn't say he was disappointed
[2:04:12] says he was angry
[2:04:16] after all this preparation
[2:04:18] after all this sending of a messenger
[2:04:22] after all that he'd prepared. And here's
[2:04:25] a people been invited by the grace of
[2:04:27] God by his longsuffering and invited and
[2:04:31] and drawn in and wooed over and and and
[2:04:35] uh uh the the wings of the dove
[2:04:37] fluttering over you and bringing you to
[2:04:39] himself and then and then somehow
[2:04:42] Satan's able to devise some little puny
[2:04:46] weak thing that begins to distract us in
[2:04:50] terms of well I don't feel you know I
[2:04:52] got a reason to be this way. I I got a
[2:04:54] reason to feel the way I do and and
[2:04:57] yeah, let a root of bitterness. Let a
[2:04:58] root of hardness come in. Fail in the
[2:05:01] house of God. Fail our brothers and
[2:05:02] sisters. And don't don't reach out and
[2:05:04] don't get what we're supposed to get.
[2:05:06] God God saved you for a purpose. God
[2:05:09] brought you in for a purpose. And I
[2:05:11] don't care whether it's hardship one way
[2:05:13] or whether it's prosperity the other
[2:05:15] way. Both are very dangerous. I would
[2:05:17] say prosperity is more dangerous than
[2:05:19] the other. And then Jesin waxed fat.
[2:05:22] Didn't say he waxed poor. He waxed fat
[2:05:24] and when he waxed fat that's when he
[2:05:26] kicked and he you know became you know
[2:05:28] it was just strange things that happened
[2:05:30] to us that way and so I say let's get
[2:05:33] our eyes off of all of those things get
[2:05:35] our eyes off of everyone else
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; and get our eyes on the kingdom alone
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah don't lax off people
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ let's have
[2:05:50] that ferveny say what you used to be we
[2:05:53] ought to be more than that now.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; We're further down the road.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:06:03] All right. Do we have Oh, great. They're
[2:06:05] all here.
[2:06:08] It's going to be meeting in the air.
[2:06:19] [Music]
[2:06:21] There's going to be a me
[2:06:26] in the sweet
[2:06:29] and I

[2:06:42] sing
[2:06:48] [Music]
[2:06:57] and
[2:07:01] rise.
[2:07:02] You've heard of little Moses in the bull
[2:07:06] rock.
[2:07:08] You've heard a fearless day and a slave.
[2:07:13] You've heard of
[2:07:16] Joseph
[2:07:18] and of Jonah and the whale beyond the
[2:07:21] same.
[2:07:23] There are many many others in the Bible.
[2:07:28] I should like to meet them all. I do
[2:07:31] declare.
[2:07:33] I the Lord will surely let us meet them.
[2:07:38] And that being in the air.
[2:07:43] Oh, there
[2:07:45] we are in the air in the sea.
[2:07:50] by and by
[2:07:54] going to the angel over there and home
[2:08:00] beyond the sky.
[2:08:03] Such singer
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:06] heard by mortal air glorious
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:19] [Applause]
[2:08:20] [Music]
[2:08:24] many things will
[2:08:27] be reading
[2:08:29] for the morning will have no place at
[2:08:34] There will never be a sermon preached to
[2:08:37] sinners
[2:08:39] for the sinner has refused to hear the
[2:08:42] calling.
[2:08:43] [Applause]
[2:08:48] Loved ones,
[2:08:49] there will be no lonely nights of
[2:08:52] pleading prayer.
[2:08:55] All our words and our anger will be
[2:08:58] lifted
[2:09:00] at that meeting in the air.

[2:09:46] there. The doubters will be missing all
[2:09:49] together.
[2:09:51] All the skeptics will be absent on that
[2:09:54] day.
[2:09:56] There will be no grumpers present to
[2:09:59] destroy. Hallelujah.
[2:10:02] [Music]

[2:10:06] there the saints will have the seal upon
[2:10:09] their forehead. Hallelujah.

[2:10:16] [Applause]
[2:10:17] All who have the wedding garment will be
[2:10:20] present
[2:10:22] at that meeting in the air.
[2:10:27] Oh, there's point to me. I'm fading in
[2:10:31] the air. Sweet, sweet
[2:10:35] and fire.
[2:10:37] I fall
[2:10:41] over there and
[2:10:44] be
[2:10:45] [Applause]
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:53] [Applause]
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:11:00] will be the leading one that's pleasing
[2:11:05] in the air.
[2:11:09] Hallelujah.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; All our labors and all of our prayers
[2:11:13] and all of our preaching,
[2:11:16] everything that you
[2:11:20] have witnessed and been a witness to.
[2:11:22] Let me tell you, before God, it'll be
[2:11:25] worth every bit of it.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:30] We're going to have prayer
[2:11:32] and there I want everyone to join in
[2:11:34] prayer with me.
[2:11:36] whenever I
[2:11:38] feel and know that God has directed me
[2:11:41] in a certain way to a certain message.
[2:11:46] And I'd like to tell you, I didn't tell
[2:11:48] you earlier, but I tried to avoid this
[2:11:50] message this morning. I I had another
[2:11:52] subject I wanted to preach on. So all
[2:11:54] week while I was away, I thought I I
[2:11:58] would like to come to a different
[2:11:59] subject for this morning. But God knew
[2:12:03] who was going to be here, who maybe was
[2:12:05] going to be an internet congregation.
[2:12:07] And I know that it is for some perhaps
[2:12:11] several individuals. I haven't got
[2:12:13] anybody really in my mind, but I know
[2:12:16] that we are all can be afflicted this
[2:12:18] way. And Satan can
[2:12:21] I I I preach this morning to diffuse
[2:12:25] him.
[2:12:27] I preach this morning to slay his
[2:12:30] efforts and to bring them to not in the
[2:12:34] presence of the almighty God. And if
[2:12:37] you're here this today, you're here this
[2:12:40] morning and oh, how you have been so
[2:12:44] plagued
[2:12:45] with this uh very excuse, some excuse
[2:12:51] that Satan has given as a justifiable
[2:12:55] reason to miss out on the best things.
[2:12:59] Don't let him rob you any longer. And
[2:13:03] I'm going to pray. The people are going
[2:13:05] to pray and God is going to move on the
[2:13:08] scene. This supernatural God that will
[2:13:11] move beyond the province of my ability
[2:13:14] to speak. He will move and confirm the
[2:13:17] word with signs following. Do you
[2:13:19] believe that?
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Is this a believing congregation this
[2:13:22] morning? I know that you are.
[2:13:26] Don't be ashamed to raise your hand.
[2:13:29] Say, "It's me, oh Lord. It's me, not
[2:13:32] someone else. I've used that weak, frail
[2:13:36] thing and I'll not use it anymore.
[2:13:39] Almighty God,
[2:13:41] you are indeed the giver of every good
[2:13:43] gift.
[2:13:45] And this morning, Lord, we're aware once
[2:13:47] again you've sent your word. And when
[2:13:50] you were here, Lord Jesus, and the words
[2:13:52] came out of those marvelous lips, words
[2:13:56] that were so gracious,
[2:13:58] you said, and it is recorded, you sent
[2:14:01] your word and healed them.
[2:14:03] We have here, Lord, those who no doubt
[2:14:07] need a healing. They need a healing
[2:14:10] within their soul, within their spirit.
[2:14:15] Lord, the enemy has caused them to
[2:14:19] stumble or caused them to withdraw,
[2:14:23] to hold back, to relax or to become
[2:14:28] despondent and discouraged.
[2:14:31] I speak, Father, in the name of Jesus
[2:14:34] Christ, to these spirits of
[2:14:37] discouragement,
[2:14:39] to these spirits who have tried to find
[2:14:41] a justifiable reason to keep their foot
[2:14:45] in the door. We speak to you, Satan, in
[2:14:48] the name of Jesus Christ and call upon
[2:14:52] you to depart out of these lives.
[2:14:56] Leave God's property.
[2:14:59] Depart out of our realm. Depart out of
[2:15:03] this sanctuary which is a place of
[2:15:07] holiness and a place where God is lifted
[2:15:10] up. May these Lord sons and daughters of
[2:15:15] yours be set free in the name of Jesus
[2:15:19] Christ. And I pray that their vision
[2:15:21] will become clear and that they will
[2:15:24] become focused. They will see nothing
[2:15:26] but the prize which is before them. May
[2:15:30] they settle, oh God, and become resolved
[2:15:35] within themselves. And I pray you'll put
[2:15:37] your stamp of approval upon the resolve
[2:15:40] within their soul. May they march
[2:15:42] forward like a mighty army.
[2:15:46] Hallelujah.
[2:15:48] as a testimony to this wicked, vile,
[2:15:51] dark generation. In the name of Jesus
[2:15:54] Christ, I commit these words to you and
[2:15:56] I commit this group of people to you.
[2:15:58] The blessed of the Lord, the Exodus
[2:16:00] people, may they rejoice in the God of
[2:16:03] their salvation and the great things
[2:16:06] that you have spread out before us. We
[2:16:08] thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. We
[2:16:11] thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:16:15] Hallelujah.
[2:16:16] Oh, give him praise all ye people.
[2:16:20] Oh, for his blood has cleansed every
[2:16:22] stain.
[2:16:25] His arm is not short.
[2:16:28] His power is not depleted.
[2:16:31] Lean upon him now. Call upon him now
[2:16:36] and enjoy
[2:16:39] the great salvation and deliverance of
[2:16:42] our God.
[2:16:44] Hallelujah.
[2:16:46] Hallelujah.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Bless your name, Lord.

[2:17:08] I can tell you, I can assure you that
[2:17:11] there the enemy of our soul despises.
[2:17:15] He is wrenched when he hears the people
[2:17:18] of God. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:17:30] Onward Christian solders
[2:17:36] marching

[2:18:45] your face you're happy they were here

[2:18:50] time. God bless you. You're dismissed in

[2:19:50] "Come and join this happy band."
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; It's not a long-faced situation.
[2:19:58] Praise God.
