Had to have four hours of surgery and during this he tumor behind his knee now has to go to St. John for the test of surgery. at this time situation back window. How many need on the internet this morning? How many are in anticipation, &gt;&gt; expectation? It just has been just electrifying service after service. These are needs we could just join our our hearts together as one. We believe God can move in a very special and supernatural way this morning. So let's unite our hearts before the throne of grace. Heavenly Father, Lord, there is such a desire, Lord, within our hearts to come in that unity of the faith, one mind, one heart. Lord Jesus, one desire to see the moving of God. Lord, we've been under that baptism over night after night, and we have felt the breeze of the Holy Ghost, the moving of God, and our hearts are filled this morning with thanksgiving. Lord, you've done great things amongst us, and we want to open up our mouths this morning to give you glory, to give you praise. Lord, we thank you for the move of God. We've been praying for it, Lord. And you have come night after night. You've confirmed your word with signs following. And we say, Lord, confirm your word once again. Bless your people. They have gathered this resurrection morning. You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. And we're asking, God, that you will meet these needs. Brother Rod has spoken. Our hearts are raised. Our hands are raised. Lord, meet these needs. our dear brother Nelson's son. We pray that you will move on his behalf this morning as we heard our dear brother Ron last night at daddy come into the room. I am a son of God and I have rights as a son of God. Lord, you raise that man up. Raise this son up for your glory. Save the soul, Lord. Do what you must do with God at him into the body of Christ we pray. And Lord, for every uplifted hand and every spoken request, Brother Mike Cosalo's son, he's in trouble in Japan. Lord, you can move on magistrate's hearts. You can move on the police heart. We've seen it, Lord. We ask you one more time. And so, Father, we're committing these needs to you. Asking, Father, you'll anoint the man of God once again. Anoint us to pull. Anoint us to receive the promises of God. We thank you for this time. has been such a time of refreshing or we're thankful for your moving move again. We pray now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Well, here we are at a meeting that we don't really like to see coming. Kind of mixed feelings. We're happy to have the service this morning, but we don't like to see it be the last one to camp. Is that right? people almost fighting to come to camp and we appreciate that been hard. We had to say no to a lot of folks. So I'm going to just have you sing the course, brother. We'll give all the glory to Jesus and tell him to his wonderful glory for what he has been doing for you during this camp and what he yet will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know there's a whole lot here that I've asked him, including myself, for specific things. And now, although I don't sing it yet, I do give him glory. Amen. Glor to Jesus and tell his love. His wonderful love will give the glory to Jesus and tell his wonderful love. You may be seated. One of our new families uh brother Mike and sister Cindy not very long ago they found themselves in real real difficult place and uh I guess one day certain direction went and uh this is their letter of thanksgiving. God works on their behalf in a wonderful wonderful way. So we give all the glory to God. But they have said these words, we would like to give thanks to God and to all the body of Christ for helping make our recent trials a blessing. You gave us financial support and you cleaned and packed our home and moved and unpacked. You fixed what needed fixing and along with along the way you became more acquainted with us and us with you. You all were truly God's hands and feet. Thank you and God bless you even more than he blessed us. Mike and Cindy God bless them. That's a very lovely word of thanksgiving to show you. And furthermore, that's the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's the way it's supposed to work. &gt;&gt; Just beyond lip service. Well, this kind of camp these these times don't take place without a great deal of work and effort, planning, praying, ministering. from one camp is over the whole focus starts coming on the next time whether it be in winter and then from Friday to Friday we felt to have the young people and I I can see the effects of it I want to say to you young people and to the parents and the congregation Bible way and our extended congregation on the internet or wherever uh and to the body of Christ at large I have seen the effect. I think I'm a fairly perceptive person. I believe I have a Holy Spirit with the spirit of discernment. I have seen a distinct effect. I I saw uh as I looked down across the congregation last year, I saw a young man and young lady that I thought may be over the edge. I did not know whether they were recoverable or not. You might say, why is anything too hard for the Lord? No, nothing's too hard for the Lord. But I do know even as the prophet God says there is a line you can cross. He also has said and the scripture teaches us that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit. And and and I I saw young people, young men, young ladies have come up from their early teens now into into a different league. And I saw just that constant resisting of the Holy I just wondered I I was at that point with a number of them. I just wondered what was going to happen last year. Uh God sovereignly moved and a marvelous marvelous move and I saw that it's something that I believe was absolutely genuine. And of course it's time it needs to be time tested. And so you you just watch it then in the following months we come to have uh more gatherings of the young people and teach them the word. And brother John went to the adoption series, brother Tom was taking the line share the responsibility. And Friday after Friday and gathering after gathering and when they began to gather maybe 120, 130 and you always expect a tapering off, a cooling off and less coming. Maybe start with 120, 130, end with 100. It worked the reverse. In the fact is that it started about 120 and by the time by the time the year was out coming over 150 young people Friday after Friday to the meeting and that to me was a glorious sign because there was something really concrete happening in their lives just that steady teaching and that environment. And then when this camp started, the first night I looked down and I saw many that were actually in a critical state. I won't say many, but some critical state one year ago and now I can see that they were at a different level. The camp was actually starting at a different level, different spiritual level. And I believe that brother Ron Spencer, he speak for himself, but I believe that uh he would he told me last night of greatest anointing, if not the greatest anointing he's ever experienced in a service. And we have a thousand chairs and there are the kitchen staff and those that are outside I I thousand or more people that are here and it seemed like there was one mind, one spirit. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, I'm I'm absolutely determined to have spiritual victories &gt;&gt; and I expected it. I sing and it doesn't surprise me a bit and I want to tell you that you need to be sitting in your seat expecting spiritual victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Our God is a spiritual God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So with all the endeavor there's a number of groups we cannot name individuals because we would never get to it. But the ministry and the team that has worked uh Brother Thomas and directed the uh camp for now many years and uh the team that has worked with them and I I would like to have I know that we all those that are in the kitchen not here but I would like to have those that have been involved uh directly involved to stand as I mention these groups. So we have the ministry and their wives. I like them to stand. your wives and the team that worked with them so closely in planning. I know my sister and I know I'm sure they're back in the kitchen. I like all the counselors to stand. Is any of the kitchen staff here? Those that have worked directly in the kitchen. I'd like those that work under brother Tom and that are responsible for putting up the tent and taking it down. I'd like those that have been providing music and the song leaders to stand. They don't just come here and I said they'll start playing. So this starts sometimes weeks before so they can be in the right attitude and the right atmosphere. and all those in the sound and the video and the internet and the lighting if they stand. When you see one stand or two stand it means they do about six things. I can tell you there's about 60 people involved. more than 60 about 60 just putting the up and down because we have all the see brother Joe Wal you're sitting there brother Joe maybe I can get you to stand and all the all those assisted. Now we have everyone standing directly involved and all who gave all who made it possible the whole congregation. We're going to thank God for this audience of people and you're here in attendance and from my heart to your heart. Thank you for being who you are. Thank you for being a son and daughter of God. Thank you for coming today with your lick of fire. We have brother Neville who was pastor at at Round Tabernacle for many years. We have four of his grandchildren here in this meeting. Did you know that four brother Neville's grandchildren? I want them to raise their hand. So wait while I see right there. There they are. Those are brother Neville's grandchildren. You folks better line up out here cuz everybody's going to want to shake your hand. We love Brother Neville. &gt;&gt; He's a faithful servant of God beside the prophet of God. The brother said he preached the same message &gt;&gt; preaching. We're so happy to have them, brother Tim and Alice Brat's children here with us all the way from South Carolina. So, God bless you each one. Brother Tom, you may want to add something to this. And and before I step back, I want to say I thank God for brother Rob Spencer yielding himself to the Holy Spirit night after night. His wife Sister Connie with them and brother Bobby who have been their hosts and their chauffeers and caring for them just moment by moment. We're so thankful for people like that. And our brother Brian Jones and sister Jenny his good wife and stood by his side through the bush and open fires. And uh how many know that it takes a good woman to stand for brother Brian? Brother Brian wants to just say a word to before brother Tom. Brother Brian just like a word of thanksgiving would come up here. &gt;&gt; You want to do it hyena? gave me such a wonderful man to us for the atmosphere around was stunning. Just as good as sitting in the wild and eating the line just as good. comments here. I guess I go back 21 years when I was a year old man had a vision and we started counselors all counselors full all our young and seniors together started to close to 450 years and first couple years I was involved with the camp taking the morning devotions and the direction for the day of course involved with the evening services they help kick off our camps and I always said You know, everybody was a counselor at their cabin. I was a counselor to two men. You think that was a brother. Seeing our children by the way of God is the greatest thrill. to come to have fun. That's great. We always say we're children. We want you to have fun. I'm not here for you to have fun. I'm here that you would meet God. Create an atmosphere and the brothers and sisters that have joined with us over the years has been wonderful. Brother Jess and Sister Lyn decided moved up here from California wanting to do something for the Lord. And I'll never in my office. I just have aired to go assembly and God knowing that the assembly would grow. helps we can minister one to another. It has been a joy to know that we don't have to beg for you to come and help. It is a willingness within your heart to be a part of what God and it's always a great joy. I have to say imagine you can't come. We have too many willing to help us and I'm so thankful and those that you know have not come we parents can be around their children around it just makes family unit stronger it makes strong I'll never forget mentioned a couple times one year I was just I wanted him so bad to be a part of I don't know why but he just wanted I said brother Paul would you please be an assistant counsel that was a great event within my life. He said those boys I had in the cabin they were just boys before he says can you imagine one of them came up to me shook their hands and thought you're my counselor he says you know what that did for me that was wonderful and that's what we have seen and I say God bless those helpers that have come and stepped to the plate and see these young ones coming up. We're getting older. It's It's amazing. I never think I am, but I'm getting older. And then we have a need. And then we have brother John Andrews coming up. You see the body to the body. the young strength to the fabric of this world and I want to say to you young people joy the video the internet sound it's a joy and it's something you should thank God for they're not running away from church they're running to see what can we do for the You won't find that out there. It's unique. And I thank God for you for these young people that put on these presentations. The pressure we put on. It's phenomenal. The sisters that labor and make the different costumes for the presentation. It is phenomenal. The pressure that they're under and I put them under and what I expect from them and the gift that God puts in them. And to know that, you know, we have a voice telling us do this feel that's a lot taken by taken As mentioned, put them in for our young people. We've never done it for entertainment. We always speak for 20 odd years. The Holy Spirit has come and young people's lives. Well, it's foolish. The foolishness of preaching. But you know what? Sometimes you just have to present it in such a way that they they grab it and God has come behind it. And it was a great thing that we started with Joseph this year. It was a great thing to have a minister come from thousands of miles and start open Joseph profession. That is a great thing. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know you were a part of that. that were moved by that that was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. I just say to Christ, but I know you can't help. I don't care if it's in your I don't care. You can't I have never asked the Lord. I've never g because I'm going to get more money. I'm giving this because that's that's a principle I have just given and God has given back. He's giving me my children. He's g me a family of God that I love dear. And so I say God bless you. God just carrying us another camp and we need more help, more people. I know that God will raise up those members to make it exactly what this has been tremendous. Last year when we came in people, it was a cloud. It was the greatest I've ever been in my life. I took the young room. I said there'll be no cameras, there'll be no tape recorders, there'll be nothing. And we just rolled up our sleeves and we just started plowing getting things out of our lives. The Holy Spirit came and we we left camp and I believe the Holy Spirit has kept you at a certain level. We had camp and I saw lives changed. I've mentioned Sam You said when you have camp, we burn ourselves up for just two, three nights. I'd do it any day for a second. &gt;&gt; We do this for you. You've been bound to see you loose to see brother David going down there at a camp. God comes and moves and change lives. You know what that is to me? Every time I see David, &gt;&gt; we'll do one more time. you young ladies, it's wonderful because you're going to be mothers. You're going to have children &gt;&gt; and you're going to have to know God. &gt;&gt; You're going to have things come into your home. And this is what it's for. It's to build you up in the faith. Not to see how pretty your face is, but they have the beauty of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what camp's all about. To make young men strong in the gospel, as John has said, I read unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. In verse 14, he says, "I read unto you because you are strong and the word of God abideth in you." &gt;&gt; That's what we do to establish this at the opening comments to establish the word of God in your heart. And I'm sorry for taking up this time, but I want to thank you all for being a part of this camp. And we started at and ended at that level that we came back not to read our first Recall Thursday night was the same as it was last Saturday last year. &gt;&gt; The expectation as brother Ed preached before we came to camp. We talk about it and we preach about expectation and you get what you expect. You came and you saw and God moved. And we just want to continue this now and go from glory unto glory to glory. And I say, "God bless you, kitchen staff, those dear sisters that are in the bathroom back there sweating their brains out. We don't even hardly think about them or give them the time of day. I'll tell you one thing. They're going to have a great brother said as much as a man behind a fed us for us by the All the staff there young ladies coming up and taking our load and say God bless you and one glorious thing when we reach over there if God ever gives us a telly sheep and says what happened at Bible way care you'll know that you'll stand with the redeemed and rejoice for what you've done and laid down your lives. I say God bless you all and may this be the most glorious of every any service we had. God bless you. come at this time and get ready as the brothers come and prepare to take up the uh ties and the offering. for maybe as they're coming together. Let's sing together.

We say we appreciate you. Amen. Second Peterapter 1 verse 19. We have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto you do where unto excuse me where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn the day and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but by holy men of God that spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Chapter 3 verse four. and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, and all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water. Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth which are now and by the same were are kept in store, reserved under fire against the day of judgment and tradition of ungodly men. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that the day is the of the with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness, but is longsuffering to prosper, not willing that any should perish, but that all come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night &gt;&gt; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall burn with a melt with a fervent of heat and the earth and and the works that are therein shall be burned up. You may be seated this morning. I would like to look this morning at a sure word. We are very much living in an information age when everybody has opinion, everybody has a thought all the way from politics to world leaders to the to the television evangelist of this of our day. And we don't have too much of a effect with those guys, but they all have a thought. I mentioned last night they write books on Left Behind. They have an idea because they feel the pull of the hour and they they kind of give their synopsis, their opinions. They kind of give their thoughts of of what they think it's going to be and how it's going to take place and and the rapture of the church and the tribulation period and the earthquakes and the wars and the rumors of wars. But I'm thankful tonight that we have a sure word &gt;&gt; and we do not have to do a whole lot of dibble dabbling questioning about it because God sent a us a specific word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we look at the Bible, which millions of people look at this Bible and they read and they study through it and and they just look blindly through it and they try to put this with that and it just doesn't seem to work out. But when the scriptures once unveiled from the author of the book through the seals of this day, you can sit here and the little children can sit here today and literally just just blow the theologian's minds away. And it's not because of some traditional teaching of some Sunday school somewhere. &gt;&gt; It's not because of some white washing up of preaching. But it's because the word of God has transformed their lives. &gt;&gt; As brother Adam preached in future home, before he ever he ever went into the future home, he talked about the conduct to the people in the restaurants and the motel and in the He talked about what a great respect that the the even the managers and the owners of the motel were and the restaurants were and how that they were thrilled to have have the children of God sitting in the in in their restaurants and in their motel. You see, before that he laid out what our future home was, if there was a preparing of people that lived in that future home. What good would it do to construct a city &gt;&gt; if nobody's going to live that? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I believe that we are a people that have been predestinated before the foundation of the world to live in this day. &gt;&gt; We could not have lived in Noah's day or in Amos's day or in Elijah of the first coming day. We were not to live in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we were pre-planned before the foundation of the world to sit here this morning &gt;&gt; now. No matter what they're thinking of of of higher learning as deep complex of thoughts as they can look into the scriptures comparing scripture with scripture and text with text, there's no way for the human mind to figure it out. But God in his infinite wisdom. literally blow the minds of this last day theologians &gt;&gt; and took a man that did not have an education, &gt;&gt; did not know how to say pullpit, right? &gt;&gt; Did not have the the the quite eloquence of a lot of speakers. But God through that instrumentality spoke through that and unveiled himself to the bride of Jesus Christ and whispered the secrets to you this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says before he ever printed the word, he said and this is in his mind. He said here it is. This is in the mind of God that he brought before the foundation of the world that was ever laid. He said, "That's the reason we can put it on printed word and say that it would be." And because he saw it before the foundation of the world and knew just exactly what it would be and spoke it out and then he handed down his knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it out year by year, century by century. And we see it coming to pass just exactly. God giving us shadows of the old, of the foreshadow of the new. We see the word of word by word being fulfilled. What faith that we ought to have in the established in God. &gt;&gt; He said the mind of Christ is is to be in the church. And the mind of God was in Christ. And how that spirit led Christ ought to with his spirit lead the church. And all that was God was he poured into Christ. And all that Christ was he poured into the church. And so the church has the power that Christ has. And Christ had the power that God had. And he said, "At that day, you'll know that I'm in the Father and the Father in me and I in you and you in me." &gt;&gt; So it's not even a question anymore. &gt;&gt; Listen, when you get a real revelation of who you are, &gt;&gt; the rapture can't take place without you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bombs can't drop on your head without you being gone because you got an inoculation of the Holy Ghost of a token sign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ revealed when he's in his own word. He said, "My words are spirit and life." And Jesus said that again. The word is the seed that the ser. And we know that's true. And he said it's the it's God in word form. And it can only be interpreted by himself. The human mind is not capable to interpret the mind of God. He said, "How can a little infinite mind, a little finite mind, excuse me, interpret the infinite mind?" He says, "We can't even interpret one another's mind." &gt;&gt; How true that is, &gt;&gt; man. You know, as you're married to your wife, you can't even interpret her mind. &gt;&gt; Lord, we should have a couple You're just afraid. You young people don't know anything about that, but you'll learn one of these days. It'll be one of the quickest lessons in your whole life. Hey, brother enjoyed that. I can tell you what elephants in my living room. I don't know how well I do with that. He says when we can't even interpret one another's mind, he said you know he is the only one that can interpret it and he interprets it to whom he will. &gt;&gt; I would like to say this morning I'm glad to know tonight that I have been a privilege. &gt;&gt; I was thinking this morning as I was I was looking at this quote potentially. The most educated in the world can't sit where we're sitting today. &gt;&gt; I hope that just seems I am going to approach this a little differently this morning. But I I want you to understand sometimes we forget who we really are. And we we get so caught up with this life and the busyiness of this life and our jobs and and and our busyiness about life. Satan's learned a real trick to keep us busy. &gt;&gt; And if he can't keep us busy, he'll entertain us. &gt;&gt; And then when we come to church, we're almost like zombies and we're sitting here and we're here just for maybe a couple of hours and we're just kind of going through the motions of it. And whether we know us or not, sometimes we need just kind of laugh of who we really are. Listen, no disrespect, but the queen of England is not sitting where you're at this point. &gt;&gt; And she gets pumped and splintered and all the servants around her to take care of her every little whalem. &gt;&gt; And you said, "Oh, I'd like to have that." But you don't realize in another room there are angels of God &gt;&gt; that are with you every moment that you go. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When you go down the street, listen, you've got a better surveillance unit around you than the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; They're walking out there. They got all their insurancees and their umbrella policies and and they've got their ADT alarms and they got every kind of alarm system and the security systems and you got God. And the angels of God are dispatched around you. And listen, the devil can't get to you. Nothing can harm you until your purpose has been fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Stonewall Jackson. He was standing in the middle of a in the middle of the war, right close to where we lived. And he was standing there where he got his name, Stonewall. They looked and the battle was raging and bullets were flying and they were going every which way. And the men were retreating and some going forward and they looked out there and he was just standing. He was standing on his horse like a like a stone wall. And they said he stands like a stonewall. And they later asked him says how can you do that? Brother called him the greatest general other than other than Joshua. And he said I am as safe &gt;&gt; on the battlefield. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "As I am at home in my bed, because I know God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you come to that assurance in your life that I am a saint, brother, aren't you worried about the conditions of the world? Aren't you worried about Sodom? I want you to know I was built to overcome all that. He had a word that was pre-planned for us &gt;&gt; that anointed us in a special l &gt;&gt; to call us to a higher order. &gt;&gt; Come up. &gt;&gt; And so we said this morning, I want you to understand you are in the world's exclusive company this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh brother, I can't wait till we get there till we see everybody. You're in a good company this morning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the only one that can interpret it. He interpreted to whom he will. &gt;&gt; It didn't say mortals of all as they strove across the country in standard times. He said God in standard times and diverse manners revealed himself to the prophets. &gt;&gt; Invisible. He said, "Now notice the anointed word of his day of which you are a part of by predestination." He said, "Like you." He says, "New. When you heard that, you knew right quick that you was an eagle." &gt;&gt; When the word came, you identified yourself with the word. &gt;&gt; Listen, whatever seed that you are of, listen, the word identifies what you are. And if you don't have a receptor to it, if there's not something that pulls you to it, it lets you know the response to the word lets you know where you're from. &gt;&gt; It reflects the inheritance of where you are. So it should tell you this morning, &gt;&gt; I'm going to the rapture. There's something inside of me that responds to that word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know that there's something. He says, he said, you also realize that you was not a denominational ticket to begin with. &gt;&gt; You know there's something wrong there. There's something wrong. That's right. For you know that you're trapped into it at the beginning. He the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of God's forgiveness by the washing of the water, by the word, the blood of life. That's what the Bible said. Your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointing, the anointed bridegroom which fordained you has washed you by the washing of the word water of the water by the church. He says that don't sound right, does it? He says you might find that in an almanac. He said, but not in God's Bible, but by the washing of the water by the word. He said the word you're standing completely justified as though you never did it. You never did it at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Isn't he good to us? &gt;&gt; He says, "You are pure." &gt;&gt; And you may not think that way this morning, &gt;&gt; but you are pure. &gt;&gt; I'd rather take God's word than man's way. &gt;&gt; You have critics just like I have critics, and they look at your flaws like we talked about last night. They look at your mistakes. But when God looks at you, that's the one that you are still. &gt;&gt; You're spotless for the run because he became us that we might become him. He watched us. &gt;&gt; Luther could never figure it out. &gt;&gt; He can never figure it out. Justification, but he really didn't know the whole realm of it. &gt;&gt; But in this day, we can enjoy We can enjoy justification &gt;&gt; because no matter what lifestyle that we had, &gt;&gt; no matter what lifestyle that we came from, &gt;&gt; and I want to just come right to you this morning, young people, you're sitting here, you may be wrestling with friends of past. And you, this may be only to one or two, but I want you to understand, maybe you're sitting here this morning and you wrestle and you leave this meeting and you go back and and you you've got friends that are there and they pull they pull away from you and you pull a revival out of you and you seem to lose it seal, you're going to have to fight. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight to keep the overcoming power in your life. the one I thought the pillar of fire would would come down inside of me and I feel him all the time. He's sometimes going to lead you like an orphan child to see what you will do. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; What do I look to? You look to the word. &gt;&gt; You look to the ministry that has been given to you. And if you fall fat on your face next week, don't quit. Get back up. So many times we're looking for a utopia. We're looking for everything, all of our problems to go away. No, God just brought us here to give us strength. &gt;&gt; He brought us here to give us strength to overcome our problems. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand this morning, every one of us have to fight a battle. &gt;&gt; But we have been pre-built, pre-esigned, created that we can overcome. &gt;&gt; You'll find witness when you keep going back to the world and keep feeding from the world. &gt;&gt; Brother was he brought the illustration of the Indian, the two dogs fighting within him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Which one's winning?" And he said, "It's the one that I feed the most." And you will find carnality gets control if you feed carnality. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Listen, I want you to understand. I know young people sometimes you say, "Well, brother, I I just I just I just I can't read the message all day long. I can't listen to tapes all day long." But I want you to know, you must develop a time. &gt;&gt; You must develop a time. You must develop a plan &gt;&gt; to feed your soul. &gt;&gt; As much as you get up in the morning and eat scrambled eggs and sausage and you eat your cereal, you must develop a time to feed yourself on the un unveiled word of this day &gt;&gt; because that is the word that is anointed to help you to overcome. I want you to understand the television broadcast don't have rapturing faith on them. &gt;&gt; Oprah Winfrey don't have rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Donald Trump don't have rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Movies don't have rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; But you've been given a complex word &gt;&gt; that is revealed to the bride of Jesus Christ. The mystery of God revealed, the unveiling of God, paradox, the rapture, things that are to be, modern events made clear by prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has raptured inside of that. &gt;&gt; When you come to church, which you should come to church, &gt;&gt; everybody needs a pastor. Even brother Brown had a pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand. Oh, brother, I caught something right there. He said, "Brother Ron, brother didn't have a pastor." He sure did. He went listen to brother Neville. &gt;&gt; And he said, "This morning when brother Neville preached, I got 50 sermons." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. I heard everything that Brother Ed's got to say. I've got news for you. He may preach a sermon 27 times, but he'll never preach it the same way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you're you're a blessed people to have a man of God. &gt;&gt; You're a blessed people to have a man of God. &gt;&gt; That stood with the prophet of God &gt;&gt; that was there in the supernatural. &gt;&gt; There are very few of them. Right. &gt;&gt; Very few of these men still standing. &gt;&gt; Listen, I tell you what. Are they heroes? I say more than heroes. &gt;&gt; More than heroes. &gt;&gt; The voice of living waters that screaming out. &gt;&gt; They fought for the day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The way I feel, I just might as well set. He said, "Oh, that spiritual union of Christ is in his church now when the flesh is becoming word &gt;&gt; and the word is becoming flesh. Take the elbow and punch out like that. Right there. &gt;&gt; There's the word &gt;&gt; becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about necessarily you either. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand he said manifested, vindicated. Just what the Bible said would happen in this day. It's happening day by day. Why? It's accumulating so fast out there on those deserts and the things taking place that I can't even keep up with it. We're nearing the coming of Jesus till you be united with his church where the work becomes the work. He said the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts. You're standing completely. You never sin in the first place. God didn't even know. It's in the sea of forgiveness. You never did it. You were accused by the accuser. But really from the beginning, you were predestinated to be a son and a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You're standing. You better watch. Your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead. &gt;&gt; Absolutely out of it of existence. Even in the mind of God, you are the virtuous body of Christ washed in the blood of Christ. Precious, virtuous, sinless, the son of God, standing with the pure, unadulterated, bride word that he has washed by the water of his own word, blood that become flesh and manifested, that he might take you, which you were predestinated in the bosom of the father from the beginning. &gt;&gt; That's what he thinks about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; It ain't good to us. &gt;&gt; I want you just to notice. He says this and turn on the light. He says, "But you take the sun that shines in August and put it on the wheat today, it would kill it." Certainly, you can't do that. It must come in its season. And so must God's wheat, God, grain, ripen just the season, the season it's in. He said, "But how could a son Well, a wheat would die. The fruits would die by the sun that lives today that shines today rather its oncoming harvest is ripening. The grain would mature with the light should mature with the light. But the thing of it is the church grain don't want to mature. It wants to stay back in Moody's time and sink time and finish time and Knox and Calvin. &gt;&gt; Now that don't apply too much to you today, but it does to the denominational world. Are you with me? But because you were of a predestinated plan, you came right through that. &gt;&gt; Yes, they were carriers, but you saw the advancement of the light. Isaiah 6, she says, "Arise and shine. &gt;&gt; Thy light has come. &gt;&gt; This is another hour. This is another day. This is the advancement of the gospel coming to its maturity. So we can't live in what Luther said, what Wesley said, or some of the rest of them. We're living in the light that's predicted for this &gt;&gt; day. I I I just want to I just want to go here if it's okay. So many people has an idea of the rapture. They got all kind of ideas of trains crashing and planes crashing and hospitals being empty. Gabriel coming out on a cloud and blowing his trumpet and the whole world hearing it. And the scripture plainly says that he'll come as a thief in the night. We've heard we've heard a call come out of her many people &gt;&gt; and that rapture message has put you in process &gt;&gt; and what they were looking for they missed it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? They're expecting to stand on the street corner and say there's wrecks down here and they're standing to stay where there's chaos down here. But I want you to know way before all those things begin to take place, we're going to be gone. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now I I want you to notice in in First Thessalonians, I started to go there last night. I did go down there to chapter 4, but I want to go to chapter 5, verse one. He says, "But at the times of the season, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night." &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, if a thief breaks in, he's not going to wake you up. &gt;&gt; He's not going to come to your bedroom first and wake you up and char you and say, "Uh, Tom, we're going to steal everything that you got." &gt;&gt; It's going to be quite the opposite. &gt;&gt; The last person in the world They're going to wake up. It's &gt;&gt; time. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand, our Lord has given us a notice. &gt;&gt; And they that love his appearance &gt;&gt; are going to be on a condition or an anointing &gt;&gt; to be caught away in the word. Now, just as it was in the days of martyrs, listen, you and I don't have the we don't have the anointing to live in the day days of martyrdom where they took their children and they slayed their children. Are you with me? And they took the men to the to the post and they burned them at the stake or crucified them upside down or all the horrible the atrocities that they did to them. But they were under anointing for their day. &gt;&gt; But you are on under a different kind of anointing. &gt;&gt; You're under a rapture anointing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Your anointing is completely different. &gt;&gt; Brother Lman, I I you know, I could have never given my life. It wasn't your call to do that. &gt;&gt; But I want you to understand here you are going to overcome layout of sin. &gt;&gt; They read the same scriptures that we read. &gt;&gt; They know the same quotations that we go to. But you It's not a church anointing. &gt;&gt; It's not a religious anointing. It's an anointing from the mighty angel &gt;&gt; that has come upon you. &gt;&gt; Listen, you didn't beg for it. You didn't bleed for it. You didn't pull it down. But God has manifested it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were pressurized to live in this &gt;&gt; day. He says now Christ revealed his own word again. He said now we know that God chose by predestination his church, his place, his prophets and all about it. By fornowledge he predestinated his prophet and when he when the age arrived he had his prophet arrive at the same time and inspired him as he wrote the Bible by him. Now God wrote the Bible only use of the prophet because that's his way of doing it. He said you see it is it is not the word you. So see it is the word of God and not the word of a man. God is a person. God can speak. God can talk. God can write. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to do it that way. But that's the way that he chose to do it. He didn't have to do it that way. But he chose to do it that way. God wrote with his finger. He he he he his majest his own majestic finger the ten commandments. So God could write it himself if he wanted to. But he chose to write it through the prophets because it was his attributes his word and he expressed through them making it part and a part of him. He could write with his finger. He also r his finger and wrote on the walls of Babylon thou way in the balance and found one. God can talk. He said you believe God can talk. He talked to Moses on the mount of burning bush. You believe that? He talked to John from in the form of a dove. You believe that? And said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in." He talked to him. He spoke to Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration before Peter, James, and John. He can talk. He's not mute. He can talk. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother, I want to hear him talk." You are. There's never been a day when his voice was m not not not no more louder than this day. &gt;&gt; This day that he revealed himself to the voice of a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said there's so many voices in the land today. Powerful voices. &gt;&gt; Voices that might even shake nations. Might even confuse people. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? People get their eyes on this televangelist and that televangelist. He's the latest in the click. Listen, many of them are only using this voice. &gt;&gt; Many of them are only taking a part &gt;&gt; of what the prophet said and breaking it down to their denominational filter. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we had a sure word. &gt;&gt; It didn't come out of a cemetery seminary. It didn't come from some dead theology. &gt;&gt; It didn't come from Uriah Smith. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It came from the mind of God. &gt;&gt; And you're magnetized. You have a trained ear. I want you to understand there was a forained word to a forain predestinated s. And when you heard that word, you were not satisfied with the voices of the world. I'm sorry, Dr. Nelson, don't do it for me. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, John Haggy. Don't do it for them. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, TDJs, don't do it for me. &gt;&gt; All of their anointed. Sure, they're anointed. &gt;&gt; They're anointed false prophets of the day, but we've had one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've had one. &gt;&gt; Brother Graham said, I just found it the other day. He said they'll have their mega churches and they do. &gt;&gt; They have their 35,000, their 25,000s. They have their Jos preaching, so here I am. &gt;&gt; They have their voices of psychology. &gt;&gt; They asked Joel the other day on a on a radio broadcast, why don't you why do you not even preach against sin? He said, sin is a matter of thinking. What is it? They want a church of their own choosing. &gt;&gt; They want a Jesus of their own making. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what they want. They want some religious order. &gt;&gt; Make nothing to change their lives. &gt;&gt; I believe this message will not only will not only call you to a higher calling, but it'll transform your life. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Listen, the religious system don't want to don't want to buckle down to the word because it would ruin their societies. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. The Jezebels that sit in their lips &gt;&gt; can wear a dress or a bikini, whatever they want, to the to church, &gt;&gt; stand at the choir and sing the songs of Zion and live like hell. &gt;&gt; It only shows we're a part of the song. We're in this solemn condition &gt;&gt; and the ministries of Sodom, that's all they've got to preach to because it's the law of supply and demand. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; They may have started out with good intentions. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. They may have started out kind of the right way, but because Are you with me now? But because of the compromising spirit &gt;&gt; and the political framework within the church and their fear of their pocketbook, &gt;&gt; brother one, why does preachers go to pocketbooks? Listen, if you can't trust God with your ties &gt;&gt; and men with your ties, I wouldn't trust him with my soul. And you say, "Oh, brother Ron, you guys preach on tithes." I want you to know it's a biblical order &gt;&gt; and it's a biblical command. &gt;&gt; And God will either bless you by it or curse you by it. &gt;&gt; I would hate to stand there that day on that day and and a piece of money be between me and God. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We preach on hair. We preach on how they dress. We preach on big city men in charge. Why don't us preach on ti? &gt;&gt; I can't afford to pay tithe. I got news for you. You can't afford not to pay. &gt;&gt; God can do more with 90 than he can do with a 100 every day of the week. &gt;&gt; You guys can straighten this out later. Come on, church. I've been a businessman. &gt;&gt; Still, I'm a businessman. And I can prove to you. &gt;&gt; I can prove to you that God will bless your business when you pay tax. &gt;&gt; He will bless your household when you pay tax. He'll bless your life. He'll bless your health. He'll bless your children. &gt;&gt; He's commanded a blessing upon you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, we're to take dominion over every every aspect of our life. &gt;&gt; Dominion over our job, &gt;&gt; dominion over our own money, &gt;&gt; dominion over our temper, &gt;&gt; dominion over everything of our lives. We're supposed to bring ourselves as a husband and wife under submission to one another. Bring our children in submission to the word and to the token of the hour. And I'll tell you what you can do. You can open the windows of heaven and God will pour out a blessing on you. &gt;&gt; It's true. prophets did not always understand what they were writing, &gt;&gt; what they were saying, &gt;&gt; or that they in no wise would have it said. &gt;&gt; He said if they didn't understand it, he said, but the Bible said they were moved by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Moved. I pray that God moves us this morning. &gt;&gt; He said they were moved by the Holy Ghost. He said, "When the Holy Ghost moves you, you move." &gt;&gt; I'm waiting on tomorrow. When the Holy Ghost moves you in this meeting, you move. &gt;&gt; When he comes to you, you come. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He won't always do that. The spirit won't always strive with men. &gt;&gt; Five wise, five foolish. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; The wise, they moved. &gt;&gt; They made sure they had all in their laps. &gt;&gt; They were very diligent. They were zealous to repent. They grab that all. They grab that anointing. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm afraid it might make me act a little bit different. It will. &gt;&gt; It will. If you get it just right, it will make you act different. You'll get so excited coming to church. Tell your friends won't understand it. &gt;&gt; It'll make you so excited. Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll make you so excited when you hear brother Rod begin to lead sing or whoever's ladies sing and he begins to sing about the songs of Zion. You identify &gt;&gt; you identify with that song because that's where you're going. &gt;&gt; It's heaven or not California or bust or bust. It's heaven or bus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's good to &gt;&gt; I want you to just notice we quoted this before, but I want to go here. He says, "Everyone now there's there's just no revival. Everybody's complaining, ministers crying. I was in one of the outstanding papers that comes to the church, a very fine paper. I know the editor. I know the people. Knowing them didn't save them. &gt;&gt; He said a very fine paper. He said, "I know them. I know the I know the people. They're godly people. They're very fine." Brother and sister are the herald of his coming. One of the finest papers on the field. Herald of his coming. Hardly will print anything unless it's about fast and pray. Fast and pray. Sound a trumpet. He said, "How many reads it?" He said, "You know, &gt;&gt; notice what he says here." And you know, &gt;&gt; and listen, and you know, &gt;&gt; you know what I've already said is true. &gt;&gt; Just as much as I said this about about the the denominations of the day, they don't have anything. &gt;&gt; They're pointing you back to revival of two or 300 years ago, &gt;&gt; the glad of another day. And brother said, "That's the greatest robbery." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You with me now? I want you to understand there's an updated revival. &gt;&gt; I'm not just talking about one in 1965. I'm talking about one of this &gt;&gt; because the emphasis of God is right now. &gt;&gt; We had to learn. It's in our hearts. Now, what will we do with that? &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Fast and pray. Fast and pray." He says, you know, he said, "Fast and pray. That's all you hear. Fast and pray. We're going to have a great breaking of the day. There's a great thing that's going to happen. All of you. Pray. Pray. Pray. We're not too late yet." Why are they doing that? Why did they do that? They want a great awakening. They're crying, believing that there will be an awakening. They're good people. Why is it? They Why haven't they done that? They have not recognized the awakening of the bride. By being a Christian, they feel the pull of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave this quote without going to to your house. He said that's what they may that's what's making them feel that way. &gt;&gt; They know something's happened. Something something's supposed to happen, but they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you. &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, let me just say this to you. Don't let that be your testimony this morning. &gt;&gt; Don't let the awakening of the word of this day ever to become familiar to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, the message, I've got it made, the message is more than books and tapes. &gt;&gt; End time evangelism is more than quotes. &gt;&gt; There's a life that comes with this. That's a life of overcoming life of a transforming. &gt;&gt; Sure, there's people that sit right here. They feel the pull. &gt;&gt; They feel the fool. Are you with me? They feel the pull. We need to get closer to God. &gt;&gt; But don't wait too late. &gt;&gt; Don't wait till next year's meeting. &gt;&gt; How long does it take? &gt;&gt; Jesus was on the mountain. Brother, what is the on the mountain. Seven days later, he was in a tomb. Think about this morning. Oh, brother. I can wait a few days. I got news for you. You've already seen in the events of just the last month &gt;&gt; how fast the whole world can change. &gt;&gt; Earthquakes has happened this week while I've been here. &gt;&gt; Things have While we've been secluded at this camp, &gt;&gt; world conditions changing, what they're talking about in the in the back rooms of powers to a one world government, uh the the nations coming together. I want you to know the hand of God is turning very quickly. &gt;&gt; Why is it? It's because we're returning to the season. We come into the season of it's not way off somewhere. It's happening right now among us. If we can only catch what is going on. &gt;&gt; Open see nothing great. The fastest acceleration of growth takes place at the last stage when the stuff is up high and it can't seem to grow. &gt;&gt; Everybody can see it during the sun and and it's growing and growing and growing quickly. But when it's at the last stage &gt;&gt; when the maturity starts taking place that is the fastest acceleration of growth. when the sea is replicating itself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young people, listen. You don't have to wait two years, 5 years. Let the word replicate itself in your life. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait till you get married. You don't have to wait till you have children. Listen, let that word so fill your heart. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said they're right now uniting. &gt;&gt; Brother, is that true? They're coming to the battle of Armageddon. &gt;&gt; Exactly what they will do. &gt;&gt; And they are coming. &gt;&gt; We're seeing pre-tribulation times even now. &gt;&gt; He says they're uniting for it right now. He said that's why we we've got to a and everything that we have. The western world is united against the eastern world. But then it goes to communism and so forth. It's all united together. The churches are uniting together. Everything seems to be uniting. Uniting uniting themselves together. We see that. Say, "Brother Ron, how's those churches?" This is the umbilical cord is father, son, holy ghost baptism. actually go to court right back to Rome. &gt;&gt; I was standing with a with a lady one time and she was she was a secretary within the Catholic church and it was actually working for her and so we begin to talk and she's she said are you a Christian? I said yes. Yes, I am. She said, "You know, we're all one big church." Well, here we go. And I said, "How do you mean?" She says, "Well, it's kind of like this." Said, "Everybody's Catholic." I said, "Well, how do you mean that?" She says, "Well," she said, "In the Catholic system," says we have daughters. And I said, "Uh, are you sure about that?" She said, "Oh, yeah. We've got daughters." Said, "We allow them to call themselves Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian." She went right down the lines. &gt;&gt; She said, "But the umbilical cord," and listen how she so quotes the message. The umbilical cord is the trinitarian baptism. &gt;&gt; It is the umbilical cord that holds them all together. And I looked at her and I said, "I'm not one of them." &gt;&gt; She said, "What do you mean?" I told her, I said, "We believe a message of Malachi 4 that brought us back to the original word, &gt;&gt; the original baptism of Acts 2:es 38. &gt;&gt; We're the same message believers." She said, "You are our enemy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am proud to be identified as her enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Antipus and I may not be saying that exactly right, &gt;&gt; but as he as he was stood, listen, God had him standing in the middle of the seat of Satan and he overcome. And if he can stand there, so can I. &gt;&gt; I'm glad to repair the reproach of Jesus Christ in this day. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'd like to be there. Listen, you have a greater testimony even today. &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew children will stand there in awe of you. in all of you that you overcome this day &gt;&gt; in these solemn conditions when they don't even know which is supposed to get married. Man, woman, woman, man. All the woman, woman, man, man, &gt;&gt; hip. &gt;&gt; We get to all the pieces about 911 and and America kills more babies in one day than was killed on 911. &gt;&gt; I still call it murder. &gt;&gt; I'm not going political. I'm just calling out sin. &gt;&gt; But we have had an advancement. &gt;&gt; We may live in Sodom, but we're not upside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We may our bodies may be trapped in Leosa, but we're caught up into a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is uniting his bride. She's coming together from the east, the west, the north, and the south. And no truer church could say that tonight. He said there's a uniting time and that's on right now. What she's united for. United for the rapture. &gt;&gt; God's getting her ready. &gt;&gt; United what she united with with the word. The heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away. She's uniting herself with thus sayith the Lord. Regardless of what the name denomination or anybody else says. She's uniting herself. She's getting ready. &gt;&gt; She's putting on the wedding. &gt;&gt; Let us be glad and rejoice &gt;&gt; for the lamb's wife &gt;&gt; has made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And to her that she was granted that she should be arrayed and fine women. &gt;&gt; We have been well clothed with the cloth of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're not some modern day strip tease. We have been well clothed with the word. &gt;&gt; It has covered every corner. It's covered every facet. &gt;&gt; Brother, everything's not in the message. Okay. Let me give you an example. My little boy, my second one, of course, had temper tons when he was a baby because he's born just like his mother. I will stand to correct that. I go home and live with her. You know that I'm redhead and you know where that comes from. But I want you to understand we took him to he would he would just literally just pass out. He just pass out. He'd go into pass. We went on a month with that thing. You know, we'd blow in his mouth and we'd shake him and we'd do everything in the world. We you know we were just terrified of the events. So we took him to the hospital one night cuz he had a really bad abs episode. My dad said you didn't take that boy to the hospital said something wrong with him. So we took him to the hospital. The doctor looked at him and checked him out just well and you know just went over everything and came back in and sat down. He was kind of chopped up and he said you know he said some children have a little switch inside of them. He said, "Then I'll throw a little temper tantrum and they'll throw off this switch and they'll just pass out." He said, "What their craven attention? The best thing you can do is just lay them down and walk out of the room." He said, "It seems hard to do, but that's what you need to do." &gt;&gt; Well, we went home. I was getting ready for bed, so I was going to do a little night reading that night. I picked up the spoken word book and I just opened up the page just kind of like this and I began to read the first paragraph and brother Brandham said it's just like a little child that has a temper tantrum. &gt;&gt; And he says he's got kind of like a little switch that he just kind of flows off and he just passes out. He said he's craving attention. Listen, I could have saved myself $200. Oh, you're saying brother, but God's not that mindful of you. Listen, I got grounded in Cincinnati, Ohio. I was grounded, but I couldn't get on the plane. I couldn't make the first meeting. And I was just happy. You know how you are. Don't act angels. And I was just a touchy, you know, and I've been complaining to everybody and everybody that needed to be complained to. And so they finally, brother. And so anyway, they give me they give me some vouchers. What good's vouchers? They're not going to make the first night. And so I just go down, you know, and I walk and I get myself a Cinnabon. Hallelujah. Everybody needs one when they're hungry. I get myself a big old Starbucks cup of coffee. And I was sitting there just, you know, just stewing. I drank up and eat all them calories that I didn't need. Eat it today, wear it four days. Then I go down to the library and I go into the religious section. I think, you know, something's got to suit me. And I pick up a book and I open this book up and it's and it's it's a religious book and I think Charles Schuler actually the one who wrote it. Anyway, I pick it up and I open it up. He said, "You're standing in an airport. You've just been grounded and you're hung." And he said, "You God don't know where you are. Hey, I bought the book. &gt;&gt; God knows everything about you. &gt;&gt; He's pre-planned you. &gt;&gt; He's ordained you. He's called you. He knows exactly where you're sitting at this morning. &gt;&gt; Listen, he wants to go home with you. &gt;&gt; You may miss your flight. God help me. You may miss your flight. You may have to stand four hours in line. But I want you to know he's going to stand right there with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we preachers have a good time, too. So that's the way it is. He said, "You see," he said, "we see nations united. We see the world uniting. We see churches uniting. We see the bride united." &gt;&gt; She did. &gt;&gt; She looks beyond our failures. &gt;&gt; She appreciates all the gifts in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he says and he says and we see the bride united with the word and the word is God and that's the word and that's the bridegroom being the word and the bride being the hearer of the word. They come together in a union. They unite like a wedding. They're getting ready for a wedding and they become one. The word becomes you and you become the word. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will and it shall be done. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to quit. But I want you to understand this morning. You are the most powerful people there is on the earth. &gt;&gt; Condisa Rice, George Bush, Pal those People really think they got pull. &gt;&gt; They're going to straighten every situation out in the world. &gt;&gt; Well, really what they ought to do is consult you. people in the whole world are you. &gt;&gt; And when you go on your knees, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of hell &gt;&gt; literally goes into a convulsion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are an ambassador on the earth. &gt;&gt; You don't have a phony badge and a phony uniform. You got the credentials. &gt;&gt; You have the identification. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have the identification from another realm. &gt;&gt; That life is inside of you and it's pulling you to a higher order. &gt;&gt; And you're only here just for a little spell. But while you're here, you are in control of your atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And you can just look at the enemy and say, "I don't have to put up with that. You can do that after I'm gone &gt;&gt; because while I'm here, this is a sanctuary for God and myself to communicate. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take it &gt;&gt; to be right side. Well, all the host of heaven will assemble. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's going to be a glorious sign. &gt;&gt; Oh, the saints and spotless wide. &gt;&gt; Oh, with Jesus, we're going to spend eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, come and come and die. Oh, you made that Jesus all the time. Turn the water into the fall down through the Take his ever glorious Christine Jesus. to the air and all the host glorif All Jesus coming from Jesus all the He loves you. coming down. We all Let you have your seat for a moment. Want to make a couple of comments. We enjoy brother Ron Spencer. preaches with purity &gt;&gt; and preaches with conviction &gt;&gt; and preaches truth &gt;&gt; and that's what we like about I'm so happy that the bride of Jesus Christ has this kind of ministry &gt;&gt; and I I love the positive ministry &gt;&gt; about two weeks before the camp began and although the the whole focus for a year You just hold it in your heart. And brother Tom, I trust him to just have that leadership of the Holy Spirit. And it has been it's been true. There's a thing. And God has a mind. Each one of you that are sitting here just want you to ponder that for a moment that God Almighty, creator of heavens and earth, to think of this little dot on the globe called the Earth, to think of this spot called Camp Horizon. And to think of the people that are going to be there and the labors that are going to be involved and the minister that will be ministering. And now I've got to bring my thought down and get them all into one mind. And as we come and and the meetings begin to unfold and and and we with our little uh minds that are so limited, we pick up little tidbits here and there and after a while we say God is a mind. &gt;&gt; What a what a revelation that is. Of course he has a mind. Why should we even have to say that? God had a mind long before we realized it. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Tom starts feeling we we will bring forth Joseph. We want the young people and the children. And I wish everybody would have seen it. And they made a presentation of Joseph. I'm sorry. I have to apologize to the sisters that so about five or more of them. And so they garments, original looking garments for for Pharaoh and Piper and their attendants and their guards and and for Joseph and the butler and the baker and all of them and all the all the painting and those that painted. I didn't have them stand. We appreciate that. But I asked brother Tom just on the platform, when did you first begin to think and that came to you about Joseph? About two weeks before So we begin July and I know how God dealt with us and myself last year and how we went right into the ritual ruler and brother Ron came and began to minister on that. So here they began to prepare for Joseph and then we have the two evenings. Then brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother brother Ron can't get here on time so he doesn't get to see the presentation on Wednesday night. It was Tuesday, Wednesday, what Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday. Then he doesn't get here. And so, uh, he comes and speaks on Joseph. Not the next day, but the next day I had a meeting I had to go see a man on the Canadian side. And so, I thought, um, I might as well just I might as well play a tape and make use of this time. So, I'm driving. I reached in. I have a bunch of tapes in there and I just reached and grabbed the first box and shook it. It was empty and I looked at it said masterpiece. So I just put it back in and grabbed the next one and and it was masterpiece. So I looked at it says masterpiece the second second part. So I thought probably the first one's in the tape. It's already in the tape there. So I'll just punch it. tape on punch of tape on first words like Joseph. He was at the end of a sentence &gt;&gt; and he had already said a sentence and his first words and his only words at that moment was like Joseph said and began then to go into details about Joseph. How he how he had to be smitten. Joseph had to be smitten so that he could be a perfect a perfect type of the perfect masterpiece who had to be smitten for us and we were because he was smitten. We came we came into being. We came to be and and and some days ago and I I have I have some notes already making some notes and those you that will be in church Lord willing on Sunday and I very very rarely ever ever announce what I'm going to preach on but I feel that I will be speaking on Joseph son of prosperity that's what he was and We are the product of his prosperity. When brother Brandon was here and was revealing the son of man, that's Joseph. The graineries were full. It was Joseph that opened up the graineries. Joseph had this had the plan and the program. And in the time of famine, the graineries were open. And the prophesies through the prophet in the last days &gt;&gt; there will be a famine &gt;&gt; not of Bibles it didn't say Bibles it didn't say a famine of the word said a famine of hearing the word &gt;&gt; there were not ears to hear the word and there were not speakers there were speakers but there was not speakers speaking the word so there was a famine of hearing the both on the recipient side and on the pulpit side. A famine of hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had a a spoken tent like this. And there were thousands in tents, much larger tents in buildings and all around the world. And tens of thousands of thousands and thousands of people were healed. The supernatural. But that was the prosperity of Joseph. &gt;&gt; But finally the graineries were open &gt;&gt; and the people were able to get get grain get seed and the prosperity of Joseph truly is the word that he finally delivered. But there was in the end time there was only a few &gt;&gt; that really were there to hear it. &gt;&gt; And now friends here in this I thought it's enough for us to talk about what has been. But right amongst us are supernatural things that God has done. And many here know, but many, many don't know. Where's Benjamin? Is he here? Where is he? I want him to stand up. Take it back to the bedroom. You might as well come up here. We've got the We've got the X-rays of this boy's broken neck. Having jumped out of a treehouse onto a trampoline to get more air. He got lots of air and landed on his head off of the trampoline. Stand up here. Stand up for a moment. And we've got the X-rays where the break isn't done right within a few hours. And but that doesn't give anybody eternal life. &gt;&gt; But then people say, "Well, I want to see the supernatural." There's more miracles in this congregation than you folks know about. &gt;&gt; Stand up. Maybe you might as well come stand here on this side. This girl's medical file is probably 2 and 1 half to 3 in thick and she was having seizures so frequently and the best medical in the children's hospital best medical specialist telling her parents Brother Leon, Sister Brandon, and preparing their parents. This girl will be in a wheelchair. She'll be a vegetable. She can't live. She was having such severe uh convulsions. And her daddy said, "It's a devil." &gt;&gt; And his wife agreed with him. It's a devil &gt;&gt; and we're not going to accept it. But the convulsions kept coming kept coming worse and they put them in touch. You're going to need to be in touch as parents with a support group. And it's a very rare disease. She hasn't there aren't many of them, but we'll put you in touch with a support group. I'm not talking about history now. I'm talking about you're looking at something &gt;&gt; and God heal her. It's not a real show that it's a spirit hero called down in a park, Redwood Park, and some mentally challenged people were there that have mental problems and a convulsion demon came on her and her mom called and we prayed and it left. And the second time her daddy along I believe with brother Eric was out hunting and it came on from the Okanagan and her mom called and it came on when both heads of homes were away and we rebuked that devil &gt;&gt; and it left her to my knowledge up to last time. &gt;&gt; Is God alive? come down. &gt;&gt; How about Andre? Go chair. See here. Andre, come standing here. You can come up to the front. Anyway, both his mom and dad are here. He was only a few weeks old and he was rushed into Vancouver from the White Rock Hospital. rushed into Vancouver because he couldn't live and the hospital made a mistake and gave him two or three times an adult portion of medication as a small boy and got into unconscious state and rushed into Vancouver General Hospital and our whole office went into a a a convulsion of emotion and brother Mike Hunt went into prayer called the office One of our receptionist took the phone call. He said, "It's over. You can stop praying. It's finished. God healed him." And they said at the hospital, they said, "This boy will be a vegetable for the rest of his life cuz this this medication has destroyed his brain." I don't think that's true. Say, "What are you doing, brother?" I'm talking about Joseph, the son of prosperity. &gt;&gt; You can't buy those things with money, &gt;&gt; and we haven't got time. I mentioned Brother Jim Douly the other day. Brother Jim Douly came and and was in our service and told me God spoke to him through for prophetic utterance and they couldn't have any more children. They have three and all three of them are here at this time. John and Suel and that's why he's named and three that have been with him. They should stand &gt;&gt; and remain standing. You heard it last night. Brother Ron Spencer &gt;&gt; falling 40 ft onto the concrete. Why don't you stand, brother Ron? We're going to give glory to God. &gt;&gt; Where's Brother David? Brother David here. Brother David, why don't you stand down there? Listen friends, you read you read articles. I stood at his bedside while he while he was being eaten up with flesh eating disease, dreaded disease, called his children out of school, had them check to make sure they hadn't contacted him. And he was in a deep unconscious state. God said to me, "Tell him stand in the company of the saints and give glory to God." &gt;&gt; And I didn't know how I was going to tell him. He was in a total unconscious state. And Sister Violet Law, his wife, is with him now. Had just walked out of the ICU. And I walked in. I said, "How is he?" Said, "He's the same." I walked in. His mom and dad had already gathered. They expect him to die at any moment. I walked in and he was in that unconscious state nurse sitting right at his feet. I said, "How is it?" She said, "We're just taking a day at a time while she looked at her chart and watching the monitors." I put my hands on the rail. As I put my hands on the rail, looked down at him, his eyes open, and he smiled and he said, "Hi, brother Ed." I said, "Brother David, God has sent me here with a message. You're going to stand in the company of the saints and give the the clock about 90 days later. You may not know it, but brother Tom and Joanne Ray couldn't have children and they tried everything. And that's why the first one is called Samuel. Brother, brother Sydney Jackson from South Africa, good friend of Brighton Jones, visited our church. And when he left after the first visit, he sent me a letter. And in the letter was a little piece of cloth turned yellow with age. And he said, "Brother Eddie, your daughter, I don't remember her name. She was the last to get married. Your youngest daughter, the last to get married. She and her husband are desiring a child. He said, "I've included a cloth that Brother Brandham prayed over." When he visited our country in 1951, please give this to them and tell them to read Matthew uh I believe it was 12 and uh 244. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive it and you shall have it. And I would go home to house and gave him the cloth. I said, "It's been sent to you by brother Cindy Jackson." And she called me back since I arrived home and said, "Who should wear this? I or brother Tom?" I said, "Well, you want to conceive, you wear it." And she said, "What?" And as I calculated it back, she conceived within a week. And the next one, Michael, wouldn't come. They both came to the front and like a wind came through my back arched back like that. And I cried out, "Let life come." &gt;&gt; And I came. And about three and a half years later in India with my wife sitting on a chair in a corner at this little room in a poor Indian hotel. And I just knelt and threw my this Bible that I have here open. And just as I threw open a voice within me said, "You'll have another grandson. His name will be Joel." And that's that's all supernatural. &gt;&gt; I say, "Son of prosperity, I look down and see Brother Ron Spencer fell out of a tree 30 40 ft out of a building out of the concrete. There's brother JB. You ought to stand, brother James. Give glory to God. This this man fell out of the tree with his power chainsaw. Fell out of the tree with his power chainsaw and landed on a pile of rocks and broke up his bones. And they I can't tell you the rest. When I first saw him, I thought he'd never take another step. And here he is today doing what I say he shouldn't have been climbing trees again. Brother Cam Buck. Brother Ken, I looked for him, but I couldn't see him. He's probably flying. Brother Ken Buck. You say, "Well, you've mentioned them so many times." Brother Brandham talks about people that have been healed 30, 40 years before like they just been healed last week. But God's eternal and what he has done, he can do again. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can do it right now. There's people here who need miracles. But I want to just close with this in just a moment. Sister Eileen Waldner, &gt;&gt; why don't you stand, Sister Eileen? When they first came here, she mustn't have any more children. She had big David. Where's Brother David? Stand up, David. Why don't you stand? We can never miss you. There he is with his children. Brother David's a product and she's not supposed to have any more children and has him. I say, "Praise God." We're just a man of snow. Stand up, Amanda. This girl had a leukemia. She didn't look like she was tonight or this morning. I say God delivered her from that. That's not long ago. I'm doing this to confirm the son of prosperity is here. But I have a very special purpose in doing this. Sister Beth Dingle, I don't think she's here. Sister Beth here? Her mom is here. Sister Beth, God bless you. to the best stand fought with this demon of leukemia for about eight years. This girl's file in the hospital in Edmonton is about about 12 in high. And if you haven't seen the video, the best story, you need to get it and keep it. And I've heard from all over the world. I want you to keep standing. Sister brother, sister Sister Schmaltz aren't here. They just had their family dedicated. Couldn't have any children of 13 years and they were prayed for. Brother Tom, brother Laz were there and prayed for and they have two children today. Oh, there are so many. Where's Matthew? Alex and boy. Where's Matthew? Matthew. Tell me stay here. Matthew, anybody that can't be seen, I want them to come. This boy was floating down a river, &gt;&gt; upside down in a river. He was lost from his father and mother. Floated down a river, and all they could see was the whites of his feet, his two feet, and he was gone. And his father was trying to retrieve him. And they got him out of the water and he was lifeless. And brother Alex knew nothing about the message living way out in the wilderness. You always say living like the jungles, brother. And he screamed out to God to save his son. And his son came after him. &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you. That's just a few &gt;&gt; throughout this congregation is miracle after miracle after miracle. But the greatest miracle that took place is that you are here. Satan is defeated and you have been born again of the spirit and word of God. &gt;&gt; Listen to me friends. This is what I want to conclude with just like these that are here. There have been outstanding miracles by the tens of thousands in brother Graham's meetings. But that was not the fullness of the riches of Joseph. Joseph came to bring the seed back to the people, &gt;&gt; the word back. The greatest riches that we have had here in this camp is that we've had a man, we've had a a one one of God's servants been raised under the sound of a prophet's voice. to me, not to me only, but to you. The greatest riches, it's not that you that have been healed and have these miracles that have happened. And I I want the congregation to respond if you catch what I'm saying. The greatest riches is that the revelation &gt;&gt; of the word of God. &gt;&gt; This is no longer a mystery. We're no longer tied by an umbilical cord to Rome or any denominational system or any trinity. That the cord's been cut. &gt;&gt; The greatest riches is that this word has been unveiled to us. We've heard the preaching of the word of God and transforming power has been carried by that word and lives have been transformed. from the last year to this year. And if you are here, you young people that are here and maybe you feel, "Well, I don't really feel." You don't have to feel a whole lot. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel anything. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is say, "I believe. It's been spoken. I receive it. I confess it. I will thank God for it." And and that transforming power takes place. Even I tell you that Benjamin the Curtney, he didn't have any special feeling when when One moment the bone was broken next when it wasn't. She doesn't know anything about where did those uh where did all those convulsions go? They don't know. They didn't have any big feeling about it. All they know is it happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I thought I had to conclude my comments with this camp. Something supernatural. Joseph, the son of prosperity, has been here with us &gt;&gt; and he's been making known his riches, &gt;&gt; his power, &gt;&gt; his glory, &gt;&gt; his promises to &gt;&gt; been whispering to his friends, &gt;&gt; been whispering his love secrets. &gt;&gt; All you that have stood and have received, I'm so thankful for your testimony. God bless each one of you. I wonder if we could say we'll give all the glory to Jesus &gt;&gt; and tell his love. Would you sing it with me? &gt;&gt; This is nobody. This is no glory to the way. This is no glory to any man. We give all the glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But it's a reality, friends. &gt;&gt; Listen, I feel I'm not getting it through to some of you. Jesus performed multitudes of miracles but they left him suddenly &gt;&gt; when he began when he began to reveal himself. How many did he have? Just a handful. &gt;&gt; Just a handful. &gt;&gt; Do you know that on one occasion we have about a thousand people here. Do you know that Jesus lost almost five times the number that's in this tent? 4,988 left him. And when they left him and if you all left and I was left with just 12 people here, I can't I I'd have to be honest and say I would have a twins of disappointment. So what in the world what were they following? Well, maybe they were just following the miracle. Oh, I had a broken neck. Oh, I had compulsion. Oh, I had a heart attack or I had leukemia or I had something. Oh, I got healed. Where are you now? I don't know. I I can't take that. Starting to tell me how I got to dress. Telling me what I telling me how I got to live. I can't take that. Tell me he's God in the flesh. I can't handle that. And I would have a twinge of disappointment. But tonight, I look on you this morning rather &gt;&gt; and I see you as God's handful that's been left. the group that's been left. And if God gives us another year, I personally will testify to you that I believe we'll be at a different level next year than we are this year. and whatever God has in store for you, I'm looking down on you and charging you to be victorious &gt;&gt; and deny Satan &gt;&gt; when he comes because he is a temptor &gt;&gt; and he is an adversary &gt;&gt; and he will work against you as our brother Ron Sper said this morning. But I personally charge you in the name of Jesus Christ. You are to be victorious. &gt;&gt; You are to be identified with the conqueror. &gt;&gt; Is that putting a little bit of fear? No, it doesn't put fear on you. As Moses said, who's on the Lord's side? &gt;&gt; Joshua, stand here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you see what's already here, you say there's nothing. There's nothing that Satan can throw my way but what I'll be victorious over &gt;&gt; and he has opened his word to us &gt;&gt; and that's the greatest thing that that he can do. We'll give all the glory to Jesus. I don't understand his love his love glory to Jesus and his wonderful We give him the glory to Jesus and tell him his wonderful will to Jesus and tell his wonderful Oh, you give the glory to Jesus and tell you his wonderful love. You give all the glory to Jesus and tell his &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell your saints you don't want to leave. &gt;&gt; All right, we have a message. Don't shoot the messenger. The young people have a song. So, the young people, you have time for a song. &gt;&gt; All right, then. Why don't you have your seats? We're going to sing of this wonderful Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Nobody but you, Lord. Nobody but you. Nobody but you, Lord. Nobody but you. When I was in trouble, you came to my resue. Nobody but you, Lord. Nobody but you.

Nobody but you. Amenus Christ. Amen. For what he's done within our lives within this young people. and watching it and not doing it big difference. You have heard the purpose of God unfold in this camp. Stonewall Jackson great and he had a walk with he was the guy that was sort of the artillery guy with the he overrun by the Mexicans. They were coming against the uh the United States and everybody was on the run except Stonewall Jackson, right? Everybody's on the run except Stonewall Jackson and he's maning his cannon and he's loading him with balls and he's firing him and he's all by himself and everybody in his troop left and they were running over the hill and then one fellow looked back and he seen Stonewall Jackson the enemy. He says what is he doing? So he turns around and says, "Hey, if Stonewall can do it, I can do it." So then another one said, "Hey, if he can do it, I can do it." &gt;&gt; So they all start running back, men cannons, and they defeated the enemy. All right? So they didn't run. You know what he had? A revelation of who he was. He said, "The enemy can't kill me. until God's finished with me. Find your purpose. Go on with God. He's the same God as we close. That same God that spoke to Moses. He's the same God. Where is he now? Living in me. It's not a history book anymore, but it's a living reality that God is living. Not in just Jackson, not in just William. You young people that are left here. I said we all praise the Lord. Let your light so shine in this dark generation. Let the reality of God manifest within your life. That same God is living in me. You know, people come to church, come, they want the blessing. Never come to church, but they come at special occasions. We want committed people. Committed young people know who they are. Stand for the right. Shut the wrong. Take the word and realize now it's God living in me. You heard a tremendous word this week. You take it now within your heart and make this a declaration if it's real to you. And I ask you, not the adults, you young people, that you would stand and sing this for the glory of God. I got a choir behind me that there be a choir in front of me. He's the same. The same God who wonders too many to tell. The same God is pardoning the raing sea. He's the same God who's living in the same God to the woman at the well. The same God who wonders too many to dare. The same God who pardoned the raid and the same God who wonders Too many to tell. The same God who pardons the raising red. He is the same God who's living in. Thank him for that. As we get ready, just thank him for that. Thank God that he's living in me. Thank God that the power of God's living in me. Thank God that that open word, that quickening power is living in me. Father, close of this wonderful, wonderful week you've given us. Lord, it's been glorious from the first opening meeting, Lord, for junior camp all the way to the end. Lord, it's been glory unto glory. Father it be like just saying Lord would you just give us one more week one more week Lord Father one day one glorious day it'll be unending it will be camp meeting after camp meeting after camp meeting after camp meeting the saints will rejoice around the throne of grace will rejoice that glorious day and so Lord as as those that have come forth this great effort I pray that you'll pour upon them blessing upon blessing upon our dear brother Spencer and his dear wife, the assembly, his family back home. We pray God that you will so use him for the kingdom of God. And Lord, for every counselor, every young person that was here, we pray Lord that the word of God has been in their hearts that they can go that they're not thinking of just a God of yesterday, but as brother Risk brought it to the forefront, a God present. But you're not only a God that's present, you're a God that's living in me. Go with us now. Thank you again, Lord, and pray, Lord, that your blessing will go upon your people as they're dismissed in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. He's been singing is the Now, brothers that are helping with the tent, they need to meet behind the platform here. Any brother that wants to help put down the tent, would you please meet immediately behind here? And those that if you're standing at a chair, which most of you are, apparently they want you to take your chair and take it to the right behind where the um the truck. God bless you all. Everybody take your chair and march.
