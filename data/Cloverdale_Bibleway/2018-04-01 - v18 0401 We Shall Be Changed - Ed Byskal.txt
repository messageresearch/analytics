What a wonderful time to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought to maybe just say the Lord's prayer together. You can put it on the screen. 13:32. Just in prayer this morning getting ready for the service. I thought what a wonderful way to start the morning in one heart, in one mind, and in one accord. How many have a busy life? Okay, who doesn't have a busy life? Maybe we can focus our heart this morning and the Lord Jesus would be pleased to come down and dwell in your temple that you've prepared that you've consecrated. So let's just say the Lord's prayer together this morning. Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen. Amen. Father in heaven, we love you. Father in heaven, we love you. [Music] We lift your name in all the earth. May your kingdom be established in our praises [Music] as your people declare your mighty word. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty. who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who lives forever more singing blessed be blessed be the Lord God Almighty. mighty king who was and is and is to come. Blessed be the Lord God Almighty who lives forever. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. We'll just read a prayer request we have from Sister Sheila. Brother Jeff Wman, would you mind opening the service in a word of prayer? We want to remember Sister Sharon Van Wick. Um they found cancer and she's just recently had surgery. is trusting that the Lord would continue to heal her. Just asking that the congregation would bind their hearts together in prayer for her need and hold her up before the Lord. How many has a need this morning? Truly a needy people. Wouldn't want to get to the place where we have no need, but we want to trust the Lord this morning for each and every need. Brother Jeff, God bless you this morning. Let's bow our heads. Wonderful father, what an awesome privilege it is to come into your house this morning once again, this resurrection morning. Father, you've done so very much for us. When we look back at the time, Lord, when you laid down your life for us, Father, we're so grateful this morning. We come with open hearts, with thanksgiving, Father. We receive whatever you have for us today, Lord. Lord, would you just give us receptive hearts that we could hear that still small voice, Father, and may you come amongst us, Lord, like you did with those that walked to Emmas, oh Father, and speak to us, Lord. And also how you appeared into Mary Magdalene that morning, oh Father. May you come to every one of us individually, oh Father. You have something for us and we want to receive it, Lord Jesus. So we just pray that thy will be done, Father. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as the prayer says. Oh Lord, and we just pray for the needs of every individual in here this morning, oh God. You're a God that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities, Lord Jesus. You were bruised for our iniquities, oh God. And by those stripes, we are healed for that. For our sister Sharon, Lord, that has this cancer, oh Father. We know, Lord, that cancer cannot stand against you, oh Father. That's been a promise that have been given us in this age, Lord. It's a it's a demon and we have the right to come against him. In the name of Jesus Christ, oh Father, we love you and we commit this day to you, oh Father, as we walk along this road together, Father. We ask you now that you would bless the offering, oh Father, as it's being taken up. Bless the giver, Lord, and may you bless the people, Lord, and open their hearts, Father, and may you use it for your kingdom and for your glory. We commit all things to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You may have your seats this morning. Blessed be blessed be [Music] blessed be your name. Blessed be blessed be blessed be your name. You, oh Lord, are a strong and mighty tower, [Music] an ever present help in my darkest hour. You're my hiding place. You're the ancient of days. You're the rock on which I'm standing. You are worthy of my praise. Blessed be. Blessed be. Blessed be your name. Blessed be. Blessed be. Blessed be your name. You, oh Lord, are the deep that I search for. The ever flowing fountain that my heart always searchs for. You're the one who makes me whole. You're the lover of my soul. And whatever comes my way, I know you're in control.

So we'll just have brother Matthew come and get ready. I've got a couple of announcements to make. Uh, one wedding announcement reminder for John Louie Flores and Sarah Garland. Their wedding is on April the 7th, so just a few days away at 100 p.m. here at the church and everyone is invited to both the ceremony and the reception following. So, the reception, I believe, is at 4:00. Well, looking forward to a real wonderful day as I'm sure that they have made lots of preparation. We heard it on Wednesday night. You know, a couple start seeing that look in each other's eye and dad's nudges. Come on, it's time to go. Five more minutes. The bridegroom, our bridegroom, he's made a lot of preparation. &gt;&gt; He went away to prepare a place &gt;&gt; just for you. A lot has gone into it. A lot of thought. Our heavenly father cares very much for each and every one of us. Those that are visiting with us, some that aren't necessarily visitors. We love you very much. For the gym, I bless you. Good to have you here. Your wife and I saw the somebody else I saw back here. The Robinson's family has been reunited. &gt;&gt; Sister Dana, God bless you. Why don't we give sister Dana nice warm welcome? Pat and Gail Venoi from Missoula, Montana. Bridget Wilson and granddaughter of Neil and Subo are all here. Why don't you wave your hands wherever you might be this morning? God bless you this morning. Good to have you here. Amen. Members of the body of Jesus Christ. Wonderful. Anyone else that's visiting? I might have missed you. I apologize. We're certainly happy to have you here in the congregation this morning. Matthew, God bless you. Hear them shout, "Hosana! Our Messiah has come at last." For so long we've been waiting. Now the waiting's in the past. A bright new day is dawning. One we only dreamed we'd know. Our longing souls were losing hope. But not anymore. Now everything has changed. Not anymore. Life will never be the same. We wondered if we'd see the coming kingom of our Lord, but not anymore. Not anymore. [Music] I can't believe it happened. We were there when suddenly there were torches in the garden. There were soldiers with the priest. And now they say for certain that he's been crucified. We thought Jesus would deliver us, but not anymore. Now everything has changed. No, not anymore. Life will never be the same. We dreamed about his kingdom and all it held in store. But not anymore. [Music] Not anymore. more. But now, what's this? I see. The stones been rolled away. Jesus stands before us where he once was in the grave. But not anymore. Now everything has changed. No, not anymore. Life will never be the same. Jesus is alive. I may have questioned that before, but not anymore. [Music] Not anymore. [Music] My heart may once have doubted the power of our Lord, but not anymore. Not any more. [Music] [Applause] Matthew, thank you very much. We appreciate that. This morning, turn the service to our pastor this morning. He lives. He lives. We serve a risen savior. He's in the world today. Ryan, were did you want to sing? Yeah. All right. We'll just sing the first verse of this and maybe Brother Ryan will have his special and we'll turn the service to our pastor. I serve a risen savior. He's in the world today. I know that he is living. Whatever man may say, for I see his hand of mercy, I hear his voice of cheer. And just as I need him, he's always here. For he lives. He lives. Christ Jesus lives today. He walks with me and talks with me along my narrow way. He lives salvation to him. You ask me how I know he lives. lives. He lived within my heart. [Music] God bless you this morning. Romans 5'8 says, "But God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." And in Corinthians, Paul says, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." And this song is called It's Still the Cross. And I just haven't been able to escape it. And I just believe that it's what the Lord wants us to do this morning. So I trust that you'll be blessed by it. It's not conservative or liberal, however they're defined. It's not about interpretation or the judgement of the mind. It's the opposite of politics, power, or prestige. It's about a simple message. And whether we believe, it's still the cross. [Music] It's still the blood of Calary that cleanses sin and sets the captive free. It's still the name, the name of Jesus that has power to save the lost. It's still the cross. [Music] Some may water down theology and preach a word to suit their needs. Some may justify sweet subtleties that are wrapped in noble deeds. Some may alter their convictions to adapt to social whims, but they cannot change the gospel or the truth contained within. It's still the cross. It's still the blood of Calvary that cleanses sin and sets the captives free. It's still the name, the name of Jesus that has power to save the lost. It's still the cross. Though some may say it's man's religion or ancient history, but the cross of Jesus still remains the price for sin that sets us free. It's still the cross. It's still the blood of Calary that cleanses sin and sets the captive free. It's still the name, the name of Jesus that has power to save the lost. It's still the cross. [Music] It's still the cross. [Music] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. [Applause] Let's sing the last two verses of He Lives. As we invite our pastor to come this morning, there's freedom in the house of worship today. In all the world around me, I see his loving care. And though my heart grows weary, I never will despair, I know that he is leading through all the stormy blast. The day of his appearing will come at last. For he lives. He lives. Christ Jesus lives today. He walks with me and talks with me. A long life away. He lays. He lives salvation to him. But you ask me how I know he lives. He lives within my heart. [Music] Rejoice for Christian. Lift up your voice and sing. Eternal hallelujah to Jesus Christ the King. The hope of all who seek him. The help of all who are the so good and kind for he lives. [Applause] Christ Jesus lives today. He walks with me and talks with me along lies their way away. For he laid he laid salvation to him. You ask me how I know he lives. He lives within my heart. All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Happy Easter morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to ask brother uh Derek to help us sing that chorus one more time. He lives. &gt;&gt; And when we say he lives within my heart, I just want to hear it. All right, why don't you stand? We're all standing. Christ Jesus live today. He lost me and I for salvation to him. You ask me how I know he lives. He lives with me. my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He almost made me believe it. He lives within my heart. I do believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we say kind Heavenly Father, Jehovah Gyra, you have provided everything we have need of for our lives, for eternal life, for today, tomorrow, and whatever future we have. You have provided it. You're the great provider. We want to bless your name today. Lord, we want to be a true witness of the true vine. Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, you're worthy of every effort that we can make. And you're worthy of all of our strength and all of our life and energy that we have. You have given us this, Lord, and we thank you for it. We thank you for voices that we can sing and praise and glorify your name, that you are the resurrected Christ. We want to thank you this morning that you have sent a message that is evidence of the resurrection &gt;&gt; Lord and we are living proof of that resurrection. &gt;&gt; Bless now the word and as we approach it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. I have one uh quote I want to put up first and then uh brother John would you come and read this? Okay, we'll have this first quote and I I want you to be able to uh read it with us. I made it as large as possible so you can all read it. Uh, and I just want to emphasize he conquered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That sounds good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The royal seed of Abraham. Now the natural seed could not point to that, but the royal seed can conquer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Already conquered. &gt;&gt; Yes. For he has gone before us and conquered every gate for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is now after 2,000 years. He stands in the midst of us. The mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not only did he conquer sickness, &gt;&gt; he conquered sickness. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He conquered temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to just stop there for a moment. How many of you remember just two weeks ago uh brother Gindo had sent me an email and he said I'd like to have sister Francine and I will come up for prayer. Sister Francine has had leukemia and disease of the bones, a disease of the cancer of the marrow of the bones. And two weeks ago, she stood here. Her count was at 60, which I don't understand all the cell count, the white cell count, I believe it was at 60. And it needed to be around five or six. And in one in and she went immediately after prayer. I don't know just which day, and that's irrelevant, but she went back. brother and sister Gindo sitting here. They went back to the doctor and her count was down to 20. And they said, "But don't say anything yet, so I'm being a good boy. I'm not I'm not going to say anything." They wanted to go once more. And they went once more to the doctor. And Sister Gindo, who you can shake hands with after the service, they said that her blood is perfect. Why don't you stand up, sister Gendo? Here she is. Brother Gendo. Praise God. Praise God. And and not only that, while they're still standing, the white cor uh the white cell count went down to four. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say he's risen. &gt;&gt; He's alive. &gt;&gt; And as the prophet said, and he's with us. &gt;&gt; He's here in the place &gt;&gt; here in this place. And uh uh not only did they say about the blood count, but they said that they they what else was it they said about the marrow, the bones. Uh there was another it was just normal and they want I want to give glory to God. It's one thing to ask, it's another thing to give glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for that testimony. &gt;&gt; And thank you for that faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Jim, Sister Joy, it's good to see you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Have we finished this here? No. I think we we just got He conquered a few things there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He conquered sickness. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; He conquered temptation. &gt;&gt; He conquered every enemy. &gt;&gt; He conquered death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He conquered hell. &gt;&gt; He conquered the grave. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And rose up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And 2,000 years later. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Here he stands among us this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Here he is. &gt;&gt; Identifying himself today. &gt;&gt; The mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's here alive vindicating his promise. Royal seed of Abraham. Oh my. Amen. Thank you, brother John. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Isn't it wonderful? &gt;&gt; Nice to see brother Ed master here with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His wife. God bless you. And all who are visiting. I want to I want to speak on something that will be very natural for this Easter morning. We shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; If you'd like to stand one more time, I'm going to read out of Romans the 12th chapter verses 1 and two. And uh this is the text reading that uh the prophet of God used for his message. The power of transformation. So if you bear that in mind while we read these two verses, the power of transformation and in the service now the message I want to you can take take uh notes if you wish. Now a lot of you have are students or have been students and I would expect you to absorb this as a as a lesson a Sunday school lesson. Now brother Brenham talked about Sunday school lessons and I think he said that he referred to Christ is the mystery of God relieved revealed I think and that's about a threehour service. So we I won't be that long, but I might be over an hour, so just hang on. All right, we've been a long time since we've been studying and preparing. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll read uh Romans the 12th chapter verses 1 and two. I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service, and be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; I'd like to no have you notice with me the second verse and be not conformed. We're not to con be conformed to the world or the influence of the world. And I will be referring to that quite a bit, the influence of things. And then uh but be ye transformed. And it doesn't just say transformed. The prophet said the power of transformation. So the emphasis today is on the power of transformation. Where is that power? And I'll be dwelling on that a bit now. Be transformed. And now he refers to the power by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and perfect, acceptable and perfect will of God. Heavenly Father, I'm praying that you will be the speaker. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost speak. &gt;&gt; You're the only one that can speak to the very soul of the individuals. I pray that you'll be the speaker. &gt;&gt; We know Lord Jesus, you are the resurrected one. &gt;&gt; So I pray by your resurrection power, &gt;&gt; you will speak to the individual life now in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Brother Murphy Wong is going to be speaking tonight and uh we're real happy about that. So, I'm sure you'll hear some things of the most recent trip to China. So, now I want to have you think with me about the power of transformation. Not just transformation, but the power of transformation. It's a change. Transformation is a change. And there are many things in this life and by when I wrote this down I was aware that this would encompass everyone. There isn't anyone who has not experienced some kind of change or transformation and it's a big subject and I hope to touch on a number of areas and then you can go and be thinking about it and pondering it and let God by the Holy Spirit quicken that to you &gt;&gt; and make the transformation that he desires that he desires in your life. And there's various things that he uses and I will touch on those as well. There are many things in life that can and do change or transform us. Uh, education can change a young man or a young woman from a teenager into not not merely an adult because that is something that just happens within the individual, &gt;&gt; but it it can bring a transformation. God is able to bring a transformation into an individual. and not only able but there there's something for us to do and that is to yield and allow it happen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be speaking about uh two or three individuals today and some out of the Bible and some are because they lived the life they lived you are here. I want you to think about that and then I want you to make it personal to yourself. Where's your influence? And how can that change? Education can change. It'll take a young man or a young woman and I'll just say it might turn them into some skilled person. They weren't skilled, but they become skilled. How do they become skilled? Well, they've studied. They've gone to college. They've gone to university. They have got taken classes. And some specialists, I know brain uh brain surgeons can go to school for 12 or 15 years in order because they they they start and perhaps they're very awkward. Uh I I was with the I was with brother Brandham one time and there was a doctor and he was from Washington State somewhere and uh had gotten a bear and so we stopped and he was brother Brandham said, "Well, don't you want to save the skin?" Well, well, yeah. He thought he might want to save the skin and uh but he didn't know anything about hunting. He absolutely nothing nothing about it. and he took out a little uh little knife that uh I think it was one of these, you know, 99 cent all in one things. And and he started hacking at the at the bone and brother Brandham just said to me, he said, "If I ever get sick, he said, "Just remind me not to call him." So, so he wasn't really maybe skilled or as accomplished as he should be, but we can say that what the things they studied and the people who had gone before them had made a way and they become skilled and become uh wonderfully uh a wonderful physician, a wonderful surgeon. But it was not the power that God's talking about. They were transformed but not by this power &gt;&gt; that God is talking about. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I want to fix that in your mind. There's different kinds of power. There are some that are we're we're born we're born as a a male or a female. We're born and and we develop in life. There's there's there's something within us that changes us from childhood. And Apostle Paul says, "When I was a child, &gt;&gt; I spake as a child." He saw things as a child. But when he became a man, he said, "I put away childish things." Not that those childish things were wrong or bad, but he had come to a different season of life &gt;&gt; and uh and he had changed. But that is not necessarily the power. Now that's a power that has been put in you. &gt;&gt; But that's not necessarily the power. And I suggest to you it's not the power that God is talking about when the prophet says the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that now. The power of transformation. Who, where, when, where's this power? Well, we shall all be changed. And often we put put that into the future. But I want to say to you, we are being changed. &gt;&gt; And if the living word of God, which he has sent down and is being spoken, it doesn't it makes no difference what kind of a vessel it comes in. But if we give a due honor and due due respect and we say as far as I'm concerned that's you almighty God. You are the holy one of Israel. &gt;&gt; You're the almighty. You're the creator of heavens and earth. You have spoken. You raised up Jesus from the dead. The tomb is empty. And I when I say he lives, he lives. I know he lives because he's made a change in me. Not just that I quit smoking or quit drinking or those things because we've had a prophet saying that that is not the sin. Those are the attributes of sin. But the the sin is unbelief. But you have almighty God. I don't even know why I believe but I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe what you have sent. I believe what other people disdain and where they're critical about and they care nothing for it. But somehow I believe it. Why do you believe it? Because that's the power that God is speaking about. &gt;&gt; You believe it because you believe it. You may not even explain it. Jesus said he spoke to the disciples. They didn't know why they believed it, but they believed it &gt;&gt; and they couldn't explain it. The prophet says they could not explain it but they believed it. &gt;&gt; I just want to fix that in your heart and in your soul and in your mind. You can believe something that you cannot explain. You can't explain why a bumblebee that is too heavy to fly and his wings are not uh the size that they should be and so on and so forth. Everybody flies very well. Outside of uh outside of our window, we have a hummingbird feeder. &gt;&gt; Those hummingbirds, they come and they drink that uh almost solid. I won't say solid, it's liquid, but it's very, very sweet. When I see my wife make it, I mean, I hate to think I couldn't have that like that. It is so sweet. just sugar and water and they lap that up. But I I and I I do say I said, you know, I think they've used it all up. They come and fly in there at uh their wings beating at at so many times a second and they fly. I mean, they got helicopters beat all hollow. They go forward and forward and backward and whichever way and they'll take it and they're so nervous. I would be too if I had that kind of food. My They just sit there and they're looking all around. They take a lick and then they look around and and then then they leap up and zoom, they're gone. I tell you what, I don't know how many times their wings have to fly when they go up into the tree. But why do they do that? They're hum They're they're hummingbirds. &gt;&gt; We call them our Hummers. &gt;&gt; Boy, they can hum. They just And my wife goes out there and she she'll think about them before she thinks about my breakfast. She'll go out there and she says, "I got to knock the snow off of the railing because I got to get the hummingbird feed." She said, "I think that thing's frozen." So she comes in and thaws it all out and pours fresh in there and goes out there and she'll just give a couple of whistles. Now, my wife's not the world's best whistler, but she gives a couple of little whistles, and they come zooming out of the trees, wherever they come from, and they they know that the hummingbird feeder is fixed, and it's not frozen anymore. Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; What made them like that? I don't know. God made them like that. No one we can figure out and study them for years and we are amazed at their colors. And brother Steve Meyer from Hudson Hope, I mean you you you might say these people are very very near to the earth, but he's told me things and he has his binoculars and he has to look at the birds. He's not interested in a whole lot of sites in Vancouver, but he wants to see the birds. And he was telling me, uh, Brother Tim, that he says these beautiful uh, designs that you see and the colors. He said it takes all of uh, all the feathers, one on top of another to make that color. and the design of one one feather, the other one overlays it and another one overlays it and you need them all in order to make the design of that bird. And I thought that was just so amazing. Here's someone from Hudson Hope is telling me something I didn't learn in school. Hey teachers, you know there's a lot of things we can learn and you just hang on to your seats. I'm going to talk about gifted children in a few minutes. &gt;&gt; That's going to be exciting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One is born with talents or gifts and have a teacher or mentor or coach to identify the ability. Where did the ability come from? You know, I have a a daughter here and she would come and stand beside my bed on my side and I don't know if she did this to her mother, but she did it all the time. And she'd come in her little night gown and be tapping and it was it was like the water dripping on a guy's head. Just tap tap tap tap. Finally, I'd open my eyes. I say, "Yes, Marilyn." And she couldn't say her Rs. I'm letting some secrets out now. But she got that from me. I couldn't say my Rs when I was a kid. And uh so she said, "Yes, Marilyn." I said, "What do you need?" Says, "I need a pencil and a paper." Oh, you need a pencil and a paper. Well, she's always needed a pencil and a paper because that was the artist in her that was coming out when she was three years old, three and a half or four years old. But you know what? She needed some schooling and she needed some teachers when uh when we were in Toronto a few years ago. I'm I'm to talk about a living Christ and uh school teachers and principal called for us to come to the school. My wife went I wasn't able to go and they said something is wrong with this child and we'd like you to give her some brain tests. And so we took her down to specialists and they put 22 wires in her head to take some brain wave tests on our daughter. And one of the specialists said she will need glasses and she will need hearing aids in both ears by the time she's 10 years old. and we took her just exact like brother and sister Gindo and brought her to the front of the service, the West End Revival Center where we attended at that time. And uh that eventually put us out because of the message. But nevertheless, God honors faith. &gt;&gt; He doesn't care where it is. He honors faith. It could be at a well. It could be at a pool. It could be any place. But God will honor faith. God will honor fa your faith today &gt;&gt; in this service. Say, and you may not understand what's being preached, but he he'll honor your faith. &gt;&gt; You need to honor him. &gt;&gt; Say, I believe you're alive. &gt;&gt; And furthermore, I believe that you're here. And furthermore, even though it may not look at I believe that you're speaking to us now over that pulpit, over that piece of wood, I believe you're speaking to us. And I accept it as that. Yeah. and you'll have what you ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to just come to church. We want to see things happening. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we brought her up on a Wednesday night service and had her prayed for and went back to the same specialists and her hearing was perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She's never had hearing aids. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. never had to have th those glasses that they were talking about. And furthermore, we finally got led to a certain specialist and he said, "Nothing wrong with her." He said, "She's amidextrous. It wouldn't matter to her if she started on this side of the page or at the bottom and started working up or whatever. It's all the same." He said, "Have you got her playing the piano?" Yes. All of our daughters are learning piano. He said she can't play the piano. A guitar maybe, but not to coordinate her hands that that way because and so that's just the way it's been. I'll stop there, you know. Uh she'll pick pick up a pair of scissors and use the left hand to cut it and take bread and slice it with the right hand. And I don't understand it. God makes a person a certain way, but then that has to be developed &gt;&gt; and and that is developed and you're here as a believer. Unfortunately or fortunately, those things, the things that you hear, you're not just hearing sermons, folks. You're hearing things that you must take and develop. We we you know Stephen Hawking passed away here a few days ago. It's such a brilliant mind in such a decrepit body as it was. I went and saw him here in Vancouver. I was always interested in things and the universe and so on. And he he he was just way over and beyond. But that didn't happen by accident. He was perhaps you or I can't reach for those kind of things. And so I don't want to just speak of things that's perhaps way beyond you. You might say, "Oh, uh, I could never do that." Well, there was a little woman. My wife was on a bus in Victoria and a woman was getting on the bus and she was, I think, 102 years old. She was going downtown shopping. All women like to shop. Doesn't matter how old they are. she was going down and the bus the bus driver went to help her and he says he started to say I I hope I'm able to do that you know when I'm uh 90 or something and she said young man you don't know what you'll do and that's what I want to say to the congregation here because I'm going to be reading about some outstanding people and you say oh well I you know that was this person that was that person that was the other person, you don't know what you'll do. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do anything that is marvel to the world. You don't have to be some great sports star to the world, but you may be a star. Let let me talk about uh let me talk about gifted children just for a moment because I'm going to take a little while on it. But the children of God are gifted children. There's certain people that actually pack eternal life in them &gt;&gt; and with them. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me they aren't gifted children. &gt;&gt; There are some children that have done a lot of bad things and God has simply said, "You are forgiven." &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that's not a gifted child. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're forgiven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there are some children who've done some bad things who their heavenly father, not the earthly father, he remembers it. And maybe the earthly mother remembers it. But the earthly father says, "And I have not only forgiven you, I have forgotten it." Don't tell me they aren't gifted children. &gt;&gt; But you may need to develop that a little bit. &gt;&gt; You may need to do that. Say, well, the first thing I have to do is confess the same thing. &gt;&gt; And the first thing I have to do is I have to forget also like my father forgot it. I have to forget it. &gt;&gt; I have to move on from here. Can you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Gifted children &gt;&gt; gift that we're born with. You say a career. Well, a career people develop things. They have to develop it. They have to work at it. you that are I I see the kids today, you young people, I see you with your packs sacks and you go home with your books and a big load of books. I often wonder I say that I I'm I'm going to be perfectly honest. I say to my wife, "What in the world are these kids packing in their suitcase? What are they packing in their pack backpack?" I hope that you when you come to school the next day or two, you've got it up here, &gt;&gt; not on your back, &gt;&gt; but up here. It's supposed to be transferred, isn't it? And it's supposed to transfer into your body and so that you're acting different and you do things different. I have I have a brother, very dear brother, friend of mine that's not here. He's from a black brother from Congo. But he saw some of our young people here and we have a different culture perhaps. I don't say it's a good culture. I'm not saying it's better. But he saw kids at the school here. Walk in, open the door, and just walk in. Leave an adult coming in behind them. He stopped and he said to his son who's sitting here said, "Don't you ever don't you ever do that. Don't you ever go in ahead of an adult. You open the door for them because that's what they're taught. You open the door for them and you let them go on." I know when I was a when I was a child, I thought as a child, I did as a child, but when every once in a while I'd get a snap on the side of my head and my dad would want me to wake up. He wanted me to know that I never called anybody by their first name. I'd say Mr. Mr. Dodd, Mr. Andes, or Mr. Something. That's what we did as young people and as children. That was our culture. It's not bad. It's okay. It's it's a kind of respect. But now you know if we get very casual, one thing we want to leave is our casual approach outside because when you come in, oh God, righteous father, I so love your presence and you want to approach it differently. &gt;&gt; You want to approach it respectfully. You know, I was very moved. I've got quite a few scriptures here I'm going to give. Have we all are are we all right for time? &gt;&gt; All right. Brother Bram talks about the little girl. Now, you talk about a gifted child. She's just a little girl, but she couldn't walk right. and she came up and kissed Brother Brandham's coat pocket. And the next day, she didn't need her braces and she walked normally. And Brother Brandham said she was healed. She was healed that day when she just kissed his pocket because she was expressing her respect for the God that was in him. Not him necessarily, but the God. She doesn't know. She just overcome with something. So, she does it. And I have another example of that same thing, but we'll go on. Have I made have I made a point yet? &gt;&gt; Okay. Gifted children, gifts that we were born with. And I read uh not all children excel in academics. Some display creative or artistic uh artistic or musical and leadership abilities. But all of these need to be developed. A gifted child in the Old Testament. There's one. Now, I might need some young people here. Oh, maybe. Who's 8 years old? Do we have a boy eight years old? Anybody eight years old? Nobody in the building 8 years old. Are you 8 years old? Which one? We don't have anybody 8 years old. Well, there's a boy in the Old Testament. He was 8 years old. He was born into royalty. So, well, I I'm I'm not there. Oh, you you don't know. I'm born into royalty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; According to the word of God, according to what I believe in my heart. Said, "Well, have you got a ticket? Have you got a piece of paper?" No, I got something bigger than a piece of paper. I've been born into royalty. You've been born into royalty. This boy was 8 years old when he was born into he was born into royalty. And when he was eight years old, his father had died and he became the king. and his name was Josiah. That's not the end of it. You say that's a gifted child. He was born into royalty. No, no, no. God gave him a heart &gt;&gt; and a and a woman who was a prophetess sent a word to him and said be and God was so angry with Israel and Judah. He said he's going to break things down. and he's going to he's going to turn his back on them and they're going to be destroyed and all of these things. But she sent a message because there was a that boy that was 8 years old when he was either 18. It says in the 18th year, the Bible says in the 18th year, but it might have been the 18th year of his reign, which would make him 26. So it was between 18 and 26, whatever that scripture is referring to. But he was he was going past some place, journeying past some place, and he saw the graves and the tombs of men who were away from God. And he began to clean up Israel, not a house, but all of Israel. He began to clean it up. And he was so determined he dug up the bones of the old priest that led them wrong and crushed those burns to bones to powder and burnt them and cast them out and he cleansed Israel. And uh the priestess the uh prophetess rather she sent word says whoever sent this message to you take a message back to him that God thus sayeth the Lord he will still destroy this place he will still destroy these this worship and all of these things but nevertheless because he had a tender heart towards God these things will not come to pass in his days and he will leave this world in peace. I tell you what, friends. And when he was 18 years old, uh when he was 18 years old, he decided that he would have the Passover. And listen, I I have the scripture here where it speaks of it. It says that there never was a Passover from the time of the judges in the book of Judges. There never was a time all through the years of the judges and all through the years of the kings. Never was there a time where they had a Passover like that Passover. And that's a young fellow 18 to 26 years old, which would include most of you here. say, "Oh, well, he was royalty. He was a king." No, no, no, no. I won't accept that. &gt;&gt; You're royalty also. &gt;&gt; And the thing is, he just decided something needed to be done and he was going to do it. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends. I'm not just because I'm up here preaching. You've heard it many times about the message that God gave you, that God sent this generation. God has sent a message to this generation that your fathers did not have. And just a few years ago, they didn't have it, but we're too occupied &gt;&gt; with too many things. My education. What do you mean your education? Where's it going to go? What's it going to do for you? &gt;&gt; I'm not opposed to it. Not a bit. Not a bit. And we've got school teachers. We built a school here. But I can tell you one thing. I know that you have devotion at the school. But one thing you could have which is a lot better which is a very important integral part of your studies would be to study what a prophet of God has said about this age and believe it &gt;&gt; and determine that uh I'm not only here to learn to be a a pilot or to be whatever but I'm also learning to be a a witness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You shall receive power." &gt;&gt; That's the kind of power he's talking about. And you shall be witnesses unto me. &gt;&gt; Not witnesses unto a church or just a way of belief or or someone else, but you'll be a witness to me &gt;&gt; whether you believe it or not. I'm going to speak it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a gifted child. Josiah was a gifted child. You say, "Well," and I knew while I was studying that people are people are inclined to, "Oh, just put that off someplace." Oh, that's We've got some people in the world that are gifted in sports. And I read about them and I've I've heard of of them how they get up in the morning and go I have a cousin. She lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and it it'd be so cold there, 30° below zero or whatever more. But she had to take her boys to hockey. and she she had five sons, I think two sets of twins, and she would go to hockey. She told me that I would leave the car running outside because in the middle of the night just so she could put bring some home, get them to bed, and then she had to get up early in the wee hours of the morning and get the others out of bed and take them to hockey training. I don't know. Did they become stars? I don't know. I doubt it. I don't imagine. But that's what she did as a mother. She put all that effort and all that into them and they did all of that practice and everything else. Well, I will say this. It would be a lot better to have put it into the gospel somehow. &gt;&gt; I would like a amen out of this congregation. &gt;&gt; I thought of you, brother Matthew. I thought of the uh the Daz I think Michael or was it Michael went to you went to Turkey with all right with brother Mark Alo you know there's nothing wrong with putting a shell in the bullet or a bullet in the gun and it doesn't fire there's nothing wrong with trying to do things I have tried to do things I've put a lot of emphasis on people and some of it uh they you know maybe really became uh something and others perhaps let it go. But on the other hand it doesn't it doesn't hinder uh us to live the life that others can look to and be influenced by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was another gifted child and he was seven or eight years old. He was carrying water in two syrup buckets. And that's not so long ago. He was carrying water to his father's still. He was making alcohol. Now, that's not a very respectable thing perhaps for a a churchgoing boy, but his parents were Catholic and they were not religious, he said. And he's carrying water. You'd say, "What kind of training is that?" Carrying water to his father's still. And it's a quiet day. And uh there's a popular tree and uh leaves start to move. Listen friends, I'm going to tell you something that you have not heard. And that boy heard a voice in the tree said, "Don't drink or smoke or defile your body in any way. When you're older, I have a work for you to do." Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that he's not a gifted child, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who knew he was a gifted child? &gt;&gt; A teacher who could teach him knew he was a gifted child. I'm going to take you and use you. How do you know who you are? You may be here visiting, but God knew you'd be here in this service. And he wanted you to hear what I am saying to this congregation and to those that are streaming. We don't know. Yes, we've got to be, you know, we've got to be plumbers and carpenters and mothers and whatever more. We've got to be that. We But you don't know who's looking at you and you don't know who who you're affecting. You are affecting and influencing somebody. &gt;&gt; And how do you know who he who keeps the books? &gt;&gt; And the Bible says this, it's required of a servant that he be found faithful. &gt;&gt; Doesn't doesn't say you got to be successful. &gt;&gt; So you got to be found faithful. The world is so inclined to push and push and push people almost over the edge. You know, they've got to be successful and they've got to meet certain budgets and they've got to meet certain uh certain levels of uh they've got to attain certain things. But I say one thing. If you can come before God and you can just kneel and say, "I did my very best for you. &gt;&gt; I talked I taught my children. I was a mother." I said to my wife the other day, maybe she doesn't feel she had a high IQ. But she says, "How do you know about an IQ? So many things I didn't learn." And I've never worked. She worked before I was married to her. She was a legal steno for two lawyers, but she never carried on with that because we got married. And I said, "What kind of value do you have?" Who has attained to motherhood? You've attained to motherhood. You've been mother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And from somehow, for some reason, I know nothing about it, but almighty God saw that your daughters would be here with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you would worship with them. &gt;&gt; Where do we put the value? How do we evaluate these things? &gt;&gt; Is that a gifted child or is not gifted? It makes no difference because at the end of the road, you want him. You want to hear him say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." Doesn't matter whether we just ho the field or ho the potatoes or the garden or whatever, but we were faithful to the call of God in our lives and faithful to our place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It may be nothing more than sitting in the house of God and you're always here and you sit in the house of God and you always are testifying that what I believe and a this message I believe in and this person I believe in is something that's divine &gt;&gt; and respected as such. &gt;&gt; Now I'm just started. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? I'm not going to drag this out. I'll be watching my time. And this young person who I said was bringing his his father, alcoholic father, water for his still. He also stood in the motel room with me and now you're looking at the person and he said, "Brother Eddie," he said, "if you asked me what I would sooner have five minutes with my daddy or have gold bricks stacked from the floor to the ceiling of this room." He said, "I would sooner have five minutes with my daddy." &gt;&gt; And yet, I don't know about his father. I don't know. I know that he was an alcoholic. And maybe maybe the prophet prayed with him, I believe, before he passed away. But this is what I said I would tell you so you won't have to remind me. When brother Brandham was a young man, like you young men here, he went with a young girl, he calls it his girlfriend. Brother Brandham has this picture taken with her daddy. It's actually on the internet, and I'm sure that many don't know, but he went with a young lady, and that young lady was the one who tried to get him to smoke. And Sister Biscll and I were in Florida and the pastor of the church said, "Would you like to meet Brother Brennan's girlfriend?" I said, "I certainly would." He said, "Well, we'll go and get her." And a short time later in came a elderly woman and we sat with her and faced her. I said, "Did you did you know that brother Brandham was a prophet of God?" "No." She said, "We didn't." And maybe that's why you're here. She said he did tell us that he that he'd hear voices in the trees that would speak to him. And I said, "Well, would you like to receive Jesus Christ?" "Yes," she said, "I would." I said, "I'll pray with you." One of the great one of the great events of my life was able to lead her &gt;&gt; to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought right away of the words, "All that I loved &gt;&gt; and all that loved me." &gt;&gt; And she opened up her purse and took out a picture. has a picture of Brother Brandham in a heart in a heart piece of like showboard small like that. And she held it in her hands and she looked past my head, looked over me, looking into some distant place and said, "I still love him." &gt;&gt; I thought that was remarkable. and she wanted to come to the service that evening and be prayed for for some physical ailment as well. and and I think she's gone now, but I had a picture I have a picture of her father and I thought that he was uh I thought that he was brother u who's that brother Brandham talked about the old brother that always was with him. &gt;&gt; Bosworth Bosworth Yes. I thought it was brother Bosworth but it turned out to be her dad. Now he went with this girl but that gift and he brother Brown tells about he came back and he says his girl was smoking and she told me while I sat there she said I tried to get him to smoke. She's just confirming the message. &gt;&gt; I tried to get him to smoke, but she said he wouldn't. And then we moved to Arizona and he followed us to Arizona. Now, friends, I'm telling you this just because it's necessary for you to let brother Brandham be a man. Also, &gt;&gt; don't elevate it to some place that don't elevate. You can't elevate it more than God did. &gt;&gt; He was the messenger to the age. &gt;&gt; And no one else can take that place. God gave him the highest position of anyone that walked on the face of the earth, I would say, since Jesus. There are other great people. But from Genesis 1 and two to Easter Sunday 2018, a bride formed out of this churning mass. We could study this mass of darkness which you have to live amongst and that won't do anything for us. But when you realize that the one I'm speaking of, God picked you out of this churning mass and said, "You are going to be a part of my body." &gt;&gt; You furthermore are going to be part of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There isn't another person on the earth that can give you that place. Amen. &gt;&gt; God himself. &gt;&gt; Am I preaching over your head? &gt;&gt; Am I making it too exotic? No, I don't think so. I'm saying you talk about gifted people. &gt;&gt; And you hear a lot of messages over this pulpit of telling you who you are. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. You may not you may not make a big mark in the world, but I will say one thing. If you just live solidly for Jesus Christ, you make a mark wherever you are &gt;&gt; in this world and you have been a success. You have been you will hear the words. And I'm going to say over this pulpit, you will hear the words, well done. &gt;&gt; You might say, well, when was it? When did I feed the poor? When did I do this? When? You don't know when you're doing it. &gt;&gt; Somebody may be looking at you, watching you during the week and you're influencing someone. Then I now I I thought I was a fearful that I might This is brother Tim. what I was talking about. When a person gives themselves to God and they're in their place, they may just be a mother or a father doing dishes or whatever more and influencing another life into the right pathway, the pathway of God. Is that the power of God or is it the power of man? I say it's the power of God. &gt;&gt; And that person gives themselves and surrenders themselves under the correct life example that God placed in front of them. Then that person is receiving the gift of God. and they are a gifted person that they even have a a a sense to accept that and receive that &gt;&gt; as Charles uh Wesley's father said on his deathbed I believe it was he said it's the inner witness son the inner witness you might say well that wasn't a great sermon it's not great sermons that get great people. &gt;&gt; It's simple things that have been said to them. It's the inner witness. And I want to say to you, friends are here. You might be enticed a certain direction or to make a a decision that isn't exactly correct, but it's the inner witness. And if you listen to your heart, the Holy Spirit is faithful to tell us what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham refers to Genesis the first chapter. Excuse me, I want to hurry along here. And he says the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. We realize that the water and he said the Bible said in the beginning back there uh that that this the world was without form and void and was void. There was nothing but just a darkness of chaos. And while I read that I I said to myself, that's where we're at. This mass of humanity that crawls over the face of the earth over 7 billion people is nothing but a mass of chaos. &gt;&gt; People are lost. They don't know where they're going. &gt;&gt; They'll reach at this and reach at that. And Satan has has sent and he has used all the technology that he has derived from the tree of knowledge. And he sends all of his perversion throughout all the world. Friends, we're here in a church, but we're not to act like saints. That that doesn't touch us. You know that you see it. You know that you hear it. It's in the magazines. It's in the newspaper. It's on the radio. And wherever you are, you see it on the streets. People are lost. &gt;&gt; And they talk about this crisis and that crisis. Who created the crisis? Where did it come from? The opiad opiad crisis and all that drug addiction and the hundreds that have died here in We don't have to talk about hell. We're talking about it right here in our city. This city of Vancouver, one of the worst spots in the country. What is it? It's a mass of darkness. a a mass of lost darkness as the prophet said of of the earth that we're standing on. This earth was nothing but a mass loss of darkness spinning off into space until until it came under the influence of the word of God. Listen, you're sitting here today and you are under the influence of the spoken word of almighty God and you are being changed. You are being transformed by that word and made into sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; In fact is when we take on we hear of the change of the body. When you take on the change of the body that'll be a very small step. &gt;&gt; The last step's a very small step. The rest of it is now. Now we're being changed. Now we're being transformed. Now we're under the influence of the power of transformation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the prophet of God has just made us aware of it. What is happening? I can tell you that this message is the power of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the transforming &gt;&gt; of you as an individual. Give yourself to it. I don't have any &gt;&gt; I don't have any apology for that. He said, "And what a horrible shape it must have been in. Nothing but way into the darkness yonder without light or anything. You can say that was me. &gt;&gt; That was me. I was out there. I was out in the darkness just uh not knowing where I was going, not knowing why I was here. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the churning of the water and that wandering star twisted around and around the orbits out there somewhere. It must have been a terrifying terrific mass of something lost like it was. couldn't find its way. And now he said this, I've highlighted it. And that's what we become when we become wandering stars away from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just without hope, without God, without just a churning around out in the darkness, not knowing when and where we're going. I want to announce to you, I'm not just caught in the emotion of this moment. I want to announce to you this God. This God, this holy one of Israel, this holy God that created all things, gave you life, knew who your mother and father were going to be, has brought you here, but he called you for a divine purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a gifted child. &gt;&gt; You'll need to recognize that to get the rest of my message. &gt;&gt; I want to speak about another gifted child. I got a picture of him here. You don't know his name, but I'll give you his name and you'll know him right away. Hudson Taylor. How many here have ever heard of Hudson Taylor? Hold your hand up high, please. The rest of you, I'm introducing him to you. This is Hudson Taylor. This is somewhere between the boy carrying the two little buckets of water syrup pales to his father's whiskey still. This man here, Hudson Taylor, when he was 17. Who's 17? Is there anybody 17? Stand up. You'll be a good one to stand up. Abraham. &gt;&gt; Abraham Wong. I don't know if Hudson Taylor had a daddy like you have. Thank you, Abraham. He was your age when he decided he was 17 years old when he decided he needed to go to China. He arrived in Shanghai, China, when he was about 20 or 21. He spent 51 years in China. He went there 11 times. He learned Greek, Latin, Mandarin. He translated the Bible also best that he could and I have nothing to say about that. He labored incredibly was very sick and had to come back. And about the same time there was another gifted child and I will I doubt that you know much about him. His name was CT Stud. But he was a star. He was a sports star. He played on a national team for cricket in England. His father was a wealthy wealthy man. He was what was called a country gentleman. Had a large estate with raceh horses and this kind of thing. And when he gave himself, listen friends, he wasn't born there. He committed himself to god's direction and to listen to God's voice. and he just became consumed with the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of earth. I want to move you from the kingdom of this world. It's all destiny for ashes. &gt;&gt; Don't give your life for ashes. &gt;&gt; You're worth something more than ashes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory &gt;&gt; preacher. &gt;&gt; He also was a gifted child, gifted by this world's standards. He went to the fine college and his father was a wealthy man. His father died and left him all his wealth. You know what he did? He gave it all away. He just gave it away. That's what he felt to do. And you if you read some of the proverbs of of CT stud, it'll sting you. These are not men of the ancient past. These are not men of the Old Testament. These are men in a generation just a generation or two ago. In fact, these are men both Hudson Taylor and CT stud are men of the generation just past which brother Brandham called the age of the open door. And they were obsessed with the spirit that was on them for that age. We can't replicate or duplicate that. We're called perhaps for something else. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you see burdened someone's burdened, that is why perhaps I am so attracted not with admiration to brother Murphy. I see a man that travels. I see a man that gives his life. The least we can do, the very least we can do is pray. Amen. The &gt;&gt; very least we can do is pray and give. &gt;&gt; What we do in this life won't amount to a whole lot. And I can I can tell you this now because I faced the other side. I know what I'm talking about. And I have received letters that I didn't know. I don't know the people yet I one I have met as a young man but I have received letters that said we stream the services of Cloverdale Bible way and our confidence he says what you do there I and a number of churches he's a pastor he said a number of churches here in South Africa if we see you do it we do the same thing if you start doing something we do that that didn't make me feel great. I was thankful but I want to say this to you friends. It's just wonderful if you can say father or friend your footsteps have have inclined mine and I have been moved. I'm very very attached to the one that you have given yourself to. I've given myself. I see that it's worthwhile. And I want to say something to this congregation. And perhaps that might not register with everybody, but I want to say to everybody in this congregation and those of you that are on the on the internet, if you want the blessing of God, find out what God has blessed. If you want the blessing of God, and I was not a very smart person, but I began to realize that God was blessing this message. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He had sent his word. &gt;&gt; And and I cannot tell you, you may sit here and listen to me, friends, but I want you to absorb this. Please absorb this. God when he sent out his word and he knew that he was going to take that churning mass of darkness and bring it into a a beautiful Eden and the prophet speaks about and bring it into that kind of life. Now he sees a mass of billions of people in such idolatry and such darkness. But he's going to send out his word and tell his spirit &gt;&gt; and send his spirit you're going to brood over these people. I have my sons and daughters are out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. and you must find them and you must brood over them and they're going to come. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me that the one who's given his life to be a witness to be a testimony to to these people and we don't know who they are. Might be your neighbor. It might be someone across the sea. I don't know who they are. Brother Tim, Brother John. That's why we preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've told you here before, but I'll tell it once again. &gt;&gt; And I have to admit and confess that I was I have been all my life from a young man in my late teens. I had a phrase that my wife said, I didn't hear it from other and I can tell you I didn't learn it in school. I didn't learn it from my peers. I didn't learn it. But I remember saying it. I just said, "I just love the word of God." &gt;&gt; It would speak to me. And I'd see myself. I was just an average almost like a homeless guy. I just see I I I I felt connected with those people. I felt and as I heard now brother Brandham say just stand on the side of the path. See where you'd stand when the Lord Jesus was here. Friends, the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head. He knows what the darkness and mass is. And he sent his spirit out and his spirit is under a commission. Find them, &gt;&gt; brood over them &gt;&gt; until you bring them out of the darkness and shape them &gt;&gt; and mold them &gt;&gt; into a bride. &gt;&gt; Mold them into this kind of a life. &gt;&gt; And friends, that's exactly what's happening. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what's taking place. And I want to say to you without any hesitation, you're a gifted person. &gt;&gt; Almighty God, who could have had the stars, could have had some glorious thing, but he said, "No, I want a family. &gt;&gt; I want a family, and I'm going to I'm going to predestinate. I'm going to ordain how they even come and they'll come. There's a certain part of me, a certain reflection, a certain way. I want to be seen. I want to be felt. And friends, friends, that's why we get moved by certain things. We get affected by certain things. And we are here for one purpose, to affect the people godly. But I have been obsessed all my life. If this message could answer the questions that were in my heart, somebody else has to hear it. Somebody else has the same question. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you think that is too is that being too severe? &gt;&gt; I I think it's try. Someone else has the same question. It's 12:30, so I'm going to close right away. You might say, "Well, you've talked for over an hour now. What do I actually do when I leave these doors?" Well, I'll tell you what to do. I'll tell you what to do because the Bible which we read tell us what to do. Our minds need to be renewed. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. We can't put that off in someone else. You have a mind. &gt;&gt; We have a mind. You have some thoughts. And I don't care what you think about the preaching. We're not interested in the style of preaching right now. And we're not we're we're interested in what God has said in his word. Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. That's not some idol words. Those are true words. Those are sent to certain people. &gt;&gt; This man who we had up on the screen, &gt;&gt; he arrived, I'd see I had it here. If I can't find it. Yes. Hudson Taylor. He spent 51 years in China. The society that he began with respons was responsible for bringing over 800 missionaries to China who began 125 schools and directly resulted in 18,000 Christian conversions as well as the establishment of more than 300 stations of work and with more than 500 local helpers in all 18 provinces. That was that man. And CT Stud met him over in China and became involved went to India and then finally went to Congo and he died in the Belgian Congo for you people that are here from the Congo. CT Stud who was very very close would say well these men have done incredible things you don't know what we do you don't know what you have done you know I look personally I look my daughters have had an effect on me. People of the church have had an effect on me. Sometime the person who might feel they are the least in the in the body of Christ have had an effect on me. I believe that I want to believe that we were able to have an effect and and if I was able to even have a that's why friends please I hope I just can make it clear to you I wasn't expecting to do some great thing in front of in front of William Brandham to make him admire us whatever more. No, no, that wasn't it. It was like the woman in the Bible. And she had such an effect upon Elijah or Elisha. Elijah, I believe it was. She had such an effect. Hey, she's just a woman. She's looking after the house. She's saying to her husband, "Can't we have a place? This is a holy man of God." Now, he didn't come and announce to her he was holy. He didn't come announce her he was a prophet. He just said, "Couldn't we have a place where he can rest? I see him going by here." And so, she has a place. Yeah, I'll maybe tell you. We had a radio broadcast that covered all of United States, big parts of Canada and southern part of Africa in an area inhabited by 87 million people. We got a letter here to Cloverdale Bible Way and the letter said, "We can no longer handle your broadcast." And Brother Roger Smith, who was with us at that time and was announcing and doing a lot of the ministerial work, he said, "What shall we do?" And I said, "Well, just wait till I get back and I'll go and see him." So I went and saw the young man. He actually had been a minister's son who was running a company and he started out called Christian Ministries. And he said now he'd become a multi-millionaire and a very wealthy man himself. So he said we have to in a letter we have to dis discont continue your broadcast. It wasn't mean we would be off the air but he wouldn't handle it anymore. And so I got into the into his office and now an office where he was only sharing a girl about three years before. Now he's got a great big staff and I had to wait. They said well you have to wait for a little while. He's going to be he's on the phone with Jimmy Swagert. So I was on the phone. I was not on the phone. I'm sorry. I sat down and waited for him. I waited about an hour and a half and finally I got into his office. Lovely, beautiful furniture, nicer than anything here. So I sat down, said, "I'm sorry, Brother Ed." He always called me Brother Ed. said, "I'm sorry that I was on the phone with Jimmy Swagert." And I said, "Well," I said, "I just received a letter from you from Christian Ministries in Bellingham." And he he bowed his head and he shook his head. Oh. He said, "I'm so sorry." He said, "I'm so sorry that I had to send that to you." And he said, "I I'll just share something with you that no one really knows. My family doesn't know." But he said, "I'm driving down I5 and everything just goes black and I go blind from pain in my body and I pull off. I had enough presence of mind to pull off." And he said, "And uh I was under extreme exhaustion." and they took me into the hospital and the hospital told me uh you've got to cancel some of your work and he said and I was given a I was given a criteria and you fell under that and uh so he said that's why I sent that to you. I said, 'N no, that's fine. That's fine, Michael. His name was Michael. I said, 'Th That's fine, Michael. I said, I just want to give you a testimony. I said, some years ago, I became aware that Brother Brandham was a great man of God. That's all I knew. And I wanted to give him a place where he could go and have a rest. And I thought northern British Columbia. It wasn't a bed now. It wasn't a b p a picture of water. It was just a place where he could rest. I said I and so I invited him and he came and this is what happened. And I told him the whole story. And I said he came up there and and and then I said then we wanted to get his message or the message that God had sent. We wanted to get it into the local area. You came and actually visited us. You said you'd like to handle that broadcast. I said, "I know that your father years later now, a few years. You listen to he listened to our broadcast before it even went out to the people. Some of our people would come in here and hear hear Brother Bam's voice when the door was closed. and he's listening to it. Yes. He said, "That's right." I said, "We we we didn't know. Perhaps you don't know like we do now." I said, "That that was Elijah. That was a spirit of Elijah. God had sent it down as a messenger with a message in this time." I said, "You didn't know it, but and we didn't know it." I said, "And I just wanted to give him a rest." I said, ' And from that time, and then you took the broadcast when others wouldn't have it, you took it. And I said, I believe at that time your business just went like this. He said, that's exactly right. And furthermore, he said, we're going to keep your broadcast. And they kept it right to the very end. Now, I'm giving you some testimony. These aren't just hearsay stories, friends. This this is what happened. And if I'm not here in a year or two, whatever God gives me time, if I'm here, I will be saying the same thing. But I just decided there were things you needed to hear. &gt;&gt; You need to believe. &gt;&gt; You need to take a hold of it. I hear these other brothers preaching, preaching their hearts out, telling the people who they are. &gt;&gt; Who they are in Christ. &gt;&gt; It's not up to us just to sit back and say, "Well, that's nice." No. Give yourself to it. &gt;&gt; Yield to it. &gt;&gt; Even if you get up out of this service today, excuse me, and say, "One thing I will do. I'll commit myself to be a message to be a witness to this glorious message. &gt;&gt; Whether it's here, whether it's just to our friends, whether it's just to the girls in the school or the fellas in the school, I'll give myself to it. &gt;&gt; I'll speak of it wherever I have an opportunity. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can at the house of God. I'll do what I can for the gospel of Jesus Christ because this message is worth everything that I have. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? I hadn't intended on spending the whole time on this gifted children, but I think it's very very important. I want to close with this one quote. Brother Brandham says this and I want to take it I want you to take it to your heart and this is not personal but he says I'm old now. I'm not like I'm not young like you all. And he says and he was talking about he had to take notes now where he in previous life he didn't have to take notes and he said uh but he said I did that I do that I've been through many hard battles he said and and he said and I've done that to bring you where you are today. And he says, "And that's the way it is. We make we make a way for one another." &gt;&gt; And he says, "And then there were some that went ahead of me and made the way for me." &gt;&gt; He says, "And that's the way it is. That's God's plan. We make a way for one another." I want to say to this congregation, to these people, and to all that are here, we have a divine commission. &gt;&gt; I don't say that because I'm up here preaching. I say that because I've spent my life at it. These men have spent their life at it. The prophet of God spent his life at it, &gt;&gt; and it's worthy of our effort. and you in your home, just find a way that you maybe can get it across if it's as simple as leaving a message book someplace, &gt;&gt; leave it lay there. &gt;&gt; How do you know somebody might not pick it up &gt;&gt; and read something that will speak to their soul? And this is almighty God sending his spirit and directing people and creating a hunger in one. And then he find a a message book laying there. Lay find the word of God laying there. Read of some man of God and affected his life. And you don't have to read about them. They're here. They're sitting with you in this congregation. &gt;&gt; We are we are making a way for one another. And God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say to brother Murphy, he's influenced my life. You might never have an opportunity, but this is what I spend my time doing. You're influencing somebody and somebody's influencing you. And this is what brother Brandham said about influence. He said uh and God told Balum and he was a prophet first he told him don't go down but the influence of those other men caused him to go to do it contrary to the way of God. I'm just leaving that with you. &gt;&gt; It's all right to hear what other people have to say, but you don't let what the others have said to con to influence you to go another direction. That's good for everybody, young, old, or whoever, contrary to what God said. And then he said this little five senses that we all have you have. He said that's just a little world of our own but God he said that we was only given so we could contact our earthly home. But there are senses beyond that &gt;&gt; another dimension. And God is always present. &gt;&gt; Now just listen real close. This God we're talking about, the God that spoke to Lazarus, he's always present. Is Brother Brandham telling a lie? No, I don't think so. In this building tonight, he said, and I'll say in this building now today stands Jesus Christ. In this building is hosts of angels, &gt;&gt; thousands of them &gt;&gt; gathered around. You don't see them, but you can feel the influence of them &gt;&gt; telling you that they are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may not feel it at this moment, but perhaps during the service or maybe while we were worshiping, you feel some uh super sense. Something comes and begins to well up within you. &gt;&gt; You might not know what it is, but I'm here to tell you it's the influence of angels &gt;&gt; from another realm, from another world, from another dimension. trying to tell you &gt;&gt; and make you conscious. We are here. &gt;&gt; God is here. &gt;&gt; The one we worship is here. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is here. He said, "And when this influence of the Holy Ghost, you may not feel it, you may not sense it, you may not know." Now, I've been quite a long time in this service, but when this influence of the Holy Ghost, I want to tell you what he does. The influence of the Holy Ghost struck them. It filled them and they seen the word that Jesus promised and fulfilled. I'm I'm standing here today as a witness. When I was a child, when I was a young fellow, the age of you guys, I wanted to be a a lawyer. My dad thought I should be maybe a doctor or something or a lawyer. I'm not I'm not proud of it. I had to drop out when I was in grade 10. In grade nine, my father decided to move from northern Canada down here. I was his son. I was just doing what sons do. My sister had already gotten married. I was 14. I don't know what you're doing when you're 14. I was just 14. Just following along with the events of life. It wasn't all all good. I was raised up in a very very cold area. I'm witnessing to you now. I'm telling you a witness. And my father stopped in a certain town over here about 250 300 miles away called Vernon, BC. And people were gathering from all over and gathering to the arena. And so we went to the doors to get a seat there. and it was packed with people and that's when I was 14. I that was the first time I saw brother Brandham come on the platform and a man from Vancouver was his manager Ern Baxter and Ern Baxter came up and I'll never forget it. He said now when brother Brandham comes out he will not pray for anybody until the angel of the Lord is here at the platform. I thought, "Wow, I've heard about angels. I've heard about him in church. Am I I'm going to see a man that's talked to an angel?" I thought I was way up in the balconies. I'm saying something I haven't said before. I was up there with Billy Paul. I was up there with some other kids that were about 14, 15. And we were just rambling, just teenagers. I wasn't very good in school, but I consider myself, and I'm saying this for the first time, I'm considering myself a gifted child because something gave a desire in me &gt;&gt; to leave the gang and come down and sit. right about where Amy is on the on the edge of the aisle. I don't know how I got that chair. People were offering money, I suppose, for the chairs. They couldn't get a chair, but I got a chair. And I sat there and I thought, I'm going to see a man. Let's talk to an angel. And out came brother Brandham. And that's the night I saw a blind girl healed, which I never forget. And then years later, you know, we're just doing what comes naturally. And I end up being a preacher, end up preaching perhaps like Michael Mike Andes. Just started preaching. I just thought, you know, the word of God would speak to me. And I still remember some of those early messages that I spoke. I spoke on if he'd known if he'd only known and what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and not have his house broken up. I spoke that. But during in the midst of all of that and now I'm going to come home where you are. There's people that said, "Well, the message says this here and it says something else over there, and we don't know exactly what it says." That's not new. That's why I said that's that's that's just old stuff. I can tell you where the Bible says this over here and says that over there. I say Jesus said go and teach all nations and baptize them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost. And then Peter went and baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus. So it was a big question. Hey, these weren't bunch of dummies. They were honest people and I had preachers and and they would argue and back and forth and I just didn't like to argue. They said, "How are you going to be baptized?" So years later, I want to know this man who came out on the platform in Vernon when I was 14. Now I'm 27. So 10, 12, 13 years have gone by. Is he still the same? How is he baptized? And the big question was, is the angel still here with him? That one who said the angel of the Lord, I believed in that angel. I believed in that pillar of fire. I believed in that with all my heart. Is that all right if I give you this testimony? &gt;&gt; I'm just finished with it just now. So I thought now, now we come right up to our time. A few years ago, I wondered, is that angel still with him? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I'll take him up for a rest, but I wondered, is the angel still with him? If the angel isn't there, I've got a big problem. And now I've talked to the native Indian people about him. I've talked to all about these things that have happened in the supernatural and the evidence of the resurrection. Is he still there? If it's not there, I'm in a real fix. So, I went up and that's why, friends, it means so much to me. And we're out in the wilderness, way out, the total wilderness. Now I'm I'm I'm just going to be a couple minutes yet. And I I was just turning inside. That mass of darkness was inside cuz I didn't have an answer to some things. I preached. Yeah. I played the guitar. We sang. We had services. People came. They were happy. They shook our hand. I know what church is. &gt;&gt; I know what church is. &gt;&gt; I know that people can enjoy it and have a wonderful time. Listen to me, my dear friends. &gt;&gt; My precious young fellas. I'm speaking to you right out of my soul. We're not here to create a church for you. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to create a church atmosphere. We're here to tell you this is a living message. And if it's not, I want to leave the scene and be gone out of here. But this is a living message. And so here I am now. And I'm wondering, is the angel still there? So I'm at 27 and I'm up in the mountains. And he says these words that I never forgot. I I never forgot when he would say just little things. Maybe you remember this. He put up his hand and I it just was such a remarkable thing to me. Said he's here &gt;&gt; and now I take every spirit here under my control. That to me seemed like such an outstanding thing. He's here. &gt;&gt; And that those words just were anchored, brother Roy, in my heart. And so here we are. We're just doing what we always do. We're just hunting. I got my gun over the shoulder. We're just doing what we always do. We live up in the north and we This is what we do. We just live there. I tie my moccasins a certain way and just, you know, just wear regular clothes. I'm like the woman going to the well, &gt;&gt; but I've got huge questions inside and they're not answerable. No man, I have wonderful ministers and I respect them, but no one can convince me it should be this way or it should be that way or the Godhead or the baptism. And the serpent sat didn't want to talk about it. Now, I'm telling you my testimony because I have your ear and I have this privilege and I'm going to close right away. And he said, "So, we're having this little walk. I'm trying to give him a little rest, but the one that is speaking through him wants to answer my questions." &gt;&gt; You know how long I've wrestled with these questions? probably 10 years. 10 years God let me wrestle with them. 10 years God let me be out in a kind of a wilderness. 10 years. You might say, "Well, I got questions." Forget it. The God you claim and the God you're worshiping, he knows about that. &gt;&gt; And he'll answer that in his time. He doesn't go on our time. He goes on his own time. &gt;&gt; He'll answer your question. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ask it and hold it honestly before God. He'll answer it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; He will answer it. &gt;&gt; You have questions. Your question might be, "Is this true?" He'll tell you it's true or not. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, we're sitting on a log. That's why it means so much to me. And I mention it every once in a while. And he said, he said, "I believe I was riding on my I was riding on my horse on this mountain over here." And he says, "He came to me there." Soon as he said he came to me there, I just turned my head, looked at him right in his eyes. Brother Nathan, his eyes were deep set. His countenance had changed a bit. I just looked at him and he looked at me. Said, "I believe you have three questions you want to ask me." If he said four, I wouldn't be here. I believe you have three questions you ought to ask me. And they were stacked in my heart in a certain order. The first one was the godhead and the second one was a baptism and the third one was the serpent seed. And he he named those three like that. What was God doing? He was sending his word to a darkened, confused mass. And when I say tonight or just today, it was a chaotic mass when he spoke to the world. And on the weekend, I said during the week I was studying, I said, "We are that mass. I live amongst that. That's here in the world. It's all over the place. &gt;&gt; We live in it." I said, "God, help the people this morning. help them &gt;&gt; that they might know that their God is not the author of the mass. He speaks to it. &gt;&gt; And don't worry about it, friends. Whatever you do, don't worry about it. He knows exactly how to bring and he's going to bring a beauty. Fact is, I don't have the time. I'd love to be able to take the time, but it's a he's speaking to it with an intent. I'm going to form this and not just answer the questions. I'm going to form this into the beauty of a bride that is my bride. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you here, he knows how to answer questions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll pray. Heavenly Father, you're so kind. You're so kind. You help us in these moments, Lord, as I seek, oh God, just to give myself and give parts of my life. As you sent your messenger, you did not prevent him from his sorrows. You did not prevent him to live without any problem, without any trouble. Oh God, I think of how you allowed him even to see his little daughter die and not not deliver her from her sickness when you would knew that you would send that man to pray for a multitudes of people and he would do so. I pray father you'll take these words feeble as they may be you'll take these words and cause have caused me as I spoke to you today and said you Holy Spirit be the speaker be the one that says something to the souls of the people in Jesus name.
