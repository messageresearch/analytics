[0:00] but then I'm not a doctor I know nothing
[0:02] about medicine or operations I honor and
[0:06] believe in medicine and operation I
[0:09] believe there God sent blessings to us
[0:12] but sometimes we get to a place to where
[0:15] it's beyond what our Medical Science can
[0:17] handle then when it comes to that I
[0:19] think instead of giving up and dying we
[0:22] have a right to come to the great
[0:23] position if you're a local doctor
[0:25] couldn't help you you'd have a right to
[0:27] go to a specialist and if the specialist
[0:29] came help you then let's go to The
[0:31] Specialist of specialist Jesus that's
[0:35] why I'm here not to take the doctor's
[0:37] patient but to pray for the doctor's
[0:40] patient God's child and my friends
