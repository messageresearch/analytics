brethren uh [Music] taking advantage of time and asking you if you can please open your scriptures along with me uh john chapter 14 verse 18. for us covering a subject like this it's the complete bible brethren just just please hear a small piece so you can receive this information and it'll be of help to all of us the word of the lord reads the following i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in my father and he and me and i in you see [Music] he that has my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to thank our lord once again for this opportunity for granting us to be here amongst you also thanking our pastor for his trust with all the local governments that helps us bring forth these services and i've all of you too brother may god bless you once again we're in the plan of redemption today now the subject we'll be focusing on it's a little simple title it but you see me hey [Music] it's a promise god is giving to us first of all he says he will not leave us comfortless he will come to us amen amen said something more simple that we've repeated many times in john 14 19. and the world sees me no more he's speaking here of the world the exterior the cosmos believers i'll repeat that ye shall live also he didn't appear to everyone amen the prophet says we're going to read in a second he could appear to the pilot and claim to him the high priest listen closely so it was a great time them them glorious 40 days i would have loved to have been there but then thinking again that i'd have to today he still only to his elected church believers notice brethren and then he appeared to his elected church the rest know why did not jesus after his resurrection if he was so interested in everybody knowing that he had raised from the dead then i wonder why he did not go up well i'll say pilate or to herod and say to them or go to orthodox church down in the synagogue and say to them is now you all have always believed that there would come a messiah and david said his soul would not be left in hell neither would he suffer his holy one to see corruption so i am here the one that you nailed to the cross i am hearing the resurrection to prove to you that when he was here in person on earth before his crucifixion they would not believe him afterwards there's something else that happened [Music] that's the same way he would do it today she would come today which he has in spirit form prophecy only comes today i so the bread is where the lord jesus christ the disciples the apostles the lord gave the germ of life to them the day of pentecost there see brother find a centurion named cornelius cornelius was a gentile partner with the jews but he was a gentile pero nombre santo the holy man he's going is here with the vision of the angel is you we're going down to see something here real deep fill up in the eunuch observe this church the real church with the true sperm not his preaching his gospel to an angel how many knows that how many knows that galatians 1 8. from heaven and preached something else besides they had preached let it and everything pero not believe in jesus he comes back down studying the prophecy of isiah where did the germ come from the angel showed him where to go he's a messenger here that's how a child can be born the spirit of god sure now listen the same thing took place in acts 10 48. peter was on the housetop cornell i need to direct him to caninez's house but where did the word come from [Applause] [Applause] through the body of christ [Music] it takes the spirit of life god it was very important paolo santigos for the elders another genealogy correcto correct and the tribes to get identified why the they were cut off this not only contact a carrier forgive me i remember noah number i'm not going to mention the name what the characteristics seem to identify them a missionary man tremendous tremendous man of is but at one time i was asking the lord my need was so great to fast and pray i don't know how many days you told me so the angel of the lord appeared to me and told me phoenix go to phoenix there is my servant i did what possible i could even i got phoenix came down to phoenix [Music] to see what i had to do the angel has not changed brothers god has not changed he will direct someone else i was [Music] i don't know genuine the holy spirit identified the lord when the bread was broken correct when that character was demonstrated they rejoiced the lord adoption adoption assona pregunta asks a question physical looks he's going to take a physical exam he was there waiting [Music] remember [Music] [Music] do you know in the condition you find yourself yes in other words [Music] do you know
