TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now there's a little preview of what death was and how horrible death was to the founders down to our Christian religion how the promises is given down through these Patriarchs that have mentioned this morning now let's come right down the home words that these little disciples after the little band that was hated in the beginning they had not many friends of this Earth and any man that serves Jesus Christ will not have many friends of this you have to stand on your conviction alone for many times you have to stand by yourself but he promised he would stand with you I'll go with you even to the end and now while I see him let's look at it he' been taken away they expected because he could do Miracles and he claimed he did nothing in himself but what the father showed him but he he was a Mir worker and when he given into the hands of P how could they expect to see the Messiah of God stripped down with his clothes and stand there and beaten and bruised and mashed and crushed and spit on and not even open his mouth and say a word that had broken their heart the very man could stretch out say be still and the wind and the [Music] waves the one who could stop a funeral procession and lay hand up on the casket and say young man I say unto the AR and he come for one who went into a heartbroken home where a daughter just died a little priest who would set himself with Jesus and became a Believer and he walked in said Give Peace because the damel is not dead she sleep surely they would have known surely there was something there he walked in Tucker by the hand look at it and said Danel I say unto thee arise and girl that was dead in her soul gone stood to her feet how that he went to the grave of Lazarus crying like a man the tears rolling down his cheeks as he wept and stood there and a man that have been dead four days and the skin worms crawling in and out of his body let see him raise his little figure like that that I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never [Music] die for thank of it he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die what a hope we have this morning then when we visit our grace through our loved on what a hope we have in this mortal flesh today as the Holy Spirit Bears record he lives shall never die has yet we pack the bodies over the grave of the sa but inside they are alive they're living somewhere when he stood said I am the resurrection and life and there was a man laying there he said take away the stone and the contamination of his body that odor of a human body you know what it is when they raised up what with the sickly smell around there but he spoke out and said Lazarus come forth and a man that had been dead four days rose up from the grave how could they see a man with that kind of a power hanging on Calvary with great mocking gods of solders spit that made fun of him dropping from his beard while they jerked handfuls of beard from his face and hit him on Andes when they see Roman Nails drove into his hands and into his feet how could they see a man like that die because God required judgment and Christ took our judgment how they were so disappointed they went away to their and and Peter said I go fish and the disciples said I'll just go with you they did they were all together torn upo there they took his body down wrapped it in some linen and laid it in the grave and said that's the thing is that how the world was against him they said he was a Holy Roller he was insane he was he was a fanatic and so forth but he said he was God he looked like him he acted like him he proved he was God [Music] a woman said not long as I said this many times she said he wasn't Divine brother brand a Christian Science woman she said he was only a man that he was just man I said he was more than a man he was God I said he either God or Deceiver she said well because he cried the grave of Lazarus he proved that he wasn't nothing but a man I said when he was crying he cried like a man but when he rose the dead he proved he was God he is I said when he was hungry he hunger like a man but could you imagine a man standing around a fig tree trying to find something eat and a few days later picked up a few biscuits about two biscuits and two or three pieces of fish and said five people with good Calvary hanging there between the heavens and earth crying I thirst I thirst and turned even water to the very creator of the water standing there streaming for water sin for us that we in his Pro poverty might be made Rich he in his death he died like a sinner that us and our death could die Sons and Daughters of God I think one difference between death old daddy Haze down here when he was dying called his children to the bedside and there he'd been laying in a coma for two or three days he had a word he said dear bless my soul long white flowing beard he said dear bless my soul you thought daddy hay was dead he said I'll never because Jesus Lives I live also and there he blessed each one of his children said raise up my hands he couldn't hold his hands up one of his boys got on one side raised that hand the other raised that hand he began to saying eyes began to look up towards heaven he said happy day happy day since Jesus washed my sins away he taught me how let me pray and live rejoicing every day and closed his eyes and went out to meet God I tell you that's the way I want to go that's the way letesus Christ disciples had seemed that all the disappointments and everything that that he had looked like it let him down they all started to go back one went back to his work the other went back this [Music] way now we want start this morning on TB and after his resurrection Mary Martha and Mary Mary magdalina ofus magd it was early one morning they kept his body in the ground over the Sabbath which was a customary that they didn't do anything on the Sabbath day so he died Friday afternoon at 3:00 and Rose up real early Sunday morning now I want to settle this question while you're here this morning in this Sunrise Service many people says how comes then that he said said that he would lay he was in the grave three days and night he never said he would do that he said but in these three days while I raise up my body now the reason he did that is because David had said one place in the scripture I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption and he knew that corruption set in the human body after 72 hours 3 days and sometime within that three days and night God was going to raise him up so he died on Friday afternoon at 3:00 and Rose up early Sunday morning now let's just take a little drama right here and stop for a moment and watch I can see it's all night long poor little old Mary the Mother her heart was broke the prophet Anne told her she would Beed to RS of how that his body was afflicted in her own darling bab hanging on the cross and what a disgrace he had brought to the church but yet in her heart that Mother's Love reached out there was no matter what he had done how much [Music] he died capital punishment like a a convict today that would go out there to be hung or electrocuted or something that's the way he died in shame and disgrace and then how she' wept probably all night and her and Mary magdalina she knew his power she knew there was something about him was different from anyone else she had Seven Devils cast out of her everybody that's ever been free from the Devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they're standing no one can ever come in his great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore you you're a change something Happ to you or you can stand off psychology and imagine this and accept this a certain thing and some theories or uh something like that but we don't believe in theology we believe in the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and when you come into His a presence or something that happens in your life that changes you and you're never the same anymore a man that's ever been in the presence of she had Seven Devils cast out of her pride and envy and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her but when Jesus spoke in [Music] [Applause] all [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

a while now Hebrews 9:11 according to the subject that the Lord placs in our pastor's hands for us to be spoking on Hebrews 9:11 when you have indicated with an amen but was going to take advantage of we can find a blessing we can hear and then we can read at the same time blessed are they who hear and read the word of this prophecy Hebrews 911 reads in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this [Music] building Eternal red neither by the blood of goats and

praying for our pastor please let's continue and pray for him when we were in Africa and wish I had the energy that he has we all of whack because of time 6 a.m. he was giving us wakeup calls we weren't ready yet we wanted another hour of sleep so we thank God for [Music] that and praying that the Lord may continue to strengthen him [Music] amen strengthen him him spiritually and so we can continue preaching his glorious where God calls him and guides him my brother begin to show different videos to Dr [Music] Montoya Services there that we had there in South Africa he said brother mon seems like wherever you go the Revival follows you different places you've been there was a great Revival that's what God has called our pastor for let's continue praying for him maintain him in our prayers I see the way he surrenders and he surrenders all all he has all his strength makes me think that when brother Ben when a person preaches for 20 minutes it's like they had work for8 hours when I see him preach and surrender the way he does I don't think that was eight hour shift that's like more 16 hour God bless you good to see you also we also appreciate sister L for the effort she makes it's difficult also for the wives we also thank her us the privilege of loing us Dr Montoya amen want to continue what we've been speaking on but we're going to make a par parentheses here to give

the voice of God recording first thing I did was to ask for brother Billy Paul they told me he's in a meeting but if you wait when he's done he'll surely meet you said but we just don't know how long the meeting is going go said don't worry I don't care how long the meeting lasts I'll be here doesn't matter we waited a while and they called us to be able to meet him for a while we were in his office he asked my name where I come from told my name where I come from first thing he asked me if we were from Brother Bernie's Church gave him great joy Phoenix that he knew he knew when we were coming from Phoenix Tabernacle brother ber Garcia's Ministry immediately identified expressed his love for our pastor and Apostle beautiful experience believe for all of us that are believers of this message news that hit our hearts pretty hard Lifeline the lifeline app and who those who are subscribed to the WhatsApp with the voice of God Recordings that Joseph Bram sent a note titled it I had a dream brothers and sisters not long ago brother Billy told me a dream he had like to share with you that I know that it was from the Lord he said he was walking next to a precious stream brother brandom was standing on the other side brother Bram spoke and said Paul you look tired Billy said I am dad brother Brown continued saying come walk with me that's the dream he had on Thursday I believe at 3:33 in the morning on the 19th of October of [Music] 2023 brother Billy Paul passed peacefully to the other side of the stream and he walking alongside his buddy to never Tire again you could imagine what that dream means to me in my heart this moment I know it was sent by God to encourage Billy the family and all of us for this moment thank you Lord Jesus You're So attentive to send us the angels with the softest hands in these times when we need comfort like to thank all of you for your prayers precious and sincere prayers surely all of us have felt them God bless you Brother Joseph Branham and family [Music] believe our brother for what he lived what he was able to see he's the greatest witness in mankind that saw God's manifestation in quantities that not even in biblical times were manifested very special man and he still is for he's not dead but only asleep he was born on the 13th of September of 1935 when he was two years he had an experience with the Lord allowed him to see the angel of the Lord there were in a hotel when the angel of the Lord uh told Brother Billy to the bill to wake him up and he was able to see the angel of the Lord so from that moment on I knew when the angel of the Lord was present I learned to identify that presence not only did I feel him but I was able to see him we're going to place a small video here at think about 10 minutes as a small memorial to honor a servant a veteran a memorial tested by time man while he was on Earth was very [Music] privileged William Bram he the son of brother William br William him being a son of brother of he was a witness but the greatest that is he was a Son of God let us see this English but subtitled in Spanish amen we've been married all several months after about a year Little Billy Paul come on the scene all she almost died and how I walked up and down the floor when the little fellow was being born and just as soon as he was Barn I heard him cry and I screamed I said Thank You Lord It's a boy and his name Shall be Called Billy Paul many of you know my son Billy Paul his mother died when he just a little baby I packed him around and night time we couldn't afford enough coal to keep fire so he I'd put his bottle under my shoulders like this and keep it warm for him at night time when he wake up crying for his mother I'd put the bottle in his mouth and she asked me when she was dying always stick with Billy we've been real Chums and so everywhere I go I take Billy and he's stuck with me well like could take this opportunity to greet you I don't get this opportunity much anymore as you get a little older you can't do the things that you used to do you want to and in your heart but one thing I want you to know that I love you and I pray for you daily and I know that you pray for me because that's why I'm here today truly we're a blessed people and I just want to take an opportunity to say God bless you and over the many years that I have known you and have worked with you when Dad was here and now in the work with Brother Joseph it's just an honor to call you my friend and you know there's words you can't say but I just trust that this little greeting will be a blessing to you just to say I love you and that you can feel it from your heart you know brother brand said we could we could talk too much we could sing too much we could shout too much but we can never pray too much and each day brother Bram told me he said when you come in office Billy he said I want you to do my mail and I said Daddy I don't even know how to turn on the typewriter he says the Lord will be with you he said he told me he wanted you to do that for me and I said okay he said no matter if you've got one letter or you've got a thousand he said the first thing you do is kneel down and pray and lay your hands on the mail and ask the Lord to help you that day and he said don't you answer any Bible questions don't you answer for me he said if a question of me you keep them when we get together the next day or that day or whenever he says then you write down on the envelope and I'll answer the questions he said but no matter where I am he says you remember every day that you do the mail he said I'll be praying for you and he says and God will be there with you and he says don't process the mail he said just open one letter at a time and just think like you only have one letter to answer and he says and then when you through with that he says discard it and then get another one and that's what I've been doing for the last 60 years it's been a great honor and I know I'm getting older now I'm not an old man but I know I'm getting up there and soon I've got to go and be what we've all been waiting for and I believe that R is so close at hand but I just want an opportunity to say I love you and I thank you for your love to me your stand for this word and you know brother Billy I'm just talking to you from my heart I believe this is a oneman message it's a perfect message there's no mistakes there's many voices but for me and my house we only follow one voice and that's the voice of God to us in this day it's perfect it needs no interpretation it interprets itself and I was thinking a couple of days now I'll be getting my 83rd birthday and in my heart and in my body I don't feel that old I know I look it and the wife says I act like it no I shouldn't say that if it wasn't for her I I wouldn't even be here today but it's just the idea of of being able to express yourself this message is everything to me it's perfect and may God encourage your heart to stay with it there's things we don't understand but remember if God thought it brother Brenham spoke it we believe it and that settles it I was thinking the other day and I woke up and when I was just a little boy I was about 12 years old and we was over in a little town called vandelia Illinois and brother Brandon was having a tent meeting and we stayed in a little cheap hotel and I say that to go with my testimony here and I know you've probably heard me give this testimony but maybe just one more time I want to share it with you because it's one of the greatest experiences of my life and in this room it didn't even have a bathroom the bathroom was down the hall and we just had a war spacing right where the camera is here and it was just a little war spacing and a little picture and that's where we'd wash our hands and things when we had to take a shower take a bath we' go down at the end of the hall I used to sell in the meetings I had a little apron and I go down and I'd sell the little books there was three books brother brandom had Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision Divine Healing in healing in the campaigns and I thought I was something get down there and sell those books and daddy would always i' see the the Lord move in the meetings and as a kid he'd tell us about these things and how the angel would meet him and I remember one night in this hotel room we sitting there and my dad's brother was working with us at that time he was driving a truck and his name was Donnie and he was the youngest of the brothers and he and I and dad were sleeping in the same room and I don't remember I know Dad says on tape that he that he took a pillow and throw it over and woke me up all I remember I woke up was a pillar across my face and and he he had this pillar across my face and he says Paul I said yes sir it was about 2:00 in the morning and he says you know the Ang angel that Daddy talks about I said yes sir and he said he visited me tonight and was telling me some things and about the meetings and how to conduct the meetings and what was going to happen and I said yes sir and he still had the pill across my face and he says and I asked him could I wake you up and could I wake up my brother Donnie and he said the angel said you can wake up Billy And he says and he says can he see you and the angel said yes he said excuse me he says when Dad when dad takes his pillow from your face he says you know where the was spacing knows over there and I said yes sir he said he'll be standing there and you can see him and I said okay you remember I was just 12 years old and he took a pillow from my face and I thought it' be an angel with wings flying playing around but it wasn't like that there stood a man in that room dressed in Pure White and he had his arms folded like this hair down to his shoulders he just stood there one thing it remind was so outstanding to me he never spoke a word but he look around the room but his eyes was totally focused on my dad every move was watching my dad and I can see those I can see him yet now them eyes just going around the room he look at me me and he look over at my Uncle he look back around like that he'd move his head a little bit but his eyes never left Daddy's Eyes and I grabbed daddy cuz I I didn't know it was a man standing in the room over by the window and and he I never forget daddy told me he said don't be scared son he said he sent from the presence of almighty God and he says he won't harm you he says he'll be a blessing now watching he just held real close and daddy held me and he went from that being of a man just as brother Bram describes him into I'm not going to say a pillar fire it was like a Mist a light a vapor he just kind of vanished and he went out the window right out the room like that and when he left a rainbow come right in the same window and hung in that room for hours at midnight 2:00 in the morning dark room but he stood there and that P oh excuse me that rainbow stayed in the room I felt a presence and I asked my dad later I says why did that happen and he says he said CU I wanted you to see him he said God called you to work with me Billy and I wanted you to see him and to know what Daddy was telling you was the truth not that I doubt it but was just such an experience such a wonderful experience and all through my life I traveled and my job was to get Daddy in and out of the meetings you know sometimes I let him stay too long and sometimes I take him too quick and you know I just young boy but I kept doing what he said and I give out the prayer cards and I'd bring the people up to him and sometimes I let him stay too long and he' said Billy you let me stay too long tonight he says he says tomorrow night you don't give out prayer calls CU Dad's too TI well I'd go home and I'd cry I'd be so upset because I messed up the next night's meeting then sometimes I take him too quick he'd say you could let me stay a little longer and no was just a hard time but what a wonderful time I've seen the people just any disease I was thinking the other night you know you watch the news they call this disease that and they they change the name but it's all the devil it's all the devil but when the angel made him he said if you get the people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and I'm a witness to you today that he's the same yesterday today and forever and what not one time from that time in that room when I saw that angel that I could always tell you not brother Billy but that presence I could tell when he was near even before daddy would say you know what I'm waiting for something I might be down at audience working the prayer line ushering whatever I might be doing but I could tell exactly when that angel come the platform before dad sometimes even said he said he's here but I knew he was so didn't make any difference what diseases was I knew when they left it's going to be well but he said if you get the people to believe you and I was telling someone the other day I said I've seen them bring them in well and they sit there and make fun and they pack them out dead I seen them pack him out paralyzed and I seen him bring him in on a stretcher and he would be dead and I seen him walk out alive and well only believe so I just wanted to say God bless you and I like to just leave my little greetings to you and this if I don't see you in person I'll meet you on that day and I had the privilege when he was here to have the interviews for him to set him up I don't know how it's going to be over there I just know I'm going to be there by his grace and I said God bless me above any man first of all he let me be his son he chose me and then let me be a son of a prophet and to be a brother of a prophet and to have worked with both of the prophets in my lifetime truly I've been a blessed man all we have to do is push play and obey God bless you and remember if God thought it brother Bram spoken I believe it and that settles God bless you I'm gonna give stand and give Applause in memory BR brother Billy Paul Brandon you may take your seats I imagine in other churches they're doing the same thing honoring the memory of this great man believe he deserves that much more Brother Joseph said in his letter it's difficult because he's not long longer with us like said but he has received his prize me people may have questions because of the testimony uh ask questions and that's where the Mind begins to find a logical answer and that's where us as humans fail because we want to try interpret the thoughts that God has expressed in a in in a human way sometimes we're just so connected with our with the material and when God comes and speaks to us we interpret his word in a in a humanly way and then we mix it and we take out the supernatural out of it and instead of believing we begin to doubt and [Music] reason speak to brother well someday we should be ready it's now because now he is a young man he's a young man according to what we've been taught according to what the prophet has spoken to us he's a young man now he's not an older man anymore God gave him his reward and seeing this people can speak and say this but for a Son of God instead of analyzing what's on a Son of God analyzes with inside and begin to analyze our own life ask about what happened here for us very important but also people were asking about this what are we going to do what's next Prophet already spoke it already told us what's going to happen he's already opened the Revelation our pastor and Apostle Brother G Garcia preached so many messages so many Revelations the only time for the only thing for us in these days shouldn't be to be questioning the modern events because the problem sometimes we try to put these events in chronological order and get in trouble with [Music] that remember time is an illusion everyone gives their own interpretation you can see sit down for five minutes and watch your favorite movie you'll say that fast let me grab you and put you underwater and trust me it's going to feel like 10 hours because everyone interprets time according to its event but God doesn't work that way for God is eternal so what's happening there's no time to reason it this isn't time for you to say well it's gonna happen like this and it's gonna happen like that it's time for us to surrender more to God time to analyze Our Lives it's time to see and say Lord Lord is my life according to your word am I doing what you've sent me to do you have an eternal plan you have something for me am I behaving according to the plan you have part of the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ I know I've been called you gave me an order a commission but I'm placed am I plac in the body of Christ I'm placed in my position I'm doing what pleases you I'm doing your perfect will that's what we should be thinking the attacks that are happening in this [Music] conflict have been brutal attacks those who you've seen the the attacks from this Hamas to Israel we should always be praying for Israel Prophet taught us Israel is God's time piece you don't know what time you want to know what time it is look at your but if you don't know what time we're living in turn to Israel these times when the attacks happened uh it was a 50 year an there's a war that's called yum kapor that was in 1953 yapur is a secr celebration of the Jewish people a holy day interpretation to our language the day of atonement a religious holiday that is celebrated series of 10 days in which this celebration takes forth this they give us special attention it's a solemn day they complet completely sated to God asking for forgiveness to God God's sanctification and forgiveness asking forgiveness for their [Music] sins and that's when the the Hamas the terrorist organization attacked Israel so on our part what we can do is pray [Music] pray and people interpret it people get nervous people begin to get fear begin to interpret things in our own way of thinking there's a time we should dedicate ourselves to prayer it's now the time where we need to anal analyze ourselves it's now many times we understand certain things that the word tells [Music] us but we applied in a time where it shouldn't be [Music] applied brother Bernie preached a message titled the just judge brother bam said a thing that that the word comes to judge comes to judge and the word says that he made us Kings and [Music] Priests and when we're placed the Revelation and a time comes where it says that we will have judgment to be able to decide we'll be in a trial we'll be the ones making the decision as the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ many times we take that out of of the context of time for the time when the bride will be judging is present at the time of judgment is that the bride is judging itself the bride is judging itself the bride before able to judge others has to judge has to sit down to judge yourself according to the word privilege we we have being the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm gonna sit down and judge before doing that we have to sit down and judge ourselves the words have been spoken the word begins to judge us begins to tell us where we're telling us where we need to fix ourselves but God forces no one this is the revelation of the last days that the maximum Revelation came another time has been around but also in this time God has made partnership with us God has made us partners partnership is 50/50 that's why it's so difficult has been loed in the time we're living Prophet said all the Demonic power to attack the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ all the power of hell is attacking every son and daughter of God God has sent an unction of the eagle in the last days prophetic Vision where we can go to the highest point be able to see what's happening in our days the word where it needs to be placed and where should the word be placed in our hearts that's where we need to apply it to are you salted how many are salted we're salted remember the only salted ones are who the of the Lord Jesus Christ somebody calls you salty don't get offended don't get offend the bride is salted you are the salt of the earth I am the salt of the earth of theud begin to speak to them begin to preach them Doctrine he was speaking of do phes were preaching Doctrine when people heard uh the Lord Jesus they Marvel the doctrine of Lord Jesus Christ they heard the doctr of the Pharisees but when they heard the Lord Jesus Christ they Mar of his doct he would speak with authority because the Lord Jesus Christ came to make contact with them and what he want to do was change their attitude we we speak of the natural causes of uses for salt see see how salt is a seasoner on the basis of the scriptures Leviticus 2 how the sacrifice needed to be salted once it was salted it had to go through the fire as us when we go through the fire according to Colossians we begin to speak with salted words me means that when the trial come to support the trial sacrif we're a Living Sacrifice going through the trialed acceptable for the Lord Jesus Christ how we speak on how love is one that gives salt gives the The Salted flavor towards people When Love is projected see how salt provokes thirst provokes thirst when we are salted we provoke we provoke thirst to others desire to be like us others desire to have that Christian attitude now we mean to speak a little bit how salt is a preserver in the time of Jesus they used salt as a preserver now if you remember you that took notes according to the word salt was made to be stepped on by men was thrown on the floor to be stepped on by would throw is on the floor because the salt would get mixed up with other [Music] elements then people when they were going to use a salt they knew it was preserved with something else because it had a better taste so then the salt turned into a bitter salt they threw it along the way so the way wouldn't be so slippery only the salt that was preserved well salt that was used salt had much value there was ways especially made to transport that's why it's called The Salted way now as a preserver salt was used to preserve a combust combustibles no oh I'm sorry salt was used to preserve food so it wouldn't uh go bad meat wouldn't fish wouldn't go sour that's why it was so valuable because right now we want to conserve something we just freeze it they didn't have freezers but they have salt Sal would conserve the food that's why it was so valuable the food would spoil it avoided salt of food being corrupted it avoided for the for the food that they were about to eat to spoil then when we're salted when we are salted it's to preserve we turn into salted people we're avoiding the corruption of our attitudes helps us for not having negative at to be busy with not to be busy with our thoughts not only that second chronicles 135 are you not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the Kingdom of Israel to David forever even to him and to his son by a covenant of salt God made a covenant of salt with David and his descendancy a covenant of salt a covenant that would last in the Old Testament when they had a covenant of Sal meant that something would last Isaiah 553 inclan your ear and come unto me here your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David this brother Bram says in the message of Abraham's Grace Covenant she said you the salt of the earth a covenant one with the they throw salt to one another that means that the Covenant must keep Sal holds them together keeps it from spoiling nothing can spoil our contract it's a covenant our handshake is fellowship we agree upon the basis of Fellowship that we'll keep our covenant one to another so will keep our covenant because it will not Mar or spoil our covenant will always be kept in the message he swore by himself he gave him the Covenant unconditionally not because Abraham was Abraham went through that weeks ago you know he gave Abraham the Covenant because God himself chose him elect him before the foundation of the world Abraham before ever was born on Earth God knew all about him know what he would do and by Grace he chose AB not only Abraham for Abraham seed after him so God made a covenant Covenant of Grace Covenant of salt he expressed his grace brother bham says the message in Cades Bara he sent a shedding of the holy spirit for these last days God fulfilled the Covenant with his people with no intervention from them he fulfilled the promise he had with his sons it's Act of Grace and his Sovereign he sent Moses he sent a savior when he makes a covenant makes a coven of makes of he sends a deliverer of unable not because of what he because he was going to because he chose him I you this moment we make a covenant unbreakable no matter what you do it's Covenant of Grace tells the message Ines he makes a covenant with his people his Sovereign Grace sent a messenger sent a deliverer himself said he will send someone and send and and and free the people from their oppression I will come down send Moses god in ofce Covenant of God is hidden is hidden has a seal the why the seals were open the the to be open something SE something behind something important through thees to every Church age dispensation of Grace God Made aen made aen the foundation of the world bring in the heart of man to send the light had come according to the way the Covenant had been given the Covenant of Grace to be according to what God was requiring in the time we last Church age Church age s a messenger to us he understood someone to guide us in this darkness in the heart of the Messer was sealed the heart of man had come and break the seal Revelation 5 when John saw the sealed book with Seven Seals you couldn't see what was the but the lamb came and overcame the cross of Calvary his life for us and he was Worthy respons open up he fulf without blemish or contamin F the requ only a lamp can come and break the seal Pure Life without blemish without contamination we can think no one fulfills requ the same thing that John thought saw book with Seven Seals searched in heaven who's with only one to open the seals open the seals he had manifest his nature as a lamb of the tribe of he over open the turned it wasn't the before the foundation of world the having of the power open that was hidden that was the name of everyone that was redeemable now we can be fre John says in the Bible that he he was crying of Joy his name matter they had in there with the most dangerous prisoners because they tried to boil him him Wich and sent him to the most dangerous men there in that place around him everything was dry danger scorpion when he saw his name written there around matter no more because he knew knew reation came to him of who he he could understand when that seal was open only did the lamb open the seven but whenn come and he sees his name the heart of of who he was was there was a ration who he had to tear that seal Tor he was able to see his written name that's why is that he wept he wept of Joy his tears what did he do are L open toship him he was another another diens his body was there his eternal spirit his true himself having a supernatural experience he is that's how it is how many are salted within our heart is a mystery there a hidden Mystery but the problem many times we're sleep to what's happening Focus so much about what's around us don't Focus what's us the answer is not out the answer is in understand the answer to all your questions within us is the Eternal internal conversation always Destro us we have a mentality destroy ourselves of self-destruction us take promises to us self destroying of the diseases that is in these days everywhere immun our self our self-destroying immune system a a aimmune system our own body attacks itself things happening within our organism that our body doesn't know what to do and is attacking the body that's why there's bone inflammation Artis arthritis so many things going on that there diseases within our own body our body attacking itself and that's what's happening in our spiritual life we attack ourselves we're destroying ourselves we're not giving the opportunity for the land to come within us there's a seal the lamb can untie it the nature of L that seal will will maintain hidden that's what it is that's why in these days the greatest thing there could greatest quality is to have a clean heart M but I'm saying a clean heart the Samaritan woman had a clean heart when she found herself with Jesus let me tell you what the prophet says the message he swore by himself you can't be destroyed of what God was already destroyed for you're a part of of God I will lift you up in the latter day they that have been Justified has already been glorified and in the presence of the almighty God every man that has been born again of the Holy Spirit glorified in in the presence now waiting for the time of redemption so when God sees you God saw the amarican woman Prophet says people see the amican women they saw ill Fame but God saw her heart and he saw representation redeemed glorified person Eternal thought expressed but that woman she automatically was destroying she had hid she had the experience with the L and she said re re lamb comes to her and it's in our heart atically cast out cast out malice cast out hate cast out the things you have against other people you have something some they're Son of God receiving the Holy Spirit that's what it is you have a negative feeling your heart the lamb cannot be there cannot be open cannot be revealed who you truly are Myst of manifested has come into our life that's what it is don't look reation Del re who was before Herer with word she understands that who Reve the woman woman saw her Eternal without blemish without contamination but only a Sal will be able to see a son or daughter of God that's in the that's on be to see their heart see the Eternal SE someone has to have that responsibility say Messiah said suffer no more don't follow that way no there's something better there's something better simply recogn receive re of who I am man not only who you are L comes is there to loose the Manifest God when the power comes no that can hold us that come against the security who you are where you come from where you're going is in your heart can separate the love of God in Christ Jesus Prophet what do we fear all we need to do look at ourselves to way in our heart that bitterness that malice that are hindering us for the hly brother you don't know brother to deliver anyone healing to anyone but we need to take nature of the Lamb the nature of the Lamb comes you yourself representing the lamb sacrifice you open a way the seal be open son God can be manifested in you not looking up high or back there within you you're a son and daughter of God of manifestation is now you have stop destroying yourself negative thoughts about In The Name Of The Lord accept your deliver saman woman all she needed was a word from the Messiah word of Christ from Theo now the words we have them Prophet says someone said brother if Joshua would have told me would be a blessing I'm tell you forsake take your place the Lord Jesus Christ hallelu Hallelujah can please stand we'll be praying will bring the manifestation of the nature of the L the lamb is humble the lamb forfeits its rights the lamb humbles itself know it has the right to do whatever but he is Guided by the word and the word says you have to surrender surrender your rights when the nature of the Lamb comes the seals can be torn the begins to be manifested I am part of that manifestation because Earth Earth is of the sons of God manifestation doesn't come of the to come into our heart we have to die to ourselves word is telling us trth and run with that let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you Father thank you for your word Lord there's something impeding for the nature of the lamp to come into US father when you cast it out May bitterness be cast out depression be cast out anguish hate if we have something against someone understand that they just contaminating our heart you can't make a covenant with us because a covenant of Sal is a covenant that lasts Covenant that cast out corruption corruption cannot come into us there has been an unconditional covenant made give us the strength to be overcome ourselves you're waiting for us to take that step to be brave to cast out what's hindering us you can do nothing no more you's already done it you already died at the cross of calvary you already did your part but you made man partnership the 50% we do ourselves he told You' be with us said nothing would stand before us but we have to advance we have to take your word we have to have faith we have to cast out doubts we surrender to you Heavenly Father Place ourselves
