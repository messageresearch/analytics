[Laughter] [Music] is [Music] is is me [Music] Mee [Music] [Laughter] [Music] amen God bless you Brothers It's pleasure to be here this evening the nice weather we have today give thanks to God for all the things he gives us take advantage of time be so kind we can open up our Bibles going to our base scripture in the Book of Genesis amen when you have you canate with an amen amen the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was th formed in void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and there was so now like to read another scripture in John 367 John 36 says that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee ye must be born again let us pray brother Heavenly Father Here we are Lord in this evening father I have always said I don't believe in coincidence I believe you have control of all things you already saw this scene for the foundation of the world father here tonight you know the heart of each one of us father you know the need that's inside of each Heart Holy Father so this night Lord bring myself aside father and may you be able to speak those words of life that only you can give each Heart Holy Father put ourselves in your hands father and we ask all of it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats Brothers I'd like to thank my pastor for the opportunity for the trust that he gives me to be here behind this Pulpit uh it's something that's not very easy to do even though the body does its due diligence it gets nervous because not something very simple I know that even brother Bernie says we know that all the messages all the Mysteries were already declared there's no new message that we can receive we are the echo we only repeat which was what was already said because in repetition lies the revelation that's what we do on these days when we come to church it's to share of the much that God has given us he is a good god he takes care of his children he knows the needs that we have he is the father and as a father we want to give the best to our children children it's the same thing now I'd like to speak this night a little bit on the new birth listening to the tapes of adoption we realize that many times the devil we know that he is a good adversary he knows exactly how to approach us and many times Brothers he knows who we are but the one that has like the new birth he makes you think that you don't have it and the one who doesn't have it he tells him you're good you already have it this is the most deceiving age that there is because the devil the devil the Bible says that he's consistently as a roaring line he's not resting he's after each one of us and we also have to have our guard up brother said there's a battle going on these days the greatest battle ever fought it's here in our mind the Devil comes with all of his thoughts all the things are going around globally the news those applications our phones the notifications constantly we are being bombarded Brothers with information and then I realize the reason that the devil has us so busy or preoccupied because he doesn't want you to have a relationship with God grow with that yoke or that relationship to make it stronger with God and each time it's just taking or stealing time away from us that's his job sometimes he doesn't stop you from coming to church sometimes he lets you do what you have to do but at home at your job wherever you are that's where he is also working constantly trying to take your time away so you don't have a stronger relationship with our Lord Jesus Christ the tape of adoption brother Bernie says that when the people don't know their rights Satan stops you from getting what belongs to you he says the only way we can know our rights what belongs to us it's through his word we're not listening to his word then we don't know what belongs to us all those promises that God has given us we're not constantly listening to his word those promises that God has for us the new birth you have to ask for it you have to desire it before I used to think that God would come down I I was expecting a light the way that I thought about it God will appear when the time is right but that's not the way it is God has his way of doing and he uses man man is God's agent that's why this message is preached it says by the craziness of the preach it's something crazy but it's the way that God chose to speak to his people that's why we come to preach the gospel go out throughout the world and preach the gospel because that's the way Brothers when the word comes when that water comes we are that Earth that land and that is already planted here but when that water comes and it Waters it a process of ger germanization I like what brother bam says about it but I'd like to give the definition of germination says the development of a plant from a seed or sport after a period of dorcy brother bam in his message called a spiritual Amnesia you know brothers that we are eternal tells us in job where were you where were you brother when he's laying down the foundation where were you now we come to this earth and we don't remember because of that Amnesia that we have but one day a word came and through an angel and told us you're not a chicken you're you're you're you're an eagle and he spoke to us in a language we were able to hear that word and there's something inside of us that began to light live it quickened inside of us it's not because I wanted it the Bible says that you don't search for God God's looking searching for you the seed was dispersed throughout the world that's why brother goes throughout different parts of the world and preaches the gospel the children of God are throughout different parts of the world it's not our job to know who it is and who isn't our job to judge our brothers or our sisters my job is to preach the gospel tell them that God sent a mess for this age time that we are living in because there's many people Brothers around the world they think that they are that they are Christian or they're part of the bride and they don't even know the messenger and truly Brothers this is the most deceitful age lately I was talking to my brother I'm I'm studying a fox book of Martyrs the Two Babylons and I realize how the Catholic Church how it's gotten inside completely and right now there's a large movement if you haven't noticed the Catholic Church here in the United States and we know that that Spirit coming is coming once again a spirit where each one of us are going to be persecuted but the bride Brothers the bride will not be pers the bride will be raptured before that tribulation he has given us an Escape Route we have to study and know and be ready and prepared looking at the token looking at the time that we're living in because it's a very deceitful time now brother Bernie says he says the new birth there's a difference between adoption and the new birth many like the natural one a child when he is born you may ask him did you are you already born he doesn't know simply because he's a child or he's a baby now that child has to grow and through listening to the word of God through watering that spirit and that seed inside of his heart he begins to grow and begins to develop because got that spirit of God has given us that food that we that spiritual food that's why Jesus said man shall not live on bread alone but of all word that proceeded out the mouth of God but the devil brother he is a good adversary he makes us believe that you have not been born again yet and that's where he has is look what you did the other day look what mistake you made over here look at the lie you told over here look at this look at that and now we're saying oh Lord I haven't been born again when you've already been born but as a child when he begins to walk he makes mistakes he falls but he gets back up that is a Christian says brother brandham a Christian can fall he can make a mistake but he gets back up through that walking he begins to escalate he begins to increase his faith that virtue that patience that knowledge that Godly love that Brotherly Love begin to grow in those seven stages of the PID the perfect man the stat of a perfect man but brother Bernie [Music] says that even in every stage we still fall and far of growing we fail we fall and we say Lord well I haven't been born again but you have already been born again so you start all over again you get back up and you start once again and God is just the Bible says that we confess our sins when we make a mistake and we say Lord help me I didn't want to do this but he helps us and he helps us to move forward and he forgives us he gives us one more opportunity how many want another opportunity I've had many opportunities and I give thanks to God for his blood because through that blood he has cleansed me he has washed me and he justifies us and what is justification it's as if you've never done it but that's for the bride you know you can imagine a bride without stain or blemish because her priz was purchased by the with the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ but through each New Birth you have to have an experience with the Lord but for there to be a new birth there has to be a death if there's no death there can't be life the grain is buried brother says he says the word baptism is to submerge or bury so God baptize us with his holy spirit but in order for him to give us that new bir give us the baptism of the Holy Spirit we have to die die to what to our own ideas our thoughts to our way of believing and let God has his full will in our lives now brother Bernie says the person has to desire the adoption he says if the person does not desire it then they can't receive it then now I realize Brothers when God gave to Joshua he says be brave he says all this land it's yours to fight for every single inch of it the holy spirit is yours tonight you have to fight for it you have to desire it say Lord this is mine I claim in the name of Lord Jesus Christ because he wants for you to ask for it I remember Brothers in an occasion when my wife got baptized I don't know how many remember but brother Berney it happened on a Sunday she got baptized and brother says I want you to come this Monday evening and I'm going to tell you how to receive the Holy Spirit I was speaking with my wife he says tell me so I can remember what is it that brother Bernie said it's so simple Brothers he said ask for it he said ask for it ask for it it's yours Brothers the word is simple it's not complicated you don't have to know so many things there's mysteries in this Bible but they've already been revealed the Bible says that if you want to know cry unto me and I will answer things that th knowest not and I will show thee but he is pleased to who he reveals he knows who he will give the reev to because many times brother Bernie says says the devil he makes us think that we haven't been born again he says he tries to fill that void with Revelations that's the way the devil is he is very deceitful if he's not of one way he's going to try another way he can give you a religious spirit and later you're in conflict with all your brother oh well I know more than you brother I can tell you about the 144,000 or about the Seven Seals or we can talk about many Ministries my brothers but you haven't even been born again yet the devil brother says says overcome is to recognize the devil in each one of his trips if we know how the enemy works then he can no longer do anything to us and when you recognize and when you know who you are you the blood of Lord Jesus Christ the reason that this world has not been destroyed because we are still here brother because the is still covering but when that blood is removed God's judgment will come and that lamb is still on the throne of sacrifice in the Throne of Mercy there's still blood but that sacrifice will turn into a lion it'll be the fury it will be a disaster now if you read that book in the fox book of Martyrs you will see how those men they used to give up their life they would burn them they would throw them into the lions says the the book says that the imagination of a human being in order to come up with ways to torture somebody hurt somebody it's crazy they would do the worst thing that you could even think of and just thinking of that that time will come once again but I give thanks to God that he sent a prophet that he sent a messenger and I didn't choose him he chose me he chose you you have to take that decision it's your decision it will determine your destiny he gave us free moral agency and the decision is inside of you if you accept and you're willing to die you're willing to leave it all to reach a point in your life there's no mother there's no father there's no daughter there's no son there's no work there's no money there's nothing all that matters is the Lord Jesus Christ when you're willing to give your life completely is when God can come down and conceal you and give you his holy spirit but we're always with these worries am not going to pay my rent I'm going to pay my car bill instruction that the devil always has bringing us here and there but the Bible says search the kingom person his righteousness all things will be added on but he is a father of God he knows the need that you have and he will give it to you because he is a good father and he knows what your need is he will never leave you he will never forsake you he said I will be with you even in you until the end of time to reach a point in our life where it has to be only him where it can long be what I want or what I dream of I want to have a house I want a ranch I want horses I want so many things first I want God in my life I know that he will give me all things when you place him in first place I can tell you this night he will bless you he will give you he will give you everything you've asked for because that's what his word says whatever you ask and you don't doubt it that's the way it will be so if you want the new birth it's yours tonight you want the adoption you want that seal it's yours tonight we have to desire you have to ask for it and you have to die so that God can come down and Quicken inside of you that spirit and that sea that can come up and then you can give fruits you'll be a a bountiful fruitful Tre where you can help your brother your sister whichever person that needs a hug what does brother say the world is dying for just an ounce of love we have family even us being from this message and sometimes we have so much work brother Bram throughout the message we can see that the Bride is a hardworking bride she doesn't stay there with her arms crossed brother Brown even gives the story of that cousin that she was hardworking the other young ladies got ready for the the man was coming the groom but she was working and when the Lord Jesus Christ comes that's the character that he's looking for that's why I admire my pastor he goes out he's tired but he continues moving forward because when the groom comes he will find him working because that's the way the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is we don't have to go to far here we have family at home we have family wherever you go but brother Bernie says that with your life sometimes not even just with words you don't need words with your life you're preaching a message and that is what we want we make mistakes we're human we're still in this flesh but we have to have the Holy Spirit that places this flesh in submission when the inside the one inside is one that has control of the one on the outside not the one that outside controls the one on the inside but the one on the inside the Holy Spirit has control of what you are doing put more time or dedicate more time in the things of God and die what did Paul say I Die daily daily daily when you die there's a new birth after baptism after baptism wherever you find yourself in your car in your home at your job matter where you are you listen to the word of God and God is giving you a baptism he's giving you of his grace of his mercy of his love he's caring for you how many of us want this tonight and the time has gone by but I want to leave you with this brother Bernie says we have to reach a certain point where you're at the altar you're completely surrendered to God because he's not going to come if you still have your own thoughts you have to leave it all that let nothing matter any when you reach that point in your life when God that's when God can do the work but the work of the devil is to try to take that time away steal that opportunity and it's constant The Young Ones especially nowadays there's so many things on the internet this thing it's a door to the fourth dimension where all things everything bad comes from and if you have no control a notification Facebook then we're on Facebook or see whose birthday it is then later we're looking at a video that we shouldn't be looking at and there the devil is stealing time and one hour goes by brother it's happened to me I'm the first one it's only the time goes by when we couldn't even listen to a 30 minute message then we make the excuse I don't have time I don't have time because something is taking our time away but nowadays let us wake up because we got to ask for God to come and take control of our Spirits so that he can have the preeminence in our lives please stand let us pray you have a need tonight I'm a witness and I'm standing here as a witness ask to God because he is just and faithful give us what we need on this night Father Here we are we ask Lord that you come to every heart father Lord we've made mistakes Lord we are humans sometimes we trip Lord but we get back up your word gives us encouragement and life Here We Are Holy Father we know that we're living in the end time we know that the time is at hand but Lord we want to be part of that bride we want to go with you father this world has nothing to give us so that we give everything to you father Lord bless this church bless every person here hly father person who's watching us online Holy Father that they may have in their heart Supply it Lord you're good and kind and I give you thanks father for what you do and for what you will do thank you for my pastor give him strength give him the strength bless his
