[39:51] Valentina and so I looked up I had
[39:53] looked up a story as well get them in
[39:55] booze go next Dora
[39:55] and so I I uh I found one you gota de
[39:58] una to share with you there come
[40:00] particular studies and I don't know how
[40:01] accurate it might be you know second toe
[40:04] canto server that I got from a History
[40:07] Channel pull a video in canal de story
[40:09] and so uh hopefully it has a sense of
[40:12] accuracy but he is better getting a book
[40:14] with a lot and so I want to share with
[40:17] you a couple con ustedes meses and I
[40:19] gave a version mister dr. Emoto universe
[40:22] soon and now
[40:23] want to give a little bit around that
[40:24] version you kiddo there or not there
[40:26] were some simulator and so say st.
[40:29] Valentine
[40:30] so it's an Santo Valentin you know he
[40:32] was uh he was there they say in the
[40:34] third century did a nice little dress
[40:37] there said Sigler and so Claudius he
[40:40] Claudio he was there the second mr.
[40:42] Wilson he was in charge of during that
[40:44] time delay darkest hour in Colorado
[40:46] listen and so during that time he had
[40:47] the soldiers is a Templeton especial
[40:49] Davos and he thought that it would be
[40:50] more efficient okay okay bastard mejor
[40:52] it'd be a lot better said I'm a
[40:55] ban marriages
[40:56] you know IBM matrimony Oz and so because
[40:58] maybe his soldiers will be less
[41:00] distracted person seen in matrimonial
[41:02] mahalo so does to be line menos destroy
[41:04] those and so they'd be more ready to
[41:06] work my god Melissa Spa trabajar their
[41:07] minds wouldn't be somewhere else
[41:09] it meant a no Viren start repairing
[41:10] because you can think but Westminster
[41:12] you know a father you don't Padre having
[41:14] his family at home they were so familiar
[41:15] and Tsukasa
[41:16] you know being away start lejos you know
[41:18] maybe he's always thinking about his
[41:19] family the more simple stop patellar su
[41:21] familia in a split second a decision can
[41:23] come Louis a window not easy on pasa and
[41:25] then he might be distracted it was the
[41:26] other horses trying you know might cost
[41:28] something for the kick-out shall go may
[41:30] be so this was the thinking of Katya I'm
[41:31] horror stuff well ok pensaba Chloe so he
[41:33] banned marriages so L remove your Tolos
[41:35] Louis my team on you and so Valentine
[41:37] thought that this was unfair
[41:38] so Valentin do Castano Nora who story
[41:41] you don't want anything to do with that
[41:42] look at the another in a castle Coney so
[41:45] so what he did so lo que le
[41:46] if so he will arrange secret marriages
[41:49] la pena matrimonio San secreto so he
[41:51] married people Kesava hinted you know
[41:53] outside of the law where a de la ley so
[41:56] to make them happy but I said Los Feliz
[41:59] because he thought that that was just
[42:00] for here ok ok so a justo so and so he
[42:03] went to jail so if a la cárcel and the
[42:05] one in charge their ilk is nine karela
[42:07] day he had a daughter at dinner and I
[42:08] Iike and so Valentine you saw Valentin
[42:10] fell in love with the daughter say in a
[42:13] moralist weeka and so the time came so
[42:15] Campo and a long time
[42:18] there you see by Marie Valentin and so
[42:20] there he died and this case a moody era
[42:24] he left a letter l de una Carta signed
[42:26] ok with mother your Valentine to
[42:29] Valentin and so from there you know that
[42:31] is AE
[42:32] we get the ideas to write letters Lola
[42:34] lay there they escribir carpet ask me
[42:36] to be our Valentine rotunda in KCK
[42:38] densetsu amigos reminded us and dr. list
[42:42] records Oh
[42:44] being in school it's not on escuela we
[42:46] handed out cards step Adamo star hit us
[42:48] or even older now
[42:49] what a little more to have you give some
[42:51] cards dan was Curtis that hit so that's
[42:53] how that origin came from je no the way
[42:56] so and so it says all he died from love
[42:58] they say que él murió Palin gave his
[42:59] life for love and your stupid a pour
[43:01] l'amour so he he loved the people around
[43:03] La MaMa doors down and then and so he
[43:05] was going to die so estaba dispersed
[43:07] amore
[43:08] he was willing to do what everybody was
[43:09] against it that exposed to say look at
[43:11] toast iran-contra to make them happy but
[43:13] I'm sad Los Feliz and so and then we
[43:15] bring that to us so I pretty much try
[43:17] monster nosotros it's the same with the
[43:18] Lord Jesus Christ
[43:19] Romy's what can you see what hay-zu
[43:20] Cristo no he died él murió I know for us
[43:23] right well no so truce now we make that
[43:24] personal yes a most so personal and
[43:26] sometimes that stuff is ever say so
[43:28] there's some but it's it's tough for me
[43:32] for me or assess your what I owe it was
[43:35] a really get that in my head the pony
[43:37] show me cabeza
[43:38] you know the Lord Jesus Christ died for
[43:39] me is he a so mr. moody up for me but I
[43:42] couldn't really grab onto that you know
[43:44] you know well you ain't in there is you
[43:45] know what does it mean that or Jesus
[43:46] Christ died for me it's anything I came
[43:48] to do poor me so I would I'd have that
[43:50] thought a lot sitting here suppose I'm
[43:51] in too much um to me a lot what does
[43:53] that mean medium which was a picture my
[43:54] Tamim in the case in Africa I mean I get
[43:56] that he died on the cross
[43:57] yo you and gained okay mood even like
[43:59] cruise I understand that you and you
[44:01] into it so well there was there's more
[44:03] to it than that but in a cave it must a
[44:05] so there's a lot more to it than that I
[44:06] must ask
[44:07] so being young so siendo haben I
[44:09] couldn't grab onto that no I'll put the
[44:11] intend there you know the Lord Jesus
[44:12] Christ died for me so his system would
[44:14] up for me and so seeing stories like
[44:16] this so they end o story has come West
[44:18] maybe seeing stories that make letter
[44:19] that come that our other than the cross
[44:21] or a story SK Evelyn de la Cruz there
[44:24] are apart from the cross or is this una
[44:26] parte de la Cruz do you know when you
[44:27] see different examples with different as
[44:29] a him plus and so you start to put many
[44:31] different things together and what
[44:32] police cosa diferentes juntos you know
[44:34] we saw a story last night
[44:35] you motion historian oj o our Father
[44:38] they won't Padre who had to choose
[44:40] between his son and and a train full of
[44:42] people take it to what Casey they sue
[44:44] echo own train lleno de gente so there
[44:46] was a bridge of yeah own what
[44:50] and he had to choose whether he was
[44:52] gonna there was a bridge lift it up and
[44:54] he had to choose I be a teeny a case
[44:57] cohere IV I own Puente Levantado and
[44:59] there was a boat passing then when they
[45:01] had passed young bar cookie work area
[45:03] pasado and that's why they had lifted up
[45:04] the bridge but I say we had another ill
[45:06] okay point and and so because of this I
[45:10] por esto there was a train coming
[45:12] I've been turning Kevin here you know
[45:13] filled with people you know the hint day
[45:14] that the father did not know Caleb are
[45:16] there no Sevilla and so and in this
[45:18] train coming it was ahead of schedule
[45:20] yes very linear vignette temprano and so
[45:22] then the son does El Hijo saw this boa
[45:25] esto and so he ran to the track yell
[45:28] Cory hasta los dos come here and so
[45:32] heated to pull a lever so that the
[45:36] bridge para que el puente would come
[45:38] down to Sarah and the people would be
[45:40] saved in a subir a salvo instead of you
[45:42] know flying off the bridge Oh por que su
[45:44] parent kind of the people would have
[45:47] died or like it's stuck it's only Costa
[45:50] Torah and the fall has to choose to save
[45:52] his son yet palutena KCDC para su eco I
[45:55] was gonna save all these people who are
[45:57] so better to us the hint a and so we
[45:58] bring that to the Lord Jesus Christ when
[46:00] he must have so Cristo with with our God
[46:02] when I stole the ocean you had to make a
[46:03] choice you must guess this is shown to
[46:05] save his son yeah Salva rasoi ho or save
[46:08] the world of silver el mundo and so
[46:09] different examples like this so
[46:11] different is the hemp was come Wednesday
[46:12] you know it made me think makes up
[46:13] inside he died for us with your nose
[46:15] otro you start to see examples a best
[46:17] doses Jose hand blue you start to see
[46:19] how how hard it was
[46:20] get a faeces way because we talk a lot
[46:22] about the sacrifice almost which are
[46:23] their sacrificial what about the three
[46:25] days the low stress Diaz when the father
[46:28] was suffering when the mr. palace to go
[46:30] sufriendo losing his only son but en de
[46:32] su único he only única Nieto and so
[46:36] there they show an image I ain't seein a
[46:38] man in my hand with with the father
[46:39] cradling his son go to father
[46:41] I don't know su hijo no dead mirto and
[46:44] though he they were crying out yeah

[46:58] there but in the law and si I can't
[46:59] imagine what that feels like I'm making
[47:01] that kisses in there so and so
[47:03] then he chose to save us his son yes
[47:06] course Allen oscillated equal neither
[47:08] his son died for us so I started that's
[47:12] more things like examples like that
[47:13] massive hubris como si you start to
[47:15] paint a picture for me we stand upon a
[47:17] todo who Tony meant a and so banquets
[47:19] like the ones that we have events I
[47:20] wanna banquette xi ok tuvimos you know
[47:22] they start they help us out in some way

[47:30] digo to come over beggar and be a part
[47:33] of the youth it's an oportunity grupo
[47:35] human you know it's for our benefit it's
[47:36] part of beneficio it helps little by

[48:04] we're there with them don't say I
[48:06] couldn't use we're talking about three
[48:07] stages of grace until I stretch the top
[48:09] of the grass trying to put that inside
[48:11] their head put iteration to scott into a
[48:13] mentee so what it's like the que trata
[48:15] our examples there's a handful different
[48:17] examples in the Bible different is a him
[48:18] plus an Habib Allah and so that's what
[48:20] we're what bringing is okay Thomas
[48:22] triangle and so with this morning it's
[48:23] the hard way oh it's more this morning
[48:27] we talked about the Apostle Paul but
[48:29] almost a la post of public and so we
[48:30] talked about his origin I'm at the own
[48:32] Devon year and so the Apostle Paul so
[48:34] i'll a post or Pablo being a
[48:36] pure-blooded Jew
[48:38] siento who do was from the tribe of
[48:41] Benjamin yeah they'll three by the way I
[48:43] mean so uh we've said this before and
[48:45] was the tres bon and then he was born a
[48:46] free born elsewhere Saucedo so he were
[48:50] here that the right to choose whatever
[48:51] you want to be Oh a will they see deal
[48:53] okay okay I said so he didn't have to he
[48:55] wasn't born into a certain trade you
[48:57] know thing like I said I'll go
[48:58] specifically you know he the choice to
[49:01] do what he wanted Alton yeah let's he's
[49:02] on the sale okay okay yeah you know like
[49:04] all of our students go most nurses to
[49:06] the others they have the choice to do
[49:07] whatever they want to do can I say that
[49:08] said okay you're scarin
[49:09] and so Apostle Paul la posta Pablo went
[49:12] to a school where on escuela that was
[49:14] the best of the best
[49:16] mr. Kemal come oh come in here and so
[49:18] he's studying studying under there him
[49:20] stop wise together so like a Harvard or
[49:23] stand for something like that more
[49:25] common escuelas Harvard or Stanford you
[49:26] know the big school is the big names as
[49:28] well as grandest that's the type of
[49:30] school that the Apostle Paul went to
[49:31] sixty Pasquale a Calif way and he
[49:32] memorized the law if anybody saw he knew
[49:35] the law of the Old Testament at supalen
[49:36] al Testament he knew he knew all of it
[49:39] yes who else have you told
[49:40] so that's what he studied yesterday
[49:42] Aloha gales s to do and so he grew up
[49:44] he's worth courtesy oh you know learning
[49:47] the law lay opinion de la ley and so
[49:49] when he was taught
[49:50] okay elf way and say yellow was that the
[49:52] the followers of Christ can say he
[49:54] dollars decreased or were the enemies of
[49:56] Jehovah hello Ellen los enemigos did
[49:58] Cuba and so that's why he persecuted the
[50:00] Christians yes police ok Elmo loose
[50:02] those Christian so that time being Saul
[50:04] of Tarsus yes Saul and so uh he he
[50:10] wasn't Paul yet have any way that Pablo
[50:12] and so but hey you know brother branham
[50:14] talks about a story in Melbourne our
[50:16] brother next door yeah and so here I
[50:18] want to read a quote from from brother
[50:20] branham mercy hakuna does he tell their
[50:23] mother Brenda you know it was preached
[50:25] in 1957 where you know my sin to sink
[50:28] what they said its title Hebrews chapter
[50:30] one they said where I was capital oh no
[50:32] and I'm gonna jump around a little bit
[50:34] in this quote my Mobarak in but this and
[50:37] so this is an exhaust even died under
[50:39] the rocks Amira I stare when Marie de
[50:42] bajo las Piedras being stoned to death
[50:44] eternal eternal miss cuando fuera de la
[50:47] muerte no I think he must have got um
[50:49] next to Paul when he saw Stephen raised
[50:52] his hands to heaven yeah a little
[50:54] Harlequin saw a public on the u.s. there
[50:58] when they went Ursus Manasa Cielo season
[51:00] I see that heavens open I see Jesus
[51:02] standing at the right hand of God
[51:04] yo shadows appreciative artists whisper
[51:06] Allah yesterday Dios
[51:07] and he said yelled equal this is
[51:09] speaking of Stephen I don't know they
[51:10] step on father father
[51:12] lay not this charge of sin against them
[51:13] noticing with this piccolo I use he says
[51:16] and he fell asleep he said o Romeo
[51:18] that's how the scripture says right he
[51:20] didn't feel anymore
[51:21] yeah no Cynthia that's well that's why
[51:22] brother Branham says okay you set him on
[51:24] a brother and we jump ahead it was more
[51:26] almost empty there is something
[51:28] Paul I'll go respected Pablo
[51:31] then he any man under conviction what
[51:37] kid hombre bajo convict Co so no he's
[51:38] trouble
[51:39] he was their brother Branham says that
[51:42] this is when he began to change a key
[51:44] this element when a case called Olympus
[51:46] or a cambiar or something something
[51:47] started to affect him I go into traffic
[51:49] dar so something start to get to him I
[51:50] go leave alimentive and I started to get
[51:53] him back and forth he stopped coming to
[51:55] lament it so maybe he was there
[51:57] I'm putting least away and he just
[51:58] couldn't stop thinking about oh yeah but
[52:00] other benefits out of this is that the
[52:01] man that this man was on his knees s
[52:03] they don't waste time ensues through the
[52:04] years you know being stoned it's not the
[52:06] end of the other and then he's yelling
[52:07] out there yeah lista commando you know
[52:09] Lord forgive them yours paternalism
[52:12] don't charge them with this sin listen
[52:14] put this este picado no leave them alone
[52:16] forgive them Lord
[52:17] they hello solos because they knows
[52:19] because they don't know what they're
[52:20] doing ok you know stomach acid and and
[52:22] their paw their saw yeah so standing
[52:25] there but although he you know you
[52:27] imagine this scene and my healer sister
[52:29] Cinna where he's just seeing there
[52:31] someone praying for him
[52:32] must I can do I can cast out on the
[52:33] forehead he's thinking whoa how is this
[52:35] possible if they're pretending all my
[52:37] stress possible how was it possible that
[52:38] someone's praying for me just gay
[52:40] against a or and up for me and you know
[52:41] we know that shortly after this you
[52:43] seven most gay booked oh this place test
[52:45] oh you know he's on his way to Damascus
[52:47] starting coming out Damascus so he's
[52:49] there on his way extend Camino and we
[52:52] know the story seven was I stole yeah
[52:53] well he's knocked down okay a spoon
[52:55] bottle and then were they he's there saw
[52:58] saw why not persecuted to me days
[53:01] support came Perseus and then this he is
[53:03] he's there on the ground I extended
[53:05] peaceful and then we know that from
[53:06] there
[53:07] he's a mosaic that the Lord takes him
[53:08] killed singer look Toma you know and
[53:10] tells him that he's gonna be Paul Lisa
[53:13] cave I said and that's where he said he
[53:15] I've called you that day yeah model you
[53:17] know that's what we read a little bit of
[53:18] that better stone and he was called get
[53:22] for your mother you're a call to be an
[53:23] apostille for yeah well that's they're
[53:24] not posted and so there we bring up
[53:27] justification Irene was like who Steve
[53:29] Akashi on you know a he did nothing for
[53:30] it and noise so another Perez you know
[53:32] he did nothing for just turned the
[53:34] justification at all
[53:35] you know same NaCl obviously because you
[53:36] you know he did nothing for it annoys
[53:38] own apparatus fearless but he was
[53:40] justified but it was difficult
[53:42] about justifications because that was
[53:43] the acoustical ceiling you know our
[53:44] brother Bernie mr. ma no baby talks and
[53:47] he says oh we do nothing for
[53:49] justification so there's no sin was not
[53:51] a part of who is difficult you know when
[53:53] he's when Lauren Jesus Christ was on the
[53:54] cross he was doing like Cruz you know
[53:57] the cross cast a shadow
[53:58] kristinia una Sombra you know we know
[54:00] that somos s so and so and us being

[54:05] they are bolus you know the a tree when
[54:07] audible feels comfortable under the
[54:09] shade se siente Agusta bajo de la sombra

[54:23] position that we're in like we're stoked
[54:25] estamos we feel comfortable mr. Gustavo
[54:27] we've been justified so much difficultly
[54:29] I've been baptized they see the bhakti

[56:59] who's and last time we were up here you
[57:01] laughing or asked us to Becky no we

[57:04] likely dude and we brought up a poem
[57:06] yeah yeah Liam poem about by Charles
[57:09] swindle the Charles swindle you know any
[57:11] King and I read it again you know lay
[57:14] universe mass and I thought reading it

[57:19] an impact it would have an impact today
[57:21] I'm we importante
[57:23] and so like like we're saying most on

[57:28] of the cross it can get a little Sombra
[57:30] de la Cruz it reads here aquele
[57:32] the longer I live lo mas que Viva the
[57:35] more I realize the mass Carelli so the
[57:38] impact of attitude on life el impacto de
[57:41] lucky to it in la vida and if our
[57:42] musicians could come up to pass ellos mu
[57:44] psychosis is the attitude to me likely
[57:47] to it and para me is more important than
[57:49] facts it's most important take a loss a
[57:51] chose it is more important than the past
[57:53] amazing pirata yellow pasado and
[57:55] education el azucar soon and money at
[57:58] the narrow and circumstances classical
[58:00] stands yes and failures
[58:01] Ellis fires and success and exit on what
[58:03] other people might say you think or lo
[58:05] que los a Mazda and this year this is
[58:07] the remarkable thing
[58:08] lo mas importante is we have a choice
[58:10] every day okay dolls yes tenemos una
[58:12] decisión regarding the attitude tomando
[58:14] likely to you know we can be they're
[58:16] comfortable I'm gonna study on the
[58:18] shadow of the Cross in la sombra de la
[58:20] Cruz but it's all about our attitude
[58:21] right depending you're stuck dude if you
[58:23] want to get off the shadow of the cross
[58:24] you can a much about how they lie they
[58:26] somebody like Cruz we cannot change it
[58:28] reads the point most can be already said

[58:32] gonna happen the player must come belly
[58:34] in every tablet so the only thing we can
[58:36] do love it like Oh someone can keep
[58:37] almost I said it's Rudy we can do is
[58:41] play on this one string that we have
[58:43] they talk a lot like what I kept an
[58:45] image so that's our attitude it says
