[25:49] Lord how many are thankful for this nice
[25:51] weather we've been getting
[25:54] lately it's a quite beautiful night we
[25:57] have
[25:59] would be so kind of please open up your
[26:03] scriptures we'll be going to the Bas
[26:05] scripture we've been using which can be
[26:06] found in Revelations 320 to
[26:16] [Music]
[26:19] 22 and before we go into our
[26:23] scripture I just want to take some time
[26:26] to thank our pastor
[26:29] uh for the opportunity he gives me to be
[26:31] here in front of
[26:32] you you know we all go through
[26:35] tests and I'm going through one right
[26:38] now you know am I going to be
[26:41] obedient and so here I am so it's a
[26:44] small victory for
[26:46] me but it's also a victory for each one
[26:48] of you who are here
[26:50] tonight so do we have the
[26:52] scripture and the scripture
[26:55] reads behold I stand at the door and
[26:58] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[27:00] the door I will come into him and will
[27:02] sub with him and he with
[27:12] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[27:15] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[27:17] also overcame and him sat down with me
[27:19] in my father in his
[27:26] throne
[27:28] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[27:30] spirit says unto the
[27:34] churches you so kindly please by our
[27:37] heads dear heavenly
[27:40] father L we thank you for this
[27:42] opportunity you give us
[27:44] Lord we thank you for letting us have a
[27:46] place where we can
[27:50] congregate and we thank you for another
[27:52] day of
[27:54] life now I ask that you be with me as
[27:56] your word comes forth
[28:01] I pull myself to the
[28:03] side maybe you speaking to your
[28:07] people be with
[28:08] me be with my
[28:10] interpreter and be with the audience
[28:12] who's listening
[28:14] Lord give everyone the portion that
[28:16] they're looking for
[28:18] Lord so I ask you all this Lord and I
[28:22] thank you in the precious name of Lord
[28:23] Jesus
[28:24] Christ amen amen you may take your seats
[28:31] so as you can tell we're continuing in
[28:32] the topic of how can I
[28:37] overcome you know it's something that we
[28:39] repeat and we repeat and we
[28:42] repeat but I believe we're a
[28:45] people that believe that in
[28:48] repetition that's where we'll find our
[28:51] Revelation so it's always good to repeat
[28:54] these
[28:55] things and I'd like to start off by by
[28:57] reading a quote by brother
[29:00] brandham you know every day there's a
[29:02] quote of the
[29:05] day and this one came about I think a
[29:07] couple weeks
[29:09] ago you know and I saved it because when
[29:12] I read
[29:13] it I felt that it was it was perfect for
[29:16] the topic of how can I
[29:19] overcome you know and it's from the
[29:21] message God's covenant with Abraham and
[29:23] his
[29:26] seed preach in
[29:29] 1956 and it says says God doesn't make
[29:33] any difference between his
[29:36] children he says every son that cometh
[29:38] to God must first be tried or
[29:45] chastised says you get it says first be
[29:48] tried or chastened corrected child
[29:51] trained schooled everyone no
[29:54] [Music]
[29:56] exception
[30:03] he says every son then he asked have you
[30:05] went through
[30:07] trials he says have you went through
[30:11] tribulation he says have you suffered
[30:14] persecution he says then you're endure
[30:17] those
[30:19] things he says then you're a real
[30:21] children of
[30:23] God says but when you can't bear
[30:26] chastisement
[30:28] says when the rod comes down
[30:31] heavy and you run off back into the
[30:33] world says the Bible said you're
[30:35] illegitimate children and not the
[30:37] children of
[30:41] God says for when a man is born of the
[30:43] spirit of
[30:47] God he expects those
[30:50] things and he loves those
[30:53] things and the Bible says the trials
[30:55] that come upon us Fury trials is is more
[30:57] precious than gold to
[31:05] us he says think of it what captured my
[31:09] attention from this
[31:12] quote is where he says we we expect
[31:15] those
[31:16] things and we love those things so then
[31:19] it's my
[31:21] understanding that I have to expect to
[31:23] be
[31:25] tried but I also have to love the
[31:28] trials and know that's something very
[31:30] difficult but we should expect
[31:33] that you know and how can I
[31:36] overcome in part three by Brother
[31:39] Bernie you know he giv us an
[31:42] example he talks about
[31:44] students when he says that we're
[31:47] students he says there's students who
[31:49] like to go to
[31:51] school you know maybe like to a certain
[31:54] class but when they hear that there's
[31:56] going to be a test
[31:58] they begin to get
[32:00] nervous and they want to run away from
[32:02] the
[32:03] test and he says you can you can say
[32:05] you're a good
[32:07] student you can say you're
[32:10] learning you say you can fool your other
[32:14] classmates he says but when the test
[32:16] comes that's when you
[32:18] know if you're really learning or
[32:21] not and brother Bernie has told us he
[32:25] says that we are students
[32:28] he says we're studying the most
[32:29] tremendous message has ever
[32:33] been he says we're also in the most
[32:35] tremendous
[32:37] age he says but we have the need of
[32:39] standing the
[32:41] test you know and I can relate to
[32:45] that because when I was in
[32:48] school maybe you know you can you maybe
[32:51] you find a way to get a good grade on a
[32:56] quiz
[32:57] or maybe uh maybe on an
[33:01] assignment but then when it comes down
[33:03] to the actual
[33:06] exam you're you get
[33:08] nervous because you know if you need to
[33:11] pass
[33:12] this before maybe you got by with I
[33:15] don't know using
[33:18] Google or using online to help you with
[33:20] your
[33:23] homework but when it comes to the
[33:25] exam it's just you and the
[33:28] exam that's when you find out if you
[33:30] really know what you're talking
[33:34] about and that's the way that's the way
[33:36] with me as a
[33:38] Christian you know I can say I'm a good
[33:40] Christian I can say that I
[33:43] believe but when the test comes and my
[33:46] faith is
[33:47] tested that's when I'll really find
[33:50] out where I'm standing you know and I
[33:53] like the example brother Bernie gives
[33:55] us he says when we have a
[33:59] test he in other words he says God
[34:03] descends down to
[34:05] earth and he says here's my son my son
[34:09] Antonio
[34:11] maybe my son Moises he says I'm going to
[34:15] allow him to be
[34:17] tested he says to show Satan that he's
[34:19] my
[34:21] son and that he can stand the
[34:24] test so that's when we receive test
[34:28] it's God coming
[34:30] down and saying here's my
[34:33] son and he's allowed to be
[34:35] tested so he can prove that he's my
[34:39] son so we have to
[34:41] overcome you know and we've been taught
[34:43] many
[34:45] times you know repeating it once
[34:48] again overcome means to stand the
[34:51] test you know and I focused on that word
[34:55] stand you you know I found a definition
[34:57] for
[34:58] it and it's to be able to endure or
[35:06] tolerate and the word I like
[35:09] there the word the word I like is
[35:12] endure and endure has very interesting
[35:18] definition one that I
[35:20] found it says to suffer
[35:25] patiently another one I found
[35:28] it's to remain firm under suffering or
[35:30] Misfortune without
[35:36] yielding you know without yielding so
[35:40] you're going through something
[35:42] tough something painful something
[35:45] difficult but you're being
[35:47] patient you're you're
[35:50] yielding you're not giving up it doesn't
[35:53] mean it doesn't mean that it doesn't
[35:55] hurt
[35:57] but you're not giving
[35:59] up so you know lately we've had some
[36:03] rain and I know it's it's been all right
[36:07] you know actually
[36:08] recently you know I was driving on the
[36:12] freeway and I got caught I got caught by
[36:15] the
[36:16] rain and so I turned on my windshield
[36:21] wipers and just a couple minutes went
[36:24] by and uh my windshield wiper just B
[36:28] away and I was on the
[36:30] freeway and I I couldn't really see but
[36:34] I kept going you know sometimes we walk
[36:37] by
[36:39] faith but I had to drive by
[36:42] faith and I say that because when a
[36:45] storm
[36:46] comes it makes things difficult it makes
[36:49] things hard to
[36:51] see and that's what I'm getting at and
[36:55] so when I thought about this
[36:57] I thought about how here in
[36:59] Phoenix Pho or in Arizona you know we
[37:02] have what we call monsoon
[37:05] season you know this is when we get a
[37:07] lot of
[37:08] rain a lot of wind we have lightning we
[37:12] have
[37:13] thunder and once it
[37:16] happens you know there's always a lot of
[37:18] you know effects of
[37:20] it you know you go outside and there's
[37:23] maybe damaged
[37:25] houses you know there's damaged um cars
[37:29] you know the streets are real
[37:31] dirty but something you notice a
[37:35] lot is a lot of broken down
[37:38] trees you know you go
[37:41] outside and everywhere you
[37:43] look there's trees that have fallen
[37:45] over because of the storm but to me
[37:49] what's
[37:51] remarkable is when you can see a
[37:53] tree that maybe it's not the biggest
[37:55] tree
[37:57] but it withstood the
[37:59] storm no the storm
[38:02] came and it's still
[38:05] standing now maybe it lost all of its
[38:08] leaves maybe it broke a couple
[38:13] branches but the tree is still
[38:16] standing you know and that's like like
[38:18] we
[38:19] are you know the storm
[38:21] comes no if we're like
[38:23] trees no maybe we break a branch
[38:28] maybe we break we lose
[38:30] leaves but what's
[38:32] important is that we're still
[38:34] standing you know and you look at the
[38:36] tree and you say why is it still
[38:39] standing it's because it's well
[38:42] rooted and that's the way we have to be
[38:44] as
[38:45] well we have to be well rooted in the
[38:49] word and you know thinking of
[38:51] trees know there's things that they need
[38:53] in order to
[38:55] survive you know they need
[38:58] sunlight they need
[39:00] water they need
[39:02] nutrients you know we also need
[39:05] light we need the light of the Gospel
[39:08] the light of the
[39:09] word we need that water as well but not
[39:13] just any water that living water and we
[39:17] also need our
[39:18] nutrients we need that that food at its
[39:20] due
[39:22] time but something interesting about
[39:25] trees know if you have
[39:28] one and you want it to grow
[39:32] properly then you have to prune
[39:37] it and when you prune a
[39:39] tree uh you remove the dead branches
[39:41] from
[39:45] it or you remove branches that are um
[39:48] stopping it from growing
[39:51] properly so if we're like
[39:53] trees and we want to grow properly
[39:58] we also have to get
[40:01] pruned so we have to lose those dead
[40:04] branches we have to lose those things
[40:06] that are stopping us from
[40:08] growing but the tree doesn't prune
[40:12] itself someone has to come and prune
[40:16] it so someone has to come and prune
[40:20] us and at first it may not look
[40:24] pretty you know a tree sometimes when
[40:25] you prune it
[40:28] and you know the seasons are
[40:30] changing you know it looks all
[40:34] bald it looks very ugly but when spring
[40:37] comes
[40:39] along then it begins to
[40:42] bloom that's the same with us we'll
[40:45] Bloom as well and we bring in those
[40:49] fruits but we need to be like those
[40:52] trees and so overcome means to stand the
[40:55] test
[40:57] and the other thing we
[40:58] know is overcome means to recognize the
[41:01] devil in every one of his
[41:04] tricks you know brother bam has told us
[41:07] we have to recognize that there's a real
[41:10] devil that he's as real as you or
[41:14] anybody and you have to recognize them
[41:16] as
[41:17] real you know and brother Bernie tells
[41:20] us he says the matter with
[41:23] people is that they don't recognize the
[41:25] devil
[41:27] and one way I look at
[41:29] it is sometimes we don't want to
[41:31] recognize the
[41:33] devil because we don't want to give him
[41:36] credit we don't want to
[41:39] admit that he's
[41:41] strong brother Bernie tells
[41:44] us that the devil he's powerful that
[41:48] he's a good
[41:49] adversary and he's a tremendous
[41:52] fighter but the way I look at it you
[41:55] know there's
[41:56] Sports you know there's always the two
[41:58] teams that make it to the
[42:01] finals you know there's team
[42:04] a and there's Team B you know you go to
[42:07] the fans of Team
[42:09] a and you tell them what do you think
[42:11] about Team
[42:13] B they're going to say Well they're
[42:16] trash oh they're good for nothing they
[42:19] don't have any good players you say all
[42:21] right okay and so then you go to Team
[42:24] B you what do you think about team
[42:27] hey oh they're good for nothing they're
[42:31] trash they don't know how to play and so
[42:34] you stand
[42:35] back and then you say well they both
[42:38] have to be
[42:40] lying because they're both in the
[42:43] finals so they must they both must be
[42:46] good but they don't want to admit that
[42:49] the other one is
[42:50] good because they feel it makes them
[42:53] look
[42:55] weak but that's us we don't want to
[42:58] admit that the devil is is
[43:01] real we think it makes us
[43:04] weak but we have to recognize
[43:07] him the Devil is a person brother Bernie
[43:09] tells
[43:11] us he's powerful he's a good adversary
[43:15] he's a tremendous
[43:17] fighter and I say he has to
[43:19] be he has to be powerful because just
[43:22] look at who he's going up
[43:24] against he's going against against the
[43:26] Sons and Daughters of
[43:28] God he has to be a good
[43:30] fighter because we're not something to
[43:33] be played
[43:35] with we're not something that's easy to
[43:37] get
[43:38] by we recognize the
[43:41] devil I think he recognizes as
[43:44] well but the difference is is he's a
[43:48] bluffer so he's going to act like he
[43:50] doesn't know that you're
[43:53] powerful but he knows you have power
[43:56] but we have to recognize the
[43:58] devil but something that I found
[44:01] interesting no is brother Bernie says
[44:03] how we sometimes fail to recognize the
[44:08] devil he says when you're
[44:10] sick he says you have to recognize that
[44:13] you're
[44:14] sick and it says maybe the doctor tells
[44:16] you you're
[44:18] sick and he say no no no I'm not
[44:20] sick he says when you do that you're not
[44:24] recognizing the devil you have to
[44:26] recognize that you're
[44:28] sick but at the same time you recognize
[44:31] that God is inside of
[44:33] you you
[44:36] remember that greater is he that is in
[44:39] you than he that is in the
[44:42] world so we have to do all
[44:46] that but here's the
[44:48] thing and this is maybe
[44:52] unfortunate or maybe it's a good
[44:54] thing you know the the devil is our
[44:57] adversary but he's not our biggest
[45:00] enemy you know brother bam tells
[45:04] us the thing you have to
[45:06] overcome is
[45:08] yourself is your
[45:10] ideas and it's your thing what your
[45:15] think that's what you have to
[45:17] overcome and so that leads me to
[45:21] believe to have an A a greater uh my
[45:24] biggest enemy
[45:27] and that's true you know the
[45:30] devil maybe he'll come against me but
[45:33] sometimes he has other people to go
[45:36] to so he's not always with me but my
[45:39] biggest
[45:41] enemy he's always with
[45:43] me you know in the morning when I wake
[45:45] up he's there with me at night when I go
[45:48] to
[45:49] sleep he's there with me as well you
[45:52] know when I look in the
[45:53] mirror you know I see him you know he's
[45:56] about this
[45:58] tall he looks all
[46:00] right but he's my biggest
[46:04] enemy and the thing about
[46:07] him you know is he has
[46:09] problems he has
[46:12] issues he has
[46:14] complexes you know sometimes he feels
[46:16] good sometimes he feels bad you know
[46:19] when he feels bad you know he bullies
[46:23] me you know he says things that bully
[46:26] would
[46:27] say you know he tells me you know you're
[46:29] not good
[46:33] enough he says uh nobody likes
[46:36] you he says you should give
[46:39] up and the thing about him is he's
[46:43] smart you know when I go out those
[46:46] doors and I greet my
[46:48] brothers you know he's
[46:51] quiet you know when I'm out having
[46:52] fellowship with my
[46:54] brothers
[46:56] no he's quiet but the moment I go to my
[47:00] car it's just me and
[47:02] him and we start to talk you know
[47:06] sometimes he tells me good things and
[47:08] sometimes he tells me bad things now
[47:11] sometimes I don't listen to
[47:12] him sometimes I do listen to him and
[47:15] sometimes I agree with
[47:18] him and that's the difficult part
[47:21] because sometimes you'll tell me
[47:22] something
[47:23] bad but and I agree with with
[47:27] him and it's tough but even though he's
[47:30] my biggest
[47:33] enemy you know the Bible tells me that I
[47:36] have to love my
[47:38] enemy so it's difficult for me to Love
[47:40] My
[47:41] Enemy in other words it's difficult for
[47:44] me to love
[47:46] myself but that's where I cry out to
[47:50] God and that's where I tell him help me
[47:53] you know this is really tough just give
[47:56] me the strength so I can keep
[47:58] fighting you know brother bam gives us
[48:00] the
[48:02] key he tells us that we have to
[48:05] surrender we have surrender ourselves to
[48:08] him he says he overcomes for
[48:10] you he knows the
[48:12] way we don't so I don't know the way he
[48:17] knows the way so I have to surrender
[48:19] myself to
[48:20] him if I want to overcome you know maybe
[48:24] we have other people here
[48:27] who also struggle fighting their biggest
[48:30] enemy that's when we have to seek out
[48:32] the
[48:33] scriptures you know when you're feeling
[48:35] sad you know we got to seek out the
[48:38] scripture when you're feeling
[48:40] happy look at the scriptures when you're
[48:43] feeling
[48:44] depressed go to the scriptures when
[48:47] you're feeling
[48:48] anxiety go to the scriptures when you're
[48:51] feeling sad go to the scriptures no and
[48:54] you feel like you need guidance
[48:58] go I like Proverbs
[49:01] 356 you know where we're
[49:04] told so trust in the Lord with all thine
[49:06] heart and lean not into thine own
[49:12] understanding in all thy ways
[49:14] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[49:19] paths so I need to stop lying on my
[49:22] relying on my own
[49:24] understanding
[49:27] acknowledge
[49:29] Him and and the Lord will direct my
[49:34] paths CU once
[49:36] again I don't know how to overcome but
[49:39] he does so I have to surrender my life
[49:41] to
[49:42] him so he can overcome through
[49:46] me and now since we're in this
[49:49] week you know we have a
[49:53] holiday you know it's Thanksgiving
[49:57] so I think it's only right that we
[49:58] Express
[50:01] gratitude no brother brother Bram tells
[50:04] us that for us Thanksgiving should be
[50:07] every
[50:09] day so I'm thankful for many things in
[50:11] my
[50:13] life but I'm thankful for those
[50:16] trials and that's a tough thing to
[50:18] say but I'm thankful for those
[50:21] trials and I'm thankful for our Lord
[50:23] Jesus
[50:24] Christ and like to take these last few
