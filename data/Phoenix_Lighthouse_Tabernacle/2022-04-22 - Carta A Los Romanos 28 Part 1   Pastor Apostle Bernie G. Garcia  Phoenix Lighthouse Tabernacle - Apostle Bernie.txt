TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] i greet each and every one of you in the precious name of our lord jesus christ we welcome each one of you [Music] so if you open up your bibles to romans chapter eight verse this is to continue on the subject of the letter to the romans number 28. mensah this is the eighth message that i have now on the manifestation of the sons of god for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of god now matthew 17. matthew 17. [Music] apart [Music] after six days jesus takes peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart was transfigured before them and his face shined at the sun and his remnant was white as a light and behold their appearance unto them moses and elias talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee one for moses one for elias while he yet spake behold the bride cloud overshadowed them and behold the voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son and who i am well pleased hear ye him now revelation 4 1. estas after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will show you things which must be hereafter father i present each person here along with us in your hands that you might be the one that takes control of everything and as your servant i take control over every spirit this morning and that you might permit that the word flow freely just as you have given it that which you have given to me in the name of the lord um [Music] we shall be is [Music] once again i want to recognize everyone visiting us this morning i've been noting something ever since i started this series i've been pointing towards something since i started [Music] you can't preach any higher than what you live i believe we have lived or we're going to be speaking on this morning we're going to be putting on a transparency here pyramid along with the capstone pyramid itself has seven uh parts two of seven steps going up [Music] and at the same time it's each individual the church has to have the headstone in order to be sealed the age to which martin luther was a messenger that's the beginning of the return again of the wheat plant that's the ace that produced the stock that's the fifth age like that's the wesley then the sixth h wesley's age we proved that that was the age that produced the castle then the seventh age is the layout church that produces the shock formed outside of the three steps it's separate from the three steps it's outside of the three steps [Applause] that's the eighth is even though we already mentioned that last sunday it's the head age headstone age it's the age of the eye it's a bright age it's the once again of the people of israel in their homeland in the time of the placing of god's children if you understand so far say amen just trying to see if you understand what i'm trying to say to teach something if it's not being understood so let's repeat all together as a class young man here of the matter is it's the word yourself just for you to think about it where the brain that's the age we're in now this is the wheat plant and then the fourth part is the grain la palabra the word el tiempo de adoption adoption time we're living in adoption time there must be an approval actually we're living in a very beautiful time we've read these two scriptures we've spoken up to what we said so far you understand amen we've seen how jesus god was take jesus took uh was taken by god up to a great high mountain and jesus took along with him three disciples when this took place one of three tabernacles to be built that revelation that had been given uh [Music] these greeks said we would see jesus is [Music] when he is glorified [Music] [Music] [Laughter] can you say amen a few codes do the holy spirit seals you in with christ then you become one you become one see you and christ live together in me then that's a sealed unit of the lord god now and then they are vindicated and placed when that takes place they become vindicated sons and daughters of god page 23 24. uh to raise it [Music] but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then that son was adopted page 24. elijah and that's what god was doing on non-transfiguration when he took his own son after he had been proven to be the right son see and had stood all temptations he took him up on non-transfiguration and overshadowed him you know in the old testament they took a son dressed him in a nice pretty garment and set him out before the public and they had a ceremony of placing or we call it adopting now by placing a sun in other words the sun was a sun when he was born [Laughter] being born into the family by the holy ghost that's right but then we must be the right kind of children tutored by the right tutor page 25. now when jesus had been obedient jesus to god placed him positionally this is he this is him [Music] [Laughter] now when the member is born by the holy ghost into the family of god and has proven to have these this virtues in him then god can see virtual knowledge temperance patience brotherly kindness and godliness in him then god seals him or places him and there that's when you see the sons and daughters of god amen that's what the pentecostals make their mistake i'd like to call your attention to that tengo tengo this is one thing the prophet says of the family of god and has proven that to have this virtues in him then god can see beautiful virgin so where is faith why didn't he place faith did he forget faith because when he's born is those are god's children when he places the office of sun the sunshine the sun i'll repeat it again it's when god [Music] people say i wish i could hear nature crying out he's got ears he wants to hear filament just take the newspaper earthquake in mexico city in new york hurricane in new york in puerto rico flood in puerto rico what is it nature's groaning cry not yelling our creation is growing we're living in we understand that god used a vessel man called william branham he became god's mouth can you say man [Music] reach i'm reading directly from the english question would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture that's what's going on right now the blood of christ certainly it is the message she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors is that right teacher he should have now apostle prophet teacher evangelist pastor school how many am i referring to president apostles teachers please amen but the bible speaks about pastors i respect brothers i've always [Music] the bible says when the holy ghost has come you don't need any teacher he's the teacher himself oh brother how can you be so low from reading the scripture why did the holy ghost set teachers in the church then this is true [Music] see i don't have to have anybody teach me the holy ghost teaches me it does in the church can you say amen jeffersonville october 15 1961 if you can't respect a man respect the office he holds in god respected respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect him i've heard congregations talk about their pastor how they just talk write him down and ridicule him how is that pastor ever going to do anything for you he can't do it if you run your pastor down ridicule him and so forth he cannot help you you we're gonna have to ask for the brother won't be so dry [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
