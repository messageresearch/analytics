great to put this and this is dear Lord Heavenly Father foreign yes correctas bless everyone in the internet foreign [Music] [Music] high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands say none of this building neither by the blood of goats but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained internal Redemption is or if the blood of impulse and of goats and the ashes of the heifer are sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh is how much more shall the blood of Christ who through eternal spirit offers himself without spot to God foreign sientos um Brothers wanted us to speak on the topic of redemption and I asked myself what more could I add to this topic the Brothers performing I've covered this topic very well speaking honestly I don't think I can foreign but it wasn't until recently that's what reminded me that in order to learn something once is not enough uh do you understand something deeply it has to be gone over and over until it becomes a part of us um and also we're going over this topic because we know that there are people here but do not listen um and I will confess I am one of those people you're welcome um but the main reason the important reason important while we're constantly speaking about this topic it's because we're living in the last age which is perhaps the most dangerous age of them all the brothers before me gone over numerous times Redemption is withstanding the test but what tests the test against ourselves now the Devil is a great adversary but he is not our worst enemy our worst enemy is ourselves the devil has no real power over us he can't force us to do what he wants the only thing he can do put dark thoughts into our heads it is us who accept and act on those thoughts so don't think for a second that we're innocent in this our hands are just as filthy you know going back to what I said about the devil's power problem all right he doesn't have any real power he cannot touch so much is breathe on us without permission and whose permission you might ask God's permission and I've heard people ask if he needs God's permission why does God grant it the reason why God grants him permission so that we can grow stronger from it because Redemption is more than just withstanding the test it is recognizing every trick the devil has not falling prey to it because when we make a mistake and we feel bad about it truly feel bad about it we won't make that same mistake because if there's any universal truth out there is that suffering the fire that forges One Soul into steel is um and going back to what I said about this being the most dangerous age [Music] the reason why it's the most dangerous it's because of the level of confusion that exists in the outside world people don't remember who they are I think they don't like wear that guinnesson why they're there or how to proceed with what they have and the level of this confusion is enormous it's enormous frankly it's frightening [Music] um there was an actor and a comedian I'm not sure if most of you know him as the Robin Williams Robin Williams if you don't know him it's the you voiced many Character cartoon characters of Disneyland and he was very much loved um and he he made a lot of money he's very famous he had it all in accordance to the American dream but despite having all that he was still not happy and a couple of years ago he took his own life and he was perfectly healthy he had no mental issues no diseases and um he wasn't on any antidepressants depression in fact when you look back on the recordings he looked perfectly normal foreign that's how scary this confusion is because we don't we're living in an age where we don't even know um if the people are real um we know they are just simply putting on faces wanted to hide the real ones [Music] and they keep to themselves they start hearing voices in their heads questioning they're posted and one thing I learned from another brother um when you start hearing voices in your head one point in time you forget which one's yours and now I'm gonna end here because that's I'm gonna end here because I'm about to over go over my limit um God bless you all and hope you have a Merry Christmas [Applause] God bless you it's a pleasure to be here with you thinking it's Christmas maybe I'll give my brother the gift to speak in Spanish I'll continue with it just to wish everyone a Merry Christmas happy to be here with you continue on the Plan of Redemption Express what's in our minds where it's helped us but it'll help you we're in a time where it's a Christmas time where it's a time to be grateful right we give gifts you know we show people that how we love them and it's it's a time where we get together we appreciate she ate each other and I appreciate each and every one of you I congratulate each and every one of you in being here right now or for making the time to watch right now that is a victory that you being here so take that with you and it's a victory to be here you know it would have been very easy today it's a crazy time everywhere it's where it's super busy I congratulate you for being here today and for making the effort to be here today you know what's what's uh what's coming you know with the New Year it's a time where people talk about improvements to be better exactly you know to maybe come up with the change that seems to be a theme foreign and we have an opportunity to be well with the Lord going forward you know maybe that's something that we that I reflect on you know it's it's a time for me that I need to be better you know personally you know what I mean and spiritually you know I want to make it a goal yeah it's like move forward and be better you know going along with this Plan of Redemption you know we we reflect on it and there's been so much that's been said yes a lot that we can take in and be thankful moving forward and now is the time to be able to apply it foreign you know a lot of it's a lot of times when we reflect and we say oh well tomorrow or the next year this next year I'm going to do it you know and together right now you know we can go into action you know whether it's a simple as a Praying or coming here you know we're here together and let's move forward together as a church praying for one another and that's just something that was in my heart you know that's something that I'm looking to be better and that's something that we can take together into the new year we don't have to wait till then right it's right now yes it's when we can take it going forward we have an opportunity you know when we say well one opportunity right yeah you know to accept the Lord into our lives if you haven't done that right and if you feel that in you you have that opportunity you have that opportunity to allow the Lord into your life you know we see the things that happen on daily you know with with loved ones maybe we've had testimony our brother Alfredo Garcia gave testimonies with our sister Garcia you know I I have loved ones where the Lord is working with my father you know I see the Lord working and I and I see that and I just want to accept that into my life I want to be a part of that I want to be a part of that moving forward you know we see these kinds of things and so we can take it with our with this mentality to be better and to accept him right yes how do we accept them right you know he's surrendering to him right you know we just in in the conventions in November right it was how can I overcome right and one of the one of the things that our brother mukundi I hope I'm pronouncing that correct he talked about humility you're just in humility it's how we can overcome being simple and being um that's how we can accept it surrendering to him and I just want to go to the scripture very quickly we don't have to turn to it and it's it says therefore said he unto them a harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth laborers into his Harvest is the laborers are few that's something that uh this is coming from a message from Brother Bernie and I recommend for you to read it so we we've talked about how it's it's an opportunity to move forward and be able to accept the Lord and move forward with the Lord you know to take in this gospel right in the gospel is the good news what good news well the good news that they that they had talked about the ones that they had spoken about had arrived those were the good news that the one that they had talked about in the Old Testament he had arrived and that was the good news that's the gospel one that had they had spoken about he had arrived and so when it comes to speaking on the planet of redemption and then to be able to accept him you know we said well we might think in accepting him you may think oh well I've already accepted him that's great and this next thing you know the scripture that we read in Luke 10 2. and look at yes those but the laborers are few loss you know brother Bernie focused it a lot focuses a lot on this and in the part two of the message he talks a lot about laborers a lot he says the word laborers a lot continues on about it laborers what is the labor you know there's two types you know the physical you know physical and mental workers where someone's praying you know someone or someone that's always here my brother here very early on Sunday morning it comes and he cleans yeah Olympia it cleans the outside you know it's the church looks really nice but it doesn't always look that way but there's there's laborers you know one of the our biggest laborers he's not here right now he's in maybe a big snowstorm a big storm yeah one of the biggest laborers of course our pastors someone that takes his word into action so this word laborers brother Bernie focuses a lot on that and that's just that's what I wanted to come across just that laborers because it's it's a one thing to come right it's like what's happening you know brother Bernie gives an example you know we could come you know we can do but but if there's a church with 400 members we should have 400 laborers and whatever it is right in praying for one another you may you may you may think and I'll just use this as an example I saw brother Javier oh he he he wasn't doing well and then he didn't talk to me and I say I use your brother Javier because the tremendous amount of respect that I have for him that we should all have for him because that is a laborer and so if he's not doing too well or I could have gone maybe to the barber shop and spoken with him a little bit or the same thing brother Bernie says let's say our cleaning group right you know I saw a program there it was on the floor the cleaning crew will get it right no you do it and that's just a small example right and moving forward moving into the year Lord give me the desire to be a laborer whatever it is getting here early helping clean it doesn't matter that's the thought that I had this this evening I keep saying morning when people were walking in I was telling them good morning I'm so used to it right we're in the glory right now with one service a week with quick service right we're in truly in the glory and then so it's it's and it's in times like this when it's easier to not be a laborer let's let's pray together be laborers in the littlest thing let's be laborers just praying for my brother praying for my pastor those are laborers you know of course visiting families helping people those are all traits of a laborer let's pray for the desire to be laborers together and as I close no I I pass it on someone that is Merry Christmas and God bless [Applause] India it's kind of tough having to follow that is but I think my brother because I can tell that he's really appreciative of the people we have here and so what my topic is more so it's me Tema it's it's I want to focus on on Christmas since we're approaching it already in it yeah just what is the gift that we're receiving you know we mentioned it many times around these holidays that this is not the time where our Lord Jesus Christ was born why not take this opportunity to celebrate it as we should celebrate it every day and here I have a couple quotes as different messages I was listening what I want to focus on is the gift that God sent to our people you have a quote form from the message God's wrapped gift he says just a little while from then and the world was going to receive its greatest gift that they ever received it's just a little package wrapped up just a little a little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all of the world God wrapped it up he says I want to break it in on my thought and say this this is the greatest thing that was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it he says God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world and is that not the greatest gift we've all ever received but what's more important is how he came to the world you know he goes on to say later on in the message he says it wasn't wrapped in fine Linens it was wrapped in swaddling cloth which is I'm taught that that very thing was wrapped in the Christ with the stuff of the back of the Yoke of an ox says he was wrapped in the swelling cloth the that's the it's the rag that they put around the ox yolk to keep it from rubbing blisters on it when he's pulling something he says they had no clothes for him and brother Branham says when I think of that says it nearly breaks my heart he says no clothes for Emmanuel the creator of heavens and earth for him to put on he had to be wrapped in the rag that an ox had worked his neck through and brother Brandon says he says oh what a super sign okay this great happening that that came about yesterday how we received the greatest gift that we could have ever received how he was born in Bethlehem he says that in Hebrew the word Bethlehem means the house of God's bread he says that God being the bread of life he could come no place but to the house of God's bread and he goes on to say in the message um why it had to be a shepherd He says the most unlikely place for such an event he says the Shepherds now was the one who received the message he says and now notice where the message was it was in the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come and so it was it came in an unexpected way maybe the people wanted to receive this gift in a spectacular way that's not what God wanted he came to the humble people and I like how he places it here I like the word choice he says it bypassed all the Nobles of the land he says it bypassed all the Nobles and was revealed to the nobodies so maybe many of us here professors were nobodies but that's what he came for and he says all the nobles were decorated with great doctors Divinity in Psychology and highly educations he says in great Cathedrals and things it was all bypassed and revealed to the nobodies and that's who we came to that's all we know that maybe at the time there was people who were maybe more qualified to receive him but he came to the Shepherds in 47 he says what inspiration to those herdsmen he says the Angels coming down to speak to herdsmen just angels of God coming to speak to a bunch of Shepherds and brother goes on and he describes Shepherds he says you know Shepherds don't talk right pastors they don't know how to do mathematics he says they don't they don't know much all they know about is sheep and he jokes around and he says if you ever had the the privilege to talk to a shepherd He says they hang around sheep so much they begin to start laughing like sheeps and they start talking like sheep and they smell like sheep and it goes on 53. and he says in a Manger he says see how at ease these herdsmen was in The Stables he says what do you think a theologian would have been in there he said he put a pin over his nose and said get me out of this place see he would have been so out of place he'd be in misery again he came to the Shepherds he came to to the Lowe's because the highs would not want him and what a blessing it is to us he came and he gave the gift to us maybe low lives but out of nothing he came and made something in something what a blessing and he goes on uh 94. he says see the first time Angels ever sing at a celebration was in heaven he said but the first time they ever sang on Earth was the Shepherds at the birth of God Emmanuel on Earth foreign how fitting it is to a Shepherd to receive a message of a newborn sheep foreign in the prayer he goes on to say here that I I really liked this is brother Brandon I'm praying to close off his his preaching this is 242. and he says I offer myself to God tonight with all my heart with all that's in me Corazon me he says I don't have very much to give I can't bring frankincense myrrh and gold because I have none but all I have in myself that God gave me this life I dedicate to him afresh tonight and how much how many of us can relate to that maybe we don't have anything physical to offer him no frankincense no myrrh no gold but we have this life that he provided for us that we can dedicate him for him tonight he says but all I have in myself God give me this life I dedicate to him a fresh night upon the manger of his word in my heart he says and promise him to stand with that word if he'll let me live another year as brother Paul said you know as the year ends people will start thinking about what they're going to do the next year and here we have brother Brandon saying if you give me another year this is what I want to do with my life he says it's just as faithful as I can stand preach every bit of it and believe every bit of it you could have so help me God and then he asked a question yes and I ask it to you as well you do the same with me and he goes on when he's finishing up his prayer he says what can we do dear God and I ask the question to you what can we do or what can I do okay he says help me and these other Shepherds Lord around the world Shepherds of the word to Proclaim it Lord in this next year he says help us Lord we pray he says give us thy love thy Spirit he says we dedicate ourselves tonight to Thy word into thy cause in Jesus Christ's name we receive your Christmas gifts the word of God made flesh in US amen and so is that not what we would like to do tonight but we celebrate tonight is God sending his only begotten son to save us and this ties in with Redemption and everything we speak on if anything this is the beginning this is what sets it about it is because I was looking the voice of God Recordings every year they send out their their Christmas greetings and I was reading through the ones they've done in the past years in one of the years the scripture they used is John 3 16. and at first I wondered is that really something that applies to Christmas but when I read it and what the little message they give in the voice of God Recordings what about these beautiful words that God giving his only begotten son anybody who believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life not the greatest gift so you'll be so kind of please stand up yeah pretty and we'll be praying to dismiss we shall kind of close your eyes and buy our heads dear heavenly father Lord we thank you because you've provided us a place to come and Gathering we thank you because you let us see another Christmas Eve like my brother said we could have been many other places I know it took effort to be here tonight so I ask that you provide my brothers with a special blessing Lord be with us tonight let us accept that gift you sent for us Lord it didn't come wrapped fancy you know we know um it came in something so humble so that we can accept it us not being Noble but being nobodies so I asked for that tonight you'll be with us you bless my brothers those are watching online foreign [Music] amen God bless you and Merry Christmas [Music] [Music]
