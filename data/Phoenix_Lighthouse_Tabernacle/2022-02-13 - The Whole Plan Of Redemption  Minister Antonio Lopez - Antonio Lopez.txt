house of the lord i mean you are happy to be here palestine places that are keen man good to hear that let's open up our bible we're gonna read the base scripture it's uh the book of hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 we'll start with joseph you can say man when you have it and the word reads but christ being come in high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building foreign neither by the blood of goats and caps but by his own by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you [Music] in the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify sanctify it to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from their works to serve the living god thanking you for your grace and mercy for your protection these days they haven't been easy for anybody so much out there in the world but you've kept the safe lord and we thank you lord gracias father if we've done something against our word we ask for forgiveness father as we hear your word may those chains start to fall lord may we feel that freedom you give us lord when your [Music] all we want to do is serve you father and the only thing we only want to say what you want us to say in the name of our lord jesus christ you may take your seats mexico and mexico and um and all over the united states god bless you thank you for tuning in i want to thank god for this opportunity our pastor pastor loaning me his pulpit foreign how many i see that you all came very happy to the house of the lord hey man i see how beautiful you all look but how many of you came with the expectation i'm not saying demanding but a humble expectation expectation um wanting to change for the lord jesus christ we're going to stay with the same topic same subject the plan of redemption and i wanted to ask you when was your last experience with god experience was it this morning was it yesterday last week so it's very important and when we come to the house of the lord we already come uh with some energy we don't come to the house of the lord unprepared if we come prepared already it makes things a lot easier that atmosphere just it's already there is so it's always be it's always good to get that experience daily being around the word of god because at the end of the day it's the only thing that can satisfy our soul we can buy everything we want we can have a new house but before we go to sleep and as we see ourselves and everyone in the world today sometimes we we do get stressed out our daily or our daily things we do the daily things we do our work our finances financials are our family or familia problems are going to come that's problem and that's going to bring stress in our lives we see that people can can't handle that stress anymore they prefer to take their own life away our minds don't stop thinking about our problems we can't go to sleep anymore we can't have that peace we once had so that's when we have to come to the lord and just give it all to him let him take care of it and as we know if we continue thinking about it it might bring anger it might bring depression all that bitterness and if we think on it for so long i always see god as a gentleman he's waiting for us to make that decision to follow him to serve him because he's not going to come one day and he's going to be like i'm tired of antonio estoy antonio i'm just going to do it for him i'm going to take that snake away from his heart and i'm going to fill him with the holy spirit if he wants it or not i'm just going to do it okay and why is the way i said no he's not like that brothers he's waiting for you to make that decision man so redemption i was speaking last time i spoke a little bit of redemption i was talking about accepting redemption so that's one of the first things we have to accept so the plan of redemption can activate well the plan of redemption um how is the lord jesus christ died for us for our sins not in vain so we have to make sure that it wasn't unveiled we have to do our part and now that it's uh we're close pretty much a day away from valentine's day that's pretty much the last our love story here as christians when he died for us for our sins we it's that unconditional love he had for us and it's still with us today and as i was saying earlier uh we have to come with the correct attitude to church amen i confess that sometimes when i'm praying confess sometimes i'll be praying and i'll go straight into my problems um i forget to thank god that's another place where we have to have the correct attitude if you want your prayer to work you want god to listen to your prayers god revealing himself to his people just what i was trying to do to the to the woman was get her in the right mental attitude she wouldn't have she wouldn't have to be prayed for necessarily the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass do you believe that amen so that's all we have to have that correct attitude and by activating redemption uh god's redemption in our lives and sometimes we feel like things aren't for us amen or sometimes we feel like we don't deserve them that's that's my case many times and i and i have to get get out of that spirit there was a case tried on that in the federal courts of our land a man had committed a crime and the governor of the state has sentencing to be shot or to be killed by public execution and while the man was in prison waiting his time to of execution someone interceded to the governor until the governor found reasons to pardon the man the governor wrote just a little line on a piece of paper and signed his name this man is pardoned governor so and on so and so este hombre especially and when it was brought to the man showed him by his attorney he said i will not receive it a pardon's got more to to it than that i believe it's bogus therefore i believe someone's trying to put something over on me again how that the devil says the same thing to the church tonight the bible's misinterpreted we hear the stories of moses we hear the stories of abraham and we say well that was for that generation what about us now but no it's it's still for us as well brothers what they went through over there and they did to get closer to god it still amen amen and we make mistakes daily yes does eastside do you have to build a new place not patch up the old one but build a new one not too long ago i don't know if it was a year ago or two years ago did you uh hear in the news and it killed a lot of people well they were saying that that building had they were they were looking at the past history of the building and they saw that there were there were faults in the and um they just did like little patches here and there you know but they never truly fixed the problem so now the bigger uh the bigger problem came and the building fell down and a lot of lives when you make a mistake you can't just patch it up here and just forget about it you have to go right to the root of the problem take away what's bad in so a little bit of when i was studying here for on the planet of redemption i was a thought came into my into my mind identifying or identifica identification identification ourselves as the bride and also identifying our advisor so those are the questions that come up as soon as you start hearing about this subject and one time i heard brother carlos preaching them amen as soon as we identify the tricks of the devil the faster we become overcomers example when a brother comes and you're talking with a brother and he says something you didn't like or or anything that you were not agreeing with and now you have something against that brother well before you have something against the brother antes hermano you can if you can identify the devil diablo then you can see that it wasn't the brother it was something else and there's no reason for you to have something against that brother you can easily uh put it to a side and completely forget about it because many times i know it because of me i sometimes don't even know what i said where i feel like it's uh what i'm saying is not going to offend anybody but at the end of the day it does offend somewhere so the sometimes a brother would say well brother i just can't forgive that brother he he did this already more than once i feel like he's doing it on purpose and once once they mess with me i'm done with them one time i um at work this there was a nurse and a doctor they're always and the doctors are very specific very picky i understand that specifically and an inch or a centimeter if the head is not positioned a centimeter or off a centimeter from the place they want it and they'll make a big deal about it and she's like he he messed with me i'm and it it's really hard for me to trust that person again and i don't know if i'm going to be able to be around him anymore so that's that's just a little example this is an example of how we can uh do things bigger and by listening to the wrong voice yeah we know it's going to guide us in the right direction we know it's going to guide us to forgiveness we know it's going to guide us leave it to god amen amen i have a personal story myself in my family not as much anymore but we in our birthdays we would uh get the the person the the person that's having the birthday person and we'll put the cake in there we'll put their face in the cake so one time that happened to me they put my face in the cake and i was like and this is in december because that's uh and and i was like man when is his birthday i want to get him back this is and just think about it his birthday is still september i'm already planning for it i'm not going to say which brother noise but i is have two no hermanos you have a 50-50 shot so i was already planning for it so the day comes but the cake was made out of ice cream so it was it was harder than usual and we put his face into the uh to the cake and the cake barely got a little dumb from the nose the only words i remember saying i remember him saying is that he felt little tears coming out of his eyes from the from his nose being smashed into the cake so it's just even a small thing like that all that can be avoided um just by listening to god the most poor we're going to make mistakes automatically because we're going to be hearing the wrong voice preach for so many years 120 years the same thing god was coming the flood was coming and there was going to be an arc and if you get if you repent from your sins you would and get in that arc but nobody would listen they think he was crazy and the only people at the end of the day that listen to him was his own family and he still was obedient to god it's just um very tremendous just to see how much obedience a person can have towards god so we are the bride of the lord amen and being the bride of the lord we are part of the plan of redemption of pretty much the plan of redemption is to find that bride of the lord so they can reunite once again i was hearing uh another message brother brown message the five uh five uh definite in the identifications of the true church of the living god identification we'll start reading a little bit on that and then uh after this quote i'm going to start closing well what was the speckled verb i defer the i differ with the guy that said that was wrong what was the speckled bird of the bible it was not israel no era israel as they said it was it was the church of jesus christ so who here is the church of jesus christ i believe we're all or so this is for us here for a sin offering and poured the blood upon the living mate and turned the maid loose and the mate sprinkled is with the blood of the dead mate went across the earth sprinkling as he flew his wings and the blood splashing upon the earth cried holy holy holy unto the lord amen amen and that was a type of christ and the great sparkled bird is the church that's been specked by the blood of the dead of its dead the survivor jesus christ el salvador jesus christ and she's crossing the world today flopping her wings crying holy holy holy unto the lord i'm so glad my name is on her book put there not by my goodness no sir no i never i'd never be there or by your goodness but by the goodness and mercies of god what is the identification of the church what is jesus christ not a bishop no no bispo not the catholic church no glacier catholic not luther not wesley no wesley no sir no senior who set it up we can get to heaven can we get to heaven without it for those that are dead in christ will god bring with him and not not any anyone else but those who are dead in christ jesus is coming for those that are dead in christ he says in galatians he's saying ephesians 4 chapter 4 and then he corrects himself uh galatians i believe it is the fourth chapter said that those that are dead in christ it's all worth it at the end of the day it's an eternity with our lord jesus christ we were called to serve god this this church is a missionary church they go to all over the world just to take the word of god to other people that haven't heard it [Music] for your
