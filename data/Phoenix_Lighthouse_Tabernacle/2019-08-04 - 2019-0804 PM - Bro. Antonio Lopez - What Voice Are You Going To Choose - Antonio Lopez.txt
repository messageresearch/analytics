no past or we need the perfect will of God in our lives can estamos self-report that they do a nostra Vita not the permissive will know at the receiver not what we want to do like a demos I said well what God is telling us to do eNOS eNOS and that's the only way we're gonna have success in the plan of God it's just one company that was a 10-8 exit to netplan de Dios I was looking into the permissive will of God die window near doctormick Steve audit us some examples was a him plus I was a reading the message of brother Branham by Linda Branham it's titled does God ever change his mind about his word está tu lado can be adios su modo de pensar con respecto su palabra it was preached in 1965 prepare the calorie no vice in this isn't a Cinco and so I was reading and I got a little quote from there so you can get a better understanding yes a con éxito a keep our key my and I read some yeah but and if the people won't walk in His perfect will Priscilla gente no coming on to perfect about that he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in as DN a doctor miss Eva a la que él dejara coming her notice he permits it alright we can say hello permit a muy bien but he will make a workout for his glory in His perfect will wear ellebra para su Gloria and su perfectible with that now if if you'd like just like in the beginning or I see the sand just like in the beginning coming up in Scipio it was not it was not God's perfect will for the children to be born on the earth through sex no real opponent that defected SEO speculoos news Nacional a tiara port Middlesex oh no sir no Senor God created man out of the dust of the earth the square along with el polvo de la tierra birth brethren the breath of life on to him as people in today la vida in el and he became a living soul la coruna Alma vivian t he took from there a man a helmet helpmate and made a wife to him it's like oh they say hombre una campaña de la esposa that's that was God's first in original will SF Wella primera elaborate that original de Dios but when sin came in mask under picado intro and did the thing that it did because o la cosa cacao so then he permitted men to marry a wife legally and have children's by her entonces el premio el hombre casa con su esposa legalmente ten equals pariah multiply and replenish the earth then whatever Carlos Guillen at Akira entonces if that's the way you're going to do it yes that money that can kill stead of a nicer but you see it it never was his perfect world better than was to this and calf West evolved that Perfector so that's a perfect example brother branham gives us there it's in a hamper perfecto Connors that mr. Mara Branham show he knows how God allows us to do certain things seon-ah como estas permitir que vamos hacia Tascosa so we can make our own decision vamos Domino's has prepared this is Jonas but the other part of my tie roller Pilate are today me too was about what voice you were going to choose to hear a squirrel was by selling here acetic acid and one of my questions that came up you know bronchoscopy no when I was learning about the subject or stopping it at this table oh it was how do I know that the voice I am hearing is the voice of God yep romantic Amy pronto s como se que la voz escucha s la voz de Dios this question came way before like when I was in my teen years for the US Tahoe - Canasta pregunta primero beam ornamented it always comes when you're in ten to twenty you're never sure this is what God wants you to do simply wanna collect anything los dedos USD esta paintin cassava give us a step you're gonna have questions what an arrogant ass so I was looking into that stymied under Nestle and also found a message for the encode roommates aqui para ESO it was a brother branham's message for my secretary mano random it was what here is now Elijah it AK escucha Celia's and when we hear the thoughts that come into our mind when the escúchame los momentos give me understand meant a the way we can test them away la mina cosplay most Panetta forever at least one way o nominator is by question any worry what would coming out from this top experimenter que viene de este Pentimento well fruits are gonna come from it k frutos when i veneer this is in big good fruit and I said well no screw toes there are fruit or malice fructose so we have to examine the most examiner those thoughts to see if that if it come from God or from the dub but I suspect matrices being in the GOC been in El Diablo so as I was saying the I was reading I'm gonna read a little quote from or here is there Elijah okay while they were an extract of the case couch as Elias knew reads what we felt to see is to listen to the small the still small voice that speaks to us okay famous and various escuchar as a silver soiree a possibility no habla then wrap ourselves in his righteousness Dante's ROP Manos de justicia in Walker saying Sal Campos diciendo Lord God did you speak to me saying Orpheus a blast at me does it mean or does it mean me Oh Lord significa que es para me Oh we always have those questions here at the church sympathy no Moses has built us a keel iglesias when the pastor is preaching past tourists a pretty candle and he hits her like right on the spot it latina is he talking to me Esther and um he does in did he just read my mind was going on stallion elementa que esta pasando because that's exactly what I'm going through okay okay me pass at me but I believe a lot of of the brothers and sisters here can relate to each other - monastic with an intended me because the pastor knows where the church is going to be a pastor 7 lo que esta pasando Glacia he knows what what problems are in the world that we have to face Sara cual estamos de nosotros tenemos que pasar and this morning esta mañana as our president was preaching or stopped recognize the past or some thoughts came to me I spent time in Tuscany romantic when he was saying that he was standing the gap for you and me first I said ok separately and I betcha por nosotros and then a thought comes to me Lopez I meant Amina me well if he's gonna stand in the gap she said well but I'll Appalachia put in then it means you can do whatever you want it was a split asset looking to get us you can if you don't want to come to church the pastor got si si okay let me Alec let's suppose is in it well then another thought right afterwards a it came you know you know the repent o author Pentimento well yes in one sense it's true it's a G and we sent it was better that but you have to do what the pastor's telling you to do but the meatiness guess a local pastor Tyson okay I guess so he can stand for you in the gap but guess I put up a report of stead in Appalachia you man I mean there's own we're always trying to find ways to make it easier for so victim was in court that money does SLO más fácil para nosotros well there's only one way from a second man era and that's true God yes porthos man I mean so I know we all go through that we get that but then God speaks to us right after and tells us what we really need to do at the end tenemos pensamentos below with yours be any knows d SE como su esposa because you always have that little devil here and God's Word is right here next to you is well but see the red in the wrong potato kia kia goes well annotation okay so molecules just what we know well you have to do what you shouldn't do look at the nice castle okay no Davis does here man and then so what can I do to speak for God to speak to me okay policy para que dios may have let me that's another question I heard is the Minnesota protocol yo tengo so I was reading here I'm an Italian Turkey and one of the things I definitely knew already let's go Sasuke yes I via is that I definitely have to have the right attitude you're getting a like attitude corrector I can go to God no poder con Dios and just be mad at God and expect them to have a solution for me East I know how the con USD getting a solution para me I can I can go to God for the air adios and ask him for things from teleporting las casas if I'm not doing his will associate she's you know stressing the support that we we can one time I heard this little story in a vest or UNIX
