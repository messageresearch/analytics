[1:14:24] who your daddy is
[1:14:52] that's when we get closer to god
[1:15:07] and when problems
[1:15:26] what comes first the egg
[1:15:30] el webb where the chicken we're having a
[1:15:33] debate
[1:15:36] well the egg came first oh you're nuts
[1:15:38] how could the egg come

[1:15:48] the man that god said give you
[1:16:14] have you ever wanted a box no queridos
[1:16:25] that's when the devil comes in
[1:16:28] what you got to do well let's see
[1:16:33] that's not a really important important
[1:16:36] what's important law important is that
[1:16:38] we both believe
[1:16:41] in the resurrection and we can walk
[1:16:46] brothers we can talk like brothers
[1:16:50] and we can say god bless you
