Valentine be home poker the next Oreo day in Santo Valentina and so I looked up I had looked up a story as well get them in booze go next Dora and so I I uh I found one you gota de una to share with you there come particular studies and I don't know how accurate it might be you know second toe canto server that I got from a History Channel pull a video in canal de story and so uh hopefully it has a sense of accuracy but he is better getting a book with a lot and so I want to share with you a couple con ustedes meses and I gave a version mister dr. Emoto universe soon and now want to give a little bit around that version you kiddo there or not there were some simulator and so say st. Valentine so it's an Santo Valentin you know he was uh he was there they say in the third century did a nice little dress there said Sigler and so Claudius he Claudio he was there the second mr. Wilson he was in charge of during that time delay darkest hour in Colorado listen and so during that time he had the soldiers is a Templeton especial Davos and he thought that it would be more efficient okay okay bastard mejor it'd be a lot better said I'm a ban marriages you know IBM matrimony Oz and so because maybe his soldiers will be less distracted person seen in matrimonial mahalo so does to be line menos destroy those and so they'd be more ready to work my god Melissa Spa trabajar their minds wouldn't be somewhere else it meant a no Viren start repairing because you can think but Westminster you know a father you don't Padre having his family at home they were so familiar and Tsukasa you know being away start lejos you know maybe he's always thinking about his family the more simple stop patellar su familia in a split second a decision can come Louis a window not easy on pasa and then he might be distracted it was the other horses trying you know might cost something for the kick-out shall go may be so this was the thinking of Katya I'm horror stuff well ok pensaba Chloe so he banned marriages so L remove your Tolos Louis my team on you and so Valentine thought that this was unfair so Valentin do Castano Nora who story you don't want anything to do with that look at the another in a castle Coney so so what he did so lo que le if so he will arrange secret marriages la pena matrimonio San secreto so he married people Kesava hinted you know outside of the law where a de la ley so to make them happy but I said Los Feliz because he thought that that was just for here ok ok so a justo so and so he went to jail so if a la cárcel and the one in charge their ilk is nine karela day he had a daughter at dinner and I Iike and so Valentine you saw Valentin fell in love with the daughter say in a moralist weeka and so the time came so Campo and a long time there you see by Marie Valentin and so there he died and this case a moody era he left a letter l de una Carta signed ok with mother your Valentine to Valentin and so from there you know that is AE we get the ideas to write letters Lola lay there they escribir carpet ask me to be our Valentine rotunda in KCK densetsu amigos reminded us and dr. list records Oh being in school it's not on escuela we handed out cards step Adamo star hit us or even older now what a little more to have you give some cards dan was Curtis that hit so that's how that origin came from je no the way so and so it says all he died from love they say que él murió Palin gave his life for love and your stupid a pour l'amour so he he loved the people around La MaMa doors down and then and so he was going to die so estaba dispersed amore he was willing to do what everybody was against it that exposed to say look at toast iran-contra to make them happy but I'm sad Los Feliz and so and then we bring that to us so I pretty much try monster nosotros it's the same with the Lord Jesus Christ Romy's what can you see what hay-zu Cristo no he died él murió I know for us right well no so truce now we make that personal yes a most so personal and sometimes that stuff is ever say so there's some but it's it's tough for me for me or assess your what I owe it was a really get that in my head the pony show me cabeza you know the Lord Jesus Christ died for me is he a so mr. moody up for me but I couldn't really grab onto that you know you know well you ain't in there is you know what does it mean that or Jesus Christ died for me it's anything I came to do poor me so I would I'd have that thought a lot sitting here suppose I'm in too much um to me a lot what does that mean medium which was a picture my Tamim in the case in Africa I mean I get that he died on the cross yo you and gained okay mood even like cruise I understand that you and you into it so well there was there's more to it than that but in a cave it must a so there's a lot more to it than that I must ask so being young so siendo haben I couldn't grab onto that no I'll put the intend there you know the Lord Jesus Christ died for me so his system would up for me and so seeing stories like this so they end o story has come West maybe seeing stories that make letter that come that our other than the cross or a story SK Evelyn de la Cruz there are apart from the cross or is this una parte de la Cruz do you know when you see different examples with different as a him plus and so you start to put many different things together and what police cosa diferentes juntos you know we saw a story last night you motion historian oj o our Father they won't Padre who had to choose between his son and and a train full of people take it to what Casey they sue echo own train lleno de gente so there was a bridge of yeah own what and he had to choose whether he was gonna there was a bridge lift it up and he had to choose I be a teeny a case cohere IV I own Puente Levantado and there was a boat passing then when they had passed young bar cookie work area pasado and that's why they had lifted up the bridge but I say we had another ill okay point and and so because of this I por esto there was a train coming I've been turning Kevin here you know filled with people you know the hint day that the father did not know Caleb are there no Sevilla and so and in this train coming it was ahead of schedule yes very linear vignette temprano and so then the son does El Hijo saw this boa esto and so he ran to the track yell Cory hasta los dos come here and so heated to pull a lever so that the bridge para que el puente would come down to Sarah and the people would be saved in a subir a salvo instead of you know flying off the bridge Oh por que su parent kind of the people would have died or like it's stuck it's only Costa Torah and the fall has to choose to save his son yet palutena KCDC para su eco I was gonna save all these people who are so better to us the hint a and so we bring that to the Lord Jesus Christ when he must have so Cristo with with our God when I stole the ocean you had to make a choice you must guess this is shown to save his son yeah Salva rasoi ho or save the world of silver el mundo and so different examples like this so different is the hemp was come Wednesday you know it made me think makes up inside he died for us with your nose otro you start to see examples a best doses Jose hand blue you start to see how how hard it was get a faeces way because we talk a lot about the sacrifice almost which are their sacrificial what about the three days the low stress Diaz when the father was suffering when the mr. palace to go sufriendo losing his only son but en de su único he only única Nieto and so there they show an image I ain't seein a man in my hand with with the father cradling his son go to father I don't know su hijo no dead mirto and though he they were crying out yeah you're on do you know can imagine that boy you're making out this well I I don't have a son or a daughter you're not the only homeowner but I can I can't place myself there you know me well up on any so Pope but placing a loved one para alguien que yo quiero putting them there but in the law and si I can't imagine what that feels like I'm making that kisses in there so and so then he chose to save us his son yes course Allen oscillated equal neither his son died for us so I started that's more things like examples like that massive hubris como si you start to paint a picture for me we stand upon a todo who Tony meant a and so banquets like the ones that we have events I wanna banquette xi ok tuvimos you know they start they help us out in some way so you don't in nomine de there for us so I encourage our youth so your les les digo to come over beggar and be a part of the youth it's an oportunity grupo human you know it's for our benefit it's part of beneficio it helps little by little yeah you that poquito poquito you know and talking about our youth is those covenants you know I've been on I've been able to help in the sunday-school little bit you're a star you underlined square Dominican and so on this month so it's the miss it found my lot to speak this month with the Kwame dabbler and so we're talking about three stages of grace la paz de Gracia you know try to set a foundation UNIF window soon so for our ages 12 to 13 then is to us in others they don't set arrested and so we're there with them don't say I couldn't use we're talking about three stages of grace until I stretch the top of the grass trying to put that inside their head put iteration to scott into a mentee so what it's like the que trata our examples there's a handful different examples in the Bible different is a him plus an Habib Allah and so that's what we're what bringing is okay Thomas triangle and so with this morning it's the hard way oh it's more this morning we talked about the Apostle Paul but almost a la post of public and so we talked about his origin I'm at the own Devon year and so the Apostle Paul so i'll a post or Pablo being a pure-blooded Jew siento who do was from the tribe of Benjamin yeah they'll three by the way I mean so uh we've said this before and was the tres bon and then he was born a free born elsewhere Saucedo so he were here that the right to choose whatever you want to be Oh a will they see deal okay okay I said so he didn't have to he wasn't born into a certain trade you know thing like I said I'll go specifically you know he the choice to do what he wanted Alton yeah let's he's on the sale okay okay yeah you know like all of our students go most nurses to the others they have the choice to do whatever they want to do can I say that said okay you're scarin and so Apostle Paul la posta Pablo went to a school where on escuela that was the best of the best mr. Kemal come oh come in here and so he's studying studying under there him stop wise together so like a Harvard or stand for something like that more common escuelas Harvard or Stanford you know the big school is the big names as well as grandest that's the type of school that the Apostle Paul went to sixty Pasquale a Calif way and he memorized the law if anybody saw he knew the law of the Old Testament at supalen al Testament he knew he knew all of it yes who else have you told so that's what he studied yesterday Aloha gales s to do and so he grew up he's worth courtesy oh you know learning the law lay opinion de la ley and so when he was taught okay elf way and say yellow was that the the followers of Christ can say he dollars decreased or were the enemies of Jehovah hello Ellen los enemigos did Cuba and so that's why he persecuted the Christians yes police ok Elmo loose those Christian so that time being Saul of Tarsus yes Saul and so uh he he wasn't Paul yet have any way that Pablo and so but hey you know brother branham talks about a story in Melbourne our brother next door yeah and so here I want to read a quote from from brother branham mercy hakuna does he tell their mother Brenda you know it was preached in 1957 where you know my sin to sink what they said its title Hebrews chapter one they said where I was capital oh no and I'm gonna jump around a little bit in this quote my Mobarak in but this and so this is an exhaust even died under the rocks Amira I stare when Marie de bajo las Piedras being stoned to death eternal eternal miss cuando fuera de la muerte no I think he must have got um next to Paul when he saw Stephen raised his hands to heaven yeah a little Harlequin saw a public on the u.s. there when they went Ursus Manasa Cielo season I see that heavens open I see Jesus standing at the right hand of God yo shadows appreciative artists whisper Allah yesterday Dios and he said yelled equal this is speaking of Stephen I don't know they step on father father lay not this charge of sin against them noticing with this piccolo I use he says and he fell asleep he said o Romeo that's how the scripture says right he didn't feel anymore yeah no Cynthia that's well that's why brother Branham says okay you set him on a brother and we jump ahead it was more almost empty there is something Paul I'll go respected Pablo then he any man under conviction what kid hombre bajo convict Co so no he's trouble he was their brother Branham says that this is when he began to change a key this element when a case called Olympus or a cambiar or something something started to affect him I go into traffic dar so something start to get to him I go leave alimentive and I started to get him back and forth he stopped coming to lament it so maybe he was there I'm putting least away and he just couldn't stop thinking about oh yeah but other benefits out of this is that the man that this man was on his knees s they don't waste time ensues through the years you know being stoned it's not the end of the other and then he's yelling out there yeah lista commando you know Lord forgive them yours paternalism don't charge them with this sin listen put this este picado no leave them alone forgive them Lord they hello solos because they knows because they don't know what they're doing ok you know stomach acid and and their paw their saw yeah so standing there but although he you know you imagine this scene and my healer sister Cinna where he's just seeing there someone praying for him must I can do I can cast out on the forehead he's thinking whoa how is this possible if they're pretending all my stress possible how was it possible that someone's praying for me just gay against a or and up for me and you know we know that shortly after this you seven most gay booked oh this place test oh you know he's on his way to Damascus starting coming out Damascus so he's there on his way extend Camino and we know the story seven was I stole yeah well he's knocked down okay a spoon bottle and then were they he's there saw saw why not persecuted to me days support came Perseus and then this he is he's there on the ground I extended peaceful and then we know that from there he's a mosaic that the Lord takes him killed singer look Toma you know and tells him that he's gonna be Paul Lisa cave I said and that's where he said he I've called you that day yeah model you know that's what we read a little bit of that better stone and he was called get for your mother you're a call to be an apostille for yeah well that's they're not posted and so there we bring up justification Irene was like who Steve Akashi on you know a he did nothing for it and noise so another Perez you know he did nothing for just turned the justification at all you know same NaCl obviously because you you know he did nothing for it annoys own apparatus fearless but he was justified but it was difficult about justifications because that was the acoustical ceiling you know our brother Bernie mr. ma no baby talks and he says oh we do nothing for justification so there's no sin was not a part of who is difficult you know when he's when Lauren Jesus Christ was on the cross he was doing like Cruz you know the cross cast a shadow kristinia una Sombra you know we know that somos s so and so and us being typed of trees you're so most it was they are bolus you know the a tree when audible feels comfortable under the shade se siente Agusta bajo de la sombra so they feel feel feel good - Cynthia bien maybe a tree feels comfortable I'm only city-owned when I was a saint they're gusto so no maybe one we're here at church no customers like in like this yeah they're at home or like I saw the position that we're in like we're stoked estamos we feel comfortable mr.
