TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's justed ones which are at Ephesus and the faithful in Christ Jesus so the class won't forget it how do we get in Christ do we join the church to get in Christ do we make a profession to get in Christ do we be immersed in water to get in Christ how do we get in Christ First Corinthians 12th chapter for by one Spirit one capital s p i r i t which is holy spirit we are all baptized into the promised [Music] land in this Promised Land everything belongs to us in the Promised Land see it Brothers see everything in the promised land when Israel crossed over this Jordan into the promised land down everything I remember in this promised land that don't mean that you are immune from sickness that don't mean that you're immune from troubl but it does spell this it says this that it's your [Music] [Music] [Music] I now the word let me read the next foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him having predestinated us I want to stop on that word of [Music] predestinated now predestin say I'll choose and I I won't choose brother that isn't it it's the for knowledge of God that know which one would be right and which one wasn't right so by for knowledge God knowing what he was going to do he predestinated by his for knowledge Amen to make all things work together together for the good to them that love God that he might in the age that is to come call all things together in one which is Christ Jesus let me draw you a little illustration here it's good hu we go back I believe I talked on a little bit the other night I struck it in Genesis the 1 chapter 126 when God called his name Lord God it's in the word of l l Elohim which means the self existing one nothing else existed but him there was no air there was no light there was no stars there was no world there was no nothing else it was God and God alone el now he made that inside of that was attribute which meant that he was a inside of the this great L El Elohim was an attribute or a so you know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature that's so the little fell will get it I'm one of the little fell that had to get it that way of him was the nature to be a father but he's [Music] self-existence there ain't nothing for him to be father by now down inside of that was something else that he was gone and a god is an object of worship but it was self-existence El him so there was nothing to worship him inside of that he was a savior there's nothing lost to be saved inside of that he was a Healer sick to be heal be SI now do you get the picture so isut his nature produced what is today some people say well why didn't God just stop it in the beginning he's a cruel hearted brute said Joe Lewis that want to condemn [Music] Joe that he's just a Cru hearted brute there's no such a thing as God if there was such a thing it'd be oh I just called him all kinds of names see but it's just because he might have a lot of knowledge up here but he ain't got nothing down here this word tells it here and he's hid it and these Mysteries has been hidden I remember the Bible said since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God to display them to the church you get it I stop on my story just a little bit or I'll bring I'll go to my next stop till I get this I remember all through the ages of Moses back to the ages of the prophets back through all ages they waited until this latter days for these things to be displayed according to the scriptures right for it to be revealed to the sons of God why from the L until like the pyamid as I have said building Closer Closer [Music] Closer as I've often made this remark and said God made three Bibles the first one he put it in the sky the Zodiac you ever see the zodia what is the first figure in the zodia the Virgin what's the last figure in the zodiac Leo line he come the first time to the Virgin he comes the second time as the lion of the tribe of Judah see he made the next one in the pyramid back in the days of Enoch when they made theam and they measure I don't understand it but to the wars where they stupid and go on their knees for so long and can measure the distance of the wars you know where they me to now come across the king's chamber and as this pyramid went up we could not build it with everything that we got today we couldn't build it it's built right up like this to a point and the stone on the Capstone never was found they never did put a cap on top of the [Music] pyramid I don't know whether you know it or not the big Pyramid of Egypt it never had a top Stone on it why the Capstone was rejected Christ the headone see was rejected but as we grow from the Lutheran age bap age Methodist age Pentecostal age we're right up to the capping Stone now waiting and longing for that capping Stone to set down the buildings complete have not you read the scripture the stone was rejected of course we realize that was talking of the Solomon Temple but the rejected Stone has become the chief of the corner I'm saying this only to make a a picture to you now and in the Bible we're living in the last days the top of the pyramid the cross fishes of the cancer age in the Zodiac in the time of the coming of the Le in the capping Stone and in the days of the manifestations of the sons of [Applause] [Music] God we're right at the end time how many been reading the paper this week what Cru well they're ready so are we ready all oh what a privilege what a day if the Christians could only realize the day that we're living why do you think the writer of this book had seen it and seen where it would be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days for that power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age to reveal the secret things to the foundation the world to bring it up now let's go back into the foundation of the world again to get a revelation to see if we're right or not I hope I don't make myself sacri religious by calling God Papa but I want to say it that way so you'll understand it Papa wanted some children so what did he do he said let there be angels and they come around him oh that's fine oh they worshiped him then he was God the attributes remember he was L Elohim self-existence nothing but [Music] him the first thing come around was Angels then angels could do no more than worship they couldn't be lost so they couldn't be sick they were Immortal beings so he couldn't display his healing power he couldn't display his salvation so then before then after that he said we'll make something so he made an earth and when he made the Earth he made all the creatures of the earth and then he made man everything that come up out of the earth starting off with a A polywog or a jellyfish just a form of Flesh floating on the Water started from there from that to a frog which is the lowest type of life that we can find they claim as a frog highest type is human [Music] being from the Frog it started to the lizard from the lizard on and on and on and every time the Holy Ghost begin to breathe life come again and the first thinging something come up in the image of God that was a man nothing has ever been never was never will be created anymore anything higher than a man because a man is in the image of God then man when he made his first man now when he made his Angelic being he made Man created he made and female all in the same unit he was both man and woman femin and masculine when he made Adam and put him in flesh remember inesis he made man and woman and in Genesis 2 there was no man yet yet to kill the S flesh man no man that could take a hold of anything and steal the S but yet there was a man in His image God is [Music] a he made the first man male and female created he now when he made the first [Music] man now remember all together he had it in his mind and Sunday night I went through that a a word is a thought expr expressed God thought how he could be God how he could be worshiped how he could be a Healer how he could be a savior and as soon as he spoke the word it was finished forever oh if these sons of God now can only lay hold of that word like that when God speaks the word it is finished [Music] absolutely he might have waited chronologist say that or an archist just all they claim it maybe the world was millions and millions and I don't know it might have been trillions and trillions of years I don't know how long it was God does not exist in time he has not one minute l time than he did when he spoke it he is still God there's no time with him I never knew that like that till the other night other morning rather Eternal no yesterday no tomorrow it's all now did you ever notice the word I am not I was or I will be it's Eternal I am I am [Music] always [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] I [Music] h [Music] h [Music] so kind of stand so we can place a service in the hands of the Lord let's

would take your Bibles and turn to Philippians once again chapter two we will finish that portion of scripture which we started this morning amen and and and and let's let's if if we don't know it already let's be an attribute amen uh Philippians chapter 2 veres 5-8 and we'll finish we we'll stop right now uh when we get to the bottom uh verse 7 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men I amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated now as we started out this morning we spoke about how that uh the only way that you'll ever be able to channel the thoughts of God is to have this mind because that's what the mind is it's a channel it's a director it's a guide so in verse eight and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself so we found out that this mind has certain characteristics and we and we know that it's it's to it's to be a servant no reputation not afraid to be equal with God but now we're going to get to the difficult part humble was not afraid to be humble as a matter of fact it knew that humility was the key characteristic to being able to channel the thoughts of God we live in a we live in a time where it's most difficult to be humble because of social media social media carries with it certain characteristics and they're all found right here this is the this is the home plate listen careful this is the mind for social media this channels it right here you see we want to be on YouTube can in YouTube we want to be on my place in my place Facebook in Facebook and I'm not preaching against those things I'm preaching how we use them everything starts out innocently the the the gun was was was meant to protect and to be able to get food to eat so it started out good but it turned bad you with me the automobile was meant to carry you from place to place now it uses a weapon it destroys people's lives it can and then I'll just go right to this gadget here okay I have one it's what you use it for that's the same thing that God wants out of his children he wants you to channel he wants you to become the D director of he wants you to become a guide of his thoughts this started out innocently meant to communicate now everything has a positive and a negative Facebook Facebook my my brother-in-law years ago he say how come you're not on Facebook it's so that we can share family pictures that sounds good but after sharing the family pictures we find out way too much about the family whether it's true or false people want they they get the feeling of of well I I I I I feel like I'm I'm going to be able to to to send a message to my friends and family and then all of a sudden they have a hundred friends never met one of them don't really even know if they're the person that they say they are you see that's the way the human mind works we need to change that the human mind was meant to channel God's thoughts and become the manifestation of those thoughts now you heard me say there was a positive yeah I got the entire message of the hour on here I have the Bible on here I have the dictionary on here and I have my wife's picture on here that's the only face that I need for my book the Lord is good to us let me tell you because he sent us a message that gives us the opportunity to learn God's ways and God's thoughts that's why we're here this evening I believe that you know you often hear the phrase the manifestation of the sons of God of course that includes you daughters do you know what the word manifestation means to show up to show up to arrive did you know that so let me tell you the simplest form of the manifestation of the sons of God show up it's that simple because we have arrived one of the most difficult things for people is to come to the house of God why it's not because they don't want to it's because they have jobs they have family they have friends they got the sons Cardinals you see things like that they tend to get in our way it's okay to be a fan but what we really need to be is a fan of Jesus Christ should be number one always in our lives I'll tell you what Jesus Christ does as number one in your life he keeps your marriage together he keeps your family together and I know I have children that don't serve the Lord and I have children that do serve the Lord I'm not worried about the ones that are serving the Lord I'm praying for the ones that don't those are who I'm pulling for the believing children are pulling with me so see brothers and sisters this mind of Christ Jesus has requirements characteristics and humility is one of the hardest characteristics to truly find today brother brandham said this the greatest people he ever met were the humblest people he ever met you know why they had nothing to prove they knew who they were that's why I'm preaching this to you tonight so that we can know who we are now first of all you would have to believe that there is a God and that he could write because this is his word I be believe that and because I believe this is his word I can also believe in prophets and I believe he sent a prophet wasn't an ordinary man he was a man that God decided that he would give Vindication and proof to he Vindicated his ministry now we we quote out of many different Publications you know I hear men quoting uh uh uh the brothers in the past uh Martin Luther for instance Mar Lu John Wesley John Wesley and uh and many many different men their mind escapes their their names escaped my mind and I believe that all of those men had truth but I do not use their l lure for anything but to vindicate what the prophet already said because he said it first when you read something that the prophet did not agree with set it aside it's not Vindicated you with me there our Prophet was Vindicated many infallible proofs now I hope this don't shock you but I don't worship that's right you know why because of the mind of Christ thinking it not robbery oh we're not talking about the position we're talking about the mystical body of Christ and every attribute in it we are if we believe we are his children his children emanated from his mind by his thoughts that's the reason why it doesn't say let the mind of God be in you let the mind of Christ be in that was the channel that God was going to use I want to express these things to you so it becomes clear did you know that God is also in the same battle we're in because the prophet said he would never do he would never ask us to do anything that he hadn't already done you say wait a minute brother it sounds like there's a conflict oh there is one there's a message the conflict between God and Satan is that right what is the conflict between God and Satan oh I got it now I know you're not the devil brother so I'm going want to let you be God and I'm going to say that I'm the devil but I'm not you stay right there there's a conflict between him and I Carlos would you stand up who now is between him and I oh a Son of God you see there is a conflict between God and and it's the men and women between the two the conflict between Satan between God and sat you and I so now there's a conflict you don't think God didn't first understand conflict why if we go into our Bibles in the Book of Genesis we'll find out that it even grieved God that he made man is that right I spoke about Moses this morning and how he stopped he entered into the conflict and he said hold it in the days in Genesis it was Noah he saw he he I see a righteous man that's going to save at least the Journey of humanity you see how God was it seemed like God was conflicted it grieved him that he even made how is that possible because that's the mind of God you know brother Bram said that when when the presence of the Lord comes the Holy Spirit you're dancing on the bubble he says you feel good he said but when the presence of God comes into the room you freeze your skin begins to turn Ashen the blood begins to drain out and you begin to feel the presence of the judge but then the heart of God steps in and it begins to emanate the love you talking I couldn't agree with that more started with love you see when brother Brandon preached the message what is the Holy Ghost he preached that title that way because he because the Pentecostals became his congregation we notice when we listen to the messages most of the time brother Ernie the people that followed him didn't get the order just right he would be making an altar call somebody would stand up speak in unknown tongues somebody would prophesy that that was still the work of the Holy Spirit but man injected himself into the order of God which made the order incorrect not the gift brother BR said always reverence the gift always reverence the gift even when you know it's out of order is that right see brothers and sisters this is the mind of Christ it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't uh step back when it's told you can be equal with me you understand how can we be equal with God God and His word are in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and Among Us that's the equality that God gives you and I we can be the word made flesh that's our opportunity that's why we stay with the word people will argue over the word in John 1 in the beginning was the word how many knows what the word w r d means it's even in the Spanish Bible Loos is that right it's in the beginning was the logos and the Loos was with God and the Loos was God and the Loos became flesh and dwelt Among Us now that logos is the pillar of fire the same one that's on the picture with brother the same one that Paul met I know you think I'm repeating myself but I want you to see something that's the same Pillar of Fire that came down on the day of Pentecost and began to impart itself to the 12 Believers not diminishing itself one you know what the type of that is you get some bread and some fish you begin to break it off to feed the people and there's the same amount of fish listen and the same amount of bread with leftovers they picked up many many basket why was there leftovers it was pointed to others that would come that would need the fish and the bread that's where you and I come in it's the same Pillar of Fire it's here tonight because it is now Jesus Christ come on Paul on the road to Damascus who art thou Lord I'm Jesus you remember back there in the Old Testament I came from God and I went back to God actually he was the representative of God in the form of a son because God is a spirit and you can't get a hold of the spirit you can reach out for it but you can't grasp oh try that with a thought you can't get a hold of that thought but it's there I can prove it because I'm thinking it right now see I want you to understand where we came from we came from the very thoughts of God and the word Loos means thought or concept did you know and the word thought comes from conceive conception the very beginning and existence of that's where we came from but there's something interesting about God's thoughts let me finish verse eight and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I love this part because this is the channel the guide the director of God's thoughts are you getting it it's like it's the mind you see we get thoughts and then we send them through our mind to see how they out put on the mind of Christ and they'll turn out just like this run them through the human mind and just like Eve did in the Garden of Eden wow wait a minute now yeah you're starting to make perfect sense to me there yeah let me let me let me think about that let me reason that out no no that's the mistake people are making you cannot prove God by science by education by magic by Machinery by engineering you can only prove God by because that's the way he chose it God proves himself by Fai he puts his faith in what he says and it happens cuz he's got perfect Faith now in Hebrews 6 it says let us go on to Perfection shall we and do you know that the people that have already gone on before us people that were here brother and have gone the leaders the men on that calendar you they're waiting on us it seems like when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time pretty close to Perfection there was love cont but there was still one element missing they they without us can be made they're rooting for you and me they're anticipating they're they're they're actually Desiring for us to find our position in the body of Christ and guess where we're at you see I have a good time when I preach because I believe this brother Christ is the mystery of God revealed now God's secret mystery he had before the world began oh this goes way back this is not an unfamiliar quote but whether you realize it or not this quote refers to you now back in the back part of God's mind how far back is that exactly where back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying can you imagine the prophet of God using the word God trying it makes it sound like there's a problem like a conflict oh yes there can be a problem if we want to make it one but God is going to accomplish it whether you and I decide to be part of it or not but I have decided to follow Jesus back in the back part of God's mind there was what was in the back part of God's mind oh it must have been his thought he must have been keeping one of those thoughts nobody could touch it the prophet of God that not even the man we know is Jesus knew the hour right or the day as if he didn't know the seventh seal oh it was in him did you get that it was in him just like Ephesians 1:4 chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's how back far back this thought he was keeping it why so nobody could touch it nobody could contaminate it nobody could twist it nobody nobody could take it into the laboratory and begin to manipulate nobody could hide hbd it it was kept safe it was sealed up in the back part of the mind of God well brother Chris how do you know that's for us oh the word of God says the first shall be last and the last shall be first you see we have arrived brothers and sisters at this point Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that's what he was keeping he was keeping back the revelation of who Christ is you notice if I had one here I'd bring it up doesn't matter the seal book what does it say on the cover of the seal book does not say the opening of the seven that's right brother it says the revelation of the Seven Seals so therefore it requires God Revelation is faith we put our faith in God God begins to open himself up notice on the Journey of Abraham good now oh I keep I keep my time but when I got it Advantage you realize on the journey God called Abraham and Abraham heeded the call of God think about it put yourself in Abraham what if you went to your mother and your father your children your wife your husb your grandchildren your your co-workers your boss and you said hey God spoke to me last night and he said leave where are you going God didn't tell him where he was going Abraham by faith just started walking because he believed it was God that I don't think you'd be here tonight if you didn't think God hadn't talked to you but this is the part about the Journey of Abraham that means so much to us God never spoke to him again till he got to the next destination that God wanted to talk to him at again in between he never he never talked to certain things had to transpire he had to lose his father is that right he he didn't tell him to take his nephew lot he had to begin to get rid of things but what's really good about the call of God is you don't have to worry about getting rid of lot he'll leave you anyway won't he that's right he said there's not enough room for both of you see my guys and your guys you and they're not getting along that's where all those voices came from think about it this is going on in each one of us even if you're committed like I am to the Lord that old nature comes up every once in a while hey there hey nobody home I know there's somebody in there I see the lights on but you've got to still say nobody's home that's the mistake Eve made Eve answered the door to reason she stopped look what's happening in the world we live in don't stop don't stop if I couldn't leave you with anything else don't stop because what's going on is the opening and the revealing of the thoughts of and we only get those thoughts as God releases them to us and he only releases them to us as we travel down his road and there are certain stopping points you got this far praise the Lord okay now next see and and we have to by faith step to the next stage of the journey to me that's what God is doing let me finish this and I'll stop I'm trying to remember the number you told me there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it so in his great mind oh what a good place to be not in not just his mind in his great mind he wanted these attributes that's you and I read it in your message I don't have time to quote it it's everywhere his thoughts are his attributes his attributes are his children we it and that's what he is going to accomplish he wanted these attributes to be expressed listen now watch the expression and in him was [Music] love I remember an old song from the not the 1860s what the world needs now is love and if it needed it in the 60s about the the world love and the only Bible that many of your friends and will ever you see your written Epistles read of all men and in him was to be a savior to be a father to be a son to be a Healer and all all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God but God wants them out he wants you and I to become the [Music] expression right I love this here I'm going to stop with I got halfway down this one today hang on thank you brother I appreciate it I mean that because I'm serious so we got here adoption well there was nothing to save now remember he wanted to be a savior nothing to save he wanted to be a Healer there was nothing sick he wanted to be a provider but everything was already there H watch his attributes watch his children watch his thoughts and his attributes produced it you see brothers and sisters I'm going to read a little bit more till my time is up but I want you to get this at that stage of the journey in God's mind nobody sick's nobody in there's nobody lost but his attributes his thoughts they were there and they received a signal that he wants to be he wants to be and he wants to and then there was a conference his thoughts got together and said get the dictionary out and look up sickness wasn't in the dictionary yet because there was nothing sick Look up the word lost wasn't anything lost Look up the word provider there no needs let me tell you where you and I come in we raised our hands and we said I'll go that's what Isaiah done well you you mean you're going to leave the comfort and the safy of the mind of God if we came from there we go back to there you see then we knew that then we knew that we were in that theop but today here we are struggling sick uh uh uh you know we get oppression depression I want I want to give you you a little tip a prescription it's not a bottle of pills it's the mind of God we're here because God allowed us to make the choice to be here he wanted each and every one of us tonight to recognize where we came from and once that becomes a revelation nothing can stop it nothing and let me tell you something else about that Revelation it's catchy like fire if you're on fire and you get close to somebody who's in a flammable [Music] suit they're catching on fire it's catchy brother it's the fire of God it's the beginning you know that brother brandham told us this God gave birth to himself brother brother Ernie how by producing his attributes so when God gave birth to himself he was giving birth to you and we just don't realize it yet but the message of the hour it's revealing to you and me by faith that's right you have got to believe it you say well brother you don't I don't have to understand I don't even understand myself brother bram's wife said well Bill nobody understand you and he said I don't even understand myself and we think that brother bradam had his act together he traveled down the same road you and I I had a couple more minutes let me get this this is a different paragraph adoption part two I know you're listening to the adoption series now I didn't know that when I came but I had this already so to me that's a Vindication that God wants it reinforced in listen now let me draw you a little illustration here he says it's good yeah we go back I believe I talked on it a little bit the other night struck on it in Genesis the first chapter 126 when God called his name Lord God God called his own name he's calling ours too right it's in the word of el Elohim Elohim which means the self-existing one there was nothing else existed but him there was no air now you and I have trouble there how's that that's not possible well we're talking about God here there was no air there was no light there was no stars there was no world there was no nothing else it was God and God Alone Elohim El now he made that did you get that he purposed it he made it that way you know why CU we were in him and he would not lose a one so he he started with the self-existent one so that anything that was in him could not be lost do you get that see that inside of that wait a minute self-existent one it looks like this just one oh yes there was but inside that's the next sentence but inside of that was attributes which meant that he was inside of this great L Elohim was an attribute or uh you know what an attribute is let me say it like this was a nature I tell you brothers and sisters this is deep cuz now he's taking us inside of the self-existent one calling them attributes and then he says it's a nature so we are representatives of the nature of god wow even when I say that to myself that's incredible a guy like me I don't deserve it he didn't ask me if I deserved it he asked me if I believed it I believe this I believe this is God's word and last but not least inside of that he was a Healer there was nothing sick to be healed nothing to be sick now do you get the picture this is a photograph you get the picture so his attributes his nature produced what is today please stand praise the Lord isn't God good all the time let's pray Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for these words not because they're mine but because they're your words that you chose to be here father tonight in this very building Lord to be part and partakers Lord of what is a great mystery being unfolded before our very eyes I pray father that your children here father would take no thought for themselves for tomorrow what they shall eat or what they shall wear but that they'll surrender themselves to your thoughts for they are rapturing
