TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he he foretold things that happened exactly the way it was and they know that was God's identification of a prophet and they know that he was God's Prophet you couldn't shake them from it at all even when they seen Peter foret tell those things and come to pass they said this let his shadow pass over me amen that's the church that's the ones that believe it yes sir is revealed by why did Paul say because I I got a p lld d so forth they believe me no he said I forgot all those things of wisdom a man that had to die now I know him in the power of his resurrection that's what I come to you at with a demonstration of God's power what was it making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same works that Jesus did Paul did the same and they seen God the great father that had demonstrated in the burning bush and demonstrated to Paul and here it was being demonstrated and he's the same in every age God's threefold manner yesterday today and forever what Redeemer in his church perence in the coming Kingdom man you see it just as perfect as it can be oh notice the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of Christ Hallelujah there's no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated how Godly or anything else is no man can do it I could sting hard here how many Christians Born Again raise up your hands fill the Holy Ghost all right here we go then all right notice and he will only do it to the predestinated Hallelujah all the father has given me will come and no man can come except the father he's giving him to me for a look at that priest said this man's be El he's a fortune teller he's a devil that little old woman walking around there living with six husbands she living with five and had the six one then and Jesus said go get your husband come here she said I have no husband said yes you've got six you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband she said sir what that light struck that seed when it struck that priest they said this man is a fortune teller see no life they hybrid you come up as far as a organization but died from their own but This Woman's not a hybrid said sir I perceive I can see her big pretty eye shine up like that tears running on her cheeks say sir I perceive that you're a prophet I'm looking for our Messiah and when that Messiah comes he'll do this very same thing he'll tell us these things he said I'm he oh Lord she left her there he is come see a man who's told me the things what was it that light struck that seed that life was there come forth same thing today but the theologians say I wait just a minute I find out it so and so Pastor Moody said or what's Pastor Moody got to do with this this day Pastor Moody lived in his day when not now certainly Luther lived in his day but not in the day of Wesley Wesley lived in his day not the day of Pentecost Pentecost Liv their day but they're long ways from this we're in the last hour sure there are organizations and Scruples that proves that it's not there the word has never been correctly Vindicated just only in his strength seeds denominations and it make the domination put that old gson weed seeds in with that genuine wheat died right out crop went to Jon right green BRS and nettles Hallelujah see went on back to that it died right out then it broke the field up and started over again PL some real seeds and some of them come up and choked it out but then God said in this last days he'd bring out of people washing his blood and they were predestinated to be there they've got to be there God said so and it would reveal and the Very sign I was Malachi for what he would do restore back again Hallelujah bring back in the last days these great things that he promis bring the Revelation what is what see to do Malachi for was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children see that's right bring that same thing the same pillar fire and on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same Jesus making him the same preaching him the same vindicating him the same yesterday today and forever I will restore sayeth the Lord all the years that the methodists were in the cat pillar worm and Baptist and the Catholic and all them worms eat that that Faith down to become a denominational stump where there's no seeds left in there but I will restore again sayith the Lord all the years what all the signs and wonders that they forsaken I'll take it right back to that original tree again and I will restore it sayith the Lord that Prophet was a Vindicated Prophet his words has to come to pass amen the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of Christ and has been in all ages remember all ages who did the word of the Lord come to Prophet alone that's right is that right and the prophet had to be Vindicated first not because he said he was a prophet because he was born a prophet and proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then everything else let go see it was the word of the Lord came only by the Holy Ghost the Bible said the man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the word look John the Baptist would never had known Jesus if it hadn't been for the Holy Ghost pointing him out that right John the Baptist that great prophet that come forth and said this one standing among you right now there an ordinary man standing here somewhere that's the Lamb of God John said that I bore record I bear a record I saw the spirit of God the Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a dove and it went upon me and a voice said this is my beloved Son whom I'm pleas what was it the holy ghost that I point him out that's the only way you know him today only way you'll get the three-fold revelation of God is for the Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever be is you're predestinated to see it if it don't you'll never see it Hallelujah if you're not predestinated to see it you'll never see it cuz that light conf fashion you'll go away and make fun of it and explain it away with some intellectual conception when the very God himself manifesting himself and proving it see but if it ain't up on you to see it you won't see it God never just said I'll choose this one choose that but he knew by his reason he could predestinate because he's infinite and he he knows he's infinite so therefore he knowed everything he know the end he could tell the end from the beginning he's God if he can't do that he's not God yes he's the infinite all right John would have never known him no sir had the Holy Ghost not pourn out see how God God hides his mystery to the high educated and everything look every one of them people say in Simplicity reveals it to whom he has predestinated to see it look at there others standing by never even seen the dove they never heard no voice for it was always sent to that predestinated seed predestinated certainly was predestinated Isaiah 712 years before he was born in the spirit raised up out these human senses and said there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord and make his isah could see couldn't Malachi see the same thing predestinated last prophet sealing off all the prophets of the Old Testament that man that great prophet stand there at the end of the age he see is predestinated certainly he was Malachi saw him too Jesus said if you can receive it this is he was of i s My Messenger before my face Malachi 3 to prepare the way before me see sure he was predestinated to see that message no wonder he can look at and see that Dove coming down that light that was in the wilderness with Israel coming moving down the God himself saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in God in man becoming one I bear witness John said I'll beheld him the only begotten of the father amen I'm a witness of it amen there you are Hallelujah Simplicity with an old preacher his father his father was a great Theologian you know he come out of a school looked like he'd went back to his father's denomination that would have been the will of God when God touched him at his birth back there and he received the Holy Ghost three months before he's born Hallelujah yes sir when Mary went up there and little John was 6 months old in his mother's womb and had never them little muscles had never moved yet and Mary was afraid the little muscles were growing but she couldn't feel no l wife Elizabeth his mother brother and when Mary come up and grabbed her and hugged her put her arms laid hands on her and God has spoke to me and I'm going to have a baby too are you and Joseph maryed no Mary how can this be the Holy Ghost shall overshadow me and now be created in me I shall call his name Jesus he'll be the Son of God and as soon as that word Jesus spoke Little John begin to leap and Shout jump down she said blessed be the Lord God for whence comes the mother of my Lord the mother of my Lord oh when comes the mother of my lord for as soon as your salutation come into my ears my baby leaped in the womb for Joy no wonder he didn't want no Seminary something indoctrinate him or something other he had a important job he was a man of the Wilderness went out into the Wilderness and waited God told him out there now revealed to him oh there's your Revelation again now I'll tell you who he is you're a prophet the words to you you know who you are you got to come that answers a question from last Sunday you know who you are John keep yourself quiet don't say nothing one out there and when you see this one there'll be a sign coming from heaven like a light a dove will come down that'll be him when you see him that's the reason when Jesus walked out in the water John looked over he seen that Dove coming down he said said Behold the Lamb of God there he is he's the one that will take away the sin of the world Jesus walk right straight out in the water to him them two eyes of John met them two eyes of Jesus they were second cousins by flesh Mary and Elizabeth were first cousin their eyes met one another there was God and His Prophet amen stand there John said I have need to be baptized of thee why Come Thou to me Jesus said suffer it to be so now but remember thus it Beth us to fulfill all righteousness why did John do it because he was the sacrifice John was a prophet he know and the sacrifice has got to be washed before it's presented and he suffered him and he baptized him when he had low the heavens open oh my that Dove come down upon him and a boy said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in King James puts it in whom I'm pleased to dwell so it's just the way you want to turn it around same thing dwell in her this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell or to dwell in either one you want to put it same thing all right we see then it was revealed to him others stand there didn't hear nothing about it the Holy Ghost alone reveals it same when he reveals himself to Paul another predestinated seed there was Paul going around he M said if I get a hold of that Bunch I'll tear them to Pieces because I'm Dr sa I'll come up under Gia I Come From The Moody Bible or some other one see I'm a scholar I don't what I'm talking about I'll tear that bunch of holy rollers to pieces I tell you great Holy Father you just give me the permission to go down there and I'll arrest every one of them noise makers down there all this Divine Healing stuff we'll stop it put in his pocket said I'm M rode down that day about 11:00 in the day of light shed in his face and he fell to the Earth while he was a predestinated seed God said I have chose him I'm going to show him what great things he'll suffer for my name's sake i s to the Gentiles and disgrace him in every way that they can be disgrace but yet he'll bear my name Paul went out the ENT he got all his ecclesiastical stuff cut off of him down backside the desert for three years and a half down there in Arabia until he learned the word and the word become he and he become a prisoner here he come back in Chains of love all my Seminary experiences gone I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen Filman my brother I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ I only can speak and say what he tells me God needs prisoners today hallelu that'll prison yourself to his will to his word that's what Paul whisper no matter how much intellectual he learned he had knowed God by Revelation the intellectual went all the way out of the business saying when the Revelation come which upon the rock the church is built yes sir notice he was a predestinated seed the Holy Ghost alone shows you who he is there's no man they'll make you father Son and Holy Ghost and everything else out of it see but the Holy Ghost will reveal him as the Lord God Of Heaven made manifest that is oh him now I no this not prophets not Kings not nothing else but here for the first time God was revealed in Christ in the fullness of the godhead bodily and human flesh that's the Revelation oh my going to sing you a verse now now nations are breaking Israel's Awakening are they the signs that the prophets foretold the

and we're together gathered in seated in Heavenly places we might not be together phys physically but it's the spirit that counts amen amen also want to thank Pastor Montoya for offering me or allowing me to come and making me welcome here and I understand there's a convention in May 25 and so we've been invited to that too so we'll be coming here the Lord willing and find out that there are more than more more and more people people that believe this word than there are those that stand against this word can everybody say amen amen well praise the Lord let's gather together the scriptures here Revelations chapter 19 it's good to see all of your smiling faces so when I say that that's a hint for everybody to smile you do that when it's good to see your smiling face everybody but it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen David said I was glad when they said unto me let's go into the house of the Lord amen Revelations 19 and we'll go uh verse 6 through 8 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many water ERS and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth amen verse seven reads let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready and verse eight and to her was granted I love this and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints amen let us pray father we love you certainly thank you uh to for your presence that we know is here already knowing Lord that there are millions of churches across the United States that no doubt are inviting your presence or trying to invite your presence but Lord there are a few churches that call themselves by the bride Lord and we know that you have said where two or three are gathered in my name there you'd be in the midst of them we're so glad Lord to know that you're here and Lord praying that you would get us out of the way so that we can Minister your word say what you want us to say and that you would receive all the honor and all the glory and all the praise because you're the only one that can receive such you are the only one that deserves it all we ask these blessings on the word today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because there is none greater can we say Amen you may have your seats amen amen I want to just kind of not be in a hurry but but don't I don't want to take too much time how many by a show of hands can witness that we are living in the last days according to prophecy now if you'll keep that hand up how many is glad that they are living in these days I might look all over the building everybody's excited we we have never been this close I think I saw a picture of the Doomsday Clock about a year ago when Palestine uh about a year ago when Palestine first attacked Israel and it was such a big deal that they had moved the clock to 3 seconds till midnight and you know how it is when they begin to settle down they move it back and forth and so on but I got a picture the other day somebody sent me an article and in this article they had it moved past midnight are you listening now in other words saying it is way past time for this place to be done when Palestine attacked Israel I had told the home church and and anybody who' listen that it was absolutely thus sayith the Lord it was not going to stop now that it was a battle that is going to continue until the end of time as far as we're concerned are you with me now we know that there's a lot of things that need to take place we know that there are a lot of events that need to happen but I believe brother Brian said at one point he said there is nothing left to happen except the coming of the Lord and he said everything that was left could happen in the next five minutes you begin to wonder if that's possible but how quickly things are now moving With God all things are possible and it can all be over in five minutes and some might say well what about this and what about that I thought this was to come back I thought there was supposed to be a meeting here or this or that I'm not trying to figure out any other mystery all I know I was told to do by Jesus was to watch and pray was to watch and pray I was told to keep my lamp trimmed I was told to keep my uh garment white I was told to pray I was told to look up I was told to look for him to return the only thing I need to make sure that I do not miss is the return of Jesus Christ who comes before after this or that got nothing to do with me are you listening can you say amen I I I don't know about you brother M but I was not looking for Jesus but Jesus found me I was not looking for the word but the word found me I was not looking looking for uh the message but the message found me I was not looking for a revelation of whether I was bride or not but that Revelation found me I was not looking to marry Jesus Christ but marriage came along that way not because I loved him or that I was looking for his love but because he first loved me oh is it doesn't that make you excited I didn't look for the the revelation of any mystery but those Revelations found me I didn't look to be a a a Ministry a minister but that found me I was not ever trying to be a pastor but that calling found me somebody help me now I was not looking for the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost found me I was not looking for forgiveness of but forgiveness found me I was not looking for Grace but Amazing Grace hallelujah hallelujah and that makes us the happiest people on the Earth so what are you trying to say I'm not looking for brother Brandon's return I'm not against it he has to come back he will come back I'm not looking for the tent but if there is one it will find me you understand I don't have to look for it brother I'll be there if anything needs to happen to get me from here to there I'll be there I'll be there nobody's going to take me out well brother K you never believed it it don't matter I'm walking in anyway I don't I didn't say I don't believe it it's just we we we we we're focusing on too many things that don't look don't worry about it God let God manifest his word by bringing it to pass God will vindicate his word by bringing it to pass we don't need anybody we don't need anybody trying to make it happen it's going to happen we didn't we didn't have nothing to do with Israel going back to their Homeland God caused that to happen we can't force unity in the bride but circumstances will cause that to happen look when the pressure comes down the brother you didn't really want to talk to or the sister you tried to avoid suddenly may become your best friend I'm so glad to see you can we pray together I need a loaf of bread I need to feed my children unite our faith together and let's speak the word do you know where any believers are gathering say well they shut down all the churches but where are they Gathering oh about 30 miles that way but we don't have gasoline we don't got any cars well let's just speak the word get there as a thought there's going to be a short quick work so I'm looking for the resurrection even before I see the Rapture I've got to see the dead in Christ I told a couple of people I've been thinking about and mentioning brother green a lot lately and I thought to myself well I either miss him or his presence is nearby so can that happen yeah I'm looking for brother Bernie aren't you I'm went to hear Brother green go you got to do that in Spanish yeah okay right there's going to come when your grandparents will be seen your grandparents will be seen any other believer that has gone on May walk through the door through the wall and take get ready coming of the Lord is at hand either we're either going to believe it or we're going to leave it but as for me and my house as for for me and we are looking for the coming his wife has got to make herself ready no groom ever goes into the bride's chamber let me help you with your dress he ain't even supposed to be in there let me help you with your shoes he ain't got nothing to do with it his job is to get ready his job is to stand there with the best man his job wait for her to walk down the the announcement is made here comes the bride Here Comes the Bride here comes the she has made her can somebody shout amen we're at that hour We're Here we are here the day that we've been waiting for is finally here my god oh Hallelujah when that happened a year ago October the 7th when Palestine attacked I made a a bold assumption said with all the technology did you really think Israel didn't know Palestine was going to do that they knew but they had to have a reason we'll talk a little bit is that okay and now Iran has attacked Israel do you really think Israel didn't know they were going to do that they knew but then they made a statement thus now we have a legitimate reason you out kind of strange they still haven't really done much have you noticed that but I I told some of the Brethren I said it's like a box a boxer he'll go in there and he'll let the other guy punch himself out and just wait patiently and when they see them kind of wearing down then they can lower the boom on them Israel is just waiting for the right time Israel is just collecting five smoth Stones Little David is just waiting for the right time to do what they got to do and it might just be once we're out of here I'm just saying I've noticed that every time they do attack every time they do strike they hit very precis L they took out the leader of Hezbollah and then they took out the next guy and did you hear what happened with the third guy that's coming upar what he said he said I'm going to return to Iran and pray before accepting this position I thought that's a very wise man but I got to tell the church the other day I said you know what I'm not saying this is so and I've always been kind of foggy on how yeah on how the two prophets are supposed to fit in how Happ I said but Israel is so precise it almost makes you wonder is there a Prophet or two telling them where to strike just a thought just what I'm trying to get you to do is is is provoke your spiritual thinking come on say Amen loud of that I got to challenge your spiritual mind the time for passing it on to another age is over there is no other age after this you got two people coming in trying to get in office personally for the first time ever think that voting for me is a waste of time it doesn't matter who wins she's getting in and and I I I I kind of blame that on all the stubborn message people who just had to see her go in ready you see what I'm saying we've got to do something to shake your mind up got to happen what more needs to take place for you to realize the bridegroom is calling what more needs to happen behold the bridegroom come the Gabriel call is going out has to be said what more has to be seen what more has to be manifested we must realize we are living in the days of the voice and the voice is saying come up higher be not partakers of her sins somebody say praise the Lord his wife has made herself ready Hab 2 verse 2 and 3 I'm not going to turn there we're just going to quote it but basically says the vision begins to take place it said wait for it for it will not t but then when it does it will not stop it will not be patient you cannot stop the Lord from his return there's going to come a time and I believe this and I'm sorry for this but not that sorry but there's going to come a time long suffering is over now I don't want anybody to do you want anybody to miss it I don't want no one to miss it brother Bram said I want my family to make it he said I want my friends to make it do yall know the rest of it he said I even want my enemies to make and I think that's the part where he got to still work on huh there's going to come a time are you with me when the scripture is going to be fulfilled let he who filthy be filthy still and let he who's clean be clean I'm not talking about a legalistic work or a list of Dos or don'ts I'm talking about doing the very best that you can to live and to walk in the of Jesus Christ with gratitude and humility and Desperation Lord I don't want to do anything that'll displease you ever we're not in a religion in a relationship this is not this is not a I don't serve him because I have to I serve him because I want to I don't love him because I have to I love him because he first loved Falling In Love With Jesus is the best decision I ever made come on somebody say Amen when you fall in love with him even your trials don't seem like a big asked brother Brandon one time how do you deal with the trials how do you deal with what they're saying brother BR said I don't let it get to me how do you not let it get to you you know what he said he said how could I you're all predestinated for me in other words God knows what you have need of God knows what's going to take you and I say every trial that we go through is tailor made just for you that trial will not fit me and my trial may be too big for you right I might want to lose some weight so I can fit into his trial but they're made just for you but so is the answer and so is the delivery and so is the escape the way out made just for you how do I get out of Jesus Christ said I am I am the truth I am the life come on somebody say that's how you know you're in love with Jesus the only way he's the only only

Civil War there was two sides gray and blue North and South slaves are no that's if this country went into a civil war there are so many factions and parties and groups we don't know we don't know who's on who side so we're all going to get our guns and hang out with brother Monto at his house they all got nervous like I ain't never been there but I'll find my way way we have a brother back home said come on he got like 10 acres said come on down BR you won't need him for very long if you need him at all brother bran made a statement th he said Russia he said Russia has a bomb with our name on it she was raised up to destroy us in judgment and brother BR said when they hang the bomb over our heads and bring America to her knees well it might even be in this country already right but then he went on to say something else he said but before the first bomb lands you'll be in glory shaking hands with your belever before it ever gets here some other place we'll go back to a country we'll go back to the city whose Builder and maker is God I'm going back to the city where the lamb is the life going to a city where there cometh no night I have a meion over there he said behold I prepare a place for you in my father's so many if it was not so I and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again I will come again to receive you to receive you to myself that where I am where I am where I am you may be also oh somebody say Amen my personal invitation you may be there also you know what that means you don't have to be if you don't want to be but you may be how many wants to be oh Lord Don't Forget Me Remember Me Lord can you say praise the Lord amen there's something special brother green used to say I never understood this part but he said when we all get to heaven we have a water right he said when we all get to heaven I asked because they're so neatly stacked so I didn't want to break it up you know well that was a Satan's poison I'm glad I didn't grab that you're going to have to tell me whatever this is all about I where is the anointing oil oh here it is all right but brother green us to say when we get to heaven we're all going to speak German know speak the and huh I no why I don't know huh but he did say that Spanish is the RO most romantic language there is say amen amen all right so he said we'd all sing in Spanish I said you know what I believe that you know I thought in a room full of Hispanics they get all excited I thought I was going to hear you know something nothing I said we're all going to sing [Applause] Spanish right I know I know he's coming in the morning help well you'll get it you'll be walking down the street tomorrow and you're going to go I am happy he's coming just just think about it as I Glide through the air farewell farewell Sweet Hour of Prayer no more wondering no more guessing no more confusion no more pleading and begging for God to forgive you because you did it again no more cry out for your sons and daughters because you'll be holding her hand as you go don't you understand what I'm getting at now who would want to stay here one more minute if you don't have to even so Lord even so anyhow he said we'd be singing in Spanish I realize that the Spanish language does things in Translation to the English language that most other languages don't do for example if I say I am the alpha say it slowly I am the alpha there's a masculine there and then if I say I am the Omega GA thank you Omega now that's a feminine side to that no other language does that not even English one not even English so but the Spanish language a beautiful secret in Spanish Jesus is saying I am he and I am she you're getting it you're getting it you're getting it right but Omega means end so he's not just any SE he's the end time SE he's not just any bride he's in the end time I am the alha the I'm the beginning and I'm the end if you can wrap your heart around that you realize you're not going to miss this because he's carrying you in oh hallelujah hallelujah a't that beautiful I think it is amen the Lord is going to restore he's restoring Israel now he been restored but you see what I mean I think it's strange brother that for years we've told Iran they can't have nuclear weapons they're not allowed to have bombs we don't want to hear that and we make threats we don't carry them out but we put sanctions on them we put the what they call that um tariffs on them then we we've just uh I call it black B what they call it where they um well anyway they boycott it anything I don't know that Iran makes anything but anything they make and and then Israel comes along and says we're going to destroy their nuclear plants something we said we want them not to have but Israel says we're going to do it the United States says see you're all quiet because you're just as confused as I am there's something wrong with this picture to the unbeliever it's okay but to the believer we realize the United States has turned her back on her Ally you see it we're at the end time I can't say that no more because it like it's just going to get I don't want to get morbid on you I want it to be life to you brother Brandon said this about Eve the bride Eve let's remember this the first one she was promised to be a redeemer okay she was promised to be a redeemer and then her Redeemer uh her Redeemer would be her Redeemer would be the worst is that right and when the word came made flesh what she rejected see that was the first one and then in this particular quote here he goes on to talk about how the the Israelite Hebrews in the Old Testament they were a second Eve in this particular and they rejected her but he talks about this end time Eve whether it's two or three don't matter he's talking about this end time Eve and he said she will never [Music] fail she's not going to fall right how many if I could ask this how many is battling something uh you got don't stand up and say what it is but if you got something you know I don't care if it's health or some kind of whatever it might be if you got a struggle right now you and you're thinking to yourself I don't know did you see that even your pastor ra even I raised my hand ain't nobody perfect here right and you may be wondering if this particular struggle is going to keep out now brother monya this is just brother Cale I I I I I was when I was sitting there I had an emergency prayer meeting the day that Iran attacked Israel and as many people that would come we prayed and basically we wanted to just make sure that if this is the eve of your coming I want to know that I'm in the right place I want to know my life is all right and I was talking to one of the brethren in the office and just I guess I got very transparent and I said my life is not ready for what's coming wow you can hear a pin drop now and the brother said mine Nei and he goes what are we going to do I like I was like what are you asking me for and I said you know I said we're going to lean on the grace of God this this is just me I don't think that it is possible for anybody in their flesh to ever not make a mistake because this belongs to Satan right so much so that he challenged Michael the Archangel for the body of Moses see and it gives me pleasure because it gets me to understand God is not coming back for this he's coming back for the only part of him that belongs to him and that's that scene that he has placed there before the foundation of and this seed has never has never has never has never has never done anything wrong that se brother chewy has never sinned do you believe that in your flesh it's hard to understand but how can something perfect live in your heart and make a mistake what was that cannot happen it cannot happen he who is perfect if he lives in your heart I know your flesh buffets you every day I know it does I'd like to tear it off and fight right it'd be a funny picture yeah I've seen people do that and I wondered to myself does that work you know I've seen people do that you know what it is frustration the O the power the devil tries to have over your mind to over over think to overthink brother sister we can overthink so bad that you'll think the mailman is stalking you because show up every day at the same time think about it you can get that I was going to say nuts crazy you got I was looking for examples of that last night just overthinking I don't have my phone with me can I phone a phone well good for you all I just want to like oh here I'll pretend this is one and this lady oh okay there thank you let me see what you got on this by the way oh yeah can I get a Samsung yeah no you know the Apple was the first fruit never mind all right and look he's looking at oh it's a pretty picture look and he's this lady's filming the mail band I'm not kidding I got thata she goes he's here every day I'm G confront him and he walks up the mailman's to he's getting organized he he goes me yeah I want you to leave me alone I'm recording you this is for they had to do something with this lady stop stalking me he goes talking you're here every single day the guy goes I'm doing my job but she you know overthinking he was stalking her the guy drops off packages too oh my goodness it's and what what to point out is it's Insanity The Devil is trying to get you to a point of insanity just you the thought goes over and over and over and over and it makes sense to you but to everybody else what are you talking about that never happened I never said this I never said that who never did this so let me just help you so you don't have to try and reason with it no more this body sin it did this body fails dies but the seed that in your heart has been perfect before the foundation of the world it will never fail and God is coming back for that do you think you need a new body why else do you think need a new body this one can't stand in the presence of God but I'm looking for one that can brother BR said I'll step into it and he said it'll be the last you'll feel a little pinched I think he a little pain said but it'll be the last pain you ever feel come on somebody say Amen are you with me or not I'm tired of overthinking tired of my brain frying I'm try I'm tired of trying to figure out how things are going to work oh I just want to trust God only trust him only trust him only trust him now he will save you and he will keep you only TR trust God now amen amen we say I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's no more to give and we said I want to love love till there's just no more how can you do this in this body it's impossible but with God and that God gen god seing with the Capstone love all things are possible it's not this that loves it's this that loves you don't need a love we need agap love we don't need we don't need lustful feelings we need Perfection to love each other and walk in the Glory all kind of things tore up dragging in you know but then we get there realizing that it was nothing that we could do to earn our way in so fear not little flock I said fear not little flock for it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom believest thou this just's a few more scriptures I'm done Revelation 22:17 I had a different way that was going to go but God knows what he's doing I'm not sure what time I'm going to be done but I'm done thank you brother how many appreciates your pastor here not yelling at you not trying to tell you what to do he's just trying to assure that you got your place in your kingdom excuse I want you to remember something the king and the queen are not equal they're not equal yes she has the same power yes he backs her up but without him she's not a queen without her he's still the king remember where all the honor and Glory goes to remember where your your gratitude goes to this may not rhyme in Spanish but the right attitude shows gratitude I heard another brother Say be humble don't grumble right we have to remember who we are we're not chosen because we're somebody be blessed not stressed can you say Amen we worry too much remember one thing you're not predestinated because you're beautiful and all this he simply chose you and that's it I don't know why he chose me I may not have but I'm glad he did 2217 of Revelation says and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely and then at the same chapter verse 20 and 21 it says he which testify these things say surely I come quickly amen even so John said even so typ of the Bride so the bride says so come Lord Jesus I know that there's a lot may miss it there's nothing I can do about that but I also know that there's a lot of us that are going to be there and I I guess uh I was trying to say it this way but my long s my my desire to see him is beginning to outweigh my long suffering you know look Lord just just if we could find 50 Lord if you could find 40 That's Abraham right if there' be 10 Lord suddenly you know I'm like Lord if you'll just restore this one if you'll just restore that one but the more I talk to him the more I just want to see him my balance is now off and I'm not afraid to say so I want to see him more than live another day I'd rather see him more than tomorrow sunrise I want to see him more than watch another inauguration of another hypocrite get in the office I want to oh I want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever of Saving Grace that's what I want isn't that what you want it's just off now come quickly Lord I want to see you I've had enough of this world I've had enough for the trials I don't want to fail anymore I don't want to be disgusted with myself anymore I don't want to be frustrated with myself anymore I want to see you Lord the prophet of God said this he said if you want to if you want to escape the world uh to escape your Tri or to get away from your your finances I'm throwing in there whatever your problem is he said he'll never come that way he said but when you get to a place and you're desperate your desperation sets in and all you want to do is see his face he'll come then how many wants to see him how many's had enough raise your hands with me Lord I need you right now this is where I'm at this is how I feel and I see I'm in a room full of Believers that feel the same and I know dear God that the church back home believes the same granted father we pray not to live to see another day but to live to see your face for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus Christ name as Pastor comes God bless you stand up please the more I I hear individuals speak the more I tell myself why the bride needs to be in step we are out of Step let me be frank with you the bride today is out of Step she does what she wants to do she doesn't want to be subject she doesn't want to be disciplined she does and she will do until as the brother said God reveals to her I'm waiting for that Dimension to open up waiting for that door to open I long to see the faces of those gone on but if I'm not born again no good he didn't say filled with the Holy Ghost he said you must be born again that's that's our problem we think we're born again the Bible tells me I love it in Spanish you're subject of those that have account of your life who is it who's going to give an account for you phix li house when you go without asking permission before you tell me I'm going here are you telling me or are you asking the bride needs to be in Step she doesn't know post to duty because like Adam left his post now you can he left his post when he should have been Vigilant he fell asleep he didn't listen to God even Satan said God is a liar and they accepted that Revelation or the lady accepted or Eve accepted that Revelation because she took and that's what we do today we're in the end time there's no more room to play church either I'm in church or I'm out of the will of God let me say it again it's time to take all that dust out of us we have too much dust and we talk about the brother sitting next to us look at yourself in the mirror yourself ready there's an angel a recording writing everything down that we do so I tell you this morning thank you I needed that we need it we need to understand there is no more time time is running out no more time I'm not I am not I am not I am not a reformer I can't reform you you better start living like a Christian you better start doing what the message tells you you don't cut your hair do it don't question the word of God brought To Us by our [Music] Prophet is our Apostle what he told us but no one wants to follow but he brought why it's Disobedience Disobedience let's start waking up wake up amen if your thoughts are contrary to the word of God if your actions are to the word of God time that we get back in step we know the vision of being in Step he saw a bride brother she wasn't dressed right and he continued to say he saw you today the way we dress yes today I can go down the downtown or to a supermarket and what a disgrace what a disgrace of people saying we're a Christian Nation brother Brenham said what a beautiful picture in today of a consecrated life I need to have a consecrated life today not tomorrow today in other words quit using what you use get back in Step you got to be in church on Sunday be in church on Sunday don't give me an excuse if I'm going to give an account for each and every one of you what am I going to say somebody will receive my report someone when that Gathering comes I will give a report every one of you well I I didn't I didn't want to go to church today or that church is better better than this church or that preacher is better than this church that is rotten brother Brandon me the same thing happened with lot and Abraham it wasn't the ministry it was the ly my pastor is better than your pastor my church is better than your church that's a bunch of Tommy rock all churches are sovereign I believe that chur live according to the discipline brother brought us I see hair dudes today that you us into the church we don't know that there's an anointing behind everything we do you can sit there and look at me while he doesn't understand I went through what you went through but I'm going to tell you I wasn't a Believer then I was a renegade today we should be Guided by a tutor if we want an adoption we better have a tutor and the tutoring starts behind this pit say the way I said it behind this pul starts the adoption process not you it's behind pit behind the pulit the pastor better tell you doing this wrong because on that day we have no excuses the bad part Pastor doesn't want a pastor in other words he's afraid you're not going to pay him tithing let me put it this way I don't receive tithing I don't need your tithing God gave me a pension that I don't need to worry you do or you don't so I'm going to tell you we either get in step or we're gonna be left behind there's no an if or buts now if you're bright stand up this this morning the bride is covered by the blood of Jesus Christ We Are You Are I Am the blood of Jesus Christ walking on two feet I am we are you are the word made flesh and if you're the word made flesh you better start looking life quit trying to bring the denomination into the church we have a discipline pure unadulterated word of God governs our life this morning now if you want that you want to be go uh governed by the Holy Spirit raise your hand you want to be by the Holy Spirit you may not understand it but you want to be governed by the Holy Spirit put your hands down and listen to this the Holy Spirit that's what it is brother Brenham said be careful the reason he said be careful if it's against the word of God the word of God a spirit it's not the Holy Spirit the holy spirit will never let a person do something wrong in their life it will stop him but it's like the brother said this hybrid flesh I tell you this morning you think you believe that you're sinners I say yes I believe we're Sinners because that's flesh it's not inside of the heart that seed that real the Royal the real the real you doesn't sin but the flesh is what sins When you pray because you did something wrong not from in here what you did wrong was this the flesh this flesh right here but I heard an apostle say this sooner or later you will govern this flesh that's what I want be the ruler of the word of God and to re and to say I am I am perfect I am perfect the word of God he doesn't see he sees the blood and if I am the blood how can I sin then Hess young men young people it's ending time is ending there's no more time to play around God has a plan that plan we should follow it that plan it's written in your heart I tell you this when you come into Christ Christ is the an anointed the world Fades away we don't have the world inside of us anymore but it's around us the anointing of the [Music] world it's not inside of me the things of the world are [Music] hovering am in a condition so weak that anointing comes in takes me as a prisoner what I don't want to do and that's the reason why that I say careful because that anointing it's double anointing brother Brenham said 200 million Spirits are coming after the why to do one thing to destroy us he wants to destroy you this morning so what are we goingon to do brother Chey he mentioned you apply the blood apply the blood not only to yourself not only to your family your loved ones the mantles of the door that's what we need to start doing dedicating our Liv unto the Lord Jesus CHR is it going to be hard well yes everything is hard that's why brother Brenham said you don't suffer you can't rain that's why the suffering every day we suffer you're going to suffer in your death bed and the one that makes you suffer that brings everything to your mind is Satan nothing has changed history repeats itself he destroyed the first bride destroyed the second bride but let me tell you bright cannot be deceived time Bri cannot that's why I speak hard that's why I'm strict that's why I discipline individual you think it's easy no it's not but somebody will give an account for each and every one of us it's not the minister it's not Theo it's not your neighbor that seems a wey wey wey there I am I will give an account that's what the Old Testament said you're under tutors and he's going to say the correct and the incorrect what do you want this morning what do we need this morning [Music] what I need is a renewing I need a renewing I need a change every day I need to be born again not once every day in my life you better be born again because every day we fall short of his glory there's a person I wanted prayer this morning so I want Angel to come forth brother Brenham said Christianity and religion become a pleasure to every believer that's what I need in my life [Music] if you need something God just hold on I'm waiting for young man this young man decided he was going to join the military I like your hair get closer don't be afraid of me the hair he has turned around I want you to see his hair family friends that ain't the hair he's going to have he ain't going to have any hair they're going to chop it all off I would say maybe it's a number one maybe a half I don't know I'm not a barber but that whole head's going to look like that how many of you want to join the military all right here I am I want to join the military I am in the military Jesus Christ is milit so I got to learn discipline and obedience and being loyal Nothing Else Matters three things that they will knock

Trini get around behind them brother [Music] Caleb Lord Jesus here we are we have a double portion of your spirit today we are the oil I don't need oil to anoint me I have your portion in me and the
