[27:04] God bless you once again
[27:07] let's take advantage that we're standing
[27:10] to read the scripture
[27:14] everything else
[27:16] Hebrews 911
[27:24] this is the base scripture for the topic
[27:27] we've been covering
[27:30] over the Plan of Redemption
[27:33] is
[27:45] because the blessing is not there for
[27:47] not only for the one who reads but the
[27:48] one who hears
[27:50] and the word is the prophecyte
[28:07] in the word of God reads but Christ
[28:09] being come in high priest of good things
[28:11] to come by greater and more perfect
[28:13] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[28:15] to say not of this building
[28:17] is
[28:28] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[28:30] but by his own blood he entered in once
[28:33] into the holy Place having obtained
[28:34] Eternal Redemption for us
[28:45] purification de la carne
[28:48] for if the blood opposing goats in the
[28:50] ashes of in heaven sprinkling the
[28:52] unclean Sanctified to the purifying of
[28:53] the flesh
[28:58] is
[29:07] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[29:09] who through the eternal spirit offered
[29:11] himself without spot to God Purge your
[29:13] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[29:15] Living God amen amen
[29:21] God add the blessing to the reading of
[29:23] his word
[29:24] please have kind of take your seats
[29:37] I believe we're in the best place
[29:44] here in church worshiping our Lord Jesus
[29:47] Christ
[29:49] our pastor find himself out of town
[29:55] thank you for the opportunity he gives
[29:56] us this morning
[29:59] to be able to express a little bit of
[30:01] what's in our hearts
[30:09] and like I've always said to continue
[30:11] motivating each other to pray for each
[30:13] other
[30:15] to keep our pastor in prayer always
[30:22] the power of God always manifests
[30:26] to fulfill the purpose for which which
[30:29] he was called for amen amen amen
[30:31] sincerely
[30:39] [Music]
[30:43] throughout the week in San Luis we had a
[30:45] sensible loss in La Familia Lopez
[30:47] Gallardo and the Lopez Gallardo family
[30:50] our brother Federico yeah
[30:54] find himself over there with some other
[30:57] brothers as well
[30:59] accompanying him or De La Familia part
[31:02] of the family
[31:16] but we know that a Christian
[31:19] doesn't die
[31:22] of God only goes to sleep and there's a
[31:26] promise
[31:27] a promise of Resurrection
[31:30] [Music]
[31:33] it is like God always fulfills his
[31:35] promises
[31:37] when the Son of God rest upon that is
[31:41] something that is an assurance
[31:51] and we give thanks to the brothers who
[31:53] are right now supporting down in San
[31:54] Luis uh
[31:57] Carlos
[32:00] and his wife
[32:02] they're coming from Hawaii City
[32:05] it's a pleasure to have us with us amen
[32:07] God bless
[32:12] I also had a gun some time
[32:18] for a while now
[32:21] it's always a pleasure
[32:26] and what better to be in the house of
[32:28] God seeing one another yes
[32:33] what God is going to do for us
[32:43] it's a mystical people
[32:50] the focus we give it
[32:52] the way in which we see things
[32:58] other results
[33:01] [Music]
[33:05] that's what we're going to continue with
[33:07] the Plan of Salvation
[33:10] has been speaking on
[33:34] [Music]
[33:37] sometimes we try to interpret God and
[33:39] understand them based on the point of
[33:41] view we have
[33:44] so many times it's not what we read
[33:49] but it's more so how much are we going
[33:51] to keep and apply what we have read
[33:54] Anton says
[33:59] so it could be that maybe we only know
[34:01] one scripture
[34:03] but that one scripture is
[34:08] we read it over and over and analyze it
[34:10] and apply it and we meditate
[34:16] then if we read the complete
[34:19] and we didn't meditating the Bible at
[34:21] all
[34:41] in the hearts of men
[34:43] foreign
[35:17] it's always been based on Revelation
[35:21] foreign
[37:12] the church that made God
[37:32] in Revelations 3 14 it describes the
[37:35] conditions which this church finds
[37:37] itself
[37:40] so we have to be assured that we can
[37:42] understand
[37:45] what is the condition of the age
[37:50] what is
[37:53] going to try to pull us in this is
[38:04] like we've never had it before
[38:14] the church finds itself in a lukewarm
[38:17] condition
[38:18] because they have the word
[38:22] physically there's access to the world
[38:28] with our attitudes we depart many times
[38:30] from that word
[38:32] with our attitude
[38:34] our thoughts
[39:10] it comes from two Greek words
[39:13] that means to withstand and trial
[39:27] God calls him blessed
[39:30] but
[39:32] in a point of view the viewers the God's
[39:36] point of view
[39:37] Persona when a person comes
[39:43] they're called
[39:46] Dios
[39:50] according to what God has is he's not
[39:52] blessed
[39:55] because he can't withstand the test
[39:58] foreign
[40:06] in the only way
[40:09] that they can go back is
[40:12] accepting God's advice
[40:15] I mean God directs himself
[40:22] just come to me and buy compra bye you
[40:27] said Abraham says
[40:31] the church is not talking with God
[40:37] it's not dealing with God trying to get
[40:40] the spiritual fruits of God
[40:44] says God's
[40:46] views
[40:49] it's a character in The likeness of
[40:51] Christ
[40:54] which is produced in the burning oven of
[40:57] Affliction
[41:01] when everything is done
[41:04] we will take our character
[41:08] so in this age
[41:13] the antidote to be able to escape
[41:27] that the H is displayed
[41:30] to understand that us as children of God
[41:34] we have to be responsible
[41:38] it's the age of responsibility
[41:42] why the age of responsibility
[41:47] because in Revelation yes
[41:51] from 7 to 11.
[41:53] when he speaks to us
[42:06] he received the order
[42:10] and take the book
[42:17] we have access to the Bible
[42:20] take the book
[42:22] we have it in our hands
[42:33] in our minds from this word
[42:38] access to it than any other time
[42:42] the book that's printed the most is the
[42:44] word of God
[42:46] people and this time
[42:50] to be able to this
[42:54] to be able to say that I am responsible
[42:56] in this age
[42:59] we have to understand that God calls us
[43:02] to action
[43:05] you might ask how brother
[43:09] Matthew 16.
[43:13] when you ask who do you say I am Jesus
[43:19] Jesus asked the disciples who do you say
[43:21] is the son of man
[43:23] and they all gave their response
[43:27] each one had their own interpretation
[43:31] but only one had the revelations
[43:36] that's why it's a battle between
[43:37] Revelation and perception
[43:40] another questions for each one of you
[43:43] and who do you say I am
[43:49] in those vamos and we go
[43:54] say when the Lord says I know
[43:58] there he is walking in the midst of this
[44:03] he is the chief Shepherd of it
[44:08] but don't hold back the persecution
[44:11] the system the tribulation
[44:17] he simply says I know your tribulations
[44:33] like Israel they wonder if God really
[44:35] loves them
[44:41] how can God be just and loving if he
[44:44] stands by and watches his people suffer
[44:47] perfection
[46:37] it's
[46:42] not that he's punishing you
[46:46] foreign
[47:38] what's the mouth of God
[47:41] to propheta his prophet
[47:45] is
[48:00] that's why you go through trials and
[48:02] tests
[48:04] in
[48:05] plain language
[48:39] come to a place of perfection
[48:47] why did you want this why
[48:49] no ceremony I don't know that that's
[48:52] what the prophet says
[49:00] all three are one
[49:04] you can't humanly understand United
[49:21] because that's where we put our faith to
[49:23] test
[49:29] I'd like to give you other news but
[49:31] that's just the way it is that's
[49:33] what the prophet said
[49:41] when The Shepherd of the flock Prophet
[49:44] says
[49:48] if we interpret it as humans
[49:52] it's going to push us towards the age
[50:20] when you have a son
[50:22] says
[50:27] my daughter's so responsible
[50:31] what is it that makes you say those
[50:33] words
[50:35] that your son or daughter make
[50:38] Services
[50:47] when you express yourself in that way of
[50:49] your children
[50:50] you rest it's cancer you rest because
[50:56] you know that they're going to make the
[50:58] right decisions because they're
[51:00] responsible
[51:03] and that's what God is looking for
[51:04] foreign
[51:45] and if he asked a question
[51:49] you can say whatever you want foreign
[52:18] and
[52:20] follow me
[52:28] Luke 9 23 says
[52:32] any come after me
[52:36] deny himself foreign
[53:20] follow me
[53:24] not Revelation 10 7.
[53:27] here it's the same
[53:31] God giving instructions
[53:34] he's saying take up your cross
[53:37] in Revelation he says take the book
[53:41] saying take the cross
[53:47] take your cross
[53:49] not yourself
[53:53] follow me
[53:55] take the book consume it
[53:58] is
[54:00] instructions
[54:02] he did not leave us without insurance
[54:05] but the instructions he gives us
[54:13] we have to be in action
[54:16] s
[54:21] follow me why
[54:24] [Applause]
[54:51] [Applause]
[55:18] come to me if you're sick and I will
[55:20] give you healing
[55:23] foreign
[56:18] [Applause]
[56:27] and not stay without acting we have to
[56:29] act foreign
[56:47] that's good it's hell
[56:49] yeah
[57:01] don't stop
[57:09] because for this time
[57:12] we need to understand
[57:15] it is our response
[57:18] our responsibility is
[57:21] our responsibility
[57:23] because if we don't take responses
[57:35] God loves me God loves me yeah
[58:10] from the world
[58:13] now
[58:21] says
[58:24] love chosen in love before the
[58:27] foundation of the world
[58:28] now watch
[58:31] having predestined us
[58:34] now there's the word for destinations
[58:42] on to the adoption of children by Jesus
[58:45] Christ
[58:47] according to the good pleasure of his
[58:49] will what about it
[58:52] isn't that wonderful
[58:54] he loved you
[58:58] she loved you before there was a world
[59:04] you know your weakness
[59:09] Know It All About You
[59:13] can't surprise
[59:25] it's not based on what you do or what
[59:27] you want
[59:29] based on circumstances
[59:44] [Applause]
[59:50] [Applause]
[1:00:04] his foreign
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:49] chose to restore you
[1:00:53] you could have you couldn't have done
[1:00:55] anything
[1:00:56] you say brother
[1:01:00] then let me go enjoy life
[1:01:03] foreign
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:21] [Applause]
[1:01:51] you were already Eternal with God
[1:01:59] that's that's a great amount
[1:02:02] that's a great America
[1:02:06] through Revelation
[1:02:08] that it's not what I do no look
[1:02:12] what you do but I'm just referring to
[1:02:14] bathroom
[1:02:15] I'm referring to good things as well as
[1:02:18] well
[1:02:22] sometimes we work thinking will earn the
[1:02:25] favor of God
[1:02:27] no brother you do it
[1:02:31] the more work you do the more pleased
[1:02:36] but God's love was in elections
[1:02:44] he said I choose you I love you I love
[1:02:48] you
[1:03:02] the sacrifice provides the Sovereign
[1:03:04] Grace
[1:03:57] for us
[1:04:02] yes brother
[1:04:04] now what is it that I have to do is
[1:04:11] take the word
[1:04:28] as if it was already done
[1:04:30] when God speaks it
[1:05:31] then we can
[1:06:08] that will happen
[1:06:11] see him yes brother yes yes that's the
[1:06:14] way it is
[1:06:18] we're going through difficult situations
[1:06:34] we have to be responsible
[1:06:37] take our cross
[1:06:40] humble ourselves
[1:06:44] follow him in the path he's laid for us
[1:06:52] move forward
[1:06:54] Prophet says
[1:07:01] preached in 1961.
[1:07:06] God has no weak Parts nor strong parts
[1:07:12] no wait let me go back
[1:07:18] the word says
[1:07:22] that he is strong
[1:07:25] but
[1:07:26] when you see God
[1:07:30] you can't say this part is weak we need
[1:07:33] to improve on this
[1:07:34] oh this is the strong part of God
[1:07:38] because God doesn't have any weak Parts
[1:07:42] simply God
[1:08:28] then you have God
[1:08:33] you have the power to create a new
[1:08:35] system
[1:08:37] to grab onto this word and the prophet
