TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you about two weeks ago there was a father Christian father asked for his teenage daughter that was not yet a Christian while he was standing in the prayer line the holy spirit said I give you your child here she is this morning saved and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus sitting on the platform just as the holy spirit [Music] said the other children are all sitting around the Dalton family is Happy see the little lady there that they had prayer for the baby last Sunday thought was going to die see still with us this morning and we're so happy for that sister they thought it had muscular distrophy and it didn't have so we're very thankful see all of our good friends I remember this man here coming to me on a special interview at one time I I had breakfast you and your wife and children I believe are you and your wife or children yes too Middletown oh we are I forget that name so I just call Ito yes sir Middletown many of my good friends brother Charlie Cox and sister Nelly over here who's been a second home to me that's you could be my own children Co I go down there it's where I spend most of my time of relaxing down there he's the best squirrel Kentucky when I'm in Indiana and Charlie just long oh like C really feel like I could stand at Lots brother um harnell harn from car brother well there so many different ones here from different places that come in this morning to visit with us you know we don't have any regular membership here we just have Fellowship one with the other the blood of Jesus Christ God's son cleanses us from all unrighteousness now we are having a wonderful study just glor and we are at least I'm know I'm enjoying it and I know all you're enjoying it too amen I get started sometimes through the day to speak about it or read about it I get about two verses and I get started through the scriptures and the first thing you know I've done been from Genesis R going and you know I'd like to take a time where we could where we could get on the book of of Hebrews and take just like well when squirrel season comes in by SE AUST you know and go on through until time to go overseas just each night on the book of Hebrews or the book of Exodus how God Exodus bringing out his people out of Egypt anus very beautiful type of us now getting ready for our Exodus it's oh it's such a beautiful thing the whole scripture just ties together it's one big story now this morning we're we're still in the book of we is going to take the first three chapters of of the book of Ephesians Paul's letter to the Ephesians Ephesus trying positionally placing the church and just before we approach it could we just spare another moment or two for prayer just before we do oh Lord Our God we are coming into thy presence now as unworthy as we are yet we know that there is a blood sacrifice there waiting cleansing us from all uncleanness and presenting us before the father blameless faultless not nothing that we could ever do to Merit this but because that Jesus has done this for us we bow humbly to his presence and his name asking that you'll send the holy spirit this morning in our midst and is not being a theologian or knowing how to set scripture in order but just enthused and grateful to the feeling of the Holy Spirit as it moves through my may it bless all of us together as we read thy written word that it might become to us life eternal granted father we ask it in Jesus name and for Jesus sake amen now I might say in here first that if anytime that I might say something that would be disagreeable not setting just right may be absolutely wrong to your teaching or something that you could not agree with I'm trusting the holy spirit that he'll make it so seasoned and so sweet until there'll no be no offense at all it'll be through love and fellowship that that's what it's it's meant that way and this all begin with the sermon last Sunday I believe it was last Sunday morning as the rejected came have anybody got the tape yet yet I think they've got him and you can have him if you wish them the rejected King now just a few days and we'll be beginning at up at the Middletown Ohio in Middletown oh we want all that has their their vacation Station for that time to be sure to meet with us there because we're expecting a great time of fellowship at Middletown OH Dr is the chairman I think of the committee and there'll be five nights of it I'll be preaching as the the the guest speaker at the International Convention of the inter denominational church and then then after that will be our own meeting from then on we have got it staged till the 12th but under the understanding that we may go on through even another week after that just depends on how the Holy Spirit leads we all want to be led by the spirit just what the spirit says do then do it quickly and let's remember while we're obeying the spirit one great lesson that we want to learn is never be hastely amen take your time have faith if we have asked got anything remember God answers prayer he does it in his time the way it's best makes it work just right for us and if that isn't so then what are we doing here this morning what are we climing Christianity for God this isn't the word of God then it isn't true then we are found among people most miserable I'm so glad to join hearts with many here that know that this is the infallible word of God it's that it is every word the truth every word of it every phase of it and with the grace of God have been privileged to view the land amen of which someday we shall travel yesterday people don't know what depressing times comes with this type of ministry I got real depressed and I said to the wife I wish I could just go on she said why you say that bill I said oh here I have troubles and then seemed like the holy spirit said are you trying to bypass him are you are you trying to dodge them no I said just let me stand right up in the face of all of it and face it out see just it's so much [Music] better honestly truly I say this by IE witness that just after this life is over we enter a land that's beyond anything that anyone can amen and if there be any strangers here I trust that you do not I pray to God that you do not consider me a fanatic I I want if anything is to be honest then to tell the truth then what good would have do me to tell something that was wrong when there's so there's so much as here is true why we have to tell anything wrong about it see it's it's just TR then no wonder I believe Paul was caught up into the third heaven and he saw things that it wasn't expedient for him to speak of and one day he said I has not seen ears not heard or has it either entered the heart of man what God has for them in store that love him you oh we're just [Music] living we're living in a dump pile down here that's all just a rubbish sheat full of of smoldering smoke from filth even if we are not contaminated with it ourselves we are living in it where the smoke is coming from smoking emeralds of sin one of the most sickening things I can think of is an old city dump of burning was you ever near one that horrible contaminated smell of smoke coming up through all kinds of Filth you get a breath of it and just turns you around I remember having go down to new Alby down on the below 18th Street there where the old dump used to be I'd have to cleck down in there and read meters and I just dreaded to day when I was Route 18 when I had to take that down in there because it was to smell that horrible smell laying out on there was bodies of rats and dogs and everything you know that was smoldering and that old smoke coming up to it now yet that is what this life is compared to that's best just a sming sin just smells from everywhere as it was spiritually speaking yes amen where the wind is blowing free and everything is love Lely and peace and joy and eternal life just across the river but we're in a battle so let's not just lay down and say let's hurry up and get over there let's bring everyone with us that we can bring that's and now the purpose of these lessons is to Anchor those that have already come across the land see the purpose of this studying this book of Ephesians is to positionally place the church where it absolutely abolutely stands in Christ it is a type of the Old Testament and the Book of Joshua suay we had where Joshua led the lands to each man and he had done it by inspiration how Moses was brought the people out of Egypt the garlic Le out and gave them a place to where God had promised 400 years later 400 years before that he would bring them into a place of goodly land flown with milk and honey and Moses led the children of Israel right up to the land but did not take them over Jesus do the spiritual do the people that we were been promised the Holy Spirit since the beginning led us up to the [Music] promise but a Holy Spirit came at Joshua to take over and lead and direct and to possess the land man or possess the church amen we find out basically then that in our now here's where maybe people might think that I am rude and trying to I am not God be my judge I am not I'm only trying to point out something that is a truth see we have chosen leaders of man instead of leading leaders leadings of the Holy Spirit we have wanted man to lot out our part and lead us denominations like Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Church of Christ Pentecostal and different denominations to set an organization as an example we follow that but we are nowhere in the Bible are we to do such as that there isn't one Texas scripture in all of God's Bible where he ever organize the church or were he ever spoke of an organization not one place in the Bible but always contrary to it he doesn't want us to be fashion like the things of the world wants us pecular set aside I don't mean now to be silly as we call it I mean to be a called out people amen oh blessed holy nation Hallelujah living lives that's above reproach oh acting behaving ourselves just like he would working in us for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works now Wednesday night many of you was here Wednesday night but we got into the I believe it's the third verse oh it's the fifth verse onto the adoption or placing of the people how they God trying to place his people and when God places one then all the whole church wants to be like that one have the same kind of things do the same things we are cut out different we're made different we are nature different and we are positionally placed different each one different work maybe one for just a little kind of a work another for a large work believe it was David or one of the prophets I forget [Music] now said I would rather be a doormat at the house of the Lord yes amen than to be to dwell in the tents with the the wicked now we're going to stop just a second on the adoption the fifth verse trying to get down as far as we possibly can on it but I remember the theme it is all together on placing how many understand that let's sure you say it with one word word placing the body of Jesus Christ in Christ INR where the Holy Spirit the holy is leading us there you are now we got it SE positionally placing us the book of EP is to do that and watch this master teacher Paul the first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away yes amen knock out all the idea of ever being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God's condem me the next day I'm back again and that's nonsense now this is this book is not address to Evangelistic teaching evangelist sermon we don't I don't touch this on the [Music] fields I bring this to the church for Paul addressed it to the Saints those that are called and preserved and are filled and are are set aside and are in the Holy Spirit already in canaan's land he's trying to tell them the first saying get it out of your mind amen that you're going to get lost and you're going to do this and you're scared of this don't be scared of nothing he's trying to tell you where you're at who you are how you're [Music] standing [Music] h [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] h you oh

closer to your throne of Mercy asking of your help Father because this useless being without your presence we're out of your ways we are nothing Lord we need you father any mistake any error fallacy

father father help us we play ourselves in your hands and as your word comes forth your bride may receive what he is looking for and at the end of this service all the honor and Glory all the worship may be for you Lord put ourselves together in your hands in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen taking advantage that we're standing we'll be going into the scripture it's which is a base scripture which we've been using we'll be Genesis 1 1-5 and then we'll be reading 11 and 12 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the [Music] Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day then we'll be going to 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind who seed this in itself upon the Earth and it was so [Music] and Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good you may take your seats Brothers we know we're speaking on the topic of the spoken word is the Original Seed and I'd like to add a subtitle it's cleansing our hearts I'll be speaking a little bit on the heart I'll be going to another scripture just as we are seated we're going to Jeremiah 17 we'll be reading 9 and 10 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately Wicked who can know it I the Lord search the heart I try the Reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings I'll be speaking about a lot of a little bit of aspects of the physical heart but first I'd like to introduce another quote to place another Foundation message preach the Church of the Living God preached 19517 27 now the seed you people here who are farmers every seed will produce in its right kind of a [Music] ground and every Divine promise of God and the Bible will produce if it's met in the right kind of a heart we'll be reading the highlighted part just to move forward it's up to Nature to God to water it and to see that it produces is that true it's God to water it to see that it produces is that true so that's the way you do with the word of God accept it in a good heart first I'd have to ask a question here where does the messenger tell us that the land is in our body here the messenger showing us he's saying that the Earth in our heart sorry the Earth in our body is our heart in the natural if we leave a clean terrain for two or three months and it we come back automatically again it produces something but it's not going to produce good seed because we have not planted good seed it automatically is wicked amen if you plant nothing then you expect nothing automatically there's pasture that you're not expecting likewise in our home where we live we have to always be doing maintenance perhaps those who know about Landscaping maybe they go to a house once a week or twice but if they don't go automatically something begins to come forth or grow amen brothers that's the natural part and so I started to investigate a little bit but the messenger says when you plant the seed in our heart how do we water it he says that it's planted in the heart but that's God's part it's the seed now but what's our part is to listen to messages to read the Bible to come to church that's our part when the seed is in our hearts seed is the same as it int uh the definition is the same as a something you plant so I did a little bit of research in what what allows our heart to function according to doctors and scientists there there uh it's a process of electricity that produces attractions in your body the body has a Electric System called a heart condition system and it's a it's a something that controls the frequency of your heartbeats now I explored where that system that heart system it comes from the deepest part of the heart there's some something called the sinus node it's a muscle that generates [Music] that and there it's good but after that I couldn't find any more on this topic because I started to investigate and investigate more I went back to seeing that it's muscle threads after that muscle I couldn't find anything else which is threading or fib it's according to somebody who has given life that's how it gets damaged but we truly know that it's God who's giving us that life heart is used in the different types specifically more in this month which is of Valentine's Day sometimes the couples gave each other chocolate hearts maybe when we were young and we were in school we'd get we place on a tree or on our desk they weren't even our girlfriend but it was who we liked or the other way around whoever the ladies like and they would draw a heart and an arrow going through it it said Cupid but to this day I don't know what the arrow means if going upwards or downwards and there's another city that's identified with the heart which is the city of New York which has as as a sign of a heart when we seeing the national anthem we see a symbol the flag as a symbolic sign we place our hand over our heart we also when we get scared we also grasp onto our chest amen amen just a short testimony something happened to me a couple weeks ago well about a week ago I didn't know that it fell my law to preach but I was I was out with my wife we went out to eat and I got a a chest pain but I had never gotten that type of pain and truly I got scared because my father passed away due to heart problems and I heard of a young man who was a soccer player after playing a soccer game he lied down on his couch he rested on the couch now he was 19 year old and that's where he laid and so all these thoughts came to my mind at that moment I I thought about it tell my wife I did complain that my my chest was hurting I said Lord if it's my time to go and then me make things right but truly I don't want to die that's the TRU how many have gotten scared because your your chest hurts yes it's true you want to see what size your heart is perhaps some know and some don't know the size that you are if you make a fist that's the site that's the size of your heart for example if I weigh 230 pounds if you weigh 150 P 10% of that weight is your blood blood so if I weigh 230 PB then I have 23 lbs worth of blood and the size of my heart it bumps all throughout all my heart with within four to five minutes amen so approximately in 24 hours it's 100 110,000 bumps I don't want to go in deeper into that but it's an idea that we can know how our heart functions just a small apparatus which maintains our heart our body functioning I'm going to go to scripture we're going to go to Matthew 158 to19 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness and blasphemies amen amen all this comes forth from the heart and unfortunately that we're all sick with a sickness called sin the the Bible tells us that the heart soul and spirit will live [Music] forever I didn't understand this until I started to study how is it that our heart is going to live on forever it's simple if you were made in God's image uh then we're going to have a heart I go to Matthew 58 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God amen amen the scripture Proverbs 4:23 keep th heart with all diligence for out of it there are the issues of Life the heart is a containment of Faith but it's also the basis for doubt when God sees man he does not see the color of his skin he doesn't look at his position or the type of clothes that he wears God sees his heart sometimes the doctor perhaps now oh perhaps they're now white tomorrow they're brown another day they're Hispanic or whatever color you want to place upon but they don't make any difference on a heart because it's the same heart amen amen go to another scripture Amos 4:12 [Music] is therefore thus will I do unto thee oh Israel and because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God o Israel but how are we going to go with the meeting with our God if our heart is not well because if there's something unclean there then I can't go to that meeting I can't enter up there how much have I given to that seed that is in my heart do I listen to tapes messages do I read the Bible amen [Music] amen if I take a te a stethoscope and I place it on my brother I believe that I also have to place it on myself because truly nobody else knows besides God how your heart is but it's one and the same I hope that I haven't offended anyone I haven't spoken wrong of [Music] anybody have I been clear have I been transparent how have I been with my family um it is in oh when you say oh I love everybody I love everybody all of my brothers I have no enemies now there's a person that I don't really like very much it's my my mother-in-law my father-in-law amen amen if God caus us to love our enemies why don't we love our in-laws who are part of our family oh brother well you don't know how they are I don't but God does I haven't heard it in this church I've heard it somewhere else don't go thinking that it's [Music] here our duty is to say and love all without an exception the rest of the questionnaire you can do to God our our heart has to be clean as the word says or else we cannot see God we go to Matthew 158 this people draweth night unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me how many times do we come to church we sing we hear the preachings we go back home we just throw our Bible somewhere and next Sunday we can't find where we left it I believe that there it's written and it is for us because throughout the week we don't listen to anything when that happens brother we're fulfilling this scripture brother Garcia says says let the surgeon come and remove that Heart of Stone I want to jump to Ezekiel 36:26 and new heart also will I give you and new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk walk in my statuses and ye shall keep my judgments and do them now you might say brother I had an experience with Jesus the question is if we already had an experience with Jesus a personal encounter with God do you think that there could still be wickedness in our Earth or our land it's just a question do you think this enemy can still come and plant tears in our land or in our heart answer is simple is yes sir because all those things are what give maintenance to our heart or brother Milton my heart is clean but it is injured it's damaged well welcome as well we go to Psalms 145 1453 he heals the Brokenhearted and he mend the injuries he mens our injuries he gives us Comfort when we have a legal problem and the lawyer says that I can't do it no more we're going to wait what to see what happens and then something happens that's unexplainable when there's nothing else for the lawyers to do that's when God comes into the scene when the doctor says that there's no more hope for you go home and die I believe sometimes the doctors are a bit Savage they tell you well we we don't know what to do with you we're already spending too much time with you in the hospital just go home that's when Jesus comes into the scene because he goes into cases where the human can no longer go more he's an expert in that am amen brothers let's keep moving forward they asked Bill Gates he's currently a millionaire if he knew somebody who was even richer than he was he responded with yes and he spoke that when he was not a millionaire he used to go to the airport in New York about in 2012 2013 and he didn't have any cash to buy newspaper and he already had the newspaper in his hand and he tells the man he told him I don't have the cash he says well just keep it it doesn't matter and then he went by once again he once again forgot to carry cash well it happened about two or three times so when they asked him if he knew somebody who was richer than him he said yes that it was that man who gifted him those newspapers because he tried to go looking for him once he was already a milliona he found him and he asked him if he wanted anything says that he would get him whatever he wanted there was already an elder person he said well I I don't want anything he says I give it to you at that moment because you needed it so he says that the Elder didn't take anything from him that's why he says he was a millionaire in rich in heart if Bill Gates was able to say that to that person who was rich in heart great heart and they he expressed himself about that what about us with our Lord Jesus Christ there's no way to explain it how rich he is in Mercy it's true Brothers our brother Garcia says that there is no Minister there is no Minister that could support or withstand the people of God that could withstand them as God can withstand us and then you say well brother why are you saying that sometimes we confuse ourselves as a head of a family perhaps as a leader at work now imagine God dealing with all the bride around the world there's no words to explain that he says now that is a great heart and a merciful one that is so merciful that if it weren't for his Mercy we wouldn't be here when the mind of God told Moses he says move I'm going to destroy everyone the heart of Christ said he say you have to go through me first but not through not with [Music] them when the mind of God said if this if it's possible for this CU to pass me over but the heart of Christ said let it not be mine but your will amen as the musicians come forth I have here a prayer from the messenger that I would like to read said Heavenly Father you see their hands I was watching watching something being done he says you know all about it father I pray now that your spirit will be sweetly upon them let them know that this is what I have said that they can say that from this time on their attitudes have been changed the hardness that was in their hearts has melted [Music] away sweet peace and divine love has taken its place granted father each one of them receive the baptism of the love of God in their heart that they could turn the other cheek go to the Second Mile like he did with spit on his face and thorns on his brow with heavens and earth in
