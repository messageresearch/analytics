[Music] let's see it is [Music] we're gonna be reading the script it'd be a Hebrews 9 11 which is the scripture we've been using as a foundation and it reads like this is [Music] but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by greater and more Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building needed by the blood of goats and caps by his own blood he entering wounds into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption de los toros [Music] [Music] sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh cuanto masla Sangre de Cristo El comedian Spirits how much more shall the blood of Christ with the eternal spirit offer himself without sponsor God Purge your conscience from their Works to serve the Living God is [Music] thank you for your words asking and bring your word to us the context Revelations [Music] may speak to us all together we put ourselves and we give you thanks for this privilege amen amen may take your seats topic are Planet Redemption Redemption as we've been speaking on on Sunday mornings some of us understand that God has a plan I believe that's something very precious that if we can understand we can obtain many things knowing that God takes care of you God will provide for you but it's important to know and it's a plan that in that plan how it is message God Christ being the mystery of God revealed one of the purposes of God is that he wants to reveal himself when he wants to reveal his people he wants him he wants to be known for him to be known then he will show you how he wants things that please there are things that please can you please have patience with me Perhaps it is blessings for your children it's for your family that is what God gives to us one of the most essential things what God requires of us if you don't know what God is uh there was the other one on the you know what's going on around we're reading a couple of scriptures you can please follow me to the Book of Jeremiah in chapter 32. I'll be asking you to please write down the description you need to look for them if we have them on the screen so all together we can go at the same pace we're in the hands of God Jeremiah 32 verse this is that they may fear me forever if you have fear of God El cuarenta in 40. this is eterno and I will make an Everlasting Covenant that I will not turn away from them good but I will put my fear in their hearts apart from it now the scripture has a lot this is how God works that he does in his grace because ourselves we have a heart we have our own because the fear of God is a way of life right now I'd like to read another scripture yes a Deuteronomy 10. there we have it on the screen I know I want us to understand what God is asking from us we have to have that presence in our lives let's not forget this there's Commandments and there's requirements Deuteronomy 10 12. and now Israel what took the Lord thy God require of Thee there it says Israel it's a type but I want you to place your name I want you to take it personally we have to make this very clear in our lives but to fear the lord thy God to walk in all his ways and to love him to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy Souls it's happiness uh God wants us to be glad and he makes it very clear [Music] 13 says to keep the Commandments of the Lord and his statue which I commanded for thy good hold the Heaven and the heavens in the heaven of the heavens like Earth I don't know anymore but here's the creator of all things of the heavens of the heavens that is that itself is enough for me to have respective reverence for my God I can't even look to God it is in the Bible shows that no one can look to God because they died great in the Holiness of God here's a Commandment that the Bible shows us if it is a commandment s people forced everyone I want you to know that God doesn't Force anyone doesn't Force anyone we always have free moral age we're free moral agents he always gives us the freedom to choose and we want to feel we want to fill his Commandments the requirements for us oh no or not I know a lot of people who the claim to know about God they say I also know God I'm good I don't need all that what you do when you go to church and all that yo you were responding I know my God and he responds to me and they say God hearing God so the one just scratches their head and says where is the fear of God where is the respect where do you place it where do you leave it first you make him you make him that he's only there when you remember about him so then you see the faith they have yeah and they believe that they believe it but we know better now there's a responsibility when we know more the more we know the more God demands from us and one says well that's what God but by the grace of God we know just a bit more so then we have to be like what God asks of us what does God offer us he offers us eternal life God doesn't Force anyone the person might say one reality why would I want to do such things why serve God like you do and the answer is simple you may not die so you don't die because all of this goes towards death but when God gives us his word he gives us life that's why we have to follow him but not because we're obligated we can't just be satisfied with what's around us amen amen so let's look at different aspects of what is the fear of God Proverbs 9 verse 10. this is the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding once you know who the Holy One is I think you're an intelligent person you're intelligent when you know that when you have fear of God you become wise there's a beginning there which is wisdom that's the first thing to understand what wisdom is the Bible says show the righteous I didn't bring a definition from the dictionary but what I can tell you wisdom is knowing what to do and when that is wisdom wisdom is knowing what to do when and where you can study a lot of science books but that's not going to give you wisdom you will know a lot regarding that material but you won't receive wisdom wisdom comes from God what to do and want to do it what's it believe what not to believe amen what to speak what not to speak there's wisdom there and this is all based on the fear of God you can't ask for wisdom if you don't have the fear of God I know when it was at night or when we're praying say Lord give me wisdom that he surrounds us with wise people we don't know but it comes to our thoughts they speak with your pastors it's just that simple that is wisdom there's a Ministry that we have here we have leaders it's not complicated God also gives it to us directly through experience God works in different ways with different people but he's always there God gives it to him but you have to ask for it with faith is our faith always has to grasp on to something without faith it is impossible to please God if you have faith you place that Faith with the fear of God then you'll receive wisdom because God will be in you and in your decisions you won't be able to see anything you won't do anything without first getting closer to God and asking of his guidance amen is but it happens that we don't all have per se the same desire sometimes we struggle I look at the young ones sometimes they struggle to get to church but when I was young yes he is they don't have they don't have the same pool let's go to church I'm waiting for somebody to go to church because you're at a lower level of that fear but there's also a level that's beyond that there's a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian let's go from one extreme to another yes and it's simple and it's easy to see that there is no fear for God here there's fear of God and here there isn't fear of God mystery tank gives a definition of what it's like when there is no fear of God as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand it there is none that seek it after God they are all gone out the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that do with good no no not one your throw is an open support with their tongues they have used the seats the poison of asps it's under their lips is full of cursing and bitterness now I don't know if you've ever noticed someone like this out on the streets he says their feet are Swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their ways and the way of Peace have they not known [Music] there is no fear of God before their eyes that's what it's like when there is no fear of God that's when you depart and you give your back to God because God is always looking to give us the opportunity but it seems like we turn our backs it seems like you don't want to have to but there's nothing they feels like God is a problem in your life I as we have we want nothing to do with God I believe that all of us at some point maybe today I don't want to go to church as young ones that we were given the invitations it's almost as it becomes a problem if I go to church now I have to do what they tell me the Bible says the laws you know that's that's really difficult and maybe I'll do it later that's because there is no fear of God that's why it's important to show our children to have that fear of God the importance of the fear of God so that it may go well it's something familiar if you instruct that little one you will receive all that blessing then he will disperse it to others as he develops and grows that's what God wants he wants to be that way it is like wisdom wisdom wisdom is for everyone else if you have wisdom it's you may help somebody else so let us continue Proverbs 16 6. the fear of God separates by Mercy and Truth iniquity is and by the fear of the Lord meant apart from Evil yeah in a certain occasions but is it it seems like at times we're just surrounded by evilness and we get contaminated but when there's fear of God they want themselves looks to depart themselves when something tells you to get away from that sometimes that's what we can't overcome as we speak on the topic of how can I overcome and it feels like we fail and fail and fail and we fail but it's because we have departed from the fear of God when the fear of God is inside then you look for the righteousness you look to do the goods you depart from the evil as much as you can I can't go to there because it doesn't mean no good I went apart from me I want nothing to do with it I'll just rather go over here I'm gonna hang out with so-and-so it's better for me to learn something good fellowship with the brothers at church I know that I will learn more I will learn more about the world hang out with the friends from back then I'm going to go back to the same things that's how that's how this goes with the fear of God men depart from evil Proverbs 3 7. he said opinion be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and it shall be healed to thy neighbor and Marrow to thy bones there is one Health you want healing that is because it says that is foreign I mean and I felt like my bones hurt all day my bones were hurting and you start thinking well I never get sick this is happening to me what is this I always make the sicknesses seem like they're smaller not so serious foreign foreign because God always gives us what we need this whatever book if God gives the desire of your heart what would you ask foreign he was talking about what he experienced [Music] so you can ask for them very tremendous a brother Branson they're very rude they were they were they didn't released us they were very early they were there creating a being bad while brother Branham was there how you write her voice he says I asked for the Salvation of my children I asked for their salvation there were those two boys right and they were there with their sister Heidi rice they felt surrendered because the sister has spoken from her heart because you received the desire for her for having said the correct things when you have that fear of God you will speak the correct things God will recognize that and God will give you the desire of your heart sometimes we ask ourselves why don't these come out what I make put in the effort and teachers don't come out right I remember many years ago before giving myself to the Lord I would say about 15 years ago I worked a lot and I remember a lot about this my uh my ex-brother-in-law told me you should tell me say S I tell you that you're someone who's very uh in the center you're very in the middle centered well centered um he says you make good decisions you work hard take care of your family you almost don't go out yeah but things just don't go right and things don't go right for you you don't have anything and as friends just as friends I think you're cursed I think someone did something bad to you so I remember a lot of my brother Miguel and me and my Consciousness taking those words that he said I said no we know what's going on we already know what's going on we have departed from the fear of God we have Departed we're just to see what's going to happen we'll never reach the spot where we have to reach yes that is the way it is a very big difference when you place God first we return to God's path now all your decisions are based on that is and you begin to see how God moves there's a great need God provides gives you the protection more scriptures but my time is over God gives you rest it gives you the confidence and Assurance is quote just to finish God has gone the time has gone by really fast respects occasions if we're not careful we can be a stumbling Stone and that's not that's for not being careful with the fear of God for not taking care of ourselves so we take it lightly I'm talking about I'm talking about the Christians talking about us or our young ones we don't give you the seriousness it deserves and so that can affect somebody who's out there this is in the 13th verse it is written like this let us share the conclusion of the whole matter and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of man there's a conclusion of everything fear God [Music] yes the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom no that's not don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you are giving him his respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way I'm gonna repeat that he said you fear that you might displease him in some way we don't want to displace God we don't want to displease them we want to please him unless you would do something wrong it says you wouldn't want to says I fear my mother says I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way and I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that we're cousin to think that I was Christian that is dangerous to possibly say well this isn't a Christian now we want the whole country heavenly father thank you for your word Lord thank you for your Holy Spirit it's a reminder Lord how to be better how to apply it to our lives and the benefits and blessings all your blessings and promises are based on faith and in the fear of God how we place it in our lives I give you thanks because you were clear in your words but now it's our decision to serve and to fear God thank you Lord for that and thank you which makes us recognize that you have brought us here Lord thank you for being with each one of us Lord we place our pastors our brothers who are out of town each one of them may you help them take care of them on the way and they come back safely thank you Lord in the name of Lord Jesus
