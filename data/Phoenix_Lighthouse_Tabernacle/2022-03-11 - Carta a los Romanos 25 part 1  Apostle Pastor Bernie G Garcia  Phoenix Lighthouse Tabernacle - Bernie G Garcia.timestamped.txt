[20:29] [Applause]
[20:41] we're going to be studying on the letter
[20:43] to the romans
[20:45] is
[20:47] [Music]
[20:55] we're on the subtitle of the topic of
[20:58] the manifestation of the sons of god
[21:14] how many of you want to be manifested as
[21:16] children of god say amen
[21:25] we have seen how it was a man was placed
[21:28] as lord
[21:40] man lost his place
[21:54] [Music]
[22:25] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[22:27] beast of the field which the lord god
[22:29] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[22:32] hath god said you shall not eat of every
[22:34] tree of the garden
[22:42] we know that this is the conversation
[22:44] that the serpent and the woman had
[22:49] a life for all of us to consider
[23:24] and god blessed them and and god said
[23:26] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[23:28] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[23:30] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[23:32] and over the fowl of the air and over
[23:34] every living thing that moveth upon the
[23:36] earth
[23:44] so
[23:45] with this i can see that god placed them
[23:47] as lords over the earth
[24:19] let's start studying this morning before
[24:21] we're going to consider what we have
[24:22] before us a circle
[24:28] you might be able to frame it
[24:30] i know
[24:42] i see that the serpent deceived eve
[25:02] that was where god's rulership was
[25:09] that was god's headquarters uh
[25:53] but we don't know what it says
[26:05] it says there and have dominion over the
[26:07] fish of the sea and over the fall of the
[26:08] air and over every living thing that
[26:11] moves upon the earth
[26:17] we know that very well that both men as
[26:19] well as women were both
[26:32] and we see that the serpent was a
[26:33] standard dominion or subjection to
[26:36] the
[26:54] we see that the bible tells us that man
[26:56] forfeited everything and he
[26:58] turned it over to satan's hands
[27:02] i can come to the conclusion
[27:42] he could have caused for the woman to
[27:43] die
[27:50] but also the serpent would have been
[27:51] annihilated exterminated
[27:55] remember he was a ruler lord over the
[27:57] serpent
[27:59] whatever adam
[28:41] of course when the man saw exactly what
[28:43] condition his wife was found herself in
[28:47] he chose
[28:50] he was not deceived
[28:54] to redeem his wife
[28:56] because
[29:10] foreign
[29:24] the serpent was never cast out
[29:30] the serpent stayed right in there where
[29:31] god's ruling place was
[29:35] but the man and the woman they were
[29:37] thrown out
[29:38] when
[30:06] hello
[30:34] back into the circle
[30:37] if you understand say amen
[30:47] remember the subject is the
[30:48] manifestation of the sons of god
[30:54] seems like i'm off the subject but i'm
[30:56] still on the subject
[31:00] of
[31:02] vienna
[31:07] i can see that the trail of the serpent
[31:08] comes all the way back from the garden
[31:10] of eden where god's throne was
[31:15] that's the trail of the serpent on the
[31:16] earth
[32:12] in order to follow
[32:26] in the front
[32:29] the first road was where duo
[32:32] was in heaven
[32:37] [Music]
[32:39] in jesus christ
[32:56] [Music]
[33:36] foreign
[34:17] in his sacrifice
[34:32] judas
[34:36] so the first room was in heaven
[34:42] and after that man had been thrown out
[34:44] of god's circle
[35:13] influence
[35:42] throne
[35:45] in the third round
[35:51] we rejoice because of that
[35:53] but remember
[35:56] that's a sphere of influence
[36:50] for all eternity
[37:11] so we can see a little item some small
[37:14] details
[37:25] so we can see
[37:27] clearly what god has done for us
[37:32] the more i see it
[37:48] because
[37:53] god has made us the best that there is
[37:55] on the earth
[38:12] and one of them in particular is the
[38:14] masterpiece
[38:37] [Music]
[38:44] is
[39:06] [Music]
[39:24] one of the things is that masterpiece
[39:26] came through four stages
[39:32] and he faces
[39:33] abraham the patriarch as a father of
[39:35] faith
[39:37] there is a first foundation
[39:42] then next he places the patriarch isaac
[39:51] then the third foundation he places
[40:01] a man truly did very many evil things
[40:06] but it was god's grace covering jacob
[40:35] 37 verse 3.
[40:43] jacob's name was changed to what
[40:48] no
[40:48] i couldn't hear you
[41:14] now israel loved joseph more than all
[41:17] his children because he was the son of
[41:19] his old age and he made him a coat of
[41:21] many colors
[41:26] how many sons does jacob or israel have
[41:29] that had twelve
[41:44] because when did he have him
[41:46] into
[42:13] these different colors they all contain
[42:15] the colors of the rainbow
[42:18] it was completely cloud covered
[42:23] with this close of many colors
[42:42] mind
[42:44] just imagine your mind
[42:47] many colors covering
[42:49] covering joseph
[42:53] then keeping that in mind
[42:56] open up your bibles to the book of
[42:58] judges
[43:06] 30 of chapter 5 of judges
[43:45] verse 30
[43:47] of chapter 5 of judges
[43:49] have they not sped
[43:51] have they not divided the prey to every
[43:54] man a damsel or two
[43:56] to sisera the
[43:58] prey of diverse colors a prayer diverse
[44:00] colors of needlework of diverse colors
[44:03] of needlework on both sides
[44:05] mean for the necks of them that take the
[44:07] spoil
[44:11] in the bible
[44:20] says the bible says of diverse colors a
[44:22] needlework on both sides meet for the
[44:25] next of them that take a spoil
[44:28] in other words
[44:30] for the head or the leader
[44:34] the
[44:35] clothing of diverse colors
[44:38] is both for the head oh capitan or for
[44:40] the the head man
[44:50] israel will dress joseph with the code
[44:52] of many colors
[44:55] he loved him
[45:02] and he placed him as a head the head man
[45:04] over the rest of his brothers
[45:08] and his brothers
[45:14] because his father has placed him as the
[45:15] head or the head man
[45:28] and people say well how can he represent
[45:30] jesus christ
[46:10] samuel
[46:17] uh
[46:18] samuel is right before kings and
[46:20] chronicles
[46:23] first a second samuel excuse me second
[46:26] samuel chapter 13.
[46:40] completely
[46:46] here speaking about what amnon he
[46:48] dishonors his sister
[46:59] and here
[47:00] it says how that absalon amnon's brother
[47:03] comes and avenges his sister tamar would
[47:05] have been violated by his brother her
[47:07] brother me proposed
[47:13] my purpose this morning is not to speak
[47:15] about them but just to emphasize a
[47:16] little something here
[47:22] second
[47:35] and she had a virgin she excuse me she
[47:37] had a garment of diverse colors upon her
[47:40] for with such robes were the king's
[47:42] daughters that were virgins
[47:48] this code of colors
[47:54] that the daughters the virgin daughters
[47:56] of kings wore
[47:59] adama
[48:03] when they would see a lady walking with
[48:06] a dress of many colors
[48:09] they knew right away one thing
[48:13] first of all that she was a virgin
[48:17] and secondly that her father was a king
[48:23] now she was a virgin daughter of a king
[48:29] and then after that i'm not dishonored
[48:32] verse
[49:00] um
[49:02] and tamar put ashes on her head and rent
[49:04] her garment of diverse colors that was
[49:06] on her and laid her hand on her head and
[49:09] went on crying
[49:13] given a sign that she was had been
[49:15] dishonored
[49:17] she ripped up her guard
[49:20] and she put ashes on her head
[49:22] place her hands on her head
[49:29] and she goes on sorry and crying and
[49:31] lamenting because she had been
[49:32] dishonored
[49:34] she was no longer a virgin
[49:37] she had been dishonored
[49:40] let me tell you i know we are the head
[49:42] that the brother
[49:54] woman of the world
[50:06] just keep your bible open to there to
[50:08] chapter five
[50:23] within and without
[50:37] because there is no one that will open
[50:39] the block
[50:41] and if the book is not open
[50:46] then you can't see what's on the inside
[50:50] what the seven seals have cannot be seen
[51:20] god
[51:24] that there could be resurrection from
[51:25] the dead
[51:28] the redemption of our bodies
[51:30] the resurrection from the dead
[51:33] let's look there's
[51:42] now let's look at revelations chapter
[51:44] 10.

[52:27] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[52:29] from heaven clothed with a cloud and the
[52:32] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[52:33] was as it were the sun and his feet as
[52:36] pillars of fire

[52:55] the bible says
[53:00] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[53:02] from heaven
[53:04] where did the angel come down from
[53:07] from heaven
[53:25] is that right
[53:39] the angel was mighty and he came down
[53:40] from
[54:21] from heaven

[1:00:00] beings

[1:00:08] person is right in the height of his
[1:00:10] life
