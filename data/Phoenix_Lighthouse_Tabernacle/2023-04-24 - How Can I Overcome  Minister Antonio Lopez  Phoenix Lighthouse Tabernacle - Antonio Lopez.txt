it's a pleasure to be here in the house of the Lord okay please open up our Bibles going straight into the word Romanos will be reading from The Book of Romans it's chapter five verse 3. you can indicate with an amen once you have it a bunch of time I'd like to thank our pastor for his trust thank God for this opportunity it's truly a privilege to be in front of his bride in the word reads passencia and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patients Esperanza and patience experience and experience hope is Nosotros corazones and hope make it not ashamed because he loved the love of God is shared abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us women brothers let's read one more scripture in the Book of Revelations chapter 2 verse 7. it is in the reads is unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God Amen Let Us my first Father which is of things for all your blessings father solos you have never forsaken us you're always by our side is they forgive any mistake that we may have committed father a new mistake or error that we have not confessed we can face it at this moment we may apply your word in our life father anoint my lips the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we take your seats Brothers for watching us online thank you for tuning in we're going to continue with the theme how can I overcome a topic that I feel has no ends you can always be blessed by what it says because we always need help we're always being tried to be tried until the last day we're on this Earth amen brothers because that's what we're here to see who are the true children of God amen amen within us not get in his way amen is I was telling a bit on this topic I heard a little bit of a message from Brother Branham how can I overcome okay Colin Jeffersonville preaching Jeffersonville a foreign is against you than to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is already overcome him There's real overcoming [Music] important I was saying that why it's so important that part of recognizing the tricks of the devil because we know how in any fight or any battle Los contricantes the two both sides they study one another [Music] the devil probably knows us better than we know ourselves [Music] is going to use your family you can use your co-worker or your friend at work you can use whatever thing so you may fall I'm in Brothers when we are prepared it's just like any other exam or test once we see the test we recognize it yes you're already sure of what you have to do is they were not sure amen Brothers so it's very important Siempre siemprestanto to always be ready you will always be alert because when we least expect it that's when the devil attacks amen amen and we continue reading here usted when you recognize you look back and say and I'm doing that [Music] Jesus to them which are in Christ Jesus not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome Diablo and you know that he's a devil usted Grandes [Music] okay greater I see that is in you then he that is in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit has already overcome this thing is and you can overcome by him [Music] [Music] if it doesn't matter anymore Lord Jesus Christ why would it matter to you just worry about what is what matters to the Lord Jesus Christ no longer listen to that voice in your mind don't start listening when you remember those mistakes you've made in the past that's what's important you have to keep moving forward and continue it's more from the Lord Jesus Christ that's when we received that Revelation Brothers man amen the people so live can live a clean life limpia clean since holy life not being sinful adulterers and drinkers gamblers they can live above above that is [Music] were the chemicals of his body what was in him first under justification is the water baptism under the new birth of Wesley sanctification sanctification local Olympia which cleanses and thirdly under the baptism of the Holy Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel into service men the word sanctify significa is sanctify means it's a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service aside for service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service amen Hermanos but that's because we all want to do our part I know I know at least myself when I see at work [Music] I see that everybody's moving everybody's doing something and slow them down foreign [Music] at some point we're reading a little bit about the life of brother Branham um where he talks about the stomach problems he was having this is everything he would eat would just come back up I believe it's like an acid reflux the doctor said his stomach was full of ulcers you only drink prune juice and barley water yeah and that was for months he says he couldn't eat anything else it's something very uncomfortable and when he got to the Lord Jesus Christ he asked for his healing the immediately now you apply that in your life any problem you may be going through or feeling maybe you already prayed for it if you're a pretty friend you already received your healing now you have to confess without mattering or taking or worrying about the symptoms not mattering whatever the scientist may say sooner or later when the devil knows he can no longer get you from that angle the symptoms will go away amen amen amen he is in a few minutes I'll be finishing up I always think of the story in the Bible of Lazarus when we feel like there's no longer time Esperanza we feel like there's no more hope we feel like we've made too many mistakes already that we're already in the Brock bottom [Music] let us know okay Siempre t uh we start to think those things is when God begins to warm up that's when he stands up when he sees that we're trying and trying is when you see that the doctors have already given up I am the specialist and then when we see that story Jesus arriving to see Lazarus and my brother would be alive [Music] [Music] he was standing and completely trusting in God then Jesus says just take me where Lazarus is in his grave he said he says Lazarus to get up is becomes to come back to life is already spent time several days dead is he already had worms in his body okay to bring somebody back to life at that stage it's something impossible for science it's something impossible for the human mind that's the problem that sometimes we have you can't use our natural mind but uh uh you talk about the things of God or to have faith because you're always going to collide there was going to fight against each other please stand yes yes um it's something that God is always telling his children that you trust in him they only have a few days left to live uh cancer or they tell you you have cancer is going to have a job next week that they're going to take your home away God is telling you today to trust in him foreign amen Brothers [Music] thank you Lord gracias thank you for visiting us once again thank you for talking to us we love to hear you Lord [Music] you bring us so much peace you're always here to give us your hand [Music] [Music] surrender completely to you open up our heart to you father may come inside this heart is [Music] [Music] all they need to do is ask you foreign Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] worst other entity [Music] this is why [Music] you do [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause]
