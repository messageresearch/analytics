[0:03] that was God's identification of a
[0:05] prophet and they know that he was God's
[0:07] Prophet you couldn't shake them from it
[0:09] at all even when they seen Peter foret
[0:11] tell those things and come to pass they
[0:12] said this let his shadow pass over me
[0:15] amen that's the church that's the ones
[0:18] that believe it yes sir is revealed by
[0:21] why did Paul say because I I got a p lld
[0:25] d so forth they believe me no he said I

[0:30] that had to die now I know him in the
[0:32] power of his resurrection that's what I
[0:34] come to you at with a demonstration of
[0:36] God's power what was it making Jesus
[0:38] Christ the same yesterday today and
[0:39] forever the same works that Jesus did
[0:42] Paul did the same and they seen God the
[0:44] great father that had demonstrated in
[0:46] the burning bush and demonstrated to
[0:47] Paul and here it was being demonstrated
[0:49] and he's the same in every age God's
[0:51] threefold manner yesterday today and
[0:53] forever what Redeemer in his church
[0:56] perence in the coming Kingdom
[1:00] man you see it just as perfect as it can

[1:07] revealer of the divine revelation of
[1:10] Christ

[1:15] no scholar can do it no man how well
[1:18] educated how Godly or anything else is

[1:27] Christians Born Again raise up your
[1:29] hands fill the Holy Ghost all right here
[1:31] we go then all right notice and he will
[1:35] only do it to the
[1:37] predestinated
[1:40] Hallelujah all the father has given me
[1:43] will come and no man can come except the
[1:45] father he's giving him to me for
[1:48] a look at that priest said this man's be
[1:50] El he's a fortune teller he's a devil
[1:53] that little old woman walking around
[1:54] there living with six husbands she
[1:56] living with five and had the six one
[1:58] then and Jesus said go get your husband
[2:00] come here she said I have no husband
[2:01] said yes you've got six you've had five
[2:04] and the one you're living with now is
[2:05] not your husband she said sir what that
[2:08] light struck that seed when it struck
[2:10] that priest they said this man is a
[2:12] fortune teller see no life they hybrid
[2:15] you come up as far as a organization but
[2:16] died from their own but This Woman's not
[2:18] a hybrid said sir I perceive I can see
[2:22] her big pretty eye shine up like that
[2:24] tears running on her cheeks say sir I
[2:27] perceive that you're a prophet I'm
[2:29] looking for our Messiah and when that
[2:31] Messiah comes he'll do this very same
[2:33] thing he'll tell us these things he said
[2:35] I'm he oh Lord she left her there he is
[2:38] come see a man who's told me the things
[2:40] what was it that light struck that seed
[2:43] that life was there come forth same
[2:46] thing today but the theologians say I
[2:48] wait just a minute I find out it so and
[2:50] so Pastor Moody said
[2:54] or what's Pastor Moody got to do with
[2:56] this this day Pastor Moody lived in his
[2:59] day when not
[3:01] now certainly Luther lived in his day
[3:04] but not in the day of
[3:05] Wesley Wesley lived in his day not the
[3:08] day of
[3:09] Pentecost Pentecost Liv their day but
[3:11] they're long ways from
[3:12] this we're in the last hour sure there
[3:15] are organizations and Scruples that
[3:17] proves that it's not there the word has
[3:19] never been correctly Vindicated just
[3:21] only in his strength seeds denominations
[3:24] and it make the domination put that old
[3:26] gson weed seeds in with that genuine
[3:28] wheat died right out
[3:30] crop went to Jon right green BRS and
[3:33] nettles Hallelujah see went on back to
[3:36] that it died right out then it broke the
[3:38] field up and started over again PL some
[3:39] real seeds and some of them come up and
[3:41] choked it out but then God said in this
[3:43] last days he'd bring out of people
[3:46] washing his blood and they were
[3:49] predestinated to be there they've got to
[3:51] be there God said so and it would reveal
[3:54] and the Very sign I was Malachi for what
[3:58] he would do restore back again
[4:00] Hallelujah bring back in the last days
[4:02] these great things that he promis bring
[4:04] the Revelation what is what see to do
[4:07] Malachi for was to bring back the faith
[4:10] of the fathers to the children see
[4:13] that's right bring that same thing the
[4:14] same pillar fire and on the scene the
[4:17] same signs the same wonders the same
[4:19] Jesus making him the same preaching him
[4:21] the same vindicating him the same
[4:23] yesterday today and forever I will
[4:25] restore sayeth the Lord all the years
[4:28] that the methodists were in the cat
[4:29] pillar worm and Baptist and the Catholic
[4:31] and all them worms eat that that Faith
[4:33] down to become a denominational stump
[4:35] where there's no seeds left in there but
[4:37] I will restore again sayith the Lord all
[4:40] the years what all the signs and wonders
[4:42] that they forsaken I'll take it right
[4:44] back to that original tree again and I
[4:46] will restore it sayith the Lord that
[4:48] Prophet was a Vindicated Prophet his
[4:51] words has to come to
[4:53] pass amen the Holy Ghost alone is the
[4:56] revealer of the divine revelation of
[4:58] Christ and has been in all ages remember
[5:02] all ages who did the word of the Lord
[5:04] come
[5:04] to Prophet alone that's right is that
[5:08] right and the prophet had to be
[5:10] Vindicated first not because he said he
[5:12] was a prophet because he was born a
[5:14] prophet and proved to be a prophet and
[5:16] everything he said was exactly on the
[5:18] word and come to pass then everything
[5:20] else let go see it was the word of the
[5:23] Lord came only by the Holy Ghost the
[5:25] Bible said the man of old moved by the
[5:27] Holy Ghost wrote the word
[5:30] look John the Baptist would never had
[5:34] known Jesus if it hadn't been for the
[5:36] Holy Ghost pointing him
[5:38] out that
[5:40] right John the Baptist that great
[5:43] prophet that come forth and said this
[5:45] one standing among you right now there
[5:47] an ordinary man standing here somewhere
[5:49] that's the Lamb of
[5:51] God John said that I bore record I bear
[5:54] a record I saw the spirit of God the
[5:57] Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a
[6:00] dove and it went upon me and a voice
[6:02] said this is my beloved Son whom I'm
[6:04] pleas what was it the holy ghost that I
[6:06] point him out that's the only way you
[6:09] know him today only way you'll get the
[6:11] three-fold revelation of God is for the
[6:13] Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever
[6:14] be is you're predestinated to see it if
[6:17] it don't you'll never see it Hallelujah
[6:21] if you're not predestinated to see it
[6:22] you'll never see it cuz that light conf
[6:24] fashion you'll go away and make fun of
[6:25] it and explain it away with some
[6:27] intellectual conception when the very
[6:29] God himself manifesting himself and
[6:31] proving it see but if it ain't up on you
[6:33] to see it you won't see it God never
[6:35] just said I'll choose this one choose
[6:37] that but he knew by his reason he could
[6:39] predestinate because he's infinite and
[6:41] he he knows he's infinite so therefore
[6:44] he knowed everything he know the end he
[6:45] could tell the end from the beginning
[6:46] he's God if he can't do that he's not
[6:49] God yes he's the
[6:52] infinite all right John would have never
[6:55] known him no sir had the Holy Ghost not
[6:57] pourn out see how God God hides his
[7:01] mystery to the high educated and
[7:04] everything look every one of them people
[7:05] say in Simplicity reveals it to whom he
[7:09] has predestinated to see
[7:11] it look at there others standing by
[7:14] never even seen the
[7:16] dove they never heard no
[7:19] voice for it was always sent to that
[7:22] predestinated seed predestinated
[7:24] certainly was
[7:26] predestinated Isaiah 712 years before he
[7:29] was born in the spirit raised up out
[7:32] these human senses and said there's a
[7:34] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[7:35] prepare the way of the Lord and make
[7:37] his isah could see couldn't Malachi see
[7:40] the same thing predestinated last
[7:42] prophet sealing off all the prophets of
[7:44] the Old Testament that man that great
[7:46] prophet stand there at the end of the
[7:49] age he see is predestinated certainly he
[7:53] was Malachi saw him
[7:56] too Jesus said if you can receive it
[7:58] this is he was of i s My Messenger
[8:00] before my face Malachi 3 to prepare the
[8:03] way before me see sure he was
[8:05] predestinated to see that message no
[8:07] wonder he can look at and see that Dove
[8:08] coming down that light that was in the
[8:10] wilderness with Israel coming moving
[8:12] down the God himself saying this is my
[8:15] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[8:17] in God in man becoming
[8:20] one I bear witness John said I'll beheld
[8:23] him the only begotten of the father amen
[8:25] I'm a witness of it amen there you are
[8:30] Hallelujah Simplicity with an old
[8:32] preacher his father his father was a
[8:35] great Theologian you know he come out of
[8:37] a school looked like he'd went back to
[8:38] his father's denomination that would
[8:40] have been the will of God when God
[8:42] touched him at his birth back there and
[8:44] he received the Holy Ghost three months
[8:46] before he's born Hallelujah yes sir when
[8:50] Mary went up there and little John was 6
[8:52] months old in his mother's womb and had
[8:54] never them little muscles had never
[8:55] moved yet and Mary was afraid the little
[8:57] muscles were growing but she couldn't
[8:58] feel no l wife Elizabeth his mother
[9:01] brother and when Mary come up and
[9:02] grabbed her and hugged her put her arms
[9:04] laid hands on
[9:06] her
[9:08] and God has spoke to me and I'm going to
[9:12] have a baby too are you and Joseph
[9:14] maryed no Mary how can this be the Holy
[9:17] Ghost shall overshadow me and now be
[9:20] created in
[9:22] me I shall call his name Jesus he'll be
[9:25] the Son of God and as soon as that word
[9:27] Jesus spoke Little John begin to leap
[9:29] and Shout jump
[9:31] down she said blessed be the Lord God
[9:35] for whence comes the mother of my Lord
[9:38] the mother of my Lord oh when comes the
[9:41] mother of my lord for as soon as your
[9:43] salutation come into my ears my baby
[9:44] leaped in the womb for Joy no wonder he
[9:47] didn't want no
[9:48] Seminary something indoctrinate him or
[9:51] something other he had a important job
[9:54] he was a man of the
[9:55] Wilderness went out into the Wilderness
[9:57] and waited God told him out there now
[10:00] revealed to him oh there's your
[10:02] Revelation again now I'll tell you who
[10:04] he is you're a prophet the words to you
[10:06] you know who you are you got to come
[10:08] that answers a question from last Sunday

[10:14] quiet don't say nothing one out there
[10:17] and when you see this one there'll be a
[10:19] sign coming from heaven like a light a
[10:21] dove will come down that'll be him when
[10:24] you see him that's the reason when Jesus
[10:26] walked out in the water John looked over
[10:27] he seen that Dove coming down he said
[10:29] said Behold the Lamb of God there he is
[10:32] he's the one that will take away the sin
[10:33] of the world Jesus walk right straight
[10:35] out in the water to him them two eyes of
[10:37] John met them two eyes of Jesus they
[10:39] were second cousins by flesh Mary and
[10:42] Elizabeth were first cousin their eyes
[10:43] met one another there was God and His
[10:46] Prophet amen stand there John said I
[10:49] have need to be baptized of thee why
[10:52] Come Thou to me Jesus said suffer it to
[10:54] be so now but remember thus it Beth us
[10:57] to fulfill all righteousness why did
[10:59] John do it because he was the sacrifice
[11:01] John was a prophet he know and the
[11:03] sacrifice has got to be washed before
[11:05] it's
[11:06] presented and he suffered him and he
[11:08] baptized him when he had low the heavens

[47:57] but Lord there are a few churches that
[47:59] call themselves by the
[48:04] bride Lord and we know that you have
[48:07] said where two or three are gathered in
[48:08] my name there you'd be in the midst of
[48:12] them we're so glad Lord to know that
[48:15] you're
[48:16] here and Lord praying that you would get

[48:32] praise because you're the only one that
[48:35] can receive
[48:37] such you are the only one that deserves
[48:39] it
[48:40] all we ask these blessings on the word
[48:43] today in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:46] Christ because there is none
[48:49] greater can we say Amen you may have
[48:52] your
[48:54] seats amen amen I want to just kind of
[48:58] not be in a hurry but but don't I don't
[49:00] want to take too much
[49:04] time how many by a show of
[49:07] hands can
[49:09] witness that we are living in the last
[49:12] days according to
[49:15] prophecy now if you'll keep that hand
[49:18] up how many is glad that they are living
[49:21] in these
[49:23] days I might look all over the building
[49:25] everybody's excited
[49:27] we we have never been this
[49:31] close I think I saw a picture of the
[49:33] Doomsday
[49:39] Clock about a year ago when
[49:42] Palestine uh about a year ago when
[49:44] Palestine first attacked
[49:48] Israel and it was such a big
[49:51] deal that they had moved the clock to 3
[49:54] seconds till midnight
[49:59] and you know how it is when they begin
[50:01] to settle
[50:03] down they move it back and forth and so
[50:07] on but I got a picture the other day
[50:09] somebody sent me an
[50:11] article and in this article they had it
[50:15] moved past
[50:19] midnight are you listening
[50:21] now in other words saying it is way past
[50:24] time for this place to be done
[50:29] when Palestine attacked
[50:32] Israel I had told the home church and
[50:34] and anybody who'
[50:37] listen that it was absolutely thus
[50:40] sayith the
[50:42] Lord it was not going to stop
[50:46] now that it was a battle that is going
[50:49] to continue until the end of time as far
[50:52] as we're
[50:54] concerned are you with me now we know
[50:57] that there's a lot of things that need
[50:58] to take
[51:00] place we know that there are a lot of
[51:02] events that need to
[51:04] happen but I believe brother Brian said
[51:06] at one
[51:07] point he said there is nothing left to
[51:12] happen except the coming of the
[51:15] Lord and he said everything that was
[51:17] left could happen in the next five
[51:21] minutes you begin to wonder if that's
[51:24] possible
[51:26] but how quickly things are now
[51:28] moving With God all things are
[51:32] possible and it can all be over in five
[51:36] minutes and some might say well what
[51:38] about
[51:40] this and what about that I thought this
[51:43] was to come
[51:45] back I thought there was supposed to be
[51:47] a meeting here or this or
[51:50] that I'm not trying to figure out any
[51:52] other
[51:54] mystery all I know I was told to do by
[51:58] Jesus was to watch and
[52:02] pray was to watch and
[52:05] pray I was told to keep my lamp
[52:11] trimmed I was told to keep my uh garment
[52:16] white I was told to
[52:19] pray I was told to look
[52:22] up I was told to look for him to return
[52:27] the only thing I need to make sure that
[52:29] I do not
[52:31] miss is the return of Jesus
[52:34] Christ who comes before after this or
[52:37] that got nothing to do with
[52:39] me are you listening can you say amen I
[52:43] I I don't know about you brother M but I
[52:45] was not looking for
[52:47] Jesus but Jesus found me I was not
[52:50] looking for the
[52:52] word but the word found
[52:54] me I was not looking looking for uh the
[52:58] message but the message found
[53:01] me I was not looking for a
[53:03] revelation of whether I was bride or not
[53:08] but that Revelation found
[53:10] me I was not looking to marry Jesus
[53:14] Christ but marriage came along that
[53:17] way not because I loved him or that I
[53:21] was looking for his
[53:23] love but because he first loved me
[53:27] oh is it doesn't that make you
[53:29] excited I didn't look for the the
[53:32] revelation of any
[53:34] mystery but those Revelations found
[53:37] me I didn't look to be a a a Ministry a
[53:42] minister but that found
[53:44] me I was not ever trying to be a
[53:47] pastor but that calling found
[53:50] me somebody help me now I was not
[53:54] looking for the Holy Ghost
[53:56] but the Holy Ghost found
[53:58] me I was not looking for forgiveness
[54:01] of but forgiveness found
[54:04] me I was not looking for
[54:07] Grace but Amazing
[54:10] Grace hallelujah hallelujah and that
[54:13] makes us the happiest people on the
[54:16] Earth so what are you trying to say I'm
[54:20] not looking for brother Brandon's
[54:22] return I'm not against it he has to come
[54:26] back
[54:27] he will come back I'm not looking for
[54:29] the tent but if there is one it will
[54:33] find
[54:35] me you understand I don't have to look
[54:38] for it brother I'll be
[54:40] there if anything needs to
[54:43] happen to get me from here to there I'll
[54:46] be there I'll be

[55:04] on too many things that don't look don't
[55:06] worry about
[55:08] it God let God manifest his
[55:13] word by bringing it to

[55:19] word by bringing it to
[55:22] pass we don't need anybody we don't need
[55:25] anybody
[55:26] trying to make it
[55:29] happen it's going to
[55:31] happen we didn't we didn't have nothing
[55:33] to do with Israel going back to their
[55:37] Homeland God caused that to
[55:41] happen we can't force unity in the
[55:44] bride but circumstances will cause that
[55:47] to
[55:49] happen look when the pressure comes
[55:52] down the brother you didn't really want

[58:35] made here comes the
[58:37] bride Here Comes the Bride here comes
[58:42] the she has made
[58:45] her can somebody shout
[58:48] amen we're at that
[58:50] hour We're Here we are here
[58:56] the day that we've been waiting
[58:58] for is finally
[59:03] here my god oh
[59:08] Hallelujah when that happened a year ago
[59:11] October the
[59:13] 7th when Palestine
[59:15] attacked I made
[59:17] a a bold
[59:25] assumption said with all the
[59:28] technology did you really think Israel
[59:30] didn't know Palestine was going to do
[59:33] that they
[59:34] knew but they had to have a
[59:40] reason we'll talk a little bit is that
[59:42] okay and now Iran has attacked
[59:47] Israel do you really think Israel didn't
[59:49] know they were going to do
[59:52] that they knew but then they made a
[59:55] statement thus
[59:57] now we have a legitimate
[1:00:00] reason you
[1:00:02] out kind of strange they still haven't
[1:00:06] really done much have you noticed
[1:00:08] that but I I told some of the Brethren I
[1:00:10] said it's like a
[1:00:12] box a boxer he'll go in there and he'll
[1:00:16] let the other guy punch himself out and
[1:00:19] just wait
[1:00:20] patiently and when they see them kind of
[1:00:22] wearing
[1:00:23] down then they can lower the boom on
[1:00:25] them
[1:00:27] Israel is just waiting for the right
[1:00:30] time Israel is just collecting five
[1:00:33] smoth
[1:00:34] Stones Little David is just
[1:00:37] waiting for the right time to do what
[1:00:39] they got to
[1:00:41] do and it might just
[1:00:43] be once we're out of
[1:00:46] here I'm just saying I've noticed that
[1:00:49] every time they do
[1:00:51] attack every time they do
[1:00:53] strike they hit very precis
[1:00:57] L they took out the leader of
[1:01:00] Hezbollah and then they took out the
[1:01:02] next
[1:01:03] guy and did you hear what happened with
[1:01:05] the third guy that's coming upar what he
[1:01:07] said he said I'm going to return to
[1:01:10] Iran and
[1:01:12] pray before accepting this
[1:01:15] position I thought that's a very wise
[1:01:18] man but I got to tell the church the
[1:01:20] other day I said you know what I'm not
[1:01:22] saying this is so and I've always been
[1:01:25] kind of
[1:01:27] foggy on
[1:01:30] how yeah on how the two prophets are
[1:01:33] supposed to fit
[1:01:36] in how
[1:01:37] Happ I said but Israel is so
[1:01:41] precise it almost makes you
[1:01:44] wonder is there a Prophet or two telling
[1:01:46] them where to
[1:01:48] strike just a thought
[1:01:52] just what I'm trying to get you to do is
[1:01:56] is is provoke your spiritual
[1:02:02] thinking come on say Amen loud of that I
[1:02:05] got to challenge your spiritual
[1:02:09] mind the time for passing it on to
[1:02:11] another age is
[1:02:14] over there is no other age after
[1:02:18] this you got two people coming in trying
[1:02:21] to get in office
[1:02:26] personally for the first time
[1:02:28] ever think that voting for me is a waste
[1:02:30] of
[1:02:32] time it doesn't matter who wins she's
[1:02:35] getting in and and I I I I kind of blame
[1:02:39] that on all the stubborn message
[1:02:42] people who just had to see her go
[1:02:45] in ready you see what I'm saying we've
[1:02:49] got to do something to shake your mind
[1:02:54] up got to
[1:02:57] happen what more needs to take place for
[1:03:01] you to
[1:03:02] realize the bridegroom is
[1:03:07] calling what more needs to
[1:03:09] happen behold the bridegroom
[1:03:12] come the Gabriel call is going
[1:03:16] out has to be
[1:03:18] said what more has to be

[1:14:07] part but he said when we all get to
[1:14:11] heaven we have a water right he said
[1:14:14] when we all get to
[1:14:15] heaven I asked because they're so neatly
[1:14:21] stacked so I didn't want to break it up
[1:14:23] you know
[1:14:26] well that was a Satan's poison I'm glad
[1:14:27] I didn't grab
[1:14:31] that you're going to have to tell me
[1:14:33] whatever this is all about
[1:14:36] I where is the anointing
[1:14:39] oil oh here it is all right but brother
[1:14:43] green us to
[1:14:44] say when we get to heaven we're all
[1:14:47] going to speak
[1:14:49] German know speak the
[1:14:52] and huh I no why I don't know huh but he
[1:14:57] did say that Spanish is the RO most
[1:15:00] romantic language there
[1:15:03] is say amen
[1:15:06] amen all right so he said we'd all sing
[1:15:09] in
[1:15:10] Spanish I said you know what I believe
[1:15:14] that you know I thought in a room full
[1:15:16] of Hispanics they get all
[1:15:19] excited I thought I was going to
[1:15:22] hear you know something
[1:15:26] nothing I said we're all going to sing
[1:15:32] [Applause]
[1:15:38] Spanish right I know I know he's coming
[1:15:42] in the
[1:15:45] morning
[1:15:47] help well you'll get it you'll be
[1:15:50] walking down the street tomorrow and
[1:15:51] you're going to go I am happy he's
[1:15:53] coming
[1:15:55] just just think about
[1:15:56] it as I Glide through the
[1:15:59] air farewell
[1:16:02] farewell Sweet Hour of
[1:16:05] Prayer no more
[1:16:08] wondering no more
[1:16:11] guessing no more
[1:16:13] confusion no more pleading and
[1:16:19] begging for God to forgive you because
[1:16:23] you did it again
[1:16:26] no more cry out for your sons and
[1:16:29] daughters because you'll be holding her
[1:16:31] hand as you
[1:16:33] go don't you understand what I'm getting
[1:16:36] at
[1:16:36] now who would want to stay here one more
[1:16:39] minute if you don't have
[1:16:44] to even so
[1:16:46] Lord even
[1:16:49] so anyhow he said we'd be singing in
[1:16:53] Spanish I realize that the Spanish
[1:16:58] language does things in Translation to
[1:17:01] the English
[1:17:04] language that most other languages don't
[1:17:08] do for example if I say I am the
[1:17:12] alpha say it slowly I am the
[1:17:17] alpha there's a masculine
[1:17:20] there and then if I say I am the Omega
[1:17:26] GA thank you Omega now that's a feminine
[1:17:30] side to that no other language does that
[1:17:34] not even English one not even
[1:17:37] English so but the Spanish
[1:17:41] language a beautiful
[1:17:44] secret in Spanish Jesus is
[1:17:47] saying I am he and I am she
[1:17:56] you're getting it you're getting it
[1:17:57] you're getting it right but Omega means
[1:18:02] end so he's not just any
[1:18:06] SE he's the end time
[1:18:12] SE he's not just any
[1:18:15] bride he's in the end
[1:18:20] time I am the
[1:18:23] alha the
[1:18:25] I'm the beginning and I'm the
[1:18:29] end if you can wrap your heart around
[1:18:32] that you realize you're not going to
[1:18:36] miss
[1:18:37] this because he's carrying you
[1:18:44] in oh hallelujah
[1:18:46] hallelujah a't that
[1:18:50] beautiful I think it is
[1:18:54] amen the Lord is going to
[1:18:57] restore he's restoring Israel now he
[1:19:01] been restored but you see what I
[1:19:04] mean I think it's strange
[1:19:06] brother that for years we've told
[1:19:09] Iran they can't have nuclear
[1:19:12] weapons they're not allowed to have
[1:19:15] bombs we don't want to hear that and we
[1:19:18] make
[1:19:19] threats we don't carry them
[1:19:22] out but we put sanctions on them
[1:19:26] we put the what they call that um
[1:19:28] tariffs on
[1:19:29] them then we we've just uh I call it
[1:19:32] black B what they call it where they um
[1:19:34] well anyway they boycott
[1:19:36] it anything I don't know that Iran makes
[1:19:39] anything but anything they
[1:19:43] make and and then Israel comes along and
[1:19:47] says we're going to destroy their
[1:19:48] nuclear
[1:19:50] plants something we said we want them
[1:19:53] not to have
[1:19:56] but Israel says we're going to do it the
[1:19:59] United States
[1:20:02] says see you're all quiet because you're
[1:20:05] just as confused as I
[1:20:06] am there's something wrong with this
[1:20:09] picture to the
[1:20:12] unbeliever it's okay but to the believer
[1:20:15] we
[1:20:16] realize the United States has turned her
[1:20:20] back on her
[1:20:22] Ally you see it
[1:20:25] we're at the end time I can't say that
[1:20:27] no more because it like it's just going
[1:20:29] to get I don't want to get morbid on you
[1:20:30] I want it to be life to
[1:20:34] you brother Brandon said this about Eve
[1:20:37] the bride Eve let's remember this the
[1:20:40] first one she was promised to be a
[1:20:45] redeemer okay she was promised to be a
[1:20:47] redeemer and then her Redeemer uh her
[1:20:51] Redeemer would be her Redeemer would be
[1:20:53] the worst
[1:20:56] is that right and when the word came
[1:20:59] made
[1:20:59] flesh what she
[1:21:02] rejected see that was the first one and
[1:21:05] then in this particular quote here he
[1:21:08] goes on to talk about how the the
[1:21:10] Israelite Hebrews in the Old Testament
[1:21:14] they were a second Eve in this
[1:21:16] particular and they rejected her but he
[1:21:19] talks about this end time
[1:21:22] Eve whether it's two or three don't
[1:21:25] matter he's talking about this end time
[1:21:27] Eve and he said she will never
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:35] fail she's not going to
[1:21:40] fall right how many if I could ask this
[1:21:43] how many is battling something uh you
[1:21:45] got don't stand up and say what it is
[1:21:47] but if you got something you know I
[1:21:49] don't care if it's health or some kind
[1:21:51] of whatever it might
[1:21:52] be if you got a struggle right now
[1:21:56] you and you're thinking to
[1:21:59] yourself I don't know did you see that
[1:22:01] even your pastor
[1:22:02] ra even I raised my hand ain't nobody
[1:22:05] perfect here right and you may be
[1:22:09] wondering if this particular struggle is
[1:22:12] going to keep
[1:22:14] out now brother monya this is just
[1:22:16] brother
[1:22:18] Cale I I I I I was when I was sitting
[1:22:21] there I had an emergency prayer meeting
[1:22:24] the day that Iran attacked
[1:22:27] Israel and as many people that would
[1:22:29] come we
[1:22:32] prayed and basically we wanted to just
[1:22:34] make
[1:22:36] sure that if this is the
[1:22:39] eve of your coming I want to know that
[1:22:44] I'm in the right
[1:22:46] place I want to know my life is all
[1:22:49] right and I was talking to one of the
[1:22:51] brethren in the
[1:22:53] office and just I guess I got very
[1:22:58] transparent and I said my life is not
[1:23:03] ready for what's
[1:23:06] coming wow you can hear a pin drop
[1:23:10] now and the brother said mine
[1:23:13] Nei and he goes what are we going to
[1:23:18] do I like I was like what are you asking
[1:23:20] me
[1:23:23] for and I said you know I said we're
[1:23:25] going to lean on the grace of
[1:23:28] God this this is just
[1:23:31] me I don't think that it is
[1:23:35] possible for anybody in their
[1:23:38] flesh to ever not make a
[1:23:43] mistake because this belongs to
[1:23:48] Satan right so much so that he
[1:23:51] challenged Michael the Archangel
[1:23:55] for the body of
[1:23:57] Moses see and it gives me
[1:24:01] pleasure because it gets me to
[1:24:04] understand God is not coming back for
[1:24:07] this he's coming back for the only part
[1:24:10] of
[1:24:12] him that belongs to him and that's that
[1:24:16] scene that he has placed
[1:24:19] there before the foundation of
[1:24:25] and this
[1:24:26] seed has
[1:24:28] never has never has never has never has
[1:24:33] never done anything
[1:24:39] wrong that
[1:24:41] se brother chewy has never
[1:24:47] sinned do you believe
[1:24:49] that in your flesh it's hard to
[1:24:51] understand
[1:24:54] but how can something
[1:24:57] perfect live in your
[1:24:59] heart and make a
[1:25:04] mistake what was that cannot happen it
[1:25:08] cannot happen he who is
[1:25:11] perfect if he lives in your
[1:25:14] heart I know your flesh buffets you
[1:25:16] every day I know it
[1:25:18] does I'd like to tear it off and fight
[1:25:26] right it'd be a funny picture yeah I've
[1:25:30] seen people do
[1:25:31] that and I wondered to myself does that
[1:25:36] work you know I've seen people do that
[1:25:40] you know what it is
[1:25:47] frustration the O the power the devil
[1:25:49] tries to have over your
[1:25:52] mind to over over
[1:25:55] think to
[1:25:57] overthink brother

[1:31:46] appreciates your pastor
[1:31:49] here not yelling at you not trying to
[1:31:52] tell you what to do
[1:31:54] he's just trying to assure that you got
[1:31:56] your place in your
[1:31:57] kingdom
[1:32:01] excuse I want you to remember something
[1:32:04] the king and the queen are not
[1:32:09] equal they're not
[1:32:12] equal yes she has the same
[1:32:15] power yes he backs her
[1:32:18] up but without
[1:32:21] him she's not a queen
[1:32:24] without her he's still the
[1:32:28] king remember where all the honor and
[1:32:30] Glory goes
[1:32:33] to remember where your your gratitude
[1:32:36] goes
[1:32:37] to this may not rhyme in
[1:32:40] Spanish but the right
[1:32:42] attitude shows
[1:32:45] gratitude I heard another brother
[1:32:47] Say be humble don't
[1:32:52] grumble right we have to remember who we
[1:32:56] are we're not chosen because we're
[1:33:02] somebody be blessed not
[1:33:06] stressed can you say Amen we worry too
[1:33:10] much remember one thing you're not
[1:33:14] predestinated because you're beautiful
[1:33:16] and all this he simply chose
[1:33:20] you and that's it I don't know why he
[1:33:24] chose me I may not have but I'm glad he
[1:33:28] did 2217 of Revelation
[1:33:32] says and the spirit and the bride say
[1:33:35] come and let him that hear say come and
[1:33:39] let him that is a thirst
[1:33:41] come and whosoever will let him take the
[1:33:45] Water of Life
[1:33:48] freely and then at the same chapter
[1:33:51] verse 20 and 21
[1:33:55] it says he which
[1:33:57] testify these things say surely I come
[1:34:02] quickly amen even
[1:34:04] so John said even
[1:34:07] so typ of the
[1:34:10] Bride so the bride says
[1:34:13] so come Lord
[1:34:17] Jesus I
[1:34:19] know that there's a lot may miss it
[1:34:23] there's nothing I can do about
[1:34:26] that but I also
[1:34:28] know that there's a lot of us that are
[1:34:31] going to be
[1:34:33] there and I I guess uh I was trying to
[1:34:36] say it this
[1:34:38] way but my long s
[1:34:40] my my
[1:34:42] desire to see him is beginning to
[1:34:46] outweigh my long
[1:34:50] suffering you know look Lord just just
[1:34:52] if we could find 50
[1:34:55] Lord if you could find 40 That's Abraham
[1:34:56] right if there' be 10
[1:34:59] Lord suddenly you know I'm like Lord if
[1:35:02] you'll just restore this one if you'll
[1:35:05] just restore that one but the more I
[1:35:07] talk to him the more I just want to see
[1:35:10] him my balance is now
[1:35:13] off and I'm not afraid to say so I want
[1:35:16] to see him
[1:35:18] more than live another
[1:35:20] day I'd rather see him more
[1:35:24] than tomorrow
[1:35:26] sunrise I want to see him
[1:35:29] more than watch another
[1:35:31] inauguration of another hypocrite get in
[1:35:35] the
[1:35:36] office I want to oh I want to see
[1:35:40] him look upon his face there to sing
[1:35:44] forever of Saving Grace that's what I
[1:35:48] want isn't that what you want it's just
[1:35:51] off now
[1:35:53] come quickly Lord I want to see you I've
[1:35:57] had enough of this world I've had enough
[1:35:59] for the trials I don't want to fail
[1:36:02] anymore I don't want to be disgusted
[1:36:05] with myself
[1:36:07] anymore I don't want to be frustrated
[1:36:09] with myself
[1:36:10] anymore I want to see you
[1:36:13] Lord the prophet of God said this he
[1:36:16] said if you want to if you want to
[1:36:19] escape the
[1:36:21] world uh to escape your Tri
[1:36:25] or to get away from your your finances
[1:36:27] I'm throwing in
[1:36:29] there whatever your problem is he said
[1:36:32] he'll never come that way he said but
[1:36:35] when you get to a
[1:36:36] place and you're desperate your
[1:36:38] desperation sets
[1:36:40] in and all you want to do is see his
[1:36:44] face he'll come
[1:36:47] then how many wants to see
[1:36:49] him how many's had
[1:36:52] enough raise your hands with
[1:36:54] me Lord I need you right
[1:36:59] now this is where I'm
[1:37:02] at this is how I feel and I see I'm in a
[1:37:06] room full of Believers that feel the
[1:37:09] same and I know dear
[1:37:13] God that the church back home believes
[1:37:15] the
[1:37:16] same granted father we
[1:37:19] pray not to live to see another day
[1:37:24] but to live to see your face for your
[1:37:27] honor and For Your
[1:37:28] Glory in Jesus Christ
[1:37:30] name as Pastor comes God bless
[1:37:38] you stand up
[1:37:42] please the more I I hear individuals
[1:37:48] speak the more I tell
[1:37:50] myself why the bride needs to be in
[1:37:55] step we are out of Step let me be frank
[1:37:59] with you the bride today is out of
[1:38:03] Step she does what she wants to do she
[1:38:07] doesn't want to be
[1:38:10] subject she doesn't want to be
[1:38:13] disciplined she does and she will do
[1:38:18] until as the brother
[1:38:21] said God reveals to
[1:38:25] her I'm waiting for that Dimension to
[1:38:28] open
[1:38:29] up waiting for that door to
[1:38:33] open I
[1:38:36] long to see the faces of those gone on
[1:38:41] but if I'm not born
[1:38:43] again no
[1:38:45] good he didn't say filled with the Holy
[1:38:48] Ghost he said you must be born
[1:38:52] again that's that's our problem we think
[1:38:55] we're born
[1:38:57] again the Bible tells
[1:39:00] me I love it in
[1:39:05] Spanish you're
[1:39:08] subject of those that have account of
[1:39:11] your
[1:39:13] life who is it who's going to give an
[1:39:17] account for you phix li house when you
[1:39:22] go without asking
[1:39:26] permission before you tell me I'm going
[1:39:30] here are you telling
[1:39:32] me or are you
[1:39:35] asking the bride needs to be in
[1:39:39] Step she doesn't know post to duty
[1:39:44] because like
[1:39:45] Adam left his
[1:39:48] post now you
[1:39:50] can he left his post
[1:39:56] when he should have been
[1:39:58] Vigilant he fell
[1:40:01] asleep he didn't listen to
[1:40:05] God even
[1:40:07] Satan said God is a
[1:40:13] liar and they accepted that
[1:40:16] Revelation or the lady accepted or Eve
[1:40:20] accepted that Revelation because she
[1:40:24] took and that's what we do today we're
[1:40:27] in the end time there's no more room to
[1:40:31] play
[1:40:32] church either I'm in
[1:40:35] church or I'm out of the will of

[1:48:17] flesh and if you're the word made
[1:48:20] flesh you better start looking

[1:49:01] Spirit raise your hand you want to be by
[1:49:04] the Holy Spirit you may not understand
[1:49:07] it but you want to be
[1:49:09] governed by the Holy
[1:49:13] Spirit put your hands down and listen to
[1:49:19] this the Holy Spirit that's what it is
[1:49:24] brother Brenham said be
[1:49:27] careful the reason he said be
[1:49:30] careful if it's against the word of
[1:49:38] God the word of God a
[1:49:42] spirit it's not the Holy
[1:49:45] Spirit the holy spirit will never
[1:49:52] let a
[1:49:55] person do something wrong in their
[1:50:00] life it will stop
[1:50:03] him but it's like the brother
[1:50:06] said this hybrid
[1:50:13] flesh I tell you this
[1:50:16] morning you think you
[1:50:20] believe that you're sinners
[1:50:24] I say
[1:50:26] yes I believe we're
[1:50:30] Sinners because that's
[1:50:32] flesh it's not inside of the heart that
[1:50:37] seed that real the Royal the real the
[1:50:41] real you doesn't
[1:50:44] sin but the
[1:50:46] flesh is what
[1:50:49] sins When you pray
[1:50:52] because you did something
[1:50:54] wrong not from in
[1:50:57] here what you did
[1:50:59] wrong was this the flesh this flesh
[1:51:02] right
[1:51:04] here but I heard an apostle say this
[1:51:08] sooner or
[1:51:09] later you will
[1:51:11] govern this
[1:51:14] flesh that's what I
[1:51:17] want be the ruler of the word of God and
[1:51:21] to re
[1:51:23] and to
[1:51:24] say I am I am
[1:51:28] perfect I am
[1:51:31] perfect the word of
[1:51:33] God he doesn't see he sees the
[1:51:38] blood and if I am the
[1:51:41] blood how can I sin
[1:51:45] then Hess young men young
[1:51:50] people it's ending
[1:51:53] time is
[1:51:56] ending there's no more time to play
[1:52:01] around God has a
[1:52:03] plan that
[1:52:05] plan we should follow it that plan it's
[1:52:10] written in your
[1:52:13] heart I tell you
[1:52:17] this when you come into
[1:52:20] Christ Christ is the an
[1:52:25] anointed the world Fades
[1:52:29] away we don't have the world inside of
[1:52:31] us anymore but it's around us the
[1:52:35] anointing of the
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:39] world it's not inside of
[1:52:41] me the things of the world are
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:48] hovering am in a condition so weak
[1:52:55] that anointing comes
[1:52:57] in takes me as a
[1:53:00] prisoner what I don't want to
[1:53:04] do and that's the reason why that I say
[1:53:11] careful because that
[1:53:15] anointing it's double anointing brother
[1:53:17] Brenham said 200 million Spirits are
[1:53:21] coming after the why to do one thing to
[1:53:25] destroy
[1:53:26] us he wants to destroy you this morning
[1:53:32] so what are we goingon to
[1:53:36] do brother Chey he mentioned you apply
[1:53:41] the
[1:53:42] blood apply the
[1:53:44] blood not only to

[1:54:02] Liv unto the Lord Jesus CHR is it going
[1:54:06] to be
[1:54:07] hard well yes everything is hard that's
[1:54:11] why brother Brenham said you don't
[1:54:15] suffer you can't
[1:54:19] rain that's why the suffering every day
[1:54:22] we
[1:54:24] suffer you're going to suffer in your
[1:54:26] death
[1:54:29] bed and the one that makes you suffer
[1:54:33] that brings everything to your
[1:54:35] mind is
[1:54:37] Satan

[1:54:41] changed history repeats
[1:54:44] itself he destroyed the first bride
[1:54:48] destroyed the second bride but let me
[1:54:50] tell you
