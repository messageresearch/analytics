[1:04:54] that is very
[1:04:57] special and I give thanks to God for
[1:04:59] each one of
[1:05:01] you this
[1:05:04] morning we'll be giving just somewhat of
[1:05:06] a
[1:05:09] report it what went on in
[1:05:12] Colombia in
[1:05:16] Baran but before that let us first go
[1:05:18] into the
[1:05:21] scripture and then we will be praying
[1:05:26] we'll be going to Genesis
[1:05:28] 1:1 we'll be reading until verse
[1:05:33] 5 you can indicate it with an amen once
[1:05:35] you have
[1:05:38] it and the word of God
[1:05:52] reads in the beginning God created the
[1:05:55] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[1:05:56] without form and void and darkness was
[1:05:58] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[1:06:00] of God moved upon the face of the
[1:06:04] waters and God said let there be light
[1:06:07] and there was
[1:06:13] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:06:15] good and God divided the light from the
[1:06:23] darkness
[1:06:26] and God called the light day and the
[1:06:28] Darkness he called night and the evening
[1:06:29] and the morning were the first
[1:06:32] day we'll be jumping to verse 11 all the
[1:06:36] way to
[1:06:53] 13
[1:06:55] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[1:06:56] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:06:58] fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind
[1:07:01] whose seed is in itself upon the Earth
[1:07:03] and it was
[1:07:19] so and the Earth brought forth grass and
[1:07:21] Herb yielding seed after its kind and
[1:07:24] tree yielding fruit whose seed was in
[1:07:25] itself after his kind and God saw that
[1:07:28] it was
[1:07:33] good and the evening and the morning
[1:07:35] were the third
[1:07:37] day please bow your
[1:07:41] heads Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly
[1:07:45] Father we humbly come before thine
[1:07:47] presence
[1:07:51] father Lord we know that you are the
[1:07:53] only one we can run
[1:07:55] to here we are prepared and
[1:07:59] ready to receive your holy word this
[1:08:03] morning Lord we come in
[1:08:07] expectation knowing that you have
[1:08:08] something prepared for
[1:08:10] us we just ask
[1:08:13] Lord may you open up our
[1:08:17] hearts so that that word may come
[1:08:20] in and may make itself manifest in our
[1:08:23] lives
[1:08:26] Lord and above all Heavenly Father we
[1:08:28] give you
[1:08:31] thanks and likewise we ask you for our
[1:08:35] pastor who is currently out of town at
[1:08:37] the
[1:08:38] moment Lord help him take care of him
[1:08:42] and be with
[1:08:44] him and we thank you for all
[1:08:47] things we place this all in your
[1:08:49] precious
[1:08:50] name in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ amen amen
[1:08:55] you may be
[1:09:04] seated
[1:09:09] Wednesday
[1:09:13] yeah and so we got to Colombia on
[1:09:16] Thursday
[1:09:19] Wednesday I'm sorry we got there
[1:09:22] Wednesday we got to Colombia on
[1:09:29] Wednesday we were prepared because I
[1:09:31] believe brother Manny felt its lot on
[1:09:35] Thursday and mine would have been
[1:09:39] Friday and so it felt a lot me and
[1:09:42] brother Manny
[1:09:45] [Music]
[1:09:46] together and truly I learned a lot from
[1:09:48] our brother
[1:09:51] Manny the wisdom that he has
[1:09:56] and I just ask
[1:10:03] God I can at least reach to his feet of
[1:10:05] everything he
[1:10:10] knows but we knew that it would fall our
[1:10:12] law to
[1:10:15] speak so we were talking to each other
[1:10:16] when we were in our
[1:10:19] room asking what are you going to talk
[1:10:21] about what do you think you're going to
[1:10:22] talk about and so we were
[1:10:26] speaking and we reached a conclusion of
[1:10:28] what we were going to talk
[1:10:31] about Sab Tes and on Thursday he spoke
[1:10:34] in sabana
[1:10:36] Torres with our pastor
[1:10:41] darier and on
[1:10:44] Friday it fell my lot to come
[1:10:51] forward I mentioned them right when I
[1:10:53] went
[1:10:55] up that it was just a small
[1:10:59] talk because each time I say that it's
[1:11:02] just a small
[1:11:03] talk it it sort of calms myself down a
[1:11:06] little
[1:11:10] bit so it fell my lot to
[1:11:14] speak and the focus was the
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:18] youth I gave a short
[1:11:22] testimony
[1:11:24] and I truly thank God for
[1:11:28] that and on Friday
[1:11:31] night we got together with the
[1:11:38] youth and I asked each one of them to
[1:11:40] bring or find a Bible because we're
[1:11:41] going to play some
[1:11:44] games Brother
[1:11:47] Joseph he was the one who was helping me
[1:11:51] out he was guiding or taking charge of
[1:11:54] the
[1:12:00] games we were doing a game where I would
[1:12:02] give them a
[1:12:04] scripture and the one who could find it
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:08] fastest they had plenty of
[1:12:11] fun we were there for a good amount of
[1:12:15] time until we had to
[1:12:18] go but I did mention to
[1:12:22] them that on
[1:12:26] Sunday we would be giving away two
[1:12:29] tablets to agapo
[1:12:32] tablets so they were all very
[1:12:37] excited I told them there was going to
[1:12:39] be a
[1:12:41] competition and the one who accumulated
[1:12:43] the most
[1:12:46] points the two people who would have the
[1:12:48] most
[1:12:50] points they're the ones who would win
[1:12:52] the tablets
[1:12:54] so they were very
[1:12:58] motivated so after Friday
[1:13:02] um Saturday
[1:13:07] came Dr Monto went up to pray
[1:13:13] prach it was trly a very impactful
[1:13:19] service I believe that many people were
[1:13:21] delivered that night many
[1:13:27] youth after the
[1:13:31] service what I did is I first placed
[1:13:33] them all in the
[1:13:36] circle there was a lot of new young
[1:13:39] people who
[1:13:43] came so I wanted them to get to know
[1:13:45] each other their names or where they
[1:13:47] come from and so
[1:13:51] on so each one gave out their their
[1:13:53] their
[1:13:55] name and then later what we
[1:13:58] did I paired them up into
[1:14:02] groups and what I asked each one of them
[1:14:04] to
[1:14:10] do to give a testimony of how God has
[1:14:12] helped them in their
[1:14:15] life because because we know that there
[1:14:17] was a lot of young people that this was
[1:14:19] their first
[1:14:20] time and many times
[1:14:25] The Young Ones the
[1:14:29] youth it's easier to listen from another
[1:14:31] young
[1:14:32] person what has
[1:14:35] happened and then they start thinking
[1:14:37] upon
[1:14:41] themselves if they went through that and
[1:14:43] they're currently doing
[1:14:45] well then I will also be
[1:14:51] well so I separated each one of them
[1:14:53] into a
[1:14:54] group and as each one of them
[1:14:59] spoke I was listening to what they were
[1:15:06] saying there were two testimonies who
[1:15:09] greatly impacted
[1:15:11] me there was a young
[1:15:14] sister she was telling her
[1:15:22] testimony she was saying that her
[1:15:24] parents for a good amount of
[1:15:27] time they had left or departed from the
[1:15:32] church and she didn't know
[1:15:38] why but even her within
[1:15:41] herself she knew who God
[1:15:46] was and when she was
[1:15:50] told that she was going to go to church
[1:15:52] on Saturday
[1:15:55] she said she rejoiced within
[1:15:59] herself because said well now I'm going
[1:16:01] to go to
[1:16:04] church she says that when she attended
[1:16:06] the
[1:16:10] service she said that she had so much
[1:16:12] fun that she liked it so
[1:16:18] much he says how could I be missing out
[1:16:20] on so
[1:16:22] much
[1:16:23] that was really impactful for
[1:16:29] me and one of the young sisters as well
[1:16:32] Grace her name is
[1:16:38] Grace each time that she tells her
[1:16:43] testimony I really see The Wonder of
[1:16:52] God even in what the doctors were
[1:16:54] telling
[1:16:56] her God had another plan in mind
[1:17:02] um so that was very impactful for
[1:17:07] me and so there was a lot of young
[1:17:09] people who hadn't come
[1:17:11] before and I would hear them
[1:17:16] talk and one of them was telling
[1:17:21] me he says for a long long
[1:17:23] time they used to invite me to
[1:17:27] church when there was services in
[1:17:33] baranka he said I I knew that I I should
[1:17:39] go but I didn't feel like it was
[1:17:42] time so he would always say
[1:17:47] no he says but something inside of me
[1:17:51] this
[1:17:52] time
[1:17:53] told me get up and go to
[1:17:59] church he said God truly did something
[1:18:02] in me this
[1:18:05] Saturday so I see all the testimony of
[1:18:07] the young
[1:18:09] ones and I see the god of the the hand
[1:18:11] of God moving and
[1:18:13] working and I give thanks to God for
[1:18:17] that something that I used to say or I
[1:18:20] would
[1:18:21] say
[1:18:23] it's always good to have great big
[1:18:26] events it's good to have
[1:18:30] getaways but when you sit down with a
[1:18:33] person and you listen to their
[1:18:35] stories you listen to their
[1:18:38] past and you see how God has helped
[1:18:44] them that's where it truly makes an
[1:18:46] impact on your
[1:18:48] life and I give thanks to God for
[1:18:51] that and on
[1:18:54] Sunday well before going into
[1:18:57] Sunday on
[1:19:00] Saturday we went a bit over
[1:19:04] time the young ones didn't want to
[1:19:09] leave they were having plenty of
[1:19:13] fun we're playing
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] charades and so they truly had
[1:19:21] fun but on
[1:19:25] Sunday we got the the activities ready
[1:19:28] we prepared
[1:19:30] them to be able to win the
[1:19:39] tablets and so on Sunday our brother
[1:19:42] Moreno opened up with Sunday school our
[1:19:44] brother
[1:19:49] El and then our pastor came forth to
[1:19:51] preach on Sunday morning
[1:19:58] truly Brothers the place was
[1:20:01] full we had to sit some people
[1:20:06] outside to place a speaker outside so
[1:20:08] that they could
[1:20:10] hear but truly there is a
[1:20:13] hunger for
[1:20:15] God to hear the word of
[1:20:18] God not just with the adults but with
[1:20:21] the youth
[1:20:26] and I thank God for that as
[1:20:28] well after the
[1:20:34] service we went outside to organize the
[1:20:39] activities uh we did a couple of
[1:20:44] activities I'm going to be honest with
[1:20:48] you I'm still not I'm still not used to
[1:20:50] the
[1:20:51] humidity
[1:20:54] one of the young ones told
[1:20:58] me you look you look like on Sunday you
[1:21:01] look like you're a bit low on
[1:21:04] energy he says that's CU I'm still yet
[1:21:06] to get used to the
[1:21:09] humidity each time I would go into the
[1:21:11] sanctuary because inside it's very
[1:21:17] cool but everything was good thanks to
[1:21:20] God and
[1:21:24] but before that we were doing a couple
[1:21:25] of
[1:21:29] activities now that the humidity or the
[1:21:31] sun was very
[1:21:36] strong I asked them all to stop for a
[1:21:38] moment and drink some water so that they
[1:21:41] would drink
[1:21:43] water and the truth was I myself was
[1:21:45] really thirsty as
[1:21:47] well
[1:21:49] um and but what I noticed
[1:21:54] that when you have the
[1:21:56] youth and you give them
[1:21:59] time by themselves they begin to open up
[1:22:03] and they begin to have fellowship with
[1:22:06] the rest of the
[1:22:08] youth and in my
[1:22:11] mind I asked myself what am I gonna
[1:22:16] do it's too hot to be doing activities
[1:22:19] that are
[1:22:20] moving so I was thinking about it
[1:22:23] and when I went out of the
[1:22:27] sanctuary the youth were already talking
[1:22:29] to each
[1:22:30] other and I said well that's that's very
[1:22:35] fine and so then our
[1:22:41] pastor he went with the brothers back to
[1:22:43] the
[1:22:45] hotel and we went to go buy some
[1:22:48] pizza I believe it was about eight
[1:22:51] boxes
[1:22:55] and we took them to the
[1:23:01] youth and the youth well they they took
[1:23:03] all the
[1:23:05] pizza and not just the youth also a
[1:23:08] couple of
[1:23:12] adults but at that
[1:23:18] time since I already tallied up the
[1:23:20] points that each person had already
[1:23:22] accumulated
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:29] and the ones who won the agabo
[1:23:33] tablets Tes one was our sister miari
[1:23:39] Torres and our sister Ken
[1:23:43] Pao and there they are on the
[1:23:48] screen one of them when I mentioned them
[1:23:50] that they had won the tablet
[1:23:53] I gave it to
[1:23:56] her and she told me well why are you
[1:23:58] giving this to me I sold her you you
[1:24:00] earned it and she said me see and I said
[1:24:06] yes she said are you
[1:24:09] sure and I said yes okay okay she said
[1:24:13] all
[1:24:14] right and then
[1:24:16] later she sent me a
[1:24:18] message he said
[1:24:21] brother
[1:24:23] said I still can't believe that I won
[1:24:24] the
[1:24:26] tablet and I said thanks be to
[1:24:33] God I believe that's truly going to be a
[1:24:35] blessing to each one of
[1:24:38] them and I just ask
[1:24:40] God that he may guide
[1:24:44] them and may He help them in their
[1:24:51] walk Wednesday or
[1:24:58] Thursday and on
[1:25:03] Wednesday it was a day we were to leave
[1:25:08] um but for one reason or the
[1:25:11] other we were not able to
[1:25:14] leave they canceled our
[1:25:18] flight we stayed in bot for another
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:25] now in the morning of
[1:25:27] Thursday we were set to
[1:25:31] leave our flights were
[1:25:34] delayed Phoenix so truly we didn't get
[1:25:37] to
[1:25:40] Phoenix until almost past
[1:25:43] midnight so it was pretty much Friday
[1:25:47] um but I give thanks to God
[1:25:51] um
[1:25:57] but something that I would like to tell
[1:26:01] you it's something that I shared with
[1:26:03] the brothers in
[1:26:06] Colombia some time
[1:26:12] ago Phoenix when I first moved to
[1:26:18] Phoenix and I started helping out with
[1:26:20] the youth um
[1:26:25] not everything was going
[1:26:27] well in my mind I had quite the
[1:26:33] battle and so I asked myself what am I
[1:26:36] doing
[1:26:38] here why don't I go back to
[1:26:42] Iowa but one day my
[1:26:47] aunt you told me we have an appointment
[1:26:50] with brother Bernie
[1:26:54] me in my life I had never spoken with
[1:26:55] brother
[1:26:56] Bernie I heard stories
[1:27:02] testimonies and that's why I honor that
[1:27:06] man because he truly sacrificed his
[1:27:11] life so when my aunt told me
[1:27:14] that I said yeah I would like to go with
[1:27:16] you and so I
[1:27:19] went and one of my cousins went in first
[1:27:25] after her it was my
[1:27:28] turn truly when I went to
[1:27:32] him he was seated down on his chair or
[1:27:35] his
[1:27:39] cushion and by respect I I kneel down
[1:27:42] next to
[1:27:45] him and the words just came out of my
[1:27:51] mouth I told him brother Bernie well
[1:27:53] this that and the
[1:27:56] other and I I was
[1:27:59] crying because I was frustrated I was
[1:28:06] tired he told me well where are you at
[1:28:08] right
[1:28:11] now I'm with Pastor
[1:28:14] Montoya and he told me
[1:28:18] this he says you stay by his
[1:28:21] side
[1:28:22] and everything will be
[1:28:25] fine and
[1:28:29] truly the reason I'm here at this
[1:28:32] moment above all thank
[1:28:36] God but because of what he told
[1:28:39] me and I have the confidence and the
[1:28:43] faith that as long as I'm standing with
[1:28:45] my
[1:28:46] pastor everything will be
[1:28:50] fine may God bless each one of you
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:29:05] may God bless you
[1:29:11] Brothers God bless
[1:29:15] you it's good to be back in the house of
[1:29:17] the
[1:29:18] Lord it's good to be in your
[1:29:20] home it's good to go
[1:29:23] out don't think that it's
[1:29:27] easy I've mentioned it many
[1:29:30] times many clients that I have they send
[1:29:34] me
[1:29:36] texts they tell me are you working or
[1:29:38] are you out and
[1:29:39] about are you in the missionary
[1:29:42] field and then people come and the
[1:29:44] majority tell
[1:29:47] me they you they say you live a very
[1:29:49] exciting
[1:29:50] life
[1:29:52] they ask me where you going to go now
[1:29:54] which country you going to
[1:29:57] visit but there's a price that has to be
[1:30:00] paid one cannot explain to just
[1:30:04] everybody when you have a calling from
[1:30:08] God doesn't matter what you
[1:30:11] do you can't
[1:30:14] escape from what God does with each one
[1:30:17] of
[1:30:18] you one would want to run away like
[1:30:20] Jonah did
[1:30:23] but obedience is better than
[1:30:26] sacrifice and I want you to
[1:30:28] know that each time that we
[1:30:32] go each one of you comes along with
[1:30:37] us we go representing each one of
[1:30:41] you and the people truly appreciate
[1:30:46] that talk about the
[1:30:50] pictures I get excited and I just start
[1:30:53] speaking and I get
[1:30:55] nowhere I love the word of
[1:30:58] God I like to study the word of
[1:31:03] God and I believe that it's something
[1:31:05] that since I was a
[1:31:06] child I've always wanted to
[1:31:09] know I wanted to have
[1:31:12] knowledge but what's the knowledge that
[1:31:14] I wanted to
[1:31:15] know I want to know more about
[1:31:20] God that's why I devote my
[1:31:22] life to study
[1:31:25] messages to listen and know more each
[1:31:30] time not to know more than somebody
[1:31:34] else but to satisfy the need that I have
[1:31:37] inside of
[1:31:39] me and I thank each one of you for your
[1:31:43] prayers if it weren't for those
[1:31:47] prayers where would we be
[1:31:50] today
[1:31:52] as our brother baristo
[1:31:55] said I would like for him to stand up
[1:31:57] once
[1:31:58] again I would like you to
[1:32:01] know that he's not just any young
[1:32:05] man these times that we've gone to
[1:32:08] colia he's a very Exemplar young man
[1:32:12] repeat it once
[1:32:14] again we have the best
[1:32:19] Brothers of Applause once again
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:32:28] I would also like you to know that he is
[1:32:31] single you already know what I'm
[1:32:33] referring
[1:32:35] to but he knows that I appreciate him
[1:32:37] that I love
[1:32:38] him that's why I do what I
[1:32:42] do I told him you know if I didn't care
[1:32:44] about you if I didn't like
[1:32:48] you the word would say I wouldn't even
[1:32:50] look at you
[1:32:53] but because I like
[1:32:55] you that's why I joke around with
[1:33:00] you and the brothers in colia are very
[1:33:04] grateful that the Lord allows us to
[1:33:09] go that our pastor has a certain Vision
[1:33:12] to take certain
[1:33:15] people the brother struggle a bit with
[1:33:19] finances the dollar goes up and it goes
[1:33:21] down
[1:33:23] if you think it's difficult in
[1:33:27] Mexico the majority here think that it's
[1:33:29] difficult in
[1:33:33] Mexico right now in colia it's about
[1:33:35] 4,000 Colombian pesos per
[1:33:38] dollar so the effort that they make to
[1:33:42] assist or
[1:33:45] attend because surely the seat of God is
[1:33:47] inside of
[1:33:49] them just as the seed is inside of of
[1:33:51] your
[1:33:55] heart so you feel that desire to be able
[1:33:57] to come to
[1:33:59] service when the brothers go and they
[1:34:02] rejoice when they hear our
[1:34:05] testimonies when they hear our
[1:34:11] pastor the message that he brings that
[1:34:13] is so
[1:34:16] powerful here even the brothers are
[1:34:18] outside now I want you to know
[1:34:22] if you could stop you for a moment I'll
[1:34:25] it right now in
[1:34:27] colia you are here
[1:34:31] cold right now they're in the middle of
[1:34:35] summer because on the other side of the
[1:34:38] Equator so right now is the worst time
[1:34:41] to go to
[1:34:43] Colombia because you're going without
[1:34:47] moving without doing any exercise like
[1:34:50] our brother baristo said
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:53] you begin to sweat all the way down to
[1:34:54] your feet just so that you have an idea
[1:34:58] so it's not
[1:35:00] easy but look at the people yet they're
[1:35:03] outside even they're outside with that
[1:35:06] humidity you see that small fan that was
[1:35:09] there that's all that they
[1:35:12] have because they want to hear the word
[1:35:15] of
[1:35:16] God so when you stand behind the
[1:35:19] pulpit and you say that love
[1:35:23] them they answer with an
[1:35:25] amen and so I tell the
[1:35:29] brothers I say you don't even have to
[1:35:31] tell
[1:35:33] me I feel with the smile that you
[1:35:36] give I feel that you love
[1:35:41] us brother Bernie in the message three
[1:35:43] CH of
[1:35:49] Grace he speaks about something that may
[1:35:51] have gone over our
[1:35:54] heads he says something so outstanding
[1:35:57] in the first
[1:35:58] part he says the
[1:36:01] following and when I say you will agree
[1:36:03] with me that he does say
[1:36:05] it he says the three stages of
[1:36:07] Grace he says it's something so
[1:36:11] simple he says but if it was a
[1:36:12] revelation inside of
[1:36:17] you will cause a revolution in the
[1:36:19] message of the hour
[1:36:22] with things so simple as
[1:36:26] these so that is what is happening here
[1:36:28] in
[1:36:30] colia it's happening that people are
[1:36:32] going back to
[1:36:34] church the seed that was
[1:36:39] planted praying for the people the
[1:36:41] people want to come
[1:36:44] back they want to know and they want to
[1:36:46] know more about
[1:36:47] God they want to receive their
[1:36:50] healing
[1:36:52] you know our pastor how he
[1:36:54] is when he prays for
[1:36:57] people he doesn't give
[1:37:00] 50% he doesn't give
[1:37:03] 80% those who have gone out with
[1:37:07] him for me he gives
[1:37:11] 110% because he wants people to receive
[1:37:14] their
[1:37:15] healing you know why we don't receive
[1:37:17] our
[1:37:19] healing is because sometimes we don't
[1:37:21] believe
[1:37:22] it but if you believe that it is for
[1:37:26] you simple you have to identify
[1:37:30] yourselfself knowing that it's not God's
[1:37:32] will for you to be
[1:37:34] sick because sometimes the devil wants
[1:37:36] us to
[1:37:40] doubt you did something wrong that's why
[1:37:42] you're going through
[1:37:44] this and just the scripture has multiple
[1:37:48] meanings even besides all of that
[1:37:51] it's not God's
[1:37:53] will that you would be
[1:37:56] sick you accept your
[1:37:59] healing you confess your wrong you
[1:38:03] surrender to God and he will give you
[1:38:05] what you
[1:38:06] need now this young
[1:38:09] man he asked for something so
[1:38:13] outstanding and that all of us I think
[1:38:15] will ask
[1:38:16] for he asked for a
[1:38:20] need
[1:38:22] knowing people Discerning the people he
[1:38:24] said he says what else do you want and
[1:38:27] he says it with a
[1:38:29] smile he says I want the Holy
[1:38:32] Spirit how many of you want the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit you know the reason why you
[1:38:38] desire the Holy
[1:38:40] Spirit the simple Act of you having that
[1:38:44] desire that it is for
[1:38:48] you sometimes we got to be a little
[1:38:50] self-centered
[1:38:52] it's not for my neighbor it's for
[1:38:54] me that's the way you have to or else
[1:38:58] you're not going to receive it you
[1:39:00] prepare yourself at the right
[1:39:04] moment the Holy Spirit would come inside
[1:39:06] of
[1:39:07] you and what desire more
[1:39:10] outstanding and people would
[1:39:13] come and they were receiving that which
[1:39:16] they were looking
[1:39:17] for and likewise this
[1:39:20] morning you came this
[1:39:23] morning perhaps only to listen to a
[1:39:27] report but God is touching your
[1:39:30] heart he knows your
[1:39:35] need he knows everything that you need
[1:39:37] he scrutinizes even to the most profound
[1:39:40] and even so in this morning if you
[1:39:43] believe
[1:39:44] it just as our brothers believe it over
[1:39:47] there then it means that it is for
[1:39:50] you
[1:39:55] so as I tell you the brothers come
[1:39:57] asking with all of their heart and they
[1:40:01] receive but with so much sacrifice that
[1:40:04] they do
[1:40:06] it and pardon me for saying it this way
[1:40:08] but we have
[1:40:10] here sometimes we have new
[1:40:13] cars and we don't want to
[1:40:18] come here there's brothers who come from
[1:40:20] other cities
[1:40:24] struggling staying in one place just to
[1:40:26] be able to attend the
[1:40:27] services and without air
[1:40:31] condition imagine I told you just
[1:40:33] without even
[1:40:34] moving you already start to
[1:40:37] sweat now can you imagine to go sweat to
[1:40:40] a
[1:40:42] place so the sacrifice that they
[1:40:48] make will reward each one of their
[1:40:50] sacrif
[1:40:52] God does not keep anything for
[1:40:56] himself each time that you surrender
[1:40:58] your
[1:40:59] heart when you surrender your
[1:41:01] life when you surrender your
[1:41:04] time when you surrender your
[1:41:06] money God gives it back and rewards
[1:41:11] you and now before I go a little bit
[1:41:13] more
[1:41:14] forward here where we were on in a
[1:41:16] service on
[1:41:18] Thursday the offering was pass pass by I
[1:41:21] have said it
[1:41:24] before but maybe perhaps this will help
[1:41:27] somebody
[1:41:28] else and I took out for my
[1:41:30] offering and all I had was a $20
[1:41:34] bill and I said well God that's it I
[1:41:37] might as well do
[1:41:40] it I'm G brother
[1:41:44] who which pocket I have it in I don't
[1:41:46] want to reach the wrong one he takes out
[1:41:48] the
[1:41:49] 20 That Dying
[1:41:52] devil that's the way we are
[1:41:55] sometimes we grasp
[1:41:57] on struggle a lot with
[1:42:01] money but it's not even ours it's
[1:42:06] God it belongs to the bank have you not
[1:42:08] seen what it says on
[1:42:10] there so I gave the bill the
[1:42:13] money and I said Lord you know and it
[1:42:16] didn't weigh upon me I just gave money
[1:42:19] and when I left from here
[1:42:23] a person came I need my my my car and I
[1:42:25] need to fix
[1:42:29] it I said I'm not going to fix it I need
[1:42:32] you to go get it and pick open up the
[1:42:33] shop and go pick it
[1:42:35] up and because he's somebody that I know
[1:42:37] I said well I'll go do it so I went I
[1:42:42] open I didn't do any work for it I
[1:42:44] didn't even charge him he took
[1:42:48] it he says well for your B here and he
[1:42:51] gave me exactly
[1:42:53] $0 that's the way God is at your time
[1:42:55] you give your
[1:42:57] money God would give it back to each one
[1:43:00] of that's why he rewards our brothers
[1:43:04] here the brothers are so happy each time
[1:43:07] that one
[1:43:09] goes to receive a blessing on behalf of
[1:43:14] God so it's the same for you if you want
[1:43:16] a
[1:43:19] blessing
[1:43:21] if if you in your conscience the
[1:43:23] scripture says your conscience does not
[1:43:24] condemn
[1:43:25] you then you ask what you need
[1:43:29] believing and God will give it to
[1:43:32] you so God wants to unite the
[1:43:35] families you know what
[1:43:37] our here came this
[1:43:40] family they asked that they want to
[1:43:42] unite
[1:43:44] more and God honors his
[1:43:48] word and just to finish up
[1:43:53] I can say a
[1:43:55] lot and you say well brother you say the
[1:43:58] same
[1:44:01] thing but brother it's like when you
[1:44:03] look at a
[1:44:05] pictureis Gate Bridge here's a picture
[1:44:07] of the Golden Gate
[1:44:09] Bridge how many have gone
[1:44:13] there and those who haven't gone you can
[1:44:15] look at the picture and you say oh it's
[1:44:17] so
[1:44:19] beautiful
[1:44:21] but when you finally go to that
[1:44:24] place and then you
[1:44:27] experience the reality of
[1:44:30] things that's the same thing on the
[1:44:32] missionary
[1:44:37] field you can appreciate the love that
[1:44:39] they have
[1:44:41] for the love that our pastor has for the
[1:44:43] missionary
[1:44:46] field that is why sometimes I even
[1:44:48] bother my own family
[1:44:51] I say look at this picture look at this
[1:44:53] brother say it's just you again with the
[1:44:55] same old
[1:44:57] things when there's something inside of
[1:44:59] your
[1:45:00] heart here look how happy the people
[1:45:03] are in the
[1:45:07] Heat and even just being there just to
[1:45:10] be with the
[1:45:12] brothers you want to share that
[1:45:14] happiness with
[1:45:15] everyone and when it's within your
[1:45:19] heart
[1:45:22] I tell the brothers you would like to
[1:45:24] give that experience to your children so
[1:45:26] that they wouldn't
[1:45:29] suff everybody has to go through their
[1:45:31] own
[1:45:34] experience so it's the same way when you
[1:45:36] have something inside of your heart you
[1:45:39] want to share it with
[1:45:42] everybody and it's the same way with the
[1:45:46] gospel and to finish identified myself I
[1:45:48] have this small testimony or else I'll
[1:45:51] never finish you already know
[1:45:55] me I told my brothers out of all them
[1:45:57] I'm the quietest
[1:45:58] one see you laugh that's CU you don't
[1:46:01] believe
[1:46:02] me but people sure know how to provoke
[1:46:06] me they provoke me to
[1:46:09] speak serious in real
[1:46:12] life so speaking with my
[1:46:16] brother besides sharing the missionary
[1:46:19] field with him
[1:46:22] you create a stronger friendship with
[1:46:24] your
[1:46:29] brothers and so I identify myself plenty
[1:46:31] with the life of our brother
[1:46:33] MOS and with each one of the ones who
[1:46:35] have
[1:46:37] gone and so we got there and he was
[1:46:39] telling me phoenixon he said look
[1:46:43] brother from Phoenix to Houston it's
[1:46:44] three
[1:46:46] hourson it's a it's three hours then you
[1:46:48] wait a couple of hours in Houston
[1:46:50] Houston
[1:46:52] and from Houston to B it's five
[1:46:55] hours and then from to it's an
[1:47:00] hour so then you have time to speak with
[1:47:02] your
[1:47:04] brothers came he would tell me look when
[1:47:06] I was a young man I used to see brother
[1:47:10] Bernie and I would begin to
[1:47:15] pray I would cry now and say Lord I see
[1:47:17] how the servant of
[1:47:19] God how he struggles with his
[1:47:22] needs Lord take away my
[1:47:25] needs and give them to the Servants of
[1:47:29] God so he can continue to spread the
[1:47:32] gospel when he would tell me
[1:47:35] that I began to
[1:47:38] cry because I thought what young man
[1:47:41] does
[1:47:43] that and that's exactly what I had in my
[1:47:47] heart I know that he is the servant of
[1:47:50] God
[1:47:51] to give him my
[1:47:53] virtue so he can continue spreading the
[1:47:57] gospel you know what God showed
[1:47:59] me you did give it to
[1:48:03] me that's why you're still with the
[1:48:05] ministry of the
[1:48:07] apost and that's why we are happy
[1:48:10] Brothers we might not be
[1:48:12] much but what we do we do it out of our
[1:48:18] heart we with what our
[1:48:22] messenger what the seventh angel
[1:48:24] brought what the Apostle
[1:48:28] brought what our pastor B has
[1:48:31] brought and that is the reason why we
[1:48:34] go I want you to know that it's not easy
[1:48:38] you
[1:48:40] suffer but even so we do it because
[1:48:42] there is a
[1:48:44] reward and that's why we give thanks to
[1:48:47] God may God bless you Brothers
[1:48:58] God bless you
[1:49:00] Brothers It's a privilege for
[1:49:02] me to be here before
[1:49:06] you and GRE you in the fres name of Lord
[1:49:08] Jesus
[1:49:10] Christ truly for me
[1:49:13] Brothers it's a great
[1:49:17] privilege something that in my life I
[1:49:19] had never thought
[1:49:21] about that I would be with brother Monto
[1:49:25] with
[1:49:25] brother and with other brothers that for
[1:49:29] me they are the
[1:49:32] maximum sometimes I feel like the
[1:49:35] smallest I am the one who fetches stuff
[1:49:39] no the one that runs away the one that
[1:49:41] runs
[1:49:45] away like I said like my brother said
[1:49:47] like
[1:49:49] Jonah he ran or wanted to run
[1:49:53] away many times that's how I have felt
[1:49:55] in my life but I have learned to trust
[1:49:59] in
[1:50:01] God because he has a plan and a purpose
[1:50:03] for each one of his
[1:50:06] children there's many things that we
[1:50:08] sometimes don't
[1:50:09] understand but God is working with each
[1:50:11] one of
[1:50:12] us when we look
[1:50:15] back and we look at our
[1:50:17] lives we see the hand of God
[1:50:21] that always protected us did not
[1:50:26] allow for us to cre to make too many
[1:50:31] mistakes where we wouldn't be able to be
[1:50:34] here because I
[1:50:36] believe just as brother brandham tells
[1:50:38] the
[1:50:39] story when he was a young
[1:50:42] boy and a couple young boys
[1:50:45] be he went and got his father's rifle he
[1:50:48] waited for them
[1:50:50] he says which one of you wants to die
[1:50:53] first but God would not allow
[1:50:56] that for him to become a
[1:50:59] murderer so he
[1:51:01] shot 16
[1:51:04] shots and nothing came
[1:51:07] out later he picked up the
[1:51:10] shells back in the
[1:51:12] rifle and he shot at a
[1:51:15] tree and each bullet shot
[1:51:18] out that's the way
[1:51:20] that God has taken care of us each one
[1:51:23] of
[1:51:24] us because there is a job or work that
[1:51:27] we have to
[1:51:28] do there's a purpose that we will
[1:51:33] unravel and when you share testimony
[1:51:35] with your
[1:51:36] brothers we
[1:51:39] realize that we are on the same
[1:51:42] boat that we're on the same
[1:51:46] path and God is working with each one of
[1:51:49] us
[1:51:50] and truly
[1:51:53] Brothers it gives us healing to have
[1:51:57] Fellowship now I can understand that
[1:51:59] more than
[1:52:01] ever important it is to have fellowship
[1:52:04] with our
[1:52:05] brothers because where is
[1:52:09] God many may say well God is in
[1:52:13] heaven or he's here or he's
[1:52:16] there but right now where is God
[1:52:20] in the heart of man in my
[1:52:23] brother and if I want to speak with
[1:52:27] God then simply speak with your
[1:52:30] brother and have fellowship with
[1:52:32] them and I believe with all of my heart
[1:52:36] brothers that that is what God wants to
[1:52:38] have with each one of us is to have that
[1:52:42] Fellowship but us like brother brandham
[1:52:45] says we are Our Own Worst
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:48] Enemy it's not our
[1:52:51] couple it's not our
[1:52:53] children it's not the
[1:52:55] neighbor it's
[1:52:59] oneself because the fight we're fighting
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:03] nowadays it's not against flesh or
[1:53:10] blood evil spirits of
[1:53:12] Darkness that are surrounding us and
[1:53:16] they're waiting for
[1:53:17] us for you to let your guard down just a
[1:53:19] little
[1:53:21] bit I realize that the devil is very
[1:53:24] fast he does not
[1:53:28] wait he's always watching the Bible says
[1:53:30] like a roaring
[1:53:33] lion waiting for you to just let your
[1:53:35] guard down so that he can come
[1:53:39] in but God is working with his
[1:53:44] people I believe with all of my
[1:53:48] heart part of the Bride of of our Lord
[1:53:50] Jesus Christ and for
[1:53:56] me and throughout the year I was talking
[1:53:58] to them in sabana
[1:54:01] Tores last year which was
[1:54:05] 2023 it was a very difficult year for
[1:54:08] the Munos
[1:54:10] family you know about my son with
[1:54:14] cancer but now I can
[1:54:17] see of how good God is with
[1:54:21] because he gives
[1:54:22] us what we
[1:54:24] need and sometimes those
[1:54:27] trials are to place
[1:54:30] us it's like the
[1:54:33] hammer God is creating a
[1:54:36] masterpiece and he gets the hammer and
[1:54:38] the
[1:54:39] pick and he begins to Chisel that
[1:54:42] rock and those trials hurt
[1:54:46] sometimes we hurting we ask God why me
[1:54:50] but God knows what he's doing because
[1:54:53] that
[1:54:54] trial it would place you in your
[1:54:58] position it will place you where you
[1:55:00] have to be and
[1:55:03] truly it's a privilege for
[1:55:06] me to be able to be next to this
[1:55:09] [Music]
[1:55:11] man there's many people who don't know
[1:55:13] who he
[1:55:16] is now I can understand that by
[1:55:18] revelation
[1:55:20] that's why Lord Jesus Christ asked apost
[1:55:23] who says who who does man say I
[1:55:26] am even themselves they ask themselves
[1:55:29] who is this
[1:55:31] man but God gives each one their
[1:55:35] Revelation he was the son of
[1:55:39] God so sometimes we look at our
[1:55:42] mistakes as
[1:55:44] humans we all make
[1:55:47] mistakes the beautiful part
[1:55:50] is knowing this message and being able
[1:55:53] to
[1:55:54] know that we have an advocate the Bible
[1:55:58] says that if we've committed
[1:56:00] sin and we confess
[1:56:04] it he just and righteous to
[1:56:06] forgive and that is the
[1:56:10] key that's why the Bible says that a
[1:56:12] Christian cannot
[1:56:13] sin you cannot
[1:56:16] sin because when you recognize you've
[1:56:18] made a mistake
[1:56:20] you
[1:56:21] repent and you say Lord forgive me I did
[1:56:24] not want to do
[1:56:26] it brother Bram
[1:56:28] says at that moment the blood of Jesus
[1:56:31] Christ it forgives you it cleanses
[1:56:35] you it says if you have never done
[1:56:38] it and if you do it
[1:56:40] again that same
[1:56:42] day you repent once again he will
[1:56:46] forgive you once
[1:56:48] again and it's as if it would have been
[1:56:51] the first time you did it that is how
[1:56:53] God
[1:56:54] is that's how the blood of Jesus
[1:56:57] Christ it has power to
[1:57:02] annihilate just as the ink falls in the
[1:57:06] bleach it dissolves
[1:57:09] completely when we confess our
[1:57:12] sins he just and loyal to
[1:57:17] forgive this is the second time
[1:57:20] that I get to go to
[1:57:23] Colombia the first time that I went with
[1:57:25] my
[1:57:26] pastor I had gotten
[1:57:29] sick I was still a little bit sick while
[1:57:31] I was over but on this occasion I felt
[1:57:35] very
[1:57:38] good and we truly had a good time in the
[1:57:41] Lord now I understand brother
[1:57:45] Bernie how he says that he loves the
[1:57:48] youth
[1:57:50] there is strength in the
[1:57:52] youth he says if I could get the wisdom
[1:57:55] of the old
[1:57:56] one and the strength of the young
[1:58:00] one says then we could take over the
[1:58:03] whole
[1:58:05] world truly there's a lot of strength in
[1:58:07] the
[1:58:12] youth it's very beautiful when they
[1:58:13] dedicate and surrender their life at a
[1:58:15] young
[1:58:16] age I have told my testimony many
[1:58:20] times when I was 13 years old I got
[1:58:24] baptized I wanted to serve the Lord
[1:58:25] Jesus Christ with all my
[1:58:27] heart but then came the
[1:58:30] trials many times the
[1:58:35] Devil he's a good
[1:58:38] adversary he knows how to approach
[1:58:40] us he knows our
[1:58:43] weaknesses there's sometime he knows us
[1:58:46] better than we know ourselves
[1:58:50] and in this time that we live
[1:58:53] in it's the time brother Bram says he
[1:58:56] says it's the most difficult time he
[1:58:59] it's the most deceiving
[1:59:02] time the most difficult time to live
[1:59:06] in but it's also the most glorious
[1:59:10] time because all the
[1:59:13] Mysteries all that was hidden throughout
[1:59:15] the
[1:59:17] ages has been revealed at this time
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:21] and the
[1:59:23] youth for me they're very
[1:59:27] special because I remember when I was
[1:59:29] speaking with our brother
[1:59:32] evaristo when you have a Sunday school
[1:59:35] teacher that
[1:59:38] person there's an impact on that young
[1:59:42] person for me it was brother
[1:59:45] kuo and the book that he would teach on
[1:59:48] was the seven
[1:59:50] seals and the Seven Church
[1:59:54] ages that was our book of
[1:59:57] material and that's why I will never
[2:00:00] forget what he would show
[2:00:03] us it made a great impact in our
[2:00:06] lives but I also
[2:00:12] understand says you can know the Bible
[2:00:14] from cover to
[2:00:17] cover but it's not so much knowing it's
[2:00:20] good to
[2:00:22] know but we have to
[2:00:25] believe we have to have
[2:00:28] faith we have to believe that this is
[2:00:30] for
[2:00:32] us we have to know who we
[2:00:36] are this time is very
[2:00:40] deceitful and I would ask myself why is
[2:00:42] it so
[2:00:43] [Music]
[2:00:44] deceiving why is it such a deceitful
[2:00:48] time
[2:00:52] Brothers it says because there's many
[2:00:54] denominations there's thousands of
[2:00:56] thousand of
[2:00:59] Rel and they all claim to
[2:01:02] have claim to have the
[2:01:06] truth but brother Bernie tells us in a
[2:01:12] tape takes us to Matthew where it
[2:01:15] says I'll read it
[2:01:17] quickly but I tell
[2:01:21] love thy
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:24] enemy bless those who curse
[2:01:29] you do good to them that hate
[2:01:35] you and do those who are against
[2:01:38] you and who and who persecute
[2:01:41] us truly
[2:01:44] brothers that's the most
[2:01:46] important to have the love of God God
[2:01:51] brother says nobody will go
[2:01:53] beyond we won't reach beyond
[2:01:57] that because nothing can enter that
[2:01:59] place
[2:02:01] but if we have something against our or
[2:02:04] our
[2:02:05] sister Now's the Time to
[2:02:09] M go
[2:02:10] that something against your
[2:02:14] brother free of all those
[2:02:17] things because that's the
[2:02:20] seal that's the love of God that agapo
[2:02:25] love that love where I don't care what
[2:02:27] they've said about me I love you because
[2:02:31] you're my brother you're my sister and I
[2:02:34] don't
[2:02:36] care what you've said about
[2:02:38] me or forgive me if I've said something
[2:02:41] about
[2:02:43] you but we have to mend it at this
[2:02:47] time we're living in a dangerous
[2:02:51] time I got to speak a little bit about
[2:02:55] LA and truly
[2:02:58] Brothers we know that we live
[2:03:00] here but we're not of
[2:03:03] laa there's an open
[2:03:06] door between Philadelphia and
[2:03:09] laa that is the
[2:03:12] door brother Bernie says that door is
[2:03:15] open and what does that
[2:03:17] mean it's where you can enter in but now
[2:03:21] I
[2:03:22] understand that you have to make your
[2:03:26] decision you have to take that
[2:03:30] decision you have to decide who you're
[2:03:34] going to
[2:03:36] serve because God is a
[2:03:38] gentleman and he's not going to force
[2:03:41] us he is waiting on
[2:03:44] you he was waiting on
[2:03:46] me until I decided one day
[2:03:50] I'm tired of running away I'm
[2:03:55] tired because I remember my mother used
[2:03:57] to tell
[2:03:59] me thank God for our
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:04] mothers because I realized it's the
[2:04:06] closest thing we have to the love of
[2:04:09] God and she said son doesn't matter
[2:04:11] where you go if you go to the Moon I'll
[2:04:15] bring you
[2:04:16] down if you get under the Rock there I
[2:04:20] will find
[2:04:23] you there's no place where we can hide
[2:04:25] from
[2:04:26] God we're naked before
[2:04:30] him let's come forward with our
[2:04:32] surrendered
[2:04:35] heart and surrender our life to our Lord
[2:04:37] Jesus
[2:04:38] Christ because he wants to use our
[2:04:41] hands he wants to use your
[2:04:46] lips he wants to use it to hug that
[2:04:48] person who needs a
[2:04:49] hug to give him words of
[2:04:52] encouragement whoever needs those words
[2:04:54] of
[2:04:56] encouragement that is God through
[2:05:00] you he can't do anything if he does it
[2:05:03] not through
[2:05:05] man so God wants
[2:05:08] men that are
[2:05:10] preparing and who are
[2:05:12] prepared and who are willing to leave it
[2:05:16] all behind to follow him
[2:05:22] and I myself sign myself up on that
[2:05:27] list I know God has more to give us than
[2:05:31] what we could ask
[2:05:33] for what need do you have
[2:05:36] brother what need could you have this
[2:05:39] morning when he already
[2:05:42] paid you already did everything for
[2:05:45] us healing is inside of
[2:05:49] salvation already given it to you it's
[2:05:51] free accept it this
[2:05:53] morning because it's for
[2:05:55] us will be
[2:05:58] a has been
[2:06:00] preached to the Bride of our Lord Jesus
[2:06:05] Christ difficult to live this
[2:06:08] message there will be a group of
[2:06:11] people who can't live
[2:06:14] it doesn't matter what
[2:06:16] happens but they will be there on that
[2:06:19] day and if there will be
[2:06:22] one you will say I am he if there's two
[2:06:26] and I'm one of them there's three and I
[2:06:29] am one of
[2:06:31] them you have to believe it that you are
[2:06:35] one of
[2:06:36] them because it's by faith and it's by
[2:06:42] Revelation because God has called out a
[2:06:44] very special people at this
[2:06:47] time and we have to live a life clean
[2:06:52] pure without blemish and without
[2:06:57] wrinkle and nowadays God is calling a
[2:07:03] people in colia Pastor belan was telling
[2:07:10] us and the many of the brothers that
[2:07:11] went to the services that we had at
[2:07:14] church it's the second or the third
[2:07:17] generation
[2:07:21] of brother Jose Alvarez of the group
[2:07:22] that he had
[2:07:25] there many of those young families that
[2:07:27] you see
[2:07:29] there are the
[2:07:33] grandchildren of many sisters that were
[2:07:35] there with
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:38] brother God is bringing them all
[2:07:41] together to those
[2:07:46] families and bring them once again to
[2:07:48] the feet of our Lord Jesus
[2:07:51] Christ because no one will escape from
[2:07:53] his
[2:07:56] hand I want to finish with this brother
[2:07:59] Montoya many years
[2:08:03] ago when I was more lost in
[2:08:06] drugs I heard a
[2:08:09] message it's called in the hands of the
[2:08:12] original
[2:08:14] owner perhaps this will help somebody
[2:08:17] else because many
[2:08:20] times we hear that the devil has the
[2:08:22] right
[2:08:23] to because of this
[2:08:26] flesh to give us a hit in our
[2:08:30] life when I was more
[2:08:33] lost I heard the message through a
[2:08:36] tape and when I
[2:08:39] realize that Devil's time has run
[2:08:42] out I said I am
[2:08:46] free he has just a little a little bit
[2:08:48] of
[2:08:49] time to try to destroy
[2:08:53] you to try to do the most that he can
[2:08:56] with
[2:08:57] you but then his time runs out then he
[2:09:01] has to let go of
[2:09:03] you and when I realized
[2:09:05] that that his time had run
[2:09:08] out could be free at that
[2:09:11] moment I struggled enough in my
[2:09:16] life me the freedom at that
[2:09:19] time because by faith I accepted it and
[2:09:22] if the
[2:09:23] devil so devil your time is
[2:09:26] over you try to destroy me you try to
[2:09:30] kill
[2:09:31] me but your time is
[2:09:33] over and he has to let you
[2:09:37] go I don't care the trial that you may
[2:09:39] be going
[2:09:40] through doesn't matter how difficult it
[2:09:44] looks time the devil has gone
[2:09:47] out to let go of
[2:09:49] you he no longer has any power over
[2:09:53] you now all that we have to do is
[2:09:57] believe accept him and
[2:10:01] know that you're a child of
[2:10:04] God that's the most beautiful
[2:10:09] thing knowing that we are a special
[2:10:13] family it happens to me the same way
[2:10:16] when I've gone to Peru I see these
