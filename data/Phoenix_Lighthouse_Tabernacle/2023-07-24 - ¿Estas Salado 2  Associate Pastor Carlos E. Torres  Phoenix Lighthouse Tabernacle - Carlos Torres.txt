[Music] it's the church where it's unveiled El Mysterio that had been hidden throughout time in that stage or that age where God sends an angel but now this book according to Revelations it's open in the hands of the Angels so now John has a conversation John is trying to have this conversation and the angel is showing Johnson then the time that we live we can no longer be Idols you have to get into action yes Revelation 10. it's a conjunction of principles the prophet says talking about this age wretched we've mentioned before that wretched means that comes from the etymology this is its roots in Greek which means we stand and trial a person that is [Music] a person that is to a blessed Christian in the time of Trials while he's going through the test Anton says so then the prophet says it doesn't mean that there is that we are sons of God will not determine that would live from the Romans that would deliver them and give them a better way to do things the religious rituals they left them from the gods the Roman oppression a depressed there was no exit for that people there was no way that they could do things right the situation in which they found themselves in Paris for them it was a miserable situation but then comes largest Christ and he begins because you cry you are blessed because you have had thirst and hunger you are blessed because you would be quenched at the end of the sermon he says Rejoice what is because great is our reward in the heavens so Jesus begins I elevation to a higher um atmosphere situation they found themselves and begin to elevate them to another atmosphere to another level because we always know this one problem it can't be solved at the same level in which it was created we want to solve it you have to go to a higher level so when Jesus begins to tell them [Music] are blessed and when he's giving them the beauty tutes he Compares him in verse 13 to salt salt it was something very valuable the word celery comes from the word salt because in that time they were paid the Roman soldiers it was with salts there was one called the Salt Tree which is where the salt was transported it was so important it was a salt road which is where the the salt was transported the Bible tells us in Ezra 7 22. this is at The Treasure of the king had uh salt without measures it mentions many things and among those things is salt you are valuable solos you feel alone you are the salt of the earth they knew how important and now Jesus tells them ye are the thoughts of the earth you have a lot of value the salt they even provoked Wars Jesus so Jesus was trying to change their attitude about themselves because you thirst and hunger foreign the keys the keys the blessings now he began to speak to them you're not only the salts of the earth you're the light of the world only gives certain rights to the Pharisees totally and Jesus says I have not come to remove the Lord came to change the law but rather fulfilling the Fulfillment of the law was in the Lord Jesus Christ so then Jesus was trying to change the way in which they thought he began to change their attitude giving them values when he gave him the value that they had Allah in Heavens he told him about um Muslim a charity this is anxiety and he told them his door [Music] doesn't speak like the Pharisees no no so people were admiring his Doctrine foreign it wasn't just for the Pharisees adoration can be restored be present for the pardon of our sins what was the way to entrance were the principles that we had to activate to activate and the authority this Kingdom has that's what Jesus was teaching so when Jesus speaks about the salt uh we focus a little bit on this aware we begin to see that salts it has natural uses it says ye are the salt of the earth significance spiritual meaning behind salt it's necessary for us too the natural elements in the way they're applied spiritually speaking do you understand why Jesus said he or the salts of the Earth in that time one of the most important characteristics of this element is it stops with the composition of a food is being important to the life of men that's why in the time important to the Roman Empire they could preserve their meats and their fish it was very relevant in economic and social aspect Ed they had a great interest in commercial use for having these qualities it was a good seasoning it was a preserver is it causes thirst and it also has medicinal properties as medicinal properties and let's see each one of these salt as seasoning ye are the salt of the earth is flour tortillas but they taste even better with flour tortillas yes how many have eaten beans without salt they taste bad looks one of the things I remember most about my childhood of food that I ate that I can remember the most it was a bowl of beef with flour tortillas in a really hot coffee it stayed in my mind that's something I remember and my mouth begins to water foreign [Music] [Music] now you have a really good dish is getting hungry so then salt gives good flavor Nosotros we have to understand that salt as seasoning it gives a good flavor it has to pass through fire so it gives that flavor to the food the beans have to be hot beans with the perfect temperature 49 sorry for everyone shall be salted and every sacrifice shall be salted salt is good but if the salt has lost it work with ye seasoning have salt in yourselves not only to be salted foreign that's when you have to add the flavor foreign [Music] [Music] has but the trial does not mean that God is [Music] all our lives you know can you imagine before God this doesn't have salts now how does God react when our life has no flavor and why doesn't our life have any flavor because the trials and the battles come you know and we don't want to face them we feel defeated we feel that God doesn't listen to me to share his blood foreign amen I want to say I am the salt of the earth that means so what's going on in my life when I bring my sacrifice to church it should be based on emotions or feelings no sir today I don't feel like singing glory to God that's what the song says man amen we have to give glory to God pick that song and turn it into a personal experience and when we are salted we give flavor to our life we also give flavor to the life of others let's give them a little bit of flavor in their life give a little bit of thoughts we're gonna give him some salt we gave him a little bit of salt expectations it says God is those who bring flavor to the world the strength in the church the strength in the church it comes when we put flavor we add flavor to our life we have flavor in our life we give flavor to the world and that strengthens the church that strengthens the church Hermanos we'll be talking with the ushers [Music] so when somebody goes into those doors they can come like this that means that they're lacking salt so if the one at the door is salted brother I'm happy to see you the prophet says for some people that is the greatest blessing that they will receive perception that will change all their perceptions there was a contact with the spirit of the other person which woke them up and now the musicians are salted they're going to enter into the presence of the Lord and they're not going to say what am I going to play right now no they will be prepared they're going to be salted the spirit of God will begin to move and one who is the Holy Spirit right away because someone who assaulted is bringing a sacrifice and believe me when you say something I don't know if you've ever done that yourself if you're a little saltier salted you identify the taste it is foreign as well yes brother [Music] of the fight show me who I am and where I'm standing foreign what do I go but there's something else the scripture says that salt is it becomes insipid salts it can become insipid or Bland the word insipid it's lack of flavor it doesn't have the taste that it should have or it could have you see I wanna in another allegoric way is lack of spirit lack of liveliness or lack of Grace that's an insipid person that has projected they have turned into an insipid person and God calls him because they have not maintained himself firm we say brother well I failed well the blood Jesus Christ is the person that gives up is the person that stops trying to talk about talking about Thomas Abba Edison when he finally found what he was looking for how to light up how to bring that electricity and to light up through that bulb the Son of God that is they never give up they never give up I wish I once again later they will hit that Target the problem is for you soon firm on the word of God when a person becomes insipid in their spiritual life what captures them is a spirit of bitterness the word of God says in Hebrews 12 15. okay to be diligent unless any man fail of the grace of God unless any root of bitterness bringing up trouble the root of bitterness comes from a disappointment of an unfulfilled promise many times we blame God because there's been a promise that has not been fulfilled many times we blame the people who are out we make constant excuses to justify our current situation the husband makes an excuse for why he acts a certain way towards his wife the wife makes excuses to why she acts a certain way towards her husband this boy foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] you don't want to open up our hearts here so that God May perform surgery [Music] God is looking for you God wants to change [Music] and give us the blessings but we push him back in order to do that we have to change the way we do things because we have materials it has nothing to do with your spiritual life [Music] your spiritual life could be dry [Music] and God can fulfill it today and give you the strength we are the salts of the Earth because I take the word and nothing will move one way or the other let it sit and have coffee until you answer my prayers I believe it he can do it today again we it's a Covenant of Grace [Music] it's an unconditional Covenant let us prayer heads raise your hands there where you find yourself Lord Jesus Christ is present [Music] he wants to give us our hearts desire s he wants to come and heal your wounds want to come and help you understand [Music] why you have gone through what you've gone through everything but it's time to make a decision it's a trend it's Transcendent decision that will change the course of your life will open the windows of Heaven until you're over abundance of bring spiritual blessings but it's only decision that you have to make let us elevate a prayer to God and he performed a surgery in our heart at this time Lord Jesus Christ we lift our hands towards you say that we are the salts father many times we don't feel that foreign [Music] we want to do your will Lord Jesus operation you remove that take away the incomprehension for my life that's what we most desire we love you thank you for listening help us to put this word into actions thank you for listening to our prayers we're in your hands the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen thank you Lord God bless you guys
