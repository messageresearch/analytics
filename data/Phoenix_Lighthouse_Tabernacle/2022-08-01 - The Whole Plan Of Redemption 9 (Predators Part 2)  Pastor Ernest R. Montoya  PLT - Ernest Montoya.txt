[Music] m [Music] [Music] amen [Music] god bless you it's good to be in the house of the lord just looking at individuals and thinking everything i have to do and say [Music] be inspired by the word of god we're happy today um one of the things that i do understand is that there's many many people that are feeling ill both spiritually spiritual and physically efficient it's no no burden noskarga that we see people going to hospitals because of what's going on worldwide we came back from peru still do not believe that there's a pandemic government in peru so peru is doing uh some good peru to avoid uh an outbreak of the pandemic again if you didn't know that i like to travel california california they were going to pass a law you want to pass an alley [Music] you need to wear masks again somehow for whatever reason it was defeated but californians relax with this pandemic they believe christians believe those christians not only message believers but i'm saying in general christians believe that god protector and i can say amen so with that i want to start this this message finished today i know that for a fact i have too many notes but what i have noticed is i'm trying to give the ministry here time to preach the gospel there are some individuals that i haven't been able to put behind the pulpit the person just like individuals everybody has to be ready and the world is going to go by us i can feed myself so i need the ministry to make sure that they're always constantly hearing the messages so that when it's their turn to come up they're not going to get nervous the first thing we forget is the order of the order of this church and i try to establish that wherever i go i talk to a pastor the first thing i say the pastors [Music] we always have to remember we put more time to the message the word of god rather than singing by now you should have it memorized hebrews 9 11. the whole plan of redemption a hidden predator 11 but christ being come and high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building is neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us or if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh significantly how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve a living god heavenly father we're grateful this morning for our blessings the bible says he purged our conscience from dead works to serve a living god in other words so my questions turned out a little different god should be with you if he's not then we need to talk how many of us have been anointed by a spirit raise your hand i mean there's good spirits and then there's spirits that you don't want around you yes don't raise your hand how many of you have been around a person with an unclean spirit yeah don't raise your hand want you to remember one thing many people that have unclean spirits that they've relaxed so much they want to stay that way they don't want to now the church of the living god like let's say those people has to be born again in other words it's an individual affair again but the church itself has to be born again we need to be born again hardest thing to do and convince a person as a church because you're anchored in god's word how many of us want to overcome and follow christ don't we all want us if it's not peace in my mind peace in my heart peace in my home he said my work there's something wrong and i've got to overcome that i'm going to use myself as an example this way i'm no one can say he was pointing at me or is saying it to me for me i gotta let you know that there's some individuals whatever purpose and justification i can't go any further they won't they just haven't found their home they're not in contrast how do we resist evil if i want to overcome a spirit how do i resist it i gotta find in the message if i'm a junkie should i be hanging around with that group should i hang around with that group if you want to overcome that spirit you gotta resist those individuals you gotta stay away from them i gotta stay away from those cigarettes so the individuals that'll give me a cigarette because the more i hang around with people that's i'm going to be anointed sooner or later temperance and it just starts temple a simple thing it's an act we start acting differently you don't have that desire anymore because something happened well then i speak to pastors wherever i go what has this pandemic done to the bride of christ and the 10 individuals pastors different pastors pastors medicine they all come up with the same thing and that's why i'm gearing to this message we're having a prayer meeting nobody wants to come nothing could have been maybe two individuals this is what they tell me look at medicine we come to church on sunday and wednesday night iglesias there's only 10 people on sunday morning there's five people on wednesday night tell me what's going on one of the presidents i forgot his name i know you know and i know i know you'll say but he's he had this expression as not no problem don't ask me what you can do show me what you want to do for god we gotta get back to the abc's i'm always believing christ otherwise spirit el espirito is going to grab us and it's not going to let us go nobody and what he does a tracker none of you okay where's the phone do you have a phone you know this traxxy if it doesn't there's something wrong with your cell phone wherever you go yeah whatever you do you go to a barber shop guess what it's going to attract you to where estrella go a barber shop if you go to ranch market is that what it's called if you go to ranch market guess what's going to come out here it's tracking you know now have you ever tracked somebody let me tell you how you track them the new phones that come out now i don't trust my wife you know confirm i don't trust her so i'm gonna put it on there so we have to attract my wife and it's gonna show me where she's at it's gonna show me how much money she's spent on augusta so i'm tracking everything she does i know for a fact you are the tracker gustave we said before did you find god or god found you where did he find you don't control you know what let me just put it how he found me i was foolish i was living disobedient to my parents i didn't know god but i know one thing every time i got into a a car i drove i'd pick up my friends amigos and they would deceive me nobody had money nintendo they didn't have money for gas holiness they didn't have money for whatever we drank it deceived me i was foolish i should have known better they're not my friends they squat in your car they're waiting for you to open your wallet well guess what i was a slave to pleasure you don't but many of us are slaves we're slaves we're prisoners the pleasures of the world all right let's bring it back danny where's that good looking phone that i dropped you better leave it here so i can take it with me see who you're really tracking i'm sorry i just and it opened up a page you know this is danny i'm danny this is eli i'm trying to look for sister moreno so this is first of all danny danny is really something you look at danny's colorful socks but you know danny is not only a good guy that he knows and he takes this pleasure and every day when i see him when i tell him he's going to speak he's like his mouth is his uh smile drops you know but then i'll see him see you right now see you smile that guy's actually smiling right now look at his eyes so then i'm telling myself well what does danny doing that i need to do okay so i can put a smile on my face so he'll do this and then he'll look down he's my co-worker over here me company this little girl soninha oh i i know i saw your sister hiding back there so he's like with his daughter he's like okay give it a rest 20 minutes later he has the video they don't be

they're relating again i was a young kid you know holmen and spend more time and look at chinese people you know planet eyes people still on me why because the spirit anointed me i hate them i was trained to hate you i had so much malice in me foreign man with man man with man women with women you can't tell the difference anymore i don't know what they're called cross dressers or whatever they're called oh i'm sorry we don't know anything about that right now well why not my wife when i used to date her cuando esconda go with us we can go here and there and party so i would call her up in those days we didn't have a cell phone we didn't even have we had a superman phone telephone superman do you know what a superman phone what a superman phone is crazy you'd close the door so nobody would hear something came up at home i'll go salute any of you are going to do status wickedness i mean i was not wicked i was so wicked i'm going to tell you an incident that happened to me i must like i said i wasn't a christian then cristiano but i had wicked plans college plans marriage plans buying a new home plan getting a new job plan we all have plans i drove a sports car i was 23 years old i carried a 45 between my legs so one day i saw a person of a different color he was with a girl they were laughing and all that having a good old time you see i was a predator predator or someone and what i was looking for was a weak vessel a predator will always look for a weak vessel for example donald trump for example donald trump a predator he said something he called me uh something with my back i look on my spot so i made a u-turn tina you come on why we need to resist and then we can overcome it doesn't it know what spirit so when this person when they i said what'd you call me give me the history and he said it right in my face i was like i was able to put the forty-five not knowing any of innocent people it never went off the lady or the girl ran this person that i had drops and he started running and i said this is not happening to me so i went like this we have see put it in the air and it is it was a predator 1978 full of spirits at night it would be real to me they would come after me don't tell me nobody goes dead but you can't tell me he isn't all right really so i went to church it was a wednesday night and one of the elders comes up to me one of the lasagnas being at me and he tells god showed me what's wrong with you go with me into the church we're going to pray i could have done one or two things you have a lime spirit you sold discord have you done it right you'll stand the discord is there the discord and i said i can pray for you and the first thing you do is you're lying to me don't have nothing nothing going on there's nothing wrong with me over here but okay i went with the brother hermano and he told me this is who's after you nobody knew nothing i had malaria i had malaria malaria when he prayed everything left i needed it he this is where brothers live in africa in africa start taking pictures and they started talking about me maybe you're a teenager you live with your parents how would you like to live in a home like this if you're renting if you're in an apartment would you like to have a home was there her son was sick with syphilis and the first thing brother branham looks at the floor i'm sorry and he knew it was a christian home christian if brother brennan was here brother branham was here who would you want to pray for you this person is a persona or this person who would you take a queen tomorrow would you take him out i because he knew she was a genuine christian i'm just letting you know the bible says they'll lay hands on the sec and i love the quotes that i have because it's like this happened to me and brother branham said the following he goes overcome means concerning i've even brought a bag full of his tricks but brother branham goes on yeah and he says a lot of people think that there's no devil diablo brother branham goes on there's a real devil he's just as real as you are yes anybody a real devil who's been born again then then to overcome and you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier let me say it again i'm born again god is in me do you understand me and he's greater mightier than the devil and where is foreign one that it's in you that has already overcome him one that's in you el castano has already overcome him malignant i tell lies and then i think that i can walk the devil you're wrong you can't whip no the point he's gonna get you said again once we recognize that it's the devil diablo and we recognize what you just gotta believe it you gotta believe it but you don't need that stuff anymore yeah can you say man this is what brother branham said he called him out the trackers i don't know who this guy is tracking something i guess this person is wearing glasses so it must have been 2006. this is a safari in africa in africa [Music] [Music] you know the bb will go this way it'll go down by the time it so i took shots and he said okay you're ready stanley's too many person with me he looked at him he says you're not so we went must have been three four o'clock in the afternoon we killed a warhog and then the strangest thing happened to me i mean i was a good shot you know this is the first thing i do is boom and he didn't go down so i asked the brother i put my sights and it's going to go for water when we run who do we run and the word of god says for water but we don't do that we feel everything going bad in my home and mikasa too many tribulations how many of you go through tribulations let me say something here they were complaining they were poverty-stricken they had taken all they had they built a little church like this is and being that they were such a little bitty group they pushed them out looks like a big church had just smothered them out you know that's what happens we're small species pray together stay together together they go from house to house in casa who was saul was he bitten well put it this way it was taller than this okay the ceiling here he was seven foot tall brother brothers and he was uh in the military in come over here joe bin joe this will take a minute i'm almost done i want you to stand next to hillary clinton i'm by me chatting over here what do you think we should look like okay yes he's tall he has to defend us yes or no yes he should be educated this is what brother branham said hello that's the king they first looked at him yes thank you they were going from synagogue to synagogues i'm sorry i i i lost my thoughts i'm sorry i'm an oldies i'm sorry hold on this guy called jesus when the king i want you to stand up look at your brother or sister

moses one day woke up right brother branham says he was told to do anything he was ready to be taken away by the angels but god was still with him how dare anyone come again try to take a pastor out of his office because you want someone tall okay good luck and young that our mind plays tricks we gotta recognize that a person take a person out of his position that's anti-christ it's santi cristo
