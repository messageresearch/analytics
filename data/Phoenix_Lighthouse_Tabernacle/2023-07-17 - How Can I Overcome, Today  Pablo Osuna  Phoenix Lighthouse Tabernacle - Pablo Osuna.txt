the same way how can I overcome today Revelations chapter 3 verse 20. behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me in Sutra 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in history then I'm here with the spirit saith unto the churches let me take your seats these scriptures we just read some parties are part of a longer text um Revelations dedicated to the Lord in which we believe we've been taught during these times so one can say that these words are dedicated to us he was criticized foreign [Music] a very feasible situation he elected Abraham's Island where he was very comfortable when to follow the lord and he was able to overcome Isaac after Isaac came Jacob and Jacob his name was changed to Israel okay which means fighting with God he the the Israel and from Israel Jacob the Israel the 12 tribes of Israel tribes from the tribe in terms of Moses who's a very famous story that many of us know we know how Moses went to Egyptians he freed the people that were in slavery and once he let him out of Egypt the Lord was with them and they were able to overcome we have many examples how they were able to overcome the time of Moses comes the time of the great Joshua and the sister would like to focus on this evening Josue in the time of the great Joshua this is the time that comes immediately after yes after Moses dies and from there Lord gives a commission to Joshua after the death of Moses the first chapter Lord gives Joshua a vision tells him that um foreign something and it's your part they eat to go and take it and remember we're speaking how can we overcome today as the Lord tells Joshua the way I was with Moses this is part of the commission if the Lord we'll continue with the first chapter of Joshua Josue Joshua 1 9. if it turns to we'll have it here on our screen I put it on my in Josue Joshua 1 9. it's a very well known scripture maybe in different homes they have it on the wall you see it in Social places so this is part of Joshua's commission fear notes made Joshua orders the people of Israel to prepare themselves they have the land with God has promised us and the people of Israel see now that Josh was the electorate ladies ladies they tell him okay were you ever sent it where you sent us will you tell us this is the people of Israel telling Joshua is where Joshua starts going up for the promised land Josue and Joshua gets two spies and sends them to Jericho is these two spies and find himself next to the wall the Jericho the wall of Jericho there was a woman who was there and they entered there is people have gone here from the people of Israel oh and she says she had hit them on the roof these two spies once the soldiers left they were searching foreign um of War you will March towards the city he is and before them foreign foreign the Lord tells Joshua this day Israel I will begin to enlarge your name before all of Israel and God gives the order to Joshua Deke to cross the Jordan River he they walked across the Jordan River you can tell them how can we go overcome today and in chapter five because they had been in the desert for 40 years and the Lord tells Joshua yeah after he had done that with the new generation tells him yeah continue continues on his way and in that way he finds himself brother Branham says that he was alone he was walking alone and suddenly looked up and there was a man before him he says foreign yes and tells him what happened Road and corrects makes right this mistakes and the battle comes and they were about to be victorious quick quote here I was going to read but also uh James Garcia our brother James Garcia we know my brother Jimmy is here at the lighthouse on the first of March of 2020. and tells us the the the the battle we fight today in the spirituals are the physical battles that they fought so the battles that Joshua fought in the natural spiritualist or the spiritual battles we fight today the battles that Joshua physically the spiritual battles they were fighting remember yes how can we overcome today we've seen plus examples Through the Bible how they will overcome is that they were able to place God first hear the word of Joshua and Joshua and this is going to come forward we're
