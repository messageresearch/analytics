[59:39] Brothers It's pleasure to be here this
[59:44] evening the nice weather we have
[59:48] today give thanks to God for all the
[59:50] things he gives us
[59:57] take advantage of time be so kind we can
[59:58] open up our
[1:00:02] Bibles going to our base scripture in
[1:00:04] the Book of
[1:00:08] Genesis amen when you have you canate
[1:00:10] with an amen
[1:00:14] amen the beginning God created the
[1:00:16] Heaven and the Earth
[1:00:28] and the Earth was th formed in void and
[1:00:30] the Darkness was upon the face of the
[1:00:31] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:00:32] the face of the
[1:00:37] waters and God said let there be light
[1:00:39] and there was
[1:00:52] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:00:54] good and God divided the light from the
[1:00:55] darkness and God called the light day
[1:00:57] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:00:58] evening and the morning were the first
[1:01:14] day and God said let the Earth bring
[1:01:16] forth grass the herb yielding seed and
[1:01:17] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[1:01:19] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:01:21] Earth and there was so
[1:01:27] now like to read another scripture in
[1:01:29] John
[1:01:38] 367 John 36 says that which is born of
[1:01:41] flesh is flesh and that which is born of
[1:01:43] the spirit is
[1:01:49] Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee
[1:01:52] ye must be born again let us pray
[1:01:55] brother
[1:01:57] Heavenly
[1:01:59] Father Here we are Lord in this
[1:02:02] evening father I have always
[1:02:05] said I don't believe in
[1:02:08] coincidence I believe you have control
[1:02:10] of all
[1:02:12] things you already saw this
[1:02:15] scene for the foundation of the world
[1:02:19] father here
[1:02:24] tonight you know the heart of each one
[1:02:26] of us
[1:02:28] father you know the need that's inside
[1:02:30] of each Heart Holy
[1:02:31] Father so this night
[1:02:33] Lord bring myself aside
[1:02:36] father and may you be able to
[1:02:39] speak those words of
[1:02:42] life that only you can
[1:02:45] give each Heart Holy
[1:02:47] Father put ourselves in your hands
[1:02:50] father and we ask all of
[1:02:53] it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:57] amen you may take your seats
[1:02:59] Brothers I'd like to thank my
[1:03:02] pastor for the
[1:03:05] opportunity for the trust that he gives
[1:03:08] me to be here behind this Pulpit
[1:03:13] uh it's something that's not very easy
[1:03:15] to
[1:03:18] do even though the body does its due
[1:03:21] diligence it gets
[1:03:24] nervous because not something very
[1:03:27] simple I know that even brother Bernie
[1:03:32] says we know that all the messages all
[1:03:34] the Mysteries were already
[1:03:37] declared there's no new message that we
[1:03:39] can receive we are the
[1:03:42] echo we only
[1:03:45] repeat which was what was already
[1:03:48] said because in
[1:03:51] repetition lies the revelation
[1:03:57] that's what we do on these
[1:03:59] days when we come to
[1:04:01] church it's to
[1:04:06] share of the much that God has given
[1:04:10] us he is a good
[1:04:12] god he takes care of his
[1:04:15] children he knows the needs that we have
[1:04:19] he is the father and as a
[1:04:23] father we want to give the best to our
[1:04:25] children
[1:04:26] children it's the same
[1:04:30] thing now I'd like to speak this
[1:04:33] night a little bit on the new
[1:04:37] birth listening to the tapes of
[1:04:40] adoption we
[1:04:43] realize that many
[1:04:47] times the devil we know that he is a
[1:04:49] good
[1:04:51] adversary he knows exactly how to
[1:04:53] approach
[1:04:54] us and many times
[1:04:57] Brothers he knows who we
[1:05:03] are but the one that has like the new
[1:05:06] birth he makes you think that you don't
[1:05:08] have
[1:05:09] it and the one who doesn't have
[1:05:12] it he tells him you're good you already
[1:05:16] have
[1:05:18] it this is the most deceiving age that
[1:05:20] there
[1:05:23] is because the devil the devil the Bible
[1:05:26] says that he's consistently as a roaring
[1:05:27] line he's not
[1:05:31] resting he's after each one of
[1:05:35] us and we also have to have our guard
[1:05:40] up brother said there's a battle going
[1:05:43] on these
[1:05:44] days the greatest battle ever
[1:05:47] fought it's here in our
[1:05:50] mind the Devil comes with all of his
[1:05:53] thoughts
[1:05:56] all the things are going around
[1:05:58] globally the
[1:06:02] news those applications our phones the
[1:06:06] notifications constantly we are being
[1:06:08] bombarded Brothers with
[1:06:12] information and then I
[1:06:17] realize the reason that the devil has us
[1:06:19] so busy or
[1:06:22] preoccupied because he doesn't want you
[1:06:24] to have a relationship with God
[1:06:28] grow with that yoke or that
[1:06:31] relationship to make it stronger with
[1:06:35] God and each time it's just taking or
[1:06:38] stealing time away from
[1:06:39] us that's his
[1:06:42] job sometimes he doesn't stop you from
[1:06:44] coming to
[1:06:46] church sometimes he lets you do what you
[1:06:48] have to do but at home at your
[1:06:52] job wherever you are
[1:06:57] that's where he is also working
[1:06:59] constantly trying to take your time
[1:07:04] away so you don't have a stronger
[1:07:06] relationship with our Lord Jesus
[1:07:10] Christ the tape of
[1:07:12] adoption brother Bernie
[1:07:15] says that when the people don't know
[1:07:17] their
[1:07:19] rights Satan stops you
[1:07:22] from getting what belongs to you
[1:07:28] he says the only way we can know our
[1:07:31] rights what belongs to
[1:07:33] us it's through his
[1:07:37] word we're not listening to his
[1:07:41] word then we don't know what belongs to
[1:07:44] us all those promises that God has given
[1:07:49] us we're not constantly listening to his
[1:07:51] word
[1:07:55] those promises that God has for
[1:07:57] us the new
[1:07:59] birth you have to ask for it you have to
[1:08:03] desire
[1:08:04] it before I used to
[1:08:06] think that God would come
[1:08:09] down I I was expecting a
[1:08:12] light the way that I thought about it
[1:08:15] God will appear when the time is
[1:08:18] right but that's not the way it
[1:08:23] is God has his way of doing
[1:08:27] and he uses
[1:08:29] man man is God's
[1:08:33] agent that's why this message is
[1:08:37] preached it says by the craziness of the
[1:08:40] preach it's something
[1:08:43] crazy but it's the way that God
[1:08:46] chose to speak to his
[1:08:50] people that's why we come to preach the
[1:08:52] gospel
[1:08:56] go out throughout the world and preach
[1:08:58] the
[1:08:59] gospel because that's the way
[1:09:02] Brothers when the word
[1:09:04] comes when that water
[1:09:07] comes we are that Earth that
[1:09:11] land and that is already planted
[1:09:14] here but when that water comes and it
[1:09:17] Waters
[1:09:19] it a process of ger
[1:09:24] germanization I like what brother bam
[1:09:26] says about
[1:09:28] it but I'd like to give the definition
[1:09:30] of
[1:09:37] germination says the development of a
[1:09:40] plant from a seed or sport after a
[1:09:42] period of
[1:09:47] dorcy brother bam in his message called
[1:09:49] a spiritual
[1:09:51] Amnesia you know brothers that we are
[1:09:53] eternal
[1:09:56] tells us in
[1:09:57] job where were
[1:09:59] you where were you
[1:10:02] brother when he's laying down the
[1:10:05] foundation where were
[1:10:08] you now we come to this earth and we
[1:10:11] don't
[1:10:13] remember because of that Amnesia that we
[1:10:16] have but one
[1:10:18] day a word
[1:10:20] came and through an
[1:10:23] angel and told us you're not a chicken
[1:10:26] you're you're you're you're an
[1:10:29] eagle and he spoke to us in a
[1:10:32] language we were able to hear that
[1:10:35] word and there's something inside of us
[1:10:38] that began to light
[1:10:40] live it quickened inside of
[1:10:43] us it's not because I wanted
[1:10:46] it the Bible says that you don't search
[1:10:48] for
[1:10:50] God God's looking searching for you
[1:10:55] the seed was dispersed throughout the
[1:10:58] world that's why brother goes throughout
[1:11:00] different parts of the
[1:11:02] world and preaches the
[1:11:06] gospel the children of God are
[1:11:08] throughout different parts of the
[1:11:11] world it's not our job to know who it is
[1:11:13] and who
[1:11:15] isn't our job to judge our brothers or
[1:11:18] our
[1:11:19] sisters my job is to preach the
[1:11:23] gospel tell them that God sent a mess
[1:11:26] for this
[1:11:27] age time that we are living
[1:11:30] in because there's many people Brothers
[1:11:33] around the
[1:11:34] world they think that they
[1:11:37] are that they are
[1:11:39] Christian or they're part of the
[1:11:42] bride and they don't even know the
[1:11:46] messenger and truly
[1:11:49] Brothers this is the most deceitful
[1:11:53] age lately I was talking to my
[1:11:57] brother I'm I'm studying a fox book of
[1:12:00] Martyrs the Two
[1:12:04] Babylons and I realize how the Catholic
[1:12:08] Church how it's gotten inside
[1:12:14] completely and right now there's a large
[1:12:15] movement if you haven't
[1:12:17] noticed the Catholic Church here in the
[1:12:19] United
[1:12:21] States and we know that that Spirit
[1:12:23] coming is coming once again
[1:12:28] a spirit where each one of us are going
[1:12:29] to be
[1:12:30] persecuted but the bride
[1:12:33] Brothers the bride will not be
[1:12:37] pers the bride will be raptured before
[1:12:39] that
[1:12:40] tribulation he has given us an Escape
[1:12:44] Route we have to study and
[1:12:47] know and be ready and
[1:12:50] prepared looking at the
[1:12:53] token looking at the time that we're
[1:12:55] living
[1:12:57] in because it's a very deceitful
[1:13:01] time now brother Bernie
[1:13:05] says he says the new
[1:13:10] birth there's a difference between
[1:13:12] adoption and the new
[1:13:14] birth many like the natural
[1:13:17] one a child when he is
[1:13:20] born you may ask him did you are you
[1:13:24] already born he doesn't
[1:13:27] know simply because he's a child or he's
[1:13:30] a
[1:13:31] baby now that child has to
[1:13:36] grow and through listening to the word
[1:13:38] of
[1:13:42] God through watering that spirit and
[1:13:44] that seed inside of his heart he begins
[1:13:46] to grow and begins to
[1:13:52] develop because got that spirit of God
[1:13:55] has given us that food that
[1:13:56] we that spiritual
[1:14:00] food that's why Jesus said man shall not
[1:14:02] live on bread
[1:14:04] alone but of all word that proceeded out
[1:14:06] the mouth of
[1:14:07] God but the devil
[1:14:10] brother he is a good
[1:14:13] adversary he makes us
[1:14:15] believe that you have not been born
[1:14:17] again
[1:14:19] yet and that's where he has is look what
[1:14:21] you did the other
[1:14:23] day look what mistake you made over here
[1:14:26] look at the lie you told over here look
[1:14:29] at this look at
[1:14:32] that and now we're saying oh Lord I
[1:14:34] haven't been born
[1:14:37] again when you've already been
[1:14:40] born but as a child when he begins to
[1:14:43] walk he makes mistakes he
[1:14:47] falls but he gets back
[1:14:50] up that is a Christian says brother
[1:14:54] brandham a Christian can
[1:14:56] fall he can make a
[1:14:58] mistake but he gets back
[1:15:02] up through that walking he begins to
[1:15:05] escalate he begins to increase his faith
[1:15:09] that virtue that patience that
[1:15:13] knowledge that Godly love that Brotherly
[1:15:20] Love begin to grow in those seven stages
[1:15:22] of the PID the perfect man the stat of a
[1:15:26] perfect
[1:15:27] man but brother Bernie
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:32] says that even in every stage we still
[1:15:34] fall and far of growing we
[1:15:37] fail we
[1:15:41] fall and we say Lord well I haven't been
[1:15:43] born
[1:15:44] again but you have already been born
[1:15:49] again so you start all over again you
[1:15:51] get back
[1:15:52] up and you start once
[1:15:55] again and God is just the Bible
[1:16:00] says that we confess our
[1:16:03] sins when we make a
[1:16:05] mistake and we say
[1:16:07] Lord help
[1:16:09] me I didn't want to do
[1:16:14] this but he helps
[1:16:17] us and he helps us to move forward and
[1:16:20] he forgives
[1:16:22] us he gives us one more opportunity
[1:16:26] how many want another
[1:16:29] opportunity I've had many
[1:16:32] opportunities and I give thanks to God
[1:16:34] for his
[1:16:35] blood because through that
[1:16:38] blood he has cleansed me he has washed
[1:16:42] me and he justifies
[1:16:45] us and what is
[1:16:48] justification it's as if you've never
[1:16:50] done
[1:16:51] it but that's for the bride
[1:16:58] you know you can imagine a bride without
[1:17:00] stain or
[1:17:03] blemish because her priz was purchased
[1:17:06] by the with the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:11] Christ but through each New Birth you
[1:17:13] have to have an experience with the
[1:17:17] Lord but for there to be a new
[1:17:20] birth there has to be a death if there's
[1:17:24] no death
[1:17:26] there can't be
[1:17:29] life the grain is buried brother
[1:17:32] says he says the word
[1:17:34] baptism is to submerge or
[1:17:39] bury so God baptize us with his holy
[1:17:42] spirit but in order for him to give us
[1:17:44] that new
[1:17:45] bir give us the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:48] Spirit we have to die die to what to our
[1:17:53] own ideas
[1:17:55] our
[1:17:55] thoughts to our way of
[1:18:02] believing and let God has his full will
[1:18:06] in our
[1:18:08] lives now brother Bernie
[1:18:12] says the person has to desire the
[1:18:18] adoption he says if the person does not
[1:18:20] desire
[1:18:22] it then they can't receive
[1:18:25] it then now I realize
[1:18:28] Brothers when God gave to
[1:18:31] Joshua he says be
[1:18:34] brave he says all this land it's
[1:18:38] yours to fight for every single inch of
[1:18:41] it the holy spirit is yours
[1:18:45] tonight you have to fight for it you
[1:18:48] have to desire
[1:18:49] it say Lord this is mine I claim in the
[1:18:53] name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:56] because he wants for you to ask for
[1:19:00] it I remember Brothers in an occasion
[1:19:02] when my wife got
[1:19:05] baptized I don't know how many remember
[1:19:07] but brother
[1:19:10] Berney it happened on a Sunday she got
[1:19:15] baptized and brother says I want you to
[1:19:17] come this Monday
[1:19:20] evening and I'm going to tell you how to
[1:19:22] receive the Holy Spirit
[1:19:26] I was speaking with my
[1:19:30] wife he says tell me so I can
[1:19:33] remember what is it that brother Bernie
[1:19:36] said it's so simple Brothers he said ask
[1:19:40] for it he said ask for it ask for it
[1:19:45] it's yours
[1:19:47] Brothers the word is
[1:19:50] simple it's not
[1:19:53] complicated you don't have to know so
[1:19:55] many
[1:19:57] things there's mysteries in this Bible
[1:20:00] but they've already been
[1:20:02] revealed the Bible says that if you want
[1:20:04] to know cry unto
[1:20:07] me and I will
[1:20:10] answer things that th knowest not and I
[1:20:13] will show
[1:20:17] thee but he is pleased to who he
[1:20:21] reveals he knows who he will give the
[1:20:24] reev
[1:20:26] to because many times brother Bernie
[1:20:29] says says the
[1:20:32] devil he makes us think that we haven't
[1:20:34] been born
[1:20:38] again he says he tries to fill that void
[1:20:41] with
[1:20:43] Revelations that's the way the devil
[1:20:46] is he is very
[1:20:51] deceitful if he's not of one way
[1:20:55] he's going to try another
[1:20:56] way he can give you a religious
[1:21:00] spirit and later you're in conflict with
[1:21:02] all your brother oh well I know more
[1:21:04] than you
[1:21:06] brother I can tell you about the
[1:21:08] 144,000 or about the Seven
[1:21:11] Seals or we can talk about many
[1:21:13] Ministries my
[1:21:15] brothers but you haven't even been born
[1:21:17] again
[1:21:21] yet the devil brother says says overcome
[1:21:26] is to recognize the devil in each one of
[1:21:28] his
[1:21:29] trips if we know how the enemy
[1:21:32] works then he can no longer do anything
[1:21:34] to us and when you
[1:21:37] recognize and when you know who you
[1:21:41] are you the blood of Lord Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ the reason that this world has
[1:21:47] not been
[1:21:49] destroyed because we are still here
[1:21:53] brother because the is still
[1:21:56] covering but when that blood is
[1:21:59] removed God's judgment will
[1:22:06] come and that lamb is still on the
[1:22:08] throne of
[1:22:10] sacrifice in the Throne of
[1:22:12] Mercy there's still
[1:22:15] blood but that
[1:22:17] sacrifice will turn into a
[1:22:21] lion it'll be the fury it will be a
[1:22:23] disaster
[1:22:26] now if you read that
[1:22:28] book in the fox book of
[1:22:32] Martyrs you will see how those
[1:22:34] men they used to give up their life they
[1:22:37] would burn
[1:22:39] them they would throw them into the
[1:22:48] lions says the the book says that the
[1:22:51] imagination of a human being in order to
[1:22:53] come up with ways to torture somebody
[1:22:54] hurt somebody it's
[1:22:58] crazy they would do the worst thing that
[1:23:00] you could even think
[1:23:03] of and just thinking of that that time
[1:23:05] will come once
[1:23:07] again but I give thanks to
[1:23:09] God that he sent a
[1:23:12] prophet that he sent a
[1:23:14] messenger and I didn't choose him he
[1:23:18] chose me he chose
[1:23:22] you you have to take that decision
[1:23:27] it's your
[1:23:28] decision it will determine your
[1:23:31] destiny he gave us free moral
[1:23:34] agency and the decision is inside of you
[1:23:38] if you
[1:23:39] accept and you're willing to
[1:23:42] die you're willing to leave it
[1:23:45] all to reach a point in your
[1:23:49] life there's no mother there's no father
[1:23:51] there's no daughter there's no son
[1:23:54] there's no work there's no money there's
[1:23:58] nothing all that matters is the Lord
[1:24:00] Jesus
[1:24:02] Christ when you're willing to give your
[1:24:04] life
[1:24:05] completely is when God can come
[1:24:08] down and conceal
[1:24:11] you and give you his holy
[1:24:14] spirit but we're always with these
[1:24:17] worries am not going to pay my
[1:24:19] rent I'm going to pay my car bill
[1:24:26] instruction that the devil always has
[1:24:27] bringing us here and there but the Bible
[1:24:31] says search the kingom person his
[1:24:34] righteousness all things will be added
[1:24:38] on but he is a father of
[1:24:41] God he knows the need that you
[1:24:44] have and he will give it to
[1:24:47] you because he is a good
[1:24:50] father and he knows what your need is
[1:24:54] he will never leave
[1:24:55] you he will never forsake
[1:24:58] you he said I will be with
[1:25:00] you even in you until the end of
[1:25:06] time to reach a point in our
[1:25:10] life where it has to be only
[1:25:13] him where it can long be what I want or
[1:25:17] what I dream of I want to have a house I
[1:25:21] want a ranch I want horses
[1:25:25] I want so many
[1:25:27] things first I want God in my
[1:25:31] life I know that he will give me all
[1:25:35] things when you place him in first
[1:25:38] place I can tell you this
[1:25:41] night he will bless you he will give
[1:25:46] you he will give you everything you've
[1:25:49] asked
[1:25:50] for because that's what his word says
[1:25:53] whatever you ask
[1:25:54] and you don't doubt it that's the way it
[1:25:57] will
[1:25:58] be so if you want the new birth it's
[1:26:01] yours
[1:26:02] tonight you want the
[1:26:04] adoption you want that seal it's yours
[1:26:08] tonight we have to desire you have to
[1:26:11] ask for it and you have to
[1:26:14] die so that God can come
[1:26:16] down and Quicken inside of you that
[1:26:21] spirit and that sea that can come up
[1:26:26] and then you can give
[1:26:28] fruits you'll be a a bountiful fruitful
[1:26:31] Tre where you can help your brother your
[1:26:35] sister whichever person that needs a
[1:26:39] hug what does brother
[1:26:43] say the world is dying for just an ounce
[1:26:45] of
[1:26:46] love we have
[1:26:50] family even us being from this message
[1:26:55] and sometimes we have so much
[1:26:59] work brother Bram throughout the message
[1:27:01] we can
[1:27:04] see that the Bride is a hardworking
[1:27:08] bride she doesn't stay there with her
[1:27:10] arms
[1:27:13] crossed brother Brown even gives the
[1:27:15] story of that
[1:27:16] cousin that she was
[1:27:21] hardworking the other young ladies got
[1:27:23] ready for the the man was
[1:27:25] coming the groom but she was
[1:27:28] working and when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:31] comes that's the character that he's
[1:27:33] looking
[1:27:34] for that's why I admire my pastor he
[1:27:38] goes out he's
[1:27:40] tired but he continues moving
[1:27:43] forward because when the groom
[1:27:46] comes he will find him
[1:27:49] working because that's the way the Bride
[1:27:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ is we don't
[1:27:53] have to go to
[1:27:54] far here we have
[1:27:57] family at home we have
[1:28:00] family wherever you go but brother
[1:28:04] Bernie
[1:28:04] says that with your
[1:28:07] life sometimes not even just with
[1:28:09] words you don't need
[1:28:12] words with your
[1:28:14] life you're preaching a
[1:28:16] message and that is what we
[1:28:19] want we make mistakes we're
[1:28:22] human we're still in this flesh
[1:28:26] but we have to have the Holy
[1:28:28] Spirit that places this
[1:28:31] flesh in
[1:28:33] submission when the
[1:28:35] inside the one inside is one that has
[1:28:38] control of the one on the
[1:28:41] outside not the one that outside
[1:28:43] controls the one on the inside but the
[1:28:45] one on the
[1:28:46] inside the Holy
[1:28:48] Spirit has
[1:28:50] control of what you are doing
[1:28:55] put more time or dedicate more time in
[1:28:57] the things of God and die what did Paul
[1:29:02] say I Die daily
[1:29:07] daily daily when you
[1:29:09] die there's a new
[1:29:14] birth after baptism after
[1:29:17] baptism wherever you find yourself in
[1:29:18] your car in your home at your
[1:29:23] job matter where you
[1:29:25] are you listen to the word of
[1:29:29] God and God is giving you a
[1:29:34] baptism he's giving you of his grace of
[1:29:37] his mercy of his
[1:29:40] love he's caring for
[1:29:42] you how many of us want this
[1:29:46] tonight and the time has gone
[1:29:49] by but I want to leave you with this
[1:29:54] brother Bernie says we have to reach a
[1:29:55] certain
[1:29:56] point where you're at the
[1:30:01] altar you're completely surrendered to
[1:30:05] God because he's not going to
[1:30:09] come if you still have your own
[1:30:12] thoughts you have to leave it
[1:30:15] all that let nothing matter
[1:30:19] any when you reach that point in your
[1:30:22] life when God that's when God can do the
[1:30:26] work but the work of the
[1:30:30] devil is to try to take that time
[1:30:34] away steal that
[1:30:37] opportunity and it's
[1:30:40] constant The Young Ones especially
[1:30:45] nowadays there's so many things on the
[1:30:48] internet this
[1:30:51] thing it's a door
[1:30:55] to the fourth
[1:30:57] dimension where all things everything
[1:31:00] bad comes
[1:31:01] from and if you have no
[1:31:04] control a
[1:31:06] notification Facebook then we're on
[1:31:09] Facebook or see whose birthday it
[1:31:13] is then later we're looking at a video
[1:31:15] that we shouldn't be looking
[1:31:18] at and there the devil is stealing
[1:31:21] time and one hour goes by
[1:31:25] brother it's happened to
[1:31:27] me I'm the first
[1:31:30] one it's only the time goes
[1:31:34] by when we couldn't even listen to a 30
[1:31:36] minute
[1:31:37] message then we make the excuse I don't
[1:31:41] have time I don't have
[1:31:44] time because something is taking our
[1:31:46] time away but
[1:31:49] nowadays let us wake
[1:31:52] up because we got to ask for God to come
[1:31:55] and take
[1:31:57] control of our
[1:32:00] Spirits so that he can have the
[1:32:02] preeminence in our lives please
[1:32:06] stand let us
[1:32:09] pray you have a need
[1:32:14] tonight I'm a witness and I'm standing
[1:32:16] here as a witness ask to
