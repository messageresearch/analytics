[37:28] [Music]
[37:39] foreign
[37:47] [Music]
[39:53] how can somebody be talking two to three
[39:55] hours in some place
[40:33] Genesis chapter 37 23-24.
[40:44] and he came to pass when Joseph was come
[40:46] unto his Brethren that they stripped
[40:47] Joseph out of his coat his coat of many
[40:49] colors that was on him
[40:56] and they took him and cast him into a
[40:59] pit and the pit was empty there was no
[41:01] water in it
[41:05] you may take your seats
[41:09] I'll be reading on the scripture which
[41:11] is
[41:12] Jonah chapter one verse one two three
[41:19] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[41:22] the son of amateur saying
[41:32] the great City and cry against it for
[41:34] the wickedness has come up before me is
[41:52] to flee from Tarsus from the presence of
[41:54] the Lord and went down to topam though
[41:56] he found a ship going to Tarsus so he
[41:58] paid the fare thereof and went down into
[42:00] it to go with them under Tarsus from the
[42:02] presence of the Lord foreign
[42:24] because he maketh intercessions for the
[42:27] Saints according to the will of God is
[42:34] [Music]
[42:36] and we know that all things work
[42:38] together for good to them that love God
[42:40] to them who are called according to his
[42:42] purpose
[42:52] and I just want to talk a little bit
[42:54] about what is the plan of God
[42:56] um
[42:59] one time I had to talk about the
[43:01] development of the enrollment of God's
[43:03] plan
[43:13] that God has done is doing or will do is
[43:16] perfect
[43:18] I think that's the best plan
[43:21] that God has made
[43:23] and because God made it it cannot fail
[43:27] any other plan can fail
[43:30] but when God has created a plan
[43:35] when he creates something asked to
[43:37] function perfectly
[43:40] so this morning I wanted to focus
[43:42] on the plan of God
[43:48] these two characters
[43:51] about Joseph and Jonah uh
[43:56] they were both in a very tremendous
[43:58] situation
[44:01] Joseph was in a pit or in a Hole uh
[44:05] he was in a pitiful situation
[44:11] was inside of that fish
[45:02] I'd like to talk a little bit about him
[45:39] how many of the characters
[45:46] I've seen the others have been a little
[45:48] bit more disobedient
[45:51] level they're both children of God
[46:13] foreign
[46:23] [Laughter]
[49:07] that's what's happening today
[49:12] by his foreign
[49:53] so when we see each one of their lives
[49:58] me personally I like to read about the
[50:00] story of Joseph about his life
[50:02] [Music]
[50:03] his entire life how it's going about
[50:08] when I reached the part when he's thrown
[50:10] inside of that pit
[50:12] something touched my heart
[50:17] so then he was in that pit at that time
[50:21] the Bible says that he was hated
[50:24] he was hated Without a Cause
[50:29] but he was in that pit this is
[50:35] his brother had attempted to kill him
[50:39] there I'd like to stay a little bit here
[50:41] on the pit
[50:45] because I believe that each one of us
[50:46] has fined ourselves in
[51:00] many times some have causes and others
[51:03] don't have causes as to why they're
[51:04] there and because
[51:08] I said I have a reason why I'm there
[51:15] people have gone through depression or
[51:17] through problems
[51:19] you say well if they're a good person
[51:25] God is taking care of those details
[51:42] about Jonah
[51:55] foreign
[52:55] Vienna and swallowed by a whale
[52:58] and then when the whales
[53:03] it went to the Bottom of the Sea to rest
[53:07] that's the way a fish does it when it is
[53:35] sometimes don't want to believe that
[53:39] but God had prepared this fish
[53:43] this was a different kind of whale
[53:48] God prepared this one to swallow
[53:53] so he it was a different fish fish
[53:56] Erman how tremendous
[54:24] [Music]
[54:51] how many of us have read in the Bible
[55:50] no one can
[55:54] run away
[55:56] from the things of God
[56:25] foreign uh
[56:37] [Applause]
[56:44] anytime one wants to treat join a
[56:46] certain way
[56:48] but he was actually falling into the
[56:51] purpose
[56:52] let me read this part this is
[56:58] the names of the people this is
[57:15] I
[57:31] um
[57:45] program
[58:52] [Music]
[58:56] to swallow him
[59:28] [Music]
[59:56] he always has a way to rescue foreign
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:01:02] from brothers or sisters
[1:01:21] he was rescuing a foreign
[1:02:14] perfectly land in there
[1:02:18] no they had a meeting inside of the ship
[1:02:20] okay
[1:02:45] someone here is wrong
[1:02:49] so they all cast their Lots
[1:03:02] when you know you're not doing things
[1:03:05] you know
[1:03:08] you can't fool yourself
[1:03:33] [Music]
[1:03:35] any other animals
[1:04:02] on the perfect plan of God
[1:04:05] escape from the plan of God
[1:04:09] said oh maybe I'm lost
[1:04:16] how am I gonna do it
[1:04:19] maybe there are so many questions
[1:04:38] even in the following conditions
[1:04:40] that is a tremendous that God has for us
[1:04:46] where'd you find yourself
[1:05:00] perfectly
[1:05:03] because no one can get lost from the
[1:05:06] plan of God
[1:05:07] that's why the seed has to come to life
[1:05:13] that's why it says that everything
[1:05:21] according to his purpose
[1:05:24] it doesn't matter Brothers
[1:05:30] here was that fish
[1:05:32] he was waiting for the son of God
[1:05:46] it was
[1:05:50] seed of God in him foreign
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:07:09] it's sad
[1:07:30] for the gospel
[1:07:34] sometimes God has somebody a person with
[1:07:36] a problem
[1:07:41] and that person wants to go and take
[1:07:43] that problem
[1:07:45] the prophet says
[1:07:52] one thing we can do is say God help him
[1:07:55] I can't take it away
[1:07:58] you'll be with them you guide him
[1:08:02] that's the only thing we can do for that
[1:08:05] brother
[1:08:06] here was Jonah
[1:08:09] so he fell in the belly of that whale
[1:08:12] he had all the time to think about it
[1:08:18] but there was no need
[1:08:21] because he had already confessed that it
[1:08:24] was him
[1:08:25] foreign
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:10:43] foreign
[1:11:09] he says that the whale was at the bottom
[1:11:11] of the ocean
[1:12:07] here we last one or two hours
[1:12:35] [Applause]
[1:13:09] but here was Jonah once again
[1:13:12] Belly of the whale
[1:13:26] so he worked
[1:13:29] and he would say okay that's enough
[1:13:38] says
[1:14:00] he walked out
[1:14:03] if he was bound from his hand his feet
[1:14:08] that God has for us
[1:14:37] to do foreign
[1:15:42] that's when people get closer to the
[1:15:44] feet of God
[1:15:47] my time
[1:15:55] don't give me more time
[1:16:14] talking about the pit look at me
[1:16:19] Jose let me talk a little bit about what
[1:16:21] he said about Joseph this is
[1:16:42] and it was considered that Jacob his own
[1:16:44] father thought that his son had been
[1:16:46] killed
[1:16:50] how difficult must have been for Joseph
[1:16:52] knowing he was born
[1:17:02] when they had killed him to eat it
[1:17:10] and he knowing all those things
[1:17:15] but Joseph could have one thing in mind
[1:17:19] that the hand of God was over him
[1:17:22] he knew that he was a believer
[1:17:29] how much lack of cooperation or any
[1:17:32] other thing
[1:17:34] Joseph knew that God would fulfill his
[1:17:36] words
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:18:03] he couldn't flee from the purpose
[1:18:07] interested foreign
[1:19:08] Garcia is a message by Brother Bernie
[1:19:12] he talks a little bit about Jonas
[1:19:16] and he calls out all of the negative
[1:19:18] traits about Jonah
[1:19:20] he's not calling out his defense
[1:19:23] he's calling out our defense
[1:19:29] over Renegades like Jonah
[1:19:33] God has the control to take that
[1:19:35] Renegade away from us
[1:19:41] God has the way to bring you back
[1:19:45] doesn't matter if you don't want to go
[1:19:49] one way or another God's going to send
[1:19:51] you to that place
[1:19:52] sometimes
[1:19:57] we make our plan
[1:20:02] like they say you tell God your plans
[1:20:05] you're going to make him laugh
[1:20:09] we say I'm going to do this I'm gonna do
[1:20:11] this
[1:20:13] I told my wife from now on I'm going to
[1:20:16] do things backwards so they come out
[1:20:18] right
[1:20:21] and they come out the other way around
[1:20:23] they never come out right foreign
[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:41] is that his name is Jim
[1:23:04] that a whale swallowed him he says yes
[1:23:07] sir
[1:23:34] well then you ask him do this
[1:23:38] so it doesn't matter Brothers
[1:24:00] I don't need a fight with anybody else
[1:24:03] simply as a little girl said
[1:24:06] when I find him I'll ask him
[1:24:12] that was the way to shut that man up
[1:24:17] yeah well I'll ask him over there
[1:24:21] well then you can ask him
[1:24:23] Lord
[1:25:19] you've given us up to this day
[1:25:23] thank you for your mercy
[1:25:26] [Music]

[1:25:31] once again before your presence
[1:25:36] how much we're still lacking in our
[1:25:38] lives

[1:25:43] and as that beautiful hymn says
[1:25:46] renew me Lord
[1:25:49] I don't want to be the same
[1:25:51] [Music]
