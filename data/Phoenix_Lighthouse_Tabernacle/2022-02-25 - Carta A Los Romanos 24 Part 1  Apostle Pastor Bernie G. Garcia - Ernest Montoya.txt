[Music] [Music] here [Music] [Music] [Music] the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of god let us pray to god [Music] lord how our soul innermost being just yearns to see the manifestation of the sun [Music] [Music] [Music] again [Music] play [Music] [Music] [Music] brother [Music] [Music] [Music] they're in a spirit [Music] his face [Music] with god we're in the letter to the romans this is message number 24. and we're in number four now in the subtitle the manifestation of the sons of god it's something very interesting that is if we're following all along on the teaching uh we you have trained us for such a long time now lord now father give us our ranks how many of you would like your rank uh trusting will be able to understand that what i'm trying to get across to you that each one of us has to understand get our rank and the word rank is a degree or position of dignity eminence or excellence so each one of us should get to a position or place a degree of position of dignity eminence or excellence is sometimes when i'm speaking the people pick up on something and they misunderstand it that they twisted or mislocated made the comment that we are not worms someone might take a quote scripture say throw it back and say well you are worms but now that worm has been transformed and is now a beautiful butterfly and to the fight i'm not worthy this man even the way he walked you could tell he was different from the rest of the slaves that was the man that wanted to buy him do you treat him better you feed him better you give him a better bet uh i used to is myself the same question so i found out that his daddy is a king back overseas dignity even the way a person behaves you can tell whether he feels himself worthy i believe in surrendering to god i uh yes so he says father give us our ranks eminence or excellence that's my prayers those are the three words that i gave you last time and i'd like to review them over concerning the words overbearing overpowering and overwhelming you take the word overpowering that takes you to a super being el salvador by the blood of god going to the bible says his righteous soul was vexed when he saw the abomination that were performed in the city but the messenger says it like this but he didn't i wasn't enough [Music] when there's something about that that's great just like the bible says i know it but if they did know it they would understand it in an understanding that would be part of the word it would be one with the word i believe there's at least 100 people here that were here [Music] about being born let's look at the next scripture colossians amen are we going to meet the lord jesus christ here on the earth isn't that soul brother i believe we should be a little bit further away we do not make jesus christ that the people in order for verse 26. even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his scene here we're speaking about the manifestation of the sons of god but there can be no manifestation to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of god corinthians the subject is the manifestation of the sons of god that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their passes unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation so the bible says god was in christ and he was reconciling the world unto himself that was he was calling to himself that's why no one can come into the foreign mighty god romans chapter 7. first one [Music] for i speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives for the woman who hasn't had husband is bound by the law to her husband what's the subject title of the song the manifestation of the sons of god come back for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father see we for the woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband now remember we were married while her husband lives she'd be married to another she shall be called an adulterer accept jesus is to be born again in the anyway but the word will draw out it's his people is where in time passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience every man born a woman born of a woman is right mentioned right here in paul's including himself also entered into also we all had our conversation in times past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desire of the flesh and of the mind and whereby nature the children of wrath even as others so here speaking about nature of husbands even when we we were dead and sins has quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved now let's go back to rome uh seven and five foreign wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god with christ just like he died i went to california verse for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death classes so there's two kinds of fruits fruit [Music] [Music] [Music] you
