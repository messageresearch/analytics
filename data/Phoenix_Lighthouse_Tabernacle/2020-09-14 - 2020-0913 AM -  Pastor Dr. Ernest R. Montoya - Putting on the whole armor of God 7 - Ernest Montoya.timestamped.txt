[15:10] members of phoenix lighthouse tabernacle
[15:14] presented
[15:20] wishing that each is well and is
[15:22] enjoying your health
[15:26] we understand that we are living in
[15:28] times that were prophesied
[15:30] in the sacred scriptures difficult times
[15:32] that have affected our daily life as we
[15:34] know it
[15:38] foreign
[15:43] the pandemic that has hit the entire
[15:45] world has caused preventive measures
[15:47] to be taken to maintain the health of
[15:49] each member of this church
[15:50] for whom i am responsible
[16:02] these measures have been based on the
[16:04] statistics and regulations
[16:06] issued by the state government in the
[16:08] same way we have kept abreast of the
[16:10] local and national news
[16:12] medias
[16:20] locales we have heard that the cases of
[16:23] infected individuals have decreased
[16:29] but we have also heard that certain
[16:31] numbers have been manipulated
[16:33] and not all the new cases that have
[16:35] emerged have been reported
[16:44] seeing the numbers of infections
[16:46] increasing and hearing so much
[16:48] contradictory information
[16:49] is the reason why i have kept the church
[16:51] closed for all this time
[17:02] is
[17:05] always keeping in mind the welfare of
[17:07] each and every one of you
[17:11] some of you might ask when are we going
[17:13] to go back to church
[17:18] all i can say for now is don't dismay
[17:20] and stay true
[17:22] everything is in the hands of god
[17:29] we will keep you informed and when the
[17:30] day comes it will be a pleasure to
[17:32] announce the date
[17:33] that we can return to church to worship
[17:35] the sweet name
[17:36] of the lord jesus christ together

[28:56] and then it destroys
[29:24] it's all a mind matter
[29:27] there's a rage that goes on
[29:31] it's a spiritual rage
[29:34] that's here let me say it over again
[29:37] it's a spiritual race
[29:50] it's so full of rage
[30:20] the battle is raging to destroy us
[30:25] destroy our family destroy the church
[30:28] destroy a loved one destroy the very
[30:33] message that we believe
[30:48] our heavenly father we're grateful for
[30:49] this blessing this morning
[30:53] we thank you because you've been good to
[30:56] us
[30:57] you've given us a message that we could
[31:00] be proud of
[31:02] you gave
[31:16] but this battle rages on
[31:19] trying to destroy us but all we have
[31:24] the only weapon we need
[31:27] is your word this morning we're so happy
[31:30] for that
[31:32] we ask that you bless each person bless
[31:34] your families
[31:36] bless their efforts
[31:39] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[31:42] amen amen
[31:44] if we'll go to our scripture
[31:48] again our our title has always been
[31:51] has been for the last two months
[31:56] putting on the hormone of god
[32:08] you know and i forgot my little but if
[32:11] you can help me in the back
[32:15] we're gonna go to uh ephesians 6
[32:19] 11 and then i'll go back to the
[32:22] mama and it reads as follows
[32:26] put on the whole armor of god that ye
[32:29] may be able to stand against the wiles
[32:31] of the devil
[32:40] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[32:42] blood
[32:43] but against principalities against
[32:46] powers against the rulers of darkness
[32:48] of this world against spiritual
[32:50] wickedness in high places
[33:06] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[33:08] of god
[33:09] that you may be able to withstand in in
[33:12] the
[33:13] evil day and having done all to stand
[33:22] up
[33:34] i just wanted to always make sure that
[33:38] we're christians we are christians
[33:43] inner interdenominational faith
[33:48] we believe that our conduct should be
[33:51] based on the word of god
[33:54] everything should be written here
[33:56] everything was
[33:57] voiced by our prophet
[34:01] william william it was echoed
[34:04] by apostle
[34:17] because we are under grace
[34:32] that took jesus out of the history book
[34:38] the word of god church order
[34:41] and doctrine that's what we even taught
[34:46] the new generation
[34:58] [Music]
[35:40] and the first quote i want to read
[35:47] church order and conduct brother branham
[35:49] preach this and i i want you to know
[35:52] and the reason i want you to know why i
[35:55] don't come up here
[36:09] i want to start correcting those little
[36:11] things
[36:12] that have been taught
[36:18] please forgive me i'm aware
[36:22] bernie even our prophet
[36:36] not the person that comes behind this
[36:38] pulpit
[36:41] what brother branham stated
[36:45] the concerns that were happening in the
[36:47] tabernacle
[36:52] lat brother capps or whoever is leading
[36:55] song services
[36:57] and have a song leader no matter who it
[37:00] is
[37:06] no important don't let them stand up and
[37:09] say
[37:10] or carry on like they were a preacher
[37:18] this is god's pulpit
[37:21] it should be revered as a pulpit of god
[37:25] the ministry that comes up here
[37:29] but when we come up everybody wants to
[37:32] say
[37:33] something brother
[37:46] if you're praying for the petition
[37:54] but throughout the years we don't follow
[37:58] that
[37:58] no somebody will come up
[38:02] a message
[38:30] that's it
[38:44] goes on continue
[38:48] see let them stand up there and lead
[38:52] songs that's their business
[38:59] it's the pastor's business to preach
[39:05] songs
[39:11] the song leader leads
[39:26] and they have a summary
[39:30] and it's about 20 minutes
[39:33] and they say everything from everything
[39:36] and
[39:37] they go on
[39:40] we are a disciplined church
[39:47] is found in the bible
[39:53] how we actually
[40:22] not to feel sorry for myself
[40:27] i'm not a wimp no no
[40:31] i'm a soldier of god
[40:34] but if i'm not careful
[40:41] [Music]
[40:52] you get caught up in the daily life the
[40:55] struggles
[40:57] life is hard
[41:01] that's why we're being judged now
[41:29] the bride of jesus christ today
[41:44] but a day will come
[41:59] who doesn't think life is rough if you
[42:02] don't think life is rough
[42:04] share with me how you do it mothers you
[42:08] put your pants on the way i do
[42:11] use the way you do when i do someone
[42:14] else
[42:42] something
[44:16] we all have scars are right here
[44:34] because
[45:16] he's our
[45:26] i want you to go to slide
[45:36] six please
[45:42] just to say it quickly
[45:48] how many how many of us and i said it
[45:50] believe all the word of god
[45:53] if you believe the whole word of god
[45:57] either you're with me
[46:08] and we are believers of this world
[46:27] it's a plan of god it's just like a
[46:30] football game
[46:33] mexican football or american football
[46:35] footballer
[46:39] the soldiers the players
[46:42] they know their position
[46:46] is that right all sports
[46:50] positions they have a game plan
[47:22] as we continue how it is
[47:26] in this plan of god how it is
[47:30] if we're not careful
[47:35] i want to read a quote
[48:03] you know there's just haven't felt like
[48:05] that in a long time
[48:10] then before you know it she is young
[48:14] i'm trying to look young or vice versa
[48:18] because he's young okay let's corbin
[48:20] what woman is trying to look young
[48:23] have you noticed that
[48:26] i guess i've been watching too much tv
[48:29] television um
[48:30] soap operas
[48:48] but this flesh is getting old
[48:51] but one day it will be young again
[48:56] that's what i believe
[49:00] the beauty of my wife yes it is still
[49:03] there i want to study but i gotta look
[49:05] beyond our
[49:06] ages and have a revelation
[49:12] daughter of god
[49:28] foreign
[49:36] amen amen so this is what brother
[49:38] brenham said
[49:42] the battle raged when eve opened up her
[49:46] mind
[49:46] to listen to her reasoning
[49:56] and
[50:00] that's the flu it come in
[50:03] canal
[50:07] that's the flu it came in strata
[50:36] i remember what you did to me last week
[50:53] in that channel
[50:57] stays there that's why we can't have the
[51:01] victory
[51:03] that's why i can't overcome drugs
[51:06] i can't overcome liquors on a product
[51:10] of the flesh because i open
[51:14] up that channel
[51:18] i heard him say
[51:33] or temptation
[51:46] didn't i tell you to go to work
[52:02] if you don't do this i'm gonna go tell
[52:04] brother montoya
[52:13] everything goes here and the poor guy is
[52:16] back
[52:26] [Applause]
[52:30] because of the channel what we have
[52:33] opened up
[52:35] it's real israel these are strategies
[52:39] that the devil uses against us
[52:43] as long as we're in flesh and blood
[52:59] amends on that one that's a lot
[53:05] her reasoning she in her soul
[53:10] she reasoned against her
[53:40] and we know the greatest battle was
[53:41] fought here
[53:44] and today it's being fought here through
[53:46] this channel
[53:54] far better than her own husband
[53:58] or far better than his own wife
[54:04] don't fall asleep on me no
[54:07] i'll continue on we have been
[54:09] long-winded with this
[54:11] because it's so important this is
[54:14] life or death this is the strategy
[54:19] it's killing us today
[54:25] he was beautiful handsome far better
[54:28] than her own husband
[54:32] he was the most subtle of all the beasts
[54:34] in the field
[54:42] and he was probably a finer man than her
[54:45] husband
[54:51] all right uh stand up chewie
[54:54] i'm sorry chewie there's a big guy right
[54:58] there
[55:04] all right just let your massage go
[55:07] there's a young man right
[55:10] handsome looking tall alto but here is
[55:13] the serpent
[55:15] a foot taller than what he is
[55:25] oh this guy had braids nine
[55:34] ten foot tall the sps big hands manos
[55:37] grandes
[55:39] pearly white teeth
[55:44] didn't walk like this look at me now i
[55:46] see
[55:57] thank you the serpent
[56:02] was far better than adam
[56:06] that's what the bible teaches
[56:10] there it is how you stop
[56:19] he looked like a great masculine
[56:23] be standing there
[56:27] how great he was
[56:31] and he was trying to tell her what a
[56:34] great thing it was
[56:42] this new revelation that this serpent
[56:45] had
[56:47] he was trying to get her to see it
[56:51] masculine big man
[56:55] and he kept on enticing
[57:06] oh that guy is better than this guys
[57:23] what man is doing what the woman
[57:27] is doing or the young person when i get
[57:31] married it's going to have to look like
[57:38] i want her to look like this she doesn't
[57:41] look like that she knows
[57:42] how are you gonna go find me
[57:47] samson did the same thing
[57:50] but look at what he's saying
[57:54] the first thing she did she opened up
[57:57] her
[57:59] mind what's the mind
[58:03] what did brother branham teach us what
[58:05] the mind
[58:20] is
[58:35] but here it is and he was
[58:38] trying to tell her how great it was
[58:42] and the first thing she did she opens up
[58:46] her mind
[58:47] and when she did and when she
[58:51] did human reasoning caught it
[58:58] that's why we reason today
[59:01] well if i put a bigger ceiling
[59:06] i'm going to be able to do more with it
[59:11] then the reasoning comes
[59:15] who's going to do it
[59:19] all he has to do he gets a pick in the
[59:21] shovel and he digs down here
[59:26] then he just puts a thing a little
[59:28] higher
[59:31] or oh you get ernie montoya
[59:34] he gets a grenade he blows up all this
[59:39] then we start over
[59:56] the bible tells me i reason with god
[1:00:26] sickness
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:54] m
[1:00:56] amen amen listen why
[1:01:00] but okay wouldn't it be a thrill how
[1:01:02] many of you had a thrill
[1:01:05] seriously i've had thrills in my life
[1:01:08] i've gone
[1:01:22] goes up 250 feet from the front
[1:01:30] and the bad thing i got a cramp
[1:01:35] and my crap was in this leg and it was
[1:01:37] going up like this
[1:01:39] and when it was coming down i sat down
[1:01:41] real fast
[1:01:44] but it was a thrill of my life all those
[1:01:48] amusement parks
[1:01:50] get on the rods
[1:01:55] you get on those ones that superman
[1:01:59] sounds like a bullet goes up and comes
[1:02:02] back down
[1:02:04] you'll get the thrill of your life
[1:02:08] but there's other ways to get a thrill
[1:02:11] and this is what satan was telling this
[1:02:13] lady
[1:02:15] the serpent was telling this lady
[1:02:46] life is all about
[1:02:49] not only the woman getting the man too
[1:02:55] stop playing games no he has the man
[1:02:58] where he wants
[1:03:14] some woman with a lovely little husband
[1:03:17] find some great big masculine man
[1:03:26] this man will try to open up the
[1:03:28] reasoning
[1:03:32] you know i've seen some good people get
[1:03:34] divorces in my family
[1:03:41] beautiful sisters i have
[1:03:55] but one thing i do know it's biblical
[1:03:59] it's biblical been happening for a long
[1:04:01] time
[1:04:04] yes or no don't fall asleep on me
[1:04:07] don't worry i don't give names out you
[1:04:10] know
[1:04:16] this man will try to open up the
[1:04:17] reasoning
[1:04:21] your husband never told you this one
[1:04:25] your eyes are so bright they
[1:04:28] light up my heart your lips are so
[1:04:31] sweet that when i hear you
[1:04:35] speak of life i see heaven your middle
[1:04:38] cielo
[1:04:44] [Music]
[1:05:07] but that guy is good at what he does
[1:05:11] yes or no think about it
[1:05:16] remember that's satan
[1:05:42] is he working on you right now
[1:05:51] nobody's checking them out nine of
[1:05:53] starbucindo
[1:05:57] begins to move through but
[1:06:00] god gives but give god's word the first
[1:06:04] place
[1:06:09] you can't sin hallelujah
[1:06:12] here it is this is coming fresh
[1:06:16] new
[1:06:23] a man cannot sin until first he
[1:06:26] casts aside god's word
[1:06:55] he cannot even sin that's disbelief
[1:07:23] i don't have a problem with older people
[1:07:26] they're

[1:10:07] you believe he didn't have any problems
[1:10:10] he had a lot of problems
[1:10:14] he was a prophet to the whole world
[1:10:19] he had problems matter of fact he ran
[1:10:22] from his problems
[1:10:24] got off the field he left the field
[1:10:28] because of people
[1:10:42] and it's still going on people leave the
[1:10:45] message

[1:11:00] tell you what he said
[1:11:02] but on sunday check him out
[1:11:08] i'm sorry yes uh he's dirty
[1:11:14] looked like he came from work
[1:11:19] we dress the best we can
[1:11:24] honoring our father
[1:11:27] that's our example you don't see him
[1:11:31] with a mohawk haircut
[1:11:36] you don't see him with his funny
[1:11:37] sideburns or you know

[1:12:57] what does that mean well
[1:13:01] 101 means
[1:13:12] you know how they have ap calculus ap
[1:13:16] grammar
[1:13:30] so because it's so
[1:13:34] simple you don't have to think about it
[1:13:41] no wow that's simple
[1:13:45] just what the serpent said to eve
[1:13:49] makes it so simple everybody can
[1:13:51] understand this
[1:13:57] that's 101
[1:14:09] it's the art of planning and directing
[1:14:12] an
[1:14:12] overall military operation
[1:14:25] overall military operations
[1:14:30] and the reason i stopped there we're the
[1:14:33] military we have operations
[1:14:36] we gotta go to all countries
[1:14:56] you're having a good time what does
[1:14:59] satan do
[1:15:02] your being's burned to frijoles
[1:15:06] before you know it you're preoccupied

[1:16:02] i'm gonna go home after service
[1:16:30] he's already stopped 50 goals this year

[1:17:17] he wants to take his word
[1:17:19] god's word away from you
[1:17:22] god wants you to have faith
[1:17:25] satan wants you to reason satanic
[1:17:43] god wants you to love one another
[1:17:49] satan wants you to fight one another
[1:17:56] a tactic is a strategy
[1:18:00] by military operations

[1:18:25] this side
[1:18:27] we'll give you food we'll forgive you
[1:18:31] and they dropped them millions of them
[1:18:37] a strategy

[1:21:59] greatest battle ever fought
[1:22:03] there's two forces two
[1:22:06] armies

[1:22:22] whenever
[1:22:36] to write the voice of god i'm going to
[1:22:38] pay for the books
[1:22:40] english and spanish because we
[1:22:43] just don't know the greatest battle ever
[1:22:47] fighting the battle yeah so that means
[1:22:50] you need to read that book
[1:22:58] satan's weapon against you
[1:23:02] is to try to get you to disbelieve
[1:23:06] god's weapon

[1:23:14] the way it is
[1:23:17] let me read that over
[1:23:46] if he can get you to disbelieve your
[1:23:48] weapon
[1:23:49] is equivalent or if he can get you to
[1:23:52] disbelieve your weapon is equivalent
[1:23:55] if he can get you to believe that your
[1:23:57] weapon is not strong
[1:23:58] enough see
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:14] thank you sisters i you do a far better
[1:25:16] job than

[1:25:52] yes
[1:26:16] he wants to disarm us satan will disarm
[1:26:20] you

[1:27:32] somebody tells me something
[1:27:35] so you know what i said don't want to
[1:27:38] hear it
[1:27:38] no kiddo

[1:27:47] has something to say
[1:27:50] and we listen to it yes can't worry
[1:27:53] about him
[1:27:55] i have to worry about this person once
[1:27:57] this person is right and i can help this
[1:28:01] and i can help that person
[1:28:07] but i gotta do it here first

[1:28:20] is everybody has anyone ever heard
[1:28:23] something
[1:28:24] about you that was a liar

[1:30:33] so he knew i had a swarm in my house
[1:30:40] i think the only one i never swatted was
[1:30:41] james
[1:30:43] he never did anything wrong james
[1:30:48] but david he knew i had to swat him so
[1:30:50] he had to come in
[1:30:57] because he had pillows inside of his
[1:30:59] pants
