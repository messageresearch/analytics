[39:26] i put myself aside
[39:29] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[39:32] amen amen let me take your seats
[39:34] brothers
[39:38] first of all i want to thank god your
[39:40] pastor
[39:55] morning
[39:56] great great
[39:58] so we're going to talk a little bit of
[40:00] on the christmas
[40:03] uh
[40:04] what it means to us
[40:08] and um i hope you uh are helped with
[40:11] these words
[40:15] uh so when we talk about christmas
[40:19] uh christmas is a time where the family
[40:21] gets together
[40:24] where we get to see people that we
[40:26] haven't seen in a long time
[40:31] we see people traveling from one side of
[40:32] the country to the other quest
[40:37] and as i started looking into it
[40:41] i've heard a lot of times
[40:43] that people
[40:45] uh and
[40:46] people in general everywhere in the
[40:48] world
[40:50] becomes it changes their attitude a
[40:53] little bit around this time
[40:57] their attitude is a little bit more
[40:58] positive
[41:01] they're a little nicer when you speak
[41:02] with other people
[41:18] so i did a little research
[41:21] and one of the reasons
[41:23] is because people are expecting other
[41:25] guests
[41:28] they haven't seen in a long time
[41:31] so they're excited
[41:43] but there's another reason as well
[41:46] and it's the spiritual connection
[41:51] there was a little research i read
[41:54] that it said that one of the main
[41:56] reasons
[41:59] why people are happier on christmas days
[42:04] because their their spiritual
[42:07] connection is stronger
[42:12] with their religion or what they believe
[42:27] we know that the lord jesus christ
[42:32] we we celebrate
[42:33] uh christmas uh celebrates the birth of
[42:36] jesus christ
[42:40] even though we know it wasn't exactly in
[42:42] december
[42:53] so but holidays can also bring
[42:56] uh sadness to a person
[43:01] sometimes these holidays bring our
[43:03] unrealistic expectations
[43:08] we believe a holiday is going to change
[43:10] our our
[43:19] and some people will because they don't
[43:21] have the ability to get with their
[43:22] family or so again
[43:37] and the people get depressed
[43:40] that doesn't mean brothers
[43:43] the
[43:44] the lord jesus christ is not there for
[43:46] you
[43:48] he's still there
[43:50] and he's been he's worthy of praise
[43:54] man
[44:00] i was reading a little bit of what
[44:02] brother branham was teaching on
[44:04] christmas
[44:16] and today that memorial of his birthday
[44:20] is
[44:22] what do they do gassing
[44:24] they get some trees
[44:27] cut it down
[44:28] make a christmas tree for the kids
[44:32] but they think that
[44:34] that's all right i'm not i'm not kicking
[44:36] against it
[44:39] but here's the big butt perro
[44:43] the thing is it is
[44:47] they put more on the christmas tree than
[44:49] they do on christ
[44:56] chris kringle all over the country chris
[44:59] cringo esta porto del pais who is he
[45:03] a german a catholic saint years ago
[45:08] and old man went about doing good
[45:14] and today
[45:15] it becomes almost a worship
[45:30] as
[45:45] to push christ aside
[45:48] the real fundamentals of christ
[45:51] fundamentals
[45:52] of christmas
[45:54] man
[45:56] as i look in my life
[46:20] and
[46:21] that's something i want to change yes
[46:24] if i can at least that day
[46:27] talk about him 30 minutes an hour
[46:33] at least
[46:34] say what i'm thankful for
[46:38] that would be a good direction to start
[46:40] with
[46:53] i've heard stories
[46:58] like parents doing uh things for the
[47:00] children
[47:03] like i've heard parents say that
[47:05] they're they have a little elf in their
[47:08] house
[47:15] and it's supposed to be like watching
[47:17] their children seeing what they're doing
[47:18] good or bad
[47:23] and they say they have to wake up early
[47:25] in the morning so they can move the elf
[47:27] to different parts of the house
[47:34] and so the kids don't find out they
[47:36] moved
[47:40] because the parents tell the kids that
[47:41] that elf is watching what they do so if
[47:44] they're good santa will give them a good
[47:46] guess
[48:16] so that's
[48:17] that's where you see how important you
[48:18] can influence your children
[48:24] and that's why it's so important to tell
[48:26] them the truth right right out of the
[48:27] gate yes
[48:32] today's world santa claus want to take
[48:35] the place of the lord jesus christ
[48:39] we see it in in uh out in the streets
[48:43] uh in the television
[48:46] the stores
[48:49] um you you rarely see
[48:52] that uh christmas decoration of the lord
[48:54] jesus christ being being born now
[49:00] you used to see them sometimes in some
[49:01] houses at churches
[49:05] but um i haven't seen it in a while
[49:10] in decorations
[49:15] another part where brother branham
[49:17] speaks about this
[49:22] uh is the message divine healing
[49:25] um
[49:27] and i read
[49:29] now the christmas is not a
[49:32] protestant holiday
[49:34] festival
[49:35] it's a catholic day
[49:37] catholic the 25th of december
[49:41] months and months before or after before
[49:44] our lord was born
[49:49] our lord was born in april
[49:53] but he wasn't born in december
[49:56] if you've been in judo in december
[49:59] in december it's colder than this
[50:03] so you know he wasn't born in december
[50:08] he spelled it
[50:21] it's uh
[50:23] it's christmas not be that
[50:26] so when i was uh looking into these
[50:29] words when he like stretched out the
[50:32] word and uh emphasized in christmas
[50:39] so i started doing a little like
[50:41] looking for definitions
[50:45] and um when we first hear the word
[50:47] christmas we we break it up in in two
[50:50] words
[51:00] large number of people or a crowd
[51:03] together
[51:06] personas
[51:21] so when you put it all together and
[51:22] connect it
[51:24] it means that christmas is supposed to
[51:26] be a group of people filled with the
[51:27] holy spirit
[51:32] that are praising the lord
[51:54] let's use the holy spirit we have
[51:56] brothers
[51:59] to help our own families
[52:02] to help
[52:06] and
[52:07] let's not forget the important things
[52:11] let's praise the lord every day like if
[52:13] it was a christmas
[52:15] yes
[52:17] amen amen
[52:22] god bless you brothers
[52:24] it's just a few words i wanted to share
[52:26] with you
[52:29] amen
[52:38] god bless you elizabeth can you guys
[52:40] hear me all right
[52:43] let's get a moment here
[52:46] so like a brother was talking about he's
[52:47] talking about christmas
[52:51] i'd like to continue on
[52:55] and he touched on the point that i i
[52:57] figured he was going to touch on
[53:01] is that we know that our lord was not
[53:02] born in the month of december
[53:06] and i was reading a letter by uh
[53:09] that they wrote for the voice of for
[53:10] brother brandon for voice of god
[53:12] recordings
[53:22] is we know the month of december
[53:25] that our lord was not born
[53:38] and that's the way i was looking at it
[53:39] was giving me a perspective
[54:22] it's not the day of his birth
[54:24] but we can't miss the opportunity to see
[54:26] it as another day to celebrate hispanics
[54:32] and one of the things i wanted to talk
[54:34] about
[54:35] was gifts
[54:40] yes gifts could be both could be a
[54:42] talent and it could be something
[54:43] physical that you give
[54:45] us
[54:48] and what did christmas mean to me
[55:02] because before i moved to phoenix or
[55:04] cantos
[55:06] phoenix it's time for christmas
[55:09] i always came to phoenix
[55:12] when christmas came around
[55:14] i was going to go to phoenix
[55:16] i was going to see my uncles
[55:31] and i feel like as you get older
[55:35] you kind of stop focusing so much on the
[55:37] gifts
[55:40] you start appreciating more the the act
[55:42] of getting together
[55:45] and spending time with family family and
[55:48] getting to see your brother and sister
[55:49] in christ
[55:53] and so i was listening to a message
[55:54] earlier
[55:56] my brother bannon
[55:58] brandon and it's called god's wrapped
[56:00] gift he said
[56:10] he talks about how the gift we received
[56:14] was our lord jesus christ
[56:16] when he became flesh
[56:18] that was god's gift to us
[56:22] and that's the best gift we could ever
[56:23] receive
[56:26] thinking what other gifts have i
[56:27] received
[57:48] home is where the wi-fi connects
[57:50] automatically to your phone
[57:51] is
[58:06] brother bannon talks more about this
[58:07] gift
[58:10] and it's really interesting that he
[58:11] called it god's wrapped gift
[58:14] [Music]
[58:17] because he said that jesus was the
[58:19] wrapped gift
[58:23] god gave people this gift
[58:27] but people didn't want to open it
[58:30] they didn't want to accept it
[58:32] so i thought how would i feel
[58:48] and he says
[59:02] that's what happened
[59:04] we were given a gift
[59:06] many of us don't want to open it
[59:09] we don't want to see what's inside
[59:12] and that's what that's where i think
[59:13] about gifts and when we're giving gifts
[59:15] yes
[59:30] when jesus went to to the gathering with
[59:31] the pharisees and everybody was there
[59:35] that when that when she saw him
[59:40] that she couldn't stand to see him there
[59:42] sitting alone
[59:56] he talks about how when you went to
[59:57] these parties of these uh celebrations
[1:00:12] you're walking around he said in these
[1:00:13] type of sandals
[1:00:17] and so the first thing they would do is
[1:00:18] wash your feet
[1:00:22] they would greet you
[1:00:24] they would grab you
[1:00:26] and brother
[1:00:53] she felt compelled to do something about
[1:00:55] it
[1:00:57] brother describes this as as she see
[1:01:00] seeing this gift
[1:01:04] see in him like he's a present
[1:01:08] he wants to do with something with it
[1:01:11] so we know the story
[1:01:14] she goes over
[1:01:16] when she spend her money on the finest
[1:01:18] oils
[1:01:22] she washed his feet
[1:01:30] and that's when god god said that he
[1:01:32] forgave well that's when jesus said
[1:01:34] that all her sins had been forgiven
[1:02:04] and that's what i'm saying this morning
[1:02:07] how many of us want to open that gift
[1:02:10] i know there's a lot of physical gifts
[1:02:13] and we want to open them
[1:02:16] but sometimes we have other gifts
[1:02:31] how many gifts have i gotten
[1:02:35] that i've been too afraid to open it
[1:02:38] or maybe i haven't wanted to open them
[1:02:41] so i had to reflect on myself
[1:02:43] maybe you're thinking the same thing
[1:02:46] maybe you you've been given this gift of
[1:02:47] health
[1:02:51] but you you haven't opened it yet
[1:02:54] i don't know what reason but you just
[1:02:55] haven't open
[1:02:58] maybe something's holding you back
[1:03:09] in that way because maybe you've been
[1:03:11] giving a certain talent a certain gift
[1:03:13] he says
[1:03:14] but you're too afraid to use it
[1:03:18] you're too afraid to open it
[1:03:20] i feel like we have a lot of very uh
[1:03:22] very um
[1:03:23] capable youth
[1:03:26] capacity to let you know that if you
[1:03:28] feel like you have something in you
[1:03:31] don't be afraid to open it
[1:03:39] and use it for for it to uplift this
[1:03:41] name
[1:03:55] the idea of a gift
[1:03:59] and so i started thinking what other
[1:04:01] gifts do we receive
[1:04:04] many of us receive the gift of the holy
[1:04:06] ghost
[1:04:09] so i was thinking when did i receive
[1:04:11] this
[1:04:12] and i remembered
[1:04:14] that acts 238
[1:04:17] which is the one we hear each time when
[1:04:19] when you want to get when you get
[1:04:20] baptized
[1:04:23] it says you get baptized for everyone in
[1:04:25] the name of jesus christ
[1:04:29] for the remissions of sins
[1:04:34] it says the gift of the holy ghost
[1:04:38] so in itself that's another gift that we
[1:04:40] received
[1:04:43] that's another gift i received
[1:04:46] so i'm constantly receiving these gifts
[1:04:50] and it's not even christmas time
[1:04:52] but my point here was to for you to
[1:04:54] reflect
[1:04:56] and think about all the if you receive
[1:04:58] any gifts this christmas
[1:05:01] or maybe you don't ok
[1:05:03] you'll appreciate it
[1:05:05] because god has already given you a gift
[1:05:09] you have that gift
[1:05:12] and i just i'm happy to see each one of
[1:05:14] you this morning
[1:05:17] i'm happy to be here
[1:05:19] and i'm thankful that i have the gift of
[1:05:21] having a place to call my church
[1:05:27] and people who i can call my brothers
[1:05:28] and sisters in christ
[1:05:34] and people
[1:05:50] uh it's uh we always remember the they
[1:05:53] say the reason for the season
[1:05:56] which is they try to explain why we do
[1:05:58] what we do
[1:06:02] and that's when christmas they always
[1:06:03] say you have to remember the reason for
[1:06:05] the season
[1:06:08] and the reason is the birth of
[1:06:10] son
[1:06:12] lord jesus
[1:06:14] that's what we need to keep in mind when
[1:06:16] we're celebrating
[1:06:32] or whoever you spend it with
[1:06:34] us
[1:06:35] and appreciate each gift you get yeah
