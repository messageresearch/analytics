take that freedom from us amen but greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world and you know we have to be also be careful uh to not blame the devil for everything because in everything god gets the glory gloria and we know that god allows uh certain things uh to to try our faith knows that's true and if there is no uh uh trying of our faith why there's no there's no uh uh there's no way to uh to grow in faith is that right and if there's no test and you don't know where your weaknesses are so we must always remember just to trust god in everything amen you to matthew chapter 13. greet all of those on on the internet there who's watching this morning i greet you on behalf of my church a little church amazing grace tabernacle in tucson um arizona you know it's bad if i start speaking spanish huh amen matthew chapter 13. matteo capitol amen says here again the kingdom of heaven is like unto unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy therefore thereof goeth and selleth all that he had and buyeth that field again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it amen uh m47 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind has which when it was full they drew they drew it to shore and sat down and gathered the good on to vessels but cast the bat away so so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked uh several the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be willing and gnashing of teeth and all the time you were good is and though you allow him to try our faith and he presents things in front of us i recently read the back of the book and i was refreshed to remember if we are recording that at the end time we win and remembering that you are in my heart and that i too have already conquered death hell yeah for thou art with me oh lord and i believe in you this morning bless these words i pray bless those that are watching miranda bless those that are here bless the pastor and his ministry staff peninsula are they prospered all things good in jesus christ's name for there is none greater amen amen you may be seated this morning i wanted to talk uh preach to you this morning on a subject called on a subject what price would you pay what price will you pay i know that when we come to the the christian walk christian we uh we sometimes it's it's a jailhouse conversion sometimes it is a hospital conversion hospital perhaps a deathbed perhaps you're you're afraid of something happening maybe somebody close to you had a tragedy that seemingly woke you up or perhaps it was just uh uh something uh well for the most part but too often as people we uh we we barter or bargain with god understands what i'm saying we give up certain things but not all things would obtain you you see that in the sold out life of jesus christ and right away we say well that was different he was the son of god well i should remind you that adam also was the son of god and jesus had a choice jesus could have had a family jesus could have had children he was he had something pushing or leading him but the flesh part of him had a choice and and jesus saw through vision through the revelation that that god in him gave him how he was able to pray how is he able to do this because he saw the bigger greater picture and we must remember as people as human beings that the the the temporary uh satisfactions here or just that temporary solamentos and nothing that you are enjoying that perhaps is sinful and he was telling me how he was having trouble fighting this sickness and i said you know you lived a pretty good life the last few years but while you were young you did a lot of damage lots of drinking yeah lots of you know drugs and so forth and it caused his liver and his kidneys and so his body to overwork itself so that now that he really needs the strength of his immune system your flesh however [Applause] and you say well why didn't god just heal me of the of the attributes of sin he's coming back for the part of you that's a part of him from before the foundation of the world [Applause] and blood [Applause] this flesh is not going back to god the spirit is going back to god [Applause] god will forgive you the evidence is still there and so that part of sin is a part of the pecan that that was pleasure for a little while you you have to work through those things was the drugs worth it was the drinking worth it was was the you know you understand what i'm saying and so then we begin to understand if you pay a greater price a greater portion of god is there for you and we often uh uh you know point out the bad things but it's not just the bad things that'll keep you out of the presence of god working is good and having wealth is fine but if it keeps you from coming to church it puts a wedge between you and the lord how many understand we'll how much of god do you really want [Applause] now i've laid a foundation let me go a little deeper if you'll turn to genesis chapter 21 er verse nine particularly and we knew that god had called abraham to a a place who was builder who uh to a city whose builder and maker was god but now if you're familiar with the story it was not just a different place come out of the people you're around leave your father and [Applause] [Applause] and you can see that that abram had nothing but trouble until he let lot go a lot but then we we go a little further he was waiting for a promised son [Applause] but it was taking a little bit of time [Applause] and sarah started to say well maybe you should do this or maybe god meant this [Applause] [Applause] it says i'm going to visit you according to the time of life remember ishmael had already been born he tells them i'm going to bring you the promise i told you [Applause] the moms are competing now and the suns are competing [Applause] that the birthright goes to the firstborn and sarah was not okay with that and verse 21 uh verse nine here it says and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had borne unto abraham mocking wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bones woman shall not be air with my son even isaac now listen verse 11. and the thing was very grievous in abraham's sight because of his son are you catching what i'm doing here it was not an easy thing i i don't care if it came from hagar or what the issue was this boy is still [Applause] but there was still some kind of bond between them so help me out now you understand what i'm saying he [Applause] and this time he says [Music] [Applause] but he had to pay a bigger price [Applause] you'd not be able to number them [Applause] and i imagine that it must have been hard on isaac as well that was his [Applause] [Applause] abraham knew god's word if he proceeded to kill isaac god would have to raise him up again to fulfill his promise [Applause] [Applause] because of this because of this i'm going to do what i said i was going oh yeah well god had already given his word it wasn't that god was looking for him to do something he was allowing abraham to prove to abraham abraham was willing to pay any prices [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] anything caleb you and me are going to be very close you're going to be so close to me closer than anybody has ever been to me and i would get excited that sounds great fantastic i'll do anything you asked my name i'm gonna give it to you i want to send you a number we are going to be tight in the world that you and me are tight praise god but then he might say this you've got [Applause] walk [Applause] would i be willing sorry i get too sweaty and then i gotta switch them out oh forgive me brother as the saying goes it's all fun and games so somebody loses an eyeliner i didn't say he would take it from me i said he would require it you understand the difference it's not that he would snatch it from your hand it would be just give it over and i'll do what i said no no also caleb your health will not be good you'll be in pain the rest of your life you'll suffer for my name's sake i asked myself [Applause] would i lay down isaac on the altar this is not something that god didn't do himself the bible says for god in order to gain something how many understands that he knew that we as mankind would never be able to pay the price we'd never own up to it also blame god he said the woman that you gave me your god you took her out on my side adam didn't even own his [Applause] why does god let this happen you have [Applause] say you did it you had the opportunity and you took it don't look at me tell each other you see how hard it is okay let's try it this way i did [Applause] especially looking into your husband and wife then he said eve what have you done she goes the serpent in the poor serpent he is a dumb animal who got when we're willing to own what we have done [Applause] such aren't you glad for the word let me let me get going here what are you willing to give up he says and this new birth is nothing less than a mess you get up from the altar crying and carrying on continuing uh it makes a starchy church feel like you don't have to do that that we live today and are willing to pay the price amen amen i hear the pouch saying it man all right if you're willing to pay the price and lay we ought to teach for them the baptism of the holy spirit [Applause] there is no better class of people [Music] there's nobody better [Applause] [Applause] it did anybody know that [Applause] [Applause] to everybody they have some decency they walk with humility we are a royal priesthood a holy nation see when adam took the first bite [Applause] [Applause] it'll never take the place of god's new birth amen amen so what price are you willing to pay yeah i know we got some pretty intelligent people and we've got some really revelated people we still need to hand over those trophies to god criticize that's strange you don't like the way he did things you don't like how he did things you don't like the people that follow his message but without the message he had nothing to preach huh i got a question why is it that when when when people cause a disturbance how come they don't go down to the baptist church with that stuff help me out somebody you wanna make one how come they don't go meet with the pope set him straight that's how you say pope papa oh yes that's horrible huh i'll come in on go meet with the catholic dignitaries of god with their nonsense no because they're only big shots in message churches you know why they don't go down those places [Applause] they know those dignitaries because all they got is words give up his first wife he had to give up his daughter he had to give up the baptist church away from all those things in order for god to take him further did you say montoya yeah i found out pastor montoya that that that god deals with me better okay when i get away from people and if you don't do it is you stand lower maybe i'll cause you to have a misunderstanding with somebody else and people walk but i went and right when i got to the hotel hotel i saw they didn't feel good i said what in the world is this i was in you know what i'm saying just the pressure the brothers thought i was sick so they wouldn't come see me i and all i could do was pray and the lord showed me some things i had to i paid for that trip and the lord told me this so you'll know that i allowed this i'm going to send somebody to pay the bill for you so one of the brothers that found out i was sick he found out what my expenses were and he said he felt led to god to reimburse me yes sometimes you need to let brother uh pastor ernie ernie get along with the burning bush so that he can give you what god wants to give you sometimes if we're bothering the pastor or just yeah let me finish up i don't know how much time it's gonna tell me that i need it got about 10 15 minutes or something oh i got five minutes okay all right let's go there okay and so it is today i got 35 more minutes wow there is no need of any man dying in sin there's no need of all this stuff going on away [Music] [Applause] but god allows the situations to come down he [Music] there's no [Applause] for stop making them do it let god show them how to do it i'll close with this there's a bomb in gilead there's a physician there are you medica but the people won't take his medicine thinks he's too good to take the medicine of the holy ghost the holy ghost is god's medicine [Applause] sometimes it's hard yeah but it always does it tastes bad it tastes better it takes bad tasting medicine medicine to do to do you any good but is that right they're not willing to pay the price in the bible revelations 10 apocalypses yes so take the little book eat it instead of sweeten your mouth you're you're free from cigarettes here as an example because nobody in here i don't see anybody in here so you're free here but when you walk outside and you changed your life he can also be there but that thing got a hold of you all right see i see you're gonna smoke forgive me bro come on you're gonna smoke myself you take this cigarette [Applause] [Applause] you know as i was meditating god is really good to uh god is really good to us so i want to read a quote a hidden life in praise and what we have to give up is right here was there where the church is failing in a place overcoming overcoming temperance here's my neighbor the person sitting next to the person that's your neighbor brother branham continues excuse me that was that was good brother caleb it's not watermelon that has nothing to do excuse me that has brother you're lost that's hard to say but that's the truth overcome ben said yes see look what happens from one day to the other capacity you get to miss meal cramps foreign they're that's the way you got to do it that's the hidden life that's the consecrated life that's the life that the veils veils of the world [Music] from the things of the world you only live in christ you see what i mean so i'm telling you this morning the brother doesn't know what you're going through but it's our fault each family that has a renegade excuse me son or daughter do it they want to do whatever they wanted then you don't want to come to church then you blame your neighbor then you hate your parents brother sister if you're [Applause] because we gave it but what calms me down is the word of god what i need in my life what you need in your life is to stay active and i'm gonna we're gonna have a prayer line but the reason i have all those young people back there is so that they can come to church they feel part of the church doing this playing with their fingers when is he going to finish why do i have others preach i have so much message i can take a year and a half but i gotta get them involved say no we're in trouble but who or what price will you pay this morning don't think about yourself think of your family so give him up and god will bless you danny bless job took everything from him but he blessed them so i want one two three four right here okay please uh
