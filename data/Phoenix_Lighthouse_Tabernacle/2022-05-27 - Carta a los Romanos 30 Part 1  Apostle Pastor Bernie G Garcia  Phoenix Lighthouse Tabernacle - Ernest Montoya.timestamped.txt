[20:15] on the subject of your conscience and
[20:17] the day of judgment
[20:32] for relay
[20:50] [Music]
[21:21] for as many as have sinned without law
[21:23] shall also perish without law and as
[21:26] many as have sinned in the law shall be
[21:28] judged by the law
[21:29] for not the hearers of allah or just
[21:31] before god but the doers of allah shall
[21:33] be justified for when the gentiles which
[21:36] have not the law do by nature the things
[21:39] contained in the law
[21:40] these having not the law are allah unto
[21:42] themselves which show the work of the
[21:45] law written in their hearts their
[21:47] conscience also bearing witness and
[21:50] their thoughts the mean while accusing
[21:52] or else excusing one another
[21:56] in the day when god shall judge the
[21:58] secrets
[21:59] of men by jesus christ according to my
[22:01] gospel
[22:04] god bless his word
[22:10] before saying
[22:14] [Music]
[22:25] in english
[22:28] [Music]
[22:37] [Music]
[22:40] of
[22:41] redemption
[22:43] is
[22:46] [Music]
[23:02] your life
[23:05] [Music]
[23:12] your redemption
[23:15] is near
[23:18] amen
[23:29] before beginning we want to welcome all
[23:31] those that visit us
[24:02] i know the
[24:16] and being that you have come to a
[24:17] sanctuary that says that you're wanting
[24:19] to be helped
[24:23] it's a privilege for you to come to be
[24:25] with us
[24:32] we're speaking about your conscience and
[24:34] the day of judgment
[24:40] i'd like to review something a small
[24:42] item
[24:51] this morning i want to speak about just
[24:54] concerning consciousness
[24:58] [Music]
[25:12] permits me the next time i speak i want
[25:15] to bring on the other side of the
[25:16] conscience
[25:25] as we have started speaking about
[25:27] consciousness we have said that man is a
[25:29] triune being
[25:33] we've drawn a circle
[25:36] the outside part which is the body lego
[25:39] la parte
[26:21] [Music]
[26:22] and when we're referring to
[26:24] consciousness we're not referring to the
[26:25] outside consciousness
[26:29] because we're conscious of the outside
[26:34] through the five senses
[27:04] is
[27:15] [Music]
[27:17] remember that the spirit is tied to the
[27:19] soul
[27:25] everything that will be saying in this
[27:26] subject
[27:46] [Music]
[27:50] and so it can be well established and
[27:52] the people can know the reason why we're
[27:54] here
[27:58] so the innermost part is the soul
[28:13] [Music]
[28:27] project to you just a positive
[28:29] [Music]
[28:56] we believe that
[29:09] [Music]
[29:11] this kind of shocks people when they
[29:13] hear it for the first time
[29:17] when you talk about predestination
[29:24] but if we go back to the simplicity of
[29:26] the gospel
[29:31] the reason why god made himself flesh
[29:37] that's why emmanuel got with us was
[29:39] manifest
[29:46] in the savior which we know him as the
[29:48] lord jesus christ
[29:55] his sole purpose was to seek that and
[29:57] find that which had been lost
[30:02] even the word redeemed
[30:03] significa
[30:35] everything handed over to the devil
[30:40] there was our salvation
[30:44] each one of us fell right there
[31:02] but thanks
[31:43] there was something in him already
[32:10] but my petition that i have to god is
[32:12] that he might be able to relax
[32:17] and we might be able to understand that
[32:19] we're eternal
[32:22] if he was to say it like this
[32:24] extraterrestrial we're extraterrestrials
[34:18] doesn't matter
[34:32] neither nothing or no
[34:47] a few scriptures now and so we can talk
[34:48] about conscience
[34:51] [Music]
[34:53] i want to talk on just one side of the
[34:54] corner
[34:57] say amen
[34:59] open your bibles please
[35:13] if
[35:14] as this message is going forth if a
[35:16] question comes to your mind
[35:19] why don't you jot it down
[35:22] and if we finish the series
[35:28] we might
[35:56] first timothy 1
[35:58] 5
[36:04] 0
[36:10] is
[36:16] now the end of the commandment is
[36:18] charity out of a pure heart
[36:21] and of
[36:22] a good conscience and of faith
[36:41] [Music]
[37:06] kindness
[37:21] commandment is charity out of a pure
[37:23] heart
[37:26] talks about a pure heart
[37:32] and of a good conscience
[37:47] so then the spirit linked to the soul
[37:53] the third part is with faith
[37:59] we must have a good conscience
[38:01] [Music]
[38:16] is
[38:26] we're gonna be reading there
[38:29] in uh chapter three verse nine 9.
[38:35] timothy chapter 1 verse 19.
[38:44] there is saying holding and that's
[38:45] grabbing hold up
[38:50] holding faith and a good conscience
[38:55] we're going to see something here
[38:57] this morning
[40:08] so we must
[41:17] holding the mystery of the faith in a
[41:19] pure conscience
[41:22] mysterious see there is a mystery
[41:25] the mystery is of faith
[41:33] when a person gets to the awareness and
[41:35] knowledge of what faith is
[41:38] what this mystery is
[41:43] he finds that in him there's a certain
[41:45] authority
[42:13] [Music]
[42:55] what god has done for us
[43:21] apostle saint paul
[43:40] and thank god whom i serve from my
[43:42] forefathers with pure conscience that
[43:45] without ceasing i have remembrance of
[43:47] thee in my prayers night and day
[43:50] pablo established
[44:20] he spoke about the resurrection from the
[44:22] dead 2416.
[44:32] he wanted to attain to be a partaker of
[44:35] the resurrection from the dead
[44:39] in other words he understood
[44:41] that there was a special group
[44:44] i was going to raise from the dead
[45:19] and then do i exercise myself to have
[45:22] always a conscience void of offense
[45:24] toward god and toward men
[45:29] in other words a clean conscience
[45:59] or the deacon
[46:01] just cover it up
[46:02] with that that's the enemy
[46:06] you must always keep a clean conscience
[46:11] and right inside of us is that conscious
[46:26] i do exercise myself to have always a
[46:29] conscience void of offense
[46:33] this proves to me
[46:36] that a man can have a clean conscience
[46:40] but he can
[47:38] that way we can always have a conscious
[47:40] voice of offense toward god and toward
[47:41] men
[47:47] so you must have a consciousness not
[47:49] guilty standing before god amen
[48:18] is
[48:31] so we can bring it to light the next
[48:32] time
[48:35] but this morning what i'd like to do
[48:37] i'd like to read it
[48:42] hebrews
[48:43] chapter 10 verse 22
[49:02] let us draw near with a true heart and
[49:05] full assurance of faith having our
[49:07] hearts sprinkled from all
[49:09] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[49:12] washed with clear water
[49:29] he completely convinced for sure
[49:41] having a heart sprinkled from an evil
[49:43] conscience
[49:46] and our body is washed with protection
[49:51] that's an inexhaustible culture
[49:54] where you can't
[50:24] and when they accept it they feel like
[50:25] something went off for them
[50:29] they feel clean they actually have been
[50:30] cleaned
[50:31] they go outside
[50:33] one goes out clean
[50:35] one does not go out
[50:38] one accepted
[51:34] if
[52:29] how much more
[52:31] shall the blood of christ who through
[52:33] the eternal spirit offered himself
[52:35] without spot to god purge your
[52:36] conscience from dead works to serve the
[52:38] living god
[52:42] small items
[52:56] he offered himself
[53:22] just recently we received the book i
[53:24] think we did
[53:38] there's a portion there that i've been
[53:39] quoting it for 17 years now
[54:07] we're just a garbage can
[54:13] [Music]
[55:08] [Music]
[55:32] perfect
[55:46] is
[55:59] jesus christ
[56:13] is
[56:51] i'd like to show you one side of the
[56:52] conscience now
[57:24] 25 cents a quarter from here in the
[57:26] united states
[57:29] but i have spoken this morning
[57:33] it's just the introduction
[57:36] to speak about consciousness
[58:27] i believe that this bible that's here
[58:31] cannot be understood except at
[58:41] except through the message that has been
[58:42] given to us by god's mouth which is his
[58:46] prophet amino
[58:48] i don't
[59:54] [Music]
[59:58] uh
[1:00:12] if i teach
[1:00:51] it's got one eye in it
[1:01:51] you
[1:01:59] [Music]
