[23:11] us we also welcome brother Riley his
[23:22] wife we had announced previously before
[23:24] we get into that we would continue on
[23:26] the uh sermon the top that we started
[23:29] last Sunday
[23:34] morning like to say the 26th of October
[23:36] was my birthday happy birthday I already
[23:39] sang Happy Birthday to
[23:45] myself uh when I reached on turn 51 last
[23:57] Friday of course a jubilee year was is
[23:59] one full year and that's that ended my
[24:02] Jubilee how many of you remember that
[24:05] according to the
[24:13] word and they G handed me the contract
[24:15] that day where they're buying seven and
[24:17] a half acres back
[24:22] here they'll be giving me 150,000 on the
[24:25] 31st of
[24:27] January
[24:34] I'll be handing over 110,000 of that uh
[24:37] right away for the debts we
[24:42] have when I turned 50 it's been a year
[24:45] ago
[24:50] now my dad had commented on that being
[24:52] that I had turned
[24:57] 50
[25:03] and I said that's according to the word
[25:04] because there's something special about
[25:06] it when you turn
[25:08] 50 almost a year went
[25:11] by and then the Lord helped
[25:14] me all of
[25:19] us we should give the Lord an
[25:27] Applause
[25:33] [Music]
[25:41] let's stand
[25:43] please read the
[25:47] [Music]
[25:49] scripture we reading Genesis chapter
[25:53] 1 verses 1 to
[25:57] 11
[26:00] subject that we've taken is the Original
[26:10] Seed this will be the second sermon or
[26:13] message on that subject and we'll
[26:14] probably have to leave it because it's
[26:16] we won't have enough time to cover the
[26:18] whole
[26:27] subject
[26:57] for
[27:03] [Music]
[27:27] for
[27:44] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[27:46] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[27:48] form and void and darkness was upon the
[27:50] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[27:52] moved upon the face of the waters and
[27:55] God said let there be light and there
[27:57] was light and God saw the light that it
[27:59] was good and God divided the light from
[28:01] the darkness and God called the light
[28:04] day and the Darkness he called night and
[28:06] the evening and the morning were the
[28:07] first day
[28:09] amen and God said let there be a
[28:11] firmament in the midst of the waters and
[28:13] let it divide the waters from the waters
[28:15] and God made the firmament and divided
[28:16] the waters which were under the
[28:18] firmament from the waters which were
[28:19] above the firmament and it was so and
[28:21] God called the fir me heaven and the
[28:23] evening and the morning with the second
[28:24] day and God said let the waters from
[28:26] under the heavens be gathered unto to
[28:28] one place and let the dry land appear
[28:30] and it was so and God called the dry
[28:32] land Earth and the Gathering Together
[28:33] the waters she called seas and God saw
[28:36] that it was good and God said that the
[28:38] Earth bring forth grass the herb
[28:40] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[28:41] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[28:44] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[28:49] so now Genesis
[28:57] 2:7
[29:04] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[29:06] of the ground and breathed into his
[29:08] nostrils a breath of life and Man became
[29:10] a living
[29:11] Soul let us pray to
[29:18] God once again Lord we place ourselves
[29:21] in your hands and we report for
[29:27] service
[29:29] we ask that you make still us quietness
[29:31] so that we may meditate and think on
[29:32] your
[29:36] word may we receive the teaching from
[29:39] your
[29:41] word we thank you for the message of the
[29:46] hour and also the messenger that you
[29:48] sent that
[29:52] message had it not been for that message
[29:54] we would not be in
[29:55] confusion we thank you once again
[29:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:00] amen amen you may be
[30:07] seated subject that we have taken is the
[30:10] original
[30:15] seed I'd like to make a comment before
[30:17] entering into the
[30:25] teaching throughout my life I've heard
[30:28] comments from a very illustrious
[30:39] Man by God's grace I was able to read
[30:41] one of his articles last
[30:46] week when I started comparing it to the
[30:56] scriptures I was amazed at how far away
[31:00] from scriptural truth this man
[31:04] is this man is famous worldwide and has
[31:07] a radio program worldwide
[31:17] also and many of the Believers in the
[31:19] Pentecostal age and message have been
[31:21] swept under the teachings of this
[31:26] man
[31:34] and I've seen in reading his editorial
[31:35] that he does it really wisely but he's
[31:37] so far away from
[31:46] scripture we're not bragging now but we
[31:49] believe that brother bam was sent with
[31:51] the word for this
[31:56] hour
[32:00] and if brother BR did teach something
[32:01] that that the people are not accustomed
[32:03] to or used
[32:10] to we don't blame the people for at
[32:12] first rejecting what the prophet
[32:20] brought but if they would just but
[32:22] listen I believe that the Lord would
[32:23] open up their understanding of a lot of
[32:26] people because everything that the
[32:28] prophet taught is
[32:39] scriptural we read in the scripture
[32:41] there in Genesis how each seed was to
[32:42] produce reproduce after its own
[32:46] kind how many of you believe that each
[32:48] God's word reproduces according to its
[32:50] own
[32:56] kind we seen see that the Original Seed
[32:59] is Jesus Christ is that
[33:02] right he is a
[33:10] logos we see how that when God said let
[33:13] the man come forth man came
[33:18] forth and that man was a spiritual
[33:23] man then we have the scripture in
[33:25] Genesis
[33:26] 2:7
[33:29] now this is another
[33:30] man how many of you can say Amen to
[33:41] this we see here that God breathed into
[33:44] his nostrils a breath of life and Man
[33:45] became a living
[33:50] Soul so this takes us now to the
[33:52] beginning of the teaching this
[33:54] morning help me out so we can
[34:01] progress being aware that we can't cover
[34:05] can't cover a lot of
[34:08] ground I have drawn here three
[34:14] circles first circle is the
[34:19] body the body of every human
[34:24] being this body is of what
[34:28] it's a body of
[34:31] Flesh our flesh body each and every one
[34:35] of us I have a
[34:39] question where was that body of Flesh
[34:45] formed whose
[34:47] womb in the mother's
[34:50] womb is that
[34:54] right the body was formed in the
[34:57] mother's
[35:01] wom the second Circle we have is the
[35:07] spirit where was the
[35:10] spirit where was that Spirit
[35:17] formed outside what
[35:20] body in the
[35:23] world outside the mother in the world
[35:28] is that
[35:29] right you're not too
[35:32] sure brother
[35:34] says when a mom mother is about to give
[35:41] birth a spirit is surrounding that
[35:45] mother brother Bram calls it an
[35:48] angel a
[35:54] spirit brother says that when the mother
[35:56] drops the baby drops oriv a
[36:01] baby says that the body comes out of the
[36:04] mother's
[36:07] womb and that there's no Spirit to
[36:10] receive that body then that body is
[36:11] still born dead is that
[36:14] right is that
[36:18] right if you don't understand it so I
[36:20] can repeat
[36:25] it then that person being inside the
[36:28] does not have a spirit
[36:30] yet spirit is
[36:32] outside it's in the
[36:35] world waiting for that
[36:41] baby when enters into the
[36:48] baby then that baby becomes a living
[36:53] Soul when it becomes a living
[36:56] soul
[36:59] the soul and the spirit are just like
[37:01] that
[37:03] together there's no one that can
[37:05] separate the soul from the
[37:09] spirit the only thing that can separate
[37:11] the spirit and the soul is God's
[37:15] word and the Word was brought
[37:18] by that's the only thing that can
[37:20] separate one from the
[37:21] other and the spirit and the
[37:24] soul I wrote here as a heart
[37:29] they're both in the
[37:30] heart how many of you believe
[37:34] that if you're sure say
[37:38] amen and if I ask later ask you a
[37:41] question and you answer wrong it's
[37:42] because you weren't
[37:44] sure brother
[37:50] says says that the soul is the nature of
[37:52] the spirit they're not separated they're
[37:56] together two different things one one is
[38:00] the other one is the
[38:03] soul so the soul is the nature of the
[38:06] spirit the prophet
[38:12] says says your brain is not your
[38:18] intelligence it's your spirit that's in
[38:20] you is your
[38:23] intelligence brother benam
[38:26] said
[38:28] says the mind is the womb of the
[38:30] spirit so the
[38:33] mind is not the intelligence how many of
[38:36] you believe
[38:39] this says notice how
[38:42] simple the
[38:43] [Music]
[38:45] mind is the womb of the
[38:48] spirit but the mind is not the
[38:55] intelligence so what the serpent was
[38:56] looking for when he made made contact
[38:57] with
[38:58] Eve and what he was
[39:01] seeking was the
[39:04] spirit This Woman's
[39:07] spirit because he was seeking
[39:12] intelligence and when a person starts to
[39:13] converse with
[39:15] another seeking out his
[39:21] intelligence according to person's
[39:23] intelligence is how you can coexist with
[39:26] them even that's why even in
[39:32] marriages many couples cannot
[39:36] coexist there's not an equality
[39:38] intellectually
[39:41] speaking except they both surrender to
[39:43] the then there's no
[39:46] problems but there has to be a
[39:50] coexistence and according to the
[39:52] intelligence of that person is how you
[39:53] can coexist with
[39:56] them
[39:59] so the serpent was seeking the
[40:01] womb the
[40:05] mind that's the only way he he could get
[40:07] to her
[40:10] spirit the spirit is the
[40:12] life to be able to
[40:15] answer and place in
[40:19] her not in her
[40:21] soul but rather in her
[40:25] flesh to bring about reproduction of the
[40:28] human
[40:30] being but first of all he had to insert
[40:32] himself inject himself into the human
[40:34] race not just in the
[40:38] body but in the deepest part of that
[40:40] human
[40:42] being once
[40:44] again
[40:46] review the
[40:49] body of a human beings is formed
[40:56] where I need for all of you that know to
[40:58] answer at one
[41:00] time if you understand this I need for
[41:02] you to
[41:03] answer where was your body
[41:09] formed where was the
[41:13] spirit Spirit was outside the
[41:17] body so here's the key for you to be
[41:20] able to
[41:22] understand why you need have to be born
[41:26] again
[41:28] how many of you believe that you've been
[41:29] born again say
[41:33] Amen this
[41:35] bird this new
[41:37] birth where is that taken where does
[41:39] that take
[41:42] place
[41:44] where it's in the heart of the human
[41:49] being so then it is a spiritual
[41:52] birth is that
[41:55] right how many you believe that that
[41:57] you've had a new birthday
[41:59] amen where did this new birth take place
[42:03] in the heart in the human's
[42:06] heart if it be
[42:10] so if you were born
[42:14] again you're a spiritual Spirit
[42:18] man how many of you believe you're
[42:21] person a new
[42:22] creature amen if you believe
[42:26] that so
[42:28] here this this returns you back to
[42:32] Genesis
[42:33] 1 The Original
[42:37] Seed this takes you back to Genesis
[42:42] 1 when you get down to
[42:45] Genesis
[42:47] 27 we still have not been returned to
[42:49] the to that
[42:52] yet this body I will prove it
[42:55] later came
[42:57] by
[43:01] sex this body was formed in our mother's
[43:06] womb and that conception came through a
[43:08] sexual
[43:10] act it is not Original
[43:15] Seed it's a
[43:17] byproduct it's a secondary type of
[43:20] act not God's perfect
[43:24] will but God has made his new creatures
[43:28] in the
[43:30] inside but as long as we're living here
[43:32] on this
[43:33] Earth until the Resurrection
[43:37] comes we're burying in us two
[43:43] men we could say so you could get it
[43:46] right
[43:46] away but we're trying to say if we're
[43:48] born
[43:50] again we're a grain of
[43:53] wheat how many of you believe you're a
[43:55] grain of
[43:56] wheat
[43:58] the only problem is that there are a
[43:59] grain of
[44:00] wheat inside a cocko
[44:05] [Music]
[44:08] b Co is
[44:13] sticky and that conck needs
[44:18] water up until the Resurrection
[44:22] comes you can be a new creature in
[44:24] Christ
[44:25] Jesus but if you're not getting water
[44:28] you get real sticky real sticky thorny
[44:31] and you get you
[44:36] stick we'll be entering into the
[44:38] teaching that I have for this morning
[44:44] now how many of you believe that God's
[44:46] word is the Original
[44:51] Seed this uh subject that I've taken the
[44:53] Original
[44:56] Seed
[44:58] the prophet says that the Original
[45:00] Seed is Jesus
[45:06] Christ in order to understand this we
[45:08] have to give a little bit of a
[45:12] review he says this is the original
[45:16] seed it's God's
[45:18] word it's a
[45:20] logus in other
[45:25] words the word says that and then and
[45:28] God
[45:29] said when he said
[45:32] something what he said was is the
[45:34] Original
[45:39] Seed but then that seed created other
[45:45] seeds spoken the original
[45:50] SE that Original Seed brought forth
[45:52] millions of
[45:54] seeds so those seeds
[45:59] become part of
[46:02] him even
[46:04] we are a seed of God we're God's
[46:09] word we're part of
[46:11] God we're
[46:13] original because we're part of
[46:17] him he is the
[46:20] original if you understand me up to now
[46:22] say
[46:25] Amen if I don't have have enough
[46:28] time to get to where I wanted to get
[46:34] to I want to give you or say to you what
[46:37] has amazed
[46:40] me I am a new
[46:44] creature I believe you are are
[46:50] also I believe that I am that Spirit man
[46:53] and I'm speaking about the Inside
[46:55] Man
[47:01] that's Spirit man that the Bible says
[47:03] that God created in His image and
[47:07] likess I believe that when he chose
[47:12] me he knew what would be coming
[47:15] forth he knew that the fall would come
[47:23] about he knew that every man would be
[47:25] brought forth in sin
[47:31] he knew that that body of
[47:34] Flesh would not be changed until the
[47:39] resurrection he knew that this Spirit
[47:41] man brother ber
[47:45] gar would live inside that cockle
[47:51] bir and he had enough trust in
[47:54] me that even so he chose me
[47:59] because because I have noticed that see
[48:02] there's evil in
[48:06] me I have come to the conclusion that
[48:08] the wrong the evil is in
[48:13] me I have come to a conclusion that this
[48:15] body that I have is
[48:19] sin I come that I was sold into
[48:25] sin that that first man forfeited me and
[48:28] handed me over into
[48:30] slavery I come to the
[48:32] conclusion that God chose
[48:35] me he has me in this body of in a
[48:41] Cocker that Desir those things of the
[48:44] world but yet he had enough trust in
[48:48] me that this Inside
[48:52] Man was going to bring this cocko bird
[48:54] body into subjection
[48:58] and that's what makes me
[48:59] cry he had enough trust in
[49:02] me this 20th century that we're not
[49:04] living
[49:05] in you can't hardly trust
[49:12] anybody before the prophet said that
[49:14] beforehand you could shake make a
[49:16] contract with a man agreement and shake
[49:17] hands with
[49:18] him and that man was mad enough to keep
[49:20] his word in that
[49:24] contract now you even have a contract
[49:27] notorized by not Republic and even that
[49:29] way they still don't keep
[49:30] it that's the age that we're living in
[49:33] but in this
[49:37] age God placed a group of
[49:40] seed a group of
[49:44] wheat inside
[49:47] bir and they trusted
[49:52] them trust to them that they will become
[49:54] the manifestation of the sons of God and
[49:56] that all
[49:58] creation should be restored back to its
[50:00] original
[50:02] condition this is the age of
[50:05] restoration through the original SE when
[50:08] I see it like
[50:09] that I said oh you're
[50:12] tremendous you're so great I don't even
[50:14] trust myself but and I've always said
[50:17] that I don't even trust
[50:19] [Music]
[50:20] myself yet you trust
[50:22] me this causes me to break down and
[50:25] cry
[50:27] when we come to the awareness of
[50:30] that what will happen to us what what
[50:33] happened to that
[50:34] man brother BR
[50:38] says there was a couple that got
[50:44] married the woman she was a really a
[50:47] strong Christian an oldfashioned
[50:50] Christian and the young man was a young
[50:53] new a new
[50:55] believer
[50:58] and when they got married the young lady
[50:59] said to her
[51:01] husband I want you to know
[51:04] something if you ever
[51:10] backslide I want you to know that I'll
[51:11] be here at home waiting for
[51:14] you I I love you and I'll receive you
[51:18] I'll take you back don't go anywhere
[51:21] else you come back home I'll be here
[51:23] waiting for
[51:25] you the young man told his fellow
[51:28] workers this is what my wife told
[51:33] me how could I ever do anything
[51:37] wrong when she trusts me so
[51:40] much I believe that when we can
[51:42] understand
[51:44] this how will we ever break or violate
[51:47] that
[51:48] trust see he trusts
[51:51] me he trust
[51:53] you that when this inside man comes out
[51:58] this inside that body the outside man
[52:03] and he trusts
[52:05] us you can live in that body of
[52:08] sin but you're going to be
[52:11] manifested my image will be reflected
[52:13] through your life I trust
[52:16] you that you're going to do the
[52:18] right you're going to follow my
[52:20] word this is
[52:23] beautiful let's look
[52:25] now Romans
[52:29] 6:12 if you're understanding a little
[52:31] bit up to now say
[52:33] Amen Romans
[52:36] 612 excuse me Romans
[52:40] 512 you see why I don't even trust
[52:44] myself
[52:47] [Music]
[52:48] wherefore as by one man sin entered into
[52:51] the
[52:55] world
[52:58] and death by sin and so death passed
[53:00] upon all men for that all have
[53:04] sinned how did or how did Sin enter
[53:10] in where where did Sin enter
[53:15] into the Bible
[53:19] says see sin entered into the
[53:24] world this is the world
[53:27] where did the sin where did Sin enter in
[53:30] or to
[53:33] what into the
[53:35] world is that
[53:37] right what is
[53:40] sin
[53:42] unbelief and it has a life has a
[53:47] spirit has a spirit that's going to end
[53:49] but yet it has a
[53:51] life so then the the
[53:54] spirit entered into the world
[53:59] when you come out of your mother's
[54:01] womb what do you enter
[54:03] into to the
[54:06] world and what's waiting for you is a
[54:09] spirit and whose spirit is this it's
[54:12] Spirit of the
[54:13] world because it's in the world is that
[54:18] right it's the
[54:20] life this life was
[54:22] permitted it's God's permissive
[54:25] will it's that God
[54:27] permitted for
[54:30] humankind to populate the
[54:33] world you're you and I are of them
[54:37] through a permissive
[54:38] will and when we come to this
[54:41] world we're all
[54:44] liars
[54:46] theves
[54:49] Killers that's the nature that's in
[54:52] US each and every one of
[54:55] us
[54:57] sin entered into the
[54:58] world unbelief entered into the
[55:01] world and it you have
[55:04] to needs a body to
[55:07] live and it's waiting for that human
[55:09] being's body to be to
[55:12] live blessed be the name of but thanks
[55:15] be to God that the sin entered by one
[55:19] man but also by one man is sin taken
[55:24] away let's read Psalms 51
[55:29] 15 I trust that you're writing down the
[55:38] scriptures behold I was shapen in
[55:41] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[55:43] conceive
[55:45] me how many of
[55:49] you believe that you have
[55:54] sinned brother bam on page
[56:04] 501 some people say well now here's a
[56:07] good little girl or boy they never sin
[56:09] to begin
[56:13] with but you're born in sin to begin
[56:18] with shaped in
[56:22] iniquity come to the world speaking
[56:25] lies
[56:27] when you're born in this
[56:28] world you're a
[56:30] liar you're a thief you're
[56:35] everything everything that there is all
[56:40] sin you're not a liar a thief because
[56:43] you
[56:45] stole you're not a liar because you told
[56:47] a
[56:51] lie that Spirit that's in you when you
[56:53] were
[56:55] born because you're of the
[56:59] world that's the reason you why you
[57:01] can't have
[57:05] Reformation you've got to die and be
[57:07] born
[57:11] again you can't have a birth without
[57:16] crucifixion now I asked this
[57:20] question was Jesus Christ
[57:22] crucified yes or
[57:24] no you're a little now aren't you answer
[57:28] please yes or
[57:30] no was Jesus Christ
[57:37] crucified when he was crucified did he
[57:39] go smiling to the
[57:41] Cross how did he get to the
[57:45] Cross how was he able to get to the
[57:48] Cross he was God's
[57:50] love but if I understand the
[57:54] Bible he knelt down
[57:59] and he said father let this cup pass
[58:01] from
[58:02] me but not my will but thy will be
[58:07] done he said he started to
[58:11] sweat and his sweat was as great drops
[58:13] of
[58:15] blood it was not an easy
[58:20] thing to make that decision to go to
[58:24] Calvary because he was going to to be
[58:29] crucified when we're speaking about the
[58:32] crucifixion this is the
[58:35] body that must be
[58:39] crucified in order for for for the
[58:45] death in order for the death of the
[58:47] nature of that
[58:50] spirit because what actually controls
[58:52] you is what's inside
[58:55] you you have to
[58:57] die you have to be
[59:01] crucified and you're not going to want
[59:02] to be crucified because you want only if
[59:05] you hear the
[59:06] gospel you hear understand the Plan of
[59:08] Salvation and when you do understand
[59:13] it you then know that you have to be
[59:18] crucified many people want to be born
[59:20] again but they don't want to be crfi
[59:22] brother
[59:25] says
[59:28] you need a a crucifixion in order to
[59:30] have a
[59:33] birth you cannot have a new birth except
[59:35] there be a
[59:36] crucifixion
[59:38] where in
[59:40] Christ in
[59:42] Christ so then what starts to form is an
[59:47] angel a
[59:51] messenger the prophet says that when
[59:52] we're
[59:53] born in the natural birth
[59:56] he says there is a spirit to enter into
[59:59] US says it's an
[1:00:01] angel and this
[1:00:03] Angel it's going to speak is going going
[1:00:07] to do the things of the world because
[1:00:09] he's of the world yes
[1:00:11] sir when you're born again the angel
[1:00:14] comes Jesus Christ inside of you and it
[1:00:18] starts to
[1:00:19] form he brings everything under
[1:00:22] suggestion first of all there must be a
[1:00:24] crucifixion in order for that angel
[1:00:27] Jesus Christ to come inside of
[1:00:30] us Prophet
[1:00:34] says man when he's born he's got a
[1:00:36] spirit in
[1:00:38] him and it's the spirit of that he has
[1:00:40] in him is of the
[1:00:42] world it's the spirit of the God of this
[1:00:48] world you forgive
[1:00:53] me that's why you can get a pig and you
[1:00:56] bathe them wash them
[1:00:57] up to put a little ribbon on that
[1:01:03] pig but he's going to go to the mud
[1:01:05] power as soon as he can because that his
[1:01:08] nature because the nature that's in
[1:01:11] him we've gone down the wrong
[1:01:14] road we're trying to pick clean up the
[1:01:18] P before changing his
[1:01:24] nature we have to teach man and women
[1:01:26] that the spirit that they have in them
[1:01:27] is of the world it's of the
[1:01:30] devil the spirit that man has that from
[1:01:33] the smallest baby the spirit that he has
[1:01:36] is of the
[1:01:37] devil but God's word says that the blood
[1:01:41] of Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ cleanses him until the age of
[1:01:47] accountability but he has to come to a
[1:01:49] repentance that's the first step
[1:01:52] barely that's barely the first step the
[1:01:55] second
[1:01:58] along with it of course is to be
[1:01:59] baptized in water and then
[1:02:01] what to be before
[1:02:04] him and saying to him change change my
[1:02:08] nature change my
[1:02:10] spirit make me a new creature in Christ
[1:02:14] Jesus because until we have that change
[1:02:16] of
[1:02:17] nature we don't have God in us in
[1:02:21] US you might have him above us but not
[1:02:24] in US
[1:02:26] the prophet
[1:02:28] says when a man's
[1:02:32] born he's born with the spirit of the
[1:02:34] world in
[1:02:37] him that's the reason why he's got to be
[1:02:39] born
[1:02:41] again because this
[1:02:43] Spirit comes from a
[1:02:47] conception and he can't live ABS no way
[1:02:50] he can live
[1:02:52] forever then he's got to be born again
[1:02:56] every man has to be born
[1:02:59] again no matter if he's a high priest
[1:03:02] he's a bishop he's a pope whatever he
[1:03:07] is he's just as guilty as the next
[1:03:10] man he has to be born
[1:03:13] again brother Bram
[1:03:16] says they ask him a question say brother
[1:03:18] Bram I want all the young to not
[1:03:24] this
[1:03:31] brother bam will all the Sons and
[1:03:33] Daughters of true Born Again CHR
[1:03:34] Believers be
[1:03:41] saved in other words if your parents are
[1:03:43] true Born Again
[1:03:44] Christians see that's what makes a man a
[1:03:47] new
[1:03:48] person because he's born again
[1:03:54] Reborn
[1:03:59] his first birth brings him a natural man
[1:04:01] of on
[1:04:06] Earth his second birth brings him a
[1:04:08] spiritual man of
[1:04:09] Heaven see it changes
[1:04:12] him changes his
[1:04:16] form not his outward
[1:04:23] conscience not his five outside
[1:04:27] senses but his inward part his desire
[1:04:31] what motivates
[1:04:33] him has been changed to
[1:04:41] God why don't you take your Bibles now
[1:04:43] so we can tie
[1:04:45] together with what the prophet says be
[1:04:47] in first
[1:04:49] Corinthians chapter
[1:04:54] 15 Prophet says here that the soul is
[1:05:01] changed the prophet says that it's the
[1:05:03] soul that's changed how many of you
[1:05:04] believe that it's a soul that's
[1:05:07] changed 1 Corinthians
[1:05:09] 15 verse
[1:05:14] 47 first man is of the earth
[1:05:19] earthy the second man is the Lord From
[1:05:23] Heaven which is the second man
[1:05:29] now remember I told you
[1:05:31] earlier that the birth that
[1:05:34] was that was performed when it was new
[1:05:36] bir that an angel came and it was the
[1:05:40] Lord now I want you to notice the first
[1:05:44] man is is from whom from
[1:05:47] where is from the
[1:05:50] earth the second man is from
[1:05:54] her from heaven
[1:05:56] from
[1:05:58] Heaven is the Lord is the Lord
[1:06:06] is when Jesus Christ was
[1:06:08] born he was born in a
[1:06:13] manger he came forth from Mary's
[1:06:16] womb he was God's gift to
[1:06:20] us how many of you accept that Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ was God's gift to
[1:06:24] us
[1:06:26] have you ever given someone a
[1:06:29] present what must you do when you buy
[1:06:31] somebody a
[1:06:33] present you wrap
[1:06:36] it that's why they wrapped Jesus right
[1:06:39] away in a swaddling
[1:06:45] clothing a very cloth that he used to
[1:06:48] clean the sweat off animal that's what
[1:06:50] the prophet
[1:06:53] said that we have a fi stinking
[1:06:57] stable yet he wants to come to that
[1:06:59] stable he wants to come to this table he
[1:07:02] went to that
[1:07:04] table way he was wrapped up in swen
[1:07:07] clothing he wants to come to
[1:07:09] you but you have to
[1:07:11] die in order for him to come to
[1:07:14] you the Bible
[1:07:19] says as is Earthly such are they also
[1:07:22] that are
[1:07:24] Earthly and as is the Heavenly such are
[1:07:27] they also that are
[1:07:34] Heavenly and as we we have borne the
[1:07:36] image of the Earthly we shall also bear
[1:07:38] the image of the
[1:07:42] Heavenly we see then that the first
[1:07:44] man is of the
[1:07:47] Earth the second man is from
[1:07:50] Heaven is the
[1:07:52] Lord when there is a new birth
[1:07:56] the prophet says like
[1:07:57] this what starts to
[1:08:01] form the Lord starts to form in
[1:08:04] you growing more and more more and more
[1:08:08] the Lord in
[1:08:09] you he is that
[1:08:12] angel so he is the
[1:08:14] messenger then what you
[1:08:17] speak what he wants you to
[1:08:21] speak who's the one that brings the
[1:08:23] messenger messages not the messenger
[1:08:28] means
[1:08:29] messenger when a person's been born
[1:08:32] again you know right away if you've been
[1:08:34] born
[1:08:36] again because the one that's speaking in
[1:08:38] him is then the angel Jesus
[1:08:41] Christ the prophet says there's been a
[1:08:44] change the soul has to be
[1:08:48] changed the word par means
[1:08:53] what to change from one form to
[1:08:58] another this will help you so you won't
[1:09:00] get
[1:09:02] confused the prophet says it changes him
[1:09:05] changes his
[1:09:06] soul it changes his
[1:09:09] nature changes his
[1:09:12] desires what what motivates
[1:09:16] him brother tells
[1:09:20] me please pray for me or or or teach
[1:09:23] such and such because he wants to
[1:09:26] he wants to
[1:09:27] smoke that's what's inside him that's
[1:09:29] what motivates don't worry about
[1:09:33] it about the smoking and the
[1:09:36] drink worry about
[1:09:38] that there can come a change Trans in
[1:09:41] the heart then the spirit
[1:09:44] change something else will motivate that
[1:09:46] man the things of the
[1:09:49] Lord Prophet
[1:09:52] says that the word
[1:09:54] birth
[1:09:56] means uh New
[1:09:59] Creation so when you're born
[1:10:02] again a new creation has to come
[1:10:07] about and youve been born of the new
[1:10:09] Original
[1:10:10] Seed not through sex
[1:10:14] anymore that's why we have two parts
[1:10:17] of even though we have been born
[1:10:21] again this body that you see right
[1:10:23] here came through through
[1:10:26] sex but this which is in here
[1:10:29] inside did not come through
[1:10:31] sex and sooner
[1:10:33] Orly I'm
[1:10:37] toh and I'm going to
[1:10:40] dress if it be so that I be not far
[1:10:43] naked I have dressed myself with the
[1:10:47] word that theop body is that word
[1:10:51] body if I'm wrapping myself dressing
[1:10:53] myself with the
[1:10:54] word
[1:10:55] then there's a body waiting for I'll
[1:10:58] drop this robe of
[1:10:59] flesh but until that day
[1:11:01] comes we're
[1:11:04] walking two ber two Ernie two
[1:11:07] person I can see two right
[1:11:13] two and then we get shook up sometime
[1:11:15] when we don't know
[1:11:16] this sometimes brother sticks
[1:11:19] us he gets a little
[1:11:22] sticky he said the deacon
[1:11:26] that holy
[1:11:28] man it's not the inside
[1:11:31] man it's that outside man that's scking
[1:11:34] you and that won't go away until the
[1:11:38] resurrection when he sens up a little
[1:11:41] it's when the water comes you want
[1:11:44] water the water comes upon
[1:11:47] Him above that blessed
[1:11:52] Soul oh I can see nothing but angels but
[1:11:55] if no water comes to him no water drop
[1:11:58] on him several days go by without no
[1:12:01] water it's a little
[1:12:05] sticky very well the
[1:12:07] prophet continue
[1:12:09] on can you wait for a few more minutes
[1:12:13] I'm almost
[1:12:14] done Prophet
[1:12:17] says my
[1:12:22] Lord I was that I had to go
[1:12:26] scriptures let's go to Second
[1:12:27] Corinthians chapter
[1:12:29] 5 to confirm what we're speaking right
[1:12:33] now so please
[1:12:36] brother when it's the outside man that
[1:12:38] does
[1:12:40] something don't blame the that's on the
[1:12:43] inside am all right if we believe the
[1:12:48] word if it be so that he was born
[1:12:51] again I'm speaking about Born Again
[1:12:54] people
[1:12:56] I'm not speaking about those that had
[1:12:57] not yet been born again and yet they
[1:12:59] want to cover themselves with
[1:13:01] religion I'm speaking about those that
[1:13:02] have been born
[1:13:04] again second Corinthians
[1:13:08] 5:17 now if there be any man being any
[1:13:11] any man be in
[1:13:16] Christ When sin entered into what to the
[1:13:21] world when you were
[1:13:24] born
[1:13:26] there was that what was is of the world
[1:13:27] was waiting for you what did you enter
[1:13:31] into what did you enter into into the
[1:13:34] world and that which is of the
[1:13:38] world and embrace goes kiss and say come
[1:13:41] here honey you're mine is that
[1:13:46] right and for years we tried to reform
[1:13:49] and
[1:13:50] reform you can't reform
[1:13:53] anybody it has to be a crucifix
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:57] to be a
[1:13:58] killing has to die in order to be born
[1:14:01] again and then when you're born
[1:14:04] again if any man be in
[1:14:06] Christ where in what in Christ
[1:14:12] ah in the heart now this is where Christ
[1:14:15] enters in what controls
[1:14:18] you being in
[1:14:20] Christ he is a new
[1:14:23] creature all old things are passed
[1:14:28] away behold all things are become
[1:14:31] new how many of you believe this say
[1:14:35] Amen how many of you believe you're real
[1:14:38] good isn't it true that some of us do
[1:14:40] believe that we real we make a
[1:14:43] profession confession of
[1:14:45] faith I accept Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ you and you cross
[1:14:51] yourself I get baptized I've never
[1:14:54] smoked
[1:14:55] I never drank I never
[1:15:00] stole I never broke one
[1:15:05] commandment if you want to know it I'm
[1:15:07] just like that Young Rich Young that met
[1:15:09] Jesus I've
[1:15:12] kept all the Lord's commandments you'll
[1:15:15] forgive me that's how a lot of them are
[1:15:19] because they told me said brother I I
[1:15:22] never Dr I never committ adultery
[1:15:27] now let's follow that thought for about
[1:15:28] 10
[1:15:28] minutes Romans
[1:15:31] 1022 322 of
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:37] Romans even the righteousness of God
[1:15:39] which is by faith of Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ unto all that believe that
[1:15:44] believe for there is no
[1:15:46] difference Pope even the bishop even the
[1:15:50] pastor this is for
[1:15:53] whosoever for all have
[1:15:57] sinned and come short of the glory of
[1:16:00] God for all
[1:16:02] have we born we will have all
[1:16:06] sinned first
[1:16:10] john8 if we
[1:16:19] say if we say that we have no sin we
[1:16:21] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[1:16:23] in US think of
[1:16:32] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:16:34] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:16:36] cleanse us from all
[1:16:43] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:16:45] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:16:47] word is not in
[1:16:49] us now turn with
[1:16:52] us to First John 3 3
[1:16:57] n and you'll see that it looks like it
[1:16:59] contradicts
[1:17:12] itself whosoever is born of God does not
[1:17:15] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[1:17:18] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[1:17:22] God so which one's right then
[1:17:28] they're both
[1:17:32] right if I understand the
[1:17:35] word I was born of
[1:17:38] God and I do not
[1:17:41] sin I cannot
[1:17:44] sin what is
[1:17:46] sin
[1:17:48] unbelief God said something I say
[1:17:53] Amen because the seed his seed is in
[1:17:56] me which seed is in
[1:17:58] me what's the subject
[1:18:02] title The Original
[1:18:05] Seed where is that in my
[1:18:08] mind in the heart is that
[1:18:12] right so then that
[1:18:15] seed was in
[1:18:18] me since I was born it
[1:18:21] was but there had to be a death person
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:26] in order for that life that was in me to
[1:18:28] verse
[1:18:30] four so then it was the
[1:18:32] original how can I then
[1:18:35] sin but it says
[1:18:38] here and if anyone say we have not
[1:18:40] sinned we make him a liar because there
[1:18:43] are people that they think they're real
[1:18:48] good and they don't come to the Lord
[1:18:50] because they said I never smoke drank or
[1:18:51] committed
[1:18:53] adulter
[1:18:55] but to begin with you were born in
[1:18:58] sin as soon as you were born you were a
[1:19:01] bunch of
[1:19:03] sin if you say you have not
[1:19:05] been you make him a
[1:19:08] liar say the b say you were born in
[1:19:11] sin let's
[1:19:14] look allow me to see if I can
[1:19:18] finish Prophet says given the
[1:19:20] interpretation what we've
[1:19:23] spoken he said what is
[1:19:26] sin say
[1:19:30] unbelief there's only one
[1:19:32] sin and that's
[1:19:37] unbelief he that believeth not is
[1:19:39] condemned
[1:19:41] already and he's quoting Mark
[1:19:43] 16 go into all the
[1:19:46] world preach the gospel to Every
[1:19:48] Creature he that believeth and is
[1:19:51] baptized shall be
[1:19:53] saved he that believe not it's condemned
[1:19:57] already so they don't
[1:20:00] believe that's a person's
[1:20:02] condemnation because if they do
[1:20:05] believe they know that they're born in
[1:20:08] sin they know that they have to be born
[1:20:11] again they know that they have to be die
[1:20:13] to the
[1:20:15] world they know that that he knows that
[1:20:17] the spirit that he has in him is of the
[1:20:19] world he knows that the life that he has
[1:20:21] in him is of the
[1:20:23] world he knows that in the
[1:20:27] beginning it was a unbelief that brought
[1:20:30] sin to the world but he also know God
[1:20:33] sent his original SE Jesus Christ to die
[1:20:39] to redeem us to give us an opportunity
[1:20:42] to be born again not through
[1:20:45] sex but through the
[1:20:48] word in order to have a new spirit and
[1:20:51] where is that new spirit going to
[1:20:53] be in the heart he said how is it that
[1:20:56] the Bible
[1:20:58] says he'll give us a new
[1:21:00] heart is he going to give take away the
[1:21:03] heart give us a heart it out
[1:21:06] no the same
[1:21:08] heart but he
[1:21:11] changes and God SE bir
[1:21:13] for changes the
[1:21:15] nature new spirit a new
[1:21:20] desire that's a new creature in Christ
[1:21:22] Jesus now
[1:21:25] the prophet
[1:21:28] says give the interpretation to the
[1:21:30] scripture I just finished
[1:21:33] reading first
[1:21:35] John uh 38 and
[1:21:39] 10 that's Paul that's
[1:21:45] speaking in order for you to understand
[1:21:47] I'll just explain it to you a
[1:21:51] little now he's saying here that in me
[1:21:53] are two persons
[1:21:56] one that wants to do
[1:21:58] good and the other one wants to do
[1:22:05] evil whenever I try to do good there's
[1:22:07] evil they're hindering me isn't that
[1:22:12] tremendous now you're an outside
[1:22:15] man is controlled by
[1:22:17] senses and there is an inside
[1:22:21] man is controlled that that he's
[1:22:23] controlled by faith
[1:22:27] now Jesus Christ said made a
[1:22:31] statement and when Jesus Christ make the
[1:22:34] statement the inside man says
[1:22:37] amen the outside man he starts to
[1:22:40] reason that's not
[1:22:42] right so
[1:22:45] then just ignore the outside
[1:22:48] man and accept the Inside
[1:22:53] Man
[1:22:55] now I'm reading on page uh 1148 from
[1:22:57] conduct order and
[1:22:59] Doctrine now that's Paul himself that's
[1:23:04] speaking it says that he was stld into
[1:23:06] the law of slavery of the of the
[1:23:09] world of the flesh we're all been done
[1:23:11] the same
[1:23:14] way that's the reason why we all have
[1:23:16] have all kinds of
[1:23:18] sin adultery and all kinds of things in
[1:23:20] our Liv all of these
[1:23:23] things we are
[1:23:26] carnal that part must
[1:23:29] perish but then inside we are a
[1:23:33] spirit Soul
[1:23:35] inside that's faith in God's
[1:23:41] word then we bring our outside body
[1:23:43] under subjection to the word by
[1:23:49] faith how can I take a Cocker and make a
[1:23:51] grain of wheat out of
[1:23:53] it it's impossible possible for me to do
[1:23:55] it the only way it can be
[1:23:58] done is because it's on the inside of
[1:24:00] the
[1:24:03] cockle in other words from that
[1:24:06] cocko a
[1:24:13] wheat in other words a germ called the
[1:24:16] wheat of
[1:24:19] life then you bury that
[1:24:22] Cocker and it'll produce a grain of
[1:24:27] wheat that's why Paul said I am
[1:24:29] crucified together with Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ you have to keep that cocko bird
[1:24:39] buried so that that life of God
[1:24:43] tweet because if it be that
[1:24:50] way see a grain of wheat has been placed
[1:24:52] inside that Cocker
[1:24:55] and the
[1:24:58] life and the life the spirit of that
[1:25:01] Cocker has been cast
[1:25:03] out when I was born I was born in
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:07] sin Co on the outside and on the
[1:25:12] inside but one day I understood that I
[1:25:14] was a
[1:25:16] sinner I understood that I was born in
[1:25:20] sin I understood that it did not come
[1:25:22] the original way
[1:25:28] I understood that sin entered into the
[1:25:30] world because of Adam's
[1:25:31] unbelief when I understood that I
[1:25:34] surrendered myself to him and I died
[1:25:37] when I
[1:25:38] died then there was a new bird and what
[1:25:42] is it
[1:25:43] then it's a bird walking through
[1:25:45] the
[1:25:47] Earth but it's not the life of a
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] it's the life of a queak living
[1:25:55] inside blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:25:57] let me go and let me finish it
[1:26:00] now how can I take a cocko bur and make
[1:26:04] a grain of wheat out of
[1:26:07] it it's impossible for me to do
[1:26:10] it see there's a life inside that cocko
[1:26:14] bir in in order for me to convert
[1:26:18] it to change it I have to take the light
[1:26:21] of the cocko
[1:26:23] away
[1:26:25] when we born we have the spirit of the
[1:26:28] world how can I
[1:26:30] change the life in me this of the
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:35] world like take that life out the
[1:26:38] world put a new
[1:26:41] life put Jesus Christ inside of
[1:26:44] me is him
[1:26:47] living you see a CO
[1:26:50] outside you see a man who can get sick I
[1:26:54] can get this of me etal life Jesus
[1:27:01] CHR now
[1:27:03] notice if you put a a
[1:27:07] germ called qu of
[1:27:11] life then you bury that cocko
[1:27:13] bir some day they might kill me and
[1:27:16] they'll bury a cocko
[1:27:18] bir
[1:27:21] when
[1:27:23] G mind is not my
