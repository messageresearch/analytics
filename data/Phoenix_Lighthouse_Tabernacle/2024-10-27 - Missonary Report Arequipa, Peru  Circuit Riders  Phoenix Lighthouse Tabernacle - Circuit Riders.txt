know here the little one is with their parents I would like for the grandparents to come up as well all four of the grandparents Sarah Elizabeth lope the baby little one's name is Sarah Elizabeth lope she was born the 18 of September of 2024 Antonio Sarah Lopez the parents are Antonio and Sarah Lopez and here are the grandparents on behalf of the mother brother and sister Blan on behalf of the dad our brothers and Lopez as I tell you for me it is an honor here there are four grandparents and I almost consider myself a grandparent as well I would like to make you nervous or make myself nervous but brother Bram preached a message but she titled token there in five letters as brother Bram says in Spanish it's five letters and it's the same in English and there in that message brother presents several children girls and four boys brother Bram presents and here thanks to God it's only one of them brother says the following in one of quotes he says you gave her this child to raise in another one he says you plac them under their care and they know that they are insufficient without your help well I thought I had my Bible in hand but I left it back there but I'll tell you the verses from memory as I have Mark 10 says but when Jesus says not the little children to come for such is the kingdom of God and I like how it says in Proverbs 176 Mar Mark is the scripture so we know where we get presenting the children from in Proverbs 176 it says it says the children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers I'm not under appreciating the Spanish version children's children but in English it says children's children that includes grandchildren and granddaughters so in this morning as I told you for me it's a privilege to present this little one the only thing that I can say is may God bless this little one when my grandson was born he now he's now 21 years old all I asked of God I told my son-in-law God give you wisdom to guide this little one and it's the same that I tell you God give you wisdom to guide this little one and she's never alone and neither are you and I said here are the grandparents but I would like the [Music] uncle our had to take this little one in his arms not to give it to Grand one grandpa or the other and not for me to grab it as well and I ask I believe he has quite the experience and I know the brother and sanca are the first grandparents brother they already have several grandchildren so the only thing I can say is God bless you we'll be praying for this little one Heavenly Father you know all things insufficient to raise our children without your help I ask for this little one Sarah Elizabeth Sarah Elizabeth sah I looked for what Sarah means Sarah is prin Sarah is princess princess Antonio isita she is the princess of Antonio and Sarah and now she is a queen she was a princess now she's a queen with her little princess you give them all the correct guidance mainly the parents and the family that surrounds her our brother Alfredo in your representation has this little one bless her bless the whole family ask in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you and take

hallu [Music] spee [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] as our brother Eli says it is always good to be home as we all know we were in the country of Peru accompanying our pastor and something that was outstanding the Apostle of the Lord says our brother Bernie G Garcia he says we are a tsunami says we are a Revival doesn't matter where you go doesn't matter where you are we are a Revival he says and why do I call it a tsunami because a tsunami in nature when there's a tsunami in the ocean it's to cleanse all the filth that's inside of it it's to take all the filth to the surface and as I tell you Brothers we represent a fivefold Ministry we move under an apostasy and not just any Apostle the greatest Apostle of the 21st century you want to believe it or not his name is the Reverend Bernie G gar the founding pastor of Phoenix Lighthouse [Music] Tabernacle don't fail to put emphasis on this he is the founding this is his vision his vision is Phoenix Lighthouse Tabernacle he is the founder him he did his first service he called it in this manner and a very peculiar thing he said when God gave him the vision he gave him a dream as well he says and there was a lighthouse and there Sparks of fire came towards the whole world so we are that Revival we are that tsunami doesn't matter where we go the Lord makes himself manif we don't represent ourselves the my pastor doesn't represent him we represent a fivefold Ministry you our brother bam said that the fivefold ministry is is is for the Perfection of the Saints and the only perfect on is the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so if you want to recognize a or you don't want to recognize it that's that's all right but the Apostle Paul says it's for the Perfection of the Saints and you remember brother brandham he said if the Paul if Pauls go in so will mine because I have only repeated what Apostle Paul what he has said and here is the echo he said my voice along the prophet of the age will continue repeating continue being an echo of what he already in that day there will be no exit you won't say that it was ignorance before the angel he led us a paved path he La us thousands of books for which we should should live according to what he preached not say it not say he's my Apostle my Apostle live those tapes live that Ministry represented it with dignity don't bring it amongst your shoes or kicking it around Lift It Up Lift It Up May the whole world see who your tutor is who is your Apostle who is your pastor and your life will reflect what you were taught we know that we're learning day by day SC says that faith on faith Revelation Revelation I with all of my heart that we have a mature Ministry a mature Ministry that wherever we go the best effort that's made is to lift up to lift up the name of Lord J as the only Savior and Lord so now I ask that you please stand we're going to open up our scriptures to Genesis 1:1 in Peru the theme of the convention in Peru in in aripa is the power of the blood how many believe that the blood has power and the scripture reads the following in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light let us go to verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind who SE in itself upon the Earth and it was so John 129 the next day John see Jesus coming unto him and [Music] says Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world let us bow our heads beloved and good Heavenly Father Lord thank you for for your blessings thank you for your grace Lord because your mercy is on you every morning thank you Lord because it pleased you not only to send a redeemer but to send a restorer and likewise father father that sent us an apostle that preached in our language and for setting as a pastor Heavenly Father a faithful Soldier that's been instructed Faith have a mature Ministry in his surroundings Lord what else can we ask for you've given us all the Weaponry you've give us all the equipment we can't fail on that day we can't say that we like this or that because you've given us a perfect team and it's so perfect because you are the general Lord we ask for your guidance more of your holy spirit that every step we take every word we speak may always be you the one that comes forward we place this report in your hands in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may take your seats uh good morning Brothers God bless you uh first I'd like to thank my pastor for allowing me to go on this trip and my my dad my Theo and brother Danny brother Danny's Pastor team I would like to share a little of my experience when I went it wasn't what I expected it was different the brothers the buildings the brothers were so loving and kind you can just feel how loving they are towards everyone the attitude the brothers have they are willing to learn and they want to hug and talk to you and learn whatever they can from you it was very scary when I had to go up and greet the brothers I didn't think I was able to do it then I saw the brothers singing and dancing in the spirit you you just feel how happy they were and after the services me my dad and brother Danny had took candy for the little kids and it felt so rewarding to pass out the candy everyone wanted the candy even the older sisters and it felt bad to tell the kids sorry but it was a very good experience for me and I would like to go back and I would like to thank my pastor for this opportunity God bless you [Applause] God bless you Brothers it's always good to be in the house of the Lord it's always good to greet you and I've said it many times it doesn't matter where one wants to run to when God has a calling for you doesn't matter where you run to God will bring you back sooner or later you have a calling on behalf of the Lord if it's the Lord that's calling you this morning you feel that pull in your heart the reason you feel that pull in your heart is because it's the Lord calling you you are blessed not just anybody has that there are many people that would like to have what you have we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he knows what he's doing and he calls his own when he calls you and you submit to that calling or you heed to that calling that is the best experience that you can have surrender to the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ brother bham says he says receiving the Holy Spirit he said it's better than any amusement part now I started thinking at myself because me by the the grace of God I had the opportunity to take my my family to several amusement parks and you enjoy it I used to ask myself for many years when I was a child my parents would take us to certain places for example they would take us to the Sea and I would ask well what did they get out of it what do they have fun if they don't get in the ocean or the water until I became a father and then I understood that when you see that you can make your children happy it's a satisfaction for oneself now imagine God when he sees that his children are receiving of his holy spirit you can receive God in your heart and you feel that Joy inside of your heart and you can ask well what is God doing there's my daughter there's my son they're receiving of my spirit they're receiving from me and that is the reason why we go out to share with the people what God has given us and not only us that are here but what he's given to each one of you the only reason that you're sitting here in this morning because you have a part of God inside of you or else you wouldn't be here there's many people that would like to be here but they're not here because they don't have what you have so I think my pastor it's always a privilege to travel with him and travel with the team this time I was very happy I say because I don't want to break down but my brother and my son went and forgive me brothers and it's the best experience of my life when you can leave something for your children now I understand a bit of my father when I began preaching he came and he told me several times he said son I am very proud of you and what better gift can you leave behind for your children when you can see that they serve God that you project that life to them and that's the best that one can do the screen appears not on see but we went to if you could please continue with the presentation that right there Isa it's a very beautiful city it's very picturesque it's very Colonial the brothers have gone they can appreciate that there's a lot of Tourism there there's a lot of attractions but you know what is the main attraction is the children of the Lord Jesus Christ there there is seed that serve God and that's the reason why we continue to go there the topic was the power of the blood There Is Power in the Blood now imagine when you apply that blood that blood that blood is building and Alive the blood of Emanuel does not dry up it has power power to do what power to forgive your sins to cleanse everything that you have and that blood is still alive still alive inside of you when you're born again that is what God wants for each one of us on Thursday I fell our lot to be at the local church of our brother kpe my brother went up to give a couple of greetings my brother and his son were there as well and then our pastor went up representing each one of you he was happy to be there and to have that expectation of what God had for them do you know this morning God has something for you only just open up your heart only reason we don't receive blessings is because we're holding God back but if we could only just open up our hearts and you'll see what he can give you this is the pastor and his wife our sister Elsa and our brother Christal this is in the auditorium that they rent each time that I go they've been renting it for quite some time there's a lot of people fit in there and people go searching out and knowing that they will receive what they have been expecting here's theorum before the services begin here it is at night and it f the law of our brother Danny to open up on Friday and he did a very good job and I've already told him personally but I believe that one grow spiritually one begins to mature and begin to display more of what God has and here is the auditorium there's our brother arano Marcos Marcos Aran brother Marcos arano is Mex he is from Mexico yeah he was there as well he also sings very beautifully and then he's also from Gomez which is where I was born that's why perhaps I feel affection for the sons of God but when they're fellow when they're fellow people from where you're from you feel different like our brother says these brothers are from C and from St Louis as well he says what's going on buddy it's an affection when you meet somebody that's from where you're from and it felt this young man's lot to open up name a bit difficult and our brother also fell his lot to speak that was Saturday morning this is another Pastor excuse me for the names brother sanago Rees then the team was ready for what the people were expecting or waiting for so when people are that in expectation so they can receive what they need likewise where you're in expectation you can receive what God has for you my son went forward to greet the people as he said he was very nervous and after greeting the people the people applauded and he's surprised as to why they did that because when you see somebody stand for the word it's not easy to stand this is the first time that he did it and it was full of so it's needed on behalf of God for you to be able to do that and that's why I am proud of him and I come and told him I said those are the one of the proudest moments of my life now I can understand each one of you that your children have stood behind this Pulpit you feel so much pride you feel so happy they're following along in what we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ in his condescendence sending a prophet and then sending us an apostle and when you point them towards the correct line then one feels that gratefulness then our brother Danny went up and then again and our brother my brother went up as well picture and we fell my lot to speak for five minutes and then it was our pastor the people were ready ready they were all in expectation need just a little bit of a push to be able to go into that spiritual Kingdom spiritual realm you need to be there but you need a preparation when you arrive then you can step inside says that when Moses he says take the sandals off your feet because you're stepping on Holy Ground he says that he turned into a St of an ecstasy because it's beyond that curtain of time there's curtains there's doors there's places where there in itself and you just open it up you open up that Dimension enter inside that Dimension so then anything can happen so easy to Just Surrender to yourself enter into that spiritual realm the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ so then anything can happen but it's something so small the prayer came the people were ready receiving what they needed when people come with that expectation when they hoping they goow onto that garment that our Pastor has the prayer cloth that brother BR prayed for the people are ready that point of contact that they need and there they receive what they need it's that easy then afterwards the people began to dance in the spirit the people were so happy because they received what they received and see if they can play the video the people especially the youth I know sometimes one wants to hold back but when one finally lets loose then you're realizing that you reive that which you needed so they're dancing to thank God what he has already done for them after they crossed the Red Sea and the enemy was left behind the scripture says that Miriam got her tambourine and they begin to dance in the spirit and that is the reason why we go for them to receive what they have to receive may the Lord bless you God bless you now I can see your bright faces your smile now you can take your seat uh wherever we go uh it's always a blessing individuals that receive what they have need ofal The Misfortune individuals understand that there is someone that cares that's what we have to understand somebody cares for us then I was looking at individuals with issues an issue that they cannot overcome and uh one came to me and he had a an issue his cell phone and the cell phone looking at things he shouldn't look at and he wanted prayer the release a person can actually for one second God will restore your life I believe that with all my heart we believe a God that heals with understanding let me say it again serve a God that understands what we have need of we have need the issue is too many of us know that we're sick but we don't want to leave that atmosphere it could be drinking it could be smoking it can be a religious spirit we're all affected one by the other brother Bernie said our Apostle your decision today marks your destiny for tomorrow other words what you do today has a great impact on on what will happen with you tomorrow let me put it this way there is nothing under Heaven that is new we know that they had drugs in those days her had to bring forth of its kind don't tell me that drug wasn't there because opium is a drug and it comes from one of the oldest countries nothing changes they were remedies and people used it for their entertainment as they do today brother Bram said and I'm going to read it to you believe this with all my heart it's believe from the heart oh my soul cry Hallelujah to God when I think that God put in his church the best he could find look at your neighbor say to your neighbor I am the best God could find don't look at your shell look at what's inside your heart look at your soul this morning and you're the very best that God could produce we are the reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ today God takes his children and tests them with an acid test then he places them in the body of Christ you're going to be tested don't come to me and tell me pray for me when I know that you're going through a test I'm going to do what our Apostle did to me laughed at me when I would tell them that I'm going through a hardship in my life I can't overcome this can't overcome that and he laugh because he was aware that it's a test that each child of God will be put through a test and it's up to us to look at that test and say Lord give me sufficient Grace give me that sufficient Grace to pass through this amen he continues on they believe they went through trials they had the experience we we go through trials we have experience and the experience that you're going to have with the Lord Jesus Christ I don't hear aen on that one we either want an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ we need the experience you know I I I was reading what was on the on the um Monitor and the more I read by the blood every everything has to do with the blood of Jesus Christ is it dried how can it be dried if I'm born again and that blood is running through our veins when we're born again have the blood of Jesus Christ in your veins and people are afraid to be born again because it's a change we go through a change and the change is not that you're changing God is changing us you can't change but he surely send someone to help you during that time you're changing you become a new creation a creation with the blood of Jesus Christ this is what brother Brenham said it they are witnesses of his they know what they're talking about not just an intellectual conception not just an intellectual conception but they're born again with a relationship through the blood of Jesus Christ has been Grace all this period but we need that personal relationship every day we need to be born again then he goes on of the precious Holy Spirit but they're born again of the precious Holy Spirit and time tested and tried until their soul are the Flint Flint do you know what a flint is what's a flint we have the Flint I hear a lot of mechanics but you are this morning the Dynamics of that Flint so I want you to look at your neighbor and tell them I am the Flint I am the dyamic the dynamic is the holy spirit this morning in his children yes they are are time tested they are witnesses of his you want for us given to us prior to them going into the upper chamber they had to wait until the power the power is the Holy Spirit you can't guide it it guides you you say Amen so if we have an issue today if I have a concern today all I have to do is open up quit getting in to your Zone and feeling sorry for yourself that nobody understands quit thinking that you're the only one going through an issue I want to understand one thing if the Bible tells me something the messenger says something if our Apostle said something if I tell you something you need to follow that processing to follow the process putting you in danger har way so I tell you God one day his Mercy will stop and there won't be any more Mercy while we have mercy while Grace while the Holy Spirit is still time this world together protecting it it's time for us to say I want to serve you Lord I don't understand everything but I'm willing that distance there's many sick people a lot of sick people there A lot of marriage problems we prayed for the sick then the couples came because couples if they're not in communication if they're not talking husband wanted leaving the wife husband wanting a new wife a younger wife I don't understand the issue until D do us part you selected some elected because our Apostle joined individuals are you aware that everyone he joined together are still together and those that decided to do their thing are no longer together matter of fact they're not even in the message anymore because they failed heal to the holy spirit that told them to do something and they refused brother brandham continues he cares do you care this is us there's a lot of issues in the church all the way from suicidal to wanting to be with your friends 24 hours doing what they do brother Brenham says we believe that doctors help people I want you to listen because there's a lot of people in the message video land YouTube WhatsApp and WhatsApp whatever um whatever you want to do and whatever you say I don't know what is it called okay this media nonsense that's what I call it nonsense because before I know before I say anything they already know I mean we're sitting there Monto said this and the whole world know can't scan that Media stuff TR be crazy are you aware well I didn't know that I haven't thinking about it but I'm were you aware but brother Brenham goes on I believe that God heals by I believe God heals by medicine let me say it again God heals by medicine so if you tell me from your religious spirit God first will me medicine from those doctors that's trash here's brother Brenham saying God heals by medicine he also said if you're taking medicine continue taking that medicine even if you prayed for continue taking the medicine don't hear a lot of amens I'm gonna stay with what brother Brenham said not what I think or what another brother thinks stay with what the voice of God said God heals by surgery God heals by understanding I want you to know who said it he said it God heals by understanding God heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset uh wait one and I'll tell you who's upset there's one upset now there's two upset if I'm not careful because there's something called the devil and he brings anointing that anointing affects us all there before you know it want to hear this I'm telling you the truth you either get the truth or we're going to hell I'm just telling you what the Bible says we need to understand goes on let somebody be all upset and shows them who cares for them you're upset who's going to care for you oh the one that brought the anointing you know who that is not your brother it's a spirit and that his Spirit comes from Satan that's why I'm going to seal this I'm G to Jack him up why because we're anointed by a spirit that controls us and as long as we allow it to control us physically mentally it will hold us a prisoner Let It Go one day just a moment and see how good you feel did you feel great you know that was his character I had him laughing why he became Anointed with what with the Holy that's what our young people need it's for the holy spirit so that they can have a relationship but it starts mommy daddy with you it's not the Sunday School it's not the church starts at home he continues and he goes on God heals by love God heals by prayer God heals by God heals by God heals whatever Source it is God heals by you say amen amen it's God that heals for he said I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases what diseases do we have this morning think about it look at yourself examine what has been going on this week because we fell once doesn't mean we have to stay there if we're born again we're gonna fall it's not a picnic we're gonna get up we're gonna try again if he goes on he says and so all all of it should work together all of it should work together my prayer your prayer by Love by understanding and the man in different Ministries should work together for that I'm sorry Danny said five min we still don't understand what that is there is a head that controls that fivefold Ministry they can't do whatever they want that's the concern I've always had too many people want a fivefold Ministry and they want to do and say whatever they want to do and say it doesn't work that way all of a sudden and the man in different Ministries should work together for that are we working together that is why our Apostle said give me 10 men with the Holy Spirit I will conquer the world let me change it now he said it in the beginning toward the end he was say give me one self-sufficient end individual that I will conquer this world I don't hear amen because we hear what we want to hear you know who that is you know what church it is look at yourself say brother Bernie was talking about the lighthouse I'm not boasting I'm handing you what said work together for that see now but they don't do you know why you don't do it video I know we get a lot of hits Min minen to what because you want Power everything is based on power too many people lost for power they think there's money behind it there is no money but people lost for that power and I tell you one number one you don't believe what I'm saying go to the the message brother Bernie preached on lusting for what that's what the ministry is doing today for something they can't control let me tell you start lusting for power power you're going to receive the power Satan gives you to listen to what I'm saying what Satan gives you to do divide and conquer that's the power he gives you and as long as he can trap a minister a pastor into that the people think well that sounds good to me that's trash God sent us a prophet and that Prophet told us what we were to do examine ourselves daily Die daily and then we had by the grace of God an apostle who spoke Spanish and told us the very same thing but you know what we are we all fall into a trap look at me I don't believe like he believes yeah right I'm GNA do it God gave me a Ministry who died and made Montoya King go as God that's our attitude that same attitude will take us and separate and divide you from the Lord Jesus Christ I heard brother Brenham say I need separators the separators of the world you know what covers the world my thinking we got to go back and receive the mind of Jesus Christ I want you to stand up I'm going to stop there I'm long wind I just need a little bit of rest hours and I'll that's what I like about the mission field more so Africa you want me to preach how many hours Manny put put your fingers up so I can see them three hours at the minimum well I can do that but what's going to happen to the audience I'm going to lose them there was five of us I don't remember Danny Saturday night five we took 43 minutes or five preachers they want to know how do you do it it's simple you train the individuals to take orders have them fulfill that order if you need prayer I want you to raise your hand I mean I need prayer every day and what I want to do we're going to do this quickly but I'm going to have you come as a family what we need today of our fames I'm okay may have some problem maybe a knucklehead uh I don't know uh they call me uh every other name subborn never Smiles he always mad at the world not that's my look I wish I could have a face like chewy I wish I could have that but when I do it goes away some of you God blessed you and others like me well good luck but if you need prayer I want you to come down here I believe so much in prayer but I believe that God heals with understanding God heals with love God has a healing power this morning and as you come through with your family again like I said Ernie mon I'm gonna fall tomorrow I'm what about you as a family you can do it can they so I want you to come up like a family and if your family is not here you're by yourself then do me a favor come up by yourself it's an individual Affair we not going to take too longing we're gonna pray put our hands up there's power in God's word if the apostles would walk their Shadow heal the sick sons of God in this age the
