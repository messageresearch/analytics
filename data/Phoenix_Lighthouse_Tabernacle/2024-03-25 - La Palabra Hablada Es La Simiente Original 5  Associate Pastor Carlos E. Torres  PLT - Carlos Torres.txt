TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what is the first figure in the Zodiac the Virgin what's the last figure Leo the the first coming and the second coming of Christ all of it is written in there then the next Bible was written was in stone called pyramids God wrote In The Pyramid if you study them watch the ancient histories and Wars how they were built before the andian destruction the third was wrote on paper the Bible for the great smart intellectual world to come [Music] God has moved down to the age we're at Leo the line we're at the capping of the pyramid we're in the book of the revelations at the last chapter science says we're 3 minutes before midnight oh think of where we're at and notice let's take the pyramid it's easy runs kind of like in a triangle when we were down here beginning at the early age of the church at the Reformation in Luther's time just a man to say he was a Christian either meant his life or death they killing saying he's a Christian therefore to go through persecution every age to every time there's been persecution all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution in the age of Luther it was horrible to say a Lutheran he was considered a fanatic and could be put to death many times they killed them at Stakes burn them and everything else for lutherans then the church narrowed as like the pyramid it come into another step of Grace which was sanctification Wesley's time when he protested the angland church Tau Sanic it come into the minority again then they were called a bunch of Fanatics then how manyan Methodist or used to be or was once connect with Methodist Church half of you did you know the Methodist Church almost had the Holy Ghost one time went to Methodist churches and see him fall on the floor and throw water in face and fan him with a fan keep the holy ghost from coming on them now that's the truth down the hills of Kentucky where we had Methodist you guys are Church Jers I hear we had Methodist back there Baptist we got out the Altar and beat one another in the back till we got something we come through we live different after that but you just come up put your name on the book and say I'm a Methodist and get the salt shaker and sprink a little water on you and that's all of it going out wear shorts makeup run the horse races bet gam Place slot machines and everything else still good Methodist that's not Methodist that's just church Jers that's right Baptist the same way Presbyterian all down the same way David said grandchildren God don't have any grandchildren God never had a grandchild he's got Sons but no grandsons you and people come into the Methodist Church or Pentecostal church or Baptist Church because your mother father was Pentecostal or Baptist and your grandson they were Sons your grandsons so God don't have anything like that the church has a lot of that but not but not the not the not God doesn't now notice these on down to it comes down as it becomes to the minority the church the Pentecostal Age come in that certainly cut off a lot ofs then it what did it do it just left the Methodist and Lutheran all behind now the holy spirit's moved right on away from the Pentecostal age what did they do they organiz made themselves we are the Assemblies of God we are the Oneness we are the Tess we are the Church of God we are the this that you don't belong you can't get in heaven unless you got your name on our book oh such nonsense I don't care if you're Baptist me is Presbyterian you put your name on The Book of Life when God puts it on there if you were predestinated to eternal life God will call you some way [Music] somehow you sure will all the father has given me will come come to me no matter what church you belong to that has nothing to do with but the denomination will never do one thing to you but might hinder you a lot from going on with God but it'll never do nothing else you together with a bunch of Believers and unbelievers of course you hit that everywhere you go even had that in heaven so it's all right but you're looking to your denomination look to Jesus amen he's the one to look to now as we're coming right down to the how many I believe this woman here raised her hand that she' study the pyramid you know the PID never was capped was it never did have a cap Stone put on it they never kep even find it they don't know what ever happened to it why why was the Capstone put on the head stone the top of it because he was rejected when he come he was a rejected Stone that's right but it will be capped that's right and then those stones that fit around that headstone will have to be Stones that'll be so completely like that stone that'll fit it joint and every everywhere the pyramid is so perfect you can't run or raise your blade between them where them Stones go together such beautiful masonry some of them would weigh hundreds of tons up in the air and so perfectly set together that's why God's bringing his church we were fitly joined together am one heart and one Accord now somebody say well the Luther back there had then don't you believe it the lutherans will come forth in the resurrection just the same as the rest will come forth in the resurrection Presbyterians and all of God's children will come forth in that Resurrection that's the reason today people say oh well there will be a sweep and Revival that'll go out here and save 100 million Pentecostal will all get saved and that'll be the Rapture you're mistaken that Rapture will be hundreds of thousand that's right but there'll be a made up in 6,000 years of Salvation D 6000 years back man walks in the light as the light comes to him he crosses the bridges when he comes to them now if he refuses it then he's left in darkness but if he keeps moving on now notice then the coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand until the spirit from way down in here King just barely justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now right into the time of the coming of the head the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ until Christ and the church can unite together the same spirit the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the Life of Christ do the works of Christ believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also Jesus said that see now we going to have we got a Ministry coming it's just exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord look at it in the world today what why Cru saying and all these other great things great worldwide conflict right hand at any time could go to Power at any second that's right and if that we know that that's closed any sensible person can read in a newspaper listen to a radio or know that that is Clos well remember Christ comes for his church before that happens so how close is the coming of the Lord Jesus maybe before this meeting ends tonight we are at the end time certainly true watch the church as it's come as it moved just take it in your own mind you historians to studies history look at the Lutheran Church under justification coming just for PR from Catholicism look at it and I look at Wesley coming a little closer in the sanctification weaving theur [Music] [Applause] all [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh [Music] God bless you Brethren how many are happy to be in the house of the

presence your Holy Spirit Lord gracias thank you Father graas thank you Lord thank you we're in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] amen God bless you all this morning it's a pleasure to be in the house of the Lord before you take your seats first we'll be reading the scripture be so kind to open Genesis [Music] 1 Genesis 1:1 will continue with the topic that our pastor set for this year the spoken word is the Original Seed how many already have their scripture amen I'm trying to look if somebody's still going through their Bible trying to find it now if we don't know where Genesis is at well then let us read the scripture in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening in the morning were the first day and God add the blessing to the reading of his word kind and please take your seat down please your tell them God bless smile it's a pleasure to be able to see one another as I tell you now even our way we greet each other has changed so if it's not that way it's a fist bump five five there's no problem either way the good thing is that you bless that's what important that you also receive your blessing it's always better to give than to rece it's the law of the boxer because when you give you do with all of your heart the law written in the word of God it says that you will receive a h hundredfold what you give give love comprehension and kindness that is what you will receive or bad words or bad treatments that's where you will receive multiplied so may God help us amen like to send a special greeting to our pastor who is still outside of the country we'll continue praying for him praying for him that God take care of him and bless him but most important once he comes back he can tell us what it is that he's eating him tell us I won't tell you but let him tell us what he is our brother Elis as well may God watch over him and protect his stomach and may God give them strength Pastor stands where God's manifest his power with him that the souls may be delivered May the captives be set free the Holy Spirit fill the people and they listen the word of our pastor and say the word of God I say the word of our pastor now why do I say that because when the ministry opens up oh when the mystery opens up as Paul did when he began to speak part of the development of the thoughts of God he come and he told the Philippians he I want you think and all things true all the honest and everything that is righteous and the nice the kind I want you to think on those things then he extends a bit more says whatever things you are good report just and the God of Peace will be with you Paul goes ahead to that and he starts revealing the mystery of the deity knowing that he is placed in the body of Christ he is a prisoner of Christ he moves a bit and he says what you heard from me what you saw of [Music] me what you learned from me what you received from me do that and the God of Peace will be with you that is where the Revelation is of the time we're living in so let us continue praying for our pastor he's almost time for and it's the last part is always the hardest that's when one is most tired and it's it's more difficult to come back for being in the plane from 10 to 12 hours and you you reach a point where where no matter how you move you're not comfortable unless he gets a bed well then that's different but generally he has to pay so may God bless our pastor may continue blessing him may give him strength so let us not forget that to our visitors may God bless you welcome to the house of the Lord it's a pleasure for you to be here with us the sweet name of Lord Jesus Christ jointly with us you feel free to worship I see the brother Cooper may God bless you and his wife as well and I told him brother Cooper because I [Music] know I know brother already gave him a greeting and he says he's brother cero but it's a pleasure to have him here with us amen as well it's a pleasure for you to be here with us brother that's with our brother robs pleas that our brother's mother is still here with us and everybody else because you're part of us you're here you're here at home and our brother sister has now has been here first time may God bless her as well she has been here with us for some time now may God keep her and let's continue with the topic we've been covering but before jumping into that but first I'd like to thank all our brothers who have been helping out as you know we've been doing some remodeling here inside of the church and each one of the brothers that been here supporting God bless you may God thank you for your efforts I know someone has to make the sacrifice someone has to sacrifice themselves I know some say like yes Church got canceled again I know that some that they used to see that that word a lot in TV they say you those that come to work they say oh no it's going to get canceled again already fasting and praying Church those Brothers God has answered your prayer hopefully soon we won't have to cancel any more services we able to finish today and whatever can't be done today it could be done throughout the week so we can come back to our regular from all of our heart thank you for your [Music] efforts almost till one or the other but they've all been may God bless you for your effort may he reimburse you 100% and everything that you're doing may God multiply that's part of giving and you're doing it with all of your heart no one complains so then the blessing is yet even greater God bless you and thank you so much the spoken word is the Original Seed Isaiah 55 we already read that scripture before tell us that God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts his thoughts are [Music] higher his Revelation comes Revelation comes to our lives it's the only way we can access God's thoughts have to cry out for Revelation God's ways are higher because his thoughts are higher no one can walk higher than their very own thought no one can live higher than what they think no one can live higher than what they think of in Genesis 1:1 God analyzed the situation to see what condition the Earth found itself in when he saw the it was below that without form and voice God saw the void he saw he to dis but God's thoughts have always been hidden certain portions throughout the ages PA but the revelations of the Gospel the one that was not beloved now it's called The Bride the Beloved of the people who which are we are part it's something important for us to understand that we're part of that privileged group because of predestination so then we have to look at predestination to see and analyze the situation to be able to understand who we are at theend God once again analyzed the condition of the we know what the condition of the age is where we're going from one place to another in this age we God analyzed the condition begin to speak to as thinks they poor and blind they're naked and they not they think they know everything but they know nothing they constantly are claiming for their rights that's why the time we live everyone is trying to claim their rights everyone why because it's the anointing that in the age that we live in when the seed is planted or the seed begins to feed itself according to where it was swn the seed can't feed itself from somewhere else if you plant a seed outside of your house the seed will begin to expand and its food will they'll get it from what it surr it's going to go into the iron calcium everything it needs because that place where it was sewn or planted that's where it has what it needs in order to grow all of the plants have that characteristic why plants that you want to plant and they won't give you nothing because what that need what that seed needs to develop it's not in that in that environment so then the seed has to have the appropriate atmosphere and us as seed of God we have two options we are seed of God that's the first thing you have to know I am I am a son of the age of SE physically the seed has no option you planted it there and that's where it has to be but in this time speaking spiritually God planted Us in this age we're living but he put inside of us the capacity or capability to be able to choose the environment of the atmosph to be able to feed off of that atmosphere live under Le or we going to feed ourselves with the word I'm going to stay like many seeds that are planted in toxic places the Earth is contaminated what do you think the seed is going to get nothing but contamination if you let Leia take hold of you your roots begin to grab onto the anointing of lady so he will feed off of that anointing to take hold of your mind and after that takes hold of us we will say why can't I get rid of this habit the Bible says we're more than con all things in Christ who streng why can't I get rid of this habit and I feel defeated why can't I connect myself with God why is it that when I pray contact or that communication I feel like God doesn't like God doesn't worry pray for it doesn't come and happen that's the spirit of Leia knocking at your door when you begin to think on these things I can't connect to God and then comes a thought and you begin to think on it surely it's my fault there has to be something wrong with me that stopping me from experimenting God's presence like other people exp we begin to blame ourselves it's our fault that we're in this condition why I lose my temper so easily why can't I be so patient like this other person it seems like they got running through their veins I want to be that way such they can't tell I'm already Sparks I'm already uh getting lit up and then I offend everyone and then I feel bad and that makes makes because I fear that I will because I always want to prove my point why do I constantly make wrong decisions why am I constantly fighting with my children trying to get to do this and that the other and children are fighting back with the parents saying no I don't want to fighting with your husband fighting with your wife if the toothpaste goes here then why is it over there something very important it has to have the cap on why why this fear worry and negativity consumes me why why is it when I see what everybody puts on social media on Facebook and all those other social media why is it that when I see that what others do what others post they make me feel like my life is worthless and has no purpose makes me feel that they have the perfect life in mind is a disaster why why always think that somebody is more successful than what I am yes brothers that's the way we think someone may I was speaking with someone no one knows the battles that everyone's going problems the worries this and the other it's like I used to tell a brother like brother you don't know how much I struggle to comb my ha he probably thinks well it's easy what are you even going to comb over so I struggle to comb my hair now more than back then I struggle more because it's like my hairs became more rebellious see yes you can say well it's easy what are you even going to comeb over we always think that someone has a EAS always thinking about this that or the other question connecting one way or another with the es that Speak Us tells us come the voice comes through a man you can't unbind God's voice with human flesh God is the one that he will give you strength you have to accept voice at time that you're living in Hallelujah way there there an Open Door in the heavens and I will show you anointing of but the reason we can't heed to that voice pulling us is trying that we're Something That We're Not that we're sinners we don't have that no one loves us no one will ever no one will ever understand W up to our reality is that we're sons of God the blood of the Lamb come from ET going towards ET as long as we don't recognize the age of always have an influence over us because the message of our age our Prophet by God sent by spoken by our to take us out of Le he didn't come he didn't come to be a theologist he didn't come to do that came that each recognize who we are that's the real reason and God hides he reveals himself Simplicity that's why you want God's love in your life what do you have to do read the word and pray why do I need God's love in my life well when Lord Jesus Christ was on Earth he came as the lamb and he began to display his love he was rejected he was injured by our the punishment of us was upon Him each time that he was on Earth each time that he did he was subjected to one had the habit of praying it was our Lord Jesus Christ and if the Lord Jesus Christ had to pray what about us what about us I want you to meditate on this for a moment if God made flesh God himself came and made himself so a virgin F the scripture to Isaiah a virgin shall conceive God coming to dwell the full Divinity of the body made flesh he had to pray now what about us what about us I just can't get rid of this habit what do I have have to do read the word and pray why can't I connect with God I feel like God doesn't hear me read the word and pray something the karate Angel is going to come and just give him a kick no don't think that if you're waiting for that for he say why I lose my temper so easily why can't I be like that brother so to do what do I have to do brother read the word and pray why do I constantly make the wrong I know that I shouldn't do it but I still do it what's the answer to that problem read the word and pray what I fight with my wife or with my husband so much why because what what what isn't matter is there what's the problem with that it's not bothering anyone there well then we need Revelation because maybe the problem is not there something over here that's building up toothpast we think it's but in reality it's something else over here and the pants over there and the wife is walking around trying to Pi everything up to go do the laund and she's barely finishing with laundry and now the shoes are over there and we throw everything everywhere well the answer this problem what do we have to do we have to read the word and from the to give Revelation for why it's not good to leave your toothpaste there why does Fear worry and negativity come and take hold of my mind what do I have to do to re to obtain that the peace of God to read the word and pray why is it that when I see what other people post on social media what I what I feel bad I can't even go to the corner and this person over here is out in France I can't even make it to C Grand and they're in France here and they go to New York that I'm I'm a skyscraper that you can see all the way down I'm standing over [Music] Crystal Pho and if I'm lucky I can get to North Phoenix what's the solution to that problem and read the word and pray maybe the first thing God will anwers they have to shut down that social media but in order to pray does God have to come and force you no that's why God allows us things to happen the problems lead us to read the word because the word when we it it will make contact with our spirit to wake up awaken who we truly are when word makes contact with the SE that is inside of us then the seed will begin to move the atmosphere will begin to change that atere that's being created by the word of I'll begin to meditate I'll begin to do what I to I'm busy or if I'm not busy doesn't matter I because this is my spiritual life that it's more important to pray than to sleep yes I prom I promise you if you drive 30 minutes minimum 30 minutes minimum if you drive to work wherever you're going you can listen to one message a day don't tell me you don't have time to listen to messages if just when you're commuting to your job 30 minutes wherever you go you listen to the m store listen to the message some errands listen to the message minimum you listen to one message you listen to one message daily how many will you do in a week I'll give you I'll give you the Sunday off but what about the rest of the week that's six just a week wow how many do I listen to now don't tell me just think about it just think about it is it so difficult to pray for 15 minutes 20 minutes sometimes we're even watching TV for up to an hour I'm going to watch TV for half an hour and then I'm going to pray for half an hour before you know it you'll be praying for hour and you'll be watching TV for zero minutes you won't watch it because the spirit will pull you to the word that's what it did with the Lord Jesus Christ it always led him to the word that's why if you want to go deeper into and you want God's love to transform you to mold you you want the anointing of create a barrier around you so doesn't cause you to do things you don't want to do I'm going to give you the solution the hidden mystery hidden throughout times you have to do what read the word and pray is that difficult we just have to analyze the situation analyze the situation to see the value of the seed what seed the one that God planted in my heart I am well worthy I have value God had the cross for me for me for me when you always touch he cried he died on the cross for me for me for me for me you know that when you do that your body begins to they positive vibration they affect your it begin to change the composition of and it begin to hor C chemical in your body that will make to the word of God to be positive that's the effect that God's word has on our that our very own cells are getting used to they're accustom to stress hormones we have to change our atmosphere we have to change the atmosphere that we live worries what do I have to do how often brother says that a Christian every day they read the word every day and they pray every day that is what we have to do and what will be the result if we do that the musicians can please come forward I even lost the good thing I have eyes everywhere what's going to be the result God's power to transform you can please stand and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come for with the power of life with to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said and now my question is for what is it that God said that you would be what is that cry you have in your heart that cry in your heart one deep you want because there is a holy spirit if you want I tell you are free this morning leave that jail thaton that can they is you
