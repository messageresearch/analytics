[0:51] those great men spoke in tongues and
[0:58] interpreted
[1:02] and today you speak in tongues in a
[1:04] Methodist Church or Lutheran Church to
[1:06] kick you out the
[1:14] door what's the
[1:17] matter right in the time where we ought
[1:20] to be placing
[1:22] Sons what is the
[1:28] matter they have adopted something else
[1:32] because they don't know the mystery of
[1:38] God and they'll never know it through a
[1:45] seminary let me just read something you
[1:48] is it all
[1:51] right all right let us turn over I got
[1:53] something down
[1:56] here let's find out how Paul now here
[2:00] here's the teacher of this
[2:05] message let's go to acts 95 just a
[2:12] minute listen how Paul got this
[2:15] Revelation whatever happened now in act
[2:19] n we start reading like
[2:23] this it's a Sunday School play so why
[2:26] not why not read it let me know when I'm
[2:31] out and sa yet breathing out
[2:36] threatening that little
[2:39] hooker
[2:46] mean slaughterings against the Disciples
[2:49] of the
[2:51] Lord went to the high
[2:58] priest letters to Damascus to the
[3:02] synagogues that if he found
[3:09] any I'll go look him
[3:13] up just Bo what I'll
[3:22] do but he was
[3:28] predestinated amen
[3:30] how do you know that old boot leer down
[3:31] there is not predestinated to
[3:37] Li how do you know old street walker you
[3:40] won't even speak
[3:44] to how do you know that little hand
[3:47] shaking outed her church wouldn't make a
[3:48] saint of God out of her Y and her
[3:57] glory how do you know she's not
[4:00] that's what we don't know but that's our
[4:07] duty like a fisherman throw a net into
[4:10] the sea and pulled out he brought frogs
[4:12] fish lizards water spiders and
[4:15] everything else but some of them is
[4:26] fish he didn't know he' just casting
[4:29] that that's why we
[4:34] do watch
[4:36] PA Desiring letters to the mcus to the
[4:39] synagogues that if he found any in this
[4:42] way whether they were men or women he
[4:44] might buy them and bring them to
[4:55] Jerusalem brother he was really
[4:58] rough
[5:01] and as he journeyed he came near Damas
[5:04] and suddenly there shined around
[5:14] him came a priest up the road Dr FF
[5:19] Jones and said to him you need a a
[5:22] seminary experience now son and I
[5:24] believe God could use
[5:28] you
[5:35] Jones wouldn't that be a horrible look
[5:38] scripture read like
[5:43] that now that's just as much sense I
[5:46] ain't saying that for a
[5:51] joke that's that's just as much sense is
[5:54] what we get out of it
[5:58] today
[6:01] you know your mother was a good woman I
[6:03] believe You' make a good
[6:08] preacher watch what
[6:11] happened
[6:13] and and as he journeyed he came near D
[6:16] and suddenly there shine around him
[6:19] about a
[6:28] light
[6:30] starts off
[6:31] [Music]
[6:34] Supernatural a light from
[6:37] heaven and he fell to the Earth and he
[6:40] heard a voice saying sa sa persecuted s
[6:48] me and he said who thou
[6:52] Lord and the Lord said unto him I'm
[6:55] Jesus whom thou persecutest as hard for
[6:58] thee to kick against the
[7:08] and he trembled and was astonished and
[7:10] said Lord what will thou have me
[7:18] do and the Lord said un him
[7:21] arise and go into the City and it shall
[7:24] be told thee what thou sh
[7:28] do
[7:33] and the man journeyed with him and went
[7:34] on they found a man
[7:36] anas down there saw Vision all
[7:39] superatural
[7:47] saw that old
[7:52] meany saw Vision looked in his house he
[7:55] was a prophet in his house praying and
[7:57] he saw a vision
[8:06] Lord spoke to him he said there's a man
[8:08] coming down the road over he just as
[8:10] blind as a back and his name is Saul The
[8:13] Saul
[8:21] of said great things don't send me I'm a
[8:24] little man don't send me after
[8:28] him

[9:13] he said what I had to do is take it all
[9:23] out that was the thing it wasn't give

[14:29] this
[14:37] morning for do I now persuade man or
[14:44] God or do I seek to please
[14:48] man for if I yet please man then I not
[14:51] be the servant
[14:57] of how can I expect
[15:01] anything how can a man that loves God
[15:04] and a preacher especially expected to
[15:07] anything but be hated by
[15:09] man man will hate
[15:20] you well Jesus said if they call me the
[15:24] Master of the House I'm the master the
[15:26] greatest of all of you
[15:35] I'm the one to perform more miracles and
[15:37] do more with the Holy Spirit and all of
[15:38] you because I got the whole fullness in
[15:48] me and if they call
[15:50] me how much more they going to
[15:57] call but don't take no thought watch you
[15:59] be saying for it will not be you that
[16:01] speaks it will be the father that dwells
[16:03] in you do the speaking at that
[16:13] time stay right with the
[16:18] word and he when he got through write in
[16:20] the book he said any man that'll take
[16:23] one word out of this book or add one
[16:26] word to it the same will be taken out of
[16:29] the book of life for
[16:41] him God help us to stay right with
[16:48] him now the next verse let me read Now
[16:51] read quickly
[16:57] now but
[16:59] certify let's take you to
[17:05] judgment I certify you Brethren that the
[17:09] gospel which was preached out of me is
[17:14] not after
[17:21] man neither Methodist Baptist
[17:23] Presbyterian or
[17:27] Pentecostal
[17:30] it was not man neither for I neither
[17:35] received it
[17:39] man neither was I
[17:50] taught I never received it from man no
[17:52] Seminary no doctor no
[17:55] Divinity no school of education
[18:06] received it that way I never taught it
[18:08] that way I never found it that way it
[18:10] never come to me that
[18:18] way how did it come then
[18:21] Paul taught it but by the
[18:27] revelation of Jesus
[18:32] Christ when Christ revealed himself to
[18:36] me that he was the son of
[18:42] God when that Pillar of Fire fell upon
[18:46] me that day I said who are you Lord he
[18:48] said I'm
[18:55] Jesus I'm G to show what what happened
[18:58] to him
[19:03] now right now if a fell had experience
[19:04] they want to give him 10 years to learn
[19:06] Greek and uh 10 more years to learn uh
[19:09] something else and but that time he's
[19:22] gone
[19:23] look neither received it our man neither
[19:26] was our tet but by the revelation of
[19:29] Jesus
[19:35] Christ ye have heard of my uh
[19:39] conversations and times past in the
[19:41] Jewish
[19:45] religion I was a big doctor boy I had

[1:05:15] it then it will be a blessing for us
[1:05:23] Genesis is one one how many of you have
[1:05:30] it in the beginning God created the
[1:05:32] heavens and the
[1:05:35] [Music]

[1:05:45] and void and darkness was upon the face
[1:05:47] of the deep and the spirit of God move
[1:05:49] upon the face of the
[1:05:53] waters and God said let God said let
[1:05:55] there be light and there was
[1:06:01] light and God called the day the light
[1:06:04] day and the Darkness he called night and

[1:07:08] thoughts for as a rain cometh down and
[1:07:11] the snow from heaven and return it not

[1:11:42] normal the Lord bless you
[1:11:46] brother let us go into our
[1:11:49] thought the spoken word is the Original
[1:11:52] Seed we've been speaking on
[1:11:55] this since the year
[1:12:03] started the spoken word is the Original
[1:12:05] Seed those are the scripture that our
[1:12:07] pastor
[1:12:09] used in the beginning God created the
[1:12:12] Heaven and the
[1:12:14] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:12:20] void the spirit of God moved upon the
[1:12:23] face
[1:12:24] of the
[1:12:26] deep the face of the
[1:12:31] waters God had to manifest
[1:12:36] his he wanted to express the thoughts
[1:12:39] that he
[1:12:40] had to
[1:12:44] express the word had to be present to be
[1:12:48] spoken he had to come down a little bit
[1:12:52] more
[1:12:57] something came to manifestation
[1:12:58] something we were able to
[1:13:00] see small we
[1:13:03] call the anointed the anointed
[1:13:08] one he began to
[1:13:11] express God's
[1:13:14] thoughts to give shape or form
[1:13:19] to to put things that were out of order
[1:13:23] to them in
[1:13:25] order to put
[1:13:28] Darkness so that light would be
[1:13:31] manifested as we
[1:13:38] mentioned God was analyzing the
[1:13:40] situation that the Earth found itself in
[1:13:43] there was seed
[1:13:48] there God saw the value of the
[1:13:52] seed Isaiah 55 tells
[1:13:56] us that God's thoughts are
[1:14:00] higher when we Analyze This Isaiah
[1:14:04] 55 it focuses focuses on God's
[1:14:09] thoughts and then it tells us that the
[1:14:13] word comes out of my mouth shall not
[1:14:15] return
[1:14:18] void but in verse 10 of Isaiah
[1:14:22] 55 it talks to us about a
[1:14:25] process about a
[1:14:27] process it talks about God's
[1:14:31] thoughts God God's thoughts are are
[1:14:34] higher they're
[1:14:37] higher as much as say ways are
[1:14:41] higher that's why we can
[1:14:45] say we can't live higher than what we
[1:14:49] think always keep that in
[1:14:51] mind your thoughts thoughts will reflect
[1:14:55] your your thoughts will reflect your
[1:15:00] ways the thoughts will reflect who you
[1:15:04] are you can't act different than what
[1:15:07] you
[1:15:09] think you can't speak different than
[1:15:11] what you're thinking and when you
[1:15:15] speak you are just expressing your own
[1:15:18] thoughts so
[1:15:21] God he teaches us that the structure
[1:15:23] that he
[1:15:24] has God has
[1:15:28] thoughts but when God speaks the
[1:15:31] word he
[1:15:33] expresses there is a process there's
[1:15:36] time for it to come to
[1:15:39] manifest every time that God
[1:15:43] speaks the word of God will manifest
[1:15:45] itself
[1:15:47] all God is expressing what
[1:15:50] thinking and what his thinking will be
[1:15:52] expressed
[1:15:54] our
[1:15:55] problem is that we don't
[1:15:57] understand we are time
[1:16:00] creatures sometimes we
[1:16:02] speak it doesn't
[1:16:05] happen we not careful what
[1:16:08] we watch our
[1:16:10] thoughts now we're
[1:16:14] seeing the times we've been speaking
[1:16:17] on connecting God's
[1:16:19] Thoughts with the Original
[1:16:22] Seed is the spoken
[1:16:28] word God wants his thoughts to be
[1:16:35] known but God thoughts have been given
[1:16:37] out Through the
[1:16:39] Ages God's
[1:16:41] thoughts are
[1:16:45] Eternal in the church Age The Prophet
[1:16:48] says
[1:16:50] this and he is asking this question
[1:16:54] are God's thoughts
[1:16:57] Eternal if you can see
[1:16:59] that then you will understand many
[1:17:02] things God is
[1:17:05] unchangeable in
[1:17:06] essence as in his
[1:17:10] ways God is infinite
[1:17:12] in ability he knows the end from the
[1:17:15] beginning because he is God for as
[1:17:19] much God's thoughts are eternal are
[1:17:24] real God's thoughts are
[1:17:28] Eternal we could go through the
[1:17:32] ages SP about Moses Jeremiah John the
[1:17:38] Baptist we can come down all the way to
[1:17:41] Jesus the
[1:17:47] logus every one of the prophets where
[1:17:49] God's Express thoughts in their in their
[1:17:52] time so we come back
[1:17:56] to he was God's complete thought
[1:18:01] expressed then he was known as the
[1:18:04] word now notice now
[1:18:07] here say that the L
[1:18:10] God was manifested in his
[1:18:15] son and in Jesus the fullness of the
[1:18:18] godhead
[1:18:19] bodily and that Eternal
[1:18:21] being was the father manifested in
[1:18:26] flesh and through those means he
[1:18:28] obtained the title as a son so
[1:18:32] God came down in
[1:18:35] flesh through the Lord Jesus
[1:18:38] Christ he wanted to express his
[1:18:42] thoughts so he came and he
[1:18:44] man he came through the prophet to bring
[1:18:48] up part of what he
[1:18:50] was so they could express part of his
[1:18:54] but when Jesus
[1:18:56] came he was the fullness of the
[1:18:59] God God
[1:19:01] made now God was
[1:19:04] expressing his own
[1:19:06] thoughts now was God
[1:19:09] himself God having with a human
[1:19:13] being we are hugging each other God
[1:19:17] made was God above
[1:19:20] us God With Us was God With
[1:19:25] Us manifesting
[1:19:27] God
[1:19:29] we the way their
[1:19:31] God we can
[1:19:34] understand Christ is the mystery of God
[1:19:37] revealed that God had
[1:19:39] a but he had been hidden in
[1:19:43] Christ even though Christ was with
[1:19:47] him but it was still
[1:19:49] hidden because they could not accept
[1:19:54] Christ the word made
[1:19:57] flesh God began to reveal little by
[1:20:00] little thoughts began to
[1:20:03] express then God makes
[1:20:07] himself then the the only
[1:20:11] begotten the only son of
[1:20:14] God came to be manifest in the original
[1:20:18] to
[1:20:19] die to go to
[1:20:21] Calvary to pay the price for you and me
[1:20:25] then he resurrect when
[1:20:28] he the grain
[1:20:31] of and now it's
[1:20:33] proding the
[1:20:35] ano the only
[1:20:38] begot as a first one among
[1:20:42] many that takes us to another
[1:20:45] level now God's
[1:20:49] to God is always analyzing
[1:20:51] the to evaluate the the value of the
[1:20:55] seed Romans 9
[1:20:59] 9:23 St
[1:21:01] Paul he begins to speak to
[1:21:18] us and that he might make known The
[1:21:21] Riches of his glory on the vessels of
[1:21:23] Mercy which he had four prepared unto
[1:21:32] Glory even us whom he had called not
[1:21:36] unto the Jews only but of the
[1:21:42] Gentiles now Jesus Christ was sent to a
[1:21:44] certain
[1:21:48] people Prophet have spoken through the
[1:21:51] times behold
[1:21:54] beh virgin shall
[1:21:58] conceive they were waiting for that
[1:21:59] prophecy to be
[1:22:01] fulfilled they were looking for the
[1:22:03] Fulfillment of the
[1:22:05] word and God came
[1:22:08] down to give them the deliverer they
[1:22:10] were
[1:22:12] waiting the Messiah came and present
[1:22:14] before them God made flesh
[1:22:17] the once again
[1:22:20] Christ the Mysteries were in
[1:22:24] the Myst were in
[1:22:30] him but it was God completely
[1:22:33] in God manifested in
[1:22:36] flesh but the people which he came to
[1:22:38] rejected him they rejected him crucified
[1:22:43] him
[1:22:45] God began to
[1:22:47] progress St Paul
[1:22:50] comes God's plan begin to the
[1:22:53] he himself himself came God
[1:22:57] himself and and separated himself among
[1:23:00] many after he died
[1:23:04] Hees and when he goes up higher promise
[1:23:08] waiting
[1:23:10] Jerusalem wait until they were with
[1:23:13] power from on
[1:23:15] High when they're
[1:23:17] obedience a lightning came ther came
[1:23:21] and among everyone that were
[1:23:24] present now God the that light the
[1:23:28] anointed the
[1:23:31] Eternal has separated himself
[1:23:34] many when God separates himself he
[1:23:36] doesn't loses
[1:23:38] hisence he doesn't lose his me he
[1:23:41] doesn't change his principles it's now
[1:23:44] God in the body of Christ with the same
[1:23:48] with the same
[1:23:50] anointing working with the same laws
[1:23:55] so
[1:23:57] now God's plan
[1:24:00] continues and we find ourselves with St
[1:24:03] Paul he had an
[1:24:06] experience just like the other
[1:24:10] Apostles and he begins to speak about a
[1:24:12] my once
[1:24:15] again hidden Mystery in Christ now was
[1:24:19] Paul Paul was Christ
[1:24:22] the
[1:24:24] Anointed God speaking through Paul and
[1:24:27] he says
[1:24:34] this even as whom he had called not the
[1:24:37] Jews only but also of the
[1:24:40] Gentiles verse
[1:24:48] 25 as I as he said also in OA I will
[1:24:53] call my people which were not my people
[1:24:55] her beloved which were not which was not
[1:24:58] the
[1:25:00] Beloved in the place where it was
[1:25:04] told and it shall come to pass that you
[1:25:06] are not my
[1:25:08] people and they shall be called the
[1:25:10] children of the Living
[1:25:12] God there was a mystery here once again
[1:25:16] God
[1:25:17] thoughts had been hidden in
[1:25:21] Christ for to be rebuilt at a determined
[1:25:25] time now Paul's speaking of a mystery
[1:25:28] here the mystery
[1:25:31] was we as
[1:25:34] Gentiles that we would have an
[1:25:38] opportunity receive the same gospel that
[1:25:40] the Jews had
[1:25:44] receiv we're not going to be like the
[1:25:46] dogs that received the crumbs off the
[1:25:47] master
[1:25:49] table because when Jesus Jesus Di
[1:25:55] there was just the crumbs that fell
[1:25:56] table but it was no longer that
[1:26:01] anymore now the mystery was being
[1:26:05] expressed the mystery that had been
[1:26:07] hidden through the
[1:26:08] times people that were not
[1:26:11] people people people that were far
[1:26:14] off people that were
[1:26:17] forgotten one that wasn't
[1:26:20] beloved she would called my beloved
[1:26:23] people that were not my
[1:26:26] people they shall be called the children
[1:26:28] of the Living God because the mystery
[1:26:31] was being
[1:26:32] declared through Christ once
[1:26:35] again Christ was expressing his thoughts
[1:26:39] God in
[1:26:41] Christ telling us a mysteries for the
[1:26:45] age because the Revelation has to come
[1:26:48] without
[1:26:50] revelation we can't understand
[1:26:53] God's
[1:26:57] thoughts Colossians 126 tells
[1:27:09] us even the mystery which had hi from
[1:27:12] ages and from Generations but is now
[1:27:14] made manifest to his
[1:27:21] Saints
[1:27:24] the mystery had been hidden but now has
[1:27:26] been revealed and made manifest to his
[1:27:37] Saints glor to whom God would have made
[1:27:40] known that is what the riches of his
[1:27:42] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:27:46] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:27:49] now Paul comes and begins to tell them
[1:27:53] you were not
[1:27:54] children you were not
[1:27:56] accepted God in Christ again analyzing
[1:28:00] the
[1:28:01] situation he analy the
[1:28:03] situation forgotten people people that
[1:28:06] were
[1:28:08] Idol people that have been placed
[1:28:11] aside but God saw that disorder in that
[1:28:15] Darkness there was a seed there he saw
[1:28:18] the value of that
[1:28:20] seed for the eyes
[1:28:23] you don't have any
[1:28:24] value but for me you are my beloved you
[1:28:27] are my
[1:28:29] beloved I love you and I've made you a
[1:28:31] way
[1:28:33] back rejected now you are my
[1:28:35] beloved I have a plan for you now
[1:28:41] now Christ in
[1:28:44] us the glory of God can be
[1:28:48] manifested you the hope of glory Christ
[1:28:52] in
[1:28:53] you God is making us
[1:28:56] partakers so that the glory of God could
[1:28:59] be
[1:29:00] manifested the power of God can be
[1:29:04] manifested when
[1:29:06] Moses he going to God's
[1:29:09] presence so Anointed with God's
[1:29:12] presence that he had to cover his
[1:29:15] face so that the people wouldn't
[1:29:19] worship because his face shown by the
[1:29:22] Pres of
[1:29:23] God when God would come down
[1:29:26] and so that man could feel his
[1:29:29] presence it was just a high priest that
[1:29:32] had access to that
[1:29:35] place where the glory of God was
[1:29:38] manifested and now the priest would come
[1:29:41] would present to the people manifest the
[1:29:44] glory of God
[1:29:45] them to them God has forgiven us we are
[1:29:48] a chosen people privileged people
[1:29:54] but when Christ the word
[1:29:56] made to pay the price for
[1:29:59] our the veil was rent
[1:30:02] into now anyone could have
[1:30:05] access where God's glory
[1:30:08] is it wasn't only the high priest
[1:30:11] anymore it wasn't only a certain
[1:30:14] person whoever wanted to
[1:30:16] go have direct
[1:30:18] access enter into God's glory that's why
[1:30:22] Paul tells
[1:30:23] us expressing God's
[1:30:26] thoughts he comes and tells us all my
[1:30:29] thought are higher than your
[1:30:32] thoughts don't interpret things
[1:30:34] according to your own
[1:30:35] thoughts now Paul tells
[1:30:38] us that the way that God will the glory
[1:30:41] of
[1:30:43] God when he comes to your
[1:30:47] heart deposit his
[1:30:50] thoughts and now the glory of
[1:30:53] will be manifested among
[1:30:56] people dirty that have been reject the
[1:31:00] one that didn't have any
[1:31:01] home that one there was no home for them
[1:31:04] God comes and tells them I love them I
[1:31:08] love
[1:31:09] you I paid the price for
[1:31:11] them now I will manifest myself through
[1:31:14] them the one that was in
[1:31:17] my
[1:31:18] people now they shall be called the
[1:31:20] children of the Living God
[1:31:27] yes
[1:31:30] now the process
[1:31:34] comes and then he sends us to the time
[1:31:36] that we're living now I'm gonna skip all
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:40] ages he sends us to
[1:31:45] laa the door was open for
[1:31:49] us God comes and he analyzes the
[1:31:52] situation
[1:31:53] once what's the
[1:31:58] situation because I know that
[1:32:01] works neither are you cold or
[1:32:05] hot because you look warm warm or hot I
[1:32:10] will spill you out of my
[1:32:12] mouth rich and I have gotten
[1:32:15] Rich have need of
[1:32:20] anything miserable wretched naked and
[1:32:23] don't even know
[1:32:26] it I you to buy gold tried in
[1:32:30] fire so you can
[1:32:33] be be dressed in white
[1:32:36] gar analyzing the
[1:32:39] situation he looks at a cold
[1:32:41] age an age without
[1:32:44] hope looks only for their
[1:32:47] own they're so
[1:32:49] relaxed they don't care about the
[1:32:53] among
[1:32:56] all
[1:32:58] move the face of the
[1:33:00] waters and he looks at the age of he
[1:33:03] looks at at a
[1:33:05] dirty neither cold or
[1:33:07] hot
[1:33:09] without there's no hope
[1:33:12] for analyzing the
[1:33:16] situation but within all that disorder
[1:33:19] all that Darkness there's
[1:33:23] there children of
[1:33:25] God they need to have contact with word
[1:33:28] so they can manifest
[1:33:30] themselves then we can
[1:33:34] see that we come from
[1:33:39] eternity and we travel
[1:33:43] through and we manifest ourselves in the
[1:33:45] day which we live in
[1:33:47] now but when we go into the dimension of
[1:33:50] time
[1:33:52] he gave us a spiritual
[1:33:57] Amnesia complete loss or partial loss of
[1:34:00] memory being
[1:34:01] Eternal being children of
[1:34:05] God God's expressed thoughts of
[1:34:08] God being the
[1:34:10] redeem being the on were bought
[1:34:14] right am I speaking to someone am I
[1:34:18] speaking
[1:34:19] to you have to know that that's
[1:34:23] you are an
[1:34:25] eternal eternity is inside that you were
[1:34:29] bought God paid the price for
[1:34:33] you he did paid the price
[1:34:35] for he also paid the
[1:34:38] price value before God's
[1:34:41] eyes if God made the
[1:34:44] sacrifice the cross the
[1:34:47] calary was to redeem me and to rescue
[1:34:50] me have value before God's eyes in this
[1:34:54] Dark
[1:34:56] Age worst age that there is dark
[1:35:00] darkness there's seed there's seed there
[1:35:04] and I am part of that
[1:35:06] seed part of that
[1:35:08] seed maybe the
[1:35:10] devil has tried to take that value off
[1:35:13] of the seed
[1:35:16] de taking you to make
[1:35:18] Mist but God doesn't look at that
[1:35:23] looks at the Eternal representation
[1:35:25] that's inside of
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:28] you and when we are in this
[1:35:32] Dimension we come to this age of
[1:35:36] laa inside of us there is that Eternal
[1:35:40] seed then God once
[1:35:44] again Christ the word it brings a
[1:35:49] message behold I'm at at the door and
[1:35:53] knock I'm at the door and I'm
[1:35:56] knocking if anyone hears my voice opens
[1:35:59] the door I will
[1:36:01] come with him with
[1:36:05] me now he's speaking here he is at the
[1:36:10] door but he can't open up the
[1:36:14] door the only one that open is the one
[1:36:16] inside is the one that's you're
[1:36:19] inside so then God
[1:36:23] I will express my thoughts once
[1:36:26] again I will bring my
[1:36:31] plan I will unfold what I thought since
[1:36:35] the all the prophets of the
[1:36:37] old all the saints of the ages of the
[1:36:44] Gentile they all saw that day that we
[1:36:46] living now
[1:36:50] why
[1:36:52] when God's thoughts would be
[1:36:57] fulfilled when the word would be
[1:36:59] fulfilled to
[1:37:02] the and if God's thoughts
[1:37:06] are if God's thoughts are
[1:37:11] manifested that gives us access to to
[1:37:14] God's
[1:37:15] thought and we have access to God's
[1:37:19] thoughts then The Way We Walk
[1:37:25] it's taking us directly into
[1:37:28] eternity it's no
[1:37:30] longer it's God
[1:37:32] speaking it's God
[1:37:34] Walk we stay
[1:37:36] in because in Christ is the
[1:37:39] Myster and when he speaks the mystery is
[1:37:49] revealed because God
[1:37:52] made
[1:37:54] everything good and beautiful in its
[1:37:56] time and has put
[1:37:58] eternity and in their
[1:38:01] hearts God put God put
[1:38:04] it now I will speak
[1:38:07] once I will be once again the original
[1:38:11] the grain of
[1:38:13] wheat and I will
[1:38:18] Ex because
[1:38:20] will say I have heard their
[1:38:22] cry and he comes and he sends us a
[1:38:25] Propet just like the old times did they
[1:38:28] heard the cry the people of
[1:38:31] is I will
[1:38:33] desend and he sent them Moses now once
[1:38:37] again
[1:38:39] time he heard the Cry of
[1:38:42] the he heard the cry that you
[1:38:45] had heard that you were crying out for
[1:38:48] Perfection crying out for perfection
[1:38:52] because you can
[1:38:53] be God heard that
[1:38:56] cry God heard that
[1:38:58] cry sent his
[1:39:01] thoughts to be
[1:39:03] expressed and he sent us a mighty
[1:39:06] Prophet amen
[1:39:09] amen so
[1:39:16] now this is where it gets
[1:39:20] interesting
[1:39:24] when God in the process of revealing his
[1:39:33] thoughts
[1:39:34] Ezekiel Saw it in it
[1:39:40] time
[1:39:50] e moreover he said unto me son of man
[1:39:53] eateth thou what thou findest eest eat
[1:39:57] this Ro and go speak unto the house of
[1:40:02] Israel verse two
[1:40:05] says and I opened my
[1:40:07] mouth and he caused me to eat that
[1:40:19] roll
[1:40:23] and he said unto me son of man cause thy
[1:40:26] belly to eat and fill thy vows with this
[1:40:29] role and I will give thee then I did eat
[1:40:32] it and then my mouth was as honey for
[1:40:37] sweetness sound familiar does that
[1:40:39] scripture sound
[1:40:41] familiar it's a familiar
[1:40:45] right Ezekiel Saw It the book that was
[1:40:49] sealed up Seven
[1:40:52] Seals said son of man eat what you find
[1:40:56] eat this
[1:40:58] roll I opened my
[1:41:01] mouth and he made me eat
[1:41:03] it he made me eat
[1:41:06] it and when I ate it it was
[1:41:10] sweet
[1:41:13] why because God was revealing to a secet
[1:41:17] he was giving him the so that he would
[1:41:20] write
[1:41:22] but the vision had not been revealed yet
[1:41:25] he only saw the
[1:41:26] vision and then he wrote
[1:41:30] down received the
[1:41:33] Revelation what really he had written
[1:41:36] until once
[1:41:39] again he was
[1:41:41] standing Jesus had come he paid the
[1:41:45] price he had gone to
[1:41:48] hell he G testimony to The Souls of
[1:41:51] he goes to
[1:41:53] paradise and when he gets
[1:41:55] there open up Eternal
[1:41:58] Gates the king of glory is coming when
[1:42:01] the door is
[1:42:02] open the Saints of the Old Testament see
[1:42:05] him when he
[1:42:07] seek this is the now I
[1:42:11] understand this is the one that I
[1:42:15] saw this is the Revelation now I can
[1:42:18] understand back then I only saw
[1:42:22] but now I understand that
[1:42:25] ration
[1:42:27] sweet because he just saw the he
[1:42:31] wrote the
[1:42:34] Revelation Christ rose from the
[1:42:37] dead he is the one
[1:42:39] that a
[1:42:42] within walking
[1:42:46] forward always moving
[1:42:49] forward
[1:42:54] but this automatically takes us to
[1:42:55] Revelations
[1:42:57] 10 Revelations 108
[1:43:02] says and the voice which I heard from
[1:43:05] Heaven spake unto me
[1:43:11] again go and take the little book which
[1:43:13] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:43:14] stands upon the sea and upon the
[1:43:18] Earth and I went to the angel and said
[1:43:20] said unto him give me the little
[1:43:22] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[1:43:25] it
[1:43:25] up it shall make th belly
[1:43:28] bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:43:31] mouth now wasn't going to be sweet
[1:43:34] now but it was going to Bitter the his
[1:43:37] belly
[1:43:39] why because when the
[1:43:41] revation of God's
[1:43:44] thoughts through the age which we live
[1:43:47] he sees the
[1:43:48] vision not only does he see the vision
[1:43:52] he now brings the
[1:43:53] Revelation as he brings the
[1:43:56] Revelation God's thoughts are
[1:43:59] expressed what's the
[1:44:02] purpose that we can live a higher
[1:44:06] life God thoughts and bring
[1:44:09] them to our life and apply them when
[1:44:12] it's
[1:44:14] sweet it's when we hear the
[1:44:16] Revelation but when it's
[1:44:19] better
[1:44:21] we must apply that
[1:44:24] re it tells us that we must forgive our
[1:44:28] enemies love those that doesn't love us
[1:44:30] and reject
[1:44:32] us we have to walk according to the
[1:44:36] circumstances we want to walk we
[1:44:41] don't when we have to answer because of
[1:44:44] situ we are not
[1:44:46] resp to raise our
[1:44:49] head
[1:44:51] to keep out of the water and stay
[1:44:53] alive it's now our
[1:44:55] responsibility to not Place
[1:44:58] excuses now we can't live a Christian
[1:45:02] Life can't put any more
[1:45:05] excuses because God has bring its for
[1:45:09] what heal the
[1:45:11] brokenhearted to bring sight to the
[1:45:14] BL spiritual blind and a natural blind
[1:45:18] to bring hope to bring healing
[1:45:21] healing of the healing of the spirit and
[1:45:25] healing of the
[1:45:27] body once again
[1:45:30] manifested Christ not the hope of
[1:45:33] glory and the glory of God will be
[1:45:37] manifest every time it faith
[1:45:40] is when it's
[1:45:43] hard when things are against
[1:45:46] you we all have faith when everything
[1:45:48] goes
[1:45:49] well
[1:45:51] but your faith is tested when everything
[1:45:52] goes wrong when things don't come out
[1:45:55] like you wanted to then right there God
[1:46:00] says you the hope of
[1:46:03] glory glory will be manifested when you
[1:46:06] say Lord I don't understand
[1:46:10] this I don't know why this is happening
[1:46:13] I don't understand why but one thing I
[1:46:16] your word tells
[1:46:18] me whatever I ask in thy name you would
[1:46:21] give it to us you
[1:46:24] said I want to leave you and forsake
[1:46:26] you I get a hold of that promise myself
[1:46:30] I won one or the other because I want to
[1:46:33] manifest Your
[1:46:34] Glory I want to manifest who you
[1:46:38] are bitterness doesn't have a way in my
[1:46:41] heart because you cast it out when you
[1:46:44] were in
[1:46:45] flesh if you cast out
[1:46:47] bitterness I will cast that out of my
[1:46:49] heart as well
[1:46:51] but now it's in your
[1:46:53] hands you gonna say
[1:46:55] brother you don't understand why I'm
[1:46:58] bitter you don't understand why I'm
[1:47:01] frustrated maybe I don't
[1:47:05] understand but a
[1:47:07] betterness in your life now it's your
[1:47:09] decision it's your
[1:47:12] decision you want to keep that
[1:47:13] bitterness in your if you want to be
[1:47:15] made fre because God made a way so that
[1:47:19] you can be free
[1:47:21] you have to accept it you have to take
[1:47:24] it because God is making
[1:47:27] usn the which we
[1:47:29] live he had never done this
[1:47:32] before now God had made an association
[1:47:35] with and now
[1:47:37] God and if you confess if you
[1:47:41] walk then I will move if you don't move
[1:47:45] I will not move
[1:47:47] why because
[1:47:49] I made my part now you do
[1:47:54] your I will enter as the Great and
[1:47:56] Mighty conquer to take control of
[1:47:59] the and put that
[1:48:01] dis put light in
[1:48:04] darkness why do you have to take up that
[1:48:09] responsibility will be Christ in you the
[1:48:11] hope of
[1:48:14] glory that's how it
[1:48:19] is that's the hardest
[1:48:24] thing many times we have to obey
[1:48:26] something we don't
[1:48:28] like he made a face of me I'm gonna
[1:48:31] stick my tongue out at
[1:48:33] him it's the hardest
[1:48:36] thing Revelation is beautiful
[1:48:39] right beautiful to receive the the word
[1:48:42] and but when
[1:48:44] Revelation what will
[1:48:46] take it will give us the
[1:48:48] spiritual we want to accept that that's
[1:48:52] why it's better that's why it's
[1:48:55] better please
[1:48:57] stand the musicians could
[1:49:02] come it's Christ in
[1:49:04] you the hope of
[1:49:08] glory god loved me so much God loved us
[1:49:12] so
[1:49:13] much that he sent his own son to die for
[1:49:18] us if he
[1:49:21] sent his own
[1:49:22] son to die in my
[1:49:25] place to pay the price that I had to
[1:49:29] pay why do I devalue
[1:49:32] myself and think I don't have any value
[1:49:34] before
[1:49:36] God that's why I love what the prophet
[1:49:40] said when he spoke about the women at
[1:49:42] the well that Samaritan
[1:49:45] woman everyone had
[1:49:47] rejected everyone had put her side
[1:49:51] nobody wanted to get
[1:49:53] close but when Jesus was before
[1:49:56] her he saw the condition of the
[1:50:00] woman he saw the Eternal
[1:50:04] SE morning God looking at the Eternal
[1:50:06] City within your
[1:50:08] heart he's looking at who you really
[1:50:11] are he's not looking at the condition to
[1:50:16] find he's looking at the cry that
[1:50:19] the the seed
[1:50:21] cries is what God
[1:50:24] makes when the seed begins to cry
[1:50:29] out it's like that Lily who wants to get
[1:50:31] out of
[1:50:33] that helps to get out of
[1:50:35] that that M
[1:50:39] she's the light of the sun is hitting
[1:50:41] that
[1:50:43] area and when he begins to see that
[1:50:49] light to unfold what's within
[1:50:52] her to cry out because he sees
[1:50:57] the pedal and see God face to
[1:51:00] face when you are in
[1:51:02] problems and everything is so
[1:51:05] dark you begin to cry
[1:51:08] out when you see the revelation of the
[1:51:10] word when the word goes for when the
[1:51:13] word is
[1:51:15] revealed there is something in our heart
[1:51:17] that
[1:51:18] moves you can't still you have to cry
[1:51:23] out sun is shining that
[1:51:27] se the Lord is bringing forth that se to
[1:51:29] life once again for what to redeem us to
[1:51:34] restore
[1:51:35] us to heal our
[1:51:38] hearts to give us what we
[1:51:40] need to restore our
[1:51:43] family to restore our
[1:51:45] life to give us the Holy Spirit to give
[1:51:49] us a new birth
[1:51:52] but we have to force
[1:51:54] ourselves make the effort to get out of
[1:51:56] that
[1:51:57] condition and we can see God face to
[1:52:00] face when we're in this
[1:52:02] condition time
[1:52:04] stops we go into
[1:52:07] eternity when we're in that
[1:52:09] situation just speak the
[1:52:12] word because now all things possible
[1:52:15] look at your
[1:52:17] condition at the sacrifice that he did
[1:52:21] just speak the
[1:52:22] word believe in his
[1:52:24] word and I understand that everything
[1:52:27] has been done it's an unconditional
[1:52:30] Covenant it's a love Covenant I love you
[1:52:35] I redeemed

[1:53:14] people if someone has a broken
[1:53:18] heart
[1:53:20] you come and put those
[1:53:22] places but you give the
[1:53:25] vision so they can run behind that
[1:53:28] Vision so they can speak the
[1:53:31] word for restoration of the
[1:53:34] home for restoration of the
[1:53:37] children for the healing of the
[1:53:39] Body for the baptism of the holy
