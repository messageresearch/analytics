[23:57] watching again god bless you
[25:42] [Music]
[25:48] [Music]
[26:12] I am here tonight to tell you about a
[26:20] father who loved his son and a son who
[26:26] loved his dad the way this story's gonna
[26:31] unfold for you
[26:33] it's a little bit different because I
[26:35] want to bring it to now you see a dad
[26:38] would go home and he would go out of
[26:40] school every now and then he would pick
[26:42] up his son and say son could you go to
[26:44] work with me the boy loved that and when
[26:46] his dad would just come and pick him up
[26:48] he was the happiest boy ever he knew
[26:51] that he would get to spend the afternoon
[26:52] with his father and working and he would
[26:54] get his coat and they would walk and he
[26:56] he would bring hot chocolate for his son
[26:58] where it's really cold and they would
[27:00] they would go through but this boy was
[27:02] different this boy would see things this
[27:04] boy wasn't normal and when he whom they
[27:06] were walking one afternoon going to
[27:09] where dad worked this boy would notice
[27:11] things that other people would notice he
[27:13] see things other people wouldn't see he
[27:15] sees a man in a bathrobe in the middle
[27:17] of the street who's yelling at a
[27:18] second-story window he sees a woman
[27:21] who's very angry at him and doesn't
[27:23] really want to hear what he says this
[27:25] boy is the rest of the world hustles by
[27:27] he slows down he sees them hurt and the
[27:30] pain he sees the English in the sorrow
[27:32] he sees the window closed and a
[27:35] desperate man
[27:45] and this boy would see these things
[27:48] his father rushes that gets him by the
[27:50] hand and says let's go be late he would
[27:55] stop and look one more time can I stop
[27:58] his ping but the boy loved his father
[28:05] they would go and they would catch the
[28:06] trolley I think that's what you call it
[28:08] here we call it a tram yo know the words
[28:11] but he would get on there with his dad
[28:13] and the boy would just notice people he
[28:15] would look and that day one particularly
[28:17] he noticed something as he got on the
[28:20] train as you can hear there's a train
[28:23] coming and I gotta get through this
[28:26] before the train gets here he saw a man
[28:29] he saw a woman he saw that the man
[28:31] seemed very happy and the woman seemed
[28:34] very sad and you couldn't understand why
[28:37] they could be together and one be happy
[28:39] and the other be sad he couldn't
[28:40] understand that but the little boy knew
[28:42] that there was something wrong
[28:44] he had this feeling this instinct that
[28:47] was amazing how he cared for other
[28:49] people but he loved none other than his
[28:52] father he knew his dad he loved him and
[28:54] as he watched the world and they're
[28:56] hurting their plane he knew that he
[28:57] would always have a father but even
[28:59] noticed this I need you to understand as
[29:02] you hear this story and get involved in
[29:04] the life of this man and his son I need
[29:06] you to notice that there's no mom as
[29:12] they walked through the woods the boy
[29:13] would say to his father dad what will I
[29:15] do when I grow up
[29:16] well world I get to do wacky the cool
[29:18] job like yours how will I work I don't
[29:21] know but I want to change the world I
[29:23] want to do something great I'm going to
[29:24] do something wonderful I want to help
[29:26] people I want to do something that they
[29:27] can change the lives of anyone I just
[29:29] want to be that great I just want to do
[29:31] something good and as he walked with his
[29:33] dad his dad was saying son you will be
[29:35] great you will be awesome you will
[29:37] change the world your life is gonna be
[29:39] incredible there was a train coming
[29:48] [Music]
[29:50] we're all on the train of life just
[29:54] riding whether we realized the truth or
[29:57] not were to really realize what's
[29:58] happening or not we're all on that same
[30:01] train to me only God has saw it fit for
[30:04] us to be in the same room the same car
[30:06] for such a time as this when I get to
[30:10] the edge of the train track he could see
[30:12] where his father were we see the bridge
[30:14] that's what his dad did you see the
[30:16] bridge was very very important boats
[30:18] needed to come to the harbour to get off
[30:20] their goods so they could make money but
[30:21] trains were coming with people going
[30:23] from one town to the next
[30:25] not many cars in Europe so they couldn't
[30:27] use a lot of that too many people not
[30:30] enough roads so everybody to get from
[30:33] the town to town to get to work and to
[30:35] get home then one day the train was
[30:37] coming by what you have to understand is
[30:39] that boy in love going to work with his
[30:41] dad he was saved by the river's edge and
[30:44] he would do what he loved to do the most
[30:46] let me explain that he loved to fish
[30:50] anybody liked to fish all the guys go
[30:56] the dad looks at his boy and he says son
[30:58] now remember the rules you got to stay
[31:00] right here because I can see you from
[31:01] the window right here don't get out of
[31:03] the side of this window because you got
[31:05] to stay there as you can hear the
[31:09] train's coming
[31:11] the father's job was cool if I wouldn't
[31:15] preach I wouldn't mind doing that get to
[31:17] work get grease on you even if you
[31:20] didn't have to just support it on
[31:23] that's why we do there was a boat coming
[31:29] in the harbor timing is very essential
[31:32] I'll go ahead and give you the key the
[31:34] key is this there's always a light
[31:36] everybody say light say it again one
[31:39] more time there's a light that the train
[31:41] conductor needs to see if that light is
[31:43] green he can go if it's red he must stop
[31:45] you see God has given us road signs in
[31:48] our life that we must read tell us to
[31:52] stop whether we read those and believe
[31:54] them or not is up to us that's why some
[31:56] of you have fallen and you cannot get up
[31:59] but tonight that's why I'm here the boat
[32:03] needed to come through so he called no
[32:05] man said ok I've got time it's a long
[32:07] time before the train should come so he
[32:09] pulls the lever as you just saw and the
[32:10] big big huge stone steel bridge the
[32:14] gears started turning
[32:15] they started cranking the steam all of a
[32:17] sudden gears are moving and that big
[32:19] huge bridge is just starting to go up as
[32:22] it rises higher and higher he has to
[32:25] watch and make sure everything set
[32:26] everything's good everything's fine as
[32:28] he looks out the window he could see
[32:30] everything but the dad being a good dad
[32:32] keeps one eye on his work but the other
[32:35] eye on his baby one eye on the world but
[32:38] the other eye on his children you think
[32:40] God doesn't know where you are he keeps
[32:42] one eye on his world and one eye on his
[32:45] child no matter what you've done a word
[32:47] you've been it's one eye on the world
[32:49] but the other eyes on you he's watched
[32:51] you and he's kept you even though your
[32:53] train is coming down the track he
[32:55] understands that and even though
[32:57] sometimes see the red light he didn't
[33:03] see it so many times just say the train
[33:08] was early the boy can hear and see the
[33:11] steam and he looks this at Danny to
[33:13] train daddy Denny to trains early daddy
[33:15] you got a daddy hey daddy daddy daddy
[33:17] daddy daddy the track daddy the train's
[33:19] coming
[33:20] but the dad
[33:21] looking at the gears making sure he had
[33:22] enough oil making sure there was enough
[33:24] steam to get the bridge back down for
[33:26] the Train and then to what the boy knew
[33:27] one thing they listened the boy knew
[33:29] that his dad one time showed him where
[33:31] the trigger was it was a red lever if he
[33:34] pulls it the Train bridge with claps
[33:36] down fast and the train will be able to
[33:38] come across all the point knew was there
[33:40] were people on that train there were
[33:41] people that needed to be safe
[33:43] there were people in the head sometimes
[33:44] just with their friends having a good
[33:46] time like everything's fine they did not
[33:48] know that the bridge was up they did not
[33:50] know what was coming they're just living
[33:52] their life like you and me just going
[33:54] down the road just leave the whole thing
[33:56] doing the whole thing and the dad all of
[33:59] a sudden here's the train coming he
[34:01] looks and he said well my son he looks
[34:03] out and his boys gone he's like oh my
[34:06] god where's my son where's my son he got
[34:08] me he looks like just in time to see his
[34:13] son trying to save the day all he had to
[34:18] do was pull that lever he reaches in the
[34:20] pulley and the boy pulls too far and he
[34:23] falls in the hole now it's owned the
[34:25] Father and God the Father did you hear
[34:27] me God the Father has to make a choice
[34:30] it's his now do I save my son or god
[34:33] save the world but they don't even know
[34:37] they don't even know the greatest
[34:41] decision of his life he can blame it on
[34:45] them not seeking the red light he could
[34:47] blame it doesn't matter anymore
[34:48] pull the lever save the world leave it
[34:52] up save your son for God so loved the
[34:59] world that He gave His only Son
[35:33] they never would know I didn't even know
[35:38] the train goes by it's fine everything's
[35:41] cool two breaches down just like always
[35:43] it's always gonna be down for God so
[35:58] loved the world that He gave and you
[36:01] know what's amazing
[36:02] I wonder what God did right when his son
[36:06] died on that cross when he breathed his
[36:08] last breath when he took that breath and
[36:10] he fries it it was over just thinking
[36:26] about the person they're gonna see the
[36:28] people they're gonna hang out with just
[36:30] trying to be caring doesn't matter if
[36:36] you're blind doesn't matter if you're
[36:38] putting a little more makeup trying to
[36:40] look pretty for somebody you're just
[36:41] wearing another mask
[37:01] liquefying her
[37:12] but in one moment are you listening in
[37:14] one moment is the Bible says everybody
[37:17] gets a chance and one woman had to see
[37:19] the look of the Father when he knows
[37:21] what he did for you when you realize the
[37:24] sacrifice when you realize he let his
[37:27] son die so they could live when you
[37:30] realize what he did no matter what
[37:32] you're doing no matter where your
[37:34] retinas life no matter what you're part
[37:36] of you gotta stop you gotta stop even if
[37:43] it's for one second I think my god he
[37:46] did it for me
[37:54] pray to God you
[38:10] did
[38:14] that's why you're so quiet you see the
[38:17] trains but why do I keep doing even Paul
[38:28] said why do I do
[38:30] well flesh tells me and I do what I know
[38:32] is wrong and I don't do what I know is
[38:34] right you can understand tonight
[38:36] the fight is on and we can win we've
[38:39] become more than conquerors you Jesus
[38:41] Christ and I'm not preaching just for me
[38:43] I'm preaching on behalf of you but you
[38:46] gotta understand this there had to be a
[38:48] moment in those three days when Jesus
[38:50] died on a Friday and rose again
[39:02] when it was just God
[39:13] every sin that's ever been committed I'm
[39:20] here to tell you that as the Sun sets in
[39:22] the afternoon the Sun will rise again
[39:25] and when the Sun rises again you cannot
[39:29] change your past but you can't change
[39:31] your future you see it's always a
[39:33] different day one day someone lives the
[39:36] next day they die the next day you wake
[39:38] up and you're still living you're like
[39:39] what am I gonna live what does this have
[39:41] to be my turn
[39:42] one can see the whole picture here you
[39:48] see because when God the Father gave His
[39:50] only Son when Jesus Christ breathe his
[39:53] last breath that he died he did it in a
[39:56] way that you can never ever say you
[39:59] don't know me you don't understand me
[40:01] God don't understand my pain
[40:02] God don't understand my sorrow you see
[40:05] that's the very dream that was that boy
[40:07] was on that's the very tree that he was
[40:10] on and as this dad remembers look real
[40:12] close you see the pictures of the people
[40:14] BAM there's somebody added in a picture
[40:17] in the pan there they are do you see
[40:19] who's that and in it in every face of
[40:21] every person Jesus is in their life why
[40:23] because when you're the greatest
[40:25] sacrifice you always end up in
[40:27] everyone's life no matter where they are
[40:29] who they are he did it so that you can
[40:32] say he was there waiting patiently Jesus
[40:41] Christ was there all the time in the
[40:48] Train keeps coming train keeps moving
[40:53] people keep living people keep dying and
[40:57] God the Father
[41:03] the other I own you some of your second
[41:07] figured I'd like what is he looking for
[41:09] just one girl cuz he the whole horrible
[41:15] day God only had his eyes it was just a
[41:21] day
[41:32] and she's so
