[17:16] that's a great blessing for us
[17:20] you could just take your seats for a
[17:22] momentos
[17:25] I just want to take some time to greet
[17:27] each one of you this evening
[17:30] this morning
[17:32] the privilege to be in Tucson
[17:35] I was able to be at Jerusalem Tabernacle
[17:39] um
[17:40] with our brother is
[17:43] able to be there and greet the greet the
[17:46] congregation

[17:51] well
[17:52] I just wanted to tell you that he sent
[17:54] his greetings
[17:56] and then I'm happy to be back home
[17:58] tonight
[18:00] to be so kind now please stand up once
[18:03] again I'm sorry
[18:07] Ruby going into our scripture
[18:10] which would be Revelations 3 20 to 22.
[18:17] and we continue on the same topic of how
[18:20] can I overcome
[18:21] continent
[18:23] that's a really topic that we've all
[18:25] been speaking on um
[18:27] it's a very vast topic
[18:30] you know we listen to brother Brandon's
[18:33] message
[18:35] you'll always find something there is
[18:45] and then you can also find something
[18:47] there as well
[18:48] so the scripture reads
[18:51] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[18:54] any man hear my voice and open the door
[18:56] I will come into him and what's up with
[18:58] him and he with me
[19:09] with me in my throne even as I also
[19:11] overcame and sat down with my father in
[19:13] his throne
[19:14] series
[19:23] with the spirit says unto the churches
[19:39] okay here safely Lord
[19:43] no we thank you for all your blessings
[19:47] thank you for everything you do for us
[19:50] Lord now I ask that you may be with me
[19:53] they meet with my interpreter as well
[19:57] you anoint our lips
[20:00] of those listening
[20:03] whether that's here in the sanctuary
[20:06] maybe online
[20:08] or wherever the service reaches somebody
[20:12] may be a great blessing to them
[20:19] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[20:22] amen amen you'd be so kind of please
[20:24] take your seats sientos
[20:28] so the topic is how can I overcome
[20:31] you know as we just read the scripture
[20:34] you know the scripture are
[20:37] Prophet tells us this is you know it's
[20:40] addressing the Overcomer
[20:43] you know it's speaking to the Overcomers
[20:45] of laudice
[20:48] and he lets us know he knows that God is
[20:51] dealing with the individuals
[20:55] you know he's not just talking to the
[20:58] church
[20:59] it's he that overcomes
[21:05] it's the individual that overcomes
[21:09] so we also know that means you know we
[21:12] are in laudice
[21:13] and we know that every age
[21:16] it has its Overcomers
[21:20] also has its own reward
[21:24] but also every age
[21:26] it has its trials
[21:29] it has its tests it has its suffering
[21:33] tells us you know I was reading a little
[21:37] a bit of the Smyrna Church H book
[21:40] you know and I took what I could
[21:43] you know if you read those books no it's
[21:46] for me it's way too much
[21:48] so I just try to pull what I can
[21:51] but their brother man tells us
[21:54] there's no age that's free from it
[21:58] he's talking about the suffering
[22:00] there's no True Believer that's free
[22:03] from it
[22:05] he says this is God says this is the
[22:08] will of God
[22:09] he said it's needful
[22:11] he says we need the Lord to teach us the
[22:14] truth that we are to suffer and be
[22:16] christ-like in doing it
[22:23] and because love suffereth lung and His
[22:25] Kind
[22:27] so we have to suffer free you know and
[22:31] something that I find amazing okay
[22:33] is that God chose each one of us here
[22:37] he chose us to be this age
[22:40] you know what Daniel was a great
[22:42] Overcomer
[22:44] No Moses was a great Overcomer
[22:52] they were all great Overcomers
[22:55] in their ages but what about us you know
[23:00] what I find amazing
[23:02] is that God looked at us
[23:05] he looked at you no he said Alberto you
[23:09] know he said Moises you know he says
[23:11] you're not going to Ephesus
[23:17] you're not going to Sardis or
[23:19] Philadelphia
[23:20] I'm sending you in the hardest darkest
[23:22] age foreign
[24:27] concerning the fury trials which is to
[24:29] try you as though some strange thing
[24:31] happened to you
[24:39] in verse 13 says but rejoice in as much
[24:43] as ye are partakers of Christ's
[24:45] suffering that when his glory shall be
[24:47] revealed ye may be glad also with
[24:49] exceeding Joyce is
[25:01] so now it's not only telling us not to
[25:04] be surprised when we're tested
[25:07] but now he's telling us to Rejoice
[25:10] to rejoice when we're suffering
[25:13] so now you might ask yourself
[25:16] rejoice in suffering
[25:20] brother
[25:23] the test is the greatest thing that ever
[25:25] happened to you
[25:27] also tells us let me know it's one good
[25:30] evidence that God is with you
[25:32] know brother Bernie tells us
[25:35] in how can I overcome number three
[25:38] you know he's talking about you know
[25:40] being tested
[25:41] and he says you know you might think
[25:45] the greatest thing that can happen to me
[25:47] like
[25:48] someone gives me a cake
[25:51] or someone gives me a brand new car
[25:54] is
[26:58] his love was proven truly by the fact
[27:01] that we were chosen unto salvation
[27:07] you know in the scripture backs that up
[27:10] as well
[27:11] you know in Hebrews 12. everybody else
[27:14] in 12 6-8
[27:17] and that's where it says it I know this
[27:19] is for whom the Lord loveth he
[27:21] chasteneth and scourges every son who he
[27:24] receiveth
[27:26] yeah
[27:30] God dealing with you as with sons for
[27:33] what is a son is he whom the father
[27:35] chasteneth not she supported
[27:42] no what does it say in the next verse
[27:47] so bear with me
[27:51] be without chastisement
[27:57] ye are bastards and not Sons
[28:00] perfecto
[29:00] he
[29:02] has left his church a measure of that
[29:05] suffering
[29:09] foreign
[30:35] [Music]
[31:04] and if children then hairs hairs of God
[31:07] and join hairs with Christ if so be that
[31:10] we suffer with them that we may also be
[31:12] glorified together
[31:23] and so and then what does it say in 18.
[31:25] he says for I reckon that the sufferings
[31:28] of this present time are not worthy to
[31:30] be compared with the glory which shall
[31:32] be revealed in US
[31:41] so we're going to suffer with him but we
[31:44] can also be glorified together
[31:47] glorificados and whatever we suffer no
[31:50] matter how much it hurts
[31:52] no matter how difficult it is
[31:54] being told here in the scripture that it
[31:58] can't be compared it can't be compared
[32:00] to the glory
[32:01] Gloria that would be revealed in us
[32:04] and that's great
[33:03] but he overcame it all over what did he
[33:07] overcome it with he overcame it with the
[33:09] words each time Satan tempted him
[33:13] he used the word and that's what we
[33:16] should do as well
[33:17] and we use the word so we can overcome
[33:21] but we have to let him do his work
[33:25] no we do our part
[33:27] and he always does
[33:29] you know God never fails
[33:32] you know God's the same yesterday today
[33:34] and foreign
[34:16] we are the clay and thou are Potter and
[34:19] we are the work of thy hand
[34:21] foreign
[35:05] [Music]
[36:07] you know
[36:57] you know this one is one that takes me
[36:59] way back
[37:01] you know it's in Spanish so I'll be
[37:03] reading it in Spanish
[37:07] it's a song I thought a lot about when I
[37:09] was going through a tough time
[37:12] and I always go back to it
[37:14] and I like how they sing it in my
[37:17] Grandpa's church back in Mexico
[37:19] in Mexico you know the name of the song
[37:23] The Potter you know and it's a song I
[37:25] really like
[37:26] you know and I'll be reading the words
[37:33] but you know when you release that
[37:35] Revelation
[37:36] you know songs are no longer just words
[37:40] they become a testimony
[37:43] see yourself in that song
[37:46] it has that impact
[37:48] when you have that Revelation
[37:51] you can see yourself in this book
[37:54] it makes an impact in your life
[38:00] one day praying I told my Lord
[38:04] I am the clay model
[38:07] my life
[38:33] I'll transform you into a new vessel but
[38:36] then it says
[38:40] during the process I'm going to make you
[38:42] cry
[38:44] because I'm gonna make you go through
[38:46] the fire no maybe that's us
[38:48] we thought we were something great
[38:51] but then we come in front of God and we
[38:54] realize we're unpleasing
[38:56] no no no no no no no no no no and he
[38:59] tells us I'm going to transform him
[39:01] but the thing is you're gonna cry I'm
[39:05] gonna make you go through the fire
[39:07] and what's the fire
[39:09] it's those trials it's those tests it's
[39:14] that suffering why because if we're made
[39:16] of clay
[39:17] what does that fire it burns it hurts
[39:23] it's making us stronger making to a
[39:26] better base
[39:28] no maybe we might say you know Lord just
[39:31] patched me up he says
[39:33] give me a little bandages
[39:37] but no what is God saying
[39:54] I want to smile when everything's going
[39:56] bad
[39:58] I want to worship while you're
[40:00] complaining
[40:02] I want your trust while you're going
[40:04] through the hard times
[40:06] and I want you also learn to forgive
[40:08] what have we been listening to in these
[40:10] tapes
[40:12] I believe last week
[40:16] that the base for faith
[40:19] is forgiveness
[40:21] and here the song tells us you know when
[40:25] everything is going bad
[40:27] I don't want you to complain I want you
[40:30] to smile I don't want you to do a
[40:32] tantrum
[40:38] I want you to give me worship and I want
[40:42] you to be confident
[40:43] when everything is dark I want you to be
[40:46] confident I know that that's tough yes
[40:49] we are going through something difficult
[40:51] you don't want to smile I don't want to
[40:54] smile
[41:16] he says my brethren count it all joy
[41:19] when you fall into diverse Temptations
[41:25] says knowing this that the trying of
[41:27] your faith worketh patience
[41:31] but let patience have a perfect word
[41:34] work that you may be perfect in the
[41:35] entire wanting nothing
[41:51] by believing what he said
[41:54] and by conducting myself
[41:59] with joy amidst the trials
[42:03] that he and his wisdom
[42:05] has allows us to come to pass
[42:09] that's how we show our love we're going
[42:12] through some we're suffering
[42:14] we conduct ourselves with joy
[42:17] why because this isn't random
[42:20] God is allowing in Japan
[42:23] and it's for a reason is
[42:32] we should kind of wire heads
[42:37] dear heavenly father Celestial Lord
[42:40] thank you for being with us tonight Lord
[42:43] I thank you because we're all so blessed
[42:46] here Lord
[42:48] no you truly are so good to us
[42:52] you're so wonderful
[42:54] I know we sometimes we feel like we
[42:57] don't deserve it Lord
[43:00] but that's your Amazing Grace
[43:03] so I thank you tonight Lord
[43:06] and I asked for anybody who might need
[43:09] something
[43:11] Lord we are the clay
[43:15] You Are The Potter us
[43:18] to your liking
[43:20] we know it's going to hurt
[43:22] we know it's going to be difficult
[43:27] so I asked for all my brothers here Lord
[43:31] maybe the ones watching online

[44:53] we're here just to make a simple prayer
[44:57] just to say a few words
[45:06] not too long ago maybe a few hours ago
[45:09] um
[45:14] for those who don't know who she is
[45:18] a mother of sister Ana zacarias yeah

[45:34] she went to meet the Lord
[45:40] you know how much we appreciate the
[45:42] Reyes family
[45:51] we couldn't do any less but just tell
[45:54] the people
[45:57] then we can understand a little bit yes
[46:07] foreign
[46:23] [Music]
[46:39] Psalms 116 15.
[46:42] is
[46:48] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[46:51] death of his Saints
[46:55] when a person finishes their Journey
[46:59] the Lord picks up their vessels
[47:14] because we're still in the flesh
[47:20] is
[47:25] because we have lost our mother
[47:29] the feeling is very similar
[47:31] um
[47:35] the only thing that can help us is our
[47:38] prayers
[47:39] so to be able to continue on
[47:43] it's like they take an arm away from you
[47:45] okay
[47:47] they take something away from you that's
[47:49] very special
[48:03] we know how deep that pain is
[48:09] there are certain wounds that heal
[48:12] but the scar remains
[48:15] it doesn't hurt that much anymore
[48:19] but there's a mark there's a woman
[48:23] there's her deeper scars
[48:26] you can't see in your body but
[48:29] it does
[48:31] get to the human being Historia I heard
[48:34] a story
[48:37] or a reflection
[48:40] [Music]
[48:43] when a ship left at the dock
[48:46] [Music]
[48:48] and everyone saying goodbye to the loved
[48:51] ones

[49:00] but
[49:01] when they get to their destination
[49:03] [Music]
[49:04] when they're getting there
[49:07] many people are saying hello
[49:09] they're receiving them giving them a
[49:11] welcome
[49:12] party that's when a person passes away
[49:19] so long here is
[49:26] but on the other side of the river
[49:28] is
[49:29] many people are receiving them
[49:32] to such an extent
[49:35] they didn't want to come back
[49:39] because the well-off they are all on the
[49:42] other side foreign
