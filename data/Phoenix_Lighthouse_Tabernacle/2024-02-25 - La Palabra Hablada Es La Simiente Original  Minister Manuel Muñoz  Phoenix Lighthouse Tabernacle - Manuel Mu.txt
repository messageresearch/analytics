receive the Holy Ghost s or when you believe I challenge you to bring me the Greek I've got the original Greek in my own possession I have also the aric and the Hebrew also each one says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe by faith are you saved that's your faith in God the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice the blood doesn't save you the blood keeps you

time are not worthy of to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US in US for the earnest expectations of the creature got a little got a little word there little Mar creation is right in Greek expectations of the creation the creation is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the Manifest of the sons of God it's waiting for the church to be into who was the son of God when Adam where was his domain the Earth he right he wasn't El he was Jehovah that is I am God and I made some lesser ones under me and I'll give them a dominion and in their domain the Dominion under them is the Earth man had dominion over the Earth and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested we're watching for the coming of that glad Millennium day when our blessed Lord away oh the Earth is groaning crying for that day of sweet release that Cor waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is I I can work here get another one over here and place him I can place him adoption placing manifesting taking out here a ceremony with an now if he's told the truth now if he's just making up something it won't work no no that that won't work we've had a lot of that but I mean but I mean manifestations of sons of God when God and then he goes forth and what he says is truth what he does is a truth what he does he manifest Christ how you the way heays the word that's how you know all man is by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no in says leave them away now let's read then we'll have to stop because our time's getting away all right

don't think there's a better place where we can [Music] be taking advantage of time it' be so kind please open up your scriptures we'll be using our base scripture uhis which is in Genesis 1 we can indicate with an amen once you have it the Bible reads in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the [Music] darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day I'd like to jump to verse 11 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit true yielding fruit after its kind who seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was [Music] so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after its kind and the true yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after its kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day now I'd like to read another scripture in it'd be in John chapter 1 [Music] the first first verse reads in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not let us pray Heavenly Father Here we are this morning Father Lord you saw this scene already even before the foundation of the world you knew who would be here this morning Lord you need each person that would be watching us throughout the [Music] means you know the heart of each one of us father Lord you know our needs you know us even better than we know ourselves father we ask you this morning Father we open up our Hearts to thee to us this morning Lord and give us that which we need Lord I have no words father I trust in you this morning Father you be able to speak to every heart Holy Father give us what we need father because we trust in you we put ourselves in your hands this morning we give you thanks for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats Brothers um it's a surprise for me to be here they told me I would be preaching on the last Sunday of the month in February and it feels like they just told me yesterday for me right now it's currently a very difficult time for those that know me this is my main time of work and many times it's difficult to make time because time is only 24 hours a day sometimes I say why did they only give us 24 hours but sometimes it is us we're the ones that don't know how to manage our time we are Our Own Worst Enemy and I'm not a person who's out of the ordinary I'm always going against time I believe brother bam says that time is the worst enemy of man sometimes we think we have time to do this or do the other but then all of a sudden we find ourselves out of time in this time that we live in it feels like time is going to get much faster I remember when I was young I when you want I already wanted to be 21 years old things that perhaps children could not do the other day one of my clients I told him oh I would like to go back in time he was 33 years old I told him I would love to be 33 years old but I thank God for all the experiences for all the trials for everything we go through because everything that we go through Brothers it's for a purpose all the good times and all the bad times and we didn't have bad times then we would be able to appreciate the good times and many times we complain because it's too hot or because it's too cold it feels like we're never satisfied but I believe that God he gives us what we need to place us in our position truly for me um I have seen my brothers speaking on the topic of the spoken word is the Original Seed and it's a very large topic sometimes I look at the cake and I like to grab some from here or grab some from over here but this morning I want to stay a little bit simple believe God hides himself reveals in Simplicity many things we complicate things we want to understand it in a certain way but God is simple God is a God who hides and reveals himself in Simplicity and he's brought us a great message through a great prophet and that was the simplest way so that we could all understand but sometimes we overthink understand this that or the other but I believe that there are Mysteries there are many Mysteries in the Bible but God gives us according to how we grow it's just like a child there are certain things you don't talk about with them until they reach a certain maturity you can talk about other things with them at that point and I believe that God is the same way he gives us according to what we are needing this morning I'd like to speak a little bit on the topic of the original seed for me Brothers God has G me certain understanding if I could say it that way when my eyes were opened that we're the same material as our Lord Jesus Christ truly when he died at the cross the Bible says that he was hurt by a spear and water and blood fell onto the Earth and for me I can see that that's where the bride tree was planted and that's where I was that's where you were brother that the Bible says that he came to his own for they knew him not but he gave power so all those that could believe in him they can be saved and they would be called a Son of God so through adoption he has called us children but we have come out of him we're the same material sometimes when I speak with couples I say sometimes we struggle to understand when your couple where did Eve come from she came from the riv of Adam she came from his own body and it's the same material and nowaday I can understand that God is in each one of his children a portion of God in each one of us that's why when you can reach the understanding of says when the bride recognizes who she is is nothing that can stand in your way the words that you ask you desire what you ask for with your words you are a a a meaning God a you can bring Gods into existence world world you can be sorry you can be worlds into existence you have the power with your words that's why we have to be very careful what we speak what we say because those words come out and they're recorded in time and those words have power I speak with certain people brothers and I notice how they direct themselves towards their children some I say oh you're a dummy or you're so foolish when I hear those words I'd like to get them and tell them say because that is what you are creating or raising because when you talk to your child in that manner that is what you are creating we have to be careful how we speak to our children as parents we want the best for them but we have to be very careful because we are creatures in our words they have power so it's better to say God bless you or my son how smart you are what a good job you did keep going those words are much better because you're creating an atmosphere you're creating a world there so then we have to be careful because our words they have power truly with my family try to teach them or show them sometimes how to speak because sometimes we say things that we shouldn't sometimes we say joking around I hate you like for example saying it's a very strong word sometimes we say just joking playing around but truly we shouldn't do that it's better to say I love you because our words have power we can bless or we can curse and truly we need to be very careful with that truly for me when I see the power of our words you have that power brother because if the seat of God is inside of you if God is in your heart then you can ask what you may and God will give it to you but you have to believe it when you have that revelation of who you are don't be afraid to ask from God many times we limit God I was one of them brother I would say how is God going to give me this sometimes you make yourself small or unworthy but truly Brothers if we knew who we are we are the best Carlos I think I now remember our Brother Carlos he said it once I believe it was in Africa and I like to repeat it because I believe it just like when a team when they're tied and they're going into overtime they send in their best players and if right now we're in the end time and time is already at its end we are those that God has placed in this time when we were over there we chose to be here knowing that this is the most dangerous time it's the most deceitful time but why why is it the most dangerous and deceitful time because right now as the last time I spoke there is many religions there's many people who go to church and they think that they're doing right and the Devil is a good adversary brother sometimes he knows the exact way to approach us and truly Brothers he knows our exact [Music] weaknesses and for me it's been quite the battle because I'm a person that truly sometimes I struggle I make myself small I like how they say I don't like to be in the spotlight but I know that God has a purpose we shouldn't hide the gift that God has placed in our heart you have words to share with your brothers that can give life to a brother God has given me the privilege to travel with my pastor sometimes I feel like what am I doing here but I trust in God and I seen his Almighty hand in my life and I I believe that he has dealt with each one of us here this church we see that is under under construction and that is sometimes how I myself feel just like that old colored lady said I'm not what I ought to be but I know I'm not what I used to be and it's a step it's a path it's a battle but the most difficult brother Bernie says is to Die the seed Brothers has to die it has to rot so that it can bring forth life if you have a seed here brother and you don't plant it you don't place it in the dirt so that it may die it may rot then it can't bring forth life and that is what we have to do we have to die to our own ideas we have to die to our own thoughts that's the most difficult brother brother brandham says who wants to die Bernie brother Bernie says who wants to die he says we need a massacre we need to die to our thoughts to our ideas to our theories so that God may come in that's why Paul said no longer I that live but Christ lives in me we need to surrender ourselves completely to him but in this time there's a lot of self-centered people or selfish people just like La they fight for their rights have their rights of this or this rights of that this time we felt art Lots live in where everybody is fighting for their rights that's the time we are living in but for the bride Brothers there's been an escape door a door that you can enter in a door that is open enter in through that door and escape this age and that door is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the answer all of our problems problems that you could be having anything that you're going through he is willing and he is waiting so you may cry unto him sometimes he allows us to get ourselves in those situations so that you may seek him out more just as we heard the story of that Shepherd that he broke the leg of that lamb or that sheep many might think well that's a very bad Shepherd but truly he says no is that I love her so much that I always want to have her by my side and that is how God is with us he wants to have fellowship with his children he wants to conversate with us just like a father with his children he wants to have that Fellowship Brothers forgive me Brothers I wanted to have a presentation I want to have something that we could display on the screens I tell you time is always against us and truly Brothers I give thanks to God for everything that he has done for us because all the trials that he has given us it's to place us in our position it's to place us where we should be the way back and the brother BR Mage the way back i' like to read this short paragraph because I believe in my heart brother that's the most important is to be born again because any other way we think that we could know this that or the other and it's good to know but we have to be certain that we have been born again because that's the only way that we can enter in and that sea that God has deposited in US SE that's each each one of his children who that sooner or later it has to come forth it has to burst open has to come forth you have to be the same as God to be like Jesus that's why we sing that song to be like Jesus be like Christ that is what we desire that is what want because it's the most important thing knowing that we have been born again and that we are part of him because in this walk there's many dece there's many ways there's many paths even the Bible say there's path to a man appear to be straight but we know that there is only one path and that is the Lord Jesus Christ on the the way back says he says listen any birth is a mess I don't care whether it's in a pig pen or or where it is atess it is a mess any birth and so in birth so the new birth will make you do things that you didn't think you would ever do but it brings life and before you can have life you have to have death he says before a seed can reproduce itself it's got to it's got to die in order uh not only die but it's got to rot in order to get new life and it's got to die and rot in itself and so does every sinner every man no matter how highly he's educated or how much he is polished or how many degrees he has in the church or so forth or how many colleges he is educated out of he has got to die to his own theory he has to die to himself he has to die to everything to be reborn Again by the Holy Ghost it will make him cry it will make him speak in tongues and jump up and down and carry on like a maniac but he has got new life and that's what it takes he has to got to have new life so then Brothers the seed planted in each heart of each Son of God but in order for it to give life there has to be a new birth we have to die to our way of thinking and that's the most difficult part because who wants to die fight each day says that it's a daily [Music] fight it's you fight inch by inch and in this life we will fight to reach our goal but the fight doesn't have to be you on yourself by yourself that's a problem many times I'm somebody who tries to do things on my [Music] own I have learned through my mistakes truly sometimes it is better to ask for help God is waiting for us sometimes he lets us he lets us make a mistake so that we can learn the lesson and truly that is how we learn Brothers sometimes through our mistakes to be able to learn the [Music] lesson but we don't always need to make the same mistakes on an occasion I was speaking with my wife she says why do we always make the same mistake honestly she was talking about me she says if you know that this is going to happen why do you do it then and truly Brothers I believe I've heard once that what is the definition of what is insanity insanity is to do the same thing over and over and expect a different result and truly Brothers we have to learn from our mistakes but God is there to help us you don't have to do it on your own you can grab onto God's hand and with him all things are possible we want to do it ourselves knowing that God is there waiting on you the Bible says that he is a gentleman he is at the door he is waiting he may surrender to a a completely surrendered heart but we're the ones that Harden ourselves and we don't let him come inside we're the ones that put a Hal to God brother Bernie says how much time will it last until as long as you want it you're the one who holding God back he is willing he is ready he wants to give you everything but he is waiting on you you're holding God back we could be on at the bench for 20 years many brothers have given that testimony they been at the bench on the Pew for 20 years many times it's because ourselves we hold ourselves back but we have to let loose we have to exercise our faith if we're children of God then ask to God he will do it brother his children whatever you want any need he's ready to give it to us he wants to give us more than we can ask for so then that seed has been deposited in each heart of each children of God and what do we have to do if I plant a seed and I place it in the Earth or in the ground and if I don't water it it will not grow brother Bram also tells us that we have to water that we have to give water to it so that it can grow so I can give fruits look brother a seed as small as it is let's say that it's an orange [Applause] seed all the oranges that that tree will give already inside of that seed imagine what God has deposited in each one of [Applause] us everything that God deposited in you you need is to take you from this Earth until your home we're just passing a temporary time a time frame that God permitted for each one of us but this is not our home this home that we live in house that we live in it's a temporary body but we have a we have a representation and that is what we day after day we should be seeking seeking more of God because truly Brothers we can possess all things but you will take nothing with you sometimes we worry about bills we wor about our house for our cars for all of those things but truly we will not be taking anything this is not my home I'm simply walking through and God has provided a home a home for each one of his children and truly that is the purpose that is why we came to this life to just go through and brother Bernie says our decisions they equal our destiny God gives us we're free moral agents we have to decide you have to make that decision to follow God he is a gentleman he's not going to force you he is waiting on you you now that's what I would like for us to understand because many times one is the one who's holding him back God wants to use your hands he wants to use your mouth or your voice he wants to use but he needs a surrendered body completely surrendered to now I can understand when brother Bernie says that it's God Christ he has to be your brother for me I didn't understand that but as you become the same as God now I can understand why you can pray for brother brother Bernie says you get to the point where God no longer intercedes and now you can inter for your brothers if you are like God then you have the power give life to whomever you desire you have that power brother because God is in you when we reach that realization you are an amateur God or small God doing what God wants to do were the works of the when he poured himself out at [Music] Pentecost deposit in his people in his bride in his people and now you are doing The Works of the holy spirit says God can do nothing without man he needs man needs you he needs every son or daughter of God to be able to fulfill his plan but we have to surrender we have to ask of him for him to come in and open every [Music] window I know brother B talks about doors in the heart I know we have doors in our heart there some that we have things that are so secret that we don't want nobody to know about or very deep things but I want to open my heart I want God to go into the deepest part of my heart I don't want to have anything hidden because we are naked before God you can't hide from any you can't hide hide from God in anything he knows us so what are we going to hide we have our heart this morning brother and let him enter into us he can come in and water that seed so it may bring forth life and it can give fruits you have so many things to give because you are a small god you're an amateur God but it requires but it requires for you to surrender completely and die to our way of thinking to deny ourselves and that's the most difficult thing to do in this time when you begin to ask for stuff or acquire things or acquire things you begin to tie yourself with things like I like my house a lot I like this car it hurts you that even if they scratch it but that is all just vanity that is all vanity it does of no good the most important is what we have here truly God is good with us such a good and kind God that he's given us Grace it's not because we are good people it's not because we properly behave ourselves what is Grace it's an undeserving gift it's a gift from God it pleased him to give you not because you behave yourself not because you come from this family it is God's choosing he chose you decision that you would make because he knew that you would choose him and he chose you he chose me for this time brother to be able to fulfill God's plan and God has a purpose for each one of us I'd like to thank my pastor for the opportunity he gives me I know that his birthday is approaching I know that he's not here happy birthday but I'd like to tell him happy birthday truly for me when God opened up my eyes to be able to know who that person is is a very special for me he is very special just as brother Bernie brother brandham I would have liked to be with brother Bernie but now God gives me the opportunity to be with Monto a very special person and truly God places those people in our [Music] path to be able to help us to be able to guide us and the trust that he has in me I wouldn't would not like to let it down because to me he is a very special person and when I came to the lighthouse I struggled to say that brother Monto is my I don't know how many went through [Music] that but it was a struggle in my mind because we always had brother Bernie when God reveals to us who is behind that Veil then you can see God and that person that God has placed and that's the way God is he hides in Simplicity he hides behind the veil but we can look Beyond and see God in each one of our brothers because that is what God wants he wants to dwell in each heart he wants you to open that door so that he can enter in and dwell or abide in each one of us so kind of please stand time has gone by time goes by fast but this morning Brothers the most important thing is to die to our way of thinking die to our desires and let God come into our [Music] heart and let him do what he pleases with your life let it not be me that chooses what to [Music] do may be him who guides me and I can do what he wants because the worst thing that I want is to get there and think that I have done the right thing and be mistaken I want God to have complete control of my life I thank God for my parents truly God places the people the right people in your way let us pray Heavenly Father Lord you know my heart this morning for my mistakes and my errors Lord I am human mistakes father we make mistakes daily [Music] father we know that you are an advocate we know that you're there go to that Throne of mercy and ask that you help us you forgive us our mistakes and our errors sometimes our iniquities father because we know father that there are things
