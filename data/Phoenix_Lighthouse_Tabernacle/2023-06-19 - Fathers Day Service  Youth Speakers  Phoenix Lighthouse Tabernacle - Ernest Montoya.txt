and it's reads hear ye children the instructional father and attend to know understanding oh it is for I give you a good Doctrine forsaking not my laws for I was my Father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother but yet dear God thank you for letting us come to another Sunday in your house thank you for everybody come here safely on this Father's Day yes I want to thank you for letting me have a father and those in the audience I have a father too yes again Lord I thank you okay please let me find the right words to say today and in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so I like to my pastor again give me a chance to express myself here today [Music] you know I'm using the back on the computer I'd rather make my dad look good online but uh I'm still here today in front of you guys so I'm gonna do my best please again I'm not really good at expressing my feelings and putting my words so looking at what makes a father it's commonly said that they usually teach life skills or lessons being a role Modelo their presence support responsibility this is what they say what traits and what fathers do and so look at is um I've seen families that I grew up not seeing women or sometimes they did or then they were abusive clearly and I'm still friends with some people to this day and it's really clear to see the difference between having a father and not having a father Yes and for that I'm thankful to wake up every day and have a superhero when I said and it's funny to say superhero because you know when I was little yeah there's the amount of rules my dad had yeah and make me think he's a villaino but the type of I'm the type of person that always likes to be right and my dad's always the type of person to always be right so I wonder where I got that from this is so every time I try to argue my dad it's always pointless because the more I think about his view he's always right he always seems to be 10 steps ahead of me from experience and he always tells me about his experiences he tells me what to do and what not to do sometimes and the exact outcome is what he'd always say is he tells me stories from his childhood more examples what to do and what not to do it foreign it's Evan at home he's a leader yes and not just at home he's a leader to me too you know whenever I look at him I see a great man hombre no matter what he does I always see him do good whenever he messes up I don't see it turns it around again he's my superhero my name is well my dad's out on the missionary field he's quite frankly always out and I sort of miss him but never fails every time I do miss um my phone lights up or my mom's phone lights up it's either him texting or calling checking in on me everything he does is for me he always repeats that towards me too every choice he makes he always thinks about me and that's what I think a father should do yeah sometimes I might not show it to him clearly yeah it says but I really do appreciate what he does for me he has unconditional love I can mess up sometimes but his love is when I mess up or do anything that's wrong I always say I can't do it or I don't know how to do it my dad doesn't get fat as a matter of the fact that I can't spell the fact that I say I can't say he tells me why is that your vocabulary he tells me never to say can't or never this is the easiest way really Tommy never say nevertheless even when he comes home every day good day or bad day I see how he treats everybody at home he never gets married if he will have a bad day at work [Music] and that's him being a role Modelo Never Letting anger take the best of him at home how he treats my mom how he treats me my brother he treats me my brother with pure love and he really does show it I have a lot of uh uncles in here too all my all my cousins their children are my best friends Amigos I grew up with everybody all my uncles and they're all like a father to me but the one uncle that always been there for me when I was little um he's my son like my second dad yeah that's why I call him Papa Chewie he he was there when my parents were busy at work my mom at work my dad at work I know a lot of my cousins say he would they were raised by him and his mom and his wife [Applause] God bless you and I'd like to wish you all a Happy Father's Day and before anything I'd like to thank my pastor yeah for having the trust to let me speak up here behind this pulpits now to go straight to the point what does it mean to be a father and what I found what it means to be a father is to be caring I said uh here look with that thank you he's someone that comforts you again someone that protects you again someone that loves you again someone that disciplines you I didn't get the discipline for what is Love Without correction and for me the most important is being a guide is damaro because the signpost he points towards Jesus Christ always wanted me to follow in those steps follow that pathos I believe that makes the father proud the most is that knowing the fact that his sons his daughters and a little bit about my father he was born in Mexico in Mexico in a very very humid environment similar to here but slightly hotter and more humidity and he came here to Phoenix over I want to say 25 years where he met my loving mother and together they had three crazy Sons with whom he had to put up with and probably especially my little brother God bless my father so for dealing with them and one of the most memorable things about him was when I had one of my pets they sadly they had sadly passed away and my father was here to come for me which is something that I'll forever be thankful for him I know that he's a very strong man but what I like the most about him is that I know that he never fails to have his sons in his mind even when he prays maybe he may not mention us but he'll always have us in his mind always wanting the best for us because he loves he loves Usama but he also knows when to punish us to discipline us because if he didn't love us then he wouldn't discipline us yeah and another one that I look to as my father is my grandpa is which I don't really get to see him mucho but thank God that for the past two or three years that he's been here in Phoenix and well I've spent more time since he lives with me and I've learned things remember and another father that I would like to look up to that all of us look up too is our father the Lord Our God he places his teachings in our fathers to show us El Camino and he Lo he loved us that he became flesh to suffer and die for us he became flesh to know our pain our suffering that's where we find life and one of the stories that I've heard my uh brother Javier says it was when we went to San Luis like a few weeks ago foreign the son acts asks the father how big is God and his father points to the sky and this is a small airplane or an airplane far away flying and he said that's how big God is he said and the sun said then he looks modern but the father told them to come with me I need to come to the airport and when he saw the planes there looked big because they were there and then the sun says that's a that plane is big and the father tells them to come with him again and they go in front of the plane and it's massive and the son says Dad it's Matt it's big and what I want the points that I want to get from there is that The Closer you are to God the bigger he is in your life and another one that I pulled out is that a good father will always raise his son in the Lord now on uh once again I'd like to wish everybody a Happy Father's day everyone that's a father here or everyone that has a father that may not be with us whether somewhere else or whether that they may have passed with the Lord but I know that they'll see them again and we'll see our heavenly father Celestial once you reach inside his throne God bless you [Applause] bendiga yeah foreign for those who don't know is my mom's dad this is and um one thing that I remember he he's he's been in my life ever since I was born you know and as someone who's always been there to care for me care for his family and someone who's got one of the kindest Hearts uh he was the first one to share some of his notes with me and I had I had never spoke before so I wasn't used to it and I was wondering what should I talk about this is he was the first one there to help me out yeah that's something I'll never forget because he's always got that help in hand yeah someone um not only a wonderful grandpa is um but a wonderful father and he has three kids my Uncle Albert mitio Albert my Uncle Paul Pablo and I did want to talk a little bit about my Uncle Albert as well Albert because he is also a father and he's been in my life ever since I can remember right yeah and one of the main things I wanted to bring up was he was my Sunday school teacher [Music] dominical I believe I was 12 to 13 year olds around that age and the reason I'm bringing this up is because he had an influence on me as a teacher and he was someone I looked up to at that age and they he taught me so many things that have helped me to this day yeah whether it was about God or about life and one day he wanted to bring the that same class back because it had discontinued for a while okay and the person he has to teach me obviously I was no teacher Maestro and I was questioning like why would he ask me I'm sure there are several different people he could ask way better than me and so I was questioning like why would you do that but at the time he didn't need someone but I knew had it been anyone else you know say it again if it had been anyone else I probably would have told them now but it was because of the trust he had in me I knew I had to trust myself and it was the respect I had for him that I told him yes and to this day yesterday I'm glad I'm able to teach just like he taught me yesterday and I'm thankful to have an uncle as great as him he's also a father with a daughter loves her with all his heart and I'm sure everyone can see that and I'm thankful I still have a grandpa today because I never knew my dad's father for those who don't know my other grandpa now one of the things I've noticed yeah my dad um tells me this is uh that every time he sees me playing an instrument he would be reminded of him because um his dad had a gift for plain instruments at his church yeah he would play I believe it was three instruments which are the three instruments I play I'm still learning to play my dad and his brothers Hermanos always told me stories and like what he was like at church as a pastor come on pastor and what he was like in La Casa I'm sure I have a ton of stories to share about him some good ones some not so good ones with his sons and um because my grandpa had a strong relationship with God and I was I was able to I see how he was able to teach each and every one of his kids because today you know I see them and you know they all have a strong relationship with God you know they're all successful in life and so I know they would talk well by both their parents and uh you know my dad told me that he wish he could ask questions to his dad about the Bible about life and why he did things the way he did yeah and I'm still glad that I have my dad to his day I feel very blessed to have my dad a father as great as him and now I want to talk a little bit about my dad someone who loves God again cares about his family and also has a strong sense of humor um it was around Christmas time last year December and he sent me a message and he was saying um how us too we're going to speak on Sunday did you tell Maya said again I told him did you tell my mom yet he was like no no no no no no no no no I'm like what's wrong because I want to freak her out okay imagine what she's gonna be like when she sees us to walking from here and uh so not only that you don't know but he also invited my Grandma I said yeah his mom and so uh after we finish speaking we head to lunch and my mom was so annoyed she told me like why didn't you tell me like he told me and especially my grandma my mom's mom she told me that she was telling her yeah he says why didn't you tell me anything he said well I didn't know and so and yeah so one of the things yeah my other grandma was the same way she's like why don't you tell me yeah well they didn't tell me anything he said sister you don't do that and I actually wanted to tell a small story about how my dad is able to understand people so in this situation he was able to understand me and so I would say it started about in November it was around the convention times [Music] and they were they were just ending and I realized uh whenever it got hot or warm or anything my skin would feel all irritated and my skin would turn a little bit red from me scratching it I couldn't sweat and it if it got too hot when you feel like it's too hot you know we live in Arizona that you you start to feel like you have to sweat but instead for me my skin will get irritated and it had happened before yeah but it would it would come for a day and then began the next yeah uh so I assumed it would go away but I was wrong and by then it had only gotten worse eventually I had to see a doctor you know they ran blood tests things like that after they were through the doctor told me the one thing I I didn't want to hear she was like you're a mystery I like Greg so they referred me to a dermatologist you know for those who have gone to see the doctor you know how difficult it could be to get an appointment I checked to see the most available times is about two months and it was annoying living like that every day one thing I remember before I went to the new doctor uh it was probably back in April it was I believe it was April it's my month to clean look it up the church here and the last day of the month I have finished cleaning in the morning I had gone outside and you know I realized the weather was getting worse and I'm outside instead of sweating I feel my skin all hot irritated you know it was terrible and so I'm upset I just remember being angry that day I said yeah I got the car I'm outside my dad asked me you ready to go yeah let's hurry up I'm just like I just remember being upset I had I had already told him about it you know I'm like this thing's still with me it's not going away I don't know what to do like it had been continuous and I just got so angry yeah and you know because I was outside for five seconds and so after the night service we're driving home is you know in the car I'm looking in the mirror story I'm like man it's starting to spread to my face it's like what are you doing like look you can see it right yeah but acknowledging it isn't going to do nothing better you prayed about it right I was like yeah so now you just gotta believe it you know I've been telling my students all these things of how important it is to believe but how's that going to work for me if I wasn't even believing at the time and to give an example we were at lunch one day it was just me and my two parents and it started getting high in the restaurant you know my mom would hate seeing me like that she was like what's wrong like it's the same thing is I don't do that it freaks me out but my dad's like live on he he is going through something that it's it's bad for him basically yeah you know because it's not something common right like I don't blame you if you don't understand like uh my condition I was in foreign and so um that's that's one of the things my dad understood me yeah and there weren't many people who did you know you know whenever I told them about it are you crazy and like I remember the first time it wasn't always like that though and the first time I told my dad uh I told him what was wrong I was telling both my parents and he was like all right you just don't worry about it but in time you go to understand and that's something I appreciated and so I trusted his word and this is but I believed with all my heart because I would always expect it to be there the next day and that was a problem and so I went to the doctor you know I was a little nervous I had never been in this kind of situation before and so what happened is that was back to normal and I'm thankful that my dad was able to be there for me okay for me and able to understand me because I know at times there could be times where you you wonder services do they really understand me and that that's one thing I appreciate because my dad was able to understand me at the time and I could tell that he was taught well by his father by his mother and overall he's always been such a caring person yes love this family and always someone who's trustworthy someone I can rely on um shows respect to others which means they will show respect to him someone responsible responsibly takes responsibility as a father responsibility takes responsibility of being you know a dad of a family of you know he has two kids having a wife and overall I'm just thankful you know my sister I feel very blessed to have my father my grandpa and Mia Willow my uncles and I'm thankful to have a father like God as well because whatever the situation may be some people may not have a father but they do have God and he's a father to all of us and I'm going to close with this I just want to say Happy Father's Day so those who may be watching online and hopefully you have a wonderful Father's Day [Applause] I'm not going to take a lot of time maybe a half an hour to an hour I have a I like to see your smiles what I'd like you to do is sit and the only ones I want standing are the fathers so if you're a father just stay standing God I thought I had more fathers than that what I'd like to do for the fathers is give him a clap offering thank you gracias I also want to acknowledge first of all hearing with the three spoke I knew brother Francisco your dad your uncles it was my pastor just so you know I went to church in Juarez and brothers everything that you don't know about him he was genuine he loved to laugh maybe not in front of a lot of people but he would laugh I'd take him I'd drive him to Phoenix and those times I lived in El Paso and we would talk at that time I think Nate you might have been maybe two years old Danny might have been a little older Daniel uh I I knew Danny's dad a friend of mine one of the individuals that would tell me your Spanish is horrible but at least you try so I was able to know the brothers from Juarez two years ago maybe three years ago I talked to Brother Carlos I said we're going to lose our young people if we don't put them to work I cannot lose the young people the majority of the time they're the ones that are going to be doing everything they're going to be speakers they're going to be working in the back in the audio they're going to learn everything in order to keep them busy I never knew it would come out to this that we have the cream of the crop and the young people and the reason I say this is I'm looking at your jeans I'm looking at your genes where your Dads Dads I'm looking at your desk where they came from and what they taught and the discipline that they gave people may not agree with discipline but let me tell you discipline and obedience plays an important part and what your kids will be when they get to be your age and they have kids of their own that's what it's all about is the next Generation coming are they prepared have we prepared them enough to understand that someone paved the way I look back I see brother Francisco facio the way he was leaning on a Persona putting all his faith in one man Garcia put all his attention there because I spoke to English you'd ask me questions and I'd look at them like I don't have the answer for that but this is the way he was he believed in people he believed in a future I left in the late 70s mid 70s because I heard the voice of an individual that my pastor followed him in his name again not ashamed to mention it a man that would give you his coat whatever he had that's why he used to say don't give me money give it to the sister give it to Lily because every time somebody gives me money I would lose it put it in the pocket or as Trini would say it went from his hand to somebody else that's how he was and we forget we forget who brought us a message was the individual stayed there day and night praying for us so that we would get to a level that they were in that's called a father what we should do in life we are the byproducts we are a byproduct of our father and they were a byproduct of their father and they were a byproduct of the Lord Jesus Christ so what is it to be a father I've heard attributes of a father each one giving recognition descriptive words is Paris but a father cannot be a father it has to be at the same time that a son or daughter is born that he receives the name or the title of father he can't be a father unless he has a child in this case he cannot be a father until the moment that the son is born then he becomes a father that's what we've been taught that's what has to be talk to our children the same way it was in the beginning he loved the world so much that he gave his only begotten son no let me tell you the son has to give the father a gift what gift will you give your father your heavenly father if it's not your son if it's not your daughter if it's not a stepson but it will happen that we will in turn give and Jesus or Jesus Christ give his father a gift and that gift is you and I let me say it again the gift that Jesus will give the father is again and this is what they're not my words excuse me where did he get it from the person called William Marion what brother Bernie said he took it from Brother Branham can you say Amen so we are not following a new doctrine you're not following a person that has his own character his own ideas I have a vision my vision our vision is the same position that our forefathers had that's when souls for Jesus Christ and how are we doing it there's the example that you are doing your work your responsibility I look at our kids and they are the best I'm amazed I'm happy because what we have produced so let me tell you I want you to do me a favor father stand up without you the vision that we have the vision that brother Brennan had the vision brother Bernie the fish in the Francisco The Vision the brother Dolores Dolores that's his first name correct Danny that's your dad's name we had a nickname for him but I'm not going to say it I think he gave all the boys nicknames and I would tell you it but I don't want to embarrass anybody again thank you gracias now this is the goal always remember it's your son good or bad it's still your son don't ever say something contrary to your son because you don't know the time nor day God has for that individual to be transferred into what you want him to be what you desire as you see young people sooner or later the same thing that has transferred these young people will transfer your son somebody said well transfer your daughter our job is what one person said love amor unconditional love fathers turn around look at each father turn around look at yourself or look at your your neighbor I salute you I say to you continue work that you're doing within your home take your seats I'm not going to say too much I know many of you are going for a feast Fiesta well let me tell you I'm going to a feast but before I go to a fish I want the musicians to come forward before I go to the face I want to recognize the counterpart the counterpart the countercorn the what brother Paul used to say the mate the meat thank you I want to recognize because without that other half without the other half we wouldn't have what we have if you're a mother I want you to stand up because you play an important part in this [Music] you play an important part thank you [Music] I love you all others as a person was saying believe that's what you need to do he said look don't look at your son don't look at your daughter and say while they're waywards look at your son and then remember what you were yeah when you were that age remember yourself when you were growing up in the message and the pastor would tell you something and you would ignore it like what does he know no look at what you're going to bring forth so that that's what I live for I live for one thing for the vision that we have and that Vision will continue it will not not leave us it will continue as the Muse uh director of song service comes forward I'm trying to think in Spanish language if you have something to give God praise foreign [Music] let's praise God today [Music] for our children [Music] and the song I want you to sing it's whatever is in your heart because Danny's not up here yeah I can't put pressure on the song leader sing me a song [Music] we created a miracle we created America [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Applause] [Music] don't you love him don't you love him I want the whole building for the roof to leave when you say I love Jesus you know I just heard one person I love Jesus Jesus so I'm gonna face a feast of the people that are found you have the victory sing this song [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're always praying for him foreign [Applause] thank you above all power above all Kings [Music] for the world because [Music] it rashes up [Music] sir what [Music] where you were [Applause] I am yes you live to die [Music] [Music] behind the storm [Music] [Music] above all power above all power in the bubble key of all nature and all created [Music] the world of all Kings [Music] yes the world has ever known that's right it's wrestle and there's no way to smash your one [Music] [Music] and I bought all you were crucial crucified [Music] one more time very slow and you were cruel survive laid behind the storm you live rejected [Music] before and thought of me above all right and I will enter in its gates with Thanksgiving in my heart and I will enter in his course [Music] say this is the day that the Lord why will rejoice for he has made me glad ask me has made all it has made me glad and I will rejoice for he has [Music] cake with Thanksgiving in my head I will in his courts [Music] [Applause] and I will rejoice for he has been [Music] good and he passed because he [Music] had a choice of God [Music] God bless you brother let's
