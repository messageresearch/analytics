[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so so [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i got the message in about 20 minutes for wednesday night and this is what i found if you open up your bibles to ephesus book of ephesians chapter one and verse four i don't know if it's me or it's hot in here it seems like the temperature's really hot i'm going to ask for mercy one more time and see if they'll place a fan up here get it so we can get a little circulation here amen according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love when did he choose us don't unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he predestinated us to what i will know how you go i can't hear you jose when he got married do you understand i want not only the living room but also they sold the kitchen goes to the bedroom it seems like a hurricane daniel hit that bedroom all the drinking glasses are no longer in the kitchen they're outside in the in the grass or with friends somewhere that in the natural so you can see it in the spiritual i'll give you a little bit of spiritual so you can understand what is the name of the pastor of phoenix tabernacle what is the name of the pastor of phoenix tabernacle foreign there's a big difference between a child to an adopted son when you're a child have no rights that's why is is to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace having made note unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him of times in the message adoption page 102 in english is bless us now as we approach the word and father that knows the reason that i'm approaching the word from this very scripture here it's because that i feel that you want me to do it this way that it's your divine will it's in your order it's in the order of the day to let the people positionally find their place and be ready for the hour of battle as our brother said in his prayer to you not long ago oh you have trained us so long lord aura now father give us our ranks to what we're supposed to do put us out there to what we're supposed to do so we can be about the father's business for we ask it in in jesus name thy son amen so here he is asking for ranks just give us our rights our title our office and when god places one then oh all the p all the whole church wants to be like that one we are cut out different we're made different we are nature different and we are positionally placed different each one for a different work giza maybe one for just a little kind of a work another for a large work video i believe it was david or one of the prophets i forget now said i would rather be a doormat at the house of the lord than to dwell in the tents with uh wicked but they're in spanish i'd rather be like the carpet is one thing and the carpet is [Music] you can enter a very beautiful clean house it's got carpeting on it you want to enter there without any sand or mud or snow on your shoes forgot to manifest a doormat it's a phoenix tabernacle i'd rather be a doormat in god's house and to dwell on the tens of wickedness can you get ready now it's not just a little thing then it's a mystery god's will is a mystery okay and each man has to seek out the will of god for his or her self god's mystery we have to seek damascus in the light like a pillar of fire and it called him and he went to arabia and was in their dwell three years don't you imagine that that was some time brother pablo renting him a little building somewhere walking up and down the floors all the scrolls they didn't have the new ones i'd like to insert this yeah elderly sisters english sisters i cannot come to the services i don't know if they're here this morning but after so much time i was able permitted by god to go visit them yesterday see i i sense that god had held me back for me because i'm responsible for you she's 80 what day is it that we're like [Applause] every man has [Music] all the old scrolls they didn't have the new ones paul wrote them mostly right in these old scrolls that he would send jesus that through this sacrifice we would all have right to the tree of life those who he called he has already now the whole creation is growing esperanto growing waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god paul had a wonderful time i'd like to have been there with him when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now when were there ever a time in the history those that manifest a time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was before all the old testament there couldn't have been manifestation have to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to a manifestation of sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close to christ till it will join him and his church together is manifestations leave it settle down somebody has to leave you something to inherit is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what inheritance did i have i didn't have any enema i didn't have any but god left me inheritance when he put my name on the line's book of life before the foundation of the world oh you say now wait a minute brother jesus did that when he died for you no no he never jesus jesus come to inherit to came to purchase the inheritance for me read the very next line adoption page 114 in english has predestinated us into his inheritance right inheritance of something if god is knocking at my heart and saying william branham i call you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel of eternal life god has sent jesus to make the inheritance real to me because there was nothing i could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there was nothing i could i can do but in the fullness of time god sent in his own good time jesus a lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that it might be go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance the sonship to be a son of god but did you know that men that are sons of god are amateur gods how many of you ever know that how many know that jesus said so jesus said the bible jesus said not your law say itself that you are a god and if you call them gods which god said in genesis 2 that they were gods because they this is he lost his sonship he lost his sonship he lost his dominion the main and satan took it over it doesn't seem like that he lost his god he lost he lost his sonship there's two things he lost is is is not very far away this morning is foreign oh is [Music] because you need [Music] what kind of children [Applause] is let us know young man you forgive me amen you we're gonna call rainbow we're gonna be together meditate
