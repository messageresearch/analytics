just returned from a missionary trip with my pastor but it's always good to be home the the best musicians [Music] yourself in simplicity in the most simplest things even in the morning when the sun is rising it's such a great accomplishment you are the great i am in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen says the greatest thing you can wish upon your brother yes god bless you and yes it is but you're asking for a blessing from god foreign i have some notes that the brother and i have read when brother brown speaks and marvin predictable brother branham would preach he'd have his notes and i've seen some of his notes when he would preach [Music] the word of god is but christ become a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with these hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us scientifically for the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes have been heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh spiritually how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spots of god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god take your seats may the lord have his blessings to the reading of his word it's buenos to be back home and be able to see every one of you not only at home where i live but this here is my home you're my brothers and sisters in christ yeah and as i come home see my parents my family my children that's how i can see every one of you there's a saying is sometimes you don't know what you have until it's lost maybe if you haven't lost it but you have had it without some time you appreciate what you have at home in the simple things as i said we just got back from lima peru by god's grace over there it's winter time it was about 52-53 degrees and the temperature just reached up to about 63-62 degrees are you a little jealous because of my weather i'm in no medical anatomy she said don't talk about it the weather was very nice we enjoyed our missionary trip we went to inaugurate a church of brother carlos a very beautiful church [Music] message this is not the big things that are gonna hold us back from going into the rapture is incredible and it seems insignificant the eternal god the suffix 1661. he came and formed himself in the cell of a virgin doesn't matter my brother one time was telling me that he heard that uh that they told that only the ministers and pastors will be in the rapture so he was talking to a sister so this sister was scared so she went to go talk to someone else look a pastor told me this see what happens sometimes they haven't read the message and the brother said they'll be there more women because the woman is more serious he surrenders so the church is a type of a woman jesus who the first i want to go search for for jesus christ we can surrender it will be a correct attitude that we have and when the word of the lord comes to a true servant whether he's prepared in other words whether he wants to or not he says he never goes for foolishness and this is the difference garcia apostle brother bernie garcia he only goes in the name of the lord for one thing he's got a mission of the lord you know that every one of you goes we are representing every one of you they sell them out of brandon brother you know what's the success of my conventions you don't have to do it no it's an obligation it's not an obligation but she does it because of love because sister will say when i get your father's shirts and i begin and that's a and it's not the great things that we share with them yes it's the simple things people want to know how much you care about the people i don't care how much you may know one is willing to help them and i believe that's what our pastor is projecting okay sometimes we're misunderstood but it's simple brothers on a monday and i'm getting everything ready that i need that i need for my missionary is yente people very happy religion without expiration the atonement the atonement my father was speaking the gospel to a customer the person came and said i'm not going to sometimes why we are the way we are yeah if you doubt whether you're a son or daughter of god [Music] and he was kindly opposed of divine healing he's changed his mind since then but that afternoon was fifteen eighteen hundred people were sitting in the or 800 auditorium sitting in the auditorium el salvador he preached on christ the savior of the world and asked people if they'd come down and accept him [Music] yes now let's see how brother branham's group looked i know many of you know but we're reviewing entrance mine come in on crutches wheelchairs came straight jackets you know what a straight jacket when a person is insane and they have to similar things brother bernie would say certain ministers that couldn't work brother bernie would say if you don't work you can't eat it no that's trash thank you for giving us the spiritual food at its right time to raise me up that's a different thing for your faith to bug something like that come down accept christ and be saved but when you have to prove what you're talking about that's right when jesus christ comes down and makes but brother as long as in his gospel and he promised it don't let one thing thank you because he will do it that's true he will do it and as many as he shall find bid to the marriage so the servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests colombia peru colombia pedro por los caminos africa africa vietnam vietnam mexico mexico at all lugares all places del cordero to the wedding supper of the lamb el senor may god bless you [Applause] stand up for a minute please you know god is real there's only thing one thing we need to do do not allow your mind to be preoccupied let me say it again do not allow your mind to be preoccupied and the reason our mind gets preoccupied we live imagine we are dealing with real live spirits this is the generation we have 200 million spirits that are attacking each person daily it's a mental she's almost it's physical physical you have become the prey of the predator the predator that cannot and we don't know it you know los angeles how many of you believe the pandemic is over it's not it's getting what i like about peru the mass that we wear the blue ones the mascara matter of fact if you're not if you are not a citizen of peru what are they going to ask you for i can't hear you i i guess old age does things no i'm just chasing you i can hear five or six different conversations mentally or if you're just thinking i'm gonna hear it before you enter somewhere a restaurant they ask for your vaccination card now i have a question a simple question how many of you drink starbucks coffee stomach cafe starbucks oh come on man i mean i you worked there how many of you drank starbucks coffee cuantus estamon cafe starbucks there's nothing wrong with starbucks i love starbucks at home i don't drink coffee the mission fail i'm not done with you get up here he's getting nervous on me in the mission phil that's all i drink is coffee i want you to tell me your experience with starbucks what happened at starbucks they didn't let me go in because i didn't have my booster shot thank you how many of you have booster shots don't raise your hand just think about it you wouldn't be able to go in starbucks in starbucks let alone a restaurant my concern has always been simple and what worries me a lot yes i worry about each individual in the church individuals not only this church but through all the world i get messages day and night early in the morning late at night i wonder if they think i sleep asking do i need to wear a mask all right raise your hand up when you're at a church and you go somewhere do you wear a mask think about it when you go out to have a good time are you wearing a mask just because i've had four shots received more so when they get behind a pulpit and they have a microphone this is part of my message for next week they spit scooping on the microphone they don't clean it not only you pick it up guess what just happened all the journals that the devil has are gonna you're gonna get it you need to carry a bottle uh okay that little bottle we bring out and someone clean our hands the the hand sanitizer you better have one cargo because it could be your brothers died because they were having a thanksgiving feast i don't like to go to large groups of fiestas or parties the young people there must have been about 50. well i just didn't want to preach to young people i told myself no i'm gonna let danny do it danny has his charisma he likes to speak and we got there at church at what time in the morning nine o'clock i didn't leave until seven o'clock nine a.m 7 p.m i'm not a young uh thoroughbred i have a time period that i take a nap because everybody wakes me up about 11 30. for me to answer a question i never answer the question i just say i'll be praying for you mentally every little button that somebody pushes we get upset the bride no lanovia should be doing one thing preparing herself for that meeting that means one thing pray pray pray i need you and my life [Music] he wanted to talk to me about religion i spoke with him for about an hour two hours three hours he gave his heart to jesus let me say it again he gave his heart to jesus but one thing he did tell me what's my family going to say what are my friends going to say do i have to do this no i have to cut my hair can i wear shorts oh some shorts can i grow a beard oh uh not old enough but he had all these questions yourself to jesus christ he will change you the pastor can't change things it has to be an experience that you have with your lord what why don't i have three or four services why don't i have a youth campaign put those souls in danger i have to give an account not you no i have to give an account for everything i do wrong for and somebody gets sick and passes it's me it was i got to do what god told me to do and if god said one service excuse me i gotta go with this service i can't listen to people because we are living in the age of that of laodicea where people go from home to home good and bad of what we should be doing because they need money i sorry i get paid uh five thousand dollars a month no that's not what i told you i missed i'm not looking for your money i don't need your money of all the churches from voice of restoration this is the church that they're gonna learn from what they're gonna see as an example what love love i don't care what yesterday it looked like i want to know what today is going to be what's going to keep us away from the rapture is that i haven't established we haven't established pure love in our hearts don't worry about yourself worry about others look at the person next to you that's the person we pray for constantly praying constantly it's not easy in the mission field the hardest if i would know today or if i would know yesterday what i know today you according to the spirits that governs you espiritu that governs the person shall not die he was deceived and understand one thing the same message the same spirit you must be through that one receives the other one received i jump in the spirit the tears are gonna jump in the spirit i mean it's not in them it's over them the tares do not have the holy spirit all it's doing is doing this the holy spirit is that in them sooner or later those stairs will be burned so i ask you today somebody approaches you i can't stand you no tell what do you think we're still part of the bride of jesus christ i love them i can't have anything against anyone and think that i'm going to make it won't make it and if i don't make it my group won't make it who's my group give me your group sorry forget it who's my yes paul garcia junior taught me no es la primera mess not the first time ultimately you're gonna be the last esl that's what i believe in pastor without pastor is not in phoenix not in phoenix not in glendale all over the world including phoenix
