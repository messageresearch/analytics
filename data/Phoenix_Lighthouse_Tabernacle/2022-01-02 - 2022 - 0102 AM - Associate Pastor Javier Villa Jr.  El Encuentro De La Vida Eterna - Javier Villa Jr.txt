control of all things help my interpreter myself every one of us we place ourselves before thy presence in the glorious name of their beloved son our lord jesus christ amen amen is you could help me read this scripture demarcos going to open up to the book of mark [Music] hoping that the lord also blesses you the word of the lord reads like this following brethren the word reads and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running annealed to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one that is god. testimonials the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother helen and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth jesus then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing they'll lack is go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and that shall have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me reflect and he was sad at that saying and he went away grieved for he had great possessions and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god jesus and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth answereth again and saith unto him children how hard it is for them that trust enriches to enter into the kingdom of god [Music] it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god but with god all things are possible amen amen this is the thought which we'll be speaking on this morning we'd like to call it the encounter of everlasting life i'm taking this message he preached two messages called leadership in prescott arizona one of the priests in prescott arizona california the other one in covina california 1965. everlasting life and how to receive it this morning i'd like to bring something very simple which caught my attention and particularly help myself i'd like to share with you that we're going to call it the encounter of everlasting life brother branham speaks very must be able to take advantage of the riches of the word of god this brother brown speaks of this uh young rich ruler but when this young rich man approaches jesus he goes before the lord before jesus and kneels before him nowhere does it say that he's rich so we do not know that this man was rich [Music] that stood out special tremendous man one of the characteristics that he was a prince principal a man that was in charge of a certain ruler uh uh he was a certain ruler a tremendous man a man who had influence not only influence but had a lot of possessions he was an exemplary person not only with education but also had knowledge of the scripture a very obedient and educated person so he was a special person uh instructed the correct way i like how brother brandon mentions it uh there will be someone there to watch our last steps someone will guide us someone will be there with us maybe it won't be someone there physically there will be someone who sees our last steps and says he was admired from the people around him brother ben speaks on this picture would we believe it's the hoffman yes this is the one where he speaks of the rich young ruler we know that this young rich ruler [Music] besides him achieving so many things he knew he needed one thing that's when he came to the lord and asked him senor lord kneels before him what must i do what do i need to achieve but i like one thing no tengo said lord that stands out at and when jesus begins to speak to him so go sell whatsoever thou hast now after you've sold everything you have lost give to the poor he didn't have that that value he didn't have the the courage to be able to take that decision because he had achieved so many things prophet speaks on this message how this uh young rich ruler of transport immediately transports him to another scripture he's the same one that's the rich man with with lazarus in luke 16 19 [Music] there he'd be at the gate at the entrance of the rich man's home he saw and desired to fill himself with the crumbs or the leftover food but for him to be able to quench his hunger without that the bible speaks in luke 12 16. about the the foolish uh ruler eston puerto rico this rich man what am i going to do with so much money that i've accumulated i know what i'm going to do and i'm going to build even uh bigger warehouses and i'm going to collect even more things when i accumulate all these things i wanna see where it is here now i will be able to say the scans alma seoul right enjoy life enjoy yourself so you can enjoy all the days of your life scripture reads jesus says today this evening this tonight will ask for your soul and whose will it be everything that you've accumulated he places those scriptures with the same character miramos [Music] scripture reads that he answers it says what is it that you want he said please tell lazarus the tip of his finger there's [Music] the greatest gift to reject everlasting life when the opportunity was given to him he rejected it this man the scripture tells us que lisa i want none of my own family members to be here where i'm at mandela send someone it's better if someone goes and resurrects them from the dead and they'll listen they say no say no i wanna see noah they won't even listen that way they are here they have the prophets eleven wasn't able to understand because the scripture says that this man trusted in his riches not trusting in the word a man instructed in the law jesus and when jesus finds him jesus jesus tells him the exact same thing that he told the rich young ruler a middle post was healed that's why it's necessary for the son of man to be born to be raised when he's raised they who believe on him nicodemus and it's repeated for us exactly the same but for us for us to believe to know that the word has not changed because that's how we uh obtain everlasting life juan cinco de cuatro la paris john 5 24 tells us unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life brother what must i do with your heart jesus christ except calvary and have everlasting life jesus speaking here jesus brother that's all i have to do yes brother we must believe why brother because it's this simple but give us an example the same scripture we just read prophet then you will have to become a part of his everlasting being is that right and if you become a part of this everlasting being that makes you a son or a daughter of him to him which exactly fulfill what the scripture says we're sons and daughters of god is that right no this is the essential part notice notice what the prophet says speaking of eternal life he says when did you get it when you shouted when you went to the altar when you spoke in tongues there's people who can speak in tongues amen that's right and yet not believe this prophet says we have worked them up to evidences and have made you can pin a man down because he's done this that he's a christian like the rich and rulers prophet makes a declaration he's a christian because he believes us you're a christian because you believe here's a key notice in his own life bears the fruit of the spirit no matter what he does in other words holy spirit no matter what he does ben si i see and everlasting life is perhaps 95 percent or maybe a hundred raised up christians they're christian here's the key brethren as long as you believe that establish all right but the minute that you begin to think that you're not is a moment that's the time you start sinking right there is salvation your salvation the same because everything of god is by faith [Applause] and nothing of god's can be proven by natural america our faith makes the difference with this i'll be closing notice what the prophet says with his wife i said if god would come to this room and would say i'm going to give you a choice to live another 50 years and you're going to go through poverty and sickness and troubles have to be rejected especially [Applause] and despised and have a terrible time you're going to have to beg every meal that you eat in the next 50 years at the end of those 50 years you'll have every eternal life but i'm going to give you the whole world and all the money and turn you back to 18 years old make you king over all the world for a million years but at the end of the million you'll and your life will manifest what you have in your heart so the prophet says in the message he must be born again and i'll be finishing with this la gracia what is [Applause] what grace is and [Applause] so the experience of the the experience uh of being born again tells us what we are why are you preaching to us this in the new year because it's time the reflection to uh reflect obey you know and don't believe that you don't have everlasting life remember let us pray father father we thank you puerto pala for your word how good you've been to us we give you the honor and glory this morning help us to serve you each day better are you help us every one of us we love our lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] foreign [Music] my oh [Music] so
