TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] me [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] uh [Music] my [Music] um [Music] now [Music] so [Music] huh [Music] hey hey [Music] hey my [Music] hey [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign [Music] so [Music] my [Music] [Music] so [Music] and [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] i baptize you i baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and i might try you are no longer responsible i believe that sin will be broke up when it's confessed under the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's just like dropping a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plum back to where it come from and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does then that sets a man across the chasm again as a son this is where judgment comes from is verse 12. [Music] and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were just out of those things which were written in the books according to their work i'm going to ask you a couple of questions being that each one of you has a book with us brother's going to put there in english of david the book of david the type of person that says all this is from my neighbor that applies to the deacon the minister and there's the other people type of person he says who told the preacher what i had done isn't that true and then there's the third group just to find me foreign a lot of people would like that the book would be written with pencils so we can erase it and make changes but it's written with ink and if he speaks was already all we have to do is apply that message to our hearts this yeti it says like this i believe that sin will be broke up when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's just like dropping a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox because everything that we're doing is being written is foreign of the blood we say that that is a public confession and the people hear it but they forget that there has to be confession otherwise there is no yo i believe when sin is confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ let us say for example one day i accepted jesus christ i was baptized in christian baptism and i am not ashamed to say god forgave me [Applause] i believe you can say the same thing the other day i saw the quarter from campo i asked him for a quarter [Music] i'm going forgive me lord and then go to god then if so then it is the sin is remitted totally and she went to the psychiatrist and to the doctors and nobody could cure her the reason was she had never confessed herself she was afraid that her husband would divorce her that's it is he's a liar [Music] computer 1710 foreign put your name upon it i lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother branham i have sinned again and i'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if i can be restored holy again please help me brother branham i have a devil in me help me will you lay your hands upon me and restore you have not sinned here's the answer you have not sinned my friend so far in god but what you can be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you'd never want to be restored see but as long as there is something dealing with your heart you're still in line if there is something in your heart i still of the leak is guilty of the whole so you can understand that a little white lie little white one or adultery that's goodbye you're guilty of the whole thing you say just a little tiny little line you're just as guilty homicide is guilty of the hole i have seen many times every day every one of us do things that we don't want to do you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask this question that itself is the proof that god is still dealing with you possibly probably satan telling you that you can't be restored he's a lion certainly he is that's why the wound is he does not want you to confess he doesn't want you to go to the fountain of the blood we want you to stay there with that infection and here's a liar but you feel something in your heart continuing reading reading the question now will you lay hands upon me and free from that but not there are certain people that wait for the band will say the word so they can be free so they can be perfect you already have the perfect interpretation of the words if you have the opportunity but he stayed on the ground because he thought he was still okay forgive me that's where we are no no no no we don't call ourselves john's but we're a bunch of giants they were they're tied you accepted but that still wouldn't set you free until you accept what he done for you that's just me saying [Music] is says that's where you get freedom and justification when you're willing to say i'm sin i'm wrong that's what you said many he will be lifted just rise up on this lifeline of faith move right on up into the rest of the eagles uh gonna look at you again god bless you like illusion i knew you were here you're going to fly with me let us fly over there nail it down from the book what shall i do with jesus called christ i can have your faith page how do you say barricade in spanish oh a man fights his way to hell but you continually run through the red line you run over the barricades you're reckless you want to do it anyhow you're some big girl that flashes her eyes at him and the first thing that young man does there or not i'm a man already said you did this never the ticket is a liar is that right i just walk in the door and they run to their bedrooms oh what are you trying to hide no i don't know but that's because isn't that true your own conscience tells you according to the word that you're not right and you have a need don't let these words fall in sony grounds let us pray foreign raise is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] me [Music] yes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Applause]
