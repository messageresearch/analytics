[38:38] Brothers Just As You Are pleaseed by
[38:39] your
[38:41] heads Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly
[38:44] Father we give you thanks for everything
[38:46] you
[38:48] do sometimes we don't realize that
[38:50] you're there next to
[38:51] us you always have
[38:56] been but devil has has taken upon
[38:57] himself to deceive us but you as a good
[39:01] father you're always by our side thank
[39:04] you
[39:06] Lord I place myself in your hands put
[39:09] your people in your hands in the name of
[39:11] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[39:22] amen vietn this is where will be
[39:25] continuing with the report from Vietnam
[39:30] if you can please project it up
[39:38] there I was away from home in Vietnam
[39:40] for about 16
[39:42] days it's a little
[39:47] difficult including the time that you
[39:49] spend at the
[39:52] airport the time you have to be there
[39:54] before until you arrive to the place
[39:59] it's about 26 to 28
[40:02] hours so it's a little bit
[40:06] difficult so when there's the crying out
[40:08] of the
[40:10] people so now I understand a little bit
[40:12] more the men of
[40:14] God maybe you can tell them that God
[40:16] loves
[40:18] them that they're awaiting for you with
[40:20] that
[40:22] anticipation then the tiredness goes
[40:25] away then God takes control the
[40:29] situation but it is a bit
[40:32] difficult by the grace of God we're here
[40:35] brothers so let us go to the
[40:38] scripture Genesis 1:1 from
[40:43] 1-5 in the beginning God created the
[40:45] Heaven and the
[40:52] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[40:55] void and darkness was upon the face of
[40:56] the deep spirit of God moved upon the
[40:58] face of the
[41:02] waters and God said let there be light
[41:04] and there was
[41:08] light and God saw the light that it was
[41:10] good and God divided the light from the
[41:17] darkness and God called the light day
[41:19] and the Darkness he called night and the
[41:21] evening in the morning were the first
[41:23] day may the Lord add the blessing to the
[41:25] reading of his word you may take your
[41:29] seats God bless it's good to be back
[41:32] home and see each one of you once
[41:34] again you might ask
[41:37] yourself what is brother doing in
[41:40] Vietnam well let me tell you what the
[41:42] scripture
[41:43] says says in Romans
[41:50] 9:26 and it says it's not of him that
[41:53] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[41:55] God that showeth
[41:56] Mercy
[41:59] so for me it's always been a privilege
[42:00] to trouble with my
[42:04] pastor I want you to know that's one of
[42:06] the most difficult trips that I've had
[42:07] to take if it were up to
[42:10] me but it's not up to
[42:12] me I wouldn't go
[42:16] back but the
[42:19] brothers that takes everything
[42:22] away when you begin to get to know newer
[42:26] Brothers
[42:31] as the scripture says where were you
[42:32] when I created and the sons of God
[42:36] rejoiced so then you feel an
[42:38] identification with
[42:39] them that
[42:41] that that removes everything
[42:45] else because you want to have fellowship
[42:47] with your
[42:50] brothers now brother this is the city we
[42:52] went to this is hoim Min
[42:54] City because I don't know what to expect
[42:59] well Vietnam there's jungle there's war
[43:01] and other things going
[43:02] on but that's how the city
[43:05] looks it's a very modernized
[43:08] City I want you to see how what it looks
[43:12] like I took this photo this how it looks
[43:14] at
[43:16] night it's so difficult even to just
[43:19] cross the
[43:20] street because there's so many
[43:23] motorcycles and the motorcycles get on
[43:25] top of the of the pavement
[43:28] on the
[43:30] sidewalk go on the sidewalk where
[43:32] somebody is
[43:34] walking if you're and if you're not
[43:37] careful if you're not careful with your
[43:39] step then they take you with
[43:42] them and they almost took me a couple
[43:45] times but my
[43:47] pastor he told me get ready learn how to
[43:52] walk even to cross the street it's a bit
[43:55] difficult this is the city
[44:04] there's Alleyways if I could put like in
[44:05] in the movies when you see that there's
[44:06] bad people in the
[44:08] alleys that's how it is
[44:11] here it's a very difficult
[44:14] country the people are not very smiling
[44:17] or
[44:18] happy automatically when they see the
[44:20] aspects or your
[44:22] features they know that you're not from
[44:25] there and they almost want to start up
[44:27] something with
[44:30] you they're very maybe confrontational
[44:32] the people from
[44:36] Vietnam so sometimes you feel a little
[44:38] bit
[44:39] intimidated but one knows that you're
[44:41] going with
[44:43] God and besides I know that I'm with my
[44:45] pastor I know who he
[44:48] is so with him I gain
[44:51] confidence well if they want to square
[44:54] up that's why you have to look at it in
[44:56] every way
[44:58] you have to look at every
[45:00] aspect the devil is at every
[45:03] corner he's like a roaring line looking
[45:06] for home to
[45:07] devour and soon or later he's waiting
[45:09] for you to not
[45:14] focus look brother because we got there
[45:16] we rested for just about a
[45:19] day and they picked us up at 4 in the
[45:22] morning and then we drove four hours to
[45:25] get to one place son this is Brother son
[45:29] Gwen and brother Tron Tron Tron Tron TR
[45:32] on Tron
[45:37] on and I'm showing you this because this
[45:39] what we ate the majority of the
[45:43] time and even when I was a child did I
[45:45] eat so many
[45:48] vegetables but there I had to get used
[45:50] to
[45:52] it and it's a bit
[45:55] difficult
[46:01] and I'll say this for the brothers of
[46:02] Vietnam in order to honor
[46:04] them I know the brother won't understand
[46:06] me but I'll tell
[46:14] you it's hello my name is Eli and God
[46:17] bless
[46:20] you and we begin to have the love for
[46:22] the
[46:24] people so you begin to appreciate them
[46:27] what they
[46:29] have now this is here the first church
[46:31] that we
[46:32] visited it's about four hours from the
[46:37] place on the way there outout there
[46:40] they've changed completely the
[46:41] vegetation because they removed the
[46:44] jungle so the brothers that congregate
[46:47] here uh they're uh Farm
[46:53] Workers they work on what they call gum
[46:55] trees
[46:58] or rubber trees that's what they
[46:59] dedicate themselves
[47:01] to here's our pastor
[47:04] preaching with The Interpreter brother
[47:06] son
[47:08] Gwen here's where he first called the
[47:10] pastors and the
[47:13] ministers here there's a tradition
[47:15] because everything is
[47:17] different you going into a house a
[47:19] church or wherever you may be and you
[47:21] have to remove your
[47:23] shoes so you either go barefoot or wear
[47:25] socks on
[47:28] so at first you feel a bit
[47:30] uncomfortable but you see how they do
[47:34] it to respect their laws and their
[47:36] Traditions that they have here we're
[47:39] praying for the people and here's the
[47:42] congregation there was a lot of
[47:44] Deliverance
[47:45] here I felt the presence of
[47:49] God from the first
[47:53] prayer you could feel that they were in
[47:55] need of God
[47:57] so the most that you need from
[48:00] God he is willing to give you whatever
[48:02] you
[48:04] want but when you pray with that
[48:07] anxiousness then automatically he comes
[48:10] down but he's waiting for you to open up
[48:12] your
[48:13] heart and the people were
[48:17] happy here they spoke Vietnamese in
[48:19] another mixed
[48:22] language but God knows all of the
[48:25] languages
[48:29] and here where we were where our pastor
[48:30] and from here went where the other
[48:31] brother is
[48:32] at the brother with the white
[48:35] shirt I forget the name of the
[48:38] brother he's the brother that's in
[48:40] charge he has a small
[48:43] church now the brothers have
[48:47] nothing but with all their heart and all
[48:49] their savings and everything they
[48:52] do they try to make the best Church they
[48:54] can for the Lord
[48:59] and here's a place it's a bit
[49:01] difficult I look at it almost like a
[49:03] ranch back in
[49:05] Mexico that they have their animals and
[49:07] other stuff but they have they don't
[49:10] have any
[49:12] money like they said in the morning they
[49:14] win they earn about 97 cents an
[49:17] hour and there you're not allowed to
[49:22] worship the majority of the churches
[49:25] are oh they're
[49:29] because the government doesn't the
[49:30] government doesn't allow
[49:32] them the brother that's in the white
[49:34] shirt that's brother's
[49:36] son what he told
[49:39] me it still shocks me to this day it
[49:43] breaks me down he says I want to
[49:46] know how the brothers
[49:49] are that can worship
[49:55] freely
[49:58] and that hit me pretty
[50:00] hard because we don't know what we have
[50:03] here they would like to be where you're
[50:06] at I know I've told you many
[50:11] times but to this day his words are are
[50:14] echoing in my
[50:16] heart you can express however you
[50:19] want and they're so
[50:22] limited and with the little crumbs that
[50:24] they
[50:25] have it's like gold for them and they
[50:28] appreciate it a
[50:31] lot that's a path outside it's very
[50:34] far and when I took this
[50:37] picture automatically this scripture
[50:39] came to
[50:45] mind it says and the Lord said unto the
[50:47] servant go out into the highways and
[50:49] hedges and comp compel them to come into
[50:51] my house that may be
[50:55] filled that's why almost nobody goes
[50:57] over there because so
[50:59] difficult you have to be careful with
[51:01] the government be careful of other
[51:02] things if they catch you speaking ill of
[51:05] the
[51:06] government in the city there's cameras
[51:08] there's microphones there's
[51:11] everything they could um throw you in
[51:14] jail for
[51:16] treason it's that difficult
[51:19] brother but even so the seed of
[51:23] God there is God's seat there they're
[51:27] just crying
[51:29] out and giving things that there could
[51:31] just people that people that could still
[51:32] go
[51:34] there it's on a in such a hostile place
[51:36] and difficult
[51:39] place this is the brother in charge this
[51:41] is the
[51:43] son and I told him let me take a photo
[51:45] with
[51:48] you sometimes people say brother you're
[51:50] my hero because you this that or the
[51:52] other but what they
[51:55] do with sense that they
[51:59] have they give all their heart they give
[52:01] their
[52:02] lives to have what you
[52:04] have and even so they're
[52:08] surviving that's why I asked them give
[52:09] me the honor to take this photo with
[52:12] you the son I wanted to give him
[52:15] everything but only God
[52:18] knows and from there we going to go eat
[52:20] once again more
[52:24] vegetables thank God for the vegetables
[52:26] they're very good for
[52:28] you I don't know how many pounds I
[52:33] lost I didn't see any fat person in
[52:37] Vietnam so it let you know that
[52:39] vegetables are good for
[52:42] you they felt like they just yanked them
[52:44] off the Garden or from the
[52:47] grass and I didn't even ask just herbs
[52:49] here and herbs
[52:51] there and then the next
[52:54] day I took this picture of my pastor
[52:58] this was the first message Church in
[53:00] Vietnam that's what it looks
[53:05] like and they worship with all the heart
[53:07] that which they
[53:13] understand you might think that there's
[53:14] not many messages in
[53:17] Spanish now imagine how many messages
[53:19] there must be in
[53:21] Vietnamese and with what they have they
[53:24] appreciate
[53:25] it
[53:28] so this the first time I had never
[53:29] fallen my lot to speak in English or
[53:31] preach English but I felt very
[53:33] comfortable I felt
[53:36] good later my our pastor took it
[53:39] over the children sing a
[53:42] special I wanted you to see what the
[53:44] children look
[53:47] like but even there is the new
[53:49] generation coming of
[53:51] Believers there's something about the
[53:54] children maybe I remember from when I
[53:56] was
[53:57] child and that touches my heart each
[54:00] time I see a
[54:01] child but this is
[54:04] afterwards with a tea that they
[54:06] have it's a bit bitter a bit
[54:10] strange well but brother what ises it
[54:12] taste like what it's
[54:14] delicious I don't know what they make it
[54:17] with but they drink it in such a nice
[54:23] way but the blood here that's their
[54:25] missionary
[54:28] those these two brothers with the
[54:29] ties brother they go to
[54:32] places where there's
[54:33] Buddhist that if you don't believe like
[54:35] they
[54:36] do or you disrespect them or get in
[54:38] their
[54:41] way they're so violent they almost have
[54:43] the right to kill
[54:45] you and that's where these men
[54:48] go so sharing with a brother Tron
[54:52] on of what is it that they have
[54:55] done with the they have with
[54:57] cents with a dollar in their
[55:00] pocket but with the burning in their
[55:05] heart that's so when I see this this is
[55:11] difficult if it were to me I would want
[55:13] to go back but just because of
[55:17] them even if they don't understand me
[55:19] even understand some of the
[55:23] words when interpret that covers
[55:25] everything we even end up
[55:29] owing this sister this is her
[55:34] home look I believe it it been about 10
[55:40] years about 11 years since they seen
[55:42] each other
[55:43] got she was so happy she opened up her
[55:46] bag and she took out a
[55:49] rag he said and you prayed for this
[55:52] cloth 10 years ago and I still have it
[55:55] she treasured it
[55:57] so my
[56:00] question all the cloth that our pastor's
[56:02] giving out do they still have
[56:03] them the ones that they prayed for do
[56:05] they still
[56:07] remember these people don't forget
[56:11] anything because they appreciate
[56:13] everything they can get their hands on
[56:15] and they treasure
[56:16] it here's the
[56:21] congregation they're happy with what God
[56:23] has given
[56:25] them
[56:27] because the seed from there we went to
[56:28] another place here it's called
[56:32] dang it's a very tourist
[56:36] City it's a very beautiful city that's
[56:39] what it looks
[56:41] like it's close to the
[56:44] ocean China
[56:46] Sea I believe it's called the China
[56:50] Sea and it's very
[56:54] beautiful even so it's still very
[56:59] difficult like I tell it feels like they
[57:00] want to beat you up at every
[57:02] corner but you're not going to get
[57:05] intimidated well you might say well I'm
[57:09] Mexican and by the grace of
[57:12] God God took care of
[57:14] us but we also have to have our
[57:19] guard like says we have to be aware of
[57:22] who is behind
[57:25] us privilege to here to get to know this
[57:28] bridge he spoke a little bit this
[57:31] morning for me it was a privilege to be
[57:33] there going where he
[57:37] fought everything is still the same as
[57:39] it was
[57:40] before the same boats that cross they're
[57:44] still
[57:46] there you're showing me the other side
[57:48] was where they were
[57:50] stationed and for me it was truly a
[57:52] privilege where a war was fought
[57:57] and the war still
[57:59] continues but now it continues in our
[58:02] mind it's a war that Satan continues to
[58:05] fight against
[58:06] us and hear this after 50
[58:09] years that's still standing
[58:13] there it's a bridge the soldiers had
[58:17] created and P said they were always
[58:19] constantly bombarding it or exploding it
[58:22] but it's still
[58:25] there
[58:26] before you get to the bridge there's a
[58:30] cafe and there's a man there who his
[58:32] grandpa was one who fought in the battle
[58:34] war and he has so much respect for our
[58:39] pastor that when you get there they want
[58:40] to give you the best they
[58:46] have because it's an honor to have him
[58:49] there and he does it out of the respect
[58:50] he has for the people who fought
[58:53] there and he gave us and he gifted us
[58:55] these little coffee things coffee
[59:00] pots so my our pastor gave him a
[59:04] coin and I gave it was in my heart to
[59:07] give him also a coin that I had out of
[59:14] respect this is the place we were I had
[59:16] the privilege to get to know this
[59:19] place is a it's a Runway where the
[59:22] planes would
[59:23] land everything's already changed
[59:27] this brother
[59:29] Peter brother Peter lives in the n and
[59:31] he's the representative of the voice of
[59:33] God this is his son he's the one who
[59:35] took us over
[59:37] there he has already began to
[59:45] grow that things started to grow there
[59:46] back then nothing would grow because of
[59:48] Agent Orange that was poured over
[59:51] there but the seed that was in the earth
[59:53] began to
[59:54] grow and the natural typifies the
[59:58] spiritual doesn't matter how much Satan
[1:00:00] tries to kill the children of
[1:00:03] God see would have to grow sooner or
[1:00:06] later here is in the room the
[1:00:09] hotel because you have to do it a high
[1:00:13] hidden and this is Pastor
[1:00:16] Han and his
[1:00:21] wife and so they go into the room to
[1:00:23] have Services there
[1:00:26] but there's always people
[1:00:29] watching it's always something
[1:00:31] tremendous to get to know other
[1:00:33] pastors you're are the people that
[1:00:40] came next to me there's a sister with a
[1:00:42] yellow shirt and one with a blue shirt
[1:00:44] they asked for
[1:00:46] prayer and from what I understood from
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:51] her since she was born she had a very
[1:00:54] difficult pain in her body
[1:00:58] but she went with
[1:01:00] faith knowing that God could heal
[1:01:05] her prayer you could feel how she was
[1:01:07] asking God with all of her
[1:01:09] heart and there instantly God healed
[1:01:12] her can you imagine with the pain that
[1:01:14] she was born with that had never gone
[1:01:17] away and a couple days later we asked
[1:01:19] where the sister was
[1:01:22] that she had gone out and testified what
[1:01:24] God had done in her life
[1:01:28] here are our more
[1:01:31] ministers this is our sister Fang
[1:01:35] V she's a translator of the messages to
[1:01:39] Vietnamese she's a very fine simple
[1:01:43] sister she's with she's with the agapo
[1:01:47] tablet and then invit us to eat more
[1:01:53] herbs I think about a certain amount of
[1:01:55] time you begin to get the
[1:01:58] taste the good thing is that they have
[1:02:01] chili and the chili is a little spicy
[1:02:03] it's
[1:02:04] so and so that helps
[1:02:07] me then we went to the Church of the
[1:02:10] pastor this is his little
[1:02:14] church that they have in their house
[1:02:16] outside of the city of
[1:02:21] dening and here this young man wasn't
[1:02:23] one
[1:02:24] interpreting he speaks very good
[1:02:27] English because the brothers that
[1:02:29] translate they understand
[1:02:31] English but sometimes they struggle to
[1:02:33] speak
[1:02:37] it sometimes you difficult need to
[1:02:39] adjust your ear to be able to understand
[1:02:42] them but this young man he's new and he
[1:02:44] speaks very good
[1:02:46] English and he's new in the
[1:02:49] message and God placed them in that
[1:02:52] place and that's what he is helping with
[1:02:57] there was even to interpret is the one
[1:02:59] that's there and brother Peter on the
[1:03:02] side because there certain words because
[1:03:04] the language is completely
[1:03:09] different because it's so different they
[1:03:11] need help in that certain words that are
[1:03:13] compound
[1:03:14] words and because everything is so
[1:03:19] different they have to interpret or
[1:03:21] translate the concept of what is being
[1:03:23] said here's our pastor praying for the
[1:03:25] the
[1:03:27] people the ones that have been with him
[1:03:29] in the missionary
[1:03:31] field you know that he gives everything
[1:03:33] in the missionary
[1:03:35] field he gives
[1:03:39] 110% because he wants the people to
[1:03:41] receive what God has for them but you
[1:03:44] know why sometimes we don't receive
[1:03:47] it because sometimes they read to us a
[1:03:51] quote like our Pastor said we're know it
[1:03:54] all
[1:03:57] I don't know if he said it that way so
[1:03:58] I'm going look at when I'm at home to
[1:03:59] see brother BR really said it that
[1:04:02] way but when you hear when he saying
[1:04:03] that it was so they accept
[1:04:06] it and they treasure it in their
[1:04:12] hearts to see if we can play the video
[1:04:14] just so you can see how they
[1:04:19] worship I'll give a couple seconds see
[1:04:21] if they're able to play
[1:04:24] it but when they
[1:04:28] [Music]
[1:04:48] worship they they worshiping they're
[1:04:50] they're singing Holy
[1:04:52] Holy because Chua for them is God
[1:05:04] but they give it out and they told you
[1:05:05] it's a place it's very difficult but
[1:05:06] because of the souls are crying
[1:05:08] out that's the reason our pastor
[1:05:11] goes so it doesn't matter how difficult
[1:05:13] it is doesn't matter what kind of food
[1:05:15] it
[1:05:17] is they want to know what kind of person
[1:05:19] you
[1:05:21] are if with restrictions they give
[1:05:23] everything they
[1:05:24] have risk all of their
[1:05:30] lives just to have of the
[1:05:33] gospel and we have it
[1:05:35] freely we can speak
[1:05:38] freely and they say brother you say that
[1:05:40] because you went over
[1:05:44] there I just want you to know so I can
[1:05:46] share what the world is
[1:05:48] suffering that's why brother says people
[1:05:50] are
[1:05:51] dying just for an ounce of
[1:05:54] Love or what you have have
[1:05:57] brothers and when you're
[1:06:00] praying remember our brothers in
[1:06:03] Vietnam so that God May strengthen
[1:06:06] them and the gospel begins to be spread
[1:06:09] out that the sea that is there it may
[1:06:12] rise
[1:06:14] up please stand may they come up may
[1:06:17] they give
[1:06:18] fruits and if God
[1:06:21] allows he give visas to some of the
[1:06:24] brothers
[1:06:26] so they come testify you can see them
[1:06:30] physically so you can see what it is
[1:06:32] that God is truly doing over
[1:06:34] there and that's the reason we're in the
[1:06:36] missionary
[1:06:37] field not because one is better than the
[1:06:41] rest maybe in your mind if you ever
[1:06:43] think that maybe it's a
[1:06:46] vacation then begin to speak to our
[1:06:52] wives see if it really is a vacation
[1:06:54] you'll find out that it's truly
[1:06:56] sacrifice but everything is well worth
[1:07:00] it if it was just for one single
[1:07:03] person because one soul is worth more
[1:07:05] than 10,000
[1:07:06] worlds so if just this
[1:07:09] trip everything that was invested all
[1:07:11] the time everything that was
[1:07:13] spent it was just for one
[1:07:17] person just for that person that was
[1:07:19] sick since they were
[1:07:20] born then it was well worth
[1:07:23] it so if it's the same God over there
[1:07:26] there it's the same God
[1:07:28] here you have any need on from
[1:07:32] God if you've been asking God for
[1:07:34] something for a long time and God has
[1:07:36] not given it to
[1:07:38] you God just wants to test your
[1:07:41] faith but God is the same God Jes Christ
[1:07:44] the same yesterday today and
[1:07:46] forever and everything he did for that
[1:07:48] young
[1:07:50] lady for you here
[1:07:53] tonight come with the correct attitude
[1:07:56] you come and say
[1:07:57] God here I am once
[1:08:00] again I'm ask I've asked you once and
[1:08:03] time but now
[1:08:04] Lord even if you don't give it to
[1:08:07] me because the devil is coming to my
[1:08:09] mind even if you don't give it to
[1:08:12] me I will still continue
[1:08:14] believing that has to be our
[1:08:18] attitude to grab on to what we believe
[1:08:21] in the word belongs to
[1:08:23] us we're the best
[1:08:28] but we just have to know who we are
[1:08:30] we're not just
[1:08:31] anybody they're Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:33] God purch by the blood of Lord Jesus
[1:08:36] Christ all the promises Belong To
[1:08:39] You Lord Jes Christ Holy Father we give
[1:08:42] you thanks
[1:08:44] Lord because we don't know what we have
[1:08:47] here we have the best
[1:08:50] Lord there's people that are dying
[1:08:53] Forgive Me Lord they're
[1:08:56] dying because they want to have what we
[1:08:58] have
[1:08:59] here and what they have they treasure
[1:09:03] it we have so much
[1:09:07] Lord that we waste so much
