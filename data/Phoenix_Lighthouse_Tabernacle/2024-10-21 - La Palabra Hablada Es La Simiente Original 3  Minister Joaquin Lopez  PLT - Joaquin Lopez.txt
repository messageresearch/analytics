TRANSCRIPT
========================================
18 now he is the head of the church the body who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in that in all things he might have the primin he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants Su Prem listen now listen close while we're going what he is to be the head of the body his bride's body which is taken from him flesh and Bone like an Adam see Bride born from the dead see that's born from the dead sin of unbelief what killed Eve unbelief is that right the unbelief and what but but the UN the unbelief in God no she had faith in God sure did she say there is no God no sir she was an Infidel well she said you know I don't believe his word at all oh no she believed all but one little thing he now didn't the Bible say over the Book of Revelation Jesus said himself I I jesus sent my angel to testify these things un you whoo ever shall take one word from it or add one word to it and if all this heartache and sorrow had to come because a woman doubted one word of God will he let you back doub in one word he'd be unjust see that wouldn't be right condemn here's one man standing he calls all his heartache because of one word doubt it then he goes ahead and takes years of experience and everything Bible and so forth and others who give their life for and say oh you can go ahead and eat that's all right I'll let you back anyhow God is no respect of person but God is no respector person I know notice now he is the head of the body that's born from the sin of unbelief in God's word that is that excuses every denomination every Creed unbelief in the word which is himself The Word of Life see the word only has life any other word is a high hbd no matter how much it looks like it it isn't the word the word produces its own life that Eve swap for personal knowledge see how the church has today through some man's understanding Moses had a great understanding of God till he met the burning bush then he saw his failure the burning bush had what Moses lacked amen the words got what the denomination likes he the head is the first fruit of the Resurrection we go off this Revelation just a little while longer if you say so just a little bit now he is the first fruits of the Resurrection is that right what then what is he he's the head of the body which is his church bride then the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery amen it's impossible for it not to go it's part of God's mystery how God revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals the church and raises it up by the same word it's a part of his threefold mystery as the head was tucked from the grave so must the body follow him back to Eden where the head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the bride because that's the head and the head's revealed and come back with eternal life and the body must follow that because it is husband and wife again amen as long as you're pregnated with the same word which is his body you've took his body becoming him when you took the word not the Creed the word oh my wouldn't I make a text for this afternoon to go on my wouldn't that be wonderful see just think of it now what it is therefore the body cannot recognize don't you fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship but the word because of the head is connected with the body and the head is the word and it's the same word one headship therefore denominations and holy fathers and everything else is dead done there's one headship that's Christ the body only recognizes one thing the word I show me where somebody was baptized in the body in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and watch you recognize yeah I realize I'm talking to thousands on tape you know we got tape Ministry around the world what name are you baptized in for there's not another name given under heaven said the word whereby man can be saved if you're baptized to show your belief in Christ and then take on a Creed name then you're hybrid if you're not exactly like that church is exactly like they're teaching then you Catholic people how can you go under the jurisdiction of a pope now saying that he is a successor by Apostolic succession from from Peter and this Pope in this church teaching so contrary to this first word which God recognized by signs and wonders to be his church and to see that same word being brought forth today in its Purity showing the same resurrection that he had there God living among these people doing the same things then you can recognize a headship in Rome or headship is in heaven I'm not going to Rome I'm going to heaven when I die the headship is in heaven and the body must follow the head as the wife follows the husband being that Adam was not deceived he walked out with Eve Eve was deceived she was in the transgression or the entire resurrection of the whole body would have come forth at the day of the Lord Jesus when he come forth from the grave but he had to redeem her which is his body she has to be redeemed in order to come to him you you see it oh see it couldn't have happened then the Redemption is going on I see the seals when he's in his mediatorial work back here redeeming but someday he comes forth to get this book that he's redeemed and all that's in this book would be him or that's a Believer the words in the book and the word is him and all it's in that he come forth for this book of redemption whose names are written on the book before the foundation of the world when he was slaying as a lamb and here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there she can't recognize another headship no there's no Bishop no nothing she recognizes one headship that's Christ and Christ is the word oh my I love that that's right as the head was tuck up from the grave so must his body follow him into Eden therefore the body cannot recognize any other headship but the headship of the word no denomination can put anything to it for whosoever shall take one word away from it or add one word to it it took away from it they're dead hrid right there she's back this testimony in her hands the filthiness of her fornications committing a spiritual adultery against the very word that she claims to believe therefore it's word or nothing that's right he the word how do you know it's right he the word is Vindicated see he the word properly Vindicated is the headship the head of the church he is the word the headship he's properly identific identified Vindicated by his own spirit being in the church itself the person showing forth himself in Vindication is a direct proof to the entire body you don't need Creeds Z denominations has perished but the headship itself recognized in the body by personal identifications see identifying himself proves a headship to the body then we are united under one Vindicated headship that is Christ the word of God not under any church then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination We Belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word in God was one and the word in God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead in the resurrection to go back and restore again his at in the beginning the threefold mystery of God his body oh my notice closely now like en types Israel of old am I taking too much time don't let me go we ain't got about 20 more pages amen but just a little bit now and then then I'll leave you all go till next summer sometime it's the Lord willing see now look notice now United together under one headship in a like manner type of Israel of old now you getting it like Israel of old one God of Vindicated by a pillar of fire and revealed himself through a prophet to be the word the same God same Pillar of Fire same way he cannot change his way is that as perfect as it can be is it one God how many gods did Israel have how many is a bride God one how many will there ever be sure sure under the leadership of the Holy Spirit which was the pillar of fire in the days of Moses the great prophet he was directed by a pillar of fire is that right all right going to a promised land and in the Christian age there was one God which appeared in the form of a pillar of Fire to a prophet called Paul who was sent to the Gentiles to take a people out for his name's sake Hallelujah is that right and in the last days has come down in like manner of vindicating himself see in the same sign same Wonder same Pillar of Fire same gospel same word same manifestation his body will do the works that he promised like in Mark 16 and so forth his body was not held in the grave but was recognized with him in the resurrection do you get it then the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes but will be recognized with him because he died for the purpose to resurrect his bride the body recognize because it is his body because it's a word it's so completely yielded from denomination things to him and he is the word see and it's recognized with him because now we have the first fruit of our Resurrection but know that we pass from death into life become prisoners with his and God proving to us by his personal headship that he is the same yesterday and forever doing the same things through the church that he did then he and me and I and him and you you know so forth that's right his body was not held in the grave recognized with him in the resurrection same as he is now listen which means this his word which he is has been begin to be risen the word that down to the age of Luther Wesley has begin to raise up to its power they begin to move they moved a little more now it's coming up to identification see watch now to the life in the body is a Vindication of the Rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship nations are breaking Israel's Awakening see what I mean he has beg to give life into his body why the one that he has redeemed immedi work is done he's bringing his life to body in a Vindication for the Rapture remember now in the last day uh if you just bury me on this just a little bit it'll be all right I don't want you to miss it and I got to I got to take this paint now I've been to start this far one more great remark I want to make if I have to move over a little of it now notice listen to this now is the great thing now is where we want to watch remember in the last days will ad ex L go back and vindicate the first day see Adam and Eve husband and wife no sin life then the fall notice notice closely up notice what caused it Lucifer Lucifer is doing now as he did at the first time just as the the kingdom of the Gentiles was brought in with King Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile Race by a prophet who could interpret unknown tongues Visions dreams and it's come down through the Gentiles without anything it's me of persans ir and so forth and then the feed it goes out the same way again the Gentile Kingdom notice Lucifer in the last days is doing as he did at first what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom of Greater Splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had you got it now now if you miss it just hold up your hand I'll say it again you see see Lucifer at the beginning his purpose and heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured more beautiful more Splendor than the kingdom of Christ do you think we'll have automobiles in the Millennium and airplanes see what Lucifer's doing now the big fancy intellectual denominations are doing the very same thing Gathering themselves together to do the same thing see they are gathering and denominating himself themselves each one trying to beat the other and now they got so much Splendor they don't know what to do but to unite it with the Catholic Church Lucifer again building a bigger Kingdom to push out people that don't believe in denominations and even take their Church buildings and make store rooms and the pastors of such has no rights at all and a man that is a godsent man would never stand in denomination if you're hearing this or seeing he got enough to go out and look at it certainly see I don't say it critically I say it truthfully to see that reveal notice in this last days Lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building a a hybrid Church a hybrid by hybrid members hbr by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual man instead of born again man building an intellectual Kingdom that'll outshine Christ's little bitty flock see what is it that did that Fallen Angels the Bible say was Fallen Angels who listen to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept not their first estate like the Angels did and it's fell into organizations like Lucifer's main ho at NAA and what have they done organized a great ecumenical Association of ministers to make an image into the Beast as the Bible said and building a Christian economy that will close the doors of this church and others like see Lucifer at's work I'm tring to bring you the three-fold Revelation or mystery of God what did they do sold out to reasonings of wisdom and education like Eve did Fallen Angels did Wesley was a man of God but what followed him for Angels got into it what was the Angels first created beings of God but fell for Lucifer's wisdom fell for Lucifer Lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from man of God who went forth to establish truth in the earth before that truth could go on and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come in and took it over and made denominations out of it that's the reason the revelation of the seven seal mystery had to be unfolded amen amise God now you see it yes amen what they left off if Luther would have went on it have been here if Wesley would have went on if Pentecost would have what would they done now there's only one thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when there is nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there can be no denomination and no nothing else follow it you're either in it or you're not in it the fruit is in the top of the tree and the light is shining on that predestinated fruit and she's rening into Christ like fruit bringing forth the same melness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him hope you see it Hallelujah see I try to put too much in one Daye a we you out look they sold out to reasonings sold out to reasonings of denomination if I can just belong to this the the mayor goes to this church if I can be a Methodist or a presbyterian just look where they've gone I've just explained them limbs are pruned off they're dead they're not connected with Christ anymore they' be bringing the same life they're not connected with it but there's they're like a citrus fruit any citrus fruit will live on a citrus tree but it'll bring its own fruit you put a grapefruit in a in a orange tree it'll live by the orange tree but it bring forth grapefruit you put a lemon in there it's a citrus fruit it'll bring forth an or sour lemon but it's living all the life and that's what denominations are doing by under the name of the church it's the bride that's the original tree the original Spirit the Revelation comes from Christ not the denomination Christ notice what the denomination trying to exalt itself like Lucifer they so call themselves The Church the bride which they are Revelation 17 as it spoke of the false bride above Christ's Little Flock the bride Lucifer thanks and exalts himself above the humble word of of God's truth by the knowledge of the Revelation and has placed himself by Seminary education and theology until they have got themselves up and if you don't belong in their group then you are a outlash like Lucifer did in the beginning saying to the people just exactly what Lucifer said to Eve surely God will receive us we feed the poor that's good surely you will receive us we are a great denomination we are a beautiful Church well look at our great buildings look at our great membership we stand in the millions surely God will not turn that group down the same thing that Cain did brought in the pretty fruits from the ground that he had Ked and toiled and worked and brought in the fruits and rejected the humble blood of the Lamb God have mercy that man women will not think I'm saying this to exalt something or some personal revelation or something I'm only telling you the truth and you see what they're doing yes amen I speak it loud and harsh but you got to drive an a to the clenches if it's going to do any good till you'll see it now saying to the people surely you mean to tell me that our great Catholic churches stood all this time our great Methodist and look at our forefathers but they broke the word of the Lord and Eve was God's one of his he she was a byproduct of Adam and because she doubted one word of God's word it did it and here's Lucifer at his job again today and remember the Antichrist is not communism the Antichrist is so close like the real thing till it deceive the very elected if it was possible Jesus said Matthew 24 the elected if it was possible Lucifer again Lucifer again is breaking God's unity in Man by his is limiting the word of God to his reasonings what he thinks is right and what he thinks he breaks the word of God and the same thing he did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said you by your Traditions has made the word of God of no effect and the denominations by their organized uh intellectual reasonings has made God's word of no effect upon the people right they just can't see it then they say where is the god of the Bible he's right here he's the Bible that's what he is notice now Lucifer comes into kindness and breaks the unity of God to man just like he did in Eden by great Temptations of promises of self-power and exaltations well you might become a bishop if you just stay with us you might become a district president why would you go to something like that see that's Pentecostal the Catholic and so forth see a great false promise to man to receive power outside the word and promise of God you receive power when the Holy Ghost has come up you not when you become a bishop or a deacon or whatever are amen see but Lucifer and they set in the little buildings anywhere they could on Hard Rock floor you know that if you talk to NAA Council in the pr I see of counsel and I see of fathers and so forth in the history of the church they had nothing but when they had this Council and inducted some of the Roman paganism into Christianity and put holy man and Bishops and so forth and popes and all this kind of nonsense what did Constantine give them I asked any Theologian to tell me he gave them property he gave them freedom and all that they wanted and they swapped the word of God for the w wisdom and culture of man and that's the same thing Lucifer did then he did in the Garden of Eden and they died right there the Pentecostal Church died at n Rome but to be resurrected in the brid tree in the last days notice Lucifer comes in conon like he did Dan and by Temptations and false promises of power out apart from the word of God he did the same at I see of Rome he's doing the same today at the World Council of ecumenical churches that's all unite together the Pope says I want all my economical Brethren out there to unite with me we are one that's right in organizations you are one but that has nothing to do with the bride of Christ not a thing brother you'll never wash her in anything like that now it is Promised in the last days that the original faith in the seemed to be restored to the children of God at the time of the brid tream Malachi 4 God said before the world burns up with fire behold I S to you Elijah the prophet and he will restore the faith of the children now that wasn't the first Elijah to come no no now we don't teach your Elijah's Manel and Elijah's blankets and all those things like that we just teach the word of God that's what he said see we got all kind of Elijah this and Elijah that which is nonsense that's we know that that's I'm not talking about that and you spiritual minded understand see is the late hours getting late and can't put it all on this paper of course now promis in the last days now if the Jesus said and and Matthew I believe the 11th chapter the sixth chapter and 11 no it's 11th chapter and about the sixth verse when John sent his disciples over there to see if he really was the one Jesus said who did you go out to see a a a wind a reed that's shaken by the winds did you go out to see such and such he said or did you go to see a prophet he said more than a prophet John was more than a prophet he was the messenger of the Covenant and he said if you can receive it this is he which is spoke up of the prophets I'll send my messenger before my faith now that's Malachi three not Malachi 4 because the Elisha that was to come in Malachi 4 their Earth was to be burnt with a fervent Heat and the righteous was to walk out in the Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked so it is not that one see now we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship going in coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning and making ready and fulfilling his word as he did at first in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself to his promised word for the last days he promised this in the last days now if you're spiritual you catch it then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand now if I never see you again remember the married supper is at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great Millennium the taking up of the church to the destroying of the wicked and the world under the Sixth Seal to be purified by volcanic to take all the corruption and sin of the world and to molder out again and bring forth a bright New Millennium for the age that is to come when we see all these great treeful revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to God now by the revelation of the three-fold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindicated

likewise with the brothers that are with him the word of God reads in the beginning God created the earth and the Heaven and the Earth was without form and void and the Darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and he called The Darkness uh night and the evening and the morning were the first day let's go to verse 11 Brothers God said let the Earth bring forth grass and Herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so let's part our head so we can pray Brothers beloved and good Heavenly Father once again here we are Lord I always like to give you than for life and health Lord for the great blessings we've received because we know you're a good God lord full of grace and mercy and here we

everything Lord and we place ourselves in thy precious hands we ask it all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated Brothers I was telling you it's an honor for me to stand before you I want to greet all my brothers through the internet all our brothers that are watching us we going to watch us the day of tomorrow may the Lord bless you and give you a double blessing I have a small thought Brothers I know it's nothing new IID like to speak a little bit of the seed but the Seed of Abraham you know who the seat of Abraham is right and I want to let you know that in Hebrew the seed is is called zerah it refers to like uh Earth uh like the seed of plants like you read in Genesis uh 1:1 where it says to for the earth to bring forth grass herbs yielding seed and the fruit tree of all of it after its kind the Covenant God made with Abraham in the Book of Genesis chapter 12 verses 1 two and three note it down I'm just going to read it quickly so I could take advantage of time now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House onto a land that I will show thee and I will make thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed physical SE literally Brothers the seed is is like a seed that's planted in the ground as you know produces a new plant like we just read it's it's found in Genesis 111 where God orders for the earth to bring forth herb Ying seed you can also see it as a descendant like the seed can be you can say like my descendants like you could say I'm the father of Antonio okay you could say the father of my grandp my grandfather there's a descendant there it's also a seed as you can read in 21 Genesis 21:12 where it says that Isaac is the Seed of Abraham and you can say that's also an inheritance in a broader sense the seed is also referred to uh spiritual inheritance promises and values that go from generation to generation I was explaining to Antonio a little bit ago that his daughter was just born she's my descendant descendants of my grandpa father of my dad and it just continues the descendence continues and it can also be used in a kingdom as well it says in the context of the oldest Testament the seed can be referred to the kingdom of God like Israel's Nation The Chosen seed of God in the message the angel of the Lord preached on April 14 1951 I'm going to read this quote real quick Jesus said a s went forth and sold some seeds and an an enemy came behind him and saw some tears and the husband the husband man said shall I go and pull up the terce and said if you do you will pull up the wheat let them grow together and on that day I will send the angels and they will gather all the tears and burn them and the weed will be taken to the gardener uh as I was saying last time I got chance to speak I was saying where the seed went to uh Stone Stony lands and where it was Thorns no no dirt or very little dirt this is where it continues this what we're talking about again in this message Brothers uh brother B starts talking about Hebrews chapter 6 ver4 says that it is impossible for those who were once enlightened made partakers of the Heavenly gift partakers of the Holy Spirit and a Heavenly calling and likewise tasted of the good word of God and world powers of the world to come verse six say if shall fall away to renew themselves again to repentance seeing that they crucify themselves AR fresh the son of God and the count of the blood with with with they were Sanctified as an Unholy thing for the rain cometh off upon the Earth to dress It prepares it but the thistles and Thorns are to be burned and it says notice in this same wheat field that was sld there is barriers creepers stink weed there's everything all growing together with the wheat and when there's a drought is on the creeper is just as thirsty for water as the wheat is the water is sent for the wheat but the creepers just as glad to get the water as the wheat is and by and that's why it says and by our fruits you shall know them in the meeting of the Holy Ghost Falls over the building but those who live Godly in in Christ Jesus are the people that be taken to the Garner and the TS not for us to judge but it will be burned at the end you see what I mean brother Brandon is saying like I was telling you Brothers the seed has a logical meaning important in the Bible it relates with the idea of continuity the promise that God won't abandon his people and his Plan of Salvation will take place through the generations this P Covenant is is fundamental it's fundamental for Biblical history God promises Abraham is's going to have a large descendant he'll be a great nation and he'll be a great blessing for every family in the Earth the Seed of Abraham becomes a symbol of Hope For Humanity it's a promise that God has as a Plan of Salvation then we change to the seat of God in the New Testament brother Brandon was speaking on the Old Testament there but in the New Testament the seed of God takes even a deeper meaning Jesus presents as the Seed of Abraham the promised Messiah you can find it in Matthew 1:1 and and it says that Jesus is son of David Son of Abraham and this lineage connects Jesus with the Covenant that God made with Abraham showing that he is the Fulfillment of the [Music] promise also the seed of God relates with the New Creation in Christ Galatians verse three uh chapter 3:1 16 says that the promises of God were given to Abraham and also his seed which is Christ this seed doesn't only refer to Jesus but also everyone that believes in him that we are Heirs of God's covenant we have have the Apostle Paul using the metaphor of the seed to describe the Christian Life First Corinthians 3 ver 6 Paul Compares all the Christians to Farmers who plant the seed of the word of God as I'm reading this comes to my mind some say they were from Apollo some from Paul but we are all Christians we're we're all of Christ nobody's from other people we're just from Christ because God is the one that gives the understanding and also the growth the growth of the seed depends on the work of the Holy Spirit who gives the life to the word of God in the hearts of the Believers and also the seed of God is also a promise of Salvation the SE of God is a promise of hope and salvation complete salvation that's the promise that God has not abandoned his people that his plan for Humanity is is it will be carried out and that the eternal life is available whoever whoever believe in the Lord Jesus Christ that's a promise that's a beautiful promise for everyone that's here in Jesus Christ because he's the only one Brothers that died for me and you there's no one else who can we worship more who should we worship more we should only be worshiping the Lord Jesus Christ there's no one else the seed of God is a symbol of God's faithfulness love for Humanity and it's desired to restore the relationship that was broken by sin this is beautiful Brothers sometimes we see things so simply so simple I I say because I had a job in a company once it's hard for me to work with people that not in the message because everyone knows that I'm a Christian there and sometimes I rebuke them sometimes they see they say bad things or and sometimes I say my to my coworker you don't have to say like that you don't have to change that word for another one oh here comes the brother again that's how it should be I tell him when I'm not here when I'm not here you can do whatever you want but when I'm here just respect me a little bit I'm the the Elder one here and you can say now what does the seat of God mean in the Bible the seed of God uh in the Bible represents the descendance of of Abraham the Messiah the promised Messiah the kingdom of God in the spiritual inheritance that's pass down through generations symbol of Hope continuity and the promise of divine salvation who is the Seed of Abraham who is it very few raising hands ra don't be ashamed we're all SE of Abraham in the Old Testament the Seed of Abraham referred to his physical the or the nation of Israel but in the New Testament the Seed of Abraham identifies with Jesus the promised Messiah because it just has to sink into US Brothers It's like a machine where you put in the coins and you get a soda if you don't put in the coin you're not going to get soda you first have to put in the coins and then push the button and get the soda that's how we have to be brothers we have it has to sink into us so you can understand to get the Revelation Brothers am amen amen Brothers what is the New Creation in Christ the New Creation in Christ refers to a spiritual transformation experiences a a person experiences when they believe in Jesus they become a new creature created in the image of God the new life and the new Destiny Brothers the question is how can I be part of God's seed you can be part of God's seed you have to believe in Jesus Brothers how how's your savior you he died for you he suffered our pains and by accepting Jesus as your lord and savior you become a member of God's family and you are an he of the Covenant God made with Abraham Brothers the seed of God is a complex meaningful biblical concept for Humanity and eternal life is going to be for everyone that believes in Him brother as you understand the meaning of the God's seed God's seed in the Bible Bible then we can have a deeper understanding of the Plan of Salvation Brothers of the God's promise for Humanity and our place in his plan because in our minds we have to be brothers we have to be in the Plan of Salvation we have to be sure that we have to be there because if you're not sure Brothers start praying for God to give you Revelation for you salvation's for you because if that's not the case you can't do nothing else Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ died for you and me he's the only one worthy of our Praises our worship all honor everything everything you need Brothers it's right there it's a big table and there's a everything there if you want to go and dine with the Lord WS of the Lambs we have to be firm be straight in the path of the Lord continue praying for one another brothers that are sick our brothers in the missionary field everyone Brothers every any the only thing I can tell you brothers that we need a lot of God I need them day after day minute by minute second by second every breath I take brothers without him there's no hope we have to have that greatness KN that we have we're children of God the Assurance we have to be sure of what we're doing
