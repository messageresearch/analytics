[4:05] Bishops pastors who deny the power

[4:27] life you don't like that
[4:32] no and
[4:37] you know you Fe on

[4:59] everything you never seen life in your
[5:05] life never seen all your
[5:10] life you know what he's
[5:13] doing going along out there smoking a
[5:16] big
[5:17] cigar right
[5:24] back he's got his wife with him she's
[5:26] wearing
[5:27] shorts just like the Philistines are
[5:29] doing out
[5:30] there
[5:38] yeah that's kind of message the Holy
[5:40] Spirit has taken by church
[5:48] today now what do you think about
[5:51] that that's
[5:54] adoption what he did he
[5:56] do he predestined us us onto
[6:03] adoption he give us the Holy Ghost but
[6:06] wait a minute adoption that's what we're
[6:08] talking about
[6:17] ad well you know what he
[6:20] does the bishop come by the other day
[6:22] and he was having little healing service
[6:24] down there the bishop come
[6:28] by
[6:31] some guy brother come by with praying
[6:33] for the sick he said you stop
[6:45] that don't
[6:52] cooperate and here I come and tell him
[6:55] the truth right out of your word here it
[6:58] is
[7:01] I'll read your laws to him exactly what
[7:03] to do and he won't listen
[7:07] to he said all that was for another age
[7:11] another son some other time that don't
[7:12] mean
[7:20] me
[7:23] are that's
[7:28] truth to see where the church misses his
[7:34] places while we haven't got revivals
[7:37] while we haven't got things going
[7:41] on that's
[7:44] where Joshua say uh dad I want you to WR
[7:51] in here L your place according to the
[7:54] blue your
[7:58] place
[8:03] get
[8:07] herein you go right down
[8:10] here and now you all stay away the
[8:17] bosu comes back all
[8:28] over women painted up and dancing around
[8:31] having a big
[8:35] time and josua scratches
[8:44] his that's just exactly what's taking
[8:49] place not all thank God not all but too
[8:58] many
[8:59] all right now what takes place
[9:03] then that's what
[9:06] happen don't you imagine that man the
[9:08] Holy Spirit blushes before the father
[9:10] when he has to say
[9:11] that oh
[9:21] my I told him he wouldn't listen to
[9:27] it I told him met and let him read right
[9:30] there in the
[9:33] book I had I had a little minister to
[9:35] come by and show him that Jesus Christ
[9:37] is the same yesterday and
[9:44] forever you know what he let one of them
[9:47] let one of them old gold herders come
[9:49] over here and tell him that that was for
[9:53] another

[10:29] enough metal spinn on
[10:36] him or I if you'd write his name in the
[10:38] paper take his bit would take a half a
[10:41] sheet to make his
[10:52] time they sure like him over there in
[10:54] that country but I tell you he sure
[10:55] don't know how to feed
[10:58] sheep

[23:48] unto
[23:50] adoption
[23:56] unto
[23:59] they're born a child but when they son
[24:02] right
[24:06] there but then there'll never be no more
[24:08] than just a child just an ordinary son
[24:11] until they mature and show up they
[24:21] are he call him out

[1:08:33] hearts where the Holy Spirit Will sew

[1:08:45] hundredfold we ask in Jesus name
[1:08:49] amen isn't that
[1:08:51] beautiful circumcise Lord
[1:08:54] our lips
[1:08:55] today that's what we
[1:08:58] need now as you're standing let's read
[1:09:01] the scripture we're going to be reading
[1:09:04] we're going to turn to Genesis
[1:09:06] 1
[1:09:12] 1-5 in the beginning God created the
[1:09:15] Heaven and the
[1:09:18] Earth and the Earth was was without form
[1:09:22] and void and Darkness was upon the face
[1:09:25] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:09:28] upon the face of the
[1:09:37] waters and God said let there be light
[1:09:40] and there was
[1:09:44] light and God saw the light that it was
[1:09:47] good and God divided the light from the
[1:09:52] darkness and God called the light day
[1:09:56] and the Darkness he called night and the
[1:09:59] evening and the morning were the first
[1:10:07] day take your
[1:10:09] seats God bless his word and God bless
[1:10:14] our hearts this
[1:10:17] morning you know every
[1:10:19] year what we normally do is I'll tell
[1:10:22] you what God has showed me how God talks
[1:10:26] with me and from me to you we've had
[1:10:30] seven years of
[1:10:33] plenty and all since the
[1:10:38] covid-19 since that time
[1:10:42] period we have we've
[1:10:47] struggled people have
[1:10:49] struggled what we call
[1:10:52] it that in the land that we live
[1:10:56] today there's such a struggle that we
[1:11:00] don't know what the government is doing
[1:11:03] anymore they only tell us what they want
[1:11:06] to tell
[1:11:08] us can you say Amen to
[1:11:10] that so we're
[1:11:16] confused and I woke up one
[1:11:18] day with the same thought what about
[1:11:22] 2024
[1:11:24] what's going to happen in
[1:11:27] 2024 if I was to ask you what will you
[1:11:31] be doing in
[1:11:34] 2024 throughout the year I will tell you
[1:11:38] what I'm going to be doing I can't stop
[1:11:40] planting the
[1:11:41] potatoes we need to
[1:11:44] continue We Can't Stop I can't give a
[1:11:48] moment to Satan because if I give him a
[1:11:52] second he's going to take the whole year
[1:11:54] from
[1:11:57] me let me say it this way be careful how
[1:12:01] you spend your money this
[1:12:08] year don't
[1:12:10] overspend in other words don't go out
[1:12:13] and buy a brand new
[1:12:15] car when you have a
[1:12:17] car don't go out and buy a new house
[1:12:21] when you have a house go out and buy
[1:12:25] property because the value of
[1:12:27] property this coming year is going to go
[1:12:31] down our homes aren't going to have the
[1:12:33] same value that they had
[1:12:38] 2023 the interest rates are not going to
[1:12:41] go
[1:12:42] down they're going to
[1:12:44] climb we're going to lose our
[1:12:48] jobs price of
[1:12:50] food it's going up yes or no
[1:12:54] yes or
[1:12:57] no gas prices are coming
[1:13:00] down but our
[1:13:02] economy is not
[1:13:05] stable if we see our economy
[1:13:08] today it's the dollar is not
[1:13:12] worth a
[1:13:14] dollar it's more like 30
[1:13:17] cents and I'm going to tell you from me
[1:13:20] to you be extremely careful
[1:13:24] before you sign your life away on
[1:13:27] something you don't need in
[1:13:37] 2024 if you don't know the person that's
[1:13:41] winning the
[1:13:42] election or that will win the election
[1:13:45] will promise
[1:13:48] you less taxes tax but they never
[1:13:52] completed
[1:13:55] a better
[1:13:56] future but it's never
[1:13:59] there Jesus Christ offers us eternal
[1:14:04] life and patiently we will
[1:14:08] wait until we
[1:14:11] receive what we or what is our
[1:14:15] inheritance can you say Amen how many of
[1:14:17] us have an
[1:14:20] inheritance I hope we have an in
[1:14:25] inance I hope that we
[1:14:28] understand this message because the more
[1:14:32] I
[1:14:33] see let me go here this is my first
[1:14:38] quote
[1:14:41] um go to
[1:14:44] slide thank
[1:14:46] you brother Brenham says it
[1:14:49] clearly because I need for you to
[1:14:52] understand one thing
[1:14:54] I don't worry about you I don't worry
[1:14:57] about myself I don't worry about the
[1:15:00] ministry I worry about the young
[1:15:05] people I worry about those individuals
[1:15:09] that want to give their life to Christ
[1:15:12] but they see
[1:15:13] us instead of seeing the reflection of
[1:15:17] Jesus Christ we're not seeing the
[1:15:20] reflection of Jesus Christ we have a in
[1:15:23] we have a foot out and we haven't
[1:15:30] decided what about the
[1:15:33] future of our
[1:15:36] youth this what brother Brenham said so
[1:15:38] you understand apply it to our life
[1:15:43] apply it to your
[1:15:46] family and if you got something in your
[1:15:49] heart for God how many of you have
[1:15:53] something in your heart
[1:15:57] God and you won't
[1:16:01] Express and so forth and just keep
[1:16:04] putting it
[1:16:05] off how many of how many of us fall into
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:11] category don't raise your hand but do me
[1:16:14] a favor think about the person sitting
[1:16:18] right next to
[1:16:19] you or the person that should be here in
[1:16:28] well later
[1:16:29] on later on a little desire that you
[1:16:33] once
[1:16:35] had to serve God will be given to you
[1:16:39] 100
[1:16:41] fold is that what it says is that what
[1:16:44] brother brandham
[1:16:46] said no no the little desire you once
[1:16:52] had to serve God will be taken away from
[1:17:03] you I want you to think about that that
[1:17:07] desire that you're son your daughter
[1:17:10] your grandson your granddaughter I
[1:17:12] include myself that desire they once
[1:17:16] had being taught in a Sunday school and
[1:17:20] all of a sudden want to serve
[1:17:24] God they want to serve God but all of a
[1:17:27] sudden something
[1:17:30] happens they find out that the world has
[1:17:33] something to
[1:17:37] offer and that
[1:17:39] desire to serve God is fading
[1:17:46] away that's why I have the young people
[1:17:49] preach that's why I have them leading
[1:17:52] song surface
[1:17:54] that's why we go out on
[1:17:56] outings why cuz I'm looking at
[1:18:00] tomorrow's
[1:18:03] youth now you that have
[1:18:07] kids that are obedient you don't know
[1:18:10] what happens when they leave your area
[1:18:13] your
[1:18:14] environment when they go to school when
[1:18:17] they go here when they go there you're
[1:18:19] not
[1:18:21] there
[1:18:25] you don't
[1:18:25] know what they're thinking you may think
[1:18:29] we
[1:18:35] know the devil the Devil is a
[1:18:40] Tormentor that's what a devil
[1:18:43] is he's a
[1:18:46] Tormentor and he comes to our mind and
[1:18:49] we become a
[1:18:51] mindset
[1:18:56] our mind is set our attitude is
[1:19:03] set I don't know if you thought I was
[1:19:05] going to speak like this for a new year
[1:19:09] maybe you thought I was going to Sugar
[1:19:11] Code something I
[1:19:15] cannot time is running
[1:19:21] out
[1:19:26] the devil will come in and steal that
[1:19:37] desire remember he's a
[1:19:40] spirit and you receive the
[1:19:42] anointing we all receive an
[1:19:47] anointing are you awake
[1:19:51] now this is how brother Brenham
[1:19:55] was you know I continue
[1:19:59] looking and brother Brenham said on the
[1:20:02] next quote I want to read these two
[1:20:04] quotes because then I have questions I
[1:20:07] have four questions for
[1:20:10] you he goes on and faith is a substance
[1:20:14] I know we've all read the
[1:20:17] message but it says this this is excuse
[1:20:21] me this that we're living
[1:20:25] in it's such a day of unsettled
[1:20:33] peace what's happening in Israel is
[1:20:36] there
[1:20:39] peace what's happening in
[1:20:43] Mexico I hear they're going to elect a
[1:20:45] woman
[1:20:46] president is that what's happening right
[1:20:51] now I'm
[1:20:53] unsettled
[1:20:57] Peace So I ask you how many of us
[1:21:01] today have an unsettled
[1:21:09] mind none of us I'm the first one to put
[1:21:13] my hand
[1:21:15] up and then brother Brenham goes out
[1:21:18] goes on and he
[1:21:19] says and unsettled rest
[1:21:27] everywhere now remember this is
[1:21:31] 1947 who was born in
[1:21:34] 1947 stand up if you were born in
[1:21:41] 1947 is that what's happening
[1:21:45] today again how long ago was
[1:21:50] that 77 7 8 years whatever it
[1:21:55] is we weren't
[1:22:01] born and here's the
[1:22:04] prophet telling us unsettled
[1:22:10] peace unsettled
[1:22:13] rest what is going on with Mr
[1:22:17] Trump wants to kill everyone that is
[1:22:21] against him
[1:22:25] tells
[1:22:26] people my message to
[1:22:30] you and he
[1:22:32] says rot in
[1:22:42] hell and his
[1:22:45] counterpart is
[1:22:48] saying love
[1:22:51] those that talk about
[1:22:57] you bless him forgive
[1:23:07] them people are running to and fro
[1:23:12] speaking whatever they may
[1:23:21] speak
[1:23:24] in other words we go from house to house
[1:23:28] I don't know if you do
[1:23:31] it did you hear what he
[1:23:35] said it makes no
[1:23:39] sense what do you think I think he's
[1:23:43] lost
[1:23:45] it buddy or excuse me
[1:23:48] brother I lost it a long time ago
[1:23:55] you're just seeing Ernie
[1:24:00] Montoya but I lost it a long time
[1:24:03] ago I lost my
[1:24:06] thoughts I lost everything gave
[1:24:09] everything to the person that owes
[1:24:13] me the the person that owns me is the
[1:24:17] Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:24:20] forfeited everything

[1:24:25] that we're in trouble we need to
[1:24:30] Forfeit our
[1:24:37] rights he goes on he says
[1:24:42] this whatever they may

[1:25:11] YouTube I wanted to see what caros
[1:25:15] spoke loved
[1:25:16] it Milton loved it so and so I loved it

[1:25:28] people
[1:25:31] commentator everything
[1:25:34] negative about this
[1:25:36] message and there's people that follow
[1:25:40] that they want to follow it so they can
[1:25:44] find a way to leave the
[1:25:49] message they're looking for excuses
[1:25:53] and let me tell you
[1:25:56] one over here I'm going to ask did
[1:26:00] Brother Brenham make mistakes yes or
[1:26:05] no he's a
[1:26:07] man he made mistakes but when the
[1:26:12] anointing
[1:26:14] came when he was preaching it wasn't
[1:26:19] William Mary and brand it was the Holy
[1:26:22] Spirit behind the man could not make a
[1:26:31] mistake
[1:26:33] commentaries we hear it a
[1:26:40] lot people may be starving to
[1:26:46] death
[1:26:47] spiritually and the first thing I do I'm
[1:26:50] going to use me as an example
[1:26:55] I don't know about
[1:26:56] you but phix
[1:26:59] lighthous they preach the same thing
[1:27:01] over and over
[1:27:04] again why don't we go listen to somebody
[1:27:13] else I don't want to go to
[1:27:15] church same people are
[1:27:21] there
[1:27:28] starving
[1:27:31] starving looking for the word of
[1:27:34] God in different
[1:27:38] places well I'm going to see what this
[1:27:40] brother is preaching I'm going to see
[1:27:42] what the other brother's
[1:27:44] preaching let me tell you one what I
[1:27:46] believe and excuse me because I know
[1:27:50] this is online
[1:27:53] but I cannot listen to other
[1:27:58] pastors that don't believe the same
[1:28:01] thing I
[1:28:07] believe why do I want to listen to
[1:28:10] someone that is
[1:28:13] against our
[1:28:15] Apostle I have no reason to enter into
[1:28:21] that
[1:28:25] I know it's
[1:28:27] hard but we're coming into a new year
[1:28:30] there's going to be a
[1:28:32] separation and guess what brother
[1:28:35] brandham said God calls for
[1:28:41] separators not from the
[1:28:43] word but from our
[1:28:49] nonsense my first question

[1:32:53] Pulpit to the young

[1:33:25] 96 I said where's this place
[1:33:28] at I didn't recognize it and you told
[1:33:37] me why am I saying all this because
[1:33:40] there's a bearing behind everything that
[1:33:43] we do here in the
[1:33:47] lious it's no
[1:33:50] coincidence this was his
[1:33:54] purpose how much time do we have left I
[1:33:58] don't know I do know one
[1:34:01] thing that life is going to continue
[1:34:04] we're getting
[1:34:06] older someone has to carry the banner of
[1:34:10] Malachi
[1:34:15] 45 brother Brenham
[1:34:18] stated we're commanded to pray one for
[1:34:25] another and speak
[1:34:27] right against one
[1:34:30] another is that what he said now listen
[1:34:33] to it the way he said it that's the way
[1:34:36] I said
[1:34:38] it we're commanded to
[1:34:41] pray it's not in there we're commanded
[1:34:44] to
[1:34:45] pray one for another not not not
[1:34:52] to talk against one
[1:34:56] another but to love one
[1:35:00] another so every time someone talks
[1:35:04] against you any of
[1:35:07] us what you need to do be on your
[1:35:14] guard STI up for that brother tell that
[1:35:18] brother tell that sister that's not
[1:35:28] my thoughts your thoughts are louder are
[1:35:33] louder in heaven than they are on earth
[1:35:38] my
[1:35:39] thoughts words my thoughts whatever
[1:35:43] you're thinking this
[1:35:44] morning be
[1:35:46] careful there's a recording Angel as I
[1:35:50] said writing your
[1:35:53] thoughts that's writing what you say you
[1:35:57] express what you
[1:36:08] express our voices and our thoughts are
[1:36:12] being
[1:36:14] recorded can you say
[1:36:16] Amen again
[1:36:19] Isaiah 55
[1:36:29] 11 I thought I had
[1:36:32] it uh read it in English and in Spanish
[1:36:35] please Isaiah 5511 so shall my word be
[1:36:40] that goest forth out of my mouth and it
[1:36:42] shall not return unto me void but it
[1:36:44] shall accomplish accomplish that which I
[1:36:48] please and it shall prosper in the
[1:36:51] things
[1:36:51] where I send
[1:37:02] it can you say Amen because that's what
[1:37:05] we're going to talk about right
[1:37:08] now when you say something that comes
[1:37:11] out of your mouth it's going to go out
[1:37:13] and it cannot
[1:37:16] return you can't call it
[1:37:19] back it already went to its
[1:37:23] destination just like what brother
[1:37:25] Brenham
[1:37:27] said that our voices are
[1:37:31] recorded and they're
[1:37:33] in that radio type environment
[1:37:37] atmosphere whatever it's called the
[1:37:39] air all of a sudden it's recording it
[1:37:43] there and one day sooner or later you
[1:37:47] will hear that recording of your
[1:37:50] thoughts
[1:37:57] said because God
[1:37:59] said my word my
[1:38:06] word goeth
[1:38:08] forth out of my mouth he said it that's
[1:38:13] how he created the heavens and the Earth
[1:38:16] that's how he created everything that is
[1:38:19] on this Earth a
[1:38:22] word but it was a thought before it was
[1:38:25] a
[1:38:28] word came out of his mouth so what comes
[1:38:31] out of my mouth what comes out of your
[1:38:33] mouth be
[1:38:39] careful Satan can
[1:38:42] plant misleading thoughts in our
[1:38:49] mind can can I say that over again Satan
[1:38:54] can
[1:38:55] plant thoughts in our mind and
[1:39:00] 99% of it is
[1:39:04] scriptural there's only one
[1:39:06] part that is a
[1:39:10] lie but we accept everything he tells
[1:39:14] us if Satan has talked to you I want you
[1:39:18] to stand up stand up if Satan has ever
[1:39:23] talking he's talked to all of
[1:39:27] us the key is not to accept what he
[1:39:31] tells
[1:39:33] us now you can take your
[1:39:38] seats his most successful tool that he
[1:39:47] has he wants to entice
[1:39:50] us
[1:39:54] contrary to the will of
[1:39:57] God does he do a good job you better
[1:40:00] believe he
[1:40:01] does he's good at what he does he has
[1:40:11] experience so let me look at this
[1:40:13] correctly see if I
[1:40:15] can uh go to the next
[1:40:18] slide should be ah stay right there
[1:40:24] in the
[1:40:26] Bible words are
[1:40:29] spoken as
[1:40:33] what what is
[1:40:35] that in English what is it it's a
[1:40:41] seed so in the
[1:40:43] Bible words are spoken as
[1:40:49] seeds once a word is
[1:40:52] spoken I gave you just a little
[1:40:55] bit it forms a
[1:40:59] seed once something comes out of your
[1:41:01] mouth it's going to form a
[1:41:06] seed it cannot it cannot be taken
[1:41:12] back the words we
[1:41:16] speak are the seeds we
[1:41:19] seow
[1:41:23] so do me a
[1:41:25] favor brother Brenham
[1:41:28] said if you cannot find something good
[1:41:31] to
[1:41:32] say about someone what are we supposed
[1:41:35] to
[1:41:38] do don't say
[1:41:42] anything can you say Amen not my words
[1:41:46] they were his words not his words but
[1:41:49] they're found in the Bible
[1:41:58] what what is
[1:42:00] it God created the world with
[1:42:05] words he
[1:42:07] spoke the little seed gave
[1:42:11] life ordained now if you're a seed stand
[1:42:16] up if you're a seed stand up
[1:42:22] thank you I'm waking you up thank you
[1:42:26] you can take your
[1:42:29] seats you were
[1:42:31] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:42:34] world no matter what you
[1:42:37] think you are
[1:42:39] today I don't care what you think about
[1:42:43] yourself what I care do you still have a
[1:42:47] desire to serve God
[1:42:52] that's what I care about what I
[1:42:56] was doesn't matter what I am matters to
[1:43:01] God you say Amen what you are what you
[1:43:06] were doesn't matter what you will be
[1:43:11] matters Say
[1:43:19] Amen
[1:43:26] my words that goes out of my mouth Ernie
[1:43:29] montoya's
[1:43:31] words come out of my
[1:43:34] mouth it will not return to be
[1:43:38] empty but will
[1:43:41] accomplish the desire and achieve the
[1:43:46] purpose for which I sent it
[1:43:49] out you like said I love it what comes
[1:43:53] out of my mouth Will Go
[1:43:55] On It won't
[1:43:58] stop that's why mama you pray for your
[1:44:03] son mama that's why you give your son
[1:44:07] your daughter to Jesus you take that
[1:44:11] away from your your shoulders you give
[1:44:13] it to the hands of
[1:44:17] Jesus let
[1:44:19] him
[1:44:22] his
[1:44:23] time that he brings him in remember one
[1:44:27] thing you and I are subject to time we
[1:44:32] want everything fast it doesn't work
[1:44:34] that way God has a
[1:44:38] time but you have to express
[1:44:41] it you got to say it my son my daughter
[1:44:46] my
[1:44:48] prayers I can't take this anymore more
[1:44:50] Lord what am I supposed to do now it
[1:44:54] came out it came out of your mouth what
[1:44:58] came out is for a
[1:45:01] purpose so that that can bring that
[1:45:06] seed of the Lord Jesus Christ to go out
[1:45:10] and bring forth what you're
[1:45:14] asking that's a simple
[1:45:17] message so simple that it goes overhead
[1:45:21] I can't believe
[1:45:22] that I want some more meat I need to
[1:45:27] understand this mystery that Min mystery
[1:45:31] that's a
[1:45:33] mystery that has confused
[1:45:36] man so here it
[1:45:39] is a blade of
[1:45:41] grass you can show it to
[1:45:46] me but scientifically tell
[1:45:49] me where it came from how it grows how
[1:45:53] it produces
[1:45:55] itself it cannot be
[1:45:59] explained yes or
[1:46:01] no brother Brenham said it
[1:46:05] cannot they get
[1:46:09] confused that's the way it is with this
[1:46:12] message everybody wants to
[1:46:16] know what's going to happen over
[1:46:19] here I need to know what's going to
[1:46:21] happen
[1:46:23] today what am I going to do with what I
[1:46:26] have what
[1:46:28] responsibility do we have in
[1:46:31] 2024 for the Gospel of Jesus
[1:46:36] Christ it's in your hands it's in my
[1:46:39] hands the gospel something simple that
[1:46:43] we need to go back to say when I was a
[1:46:47] child I believed everything daddy told
[1:46:53] daddy would tell me God created the
[1:46:56] Heaven and Earth I
[1:47:00] Believe by his stripes we are healed I
[1:47:04] believe it but now we look at the
[1:47:11] symptoms brother Brenham said don't do
[1:47:16] that don't look at the
[1:47:19] symptoms
[1:47:21] look at the
[1:47:24] results we get so caught up with
[1:47:33] symptoms that's the reason people don't
[1:47:36] see what we should be
[1:47:39] seeing because we're not looking
[1:47:42] for our sons our daughters to prosper to
[1:47:46] receive what you have
[1:47:49] received
[1:47:54] now I want you to do this for
[1:47:58] me I've taken a long time and just got
[1:48:01] to question
[1:48:05] one question
[1:48:10] two how many of us want to enter the new
[1:48:13] year as a genuine
[1:48:19] Christian
[1:48:22] a genuine
[1:48:24] Christian is Born
[1:48:26] Again is
[1:48:28] growing obtains the holy
[1:48:32] spirit is
[1:48:35] subject to those of
[1:48:39] authority can I say that
[1:48:42] over our subject to those of authority I
[1:48:47] love the Spanish
[1:48:49] Bible what does it say in the Spanish
[1:48:54] Bible uh you know I I I I still don't
[1:48:58] understand your Spanish you know his
[1:49:00] Spanish is way up here in my Spanish I
[1:49:03] mean I'm lucky that I can say see
[1:49:07] seor I'm teasing
[1:49:12] you no I can't hear
[1:49:18] you ready oh yeah yeah there you
[1:49:28] go well pray for a pastor that they U
[1:49:31] give an account for your
[1:49:35] soul which verse is
[1:49:38] that uh English excuse me the Spanish
[1:49:43] which what
[1:49:46] year
[1:49:48] obey those that have authority over you
[1:49:53] in Spanish it
[1:50:01] says obey the pastors is that what it
[1:50:05] says see how simple that is but that's
[1:50:09] not what we want to
[1:50:10] hear because we have our
[1:50:13] mindset we believe what we want to
[1:50:15] believe we accept what we want to
[1:50:19] accept
[1:50:24] he came from Glory who came from
[1:50:28] glory to do what to justify you to
[1:50:33] sanctify you to fill you with that new
[1:50:37] birth can you say
[1:50:40] Amen the church the lighthouse our other
[1:50:44] churches under circuit writer

[1:51:04] sicknesses through
[1:51:07] sorrow through
[1:51:09] death and still
[1:51:11] stand with a
[1:51:13] testimony tell me you haven't gone as a
[1:51:17] church through trials through tribul
[1:51:21] through sorrow through
[1:51:24] Agony and you still have a
[1:51:31] testimony that's what everybody wants
[1:51:34] that's what the devil wants to destroy
[1:51:37] our
[1:51:39] testimony once he has that then the
[1:51:43] desire is slipping
[1:51:45] away you do this well I thought I had
[1:51:48] the Holy Spirit
[1:51:50] and you let it
[1:51:53] go that's when you grab it and you hold
[1:51:57] on to a tighter knowing one thing that
[1:52:01] greater is he that is where right there
[1:52:04] than he that is in the

[1:57:54] today like there was going this is the
[1:57:57] only thing there
[1:58:00] was live here on Earth that's
[1:58:03] all you don't
[1:58:05] realize you got a
[1:58:08] soul that's going to leave here and go
[1:58:12] somewhere and you seal your
[1:58:16] destination in
[1:58:18] heaven
[1:58:20] right
[1:58:21] here the way you live the way we
[1:58:26] live the way you
[1:58:28] do what you
[1:58:32] do next
[1:58:47] slide go back one

[1:58:57] one no go back we're
[1:59:00] on there uh what did what didn't come

[1:59:48] bitterness
[1:59:49] how how many of you have a bitterness

[2:02:08] a Christian that brings the approach
[2:02:12] Upon Jesus Christ we that
[2:02:16] confess this message
[2:02:19] that we've been born again filled with
[2:02:21] the
[2:02:22] spirit that's what our kids are looking
[2:02:28] at question
[2:02:33] three how many of us want more of the
[2:02:35] word this

[2:03:16] Pastor now all of a sudden
[2:03:20] somebody goes
[2:03:22] to Eli for
[2:03:25] advice Eli gives it to him is he the
[2:03:28] designated person that I've
[2:03:34] designated no there they are one two
[2:03:39] three those are the
[2:03:43] individuals that are to give
[2:03:45] advice no one

[2:03:51] ear I thought it was water you know you

[2:04:39] there and it was clear there was nothing
[2:04:41] in
[2:04:42] there the thing was still
[2:04:46] going so then I did it again I
[2:04:49] what is wrong with you Montoya I talked
