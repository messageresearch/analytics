[33:44] yeah
[33:46] I don't know if you can understand what
[33:48] I'm gonna say

[34:05] one of you

[34:10] may you receive a double welcome
[34:14] I'd like to know every one of you by
[34:16] name
[34:19] it's difficult
[34:21] brother Paul would tell me
[34:26] that I had a very good memory
[34:30] that's when I was 27 years old
[34:39] I still have a decent memory I don't
[34:42] know
[34:44] but not like the one I used to have when
[34:46] I was younger
[34:49] before we begin
[34:53] I'd like to thank my pastor for
[34:57] the trust
[35:00] me
[35:04] once again of course
[35:08] for me it's a little difficult to be up
[35:10] here
[35:11] but I do it with much joy
[35:14] and with revelation
[35:19] I see people here that I love very much
[35:24] Junior
[35:29] a few days ago
[35:32] my wife showed me a picture
[35:36] it's brother Paul Sergio and myself
[35:40] edamus
[35:43] we're very close to brother Paul Pandora
[35:50] when I see people which you love very
[35:52] much
[35:56] you don't you feel it uncomfortable at
[35:59] all
[36:02] I know I love him
[36:04] I know he loves me too
[36:08] this morning
[36:11] I'd like to speak a little
[36:15] about three weeks ago
[36:19] I found my lot to speak on this uh
[36:21] message
[36:23] before we begin
[36:26] like to ask if you could please stand
[36:28] and we'll be praying
[36:32] Heavenly Father
[36:35] once again we thank you for all things
[36:39] asking that you be with us
[36:42] and everyone who is hearing us we love
[36:45] you and need you
[36:48] we're always thinking
[36:52] on our people that watch us via the
[36:54] Internet
[36:55] my brothers in San Luis Rio Colorado
[37:03] sometimes he says in Colombia
[37:07] may be difficult with the time change
[37:10] but father wherever they see us may you
[37:14] be with us
[37:15] and with them also help us
[37:20] we ask this in the name of the Lord
[37:22] Jesus Christ
[37:26] taking advantage that we're standing
[37:27] we'll be reading our scripture
[37:30] for right now I'll be reading one
[37:31] scripture
[37:35] Mark chapter 16 verse 15.
[37:44] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[37:47] world and preach the gospel to every
[37:49] creature
[37:54] may the Lord has blessings to the
[37:56] reading of his word
[37:57] you mean take your seats
[38:02] told you about three weeks ago
[38:06] felt my law to speak on this message
[38:12] I think I went over it pretty quick
[38:17] today I'd like to calm down a little
[38:19] more
[38:21] and give a few definitions
[38:24] okay
[38:27] we read the scripture
[38:29] that
[38:31] I'm gonna stay with the word preach
[38:34] ER
[38:37] and live here because I have a few notes
[38:42] when I began to jot down my message
[38:46] I write it on a page
[38:49] then transfer to another page
[38:53] and try to search out each word
[38:58] I went up to the sixth grade in Mexico
[39:04] as you may understand I'm not too
[39:06] educated
[39:08] I know we have very well-educated people
[39:10] here
[39:13] when it comes to finding the words when
[39:17] I read them
[39:18] and don't understand them
[39:21] I'll understand them more or less
[39:23] then I go to the dictionary
[39:28] to preach means
[39:32] to publish or manifest something
[39:35] to deliver a sermon
[39:37] representative
[39:40] to rebuke admonish to scold
[39:43] and the one I like the most is
[39:48] preaching must be accompanied by
[39:51] practice
[39:52] uh
[39:56] [Music]
[39:58] my sons tell me that they're not going
[40:01] to understand what this is
[40:05] a practice makes perfect
[40:11] so brother Manny and brother Gershon
[40:14] playing the saxophone
[40:49] to admonish is to warn a person
[40:56] just goal is to show anger to rebuke
[41:01] in practice
[41:06] skill acquired with this exercise
[41:10] so what you know what you know how to do
[41:15] with practice
[41:18] you'll produce uh you become a teacher
[41:20] of it
[41:22] and from there we get experience
[41:25] a
[41:29] definition when we read the definition
[41:33] of what it is to preach
[41:41] and when we read the scripture
[41:44] when we read the scripture
[41:49] normally we believe it's the person that
[41:51] stands behind the pulpit to preach
[41:53] and I believe it's for all of us stand
[41:56] back here and
[41:57] preacher my brother Branham brings it
[42:01] closer to home
[42:02] and brings it all together
[42:06] he preached the message
[42:10] that God had explained
[42:12] [Music]
[42:14] and that's where he includes us all
[42:21] in Chicago Illinois priest on the 25th
[42:24] of April 1961 in Chicago Illinois
[42:28] page one
[42:30] in the
[42:31] uh
[42:32] paragraph three
[42:35] I'm going to read it as it is in Spanish
[42:41] you know it's better to leave me a
[42:44] sermon than preach me one anytime
[42:48] and we would hear this quite often
[42:51] images
[42:53] I respect so everyone who stands here
[42:56] behind the pulpit and the ones that go
[42:58] out and preach
[43:01] ERS
[43:04] with me by God's grace I was able to go
[43:07] on the missionary field quite a bit with
[43:08] brother Paul
[43:10] and I've been able to go with brother
[43:12] Montoya also
[43:14] and it's not easy
[43:16] uh
[43:20] has been my friend for many years
[43:24] but he doesn't have any buddies
[43:27] so traveling with him
[43:31] brother Branham vcse says the following
[43:36] this is in the Army when you're in the
[43:39] military
[43:42] they don't ask you you want to peel
[43:44] potatoes
[43:45] they tell you peel potatoes
[43:49] like that more or less
[43:54] he doesn't tell us what we'll be doing
[43:57] I was able to go to Peru with him
[44:02] and I was able to greet the Brethren
[44:04] there
[44:24] brother Paul
[44:26] is
[44:30] so when we say where we come from
[44:47] when I step behind the pulpit to greet
[44:49] our brothers
[44:54] I told my I told them that this was the
[44:57] best investment my family and myself
[44:58] have done
[45:00] the act of being able to go to Peru
[45:04] Colombia because when I say go to Peru
[45:06] or Colombia in Africa go to Africa
[45:12] well the more I mentioned these trips
[45:15] the more expensive they are
[45:18] younger
[45:54] then I looked at him
[45:57] I said okay I'll go with you
[46:01] it was a blessing not only for myself
[46:05] but for all of my family is uncle
[46:14] Danny brother Danny
[46:16] um
[46:17] I remember who else
[46:22] it was an unforgettable experience
[46:27] when we've gone
[46:32] just about all of us that are here
[46:35] if something if we've learned something
[46:39] how to treat people
[46:55] like this
[46:58] there's three conventions three meetings
[47:01] I would like you for always
[47:09] Phoenix Arizona and here in Phoenix
[47:10] Arizona
[47:13] the first time I went to Chalco
[47:16] Elementary Martinez
[47:27] because I get embarrassed when I see you
[47:31] later Phoenix Arizona you've never
[47:34] failed to be there in Phoenix Arizona's
[47:35] convention
[47:37] and also more or less
[47:40] hardly ever come here
[47:43] so he embraced me hugged me and told me
[47:47] yes
[47:49] that's what helps me keep pressing on
[47:54] so we do struggle sometimes you know
[47:57] in normal but that's normal
[48:03] is
[48:06] what I'm saying you know it's better to
[48:09] leave me a sermon than preach me one
[48:10] anytime
[48:15] here we're preaching with a tie on
[48:18] but the majority of you
[48:21] see my Sunday just sees my Sunday face
[48:26] you won't see me on Monday
[48:28] or Tuesday
[48:34] so don't bother him on Mondays
[48:38] brother Bernie would say that was his
[48:40] worst day also
[48:42] that doesn't only happen to brother
[48:44] Montoya
[48:47] last week
[48:54] foreign
[49:29] I like to read it
[49:42] here a pistol reign in our hearts known
[49:45] and read of all men
[49:48] sister
[49:50] if you read the scripture
[49:54] and you read a little bit of before it
[49:57] or after it would see the Apostle Paul
[49:59] is saying
[50:00] recommendations because they were asking
[50:03] for letter recommendations of the people
[50:05] he was sending
[50:07] you are letters what do you need any
[50:10] more foreign
[50:45] one of the definitions in the dictionary
[50:50] it's to be honored
[50:53] to be honored honest I'm sorry to be
[50:56] honest
[51:00] that's one of the definitions of an
[51:02] epistle is to be honest uh
[51:07] problemas but I want to give my son any
[51:09] more problems
[51:10] for he was helping me type this up
[51:16] they're not going to understand that
[51:19] so we'll write it this way
[52:01] foreign
[52:05] I know brother Bernie says for him to
[52:08] preach yes it's like having a slice of
[52:11] cake
[52:12] well there's some people that can do it
[52:15] but he would also say okay
[52:18] one of the most difficult of offices is
[52:22] to be a pastor
[52:24] he says the following
[52:30] I just heard it last week on the message
[52:33] he preached
[52:34] at three stages of Grace
[52:37] he says
[52:39] many people think
[52:45] that I go and Pat people on the back
[52:49] and people think I do that
[52:52] people that believe that brother Bernie
[52:54] says
[52:56] let's see let's let them listen to 10 of
[52:59] my messages
[53:00] and see if I'm that way or not foreign
[53:19] to understand it
[53:23] you have to love brother Montoya very
[53:25] much foreign
[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] a message
[53:55] they
[53:57] conduct hours
[53:59] questions and answers on COD book s
[54:06] and Spanish is paragraph 11.
[54:08] I've read it before
[54:11] I like to read it again
[54:16] what it is that I'm speaking
[54:19] brother Branham says the following
[54:22] is
[54:26] now I was talking to a man this week a
[54:28] very prominent businessman in the city
[54:34] who said to me about going back into
[54:36] Africa and India
[54:38] and he and he said
[54:42] why they just got through killing a
[54:45] British general over there
[54:47] I said
[54:50] what's that got to do with me
[54:59] he said you can going back over there
[55:01] where all that murder is going on all
[55:03] that race riot and so forth
[55:06] he asked
[55:12] sure that's where I'm needed
[55:17] what the Lord wants me to go
[55:20] he said what if they kill you he said
[55:25] yes
[55:28] I said well if God wants me to be killed
[55:31] I'll just be killed that's all cuando
[55:35] when one goes on the missionary field
[55:39] in
[55:40] in Houston we were in Houston
[56:25] that's difficult
[56:27] tengo
[56:29] I'm 70 years old he
[56:32] is
[56:34] sometimes I tell my children
[56:38] when I'm here in the casket hey
[56:45] don't make the funeral service so long
[56:48] I want it short
[56:51] the first one that says something is my
[56:53] daughter
[56:54] don't say that
[56:57] I have to okay
[57:00] sooner or later it's gonna follow my
[57:03] life
[57:08] so when I saw smoke coming out the plane
[57:15] what am I getting into
[57:17] pero uh
[57:21] I told you it was a blessing
[57:25] uh
[57:28] when brother Branham preaches this
[57:30] message
[57:33] the token
[57:36] is
[57:39] on the first of September of 1963 at
[57:42] Brandon Tabernacle
[57:44] Indiana Jeffersonville Indiana
[57:53] I'm going to talk about Mom this is
[57:56] Brother Branham says the following
[58:01] you know when I see little fellows like
[58:04] that it takes me back when I was a
[58:06] little boy
[58:07] foreign
[58:11] foreign
[58:16] and you know the old saying is you know
[58:19] they on your feet now and your
[58:21] heart later
[58:22] okay
[58:27] but I don't believe it'll be so when we
[58:30] dedicate them to the Lord
[58:33] we have a responsibility here is
[58:39] this in your hand
[58:43] he made a preacher out of you

[1:03:45] and he has to work
[1:03:48] and without complaining
[1:03:51] because that's what fell every one of
[1:03:53] our Lives
[1:03:55] I told you my respects
[1:03:58] for every every
[1:04:00] moment I wanted to mention this
[1:04:04] is
[1:04:10] saying every mother is a preacher and
[1:04:13] her congregation are her sons and
[1:04:15] daughters
[1:04:17] you know
[1:04:29] there were sisters that wanted to preach
[1:04:33] I'm going to say let's hope you don't
[1:04:35] take it wrong
[1:04:38] brother Bernie was safe from the pulpit
[1:04:41] is
[1:04:45] if it would be permitted for women to
[1:04:47] preach
[1:04:50] we have tremendous preachers
[1:04:57] heard it before
[1:05:05] you have much respect to our sisters
[1:05:13] the message here okay
[1:05:18] that I've read before but I'd like to
[1:05:20] read it again
[1:05:25] brother prison the 19th of April of
[1:05:28] 1959.
[1:05:30] speaking of a Preacher
[1:05:32] speaking here of a Preacher
[1:05:39] Temple
[1:05:46] is
[1:05:49] in paragraph 160 in Spanish
[1:05:57] I thought why didn't they put some of
[1:05:59] them young fellows up here to preach
[1:06:03] the place was packed and jammed and I
[1:06:07] thought
[1:06:08] why didn't they do that
[1:06:14] so this old fellow instead of preaching
[1:06:17] what was going on down here on Earth
[1:06:25] he began to preach what was going on in
[1:06:27] heaven all the time
[1:06:30] well he took him up at the beginning
[1:06:34] the beginning of time
[1:06:40] and brought him back in the second
[1:06:43] coming down to the horizontal rainbow
[1:06:47] I had never heard such a preaching in my
[1:06:50] life
[1:06:51] senor
[1:06:53] parents
[1:06:56] about that time the spirit hit him and
[1:06:59] he began to jump that high
[1:07:03] and clicked his heels together
[1:07:08] foreign
[1:07:28] you open say
[1:07:30] s
[1:07:32] and I thought that'll make an old man
[1:07:35] act that like that
[1:07:37] yes he's too weird and me what would it
[1:07:40] do if it got on me I thought
[1:07:45] maybe I need some of that
[1:07:47] is
[1:07:50] right he come out there I felt so sorry
[1:07:53] for that old fellow valenciano
[1:07:55] for the out for the old fellow
[1:08:00] for me but when he left I felt sorry for
[1:08:03] myself
[1:08:05] and I looked at him I go off there that
[1:08:09] is
[1:08:10] so some people have the gift of
[1:08:12] preaching yeah
[1:08:14] some of us don't have it
[1:08:16] like I told you at the beginning yeah
[1:08:22] oh you don't like this soup
[1:08:25] I'm gonna give you another one
[1:08:32] I go back to when I was a young fellow
[1:08:34] in my town yeah
[1:08:37] that's my math they're mothers
[1:08:39] they would make a soup
[1:08:42] and we had to eat it
[1:08:46] I want to say Mom I don't like onion I
[1:08:49] don't like tomato
[1:08:50] so you're eating it yeah end of story
[1:08:56] so those were the old-fashioned moms
[1:09:01] no forgive me for what I'm going to say
[1:09:06] our children have a restaurant at home
[1:09:10] one says I want pancakes
[1:09:15] some sandwich the other one says I want
[1:09:17] a sandwich
[1:09:23] they got a restaurant at home
[1:09:26] and not only the the sons
[1:09:35] what will grandparents not do for their
[1:09:37] grandchildren
[1:09:39] would get upset jump and Shout
[1:09:43] we want our children to be happy
[1:09:47] for our grandchildren to be happy
[1:09:50] even though we may struggle a little bit
[1:09:53] but in our days
[1:09:55] 1960.
[1:10:12] I wouldn't want to say this to my
[1:10:15] brethren
[1:10:16] um so to my brothers and sisters in the
[1:10:18] flesh
[1:10:20] and my first eight years
[1:10:23] we're the most happiest years of my life
[1:10:27] I didn't know what it was
[1:10:30] I never knew I was born
[1:10:32] maybe I didn't even have sandals
[1:10:36] but we never lacked anything and we
[1:10:38] never liked any food
[1:10:42] when my wife and I got married
[1:10:46] my family
[1:10:49] yeah
[1:10:50] we got there with my dad and my my
[1:10:53] stepmom he
[1:10:56] and uh the Greece ran out
[1:10:59] my dad killed a pig
[1:11:03] we need a beans or corn
[1:11:06] we had some there in the storehouse
[1:11:11] we wanted uh some pumpkins would go out
[1:11:13] to the to the theater yeah
[1:11:18] on the season of of of of the vegetables
[1:11:22] so there was always something to eat
[1:11:24] that's why I tell you my first eight
[1:11:27] years of life
[1:11:28] we're very happy for myself
[1:11:32] I have nothing bad to say about San Luis
[1:11:35] I got there when I was eight years old
[1:11:48] when I was eight years old
[1:11:51] it wasn't such a difficult job
[1:11:56] I sold candy
[1:11:59] selling used clothes
[1:12:03] and about 13 years old I started working
[1:12:06] at this job
[1:12:07] where I made good money
[1:12:12] my son is not going to understand this
[1:12:14] word
[1:12:17] I I was a Bookseller on the streets
[1:12:19] India
[1:12:23] I saw the Daily Newspaper there in San
[1:12:26] Luis yeah
[1:12:32] I was never embarrassed of doing that
[1:12:35] but at 13 years old
[1:12:40] I made as much as anybody who would have
[1:12:43] a regular job
[1:12:44] but like I told you is
[1:12:50] very nice
[1:13:15] so when I go back over there
[1:13:19] foreign
[1:13:27] that's where I learned to work
[1:13:31] but let me tell you okay
[1:13:35] that I thought I worked hard in San Luis
[1:13:40] I work in a company who dug a
[1:13:43] holes for for a
[1:13:46] water in the kitchen for water
[1:13:47] irrigation thank you so that's what I
[1:13:50] would do
[1:13:51] and I made very good money
[1:13:54] I did work very hard
[1:13:57] when I came here to the U.S
[1:14:01] I said by God would I get myself into
[1:14:05] um
[1:14:06] my brother-in-law Brothers
[1:14:09] he got me work at a butcher shop
[1:14:27] here in the U.S yes
[1:14:31] you work much more difficult
[1:14:33] [Music]
[1:14:35] no I thought I worked hard in Mexico no
[1:14:38] you work hard here at all
[1:14:43] one works hard
[1:14:47] and you have it all
[1:14:50] but you have to pay for everything
[1:14:54] I had a co-worker
[1:15:03] he says sickness only lasts three days
[1:15:10] so in Mexico
[1:15:13] you'd get a permission to not be at work
[1:15:15] for the whole week
[1:15:16] I hear you quit working three days
[1:15:20] and the bills just keep stacking up
[1:15:24] after three days
[1:15:28] that's how it is here
[1:15:31] nothing wrong to say about Mexico
[1:15:34] or no also not nothing wrong about the
[1:15:37] U.S
[1:15:38] we all have to work yeah
[1:15:44] one may think that your job is harder
[1:15:46] than the other way
[1:15:49] I'll go with him one day to see if it's
[1:15:51] that easy
[1:15:53] so jobs here are difficulties
[1:15:57] I wanted to finish saying this
[1:16:00] okay
[1:16:41] and we want the best for them
[1:16:47] God bless you
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:56] stand up for a minute please
[1:17:02] I'm not going to take too long
[1:17:05] we have some praying to do this morning
[1:17:11] first of all now you can take your seats
[1:17:14] he didn't tell you everything
[1:17:19] again I'm military
[1:17:21] so if I tell you to do something
[1:17:24] I'm going to tell you once then I'm not
[1:17:27] going to say anything
[1:17:30] um that's the way I was brought up he
[1:17:33] said he was
[1:17:35] oh he left no Safe Way eight years old
[1:17:38] when he really started working I was
[1:17:42] 16. and my parents
[1:17:48] belonged to the military
[1:17:52] the following day
[1:17:54] on my 17th birthday I had no hair
[1:18:00] I had some baggy pants
[1:18:04] and they called me an animal
[1:18:07] I was worse than an animal
[1:18:10] so it's I started very young
[1:18:14] now I am what I am
[1:18:18] if you call it discipline discipline
[1:18:20] because of that background
[1:18:24] but I always learned one thing
[1:18:27] what I wore I wore okay
[1:18:30] and uh
[1:18:32] so that people can get ready
[1:18:36] I was in Lima Peru Lima Peru
[1:18:41] and actually it was in Lima it was I'll
[1:18:44] just say it was Peru yeah
[1:18:46] and a brother
[1:18:50] started putting on his clothes
[1:18:54] the other brother about that well
[1:18:58] he goes into the closet
[1:19:00] puts on the clothes
[1:19:03] his suit came up
[1:19:05] the jacket
[1:19:07] oh my beautiful wife oh she's so great
[1:19:11] she brought me a brand new suit she
[1:19:15] didn't have time to tailor it
[1:19:18] oh look at these pants are so nice
[1:19:28] well the other brother he gets out of
[1:19:32] the shower
[1:19:33] looks at the brothers
[1:19:35] that's my clothes
[1:19:40] the brother put on the wrong clothes
[1:19:43] everything was the same color
[1:19:49] a navy blue suit Marino
[1:19:53] and uh so I turned around and said you
[1:19:57] better check all your clothes to see if
[1:19:59] he didn't take anything else
[1:20:04] and I I wanted you to laugh
[1:20:06] the young people start coming in
[1:20:10] but it's something that when you're in
[1:20:13] the mission field
[1:20:14] you eat what they give you
[1:20:17] whatever they assign you to do
[1:20:21] we do it without
[1:20:24] being upset
[1:20:26] we do everything according to what our
[1:20:30] Apostle taught us
[1:20:32] very
[1:20:34] obedientes and one of the things that
[1:20:37] brother Bernie used to do a lot
[1:20:42] you're a beautiful young lady
[1:20:45] that's my granddaughter
[1:20:57] uh would line up all the oh you're
[1:21:00] beautiful too
[1:21:01] we want it
[1:21:03] I would line up the kids and would pray
[1:21:09] for each uh child that was going to
[1:21:12] enter the school system
[1:21:15] not only are we going to pray for
[1:21:19] for these young people
[1:21:21] starting school
[1:21:24] it's a different culture
[1:21:27] all schools are different they have
[1:21:29] their different rules foreign
[1:21:57] and what I want is uh if you're a
[1:22:00] teacher and you're in the audience what
[1:22:03] I want you to do is just stand over here
[1:22:04] on this side
[1:22:05] because we're going to be praying for
[1:22:07] you because it today it's hard to be a
[1:22:10] teacher nobody appreciates teachers
[1:22:14] it's my understanding
[1:22:18] uh years back
[1:22:22] when the students
[1:22:24] will shoot the teachers and we started
[1:22:29] looking this is what's happening uh you
[1:22:33] get a
[1:22:34] a disturbed student
[1:22:39] life is not what he thought
[1:22:42] you know
[1:22:43] let me check it out
[1:22:46] you know I'm glad God gave me my vision
[1:22:50] but you know Sunday school teachers are
[1:22:53] the same you know they should be yeah
[1:22:55] the reason I say is because we all have
[1:22:58] a job to perform
[1:23:07] foreign
[1:23:08] School teachers you need to be up here
[1:23:11] it's very important
[1:23:14] now if you're a student and you're in
[1:23:18] high school you're in college you ought
[1:23:20] to come up here
[1:23:23] the reason I say it because it's hard
[1:23:26] it's hard to be a student
[1:23:29] there's so much influence out there that
[1:23:33] influence that's out there
[1:23:35] it's called friendships when we have
[1:23:39] friends they can lead us astray
[1:23:43] and what we want and we want to make
[1:23:47] sure
[1:23:48] that as a church the lighthouse
[1:23:54] has a culture and that culture is the
[1:23:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:06] I was a Sunday school superintendent
[1:24:11] for many years and I understand one
[1:24:15] thing
[1:24:16] that somebody has to teach them
[1:24:18] Christian values
[1:24:22] it's not up to them to correct themes
[1:24:27] they should come to school Sunday school
[1:24:31] I'm prepared
[1:24:35] obedientes respectful
[1:24:39] so this is what we look at
[1:24:41] because tomorrow is Trini said brother
[1:24:45] you have ministers here
[1:24:48] you have song leaders here
[1:24:51] a few future pastures you have future
[1:24:55] wives of ministers here
[1:24:58] and we want to upbring them
[1:25:04] in a Christian environment
[1:25:06] so we're going to pray and what I want
[1:25:09] you to do is as we pray remember those
[1:25:13] that aren't here
[1:25:14] family members
[1:25:17] prayer goes a long way
[1:25:20] I believe in prayer
[1:25:23] that's one of our our weapons that we
[1:25:26] have
[1:25:28] our enemies
[1:25:30] train a child the way you should go
[1:25:33] and when it is
[1:25:41] the Sunday School teachers have given
[1:25:43] them
[1:25:45] grateful for them and I'm grateful for
[1:25:48] you as parents
[1:25:50] so let's pray
