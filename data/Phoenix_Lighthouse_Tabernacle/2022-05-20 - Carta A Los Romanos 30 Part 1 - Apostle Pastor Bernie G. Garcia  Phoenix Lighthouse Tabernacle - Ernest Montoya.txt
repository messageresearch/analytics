[Music] my [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and then [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] uh [Music] hey [Music] is [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] hey [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] know [Music] oh [Music] how many of you love god so open up and the judgment day rather we've eve to the serpent and so forth but on that day won't be able to pass back to anybody our very own conscience will be standing right there now this person stand before god and the books were opened the books were opened everyone you've done while you've been here on the earth the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works first of all we see that there are there are books and these books are the sinners books what happens that when a person repents accepts the gospel to be a son of god one an eternal god an eternal son of god we see then that there are books open or two or three witnesses you might try to dodge that but when you do that who concerns your conscience comes and testifies the same thing and it says i say amen to what that book says he covered it [Music] another book was that i'm with you which we'll be judging now let's see revelation 22. verse 18. unto every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy that takes away god shall take away his part out of the book of life beautiful says this locker see it feels dislocated 20. on verse 15. we see that we read here from the brother this is two books here illegally and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so there's there is a danger for your name should be taken out of the book of life written in the book of life from god's and verse 2 chapter 4 verse 2 first corinthians moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea i judge not mine own self the bible says until the lord come who will who both will bring to light the hidden things of the dark side will make manifest the councils of the hearts and that shall then shall every man have praise of god amen there's something there that goes off into something else i'll just leave 524 it was presented is is other our lives through the world because it brings to the surface but when this happens there's another one that hides that covers himself house each one of us will change foreign that's page 434 of the hebrew book but the wicked are in a place of waiting and torment with you for their judgment someone at right now look look at luke's chapter 16. 16 verse 22 of luke hermano hermano juan alvarado foreign 22. and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angel unto abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried the dagger died and was taken to abraham's bosom and the rich man also died and was buried verse and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment and seeing abraham afar off and nazareth and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in the water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame conformed according to the word he was a so-called believer and he says father abraham he it's like a person that sentence to death [Music] is should i change subjects i continue reading now therefore there is no condemnation for them who are in christ jesus to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no i agree with you there is no judgment [Music] matthew 7. you know where i'll be picking it up in my field from where i live after matthew 7. not everyone that says unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and i name that many wonderful things wonderful works before going to the radio station this morning i forget the man's name rule the profession for them i never knew you apart depart from me that work in equity in other words one worker of inequity therefore whosoever hears these things in mind and does does them i will liken him unto a wise man which built the house his house upon a rock it is and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was found upon a rock and everyone that hears my these saints the mind and does them not shall be likened into a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the wood the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it now the scriptures that we read in romano in romans chapter two reverses consciousness that's amen over there the witnesses will be there against you amen and your own country will say amen yes i didn't send them alive i went to church just to have a good time i was garden over here look for a girlfriend i would get an overview look for a boyfriend to look fine for our social standings i don't really [Applause] through his word for this morning jesus went unto the mount of olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them entonces to him a woman taken in adultery and when they had said her in the midst they said unto him master this woman was taken adultery in the very act now moses and the law commanded us that such should be such should be stoned but what says this they said tempting him and they that they might have to accuse him but jesus took down with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him cast first cast a stone at her and again he stood down and wrote on the ground it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst the greek says 2 and verse 16. in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel right there before them was jesus christ then he starts writing on the ground and scribes [Music] [Music] none of them turned where the truth is right [Music] i think name is peter controlled my spirits body soul and spirit reaction to your words jesus christ [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] now [Music] uh [Music] [Music]
