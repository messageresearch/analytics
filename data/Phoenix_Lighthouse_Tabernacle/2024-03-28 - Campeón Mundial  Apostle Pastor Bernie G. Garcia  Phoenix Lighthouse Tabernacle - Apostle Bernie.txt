one of you this morning in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ before praying let's open our [Music] Bibles I have three scriptures the first being in the ninth chapter of First Corinthians verses 24 through [Music] [Music] 27 [Music] know ye not that they which run in the race run all but one receiveth a prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is tempered in all things now they that do it obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast [Music] Away St James 1 ver 13- 16 [Music] [Music] [Music] St James chapter 1 1: 13 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not Heir my beloved [Music] Brethren Genesis 22 verses 14 through [Music] [Music] 18 foris 22 beginning with verse 15 and the angel of the Lord called called Abraham out the second time and said by myself have I sworn sayeth the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and H has not with withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies let us bow father we draw nigh unto thy of grace and mercy reporting for service before me is this sweater Lord of and as your word is being [Music] voiced as it is written Lord as the people which hear are delivered and as those that hear on the table are delivered and those that have not an opportunity be when this sweater goes to the indicated one that she may receive that she has need of in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for we are more than conquerors in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ first of all I'd like to thank each and every one of you for visiting us the ministry which accompanies us all also and the Brethren which have helped through these few days we give them thanks also I think we've been benefited in having heard the four Brethren which spoke a very formidable message brother Ramon Deon spoke on the reaction of Faith then brother Abraham spoke to us on the big tree a very beautiful teaching that the brother brought forth last night brother Pablo re spoke to us on the rules or the laws of the game he that open the convention brother gabri speaking to us of the testimony in his life I sincerely have learned to love brother Gabriel very much because I believe that he's been able to understand something that has gone over many of our heads in coming here being here this morning first of all I appreciate God's leading and his protection the first time while having a convention that I've brought forth the word of God here in the Tabernacle we've always asked other brethren to speak but I had placed my S there to speak this morning in colia well in colia we had uh difficulties in departing from that [Music] country through God and brother faal everything was straightened out in time we arrived here in Phoenix on Thursday night in at midnight in col well there in colia we were in the city of they're meditating on the thought that the Lord's been dealing with me about the thought of the origin of humanity brother fa asked me if I had already completed that teaching I answered no brother we're just barely skimming the top of what we'd like to speak on that it so happens that a while back the lord gave us a thought which we entitled spiritual AIDS from there we were led to the subject the origin of humanity then we spoke on the thought flesh and blood and afterwards the thought identity the word identity is synonymous with the word Oneness we were able to see how a man or the human being when he is completely surrendered to God how within him he has part of the Sevenfold Glory of God's personage truly they seem as though they thoughts that that are separated or isolated but the only way to understand it is if you bring all of those thoughts together into one and I've come to the conclusion that man himself when he's totally surrendered to God becomes all Mighty sufficient sufficient in himself he is able to exist like self existent one he has within him that which he needs in speaking on this it seems as though it's heresy but I [Music] believe and that's when I'm trying to bring forth to the people as we see the example of the Prophet Daniel he was in captivity he did not have a brother a church a pastor he didn't have anyone else he didn't have a Pianist Guist he didn't have anyone else with him the Sevenfold Glory of God's personage inside and that's what kept him firm we you see that when God created man that was his Masterpiece man fell from the position that God had placed him in we understand these things he was the most precious thing the human is the most precious thing of God's creation there is nothing that can compare with mankind that's the most precious that exists today but man must recognize his calling so that he can fulfill that which God desires to do through him as we were there Ina colia in kaha [Music] Colombia the lord gave me another short thought within the same line of the origin of humanity and I'd like to entitle that thought this morning world champion that is my desire to become world champion I don't want to be a boxer that just goes to the preliminaries but I want to box to win all to be the world champion recognized World Nam called announced the world champion so happens that in these brethren in bringing forth their messages the scripture that they read or those things that they mentioned they were quoting my scriptures I would just like to draw all of these together and bring forth a short thought world champion so happens that I I hear different comments like for example brother if you hear so and so brother speak you shouldn't speak what that brother spoke because that's now secondhand religion I believe when our brother Prophet messenger of this age brought the message when he brought something forth of the word of God we received that message I believe that while it's something intellectual I believe then that it's secondhand religion and I have no right to speak it because then I'm preaching someone else's message but when the Revelation comes and it's re revealed personally it's no longer my message my word my Revelation no one can take it it's been revealed to my heart but as long as it's not revealed to your heart anyone can take it away we find that the mind is the womb of the SP Spirit the greatest battle ever fought takes place in the mind that's the Battleground it's through mutual agreement Satan and God were in agreement first of all to the Mind Satan has rights to your mind because the fight or the battle of the contest is Satan against God or God call either word or doubt many people many Christians are defeated in that point because they don't claim what there is rightfully there because an evil thought has come to their mind but the devil has right to or or the right to come to your mind the battle is being fought in the mind in the mind of each and every one of us the the fight is for the soul Satan wants the soul he wants you to doubt the word of God God wants you to believe the word of God you must permit the word to descend to the heart because if you confine confide in your mind you'll be defeated sooner or later you'll be defeated but if you permit the word to descend of the heart and if you come to a place of weakness in the mind from the heart the word is Anchor and it will surge and stabilize you because it's God in you the Great and Mighty conqueror the scripture and our brother say that the promise that God gave to Abraham was that thy seed shall possess the gates of thine enemies how many of you believe that when I believe that to be so possess complexes possess thoughts possess those complexes that come to me possess the thoughts that come to me because I should dominate those thoughts before I wrest it's not not with the ministry I wrestle not with you it's with myself because the wrestle is in the mind fighting for my soul that's why many I said the other day many people they get shook up when there's a vote or election they say well that's political the first one that that began the voting process was God free moral agency you vote God votes for you and the devil votes against you now it's where you vote what matters the Battle Is Here many people oh the battle is heavy the battle is Raging there's many Devils around me there's many devil Devils there there's no Devils there the devils are in the mind that's where the battle I want to be a world champion not beating the wind but hit the mark I want to possess complexes Prophet said saying God made manmade slaves when we hear this these words we quote them we put them a far off but let's bring it close to home God made man man makes himself a slave to his own to his own thoughts his own complexes the things that come against him he should CLE to the not doubting the word of God that's then a Slave the message says there were many slaves and there was one that didn't behave much like a slave you heard heard them say around well he doesn't act like a slave he doesn't act like a slave because he is the son of a king people let themselves to be drawn by slavery there are people that are slaves to liquor other slaves to drugs they're tried to educate him out of drugs they've tried to educate them out of liquor other are others are slaves to hate to of Wrath and so many other things the only way we can become slaves is if it comes to the mind the thought for and it captures you you did not capture the thought the incorrect thought captured you a slave then people that get so mad they can't dominate it they're slaves of that wrath slaves of that wrath I want you to be a world champion the battle is at home can you accept that let's open the word for a bit First Corinthians chapter 9 verses 26 and 27 you know more or less where I'm heading um getting to home if you can understand it you shall be Crown not just as a preliminary but a world champion verse 26 of chapter 9 of First Corinthians therefore so run I not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beateth the air brother brother spoke to us not one that's just beating at the wind the air no but I keep my body so the body the the the the punches are to the body brother said last night Paul wanted to defeat his worst en is that right his worst enemy is Bernie Garcia that's my so I don't want to beat the wind so you can understand me that beating the wind beating brother V brother Bernie jto or brother VTO brother said so I want to beat myself where the body shots are two I bring my body bringing it unto subjection there are two the Bible talks a bit about the outer or carnal man and the whenever you go both of them walk always thinking Beyond like those drivers that are always with the high be looking Way Beyond but let's bring him glow the fight is not the fight is close in your own person and we thought on the on what the poet said the whole congregation can Beed pastor and everyone but if God has placed you there for you to be a light no matter if everyone's wrong you should stay to be the light of the world there place to be a light you see brother I sincerely believe that the message not brought to it was brought so we can know who we are the most precious thing that exist the human being let's turn to Romans R Romans the sth chapter verse 24 when I read it I apply it to myself and as you read it apply it to yourself don't apply it to someone else oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin the brother spoke to us concerning the rules of the law of the game here Paul is saying I myself with the Mind serve the law of God because the mind to that womb here is where God and the devil come and it's so difficult that I can't tell the difference many times I can't guide myself with my mind but my mind with the mind I the law of God the law of God which is his word what the word of God says I must anchor it in my whatever the word of God says is what I will do many people say I do this because that's what I feel like doing I didn't feel like going to the service but if you investigate yourself I didn't go because I didn't feel like going to serice if he would investigate himself he will find that he's a prisoner no matter what he say from what he shouts thought has dominated when a person permits the law of God the word of God to guide him he will go where God said go honor me when you go to the house of God to hear for the word of God says that but my thought my complexes don't let me run ey because I see this brother I see that brother I see the minister I see the preacher my complexes have given Flav but if I do not let my mind govern me but the law of God then I'll have Victory and become a world champion but with the flesh the law of we already know what the symptoms or the fruits of the flesh are so unto the law of sin the law says do you not understand that an adulterer not that's the fruit of the flesh but the word of God says this do not commit adultery the flesh wants to draw of that the the law of sin of Flesh says but the law of God says no I want to smoke for and they're so bold in that to say this the messenger said I smoke all I want I drink all I want but since he didn't want he didn't he'd come to another stage but when we're still in the flesh even when we accept Jesus Christ Still In the [Music] Flesh drugs and so much other things serving the flesh with the flesh the law of sin don't be drunken don't get law of sin but when we're free from those things I have no need of them I know that's not my own which is mine but as long as I am that I serve the the flesh with the law said we're not religious that's why when you come to the Lord I don't tell you you can't smoke you can't drink you can't Comm you can't do this that the word of God will speak to you and bring those things to you you want to smoke smoke you smoke a cigarette a cigar I come to you and I embrace you oh I I take him out no you didn't take me out because I'm not the one fighting you nether am I going to judge you the word of God judges you must be judged by the word and say Lord I want to smoke I made a covenant baptizing and even though I want I'm going to subject fory flesh to the LA did not stop smoking iify the flesh myself in the room and say Lord take it away I don't want to be a to this take that desire away make me free me I beat my body I beat my own body Serv for you Lord because I want to be a world champion first John 44 people that don't know me that they have not heard me before maybe they think well poor Pastor he's just starting out that's why he can't bring the de teachings you can know all the Mysteries the T the of the son of the heavens the New Jerusalem the Millennium the Rapture over all things but if you don't overcome your own self you will be defeated the main thing we Pro that in the scriptures when we speak spoke on the message identity that we didn't not know our own selves but it was promised that one day he would manifest himself and we would know him as he is and see him face to face and knowing him as he is we would know our own you can find that in 1 John 32 Corinthians 139 if you don't understand go to the message identity I did not know myself I was a religious man a preacher a Son of a Preacher Brother of a Preacher brother-in-law of preacher Uncle of preachers all around but I didn't know my own self because I didn't know him look at him as looking Darkly looking at myself as Darkly but one day the veil was torn open and the seals were open the messenger spoke to Mighty God unveiled before us the revealed word through that the time came when he said now you know me son now know thyself when I began to learn about my own self saw the message completely different seeing it different than when I preached it for 19 years I thought before that the gospel the message been given to show the whole world all of the Mysteries 70 weeks of Daniel whatever Min Ministry was there and preaching it and I taught it but all of that after all of that I place my eyes around the world and no people don't even know who they are what it is what's the greatest mystery is deity and without deity you can't get to Second not God above us not God With Us God in us that's the hope of glory in you so that you can fight against the the satanic Wild for the fight is not in church the battle is in the mind first John 44 once again I feel L to repeat that slowly it doesn't make any difference what subject the preacher stands up to preach and people become when people leave a church the first thing they say is nothing but hyp it doesn't make any difference to me if I'm surrounded by complete hypocrit it's who am I am I a hypoc am I sincere with God have I had a a meeting with God have I received him if I I have received he's given me power according to the Bible not to the Min to me and that received him he gave power to become the sons of God he gave me then power so I could become a Son of God not to run to someone else myself and dominate myself my thoughts and my complexes and my feelings to the word of God the word burst forth and a son of God comes forth because our mother is the word we are sculptured to the word the word is how does he we hear the word J by the word we are through the word and with bur Son of God from mother which is the word and the spirit is waiting for to enter that body so don't tell me that you think it's the Revelation the great Revelation the greatest Revelation is that's what the messenger say without the Revelation reation de you can't get to second base is that right first John 44 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world can you say Amen who have we overcome the spirits spirits and thoughts come to the mind let me just say this again I don't know why I mention it but just listen closely the messenger said in this age there's a bride a pure virgin that stays with every word that proceedes out of the mouth is that what he said but a spirit comes and says don't believe it Maliah 4 is all mixed the ministers the the Ley everyone's just a bunch of Lies Liars but take hold with the law of God says there's a virgin somewhere a raptured people people that are going to accept the word and you Lo direct Yourself by that law to overcome lying spirit come depart from me you say there's no believer th says the Lord a bride somewh pure without wrinkle and overcome you where do I overcome no here with my my body not feating the wind beating my body my home overcome you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you God bless you God bless you you know how it went for Jacob Jacob could not face his brother he had been born again and he couldn't face his brother right until he got into desperation when he got I can't go to my brother that face him the birth that I had Lord because he been born he had the the birth right already that would take him to death that's what will take the foolish that Massacre that's wait Millions will die that birth this Mage will take you togh getting desperation so that the token the life of Jesus Christ through you and as job said Jacob said my name changed he could see because he overcome changed God had descended and made him an overcome a world champion he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world returning again to the message identity I know you thought it was a very nice message many told me oh what a nice message and when I said that when they said that I said to myself they didn't understand it I wasn't trying to bring a real message but to give you a link to a [Music] chain a part of the puzzle so that you could see the picture it's not way over there it's with you as an individual as a man as a woman understand that my brother me Oneness Oneness when you identify you identify with one or with the devil or with God you find your identity and you begin to show your identification United with God you were with him before the foundation of the world came to a body of sin and heard the gospel something called you and you said who am I sooner or later found your identity found your place now father now Jesus Christ came as a son come to me now in that Spirit You and I One devil can no Spirit why that can come if you live in Me Is You greater are we you and I oness greater am I he that's in the world that power because he comes and he lives in [Music] you my brother spoke a truth last night Napoleon in saying that Napoleon conquered the Nations when he was 33 years old but he couldn't conquer his own self can you imagine that what did good did it do he conquered the entire world and he couldn't conquer his own self alcohol it dominated him made him a slave and it took him to his death to a premature death because he couldn't conquer his own you don't have to understand you just have to understand that you have to conquer your own how can you conquer your own by surrendering to God I don't want to overcome my brethren many go trying to overcome the Brethren the deons deons all sh he knows that what I tell going to do and if I don't make my I have him conquered yes maybe you hav't conquered yourself but when you conquer yourself as a lamb to the Here I Am Lord let thy will be done I surren to the I found my identity and I understand I didn't start here that before the foundation the world I was with you Book of Life me strength to overcome beat my own and present myself to your word amen amen Brethren first John 2 15 through 17 not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the Flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes away and the lust thereof but he that do abideth forever and comes through the eyes through Pride through love through the flesh the world comes through it's world the world the things of the world not Conquering the spirit nation has when that Ang came to Daniel that from the first day God sent but I couldn't come because the Prince of Persia kept me for 21 days Michael that came to help me and I am here each Nation each City each state Province it's has a spirit the bre things of the world fashion stri contention stay away from those things they're the things of the world the things of the world should not abide in Christian Christian is the word of God Jesus Christ in flesh manifesting himself through his life he wants to live he cannot live within you unless you first die resurrect rise up resurrect living in you to get gu you to the last step be aded he'll say this is my ye Tru he's become a world champion my last thought now this is what the Devil comes to your mind to say if this is Maliah 4 I'd rather go back to my denomination without knowing it we're confessing that we're still denomination a personal denomination thousands of personal denominations ideas and they return to their own denomination maybe not church one man one man denomination one man denomination the thought the thoughts come here the wrestling I believe the word how many believe the word if I look at myself in the mirror and see that I'm a hypocrite and my brothers and all my congregation if I look at myself that way say you're a hypocrite that minister is a hypocrite the congregation hypocrite but there is somewhere people called by surrendered to the word because the word can confess the truth the word is not fa forming and presenting Sons but the sons must accept that the battle is in them for 20 years almost I've been preaching this message I know that the devil tears you to pieces by coming here and when he comes to your mind he makes you doubt that you're of God first of all God gave him permission to the devil to come to your mind God [Music] said there's going to be a match a fight you and I no one else you and I very well where will the match be in in England in Japan United [Music] States a mutual agreement had a mutual agreement the match will be in the mind of man and we'll fight for his soul from there the devil says I'll present my wisdom which is doubting the word of God God said okay present and I'll present my word as a reality and that's but since the Devil comes and since you thought the evil if you were a Son of God you wouldn't have thought that is that right and answer him devil I found my identity I know that I come from God these evil thoughts are not my own take them [Applause] back resist the devil in faith resist him in Revelation and he will flee from you not to his people inth you ration of the word maybe I was a drunk drug ad maybe I was but now I'm the blood of the Lamb cleansed but remember you did that do you remember devil yes I remember it was a revelation but God doesn't he doesn't remember that but the devil wants you to remember so that you'll vote for and don't vote for him resist him in and claim what's yours close your eyes anyone help quickly father your [Music] children extend that hand of faith to resist the devil in faith put the battle forward that atomic bomb that Revelation and the devil can't draw close because Atomic blast sends him to his place he knows that he's going to that place of Hell know that if he draws too close he will be sent before that's why the evil spirits they in the ga asked to go into the to thewi they had to go into some place cannot children of God they the Devil Revelation in this Lord yourself in their heart bir theog up stand and the Lord's people say you accept it thank you Father thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] go [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
