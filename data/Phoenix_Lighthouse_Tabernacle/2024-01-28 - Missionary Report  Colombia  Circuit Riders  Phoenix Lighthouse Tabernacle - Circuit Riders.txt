TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yes even the thoughts of the mind and if we love the world all the things of the world the love of God's not even in US many are called few are chosen straight is the gate and N is the way that leads life and but few there be that many will come to me in that day and set down in the Kingdom said [Music] Jesus but the children of the Kingdom will be and said Lord have not we did this in your name we pror and and I never knew you depart from you you workers of iniquity enter but the one that doth the will of my which is in heaven that's the one that goes in there you are entering into this Promised Land how do we get into it we are predestinated to it the church by the for knowledge of God has been predestinated to what to his honor by his grace to the glory and worship and glory of God sitting back there in the beginning self-existence nothing around him wanted something to worship so for our predestinated a church before the foundation of the world and put their names on the Lamb's Book of Life when is say before the foundation of [Music] world his glory hisis all things in that one man Christ Jesus glor that's that's that's it right there my brother sister don't you never move from that his elction you God by his election Grace sanctified God by his El Grace and his power bapti you and put you into this land of rest they which have entered into this rest have ceased from their going astray they ceased from their works like God they have joy unspeakable and Glory ising long gentle goodness patience faithness gent and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their Hope Is Anchored In Christ Jesus the witness of the Holy Ghost Records and wonders these signs shall follow them that they go along they heal the sick they cast out they they no move for getting those things in the past they press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus that's that church how did they get there you can't say well Lord you know one day I started smoking cigars I fell thought no oh no no no no predestination predestin he call when we fall we say God we were lost and [Music] undone we didn't even have a even ourselves we were nature Pig we were pigs to begin with you go out to a pig looked at Old s look here old girl I want to tell you something it's wrong for you to drink SLO now that's just as much as you have of saving your own self you say lady you shouldn't wear clothes like that you should dress neatly you should do this you should not go to you should not have these card parties you shouldn't smoke cigarettes you shouldn't do this you shouldn't care those o o I belong to the that's about as much as they know well I'll let you know I'm just as good as you are they reject the leadership of the Holy Ghost the Bible said that love the world all the things of the world the love of God not even in you Mak them you are a holy nation what have you done entered out of that land you're over in another how did you get over there that's a prom what kind of Promise come to pass the last days say God I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh by one Spirit we are all bed into this one [Music] PR amen brothers and sisters Hallelujah with a purity of heart no jealousy no brother goes astray no matter what he does you'll go after I went after a brother not long went as a young fellow said to me he said let that Rascal go let him alone I said if I ever get to a place that my heart don't go with my brother then is time for me to go to the alar because I've fallen from Grace I said I'll go as long as he's got breath in his body and I'll catch him somewhere along the line yes sir and I him Hallelujah back in the safely now he went asay as sure as the world a while ago I seen that poor little woman sitting there in the Sher me said stra she's she's out of her h said sure said Billy I know him real well and as a kid he said if there's anything I can do to help I said that's all right so they brought out there and when she left a while ago and what was it we sent a prayer out after she they said you want to get a doctor said to your husband you want to get a doctor said a doctor can't do nothing for her and that's right do can't do for her said our only hope is get there and he said Billy I don't understand that I said I don't don't Nei understand no brother remember I was way out one time some come after [Music] me I wanted to come go something come after me because before the foundation of the world God predestinated hallelujah that we would be here to his honor and Glory listen those who he knew he has what right why did he call those who he for knew he called those who he has called he has Justified is that right and those who he has Justified he glorified amen that's what the Bible says those who he for knew he called every generation those who he call he already glorified what let me read the scripture here right having predestinated them into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his own pleasure to the Praises of his glory to the Praises of his glory he there in the Eternal ages of is to his children would scream father father the Ang say what are they talking about what are they talking about so beautifully displayed in the prodical son I was lost this is my son he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring for best wonder when the morning Stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy and they seen the Plan of Salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world you sayin believe something like that I didn't believe Calvin Calvin was a [Music] murderer Calvin put a man to death because he baptized in Jesus name he was a rascal need to be converted himself but what he said about some of the things he said was right don't what his action a man to kill a man for something like that that's horrible that's sinful all right wherein he has abounded towards us oh wait I didn't get that adoption did I'm too late all right just just let's say 10 minutes for the sake of these people's come look look ad let me Father a big Kingdom he rides around now he's got a son born oh he's so happy let G so you know what that father does he finds the very best razor Tut you know what a is don't you scho teacher he finds the very best school teacher he can find in all the country we're going now and he finds the best school teacher he can find you don't just get this awag he wants his boy to be a real fell don't you want your children that way bet you can give them yes sir so if a natural man thought that what do you think God God thinks about for his children the best he could get so he wants a man that'll be honest he don't man look Junior you just do anything you want to H oh yes Father uh he's getting along fine he's a fine boy get a little Pat on his back and a straw in his hat no no that guy get fired right now sure he wants a man that'll be truthful that boy's coming right tell him if he isn't tell him what's wrong and if a Earthly father thought that wouldn't you want a man to be honest with you the school teacher be honest about your children sure what do you think God thinks he knows we don't he does we're finite we couldn't tell but he's does know so you know what the father did he never said I'm G to get a pope to watch over my children NE get a bishop no no he didn't that because he know the pope would be wrong so would the bishop he never said go get a general overseer to watch over my churches he got the holy [Applause] ghost that was his ra children all right then how would you know the Holy Ghost he speak through human lips how do you know then it's tell the truth when you see the Holy Spirit speaking through your lips that's telling the truth exactly every time predicting the coming to pass just perfectly like Sanel said then you know that's true God said if he speaks and what he says don't come to pass on hear him because I'm not with him but he hear there you are that's how he does now then he goes around now why do you think that tutor would say if he had to go up to the father and say your children's acting awful I tell you that boy yours he he's reneg he's a r about I never seen such a Ma you know what he does that girl of yours oh I don't know what you g to do with her well you know what she looks up like she she's all painted up like some them girls over here pH yes she wants to act just like they do my daughter yes your daughter that's what the Holy Spirit has to say about the church today no wonder we can't have a rival now that's true what about your son thing what well you know you always said that those sheep should Hur that pasture up there on that sheep food up there yeah you know what he didove in that weed P just talk them down there dunk them all in that Creek and let them ra around that weed pile eating them old Willers and their support they can't hardly get out of there that's Bishops pastors who deny the power thereof well I tell you the truth I never seen such a bunch of nervous sheep in my life you don't like that no and you Al up there you know to make him f know we yeah he's making them jar societies and everything you never seen life in your life never seen such all your life you know what he's doing going along out there smoking a big cigar right back he's got his wife with him she's wearing shorts just like the Philistines are doing out there that's kind of message the Holy Spirit has taking by church today now what do you think about that that's adoption what he did he do he predestin us onto adoption he give us the Holy Ghost but wait a minute adoption that's what we're talking about well you know what he does the bishop come out other day and he was having little healing service down there the bishop come by some guy brother come by was praying for the sick he said you stop that yes Father Bop don't you cooperate oh no father Bop and here I come and tell him the truth right out of your word here it is I read your laws to him exactly what to do and he won't listen to all that was for another age another son some other time that don't mean me that's truth friend now don't you see where the church misses his placing why we haven't got revivals why we haven't got things going on that's where Joshua say uh dad I want you to R in here L your place to the blue your get here Benjamin you go right down here and now you all stay away the Joshua comes back all over the all the women pained UPC around big time and josua scratches his head now this exactly what's taking place not all thank God not all but too many all right I want Tak place that's what happen don't you imagine that man the Holy Spirit blushes before the father when he has to say that oh my I told him he wouldn't listen to it I told him that and let him read right there in the book I had I had a little minister to come by and show him that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever you know what he let one of them let one of them old gold herders come over here and tell him that that was for [Music] another and he smelled so bad time he got over there with goat smell you know cigars smells so bad when he got over here but I tell you that had enough metal on him or I if you'd write his name in the paper take his bit would take a half a sheet to make his time well yes sir they sure like him over there in that country but I tell you he sure don't know how to feed sheep that's one juston listen the Holy Spirit I tried to tell him that you're the same forever but he

God for each one of you this morning we'll be giving just somewhat of a report it what went on in Colombia in Baran but before that let us first go into the scripture and then we will be praying we'll be going to Genesis 1:1 we'll be reading until verse 5 you can indicate it with an amen once you have it and the word of God reads in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day we'll be jumping to verse 11 all the way to 13 and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the Earth and it was so and the Earth brought forth grass and Herb yielding seed after its kind and tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day please bow your heads Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly Father we humbly come before thine presence father Lord we know that you are the only one we can run to here we are prepared and ready to receive your holy word this morning Lord we come in expectation knowing that you have something prepared for us we just ask Lord may you open up our hearts so that that word may come in and may make itself manifest in our lives Lord and above all Heavenly Father we give you thanks and likewise we ask you for our pastor who is currently out of town at the moment Lord help him take care of him and be with him and we thank you for all things we place this all in your precious name in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Wednesday yeah and so we got to Colombia on Thursday Wednesday I'm sorry we got there Wednesday we got to Colombia on Wednesday we were prepared because I believe brother Manny felt its lot on Thursday and mine would have been Friday and so it felt a lot me and brother Manny [Music] together and truly I learned a lot from our brother Manny the wisdom that he has and I just ask God I can at least reach to his feet of everything he knows but we knew that it would fall our law to speak so we were talking to each other when we were in our room asking what are you going to talk about what do you think you're going to talk about and so we were speaking and we reached a conclusion of what we were going to talk about Sab Tes and on Thursday he spoke in sabana Torres with our pastor darier and on Friday it fell my lot to come forward I mentioned them right when I went up that it was just a small talk because each time I say that it's just a small talk it it sort of calms myself down a little bit so it fell my lot to speak and the focus was the [Music] youth I gave a short testimony and I truly thank God for that and on Friday night we got together with the youth and I asked each one of them to bring or find a Bible because we're going to play some games Brother Joseph he was the one who was helping me out he was guiding or taking charge of the games we were doing a game where I would give them a scripture and the one who could find it the fastest they had plenty of fun we were there for a good amount of time until we had to go but I did mention to them that on Sunday we would be giving away two tablets to agapo tablets so they were all very excited I told them there was going to be a competition and the one who accumulated the most points the two people who would have the most points they're the ones who would win the tablets so they were very motivated so after Friday um Saturday came Dr Monto went up to pray prach it was trly a very impactful service I believe that many people were delivered that night many youth after the service what I did is I first placed them all in the circle there was a lot of new young people who came so I wanted them to get to know each other their names or where they come from and so on so each one gave out their their their name and then later what we did I paired them up into groups and what I asked each one of them to do to give a testimony of how God has helped them in their life because because we know that there was a lot of young people that this was their first time and many times The Young Ones the youth it's easier to listen from another young person what has happened and then they start thinking upon themselves if they went through that and they're currently doing well then I will also be well so I separated each one of them into a group and as each one of them spoke I was listening to what they were saying there were two testimonies who greatly impacted me there was a young sister she was telling her testimony she was saying that her parents for a good amount of time they had left or departed from the church and she didn't know why but even her within herself she knew who God was and when she was told that she was going to go to church on Saturday she said she rejoiced within herself because said well now I'm going to go to church she says that when she attended the service she said that she had so much fun that she liked it so much he says how could I be missing out on so much that was really impactful for me and one of the young sisters as well Grace her name is Grace each time that she tells her testimony I really see The Wonder of God even in what the doctors were telling her God had another plan in mind um so that was very impactful for me and so there was a lot of young people who hadn't come before and I would hear them talk and one of them was telling me he says for a long long time they used to invite me to church when there was services in baranka he said I I knew that I I should go but I didn't feel like it was time so he would always say no he says but something inside of me this time told me get up and go to church he said God truly did something in me this Saturday so I see all the testimony of the young ones and I see the god of the the hand of God moving and working and I give thanks to God for that something that I used to say or I would say it's always good to have great big events it's good to have getaways but when you sit down with a person and you listen to their stories you listen to their past and you see how God has helped them that's where it truly makes an impact on your life and I give thanks to God for that and on Sunday well before going into Sunday on Saturday we went a bit over time the young ones didn't want to leave they were having plenty of fun we're playing [Music] charades and so they truly had fun but on Sunday we got the the activities ready we prepared them to be able to win the tablets and so on Sunday our brother Moreno opened up with Sunday school our brother El and then our pastor came forth to preach on Sunday morning truly Brothers the place was full we had to sit some people outside to place a speaker outside so that they could hear but truly there is a hunger for God to hear the word of God not just with the adults but with the youth and I thank God for that as well after the service we went outside to organize the activities uh we did a couple of activities I'm going to be honest with you I'm still not I'm still not used to the humidity one of the young ones told me you look you look like on Sunday you look like you're a bit low on energy he says that's CU I'm still yet to get used to the humidity each time I would go into the sanctuary because inside it's very cool but everything was good thanks to God and but before that we were doing a couple of activities now that the humidity or the sun was very strong I asked them all to stop for a moment and drink some water so that they would drink water and the truth was I myself was really thirsty as well um and but what I noticed that when you have the youth and you give them time by themselves they begin to open up and they begin to have fellowship with the rest of the youth and in my mind I asked myself what am I gonna do it's too hot to be doing activities that are moving so I was thinking about it and when I went out of the sanctuary the youth were already talking to each other and I said well that's that's very fine and so then our pastor he went with the brothers back to the hotel and we went to go buy some pizza I believe it was about eight boxes and we took them to the youth and the youth well they they took all the pizza and not just the youth also a couple of adults but at that time since I already tallied up the points that each person had already accumulated [Music] and the ones who won the agabo tablets Tes one was our sister miari Torres and our sister Ken Pao and there they are on the screen one of them when I mentioned them that they had won the tablet I gave it to her and she told me well why are you giving this to me I sold her you you earned it and she said me see and I said yes she said are you sure and I said yes okay okay she said all right and then later she sent me a message he said brother said I still can't believe that I won the tablet and I said thanks be to God I believe that's truly going to be a blessing to each one of them and I just ask God that he may guide them and may He help them in their walk Wednesday or Thursday and on Wednesday it was a day we were to leave um but for one reason or the other we were not able to leave they canceled our flight we stayed in bot for another day now in the morning of Thursday we were set to leave our flights were delayed Phoenix so truly we didn't get to Phoenix until almost past midnight so it was pretty much Friday um but I give thanks to God um but something that I would like to tell you it's something that I shared with the brothers in Colombia some time ago Phoenix when I first moved to Phoenix and I started helping out with the youth um not everything was going well in my mind I had quite the battle and so I asked myself what am I doing here why don't I go back to Iowa but one day my aunt you told me we have an appointment with brother Bernie me in my life I had never spoken with brother Bernie I heard stories testimonies and that's why I honor that man because he truly sacrificed his life so when my aunt told me that I said yeah I would like to go with you and so I went and one of my cousins went in first after her it was my turn truly when I went to him he was seated down on his chair or his cushion and by respect I I kneel down next to him and the words just came out of my mouth I told him brother Bernie well this that and the other and I I was crying because I was frustrated I was tired he told me well where are you at right now I'm with Pastor Montoya and he told me this he says you stay by his side and everything will be fine and truly the reason I'm here at this moment above all thank God but because of what he told me and I have the confidence and the faith that as long as I'm standing with my pastor everything will be fine may God bless each one of you [Applause] may God bless you Brothers God bless you it's good to be back in the house of the Lord it's good to be in your home it's good to go out don't think that it's easy I've mentioned it many times many clients that I have they send me texts they tell me are you working or are you out and about are you in the missionary field and then people come and the majority tell me they you they say you live a very exciting life they ask me where you going to go now which country you going to visit but there's a price that has to be paid one cannot explain to just everybody when you have a calling from God doesn't matter what you do you can't escape from what God does with each one of you one would want to run away like Jonah did but obedience is better than sacrifice and I want you to know that each time that we go each one of you comes along with us we go representing each one of you and the people truly appreciate that talk about the pictures I get excited and I just start speaking and I get nowhere I love the word of God I like to study the word of God and I believe that it's something that since I was a child I've always wanted to know I wanted to have knowledge but what's the knowledge that I wanted to know I want to know more about God that's why I devote my life to study messages to listen and know more each time not to know more than somebody else but to satisfy the need that I have inside of me and I thank each one of you for your prayers if it weren't for those prayers where would we be today as our brother baristo said I would like for him to stand up once again I would like you to know that he's not just any young man these times that we've gone to colia he's a very Exemplar young man repeat it once again we have the best Brothers of Applause once again [Applause] I would also like you to know that he is single you already know what I'm referring to but he knows that I appreciate him that I love him that's why I do what I do I told him you know if I didn't care about you if I didn't like you the word would say I wouldn't even look at you but because I like you that's why I joke around with you and the brothers in colia are very grateful that the Lord allows us to go that our pastor has a certain Vision to take certain people the brother struggle a bit with finances the dollar goes up and it goes down if you think it's difficult in Mexico the majority here think that it's difficult in Mexico right now in colia it's about 4,000 Colombian pesos per dollar so the effort that they make to assist or attend because surely the seat of God is inside of them just as the seed is inside of of your heart so you feel that desire to be able to come to service when the brothers go and they rejoice when they hear our testimonies when they hear our pastor the message that he brings that is so powerful here even the brothers are outside now I want you to know if you could stop you for a moment I'll it right now in colia you are here cold right now they're in the middle of summer because on the other side of the Equator so right now is the worst time to go to Colombia because you're going without moving without doing any exercise like our brother baristo said [Music] you begin to sweat all the way down to your feet just so that you have an idea so it's not easy but look at the people yet they're outside even they're outside with that humidity you see that small fan that was there that's all that they have because they want to hear the word of God so when you stand behind the pulpit and you say that love them they answer with an amen and so I tell the brothers I say you don't even have to tell me I feel with the smile that you give I feel that you love us brother Bernie in the message three CH of Grace he speaks about something that may have gone over our heads he says something so outstanding in the first part he says the following and when I say you will agree with me that he does say it he says the three stages of Grace he says it's something so simple he says but if it was a revelation inside of you will cause a revolution in the message of the hour with things so simple as these so that is what is happening here in colia it's happening that people are going back to church the seed that was planted praying for the people the people want to come back they want to know and they want to know more about God they want to receive their healing you know our pastor how he is when he prays for people he doesn't give 50% he doesn't give 80% those who have gone out with him for me he gives 110% because he wants people to receive their healing you know why we don't receive our healing is because sometimes we don't believe it but if you believe that it is for you simple you have to identify yourselfself knowing that it's not God's will for you to be sick because sometimes the devil wants us to doubt you did something wrong that's why you're going through this and just the scripture has multiple meanings even besides all of that it's not God's will that you would be sick you accept your healing you confess your wrong you surrender to God and he will give you what you need now this young man he asked for something so outstanding and that all of us I think will ask for he asked for a need knowing people Discerning the people he said he says what else do you want and he says it with a smile he says I want the Holy Spirit how many of you want the Holy Spirit you know the reason why you desire the Holy Spirit the simple Act of you having that desire that it is for you sometimes we got to be a little self-centered it's not for my neighbor it's for me that's the way you have to or else you're not going to receive it you prepare yourself at the right moment the Holy Spirit would come inside of you and what desire more outstanding and people would come and they were receiving that which they were looking for and likewise this morning you came this morning perhaps only to listen to a report but God is touching your heart he knows your need he knows everything that you need he scrutinizes even to the most profound and even so in this morning if you believe it just as our brothers believe it over there then it means that it is for you so as I tell you the brothers come asking with all of their heart and they receive but with so much sacrifice that they do it and pardon me for saying it this way but we have here sometimes we have new cars and we don't want to come here there's brothers who come from other cities struggling staying in one place just to be able to attend the services and without air condition imagine I told you just without even moving you already start to sweat now can you imagine to go sweat to a place so the sacrifice that they make will reward each one of their sacrif God does not keep anything for himself each time that you surrender your heart when you surrender your life when you surrender your time when you surrender your money God gives it back and rewards you and now before I go a little bit more forward here where we were on in a service on Thursday the offering was pass pass by I have said it before but maybe perhaps this will help somebody else and I took out for my offering and all I had was a $20 bill and I said well God that's it I might as well do it I'm G brother who which pocket I have it in I don't want to reach the wrong one he takes out the 20 That Dying devil that's the way we are sometimes we grasp on struggle a lot with money but it's not even ours it's God it belongs to the bank have you not seen what it says on there so I gave the bill the money and I said Lord you know and it didn't weigh upon me I just gave money and when I left from here a person came I need my my my car and I need to fix it I said I'm not going to fix it I need you to go get it and pick open up the shop and go pick it up and because he's somebody that I know I said well I'll go do it so I went I open I didn't do any work for it I didn't even charge him he took it he says well for your B here and he gave me exactly $0 that's the way God is at your time you give your money God would give it back to each one of that's why he rewards our brothers here the brothers are so happy each time that one goes to receive a blessing on behalf of God so it's the same for you if you want a blessing if if you in your conscience the scripture says your conscience does not condemn you then you ask what you need believing and God will give it to you so God wants to unite the families you know what our here came this family they asked that they want to unite more and God honors his word and just to finish up I can say a lot and you say well brother you say the same thing but brother it's like when you look at a pictureis Gate Bridge here's a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge how many have gone there and those who haven't gone you can look at the picture and you say oh it's so beautiful but when you finally go to that place and then you experience the reality of things that's the same thing on the missionary field you can appreciate the love that they have for the love that our pastor has for the missionary field that is why sometimes I even bother my own family I say look at this picture look at this brother say it's just you again with the same old things when there's something inside of your heart here look how happy the people are in the Heat and even just being there just to be with the brothers you want to share that happiness with everyone and when it's within your heart I tell the brothers you would like to give that experience to your children so that they wouldn't suff everybody has to go through their own experience so it's the same way when you have something inside of your heart you want to share it with everybody and it's the same way with the gospel and to finish identified myself I have this small testimony or else I'll never finish you already know me I told my brothers out of all them I'm the quietest one see you laugh that's CU you don't believe me but people sure know how to provoke me they provoke me to speak serious in real life so speaking with my brother besides sharing the missionary field with him you create a stronger friendship with your brothers and so I identify myself plenty with the life of our brother MOS and with each one of the ones who have gone and so we got there and he was telling me phoenixon he said look brother from Phoenix to Houston it's three hourson it's a it's three hours then you wait a couple of hours in Houston Houston and from Houston to B it's five hours and then from to it's an hour so then you have time to speak with your brothers came he would tell me look when I was a young man I used to see brother Bernie and I would begin to pray I would cry now and say Lord I see how the servant of God how he struggles with his needs Lord take away my needs and give them to the Servants of God so he can continue to spread the gospel when he would tell me that I began to cry because I thought what young man does that and that's exactly what I had in my heart I know that he is the servant of God to give him my virtue so he can continue spreading the gospel you know what God showed me you did give it to me that's why you're still with the ministry of the apost and that's why we are happy Brothers we might not be much but what we do we do it out of our heart we with what our messenger what the seventh angel brought what the Apostle brought what our pastor B has brought and that is the reason why we go I want you to know that it's not easy you suffer but even so we do it because there is a reward and that's why we give thanks to God may God bless you Brothers God bless you Brothers It's a privilege for me to be here before you and GRE you in the fres name of Lord Jesus Christ truly for me Brothers it's a great privilege something that in my life I had never thought about that I would be with brother Monto with brother and with other brothers that for me they are the maximum sometimes I feel like the smallest I am the one who fetches stuff no the one that runs away the one that runs away like I said like my brother said like Jonah he ran or wanted to run away many times that's how I have felt in my life but I have learned to trust in God because he has a plan and a purpose for each one of his children there's many things that we sometimes don't understand but God is working with each one of us when we look back and we look at our lives we see the hand of God that always protected us did not allow for us to cre to make too many mistakes where we wouldn't be able to be here because I believe just as brother brandham tells the story when he was a young boy and a couple young boys be he went and got his father's rifle he waited for them he says which one of you wants to die first but God would not allow that for him to become a murderer so he shot 16 shots and nothing came out later he picked up the shells back in the rifle and he shot at a tree and each bullet shot out that's the way that God has taken care of us each one of us because there is a job or work that we have to do there's a purpose that we will unravel and when you share testimony with your brothers we realize that we are on the same boat that we're on the same path and God is working with each one of us and truly Brothers it gives us healing to have Fellowship now I can understand that more than ever important it is to have fellowship with our brothers because where is God many may say well God is in heaven or he's here or he's there but right now where is God in the heart of man in my brother and if I want to speak with God then simply speak with your brother and have fellowship with them and I believe with all of my heart brothers that that is what God wants to have with each one of us is to have that Fellowship but us like brother brandham says we are Our Own Worst [Music] Enemy it's not our couple it's not our children it's not the neighbor it's oneself because the fight we're fighting [Music] nowadays it's not against flesh or blood evil spirits of Darkness that are surrounding us and they're waiting for us for you to let your guard down just a little bit I realize that the devil is very fast he does not wait he's always watching the Bible says like a roaring lion waiting for you to just let your guard down so that he can come in but God is working with his people I believe with all of my heart part of the Bride of of our Lord Jesus Christ and for me and throughout the year I was talking to them in sabana Tores last year which was 2023 it was a very difficult year for the Munos family you know about my son with cancer but now I can see of how good God is with because he gives us what we need and sometimes those trials are to place us it's like the hammer God is creating a masterpiece and he gets the hammer and the pick and he begins to Chisel that rock and those trials hurt sometimes we hurting we ask God why me but God knows what he's doing because that trial it would place you in your position it will place you where you have to be and truly it's a privilege for me to be able to be next to this [Music] man there's many people who don't know who he is now I can understand that by revelation that's why Lord Jesus Christ asked apost who says who who does man say I am even themselves they ask themselves who is this man but God gives each one their Revelation he was the son of God so sometimes we look at our mistakes as humans we all make mistakes the beautiful part is knowing this message and being able to know that we have an advocate the Bible says that if we've committed sin and we confess it he just and righteous to forgive and that is the key that's why the Bible says that a Christian cannot sin you cannot sin because when you recognize you've made a mistake you repent and you say Lord forgive me I did not want to do it brother Bram says at that moment the blood of Jesus Christ it forgives you it cleanses you it says if you have never done it and if you do it again that same day you repent once again he will forgive you once again and it's as if it would have been the first time you did it that is how God is that's how the blood of Jesus Christ it has power to annihilate just as the ink falls in the bleach it dissolves completely when we confess our sins he just and loyal to forgive this is the second time that I get to go to Colombia the first time that I went with my pastor I had gotten sick I was still a little bit sick while I was over but on this occasion I felt very good and we truly had a good time in the Lord now I understand brother Bernie how he says that he loves the youth there is strength in the youth he says if I could get the wisdom of the old one and the strength of the young one says then we could take over the whole world truly there's a lot of strength in the youth it's very beautiful when they dedicate and surrender their life at a young age I have told my testimony many times when I was 13 years old I got baptized I wanted to serve the Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart but then came the trials many times the Devil he's a good adversary he knows how to approach us he knows our weaknesses there's sometime he knows us better than we know ourselves and in this time that we live in it's the time brother Bram says he says it's the most difficult time he it's the most deceiving time the most difficult time to live in but it's also the most glorious time because all the Mysteries all that was hidden throughout the ages has been revealed at this time [Music] and the youth for me they're very special because I remember when I was speaking with our brother evaristo when you have a Sunday school teacher that person there's an impact on that young person for me it was brother kuo and the book that he would teach on was the seven seals and the Seven Church ages that was our book of material and that's why I will never forget what he would show us it made a great impact in our lives but I also understand says you can know the Bible from cover to cover but it's not so much knowing it's good to know but we have to believe we have to have faith we have to believe that this is for us we have to know who we are this time is very deceitful and I would ask myself why is it so [Music] deceiving why is it such a deceitful time Brothers it says because there's many denominations there's thousands of thousand of Rel and they all claim to have claim to have the truth but brother Bernie tells us in a tape takes us to Matthew where it says I'll read it quickly but I tell love thy [Music] enemy bless those who curse you do good to them that hate you and do those who are against you and who and who persecute us truly brothers that's the most important to have the love of God God brother says nobody will go beyond we won't reach beyond that because nothing can enter that place but if we have something against our or our sister Now's the Time to M go that something against your brother free of all those things because that's the seal that's the love of God that agapo love that love where I don't care what they've said about me I love you because you're my brother you're my sister and I don't care what you've said about me or forgive me if I've said something about you but we have to mend it at this time we're living in a dangerous time I got to speak a little bit about LA and truly Brothers we know that we live here but we're not of laa there's an open door between Philadelphia and laa that is the door brother Bernie says that door is open and what does that mean it's where you can enter in but now I understand that you have to make your decision you have to take that decision you have to decide who you're going to serve because God is a gentleman and he's not going to force us he is waiting on you he was waiting on me until I decided one day I'm tired of running away I'm tired because I remember my mother used to tell me thank God for our [Music] mothers because I realized it's the closest thing we have to the love of God and she said son doesn't matter where you go if you go to the Moon I'll bring you down if you get under the Rock there I will find you there's no place where we can hide from God we're naked before him let's come forward with our surrendered heart and surrender our life to our Lord Jesus Christ because he wants to use our hands he wants to use your lips he wants to use it to hug that person who needs a hug to give him words of encouragement whoever needs those words of encouragement that is God through you he can't do anything if he does it not through man so God wants men that are preparing and who are prepared and who are willing to leave it all behind to follow him and I myself sign myself up on that list I know God has more to give us than what we could ask for what need do you have brother what need could you have this morning when he already paid you already did everything for us healing is inside of salvation already given it to you it's free accept it this morning because it's for us will be a has been preached to the Bride of our Lord Jesus Christ difficult to live this message there will be a group of people who can't live it doesn't matter what happens but they will be there on that day and if there will be one you will say I am he if there's two and I'm one of them there's three and I am one of them you have to believe it that you are one of them because it's by faith and it's by Revelation because God has called out a very special people at this time and we have to live a life clean pure without blemish and without wrinkle and nowadays God is calling a people in colia Pastor belan was telling us and the many of the brothers that went to the services that we had at church it's the second or the third generation of brother Jose Alvarez of the group that he had there many of those young families that you see there are the grandchildren of many sisters that were there with [Music] brother God is bringing them all together to those families and bring them once again to the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ because no one will escape from his hand I want to finish with this brother Montoya many years ago when I was more lost in drugs I heard a message it's called in the hands of the original owner perhaps this will help somebody else because many times we hear that the devil has the right to because of this flesh to give us a hit in our life when I was more lost I heard the message through a tape and when I realize that Devil's time has run out I said I am free he has just a little a little bit of time to try to destroy you to try to do the most that he can with you but then his time runs out then he has to let go of you and when I realized that that his time had run out could be free at that moment I struggled enough in my life me the freedom at that time because by faith I accepted it and if the devil so devil your time is over you try to destroy me you try to kill me but your time is over and he has to let you go I don't care the trial that you may be going through doesn't matter how difficult it looks time the devil has gone out to let go of you he no longer has any power over you now all that we have to do is believe accept him and know that you're a child of God that's the most beautiful thing knowing that we are a special family it happens to me the same way when I've gone to Peru I see these brothers it feels as if I've known them from a long time ago have a good time in Fellowship but why because one day we were together one day we were in the thoughts of God and we had fellowship and remember what job says he says where were you when I formed the heavens and this earth and the heavens where were you when the sons of God Rejoice he says the Stars you are stars we are the best just as I said once before God keeps the best for last remember we're in the end time that's why when there is a game that's tied and they go to overtime they put in their best players and here we are it's each one of you this morning so please stand Brothers my go my time has run out great privilege to Trav with our brother and brother get to know each other a little bit more knowing what God is doing with each one of his children they're very special people each child of God is a very special person let's treat each other in the best way let's love one another and that way we can know that that we are sons of him Heavenly Father Here we are this morning you saw this scene even before the foundation of each person that would be seated here this morning you know the heart of each one of your children sometimes I feel unworthy I trust in your word Lord BL it's by your sacrifice it's by what you did not what I do on that day at Calvary you paid the price you defeated the devil and Lord and here we are a group believing each word that has come out the word the mouth of God yes Holy Father I ask this morning that you may help each one of your children whatever they may have whatever need they may have Lord I know that you are [Music] just and you want to give us more than we can ask for bless your people this morning wherever my pastor
