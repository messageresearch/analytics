[12:34] [Music]
[12:50] I greet each and every one of you in the
[12:52] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[12:57] tonight
[13:00] we're happy that you have all been able
[13:01] to come
[13:04] tonight we've come here to receive from
[13:13] God and I also believe just like we've
[13:16] come here expecting God will give us
[13:17] that which what we
[13:19] need let us all
[13:21] [Music]
[13:26] stand we're going to be reading Romans 8
[13:28] verses 16 and
[13:35] [Music]
[13:46] 17 the spirit itself Bears witness with
[13:50] our spirit that we are the children of
[13:51] God and if children then hirs HS of God
[13:55] and join HS with Christ that just
[14:02] pray father we thank you for the
[14:04] revelation of the
[14:08] [Music]
[14:09] word because we possess all
[14:13] things that's what your word tells
[14:16] us and your children believe
[14:19] that they say Amen to the
[14:23] word the only thing that can make us
[14:24] realize
[14:27] that is that Revelation which you have
[14:30] given us in this
[14:33] day Lord for what you're going to do
[14:37] tonight what you have already done and
[14:39] will do
[14:41] tomorrow in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:43] Christ
[14:50] amen tonight I want to entitle the talk
[14:53] HS of
[14:57] God
[15:01] [Music]
[15:05] now before I start I'd like to say that
[15:07] something tremendous wonderful and
[15:08] beautiful is in the air
[15:12] stirring we've heard a lot of the
[15:21] message and we've actually we've already
[15:24] talked about the day that when we will
[15:26] be with the
[15:27] Lord
[15:30] and I believe that that day is drawing
[15:37] close and so happens that so many things
[15:40] are going on around
[15:46] us this makes us think and meditate on
[15:49] God's
[15:55] word and the more we meditate the more
[15:57] we realize who we
[16:02] are we are God's
[16:06] [Music]
[16:10] Hees when we inherit something there's
[16:12] different things that you
[16:17] inherit you might take possession of
[16:23] property for example someone's an owner
[16:26] of a home or territory real estate
[16:30] they write out a will a
[16:37] testament and it says I leave my
[16:40] property to my son or whoever it may
[16:51] be then when that person dies the one
[16:54] that was left those things can take
[16:56] possession of that territory or the real
[17:02] estate and when we see here that we are
[17:07] Hees we can take possession of
[17:14] property there's something else that a
[17:16] person can
[17:19] inherit that's a position of
[17:27] leadership
[17:29] we know that God is the leader the
[17:33] king but if he has made us
[17:40] heirs not only does he give us
[17:42] possession of property but he also gives
[17:44] us a position of
[17:47] leadership and this actually covers a
[17:49] lot of
[17:57] ground because this day that we're
[17:59] living in we have to recognize our
[18:01] position and our
[18:03] [Music]
[18:06] place we are the leaders of this world
[18:09] that we're living
[18:13] in if we recognize that we are
[18:21] heirs another thing that a person can
[18:23] inherit is rank title or
[18:27] office
[18:33] like we said just a moment ago that
[18:35] Jesus is the
[18:42] king and if you have a king then you
[18:44] have a if you have a kingdom then you
[18:45] have a king and one who's
[18:49] reigning and his son is considered as
[18:57] Ace
[19:00] when the king leaves or dies and the son
[19:03] takes his place position rank as
[19:07] king so I see that if we are God's
[19:13] HS we're not just princes but also
[19:19] Kings when we go and see the
[19:27] scripture
[19:28] [Music]
[19:32] there when they brought the Lord Jesus
[19:34] that young boy that was
[19:42] sick so happens here that this man was
[19:45] kneeling down to the Lord Jesus
[19:54] Christ saying Lord have mercy on my son
[19:56] for he is a lunatic and sore Vex for of
[19:59] times he fth Into the Fire and off into
[20:02] the
[20:05] water and I brought him to thy disciples
[20:08] and they could not cure
[20:13] him the scripture says that the Lord
[20:15] Jesus rebuked the devil and DEP parted
[20:17] out of
[20:19] him and the child was cured from that
[20:27] very
[20:29] says in the that the disciples came to
[20:30] Jesus apart and said why could we not
[20:32] cast him
[20:35] out and Jesus said unto him because of
[20:38] your
[20:49] unbelief Jesus answer and said to him
[20:51] because of your unbelief for verily I
[20:52] say unto you if you have faith as a
[20:54] grain of a mustard seed he shall say
[20:56] unto this mountain remove hands to To
[20:58] Yonder place and it shall move and
[21:00] nothing shall be impossible unto
[21:05] you how be it this kind goth not out but
[21:08] by prayer and
[21:13] fasting the Lord Jesus gives us certain
[21:15] Keys
[21:23] Clues I see that the the disciples pray
[21:26] for the young boy that was a lunatic
[21:30] he was demon
[21:34] possessed when this demon took a hold of
[21:37] him it would even throw him in the
[21:39] fire sometimes in water trying to drown
[21:47] him then this man seeing that his son
[21:49] was tormented he brought him to the
[21:53] disciples the disciples prayed for him
[21:55] but couldn't cast The Devil out
[22:04] so this man we see he was not at peace
[22:07] with this he wasn't satisfied with
[22:12] that brought him to the king of King
[22:14] Lord of lords the rabbi the
[22:21] master and when he brought him before
[22:23] the Lord Jesus he knelt
[22:26] down
[22:29] and he said Lord have compassion on me
[22:31] for my son is
[22:36] sick when the Lord heard this he rebuked
[22:39] the
[22:40] devil he he ordered the devil out him
[22:46] out I'm sure the the disciples sure felt
[22:49] bad kind of
[22:53] embarrassed I'm sure they wish the Earth
[22:55] could have swallowed them up open up
[22:57] swallow them
[23:01] because they had prayed for the child
[23:02] and he had not been
[23:07] healed they asked H why was it that it
[23:10] didn't come out when we
[23:13] prayed because of your unbelief said the
[23:22] Lord but then he says but this kind
[23:24] shall not come out except by prayer and
[23:26] fasting
[23:34] other verse he's saying to them that
[23:36] there's certain kind of devils that will
[23:37] not come out unless you are praying and
[23:41] fasting when the Lord Jesus
[23:45] left he sat down at the right hand of of
[23:47] the Majesty of
[23:50] father says the scripture says even a
[23:53] deacon by name of
[23:54] Philip he was no longer he's not an
[23:57] apostle
[23:59] he was just a deacon he went to
[24:05] Samaria is because God had given them an
[24:13] inheritance the Lord Jesus had G give
[24:15] him Authority and told him how to be
[24:16] able to take dominion over
[24:19] devils and with this inheritance and
[24:23] fath Philip went to
[24:26] Samaria
[24:31] the scripture say that when Philip would
[24:34] pray for the people the demons would
[24:36] leave
[24:37] screaming
[24:39] why because they had received an
[24:43] inheritance now we are God's
[24:45] Hees that the Bible
[24:49] says and these signs shall follow them
[24:51] that
[24:54] believe in my name they shall cast out
[24:56] devils
[24:58] that's an
[25:00] inheritance when we talk about
[25:03] inheritance we refering sometimes think
[25:06] just
[25:09] property but inheritance is also
[25:11] position of
[25:14] leadership title and
[25:18] office and I we can also have to have a
[25:21] title rank
[25:26] office because if we are arresting
[25:29] against powers in the
[25:33] air they're not going to powers are not
[25:35] going to obey just any Mickey Mouse
[25:40] guy they're only going to be the one
[25:42] that have a title rank
[25:45] office one has been an heir of
[25:48] God one that recognizes his position and
[25:51] his
[25:53] place that recognizes that there was
[25:55] someone that paid the price
[25:58] you and I did not pay the
[26:01] price the only begotten Son of God paid
[26:04] the
[26:04] price and we're God's
[26:09] HS let's open up our scriptures to see a
[26:12] little
[26:13] bit to what purpose did the Lord Jesus
[26:16] Christ come
[26:19] for I believe that in this
[26:22] day in the day that we're living
[26:26] in
[26:29] I believe the the most precious time
[26:31] that mankind has ever
[26:35] lived and the more that day gets closer
[26:37] the one we're going to leave when we're
[26:39] going to leave this
[26:41] earth the word opens up more and
[26:46] more I've always said and
[26:51] believed that brother bram's
[26:54] Ministry produced twins
[26:59] you believe the same
[27:05] thing but in my viewpoint that I have of
[27:08] these
[27:15] twins I look at the messages that
[27:17] brother Bon brought and I put them into
[27:18] two
[27:26] categories one
[27:28] that inheritance that God left
[27:36] us and the other category is when the
[27:38] prophet would go into the deep things of
[27:41] the
[27:48] message if you hear the tapes all the
[27:50] way through 57
[27:56] 1960 especially 57 58 and
[28:02] 59 when the prophet was traveling
[28:04] throughout different
[28:07] places he preached a
[28:13] message and that one message that he
[28:15] preached was that he preached a living
[28:23] God and and in all his campaigns and
[28:25] services almost he always exced normally
[28:28] the
[28:30] discernment towards the end he hardly
[28:33] practiced
[28:38] discernment once in a while he practiced
[28:40] it exercise it but not in the way that
[28:42] he used to do it in the
[28:45] beginning and many people heard brother
[28:48] Bram in this during this
[28:50] time and they believed brother
[28:55] Bram and they went out throughout all
[28:57] the world World preaching the
[29:00] gospel and to say like this they
[29:02] conquered all the whole
[29:08] world thousands of thousands of people
[29:10] accepted the gospel when these people
[29:11] over conquered the
[29:15] world they weren't taking the doctrine
[29:17] but they were taking a
[29:20] certain that of Jesus Christ being the
[29:23] same yesterday today and
[29:25] forever and that we are God's
[29:30] HS if you like to understand me
[29:33] better osbor like these men like or
[29:36] Roberts
[29:39] and these men were men were inspired by
[29:42] the ministry of brother
[29:43] brand to go and take the
[29:48] gospel and in just one campaign that
[29:50] they would
[29:53] have 120 blind people would receive
[29:56] their sign
[30:02] but someone might say but they didn't
[30:03] accept the
[30:04] message I believe
[30:09] different I believe they accepted the
[30:11] message that brother Bron
[30:16] brought because the message brother
[30:18] Brandon brought has two divisions to two
[30:20] categories
[30:26] part
[30:29] and one of the things is that they
[30:30] exercise by faith the things that God
[30:32] had promised for his
[30:34] people and and they just rooted in there
[30:37] in
[30:42] that and they really have exalted
[30:44] themselves and right now they form that
[30:45] charismatic
[30:47] group but there was another
[30:50] group and that's
[30:55] us and those of us as us that believe
[30:58] the doctrines of this
[31:02] messenger but we actually have doubted
[31:04] the other
[31:08] part we have not believed the other part
[31:10] of brother br's
[31:12] Ministry when our master and
[31:18] Rabbi would stand up and he take power
[31:20] over evil spirits and
[31:25] demons we have stood up and said only
[31:27] brother B could do
[31:29] that when the Bible says that we
[31:32] are of God and join HS with Jesus
[31:37] Christ so
[31:39] there's a there's a portion of brother
[31:43] Mage that we must
[31:46] hearen we must say
[31:48] Amen we must believe
[31:50] it we must exercise it
[31:53] practice it's got a
[31:56] key
[31:57] this demon generation will not come out
[32:01] this be
[32:04] PR has to be a people that are
[32:07] dedicated people that are
[32:09] consecrated people that are surrendered
[32:11] to
[32:12] God a Ministry that are praying and
[32:16] fast just exactly like the Lord Jesus
[32:18] told the
[32:23] disciples this kind will not come out
[32:25] except by prayer and fasting
[32:31] first John
[32:33] 38 I'll tell you the
[32:35] truth I
[32:37] believe if a
[32:40] church does not have signs Miracles and
[32:45] wers they do not completely believe in
[32:51] the the Gans have that in their life
[32:54] their Ministry and their Church
[32:57] and we have only believed a portion a
[32:58] part of the
[33:01] m and what it has produced nothing but a
[33:03] bunch of
[33:04] starch
[33:06] but
[33:11] intellectual actually they don't believe
[33:13] every word that has come out of God's
[33:15] mouth if I want someone's
[33:18] there you're not going to stay without
[33:19] what belongs to
[33:21] me I'm going to grab it out of your
[33:23] hands because and what's
[33:25] ours we have to grab it because it's
[33:29] ours because we are
[33:32] HS first John
[33:37] 38 whosoever is commits sin is the
[33:42] devil now sin is
[33:46] unbelief he that believes
[33:49] not God's
[33:52] promises because the devil has overcome
[33:55] him isn't that right because he that
[33:58] commits sin is the
[34:00] devil for the devil sins from the
[34:05] beginning for this purpose the Son of
[34:07] God was
[34:11] manifested that he might destroy the
[34:14] works of the
[34:15] devil let's repeat it along
[34:20] [Music]
[34:25] together
[34:32] so the devil then has works is that
[34:36] right everything that the devil
[34:39] did all the works that the devil
[34:44] has the Son of God appeared to destroy
[34:48] them break them and throw them out is
[34:52] that
[34:55] right now let's look at Hebrew HEBs 2
[34:58] and verse
[35:01] 14 these are scriptures that we have
[35:03] already
[35:05] read and I'd like to say something to
[35:12] you I know that the majority of us know
[35:14] it by
[35:18] memory but one thing is to know it by
[35:20] memory and the other thing is to
[35:22] understand it to see it believe
[35:25] it
[35:28] and we must repeat it until it's a
[35:31] revelation
[35:46] 24 for as much then as the children are
[35:49] partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[35:51] himself likewise took part of the same
[35:54] that through death he might destroy him
[35:56] that had the power of death that is the
[36:02] devil can you imagine that the devil had
[36:05] a
[36:07] power and that power was of
[36:11] death and he's God has already destroyed
[36:13] that
[36:15] power we as God's
[36:17] children cannot
[36:20] die once
[36:24] again I believe that we as God's
[36:27] children cannot
[36:30] die how many of you believe that you
[36:31] cannot die would you raise your
[36:33] hand
[36:36] notice we have
[36:40] trust that even if they bury us and they
[36:43] cover
[36:44] us completely cover us with dirt and yet
[36:47] we
[36:48] say we're going to rise
[36:54] again but then when there's someone sick
[36:56] amongst
[36:59] us we say well maybe God will heal him
[37:02] maybe God
[37:05] won't do we believe then that we're
[37:07] going to raise rise
[37:09] again what is is
[37:12] easier for you to raise be healed of a
[37:15] sickness or to rais from the
[37:18] dead it's believing in the word
[37:21] believing that we're
[37:25] HS believe that he destroyed the one
[37:28] that had the
[37:31] power why does someone get
[37:34] sick have you ever thought on
[37:37] that why does the sickness come to
[37:40] someone a chronic illness to kill
[37:44] him that's the works of the
[37:48] devil but the Son of God
[37:50] came to destroy the works of the
[37:54] devil if we could just repeat this
[37:57] until it goes down to the heart those
[38:01] works that the devil came to
[38:06] do that was to put sicknesses on the
[38:09] people when the Bible
[38:12] says that if we be God's
[38:15] statute and if we follow God's
[38:18] word the sicknesses and the
[38:20] pl that the
[38:24] worldes will not come n to God's people
[38:28] is that
[38:29] right that's God's
[38:32] word and if the sickness of Duke
[38:36] approach we've been given an
[38:38] inheritance we've been given a position
[38:40] of
[38:43] leadership and if we have a position of
[38:45] leadership we must tell the devil to get
[38:50] away and get away from our brother and
[38:54] say who are you I'm a leader
[38:57] are you
[38:59] leaders if you're an heir then you are a
[39:03] leader let's look at another
[39:07] scripture Colossians
[39:17] [Music]
[39:19] 13 who has delivered us from the power
[39:22] of darkness and has translated us into
[39:25] the kingdom of his dear son
[39:30] we were in
[39:32] darkness without hope without
[39:37] God and the power of darkness really had
[39:40] you in his his
[39:42] clutches we were
[39:44] slaves we were
[39:47] prisoners we were
[39:49] subjects we were puppets of the
[39:55] devil he did with us like he wanted
[39:59] to he did whatever he felt like doing
[40:01] with
[40:02] us but then there was
[40:05] something there was a
[40:07] sacrifice a blood was
[40:09] shed someone paid the
[40:11] price the only begotten Son of God paid
[40:14] the
[40:15] price then he translated us from that
[40:20] Kingdom into another kingdom is that
[40:24] right let us see
[40:26] AP
[40:29] Revelation 1 n and
[40:45] 10 I John who also am your brother and
[40:49] companion in Tribulation and in the
[40:51] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[40:53] in the aisle that is called patmas for
[40:55] the word of God and for the test
[40:56] testimony of Jesus
[41:05] Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[41:07] day and heard behind me a great voice as
[41:10] of a
[41:15] trumpet this uh John was in a deserted
[41:18] kind of a desolate
[41:23] Island he had been exiled to that place
[41:26] because he had been compiling the sacred
[41:30] books that a sudden God
[41:33] came took him out of the
[41:36] island brought him all the way to the
[41:38] Lord's
[41:39] day he was no longer on the island is
[41:43] that
[41:44] right then when he
[41:49] saw oh he could see a preview of what
[41:51] was coming for God's
[41:55] people
[41:57] Bible say he started screaming yelling
[41:59] and just having a great
[42:02] Jubilee seeing when he was seeing those
[42:05] things that was coming for
[42:08] us for those that were going to be
[42:09] living in that golden
[42:15] age when those were going to be living
[42:17] during the time of the restoration of
[42:19] all
[42:22] things when those who going to be here
[42:24] that would hear the voice of the seventh
[42:30] Ang when there would be those here on
[42:32] the earth when there would be a
[42:33] resurrection from among the
[42:38] dead when there would be people here
[42:40] living when the Rapture would take
[42:48] place when he could see those that would
[42:50] be part of the Bride that would be there
[42:52] in the wedding supper of the
[42:53] Lamb he just saw a preview
[42:58] when he was translated or carried
[43:01] forward and we in our
[43:04] day we were in
[43:07] darkness we were in the Cs of the
[43:10] devil but then a message
[43:12] came and took us out of
[43:16] there and brought us into the kingdom of
[43:19] his beloved
[43:23] Son then we saw God's leader for this
[43:25] time
[43:28] and he told us this is
[43:31] yours just like Joshua and Caleb
[43:35] did they went to the promised land and
[43:38] they brought back some of the
[43:44] grapes but there in kadish bar the
[43:46] Judgment see the people did not want to
[43:48] accept
[43:50] that but Joshua and Caleb did accept
[43:55] it they brought back the evidence from
[43:58] that
[44:00] land and all of us have believed and say
[44:03] Amen to all of
[44:05] this and Jesus Christ Our
[44:08] Joshua he was
[44:10] buried he
[44:12] returned and when he presented himself
[44:14] to the
[44:16] disciples they said it can't be
[44:18] Jesus it's a
[44:21] ghost but he said look I'm bringing back
[44:23] the evidence touch my body
[44:26] give me something to
[44:28] eat this is the
[44:30] evidence that I have overcome
[44:32] the that I have
[44:34] power over
[44:37] everything there was the
[44:39] evidence when the disciples saw
[44:42] this they went to the upper
[44:45] room until the their evidence
[44:47] came that same Holy
[44:50] Ghost the great
[44:52] Joshua came to live in
[44:54] them
[45:00] when they went out to see the people
[45:01] that were demon
[45:03] possessed they had the
[45:06] evidence that Jesus Christ lives and
[45:08] Reigns even Peter
[45:11] said I don't have a silver gold I'm just
[45:15] broke I don't have any my
[45:17] check I don't have nothing to buy but
[45:20] one thing I do
[45:21] have the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[45:24] have the evidence he lives and reigns
[45:30] forever then they bound that
[45:33] Jesus they tied them they bound
[45:35] them but then a prophet
[45:38] came and he says I'm bringing the
[45:40] evidence that Jesus Christ Liv that
[45:43] Jesus
[45:45] Christ and he's given the authority to
[45:47] his church to his bride his
[45:50] people do you accept
[45:52] that
[45:54] Ephesians 1 verse
[45:58] three first of
[46:00] all
[46:02] Revelation 4 verse
[46:18] one after this I looked and behold the
[46:21] door was opened in heaven and the first
[46:23] voice which I heard was as it were of a
[46:25] trumpet talking with me which said come
[46:28] up here and I will show thee things
[46:30] which must be
[46:32] Hereafter in other
[46:35] words I believe that there's a message
[46:37] coming and tells us come up
[46:43] hither and live a higher life than the
[46:45] denominational people are
[46:46] living come up
[46:50] hither and live a higher life than the
[46:52] world is living come up here
[46:56] where do we go up to how do we go
[47:00] up I believe I
[47:03] believe the God when he first of all
[47:05] when
[47:07] heend comes first down with a
[47:10] shout and the shout says come up hi come
[47:14] up Elevate take your place sit down
[47:20] where where am I going to sit
[47:23] down he that overcome
[47:27] I will let him sit down with me in my
[47:33] Throne as I also overc came and sat down
[47:35] with my father in his throne come up
[47:38] hither Ephesians
[47:53] 13 blessed be the God and Father of of
[47:55] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[47:57] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[47:59] places in
[48:01] Christ in other words he said come up
[48:07] here I'm going to bless you with all
[48:08] spiritual
[48:11] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[48:14] sit
[48:16] down you have the
[48:18] authority and the judge sat down the
[48:22] books were open if you notice Dan Daniel
[48:26] chapter
[48:28] 7 said the Ancient of Days sat
[48:33] down we know he had a white wig
[48:35] on we know a cloud came
[48:38] down actually a cloud was
[48:41] formed when Seven Angels Came Down a
[48:44] message was given the seals were open
[48:48] come up
[48:50] hither sit down because the judge has
[48:52] already sat down he has the authority
[48:56] no noce my
[48:57] brother
[49:01] we we are the Believers of the message
[49:03] of the last
[49:06] hour but I'm sure that the majority of
[49:09] us if someone was demon
[49:12] possessed we knew that they were demon
[49:15] possessed we wouldn't get close to that
[49:17] demon possessed
[49:20] person the blood of Jesus Christ the
[49:22] blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus
[49:24] Christ we have the
[49:26] power if we're sitting in Heavenly
[49:31] places if we heard have heard a mess of
[49:33] a come up here you're an
[49:39] my you have received what belong to God
[49:43] what was in
[49:45] God the
[49:47] property he took the title
[49:50] D he gave it to the seventh angel and he
[49:53] said here's the plan this is
[49:57] yours claim what's
[49:59] yours that's what we must
[50:02] do let's claim
[50:04] what's don't let the devil take it away
[50:06] from
[50:07] us but claim everything that belongs to
[50:10] us we
[50:12] arees how many of you
[50:19] arees just mark down the scripture so we
[50:21] can save
[50:24] time
[50:29] brother B talks about the Jehovah's
[50:31] seven compound names of
[50:35] redemption and we believe that
[50:38] Jesus Paid the price of
[50:42] Redemption how many of you believe that
[50:45] do you really believe
[50:48] that brother
[50:52] says the seven compound names cannot be
[50:54] separated one from
[50:56] another that they're always tied
[51:00] together so if
[51:03] Jehovah Jehovah the Old Testament was
[51:06] made flesh he went to Calvary he paid
[51:10] the price on
[51:12] Calvary then these seven
[51:14] things are in
[51:17] Jehovah they
[51:19] are because he paid the
[51:23] price Ezekiel
[51:29] 4845 he says there that he is Jehovah
[51:37] sh in other words the Lord is
[51:46] present just like the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:48] says Lord I Am With You Always even to
[51:50] the end of the
[51:51] world doesn't matter he
[51:54] said what problem what problem you might
[51:57] have how dark the thing may
[52:01] look the Lord Jesus is there he's
[52:06] there you must believe
[52:11] that you must believe he is
[52:14] there do you believe
[52:18] that why then a lot of people say well
[52:20] the Lord left
[52:24] me
[52:27] why does the scripture then say though I
[52:29] am with you always even until the end of
[52:31] the
[52:32] world when it's really
[52:34] dark it's really pitched black and
[52:37] heavy seems like there's nothing for
[52:41] us God is right by our
[52:45] side because he is always
[52:50] present judges 623 and
[52:54] 24 Shalom he is Jehovah
[52:59] Shalom the Lord are peace the Lord is
[53:07] peace no one the Lord Jesus said my
[53:10] peace I give unto
[53:18] you notice how that sometimes our house
[53:21] looks instead of being a a human being's
[53:23] home looks like a house for cats and
[53:24] dogs
[53:26] you ever notic
[53:27] that I don't believe there's a home that
[53:30] this doesn't
[53:32] happen someone that might say d is a
[53:39] liar the Lord Jesus tells us that when
[53:41] Once once in his home everything was all
[53:44] troubled in the prophet's home his wife
[53:47] was all nervous
[53:48] troubl and he took her he started
[53:51] praying with
[53:53] her claiming peace and Tranquility for
[53:56] her because Jehovah
[53:59] isace so if we have been
[54:02] redeemed and if Jesus Paid the
[54:06] price there should be peace
[54:11] in sometimes there's no peace because we
[54:13] don't claim what is
[54:14] ours it's our
[54:17] inheritance there must be
[54:21] peace shom there should be peace and if
[54:23] it is we should call Jehovah
[54:26] so you are you are peace come
[54:29] God and bring bring peace to my heart
[54:33] bring peace to my
[54:35] family bring peace to my home he'll do
[54:39] it he paid the
[54:42] price and peace belongs to
[54:45] us it's ours my
[54:49] brother we don't have to be
[54:52] fighting like
[54:54] enemies like cats and
[54:57] dogs we bite each other and some we
[55:02] consume but Redemption has already been
[55:05] paid
[55:07] for we should have the faith and
[55:12] claim if we fight a lot with our
[55:14] wife let's claim peace say here sit down
[55:19] honey let's make make
[55:22] things let's make up and live like
[55:24] brothers
[55:27] peace is ours not fight no
[55:31] Wars not dissensions Schism
[55:35] or he is Jehovah
[55:38] Shalom Psalms
[55:42] 231 that's
[55:47] Jehovah that is the Lord is my
[55:51] shepherd you remember the Lord Jesus
[55:53] said I am the Good Shepherd
[56:01] you know how we sing this little song
[56:03] says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[56:06] want you remember that little
[56:11] chorus sometimes we feel
[56:13] so desolate
[56:16] abandoned but we don't have a
[56:18] pastor and even if we do have a pastor
[56:21] seems like we don't have a
[56:22] pastor I'm by myself with no
[56:27] because he's looking at a flesh
[56:31] body he's not looking at that Jehovah
[56:33] that died on the
[56:34] cross he is
[56:36] our and he never forsakes
[56:38] us he is our
[56:41] pastor he is
[56:44] always doesn't matter what you might
[56:46] need he is
[56:48] your shepher he'll give you what you
[56:51] need and he's right
[56:53] there now when Jesus
[56:56] died he gave you the
[57:00] right for Jehovah to be your
[57:04] Shepherd look there are people in this
[57:06] message that have stopped following the
[57:09] message there people in
[57:12] denomination that stopped serving the
[57:14] lord because the
[57:17] shepherd Pastor Shepherd did something
[57:20] wrong and they said well it's better for
[57:22] me to
[57:23] go but they
[57:26] understood that they are
[57:27] HS and they have a right to that
[57:31] Shepherd to
[57:35] Jehovah because the the sacrifice
[57:38] Redemption has already been given for
[57:41] us whatever you might need from the
[57:43] pastor Jehovah will give it to you
[57:46] because Jesus Paid the he is your
[57:49] shepher and you shall not
[57:52] want Genesis 22
[57:56] 14 Jehovah
[58:00] Gyra the Lord shall provide for himself
[58:03] a
[58:04] sacrifice isn't that
[58:08] tremendous I remember that at one
[58:15] time there's a family uh brother and
[58:18] family was praying because they didn't
[58:20] have any
[58:23] food
[58:26] and they were praying saying Lord we're
[58:27] without food give us some
[58:29] food and the neighbors they heard the
[58:36] prayer they went to the grocery store
[58:38] and bought some bags of groceries and
[58:40] put it there by the
[58:42] door when they open the
[58:44] door they said look what God gave
[58:47] us and the neighbors were just
[58:51] laughing he said don't you know that
[58:52] they don't know that we gave them the
[58:53] food it wasn't
[58:57] God but God has a lot of ways of
[58:59] providing that which what we
[59:02] need
[59:04] sometimes we need
[59:07] something and we don't receive
[59:10] it because we don't claim
[59:14] it sometimes we're looking for a
[59:16] home someone wants a better
[59:21] home let's say they pay $300 or $400 for
[59:24] just nothing but a beat down
[59:26] check and they said well I want a better
[59:29] house but I don't want to pay so much
[59:32] money Lord give me a for me not to be
[59:35] able to spend so much claim it it's
[59:38] yours you're an
[59:42] air I'm sure that God will give you a
[59:44] better home but you have to be you have
[59:48] to claim
[59:49] it remember he paid the
[59:53] price
[59:56] Abraham was up there on the
[59:59] mountain he had walked a three days
[1:00:04] journey out there like in the jungle to
[1:00:06] say it that
[1:00:08] way climbed up the mountain he barely
[1:00:11] got to the
[1:00:15] top he was up there in a very remote
[1:00:19] Mountain he
[1:00:21] says he said they're so high that you
[1:00:23] couldn't see any sheep up
[1:00:28] there because there the Ferocious animal
[1:00:31] the wild animals would eat the
[1:00:34] Sheep but there one of
[1:00:36] two
[1:00:39] Abraham even would Abraham would have
[1:00:41] either killed his
[1:00:46] son or what God would have to give him a
[1:00:49] ram way up at the top of the
[1:00:52] mountain and Abraham said I'm going up
[1:00:55] I'm going up with my
[1:00:57] son and my son and I will both come down
[1:01:01] because
[1:01:03] Jehovah God will provide a ram for
[1:01:06] me God gave it to
[1:01:08] him didn't he AR we children of
[1:01:12] abrah then Jesus Christ pay the price of
[1:01:16] redemption doesn't matter how black they
