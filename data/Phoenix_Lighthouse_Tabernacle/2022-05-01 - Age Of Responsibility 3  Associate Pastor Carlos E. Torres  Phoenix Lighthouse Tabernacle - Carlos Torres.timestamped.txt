[11:08] purge your conscience from death works
[11:11] to serve the living god
[11:18] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[11:20] the new testament
[11:22] that is by means of death
[11:23] for the redemption of transgressions
[11:25] that under the first testament they
[11:28] which are called might receive the
[11:30] promise of eternal inheritance
[11:33] amen amen

[11:40] in the castle
[11:53] [Music]
[12:08] but this

[12:26] calls us things happen
[12:29] things happen
[12:32] amen
[12:35] before continuing i'd like to thank our
[12:37] pastor
[12:39] for the opportunity he gives us this
[12:40] morning
[12:43] he's currently out of town
[12:46] let us keep him in our prayers
[12:49] we were out for a
[12:50] week out of the country
[12:56] and then he continues with the labor
[12:57] that corresponds to him
[13:01] he had to go out of town
[13:05] the again thing we can do is pray for
[13:07] each other
[13:18] every one of the members in the
[13:19] tabernacle
[13:24] every one of them very very special
[13:26] brothers
[13:31] we also extend greetings to the brothers
[13:55] every one of them sends special
[13:56] greetings to every one of you yes
[14:11] [Music]
[14:21] [Music]
[14:40] the same holy spirit that shares this
[14:41] morning never send every one of those
[14:42] places
[15:38] congratulations
[15:49] [Music]
[15:53] month we have a lot of birthdays
[15:56] people may be like to be born in may
[15:58] ivarios
[16:01] we have a couple of birthdays here the
[16:02] month of may
[16:04] i i i hermanos
[16:31] [Music]
[16:34] god has
[16:37] what the word reveals
[16:39] [Music]
[16:45] the revelation of the sacrifice
[16:48] the revelation
[16:52] [Music]
[17:48] what must i do to fulfill the works of
[17:51] god
[17:55] the word tells us to believe on whom he
[17:56] has sent
[18:11] the church age that spirit out of god's
[18:14] mouth
[18:19] god spewed out because of the condition
[18:21] that i was in yes
[18:24] and that's the age that we live in now
[18:53] but this sage is constantly pulling on
[18:55] us
[18:58] to pull us to the condition of the age
[19:02] to the spirit that dominates
[19:07] constantly calling us to involve us
[19:22] it covers
[19:50] leave the spirit of trying to become a
[19:52] victim aside
[19:57] i'm trying to blame others for the
[19:58] condition that we find ourselves in
[20:01] us many times
[20:04] it's my
[20:16] it's his fault because of the condition
[20:17] that i find myself in mentors
[20:24] as long as the person doesn't understand
[20:27] that change is a decision
[20:32] emotional
[20:48] they
[20:50] build a house upon the rock and the
[20:52] other one upon the sand
[20:54] mate
[20:56] according to matthew 7 and luke 6.
[20:58] unafuelaca
[21:15] difference once the store comes where
[21:16] you're built upon the rocker upon the
[21:18] sand
[21:23] to build upon the sand is to build upon
[21:25] the circumstances
[21:30] but to build upon the rockets to build
[21:31] upon the revelation
[21:37] many times we're building upon something
[21:39] and we're we're building upon the past
[21:42] when
[22:02] faith is not based upon the quicksands
[22:05] of
[22:06] thoughts of man
[22:08] that's the reason
[22:09] matthias he says
[22:26] but sometimes we build upon perception
[22:30] when we build upon perceptions
[22:35] we're building upon what i think mi
[22:37] proper interpretation my
[23:20] a spiritual
[23:28] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[23:30] acceptable to god
[23:32] mr corazon established
[23:47] traumas different things and that have
[23:50] built are
[23:51] or the way that we are no
[23:55] we can't build upon that
[24:01] because according to what we saw we
[24:02] needed to dig to get all that out a
[24:05] september sacrificio accepting the
[24:07] sacrifice
[24:12] and to start off building a pond of
[24:14] revelation
[24:16] the characteristics
[24:23] how are we going to build a spiritual
[24:24] house
[24:27] meditation we spoke last time about a
[24:30] prayer and meditation
[24:42] an outstanding teacher once told us
[25:10] you'll be above 90
[25:12] at the
[25:25] not just of this class
[25:40] and repetition
[25:43] to repeat certain things
[25:47] the revelation of what god wants to tell
[25:50] us
[25:54] to write down descriptions
[25:56] write down these things
[26:02] and i challenge you for a month to read
[26:04] the scriptures
[26:06] continue with this principles daily
[26:13] the building of this house will be
[26:15] through all prayer and meditation
[26:21] our spiritual house will grow upon
[26:23] prayer and meditation
[26:26] we can't grow we don't have a plan
[26:35] we don't have a plan we'll just be
[26:37] surviving just going with the floor
[26:41] why is prayer and meditation so
[26:43] important
[26:46] because prayer connects me together
[26:50] meditation
[27:19] now last time we spoke on the scriptures
[27:21] of matthew and mark
[27:23] [Music]
[27:25] estos
[27:29] how was it in matthew 7 7
[27:31] somebody
[27:46] shall receive
[27:56] [Music]
[28:47] [Music]
[28:56] for absolutely
[29:51] for example for example
[30:00] how many would be interested if somebody
[30:02] would tell tomorrow i'll give you 10
[30:04] million dollars
[30:06] nobody
[30:20] in the morning
[30:36] so what's more important your life or
[30:38] the 10 million dollars
[30:46] then we'll see how much our life is
[31:45] solicited
[31:47] supplication is
[31:49] you're trying to apply to solicit
[31:52] something
[31:57] it's a request with an objective
[32:12] it's tied in with that with desperation
[32:18] with desperation
[32:26] your
[32:40] you as a father put yourself in the
[32:41] situation
[32:44] a beggar comes and asks for something
[32:50] now your son comes and begs for
[32:51] something
[32:56] maybe at the beggar you'll give
[32:57] something that you have over
[32:59] hustle
[33:02] but your son you're going to give him
[33:03] something because he's yours
[33:06] because he's your son nosotros
[33:22] as we are
[33:50] supplication with thanksgiving action
[33:54] difference it's the action of
[33:56] thanksgiving that gives us grace
[33:59] generally
[34:03] if i ask for the classes
[34:14] we're going to be thankful after we
[34:16] received it
[34:32] thanking him for
[35:28] our
[36:10] he still was
[36:52] principles
[36:54] he walked putting by practice the
[36:55] principles given by god yes
[37:00] that's what made the promise come to
[37:02] manifestation
[37:04] we prayed
[37:28] [Music]
[37:34] i started
[38:00] because we're changing the way we think
[38:33] [Applause]
[39:26] and
[40:08] is
[40:50] i am the
[41:02] i want to see the glory of god i want to
[41:04] i need to advance
[41:18] my spiritual
[41:49] do according to it all and what is
[41:51] written therein
[41:57] for then thou thou shalt make thy way
[41:59] prosperous and thou shall have great
[42:01] success
[42:04] i'm going to meditate on the word of god
[42:07] i'm going to take up this crisis
[42:14] there are yes
[42:57] the guard wants to use us to produce a
[42:59] change
[43:01] a change in our family
[43:03] i change your home
[43:06] change at work
[43:09] you want someone else's
[43:52] that we find ourselves in asia
[43:55] no apply it spiritually now
[43:58] responsibility we must take up the risk
[44:04] we're going to put by works what
[44:32] for you have not received the spread of
[44:33] bondage against fear
[44:44] and the spirit itself that testimonial
[44:47] spiritual inherit witness with our
[46:25] that we may also be glorified together
[46:28] foreign
[47:22] look at the times
[48:17] [Applause]
[48:28] i don't care what's going on
[48:31] i don't know what's going on
[48:45] is
[48:46] [Applause]
[48:51] [Applause]
[49:16] that the buying formula according to
[49:18] revelations is this are you an event
[49:20] there's an event
[49:23] there's an uh an answer to the event
[49:26] and then we're gonna achieve a result
[50:03] the result isn't going to be positive
[50:04] because my answer would be positive
[50:07] muchas versus many times i problemas
[50:10] there are problems
[50:38] the results
[50:42] the answer that we give to them
[50:45] what's going to affect the result the
[50:46] answer is
[50:48] this is the divine
[51:20] my father my mother
[52:16] decisions based on the word of god
[52:19] amen amen
[52:24] that's the key if we put it by works
[52:30] god will open up the way wherever we're
[52:31] at
[52:33] please stand
[53:07] if the enemy is telling you a lie
[53:09] [Music]
[53:19] and he's trying to tell you that you're
[53:20] sick
[53:22] [Music]
[53:40] because by his stripes we have been
[53:42] healed
[53:46] [Music]
[53:53] if our spiritual health was built upon
[53:56] [Music]
[54:08] fundamentals knock all that down and
[54:10] start from the bottom of the foundation
