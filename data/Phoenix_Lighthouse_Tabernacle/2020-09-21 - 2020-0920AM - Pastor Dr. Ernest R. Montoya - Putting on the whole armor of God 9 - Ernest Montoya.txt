went to marry someone in la paz we had a good time brother casas and then i was off to mexico city mexico for the last two weeks i haven't stopped there's two type of ministers those that marry those that dedicate babies those that perform uh some type of serum ceremony that wars were fought for a cause we will stay with the word of god that's what we treasure yes that should be our foremost what we want to do for god people that we should be grateful this morning that's i have to listen to a tape of brother bernie cheers and the only way i can be energized because this is the great age of deception amen amen so this is what i do i thank god for brother bernie i spoke with him and sister lily yesterday brother bernie and sister lily told me if that isn't true if it's true raise your hands i had a long conversation with brother gomez and i spoke with sister lily certain issues that i needed to clarify and in his older age there's times where he has times he doesn't have to say and what i'm talking about is is is a call so i just wanted to share with you each month and i i need you to hear this question has done a lot for us i need to make sure [Music] as a spiritual father that i see him as periscope i want him to have everything i don't want to see here that he doesn't have this that or the other by phoenix lighthouse to give to brother bernie and sister lily what they do with it is and i know because we i'm dealing with a large population of hispanics and the hispanic families as the father mother of either side they grow older and behested then you take them into your home you help them you protect us hablando here's our father our father that raised us he raised me before i was born again and that's the greatest thing we could do something [Music] second week of each month that's all she had in her pocket is and i want to i want to start off with our first quote we're going to read our first quote this is the ninth message on putting the arm of god god's strategies verse satan's strategies and brother branham said in the greatest battle ever fought his strategy is what disbelieve god's word he's going to do everything in his power get us to disbelieve the word of god [Music] now if you're mad enough you've ever disbelieved i saw people i saw people coming after me i'm atmosphere when i get away from the word of god so how many of us have gotten away from them we've all have that's the greatest tool that we have he can you see the greatest battle ever fought and what is satan's weapon against you equals is well i didn't have time to read my bible and i saw your i've been on my father's business they take up my space so i know what i'm thinking what they're saying have you been around people you can tell what you're thinking but this is what the greatest weapon or the weapon used against you by satan is i want you to show [Music] is so he hits us in different angles let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he can get you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough incredible is is so why do we believe for his word to be completed in your life but it has to be completed his promises how many of you have ever asked him for something we need to [Applause] i become let's stand and we're going to read our scripture then we're going to pray i promise not to take too much time put on the armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil ephesians 6 11. diablo for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore taken to unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day in the evil day and having done all to stand today a blessing for those individuals that are either in silver city reveal your word this morning for our hearts help us pray in the name of the lord amen amen if i go back to uh 12 you can take your seeds uh for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of darkness of this world and this is where i want to put a little emphasis brother um my business is to preach the word and he said america is not the america of yesterday he told us what was going to happen i mean we've known it for how many years 50 years it shouldn't be a shock to us when all of a sudden we read the paper and we see this individual persona his name is trump see i'm a trump i'm glad it's not ernie trump trump but it's donald trump is donald trump worth about eight million dollars more and then our ex-governor was there everybody rudy because of what he was saying and what he's saying is he wants a new law for immigration he that the hispanics they sell drugs i don't know about you but i know what the prophet said in reference to hispanics those are the most humblest people i've ever met what are you gonna believe that's a rapist drug addicts or the most humblest people i've ever seen i don't include myself let me clear your mimi's my ear with just anyone solo identify he's rich [Music] why the queen of the south is not south for the united states to be destroyed i don't care what people believe i believe what the prophet taught us so when i hear stuff like this shouldn't bother you he said it was coming 50 some years ago we read it and we take it personally how many of you are mexicans i'm not so when they talk about me you know that song they can talk about me anyway they please you can talk about me and we shouldn't what we do so just go back to that song high places somebody had to fit somebody had to come together and play this paper thank god it wasn't you now if you don't raise your hand i'm going to give you a real fast one that your parents lied to you know that's why there is ain't gonna bring you anything santa claus won't bring anything no santa you've never heard that if you're not good santa claus is not going to bring you anything for christmas so how many of you got presents from santa claus none of you got presents from santa claus santa claus so then your parents really lied to you they're trying to make you happy feliz brother branham hey man brandon just so you know para question had a christmas because they didn't have sufficient money and giving his kids that opportunity you said never take it away from them so if we're taking it away i have a christmas tree in my house every day 1975 to maybe 1980 i didn't know merry said merry christmas it was never uttered in malachi 4 5. because everybody believed that we should no either about christmas that he wasn't born on christmas and not take it away from our kids giving them a present telling them the truth everybody celebrates christmas we don't believe in santa claus i gave you the present and this is what christmas is all about isn't that so simple how many of us believe in strategies parents you know inadequate so what are we missing god cannot you know that's why i like that young kid i don't know where he's at a very strong some people you don't have to say a just the way you act the way you talk the way you live god will show someone what you are god will vindicate that's what brother branham taught us so we should be insufficient of all we're so insufficient that's what we need that's what i want look yo that's what we all want to be insufficient you know i don't know if you can see this you can see that they he has a cut on his side still fighting on you having in spanish but when i was growing up and we were going to beat up a person young lady a young principle locker but you would tell that person the whole world would know you know somebody like that i mean they know everything my mother once was told by the my mother told me she scratched her head and she knew she was just playing with the lady said wow i didn't know that so she would have told everybody how do you know he landed is if you really look at the spacecraft is there air wind i i hide it oh yeah in the moon then why is that flag doing this i can have something in my hand the last one was getting a spoon full of uh i don't know it was they said chili some chili the hot chili stuff trying to be real custom if you can eat this if you can't you give me can i go are you going to be right you go first no you go first so i'm very sneaky i'm sorry my old age no deception and about that time that was my 50 pesos i was teasing him i didn't want his guest hot chili family how many people followed him or i should say his disciples do you think all his disciples are in heaven they went from paradise they went up or they went yeah that's not the problem my problem is they all denied him though they all left they all betrayed him [Music] don't worry about it turn the other cheek don't take it personally because the person that does it is inspired by a demon amen amen satan's strategies 101. you don't know the strategies i talked about i hope i talked about it six uh two weeks ago four weeks ago so you know what the strategy is again the art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in the war or battle the planet military and if you [Music] because my adversary your adversary our adversary the devil diablo my adversary your adversary walks like and he will cleanse your hands this least satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices not knowing thank you gracias not knowing about it about what how many of you can fly a jet we're ignorant someone how many of us speak french francis maybe one two we're ignorance ignorantess american well we're ignorant amen we should be more ahead than what we are today you okay the reason okay this is what brother branham said perfect strength oh god strategy is to take empty human vessels and shape the world with them it's the same one person or is it saying plural now just a little bit and we'll go oh i don't know what did he do he'd taken them 10 days to get all emptied up in other words i gotta empty myself out or you did this but we have all the light that which is perfect that which is perfect 100 pure word of god and he actually interpreted and that's what we have yeah i heard brother bernie sanders pure unadulterated word of god got that's why i can't stop how many of you believe that gotta believe in something but they were all standing there with their vessels turned up perots how many times we can talk about those mysteries when it comes time you're not going to be filled we're going to be empty vessels if we're not we're always going to wonder why did montoya go why did this too much knowledge not enough oil what do i want this morning i need that oil that's what need of today that's what we need today we need gossip listen brother what i want to do strategy is used by satan how many of you hear voices let me put it this way see if i have it here no i need you to go to slide and then come back to that 18 go to 18. how many of us hear voices how many of you can relate to this man every day how many of you going out to eat come on see listen what he's saying remember we're gonna go have a party yesterday and or are we misinterpreted many of you know that the spanish books are something always wrong with a word that they used no no i mean you know every time i come up with a quote i got to go through it cause in spanish there's some that are wrong just think of all the languages the hillbilly talking he did okay you cannot translate that word and we think we know it all we got a surprise surprise surprise surprise all languages that's why i got to go back to the tape you go back to the tapes eli i think he and your wife need a vacation business where you go on the bias who you hang around with don't worry about that how many of you have heard that come on check her out man check her out you know the message says remember eli you know let's go have a little drink jesus drank wine don't get religious on me eli you know i think you need a new job you're not a mechanic yeah that's a mechanical here you need to go back to school be like trump trump a lot of money don't you want a lot of money yeah see what i voices bosses we trade her in like we traded in the house remember better card do you think you're a minister this is where you failed you know why i left phoenix cybernetics anymore nothing but hypocrites letting you know what you're thinking don't tell me no media i'm from missouri says something about your brothers liar mentee rosa and you're allowing that nonsense it's almost like a game plays a game yes you've been doing them for six thousand years you don't think he's going to do it to you who are you you're not a son of god tell them what [Music] mario matter of fact you're a good teacher you're going places we don't have to do the blade thing i don't want to come to church [Music] i'm
