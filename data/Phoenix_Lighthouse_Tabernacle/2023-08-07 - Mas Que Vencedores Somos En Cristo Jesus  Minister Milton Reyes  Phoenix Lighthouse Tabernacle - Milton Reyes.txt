Romanos they will be reading Romans 8 from 38 39. you can indicate it with an amen when you have it where the Lord [Music] is [Music] behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me evansito is him that overcome it will I grant to say with me and my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches will be going into Romans 8 37. then all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us principals [Music] for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come Jesus or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Lord you may take your sheets brother foreign foreign [Music] we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God and here's where we come together Gather in love with one another as only Christians can love peruaki a monistamous but in here we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost is Among Us yes and we're here and it says to take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are shortcomings we can catch from where we should be or where we ought to be now where we are or where we ought to be is where we ought to be and that's what we study foreign [Music] am I going to overcome my husband to see who can yell more at home am I going to overcome my wife am I going to overcome my co-workers at work or who are we going to overcome and it says in paragraph 62 and how can I overcome the thing you have to overcome is yourself uh [Music] [Music] we can't change it familiares there's trials for families for the wife Al Padre for the father for the son but already has the name for who it's foreign no it's completely different the trial has the test has your name there no one is watching you look at your neighbor he has a different example they put his name and we can switch them because sometimes he's studying a different type of license the messenger says what is it that makes the test for us it's evidence that God is with us that's what a trial is with us and the message the perfect Faith speech in 1963. this is I get spells too you know I get moody I get moody yeah this is sometimes there's weeks where we're flying pretty low uh ideas they're sad days there's a cloudy days and there's bad days the messenger says what gets me is when I get those spells is when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world can you continue saying he says remember I'm not immune to The Temptations If he's not immune then none of us are immune a man amen they say a business uh then when I look back and see something like this I put it right back in his face and say they can say so what about that is that helps me too that helps me to overcome amen [Music] even so you could not put a spot on him with your finger the message Joshua the great lawyer number two a little the messenger continues saying now you got to do something because God doesn't do anything by force you have to believe it you've got to do some fighting I'm going to stop here for a moment he says you have to do something for yourself when we say Lord help us but what am I doing to do my part if I smoke when I buy a pack of cigarettes we say that we're collaborating so we have to do it from the beginning we have to start fighting from them now when we already have what's doing us no good foreign the messenger says many of you have read he said he told them he says what are you doing what are you going to do here [Music] with the power [Music] but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he promised it to me is the next message says be calm and see the salvation of your hope is sorry stand still and see the salvation of the Lord so many times we all get to a place where we can't find it stand still and nervous as I was right now here in the beginning just as we start to do something good then we see trouble coming but that is the devil trying to upset the program of God uh lives in which way God would have you go which is the best way sometimes we want to think with our thoughts for example and we go and we see when you arrive at your home at your house and you open the door and you're about to go inside um and you saw that a rattlesnake snuck into your house you're not going to want to go inside the house so you're certain that that rattlesnake is either dead or outside of your house now we bring it to our minds we can't avoid the bad thoughts we can avoid for them to stay in our minds because without wrestling inside your house I don't think so foreign [Music] just when a little confusion comes in the church and not this church he's talking about another one [Music] you don't run over to one side and pout now I would say pouting or complaining if you are you sure ain't a priest now what is a priest the dictionary says it's an individual who gives a sacrifice to God you should pray through that sacrifices spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name see what I mean Bueno well I just don't feel like taking part in the service I think that's for some of us well I'll bring it to myself sometimes when there's moments where we have to partake in the service of church I believe it happens to many of us in the beginning of our Christian world and for one or another reason we argue with our wife it could be your son or it could be your father you may say I'm not going to go to church anymore how is gay how's this he has nothing to do with it we take it like I'm not going to go anymore the measure continues it says you're a priest making a sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice not giving somebody some hand-me-down as they call it today that's all good I have nothing against it not going to get somebody to come to church that's all good I have nothing against it [Music] but it's you making the spiritual sacrifice the fruits of your lips giving praise to his name sometimes when we argue or disagree um I don't know what happens to you but sometimes it happens to me um we should mend that immediately we should get into account right away the Bible says the Sun not go down without fixing that amen amen well try to respect um foreign [Music] [Music] in the Church of the lingard this morning lays the power to heal all the sickness in the Church of the Living God lays power to overcome our Temptations in the possession of the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away [Music] and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the Church of Jesus Christ in my name and it shall be given unto you amen amen single this is he says you're in that Kingdom by the Holy Ghost baptism sometimes we go all red so many times it's all under the shared blood is Overcomers the ones are Overcomers because you cannot overcome foreign foreign Daniel they threw him in the pit if the Lions ate them you overcame and if they didn't eat yeah he still overcame a man what the Lord gives us say in a testimony he says there came a ship to come to the port this is what the captain says on the speaker is before the next 15 or 20 minutes we're gonna have a very strong storms if we continue the next 15 or 20 minutes on the sea amen glory to God you stick at DNA and the captain says what's wrong with you he said [Music] he says I have a daughter waiting for me at the Port yeah if I get over there I'm gonna see her and I have another daughter in Paradise that passed away then I'll see one of the others amen Brothers [Music] sometimes one as a husband instead of giving good examples sometimes we light up something lights us up in our body when that comes up in your body it's not because you activate it you don't activate it that's automatically for you to get fired up brother says it's like an electric current it's automatically you as your as a wife if you lose your temperature in this control because you just can't because we haven't overcame yet says brother Branham you as a son they correct you yeah and instead of accepting the corrections they tell you three words and you answer back with 20. and at the end you didn't even do one word remember the trials are evidence that God is we have to reach a point where we can say it's no longer that lives but Christ that lives in me can we please stand [Music] if you'd like to lift up your hands usually know what you're struggling I don't know anything but you do know in the news that we have that if we have not overcame all of us that are here we have the opportunity to overcome in Christ Jesus foreign [Music] amen [Music] whereas good job guys [Music] let's see by you your father [Music] is [Music]
