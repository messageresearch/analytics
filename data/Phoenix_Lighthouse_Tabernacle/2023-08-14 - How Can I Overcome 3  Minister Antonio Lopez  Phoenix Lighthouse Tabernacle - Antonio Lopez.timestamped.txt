[28:03] Jesus Christ
[28:05] how many are happy to be here
[28:10] there's bar heads
[28:12] my heavenly father
[28:15] we first thank you for the privilege to
[28:18] be able to be here
[28:19] for your mercy
[28:21] for your sacrifice father
[28:26] we wouldn't be here this evening
[28:29] it's a perfect sacrifice
[28:35] we're indebted to you for the rest of
[28:37] time
[28:39] there is nothing we could do to repay
[28:41] you father
[28:42] but to open our hearts
[28:45] and submit our life to you
[28:49] place all of this in your hands father
[28:52] s when you anoint my lips
[28:55] my interpreter
[29:04] that we may receive what you have
[29:06] prepared for us
[29:07] and be able to apply it in our lives
[29:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:12] amen amen
[29:18] we could please open up our scriptures
[29:22] we'll be going to the Book of John
[29:25] says it'd be chapter 16 verse 33.
[29:32] we can indicate it with an amen once you
[29:34] have it
[29:43] it is I'm going to read
[29:46] is
[29:53] affliction
[29:57] Al Mundo
[29:59] these things have I spoken unto you that
[30:02] in me ye might have peace and the word
[30:04] ye shall have tribulation but be of good
[30:06] cheer I have overcome the world
[30:09] one more scripture Brothers
[30:11] it'll be in the Book of Revelations
[30:16] beat chapter three versiculous we'll be
[30:20] reading verses five and six
[30:31] is a
[30:32] Blancas
[30:37] inaudible
[30:44] either overcometh the same shall be
[30:47] cloth and white Raymond and I will not
[30:49] plot his name out of the book of life
[30:51] but I will confess his name before my
[30:52] father and before his angels
[30:59] let him hear the spirit set unto the
[31:01] churches amen amen you may take your
[31:04] seats Brothers
[31:08] to be here this evening
[31:12] I thank God in my passage for this
[31:15] opportunity
[31:19] it's something that militants
[31:29] because we want to do the will of God in
[31:32] our life man amen you almost hear it
[31:36] we're going to continue on the topic
[31:39] how can I overcome
[31:41] um
[31:48] and I put it as a subtitle having the
[31:50] mind of Christ
[31:55] [Music]
[32:04] it's difficult with traffic
[32:09] but God has given us the strength to be
[32:11] here this evening
[32:13] and he will reward you
[32:16] um
[32:21] I have a few questions I'll be asking as
[32:24] I go along with my thoughts
[32:26] and those questions are for everyone
[32:31] we can't do it like a hot potato
[32:34] we can't just pass it to the side or to
[32:37] the back
[32:39] these questions are for everyone
[32:44] no one can say well maybe it helps more
[32:46] of the other brother
[32:48] we all need it man amen
[32:51] foreign
[33:00] [Music]
[33:21] I need salvation
[33:24] those are all correct amen Brothers
[33:29] [Music]
[33:31] and if you're here it's because you're a
[33:33] son or a daughter of God
[33:36] if you come to church wanting to or not
[33:39] wanting to is
[33:40] you listen to the word of God
[33:45] and I believe that there is no
[33:47] coincidences
[33:48] [Music]
[33:49] because when we listen the word to the
[33:51] word of God is
[33:53] because it is for us
[33:59] it's not just because we're passing by
[34:01] and we happen to catch something
[34:04] if we listen to it it is because it is
[34:06] for us amen amen is
[34:13] in which he touches on this point
[34:17] I've read it before here and it's one of
[34:20] my favorite quotes
[34:25] in the message questions the answers on
[34:27] the seals
[34:32] it says now remember Jesus came to be a
[34:35] witness as a savior of the world
[34:36] correcto is that right
[34:42] well there was just people after people
[34:45] after people after races after people
[34:50] that never even knowed nothing about it
[34:55] went right on just like the world
[34:57] knoweth nothing about it
[35:00] but all the time that was going on the
[35:03] world
[35:06] the largest class was performing all of
[35:08] his miracles
[35:09] [Music]
[35:10] he was walking here on Earth
[35:15] but there was people who still didn't
[35:17] know nothing about it
[35:18] but in other parts of the world
[35:22] they never knew anything about the Lord
[35:24] Jesus
[35:25] and why did that happen
[35:29] okay
[35:31] he says why didn't he let them know
[35:40] he came and the ones that were
[35:42] predestinated to eternal life were the
[35:44] ones that received him
[35:47] there'd be no good to say anything to
[35:50] the rest of them
[35:53] because he would not have redeemed them
[35:57] because they wasn't even redeemable
[36:07] why was it when those priests stood
[36:09] there okay
[36:21] because the predestinator was plotted
[36:23] out in there all around so he had to
[36:25] preached them as a group
[36:27] so what I take from this quote is
[36:32] that we're all listening to the word of
[36:34] God
[36:35] we all know about the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:39] we all know the sacrifice he did for us
[36:43] so it's telling us
[36:45] that we are redeemable
[36:48] that we can receive him
[36:51] it's a decision that we have to take
[36:54] amen amen
[36:57] and another question
[37:02] it's a question that we all ask
[37:04] ourselves
[37:05] do I have the Holy Spirit
[37:08] this is
[37:12] sometimes we think about those things
[37:16] especially after we fails
[37:21] we ask ourselves do I really have the
[37:23] Holy Spirit
[37:25] why do I do these things
[37:28] why do I keep making the same mistakes
[37:33] and many people are individuals
[37:37] they start to criticize themselves
[37:39] they think that they're Hypocrites
[37:43] because they're struggling to overcome
[37:48] sometimes we struggle to get up in the
[37:50] morning foreign
[38:11] [Music]
[38:46] instances
[38:50] so when you're born again
[38:54] you still make mistakes
[38:57] but now it's different when you make
[39:00] those mistakes
[39:02] well now you feel better
[39:04] you know good and wrong
[39:07] you know that there's a better life
[39:09] there's a higher life
[39:13] when we're born again he
[39:17] you know and one is born again
[39:20] you know you were born again
[39:23] because you have that desire to be free
[39:27] you no longer want to be part of that
[39:29] world
[39:31] you know that you continue doing the
[39:33] same things
[39:34] you're going to finish off with just
[39:37] where you started or even worse amen
[39:39] Brothers
[39:41] [Music]
[39:47] at the same time they're battling or
[39:49] struggling praying
[39:58] [Music]
[40:12] you get frustrated because you're making
[40:14] the same mistakes you feel like you're
[40:15] stuck
[40:16] and we want to move forward
[40:19] so many times God has plans
[40:24] God lead us in that place for a good
[40:27] amount of time
[40:29] until we learned that lesson that God
[40:31] has for us
[40:34] God is not just going to give us a trial
[40:38] not just so you have something to do
[40:44] there's always a lesson to learn from
[40:47] that trial
[40:49] [Music]
[40:51] it's something so you can get closer
[40:54] you can continue to grow as a Christian
[40:57] each trial is that is what it's for he
[41:07] [Music]
[41:51] how would you
[41:54] know good from bad
[41:58] so what I want to say brothers
[42:02] um
[42:14] there's another voice there
[42:17] one voice tells you to do good and the
[42:20] other voice
[42:22] you have to make that decision
[42:25] so that voice that tells you to do good
[42:28] is
[42:30] where the holy spirit is
[42:34] maybe you're not completely filled
[42:40] to 100
[42:44] at one time
[42:46] you'll always give you little by little
[42:49] depending
[42:51] depending on how much trust you place in
[42:53] God
[42:54] if God sees that you are growing
[42:59] will give you more and more of the holy
[43:01] spirit amen Brothers
[43:04] e
[43:05] ingalatas and in Galatians
[43:08] uh the CR commonly spiritual
[43:12] this is how the spirit and the flesh are
[43:15] constantly fighting
[43:18] it's in chapter 5 verse 17. he said
[43:25] it says that this the flesh is contrary
[43:28] to the spirit
[43:32] in the spirit is contrary to the flesh
[43:35] so there it tells you
[43:38] when you have the Holy Spirit
[43:41] the holy spirit is going to fight
[43:43] against your own flesh
[43:45] and if you didn't have the Holy Spirit
[43:48] and the flesh would do what it wants to
[43:51] do
[43:52] no one's going to fight against your own
[43:54] flesh
[43:56] that nature that we have originally it's
[43:59] incorrect
[44:01] we need that new birth
[44:05] e
[44:06] e in another question
[44:10] who likes to forgive
[44:13] me as well
[44:17] like our brother says
[44:19] I know
[44:25] foreign
[44:54] many people don't forget because the
[44:57] thing that forgiveness is for the other
[44:58] person
[45:00] that is for the person that Did You
[45:02] Wrong
[45:06] they're going to think that if you
[45:08] forgive them then maybe they were right
[45:13] argument that they won the argument
[45:16] that's not the way it is
[45:23] not to validate what the other person
[45:25] did
[45:26] and it does not make you weak
[45:31] a lot of the world thinks that way
[45:37] if I forgive them they're going to think
[45:39] I'm weak and they can do whatever they
[45:41] want with me that's not the way it is
[45:46] when we forgive Brothers
[45:51] is that I'm willing to cancel out the
[45:53] debt completely
[45:59] not because what the other person did is
[46:01] right
[46:03] but because it makes us free it sets us
[46:06] free
[46:08] and so when we forgive that sets us free
[46:32] when we give that forgiveness
[46:35] it's like a sacrifice
[46:38] there's also a reward when we forgive
[46:42] we receive the forgiveness from God
[46:45] we receive peace thinking
[47:36] so we can have more peace
[47:41] how many are with me Brothers you win
[47:46] and continue to have a couple minutes
[47:48] more
[47:51] um
[47:52] many times Brothers
[47:58] [Music]
[48:05] I was reading a small core small
[48:07] paragraph they had here
[48:09] they have it in a frame of brother
[48:11] Branham
[48:15] its prayer is not necessarily bringing
[48:18] God to the level of man so you know must
[48:20] be in uh
[48:23] but more so it elevates man to the level
[48:25] of God
[48:27] many times we think
[48:32] that let God come it's way too difficult
[48:34] here
[48:36] but no that's not the right way to think
[48:39] we have to leave from here
[48:42] one day we will leave from here
[48:49] we're going to go to a place with him
[48:51] that he has amen Brothers
[49:00] why doesn't God just show me the plan
[49:02] exactly how it is
[49:06] why do we have to have so many Mysteries
[49:13] he only shows me how it ends and that's
[49:15] about it
[49:18] but it tells us everything that we have
[49:21] to go through
[49:22] and we're going to get scared
[49:26] because the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:30] that is
[49:32] the image of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:40] he had to go through many trials
[49:43] everything that we've been tempted by he
[49:46] was tempted by it as well amen Brothers
[49:50] he
[49:54] is
[50:29] [Music]
[50:54] it's all something that's very painful
[50:58] so instead of hanging on to both sides
[51:02] it's better to leave that of the world
[51:05] and go with the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:10] we don't have to go to that process of
[51:12] so much pressure
[51:18] coming to our lives
[51:20] it's much more easy
[51:25] it shouldn't matter to you what the
[51:26] world thinks
[51:30] first of all the world is not thinking
[51:32] about you
[51:34] say yes
[51:38] it doesn't say if you decide to come
[51:40] with us then we're going to treat you
[51:42] better no Hermanos no brother
[51:48] whether you go the good way or the bad
[51:50] way
[51:52] amen Brothers
[51:55] he
[51:58] foreign
[52:58] that's where we're struggling amen
[53:00] Brothers
[53:05] it's something to finish here
[53:11] I don't know if you've heard when an
[53:13] eagle and a crow fight
[53:16] when a crow fights with an eagle
[53:22] it grabs onto the back of an eagle
[53:31] [Music]
[53:33] and what do you think the eagle does
[53:36] Eagle does nothing is
[53:40] very simple what the eagle does
[53:43] the eagle doesn't fight
[53:47] it doesn't waste his energy thinking on
[53:50] the crow no
[53:55] it just does one thing
[53:58] it begins to fly higher Ebola in the
[54:03] higher and higher it flies
[54:04] foreign
[54:54] all right
[54:58] thank you for your attention Brothers
[55:03] whatever you may need ask for it to God
[55:08] this is the time this is the place
[55:11] as I tell you
[55:14] crows will fall off by themselves
[55:17] we have to go to a higher level
[55:22] the crows are not going to fall if you
[55:24] stay there falling on the ground
[55:26] you have to go up higher you have to
[55:28] lift yourself up
[55:31] and God will handle the rest Amen
[55:35] Let Us bow our heads
[55:38] Lord Jesus Christ
[55:41] we want to let you know that we love you
[55:44] we ask you for forgiveness
[55:47] anything that we may have done that has
[55:51] not pleased
[55:52] we ask for forgiveness at this moment
