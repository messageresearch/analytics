[25:12] we're the greatest
[25:26] the cream of the crops were
[25:29] special this morning
[25:39] so that we could be special this morning
[25:43] so that we would honor this day
[25:46] as the day of resurrection no matter how
[25:50] sick we are
[25:53] many troubles there are in our
[26:08] i'm not gonna run this morning
[26:11] i'm going to wait i'm going to anchor
[26:14] myself
[26:14] a young clown the word of god i'm not
[26:17] going to move
[26:19] i'm going to stay there
[26:22] i get
[26:50] the economy is not what it should be in
[26:52] our household
[26:54] that's not a problem
[26:58] what we should do is put
[27:01] all our attention control our mighty
[27:32] when the tribulations come when the
[27:34] storms come
[27:36] don't run stay put
[27:39] don't move forward
[27:43] and pray praise the family or
[27:47] family if you're not married pray as an
[27:50] individual
[27:51] invite your friends christ
[27:55] if no one's around
[27:59] then you pray don't
[28:38] because i need to make sure that my mind
[28:41] is clear
[28:55] everything is cancelled out
[28:59] no doubts can i do this
[29:02] it's just you yes and your creator is
[29:06] whatever you want that in your life
[29:09] i asked god every day to give me
[29:20] and i'll tell ya i never go out on
[29:23] saturdays
[29:24] you know sabados
[29:38] i shouldn't be at so-and-so's house
[29:43] somewhere else i should be home
[29:50] myself for this day
[30:19] and we are the ones we need to pray
[30:23] we are the ones we need to lay hands
[30:27] we're not in the right state of mind
[30:32] there's something wrong that person
[30:34] won't be healed
[30:36] because i didn't prepare myself brother
[30:39] paul used to have a famous saying
[30:42] brother paul garcia garcia junior i'm
[30:45] gonna sanctify
[30:46] myself if i'm the director of music
[30:50] director or the song leader
[30:54] well director i'm going to sanctify
[30:57] myself
[30:58] if i'm the usher if i'm the deacon
[31:01] i'm the person at the door
[31:13] but we don't do that anymore
[31:18] because it's become a routine in our
[31:20] life
[31:22] god is good god forgive me
[31:25] god is a just god god is righteous
[31:28] god is full of grace
[31:55] i gotta prepare myself today
[32:12] he needs to give me to fill me
[32:15] with all his righteousness today
[32:18] boy i will not wait until tomorrow
[32:23] i want it now get away and if i want it
[32:26] now
[32:26] see i am entitled
[32:31] to his blessing
[32:34] to the word love
[32:37] that's mine those are promises to you
[32:41] and i
[32:41] promise you but we have to grab them
[32:48] and not let them go that's a genuine
[32:52] christian christian we're structured
[33:22] line up with
[33:34] it has to be fresh meat
[34:18] god
[34:31] we're going to go to ephesians 6.
[34:36] and
[34:41] starting with verse 11.
[34:47] i'm sorry i um i was hearing the tape of
[34:50] brother bernie
[34:53] he was telling me
[34:56] i hate those wires what upsets me
[35:15] is a window or a glass door
[35:18] or anything that has to deal with glass
[35:25] i'm sorry my cell phone i meant
[35:30] because you know how you do this your
[35:32] computer touchstone computer this you
[35:34] move it like this
[35:38] get all your fingerprints on that you
[35:40] have a lot of
[35:41] oil in your hands
[35:51] so what irritates you something
[35:55] irritates us
[35:58] some people are irritated juan montoya
[35:59] knows enough spanish why doesn't he
[36:01] speak spanish
[36:06] so people are always irritated so that's
[36:09] why
[36:10] we read
[36:14] says put on the whole armor of god that
[36:17] ye may be able to stand
[36:21] against the wiles of the devil
[36:37] if i stand firm
[37:02] we need the whole armor
[37:08] amen verse 12.
[37:11] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[37:15] blood
[37:15] but against principalities
[37:30] against spiritual wickedness
[37:33] in copernadores
[37:49] [Applause]
[38:19] against rulers of darkness of this
[38:22] excuse me
[38:23] rulers of darkness of this world
[38:30] against spiritual wickedness
[38:33] in high places
[38:38] wickedness malicious evil doers yeah
[38:42] high places in los angeles
[38:46] what we need to understand four demons
[38:50] it's always been four
[38:53] four angels of life
[38:57] four angels of death
[39:18] so there's four demon powers that we
[39:22] know of
[39:24] spirits can you say amanda
[39:38] and the more it gets real to us
[39:53] and those spirits are
[40:21] all the armor of god
[40:27] wherefore taken to take unto you the
[40:30] whole armor of god
[40:32] that ye may be able to withstand in the
[40:36] evil day
[40:37] and having done all to stand
[40:42] today
[40:50] remember
[41:04] that's our nature we allow people to
[41:07] push us around
[41:11] pretend you're slapping me okay turn the
[41:14] other cheek
[41:17] there's something wrong with us
[41:22] come and push us around how many of you
[41:25] are being pushed around
[41:28] raise your hand you're either doing it
[41:32] twice
[41:43] stand there for having your loins girt
[41:46] about with the truth and
[41:48] having on the breastplate of
[41:50] righteousness
[41:57] means to fasten it
[42:14] is
[42:23] amen amen
[42:30] and your feet shod with the preparation
[42:32] of the gospel of peace
[42:40] above all take the shield of faith
[42:43] wherewith
[42:44] ye shall be able to quench the fiery
[42:46] darks of the wicked.
[42:55] preparation means
[43:03] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[43:06] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[43:08] god
[43:24] with all prayer and supplication
[43:30] in the spirit
[43:34] there unto with all perseverance and
[43:37] supplication for all the saints
[43:52] you
[44:15] but i can't sleep until after 12
[44:17] midnight but you know
[44:20] so they caught me in a good time
[44:23] but this is where
[44:26] we can cast out whatever is
[44:29] blocking the avenue of your success
[44:34] your walk with christ amen amen
[44:39] the belt of truth
[44:43] when i start looking at this the only
[44:46] thing i can
[44:47] tell myself
[45:01] the problem is today
[45:44] what sets
[46:10] it's holding your trousers
[46:26] belt the woman or the man
[46:31] the man i know on occasions
[46:34] there's dresses that have belts
[46:40] but the reason they have belts
[46:44] is they want to see the waist
[46:52] they want people to notice your waist
[47:07] again we need to make sure we have our
[47:09] belt
[47:12] the true word of god if it's not in the
[47:15] bible in the message
[47:17] be careful what people tell you
[47:22] because today is the day
[47:25] that we are being deceived without even
[47:27] knowing it
[47:32] breast plate of righteousness
[47:36] i need to understand what this
[47:38] breastplate of righteousness
[47:39] is
[47:45] you know i i was going through my slides
[47:47] but
[47:48] i had something different written down
[47:52] so you're going to have to forgive me
[47:54] here
[48:00] breastplate is righteous what is given
[48:03] by god
[48:11] it's not what i give you as being
[48:13] righteous
[48:14] what god has given us is
[48:20] it protects our heart
[48:23] the breast plate protects what
[48:28] your heart is
[48:31] so what happens if i drink a lot of
[48:33] pepsi a lot of coca-cola
[48:35] where are my coke drinkers
[48:38] or pepsi you know don't be ashamed raise
[48:40] your hands
[48:42] gotta be honest i drink coke i only
[48:46] drink
[48:46] coke coca-cola my wife's listening to me
[48:50] i only drink coke if it's in a bottle
[48:55] made in mexico otherwise i'm not gonna
[48:58] drink
[49:00] i want
[49:08] [Music]
[49:12] it's not protecting your heart
[49:27] your blood with the sugars
[50:19] it guards against the attacks
[50:23] who's going to attack you you know what
[50:24] take
[50:27] your brother your sister
[50:31] the bible said put on the whole armor of
[50:33] god
[50:36] wrestle against my brother
[50:43] [Applause]
[50:52] amen we're going to stop right there
[50:58] i wanted to ask you a question
[51:02] if you're in trouble this morning
[51:06] i need to know because many times
[51:10] i have been troubled so much
[51:14] that many times what i need to do i need
[51:17] to stop
[51:18] and look at what the trouble is
[51:34] and all of a sudden god said okay

[52:12] all right so i'm going to show you i'm
[52:13] going to sucker

[53:05] tyson tyson he bit
[53:09] his opponent's ear off
[53:31] [Applause]
[53:40] and he plays with us
[53:46] because he knows what your weakness is
[53:53] and that's what he attacks
[54:07] then i would suggest
[54:21] how many of you are foolish
[54:50] i am not foolish i stay away from that
[54:55] because i know where i'm standing
[55:00] is on god's word

[1:01:04] he says
[1:01:06] what about you
[1:01:13] you know you're getting out of well
[1:01:16] you're not what you used to be when i
[1:01:18] first saw you
[1:01:22] it's bigger than your butt i mean uh
[1:01:24] your your stomach
[1:01:25] proportion wise
[1:01:29] you're still the same person i'm married
[1:01:33] i love you because the word of god says
[1:01:38] jesus is coming for virginia
[1:01:52] amen amen so when you look at your wife
[1:01:56] respect her more respect
[1:02:00] when you're with your wife make sure you
[1:02:02] give her flowers
[1:02:05] she's very fragile make sure
[1:02:08] i say what i say excuse me
[1:02:13] i'm not taking a lot of time but i do
[1:02:15] need to say this
[1:02:25] they go through something called
[1:02:27] menopause
[1:02:31] if you don't think i should say it
[1:03:00] and before you know it you're arguing
[1:03:03] and you don't know why you're arguing
[1:03:06] troubles but you don't know why there's
[1:03:09] trouble
[1:03:10] and the first thing you want to do is
[1:03:13] you
[1:03:14] start
[1:03:18] there used to be a brother in the church
[1:03:22] well i didn't look at him he says what's
[1:03:24] wrong
[1:03:26] no another
[1:03:41] sorry for that type of language
[1:03:45] but there's abuse and homelessness
[1:03:49] and it's no longer the woman being
[1:03:52] abused
[1:03:54] that's why when you look for a
[1:03:56] girlfriend or a wife
[1:03:58] you better know who you're going to
[1:03:59] select
[1:04:01] your right sucker punch
[1:04:09] so what does that have to do with all
[1:04:10] the rice in china
[1:04:15] and by now a husband should know his
[1:04:18] wife
[1:04:20] you know when she's in trouble
[1:04:23] you know what makes
[1:04:35] you know when to give her you give her
[1:04:37] your credit card
[1:04:45] when she's having those problems
[1:04:49] that's when you come to rescue you want
[1:04:52] to avoid
[1:04:52] problems in your home understand that
[1:04:56] your wife
[1:04:57] is fragile let me give you a scenario

[1:06:09] fragile
[1:06:10] instrument that god gave me instruments
