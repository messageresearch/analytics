[35:11] God bless you

[35:14] here in front of you guys on this
[35:16] beautiful evening
[35:19] because he lives

[35:26] [Music]

[36:20] God bless you all it'd be so kind to
[36:22] please open your scriptures
[36:26] will be going to Revelations 3 21.
[36:33] 21
[36:36] we can indicate it in with an amen once
[36:38] you have it
[36:41] in the subject World she'll be covering
[36:43] this evening will be uh how can I
[36:44] overcome
[36:47] in the scripture reads
[36:50] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[36:53] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[36:56] overcame and am sat down with my father
[36:57] in his throne
[37:11] so before I start I'd like to thank my
[37:13] pastor for uh the privilege to be here
[37:15] in front of you
[37:17] um
[37:20] it's a big responsibility
[37:23] but I'm happy I'm happy to be obedient
[37:28] with the topic of how can I overcome
[37:32] or you know the question is that we ask
[37:34] ourselves
[37:35] is how can I overcome or how can I be an
[37:40] overcomer
[37:41] and so a really simple way to think
[37:44] about it is
[37:45] in order for you to be an overcomer
[37:49] you have to have something to overcome
[37:52] and so in thinking of that
[37:55] we thank God for all the trials
[38:04] that we're able to overcome
[38:07] as brother Brandon points out in as he
[38:10] reads the scripture in the message how
[38:12] can I overcome
[38:15] um
[38:17] to him that overcometh he said he says
[38:21] it's it's talk he says he's talking to
[38:22] the individual
[38:24] individual he says if he was talking to
[38:26] the church
[38:28] he would say to she is but he says to
[38:32] him that overcoming
[38:35] and so what does it mean to overcome and
[38:39] said well brother Benham gives us some
[38:40] definitions
[38:42] and most of us we know them now maybe by
[38:44] memory
[38:47] but it gets you repeat them
[38:49] so overcome means to stand the test
[38:53] or it also means to recognize the devil
[38:56] in every one of his tricks
[38:58] so how can I overcome
[39:01] well the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:03] he showed us how to overcome
[39:05] he himself is a perfect example of an
[39:08] overcomer
[39:11] and so in the message how can I overcome
[39:14] I have a quote here from Brother Branham
[39:16] 103.
[39:19] and so he says Jesus told us how to do
[39:22] it
[39:23] he overcome means overcome means to
[39:26] stand the test
[39:27] significance
[39:30] that's right correct like all the same
[39:32] old Saints did
[39:36] Antonio like Jesus did
[39:39] amidst all of his enemies he stood the
[39:42] test
[39:45] everything he was tested against he
[39:48] stood it
[40:46] in the presence of the grave and but
[40:49] essential
[40:51] he overcame the grave
[40:54] and here's the key brother gives us
[40:59] all by the word in humility
[41:04] um
[41:09] he says there's the real man
[41:12] says there's the one to make your
[41:15] example are your style
[41:26] and so here I have the key he gives us
[41:30] so you ask yourself how can I overcome
[41:34] it's by the word in humility
[41:39] and so Jesus is the perfect example of
[41:42] an overcomer
[41:45] and so thinking of examples of
[41:47] Overcomers
[41:49] you know I look to the Bible to many
[41:51] characters who are Overcomers
[41:55] and one of the stories that I was
[41:57] interested
[41:59] is the story of shamgarh
[42:02] you know when you talk about shamgarh to
[42:06] a lot of people he's a very unknown
[42:07] character
[42:09] and sometimes people consider him to be
[42:11] overlooked
[42:13] because I believe he's only mentioned
[42:15] twice in the Bible
[42:20] says it talks about in the days of
[42:23] shamgarh
[42:24] and then judges 331
[42:28] he says it talks about when shamgar
[42:30] delivered Israel and he killed 600
[42:32] Philistines
[42:39] but thank God
[42:41] that we have a prophet who was able to
[42:44] was able to come we know and paying for
[42:47] us a better picture
[42:50] and give us more details and so in the
[42:54] message uh God commissioned Moses and
[42:56] then
[42:59] you know he talks about shamgar and I'd
[43:03] like to go into it
[43:05] you know he talks about in the days of
[43:07] shamgarh
[43:08] you know Israel didn't have a king at
[43:11] the time
[43:12] and so the ones who did whatever they
[43:15] wanted
[43:16] with the Philistines
[43:18] and so he's he reached there on 30.
[43:23] I've seen in the day of Judges a little
[43:25] old fellow named shamgar
[43:31] he says it's found over in the Book of
[43:34] Judges
[43:36] and then and the Philistines would come
[43:38] and take off everything that they had
[43:43] every time they'd raise a crop and the
[43:45] Philistines would come in and get take
[43:47] what they had and take off
[44:02] and these Philistines about about time
[44:05] the Israelites didn't have any kingdom
[44:07] is
[44:10] in just about the time that they'd get
[44:12] their crops all raised and harvest
[44:17] a
[44:19] 31.
[44:23] he said so one it says the Philistines
[44:26] would take and they hadn't go back
[44:31] so pretty much the the Israelites would
[44:34] do all the hard work says
[44:38] and then when it was time to harvest
[44:40] your crops
[44:43] here comes the Philistines and they will
[44:46] take it away from you
[44:57] maybe there's something you worked super
[44:59] hard towards
[45:01] somebody just comes and takes it away
[45:03] from you it's probably a terrible
[45:06] feeling
[45:12] so one day this little old fellow by the
[45:14] name of shamgar still out there
[45:17] [Music]
[45:19] I just like that little guy
[45:23] he was there standing in that in his
[45:25] barn
[45:27] he says well I suppose maybe we'll have
[45:29] enough grain to feed the family this
[45:31] year
[45:40] Trump trump Trump trump
[45:43] this is that up the road
[45:47] you could hear there there came 600
[45:50] Philistines
[45:51] he says all in armor
[45:53] with big Spears they were coming to get
[45:57] his crops
[45:58] he says my after all the Harvest he said
[46:03] he said after all the trying
[46:07] after all the effort and here comes and
[46:11] here comes 600 armed Philistines to take
[46:13] away what he had
[46:17] and he says
[46:23] that he looked over and he saw his old
[46:26] wife
[46:27] wearing a raggedy clothes
[46:31] and she was almost naked and then he
[46:34] looked over at his children and they had
[46:37] you know pale skin
[46:39] they were almost starved to death
[46:42] and so it says and so he thinks is it
[46:46] these Philistines is
[46:48] they're going to come to take what I
[46:49] have
[46:50] tengo and so my family is going to
[46:52] Starved
[46:54] and so Brothers
[46:59] this is not looking here I know I'm not
[47:02] a warrior Guerrero I can't fight
[47:05] and there's 600 men
[47:08] what am I going to do brother says
[47:12] you know pacing back and forth
[47:16] maybe a lot of us do at times
[47:20] I'm going to do this
[47:52] he says everything he had done would be
[47:54] taken off over into that big enemy
[47:56] country there giving away to the enemy
[47:58] is
[48:05] that something happened
[48:07] he says that God began to move on him
[48:11] this is the first thing that happened
[48:14] began to get angry okay
[48:17] he says that he looked around
[48:20] and he says I'm in Israel
[48:23] I'm circumcised soy
[48:26] 33 he says and that's an uncircumcised
[48:30] Philistine coming up there
[48:34] yeah he says I'm not a soldier he says I
[48:38] ain't got time to take lessons
[48:41] and learn how to duel
[48:44] or learn how to fight he says but I tell
[48:48] you
[48:49] God's my God
[48:51] so he just reached there and he got an
[48:53] ox code
[48:55] [Music]
[48:59] you know what an AUX code is
[49:04] an old thing with a brass knob at the
[49:06] end of it is
[50:07] he
[50:12] says not to go and learn how to do it
[50:17] says God is your teacher
[50:20] says hallelujah he says the Holy Ghost
[50:24] will back up God's word every time
[50:30] he says I ain't got time to learn about
[50:32] it
[50:34] he just jumped out there
[50:37] and he knocked down 600 Philistines
[50:41] I mean that's a lot of Philistines
[50:48] they stayed fat that year
[50:52] which means that he succeeded in
[50:54] protecting his crops
[50:58] says amen
[51:00] amen he says if there was ever a time
[51:04] that we ought to stand and defy the
[51:06] devil
[51:09] Diablo he says it's now my brother he
[51:12] says that's right foreign
[51:40] you know he says if you want to talk
[51:42] about something ridiculous
[51:44] he says can you imagine Moses
[51:47] he says you know one beautiful morning
[51:50] he says the suns are rising say the
[51:54] birds are whistling
[51:56] he said Here Comes an old man yeah
[52:09] she's leading a little old meal with a
[52:12] wife
[52:15] with a youngin on each hip he lost
[52:21] he says with a crooked stick in his hand
[52:26] and here he goes and so he says where
[52:30] are you going Moses
[52:32] he says I'm going down to Egypt to take
[52:34] over you said
[52:36] he says it's a one-man Invasion
[52:40] and brother Branham says this is
[52:42] something that impacted me
[52:44] he says you know in that day
[52:47] he said Egypt
[52:50] was like Russia
[52:52] so imagine one man taking over Egypt
[52:58] it's like one man taking over Russia
[53:03] once again that sounds absurd it's a uh
[53:06] but God was with him
[53:09] says he says oh my here and he did
[53:16] he says he certainly did he said he went
[53:20] down
[53:21] and he took over
[53:23] because God was with him
[53:26] and so that leads me to the scripture
[53:28] yes
[53:29] you know Romans 8 31 and Romanos
[53:36] he says what shall we say to these
[53:38] things
[53:40] West
[53:42] if God before us then who can be against
[53:45] us
[53:48] and one we have an old farmer
[53:52] with an Oxford
[53:55] who killed 600 Philistines
[53:58] and over here we have another old man
[54:02] with a Crooked Stick like brother
[54:04] Brandon says
[54:06] who conquered Egypt
[54:09] because God was with them
[54:12] and here I have one of one of my
[54:14] favorite stories too you know it's the
[54:17] story of David you know this whole story
[54:20] can be found you know on first Samuel 17
[54:22] the whole chapter
[54:26] and in the message brother man talks
[54:29] about it as well
[54:32] you know the way he puts it
[54:35] says Goliath came outside
[54:38] he says you know there's no reason why
[54:40] all these men have to die and
[55:03] he says you know if you would ever kill
[55:04] me
[55:05] you know we'll be your servants
[55:08] and so but everybody was too afraid
[55:11] and so you ask yourself why were they
[55:13] afraid
[55:15] well then you read to the chapters
[55:18] you know you hear the description of
[55:20] Goliath
[55:23] so in verse in verse
[55:27] you know it says a champion named
[55:29] Goliath this is
[55:31] um
[55:37] he came out to Philistines camp
[55:44] us
[55:45] it says he was six cubits and they span
[55:49] he said
[55:53] now in the in the message this great
[55:55] warrior David is
[55:59] you know brother Branham says that
[56:01] Goliath is
[56:04] he was nine feet three inches
[56:08] nine feet three inches
[56:10] you know whenever PSI is so now for
[56:14] reference
[56:16] I myself yo I'm about six feet two
[56:20] inches
[56:22] give or take an inch or so
[56:25] um
[56:25] so Goliath was 9-3.
[56:30] so you can imagine he's about three feet
[56:33] above me
[56:35] so he's he's huge enormous so you might
[56:39] say no wonder they were scared of him
[56:42] [Music]
[56:43] and so in verse
[56:46] it gives us more of a description
[56:50] he says he had a bronze helmet on his
[56:53] head is
[57:00] it says of armor of bronze weighing 5
[57:03] 000 shekels
[57:05] [Music]
[57:08] and so I looked around different sources
[57:10] on online
[57:13] in the best conversion I could find is
[57:17] that that's about 125 pounds
[57:22] so he's weighing 120 25 pounds of armor
[57:26] uh yeah
[57:30] in verse six it says that on his legs he
[57:33] wore bronze Greaves foreign
[58:33] somebody else carried a shield for him
[58:37] and so everybody was afraid of him
[58:40] and then
[58:43] excuse me here
[58:45] and so what did he do he said he boasted
[58:49] just like you know just like the devil
[58:52] does
[58:52] like the enemy does he always boasts
[58:57] says in this message
[59:00] you know what he says
[59:02] he gives a he says he likes to boast and
[59:05] carry on like that
[59:07] he says oh he gives a big boast and I
[59:11] said he says sure the enemy when he's
[59:13] got the edge on you it's like oh which
[59:16] one are you 22.
[59:18] just sure the enemy when he's got the
[59:20] edge on you
[59:21] say Let Me Go
[59:25] tennis uh
[59:35] he likes to boast and carry on like that
[59:40] and so he boasts like this
[59:43] for 40 days
[59:45] and then something that I like that
[59:47] brother mentions is
[59:50] that he did it for 40 days
[59:53] and brother Branham says that that's
[59:55] God's number of Temptations
[59:59] He says
[1:00:01] that Moses went to the mountain for 40
[1:00:03] days
[1:00:06] he came back regresso and he was tempted
[1:00:10] he says Jesus went into the Wilderness
[1:00:14] for 40 days and he was dead he was
[1:00:18] tempted he says and it rained for 40
[1:00:21] days he says and so forth yeah so he
[1:00:25] said that 40 is God's number of
[1:00:27] Temptations
[1:00:31] like the enemy does he likes to boast
[1:00:35] says he says he made a big boost
[1:00:41] he says NFL on the ears of the wrong
[1:00:44] fellow he said
[1:00:47] he said so he was boasting but one day
[1:00:54] and David said he says you mean to tell
[1:00:57] me
[1:00:58] that you let that uncircumcised
[1:01:01] Philistine
[1:01:04] stand out there and defy the armies of
[1:01:08] the Living God is
[1:01:14] he says why I'll never stand for that
[1:01:18] and so we all know what happens
[1:01:21] you know he goes and he approaches him
[1:01:27] I don't come with a sword
[1:01:29] he says you come at me with a sword
[1:01:34] with a shield
[1:01:37] he says but I come to you in the name of
[1:01:39] the Lord
[1:01:41] lord of the hosts you know and you can
[1:01:45] see even how confident David was
[1:01:48] because he was trusting in God
[1:01:51] you know he didn't he told him that he
[1:01:53] was he says I'm going to cut your head
[1:01:54] off
[1:01:56] this is not only that he said that he
[1:01:59] was going to throw it in the field
[1:02:00] so that the animals would eat it
[1:02:03] because he was that confident in in God
[1:02:09] and so he we know the story he knocks
[1:02:13] him over and what happens he goes over
[1:02:17] he takes his sword and he cuts his head
[1:02:20] off just like he said he would but then
[1:02:24] what happened after that after he killed
[1:02:26] him
[1:02:28] he says that the Philistines when they
[1:02:30] saw their Champion
[1:02:32] it says that they fled
[1:02:34] in other versions it says that they
[1:02:37] turned around
[1:02:38] Moses
[1:03:10] foreign he says brother every time he
[1:03:13] hollers boo
[1:03:18] it says
[1:03:20] and you jump back
[1:03:24] you'll just keep getting bigger
[1:03:27] he says but when you take God's word
[1:03:31] and you say does say it the lord it's
[1:03:36] written he says he will take his flight
[1:03:39] and he will get littler he said you know
[1:03:43] like brother bam says that there's that
[1:03:45] brother who told him about that dream he
[1:03:46] had he said
[1:03:49] but the little devil was attacking him
[1:03:52] and every time he got back
[1:03:56] in Vegas
[1:03:58] that one day he finally went and started
[1:04:01] fighting back
[1:04:04] it's not the devil started getting his
[1:04:05] literally yeah
[1:04:08] and
[1:04:09] I like to end here on this quote
[1:04:12] terminal and it's from the message this
[1:04:15] great word David next foreign
[1:04:17] [Music]

[1:04:29] what we need tonight is men and women
[1:04:31] who know their position in Jesus Christ
[1:04:38] and when the devil the devil makes his
[1:04:40] big boast
[1:04:43] he says sure he makes his
[1:04:46] he says he's still making his post
[1:04:49] to this day he's still making his
[1:04:55] booster says
[1:05:05] and in that message he says we have a
[1:05:07] whole lot of Davids in here this morning

[1:05:17] so how can we overcome
[1:05:19] well by taking God by his word
[1:05:23] knowing where we stand
[1:05:25] and trusting in God

[1:05:35] he says what's in your hands
[1:05:39] it was an ox code
[1:05:41] for Moses it was a Crooked Stick
[1:05:45] and for David it was the sling but with
