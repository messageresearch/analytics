[31:46] redemption
[31:49] we're gonna focus a little bit on that
[31:50] in a second
[31:52] let us read our scripture
[31:55] hebrews 9 11 reads
[31:58] but christ being a high priest of good
[32:00] things to come
[32:01] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[32:04] not made with hands that is to say not
[32:07] of this building
[32:10] christmas
[32:12] foreign
[32:19] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[32:21] but by his own blood he entered in once
[32:24] in the holy place having obtained
[32:26] eternal redemption for us
[32:37] verse 13
[32:39] for if the blood of bulls and of ghosts
[32:41] and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
[32:43] the unclean
[32:44] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[32:47] flesh
[32:57] how much more shall the blood of christ
[32:59] who through the eternal spirit offered
[33:02] himself without spots of god purge your
[33:05] conscience from the dead works to serve
[33:07] the living god
[33:38] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[33:40] amen amen god bless you brother please
[33:42] thank you
[33:44] again good morning
[33:46] yes
[33:46] um
[33:48] when they
[33:49] asked me to
[33:50] if
[33:51] not when they asked me when they told me
[33:52] that i was going to speak a little bit
[33:55] you know as soon as that i end the phone
[33:57] call
[33:59] right away you know you start battling
[34:00] in your mind
[34:04] we all battle in our minds right
[34:07] some people right now are battling uh
[34:09] physically though
[34:13] we all see the news
[34:15] we all know what's going on
[34:17] we see what's going on in the ukraine
[34:20] we see the news right
[34:22] now
[34:22] we see some horrible images
[34:26] you know we see families having to pick
[34:27] up and and leaving families
[34:32] can you imagine that
[34:35] you gotta just get whatever clothes you
[34:36] can
[34:39] and you're not just gonna get a bus
[34:40] outside their house and go you know
[34:44] some some could have driven out
[35:00] inside the house
[35:03] and these kids got to literally walk
[35:07] for hours
[35:08] day after day
[35:10] to try to make it to the border
[35:12] to be safe
[35:20] and sometimes we see the people
[35:21] migrating from south america over here
[35:25] and uh politics aside
[35:28] i mean i think we're going to do all we
[35:29] can for our children
[35:33] how busy how bad may they be going that
[35:35] they're willing to risk their life to
[35:36] get over here
[35:41] and that's what we see what's going on a
[35:42] little bit in the ukraine
[35:44] we see the people uh
[35:46] leaving being refugees in another
[35:48] country
[35:51] now do you think there's believers in
[35:52] the ukraine
[35:55] absolutely absolutely
[35:56] um you've heard of the app lifeline
[35:58] right
[36:00] the application lifeline it's from the
[36:01] voice of god recordings
[36:05] uh it's on that app in this application
[36:07] it tells you like for example today's
[36:09] the the sixth of march let's
[36:24] you scroll
[36:32] and you can even see the pictures of
[36:33] some of the brothers
[36:36] and right there the the the reporting on
[36:38] there
[36:44] and some of the representatives in
[36:45] holland and poland and romania
[36:51] romania uh orlando that's right and
[36:53] they've been able to help the brethren
[36:56] so i know you're praying for the people
[36:57] in ukraine
[36:59] and it's working brethren yes
[37:01] they're doing the best they can
[37:04] imagine they're there in good spirits
[37:05] trying to get out
[37:15] or my team didn't win on tv am i going
[37:16] to get upset
[37:17] my team didn't win am i going to get it
[37:32] i wanted everybody else's team to lose
[37:34] too if my team lost
[37:48] it's not a big deal anymore thank god
[37:51] because there's worse things hey man
[37:55] brother we're so blessed to be here
[37:56] though
[37:58] we're gathering our sanctuary we're
[37:59] super blessed so we gotta uh i try to
[38:00] tell my daughter and try to show it and
[38:02] not just tell her but
[38:16] redemption so the first time when we
[38:19] started reading about this month ago or
[38:20] maybe longer absolutely longer
[38:24] when we would be reading this
[38:27] i had a little bit of a hard time trying
[38:28] to get it
[38:57] so writing to the hebrews
[39:01] it's the jewish people
[39:03] so speaking to the jewish people
[39:06] he speaks a lot about their customs
[39:09] which we read in the in the old
[39:11] testament
[39:27] and the message the unpardonable sin
[39:30] preached in 1954
[39:34] he says this they say now paul here is
[39:36] speaking in the hebrews
[39:39] was trying to tell the people
[39:42] the approach to god
[39:46] was through the bleeding sacrifice and
[39:48] at the sacrifice
[39:49] sacrifice
[39:51] of the lord jesus christ
[39:53] brother brown says that's how you
[39:55] approach him
[39:57] it's through jesus
[39:59] or he is the lamb
[40:01] that takes away the sin of the world
[40:06] when they brought the lamb
[40:08] they made their offering their sacrifice
[40:11] sacrificio held the lamb
[40:13] they held the lamb
[40:18] while it was squirring
[40:21] well it was shaking
[40:50] you know what the jugular
[41:09] after they had done the sacrifices
[41:12] that's what i'm trying to kind of
[41:13] explain verse 12 a little bit
[41:15] how they sacrificed the the little
[41:17] animals
[41:32] in
[41:33] the same desire to commit uh whatever
[41:36] they were committing
[41:40] whether would they lie too much
[41:42] whether they cheated a lot
[41:44] well there were thieves
[41:50] so then that's what i was trying i
[41:52] wanted to figure that out myself
[41:55] that it was a type query it was a symbol
[41:58] symbol of things to come
[42:07] how much most of the blood of christ
[42:10] through the eternal spirit
[42:13] of himself
[42:26] with our title being the plan of
[42:28] redemption
[42:30] now we all think of we know what a plan
[42:32] is
[42:34] we make plans in life
[42:37] for uh let's say a student is going to
[42:38] college who wants to get a certain
[42:39] degree
[42:41] university
[42:52] do they go to the university or can they
[42:54] go to junior college
[43:10] and right here in hebrews 9.
[43:13] one of the titles it says in here in the
[43:14] bible
[43:16] this is the plan of redemption
[43:19] so this is our plan amen
[43:23] a plan is a
[43:24] a method for achieving an end
[43:28] finale so you make a plan
[43:31] because you want to get to an end
[43:33] let's say we're going to take a trip to
[43:34] mexico
[43:36] you know what highway you got to take
[43:38] you know
[43:53] so so what we have here look at that
[43:56] this is our plan we got to keep that in
[43:57] mind
[43:59] now we go to the word redemption
[44:02] the act or process
[44:05] or an instance
[44:09] so redeeming comes the word redeemed
[44:15] it's to buy back yes
[44:17] if you're buying back
[44:19] it was already yours
[44:22] because you're redeeming it you're
[44:23] taking back it's yours
[44:31] you left it there
[44:33] but you're gonna go back and get it
[44:49] to release from blame or death
[44:58] to be free from the consequences of sin
[45:01] liberal consequences
[45:03] it's a change for better de cambiaras
[45:05] to remove the obligation of by payment
[45:08] obligation
[45:12] so this is the plan it has a plan
[45:15] to make things good paracetamol right
[45:18] the plan has been given to you and me el
[45:19] planas
[45:21] now it's going to be up to us if we want
[45:23] to follow it
[45:26] again right here
[45:28] what paul is telling us
[45:41] [Applause]
[45:45] sacrificio that's that's that's what
[45:47] that's
[45:48] that's the symbol of what it was
[45:51] but then we get down a little bit lower
[45:52] here
[45:55] how much more the blood of jesus christ
[45:59] and what's he talking about
[46:01] what the lord jesus christ did for us at
[46:03] the cross
[46:06] what do you do with the cross of
[46:06] calories
[46:08] he was there in our state
[46:11] he paid our price
[46:22] sometimes uh they say well what is what
[46:24] is it truly about
[46:39] during this plan we have
[46:46] sometimes we say man i know how to get
[46:47] to that uh i know how to get to south
[46:49] mountain
[46:51] but they're shortcuts i don't got to go
[46:52] through all this traffic they're
[46:54] shortcuts
[47:06] our journey
[47:22] but we want to do it our way
[47:25] i want to take a shortcut i mean
[47:27] i'm doing that shortcut
[47:29] sometimes i mean going by a cliff
[47:34] a cliff that's called uh uh forgive me
[47:36] brother maybe be called depression
[47:39] well i think i can't make it anymore
[47:42] because i wanted to get to my certain
[47:43] destination
[47:44] but i try to go my own way
[47:47] i didn't go the way that i was told to
[47:48] go
[47:50] during
[48:03] i can't handle uh my
[48:17] when i'm about to jump off that cliff
[48:46] i
[48:58] different ones of course different
[49:00] we
[49:10] some of us have lost children
[49:13] some of us have lost our parents
[49:28] god knew what you were going to go
[49:29] through
[49:31] he was building that character
[49:34] because he knew because he knew when you
[49:35] went through that
[49:38] trying to jump off the cliff
[49:42] that brother
[49:55] we gotta work in teams
[50:37] you're not supposed to be up there what
[50:40] am i going to do brother can we just set
[50:41] him up
[50:42] i'm trying to be obedient
[50:44] i want to do the best i can
[50:46] i'm trying to follow this plan
[50:49] brethren i've been on cliffs many times
[50:52] i've tried to take my shortcuts
[51:22] and during this planet calls us to
[51:23] believe yes
[51:25] okay it's so easy only believe right we
[51:27] sing about it all the time
[51:30] but do we really do it
[51:33] i remember i was reading on brother
[51:35] branham
[51:36] when he was younger
[51:38] he had a stomach issue at one time
[51:42] he couldn't eat
[51:44] the doctors i told him you can't eat
[51:45] anymore you're not gonna do it
[51:48] brother
[52:52] i need you here at a certain time
[52:56] why do i gotta listen to them
[52:58] i'm my own man
[53:12] but we know
[53:13] something's stopping us
[53:14] and thank god for that
[53:16] sometimes when you want to do something
[53:19] and you know something's in your head
[53:20] then you shouldn't do it
[53:22] thank god for that
[53:24] you got those breaks
[53:26] my dad
[53:39] another part of the plan here
[53:53] you got to forgive yourself
[53:56] we've all gone through ups and downs
[53:58] that we said
[54:00] maybe last week we're going through it
[54:04] and we just
[54:05] we beat ourselves up
[54:36] these are fights that we all gotta deal
[54:37] with
[54:39] the things we gotta forgive ourselves
[54:42] and forgive others
[54:44] sometimes we may go years old
[54:46] thinking about what somebody did to us
[54:51] and we love them
[54:52] but we just can't believe they did that
[54:56] they heard us so much
[54:58] and they act like nothing happened
[55:02] we're the ones that are living with that
[55:04] notre dame
[55:14] see this body here
[55:17] when abraham was told to get out of that
[55:18] country
[55:28] of preaching of the lord jesus christ
[55:46] he just
[56:58] you want to be redeemed
[56:59] i want to be redeemed
[57:01] but we got to take actions for we got to
[57:04] be uh responsible for our own actions
[57:08] i can tell you this for two or three
[57:10] hours
[57:22] you must say brother albert why are you
[57:23] even saying this
[58:06] so we want to follow these plants
[58:09] brethren we have to we have to go by the
[58:11] rules
[58:12] tell us to go to the to the highway of
[58:14] forgiveness
[58:19] we gotta go there and forgive
[58:48] he can tell me about it
[58:50] he can teach me about it
[58:52] but he has most of his life
[58:54] but it's going to be up to me
[58:57] it's going to be up to you
[58:59] and then our children
[59:00] reach a certain age
[59:31] and then we give them the example in
[59:33] every aspect of our life
[59:36] right at the house
[59:37] we want them to keep their room clean
[59:40] we got to keep our room clean ourselves
[59:45] that's what you do it brethren
[59:47] our actions speak louder than our words
[59:52] if we want to reach our goal
[59:55] it takes a plan
[59:57] plan with that plan
[1:00:12] maybe right
[1:00:39] i can't talk to you about something i
[1:00:40] don't know about the problem
[1:00:42] i like to work in teams
[1:00:44] i like to watch teams
[1:00:46] everybody has to do their part
[1:00:49] everyone in here plays their part
[1:00:51] everyone in here brother

[1:02:02] hey albert how come uh you don't talk
[1:02:03] like this or talk like that okay
[1:02:06] sometimes you do i might just see but
[1:02:08] not all the time
[1:02:09] and i'm just telling you and then you
[1:02:11] that's
[1:02:12] that's when you got him right there
[1:02:14] because they're asking questions
[1:02:16] is that because of you
[1:02:18] it's because god is
[1:02:27] god
[1:02:35] god bless each and every one of you
[1:02:38] you know yesterday i went to visit uh
