TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we greet each and every one of you this morning in the beautiful name of our lord jesus christ [Music] romanos right now we're speaking on the subject of the manifestation of the sons of god romans ocho romans chapter eight [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god it is lord we ask you this morning that you may open up their eyes that you are saying you're you have sons you have the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] this is the third message now on the manifestation of the sons of god as we have considered this subject we have seen some details that are but most important to us sometimes i speak so slow and such sometimes an insufficient manner that i really have a struggle to get into my thoughts [Music] we have read and seen here in the scripture that the word of god tells us that we are heirs of god how many of you believe this morning i want to just touch on a little bit that thought that we're heirs of ranks the majority of us already know thanos you have trained us for such a long time now now give us father our ranks [Laughter] when we hit something like that tremendous thing people ask us ask me and say that did he really know what he was saying or excellence see a degree rank is a degree or position of dignity eminence or excellence and we all of us have to receive our rank that is a degree position of dignity eminence or excellence we are not worms i want you to notice that we do are involved we have seen how we were told oh god give us our ranks how many you would like to receive your rank that is your place i've done my duty for today someone that really [Music] i don't really don't know how to say in spanish other than just to say that it's irresistible when you take these words to bear an excess amount of fruit how is it that someone coming to god be with there with god come to them and say to him god give us an excess the only way i can give you something is question as a human being i'm just as human as you are i ask myself how can a person ask because he's saying now lordo now that we have a lot of farmers here um he has seen a tree when it's really overbearing i've seen it in california where the branches have a lot of fruits they bend over there's like crutches they put on crutches so they won't bend all the way over so that the branch will not break so remember that we are branches you find a tree in that condition it's a very fruitful tree [Music] that's what [Music] [Music] men and women god through the messenger [Music] [Music] overpowered we have to see the meaning of each word and how it takes off in its own way the minion over to subject to bring uh under subjection and and that's just to put on your yoke give me my rights and that's to bring under a yoke dominion hola how could it be possible to force them to become subjects if you would open up your bibles with me to genesis maybe in the next few messages on this subject we'll have a better way of writing on the meanings of these words i would like to go back to the beginning if you open up your bible with me to genesis 1 27. so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them the earth god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and even though they're all in the same sentence they all each mean something different the primary cause is to be able to bring to the surface these words which means to bear fruit so when it makes you say the word they're fruitful that we produce fruit and the word question comes because through this because of the rejection is is give [Music] let's look at saint john james chapter 15. quebec i know that uh with this thing that to be fruitful was just to have children to bear fruit or offspring yeah do you love god uh i am the true vine and my father is a husbandman every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away and every branch that bears fruit he purges it that it may bring forth much fruit so in order jesus christ the lord is saying this way i am the mind my father is the husband and we here are the branches is that right so like in order like the branches what bears a fruit he said that every branch that did not bear fruit he would take away and that every branch that did bear fruit he would purge it that would bring much more fruit if a branch does not have fruit that branches cut off it's placed off to one side is [Music] one thing those orange trees on here when they were not pruned when they were not purged [Music] when the dry branches were not but has been fulfilled be just like the rest of the world what matters is the heart behave like you want to do what you want to do but a message came oh i'm is as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except abide in the vine no more can ye accept eve abide in me so that's easy to understand isn't it if someone doesn't have any fruits me we want is if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned their judgment is coming right now they might weather it in circles they might be tried but the time constant as well to be burned off verse 7 says and and it shall be done unto you it shall be done possibly if we cry a lot or pray a lot it will be done if we are in him and he is see the people that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples isn't that beautiful and then that way we'll be his disciples romans chapter 7. the subject that i'm taking is a manifestation of the sons of god and i believe that i'm speaking apart to a part of that group that many of you who romans chapter 7. romans 7 1 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives for the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband lives she'll be married to another she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man pablo paul is a very wise is presenting marriage is she [Music] by the body of christ that ye should be married to another establish he's talking about death in other words to make it clear paul is saying like this until the first one dies because if you mirror before the other one the first one dies adulterers is that right that is even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god in other words unto death i want you to allow for that first husband to die and if you wanted take him lord fellows is is but sometimes we you know in the natural we pray lord take my old man here he just he's worthless he doesn't support me anymore with a nice full check of three hundred dollars hold both she was happy but why don't they ask god for the old man take him lord [Music] now let's look at it [Music] [Applause] so [Music] you
