[0:04] they'll probably be driving down after
[0:06] after the lunch
[0:12] tonight and then we will some of them
[0:16] from way down I hope you stay
[0:23] over and what rooms we got is open to
[0:28] you
[0:31] and then Wednesday night we'll continue
[0:35] on on the study and then the Lord
[0:38] willing next Sunday
[0:46] again and
[0:47] Thena begins on the
[0:51] six so all that's got your vacations
[0:55] plan we're expecting a great wonderful
[0:59] time amen at
[1:06] Thea that's where we always have such a
[1:09] marvelous
[1:14] time not to bigger crowds we run
[1:18] sometimes it'll hold up to about I
[1:20] suppose we could put 10,000 in it
[1:28] easy but usually last year I think we
[1:32] had around about
[1:33] 7,000 something like
[1:39] that that was a packed out place but
[1:43] there's plenty of room to
[1:47] stand and seats that they could run all
[1:49] the way
[1:53] out and uh so we are looking forward to
[1:58] that
[2:00] and glad to see many of our Minister
[2:03] Brothers
[2:08] in can't never think of his name here
[2:10] the missionary brother
[2:16] Humes sister Humes is that you sitting
[2:20] right here the little ones we're glad to
[2:22] have them a
[2:28] missionary
[2:30] other ones brother Pat
[2:34] brother dton and all just so many
[2:44] brother brothers just a few moments
[2:50] ago it be kind of hard to call them
[2:55] all but we're very happy to have you in
[2:58] the house of the Lord
[3:05] tonight this great precious brother
[3:08] Neville sitting behind me here to pray
[3:10] with me while we are going to teach the
[3:18] word Charlie glad to see you and sister
[3:21] Nelly Here Tonight the little
[3:28] ones
[3:32] this is in Bible teaching is usually a
[3:39] very yes brother Welch I just was
[3:42] looking for you I see you sitting back
[3:44] there
[3:52] now Bible teaching is usually a little
[3:56] treacherous a little you know kind of
[3:59] walking out on the thin eyes we call
[4:09] it but we just feel that maybe at this
[4:15] point and at this time it might be good
[4:18] to kindly bring the the church to what I
[4:23] think to uh uh
[4:26] complete uh understanding positionally
[4:29] of what we are in Christ
[4:47] Jesus and sometimes I think that
[4:49] preaching is a wonderful thing but I
[4:53] believe sometimes brother beer that
[4:56] teaching goes beyond that amen and
[5:00] kindly especially to the
[5:12] church now preaching usually catches The
[5:16] Sinner brings him under condemnation by
[5:19] the
[5:26] word but teaching places the and
[5:30] positionally what he
[5:36] is and we can never rightly be able to
[5:42] have faith until positionally we know
[5:45] what we
[5:52] are now if the United States of this
[5:56] Fair land here sent me over to Russia as
[6:01] an
[6:02] ambassador of this nation to
[6:12] Russia then if they have officially sent
[6:16] me to Russia all the power that the
[6:20] United States has is behind
[6:28] me
[6:30] my word is just the same as in United
[6:33] States if I have been recognized as an
[6:46] AM and then if God has sent us to be his
[6:54] ambassadors all the power that's in
[6:57] heaven all that God
[7:01] is all of his angels and all of his
[7:05] power stands behind our words if we are
[7:10] correctly an
[7:12] ordained sent Messengers to the
[7:27] people God has to honor
[7:29] the
[7:32] word for he has so solemnly
[7:36] written that whatever you bind on Earth
[7:40] that will I bind in
[7:48] heaven whatever you loose on Earth that
[7:51] will I loose in
[7:58] heaven I give unto thee the keys to the
[8:04] kingdom all such great promises he's
[8:07] given the
[8:13] church and I am after the other day if
[8:17] many of you supposed to share this
[8:19] morning to hear as I tried to in my
[8:24] humble simple way to explain the the
[8:28] vision
[8:29] that I saw of
[8:45] Heaven I Would by no means ever try to
[8:49] doubt anything that anyone ever told me
[8:51] that God told
[8:58] them
[8:59] I believe it even if I didn't see it in
[9:02] the scripture I would still uh want to
[9:05] believe that brother's
[9:13] word I might just stay right along with
[9:16] the
[9:18] Bible but still I would believe it maybe
[9:21] brother just misunderstood it some way
[9:24] that he might have just got it mixed up
[9:26] a
[9:28] little
[9:36] and still I would believe he he' to be
[9:38] my
[9:42] brother and if there's anything that
[9:45] burns within my
[9:46] heart and I hope it never leaves in my
[9:49] years to come that I'll never forget
[9:53] what happened last Sunday morning as a
[9:58] week
[10:08] it has done something to me that's
[10:11] revolutionized my
[10:16] life I I do not fear I I have not one
[10:21] fear of
[10:26] death death has no fear at
[10:31] all and it it doesn't for you if you
[10:35] just
[10:40] understood now maybe if you'd have to
[10:44] have the experience to know it because
[10:47] there's no way to explain
[10:53] it you cannot find words because it
[10:57] doesn't l in the English uh
[11:02] dictionary or no other
[11:11] dictionary because it's in an
[11:15] eternity no yesterday no tomorrow it's
[11:19] all present
[11:27] tense
[11:29] and it's no uh I feel pretty good in an
[11:33] hour from now I don't feel so well and
[11:35] another hour feel good
[11:44] again tense all the
[11:51] time never ceas just that
[11:55] glorious
[11:57] peace something
[12:03] and there can be no sin there could be
[12:05] no jealousy there could be no sickness
[12:08] there there could be nothing ever reach
[12:10] that Heavenly
[12:22] Shore and if I may have the privilege of
[12:26] saying this which may be I do
[12:33] not if I do not then I pray God forgive
[12:40] me but if I have the privilege and it
[12:43] was that God let me be caught
[12:47] up to see something I would refer to the
[12:51] first
[12:57] heavens
[13:02] and then I believe one in the Bible by
[13:04] the name I believe it was Paul that was
[13:07] caught up into the third
[13:18] heavens and if it was this glorious in
[13:21] the first Heavens what does that third
[13:24] Heavens
[13:27] hold you see
[13:33] no wonder he couldn't speak of it for 14
[13:40] years he said he did not know whether he
[13:43] was in body or out of
[13:50] body with that great Apostle not to
[13:54] share his his his office or not to try
[13:58] try to make ourselves anything like he
[14:11] was but I can say with him I don't know
[14:14] whether was in this body or out of the
[14:21] body only thing it was just as real as
[14:25] I'm looking at
[14:27] you
[14:32] and I've always wondered about if IID
[14:35] passed by I'd see a little Cloud
[14:38] floating by a spirit and say there goes
[14:41] brother and sister that's Charlie and
[14:44] Nelly that's brother and sister Spencer
[14:47] going
[14:57] there
[15:02] that always puzzled
[15:05] me if my eyes is in the
[15:09] grave
[15:11] decaying
[15:17] rottening if my ears is not here to hear
[15:23] anymore and if my blood is all gone back
[15:28] in the been bombed it and it's in the
[15:30] waters or in the
[15:32] [Music]
[15:38] ground and my mental faculties my brain
[15:42] cells are all
[15:48] gone then how would I be any more than
[15:51] just a spirit floating
[15:57] around
[15:59] that wearied
[16:01] me how would I like to say hello brother
[16:05] Pat oh so glad to see
[16:13] you hello brother nille I would like to
[16:17] see
[16:19] you but I thought well if I don't have
[16:22] anything to see with any mouth to speak
[16:26] with it's rotten it's
[16:36] dust how would I be able to say hello
[16:39] brother Pat hello brother Neville or so
[16:41] forth hi
[16:49] Charlie but now I know that that's
[16:55] wrong hard is written in the scriptures
[16:58] which I say it's not
[17:04] contrary for if this Earthly Tabernacle
[17:08] be
[17:09] designed we have one already
[17:19] waiting another Tabernacle that has eyes
[17:24] ears lips mental faculty
[17:34] if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[17:39] dissolv it has a body that can feel can
[17:47] talk and now it comes to me just now
[17:50] that Moses had been dead and in an in
[17:54] unmarked grave for 800 years yeah
[18:06] and Elisha had went to heaven 500 years
[18:13] before but on Mount Transfiguration they
[18:16] were found talking with
[18:27] Jesus
[18:29] after Samuel had been dead for at least
[18:33] three to five years and the witch ofor
[18:37] called him
[18:44] up and she fell on her face and she said
[18:48] you have deceived me
[18:50] because you are sa
[18:57] yourself
[18:59] she said because I see Gods she was a
[19:03] heathen you see I see Gods rising
[19:14] up and Saul couldn't see him yet and he
[19:17] said what does he look like describe him
[19:21] to
[19:26] me said he's th
[19:28] and he has a mantle over his
[19:34] shoulder said that Samuel the prophet
[19:38] bring him here before
[19:44] me and I want you to notice that Samuel
[19:47] had not lost any of his
[19:49] [Music]
[19:53] personality he was still a
[19:56] prophet he told told Saul exactly what
[20:00] would happen the next
[20:08] day so you see death does
[20:12] not completely diminish us as we weep
[20:16] and whail and lament at the
[20:26] grave it only changes our Dwelling
[20:33] Place it takes us from a place
[20:37] to what is
[20:41] age if I live one more hour I'll outli a
[20:45] many 16y old
[20:48] person I'll out live a many fivey old
[20:57] person
[21:02] age is
[21:05] nothing we're just set here for a
[21:08] purpose to do
[21:14] something well now many of these
[21:17] little pretty face mothers sitting here
[21:21] some of them 60 70 years old would say
[21:24] what have I done brother
[21:27] Brandon
[21:37] you've raised your
[21:38] children you've done what you were
[21:41] supposed to
[21:46] do maybe some old dad sitting here say
[21:49] well I've hired the fields I've done
[21:51] this I never
[21:57] preach
[21:59] but you did just what God sent for you
[22:02] to
[22:05] do there's a place for
[22:10] you speaking to an old doctor yesterday
[22:13] one of my doctor friends
[22:17] buddies 80 something years
[22:26] old
[22:30] and his
[22:33] sister-in-law is here at the church
[22:36] tonight and she's been just a tle teeny
[22:39] bit worried about
[22:46] it I went to
[22:50] see as soon as I began to talk to him he
[22:53] brightened up told me about a hunting
[22:56] trip he taken many years ago in Colorado
[22:58] in the very same
[23:09] country just as brilliant
[23:14] bright and I said Doctor how long You'
[23:16] been
[23:20] practicing he said when you were
[23:25] nursing and way down I said a many a
[23:28] time he said I've practiced taking my
[23:31] buggy I put my saddle bags over my
[23:43] horse I took the little
[23:46] satchel and I've
[23:50] walked and I said yes down along the
[23:52] creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with
[23:54] your flashlight trying to find the house
[23:57] where little child had tummy acre mother
[24:00] labor
[24:12] pains that's
[24:17] right I said you know doctor I believe
[24:20] across this dividing line here between
[24:23] Mortal and immortality God has a place
[24:26] for good old doctors serve like
[24:40] that great tears come in his eyes he
[24:43] started crying he reached up his feeble
[24:45] hands and said brother I hope
[24:55] so across the line
[25:00] God judges a man's
[25:02] Soul what he
[25:08] is then I give him this satisfying
[25:15] scripture many times flying through
[25:18] those dark muddy fields at night trying
[25:20] to help
[25:26] somebody
[25:29] maybe never get a penny for it but it's
[25:31] all
[25:36] right I said Jesus said in the
[25:39] scripture blessed are the merciful for
[25:43] they shall obtain
[25:55] mercy and that is true
[26:00] tonight we want to set the church in
[26:02] these three lessons if God
[26:06] permits how and what to look to what we
[26:17] are we're going to begin at the first
[26:20] chapter of the book of Paul's letter to
[26:26] Ephesus
[26:31] and we're going to take the three first
[26:34] chapters in our next three studies
[26:36] trying to get a chapter evening if we
[26:47] can tonight Wednesday and next Sunday
[26:55] morning Ephesians first
[27:00] chapter
[27:02] now as we study together I'd like to say
[27:07] this that this book of
[27:10] Ephesians perfectly
[27:13] parallels the Old Testament
[27:26] joshu
[27:29] Ephesians the book of
[27:32] Ephesians now remember if we happen to
[27:35] get just a little off to your teaching
[27:38] just forgive us and bear with us a
[27:50] while we open it let's ask him to help
[27:54] us as we bow our
[27:56] heads
[28:01] Lord we are
[28:03] approaching th holy and sacred
[28:09] RIT which it is more secure than all the
[28:13] heavens and
[28:22] earth are we reading this word called
[28:26] the Bible that
[28:28] both Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[28:31] my word shall never
[28:44] fail then upon this solemn hour that I
[28:49] come to this pit tonight before the
[28:52] purchase of your
[28:56] blood
[29:00] these precious darling
[29:04] marles that set sh tonight grasping for
[29:08] every little hope that they can hold on
[29:12] for that life that is to
[29:25] come May It Be so sufficient tonight
[29:29] that every believer here will see his
[29:36] position and everyone who has not yet
[29:39] come into this Great Fellowship will

[29:45] door until the keeper opens the
[29:56] door

[30:05] Bible is of no private
[30:15] interpretation God forbid that I your
[30:18] servant or any other servant would ever
[30:20] try to put their own interpretation to
[30:23] the

[1:14:23] let us speak a little bit on the
[1:14:25] word let us give it a
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:30] title over what we've been speaking
[1:14:33] on the challenge of the present
[1:14:37] hour there's a challenge for the hour
[1:14:40] which we're
[1:14:45] leading we as looking at the image we
[1:14:47] can tell that the challenge is for a
[1:14:48] certain
[1:14:49] time without having to read any
[1:14:52] Scripture
[1:14:55] you can understand what the Bible says
[1:14:57] when Jesus is knocking on the
[1:14:59] door I am at the door and I
[1:15:06] call we know seeing that and mentioning
[1:15:08] that we can tell what age we're living
[1:15:12] in First Corinthians 13 verse
[1:15:15] 11 says when I was a
[1:15:18] child I spake as a child I understood as
[1:15:22] a child I thought as a
[1:15:25] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:15:29] childish and now we see by a
[1:15:32] mirror
[1:15:35] dark when we see face to
[1:15:41] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:15:43] know even as also I am we know in
[1:15:49] part we see a bit
[1:15:52] dark the glass where there is a
[1:15:56] reflection and in that glass there's a
[1:15:58] reflection of an
[1:16:00] image and the image that is being
[1:16:04] seen it's the image projecting of he
[1:16:07] who's in front of the
[1:16:10] mirror what are we looking at when we
[1:16:12] stand in front of a
[1:16:14] mirror in front of the mirror of the
[1:16:17] word we see
[1:16:22] darkly
[1:16:24] but there will come a time when we will
[1:16:26] know ourselves then as we were
[1:16:29] known because what is in part will be
[1:16:31] taken
[1:16:34] away we know
[1:16:37] another we have to reach the
[1:16:40] complete the complete
[1:16:44] Revelation to see the image
[1:16:47] C which has been projected in that
[1:16:49] mirror or that
[1:16:52] glass
[1:16:56] brother Bram says in the message calling
[1:16:58] Jesus to the
[1:17:10] scene so there was a storm on now God
[1:17:13] created the winds God created the air
[1:17:15] God created the water it's all his
[1:17:17] creation he made it but you
[1:17:22] see
[1:17:26] it was the devil that got into it and
[1:17:28] whipped it up that's what causes trouble
[1:17:30] is the
[1:17:33] devil and now if he is the Creator and
[1:17:36] made it thus in the
[1:17:43] beginning shouldn't those disciples know
[1:17:46] that that Creator laying right there
[1:17:47] could make it
[1:17:51] stop you say how can I be sure of it
[1:17:56] though brother Bram if I could just be
[1:18:02] sure then call him to confirm his
[1:18:07] word making Hebrews 138
[1:18:13] right then the doubts and fear will
[1:18:15] cease just like the winds
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:19] did them old winds going through your
[1:18:21] mind
[1:18:27] maybe I won't get it maybe it won't be
[1:18:29] me maybe he won't do
[1:18:31] this don't there ain't no maybe to it he
[1:18:35] promised
[1:18:37] it that takes all the May out of
[1:18:41] it wake
[1:18:43] Jesus call him on the
[1:18:46] scene are you scared to do
[1:18:51] it are you afraid to to take God's
[1:18:55] challenge here brother Bram is giving
[1:18:59] us he telling us we're afraid to take
[1:19:02] God's challenge it's a
[1:19:05] question are we afraid to take God's
[1:19:08] challenge when
[1:19:10] elij was he he was before the
[1:19:14] prophets he was
[1:19:17] challenging he says if Jehovah is God
[1:19:20] Ser but if Je
[1:19:24] if B is God then
[1:19:27] serve Why are you jumping back and forth
[1:19:29] between two different
[1:19:30] thoughts serve him focus
[1:19:33] on he was giving
[1:19:36] challeng it was a challenge he had given
[1:19:38] at that hour who will you
[1:19:42] serve he made a challenge to God that
[1:19:46] responds God response with fire that is
[1:19:49] the true
[1:19:50] God now in this time
[1:19:54] brother bam is telling
[1:19:57] us are we afraid to take God's
[1:20:01] challenge he begins to describe the
[1:20:06] scene when they entered the boat and got
[1:20:09] and and the storm came and shook
[1:20:12] them the storm came and try to finish
[1:20:16] them brother says God
[1:20:18] created but the Devil Comes
[1:20:21] anded try to finish those
[1:20:25] disciples then Jesus was
[1:20:27] there he was in the but he
[1:20:31] was they began to cry out they began to
[1:20:36] scream he says Wake Jesus up he says
[1:20:39] Wake Jesus
[1:20:42] up are you afraid to take God's
[1:20:47] challenge the time that we're living
[1:20:49] what is
[1:20:51] it what is the challenge we have before
[1:20:54] us what is the
[1:20:59] challenge brother Bram tells us the
[1:21:01] condition or the diagnosis of the
[1:21:06] age we understand the age of L is the
[1:21:09] last
[1:21:12] age it's the darkest
[1:21:16] age it's the most evil
[1:21:21] age worst of the ages since the
[1:21:24] beginning of
[1:21:26] time but it's an age of much
[1:21:31] abundance how odd that in this age of
[1:21:33] progress and
[1:21:36] abundance How can there be
[1:21:39] proof it's truly
[1:21:43] strange it's an age of abundance and
[1:21:48] opportunity when we have so much and
[1:21:50] there is so much more to gain
[1:21:54] and all the inventions that do our job
[1:21:56] for
[1:21:58] us many things to give us have fun and
[1:22:01] give us
[1:22:05] pleasure we find mental sicknesses
[1:22:07] taking over
[1:22:10] people to to the point where the nation
[1:22:13] is
[1:22:19] alarmed they should all be happy and
[1:22:20] truly have nothing to be sad for
[1:22:22] [Music]
[1:22:26] and many take sedatives at night to go
[1:22:28] to
[1:22:31] sleep and in the morning they wake up
[1:22:33] they take medicine to boost their
[1:22:35] emotion uh
[1:22:38] energy they're running with frequency to
[1:22:40] the
[1:22:41] doctors they're going into mental
[1:22:47] institutions with alcohol they try to
[1:22:48] drown the fears that they don't even
[1:22:51] understand
[1:22:54] this age grafts on to having a great
[1:22:56] abundance of
[1:22:58] things but people are less
[1:23:02] happy they respond to spiritual
[1:23:06] accomplishments but people have less
[1:23:08] trust and
[1:23:11] confidence they grasp on to ver moral
[1:23:15] values and it's the most corrupt of any
[1:23:17] other age since the beginning of the
[1:23:21] flood
[1:23:23] in this age we talk about knowledge and
[1:23:27] science but it's losing that battle on
[1:23:29] all
[1:23:31] ends because the mind and the human
[1:23:37] Spirit cannot understand or comprehend
[1:23:40] the changes that have come upon the
[1:23:44] Earth in just one generation we Advanced
[1:23:47] so
[1:23:49] much from the time of the horse and
[1:23:51] buggy to the time in space
[1:23:53] and this gives us a lot of
[1:23:56] Pride but within is a dark empty
[1:24:02] Cavern that is crying out in torment
[1:24:04] without knowing
[1:24:06] why man is failing because of
[1:24:10] fear and the man the world is so
[1:24:15] dark that they could well be called the
[1:24:17] age of
[1:24:20] neurotics this age could be called the
[1:24:22] age of
[1:24:25] neurotics we're in the age of the
[1:24:29] neurotics that's an anointing that's
[1:24:31] going
[1:24:32] around that's trying to take hold of
[1:24:35] people to turn them into
[1:24:39] neurotics they don't respect
[1:24:42] age they don't respect social
[1:24:46] position you don't respect how many
[1:24:47] years you have in
[1:24:50] church you're born the message or if you
[1:24:52] wen't burn
[1:24:55] message respect whether you went to
[1:24:56] church or you didn't go to
[1:24:58] church it will attack you with
[1:25:01] everything with the purpose to destroy
[1:25:05] you the neurotic
[1:25:08] age when neoism and
[1:25:14] depression where stress anxiety are
[1:25:17] taking control of people's mind with
[1:25:21] Rebellion esting more than
[1:25:25] ever everyone claiming their
[1:25:29] rights that's what makes the age of
[1:25:32] L that's what it means what this age
[1:25:36] means the people's
[1:25:39] rights is claiming their
[1:25:41] rights but when a
[1:25:44] person begins to
[1:25:47] Rebel at the same time they begin to
[1:25:49] lose their
[1:25:51] identity
[1:25:52] when somebody claims their
[1:25:55] rights that the age of is
[1:26:01] offering people claiming the rights of
[1:26:03] being able to identify however they want
[1:26:05] to
[1:26:07] identify it's no longer just man or
[1:26:13] woman each time that someone Rebels they
[1:26:16] lose their
[1:26:17] identity when the people of
[1:26:21] Israel they began on their Journey to
[1:26:23] the promised
[1:26:26] land they began to rebel against
[1:26:29] Goden
[1:26:32] amen yes
[1:26:34] brother but they never complained with
[1:26:38] God they rebelled against
[1:26:41] God but they were complain against
[1:26:44] Moses they were complain with
[1:26:49] Moses but the effect of that was that
[1:26:51] they were rebelling against
[1:26:54] in rebelling they were losing their
[1:26:57] identity the right to the promis it
[1:27:02] was for rebelling against the servant of
[1:27:05] God the man that God has been
[1:27:08] us take them to the promised
[1:27:11] land there is no
[1:27:14] way that we can't in the time serve
[1:27:18] God and detach God from the there is no
[1:27:21] way
[1:27:23] God sent a powerful
[1:27:25] prophet and that's the problem with many
[1:27:28] people they rebel against
[1:27:31] God but they don't Rebel
[1:27:35] directly but they're rejecting what the
[1:27:37] prophet has
[1:27:40] spoken now the prophet gave a challenge
[1:27:44] in this
[1:27:45] age and the challenge was always
[1:27:51] simple
[1:27:52] in the message it is I preached in
[1:27:58] 1960 now any of you I challenge
[1:28:02] you I challenge your
[1:28:06] faith in Christ's name anywhere to
[1:28:09] believe
[1:28:12] it it says in the message hear ye
[1:28:17] him I challenge you Faith to believe
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:22] now brother bam is telling is that he
[1:28:24] challenges us to have
[1:28:25] faith but what is Faith it's
[1:28:31] Revelation other
[1:28:33] words I challenge you to have that
[1:28:37] Revelation I challenge
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:42] you he says take any Divine Pro
[1:28:45] promise listen to
[1:28:49] this anything that you you can make this
[1:28:53] stat it's on recordings everything but I
[1:28:56] say
[1:28:57] this and challenge
[1:29:01] anybody the right mental
[1:29:05] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:29:08] this
[1:29:09] word will bring it to
[1:29:12] pass regardless of what it
[1:29:15] is so he's giving us a challenge to
[1:29:19] believe to have faith in the age which
[1:29:22] we
[1:29:24] live where nervousness is
[1:29:28] over where depression is overpowering
[1:29:31] people where stress is
[1:29:34] overpowering where Rebellion is
[1:29:36] overpowering
[1:29:39] people where anxiety is overpowering the
[1:29:41] minds of
[1:29:43] people where people are committing
[1:29:46] suicide they no longer want to face the
[1:29:49] problems of
[1:29:50] life
[1:29:53] at this time the challenge is for each
[1:29:54] one of
[1:29:55] us the challenge is can you
[1:29:58] believe not
[1:30:05] halfway
[1:30:08] we if he is
[1:30:11] god Jehovah is God then serve
[1:30:13] him the
[1:30:17] prophet stands in
[1:30:18] the US to
[1:30:20] believe challeng us to have fa it tells
[1:30:25] us that we have the right mental
[1:30:28] attitude towards any Divine promise from
[1:30:33] God God will bring it to
[1:30:36] pass but the problem is that nervousness
[1:30:40] depression stress fear
[1:30:44] anxiety it takes our
[1:30:48] mind don't have time to meditate in the
[1:30:50] word of God
[1:30:55] the revelation of the day where
[1:30:57] weing we're so
[1:31:00] preoccupied in the purpose of this age
[1:31:03] is to send us to send us to a
[1:31:06] corner to turn us into
[1:31:10] neurotics into
[1:31:14] neurotics now there's people that act
[1:31:16] like
[1:31:20] neurotics but there is a
[1:31:25] process the one that starts to act like
[1:31:27] a
[1:31:30] neurotic they become sick and then they
[1:31:32] become a neurotic and if that
[1:31:38] advances he gets
[1:31:41] worse and
[1:31:46] worse until he completely loses his
[1:31:50] identity
[1:31:55] Prophet says the
[1:31:57] following he's challenging us he's
[1:32:00] giving us a
[1:32:03] challenge how many can
[1:32:06] believe but then he goes a bit to open
[1:32:09] up the
[1:32:17] Revelation and he says a greater witness
[1:32:19] in Greater witness preached 1953
[1:32:24] he says I want to ask you
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:31] something will you obey me as his
[1:32:46] servant says now just as a servant not
[1:32:49] as obey I don't mean that but you'll
[1:32:51] obey what he says through
[1:32:58] me now I'm going to challenge every one
[1:33:00] of you
[1:33:04] tonight they sing up in the nights here
[1:33:06] in in this
[1:33:12] meeting but if you could just take my
[1:33:18] advice there would not be one feeble
[1:33:21] person left Among
[1:33:24] Us he's first giving us the challenge
[1:33:28] to he says if you can believe
[1:33:33] me there would be no feeble person with
[1:33:39] us in the message why are people so
[1:33:42] tossed about each in
[1:33:45] 1956 he say now you might not be able to
[1:33:48] understand
[1:33:50] it you might not be be able to get
[1:33:52] it but I challenge your
[1:33:55] faith you come and
[1:33:57] believe what I have told
[1:33:59] you and watch what
[1:34:02] happen you just believe what's been
[1:34:05] told and see what
[1:34:08] happened now the prophet's giving us an
[1:34:10] even greater
[1:34:12] challenge he's not just saying can we
[1:34:16] believe now he's saying if you can
[1:34:17] believe
[1:34:19] me that's a greater challenge
[1:34:23] the most difficult thing is for one man
[1:34:25] to believe
[1:34:27] another he says if you believe me there
[1:34:29] will be no feeble
[1:34:31] person if you believe what I
[1:34:33] tell there be no no sick person among
[1:34:39] us and that's the key for the time we
[1:34:41] are living
[1:34:44] in that we can believe Christ Jesus the
[1:34:47] word God made
[1:34:49] flesh God in human
[1:34:54] God in his perfect
[1:34:57] condescendence God Jesus Christ made
[1:35:00] flesh he came and said sent a
[1:35:03] powerful gave us the message of the
[1:35:07] hour he gave us a message to wake up to
[1:35:12] reality he gave us a powerful
[1:35:16] Apostle who spoke to us the exact same
[1:35:19] things that the prophet
[1:35:20] spoke
[1:35:23] he came and gave us and managed to place
[1:35:24] Us in the body of
[1:35:26] Christ he's positioning us with a
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:33] pastor the deity of God
[1:35:36] made that's the challenge of
[1:35:39] the can we believe God made
[1:35:43] flesh can we believe God in human
[1:35:45] flesh because that's the
[1:35:48] key to be able to have our spiritual
[1:35:50] success
[1:35:52] to be able to see God in
[1:35:54] human respect God in human
[1:35:56] flesh God see God in our
[1:36:01] midst when he speaks to us through our
[1:36:03] pastor and be able to see that that is
[1:36:06] the advice that we
[1:36:09] need says you could take my
[1:36:13] advice you could just listen to what
[1:36:15] I why would the
[1:36:19] prophet because I'm listening directly
[1:36:23] and I'm giving you what you
[1:36:25] need and that's the
[1:36:28] C if I could just you could just listen
[1:36:30] to what I give you the advice
[1:36:34] that because I'm taking it
[1:36:36] directly from the perfect condescendence
[1:36:39] of God of the word of God from one
[1:36:43] prophetic
[1:36:48] Apostolic brings us the perfect placing
[1:36:50] in the body of of
[1:36:54] Christ how many can accept
[1:36:58] it that is the challenge of the present
[1:37:02] hour being able to hear that advice
[1:37:04] through human
[1:37:07] lips that is the challenge believe
[1:37:11] believe have faith have revelation of
[1:37:15] who God is what is his program what is
[1:37:18] his
[1:37:19] plan and what is my in
[1:37:22] that recognize who's next to me kn who's
[1:37:25] my
[1:37:26] comp see God in human
[1:37:31] flesh so next
[1:37:33] time I'm greeting
[1:37:36] God I G him
[1:37:38] here we might give him a right hook to
[1:37:42] oh
[1:37:44] man when we look at it that
[1:37:49] way we'll respect one another
[1:37:54] more we're going to be careful what we
[1:37:56] say about our
[1:37:58] brothers we're going to be careful we're
[1:38:01] going to love each
[1:38:06] other brother says doesn't matter all
[1:38:08] the
[1:38:10] gift what I desire is the
[1:38:12] love reflected in each one that is the
[1:38:15] greatest thing why is it the
[1:38:18] greatest when he went beyond that Cur of
[1:38:20] time
[1:38:22] he
[1:38:23] said he said be
[1:38:27] assured because anything that's not
[1:38:28] perfect love
[1:38:31] canot only I can go in is the perfect
[1:38:35] love I love God if I hate my brother how
[1:38:39] can I say I serve God I can't serve my
[1:38:42] brother I can't do something good for
[1:38:46] him that's the revelation of
[1:38:49] the can we accept the CH
[1:38:54] Cheng be
[1:38:56] to in our and when we do
[1:39:02] that open up a blessings for
[1:39:05] you healing comes to
[1:39:11] you because you're ffing
[1:39:14] the been established for your
[1:39:17] operation that's the
[1:39:18] key we have to go the presence of
[1:39:23] God Beyond
[1:39:27] flesh when God when Jesus saw a
[1:39:29] Samaritan
[1:39:30] woman see a lost
[1:39:33] woman see an ill woman the
[1:39:37] prophet he saw
[1:39:41] representation a pure woman without
[1:39:44] SP when Jesus made contact with the
[1:39:46] spirit of that
[1:39:48] woman he began to bring it
[1:39:51] what she really was and
[1:39:55] then begin to project a
[1:39:57] vision when the woman re the
[1:40:01] Revelation who the Messiah was the
[1:40:06] vision in the present
[1:40:09] time no longer

[1:40:36] fall no longer had to be
[1:40:39] enslaved go to a certain place to
[1:40:42] worship now the going
[1:40:46] Spirit be truly free the messah was on
[1:40:52] Earth she receives that
[1:40:55] revelation of who
[1:40:59] truly maned in this Dimension time that
[1:41:03] is why we need to
[1:41:05] understand the deity
[1:41:07] God God walking God speaking to us when
[1:41:12] we can see

[1:45:08] later
[1:45:12] okay okay this again
[1:45:17] Sor When God says he has a promise for
[1:45:19] us when we begin to pray we begin to cry
[1:45:26] out we can see that the
[1:45:29] promise we just have
[1:45:31] to get out
[1:45:33] of knowing that God
[1:45:40] has answered my
[1:45:42] pray because your
[1:45:45] promise because your word is
[1:45:48] true to me and I will answer
[1:45:51] I know that you will answer I know that
[1:45:53] you will give
[1:45:54] me what I ask for is I claim thank you
[1:46:00] Lord when you begin to give thanks even
[1:46:03] though you don't have
[1:46:05] it that's the
[1:46:07] beginning give
[1:46:09] thanks in his
[1:46:11] presence and says if you got your into
[1:46:16] the that which you are asking
[1:46:19] for
[1:46:21] you give a p
[1:46:24] another the promise is maned before your
[1:46:29] eyes you want to combat
[1:46:32] Rebellion practice
[1:46:36] humility according to Matthew
[1:46:44] 26 let this cup passing
[1:46:47] by will he want to go he didn't want to
[1:46:51] have to
[1:46:53] die he subjected himself to what
[1:46:56] the word said that he had to
[1:47:00] be that we can have
[1:47:05] salvation he
[1:47:08] for and he became the redeeming
[1:47:11] L when you have your
[1:47:14] rights can complain all you
[1:47:16] want re all you
[1:47:19] want
[1:47:21] you forfeit your rights and say I'll
[1:47:22] surrender to the words you become a
[1:47:26] lamb and
[1:47:29] remember when John was in
[1:47:32] Revelation the only that could open up
[1:47:34] the seals was the
[1:47:36] lamb you have to turn into a
[1:47:40] lamb so that the dove can guide
[1:47:43] you will guide the
[1:47:46] lamb and then where will it guide it to
[1:47:49] to the slaughter
[1:47:51] to die to
[1:47:53] himself and when you can do
[1:47:56] that then you turn
[1:47:58] into that will give life
[1:48:00] to will sacrifice your for sacrifice
