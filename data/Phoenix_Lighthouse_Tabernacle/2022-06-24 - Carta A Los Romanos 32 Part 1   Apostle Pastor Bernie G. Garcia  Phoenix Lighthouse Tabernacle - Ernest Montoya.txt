TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so me [Music] [Music] please [Music] [Music] so [Music] hmm hey [Music] hey [Music] hey [Music] ah [Music] name of our lord jesus christ [Music] verses 12 through 16. [Music] for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are the are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the in the law these having not the law are allah unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or excusing one another in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel now let's read first corinthians 3 chapter 12 verse 3 first corinthians fall 3. foreign [Music] wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calls jesus a curse and not no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost [Music] gracias the hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled someone might be in bondage lord may they be set free and those that have been separated did they rise up a little higher than theirs they stretch out their wings when a pillar for every good and perfect gift comes down let's sing a song spanish [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] right [Music] is [Music] thank you welcome brother it is a pleasure to have the young man brother john jonathan and alan it's a pleasure to have in the lord we're studying here and the subject that we've taken is a letter to the romans and the subtitle that this message has is your conscience and the day of judgment this is the fourth message on that uh like to speak on this morning is concerning unit oneness excuse me oneness i'm trying to bring it the easiest way for it to be understood and sometimes that's a little hard you know that it's not hard to preach the thing is to bring it down to a level for the people can understand uh that a human being is a triune being the brother is going to draw some circles the first one being the body this time instead of another circle and inside the heart is a compartment that's where the soul is three things united may comprise one thing you see that it's hard to separate the spirit and soul the only way we can separate it is by through the message taking those things that the messenger has told us and just stand there i'd like to brother to write down the word like for you to write down that book on your in your notebooks lord is a one heaven power and authority over others how many of you want to have the lord in your heart we as believers want to have the lord jesus christ in our heart once we start getting into it a little more we find out that the devil is also lord a lord remember let's repeat again what's in the circle so i can understand what i'm saying so far what's on the outside is the body wrote down here on this one that i wanted to comment on what is a soul you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do for it that soul's got to be changed here to be born again in order for us to see exactly what brother the thing is just that not everybody has eternal life you understood the circle we have before us say i'd like for you to follow along please i'm going to try and speak as calmly and slowly as possible for you to understand i was going to write down the word so the best way at the top and i want you to follow along here we understand the word elohim to mean the self-existing we could come down to the level where we as human beings could understand what came out of him is called a halo a halo this halo is called logos by the theologians realmente is notice how simple it is actually the message was brought to us and that's the theme for our convention is god in simplicity it's really really simple first of all it was elohim the self-existence he's the lord of apocalypses when you go to a revelation it says that the lord omnipotent reigneth so then out of him came the is that right [Applause] we will be able to understand why it is that brother branham that that seed must be dramatized i believe that in us what is it that gives see life to that seed we lived we do a lot of things we're born of our parents and then we we don't use is some people don't like enchiladas we all have a soul [Applause] and they're both the same grano so you split those seeds talk like about a grain of corn let's look at it like this a little bit the spirit is the father try deal concerning the seed that's the feminine isn't that right i'm gonna come back now i see that uh actually she doesn't matter how much i'm and until there's a transformation of the souls is transformed has to be dramatized when a man and a woman united and the man releases a million germs also one after that's the holy ghost starts dealing with your heart talking to it your conscious starts [Applause] remember one thing notice a it's not worthwhile at all if people say well tremendous what are the brothers you know that it's very easy to ask questions of ourselves god chose the mind okay put the devil the mind god the heart are you willing to have me ask you questions i always ask myself those questions or questions yeah if it be el diablo the how could it be asked yourself i would have you know what yeah i'm going to tell you something that i have said for years and you've heard me yeah and i've really understood it william branham not seen in any other man on this earth when i accepted this message we had been taught that the woman was to wear a veil and that's how the women dressed they weren't changed that's right my mom and my wife were there on commentary and they heard me say hey what brother had said my mom she took off her video my wife took her life all michelle wear a hat no no prove it to me i couldn't prove it i've said that many times i've mentioned it many times on the contrary i will go to the bible el is freely and apart oneness i want to get into the scripture how many steps did the pyramid have that the prophet drew yeah there were seven so way up at the top is the eighth corrector remember there's two towers the body has a tower has a tower so then that tower controls the control towers in the soil right there in the heart thank you christ in the holy ghost is the same thing genesis chapter 2. genesis 2 a lot of questions has raised a lot of questions has raised a lot of questions to hell they shall be [Music] me [Music] so [Music] [Music] please [Music] you
