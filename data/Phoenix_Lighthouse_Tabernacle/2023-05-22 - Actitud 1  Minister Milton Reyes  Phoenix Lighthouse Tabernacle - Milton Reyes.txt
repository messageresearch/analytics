[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] today [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] may the Lord bless you Brothers are you is amen to the scriptures let's go to the book of Colossians we'll be reading verse 22 to the 24th can you say in amen when you have it foreign [Music] God guys and whatsoever do it heartedly as to the Lord may not unto men knowing that the Lord you shall receive the reward of inheritance for ye serve the Lord Christ living [Music] um I went to the dictionary I wanted to look for the word attitude it's to be with someone or to work I went to another word facing a situation or a purpose of an actual person there is a right attitude there's a lot of people that are not Christian they also have a good attitude we also we're going to see the right mortal attitude moral incorrect attitude [Music] it takes love to do that love is the most powerful force that there is in the world have you notice of the devil is and when the person and when the people hate someone remember it is a terrible devil and despise or dislike you mustn't do that means message expectation uh zero four uh April 4th we always get what we expect when people expect anything they usually get what you look for depending like it's the mental attitude that you have videos remember this never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing well it doesn't take any gifts any person has right here to me if you're a Christian and defeat him on any grounds that he could that he could stand on the message is taking sides with Jesus there are many times a minister will make a mistake [Music] and he comes into I never heard a precious brother who's trying to do the what's right and lead the people right everything the devil can point to that point to a Believer the so-called Christian in that neighborhood he would throw off that man on that man he'll do it to throw off that man if the devil can throw you on he will do it don't say bad things just tell him good things just tell tell him you know what's good if anything is don't try to take a poll and shove a man further into the the Christian attitude is to pick him up and take him out of the ditch don't ever try to shove him down try to help him amen [Music] foreign because we get angry and mad we say things that we shouldn't say [Music] with a bad attitude or angry attitude we take bad decisions sometimes between husband and wife [Music] to have the right mental attitude Christian mental attitude message questions and answers [Music] somebody told me he had one one time was converted and received the Holy Ghost and he said to him how are you going how are you going getting along oh he said he said pretty good and pretty bad he said well how do you mean pretty good and pretty bad since I received me the Holy Ghost and me there's been two dogs in me the other one the other damn is a white dog and they said they argue all the time they ground and fight one another one another and the black dog wants me to do bad [Music] this just depends on the warning of a body that's in you the nature catered to you the Cardinal nature of after the things of the world and the spiritual nature after the things of God I want to make a point here myself [Music] [Music] very good attitude is foreign in those days in the day in those days Hezekiah was sick of near death and Isaiah the prophet son of Amos went to him and said to him set the house in order for Thou shalt die and I live he turned his face towards the wall and prayed to the Lord saying Corazon remember now oh Lord I pray how I have walked before you in truth and with a loyal heart is and have done what was good in thy side Hezekiah weep Beverly Isaiah come into the middle it was very can you imagine that this is your um [Music] return and tell Hezekiah the leader of my people thus said the Lord God of David your father have heard your prayer and have seen your tears surely I will heal you on the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord anos is 15 years and I would deliver you from the from the city from the hand of the king of Assyria and will defend city of my own for my own sake and for my sake of my servant David means the gates of the enemy the first thing a child of God has to to Refuge when a trial comes the greatest weapon ever put in the hands of mankind is prayer it even changes everything don't even change the mind of God in one occasion God told the prophet to go up and tell him the king wasn't wasn't going to die and the King returned turned his face to the one and said Lord beseech you and consider me can we make that a prayer have we walked with a perfect heart I need 15 years longer is and God spared his life 15 years longer Prayer Changes Things I'm gonna hold on here just a minute a few weeks ago my my mother-in-law um the doctor said just go and and arrest them there's nothing we could do for her Bueno yeah she began to give away her inheritance money her pots pans but the grace of God I came into the conversation when she was doing this [Music] I was able to see her face to face it's the same God [Music] it's a simple prayer now she's still alive [Music] but the grace of God was extended to her let us look at another right attitude let us go to Luke 23 39. then one of the criminals who hanged blasphemed him saying you are the Christ save yourself in us [Music] but another answer in rebuking him saying don't you ever fear God sin you're under the same condemnation for what we received or to the due reward of our Deeds but this man has done has done nothing wrong then Jesus said remember me when you come into your case [Music] that today you will be with me dude you notice the attitude there what makes the great difference Grace was extended towards him the message of Grace 1961 is that was proven there at the cross when the when there was a violence Thief was there at the cross he deserved to die God had never crossed his mind [Music] then they're at the cross through his bloody lips between the groans and came a sound Lord be merciful to me and there came another one back through the blood tears Agony Grace took uphold and said Grace got a hold of them can you imagine the word grace is something we don't deserve all of us here we were grabbed reached by Grace we want to do God's work this one here [Music] no more than you can help yourself thank you serious no more with jerk ourselves off in the Milky Way and through our bootstraps and we couldn't do it but Grace God can do it something about it the grace of God Sovereign that's wonderful says the prophet says amen amen foreign read the book of James who is wise and understanding among you is conduct by his works that are done in meekness of wisdoms nothing like this but if you have barely envy and self-seeking in your hearts do not boast and lie against the truth is [Music] this wisdom does not descend from above but it's Earthly essential than demonic foreign [Music] primeramente Pura display Pacifica but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceful gentle amable willing benign and full of GERD fruits with our partiality and without hypocrisy grounds [Music] God gave it to us because we didn't deserve anything amen foreign have mercy on me I said you're like dogs it's not right the crumbs that comes from the master's table Lord if he would have told us that yeah that would have been our attitude I'll also feed us he didn't pray for her she didn't even have to pray for her amen blessing [Applause] stand up for a momentos uh greet your brother it's always good to be in the house of the Lord I really enjoyed the message I wanted more uh I was getting involved in it I'll take your seats because this is what we need we need a transformation of the attitudes that we have the attitudes if we've received a new birth then what's in us part of the germ of the Lord Jesus Christ you know I um I woke up this morning I had too many thoughts together and the first thing I did is and what I do is I read my texts see what is going on received the text from Vietnam I received texts from all over the world this morning I received a text from my brother but before we get to two individuals we're going to be praying foreign how many of you believe in a real God we believe that God is real this God is merciful but if you believe God is merciful you didn't believe he was merciful can he accomplish I mean if he changed his mind and he gave this King an additional 15 years what about us can he perform a miracle do we still have miracles in this day I want to know where the Miracles are at I want to see America how many of you believe in miracles well I have a miracles and the Miracle I'm gonna have him come up because last week praying for an individual persona that God form of America we all know him as Aussie Escalante son of brother Sergio Escalante is we prayed for the Miracles so he's gonna give a testimony so that you understand that if he could do it for a person then he can do it for anyone we are a family if we're a family then each person within that family for each other brother Ozzie God bless you um just so you guys can really actually grasp grasp the magnitude of this miracle Captain I'll take you guys back six years ago it was 2017. um I was driving home from Peoria Phoenix and I got pulled over now those of you know me you know I'm not I'm undocumented I don't have a license so the police they felt bad for me and they're like you know I just had my passport I got my Visa number but I lost my Visa and uh I wasn't uh they pulled me over because uh I had a view I got a DUI that year and uh it's a detention center but I don't know if you guys remember I was there for 40 days so God extended his grace and got me out of that detention center with a big bonds uh and uh it's been an ongoing case the lawyers told me you gotta get gotta get married and I didn't want to do it for those reasons so I mean I held out in 2021 my lawyers told me that I had voluntary departure on the 20 on the 20th of December I think [Music] uh I got married at the time me and my girlfriend we got married and we started appealing samosa yeah so we didn't get a lawyer and uh turns out the appeal was denied foreign it's been two years since then and um fast forwarding I mean it's been nothing but God's grace it's been keeping me here um since November of last year I was uh I was I wasn't home I wasn't with my wife either I was on the streets and [Music] even then uh our testify to people and talk to people about God of course I didn't feel worthy but it's not about being worthy we heard it's about Grace and even then a couple times I saw God work through me even in my state such a couple lives right now but I know they had an experience with the Lord so so now my case was still ongoing right and um I wasn't aware about the immigration status until one day I went home and my dad told me he's like hey we got a letter from the Immigration Court he said you got to the 20th of May guess what you got to get out you got to leave and I was in no amongst on the streets and I'm like well I'll just go on the Run well yeah I'll just go and run oh yeah I think we lost a bond already I just realized that not long ago and uh I know with my brothers I've testified a lot of times that God sometimes when he loses that one sheep he goes and if that she keeps going straight it keeps going straight eventually he breaks the legs and I told myself why did I have to use that metaphor two weeks ago I was sleeping in an alley Pennsylvania and I woke up like it was about 6 a.m in a car ran over my foot my legs and uh I woke up screaming um so when I try to stand up there was breakage in the skin and I fell over and I started in I don't know why I did it I started crying I said Thank You Lord thank you thank you God I'm tired at this moment my parents are in Iowa so nobody knows this happened four days and um I didn't get any visitors all the time I was there when I got out I called one of my brothers and my brother was kind enough to take time out of the day and come pick me up um and even then I was still like I'll still love it I'm more than wobbling with with foot and I'm still going to run I don't really laugh but it's just God has other plans for us so um four days after I get out of the hospital I think um my mom she had uh somebody had asked her where her son was so there was a very big weight on her heart she said for me so she was at service on Wednesday night and she started she went to Elder spray and they never do well his prayer Wednesday night the exact same thing that they were asking for was what she was asking foreign she's a woman of faith so um the next day I believe yeah the next day Thursday I'm walking where I usually work was at you know walking with a wheelchairs and uh she told me to come home and um and ever since then they've been have me there and I've been I've been I've been very happy to be with my family I hadn't seen him in a long time I went to Sister Elizabeth's party yesterday it was really nice to see all my brothers and all my friends I see you but um basically what I want to tell the magnitude so a week passes by when it's Wednesday let's go see my brother Moses and I I go I go to see it because Moses would see me all the time I was always in this neighborhood but uh I I was like hey boy you home he said yeah come on by I was like all right so when you have something that you know the Lord is for you you can't help but go and share with your brother [Music] [Music] make me go I said my parents are really going to make me go yeah and I was kind of like nervous because someone wanted to be awesome my mom had said Lord whatever you have to do to him so I was like okay well see you know this is it because I've gone astray so many times I feel like it made God's grace a disgrace so when I got to the immigration place I thought I was going to have a whole trial like brother Chui told his testimony they didn't even let my family go with me computer [Music] um and I started I started sweating I was like how much I saw that I'm really gonna get deported you know uh married we appealed yeah but the pill is nine and I was raised to my head and I was like I had an accident last week and the lady she goes okay I was like yeah I gotta run over by car last week all the officers so I showed my leg and um okay I don't want you to have to deal with that when you're over there I'm gonna give you three months extension the one extensions keep in mind they're like here put this in your pockets Pakistan so tell me that's not last minute um I started walking out and I was in such shock foreign um maybe it's not as real to you as it is to me but there's so many other times that I can tell from six years ago to today where God kept me and protected me though because even after I got out of Illinois one more one more crazy instance about not even a month later um and I made a wrong turn they're like what's all the stuff you got in the cars um there was no way they should have let me go foreign they're like be smarter about this kid with drugs in the car Brothers and we were and while I was driving this is like probably a couple weeks these two instances I'm telling you I was I was I'm really yeah but I always say the cop car he pulled this over of course we were honest with them when I remember we had like on the floor he's like call your dad call somebody with a license Travis she said I don't want to catch driving once because I'm sitting in Mexico this is two instances [Music] yeah foreign it's a righteous prayer of your mother I'm gonna say it again your mother has been praying foreign my advice that I can give you rededicate your life together and everything will turn out right let me share with you is safe something absolutely wrong it was a church today you know what's wrong with the church or relaxed we are so relaxed just the way the name of this age is [Music] we have everything we're rich you may say I'm poor no we are rich in all things including the message we have so much message we don't know what to do with it it's collected so much dust we need to go back we need to go back and hear it again my sheep hear my Las Vegas my sheep my sheep here here my boys my boys Vegas amen amen so you heard the voice you heard a voice of a crying mother brought Grace to You Gracia so that's what we need in order for someone to become a miracle someone has to be standing there has to be praying do me a favor always pray to God even if you're standing up even if you're driving yeah foreign I can drive I can do this I can do that and my brain is thinking what I need to correct what I need to do in order to not to get stale you know like bread gets stale um there was a sister or there is a sister she's Milton's grandmother 80 years old she needs prayer I'm gonna tell you what's wrong with it but when you hit 80. everything goes wrong your eyesight and thank God I'm not wearing glasses I thank God I wouldn't say on a certain night that a person was below me a different room I'm in the top I couldn't sleep but I could hear that person snore I don't say it to be funny I said because I got a super hearing but sometimes I gotta do this and it's all the grace of God so your grandmother your grandmother it's okay your grandmother is okay okay didn't have to pray for her everything was okay so just tell her everything all is well I want you to understand that all is wow all is well all is well if I recall there was a prophet I've been going to visit a lady and the first thing how's your son all as well that's what we need the Wonders once we start with that positive attitude God will bring everything to pass we're going to pray for a a baby the person speaking with Carlos trying to get more information breaks out in rash es yeah comes out in rash yes um I'm not a doctor but I know

certain foods and what we're going to do okay I must have said is we're going to pray that the Lord take away the rash he's only a baby and that's what we need to do like I said I believe in prayer your obligations your duty bounds to say what the word of God a little over a year close to two years old what does he know he cries because there's something wrong he needs something so what we're

that was shedded at the foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] this little boy able to relax able to know one thing there is a God and that God is real and that God created you that this baby would be here this morning [Music] you had this baby you have to sing in your mind so Lord there's nothing too big nothing too small and the way you've allowed brother Ozzie to give a test questions the way you healed his leg the way you open the door so that he can stay here here's a child do the same thing let your mercy come down not the grace as I applied the oil allow me oil to start working inside his little body to take the rash away [Music] restore his blood [Music] restore the white blood cells strengths let them start fighting let the white blood cells do its work any form of infection so infections [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] fresh conscious leave this body Jesus Jesus enter into this body and like a little dog let the oil that has been applied start working from the inside out taking infections out inflammation let the parents know s by the symphony that you're here this morning the hill I had their babies that when the doctors see him again [Music] something dried up [Music] there is no more infection there is no more inflammation there's no more rash in his body let that Miracle come forth finger let the world could know say you're the same yesterday can't change Lord it's if it's for your purpose yes so we pray just like you changed your mind [Music] killed [Music] this baby and the parents will give you the honor and the glory that's our prayer [Music] let this miracle come forth we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Carlos I want you to open his mouth and blow in his mouth mouth blow in there blow three times there's
