[27:56] again
[27:59] [Music]
[28:11] [Music]
[28:32] [Music]
[28:37] and again
[28:38] [Music]
[28:44] foreign
[28:48] [Music]
[29:05] [Applause]
[29:06] [Music]
[29:34] said before
[29:36] [Applause]
[29:37] [Music]
[30:16] [Music]
[30:28] this evening
[30:30] may you be with me
[30:33] as we voice your word
[30:36] likewise
[30:53] and thanks to it
[30:56] we can reach that salvation
[30:59] we come trusting in you
[31:02] put yourself together in your hands
[31:08] maybe for you Lord
[31:11] Jesus Christ amen
[31:19] taking advantage that we're standing up
[31:21] we're going to be going to the scripture
[31:24] [Music]
[31:27] the base which we'll be using is in
[31:30] Revelations three
[31:32] we'll be reading from 20 to 22. Romanos
[31:41] they will be reading Romans 8 from 38
[31:44] 39.
[31:47] you can indicate it with an amen when
[31:48] you have it
[31:50] where the Lord
[31:52] [Music]
[31:58] is
[31:58] [Music]
[32:02] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[32:04] any man hear my voice and open the door
[32:06] I will come into him and will sup with
[32:08] him and he with me
[32:14] evansito
[32:16] is
[32:19] him that overcome it will I grant to say
[32:21] with me and my throne even as I also
[32:23] overcame and sat down with my father in
[32:25] his throne
[32:32] let him hear what the spirit said unto
[32:34] the churches
[32:36] will be going into Romans
[32:39] 8 37.
[32:50] then all these things we are more than
[32:53] conquerors through him that loved us
[32:54] principals
[32:56] [Music]
[33:05] for I am persuaded that neither death
[33:07] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[33:09] nor powers nor things present nor things
[33:11] to come
[33:19] Jesus
[33:23] or any other creature shall be able to
[33:25] separate us from the love of God which
[33:27] is in Christ Jesus Lord
[33:29] you may take your sheets brother
[33:32] foreign
[33:54] foreign
[34:31] [Music]
[34:45] we are here for one specific purpose
[34:50] this is the house of correction
[34:53] this is the throne this is
[34:56] the Throne of God
[34:59] and judgment Goes Forth from the house
[35:02] of God
[35:07] and here's where we come together Gather
[35:10] in love with one another
[35:13] as only Christians can love
[35:17] peruaki
[35:20] a monistamous
[35:23] but in here we are under a leadership of
[35:26] the Holy Spirit
[35:28] the Holy Ghost is Among Us yes
[35:33] and we're here and it says
[35:37] to take Reckoning among us
[35:41] to see where our short places are
[35:46] shortcomings
[35:49] we can catch from where we should be
[35:53] or where we ought to be now
[35:57] where we are or where we ought to be is
[36:02] where we ought to be
[36:05] and that's what we study
[36:07] foreign
[36:13] [Music]
[36:28] am I going to overcome my husband
[36:30] to see who can yell more at home
[36:33] am I going to overcome my wife
[36:36] am I going to overcome my co-workers at
[36:39] work
[36:40] or who are we going to overcome
[36:45] and it says in paragraph 62 and how can
[36:49] I overcome
[36:52] the thing you have to overcome is
[36:54] yourself
[36:55] uh
[37:40] [Music]
[37:46] [Music]
[38:02] we can't change it
[38:05] familiares there's trials for families
[38:07] for the wife Al Padre for the father for
[38:10] the son
[38:12] but already has the name for who it's
[38:14] foreign
[38:39] no it's completely different
[38:43] the trial has the test has your name
[38:45] there no one is watching you look at
[38:49] your neighbor
[38:50] he has a different example they put his
[38:54] name
[38:54] and we can switch them
[38:58] because sometimes he's studying a
[39:00] different type of license
[39:01] the messenger says
[39:04] what is it that makes the test for us
[39:10] it's evidence that God is with us
[39:13] that's what a trial is with us
[39:20] and the message the perfect Faith speech
[39:22] in 1963. this is
[39:26] I get spells too you know I get moody
[39:30] I get moody yeah
[39:42] this is
[39:46] sometimes there's weeks where we're
[39:47] flying pretty low uh ideas they're sad
[39:50] days
[39:51] there's a cloudy days and there's bad
[39:55] days the messenger says
[40:02] what gets me is when I get those spells
[40:04] is
[40:07] when I get all overworked
[40:12] and Satan comes telling me why nobody
[40:15] cares for you
[40:18] you really haven't got a friend in the
[40:21] world
[40:22] can you continue saying
[40:25] he says remember I'm not immune to The
[40:28] Temptations
[40:29] If he's not immune
[40:32] then none of us are immune a man amen
[40:35] they say
[40:36] a business
[40:39] uh
[41:25] then when I look back and see something
[41:27] like this
[41:30] I put it right back in his face and say
[41:33] they can say so what about that is
[41:36] that helps me too
[41:38] that helps me to overcome
[41:42] amen
[41:57] [Music]
[42:33] even so you could not put a spot on him
[42:36] with your finger
[42:38] the message Joshua the great lawyer
[42:41] number two
[42:47] a little the messenger continues saying
[42:52] now you got to do something
[42:55] because God doesn't do anything by force
[42:59] you have to believe it
[43:01] you've got to do some fighting
[43:04] I'm going to stop here for a moment
[43:08] he says you have to do something for
[43:10] yourself
[43:13] when we say Lord help us
[43:19] but what am I doing to do my part
[43:23] if I smoke
[43:26] when I buy a pack of cigarettes
[43:34] we say that we're collaborating
[43:38] so we have to do it from the beginning
[43:40] we have to start fighting from them
[43:44] now when we already have what's doing us
[43:47] no good foreign
[45:25] the messenger says
[45:41] many of you have read he said he told
[45:43] them
[45:44] he says what are you doing what are you
[45:47] going to do here
[46:13] [Music]
[46:47] with the power
[46:55] [Music]
[47:08] but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he
[47:12] promised it to me
[47:14] is
[47:22] the next message
[47:26] says be calm and see the salvation of
[47:28] your hope
[47:29] is
[47:38] sorry stand still and see the salvation
[47:40] of the Lord so many times we all get to
[47:42] a place where we can't find it stand
[47:44] still and nervous
[47:45] as I was right now here in the beginning
[47:49] just as we start to do something good
[47:53] then we see trouble coming
[47:59] but that is the devil trying to upset
[48:02] the program of God
[48:17] uh lives
[48:50] in which way God would have you go which
[48:52] is the best way
[49:02] sometimes we want to think with our
[49:04] thoughts
[49:07] for example
[49:11] and we go and we see
[49:16] when you arrive at your home at your
[49:18] house
[49:19] and you open the door and you're about
[49:21] to go inside
[49:22] um
[49:24] and you saw that a rattlesnake snuck
[49:26] into your house
[49:28] you're not going to want to go inside
[49:29] the house
[49:32] so you're certain that that rattlesnake
[49:35] is either dead or outside of your house
[49:37] now we bring it to our minds
[49:40] we can't avoid the bad thoughts
[49:44] we can avoid for them to stay in our
[49:47] minds
[49:49] because without wrestling inside your
[49:51] house
[49:55] I don't think so
[49:58] foreign
[50:10] [Music]
[50:12] just when a little confusion comes in
[50:14] the church
[50:16] and not this church he's talking about
[50:18] another one
[50:19] [Music]
[50:21] you don't run over to one side and pout
[50:23] now
[50:24] I would say pouting or complaining
[50:29] if you are you sure ain't a priest
[50:33] now what is a priest the dictionary says
[50:37] it's an individual who gives a sacrifice
[50:40] to God
[50:43] you should pray through that sacrifices
[50:49] spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our
[50:52] lips giving praise to his name
[50:54] see what I mean
[50:57] Bueno
[51:30] well I just don't feel like taking part
[51:33] in the service
[51:35] I think that's for some of us well I'll
[51:39] bring it to myself
[51:45] sometimes when there's moments where we
[51:47] have to partake in the service of church
[51:53] I believe it happens to many of us in
[51:55] the beginning of our Christian world
[51:57] and for one or another reason
[52:01] we argue with our wife
[52:04] it could be your son or it could be your
[52:07] father
[52:09] you may say I'm not going to go to
[52:12] church anymore
[52:14] how is gay how's this
[52:17] he has nothing to do with it
[52:22] we take it like I'm not going to go
[52:24] anymore
[52:26] the measure continues
[52:32] it says you're a priest making a
[52:35] sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice
[52:40] not giving somebody some hand-me-down
[52:43] as they call it today that's all good
[52:47] I have nothing against it
[52:51] not going to get somebody to come to
[52:53] church that's all good
[52:56] I have nothing against it
[52:58] [Music]
[53:00] but it's you making the spiritual
[53:03] sacrifice
[53:05] the fruits of your lips giving praise to
[53:08] his name
[53:11] sometimes when we argue or disagree
[53:14] um
[53:17] I don't know what happens to you but
[53:19] sometimes it happens to me
[53:21] um
[53:25] we should mend that immediately
[53:28] we should get into account right away
[53:32] the Bible says
[53:35] the Sun not go down without fixing that
[53:39] amen amen well
[53:48] try to respect
[53:50] um
[53:51] foreign
[53:51] [Music]
[54:14] [Music]
[54:48] in the Church of the lingard this
[54:50] morning lays the power to heal all the
[54:52] sickness
[54:57] in the Church of the Living God lays
[55:00] power to overcome our Temptations
[55:08] in the possession of the Church of the
[55:10] Living God this morning lays the power
[55:12] to change sin and throw it away
[55:14] [Music]
[55:16] and receive the baptism of the Holy
[55:18] Ghost
[55:20] in the Church of Jesus Christ
[55:28] in my name and it shall be given unto
[55:30] you amen amen
[55:35] single
[55:43] this is
[55:45] he says you're in that Kingdom
[55:51] by the Holy Ghost baptism
[55:59] sometimes we go all red so many times
[56:05] it's all under the shared blood is
[56:07] Overcomers the ones are Overcomers
[56:12] because you cannot overcome
[56:14] foreign
[56:52] foreign
[57:36] Daniel they threw him in the pit
[57:39] if the Lions ate them you overcame and
[57:44] if they didn't eat yeah he still
[57:45] overcame a man what the Lord gives us
[57:51] say in a testimony
[57:57] he says there came a ship to come to the
[57:59] port this is
[58:06] what the captain says on the speaker
[58:10] is before the next 15 or 20 minutes
[58:13] we're gonna have a very strong
[58:16] storms
[58:20] if we continue the next 15 or 20 minutes
[58:22] on the sea
[58:37] amen glory to God
[58:39] you stick at DNA and the captain says
[58:41] what's wrong with you
[58:43] he said
[58:44] [Music]
[58:45] he says I have a daughter waiting for me
[58:47] at the Port yeah if I get over there I'm
[58:51] gonna see her
[58:54] and I have another daughter in Paradise
[58:56] that passed away
[59:00] then I'll see one of the others amen
[59:03] Brothers
[59:08] [Music]
[59:10] sometimes one as a husband
[59:14] instead of giving good examples
[59:17] sometimes we light up
[59:20] something lights us up in our body
[59:22] when
[59:25] that comes up in your body
[59:28] it's not because you activate it
[59:31] you don't activate it
[59:33] that's automatically for you to get
[59:35] fired up
[59:38] brother says it's like an electric
[59:40] current
[59:41] it's automatically
[59:45] you as your as a wife if you lose your
[59:47] temperature
[59:50] in this control because you just can't
[59:54] because we haven't overcame yet says
[59:57] brother Branham
[59:58] you as a son they correct you yeah
[1:00:01] and instead of accepting the corrections
[1:00:05] they tell you three words and you answer
[1:00:07] back with 20. and at the end you didn't
[1:00:10] even do one word
[1:00:14] remember
[1:00:16] the trials are evidence
[1:00:20] that God is
[1:00:22] we have to reach a point
[1:00:26] where we can say it's no longer that
[1:00:28] lives
[1:00:29] but Christ that lives in me can we
[1:00:32] please stand
