[Music] all right momentos foreign [Music] [Music] palabra esta manana we have two individuals actually three individuals a fabulous job I just love God and the way he he does his plan not my plan but his plan is very successful last night at the convention in a lot of healings miracles so you should be proud that from the lighthouse well we have um yeah evangelio is Dulce is foreign we're bringing Souls into Christ o sisters start looking at man when I started looking at myself I'm telling myself are there spots in my face is spotless this morning if the Rapture was to come today but if it was to come are we spotless enough foreign now look and say from your heart if you look what a person or not because there's too many of us and we can't wake up everything is in order right now every nation is where they should be today the prophecy is being fulfilled within our eyes we have no time the time is gone I've heard that word since 1977. part of 1977. but time is at hand everything that brother Brennan said today so I tell myself I must speak to myself am I perfect am I am I in a perfect statements this body was meant it was designed to have the Holy Spirit in us we will be made perfect my concern is Am I Living Clean I tell you if from the heart from my heart or am I living with isms is my heart clean or am I living with isms and the reason I say isms well this person believes this this person believes that that person believes and let me tell you during a fellowship there's many Islams I heard one brother one says brother preached a great sermon sermon and then the other brother wanted to you know undercut and under the table hit him uh you had a tremendous message he said but how many times should I be born again my Ministry this is what the brother was telling this other brother isms ismos to be born every day not one time every day I need to be born again remember words I think wrongly I judge wrongly who's going correctamente I feel sick I'm infected mentally with the wrong Spirit that's why we die daily you gotta get rid of that stuff that is hindering us is there anyone here that doesn't worry about that stuff that we're so clean and pious that hey well you know he's talking about himself not me I'm talking about us I heard the other day hearing a message and then it was brother Branham speaking and all of a sudden I went back to what brother Bernie had said you see brother Brenham said when the church is born again he didn't say when an individual was born he said when the church is born again I had to go back to 1981. you know when the church was born again but my concern has always been I could have been born again in 1981. I could have been born again I could have been born in the message so my question before I get to that box if you uh were born in the message parents were message I can't raise my hand I'm from the outside coming in and I'm going to tell you that that has no bearing in this message because you were born let me say that over it doesn't mean a thing you yourself have to be born again we don't have to be born again so that I go back like I said the church was born again on a Sunday night January the 18th 1981 I can tell you who preached that day when the Holy Spirit came and sooner or later a church is destined to be born again what happens to us as a church everybody is thinking one way the other person is thinking another way and it's hindering what we need you know what I better start my message I've gone 12 minutes I want you to go to slide one if I was to give this uh a subtitle the sons of God are called they're anointed they're commissioned and their place we need to be placed sooner or later we must be placed in the position that God predestinated us to be placed in the position you gotta stay up with me guys technology boy do I love it foreign so where's the Judgment scene somebody help me where and don't they very good thank you in the church gracias thank you everything's there we can read and the little Wells represent the little churches all out and the judgment begins at the house of God so all these little churches begins in the house of God so my question to you is where am I going to be judged someone tell me where I'm going to be judged the house of God let me say it over again you're being judged today everything we think someone's in here it's louder up there than here is we need to remember we are going through a judgment period we need to be obedient and do exactly what you're told to do being submissive or do you want to sacrifice now listen oh that's good brother Brennan goes on see here's where the judgment begins that's why I don't see why so many complain that I speak too hard foreign and try to make people straighten up and tell them way they're living the way they're dressing and tell me images I'm hurting my ministry here is telling people straighten up you need to make sure you're doing it this way and people telling them you know that each Pastor has to do that there's people that will accept it people that say I don't care remember spotless when the Judgment seat is in the house of God that's right here's where it's to begin at yes right here where Justice and righteousness of God is to go forth foreign what's that word I'm sorry I can't hear you know I had a birthday recently and I don't know if it's the wax in there that's bothering me what is it how come I only hear three or four of them don't they there's a season for everything God yes anointed and place the person that he wanted a leader to lead the flock and it's not up to me I mean I wanted to retire I wanna die walk around the beach not in shorts the sand get between the toes you know go out there and drink one of those drinks what are they don't say pina colada or something like that please uh what kind of drink the drink you drink thank you really uh God that's the new one that's what I drink I usually have mineral water with uh lemonade a beach or something drinking a lemonade relaxing not having to worry this person doing this that person doing that but that's not what God wants that's what I wanted I can't do what I what I would do I gotta do what I'm expected to do because don't worry if it's hurting your minutes you gotta say the word of God to the letter and it starts right here in other words the minister can't do it a visiting Minister can't do it the local Pastor whatever congregation it is thank you so judgment begins in the house of God we show him I've always believed when brother Bernie used to say in reference where is the Judgment seat Well I was looking at Heaven I'd do this I'd have to go back and ask him what do you mean and he would chuckle how many of you remember his Chuckles foreign thank you Hebrews now we can start as an introduction now we can start Hebrews 9 11. again God's plan just doesn't stop with what we talked about last year the whole Plan of Redemption covers everything facet that you could think of imagination from Genesis Genesis to Revelation apocalypse we've got a lot to cover but Christ being come and high Priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats in the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to purify the flesh is how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve a living God is again without spot Purge your conscience to serve the Living God how many of us could put our name to that thoughts from dead Works [Applause] will you marry him [Applause] Crystal that blood is a Sangre is what covers Us when I do wrong when I think wrong though wrong it's covering us the Holy Spirit a sinful world but there's many Believers and that's why the holy spirit is circling around them the Bride of Jesus Christ can you say Amen so how many of us include ourselves of being called the Bride of Jesus Christ it's what it is you have no choice you may want to say I'm going to run and hide he said yeah you can be a jumper you can jump from one place but God already knows to be fulfilled and each and every one of your life so don't tell me that you don't have faith don't tell me you're not part of the Bride show me I'm from Missouri and I'm going to tell you right now there's not one person sitting here he shouldn't believe what they are identified with a message so when you're going through a problem when you're going through an issue I heard this word in Mexico so I had to go back to the message also restlessness worries concerns you can do this just wouldn't leave us alone I got so many things I tell people like brother Paul used to say and the same worries is what we had back in the 70s nothing has changed the only thing that has changed is I look at them back then as I said I was a golfer and I would listen to Bernie's team brother Bernie's team this brother would say well they believe this they believe that what are you going to tell them so then my ears would do this you know where they say there's a uh there's a ditch I don't know how to say it in English so that's why I said in Spanish when you hear something for those things are attentive well that's what I was to brother Bernie and then I want more and the first thing he would say 20 30 40 years are going to pass some people are gonna have those same concerns 50 years have passed it was 50 years and people have the same concerns my family my wife also my kids I have no work I have no car I have no house what am I going to do nobody loves me you know why I'd say this what's happening today I call them jumpers today they're with us tomorrow there's somewhere else they jump from church to church seeking advice they asked for advice they're not happy with the advice they go from place to place to place is marriage and divorce yes they jump and they jump and they jump until someone tells them what they want to hear and what they don't want to hear is could I leave my wife she's mean to me she believes in fast food I don't know you know Eli should have married a Mexican boy but she doesn't like to cook my wife's a great cook I use that as an example because that's what's happening a lack of communication you know I have questions how many of us want to be in God's perfect world there's three words that I can think of to be in his perfect will that is would you like to hear them I didn't put them up there because we're all writing down so let me ask Danny give me one word wow are you reading my mind today Danny obedience give me a word subject submissive wow you're reading my thoughts what's the third one can somebody tell me obedience being submissive communication you gotta communicate there's uh there's a sender um so we want to be in God's perfect world so I'm going to tell you you've all heard three stages of Grace what's the first like I said I can't really hear no sorry no uh you know I've always believed this with all my heart I'll never change I believe in unity in other words we should be able to all say justification all together that means that we all know that the first stage so what is it what is I heard a little bit let me hear it again justification now have you ever seen a person you see a person in crutches have you seen somebody sick so bad again that all of a sudden they have gangreneur have you seen that so have you heard or seen a person to tell you brother God sent me to you told me to pray for you and the person's reply is I'm waiting for my brother he's going to pray for us have you ever heard that well I recall being in Guadalajara I don't remember the year I really don't know but there was a police officer high-ranking police officer his brother lived in Orange California and this police officer commandant whatever they are official it was in a wheelchair and his wife says his feet smell you know he was gangrene it was eating them apart that means give them a couple days and he's six feet in the ground we had a Revival that year holy spirit fell people receiving their healing Miracles and baptism came that night yes about this one so the brother looks at me and I said uh brother can I pray for you and he closed down he says and I said if you're not careful you're going to die in a wheelchair I want you to stand up and walk with me how many of you walk and want Jesus to walk with you hand in hand how many would like that if you would like Jesus instead what would you say the person got up and we walked and I said can you feel that God is healing you he didn't see his feet Yes didn't worry if they hurt or not the closer we got to the I'm sorry the Judgment seed comes from where we got close to the pope is the pet is so he started looking at brother Pineda he was baptizing individuals I want to do that did anyone force him again did anyone say anything God call s him through a perfect Word Perfect so he got in baptized him got baptized walked out salio was walking like this the next day I looked for him couldn't find him the whole world that's where his family was at he was like this because he received it because he wasn't pressured he accepted God's perfect will in his life I asked brother Pablo Reyes whatever happened to the brother he said he lasted I think between three and six months and God took him now my my question is is he saved many people will be saved and they only made it to justification but that was God's will again you cannot tell me if God wants me to clean the church foreign God can use you for five minutes he was going to do it you can sing one song and that was it yes that's what he calls you foreign to pray for one Persona to preach one sermon and that was it yes and he was done with you yeah his perfect will can we change his perfect will well then why do we want to be something we're not too many people want to be this that and they don't understand that's not what God called God has a purpose and each and every one of us that's his perfect will and as we continue we'll break it down so how many of us have been called to carry out God's plan thank you Three Needs out here so I can talk about it okay his wife's not here I see his son so let me say it this way carrying out God's plan is if you're going to do it you better do it right if you don't do it right I'm Gonna Get You Down does he say that yeah that's the way he says I'll kick you down correct we were meant you and I were called to carry out God's plan so how many pastors do I have here sisters how many pastors whoa that's a catchy one isn't it what did Bernie what did Brother Bernie say about it she was the pastor of the what the kitchen let me say it again Garcia our pastor and Apostle Astoria Boston said the woman he's a pastora of her kitchen yes or no no she's the pastor of the kitchen could you imagine the pastor of the kitchen trying to go out and do I'm sorry who's the pastor of the house oh yeah how do you say esposo in English husband oh yeah I'm teasing you I want you to wake up I'm not trying to be cute the husband is the pastor of the house yes or no when the pasture of the kitchen tries to take over the duties of the pastor of the house is that carrying out God's plan no no we have to stay where he placed us let me say it again we have to stay if he called me to be a deacono if he called me to do be a a trustee can I take the role of the deacono I gotta stay where okay and my colleague you can't be switching back and forth I heard brother brothers I cleaned the church I put wood in the fireplace or the uh wood burner stove good thank you I picked up the offering God called me to be a what what was he called to do slow slumbering tired oh I shouldn't have stayed up so late brother Brennan was called to be a what a prophet but he was doing the duties an Evangelista a teacher maestro a pastor a pastor there is a difference between brother Branham being able to do all five the only one I saw close to doing that it was all five but for you and I to try to say I'm this this we are getting out of God's plan all that just to say we're getting off God's plan carriers of a message we should Witnesses but leave everything else to the person that God called him to do can you say Amen how many have you been trained I think we've all been trained to do something else did you get trained retrained training is like reading it never stops it's a live long learning in the same way it is with being trained I'm sorry way back there raise your hand um I need work sadio I want twenty dollars an hour I think it's more now more no wonder he's laughing he's saying that I got him I want more work but he was a he was a barber he doesn't know what you do matter of fact you say give me an inch and a half and he goes to you and says what's an inch and a half could you use them or would you train him he's waving his hand saying I would train him now he's a framer he's doing a good job but you need someone Italian to start putting the boxes for the electricity could he do it can he be trained uh once he's trained he go to another place and say the same thing I know framing I know electricity I found out it was 50 an hour no no you need a license you need to be certified that you've been trained to do another job who certifies us and God's instead you're looking at him it's a seal they give yourself state has its own sale electricians you need a license ministers you need a license how many of you know that ministers come on now there's two forms a license you go to school or you're ordained one or the other two groups two different groups why am I saying all this because when I get to where I need to guess you can go back to the tape and hear it over again cross training cross you need that cross training if you're in housing you need to know everything there is about housing pains and God's economy it's the same thing is you got to be trained as a deacon yes or no raise your hand yes or no you're trained as a deacon one session or is it a continual thing it never stops how many of us believe in being commissioned where are you raise your hand if you believe that I'm going to finish in a little while oh here's Danny Daddy I need you to listen to this Danny uh wanted to go to Colombia Colombia so call me and tell me you'd like to go to Colombia Colombia where are you is he commissioned no let me say it again too many people want to be commissioned but nobody sends them they send themselves that's the same way with the five-fold ministry when somebody says brother Garcia said why didn't he call me brother Garcia usually calls and lets us know ahead of time the last thing you should do is buy your ticket the first thing you should do is get permission I'm sorry you must get permission somebody has to give you the okay we just don't do things because we want to do them somebody has a plan God's plan was preordained that we would follow this type of ethics can you say Amen I'm just giving you a little bit so when I get to it how many of us have been placed raise your hand if you've been in place I'm sitting in Heavenly places no how many ministers do I have raise your hand the reason I like it so much is um you know you were called well do I don't I I don't know I didn't say ordained I said how many ministers okay good good good good good good good good good there's a difference between Minister and ordained ministers so when you're placed that's God's place in you this is how many of you lead song services that's it what were we talking about tell me you say it in Spanish I'll say it in English that's me I'm the one that's supposed to forget that's what we talked about was every time we needed song leaders now I look in people like this is like this I see and now they're like this leading song Services we have an abundance because God hears The Plea of his yes he saw you in the beginning [Applause] I'm going to skip definitions because my I have four minutes I want you to go to Europe slide 17. speak to this rock hablaster brother Brenham said you said that's what's the matter with too many churches they've taken the carnal intellectual route been cut off of this the supplies of God's blessings and the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they took the desert route therefore we have arguing and complaints is that us if that's us raise your hands well a lot of you know well let me tell you uh yes or no Moses goes out sends them Egyptians oh excuse me the Hebrews out of Egypt they go into the desert what did they find Manna From Heaven what did they find water what did they find I won food food from where from Heaven they saw the pillar of fire they saw every Miracle you could think I didn't need shoes everything was there for them they experienced everything experimentation but after a while they wanted a lamb you know and one says to the other we should have stayed in Egypt I missed the garlic they started complaining is that us we've seen the blessings but we still complain and the reason we complain is we get tired we get so preoccupied is that me or is that all of us well when are we going to have Sunday service I miss the Sunday service I got a surprise for you why don't we get out of the Thursday service when are we gonna go back to being normal I'm tired of this well what I want you to hear okay uh Bernie's mascarado in English it's the last one mascarado then take off the mask and put it on take it off let's see what he said in that tape you'll get a surprise he goes on therefore but those who are still remaining in the way it's Joy yes unspeakable full of Glory with God how many of you still have the joy in your heart joy joy in my heart something has to feed us brothers sisters with a pillar of fire over them how that the real Born Again Church how that real born-again church it's moving on to the promise of eternal life a land flowing with eternal life where there's no more sickness death sorrow the church has to be born again I'm not talking about individuals yes individuals have been born again Pentecost I don't see it that way come this way I'm tired of you I don't want to do that anymore well brother I'm I'm sorry you feel that way what did I do to you I just don't like you I'm a Christian you're an old crow come on somebody don't tell me I'm reading your mind when somebody approaches you so a real born-again church when somebody gets to you and they tell you that is and they say well that Pastor is this that ministers what's your what should you tell them brother I love that brother I love my family I'm also familiar I don't want to hear it okay is that hard to say you know 90 of our problems would stop we were to memorize that because I'm going to tell you people have spit on me people have been pushed Tomatoes it hasn't been the first time people are going to talk about me the first time is it going to bother me it shouldn't but if you're not careful Born Again mature enough we're gonna go under a rock and that's where we're going to stay because I thought all Christians were good Christians well let me tell you that's why I said there's a time to speak a time to listen time to be obedient can you say Amen I'm gonna close with this if I can find it wow oh there it is I want you to stand up you know I had somebody they brought me this a little outfit as outfit and um they wanted us to pray for this baby and this is what brother Brennan said can I read it and I want you to apply it to yourself to your family don't say anything contrary to it refuse to sign anything the devil brings he will have to take it back I refuse to have it I just won't have it no sir no senor he will take it he will have to take it back in the name of the Lord if you believe it confess it I accept Jesus Christ as my healer there's no Affliction or disease stay right with it the reason I'm reading this is for this is I'll say it again Satan has to take back whatever is happening in your life has to take it back all you have to do is reject it if you are this that is he will take it back but you got to do your part all you have to do is believe it brother Brenham says say I accept Jesus Christ as my healer so with your heads down it doesn't matter what Affliction you have what worry you have what's in your heart God knows what you can take God knows the pressure in your life you can't hide it all you have to do raise your hand and give it back to the original owner the sickness and the reflections send it back brother Brenham continues to say but the first time that you get weak and you say you said you say well yes I still got it then you drop right down to where you were at was that you signed for it then you took it back [Music] every time we get weak in the spirit weak in the flesh the first thing that pops into your mind I still got the sickness I still have the Affliction I still have a race that's when you got it back again I want you to say say it from your heart or say it out loud yes Mr devil Diablo I'll have it back oh brother you stand right there as long as there's breath in your body I refuse to have it I refuse to have it foreign [Music] thank you brother Brenham says how do you feel wonderful Hallelujah that's right show the devil What You're Made Of show the devil this morning [Music] you're born again by the spirit of God and you don't have to bow down say right there and say okay I don't want that stuff I don't want that stuff I don't
