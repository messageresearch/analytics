[42:06] because thou says I am rich and
[42:08] increased with Goods

[42:49] not appear and anoint with isaf that is
[43:00] as many as I love I rebuke and chase
[43:03] them be serious therefore repent amen
[43:07] Brothers
[43:18] small portion that we read uh
[43:21] the E hero ah musliment
[43:26] I'm gonna focus on one scripture only
[43:31] the title that we're gonna speak on is I
[43:34] counsel thee
[43:35] an apocalypses
[43:37] Revelations 3 18
[43:39] .
[43:41] there's something outstanding here three
[43:44] little things
[43:46] I want you to take an account the
[43:48] description
[43:52] obviously corresponds to this last age
[44:00] you'll notice that this is the only
[44:02] church age k
[44:04] El angel that the angel or the Lord
[44:09] it tells the church
[44:17] [Music]
[44:32] and all the rest of the church ages he
[44:35] had something against them
[44:37] but in this age is
[44:47] going to counsel giving advice to this
[44:49] church
[44:57] he's given the answer or the the way out
[45:01] to this generation
[45:05] so it's good for us to know what this is
[45:09] the first thing
[45:11] is
[45:15] that's right take the message
[45:21] receiving Gods advice this morning
[45:25] he's telling us directly okay
[45:30] to buy with me gold I tried and Fire
[45:58] that we are in the generation and like
[46:01] that in the age
[46:03] where there is more Darkness
[46:12] and it's so dark
[46:17] that people can't see who they are
[46:22] they don't know they're men or women
[46:26] that's how dark this church is
[46:31] among other things that are happening
[46:34] but the Lord in his grace
[46:38] I will cancel the foreign
[47:04] unhappy
[48:32] it's very simple yes
[48:35] thank the Lord for the message
[48:38] gives us the key here
[48:41] in the message
[48:45] paragraph 190. This is the word of God
[48:48] says
[48:50] but the goal that Jesus gives is it's
[48:53] the Holy Spirit
[48:56] the golden oil of the spirit so the Rama
[48:59] then
[49:00] Force into your heart
[49:05] and oh my console of you then
[49:11] Oro
[49:12] is
[49:17] the perfect oh yes
[49:23] the Holy Spirit
[49:25] to understand a little bit more
[49:30] let us go to the scripture first Peter
[49:33] once
[49:35] to understand what's the goal is
[49:39] and we hope that at the end of the
[49:41] service
[49:44] many can understand the riches in the
[49:46] Lord
[49:47] First Peter 1 7 says
[49:54] foreign
[50:10] with fire might be found and to praise
[50:13] and honor and Glory at the appearance of
[50:16] Jesus Christ
[50:18] let us go to the scripture now
[50:21] our faith
[50:23] will be tried
[50:25] that's what it's telling us here
[50:28] our faith will be tried and that trial
[50:33] will be more precious than gold
[50:36] even though gold
[50:41] it will end it is
[50:53] our faith will be tried amen amen
[50:57] how many of you want to buy gold
[51:09] our faith will be tried yes
[51:36] surrender to me
[51:39] surrender to the Lord Jesus
[51:44] the goal that you need
[51:47] yes and that gold
[51:50] is
[52:01] mold our characters
[52:07] if everything was easy
[52:10] everyone would be successful
[52:14] it's hard
[52:33] greater and precious than gold itself
[52:38] scripture continues saying
[52:42] that or saying about that
[52:45] first Peter 4 12 says
[52:50] the word is so beautiful so tremendous
[52:52] is
[53:03] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[53:07] trial which is as though some strange
[53:11] thing happened unto you this is
[53:17] extra
[53:22] don't don't
[53:23] be awesome
[53:26] when the fiery Trials come
[53:29] don't let it be a strange thing unto you
[53:32] why
[53:34] because
[53:38] and those that want to buy gold
[53:40] that character
[53:43] what character of the word
[53:47] that's why James 1 2 tells us
[53:51] want to buy gold
[53:53] yeah
[53:55] very few one gold this is
[54:02] look at how hard this is
[54:09] when he fall into diverse Temptations
[54:16] how is this
[54:18] how will we be happy
[54:21] tells us
[54:24] about the next verse tells us
[54:50] I Surrender
[55:00] be the name of the Lord
[55:04] that's why we have trials and We
[55:07] complain is
[55:16] different levels
[55:18] we all have trials
[55:23] the trial you're in now yes it's
[55:34] it's
[55:48] what we need is
[55:59] nothing greater than Wicked overcome
[56:01] will come to us
[56:03] foreign
[56:25] we passed the rebuke
[56:29] then we are legitimate can you imagine
[56:33] this
[56:34] God is testing us
[56:37] it's testing everyone
[56:39] so get out of us
[56:42] what's inside of us
[56:46] we're going to be convinced are we going
[56:50] to take the test
[56:51] you want to buy gold
[56:55] forever
[56:58] [Laughter]
[57:01] the holy spirit
[57:04] will do exactly what he did with Jesus
[57:27] man
[57:28] okay
[57:30] you're scary
[57:42] rich in the Lord
[57:49] righteous in the Lord
[57:55] in God's blessings
[58:06] [Music]
[58:19] don't think of the riches here it
[58:21] reaches in the Lord
[58:23] comprador
[58:26] is
[58:35] Revelations 3 18 the second part
[58:38] with the goals
[58:40] with the riches
[58:46] white arrangement
[58:49] amen amen
[58:51] this is what the word tells us
[58:55] the second thing is
[59:11] but he wants us to be rich so we can buy
[59:13] the arraignment
[59:16] Isaiah 61-10 no this is
[59:20] why bester means
[59:42] I will greatly rejoicing the Lord and my
[59:44] soul shall be joyful and my Lord for he
[59:47] has clothed me with the garments of
[59:49] Salvation he has covered me with the
[59:52] Robes of righteousness as a bridegroom
[59:55] decking himself with ormonds and as a
[59:59] bride adoreth herself with the jewels
[1:00:02] how did he dress as well
[1:00:06] with garments of Salvation
[1:00:10] And The Robe of righteousness those
[1:00:15] that's what the word is telling us
[1:00:22] Revelations 1970. it's more clear more
[1:00:25] simple
[1:00:27] let us speak louder
[1:00:34] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:00:36] and his wife has hath made herself ready
[1:00:44] siente
[1:00:47] porque Lino
[1:00:49] yes
[1:00:56] clean and white for the fine linen is
[1:00:59] the righteousness of saints in English I
[1:01:03] like how it says in English
[1:01:06] but it tells us here clean and white
[1:01:10] Blanco
[1:01:12] okay
[1:01:13] it says here clean and white in English
[1:01:18] it's something that that shines
[1:01:21] it's white
[1:01:24] foreign
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:02:15] this is
[1:02:18] you understand
[1:02:20] the prophet tells us
[1:02:25] paragraph number two
[1:02:29] he's telling us about the scripture here
[1:02:34] the compressed vestibular as blank as
[1:02:37] the hell he said I can't so did you come
[1:02:40] and buy white arraignment from him
[1:02:47] the Bible say it said the white robes
[1:02:51] are righteous righteousness of saints
[1:02:54] why
[1:02:56] because we need to be dressed
[1:02:59] amen amen
[1:03:02] is
[1:03:08] Carlos
[1:04:31] the righteousness of the Saints
[1:04:34] this is the second thing now the third
[1:04:37] thing
[1:04:38] foreign
