[34:47] foreign
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] but it's been really hot
[35:32] also ignorant as well uh
[35:36] those
[35:37] um
[36:33] that's more than enough to be uh
[36:35] thankful about it
[36:37] [Music]
[36:39] I don't know how many have gone without
[36:40] air conditioning in the summer
[36:44] it's not something that's very pleasant
[36:53] [Music]
[36:54] it's something that's very uncomfortable
[36:58] it could even be dangerous
[37:01] in the heat waves that we get
[37:08] I don't know how many people you've seen
[37:09] who have pulled this out on the road
[37:10] because their car overheated
[37:14] and their phone shuts off because of how
[37:17] hot it is
[37:26] we're not complaints
[37:30] from the smallest things we have to be
[37:32] thankful to the Lord
[37:37] that'll start with a question
[37:40] how many are salty
[37:46] people already gave me your face and
[37:48] they say cross cross
[37:50] they're almost casting on me
[38:48] we're going to be moving forward
[38:53] are the salt of the earth
[38:56] Matthew 5 13. this is
[38:59] ye are the thoughts of the Earth
[39:03] but if the salt have lost
[39:06] where we shall be salted
[39:08] it is foreign
[39:44] things are changing a little bit more at
[39:46] least
[40:01] we are doing nothing with the words
[40:15] you have no interest in living
[40:24] [Music]
[40:32] that was its own opinion
[40:35] saying that it was rich
[40:37] and it was prosperous in the goods of
[40:41] the Earth
[40:46] control performer
[40:49] oh order now Nosotros customers we know
[40:54] that we're in the laureca age
[40:57] we have to understand we're not part of
[40:59] it
[41:02] is
[41:16] for the purpose to finish every Son of
[41:19] God
[41:24] foreign
[42:24] the price was paid for each one what an
[42:26] apocalypse is yes no in Revelations 10.
[42:28] [Music]
[42:29] it's the church
[42:32] where it's unveiled El Mysterio
[42:36] that had been hidden throughout time
[42:40] in that stage or that age
[42:52] where God sends an angel
[43:02] but now this book according to
[43:04] Revelations
[43:06] it's open in the hands of the Angels
[43:11] so now John has a conversation
[43:15] John is trying to have this conversation
[43:20] and the angel is showing Johnson
[43:22] then the time that we live
[43:26] we can no longer be Idols
[43:29] you have to get into action yes
[43:32] Revelation 10.
[43:35] it's a conjunction of principles
[44:13] the prophet says talking about this age
[44:18] wretched
[44:28] we've mentioned before that wretched
[44:30] means
[44:32] that comes from the etymology this is
[44:34] its roots in Greek
[44:37] which means we stand and trial
[44:41] a person that is
[44:48] [Music]
[44:53] a person that is
[44:58] to a blessed Christian
[45:01] in the time of Trials
[45:19] while he's going through the test
[45:23] Anton says so then the prophet says
[46:12] it doesn't mean that there is
[46:21] that we are sons of God
[46:34] will not determine
[47:35] that would live
[47:37] from the Romans
[47:41] that would deliver them and give them a
[47:43] better way to do things
[47:47] the religious rituals they left them
[47:49] from the gods
[47:51] the Roman oppression
[47:53] a depressed
[47:56] there was no exit for that people
[48:00] there was no way that they could do
[48:02] things right
[48:04] the situation in which they found
[48:06] themselves in
[48:07] Paris
[48:09] for them it was a miserable situation
[48:14] but then comes largest Christ and he
[48:16] begins
[48:28] because you cry
[48:32] you are blessed
[48:36] because you have had thirst and hunger
[48:41] you are blessed because you would be
[48:43] quenched
[48:44] at the end of the sermon
[48:55] he says Rejoice what is
[48:59] because great is our reward in the
[49:01] heavens
[49:03] so Jesus begins
[49:11] I elevation to a higher um atmosphere
[49:19] situation they found themselves
[49:22] and begin to elevate them to another
[49:24] atmosphere to another level
[49:27] because we always know this one problem
[49:32] it can't be solved
[49:35] at the same level in which it was
[49:37] created
[49:38] we want to solve it
[49:40] you have to go to a higher level
[49:44] so when Jesus begins to tell them
[49:46] [Music]
[49:49] are blessed
[49:52] and when he's giving them the beauty
[49:54] tutes
[49:56] he Compares him in verse 13 to salt
[50:00] salt
[50:05] it was something very valuable
[50:10] the word celery comes from the word salt
[50:14] because in that time they were paid
[50:17] the Roman soldiers
[50:22] it was with salts
[50:25] there was one called the Salt Tree
[50:30] which is where the salt was transported
[50:35] it was so important it was a salt road
[50:37] which is where the the salt was
[50:39] transported
[50:43] the Bible tells us in Ezra 7 22.
[50:48] this is
[50:50] at The Treasure of the king had uh salt
[50:54] without measures
[50:57] it mentions many things and among those
[50:59] things is salt
[51:11] you are valuable
[51:14] solos you feel alone
[51:21] you are
[51:24] the salt of the earth
[51:35] they knew how important
[51:40] and now Jesus tells them ye are the
[51:42] thoughts of the earth you have a lot of
[51:45] value
[51:46] the salt
[51:49] they even provoked Wars
[51:54] Jesus
[51:57] so Jesus was trying to change their
[51:59] attitude
[52:05] about themselves
[52:26] because you thirst and hunger foreign
[52:48] the keys
[52:52] the keys
[52:59] the blessings
[53:02] now he began to speak to them
[53:07] you're not only the salts of the earth
[53:09] you're the light of the world
[53:31] only gives certain rights to the
[53:33] Pharisees
[53:36] totally and Jesus says I have not come
[53:38] to remove the Lord
[53:40] came to change the law but rather
[53:42] fulfilling
[53:44] the Fulfillment of the law was in the
[53:46] Lord Jesus Christ
[53:50] so then Jesus was trying to change the
[53:52] way in which they thought
[53:55] he began to change their attitude
[53:57] giving them values
[54:01] when he gave him the value that they had
[54:04] Allah
[54:13] in Heavens
[54:16] he told him about um
[54:19] Muslim a charity
[54:22] this is
[54:28] anxiety
[54:34] and he told them
[54:40] his door
[54:51] [Music]
[54:54] doesn't speak like the Pharisees no no
[54:59] so people were admiring his Doctrine
[55:02] foreign
[56:01] it wasn't just for the Pharisees
[56:11] adoration
[56:52] can be restored
[56:58] be present for the pardon of our sins
[57:09] what was the way to entrance
[57:13] were the principles that we had to
[57:15] activate
[57:16] to activate
[57:18] and the authority this Kingdom has
[57:23] that's what Jesus was teaching
[57:29] so when Jesus speaks about the salt
[57:33] uh
[57:34] we focus a little bit on this
[57:39] aware we begin to see
[57:45] that salts
[57:47] it has natural uses
[57:51] it says ye are the salt of the earth
[57:55] significance
[57:57] spiritual meaning behind salt
[58:03] it's necessary for us too the natural
[58:06] elements
[58:09] in the way they're applied spiritually
[58:11] speaking
[58:14] do you understand why Jesus said he or
[58:16] the salts of the Earth
[58:23] in that time
[58:27] one of the most important
[58:29] characteristics of this element is
[58:44] it stops with the composition of a food
[58:47] is
[58:53] being important to the life of men
[58:56] that's why in the time
[59:00] important to the Roman Empire
[59:07] they could preserve their meats and
[59:09] their fish
[59:14] it was very relevant in economic and
[59:17] social aspect
[59:20] Ed
[59:22] they had a great interest in commercial
[59:25] use
[59:26] for having these qualities
[59:29] it was a good seasoning
[59:31] it was a preserver
[59:37] is it causes thirst
[59:40] and it also has medicinal properties
[59:44] as medicinal properties
[59:47] and let's see each one of these
[59:52] salt as seasoning
[59:56] ye are the salt of the earth
[59:59] is
[1:00:19] flour tortillas but they taste even
[1:00:21] better with flour tortillas yes
[1:00:26] how many have eaten beans without salt
[1:00:30] they taste bad
[1:00:34] looks
[1:00:39] one of the things I remember most about
[1:00:41] my childhood of food that I ate that I
[1:00:42] can remember the most
[1:00:44] it was a bowl of beef
[1:00:48] with flour tortillas
[1:00:51] in a really hot coffee
[1:00:56] it stayed in my mind that's something I
[1:00:58] remember
[1:00:59] and my mouth begins to water
[1:01:04] foreign
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:02:06] now you have a really good dish
[1:02:11] is getting hungry
[1:02:18] so then salt gives good flavor
[1:02:22] Nosotros we have to understand
[1:02:26] that salt as seasoning
[1:02:30] it gives a good flavor
[1:02:35] it has to pass through fire
[1:02:39] so it gives that flavor to the food
[1:02:43] the beans have to be hot
[1:02:49] beans with the perfect temperature
[1:02:58] 49 sorry for everyone shall be salted
[1:03:02] and every sacrifice shall be salted
[1:03:06] salt is good
[1:03:09] but if the salt has lost it
[1:03:12] work with ye seasoning
[1:03:16] have salt in yourselves
[1:03:26] not only to be salted
[1:03:29] foreign
[1:04:45] that's when you have to add the flavor
[1:04:47] foreign
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:50] has
[1:07:47] but the trial does not mean that God is
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:33] all our lives
[1:08:36] you know can you imagine
[1:08:39] before God
[1:08:42] this doesn't have salts
[1:08:48] now how does God react when our life has
[1:08:50] no flavor
[1:08:52] and why doesn't our life have any flavor
[1:08:55] because the trials and the battles come
[1:08:57] you
[1:08:58] know and we don't want to face them
[1:09:01] we feel defeated
[1:09:03] we feel that God doesn't listen to me
[1:09:17] to share his blood foreign
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:43] I want to say I am the salt of the earth
[1:09:49] that means
[1:09:57] so what's going on in my life
[1:10:20] when I bring my sacrifice to church
[1:10:26] it should be based on emotions or
[1:10:28] feelings no sir
[1:10:32] today I don't feel like singing
[1:11:09] glory to God
[1:11:25] that's what the song says man amen
[1:11:29] we have to give glory to God
[1:11:34] pick that song and turn it into a
[1:11:36] personal experience
[1:11:39] and when we are salted
[1:11:44] we give flavor to our life
[1:11:50] we also give flavor to the life of
[1:11:52] others
[1:11:59] let's give them a little bit of flavor
[1:12:01] in their life give a little bit of
[1:12:03] thoughts we're gonna give him some salt
[1:12:06] we gave him a little bit of salt
[1:12:10] expectations
[1:12:18] it says God
[1:12:22] is
[1:12:24] those who bring flavor to the world
[1:12:35] the strength in the church
[1:12:39] the strength in the church
[1:12:43] it comes when we put flavor
[1:12:47] we add flavor to our life
[1:12:55] we have flavor in our life we give
[1:12:57] flavor to the world
[1:13:00] and that strengthens the church
[1:13:03] that strengthens the church
[1:13:08] Hermanos
[1:13:11] we'll be talking with the ushers
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:22] so when somebody goes into those doors
[1:13:24] they can come like this
[1:13:27] that means that they're lacking salt
[1:13:31] so if the one at the door is salted
[1:13:34] brother
[1:13:38] I'm happy to see you
[1:13:45] the prophet says for some people that is
[1:13:47] the greatest blessing that they will
[1:13:48] receive
[1:13:50] perception that will change all their
[1:13:52] perceptions
[1:14:00] there was a contact with the spirit of
[1:14:02] the other person which woke them up
[1:14:05] and now the musicians are salted
[1:14:09] they're going to enter into the presence
[1:14:10] of the Lord
[1:14:14] and they're not going to say what am I
[1:14:16] going to play right now
[1:14:17] no they will be prepared they're going
[1:14:20] to be salted
[1:14:26] the spirit of God will begin to move
[1:14:29] and one who is
[1:14:32] the Holy Spirit right away
[1:14:36] because someone who assaulted is
[1:14:39] bringing a sacrifice
[1:14:45] and believe me when you say something
[1:14:49] I don't know if you've ever done that
[1:14:51] yourself if you're a little saltier
[1:14:53] salted
[1:14:56] you identify the taste
[1:15:04] it is
[1:15:34] foreign
[1:16:43] as well
[1:16:46] yes brother
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:46] of the fight
[1:18:45] show me who I am and where I'm standing
[1:18:47] foreign
[1:19:28] what do I go
[1:19:30] but there's something else the scripture
[1:19:32] says that salt
[1:19:36] is
[1:19:40] it becomes insipid
[1:19:44] salts
[1:19:46] it can become insipid or Bland
[1:19:49] the word insipid
[1:19:54] it's lack of flavor
[1:19:58] it doesn't have the taste that it should
[1:20:00] have or it could have
[1:20:02] you see I wanna
[1:20:06] in another allegoric way is
[1:20:10] lack of spirit
[1:20:12] lack of liveliness
[1:20:14] or lack of Grace
[1:20:18] that's an insipid person
[1:20:23] that has projected
[1:20:27] they have turned into an insipid person
[1:20:31] and God calls him
[1:20:37] because they have not maintained himself
[1:20:39] firm
[1:20:41] we say brother well I failed well
[1:20:45] the blood Jesus Christ is
[1:20:50] the person that gives up is the person
[1:20:52] that stops trying
[1:20:57] to talk about talking about Thomas Abba
[1:20:59] Edison
[1:21:01] when he finally found
[1:21:04] what he was looking for how to light up
[1:21:09] how to bring that electricity
[1:21:12] and to light up through that bulb
[1:21:23] the Son of God that is
[1:21:26] they never give up
[1:21:28] they never give up
[1:21:31] I wish I once again
[1:21:33] later they will hit that Target
[1:21:37] the problem is
[1:21:57] for you
[1:21:59] soon
[1:22:06] firm on the word of God
[1:22:31] when a person becomes insipid in their
[1:22:34] spiritual life
[1:22:37] what captures them is a spirit of
[1:22:39] bitterness
[1:22:42] the word of God says in Hebrews 12 15.
[1:22:46] okay
[1:22:49] to be diligent
[1:22:53] unless any man fail of the grace of God
[1:22:58] unless any root of bitterness bringing
[1:23:00] up trouble
[1:23:02] the root of bitterness comes from a
[1:23:04] disappointment
[1:23:06] of an unfulfilled promise
[1:23:09] many times we blame God
[1:23:13] because there's been a promise that has
[1:23:15] not been fulfilled
[1:23:18] many times we blame the people who are
[1:23:20] out
[1:23:24] we make constant excuses to justify our
[1:23:26] current situation
[1:23:30] the husband makes an excuse for why he
[1:23:33] acts a certain way towards his wife
[1:23:36] the wife makes excuses to why she acts a
[1:23:38] certain way towards her husband this boy
