TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do this and don't you do that you can't do this and that and Satan said oh you know but she turned around and listened to him but the Eve in the last days not going to do it because she predestinated not to do it God's going to do it he knows he'll have he said his spot church will be there without spot or a wrinkle she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word made manifest she'll be a token to the world she'll be she'll be something to the world the world can look and say well the rest of world say ah she's a Holy Roller she's the second cousin she don't belong to our group I know that's good thing she belongs to this group up here a man said in the day to me stand talking said well what denomination do you belong to I said none what none I said I belong to a kingdom why is not only equal why is not only equal with God he was God himself see they don't get it by the way some of you might I've heard infidels one time told me that Jesus never did say he was the son of God he sure did you certainly did you just don't know your Bible what did you say the woman at the well that's right what did he tell her I know Messiah cometh and when he comes he'll do these things he said I'm he speaks to you and to Paul also in different one notice but now the church has the prous God's Great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand it Satan don't understand it none the rest of them understands it but just those who are predestinated to understand it how God and Christ are one they'll make him three every time they certainly will notice next secondly the manifested Christ in you the hope of glory that great manifested God in Christ now Christ manifested in you we'll hurry look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer that is the body of Christ what was God's once great Secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest oh I'm sure we don't we don't get it well I I can't sit the way off to and and I'm sure you don't see but God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and give it right down to his church what was once in God's Minds now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church's bride whispered secrets to her you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're go to Mary you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love you and everything you know how it is that's what God Christ is doing to the church see he's letting know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wives all right now look by having the revelation of a secret made known to them by his grace how the grace of God people I know it I hope you don't think this sounds personal to a bunch of people or this that but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it see it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church that he he's trying to get into it and you say well why don't they receive it they can't receive it he said again he said these things and how could it because Isaiah said they can't see it see and he's always said the prophet Paul said in the last days that people will be he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truth Breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good heady High minded see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such Turnal way for this is a kind that goes from house to house and leads silly women Lay It Away with divers lust with shorts and bobbed hair and everything else let it away with divers lust and say it's all right oh they're crazy out there don't see never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and these men resistant and the jambers and jamers which stood Moses able to produce a church and produce a group of people just but their hly will be made manifest when Jesus takes his bride and sets her up here and said this is her and away he goes your Folly will be made look at having the revelation of this secret made known to them by his grace look when this great Revelation revealed mystery is made known to you then you denounce all the things of the world Amen now I'm going to come back once again I might as well say I'm pointing to it the tape sake and those that are going across this tape goes across the world see you women Acclaim you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and not the osity to let your hair grow out when the Bible condemns it and said a woman a man's got a right to put away his wife and divorce if she Bobs her hair honored before God to do so the Bible say she cuts her hair she dishonors her head and it's a common this know what Ain old common thing is for a woman to even pray with bob hair wearing shorts and these slacks and things the Bible said any woman that all you say they put on a garment that pertains to a man it's an Abomination to God filthy dirty like an old stinking bathroom somewhere see oh my the filth in God's nostrils and then you try to pray or offer up prayers and such a thing as that God refuses and turns it away hallah what you say now wait a minute brother BR you're talking about the Old Testament he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a full revelation of God God ever says anything he can ever change it he all magnifies it not change it the law was magnified not changed magnified whosoever commits adultery shall be guilty of death but whosoever now magnified look us upon a woman to lust after her he never changed the Commandment he magnified remember the Sabbath they keep it holy one day in the week now he magnified it oh rest comes from keeping the spirit of God precept upon precept and line upon line here a little and there a little hold fast that what's good for with stammer lips and other tongues will I speak to this people and that is the rest that's a refreshing from the presence of the Lord yet they would not hear it and WIP their heads and walked away through their denominations MH this is the refreshing the magnifying the Sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so forth oh my you don't change you magnifies it hell is spread our gates to receive them now you can see now the end time message why it's rejected can you now no denomination but the revelation of his mystery see no denomination the Revelation God's not knowing denomination he's known by Revelation look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and is God took from the body of Adam the woman and she fell then God has took from the body of Christ he flesh his body which is his word as bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination Creed no sir but she's coming back with a pure un adulter word of God being manifested I hope every man that hears this tape and every woman will understand that she a second Eve but she's not breaking and and spotting her skirts of Purity and Holiness to her husband she'll stay with his word regardless of what anybody said you can have all the economical moves you want to and all the affiliations and your go to bring a persecution on pretty soon and shut up all the churches you see that and churches like this who's not denomination they'll use them for Storehouse and if any man goes and offer a prayer for anybody else that don't belong to the economic movement be shot on the spot amen so already that Luther Minister the head of it right here read it right here in your magazine right don't make any difference what they say that church will stand true in she's already proved it back down and she'll do it again in the face of everything it's a word of God and let all eal movements and everything else be gone she's going to be there without spot or wrinkle right she'll stand there notice God manifested himself in his body Christ now you see the threefold beautiful thing Christ in his body the church vindicating his promised word like God did to Christ who can condemn me sin if I do not the works of the father and where I where have I failed now you fellas say that you're doing you denomination now now show me show me where I failed to be the Messiah show where I failed on one sign that God said the Messiah do it I haven't fulfilled it he said God in his body now Christ The Works that I do shall you do all see see the same God see the works that I do shall you do also more than this for I go unto my father the church will be a little longer than life see vindicating his promised word as God did his promises in Christ's body so is Christ doing his same Works in Christ body the church see now making his mystery KN to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning watch the tree puts forth a branch a Lutheran what did he do when the tree started coming up here come the fruit coming up with it what happened they denominate it so the pruner come by the father with husbandman and cut it off so it's dead up come the wesling you're done fine coming up what did he do the fruit went right back into the tree again so he cut the vine off and dead show me one one church I want to know I've got 33 years of church history show me one time one place where any church ever organized that didn't die on the spot show me one place ever rolls again outside just numbers and things not a Revival see it's not there not that she's all gone so what did hus do come by and pruned it it brought forth denominational fruit lemons on an orange tree so he pruned it off brought it for it on but where is the heart of the tree right in the middle and he pruned them all down but right in the top he's got a seed down here in the root like a tree that's PL by the rivers of water he that takes God's laws and love in his heart and he shall be like a tree Psalms 1 plain by the rivers of water his leaves shall not Wither in his season he'll bear his fruit and here it is right where is the fruit right at quickly in top of the tree why the lights on it amen that's right and right in the top of the tree in this last days he's bringing forth a bride tree now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he's that seed the woman seed the Tree of Life In The Garden andless they put forth their hands and move this tree they'd eat that tree and live forever and he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life amen and that be the word the word of God which Eve turned down in the Garden of Eden then here's Christ the word made manifest and when he come on Earth he was the Tree of Life do you believe that and Rome what did they do he had to be chopped down and he was put on a tree of disgrace cursed is he the hang on tree become a curse for the human race and now through that he brings forth a brid tree which will be the Tree of Life restored back to him his husband and wife in the garden glory to God by the same word the same God made manifest in Hallelujah the same bride tree back again no making it knowing oh my there's just so much here we can just keep on going notice this tree of Christ body in the garden making now making his mystery knowing to this brid tree watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam you believe he was going back home to Eden with his fall and wife redeem back home again that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see a three-fold mystery now God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church all together to bring back original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and Same Spirit and everything else the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because of the life is in the blood that's the baptism of holy ghost that baptizes us into his body that recogn is only his body his flesh his word denomination won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did he know it but she fell but this knows it it won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah to not fall she won't fail she's predestin blessed is a man who God will not impute sin Hallelujah you ministers know what I'm speaking know couple dozen of you sitting here blessed is the man who God will not impute sin David notice redeeming back with him going home back to eternal life in a human body eating drinking living forever Isaiah said they build houses and inhabit them plant beers eat the fruit they're not build in another ticket the children won't take it but they'll be there with their offsprings you'll build it and stay there amen he don't build another eat he builds an eats himself amen what is it his bride going back with him redeemed back to the original Adam and Eve again for death has left behind they look back at the cross and see the death has been PID and now by faith we are resurrected with him amen sitting in Heavenly places right now looking back to what redeemers waiting for the husband to come to march on home with him Hallelujah three whole purpose of God manifested in Adam and Eve and ever profit and down Through the Ages and he that is to come yeah he that was he which is he which is to come the whole manifestation of the revelation of the word of God Adam and Eve going back

comes in this healing will be for these leaves will be for the healing of the Nations the king shall bring your honor into it there will be nothing that can defile or anything ever enter in M will have a light on her all day and night and the redeemed shall walk in that life oh Hallelujah think it's not a mythical story it's not some theological conception it's a revelation of Jesus Christ by his word which is out shine and been true in all ages and it's true in this age it's true here now it's true with me it's true with you and every man and woman a hold his Revelation Hallelujah and see God himself making himself know ulating himself through the life that you're a prisoner to him now you are his love prisoner the world can laugh make fun of him say come on out you could go but you're a prisoner the other women can act Hollywood but not you you're a prisoner amen you're a prisoner to Christ other man can smoke and drink and carry on want to and call themselves Christians deacons and even preachers but not you you're a prisoner prisoner to the world yes sir yes sir making his mystery know to his bridegroom Redeemed by Christ the second Adam going back home to be restored back to the original Ed free from Death sickness sorrow shame going back with eternal life then listen so many people's got the wrong conception the the to convert people to Christianity and to its government is not God's thought at all you say we made converts to Christianity by his government that's not it well well they're not supposed to drink they're not supposed to lie you know the muhammads can outshine you you know the heathens in Africa that black man they got laws among their tribes to outshine anything you can Bruce in Christianity why I went to that tribe of shunga there if a young girl isn't married by a certain age she has to leave the leave the tribe take off her tribal paint she goes into the city she's just a arest about and if she before she's married she has to be tested for a virgin and she be found guilty of committing adultery with some man he she has to tell who it is and they're both killed together well they can they can outshine what these so-call what if you did that in of so-called Christians 99% of them die before daylight right both men and women you know that's right watch don't you say well I'm pure whoo ever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart already what about that what about you sister that presented yourself that man like that you're just as guilty as if you did it oh but it's all right pastor's afraid to say that cuz why his denominational headquarters will kick him out if he gets straight on that they're hybrid they don't take the word the word said that's true Jesus said it's true and he's the head now notice god making his self- knowing not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government but by the Revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you what what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you am oh isn't that beautiful oh my I like that Jesus said at that day that's this day at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I'm in the father and the father is in me then when the Revelation comes forth then it's I and you and you and me there you are see the manifold three-fold man what far to bring it back we've got to be as Jesus was the word of God he Vindicated the same If he if he was the word he wouldn't have made manifest the word he'd have been some great Theologian that would have been the real Messiah the world was looking for yes sir that would been him that's what they're looking for today some some somebody can exceed Billy Graham or somebody can SM down with their organization come up and show them Baptist don't know where they're standing sure they're looking for that but the church is looking for the humility and the signs of the Living God Christ amen Jesus wasn't a great Theologian he was a common peasant a cartender son so-called he walked around but God he said some of you show me what the Bible says that I will do that I have it manifest so the church can do the same thing today what Christ did so does the church do now that day you'll know that I am in the father and the father's in me I in you and you in me marching on to Z the word the Kingdom at that day you will know that I'm in you and watch here here's beautiful I don't want you to miss this now everybody you people on tape out in the jungles and wherever you hear it now listen and and as the father has sent me so send I you Jesus said now watch the father that sent him went in him to vindicate himself right for he was the word and the same Jesus the Same Jud goes with you and in you to vindicate the same God as the father has sent me and I live by the father so I send you and you live by me what is he he's the word you live by the word oh how I like take a text on that preach now for about a couple hours on on that how on that notice notice and the father that sent me went with him the father that sends the Jesus s es goes in a little while and the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for I personal pronoun I the person Jesus will be with you even in you to the end of the world Hallelujah the works that I do shall you do also now go back and see what he done then see what you do then compare yourself and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man and as the days of lot when a modern Billy Graham old Roberts went down into Sodom and preached to them sodomites and blinded their eyes see with the gospel one Angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham and the elected group and what kind of a sign did he do see GL and what did Abraham call Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days oh my my there no end to it just a revelation of God it's Eternal just keeps moving on and on and on notice then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now Christ the second Adam in life redeems his bride from death and now on his way back to the original Eden restoring back his bride and fellowship back with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden Christ and his bride God at that day the kingdom be given the father he might be all in all while he's just speaking out here David Christ David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race and while they're yet thinking I don't know what they're thinking about for they speak I'll answer them the wolf and the lamb shall feed together shall eat straw like a block they shall feed together and lay down there all my Holy Mountain right back exactly to Eden again as hard as it can go there's his threefold purpose oh God help us to know it help us to know it listen closely now again as we go on going back to the original Eden then when we are born of him we are filled with him see your life his life is in you then all our actions should declare him like taking taking life out of one tree and putting it into another taking life out of a pear tree and put in an apple tree bear pears God to cause a sap life in it the germ it's par treat all right then all of our actions should declare him we have his name that right yes we should bear his name and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his Spirit Hallelujah the church bearing children pregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the pinises evidence of his resur resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forever more this is eternal life and a Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you're a church member because Christ is living through you so pregnated with his spirit that you you're prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth is that course you're a prisoner you can't commit adultery you're already pregnated it can't take a h the womb of life is closed anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life no world can get in GL Glory oh how we'd like to stay on this for about an hour I'm sure you understand Christ and his alone already finished the seed was there Hallelujah the seed was already when was put there before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as a lifegiving flow that seed laying there other seeds that just would come in wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it like but when that seed come in quickly it stopped up the womb all the rest of the seed was drove out see like that and you become a prisoner surrounded in Christ Christ in you his life bringing forth his evidence his signs oh my look bringing his signs of life as an evident of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we are alive in him and think of it alive with God Our Redeemer who created us for the very same purpose the church and his creative life in us that is Moses said by the word of God let there come and there come flies a God can make flies can make squirrels God the very same God that creative life you see that's in you can you're a prisoner you can't speak it to he says speak it but when you spoke it's God's word he's a Vindicated to be so everything else is right he knows when that's spoke it's got to be so hey Moses took his rod and said let there come frogs because God said let there come frogs he just transmitted on out that's right and frogs is everything everywhere was frogs where did it come from nobody knows it wasn't there before but the Creator God working through a Man created things a living species the very God that made the first frog to make the second frog he makes all frogs all my you see what I mean made the first squirrel makes the second squirrel make any squirrel they makees squirrels where there is no squirrels he can do anything he wants to he's God hallelujah God his life oh my I think of it makes me sh oh to live with him going home with him to live with him going home with him to live with him forever having eternal life this is God's great mystery of Love Express that God and man became one see the whole thing is God and man one God and man was one there God in man is one here what is it being filled with his Spirit him having the premises that was God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together one the Holy Spirit same thing it revealed it to Christ reveals it here the supernatural creative power oh my the same God that could that could say to Moses let there come frogs the same one could said this water be turned to Wine amen amen amen that right the same God the same one you just don't change it's God in man that's his manifestation that's what he's revealing that's what he's trying to do in God's Own word reveal that shows that man cannot create God's a Creator it ain't man no more it's God the Creator in man which is his church now amen going home to heaven to live with him ever God Express his eternal love to the church listen listen close now I want you not to fail to get this no other Church Church no other sign no other Fellowship no other government no other testimony no other Creed no denomination is accepted outside of this God accepts nothing else but that Christ in you the hope of glory amen the only thing that God recognizes no Fellowship no church no Creed no denomination no nothing everything else is dead it's fragments has to be cut off pruned off away from the thing that Christ might live with premises in you not referring back I got one limb here it says it's my organization that's got to be cut off too I got my sword so here that says this my mother will tell me I'm a Holy Roller that's got to be cut off too well I know my husband wants me to wear these shorts that's got to be cut off too see it's got to be cut off and pruned till it just you and Christ Alone think by the living presence of the living Christ by the living word oh the living Christ Living presence Living Word watch by his own personal personal AB indication Cruise his church not members he never done the days of Moses he never done it in the days of anybody else at the end of the world when he come to the place where was in destruction the days of lck he wasn't membership is personal Vindication God and flesh personal Vindication remember think of it that people born of his spirit in a day like this in this great denominational age that we live and the Living God takes his Living Word and and vindicates it personally the life that's in the word The Germ that's in the seed and the word is a seed that door went forth the soul and the life is Christ in the word personally in you vindicating something that you cannot do proving himself that it's not you but it's him and you become one of uh a love slave to individ Hallelujah thanks be to the Living God who created the Heaven and Earth no wonder he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending that was which isn't shall come the root and offspring of David the bright and The Morning Star he's all and all his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that not with the Methodist not with the Baptist not the pr

upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divid the light

all the blesss everything that God has is that what you desire for the person shom so Shalom to everyone this this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord like to thank our pastor for the opportunity he finds himself out of town he's in the country of Peru so let's continue praying for him so that God may continue to strengthen him because it's a lot of work that has to be done and after being out for so long brother doesn't matter how nice the hotel may there's nothing like lying down in your own bed and whether he's here or he's out of town we're always going to keep him and maintain him in prayer because that's what was needed what we want one for the other but always for our pastor to have them in our prayers he's been he's a monument tested by [Music] time so I believe that we are under the shadow of a of a standing firm of a pillar that's a privilege before continue I'd like to greet our brothers who are in Iowa they're currently watching us last weekend our brother [Music] Alfredo our brotherz were there visiting them so their visit was a great blessing to them so happy because of that the result of the visit was that two people got baptized Manuel Sanchez Manuel Sanchez de so we' like to thank God for that we're gonna give round Applause to our brothers they made the decision to get baptized we thank we're grateful for the word they the work they and we thank God for these two people who made such an important decision R I like to greet our brother in s l Rio currently find himself there at this moment with his favorite uh brother-in-law I mean son-in-law with his favorite son-in-law I was thinking of Pablo when I said that with brother Nate he's there [Music] supporting it's a pleasure that they're also doing the work of God in that area let us continue we've been speaking on is the spoken word is the Original Seed it's a very beautiful topic of our brothers have spoken have done an excellent job each one has taken it from a different way perspective they've brought it and has been a blessing to each one of us we can only take just a small part of what was told to us and apply it to our hearts I believe it would be a great blessing to our lives so let us continue with that speakit what God has placed in our hearts before continue I also like to thank the musicians when the worship was going on I came back there with the young man to gave them the presentation and so I can see the way the spirit of God moves a lot has to do with the musicians being in harmony that the spirit of God can come and take control so the musicians have to be in their position they have to be in their position they have to know what God called them for and know that they are also an instrument of God brother shows us that God heals through music [Music] there has to be a Harmony between the musicians and sad that the spirit begin to and starts doing the work so I believe they're a fundamental part of the worship to our Lord Jesus Christ so I'd like to thank the musicians the reason is because they make quite the effort don't think that they just get here and they just start [Music] playing Harmony doesn't come through coincidence or work of magic it's something that has to be worked on in order to be able to be accomplished all that partake extra they're making an extra effort they practice throughout the week at home they get here together on Tuesdays and on Saturdays and they're constantly practicing to be able to make a better service I appreciate the musicians all the work they do in their [Music] efforts have so much experience experience maybe they can play their instrument with their eyes closed or eyes shut I don't to feel old but by the time I was born they were already playing an instrument but they're always here some experience they could just say well I don't need to practice but practice is what brings Excellence practice is what makes the master or teacher so the worst mistake that a person that does not practice can make is to trust in their own gift because if a person does not want to practice and they want to provide a service to God and they trust in their own gift then they're trusting on their own wisdom but when a person practices and they enter in harmony with those part of the team so they're no longer relying on one they're relying on the gift of the Holy Spirit that's the only one can bring in harmony all together of all the participants of a project to be able to reach a goal top this is all part of it spoken word is the Original Seed my yoke is easy we've been speaking on this Matthew 11:28 come on to me the labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in hearts and you shall find rest unto your souls my yoke is easy and my burden is light my yoke is easy if we are heavy laden or labored making towards us but this is an invitation in order to accept it is up to you it's volunt no one can obligate Us in the age which we live in the age of Le the most religious age but yet it's the darkest age the worst age has existed amongst time this this age has Jesus on the outside and Jesus is knocking he's knocking on the door so he can come inside but the age thinks that they know it all Revelations 320 and forward it's cold it's naked it's Naked and Afraid and not not it thinks that it lacks nothing it thinks that it is Rich when it is good in worldly things but not in spiritual Goods in the midst of all this confusion in the midst of all this age so dark that sometimes we don't know what to do there is an enemy there's an enemy that comes and speaks to our minds is trying to to push us to do certain things that go against the word in this age brother bam has told us he's never preached to such a tired people as in this many times we don't have the strength to serve the Lord we have the strength to pray we stay asleep we're stressed we have anxiety we have nervousness what we eat it's causing us um an an unbalance hormonal imbalance our own food it's causing us to have emotional problems let me tell you once again the food is causing us to have emotional problems the emotional instability it's causing us to have spiritual problems because the body has to have a union with the spirit the prophet says that we are three Soul spirit and body and they're all connected when the spirit has the thoughts affects our body in which way through chemical discharge when one feels happy there's something that releases a chemical or hormone that bra which is serotonin that's the hormone of happiness and M tent is the one where your circadian rhythm where you sleep it's the Circadian Ry that maintains a certain time begins when the sun rays hit your the pupil of your eyes they send an order to your brain by a certain amount of time you'll be awake and you will also fall asleep at a certain time so when your body receives that light so melatonin which is the hormone for you to fall asleep it's already program so that by a certain time it could go into action and that's when you're going to get sleepy that's what's normal it starts to get dark you already know the Melatonin comes forth before you know you're sitting down on the couch and you're already snoring well those that snore I know there's a lot that don't snore it's happens I wake myself up with my own snores even though my wife says that I don't snore but but that's the way our body works but the the enemy has a purpose to bring an unbalance to Our Lives Many Times using our cell phone you know that when you use your cell phone we break that cycle the Melatonin had to come forth at a certain time but the light is hitting our eyes when the brain saying wait hold on I was supposed to send for M but now all this light is coming in that light only comes forth when the sun comes out the screen from our screens is this light from our screen is hting our eyes it's sending a sign to our brain way why are you going to sleep that's telling us that's not time to go to sleep yet then later our tablet or our television and the next day we're tired and we're walking around like this then afterwards we hear the message we listen to the word and it tell us that we have to pray and we're too tired because we already lost balance I want to pray but I can't pray I would like to pray but I'm just too tired and maybe it's because we're watching a Christian movie at 10 p.m. or 11: p.m. when it was it was time that we should be resting because the body restored itself when it rests the body has the power to heal itself God has placed that power within the body but the body needs time in order to restore and heal itself and that's the last thing we want to give our bod it's time for it to rest the only way the body Resto itself is sleeping and there's some of us that go to the other would you want to spend all the time sleeping what were you doing well I was asleep that's good no problem how come you didn't get doing is I was asleep we also can't be sleeping all the time we have to be alert we have to be awake we're living in we have to be awake that's why the Lord Jesus come unto me all you labor and I will give you rest the rest that we're looking for is physical the Lord Jesus Christ is speaking to us about is trility that it needs the confidence that God gave a prom God will fulfill it I want to know that God is listening tends to my prayer in order to get to that level go higher to a level level to understand God's plan absorbed by the age of understand God's plan in our lives that's why we need to know where we're living the age we live in analyze the age because God has a plan for us in the darkest age the most religious age God sent his best soldiers this is the darkest age and God sent you for what to bring the light to undo the works of the devil how am I going to do this we're going to rest in Jesus rest in him attend to I'm going to obey what he says now uh now Jesus invites us to take upon his yoke and he ask us to learn from him and he tell us to be meek and lowly in heart that's the requirement for us in order to be able to find rest for our souls in order to find rest in my soul I have to be meek and lowly heart lowly in heart and meek meek and lowly in heart meek meek not dumb Meek and humble or lowly in heart being humble it's one of the most difficult things to do in the age we live in being humble why because one of the things that we have seen and one of the things that the the enemy has taken charged in order to do is to twist or mix up the concepts the concepts that help us understand the concepts that help us and allow us to have that Revelation for example this is the age of the vior this is the age of the overcomer it's the age of overcoming but what does it mean to overcome well overcome means wrestling and fighting other wrestlers old school wrestlers now you know what I'm talking about I don't even know the names of the new are Mexican wrestlers boxers as well J perhaps Julio Chavez that's as far as I can but when they win the battle or the fight they lift up their hand they have to wait until the end of the fight in order to lift up their hands when they lifted their hands that's who won the one with his hand lift up that's the one who won we have to wait until the end of the fight if the thing is even or if he knocks him out well then we know automatically who [Music] won but in wrestling it's the [Music] same and that is what we think a battle or a fight the wins the one who's standing the one who's on the floor without tee I up and he and the other one says I won but the prophet comes and clarifies what the concept of overcoming is and he says that overcoming is to withstand the test he's not saying wait for the test to be for to be victorious wait wait for God to answer for try to be over the CR over and that was good way too late many times many times where we Waits celebrate a victory it it causes us to be in defeat let me tell you once again many times waiting to celebrate a victory is what produces defeat the prophet told us to overcome is to stand test if I'm in a test understanding the test that means that I'm an overcomer hard the fight is B the age is dark I have problems in my life I see everything as negative but then I go to the word that God always answers our prayers at the right time to go to a higher level leave the influence of Lady o into the atmosphere of the word word in order to be the word tells me father in his name he will do then I will start to pray I'm going to pray nothing happens I'm going to lift up my hand as a Victorious because you have given me the victory it's still not reflected yet I'm withing the test I the test what makes me Victorious I'm not going to wait God answers to celebrate my victory I'm going to celebrate it while I'm in the battle while I'm in the tri I'm going to worship God lift my hands up I'm going to give him thanks he already answered my prayer and when I do that my spirit enters into another dimension I don't go up not literally I enter into another dimension I see things in a different way the Revelation no longer limit me to physical things me see the kingdom spiritual Kingdom when I enter in the spiritual world I can see God in the throne interceding for me the prophet said what the Lord Jesus Christ doing he's interceding why for each thing that I confess that is already done when he's there interceding for me that I speak the word that I go in prayer he takes my prayer takes it to Calvary he he mixes it up with his blood he presents it before the father and it says here it is here's your son and it's determined time he will answer if what I do is get into action and within the reach of God God's rest it's not idleness it's not being not moving entering in action because Jesus's yoke he didn't say he say I will take your burden said my burden is lights you have to carry it my yoke is easy and burning is light that's a concept of an overcomer what about humility being humble God bless you God bless you the brother so humble he even leaned over AOW to greet me he's so humble look at the shoes he's wearing he has a hole in his shoes he's so humble humility has nothing to do with your appearance you have to dress the best you can best that you can the best now the best you have are holes in your shoes and don't worry about then that's the best that you can but humility doesn't have to do with the way you dress yourself the prophet comes and he clears up the concept of humility and he say that humility is to surrender your rights forit your rights in this age everybody is claiming their rights I have the right to do this I have the right to do that I have the right to believe that I am a dog I have the right to believe that I am a cat well if you're a cat then I'm going to give you a cat for let's see if you're really eat it so then the anointing of Leia comes and wants to make us think and it PES us to believe that humility has to do with appear or a certain Behavior hum how much you can surrender your rights to the word whaton humil is so important in the day that we are living in in this time that we live in it's in the age when the Mysteries have been opened came to unravel itself when there was no one that was worthy to open up that book where the Mysteries were written there was no one worthy which meant it was judgment for Humanity but when it looked like there was no hope looking he knew what was written in that book of those Mysteries was the book of Redemption where the names of all those were written for which Lord Jesus Christ has given his life up for God had a plan looking at and there was no one worthy one of the elders said Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah Behold The Lion John knew the representation of the lion the lion by its characteristics he's the king he the king of the jungle he's a strong leader that's his nature of the lion when the lion roars all are quiet so John thought about seeing the lion he thought that the Judgment would begin with him he thought the lion came to Judge John stops and he turns and looks perhaps he had his sight looking down and little by little he started lifting it up and when he sees the vision what he thought was a lamb that had been slain before the foundation of the world when he sees the lamb everyone begins to have a jubilee open the seals was the L not the lion it was the lamb because the nature of the Lamb was humility that when he went to sa he didn't claim his rights he gave up his for the benefit of many came died at the cross at Calvary he came and gave up his blood for the forgiveness for the Redemption for the restoration of those that had their name written down in the book of redemption but that book was sealed there was no salvation there was nothing we were all lost but what opened it what broke open the seals what opened the Mysteries was the nature of a lamb the lamb is humble the lamb forfeits his rights the lamb doesn't claim anything for itself in the time we live in to understand the mystery that had been hidden throughout the times everybody wanted to be at this time because the mystery would be revealed but the Myster is not found in the heavens the Mysteries are not in the written word the Myst is in the revealed word inside of the heart of man inside of the heart is the mystery who am I what do I represent in this age what are my rights what are my obligations what can I do what my position in Christ the only way I can understand who I am is when I let the nature of the Lamb come and just as the lamb forfeited his when he surrender his rights he gives up his life he projects the love to humanity and when love is projected Grace comes into action when Grace comes into action gra produ Grace produces a sacrifice and we're beneficiaries of that sacrifice now there's healing there's Liberation there's pardon there's restoration but where is it brother it's within me what do I have to do you have to make a decision that's all you have to make a decision that you will take this word and will remain there until this word be made life quick through the Revelation in my heart then I will be in another dimension I will walk different because I'm not going to trust what I can do I will walk in the way in the way of Hol absolutely no one can get lost less the less will know where to go in this walk in the Walk of God the Walk of Hol I won't go to other side to the other side Perfection is what he desires from us but Perfection as we think of it how is completely different now being humble the other is to be meek how can a person be meek man signif means virtue that moderates your wrath and it's disorderly effects wrath many of the decisions we make them we're angry we have wrath and we make decisions and the result will have disorderly effects on our lives it's a way of templ that avoids all movement out of order of resentment generally resentment have you ever been resentful against yourself many times we're we're angry we want to hit ourselves hate yourself all you want nothing will change no no all you have to do is make a decision your heart has to be a firm decision don't hit yourself with your hand yourself with the word of God start praying listen to the message read but brother it's because you don't understand me I don't have time that brother those are called excuses those are called excuses I'm G tell you who is the originator of all excuses it's the devil it's that simple so each time you make an excuse of why you can't grow spiritually then you're listening to the devil it's just that simple brother because I I work too much I'm too tired there's a word in Hebrew for excuses and the word is now we add Gest to it and we say I don't have time I work too much I'm too tired exus those are excuses exus those are excuses they excuses we need to be meak to be able to enter into the rest of Jesus and take on his yoke meekness is behaving with goodness and gentleness Serenity a good self-esteem autol in self-control is that easy to do brother it's not easy it's not easy then why did Jesus ask us to be meek if it's not easy he says my yoke is easy and my burden is light he's telling us that we have to be meek so then Jesus he's inviting us to take on the Yoke along with him and he will begin to show us how to be meek how to be humble and the problem is that many times we can't see what the word of God is tell what the message tells us meekness has to have a greatness and an interior strength to be able to face the difficult situations without recurring to violence or falling uh falling to to feelings resentment hate and bitterness here how many are Meek how many want to beak in order to be meek we have to study another concept which is to be diligent in order to be me we have to be diligent we have to be diligent Ephesians 5:15 in the following way just write it down see then that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil a diligent person knows how to take advantage of their time being diligent taking advantage of your time the definition of diligent is to fulfill with diligence with oneself means to be active not fall into laziness the worst en to a Christian this time is laziness it's idleness he doesn't fall into laziness because he has goals he fulfills them throughout time so then a diligent person has goals take advantage of time they plan their time they have a calendar they say okay I'm going to pray at 9:00 p.m. I'm going to pray doesn't matter watching TV I'm watching my favorite TV show Al is gonna confess to Maria gual go go PR don't worry about that yes brother [Music] it's time to pray should I go wait for him knock him out or should I go pray you go pray then afterwards you can watch the record you go ahead and record it then later you can enjoy it po or whatever you like some carrots a little bit of salad second Peter says brother bam used this scripture when he preached the stature of a perfect man and besid this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge preaches the St of a perfect man and the Apostle Peter thousands of years ago tells us that in order to be able to grow spiritually to reach adoption of a perfect man we have to be diligent because a diligent person doesn't make excuses doesn't blame others for their behavior they don't justify why they're found the condition they they don't blame their parents they don't blame the government they don't blame anybody they take the responsibility they take the commitment they begin to be D the main ingred for Christian to be adopted is diligence because a diligent person has goals what's the goal of a diligent Christian to reach the stature of a perfect man the Bible says that you you have to add you you have to add to your faith you have to add virtue who's going to add it you you that's why you have to be diligent you will make a commitment that you will do you will be the reflection of Jesus Christ in the time you live so then you have to have faith faith faith has a foundation the prophet tells us perfect Faith the foundation for faith is forgiveness in order to forgive you have to be meek because a person that is meak can control their emotions and their thoughts to be able to forgive you have to be humble because someone who's humble doesn't look for their rights no no no he did to me now it's time for payback oh you best believe if you have payback then you're going to have dou if you seek Vengeance for bitterness will fill your hearts your hearts can to be filled with bitterness and the devil's not going to take you outside chur he have you sitting in church with your heart full of bitterness if you want to be free from bitterness then forgive yourself first forgive yourself for your mistakes for not doing what you were supposed to do and then forgive if somebody else has offended you because the base for faith is without forgiveness there's no without faith there's no Revelation without Revelation there's no growth without growth there's no adoption all that just for not forgiving the musicians come forward the age of is trying to absorb us not to take us outside of church not to take you to the world is trying for you to have your heart full of resentment what the enemy wants is for you not to obey because the Lord Jesus Christ tells you don't obey what we've been taught brother says and he challenges us he says I challenge any person the correct mental attitude towards any Divine promise that is written in the word of God doesn't matter what it [Music] is correct mental attitude will make that promise be fulfilled in your life and he says if you could just obey what I am telling you there would be no one sick amongst us if you could only believe with all your heart what I am telling you the prophet says he wanted to change the attitude of the people that were listening to him and that's the purpose in this morning the word the Mage we can hear what the spirit is speaking to our hearts if we can just focus the words he's given us are etal promises are for us bit resent and say Lord I will no longer run I want to be a lamb to be done in my life I want your promise be through me if God chose you to manifest his glory then take that responsibility and say Lord this trial that you've given me it's hard and I don't know what to do but I will manifest Your Glory I will surrender because I will be a miracle for your honor and Glory I don't care about the traumas in my life I don't care about the complexes that I have I don't care if I'm sick Bren a part in my heart I will serve you I will obey you and I will will take this word and I will bring it to manifest the promise that you've given [Music] me God still restores matrimonies marriages God is still rest he's looking for someone to take his word that could take his word they can bring it to be made manifest God's still restoring lives God still giving the Holy Spirit if you desire the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is here to fill your heart God wants to remove any bad [Music] habits God wants to remove any incorrect influence we're in the world where young in our young ones they're inserting wrong ideas wrong thoughts in at [Music] school God wants to liberate anyone who feels oppressed by the enemy anything that's against the word of God will take you out of the path of the way and in the end it will destroy you depression will destroy you trying to taking your life is not an option God is more powerful than that God can heal your heart he can heal your soul depression will not destroy the children of God bitterness will not destroy the children of God it doesn't matter what kind of Torment you have your spirit at this time God is here to deliver you please stand place your needs in the hands of the Lord at this time the prophet said that the Lord Jesus Christ will not do absolutely nothing for you until you first accept it that these promises are for you doesn't matter what's happening in your life doesn't matter what's happened the problem the situation the circumstances if you accept that this is for you the prophet says if you believe and you confess it it's the only way that God will act on this hour when you first act believing accepting and confessing what God promised for your life God will fulfill it accept it believe it trust in [Applause] it God gives you the desire of your heart commitment with God at this time will not return to those negative thoughts the answer is within you it's not outside it's within feeling is inside of you within the restoration of your life is inside of you of your matrimony is inside of you it's a decision so that the word can be made [Music] manifest let's pray there where you find yourself just lift up your hands God left his incomparable throne he left the sing the praise of his angels he left the kingdom of Glory for you don't think that God doesn't listen or hear you don't think that God worry for the situation you find yourself in how low or how dark a situation may be God is there with you he's waiting for you to make that decision the correct decision our young people are being bombarded with so many incorrect things somebody has to stand in the Gap to intervene to intered so they can be delivered from the evil of the devil God is listening to your cry if you're crying out for your children don't stop crying out you're crying out for your parents you're crying out for your wife if you're asking for your husband
