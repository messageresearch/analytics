[31:00] foreign
[31:07] [Music]
[31:08] [Applause]
[31:10] [Music]
[31:30] and i want to tell you how i came
[31:33] to
[31:34] actually have this message
[31:41] [Music]
[31:44] his wife was going to give birth
[31:48] and in my mind everything was being
[31:50] projected and he mentioned
[31:52] the project i'm not sure if you the same
[31:54] way no
[31:56] but my mind went wild thinking wow he's
[31:59] going to have a girl mementos
[32:02] you see i always wanted a baby girl
[32:06] never had a baby girl
[32:08] so when i see brothers with daughters
[32:13] that's one thing that helps yes
[32:16] that's what we need
[32:17] in reference to para referencia the
[32:20] pastor of the house or the dad el pastor
[32:23] de la casa
[32:24] the little girl will always
[32:26] comfort
[32:39] a daughter in the family
[32:53] and then my heart just started getting
[32:55] torn up
[32:58] i had to go back to what brother brenham
[33:00] said
[33:02] and brother brenham said
[33:06] mary maria
[33:08] was a carrier
[33:11] let me say it again
[33:12] mary maria was a carrier
[33:16] she carried a seed
[33:19] we know that that seed
[33:22] according to matthew
[33:26] that the angel came to speak to her
[33:30] and that angel
[33:31] was gabriel
[33:33] and gabriel told her
[33:37] you have found favor
[33:40] and you're going to have a child
[33:43] by the holy ghost
[33:47] she had to accept the fact yeah
[34:08] [Applause]
[34:16] that's what we need to understand
[34:42] we gotta act on that
[34:48] all of a sudden joseph
[34:50] jose
[34:51] he wanted to put her away
[34:53] privately
[34:58] i believe that's how the bible says
[35:14] son
[35:26] for that which she has conceived
[35:42] the people of their sins
[35:47] a carrier
[35:49] and when that baby when that seed
[35:56] and it came forth salia and the baby
[36:00] that baby didn't need from marriage
[36:38] alone
[36:58] we went to colombia
[37:06] that his wife
[37:09] was going to give
[37:10] or bring forth
[37:12] light yes
[37:15] that's what the baby girl is
[37:18] she's light i guess loose she lights
[37:32] that god would take care of
[37:46] uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna
[37:48] pray so i can get into my message but i
[37:50] did want you to know
[37:53] this message came to me
[37:56] so if you'll please stand with me
[37:59] we're going to pray we're going to read
[38:00] the scripture
[38:02] then i have a short message
[38:07] our heavenly father we thank you this
[38:09] morning
[38:11] i ask that you help us
[38:15] that you reveal through faith
[38:30] so father bless each person
[38:33] bless their efforts for being here
[38:37] protect them
[38:39] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[38:41] pray
[38:42] amen amen
[38:44] uh turn with me we're we're still with
[38:46] the thought the whole plan of redemption
[38:54] continues
[38:57] hebrews 9 11 14.
[39:05] again the whole plan of redemption
[39:09] carrier carriers of the hour
[39:22] hebrews 9 11.
[39:24] but christ being come
[39:26] and high priest of good things to come
[39:29] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[39:32] not made with hands that is to say not
[39:34] of this building
[39:40] perfect
[39:48] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[39:51] but by his own blood
[39:53] he entered in once into the holy place
[39:57] having obtained eternal
[39:59] redemption for us
[40:12] for if the blood of bulls and goats
[40:15] and the ashes of heifer sprinkling the
[40:18] unclean sanctifieth
[40:21] to the purifying of the flesh
[40:34] how much more shall the blood of christ
[40:37] who through the eternal spirit
[40:39] offered himself without spot to god
[40:42] purge your conscience from dead works to
[40:45] serve the living god
[41:29] [Applause]
[41:46] thank you
[41:48] how many of us have faith
[41:50] you have faith raise your hand
[41:53] faith is a revelation
[41:58] without faith
[42:00] you can't
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:41] because it's a substance of things not
[42:44] substantial
[42:46] amen
[42:48] so we do have faith
[42:51] faith works
[42:53] through man
[43:09] some of us have great faith
[43:12] some of us have a little bit of faith
[43:16] of a mustard seed
[43:25] how many of us are anointed by a spirit
[43:30] by us
[43:33] we have to be
[43:35] his daughter was born
[43:37] if his daughter was born
[43:41] was she born with the spirit
[43:43] did the spirit come right after what is
[43:45] the same thing
[43:47] receive the spirit to have life
[43:51] can you say amen
[43:54] so we are aware
[43:57] that god
[43:58] gives us part of him
[44:01] when we're baptized
[44:04] of our salvation
[44:06] gives us just
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:43] [Applause]
[45:01] i have to leave the word of god
[45:09] and because the holy ghost
[45:11] will not be shamed with us
[45:17] that's as far as it goes
[45:20] okay
[45:22] that's as far as he goes
[45:24] he's waiting
[45:26] for the day
[45:27] that you and i keep studying sufficient
[45:30] faith
[45:50] how many of us are carriers
[45:55] if you're a carrier
[46:00] if you don't know what i mean you will
[46:02] today
[46:04] you see i i strongly believe that the
[46:06] first carriers
[46:11] during the time of noah there was a
[46:14] perverted carrier
[46:20] the carrier
[46:22] that was perverted
[46:26] and this morning when i was driving here
[46:29] i passed through dobbins and
[46:32] might have been 40
[46:34] no 53rd avenue
[46:38] nothing but
[46:40] crawls all over the place
[46:42] every light pulse had a crow
[46:46] i don't know
[46:50] lamppost on both sides
[46:56] so then i started thinking wow
[46:59] here's the curl
[47:02] goes out sally
[47:04] it starts nibbling
[47:06] remember he's the carrier
[47:21] he sees a dead body
[47:30] possibly back to the
[47:32] ark when he was full
[47:35] of
[47:52] the dove the next carrier
[47:55] goes out sally
[47:59] and it brings the twig
[48:03] telling noah
[48:16] the other carrier
[49:02] and give bad news
[49:07] can you say amen
[49:10] again you gotta remember carriers
[49:13] this is what carriers do
[49:17] they carry a message
[49:21] in other words
[49:24] you know it's a delivery man
[49:27] get ups
[49:28] amazon they come in a truck they leave
[49:31] something
[49:32] ups and downs

[49:50] up here you know they've got us

[58:26] [Applause]
[59:00] is that what it is
[59:05] this message is so simple
[59:08] it shouldn't go over our heads
[59:12] so then we are carriers
[59:14] we're carrying information to another
[59:29] it's going to put a smile on people
[59:37] can you say it man
[59:39] they're all over the place
[59:43] symptoms synthomas
[59:49] something that indicates
[59:52] the existence of something else
[59:54] physical
[59:56] or
[59:56] spiritual existence
[59:59] physical or spiritual
[1:00:03] do you understand what that means
[1:00:12] brother brenham said
[1:00:15] on tongues
[1:00:23] the gospel must go to all the world
[1:00:33] and it struck the whole world at that
[1:00:35] time
[1:00:42] is that what the bible says
[1:00:47] the known world right there
[1:00:50] it had to come like that
[1:00:53] because see
[1:00:55] all nations under heaven
[1:00:57] were gathered there
[1:01:03] in jerusalem
[1:01:05] what did he say
[1:01:06] wait until
[1:01:20] and he struck the whole world
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:32] the gospel to allah
[1:01:42] and they shall receive the power
[1:01:45] of the holy ghost
[1:01:47] do you believe that everybody accepted
[1:01:49] it
[1:01:50] do
[1:02:04] everybody
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:19] good ones and bad ones buenos aires
[1:02:31] but go into all the world
[1:02:38] so it had to be testified in language of
[1:02:41] the resurrection of christ
[1:02:49] so it would go to all the world right
[1:02:52] there
[1:02:55] what language do you speak
[1:03:00] if you speak spanish you go to a spanish
[1:03:03] country
[1:03:05] i could understand
[1:03:07] the language
[1:03:10] is that right
[1:03:11] what it's telling me you become a
[1:03:13] carrier
[1:03:42] me and these carriers here
[1:03:48] these people here
[1:03:50] in other words not the people in
[1:03:51] jerusalem
[1:03:56] would
[1:04:06] shoulder or the head of the people
[1:04:09] um
[1:04:38] a carrier
[1:04:53] nothing more not a must but a carrier
[1:04:56] that's what we say
[1:05:00] we carry a message
[1:05:03] we carry good news
[1:05:09] so if we believe
[1:05:11] that we're
[1:05:12] carriers
[1:05:14] of this great message
[1:05:17] what are we doing
[1:05:35] i came from
[1:05:37] the world
[1:05:39] i didn't know
[1:05:41] anything about this bible
[1:05:43] then i had to sit down
[1:05:46] because a lot of times i have nothing
[1:05:48] but a denomination in me
[1:05:53] one man
[1:05:54] can become
[1:05:56] a nation
[1:05:59] so all of a sudden
[1:06:01] i had to go back in my mind
[1:06:04] back when i was young
[1:06:08] i got a scholarship
[1:06:13] i had a scholarship
[1:06:15] to a private college
[1:06:29] so i was doing graduate work
[1:06:51] well the first thing i do is took my
[1:06:53] briefcase
[1:06:54] in my briefcase
[1:06:56] just so you know
[1:06:57] god saved me god took everything out of
[1:07:00] me
[1:07:02] and i was the smoker
[1:07:06] and the first thing
[1:07:08] open my briefcase
[1:07:10] i had a pant two pencils any of those
[1:07:13] lapis tablet
[1:07:16] my cigarettes
[1:07:21] and i was gonna smoke in class
[1:07:24] because when i went to school when they
[1:07:25] finished well i had
[1:07:56] i was very poor in those days
[1:08:00] so i sat next to some people
[1:08:03] they were eating
[1:08:05] they offered me some
[1:08:06] some of their food
[1:08:20] you need to dress up
[1:08:37] i would scratch my head and say what did
[1:08:39] i get into yo
[1:08:42] so then the first thing i go to class
[1:08:46] you have to take a religious class
[1:08:48] so in order for me to get this
[1:08:49] scholarship
[1:08:52] back then they didn't give scholarships
[1:08:54] to hispanics
[1:08:57] really really
[1:09:00] know what you were doing
[1:09:02] so all of a sudden
[1:09:04] i'm
[1:09:27] is everything that you're going to need
[1:09:28] for that course
[1:09:47] his travels
[1:09:48] the journeys that he made
[1:09:52] well i was a fan
[1:09:56] i was a bluffer
[1:09:57] i mean i'd read a little bit
[1:09:59] and had my own interpretation
[1:10:05] because that was it okay i said i'm not
[1:10:06] going to read
[1:10:08] yeah i'm going to read all basically
[1:10:11] what paul wrote in his book
[1:10:14] and know everything about it
[1:10:17] let me tell you that wasn't my way of
[1:10:18] thinking
[1:10:23] when i came into the message
[1:10:25] i left that i forgot all about it
[1:10:28] but what happens when you go to colleges
[1:10:31] private colleges that are religious
[1:10:32] colleges
[1:10:35] i think they had one ad
[1:10:38] night at phoenix tabernacle so people
[1:10:40] could get their degrees and all that
[1:10:55] helping individuals
[1:11:03] so all of a sudden i'm in the message
[1:11:06] and then i i'm thinking what brother
[1:11:08] branham said
[1:11:10] well
[1:11:11] the baptists believe this way
[1:11:15] and the methodists believe this
[1:11:18] the lutherans believe this
[1:11:20] what's god going to judge yeah
[1:11:37] and i thank god that god sent us a
[1:11:42] carrier
[1:11:43] his name william merriam
[1:11:46] william branham because all of a sudden
[1:11:48] this bible here
[1:11:50] came real
[1:12:19] a carrier
[1:12:33] [Applause]
[1:12:34] i thank god for what he's done
[1:12:41] because they broke it down
[1:13:02] this is
[1:13:17] where's the mailman
[1:13:18] he just knocked away
[1:13:20] they're fast
[1:13:22] they put their mail out
[1:13:28] so where's that mail carrier
[1:13:35] well we're waiting for the carrier
[1:13:37] good news
[1:13:55] oh okay

[1:14:18] and do me a favor
[1:14:21] because this is important
