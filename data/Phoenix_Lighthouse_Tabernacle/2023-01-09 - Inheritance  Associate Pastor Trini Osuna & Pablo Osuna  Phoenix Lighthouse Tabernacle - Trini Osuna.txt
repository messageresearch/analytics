it please you for all of us to be here you guide us yes every one of us that are here we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen before we sit down I'd like for us to read in Hebrews Hebrews chapter 9 verse 15. read the following is 9 15 in Hebrews for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance amen you may please take your seats once again God bless every one of you this morning for me it's an honor thank our pastor for this privilege okay foreign I'm going to just talk to you for a few moments last time it was my life to speak I spoke for a few minutes we spoke a little bit of what an inheritance is that's why I read the scripture is a complete Plan of Redemption if you read from verses 9 to verse 15. you'll be able to read it all at all but this morning like speak of an eternal inheritance it is yeah inheritance is an effect of inheriting has no beginning nor end Ed before I get too far ahead I'd like to ask what inheritance are we going to leave our sons and daughters lately I've been able to listen to some messages from Brother Bernie yes which is called the Christian home it's a series of one two and three uh and that's where you can find the messages so I heard a little of those three messages foreign and brother Bernie covers a lot I'm going to cover myself with religion I still had not yet got to Phoenix Tabernacle when brother Bernie preached these messages there the person interpreting me yes that's what I say it was before 79. I don't have the exact date speaks very explicitly okay what a Christian home is you may say well now while my children are grown yeah what am I going to listen to those for now remember the grandchildren are on their way the great grandchildrenheit so you need to know everything brother Bernie said for there are things yes but only brother Bernie could say we're not trying to exalt ourselves or lower ourselves but if you listen to if you listen to brother Bernie's these messages you'll be able to understand why he said those things Diabla is and he hits hard on the parents moms and dads he says mom stays home and watches over the children watches over them educates them and sends them to school but brother Bernie says we want our children to be educated in school brother Bernie says there that children are educated at home and if you listen to these messages you'll understand foreign teaches them and she's the supervisor as they have jobs they know what a supervisor is what a manager is Mom what she is at home he says that the the father is the one in charge in the evening when father comes home mom tells them well he behaved and and she misbehaved for us not to be too cruel to speak to our children but first of all brother Bernie says Mom and Dad have to sit down together say this and this happened what are we going to do and both need to be in agreement what they're going to be doing foreign we prefer to be at work to be at home I worked for many years he is and it's easier you got ta go and clock in at work get a break every two hours get your lunch break but mom when she gets her break or when does she take her lunch even worse if she's struggling a little into it so I do want to speak a little bit about work sometimes we want for our children to follow our footsteps and that's good if I'm a mechanico may my son be a mechanic but also myself as a father I got my hands very dirty my uniform dirty hope my son gets an easier job but with time our children realize that there's not an easy job agenda and I buy an agenda for the year yeah and they're an agenda Proverbs are written notes one of them reads choose a job that you love yes and that way it won't feel like a job how many do we have a job that we don't like or that we haven't liked but we go to work to help our family move forward if you're there at work just thinking you're going to make your boss Rich okay he's going to be able to build another home and you don't even have enough to eat you won't be happy at work you need to have a chain of thought that with this money and be able to help my family move forward soon I'll try and get a better job but years go by you know and when does it get that other job here when I got here for 10 years I was at this job and I worked and what I needed to work to help my family uh move forward after 10 years I was able to get a job that I loved in in Mexico I had a job where I worked with heavy machinery and then I hear with the years I was able to get a job with that type of Industry that's why I didn't hear a brother Bernie's advice be a barber I didn't understand what a barber was years later brother Bernie told me why didn't you listen to me I wanted you to get your barber's license he's also an engineer thank God but if I was a good Barber you are Miss Universe like what brother Bernie wanted he didn't explain at all and don't think I'm blaming brother Bernie it was my fault I like my job bingo been retired for a little bit more than three years I'd like to go back sometimes okay even though it wouldn't be a bad idea medicine but my family the ones that still work at the employment where I used to work tell me if you get back there how are you on the spot but I stop and think so I'm going to drive more to the hospital in the pharmacy then drive over there Bonito why am I reading so much about work and second Thessalonians from seven to ten these were quotes from the Bible that brother Bernie taught us you see me for yourself know how you ought to follow us for we behave not ourselves disorderly among you Nico fatigue neither did we eat any man's breath or not but rot with labor and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you foreign we have no power but to make ourselves an example unto you to follow us for even when we were with you this we command you that if any would not work neither should he eat if no one wants to no this is you can't work with glory to God you worked for many years already you may feel like going back to work yeah your mind you think you're strong enough to go to work foreign when I said when I read of not yes it's freely or or freely given in other words the Apostle Paul was trying to gain what he ate it is we have to work have something that Rings like this they say education is education is the main garment so the Feast of life so I wasn't able to educate myself and your children have are able to educate themselves back them with all you can okay my son is in a mailman my daughter is a teacher why is my daughter a teacher I know that'll make a lot of money I asked my daughter why are you a teacher foreign foreign foreign I like numbers so brother Danny and his wife the pros and cons of professions he wants to follow his dad's footsteps to meet a barber yeah this and that can happen but if you get this other career is listen that may happen we like for our children to do what we ask them to do foreign and every one of us foreign God bless you [Applause] yeah going back on what we said in Eternal inheritance and uh and when working right uh if I've had something from my father it's a good example it's a life lived and that that uh that example that he's given me that I've gotten from my parents this inheritance that I've gotten from my parents you know it has been the this pattern that they've given me you know to work hard and to be disciplined I've gotten I've been very fortunate you have gotten that from my parents I know I have a long way to go I know maybe my dad would tell you the same thing in little details but moving forward with that when my dad told me what he was gonna try to go forward this morning and he was going to go forward with speaking on on this uh of working and Eternal inheritance you know being able to give the advice that he gave us you know I I went back to thinking on well we covered a little bit last time we talked a little bit about Luke 10 2. it was a message that brother Bernie uses the life of the Lord Jesus Christ he speaks on a lot about about laborers you know when we covered this we were talking about uh where we were at of two weeks ago you know and maybe being able to look forward and and being able to think and say you know I want to be better this year and and I and I that's what I took from this message that I wanted to be better and I wanted to be more of more of a worker and try to have that mindset and so try to move forward with that where I'm not going to ask you to turn to it in Luke 10 2 Lucas the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few sobreros you know that's a big thing that brother Bernie uses in this message in number two you know he he's speaking to the people and at the end of the first message he says you know we speak of these Great Men of Matthew Lucas John and they're and they are great men but he tells the congregation you have to understand they were not greater than what we are okay if you were to understand he says there are men like Matthew men like Mark here in this in this taverns and when we have that here you know men like those Hombres that are able to help us today you know brother Bernie says there so he asks you know what is the will of God you know it's to receive the receiving the one that he has sent right the one that Moses had spoken of to receive him to receive the Lord Jesus Christ that was uh something that we tried to cover last time and just speak a little bit on that and so and we're going on to that uh the word laborers you know our brother Bernie also said that he was going to entitle the message he just says that really quickly but he wants to talk about laborers so he goes on he's like oh I want to speak on on laborers you know and it was something that I that I wanted to move forward with because it's it's a I wanted to take it along with what my father had said you know right before the scripture in Luke 10 2. you know there's a lot that's happening and we read a word that is this is It's entitled in the Bible where the Lord has compassion right right before this you know the Lord Jesus Christ is giving teachings you know he gives the teaching of oh if you if you want to come with me you know take up your cross no deny yourself and then follow me and this is one of the ones he gives you know and then there's a young lady that's resurrected a woman that is healed you know two Blind Men are healed a man that was mute recovers and speaks and these are the things that are happening right before this the scripture comes up and then if it will turn real quickly to Matthew 9 I'll be Matthew 9 35. this is where all the things that were happening before and in 35 it reads and Jesus went about other cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing sicknesses and every disease among the people is so this is all that was happening right before right before but when we saw the multitudes 36 he was moved with compassion on them because they were fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherdsas pastor 37 then sayeth he unto his disciples the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into the Harvest Campos that's what he refers as the Harvest Right Los Campos agriculture it's the Harvest the fields what's the script is telling us here you that follow me you ask me for me to do what I'm gonna do that's what the scripture is and I said in Spanish because that's the way where the Bernie brought it and that message was preached in Spanish it was in 1988 so maybe there was an interpreter in the back but the recording is just for the burning he places the foundation there the laborers he says when he's looking upon the Harvest Lord Jesus Christ looking upon the Harvest what's he talking about was he talking about the fields when he says um brother Bernie says that that's is it's not like the crops it's all the people looking upon the people the Harvest truly is great but the laborers you know and uh and you know what is a labor right okay that does what they need to do you know maybe discipline or moves forward with it and these are the type of workers that uh brother Bernie is mentioning towards you know like we have examples here we mentioned the last time that's that's a labor that's a worker associate pastors when it comes to the Sunday School those are workers people they come come early you know get ready they're checking everything that the mics or someone comes and they cleansea Bernie says it's all work there's just so much work and there's work everywhere foreign but that's kind of stuff that it takes work you know it takes work for one to to be here in the evening away from your family the drive here and practice to sing a song to honor the Lord Jesus Christ and that was the purpose that each one of them did it and that's the reason why we have those specials foreign that's when he brings up more uh more examples right in in the in the first message that's when he maybe brings up about Mark and when he brings about Paul trial Marcos and then he he says they say you know there are there are more than one type of worker in the in the physical there's physical and then mentality you can be praying that's that's work that's needed and of course you need to get here early but if you if you're there at your house you get up early on Sunday morning and you pray today be with the person that's going to speak be with the song you know and those type of work is what we need yes and people that are willing to do those kinds of jobs why don't we have enough workers oh we go to the special services you know and uh the church sings a song is who do they praise who do they say that was that was a great job they say that to the pastor and people say oh I did all the work I'm the one that was here singing your church sounded amazing right that's the examples that brother Bernie is giving away I do all this work I get here early and they don't even give me 15 minutes I'm here I was just saying in general right I don't know if you heard dog he said I gave you 20 and my time is almost up what where the money says that that's how we think that we just oh they don't care about me oh no no it's important you know I'm doing the work I'm doing everything that I can and then they don't give me nothing yeah familiar let us be laborers said but I say this is paraphrasing what he said this is not received payment here in this world but receive its eternal life is the biggest human being can receive okay there's a payment for the Son of God has received the Revelation that we live in the most precious time and in the darkest time that has ever existed neces sometimes a person can never surrender 100 to God if he comes by fear until that person falls in love with God that's when he will surrender is small things that's how we can be it's contagious run them I have something here brother Graham says in English I'm already in English reached in 1959 on November 15th my new ministry that's God yes part of God's program preaching is his program when he looked upon the apostles he looked upon the Harvest he said a harvest is ripe and the laborers pray the Lord of the Harvest he will send laborers into the Harvest how many remember that well why would they have to pray to the Lord of the Harvest to send laborers into his Harvest if the lord of the Harvest was standing there knowing it would be done why [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to share this little place asking at this moment father you forgive us for anything we just want to accept so that you may give us the desire to be laborers for you give me your desires father give my brother and your desires your desires to be more like you we love you father we thank you for all things in your name the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I bless you foreign [Applause] service of this year you can take your seats as they were speaking first of all with Brothers he's said that the work I started thinking back there well I think I work more retired then when I worked for a fact that put more hours all it is is criticized so I tell you this is in fact but it needs to be a revelation it needs to be a revelation with a thought that was brought if I don't have a revelation Revelation how can I be a worker if I'm not trained how can I be a worker why are there so many few workers in the fields not only in this church there's churches that you gotta beg people to help so we are the cream of the crops we ask people to do something and they do it because it has become a revelation if it's not a revelation Carlos where's the money where's my money well I had to do this I had to do that I don't get the pat on the back and I did all this work uh I'm sorry um let's see here come up here real fast like who is General Pershing uh who was Sergeant York sergeant um who was General Pershing who went into New Mexico he was the General Persians York York won the Congressional Medal of Honor canola congregation during World War One had a revelation more Pentecostal than anything else he refused to fight until he had the revelation of why he was fighting if you look up history two individuals that we don't know who cleans the church the only thing you know is thank God for brother Montoya you only remember the leaders but you don't remember the workers thank God for Jesus Christ but we don't remember the workers that worked for him it's a revelation and that's why we work not all people were called or the mission fields we want to go but many of us were not called to do that that Pastor was never called to the mission he was called to preach the gospel married people dedicate babies but he was never called foreign coming to church on Sunday afternoon Thursday night I mean we've been so relaxed I don't know no no say if I can take a Sunday night I'm just letting you know we're in laodicea yeah we're all relaxed having a great time dump it from here to there you work at it and as you work at it you either get more relaxed and you forget what you need to do or am I the only one are we relaxed as we relaxed within the family structure what's tearing a family down it's relaxation is foreign foreign we're starting the new year as we start a new year we are going to be concerns but it's up to you share with your family that we do need workers that's why we're training young people and then we're showing off I like to show off we have to show off talentos so foreign looking and I'm seeing young man I'm seeing a young man being able to express the revelation God has put in his heart because many churches what's in store for tomorrow I came from 77. excuse me I lived the 77. some of you were born in 77. they were still planning those potatoes but I have to train individuals if we don't train them who's going to take over tomorrow that's why we trained that's why Revelations because it seems that if we we didn't have training and I die tomorrow I die tomorrow those are the questions many pastors and they never trained the persona because all their young people foreign because they were never told that there's a better world for them we were brought up in a certain age that today we have a lot as we have been taught you're going to have to let him go sooner or later you will have to let him go they have to make that decision what they're going to do for the future and the more I give young people the more we rely foreign foreign but there will be a tomorrow and the more we can trainer the more we can teach the same thing that our Apostolic fathers taught us and not get away from that isn't that calling prior to singing there was an individual that needed prayer life has always been hard foreign [Music] if you have someone and let me tell you why I want to pray this is [Music] my heart goes out to the brothers to the brothers and Sinaloa where the cartels it's
